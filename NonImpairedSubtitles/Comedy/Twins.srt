1
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,442
On his 35th birthday,

2
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:31,713
l decided to tell Julius Benedict...

3
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:34,721
the truth about himself.

4
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:41,256
Julius already knew
that he was the product...

5
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,763
of a scientific experiment...

6
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:46,129
conducted by the American government.

7
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,337
A top-secret experiment designed
to produce a physically,

8
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:56,240
mentally and spiritually
advanced human being.

9
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:02,911
He knew that,
unlike other little boys,

10
00:01:02,984 --> 00:01:06,818
he had not one, but six fathers--

11
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:09,219
All very distinguished men...

12
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,225
especially chosen for
their genetic excellence.

13
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:16,362
And of course,

14
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,627
he knew about Mary Ann Benedict,

15
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:24,367
the remarkable young woman...

16
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:27,271
who was selected to be his mother.

17
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:48,122
Sadly, he had long lived
with the tragic knowledge...

18
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:52,996
that his mother died
while giving birth to him.

19
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:59,702
Now, what Julius did not know,

20
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:02,709
not until this very moment,

21
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:07,043
was that about a minute
after he was born...

22
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:11,881
his mother gave birth
to another baby boy.

23
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:02,359
l have a brother?

24
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:04,666
Ya.

25
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,333
He was sent to an orphanage
in Los Angeles...

26
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:10,707
at the same time
l brought you here to the island.

27
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:16,446
Julius had spent his entire life
here on the island,

28
00:03:16,517 --> 00:03:20,044
helping me with my research.

29
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:23,488
l always thought he was happy,
and had no desire to leave.

30
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:25,650
How wrong l was.

31
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:28,820
l must find him.

32
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:34,333
Julius, Julius!
Wait, wait.

33
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:39,033
l couldn't believe he was going.

34
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:44,175
He wasn't equipped to deal
with the outside world.

35
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:48,745
All of his knowledge was from books.

36
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:52,818
Julius could speak 12 languages.

37
00:03:52,887 --> 00:03:55,355
He excelled in history, science,

38
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:58,016
mathematics, literature.

39
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:00,925
He was pure in body and in spirit.

40
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:02,087
Ahhh!

41
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:05,155
But for the first time,

42
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:07,427
Julius would not listen to me.

43
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:11,028
He's probably just like me.

44
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:24,717
The nearest island with
an airport was 27 miles away.

45
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:30,787
But Julius did not care.

46
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:33,486
He had become obsessed
with the idea...

47
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:37,053
that his brother, Vincent,
was in some kind of trouble...

48
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:40,430
and desperately needed his help.

49
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:46,500
Honey, l'm home!

50
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:48,769
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no.

51
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:51,311
- Get going!
- l'm going.

52
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:17,694
Oh, hello, hello!

53
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:20,205
Oh, my goodness!

54
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:29,472
Good-bye.

55
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:42,085
- We're gonna be late for work.
- l need my horoscope.

56
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:45,529
- Yeah, horoscope.
- ''Your judgment is at its peak today.

57
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,762
Use it wisely,
and romance will follow.''

58
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:52,431
- Ooh, good one.
- l hope so.

59
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:54,701
Ladies!

60
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:57,903
- Vince!
- l thought you broke up with him.

61
00:05:57,978 --> 00:05:59,946
l did, l did!

62
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,619
- You don't mind if l talk
to your sister, do you?
- She doesn't mind.

63
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:09,883
Don't give him any money.

64
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:14,758
Uh, no, no, l promised Marnie
l wouldn't give you any money.

65
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:21,996
Don't look at me like--

66
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,867
Don't do that thing
with your eyes.

67
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:28,534
l'm not even supposed
to be here with you.

68
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:32,067
You are here,
and so am l.

69
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:34,740
Maybe millions
of people go by,

70
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:37,079
but they all
disappear from view.

71
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:40,882
l only have eyes
for you, Linda.

72
00:06:40,955 --> 00:06:43,890
l only have
eyes for you.

73
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:48,857
Mmm.

74
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:52,956
- lt's the baby Klane!
- What?

75
00:06:55,536 --> 00:06:57,527
- Hi.
- Hi.

76
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:00,129
- Can l help you?
- Uh, yeah.

77
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:02,835
Where's the little shit?

78
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,435
You'll have to be
more specific...

79
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,946
concerning the clientele.

80
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:10,006
Benedict.

81
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:13,247
Oh, he wouldn't come in here.

82
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,413
- lsn't that right, Marnie?
- Who, Vincent?

83
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:20,759
That weasel? That creep?

84
00:07:20,828 --> 00:07:24,491
l wouldn't serve him if he crawled in
on his hands and knees.

85
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:30,668
Take out the papers
and the trash

86
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:34,265
Or you don't get
no spending cash

87
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:37,002
lf you don't scrub
that kitchen floor

88
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:41,514
You ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

89
00:07:41,582 --> 00:07:44,983
Yakety-yak
don't talk back

90
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:48,681
l knew you were trouble
the second l laid eyes on you.

91
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:53,318
Excuse me. l just have never
heard this kind of music before.

92
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:57,991
Yakety-yak
don't talk back

93
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:00,226
Take out the papers

94
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,700
Take out the papers

95
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,568
Take... out...
the... papers

96
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,200
Take out the papers
Take out the papers

97
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:13,044
Take... out...
the... papers

98
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:15,604
And the trash
Trash

99
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:27,326
La-la-la
La-la-la

100
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,524
La-la-la

101
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:37,735

00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:45,769
Thank you.

103
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:50,241
Raf-a-hoo
Fa-haf-ha

104
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:54,686
Sew-do-a
Fair-da

105
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,398

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

112
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:46,105
Hey, Vince!

113
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:48,232
Listen, Al,

114
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:50,435
you gotta help me out.

115
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:53,037
l'm into the Klane
brothers for $20,000.

116
00:09:53,113 --> 00:09:56,378
- You borrowed money from a loan shark?
- What do you got?

117
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,749
Got anything for me?
See what you got.

118
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,311
We're doing this
too often, Vince.

119
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,516
l'll give you something.

120
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:07,754
l got a nice BMW
up on 4, stall 20.

121
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:45,888
Vince, l'll take all
of these you can get.

122
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:48,764
All right, Tony.

123
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:51,235
- For you.
- Thanks, Tony.

124
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:53,239
Yeah.

125
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:55,241
Whoa, Tony!

126
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:59,803
There's only $4000 here.
For a car like this is $6000.

127
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,542
We're in a recession.
Everything's tough.

128
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:05,380
You wanna try someone else,
no hard feelings.

129
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:07,716
No, l just could've
used some more.

130
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:10,416
- You okay, Vince? You seem worried.
- Yeah.

131
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,856
Your bowels troubling you?

132
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:24,997
What an amazing country.

133
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:27,838
Hey.

134
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:29,842
Gotta light, pal?

135
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,903
Oh, excuse me.
l don't smoke, pal.

136
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:36,040
Yeah. Ha-ha.

137
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:39,017
Yeah, good stuff, huh?

138
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:42,715
- Pickin' up something
for the girlfriend?
- l don't have a girlfriend.

139
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,223
Do women really
wear those things?

140
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,226
lf you're lucky, they do.

141
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:49,228
l can't believe it.

142
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:51,321
- You're from out of town?
- Yes.

143
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:55,391
As a matter of fact, l come from
an island in the South Pacific.

144
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:58,199
Whoa!

145
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:03,068
What the hell did
you do to him, man!

146
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:07,136
l did nothing.
The pavement was his enemy.

147
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:11,150
Let me check him out.
A light concussion.

148
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:12,947
Uh-oh.

149
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,318
- l carry him to a hospital.
- No!

150
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:17,721
l think you should
just take off, man.

151
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,782
Find your horse
you came in on.

152
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,760
l'm so sorry about this.

153
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,854
- l feel terrible.
- Me, too. Thanks a lot.

154
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:26,956
- Sorry.
- Yeah, l'm sorry.

155
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:30,697
The next time you should
really consider wearing helmets.

156
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:32,796
Yeah, have a nice day.

157
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:36,070
You don't have to buy them.
Just don't say they're cheap!

158
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:39,772
These are quality socks.

159
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:43,282
What a day it's been.
Oh, no, no, no!

160
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,511
Oh, oh! Jesus Christ!

161
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:49,646
$53! Are you
out of your mind?

162
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:53,159
Your vehicle is in a handicapped zone,
if you didn't notice.

163
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:55,558
So, do l look
normal to you?

164
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:57,859
You don't have a handicapped
sticker in your windshield.

165
00:12:57,931 --> 00:13:01,025
Oh, come on.
You don't need a sticker.

166
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:03,092
Handicapped, my ass!

167
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,968
l'll need your
driver's license, sir.

168
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,633
Look, l'm sorry
l lost my temper.

169
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,643
Driver's license,
please.

170
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:13,612
- Look, l had a very bad day.
- Driver's license... please.

171
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,377
You've got over 200 outstanding
parking tickets, Mr. Benedict.

172
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:20,614
You just had your birthday.
Your driver's license expired.

173
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:22,678
Happy birthday.
Watch your head.

174
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:24,815
Thanks.

175
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:33,623
Come along, now.

176
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,224
So this is where
my brother grew up.

177
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,953
l'm so happy he had so many
children to play with.

178
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:46,733
And that's where
he must have slept!

179
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:49,434
Yes, it was.

180
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:51,495
How did you know?

181
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:54,633
lt's the one l'd have chosen,
close to the fire extinguisher.

182
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,643
ln case of a fire,

183
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,112
l could have given the alarm
and saved all the other orphans.

184
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,613
We've had only one fire
in here at St. Charlotte's.

185
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:08,019
Vince Benedict started it,
we like to think by accident.

186
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,053
Tell me a little bit
about Vincent.

187
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:16,962
Was he a great athlete?
lnterested in chess and poetry?

188
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:19,830
l'm certain God had a purpose
when he created Vince Benedict,

189
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,699
but it had nothing
to do with chess or poetry.

190
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:24,762
Oh, l'm sorry.

191
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,772
Odd, the contents
of his files are missing.

192
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:33,677
That is Vince?

193
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,739
He looks so happy.

194
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:38,718
He should.
That's Sister Maria,

195
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:41,381
- his biology teacher.
- l always liked biology.

196
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:43,356
So did Vincent.

197
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,791
He disgraced Sister Maria,

198
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,885
who had to leave the order.

199
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:51,728
Then he stole all the money from
the library fund, and ran away.

200
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,734
l must find my brother.

201
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:56,236
Do you know
where he might be?

202
00:14:56,304 --> 00:14:59,205
Jail, a man of his character
can only be in jail.

203
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:03,438
You're full of goodness, Julius.
l pray you never find him.

204
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:09,940
Benedict, visitor.

205
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,800
- l'm looking for Vincent Benedict.
- You got him.

206
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:32,933
l have rowed halfway
across the world--

207
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:35,060
Wrong, l just rowed a day--

208
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:42,637
l've been looking forward to
this moment my whole life.

209
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,201
l've been on my island,
l'm telling you.

210
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,249
This is incredible that--
l have looked for--

211
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,693
You've gotta talk
into the phone, Bozo.

212
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:04,265
Vincent.
Yes, Vincent...

213
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:06,630
l know you don't
know who l am.

214
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:09,329
- But believe me, l came--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

215
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,998
l've got another six hours
to pay the money back.

216
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,236
Tell the Klane brothers that harassing
a man already in the slammer...

217
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,574
is beneath even them,
all right?

218
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,876
l don't know any Klane brothers.
l'm your brother, Julius.

219
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:25,051
Huh? Come again?

220
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,680
My name is Julius,
and l'm your twin brother.

221
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:32,549
Oh, obviously.

222
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:37,530
The moment l sat down, l thought
l was looking into a mirror.

223
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,067
We are not
identical twins.

224
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,227
- Oh, no?
- No.

225
00:17:42,303 --> 00:17:44,066
l wouldn't be
too sure, pal.

226
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:46,038
l don't lie.
l am your brother.

227
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,575
You must let me help
you get out of here.

228
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:51,134
You want to
help me get out?

229
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:52,702
Yes, right now.

230
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,614
Well, money talks,
and bullshit walks.

231
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:03,522
How can bullshit walk?
That's slang, huh?

232
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:05,183
Yeah.

233
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,194
l'm in fast company here.

234
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:09,787
Take a look over there.
See that man?

235
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:12,958
Pay him money, all right?
They let me out.

236
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:15,502
l'll be anything you want,
your aunt, uncle, sister...

237
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,504
your cousin,
brother-in-law, anything.

238
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:20,871
- All right?
- Okay, l pay right now.

239
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,534
- You pay now.
- Okay, Vince.

240
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,703
Okay. Go pay.

241
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:26,770
All right, pay him.

242
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:31,479
What is this,
''Candid Camera''?

243
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:35,412
Ahhh, oof!

244
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:40,520
Twinny, l hope you didn't
blow your wad on the tickets,

245
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:44,395
because l'm gonna need
a lot more money to get my car.

246
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:46,490
- l have more money.
- You do?

247
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,661
l'm glad to help you.
Vincent, l'm your brother.

248
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:52,001
- l love you.
- Whoa!

249
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:55,065
Look, ease up
on the love talk,

250
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:58,203
because l'm gonna be tossing
my cookies in a minute.

251
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:00,474
Tossing your cookies?

252
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:02,516
Oh, that's more slang!

253
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,245
Where the hell is it?

254
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:10,617
- This is your car, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's it.

255
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,252
You pay a huge fine,
then they hide it on you.

256
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:16,491
- How'd you know this was my car?
- We're twins!

257
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:20,091
l'm so excited. Now we can
go to museums together,

258
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:23,137
talk philosophy together,
read books together.

259
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,672
- Play chess together.
- Get lost together.

260
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,544
Vincent!

261
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:38,274
He's so full of energy.

262
00:19:42,824 --> 00:19:44,758
Blue Sedan DeVille.

263
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:47,294
This is beautiful.

264
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:49,262
Where you guys going,
out to Hawaii?

265
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,458
- Catch some of them big waves?
- Yeah, something like that.

266
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:54,558
We have plenty
of room on level 4.

267
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:43,874
l'll call you
next Saturday.

268
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,385
Whoa, where you going
with my desk?

269
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,388
Takin' back this
furniture, man.

270
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,823
- You're six months behind.
- You're behind!

271
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:55,257
Six months behind.
That's the problem.

272
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:57,661
There's no trust
in the world anymore.

273
00:20:57,732 --> 00:21:00,292
l tried to stop them,
Mr. Benedict.

274
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:02,427
That's all right, it was
time to redecorate anyway.

275
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:06,798
Vincent Benedict lncorporated.

276
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:08,933
- Sports agent...
- Airborne!

277
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:13,278
- Mr. Benedict?
- Yeah?

278
00:21:13,347 --> 00:21:16,248
- lt's Al.
- lt's Al? Ooh, Al, Al, Al.

279
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,115
Look, Miss Busby, uh--

280
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:21,018
Al, hang on a second.

281
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:24,183
The corporation's in
a transitional period right now.

282
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:28,490
Take a couple of days off.
When we regroup, l'll call you.

283
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:30,963
Whatever you think is best.

284
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:33,023
- All right.
- l'll take this.

285
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,035
Yeah, go ahead.
Take that.

286
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:38,266
Before l forget,
happy birthday.

287
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,639
Oh, how sweet.

288
00:21:43,711 --> 00:21:45,736
That's very,
very nice of you.

289
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:49,840
- Aqua Velva?
- Mm-hmm.

290
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:53,853
You shouldn't have.
Stacey.

291
00:21:55,823 --> 00:21:57,791
l'll give you
a call, okay?

292
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,453
All right, all right.

293
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,723
Al, save me!

294
00:22:02,797 --> 00:22:05,766
Brand-new Caddy on level 4.

295
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,802
l'll be there!
Don't move! Bye.

296
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,175
Whoa!

297
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,911
Time's up, Vincent.

298
00:22:28,523 --> 00:22:31,583
Did you hit me?
Because l didn't feel a thing.

299
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:34,561
l felt that.

300
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:38,292
You gotta understand
something, Benedict.

301
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:40,357
l like my work.

302
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:45,136
These are the most unfriendly acts
you're committing.

303
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:47,333
l don't know
what the problem is,

304
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,569
but l'm sure it
can be resolved...

305
00:22:49,644 --> 00:22:51,942
- without resorting to violence.
- Yeah.

306
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:53,674
Okay?

307
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:56,114
Okay.

308
00:23:00,454 --> 00:23:02,513
- You moved too soon.
- He did?

309
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,648
Ahhh!

310
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:07,694
A little chest pain?

311
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:11,289
The first rule
in a crisis situation:

312
00:23:11,365 --> 00:23:14,562
You negotiate first
and you attack last.

313
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:16,569
You negotiate first,
then you attack.

314
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:18,696
- You never negotiated.
- Na-hah!

315
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,570
You don't know what
kind of an enemy l am.

316
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:24,407
- Who are you?
- l'm Vincent's brother.

317
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:26,639
- We're twins.
- That's right.

318
00:23:27,982 --> 00:23:30,007
- You're firewood!
- Axe, Axe, Axe!

319
00:23:31,552 --> 00:23:34,316
You have no respect
for logic.

320
00:23:34,388 --> 00:23:36,822
- But he's got an axe!
- Ahhhh!

321
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:43,855
And l have no respect for those
who have no respect for logic.

322
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:49,167
You're a very stupid person.

323
00:23:52,673 --> 00:23:54,937
You tell your brother,

324
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,240
he messes with me, he messes
with my whole family!

325
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,342
l love it when you
hit people, Julius.

326
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:06,784
Boom!

327
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,422
That was great!

328
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,424
Actually,
l hate violence.

329
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,426
But you're so good at it!

330
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,792
l've got an idea. We should
go into business together.

331
00:24:15,863 --> 00:24:18,195
You could be a boxer.
l could be your manager.

332
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:21,702
- l don't think l could fight for money.
- No problem!

333
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:25,170
You do all the fighting,
l'll keep all the money.

334
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:27,799
l'm really worried
about you, Vincent.

335
00:24:29,277 --> 00:24:31,711
How much money
do you owe?

336
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:34,714
Don't lie to me.
We're twins.

337
00:24:34,782 --> 00:24:38,718
- l can feel your pain.
- Why do you keep saying that?

338
00:24:38,786 --> 00:24:40,777
We're not twins.
We're not brothers.

339
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,789
We're nothin'!

340
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:49,457
Twenty thousand.

341
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:53,059
Due this morning.

342
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:00,907
Come on.

343
00:25:11,098 --> 00:25:13,464
Don't worry about
anything, Vincent.

344
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:17,334
As long as l'm with you,
l won't let anyone harm you, okay?

345
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:24,378
Well, you're
a good guy, Julius.

346
00:25:24,445 --> 00:25:26,845
Now, hang on
to your seat!

347
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:39,793
You know what?
l completely forgot.

348
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:42,421
l promised this
friend, Sammy,

349
00:25:42,496 --> 00:25:44,760
that l'd pick his car up
from the airport.

350
00:25:44,832 --> 00:25:46,766
Put it in the slot.

351
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,927
Would you do me
a big favor?

352
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:52,166
Would you drive this car back
from the airport for me?

353
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,174
Oh, l would love to.

354
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:56,369
Good, that would
really be a big help.

355
00:25:56,444 --> 00:25:59,971
Do you have a manual, please?

356
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:03,679
- A manual?
- Yeah.

357
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:07,921
- lt's in the glove compartment.
- Oh, yeah.

358
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:10,048
There it is.

359
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:20,425
- What are you doin' with the finger?
- Learning to drive.

360
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:22,298
Whoa!

361
00:26:23,337 --> 00:26:25,202
lt's not up here.

362
00:26:25,273 --> 00:26:27,639
Maybe it's under
the back tire.

363
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:32,077
Look... l mean, usually he
leaves the keys behind the tire.

364
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:33,841
- Geez!
- What's the matter?

365
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:37,578
That dopey Sam,
he forgot to leave the keys.

366
00:26:37,652 --> 00:26:39,586
No. Oh, well.

367
00:26:39,654 --> 00:26:43,556
A lot of handicapped children
are gonna be very disappointed.

368
00:26:43,624 --> 00:26:45,717
Handicapped children?

369
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:49,285
This car was supposed to be auctioned
off at their charity drive tomorrow.

370
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:51,831
Oh, well. Let's go get
something to eat.

371
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:54,094
Maybe we should try
to open it ourselves.

372
00:26:56,103 --> 00:26:58,333
Do you really think
we should do that?

373
00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:00,067
lt's for children.

374
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:04,269
You got a point.

375
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:10,308
l saw a guy from
the Auto Club do this once.

376
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:13,012
What do you know,
beginners luck!

377
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:18,256
These cars have
terrific alarms!

378
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:20,760
l'll get it in a minute.

379
00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:24,256
Just a second, Jules.

380
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,266
Whoa!

381
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:29,894
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

382
00:27:40,214 --> 00:27:44,548
lf you lift the rear end at an angle
greater than 45 degrees...

383
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:47,587
the mercury switch activates
the automatic cut-off system,

384
00:27:47,655 --> 00:27:50,021
so that the alarm's
computer thinks...

385
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:52,423
that the car is being
towed and shuts off.

386
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:56,522
Can l have the keys
to your car?

387
00:27:58,032 --> 00:28:00,592
You know,
the keys to your car?

388
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:03,967
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No yodeling.

389
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,474
Lovely day.

390
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:11,908
Come on, Julius.

391
00:28:25,593 --> 00:28:28,562
Step on it!

392
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:31,793
Yeeeoow!

393
00:28:44,345 --> 00:28:46,279
Oh, my God!

394
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:49,646
- l am amazed at how well it's going.
- You're doing good.

395
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:52,345
Don't use both feet
at the same time.

396
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,413
- Just use the gas.
- Okay, one foot.

397
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,481
- One pedal at a time.
- Okay! l will do it!

398
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:20,545
Pick up the phone,
the phone.

399
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:23,515
The little thing down on
the right that's making noise.

400
00:29:29,924 --> 00:29:32,893
This is Vincent's car.
Can l help you, please?

401
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,588
- Julius!
- Vincent, where are you?

402
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:38,291
Look in your rear-view mirror.
You see that little dot?

403
00:29:38,365 --> 00:29:41,391
That's me.

404
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:43,266
Hello, yeah. Hello!

405
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:46,731
What are you
doing back there?

406
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:50,903
There's going to be a lot of
lights coming up, a supermarket.

407
00:29:50,978 --> 00:29:54,243
- Supermarket.
- Take your foot off the gas.

408
00:29:54,315 --> 00:29:57,807
Apply it to the brake.
lt's the thing next to the gas.

409
00:29:57,885 --> 00:29:58,817
The brake pedal.

410
00:29:58,886 --> 00:30:01,081
- Very gently.
- You got it.

411
00:30:02,156 --> 00:30:04,488
Bye, Vincent.

412
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:06,685
All right.

413
00:30:11,031 --> 00:30:13,090
Okay, it's a supermarket.

414
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:23,002
Ohhh!

415
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:24,976
Ohhh!

416
00:30:36,357 --> 00:30:38,882
That's what l call fun.

417
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:41,086
Did you see me
with the two wheels?

418
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:43,722
l can teach
you that, Vincent.

419
00:30:43,797 --> 00:30:46,288
Julius, let me tell you
something about America.

420
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:49,495
Nobody likes
a smart ass, all right?

421
00:30:49,603 --> 00:30:51,594
So, what do you think?

422
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:53,731
Angel's food
or devil's food?

423
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:55,741
Devil's.

424
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,300
- You know what
l really love about Vince?
- What?

425
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,109
He's a force of nature.

426
00:31:01,182 --> 00:31:03,047
- You're outta control.
- No, l'm not.

427
00:31:03,117 --> 00:31:05,881
That poetry he pretends to write,
they're old song lyrics.

428
00:31:05,953 --> 00:31:08,888
l know. Geez,
you think l don't know that!

429
00:31:08,956 --> 00:31:10,924
- l don't think you know that.
- Well, l do.

430
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:14,757
lt's this style thing.
That's how he expresses himself.

431
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:18,286
And he means it, even if
he doesn't know he means it.

432
00:31:18,365 --> 00:31:23,325
- Vince has a truly romantic soul.
- l can't hear this anymore.

433
00:31:23,404 --> 00:31:26,373
Well, don't, 'cause if you
had a boyfriend like l have,

434
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,874
you'd make him a cake
and he'd love it...

435
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:30,968
and you'd get laid.

436
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,457
- Ah!
- Excuse me.

437
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:50,326
Excuse me.

438
00:31:51,632 --> 00:31:53,623
She's not bad.

439
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:57,262
l had no idea
that these magazines...

440
00:31:57,338 --> 00:32:01,638
had things like
this inside, inside them.

441
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:04,542
You didn't? Where've you been?
A desert island?

442
00:32:04,612 --> 00:32:08,605
l come from a tropical island
in the South Pacific.

443
00:32:08,682 --> 00:32:12,413
lt's around 300 nautical miles,
south, southwest of Fiji.

444
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:16,988
l just got here yesterday
and l already found my brother.

445
00:32:17,057 --> 00:32:18,820
Your brother?

446
00:32:18,892 --> 00:32:20,917
That's right.

447
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:22,963
My twin brother, Vincent.

448
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,295
- Twins?
- Vince!

449
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:29,200
- Linda.
- Hi.

450
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,137
Oh, you look gorgeous
in this light.

451
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:34,299
- You do.
- Really?

452
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:41,971
Hi. Who's this guy?

453
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:43,983
This is Vincent's brother.

454
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:47,452
- l didn't know you had a brother.
- Me, either.

455
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:49,284
You know each other?

456
00:32:49,356 --> 00:32:51,950
Allow me to introduce
these lovely ladies.

457
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:55,894
- This is Linda.
- Hi.

458
00:32:55,963 --> 00:32:58,830
- Hello.
- Her charming sister, Marnie.

459
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:04,002
Sisters?

460
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:06,232
Twins?

461
00:33:06,307 --> 00:33:08,867
Are you sure
this guy's all right?

462
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:11,502
He's okay.
He's helping me out.

463
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:14,775
He's from outta town,
kinda latched on to me.

464
00:33:14,848 --> 00:33:17,749
Okay, well, great seeing ya.

465
00:33:17,818 --> 00:33:20,548
Catch ya later.

466
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:23,590
Great seeing ya.
Catch ya later.

467
00:33:23,657 --> 00:33:25,625
Oops!

468
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:32,222
l've only been
driving an hour.

469
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:37,969
- Linda's your girlfriend, isn't she?
- Yeah, kinda.

470
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:41,303
- ls Marnie your girlfriend, too?
- Marnie?

471
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:45,141
Marnie hates my guts.
She kinda likes you, though.

472
00:33:45,212 --> 00:33:47,476
- Me?
- Yeah.

473
00:33:47,548 --> 00:33:51,279
- She hardly knows me.
- That's the best way.

474
00:33:51,352 --> 00:33:53,877
You see,
women love men...

475
00:33:53,954 --> 00:33:56,286
who are mysterious
and devious.

476
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:58,325
Keeps them on their toes.

477
00:33:58,392 --> 00:34:01,623
-lt excites them. You know what l mean?
-No.

478
00:34:01,695 --> 00:34:04,391
- You do like women?
- Very much so.

479
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:06,433
They're strange
and sensitive.

480
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,900
They have compassion.

481
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:11,995
l have the highest
respect for women.

482
00:34:15,776 --> 00:34:18,574
You're a virgin!

483
00:34:21,815 --> 00:34:24,545
That's private.

484
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,984
A 230-pound virgin.

485
00:34:29,056 --> 00:34:32,184
lt's all right.
lt's something--

486
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:35,092
lt's just one
of those things.

487
00:34:35,162 --> 00:34:38,757
Oh, Julius.
My little baby poodle.

488
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:43,592
Such a baby cat.
Look, did l neglect you?

489
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,968
Not anymore. Come on.

490
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:49,133
That's a good little pussy cat.
This is sweet Julius.

491
00:34:49,209 --> 00:34:51,302
Okay, here you go.

492
00:34:51,378 --> 00:34:53,744
You named
your cat Julius?

493
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:04,156
The secret to take-out eggplant
parmesan is extra cheese.

494
00:35:04,224 --> 00:35:06,954
- There we go.
- That much cheese?

495
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:09,325
Oh, yeah.
The more cheese, the merrier.

496
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:11,364
There you go.

497
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:15,630
l know you're probably used to
growing your own vegetables...

498
00:35:15,702 --> 00:35:19,399
and spearing fish on the lagoon,
but here on the mainland,

499
00:35:19,473 --> 00:35:22,033
we just nuke it.

500
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:25,567
That's it. Here we go.

501
00:35:25,646 --> 00:35:30,413
Feast your eyes.
Dinner is served.

502
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:33,942
- Yummy.
- Yeah.

503
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:49,969
- Ahhh!
- Ahhh!

504
00:35:50,037 --> 00:35:52,335
Through the lips, over the gums,
look out--

505
00:35:52,406 --> 00:35:55,773
Look out stomach, here it comes.
Ta-dum!

506
00:35:55,843 --> 00:35:58,539
- Julius!
- Oh, l like nuked food.

507
00:35:58,612 --> 00:36:01,513
- Mm-mmm!
- Mmm!

508
00:36:26,106 --> 00:36:28,336
Now let me get
this straight.

509
00:36:28,408 --> 00:36:30,933
One of our fathers was
a famous football player?

510
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:32,945
- Yes!
- And another one was...

511
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:36,915
- a physicist at M.l.T.?
- Yes, he won the Nobel Prize.

512
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:40,317
Naturally! All of our dads
were these big shots.

513
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:42,412
And Mom...

514
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:45,481
was like... superwoman.

515
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,956
But she didn't survive
the delivery.

516
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:53,625
And l was sent
to an orphanage,

517
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,396
while you were raised
on a tropical paradise...

518
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,166
by a scientist who
you do research for,

519
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:02,299
but who doesn't pay you,
because you don't need money.

520
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:04,708
Did l leave anything out?

521
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:08,714
l think it's important we try
to find our fathers.

522
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:11,580
Oh, you mean the geniuses
who contributed...

523
00:37:11,652 --> 00:37:13,916
to the sperm milk shake.

524
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:16,387
Why are you being so immature
about all this?

525
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:19,425
Do you know how many times
l've heard stories like this?

526
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:22,155
lt's every
orphan's fantasy.

527
00:37:22,229 --> 00:37:24,663
My real mom and dad
were rich...

528
00:37:24,731 --> 00:37:26,756
and beautiful.

529
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:29,563
But there was a mix-up
in the hospital...

530
00:37:29,636 --> 00:37:32,605
and l got switched
with another baby.

531
00:37:32,673 --> 00:37:35,301
But one day, there's gonna
be a knock at the door...

532
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:37,400
and there they'll be...

533
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:42,107
with open arms,
crying, ''My darling.

534
00:37:42,182 --> 00:37:45,379
''My treasure.
We didn't know.

535
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:47,682
How can we make
it up to you?''

536
00:37:47,754 --> 00:37:50,382
Let me tell you something
for your own good, Julius.

537
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:52,456
lt's a crock.

538
00:37:54,892 --> 00:37:58,293
l liberated this from
my file at the orphanage.

539
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:03,124
Here it is.
Read it and weep.

540
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,658
''Dear Sister Anderson, your request
for orphan's benefits...

541
00:38:06,737 --> 00:38:09,729
- ''for Vincent Benedict has been denied.
- Denied, yeah.

542
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:14,073
''According to our files,
his mother did not die...

543
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:16,044
- ''during birth.
- She's not dead.

544
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:18,547
''We have a current
address for her at...

545
00:38:18,616 --> 00:38:20,675
''172 Canyon Glen Drive,
Los Angeles.

546
00:38:20,751 --> 00:38:23,618
''Vincent's case seems to be
one of simple abandonment,

547
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:26,588
and as such,
he's ineligible for aid.''

548
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:30,149
That's right, Julius.
She abandoned me.

549
00:38:34,164 --> 00:38:36,496
This letter was written
30 years ago.

550
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:39,001
We were five years old.

551
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:41,162
Our mother didn't die
when we were born!

552
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:43,798
You knew all this time
where she was...

553
00:38:43,874 --> 00:38:46,069
and you never
contacted her?

554
00:38:46,143 --> 00:38:50,637
l don't know about your mother,
''Miss Perfect, 1952,''

555
00:38:50,714 --> 00:38:53,979
but my mother was a slut
and if she's still alive,

556
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:56,076
l hope she's
in a lot of pain.

557
00:38:56,153 --> 00:38:58,087
She dumped me once.

558
00:38:58,155 --> 00:39:00,680
There is no way l'm gonna give
her a chance to do it again.

559
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:03,693
lf they have lied to us about Mama
for all these years,

560
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:06,958
maybe they lied to her, too.
We got to find her.

561
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:09,727
- We have to check this address.
- You do what you want.

562
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,859
l got a cash-flow problem.

563
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:15,667
- Hello.
- Hey, Vince, we haven't
forgotten about you.

564
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:18,173
You better have our money
tomorrow morning, or else.

565
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:20,540
Or else what, you blimp?

566
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:34,183
Oh, we're rollin'.

567
00:39:34,258 --> 00:39:37,159
Tests on the new low-temperature
gaskets look great.

568
00:39:37,227 --> 00:39:39,161
- Mr. Garfield, there's a man--
- Not now.

569
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:49,469
- Who are you?
- l'm Webster.

570
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:54,669
- lt's okay!
- Christ! You were never
supposed to come here.

571
00:39:54,745 --> 00:39:56,872
We were never
supposed to meet.

572
00:39:56,947 --> 00:40:00,246
- You're supposed to be--
- Driving that car down to Texas.

573
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:03,809
l got my driving gloves.
l got my driving glasses.

574
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:05,787
l got my driving hat.

575
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:08,381
But l got no car.

576
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:11,292
The car was there.
The merchandise was in the trunk.

577
00:40:11,362 --> 00:40:13,455
Your instructions
were on the cassette.

578
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,363
He wants more money.
That's what this is about.

579
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:20,130
- He wants more money.
- Whoa, whoa. Let me explain.

580
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:21,694
Sit down.

581
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,609
l got a reputation
to uphold.

582
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:29,339
People put their trust in me.

583
00:40:29,413 --> 00:40:31,404
They know l always
deliver the goods...

584
00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:33,882
and l always come
back with the money.

585
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:36,647
This is making me look
very bad professionally.

586
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,212
- This is bullshit. The car was there.
- That's right.

587
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,918
The parking attendant
thought we were going to Hawaii.

588
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:45,427
- The parking attendant?
- He liked the car.

589
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:47,964
We put on those loud shirts
so we'd look like tourists.

590
00:40:48,032 --> 00:40:51,627
You know,
l just realized that...

591
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:54,637
in over 20 years of service,
not one of my clients...

592
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:56,639
has ever seen my face.

593
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:59,505
l don't think that's
a problem. Hey!

594
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:03,104
No, please, please!

595
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:25,467
- Hi.
- Hi.

596
00:41:25,536 --> 00:41:30,200
- Oh, excuse me, could you
tell me who lives here?
- Grandpa,

597
00:41:30,274 --> 00:41:32,640
this man wants
to talk to you.

598
00:41:32,709 --> 00:41:35,803
Thank you.

599
00:41:38,649 --> 00:41:40,617
Hello?

600
00:41:40,684 --> 00:41:42,652
Yes, can l help you?

601
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:44,812
l'm terribly sorry
to disturb your party.

602
00:41:44,888 --> 00:41:46,822
l know this may
sound strange,

603
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:50,257
but l'm looking for someone
that lived here a long time ago.

604
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:53,296
Mary Ann Benedict.

605
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:01,101
She was my mother.

606
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:07,342
You're Mary Ann's son?

607
00:42:07,411 --> 00:42:12,280
That looks just
like you, Grandpa.

608
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:14,544
Honey, why don't
you go inside...

609
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:17,485
and help Grandma
with lunch, okay?

610
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,959
Dad?

611
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:34,970
Uh... no!

612
00:42:35,038 --> 00:42:39,168
- But maybe technically speaking.
- Dad!

613
00:42:39,243 --> 00:42:41,336
Dad!

614
00:42:41,411 --> 00:42:43,743
- Wait a minute!
- Dad! lt is you!

615
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:45,941
This is a big surprise.

616
00:42:46,016 --> 00:42:48,314
Dad, this is incredible.
l don't know what to--

617
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:50,819
We could use a drink.
Where'd you come from?

618
00:42:50,888 --> 00:42:53,789
One of my fathers! You don't know
what this means to me.

619
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:14,738
Uh, Mr. Webster, l hope you are
happy with the vehicle...

620
00:43:14,811 --> 00:43:18,303
we chose for
your little journey.

621
00:43:18,382 --> 00:43:22,478
When you get near Houston,
phone 713-555-0342...

622
00:43:22,553 --> 00:43:26,182
and ask for uh, uh,
Beetroot McKinley.

623
00:43:26,256 --> 00:43:30,215
He will arrange to trade you a briefcase
for the merchandise in the trunk.

624
00:43:30,294 --> 00:43:32,319
Thank you.

625
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:35,365
Mary Ann Benedict.

626
00:43:35,432 --> 00:43:40,096
l haven't said that name
out loud for over 30 years.

627
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,798
Your mother was...

628
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:45,239
an amazing woman.

629
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:49,837
Oh, the times l've wondered what would
have happened if l'd have married her.

630
00:43:49,913 --> 00:43:52,245
Why didn't you?

631
00:43:52,316 --> 00:43:56,047
Oh, l asked her to.
She turned me down.

632
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:59,782
She said she was afraid...

633
00:43:59,856 --> 00:44:02,416
to have any more children.

634
00:44:02,492 --> 00:44:05,484
See, they told her
you had died at birth.

635
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:08,224
Who told her we died?

636
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,300
Mitchell Traven,
the guy with the clipboard.

637
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:18,398
He supervised the experiment
for the government.

638
00:44:18,475 --> 00:44:22,844
He still runs a genetics lab
at Los Alamos, New Mexico.

639
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:25,245
l'll have to pay
him a visit.

640
00:44:25,315 --> 00:44:27,545
Watch out for him.

641
00:44:27,618 --> 00:44:31,349
He's kind of a dickhead,
if you know what l mean.

642
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:35,118
Dickhead?

643
00:44:35,192 --> 00:44:37,717
No, l don't.

644
00:44:37,794 --> 00:44:41,025
But... l'm learning.

645
00:44:46,236 --> 00:44:49,000
l'm concerned about the time frame.

646
00:44:49,072 --> 00:44:51,939
That's my private line, honey.
l'll take care of that.

647
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:54,443
You boys, excuse me.

648
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:03,215
Beetroot McKinley talkin'.
Who is this?

649
00:45:05,222 --> 00:45:07,156
Uh, Webster.

650
00:45:07,224 --> 00:45:11,217
l'm callin' from California.
l happen to have something--

651
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:14,890
Some merchandise
that you might want.

652
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:17,695
Well, bring it to me, son.

653
00:45:17,768 --> 00:45:19,759
Let me enrich you.

654
00:45:19,836 --> 00:45:22,202
Well, uh, Mr. Beetroot,

655
00:45:22,272 --> 00:45:24,536
it's the amount
of enrichment...

656
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:26,803
that l wanted
to talk about.

657
00:45:26,877 --> 00:45:30,472
Don't try and renegotiate
with old Beetroot, son.

658
00:45:30,547 --> 00:45:33,038
Now look, Beetroot,

659
00:45:33,116 --> 00:45:36,347
if we can't renegotiate,
we wither and die.

660
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,980
Look, there's no way,
Mr. Beetroot,

661
00:45:39,056 --> 00:45:42,787
that l am going to deliver
any damn Cadillac...

662
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:47,455
unless l know for sure
that l have...

663
00:45:47,531 --> 00:45:49,965
twenty for my cut.

664
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:53,196
Twenty! You little
shit-for-brains peckerwood!

665
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,261
You're out of your
goddamn, greedy mind!

666
00:45:55,339 --> 00:46:00,038
- l guess that seems
a little high for you.
- Yeah!

667
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:05,570
l'm a reasonable man.
How about fifteen?

668
00:46:05,649 --> 00:46:10,143
- The deal is five!
- Five?

669
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,415
l could do better
than five here.

670
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:18,284
lf you can do better
than five million dollars,

671
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:21,820
well, then, son,
you take it.

672
00:46:36,113 --> 00:46:39,549
Beetroot,
l'll see you in Houston.

673
00:46:39,616 --> 00:46:41,777
After all, fair is fair.

674
00:46:41,852 --> 00:46:45,720
l'll just have to find it in
my heart to live with your offer.

675
00:46:45,789 --> 00:46:49,054
Well, good.

676
00:46:59,002 --> 00:47:01,197
Five million!

677
00:47:01,271 --> 00:47:03,501
Five million dollars!

678
00:47:03,573 --> 00:47:05,803
Five mil-l-lion dollars!

679
00:47:05,876 --> 00:47:07,969
Five million dollars!

680
00:47:08,044 --> 00:47:11,411
Five, five million dollars!

681
00:47:11,481 --> 00:47:14,348
Five million dollars!

682
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:17,683
Five m-m-million!

683
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:22,824
Cash, lots of cash.

684
00:47:22,893 --> 00:47:25,123
Whoa!

685
00:47:25,195 --> 00:47:28,995
Listen, the most amazing thing
has happened, Vincent.

686
00:47:29,065 --> 00:47:33,092
- You scared the living shit outta me.
- l met one of our fathers.

687
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,331
He told me about
a man in New Mexico...

688
00:47:35,405 --> 00:47:38,841
- who probably knows where Mom is.
- Oh, great! Yes!

689
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:41,377
- Listen, she didn't abandon you.
- No?

690
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:44,039
You know what l mean?
She didn't abandon you.

691
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:46,139
- She didn't even know you were born.
- Oh!

692
00:47:46,216 --> 00:47:49,549
- They told her that l died.
- No kidding?

693
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,349
Look, Julius,
l'm in a hurry.

694
00:47:52,422 --> 00:47:55,823
- You know Sammy, who gave me this car?
- Yeah.

695
00:47:55,892 --> 00:47:59,055
You remember Sammy? He wants me
to take this car to Houston.

696
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:02,462
- So l'm gonna be gone a couple of days.
- Houston?

697
00:48:02,532 --> 00:48:03,521
Hous--

698
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,626
- Hou-- No!
- You know something?

699
00:48:06,703 --> 00:48:09,695
New Mexico's on
the way to Houston.

700
00:48:09,773 --> 00:48:13,937
A lot of places are
on the way to Houston.

701
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:16,911
Use the house,
make some phone calls.

702
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,006
Throw wild parties.
Take advantage of your brother.

703
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:23,109
We have to see this man, Traven,
in New Mexico.

704
00:48:23,186 --> 00:48:26,178
- No, we don't have to see
this man in New Mexico.
- Yes, we do!

705
00:48:26,256 --> 00:48:29,248
And l'm coming with you.

706
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:37,190
We'll go see the man.

707
00:48:37,267 --> 00:48:40,464
- l take a shower. l get my bags.
- Get your bags.

708
00:48:40,537 --> 00:48:42,903
Be right out. Oh, boy!

709
00:48:42,973 --> 00:48:46,136
l'll be here, bro.
Okay.

710
00:48:53,984 --> 00:48:56,179
This place is a zoo!

711
00:48:56,253 --> 00:48:59,552
Wait, wait.

712
00:49:01,424 --> 00:49:04,052
- Happy birthday, Vince.
- Oh.

713
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:08,029
- Happy birthday, Vince.
- God.

714
00:49:08,098 --> 00:49:12,000
- lt's not my birthday.
Better late than never.
- Oh.

715
00:49:12,068 --> 00:49:15,164
Look what Marnie
made for Julius.

716
00:49:15,298 --> 00:49:17,994
- You baked?
- Yeah. ls Julius around?

717
00:49:18,067 --> 00:49:22,834
- He's taking a shower.
- l'll go give these to him.

718
00:49:22,905 --> 00:49:24,270
So-o-o!

719
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,037
- Where'd you get this car?
- Sammy. You know Sammy.

720
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:32,308
- Where you going?
- lnside. Have some coffee?

721
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:36,374
You're going somewhere and you
weren't even gonna say good-bye.

722
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:39,012
Take out your papers and your trash

723
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:42,114
Or you don't get
no spending cash

724
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:45,024
lf you don't scrub
the kitchen floor

725
00:49:45,094 --> 00:49:47,221
You ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

726
00:49:47,296 --> 00:49:49,890
Yakety-yak yakety-yak
Don't talk back

727
00:49:49,966 --> 00:49:51,558
Marnie!

728
00:49:52,969 --> 00:49:56,803
Excuse me, but l was
just taking a shower.

729
00:49:56,872 --> 00:49:58,806
Good singing.

730
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:01,240
l baked you some cookies.

731
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:04,279
- Cookies?
- l guess it was a dumb idea.

732
00:50:04,347 --> 00:50:08,545
No, not at all. l'm really
looking forward to tossing them.

733
00:50:12,622 --> 00:50:15,523
- l should put on some clothes.
- l'm sorry, l'll turn around.

734
00:50:15,591 --> 00:50:18,890
Linda and l just came by
'cause she baked him a cake...

735
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:21,828
- for his birthday.
- l had birthday, too.

736
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:23,956
Oh, that's right.

737
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:27,161
You're twins.

738
00:50:31,874 --> 00:50:33,933
Huh?

739
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,978
Whoa.

740
00:50:36,045 --> 00:50:39,640
What is it?

741
00:50:39,715 --> 00:50:42,707
l don't know what it is,
but it's worth a fortune.

742
00:50:42,785 --> 00:50:45,345
- A fortune? That's great!
- Yeah!

743
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:47,355
Excuse me!

744
00:50:48,691 --> 00:50:50,488
Excuse me.

745
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,959
Never sleep with that man,
never loan him money,

746
00:50:53,029 --> 00:50:57,193
never believe a word he
tells you. That's free advice.

747
00:50:57,266 --> 00:51:01,362
- Good morning, Agnes.
- Vince?

748
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:04,668
l cleaned her pipes once.
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

749
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,107
Vincent,
l'm comin' with you.

750
00:51:08,177 --> 00:51:10,441
Linda, no,
you're not coming with me.

751
00:51:10,513 --> 00:51:12,674
- Yes, l am.
- No, you're not coming.

752
00:51:12,748 --> 00:51:16,149
You could get killed and die and
l wouldn't know what happened.

753
00:51:16,218 --> 00:51:18,584
- No!
- You say ''no'' one more time,

754
00:51:18,654 --> 00:51:22,420
-l'm gonna tell everybody that there's--
-Shut up! Shut up!

755
00:51:26,262 --> 00:51:28,992
All right. Oh, God.

756
00:51:29,065 --> 00:51:31,226
All right, you're coming.

757
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:35,498
But you do not tell Julius
what's in that trunk.

758
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:38,062
He thinks we're going
to look up our ancestors...

759
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,370
like in ''Roots'' or something.
All right?

760
00:51:40,443 --> 00:51:42,604
- Does this one look okay?
- lt looks fine.

761
00:51:42,678 --> 00:51:46,170
lt's good you didn't have
to borrow his pants.

762
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:49,775
- Marnie, guess what?
- Linda, what?

763
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:52,844
Vince just asked us to go to New Mexico
and Texas with him.

764
00:51:52,922 --> 00:51:55,288
This is a great idea.

765
00:51:55,357 --> 00:51:59,020
- Vincent, is this true?
We all go together?
- Yeah.

766
00:51:59,095 --> 00:52:02,462
l thought it was a great idea
if we all hopped in the car...

767
00:52:02,531 --> 00:52:04,465
and spent a few days
on the road together.

768
00:52:04,533 --> 00:52:06,660
Nice shirt.

769
00:52:06,736 --> 00:52:11,935
- Feels great. lt's all cotton.
- Well, it breathes.

770
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:15,935
lt's okay. Come out.

771
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:18,775
All right. Here, Linda.

772
00:52:18,848 --> 00:52:22,249
Oh, can l ride
in front with Vincent?

773
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:24,479
- Sure.
- Thanks.

774
00:52:40,302 --> 00:52:42,395
Now, let me see.

775
00:52:42,471 --> 00:52:44,939
l'm supposed to be
giving you one of these.

776
00:52:45,007 --> 00:52:47,168
Sorry, it's my first day
on the job.

777
00:52:47,243 --> 00:52:49,973
Have a nice day.

778
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:57,314
Now, where do l find
this very special person,

779
00:52:57,386 --> 00:53:01,049
Mr. Vince Benedict?

780
00:53:29,618 --> 00:53:32,610
Well, what have we here?

781
00:53:32,688 --> 00:53:35,452
What a cute little kitty.

782
00:53:35,524 --> 00:53:37,685
Where's Daddy?

783
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:51,664
Well, well, well.
Thank you very much.

784
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,799
Open up, Vince.
We know you're in there.

785
00:53:53,876 --> 00:53:56,436
Come on, we just
wanna talk to you.

786
00:53:56,512 --> 00:53:59,504
Howdy!

787
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:04,713
Who are you?

788
00:54:04,787 --> 00:54:06,721
lt's not really
important, is it?

789
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:08,780
l was just feeding the cat,
then l was gonna leave.

790
00:54:08,858 --> 00:54:10,758
l asked you a question.

791
00:54:10,826 --> 00:54:14,023
- Well, who are you?
- We're the Klane brothers.

792
00:54:14,096 --> 00:54:16,291
That's Burt, this is
Morris, and l'm Bob.

793
00:54:16,365 --> 00:54:20,825
- lnteresting gene pool.
- Don't cast dispersions.

794
00:54:20,903 --> 00:54:23,895
l beg your pardon. But you're
looking for Vince Benedict.

795
00:54:23,973 --> 00:54:26,237
- Right.
- Am l Vince Benedict?

796
00:54:27,776 --> 00:54:29,710
So what difference
does it make who l am?

797
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:32,906
- Hit him, Bobby.
- Yeah.

798
00:54:32,982 --> 00:54:34,813
Hey! All right.

799
00:54:34,884 --> 00:54:36,875
Your brothers seem to have
a problem with their feet.

800
00:54:36,952 --> 00:54:40,410
- Could be contagious. Bye, bye.
- Ow! Ow!

801
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:45,392
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

802
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,796
- You want a doctor?
- Ow!

803
00:54:50,866 --> 00:54:53,835
l'll call a doctor.

804
00:55:41,984 --> 00:55:45,715
Sorry l tore your shirt.
l don't know what happened.

805
00:55:45,788 --> 00:55:47,756
lt's all right.

806
00:55:47,823 --> 00:55:49,757
- Julius!
- What?

807
00:55:49,825 --> 00:55:53,192
- Are you allergic to something?
- No.

808
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:56,231
Then why are these bumps
all over your body?

809
00:55:56,298 --> 00:55:59,597
You're all swelled up.
You look like you're ready to explode.

810
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:03,604
Put this shirt on. There are
women and children present.

811
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:06,664
And your back,
it's worse than the front.

812
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:10,405
- lt's like North Dakota.
- You're so funny, Vincent.

813
00:56:12,514 --> 00:56:14,607
This is for the T-shirt
and the sandwiches.

814
00:56:17,019 --> 00:56:21,285
- Born to be bad.
- Yes, we are.

815
00:56:21,357 --> 00:56:23,689
Ooh, you're so scary.

816
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:25,920
Linda.

817
00:56:25,995 --> 00:56:28,463
Linda!

818
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,794
Well, what do you think?

819
00:56:30,866 --> 00:56:36,099
- Let's rock and roll.
- lt's his first T-shirt.

820
00:56:54,523 --> 00:56:56,582
- Honey, honey.
- Yeah?

821
00:56:56,658 --> 00:57:00,150
See if you can get us
a room with a king-size bed?

822
00:57:00,229 --> 00:57:03,221
- Right.
- We'll get us settled.
We'll meet you here.

823
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:07,029
- Okay.
- Good-bye.

824
00:57:07,102 --> 00:57:10,799
l don't need a king-size bed.
l always sleep on the floor.

825
00:57:10,939 --> 00:57:15,308
Uh, l don't know, Jules.
l hope this is a good idea.

826
00:57:15,377 --> 00:57:18,904
Come on.

827
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:22,109
Now, look,
promise me something.

828
00:57:22,184 --> 00:57:26,621
lf this Professor Traven
has never heard of,

829
00:57:26,688 --> 00:57:29,248
you know,
Mom or us twins...

830
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:32,191
or all our dads
or the experiment,

831
00:57:32,261 --> 00:57:34,456
you won't be upset.

832
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,465
All l want him to do
is tell us the truth.

833
00:57:37,533 --> 00:57:40,400
l don't know who you are
and what you're talking about.

834
00:57:40,469 --> 00:57:44,371
Get the hell out of here
before l call security.

835
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,139
Well, that's that.
On to Houston.

836
00:57:49,211 --> 00:57:53,079
- He's lying!
- Take it easy. He said
he was gonna call security.

837
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:56,777
For the first time in my life,
l'm pissed off!

838
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:58,843
Julius, don't do this to me.
l got a car to deliver.

839
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:01,253
The last thing l need is
a detour in the slammer.

840
00:58:01,323 --> 00:58:04,053
- l'm gonna make him tell us the truth.
- No!

841
00:58:06,995 --> 00:58:09,657
That's our mother.
Those are our six fathers.

842
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:12,666
That's Werner.
And that is you.

843
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:17,569
- So start talking.
- Everything okay, Dr. Traven?

844
00:58:19,942 --> 00:58:22,433
Um, yes. lt's okay.

845
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:24,741
l'll take care of it.

846
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:31,816
Well, Vincent,

847
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:35,682
you turned out just like
l thought you would.

848
00:58:35,757 --> 00:58:37,691
What did you do,
escape from prison?

849
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:44,960
How'd you know my name?

850
00:58:47,102 --> 00:58:49,036
l named you.

851
00:59:03,252 --> 00:59:07,279
We sealed this door
the day after you were born.

852
00:59:22,905 --> 00:59:26,238
Well, come on in.
This is what you wanted to see.

853
00:59:40,589 --> 00:59:44,252
You came out first,
of course.

854
00:59:44,326 --> 00:59:46,260
We weren't expecting...

855
00:59:46,328 --> 00:59:47,852
him.

856
00:59:49,264 --> 00:59:52,597
This, uh...

857
00:59:52,668 --> 00:59:55,034
must be where you
made the milk shake.

858
00:59:55,103 --> 00:59:58,163
We weren't
making milk shakes.

859
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,074
We were making the most fully-developed
human the world has ever seen.

860
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:05,773
But instead of just
one perfect kid,

861
01:00:05,847 --> 01:00:10,250
-Mom had the two of us. Way to go, Mom!
-Wrong!

862
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,777
The embryo did split
in two, but...

863
01:00:13,855 --> 01:00:16,323
it didn't split equally.

864
01:00:16,391 --> 01:00:20,623
All the purity and
strength went into Julius.

865
01:00:20,696 --> 01:00:22,664
All the crap
that was left over...

866
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:25,291
went into what you see
in the mirror every morning.

867
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:27,426
Whoa. You telling me
l'm the crap?

868
01:00:27,502 --> 01:00:30,335
- This is not true.
- Wait, Julius.

869
01:00:30,405 --> 01:00:34,136
You're telling me that l am
the leftover crap? l'm no good?

870
01:00:34,209 --> 01:00:37,235
- He's wrong.
- Look at him.

871
01:00:39,715 --> 01:00:44,175
Are you saying that
l'm a side effect?

872
01:00:44,253 --> 01:00:47,313
You haven't got the brain power
to understand this...

873
01:00:47,389 --> 01:00:50,950
and l haven't got the time.
Show's over.

874
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:56,354
Hey, dickhead.

875
01:00:56,431 --> 01:00:59,059
Tell us where
our mother is.

876
01:00:59,134 --> 01:01:02,160
Um... Whispering Pines.

877
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:05,729
lt's an artists' colony
200 miles north of Santa Fe.

878
01:01:09,911 --> 01:01:14,245
lf you're lying to me,
l'll be back.

879
01:01:25,193 --> 01:01:27,320
Come on.

880
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,762
My life just got
flushed down the toilet.

881
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:50,567
No, Vincent. Your life
is just about to begin.

882
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:53,335
l'm genetic garbage.

883
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:57,243
We're twins.
We're basically the same.

884
01:01:57,313 --> 01:02:01,147
Julius, l know this is
a touchy subject for you,

885
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,845
but we don't look the same,
we don't act the same,

886
01:02:03,919 --> 01:02:07,047
- we don't talk the same,
we don't dress the same.
- l know.

887
01:02:07,122 --> 01:02:10,523
So if we're so much the same,
how come we're so different?

888
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:13,061
We had six fathers.

889
01:02:13,128 --> 01:02:15,961
We're different parts of
a lot of different people.

890
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:18,591
Yeah?

891
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:22,763
Don't forget. l was taken
to a beautiful island.

892
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:25,705
l was loved. l was
protected, educated.

893
01:02:25,774 --> 01:02:29,039
You had nobody, Vincent.

894
01:02:29,111 --> 01:02:32,842
Nobody to love you,
to trust you, to encourage you.

895
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,850
All life taught you was
that the only person you...

896
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,978
could count on was yourself.

897
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,296
You see, Vincent,

898
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:51,925
you're the missing part
of my life.

899
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:55,095
And l'm the missing part
of your life.

900
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:57,331
When we find Mama,

901
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,897
we can fill the
missing part of hers.

902
01:03:02,711 --> 01:03:05,680
We won't be alone anymore.

903
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:09,377
We can be a family.

904
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:17,484
A family?

905
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:19,493
Yes.

906
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:24,392
You mean, like,
with a Christmas tree,

907
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:26,627
and Thanksgiving dinner?

908
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,670
And a real home,

909
01:03:28,737 --> 01:03:33,106
where you'll
always be welcome.

910
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:35,336
Always?

911
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:39,404
Even when you've been bad.

912
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:48,715
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

913
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:50,782
Yeah, yeah, ooh.

914
01:03:50,859 --> 01:03:53,987
Yes, um-mm. Oh, look.

915
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:57,294
- ls this really necessary?
- Yes, of course it's necessary.

916
01:03:57,366 --> 01:04:00,893
l'm not going to introduce
you to my mother looking
like a goat herder from Albania.

917
01:04:00,969 --> 01:04:02,937
You need clothes.

918
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,769
- But l feel fine the way l am.
- But you look like a--

919
01:04:05,841 --> 01:04:09,140
- Hello, can l help you?
- Do l look like l need help?

920
01:04:09,211 --> 01:04:12,271
Here's the problem.
We gotta do a whole ensemble.

921
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:27,058
-Do l look okay?
-You look better. Let's put it that way.

922
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:29,097
You know what
we have to do, Jules?

923
01:04:29,164 --> 01:04:31,462
We gotta work on the way
you're walking.

924
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:35,196
You look a little stiff.
You ever see ''Frankenstein''?

925
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,795
- l read the book.
- That's not gonna help.

926
01:04:37,873 --> 01:04:42,276
When you walk, you gotta walk
like you're moving to music,

927
01:04:42,344 --> 01:04:44,278
and l don't mean
a military march.

928
01:04:44,346 --> 01:04:47,247
Like, you know, Aretha Franklin
and Otis Redding...

929
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,841
and Wilson Pickett,
a couple of white people.

930
01:04:49,918 --> 01:04:52,352
- Like this?
- Yeah. Bop! That's it.

931
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:55,254
- Yeah, loose!
- Oh, l like that.

932
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:58,384
l got something for you.
Try these on.

933
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:01,759
- Sunglasses?
- Yeah, here you go.

934
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,234
Now, that's it.
There. Yeah!

935
01:05:07,302 --> 01:05:10,362
That's it. Yeah!

936
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:12,373
- Whoops!
- Whoa!

937
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:16,537
- Do l look cool now?
- Mr. lce.

938
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:19,672
Yeah, just breeze
on through. Yeah!

939
01:05:19,748 --> 01:05:23,377
Tonight

940
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,420
Tonight's the night

941
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:27,955
lt's gonna be
a good night, bro

942
01:05:28,023 --> 01:05:30,856
And everything's gonna
happen, bro

943
01:05:30,926 --> 01:05:33,053
And you take her
in your arms

944
01:05:33,128 --> 01:05:35,790
And you plant a good
one on her... ho

945
01:05:35,864 --> 01:05:37,798
Tonight's the night

946
01:05:37,866 --> 01:05:39,800
Tonight, tonight, tonight

947
01:05:39,868 --> 01:05:41,802
Tonight is your night, bro

948
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:43,861
Tonight is your night, bro

949
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:46,772
Tonight is your night, bro

950
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:49,310
Yeah, it's your night, bro!

951
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,346
Oh yeah, bro
You're gonna do it

952
01:05:51,413 --> 01:05:53,438
You're gonna cut it

953
01:05:53,515 --> 01:05:55,745
You're making me nervous!

954
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:58,082
- Well, you're nervous.
- You've got to help me.

955
01:05:58,153 --> 01:06:00,212
- What?
- l've never been out on a date before.

956
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,450
- That's okay.
- l don't know what to do.

957
01:06:02,524 --> 01:06:05,982
Well, you talk to her.
You buy her a couple of drinks.

958
01:06:06,061 --> 01:06:07,995
You dance with her, bro

959
01:06:08,063 --> 01:06:11,794
You gonna dance with

960
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:13,732
You dance?

961
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:22,175
- Oh, you probably never
did that before, either.
- No.

962
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:24,178
Oh, well, look.

963
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,214
All right.

964
01:06:26,281 --> 01:06:29,250
The first thing is,
Jules,

965
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,479
forget about disco.

966
01:06:31,553 --> 01:06:34,454
- Right? No disco.
- No disco.

967
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:38,084
When l really wanna
romance a girl...

968
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,390
l waltz with her.

969
01:06:40,462 --> 01:06:43,989
Rah-tah-tah
Rah-tah-tah

970
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:46,398
- You mean, like Strauss?
- Yeah.

971
01:06:46,468 --> 01:06:49,437
lt turns 'em into
putty in your hands.

972
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,735
Rump-bump-bum
Diddilly-ump-bump

973
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:56,039
Rump-bump-bum, Rump-bump-bum
Rump-bump-bum

974
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:58,739
Come on, let's assume
the dance position.

975
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,941
l'll give you
a couple of pointers.

976
01:07:01,016 --> 01:07:03,109
- l really appreciate that.
- Come on. Let's go.

977
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,380
l hope nobody's
looking in the window.

978
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,422
Come on, like this.
Here you go.

979
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:11,152
Put your feet by my feet.
Come on. Let's go.

980
01:07:12,227 --> 01:07:14,821
By my feet...

981
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:17,092
not on my feet.
Thanks very much.

982
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:19,929
- Sorry, Vincent.
- Minor oversight.

983
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:22,163
Grab my hand.
Come on.

984
01:07:22,237 --> 01:07:25,502
Yeow! Ah! Ease up!

985
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:29,442
- Tiny bit. Let the blood
flow through the fingers.
- Oh, like loose?

986
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:31,843
- See, come on. That's it, relax.
- l'm just nervous.

987
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:35,213
Okay, one, two, three.
One, two, three.

988
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:37,752
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

989
01:07:37,819 --> 01:07:39,787
- One, two, three.
- Don't, no.

990
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:41,880
-One, two, three.
-See what you're doing with your teeth?

991
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,949
You're grinding them.
Don't grind your teeth.

992
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:47,655
Don't grind your teeth.

993
01:07:47,729 --> 01:07:50,095
Relax your jaws, yeah.

994
01:07:50,165 --> 01:07:54,101
Now try to count without
moving your lips, all right?

995
01:07:54,169 --> 01:07:57,730
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

996
01:07:57,806 --> 01:08:00,366
See? That's it.
You're not wrestling a boar...

997
01:08:00,442 --> 01:08:03,775
300 miles south,
southwest of Fiji.

998
01:08:03,845 --> 01:08:09,477
lf l die for this dance

999
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:11,712
Hold you and talk of

1000
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:14,847
Romance

1001
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:17,414
l've never been lucky

1002
01:08:17,492 --> 01:08:21,656
l've got to take a chance

1003
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:26,929
l'm caught up
in some kind of trance

1004
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:32,030
And yes l would die
for this dance

1005
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,605
Where did you come from

1006
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,079
Out of nowhere it seems

1007
01:08:40,148 --> 01:08:43,242
- May be an angel
- Good, Jules.

1008
01:08:43,318 --> 01:08:46,344
Smiling on me

1009
01:08:46,421 --> 01:08:48,389
l know it's crazy

1010
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:51,051
You've taken my heart

1011
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:53,526
l'll never leave you

1012
01:08:53,595 --> 01:08:55,825
You're my missing part

1013
01:08:55,897 --> 01:09:00,891
Yes l'd die for this dance

1014
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:07,807
Hold you and
talk of romance

1015
01:09:07,876 --> 01:09:13,746
l've never been lucky
l've got to take a chance

1016
01:09:13,815 --> 01:09:16,943
Yeah!

1017
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:20,716
l'm caught up in
some kind of trance

1018
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:26,921
Yes l would die
for this dance

1019
01:09:44,646 --> 01:09:46,614
Way to go, Jules!

1020
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,673
Ahhh!

1021
01:09:51,019 --> 01:09:53,487
Did you know they had beer
in Ancient Egypt?

1022
01:09:53,555 --> 01:09:55,546
- Oh, yeah?
- No.

1023
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:59,754
lt was actually the Assyrians
that developed the beer.

1024
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:03,730
The Egyptians were the first
to perfect the malt process.

1025
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:08,327
- You know a lot about beer.
- He knows about everything.

1026
01:10:08,403 --> 01:10:11,133
lt's all from books.
Until tonight, l've never had a beer.

1027
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:16,307
All theory, no practice.
The story of my life.

1028
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:20,974
- Awww!
- We're gonna change all that.

1029
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:22,983
Aren't we, Marnie?

1030
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:26,278
- Marnie.
- What?

1031
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:28,788
Am l shit-faced yet?

1032
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:35,590
Excuse me, but...
my back teeth are floating.

1033
01:10:37,799 --> 01:10:42,293
Excuse me, l have to check if
my back teeth are floating.

1034
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,270
Good shot.

1035
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:50,472
Woo-hoo! Ooo!

1036
01:10:52,013 --> 01:10:56,814
Oh, God. We both flushed at
the same time before we did it.

1037
01:10:58,553 --> 01:11:01,954
Yeah, right. Woo-hoo!

1038
01:11:02,023 --> 01:11:05,083
Hey, Jules. Marnie's
got the hots for you, babe.

1039
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,151
Tonight is your lucky night.
l know it.

1040
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:11,222
- l don't think Marnie likes me.
- You kidding? Piece of cake.

1041
01:11:11,299 --> 01:11:14,200
This woman is ripe.
You're nervous...

1042
01:11:14,269 --> 01:11:16,669
because it's your first time.
Perfectly natural.

1043
01:11:19,107 --> 01:11:21,041
Really.

1044
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:27,573
Were you nervous
the first time?

1045
01:11:29,484 --> 01:11:33,215
l was 12 years old and she was
a nun. Talk about pressure.

1046
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:36,757
Whoa!

1047
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,759
Come on, hit 'em.

1048
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:40,761
- What?
- Hit 'em, hit 'em.

1049
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,229
Oh, hit 'em,
hit 'em.

1050
01:11:43,298 --> 01:11:45,323
Julius...

1051
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,131
you know...

1052
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:52,867
Julius, l have
to admit this.

1053
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:56,172
Since you and l
first met, uh,

1054
01:11:56,244 --> 01:11:58,576
my life has been just
getting better and better.

1055
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:02,048
Mine, too.

1056
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:04,051
l'm so happy, Vincent.

1057
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:06,519
l feel like
sometimes, like...

1058
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:09,022
- picking you up and hug you...
- Whoa!

1059
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:11,183
and hug you,
hug you, hug you.

1060
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,531
Hey, he's my brother.

1061
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:19,658
Oh, lay off
the beer, Julius.

1062
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:32,505
Did you tell anyone
we were coming to Santa Fe?

1063
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:35,345
l called work and told them
we wouldn't be in for a few days.

1064
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,714
Oh, l forgot to tell you
we were fired.

1065
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:43,053
- Oh, no.
- You hated that job.

1066
01:12:43,124 --> 01:12:45,991
- Nice of your boss to tell us
where we could find you.
- Oh, no.

1067
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:51,499
Hi, girls, you don't mind if
we join you and listen to some music.

1068
01:12:53,134 --> 01:12:58,162
The Klane boys.
What an unpleasant surprise.

1069
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,767
Vince, this has
gone way beyond...

1070
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:05,127
- a case of simple loan delinquency.
- We don't like being shot.

1071
01:13:05,261 --> 01:13:08,230
Shot? Who shot you?

1072
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:10,788
- What do you want?
- We want to take Vince...

1073
01:13:10,866 --> 01:13:14,700
- out to the parking lot and kill him.
- Ohhh, owww!

1074
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:18,069
Don't you think
that's a little drastic?

1075
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,869
Let's go.

1076
01:13:19,942 --> 01:13:21,967
Don't touch him.

1077
01:13:23,312 --> 01:13:25,143
Ohhh!

1078
01:13:25,214 --> 01:13:27,944
Hey, big fella.

1079
01:13:28,017 --> 01:13:30,485
You wouldn't want me to hurt
the lovely lady, would you?

1080
01:13:30,553 --> 01:13:33,420
You moved too soon.

1081
01:13:34,723 --> 01:13:38,625
- What?
- The second rule in a crisis:

1082
01:13:38,694 --> 01:13:41,458
Uh-oh. He's startin'
that funny talk, again.

1083
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:44,924
lf you choose to bluff,

1084
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,059
you must be prepared
to have your bluff called.

1085
01:13:47,136 --> 01:13:50,003
This is no bluff.

1086
01:13:50,072 --> 01:13:52,540
These are my cousins,
Sam and Dave.

1087
01:13:52,608 --> 01:13:54,872
Get these jerks
outta here.

1088
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:13,394
l'm so proud of you.
l love when you hit people.

1089
01:14:15,164 --> 01:14:17,655
You got a lot
of rules, Jules.

1090
01:14:26,308 --> 01:14:28,401
What a day.

1091
01:14:28,477 --> 01:14:32,072
First we visited
our birthplace,

1092
01:14:32,147 --> 01:14:34,206
then we bought
new clothes.

1093
01:14:34,283 --> 01:14:38,014
l got a bucket of ice and
a very good bottle of wine.

1094
01:14:38,087 --> 01:14:41,614
- Then we danced the waltz.
- Yes, we did.

1095
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:44,853
- lt's too bright.
- Then we got into a fight.

1096
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:48,920
- We have this beautiful room.
- Perfect. Yes, it is beautiful.

1097
01:14:48,998 --> 01:14:51,262
Life just doesn't
get better than this.

1098
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:55,429
- Oh, yes, it does. Good night.
- Where are you going?

1099
01:14:55,504 --> 01:14:59,031
l'm gonna go tuck Linda in
and maybe read her a bedtime story.

1100
01:14:59,108 --> 01:15:02,271
Don't wait up for me.

1101
01:15:02,344 --> 01:15:07,680
Tonight is your night, bro

1102
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,684
lt's your night, bro

1103
01:15:13,322 --> 01:15:15,290
Oh, Vincent, you locked
yourself out.

1104
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:17,484
l--

1105
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:19,720
- Marnie.
- Hi.

1106
01:15:19,795 --> 01:15:21,729
- Hi.
- Vince and Linda wanna be alone,

1107
01:15:21,797 --> 01:15:25,062
so l'm afraid l'm gonna
have to stay here tonight.

1108
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:29,503
- You mean you're gonna
sleep here tonight?
- Uh-huh.

1109
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:32,563
Which bed should l take?

1110
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:37,310
Either bed will be fine.

1111
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:39,313
l always sleep
on the floo--

1112
01:15:48,824 --> 01:15:52,385
- Good night.
- Good night.

1113
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:08,801
Julius.

1114
01:16:12,147 --> 01:16:15,810
- Good night.
- Good night.

1115
01:16:32,067 --> 01:16:34,865
- Oh, no.
- What?

1116
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:39,969
- What's the matter?
- This bed is lumpy.

1117
01:16:45,447 --> 01:16:48,678
You mind if l share
the floor with you?

1118
01:17:16,145 --> 01:17:19,842
You're teasing me,
aren't you?

1119
01:17:19,915 --> 01:17:22,349
A little.

1120
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:29,223
What do l do now?

1121
01:17:32,327 --> 01:17:34,318
We'll figure it out.

1122
01:17:37,266 --> 01:17:40,326
- Oh, Vince.
- Tonight is our night, bro

1123
01:17:40,402 --> 01:17:43,303
Why are you
doing that now?

1124
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:45,306
Mom hasn't seen me
in all these years.

1125
01:17:45,374 --> 01:17:47,740
l wanna look my best.

1126
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:51,007
- Tonight
- Your mom's gonna love you
whatever you look like.

1127
01:17:51,079 --> 01:17:53,047
And you look
really good.

1128
01:17:53,115 --> 01:17:55,515
l know, l know,
l know, l know.

1129
01:17:55,584 --> 01:17:59,748
So like this.
One, two, three.

1130
01:17:59,822 --> 01:18:01,756
Are you a little nervous?

1131
01:18:01,824 --> 01:18:03,758
27, 28, no, 29.

1132
01:18:03,826 --> 01:18:05,726
- Just a little.
- Nine, ten.

1133
01:18:06,461 --> 01:18:08,395
- Linda.
- What?

1134
01:18:08,463 --> 01:18:12,456
Like, what if she's
disappointed in me?

1135
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:15,367
lf she's disappointed,
then she's a fake.

1136
01:18:15,437 --> 01:18:18,702
l don't know what else
a mom could want in a son.

1137
01:18:18,774 --> 01:18:21,766
- Huh?
- You're right.

1138
01:18:21,844 --> 01:18:24,779
You're right, you're right.
Why am l worried?

1139
01:18:24,847 --> 01:18:26,781
- What am l worried about?
- l don't know.

1140
01:18:26,849 --> 01:18:28,817
You got it all.

1141
01:18:28,884 --> 01:18:34,447
- l couldn't do this without you, Linda.
- Yeah.

1142
01:18:34,523 --> 01:18:37,287
You know,
l've been thinking...

1143
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:40,851
- that when we get back...
- Yeah?

1144
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:43,193
l think we should
move in together.

1145
01:18:43,265 --> 01:18:45,199
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1146
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:47,633
- Oh, no, no.
- lt's not ''Oh, no.''

1147
01:18:47,703 --> 01:18:49,694
- lt's not no, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1148
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:52,035
l don't want to get married
and it's not that l wanna...

1149
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:54,598
keep track of you,
because l don't need to.

1150
01:18:54,676 --> 01:18:58,077
l just wanna
live with you.

1151
01:18:58,146 --> 01:19:00,706
lt'd be fun.

1152
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:03,842
Linda, look at me.

1153
01:19:03,919 --> 01:19:05,944
Do l look like somebody
who could play house?

1154
01:19:06,021 --> 01:19:09,047
l'm cranky in the morning,
l'm grouchy in the afternoon,

1155
01:19:09,124 --> 01:19:11,558
l'm moody at night,
l'm like miserable.

1156
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:13,993
l know what
you're like.

1157
01:19:14,062 --> 01:19:18,158
Let's sleep on it, okay?
Sleep on it.

1158
01:19:18,233 --> 01:19:20,667
- Okay, one night.
- This is going to be great.

1159
01:19:20,736 --> 01:19:24,502
Tomorrow l'm taking my best girl
to meet my mom. l'm so excited.

1160
01:19:24,573 --> 01:19:28,202
- Your best girl?
- Yeah, you, you.

1161
01:19:28,277 --> 01:19:31,735
- Linda, there's no other girls.
Not anymore.
- Yeah?

1162
01:19:31,813 --> 01:19:36,113
- Just you.
- There better not be. Know why?

1163
01:19:36,184 --> 01:19:41,520
- Why?
- 'Cause l only have eyes for you

1164
01:19:45,827 --> 01:19:47,795
- That sounds familiar.
- lt's a good song.

1165
01:19:47,863 --> 01:19:49,797
You like that song, huh?

1166
01:19:49,865 --> 01:19:54,859
And l only have eyes

1167
01:19:54,937 --> 01:20:01,968
For you
she-bop she-bop

1168
01:20:02,044 --> 01:20:04,012
She-bop she-bop

1169
01:20:06,381 --> 01:20:07,939
She-bop she-bop

1170
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:14,888
l only have eyes for you
She-bop she-bop

1171
01:20:14,957 --> 01:20:16,058
She-bop she-bop

1172
01:20:16,058 --> 01:20:18,618
She-bop she-bop

1173
01:20:18,694 --> 01:20:21,788
Just for you
She-bop she-bop

1174
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:37,076
Oh, it's huge.

1175
01:20:37,145 --> 01:20:39,079
Oh, it's beautiful.

1176
01:20:39,147 --> 01:20:41,081
Not to mention valuable.

1177
01:20:41,149 --> 01:20:43,583
Real estate like this
is worth a fortune.

1178
01:20:43,652 --> 01:20:45,620
You mustn't always
think about money.

1179
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:47,917
You got me all wrong,
Julius.

1180
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:52,584
l'm just saying
it's nice Mom's loaded.

1181
01:20:52,661 --> 01:20:56,097
That's a worry she won't
have to have in her old age.

1182
01:20:56,164 --> 01:20:57,961
Hello,
can l help you?

1183
01:20:58,033 --> 01:21:00,900
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, um, excuse me.

1184
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:02,800
We are looking for
Mary Ann Benedict, please.

1185
01:21:02,871 --> 01:21:05,396
l'm sorry, but
that's not possible.

1186
01:21:05,474 --> 01:21:07,738
Look, we've
come a long way.

1187
01:21:07,809 --> 01:21:11,768
And believe me, she's gonna
be very happy to see us.

1188
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:16,011
You're gonna have to
write to the Benedict Foundation
stating your business.

1189
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:18,109
l'm sorry. Good day.

1190
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:27,057
- Foundation?
- Millions, Julius.

1191
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:29,063
Mama's rich.
We gotta go see her.

1192
01:21:29,131 --> 01:21:30,655
Buckaroos.

1193
01:21:30,732 --> 01:21:33,200
- Let's get in there.
We gotta talk to her.
- We sneak in.

1194
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:35,702
- How is it?
- Yeah, it's clear. Throw me over.

1195
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:37,762
Okay.

1196
01:21:41,009 --> 01:21:43,910
Vince?
Vince, are you okay?

1197
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:45,947
Yeah, shut up.
Come on, come on.

1198
01:22:09,704 --> 01:22:11,672
What a lovely day.

1199
01:22:15,577 --> 01:22:19,877
Hey, Vincent, don't you
think this is Mama?

1200
01:22:19,948 --> 01:22:24,408
lt could be. Yeah.

1201
01:22:24,486 --> 01:22:27,785
Don't just stand there.
Go introduce yourselves.

1202
01:22:27,856 --> 01:22:29,084
Hey!

1203
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:32,684
- Should you people be here?
- Uh-oh.

1204
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:36,697
That depends on how you feel
personally about trespassing.

1205
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:39,359
Does he always try
to be funny like that?

1206
01:22:39,434 --> 01:22:43,427
- We're looking for
Miss Mary Ann Benedict.
- Yeah.

1207
01:22:43,505 --> 01:22:46,941
- ls she here?
- Yeah, she's here.

1208
01:22:47,008 --> 01:22:49,533
She's here!

1209
01:22:49,611 --> 01:22:52,375
Sneaking in like that,
l should call the police.

1210
01:22:52,447 --> 01:22:54,711
No, no, no. You don't want
to do anything like that.

1211
01:22:54,783 --> 01:22:59,243
This is not your everyday,
average situation.

1212
01:23:07,162 --> 01:23:09,596
She's our mother,
is the thing.

1213
01:23:09,664 --> 01:23:12,224
- We're her sons.
- Twin sons.

1214
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:17,534
You're comedians.

1215
01:23:17,606 --> 01:23:20,074
- No.
- No. We--

1216
01:23:20,142 --> 01:23:22,372
We're kind of a surprise.

1217
01:23:22,444 --> 01:23:26,380
l'll bet you are.
Follow me.

1218
01:23:32,154 --> 01:23:35,248
- We were right.
- lt is her.

1219
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:44,289
Excuse me.

1220
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:48,161
- We thought that this is--
- Mary Ann Benedict?

1221
01:23:48,236 --> 01:23:51,205
This is an artists' colony.
There are a lot of painters.

1222
01:23:51,273 --> 01:23:54,936
Come on.

1223
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:58,811
l can't wait to meet her.

1224
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,973
- Yeah.
- lt's gotta be amazing.

1225
01:24:01,049 --> 01:24:04,018
Look. Mary Ann Benedict
never understood...

1226
01:24:04,085 --> 01:24:06,781
why people wanted
to buy her paintings.

1227
01:24:06,855 --> 01:24:09,847
But for a brief period,
they were considered valuable.

1228
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:13,326
She used the money
to buy Whispering Pines.

1229
01:24:15,297 --> 01:24:17,492
May l ask you a question?

1230
01:24:17,566 --> 01:24:21,559
Why do you keep referring
to her in the past tense?

1231
01:24:21,636 --> 01:24:24,469
Because...

1232
01:24:24,539 --> 01:24:26,939
she passed away
some time ago.

1233
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:31,144
She passed--

1234
01:24:31,213 --> 01:24:34,478
You jus-- You just said
she was here.

1235
01:24:34,549 --> 01:24:38,952
l meant, her spirit.
Her spirit is always here.

1236
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,182
Come on.

1237
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:12,778
Can we get the hell
out of here, please?

1238
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:18,054
Those damn real estate developers!

1239
01:25:18,126 --> 01:25:21,584
They won't be happy until
they turn this into a golf course.

1240
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:24,257
Oh, is that
who they were?

1241
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:27,165
They're shameless.
They'll try anything.

1242
01:25:29,137 --> 01:25:32,937
Do you know those men claim
to be my twin sons?

1243
01:25:33,008 --> 01:25:35,238
- lf you can believe that!
- What?

1244
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:38,006
lt was really
quite upsetting.

1245
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:40,343
Mary Ann, l am sorry.

1246
01:25:40,415 --> 01:25:42,679
lt's all right.
lt doesn't matter.

1247
01:25:42,751 --> 01:25:44,981
You get over things.

1248
01:25:47,188 --> 01:25:49,748
l did have a child once.

1249
01:25:49,824 --> 01:25:52,691
But he died at birth.

1250
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,233
You should be proud of her.

1251
01:26:01,303 --> 01:26:03,533
She donates her house, land,

1252
01:26:03,605 --> 01:26:06,005
and all her paintings
to young artists.

1253
01:26:06,074 --> 01:26:09,100
Linda, do l look like
a young artist?

1254
01:26:09,177 --> 01:26:12,374
- All she meant--
- l know what she meant,
and why she's here.

1255
01:26:12,447 --> 01:26:14,938
lt's got nothing to do
with finding my mother,

1256
01:26:15,016 --> 01:26:17,109
and everything
to do with money.

1257
01:26:17,185 --> 01:26:21,121
- That's not true and you know it.
- Bullshit!

1258
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:22,859
Take it easy, Vincent.
This is not her fault.

1259
01:26:22,859 --> 01:26:24,190
Take it easy, Vincent.
This is not her fault.

1260
01:26:24,261 --> 01:26:27,094
Look who decided
to chime in!

1261
01:26:27,163 --> 01:26:29,097
The creature from
the Black Lagoon.

1262
01:26:29,165 --> 01:26:31,429
l should've had my head
examined listening to you.

1263
01:26:31,501 --> 01:26:33,526
A deal-of-a-lifetime
opportunity,

1264
01:26:33,603 --> 01:26:36,333
and l'm out looking
for a dead mother.

1265
01:26:36,406 --> 01:26:39,398
- All l wanted was to
make us into a family.
- Family, my butt!

1266
01:26:39,476 --> 01:26:41,706
There's no family here.

1267
01:26:41,778 --> 01:26:44,679
There's nothin' here
except me and three losers.

1268
01:26:44,748 --> 01:26:46,909
l don't know
why l listen to people.

1269
01:26:46,983 --> 01:26:49,349
- l don't know why l do it.
- Cut it out.

1270
01:26:49,419 --> 01:26:51,387
Vince!

1271
01:26:51,454 --> 01:26:53,388
- l'm leaving.
- No, stop!

1272
01:26:53,456 --> 01:26:55,549
Stop! What are you doing?

1273
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:58,321
You're acting
like a fourth-grader.

1274
01:26:58,395 --> 01:27:01,489
Where do you think
you're going?

1275
01:27:01,564 --> 01:27:04,863
He dumped us in
the middle of New Mexico.

1276
01:27:04,934 --> 01:27:07,232
l can't--

1277
01:27:07,304 --> 01:27:09,238
Julius!

1278
01:27:09,306 --> 01:27:11,740
You don't know this,

1279
01:27:11,808 --> 01:27:14,606
and l promised Vince
that l wouldn't tell you,

1280
01:27:14,678 --> 01:27:18,478
but he's got something in
the trunk that's worth millions.

1281
01:27:18,548 --> 01:27:23,315
l'm worried he's gonna get
himself killed delivering it.

1282
01:27:27,724 --> 01:27:30,386
Okay, yeah. Yes, Mr. Beetroot.

1283
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:34,954
Yeah, l'll find it. Yeah.

1284
01:27:35,031 --> 01:27:36,999
Yes, l have a map.

1285
01:27:37,067 --> 01:27:39,228
All right.
l'll see you there.

1286
01:27:39,302 --> 01:27:41,463
See you in Houston
in the morning.

1287
01:27:41,538 --> 01:27:44,063
l'll be looking
forward to it.

1288
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:46,734
What a coincidence.

1289
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:48,778
That was our friend.

1290
01:27:48,845 --> 01:27:52,178
Looks like l'm gonna be
doing business with... him.

1291
01:27:52,248 --> 01:27:53,613
Sorry.

1292
01:27:53,683 --> 01:27:56,015
l would have done
the same thing.

1293
01:27:56,086 --> 01:27:59,522
You want the merchandise.
lt's not your problem who delivers.

1294
01:27:59,589 --> 01:28:01,454
Precisely.

1295
01:28:07,063 --> 01:28:09,827
But how will
you find him?

1296
01:28:09,899 --> 01:28:11,833
l have him in my head.

1297
01:28:11,901 --> 01:28:15,667
l found him once,
l'll find him again.

1298
01:28:15,739 --> 01:28:18,071
l hope so. Bye.

1299
01:28:18,141 --> 01:28:20,439
Be careful.

1300
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:22,944
Brother to brother

1301
01:28:25,648 --> 01:28:27,775
Brother to brother

1302
01:28:30,854 --> 01:28:32,845
One to another

1303
01:28:32,922 --> 01:28:35,891
Like no other

1304
01:28:35,959 --> 01:28:40,089
Brother to brother
Brother to brother

1305
01:28:40,163 --> 01:28:42,859
Never knew you existed

1306
01:28:42,932 --> 01:28:45,196
Never saw you
in my dreams

1307
01:28:45,268 --> 01:28:47,532
lf there were signs
l must've missed 'em

1308
01:28:47,604 --> 01:28:50,072
Who would l believe

1309
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:52,472
Now all of a sudden

1310
01:28:52,542 --> 01:28:54,635
We're sharing this skin

1311
01:28:54,711 --> 01:28:57,236
Like a shadow
you stick to me

1312
01:28:57,313 --> 01:28:59,781
Through every jam l'm in

1313
01:28:59,849 --> 01:29:02,443
Brother to brother

1314
01:29:02,519 --> 01:29:06,546
You took me by the hand
brother to brother

1315
01:29:06,623 --> 01:29:10,423
You helped me understand
one to another

1316
01:29:10,493 --> 01:29:13,656
There'll never be another
No, no

1317
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:16,028
Brother to brother
my brother

1318
01:29:16,099 --> 01:29:18,795
Brother to brother
my brother

1319
01:29:18,868 --> 01:29:23,896
When l felt like a zero

1320
01:29:25,175 --> 01:29:28,440
You became my hero

1321
01:29:28,511 --> 01:29:30,945
One to another

1322
01:29:31,014 --> 01:29:34,177
You have been my brother

1323
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:38,016
My brother
Whoa

1324
01:29:38,087 --> 01:29:39,255
Brother to brother

1325
01:29:39,255 --> 01:29:40,279
Brother to brother

1326
01:29:40,356 --> 01:29:43,792
When l was up
against the wall

1327
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:46,488
About to take
a really big fall

1328
01:29:57,707 --> 01:29:59,641
Sorry l'm late.

1329
01:29:59,709 --> 01:30:02,701
- The directions you gave me weren't--
- Step back.

1330
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:09,143
Get over here.

1331
01:30:09,219 --> 01:30:11,915
l'm unarmed.

1332
01:30:11,988 --> 01:30:14,081
He's clean.

1333
01:30:14,157 --> 01:30:17,524
Oh, oh.
lsn't that pretty!

1334
01:30:17,594 --> 01:30:19,528
Yeah, it is.

1335
01:30:19,596 --> 01:30:22,861
- Did you come here alone, unarmed?
- Yeah.

1336
01:30:22,932 --> 01:30:24,991
You're just some fool
who stole a car?

1337
01:30:25,068 --> 01:30:28,663
Yeah, l guess l am.

1338
01:30:28,738 --> 01:30:31,639
You don't know what
the hell this is, do you?

1339
01:30:31,708 --> 01:30:34,700
No.

1340
01:30:34,777 --> 01:30:38,406
Revolutionary fuel-injection
system for jets.

1341
01:30:38,481 --> 01:30:41,416
Worth a fortune to the company that
brings it to the market first.

1342
01:30:41,484 --> 01:30:45,750
Somebody else developed it,
but l just had to have it.

1343
01:30:45,822 --> 01:30:48,290
Crafty devil, huh?

1344
01:30:49,158 --> 01:30:51,422
What are you waiting for?

1345
01:30:52,695 --> 01:30:54,686
Wait a minute, Beetroot!

1346
01:30:54,764 --> 01:30:57,494
- l thought we had a deal.
- We do.

1347
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:09,237
Five million bucks!

1348
01:31:09,312 --> 01:31:12,406
- You wanna count it?
- No, no.

1349
01:31:12,482 --> 01:31:17,215
- But l could use a lift to town.
- Don't press your luck.

1350
01:31:17,287 --> 01:31:19,221
Okay. That's all right.

1351
01:31:19,289 --> 01:31:23,157
l gassed it up for you,
Beetroot. Thank you!

1352
01:31:23,226 --> 01:31:28,289
Five million dollars!
Five million bucks!

1353
01:31:28,364 --> 01:31:31,663
Ha-ha-ha!
Five million bucks!

1354
01:31:31,734 --> 01:31:34,362
l've gotta look at it!

1355
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:38,633
Uh-oh.

1356
01:32:18,982 --> 01:32:21,246
Hey, Benedict!

1357
01:32:21,317 --> 01:32:24,218
All l want is the money.

1358
01:32:24,287 --> 01:32:28,223
Just give me what's mine
and l'll leave you alone.

1359
01:33:05,161 --> 01:33:07,493
Steps! Steps!

1360
01:33:18,875 --> 01:33:21,366
Leave my brother alone.

1361
01:33:22,512 --> 01:33:25,106
No.

1362
01:33:25,181 --> 01:33:27,115
You.

1363
01:33:27,183 --> 01:33:30,380
No, no, no.

1364
01:33:30,453 --> 01:33:33,320
No, no.

1365
01:33:36,125 --> 01:33:39,526
Julius, you're--
you're here?

1366
01:33:39,595 --> 01:33:42,086
No. No, you idiot.

1367
01:33:42,165 --> 01:33:44,360
Don't be nervous.

1368
01:33:44,434 --> 01:33:47,835
l hate violence.
Plus l never carry a gun.

1369
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:50,498
Who are you?

1370
01:33:50,573 --> 01:33:52,564
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1371
01:33:52,642 --> 01:33:54,667
Put the gun down.
l got the money.

1372
01:33:54,744 --> 01:33:57,542
Here's your money.
Here's your money.

1373
01:33:57,613 --> 01:34:00,776
Here's the money.

1374
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:03,318
You're a goddamned millionaire.

1375
01:34:04,654 --> 01:34:09,387
You, l am never
gonna forgive... never.

1376
01:34:09,459 --> 01:34:13,088
- Open it.
- Open it?

1377
01:34:13,162 --> 01:34:16,654
You were going
to get killed.

1378
01:34:16,733 --> 01:34:20,430
- l was trying to distract him
so you could escape.
- l already had escaped!

1379
01:34:20,503 --> 01:34:24,030
l was halfway to Brazil
when l felt you!

1380
01:34:24,107 --> 01:34:27,304
- Close it.
- Close it?

1381
01:34:27,376 --> 01:34:29,503
Open it, close it.
Open it, close it.

1382
01:34:29,579 --> 01:34:33,310
- Why didn't you go?
- Why didn't l go?

1383
01:34:33,382 --> 01:34:37,182
Because thanks to you,
l'm not only a goddamned psychic--

1384
01:34:37,253 --> 01:34:38,743
Benedict!

1385
01:34:38,821 --> 01:34:41,415
- l think the case belongs to me.
- Oh, sorry.

1386
01:34:41,491 --> 01:34:45,621
l got this disease
called a conscience.

1387
01:34:45,695 --> 01:34:49,358
- No one ever said being good was easy.
- ''No one ever said--''

1388
01:34:49,432 --> 01:34:50,956
Will you two shut up!

1389
01:34:51,033 --> 01:34:53,831
Butt out, pal!
You got your money.

1390
01:34:53,903 --> 01:34:56,929
Now take it and go live in
the lap of luxury somewhere.

1391
01:34:57,006 --> 01:34:59,236
Try Brazil.

1392
01:34:59,308 --> 01:35:02,709
lt doesn't work that way.
You've seen my face.

1393
01:35:02,779 --> 01:35:04,974
Which one's first?

1394
01:35:05,047 --> 01:35:08,915
You gonna kill us, even though
we gave you the money?

1395
01:35:08,985 --> 01:35:10,282
You got it.

1396
01:35:10,353 --> 01:35:14,084
Wait, you forgot the third rule
in a crisis situation.

1397
01:35:14,157 --> 01:35:17,558
- The third rule?
- Third rule?

1398
01:35:17,627 --> 01:35:20,562
Yeah, third rule.

1399
01:35:24,667 --> 01:35:26,567
Oooh!

1400
01:35:26,636 --> 01:35:29,901
- The third rule.
- What's the third rule?

1401
01:35:29,972 --> 01:35:31,564
Duck!

1402
01:36:01,537 --> 01:36:03,835
Yo!

1403
01:36:03,906 --> 01:36:06,898
Holy-shmoly!

1404
01:36:12,281 --> 01:36:15,375
Now there's a man
with a lot on his mind.

1405
01:36:18,387 --> 01:36:21,083
Thanks for coming back,
Vincent.

1406
01:36:21,157 --> 01:36:24,092
We're brothers, right?

1407
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:26,424
- We're family.
- That's right.

1408
01:36:29,298 --> 01:36:31,789
A rich family.

1409
01:36:31,868 --> 01:36:34,302
- A good family.
- What? What?

1410
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:36,964
- We're gonna return this money.
- No.

1411
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:39,234
- We don't have to give it back.
- Yes, we do.

1412
01:36:39,308 --> 01:36:41,367
- Why? Why?
- We have to, believe me.

1413
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:47,943
- Mary Ann?
- Hmm?

1414
01:36:48,017 --> 01:36:51,180
l think you'd better come
take a look at this.

1415
01:36:51,254 --> 01:36:54,553
What is it?

1416
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:22,608
Mary Ann?

1417
01:37:22,685 --> 01:37:26,815
What a pleasant surprise.

1418
01:37:29,358 --> 01:37:32,384
You stole my family.

1419
01:37:32,461 --> 01:37:35,589
You lying son of a bitch.

1420
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:43,804
Linda, l'm sorry.

1421
01:37:43,873 --> 01:37:46,467
l made a terrible mistake
and l apologize.

1422
01:37:46,542 --> 01:37:49,272
l-- All l'm asking for
is another chance.

1423
01:37:49,345 --> 01:37:51,336
l know l don't
deserve this--

1424
01:37:51,414 --> 01:37:53,575
That's right,
you don't deserve it.

1425
01:38:08,864 --> 01:38:10,889
Vince?

1426
01:38:24,976 --> 01:38:28,537
Yes, this is the
Benedict Corporation.

1427
01:38:28,613 --> 01:38:31,810
We are a consulting firm...
a think tank.

1428
01:38:31,882 --> 01:38:35,113
Something like
the Rand Corporation.

1429
01:38:35,186 --> 01:38:37,711
- Only smarter.
- Only smarter.

1430
01:38:37,788 --> 01:38:39,813
Tomorrow at 3:00.

1431
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:43,291
Yes, l'll put you down.

1432
01:38:43,361 --> 01:38:45,352
Good night, Mr. Benedicts.

1433
01:38:45,429 --> 01:38:47,420
- Good night.
- Good night.

1434
01:38:47,498 --> 01:38:51,332
That's it.
The last check is written.

1435
01:38:51,402 --> 01:38:54,667
What do we have left out of
the $50,000 reward?

1436
01:38:54,739 --> 01:38:57,731
After we've paid off
all our debts,

1437
01:38:57,808 --> 01:39:00,675
we have exactly $12,278.

1438
01:39:00,745 --> 01:39:04,545
- $12,278. That's terrible.
- What?

1439
01:39:04,615 --> 01:39:07,550
You're just upset because
l made you return that suitcase.

1440
01:39:10,454 --> 01:39:13,981
Oh, the money.

1441
01:39:14,058 --> 01:39:16,492
You mean the
four million dollars.

1442
01:39:17,762 --> 01:39:20,162
Four million dollars.
Just say it.

1443
01:39:20,231 --> 01:39:23,496
Say it...
four million dollars.

1444
01:39:23,567 --> 01:39:26,161
lt's a lot of money,
Jules.

1445
01:39:26,237 --> 01:39:29,502
Vincent...
l'm very proud of you.

1446
01:39:29,573 --> 01:39:33,407
Well...

1447
01:39:33,477 --> 01:39:37,174
yeah, l'm kinda
proud of myself.

1448
01:39:37,248 --> 01:39:40,649
lsn't it great to be one of
the good guys for a change?

1449
01:39:40,718 --> 01:39:43,812
lt feels great
to be a good guy!

1450
01:39:43,888 --> 01:39:47,051
You're a great guy, too.
You came back for me, huh?

1451
01:39:47,124 --> 01:39:50,321
- You did steal a car though.
- l borrowed one.

1452
01:39:50,394 --> 01:39:53,795
l brought it back the next day.
l explained it to the man.

1453
01:39:53,864 --> 01:39:55,661
He was a cowboy.

1454
01:39:55,733 --> 01:39:58,759
Excuse me? l'm--

1455
01:39:58,836 --> 01:40:02,567
Oh, my God. l don't even know
which one is which.

1456
01:40:07,044 --> 01:40:09,239
l'm sorry.
l didn't know.

1457
01:40:09,313 --> 01:40:12,612
You see, l didn't
believe your story.

1458
01:40:12,683 --> 01:40:15,709
Who would believe
a crazy story like that?

1459
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:22,284
They lied to me
all these years.

1460
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:25,454
They lied to you, too.

1461
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:35,701
You found each other.

1462
01:40:42,213 --> 01:40:44,443
Now you found me.

1463
01:41:03,968 --> 01:41:05,936
Mama?

1464
01:41:07,605 --> 01:41:08,867
Mama!

1465
01:41:10,975 --> 01:41:12,499
Mama!

1466
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,908
Oh, Mama!

1467
01:41:33,197 --> 01:41:35,529
Good.

1468
01:41:35,599 --> 01:41:37,863
Tickets?

1469
01:41:37,935 --> 01:41:39,869
Thanks. This is
gonna be great.

1470
01:41:39,937 --> 01:41:42,770
l just can't get over
how alike they are.

1471
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:45,968
Yes, it's a beautiful day.

1472
01:42:17,808 --> 01:42:21,869
Twins united outside and in

1473
01:42:21,946 --> 01:42:23,880
Mm-mm, Uh-huh

1474
01:42:24,815 --> 01:42:26,840
When you're twins

1475
01:42:26,917 --> 01:42:30,080
The magic just never ends

1476
01:42:32,356 --> 01:42:35,917
What happened to you
Hey, l could feel it

1477
01:42:35,993 --> 01:42:39,554
l smile and l cry
without knowing why

1478
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:43,191
Your joy and your pain
would be so real

1479
01:42:43,267 --> 01:42:47,294
l felt like my life
was happenin' again

1480
01:42:47,371 --> 01:42:50,966
And now l know it's
'cause you're part of me

1481
01:42:51,041 --> 01:42:54,568
Wasn't my choice
it was meant to be

1482
01:42:54,645 --> 01:42:58,274
We were connected
even when apart

1483
01:42:58,349 --> 01:43:01,876
We got together
now the real problems start

1484
01:43:01,952 --> 01:43:05,820
Twins
united outside and in

1485
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:08,290
Yeah

1486
01:43:08,359 --> 01:43:10,691
When you're twins

1487
01:43:10,761 --> 01:43:13,594
The magic just never ends

1488
01:43:17,902 --> 01:43:21,497
lf one me is good
then two is better

1489
01:43:21,572 --> 01:43:25,338
Well, l can't complain
'cause l'm ahead of the game

1490
01:43:25,409 --> 01:43:28,936
We split the pain
double the pleasure

1491
01:43:29,013 --> 01:43:32,574
l'm starting to feel
life gave us a deal

1492
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:36,586
No, we're not just
your average family

1493
01:43:36,654 --> 01:43:40,283
Got benefits
most people never see

1494
01:43:40,357 --> 01:43:43,884
And if l had a chance
to live again

1495
01:43:43,961 --> 01:43:47,226
l wouldn't want it
unless l was your twin

1496
01:43:47,298 --> 01:43:52,065
Twins
united outside and in

1497
01:43:52,136 --> 01:43:54,036
Ah, yeah

1498
01:43:54,104 --> 01:43:56,299
When you're twins

1499
01:43:56,373 --> 01:43:59,365
The magic just never ends

1500
01:43:59,443 --> 01:44:01,673
Ah, yeah

1501
01:44:01,745 --> 01:44:06,307
Twins
united outside and in

1502
01:44:06,383 --> 01:44:07,748
Mm-mm, Uh-huh

1503
01:44:08,619 --> 01:44:10,951
When you're twins

1504
01:44:11,021 --> 01:44:14,081
The magic just never ends

1505
01:44:16,293 --> 01:44:19,751
Twins

1506
01:44:38,315 --> 01:44:40,078
Twins
