(TAPPING ON MIC)

2
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,915
RICKY GERVAIS: Testing. Testing.

3
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:56,470
Testing over the credits.
The credits that no one cares about.

4
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,259
"Ooh, we’re the business people.

5
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,309
"Ooh, we want our credit
before the film starts, 'cause... "

6
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,597
Anyway.

7
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,896
The story you’re about to see
takes place in a world

8
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:09,271
where the human race has never evolved
the ability to tell a lie.

9
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,352
This is a typical town in that world.

10
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,982
As you can see, people have jobs and cars
and houses and families,

11
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,825
but everyone tells the absolute truth.

12
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,663
There’s no such thing
as deceit or flattery or fiction.

13
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,907
People say exactly what they think,

14
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,414
and sometimes that can come across
as a bit harsh.

15
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,086
But they've got no choice in the matter.
It's their nature.

16
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,004
Look, I'm not coming in to work today.

17
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,466
No, I'm not sick. I just hate it there.

18
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,170
Oh, your baby is so ugly. It's like a little rat.

19
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:43,092
Wow! I just took one of the biggest poops
of my whole life.

20
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,266
What are you ordering?

21
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,596
GERVAIS: So if you're a chubby,
little loser like this guy, for example,

22
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,352
that's Mark Bellison, by the way,

23
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,901
then you're all alone
and at the bottom of the pile.

24
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:56,196
But later on in the story,
his luck's gonna change

25
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,490
when he tells the world's first lie.

26
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,068
He doesn't even know it himself yet.

27
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,279
So look forward to that.

28
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,993
(EXHALES)

29
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,131
Don't blow this.

30
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,139
-Hi!
-Hi.

31
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,689
You're early.

32
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,563
I was just masturbating.

33
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,270
That makes me think of your vagina.

34
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,108
I'm Mark. How are you?

35
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,612
A little frustrated at the moment.

36
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,821
Also, equally depressed and pessimistic
about our date tonight.

37
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,455
Sure.

38
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,453
I'm Anna. Come on in.

39
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,000
Um... Just wait there.

40
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,627
I need to finish getting ready.

41
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,549
While doing that,
I might realise I'm still horny

42
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,593
and try to finish masturbating
without you hearing.

43
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,091
(CHUCKLES)

44
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,025
I feel awkward now about being early.

45
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,398
ANNA: Yeah,
I'm disappointed that you're early

46
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,525
and not really looking forward
to tonight in general,

47
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,607
but the thought of being alone
the rest of my life

48
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,489
scares both my mother and me equally.

49
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,948
Sure.

50
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,128
Oh.

51
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:42,920
I'm thinking you've started masturbating,
'cause it's like it's too quiet.

52
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:47,007
And you said you were gonna
try and do it without me hearing.

53
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:54,515
I'm worried the restaurant I've picked
isn't expensive enough for you.

54
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,276
It's all I can afford

55
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,103
in my situation.

56
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,031
I know I'm in my 40s,

57
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,618
but I haven't got any
financial assets to speak of.

58
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,331
Also, my boss said
he's probably gonna fire me this week.

59
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,214
Wow!

60
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,707
I just masturbated.

61
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,426
That makes me horny.
I hope this date ends in sex.

62
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,753
I don't find you attractive.

63
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:25,963
Oh!

64
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,173
Shall we?

65
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,929
Yeah.

66
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,011
-After you.
-Thanks.

67
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,513
(SIGHS)

68
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,861
-This is not as nice as I remember it.
-What are we gonna talk about?

69
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,109
Hi. I'm threatened by you.

70
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,034
Mark Bellison. Table for two.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,202
Of course. Come with me.

72
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,617
MARK: Thank you.

73
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,539
Thank you.

74
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,710
-Plastic.
-I'm very embarrassed I work here.

75
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,166
-Hi.
-Hi.

76
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,592
-Hello.
-And you're very pretty.

77
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,048
That only makes this worse.

78
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,380
(CLEARS THROAT) Can I get
you two started on some drinks?

79
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,340
-ANNA: Yes.
-I'll have a Budweiser, please.

80
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,426
I'll have a mango margarita,

81
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,059
and I'll probably have three more drinks
by the end of the night.

82
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,560
-Your sister?
-No.

83
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,267
-Daughter?
-No.

84
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,477
She's way out of your league.

00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,107
Thank you.

87
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,988
Shall I ask you
some questions about yourself?

88
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,243
Yes.

89
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,332
How do you spend your days?

90
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,579
I get up at 8:00 in the morning

91
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,707
because the noise from my alarm clock
interrupts my sleep.

92
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,631
And I lean over and just turn it off.

93
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,958
Turn it off.
That's more specific than I thought.

94
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,463
-Oh. What did you want to know?
-Just...

95
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,592
-Well, do you have a job?
-I have a job in an office.

96
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,968
-What do you do?
-I'm an executive.

97
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,174
-Do you enjoy that?
-No.

98
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,305
-Oh!
-But I enjoy the end result of the job,

99
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,932
which is money.

100
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,809
And also the hours are pretty good
for the amount of money I make,

101
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,776
which I spend on things I like,
such as clothes and hiking and drinking,

102
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,774
even though I know it's bad for me.

103
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,403
But I'd rather just get all the money
and not have to work for the results.

104
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,858
Oh, sure.

105
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,785
Tell me something about you, though.

106
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,784
You already know a lot about me.

107
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,538
You know I'm good-looking
because, well, here I am.

108
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,540
And you know that I'm successful

109
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,997
because you've seen my apartment
and the clothes that I'm wearing.

110
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,342
And you know I'm happy
because I'm smiling.

111
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,631
-Are you always happy?
-Usually.

112
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,715
Some days I stay in bed, eating and crying.

113
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,310
-There you go.
-Thank you.

114
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,481
-I had a little sip of this from right there, so...
-Okay.

115
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,318
You guys ready to order
or do you need a moment?

116
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,732
I'm good.

117
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,407
Oh! I'll have the Caesar salad with chicken
because I think I'm fat,

118
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,326
but I also think I deserve
something that tastes good.

119
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,071
I'll have the fish tacos
'cause it's what I had last time I was here.

120
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,827
It's all I know.

121
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,867
Great. I'll get those two started.

122
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,710
If I gave you my number, would you call me?

123
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,954

Sorry. It's my mom.

126
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,344
I think she's probably checking on the date.
It won't take long.

Yes, I'm with him right now.

No, not very attractive.
No, doesn't make much money.

00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,764
It's all right, though.
Seems nice. Kind of funny.

A bit fat.

Yeah, but...

136
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,779
No, I won't be sleeping with him tonight.

137

No. Probably not even a kiss.

138
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,538
Okay. You, too. Bye. Sorry about that.

139

It's all right. Don't think twice.
How is your mum, all right?

140
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,044
-She's all right...
-Great. That's...

141
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,223
Thanks for going on this date with me.

142
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:01,224
You're way out of my league,
and I know you only did it as a favour to Greg

143
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,848
and I'll probably never
hear from you again, but...

144
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,352
I had a better time than I thought I'd have.

145
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,985
But I won't really know how I feel about you
till I'm a little less drunk.

146
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,281
-Sure.
-Yeah.

00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:17,407
Well, call me tomorrow
if you still like me when you're sober.

It's basically just brown sugar water.

159
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,148
Haven’t changed the ingredients much lately,

160
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,279
so there's nothing new
I can tell you about that.

161
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,235
Changed the can around a little bit, though.

162
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,866
You can see the colours are different there,

163
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,073
and we've added a polar bear,
so the kids like us.

164
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,875
Coke's very high in sugar,
and like any high-calorie soda,

165
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,420
it can lead to obesity in children and adults
who don't sustain a very healthy diet.

166
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,169
And that's it. It's Coke.
It's very famous. Everyone knows it.

167
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,718
I'm Bob. I work for Coke.
And I'm asking you to not stop buying Coke.

168
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,090

-Hi, Frank. Not too well.

175

I went on a date last night with a girl
I've had a crush on for years,

176
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,294
and she'll most likely never call me again.

177
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:54,795
Oh, and I think I'm getting fired today.
How about you?

178
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,837
Oh, I'm not too great, actually.

179
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,547
I've been throwing up painkillers all night

because I'm too afraid to take enough
to actually kill myself, so...

Why is there all this concrete?

189
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,853
I woke up this morning and realised,
not only do I not love you,

190
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,431
but also the thought
of sleeping with you sickens me.

00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,233
That should make me not love you,
but it only makes me love you more.

All of Lecture Films' productions are written,
filmed and edited on this very lot.

195
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:21,261
In fact, this building is
where Lecture Films' talented writers

196
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,215
scour the world's past events
for the most dramatic,

197
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,802
entertaining and even hilarious moments
from world history,

198
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,981
which are then turned into scripts,
handed over to our world-famous readers

Napoleon: 1812 to 1813.

206
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,094
And so Napoleon invaded Russia

207
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:07,299
with a brute force
of nearly 700,000 men behind him,

armed with muskets
and supported by cannon brigades.

Napoleon’s men persevered.

Hi, Mark.

222
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,481
I realise more and more every day
how overqualified I am for this position

223
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,309
and how incompetent you are at yours.

if he can get up the courage to fire you.

226
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,443
If he can't, he said
that he'll definitely do it tomorrow.

227
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,949
Anything else?
Any messages not to do with being fired?

228
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,904
Well, I told everyone
you're getting fired this week

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,536
and they shouldn't expect
their calls returned,

230
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,991
so no one left any messages.

231
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,872
Okay. Next time...

232
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,703
I don't think there'll be a next time.

233
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,834
...take the message,
just in case I don't get fired.

234
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,085
You're almost definitely getting fired.

235
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,508
Yeah, but I'm still here now, so...

236
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,880
Seems like a waste of time.

take the message in case I don't get...

-But everyone knows that you are.
-Hasn't happened yet.

you turned in were depressing.

Yeah, my favourite part was when she said
it was based on your looks.

-I knew it.
-But...

I went for a walk, right out of town.

and I fell asleep under a tree, palm tree.

with other people's life-changing stories.

I saw like a thing sticking out of the sand.

and it was an ancient chest.

710

00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,030
I'm gonna call the police,
you're gonna be arrested.

781
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,786
Well, I'm just gonna leave,
and you don't know my name.

-What is your name?
-Richard Bellison.

(LAUGHING) Good to meet you.

784
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,833
You've got two options. Option one,
I send the police to your house, right?

785
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:57,256
Arrest you there,
embarrass you in front of your neighbours.

786
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,797
Or option two, you just come in
and wait for the police here.

787
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,048
-No, I'll wait.
-Yeah?

788

-Come on in then. Do you want a cup of tea?
-Yeah, that'd be great.

of his life in jail.

790
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:08,847
I never really knew him.

791
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:13,102
But I've been blessed
with some luck as well in my life.

792
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,974
I had a wonderful mother who raised me.

-Oh, that's sweet.
-She's great.

794
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,894
Where is she?

795
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,067
At an old people's home.

796
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,943
But I'm gonna get her out of there tomorrow.

797
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,073
I'm gonna get her a mansion,

798
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,071
so she can spend
the rest of her life in luxury.

799
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,698
That's nice.

-Compliments from the chef.
-Thank you.

801

I don't know what's wrong with him today,
but these just look awful.

They look fine to me.

803
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,878
Well, you're stupid.

804
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,093
I was thinking.

805
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:51,310
Now I'm obviously rich and successful and...

806
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:58,402
Maybe I'm in your league
and that we could be together, romantically.

807

What would be the point?

808
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,070
We might enjoy it.

809
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:11,789
Well, I do like you
and I do enjoy your company.

810
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,749
And if we were to get together and procreate,

811

that are carrying half my genetic code

to be well taken care of, financially stable.

I also think you'd make a good father
and a good husband, which I like.

Fantastic.

Unfortunately, none of that changes the fact

816
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:33,770
that you'd still be contributing
half the genetic code to our children.

What do you mean, she's gonna die tonight?

830
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,884
It does not look very good.
She suffered a major heart attack.

831
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,763
Her heart is very weak.
Her pulse is not very strong.

832
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,724
Her blood pressure is dropping rapidly,

833
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,729
and she will probably suffer
a fatal heart attack sometime tonight.

Yes. Still going to die.

Anna and I are very happy together,
by the way.

1551
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:45,529
She still doesn't fully understand
how I said or did all those things.

1552
01:33:45,662 --> 01:33:49,496
No one does.
I'm still the only person who can tell a lie.

1553
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:52,787
Actually, that's not entirely true.

1554
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:57,499
What do you think?

1555
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:00,714
That looks good.

1556
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:05,629
It tastes so good, Mom my.

1557
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:08,882
-Your best yet.
-I'm so glad you like it.

1558
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:10,884
Huh? Oh.

1559
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:17,974
I don't know where to start.

1560
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:22,820
Just start on the bread, maybe,
then work my way up there.

1561
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:27,735
You eat that. You liked it so much.
Why don't you eat some more?

1562
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:30,449
He loves it.

1563
01:35:35,839 --> 01:35:38,849
