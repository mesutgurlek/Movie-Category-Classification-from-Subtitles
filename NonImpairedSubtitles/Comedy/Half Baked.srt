00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,997
<i>I wanna get right here.</i>

150
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,076
# <i>Legalise this shit, please!</i> #

151
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,039
I'm all out.

152
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,992
I'm all out of food. You ate it all.

153
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,749
Gee, you must've been so hungry.

154
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,712
Uh-oh!

155
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,478
Oh!

156
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,512
Buttercup! Buttercup!

157
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,397
I need an ambulance, now! Officer down!

158
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,275
I repeat, officer down!
What the hell did you give my Buttercup?

159
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,394
I just gave him some candy and some chips,
some pink popcorn and some Funyuns...

160
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,910
This horse is a diabetic!

161
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,234
Arrrgh!

162
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,272
Buttercup, Buttercup!

163
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,756
- Don't you leave me. Breathe, Buttercup!
- (Pounding)

164
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,156
Breathe, breathe!

165
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,514
(Howls) Why?!

166
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,998
- Why? (Sobs)
- Why?

167
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,877
- You're under arrest.
- What?

168
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,390
- You dumb son of a bitch!
- No!

169
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,318
I'm a... I'm a peaceful man.

170
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,557
- I'm a schoolteacher!
- Shut up! You're a cop killer!

171
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,558
Cop killer? I love horses!

172
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,795
- I love horses.
- I love horses.

173
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,037
- I love Buttered Stuff.
- Buttercup! Say it!

174
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,277
- Butter nuts.
- Cup, cup, cup!

175
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,515
(Sirens wailing)

176
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,118
Why must you rage? Stop the hate, child.

177
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,837
Bail is set at one million dollars
for the crime of killing an officer of the law.

178
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,556
And may God have mercy on your soul,
young man. This court is adjourned.

179

<i>(PA) Back to your cells. Lockdown.</i>

180
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,076

181
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,113
(All) Fish! Fish! Fish! Fish...

182

My weed's wearing off.

183
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,959

185
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,675
- <i>Guess who!</i>
- Yo, Thurgood.

186
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,790
Oh, ho-ho!

187
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,796
- Hey, nigger, what time is it?
- 8.30.

188
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,592
Kenny didn't come home last night.

189
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,835
- We are worried, man.
- Worried, yo.

190
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,552
Where the hell is he?

191
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,790
Did he just move?

192
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,270
"Kenny called. He's in jail.
He didn't leave a number.

193
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,118
"Sincerely, The Guy on the Couch."

194
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,278
Come on, guys.
We gotta get Kenny out of jail, man.

195
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,549
Hey, Kenny, how they treating you?

196
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,673
Let's just say I'm not gettin'
the respect a cop killer deserves.

197
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,438
All right, time's up. Break off.

198
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,710
I was up all night...

199
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,876
getting harassed!

200
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,435
- Hi, there, fish.
- See what I mean?

201
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,996
I think they're mistaking my kindness
for weakness. I'm scared!

202
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,593
Hey, Kenny,
we're gonna get you out of there, man.

203
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,236
All we gotta do is raise ten per cent
of one million, which, by our calculations...

204
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,874
Is fucking impossible, man!

205
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,831
Hey!

206
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,189
Sorry, man. I'm sorry.

207
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,438
All my life, I did everything right.
I never screwed up.

208
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,678
I fed the horse.
I didn't know it was a diabetic.

209
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,438
I'm scared!

210
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,631
Kenny, stop crying.
Stop crying, Kenny! Look at me.

211
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,276
Don't let 'em see you cry in there.

212
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,311
- Show me your mean face.
- No.

213
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,430
Yes, show me your mean face!

214
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,158
(Sniggers)

215
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,716
That's good.
I mean, work on it a little bit, but it's good.

216
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,518
- Kenny, how long can you make it in there?
- I don't know.

217
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,790
Maybe five...

218
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,829
6.30.

219
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,279
Man, it's gotta be a little longer than that.

220
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,634
But... but we'll get you out, right, guys?

221
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,070
- Yeah, you're out. You're outta here.
- Free as a bird.

222

<i>Number nine, time's up.</i>

223
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,755

- That's me.

224
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,956
I love you guys.

225
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,477
Have fun, Ken.

226
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,633
- He looked all right, man.
- They're gonna kill him in there, yo.

227
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,439
Hey, lady.

228
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,232
Miss, is this your purse?

229
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,510
- Yes.
- I'm sexy.

230
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,716
I'm a scholar. People like me.

231
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,237
Give it to me. Bye.

232
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,317
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

233
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,715
Well, can I leave with ya?

234
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,354
Follow me.

235
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,037
- And your name is?
- Mary Jane.

236
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,672
Really?

237
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,188
Yes. So what's up with this?

238
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,550
- Is that your work uniform?
- Nah, this is my costume.

239
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,910
Tomorrow I'll be a cowboy,
the day after that I'll be an Indian.

240
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,353
Every day of the week, I dress up like a
different Village Person. It's a thing I'm into.

241
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,550
No, I'm a custodian.

242
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,591
So, what are you here for?

243
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,598
- Possession of narcotics.
- Wow.

244
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,837
- My father's a drug dealer.
- That must've been the shit.

245
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,919
- It ruined his life.
- That must've been shitty.

246
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,554
I don't do drugs. Drugs make me sick.

247
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,797
They're bad for your body.
Up with hope, down with dope!

248
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,479
Thurgood, come on, man. We gotta go.

249
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,478
Get on the train.
Toke up before we go to work.

250
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,188
- Yo, let's go.
- What are you doing, man?

251
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,789
Bouncy. Body. Is that Prell?
Do you use Prell?

252
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,877
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about!

253
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,718
Hey, guys, meet Mary Jane.

254
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,035
That's what he's sayin'.
We wanna burn one.

255
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,911
No, no.

256
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,951
This is Mary Jane.

257
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,992
Meet her. Say hello to her.
Shake her hand, even.

258
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,873
- Oh, dear, my fault. What's up?
- Hi.

259
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,753
- All right.
- Hey.

260
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,793
Do you guys need a ride? I have a car.
You don't have to take the subway.

261
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,194
- You smoke?
- No, my grandmother died of lung cancer.

262
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,119
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- All the more reason to toke up, man.

263
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,436
Ease the pain.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

264
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,190
You know, I think what they're really trying
to say is that we'd love a ride home.

265
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,276
Great.

266
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,436
- What's wrong?
- She look good!

267
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,951
- Mary Jane! What is that about, man?
- I hate y'all.

268
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,592
Shotgun!

269
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,074
- Thanks for this ride. We appreciate it.
- Sure.

270
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,073
Guys, shut up about the weed.
I don't want this girl to know I smoke.

271
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,795
- Yeah, it's bad enough you're a janitor, yo.
- Custodian, dick!

272
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,551
(Bleeping)

273
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,794

281

282

I'm real bad at this, but you think
sometime we could get together,

283
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,879
maybe go out for some ice cream
or something?

284
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,512
Aggghhh-eee!

285

- Motherfucker said, "Ice cream"!
- Ice cream!

- Damn.
- OK.

287

- Let me give you my number. Is that cool?
- OK.

Don't call too late cos you know
I be strippin' in the evenings! Joking!

- Maybe.

296
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,673
"Maybe" is acceptable. It's that "no" thing
that gets me. Maybe I'll hear from you.

- Sorry about that. What is it, scientist?
- Could you...

303
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,428
I know this isn't your responsibility,

304
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,995
but would you run this down
to the supply department for me?

305

- Second floor.
- Just run this down?

306
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,554
Yes. But make sure you bring the order
right back to me. I need it ASAP.

307

Gotcha. I know this isn't your responsibility,

Including the house, it was only 250, yo.

- Ah.

683
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,670
- Cos you're a fibber.
- No, because we don't have any money.

00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,756
The money we have is not for spending,
