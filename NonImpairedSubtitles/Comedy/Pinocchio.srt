<i>When you wish upon a star</i>

2
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:37,929
<i>Makes no difference</i>
<i>who you are</i>

3
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:47,879
<i>Anything your heart desires</i>
<i>will come to you</i>

4
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:52,475
<i>If your heart is</i>

5
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:57,455
<i>No request is too extreme</i>

6
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:03,156
<i>When you wish upon a star</i>

7
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:08,428
<i>As dreamers do</i>

8
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:12,631
<i>Fate is kind</i>

9
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,831
<i>She brings</i>

10
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,399
<i>To those who love</i>

11
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:20,537
<i>The sweet fulfillment</i>

12
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:28,349
<i>Of their secret longing</i>

13
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:38,429
<i>Like a bolt out of the blue</i>

14
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:45,961
<i>Fate steps in</i>
<i>and sees you through</i>

15
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:52,706
<i>When you wish upon a star</i>

16
00:01:52,779 --> 00:02:03,280
<i>Your dreams come true</i>

17
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,621
Pretty, huh?

18
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:10,254
I'll bet a lot of you folks
don't believe that...

19
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,026
about a wish coming true...
do you?

20
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,430
Well, I didn't, either.

21
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,128
Of course, I'm just a cricket

22
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,432
singing my way
from hearth to hearth,

23
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:22,407
but... let me tell you
what made me change my mind.

24
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,947
One night a long time...

25
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,250
Pardon me.

26
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,257
Wait till
I fix this thing here.

27
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,656
There.

28
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,753
One night a long time ago,

29
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,129
my travels took me
to a quaint little village.

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,031
It was a beautiful night.

31
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,627
The stars were shining
like diamonds

32
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,696
high above the roofs
of that sleepy old town.

33
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,799
Pretty as a picture.

34
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,980
As I wandered along
the crooked streets,

35
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,984
there wasn't a soul to be seen.

36
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,885
The only sign of life was
a lighted window

37
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,083
in the shop of a woodcarver
named Geppetto.

38
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,423
So... I hopped over...

39
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,095
...and looked in.

40
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,433
It was a shame to see a nice,
cheerful fire like that

41
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,995
goin' to waste.

42
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,700
So what do I do?

43
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,106
I go in.

44
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,682
I looked around.

45
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,213
Of course, being
in a strange place like that,

46
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,154
I didn't know what to expect.

47
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,194
A cricket can't be too careful,
you know.

48
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,697
Soon as I saw
there was no one about,

49
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,461
I made myself at home.

50
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,453
As I stood there warming my...
myself,

51
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,251
I took a look around.

52
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,588
Well, sir, you never saw
such a place...

53
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,097
the most fantastic clocks
you ever laid your eyes on,

54
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,428
and all carved out of wood.

55
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,459
And cute, little music boxes...
each one a work of art.

56
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,005
And shelf after shelf of toys
and...

57
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,474
and then something else
caught my eye...

58
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:38,840
a puppet.

59
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,436
You know... one of those
marionette things.

60
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,709
All strings and joints.

61
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,817
Cute little fella.

62
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,159
Goin' up!

63
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,091
Good piece of wood, too.

64
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,692
Well, now.

65
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,670
It won't take much longer.

66
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,967
Just a little more paint,
and he's all finished.

67
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,977
I think he'll be all right,

68
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,142
don't you, Figaro?

69
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,581
Beg pardon.

70
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,416
See?

71
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,122
That makes a big difference.

72
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,266
Very good.

73
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,565
Very, very...

74
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,900
Well, you can't please
everybody.

75
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:25,115
Now I have just the name
for you... Pinocchio.

76
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,150
Do you like it, Figaro?

77
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,822
No?

78
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,654
You do, don't you, Cleo?

79
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:38,794
Well, we'll leave it
to little wooden head.

80
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,730
Do you like it?

81
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,794
That settles it!

82
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,136
Pinocchio it is!

83
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,573
Come on, now!
We'll try you out.

84
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,111
Music, professor!

85
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,818
Take it easy, there!

86
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,090
Break it up, will ya?

87
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,894
Lot of downbeats in there.

88
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,070
<i>Little wooden head,</i>
<i>go play your part</i>

89
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,603
<i>Bring a little joy</i>
<i>to every heart</i>

90
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,617
<i>Little do you know,</i>
<i>and yet it's true</i>

91
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:36,485
<i>That I'm mighty proud</i>
<i>of you</i>

92
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,855
<i>Little wooden feet</i>
<i>and best of all</i>

93
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:43,987
<i>Little wooden seat</i>
<i>in case you fall</i>

94
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,190
How graceful!

95
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,792
<i>M y little wooden head</i>

96
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,434
Cleo, meet Pinocchio.

97
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,167
Say, "How do you do?"

98
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,840
Say hello to Figaro.

99
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,351
Up to mischief already!

100
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,958
You see what happens?

101
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,043
Up we go!

102
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,379
You're a cute little fellow.

103
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,213
And that smile...

104
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,685
You know, I...

105
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:20,324
You rascal.
Jealous, huh?

106
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,724
You know, Pinocchio,

107
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:26,163
I think Figaro is jealous
of you.

108
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,633
Oh-ho, don't worry, Figaro.

109
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,049
I wonder what time it is.

110
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,884
It's getting late.

111
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,492
Come now.
We go to bed.

112
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,552
Good night, Pinocchio.

113
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,292
Little funny face.

114
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:42,871
Good night, Cleo,
my little water baby.

115
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,342
You say good night, too.

116
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,320
Go on.

117
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,897
Now, go to sleep,
my little mermaid.

118
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,402
Good night.

119
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:27,215
This is my idea of comfort.

120
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,680
Silent comfort.

121
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:51,432
Look at him, Figaro.

122
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:57,645
He almost looks alive.

123
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:06,481
Wouldn't it be nice
if he was a real boy?

124
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:08,458
Oh, well.

125
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:10,289
Come on.

126
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:13,626
We go to sleep.

127
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:30,805
I forgot to open the window.

128
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:06,982
Oh, Figaro, look!

129
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:10,452
Look! A wishing star!

130
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:12,887
Starlight, star bright,

131
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,425
first star I see tonight...

132
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:18,326
I wish I may,
I wish I might

133
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:21,297
have the wish
I make tonight.

134
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:24,563
Figaro, you know what I wish?

135
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:33,542
I wish that my little Pinocchio
might be a real boy.

136
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:37,173
Wouldn't that be nice?
Just think!

137
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:40,081
A real boy!

138
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,051
A very lovely thought...

139
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,179
but not at all practical.

140
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,383
A real...

141
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,825
...boy.

142
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:12,135
Quiet!!

143
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:17,705
After all, enough's enough.

144
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,581
Now what's up?

145
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:39,630
Hey!
What's goin' on here?!

146
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:56,180
As I live and breathe...
a fairy!

147
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,650
Good Geppetto,

148
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:03,353
you have given so much happiness
to others.

149
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:06,396
You deserve to have
your wish come true.

150
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:12,467
Little puppet
made of pine...

151
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:14,698
wake.

152
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:17,104
The gift of life is thine.

153
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,377
What they can't do these days.

154
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,386
I can move!

155
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,583
I can talk!

156
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,820
I can walk!

157
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,730
Yes, Pinocchio.
I've given you life.

158
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:45,826
Why?

159
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:49,737
Because tonight Geppetto
wished for a real boy.

160
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:51,172
Am I a real boy?

161
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:52,436
No, Pinocchio.

162
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,206
To make Geppetto's wish
come true

163
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,247
will be entirely up to you.

164
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:58,111
Up to me?

165
00:16:58,182 --> 00:17:02,551
Prove yourself brave,
truthful, and unselfish,

166
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,020
and someday you will be
a real boy.

167
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,023
A real boy!

168
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:08,854
That won't be easy.

169
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:11,360
You must learn to choose
between right and wrong.

170
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:12,896
Right and wrong?

171
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:14,727
But how will I know?

172
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,823
How will he know?

173
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,663
Your conscience
will tell you.

174
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:18,895
What are conscience?

175
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,494
What are conscience?

176
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,163
Well, I'll tell ya!

177
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,538
A conscience is that still,
small voice

178
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,907
that people won't listen to.

179
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,776
That's just the trouble
with the world today.

180
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,246
Are you my conscience?

181
00:17:31,315 --> 00:17:32,907
Who, me?

182
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:36,750
Would you like to be
Pinocchio's conscience?

183
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:39,654
Well... I...

184
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:44,894
Very well.

185
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:46,657
What is your name?

186
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:49,325
Cricket's the name.

187
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,662
Jiminy Cricket.

188
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:52,225
Kneel, Mr. Cricket.

189
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:57,340
No tricks, now.

190
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:59,399
I dub you
Pinocchio's conscience,

191
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:02,708
Lord High Keeper of the
knowledge of right and wrong,

192
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,146
counselor in moments
of temptation,

193
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:08,549
and guide along
the straight and narrow path.

194
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,917
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.

195
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:14,515
Well! My, my!

196
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:19,455
Say, that's pretty swell!

197
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,794
Gee, thanks.

198
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:24,664
But don't I get
a badge or somethin'?

199
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:26,202
Well, we'll see.

200
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,567
You mean maybe I will?

201
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:28,832
I shouldn't wonder.

202
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:30,168
Make it a gold one?

203
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,640
Maybe.

204
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:35,008
Now, remember, Pinocchio,
be a good boy.

205
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,981
And always let your
conscience be your guide.

206
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:42,381
Goodbye, milady.

207
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:44,614
Goodbye!

208
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:51,384
Not bad, says I.

209
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:53,396
Oh, yeah.

210
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:55,455
Almost forgot about you.

211
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:58,001
Well, Pinoke...

212
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:00,629
Maybe you and I had better have
a little heart-to-heart talk.

213
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,502
Why?

214
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:05,098
Well, you want to be
a real boy, don't you?

215
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,304
All right.

216
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:09,175
Sit down, son.

217
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:15,514
Now, you see, the world
is full of temptations.

218
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:16,814
Temptations?

219
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:18,149
Yep... temptations.

220
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:21,623
They're the wrong things
that seem right at the time.

221
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:24,092
But even though
the right things

222
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:25,924
may seem wrong sometimes,

223
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:29,899
sometimes the wrong things
may be right

224
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:33,767
at the wrong time
or vice versa.

225
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:36,272
Understand?

226
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:40,539
But I'm gonna do right!

227
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:43,603
Attaboy, Pinoke.
And I'm gonna help you.

228
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:47,617
And anytime you need me,
you know, just whistle,

229
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:48,982
like this...

230
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,215
Like this?

231
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:54,256
No, no.
Try it again, Pinoke.

232
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:55,622
Like this?

233
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:58,626
No, son.

234
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:00,186
Now, listen.

235
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:05,699
That's it!

236
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,795
Come on, now!
Let's sing it!

237
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,933
<i>When you get in trouble and</i>

238
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,806
<i>You don 't know</i>
<i>right from wrong</i>

239
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:15,675
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

240
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:18,146
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

241
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:21,912
<i>When you meet temptation</i>
<i>and the urge is very strong</i>

242
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,977
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

243
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:26,148
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

244
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:29,058
<i>Not just a little squeak</i>

245
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:31,890
<i>Pucker up and blow</i>

246
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:34,658
<i>And if your</i>
<i>whistle's weak, yell</i>

247
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:35,664
Right!

248
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:38,031
<i>Take the straight</i>
<i>and narrow path</i>

249
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:40,002
<i>And if you start to slide</i>

250
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,971
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

251
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:44,132
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

252
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,938
<i>And always let your</i>
<i>conscience be your guide</i>

253
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:18,004
<i>Take the straight</i>
<i>and narrow path</i>

254
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:21,044
<i>And if you start to slide,</i>
<i>give a little whistle</i>

255
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:23,141
<i>Give a little whistle</i>

256
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:27,581
<i>And always let</i>
<i>your conscience be your guide</i>

257
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:32,016
<i>And always let</i>
<i>your conscience be your guide</i>

258
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:33,317
Look out, Pinoke!

259
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:40,362
Who's there?!

260
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:41,862
It's me!

261
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:44,195
Oh. It's me.

262
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:53,840
There's somebody in here!

263
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:16,094
Carefully, now, Figaro.

264
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:20,602
He might spring out on us
at any time.

265
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,514
He's in here somewhere.

266
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:39,555
Here I am!

267
00:22:59,075 --> 00:23:01,066
How did you get down here?

268
00:23:01,143 --> 00:23:02,701
I fell down.

269
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:04,803
Oh, you did, hmm?

270
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:07,611
You are talking!

271
00:23:08,718 --> 00:23:09,582
No!

272
00:23:09,652 --> 00:23:11,313
Yes!
And I can move, too!

273
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:14,584
No, no, no! You can't!
I'm dreaming in my sleep!

274
00:23:14,657 --> 00:23:18,525
Wake me up! Wake me up!

275
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:30,302
Now we see who's dreaming.

276
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:36,143
Go on... say something.

277
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,241
Gee, you're funny.

278
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:40,646
Do it again!

279
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:41,978
You do talk!

280
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:43,985
Yes!
The Blue Fairy came...

281
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:45,315
The Blue Fairy?

282
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:47,356
- And I got a conscience!
- A conscience?

283
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:51,587
And someday,
I'm gonna be a real boy!

284
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:53,720
A real boy!
It's my wish!

285
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:54,922
It's come true!

286
00:23:54,997 --> 00:23:56,487
Figaro, look!

287
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:58,760
He's alive! He can talk!

288
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,768
Say hello to Figaro.

289
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:02,997
Hello to Figaro.

290
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:10,034
I almost forgot!

291
00:24:10,112 --> 00:24:13,275
Look! It's Pinocchio!

292
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:17,513
She's my little water baby.
Isn't she cute?

293
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:19,349
Yeah. Cute.

294
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:28,029
This calls for a celebration!

295
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:29,189
Music!

296
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,161
You start one, Pinocchio!

297
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:55,613
Oh, boy! A party!

298
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:58,251
Mind if I cut in?

299
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:04,322
How 'bout sittin' out
the next one, babe, huh?

300
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:08,099
Let me out!
Let me out!

301
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,773
Come, Cleo!
It's time to party! Dance!

302
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:21,609
Nice!

303
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:27,513
<i>Gathering toys</i>

304
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:31,259
<i>For my little boy</i>

305
00:25:33,162 --> 00:25:35,255
Look! Pretty!

306
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:41,302
Where's a bucket?!

307
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,065
Get water!

308
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:44,731
Where's a bucket?

309
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:46,365
Here it is! I got it!
Here's water!

310
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:48,569
Here's some water!

311
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:49,906
Help! Where's water?

312
00:25:54,483 --> 00:25:56,713
That was close.

313
00:25:56,786 --> 00:26:01,314
Maybe we'd better go to bed
before something else happens.

314
00:26:08,064 --> 00:26:10,965
Little man,
you've had a busy night.

315
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:24,078
Now close your eyes
and go to sleep.

316
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:25,670
Why?

317
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:29,548
Oh, everybody has to sleep.

318
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:34,453
Figaro goes to sleep,
and Cleo and...

319
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:39,119
and besides, tomorrow
you've got to go to school.

320
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:40,787
Why?

321
00:26:40,863 --> 00:26:45,857
Oh, to learn things and...

322
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:48,460
and get smart.

323
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:49,697
Why?

324
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:54,406
Because.

325
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,695
Oh, look, Father!
Look!

326
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:54,759
Now, wait.
Stand still, now.

327
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:56,099
What are those?

328
00:27:56,172 --> 00:27:58,299
Huh? Oh, those.

329
00:27:58,374 --> 00:28:01,104
They are your schoolmates...
girls and boys.

330
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:03,338
- Now, get into this.
- Real boys?

331
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:04,344
Yes.

332
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:05,778
But hurry, now.

333
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:07,338
Wait, wait, wait!

334
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:08,576
Wait.

335
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:13,519
Here's an apple
for your teacher.

336
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:17,616
Now, turn around
and let me look you over.

337
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:22,091
Oh, yeah! Yes!

338
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:23,529
Here.

339
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,897
Run along, now.

340
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:31,473
Wait, wait!

341
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,236
Come back here, Figaro.

342
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:38,944
School is not for you.

343
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,107
Goodbye, Father!

344
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:44,152
Goodbye, son!
Hurry back!

345
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:55,159
Ah, Gideon, listen...
the merry laughter

346
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:58,997
of little, innocent children
wending their way to school.

347
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:03,164
Thirsty little minds rushing
to the fountain of knowledge.

348
00:29:04,173 --> 00:29:07,472
School...
a noble institution.

349
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:10,671
What would this
stupid world be without...

350
00:29:11,747 --> 00:29:15,012
Well, well, well!

351
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:20,018
So that old rascal's
back in town, eh?

352
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:23,422
Remember, Giddy, the time
I tied strings on you

353
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:26,120
and passed you off
as a puppet?

354
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:32,091
We nearly put one over
on that old gypsy that time.

355
00:29:36,338 --> 00:29:38,602
A little wooden boy.

356
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:39,936
Now, who...

357
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:41,499
A wooden boy!

358
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,814
Look, Giddy. Look.

359
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:50,113
It's amazing!

360
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:52,653
A live puppet without strings.

361
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:55,656
A thing like that ought to be
worth a fortune to someone.

362
00:29:55,724 --> 00:29:58,625
Now, let me see...

363
00:29:58,694 --> 00:30:00,628
That's it... Stromboli!

364
00:30:00,696 --> 00:30:03,221
Why, that fat, old faker
would give his...

365
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:04,698
Listen!

366
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:08,635
If we play our cards right,
we'll be on Easy Street,

367
00:30:08,704 --> 00:30:12,140
or my name
isn't Honest John.

368
00:30:12,207 --> 00:30:14,698
Quick!
We'll head him off.

369
00:30:30,092 --> 00:30:31,719
Now's our...

370
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:35,420
No, no, stupid.

371
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:38,193
Don't be crude.

372
00:30:38,267 --> 00:30:41,134
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.

373
00:30:41,203 --> 00:30:42,727
Ah, yes, Giddy,

374
00:30:42,805 --> 00:30:46,366
as I was saying to
the duchess only yesterday...

375
00:30:46,442 --> 00:30:46,509
Oh, how clumsy of me!

376
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:48,500
Oh, how clumsy of me!

377
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:50,044
Oh, my, my, my, my.

378
00:30:51,914 --> 00:30:53,939
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

379
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:57,213
Oh, I do hope
you're not injured.

380
00:30:57,286 --> 00:30:58,514
I'm all right.

381
00:30:58,587 --> 00:30:59,849
Oh, splendid.

382
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:03,721
Well, well.

383
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:06,352
Quite the scholar, I see.

384
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:09,556
Look, Giddy.
A man of letters.

385
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:11,657
Here's your book.

386
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:12,996
I'm going to school.

387
00:31:13,068 --> 00:31:15,366
School. Ah, yes.

388
00:31:15,437 --> 00:31:19,100
Then you haven't heard
of the easy road to success.

389
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:21,241
No?

390
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:24,643
I'm speaking, my boy,
of the theater!

391
00:31:24,713 --> 00:31:26,180
Here's your apple.

392
00:31:26,248 --> 00:31:28,910
Bright lights! Music!
Applause!

393
00:31:28,984 --> 00:31:30,679
Fame!

394
00:31:30,753 --> 00:31:32,880
- Fame?
- Yes!

395
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:36,584
And with that personality,
that profile, that physique,

396
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:40,459
why, he's a natural-born
actor, eh, Giddy?

397
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:43,123
- And I'm going...
- Straight to the top.

398
00:31:43,198 --> 00:31:45,723
Why, I can see your name
in lights...

399
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:48,861
lights six feet high...
what is your name?

400
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,571
P-l-N...

401
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:54,404
U-O...

402
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:56,707
P-I...

403
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:59,077
We're wasting precious time.

404
00:31:59,148 --> 00:32:01,241
Come. On to the theater!

405
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:04,751
<i>An actor's life for me</i>

406
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,050
<i>A high silk hat</i>
<i>and a silver cane</i>

407
00:32:07,122 --> 00:32:09,215
<i>A watch of gold</i>
<i>with a diamond chain</i>

408
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,920
<i>An actor's life is gay</i>

409
00:32:12,995 --> 00:32:14,986
<i>It's great to be a celebrity</i>

410
00:32:15,064 --> 00:32:17,396
<i>An actor's life for me</i>

411
00:32:35,384 --> 00:32:37,852
<i>An actor's life is fun</i>

412
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:43,716
Fine conscience
I turned out to be.

413
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:44,986
Late the first day.

414
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,550
Oh, well.

415
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:49,757
He can't get in much trouble
between here and school.

416
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:53,165
Oh, boy! A parade!

417
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:55,567
<i>An actor's life for me</i>

418
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:58,900
<i>An actor's life for me</i>

419
00:32:58,974 --> 00:33:01,306
<i>A wax mustache</i>
<i>and a beaver coat</i>

420
00:33:01,377 --> 00:33:02,810
<i>A pony cart and a billy goat</i>

421
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:04,675
Why, it's Pinoke!

422
00:33:04,747 --> 00:33:06,578
- Hey! Where you goin'?
- <i>An actor's life is fun</i>

423
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:09,311
<i>You wear your hair</i>
<i>in a pompadour</i>

424
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:11,785
<i>You ride around</i>
<i>in a coach and four</i>

425
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:13,412
Halt!

426
00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:15,616
- <i>An actor's life for me</i>
- Hold on, there! Pinoke!

427
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,525
<i>An actor's life for me</i>

428
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:21,392
<i>With clothes that come</i>
<i>from the finest shops</i>

429
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:22,896
<i>And lots of peanuts</i>
<i>and soda pops</i>

430
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:24,592
What was that?

431
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,464
Oh, it's Jiminy!

432
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:28,059
What you doin' up there?

433
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:29,695
Who? What? What?

434
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:32,263
Who? Up where?

435
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:36,801
Why, my boy, you must be
seeing things.

436
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:39,211
Oh, no.
That's my conscience.

437
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:42,717
Now, now, now.
Just calm down.

438
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:46,243
Why, there's nothing up there
to be afraid of.

439
00:34:03,806 --> 00:34:05,239
Over here.

440
00:34:05,307 --> 00:34:07,241
Over here.

441
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:10,271
I'm gonna be an actor!

442
00:34:10,345 --> 00:34:12,472
All right, son.
Take it easy, now.

443
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:14,709
Remember what I said
about temptation?

444
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:17,441
Well, that's him.

445
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,111
Oh, no, Jiminy!

446
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:21,486
That's Mr. Honest John.

447
00:34:21,557 --> 00:34:22,888
Honest John?

448
00:34:26,662 --> 00:34:28,926
Get me outta here!

449
00:34:36,105 --> 00:34:38,164
Get me outta here!

450
00:34:51,653 --> 00:34:52,745
All right, then.

451
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:56,154
Here's what we'll tell 'em...
you can't go to the theater.

452
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:58,090
Say thank you just the same.

453
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,823
You're sorry, but you've
got to go to school.

454
00:35:08,237 --> 00:35:10,364
Here they come, Pinoke.
Now, you tell 'em.

455
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:14,003
Oh, little boy...

456
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:15,373
Ah, there you are!

457
00:35:15,444 --> 00:35:16,968
Oh, where were we?

458
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:19,809
Ah, yes.
On to the theater!

459
00:35:19,882 --> 00:35:22,009
Goodbye, Jiminy! Goodbye!

460
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:23,881
Goodbye? Huh?!

461
00:35:23,952 --> 00:35:25,715
- <i>An actor's life for me</i>
- Goodbye?!

462
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:28,120
Hey, Pinoke!
You can't...

463
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,021
There he goes.

464
00:35:30,092 --> 00:35:31,582
Oh, what'll I do?

465
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,389
I'll run and tell his father.

466
00:35:33,462 --> 00:35:37,228
No. That would be snitchy.
I'll go after him myself.

467
00:35:43,105 --> 00:35:46,006
Ladies and gentlemen,

468
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:49,237
to conclude the performance
of this great show,

469
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:52,644
Stromboli the Master Showman...

470
00:35:52,714 --> 00:35:54,648
that's me...

471
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:57,514
and by special permission
of the management...

472
00:35:57,586 --> 00:36:00,714
that's me, too...

473
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:02,381
is presenting to you

474
00:36:02,457 --> 00:36:06,826
something you will absolutely
refuse to believe.

475
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,330
Well, looks like a sellout.

476
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:11,832
Introducing...

477
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,530
the only marionette
who can sing and dance

478
00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:21,838
absolutely without the aids
of strings!

479
00:36:24,746 --> 00:36:29,513
The one-and-only Pinocchio!

480
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:33,345
What a buildup.

481
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:46,224
<i>I've got no strings</i>
<i>to hold me</i>...

482
00:36:50,939 --> 00:36:53,100
Go ahead.
Make a fool of yourself.

483
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:55,870
Then maybe you'll listen
to your conscience.

484
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,356
<i>I've got no strings</i>
<i>to hold me down</i>

485
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:16,897
<i>To make me fret</i>
<i>or make me frown</i>

486
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:19,695
<i>I had strings,</i>
<i>but now I'm free</i>

487
00:37:19,768 --> 00:37:22,464
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

488
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,670
<i>That's the only way to be</i>

489
00:37:27,743 --> 00:37:32,908
<i>I want the world to know</i>
<i>nothing ever worries me</i>

490
00:37:32,981 --> 00:37:34,573
<i>I've got no strings,</i>
<i>so I have fun</i>

491
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,948
What I told you, huh?!

492
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,016
<i>They've got strings,</i>
<i>but you can see</i>

493
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:43,216
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

494
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:53,759
<i>You have no strings,</i>
<i>your arms is free</i>

495
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:56,269
<i>To love me</i>
<i>by the Zuider Zee</i>

496
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:58,499
<i>Ja, ja, ja,</i>
<i>if you would woo</i>

497
00:37:58,573 --> 00:38:00,598
<i>I'd bust my strings for you</i>

498
00:38:15,757 --> 00:38:17,782
<i>You've got no strings,</i>
<i>comme ci, comme ça</i>

499
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:20,157
<i>Your savoir-faire is</i>
<i>ooh la la</i>

500
00:38:20,228 --> 00:38:22,093
<i>I've got strings,</i>
<i>but entre nous</i>

501
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:24,462
<i>I'd cut my strings for you</i>

502
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:44,143
<i>Down where the Volga flows</i>

503
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:46,244
<i>There's a Russian rendezvous</i>

504
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:48,448
<i>Where me and Ivan go</i>

505
00:38:48,523 --> 00:38:50,821
<i>But I'd rather go</i>
<i>with you, hey</i>

506
00:39:24,826 --> 00:39:27,420
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

507
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:40,040
They like him.

508
00:39:40,108 --> 00:39:41,769
He's a success.

509
00:39:41,843 --> 00:39:45,040
Gosh, maybe I was wrong.

510
00:39:55,157 --> 00:39:56,920
Well...

511
00:39:56,992 --> 00:39:58,857
guess he won't need me anymore.

512
00:40:00,195 --> 00:40:02,459
What does an actor want
with a conscience anyway?

513
00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:13,670
What could have
happened to him?

514
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,477
Where could he be
at this hour?

515
00:40:20,082 --> 00:40:22,312
I'd better go out again
and look for him.

516
00:40:26,588 --> 00:40:28,055
And remember...

517
00:40:28,123 --> 00:40:31,820
nobody eats a bite...
until I find him.

518
00:40:56,451 --> 00:40:57,119
<i>I got no strings,</i>
<i>but I got the brain</i>

519
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,416
<i>I got no strings,</i>
<i>but I got the brain</i>

520
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:01,456
<i>I buy a new suit</i>
<i>and I swing the cane</i>

521
00:41:01,523 --> 00:41:04,720
<i>I eat the best</i>
<i>and I drink champagne</i>

522
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:07,353
<i>I got no strings on me</i>

523
00:41:09,498 --> 00:41:11,591
Bravo, Pinocchio!

524
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:13,031
They liked me.

525
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:14,568
200.

526
00:41:14,636 --> 00:41:16,297
You are sensational!

527
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:17,895
You mean I'm good?

528
00:41:17,973 --> 00:41:21,340
300.

529
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:23,377
You are colossal!

530
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:25,640
Does that mean I'm an actor?

531
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:31,476
Sure! I will push you
in the public's eye!

532
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:35,011
Your face... she will be
on everybody's tongue!

533
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,682
Will she?

534
00:41:36,758 --> 00:41:38,350
Yeah.

535
00:41:38,426 --> 00:41:40,417
What's this?!

536
00:41:50,038 --> 00:41:54,407
For you,
my little Pinocchio.

537
00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:56,876
For me? Gee, thanks!

538
00:41:56,945 --> 00:41:58,970
I'll run right home
and tell my father.

539
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:03,611
Home?

540
00:42:03,685 --> 00:42:05,209
Oh, sure!

541
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:07,084
Going home to your father!

542
00:42:08,323 --> 00:42:10,188
Oh, that is very comical!

543
00:42:10,258 --> 00:42:12,192
You mean it's funny?

544
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,524
Sure!

545
00:42:14,596 --> 00:42:16,325
I'll be back in the morning.

546
00:42:16,398 --> 00:42:17,729
Be back in the morning?!

547
00:42:19,134 --> 00:42:20,260
Going home!

548
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:27,967
There!

549
00:42:28,043 --> 00:42:30,637
This will be your home!

550
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:32,805
Where I can find you always.

551
00:42:32,881 --> 00:42:34,314
No! No! No!

552
00:42:34,382 --> 00:42:36,577
Yes! Yes! Yes!

553
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:39,643
To me... you are belonging.

554
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:42,053
We will tour the world.

555
00:42:42,123 --> 00:42:43,385
Paris...

556
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:44,891
London...

557
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,791
Monte Carlo...

558
00:42:46,861 --> 00:42:49,659
Constantinople!

559
00:42:49,731 --> 00:42:51,221
No! No!

560
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:52,732
Yes!

561
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:55,429
We start tonight!

562
00:42:59,274 --> 00:43:03,734
You will make lots of money...

563
00:43:03,812 --> 00:43:05,074
for me!

564
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:10,243
And when you are growing
too old,

565
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:12,309
you will make good...

566
00:43:12,387 --> 00:43:13,479
firewood!

567
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:17,223
Let me out of here!

568
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:19,351
I gotta get out!
You can't...

569
00:43:19,427 --> 00:43:20,826
Quiet!

570
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:25,730
Shut up before
I knock you silly!

571
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:29,734
Good night...

572
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:33,638
my little wooden gold mine.

573
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,407
No! No, wait!

574
00:43:40,482 --> 00:43:44,350
Let me out!
I'll tell my father!

575
00:43:46,755 --> 00:43:48,780
Get along, then!

576
00:43:57,699 --> 00:44:00,668
Ah, Jiminy, where are you?!

577
00:44:24,426 --> 00:44:26,758
Well, there he goes...

578
00:44:26,828 --> 00:44:30,821
sitting in the lap of luxury,
the world at his feet.

579
00:44:30,899 --> 00:44:34,835
Oh, well, I can always say
I knew him when.

580
00:44:37,138 --> 00:44:39,698
I'll just go
out of his life quietly.

581
00:44:46,748 --> 00:44:49,444
I would like to wish him luck,
though.

582
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:51,781
Sure. Why not?

583
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:08,035
It's me... your old friend
Jiminy, remember?

584
00:45:09,104 --> 00:45:11,299
Gee, I'm glad to see ya!

585
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:15,100
What's happened?!

586
00:45:15,176 --> 00:45:16,939
What did he do to you?

587
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:18,171
Oh, he was mad!

588
00:45:18,246 --> 00:45:20,806
He said he was gonna push
my face in everybody's eye!

589
00:45:20,882 --> 00:45:23,214
And just 'cause
I'm a goldbrick,

590
00:45:23,284 --> 00:45:25,445
he's gonna chop me
into firewood!

591
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,851
Oh, is that so?

592
00:45:26,921 --> 00:45:28,752
Now, don't you worry, son.

593
00:45:28,823 --> 00:45:32,725
I'll have you out of here
in no time at all.

594
00:45:32,794 --> 00:45:37,424
Why, this is just as easy
as rolling off a...

595
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,271
Kinda rusty.

596
00:45:50,412 --> 00:45:52,107
Needs a little oil.

597
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:55,182
Needs a little oil...

598
00:45:55,216 --> 00:45:57,411
Well, that's what I said.

599
00:46:07,462 --> 00:46:09,760
Must be one of the old models.

600
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:12,265
You mean you can't open it?

601
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:13,766
Yeah.

602
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,497
Looks pretty hopeless.

603
00:46:17,572 --> 00:46:20,006
It'll take a miracle
to get us out of here.

604
00:47:01,649 --> 00:47:05,016
A fine conscience
I turned out to be.

605
00:47:05,086 --> 00:47:07,418
I should've
listened to you, Jiminy.

606
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:09,480
No. It was my fault.

607
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:11,752
I shouldn't have
walked out on you.

608
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:14,818
Guess I'll never see
my father again.

609
00:47:16,898 --> 00:47:18,729
Oh, buck up, son.

610
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,734
It could be worse.

611
00:47:20,802 --> 00:47:22,497
Be cheerful...

612
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:23,730
like me!

613
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:33,070
Take it easy, son.

614
00:47:33,147 --> 00:47:35,638
Come on... blow.

615
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:38,416
Attaboy.

616
00:47:42,123 --> 00:47:44,182
Oh, well...

617
00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:47,194
It stopped raining, anyway.

618
00:47:47,262 --> 00:47:49,093
Hey, that star again!

619
00:47:49,163 --> 00:47:50,630
The lady!

620
00:47:50,698 --> 00:47:52,563
The fairy!

621
00:47:52,634 --> 00:47:54,295
What'll she say?

622
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:56,269
What'll I tell her?

623
00:47:56,337 --> 00:47:59,033
Well, you might
tell her the truth.

624
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:08,938
Why, Pinocchio...

625
00:48:10,184 --> 00:48:11,446
Hello.

626
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,146
Sir Jiminy...

627
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:17,624
Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.

628
00:48:17,692 --> 00:48:20,593
Pinocchio, why didn't
you go to school?

629
00:48:20,662 --> 00:48:21,959
School?

630
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,328
Well, I...

631
00:48:24,399 --> 00:48:25,661
Go ahead. Tell her.

632
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:28,634
I was going to school
till I met somebody.

633
00:48:28,703 --> 00:48:29,931
Met somebody?

634
00:48:30,004 --> 00:48:32,666
Yeah.
Two big monsters...

635
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,264
with big, green eyes.

636
00:48:36,945 --> 00:48:38,037
Why...

637
00:48:38,112 --> 00:48:41,104
Monsters?
Weren't you afraid?

638
00:48:41,182 --> 00:48:43,980
No, ma'am, but they tied me
in a big sack.

639
00:48:45,954 --> 00:48:48,218
You don't say!

640
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:49,847
And where was Sir Jiminy?

641
00:48:53,094 --> 00:48:54,527
Leave me out of this.

642
00:48:54,596 --> 00:48:57,190
They put him in a little sack.

643
00:48:57,265 --> 00:48:58,562
No!

644
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:00,430
Yeah!

645
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:02,833
- How did you escape?
- I didn't.

646
00:49:02,904 --> 00:49:04,565
They chopped me into firewood!

647
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:11,443
Oh, look! My nose!

648
00:49:11,512 --> 00:49:13,002
What's happened?

649
00:49:13,081 --> 00:49:15,447
Perhaps you haven't been
telling the truth, Pinocchio.

650
00:49:15,516 --> 00:49:17,677
- Perhaps?
- Oh, but I have.

651
00:49:17,752 --> 00:49:19,617
Every single word!

652
00:49:24,692 --> 00:49:27,991
Oh, please, help me.
I'm awful sorry.

653
00:49:28,062 --> 00:49:31,395
You see, Pinocchio, a lie
keeps growing and growing

654
00:49:31,466 --> 00:49:34,435
until it's as plain
as the nose on your face.

655
00:49:34,502 --> 00:49:36,834
She's right, Pinoke.
You better come clean.

656
00:49:36,904 --> 00:49:39,805
I'll never lie again...
honest, I won't.

657
00:49:39,874 --> 00:49:41,136
Please, Your Honor...

658
00:49:41,209 --> 00:49:43,074
I mean, Miss Fairy.

659
00:49:43,144 --> 00:49:45,044
Give him another chance...

660
00:49:45,113 --> 00:49:47,445
for my sake, will ya?

661
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:51,578
I'll forgive you this once,
but remember...

662
00:49:51,653 --> 00:49:53,746
a boy who won't be good

663
00:49:53,821 --> 00:49:56,551
might just as well
be made of wood.

664
00:49:56,624 --> 00:49:58,990
We'll be good, won't we?

665
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,621
Very well. But this is
the last time I can help you.

666
00:50:08,503 --> 00:50:11,233
Gee, look, Jiminy... my nose!

667
00:50:11,305 --> 00:50:14,274
Hey, we're free!
Come on, Pinoke.

668
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:17,209
<i>I buy a new suit</i>
<i>and I swing the cane</i>

669
00:50:17,278 --> 00:50:20,611
<i>I eat the best</i>
<i>and I drink champagne</i>

670
00:50:20,682 --> 00:50:22,274
<i>I got no strings on me</i>

671
00:50:23,851 --> 00:50:25,580
Goodbye, Mr... 

672
00:50:25,653 --> 00:50:26,711
Quiet!

673
00:50:26,788 --> 00:50:29,621
Let's get out of here
before something else happens.

674
00:50:40,268 --> 00:50:42,236
<i>An actor's life for me</i>

675
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,362
<i>A high silk hat</i>
<i>and a silver cane</i>

676
00:50:44,439 --> 00:50:46,600
<i>A watch of gold</i>
<i>with a diamond chain</i>

677
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:50,234
<i>An actor's life is gay</i>

678
00:50:50,311 --> 00:50:51,938
<i>It's great to be a celebrity</i>

679
00:50:52,046 --> 00:50:54,037
<i>An actor's life for me</i>

680
00:50:55,817 --> 00:50:59,082
And the dummy fell for it.

681
00:50:59,153 --> 00:51:01,087
Hook, line, and sinker!

682
00:51:05,393 --> 00:51:09,727
And he still thinks
we're his friends.

683
00:51:09,797 --> 00:51:12,493
And did Stromboli pay?

684
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:14,057
Plenty.

685
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,002
That shows you how low
Honest John will stoop...

686
00:51:26,814 --> 00:51:28,782
Now, Coachman...

687
00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:33,116
what's your proposition?

688
00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:34,347
Well...

689
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:40,794
How would you blokes like
to make some real money?

690
00:51:42,263 --> 00:51:45,721
Well!
And who do we have to...

691
00:51:47,101 --> 00:51:48,693
No, no.

692
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,795
Nothing like that.

693
00:51:50,872 --> 00:51:52,669
You see...

694
00:51:56,844 --> 00:52:01,213
I'm collecting
stupid little boys.

695
00:52:01,282 --> 00:52:03,216
Stupid little boys?

696
00:52:03,284 --> 00:52:05,184
You know, the disobedient ones

697
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:07,414
who want to play hooky
from school.

698
00:52:08,923 --> 00:52:11,187
And you see...

699
00:52:13,995 --> 00:52:15,622
Yes.

700
00:52:26,741 --> 00:52:29,676
And I takes 'em
to Pleasure Island.

701
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:32,144
Ah, Pleasure Island.

702
00:52:32,213 --> 00:52:33,737
Pleasure Island?!

703
00:52:33,815 --> 00:52:36,147
But the law!
Suppose they...

704
00:52:36,217 --> 00:52:39,414
No, no.
There's no risk.

705
00:52:39,487 --> 00:52:42,752
They never come back...

706
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:45,258
as boys!

707
00:52:51,732 --> 00:52:54,758
Now... I've got a coach load
leaving at midnight.

708
00:52:54,836 --> 00:52:56,963
We'll meet
at the crossroads...

709
00:52:57,038 --> 00:52:58,903
and no double-crossing!

710
00:52:58,973 --> 00:53:00,804
- No, sir.
- Scout around...

711
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:03,639
and any good prospects
you find, bring 'em to me.

712
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:05,303
- Yes, chief.
- I'll pay you well.

713
00:53:05,379 --> 00:53:06,607
I got plenty of gold.

714
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:07,670
Yes, yes.

715
00:53:08,316 --> 00:53:10,876
No, sir!
Nothing can stop me now!

716
00:53:10,952 --> 00:53:12,749
I'll make good this time.

717
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,946
You'd better!

718
00:53:14,022 --> 00:53:15,922
I will.
I'm going to school!

719
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,514
That's the stuff, Pinoke!

720
00:53:17,592 --> 00:53:19,617
I'd rather be smart
than be an actor.

721
00:53:19,694 --> 00:53:21,025
Now you're talkin'!

722
00:53:21,095 --> 00:53:23,962
Come on, slow-poke.
I'll race you home!

723
00:53:30,071 --> 00:53:32,938
Well, well.

724
00:53:33,007 --> 00:53:34,372
What's your rush?

725
00:53:34,442 --> 00:53:36,205
I gotta beat Jiminy home.

726
00:53:36,277 --> 00:53:37,301
Oh, hello.

727
00:53:37,378 --> 00:53:39,437
Well, how is the great actor?

728
00:53:39,514 --> 00:53:41,482
I don't want to be an actor.

729
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:43,039
Stromboli was terrible.

730
00:53:43,117 --> 00:53:44,277
- He was?
- Yeah.

731
00:53:44,352 --> 00:53:46,081
He locked me in a birdcage.

732
00:53:46,154 --> 00:53:47,121
He did?

733
00:53:47,188 --> 00:53:49,486
And I learned my lesson.
I'm going...

734
00:53:49,557 --> 00:53:52,993
Oh, you poor, poor boy.
You must be a nervous wreck.

735
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:55,962
That's it!
You are a nervous wreck!

736
00:53:56,964 --> 00:53:59,489
We must diagnose this case
at once.

737
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:01,694
Quick, doctor, your notebook.

738
00:54:03,438 --> 00:54:05,565
Bless my soul.

739
00:54:09,343 --> 00:54:11,243
My, my.

740
00:54:11,312 --> 00:54:13,143
Just as I thought.

741
00:54:13,214 --> 00:54:14,909
A slight touch
of monetary complications

742
00:54:15,016 --> 00:54:16,574
with bucolic semilunar
contraptions

743
00:54:16,651 --> 00:54:18,243
of the flying trapezes.

744
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:22,850
Say "hippopotamus."

745
00:54:22,924 --> 00:54:24,152
Hippopotamus.

746
00:54:24,225 --> 00:54:25,522
I knew it!

747
00:54:25,593 --> 00:54:27,288
Compound transmission
of the pandemonium

748
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:30,922
with percussion and spasmodic
frantic disintegration.

749
00:54:30,998 --> 00:54:32,863
Close your eyes.
What do you see?

750
00:54:32,934 --> 00:54:33,901
Nothing.

751
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:36,061
- Open 'em. Now what do you see?
- Spots.

752
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:39,703
Now, that heart.

753
00:54:39,774 --> 00:54:43,210
Ooh, my goodness!

754
00:54:43,277 --> 00:54:46,337
A palpating syncopation
of the killer diller

755
00:54:46,414 --> 00:54:49,042
with a wicky-wacky stamping
of the boy-joy.

756
00:54:49,117 --> 00:54:50,846
Quick, doctor, that report!

757
00:54:52,787 --> 00:54:55,312
This makes it perfectly clear!

758
00:54:55,389 --> 00:55:00,725
My boy,
you... are... allergic.

759
00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:02,228
Allergic?

760
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:04,389
Yes, and there is
only one cure.

761
00:55:04,432 --> 00:55:07,094
A vacation on Pleasure Island!

762
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:08,635
Pleasure Island?

763
00:55:08,703 --> 00:55:11,433
Yes... that happy land
of carefree boys

764
00:55:11,506 --> 00:55:13,667
where every day's a holiday!

765
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:15,333
But I can't go.

766
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:17,673
Why, of course you can go!

767
00:55:17,745 --> 00:55:20,179
I'm giving you my ticket.

768
00:55:22,183 --> 00:55:23,207
Here.

769
00:55:23,284 --> 00:55:25,309
Thanks! But I'm...

770
00:55:26,554 --> 00:55:27,782
I insist!

771
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:29,482
Your health comes first.

772
00:55:29,557 --> 00:55:32,924
Come! The coach departs
at midnight!

773
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:37,091
<i>It's Pleasure Isle for me</i>

774
00:55:37,165 --> 00:55:39,030
<i>Where every day is a holiday</i>

775
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,193
<i>And kids have nothing</i>
<i>to do but play</i>

776
00:55:44,272 --> 00:55:46,263
Now, where do you suppose he...

777
00:55:48,276 --> 00:55:50,403
Hey, come back!

778
00:56:03,658 --> 00:56:05,023
Well...

779
00:56:06,527 --> 00:56:09,462
here we go again.

780
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,464
My name's Lampwick.

781
00:56:11,532 --> 00:56:12,965
What's yours?

782
00:56:14,635 --> 00:56:16,865
You ever been
to Pleasure Island?

783
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:18,963
But Mr. Honest John gave me...

784
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,474
Me neither, but they say
it's a swell joint...

785
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:23,203
no school, no cops.

786
00:56:23,277 --> 00:56:26,542
You can tear the joint apart
and nobody says a word.

787
00:56:26,614 --> 00:56:27,911
Honest John gave me...

788
00:56:28,015 --> 00:56:30,916
Loaf around, plenty to eat,
plenty to drink,

789
00:56:30,985 --> 00:56:32,213
and it's all free.

790
00:56:32,286 --> 00:56:33,275
Honest John...

791
00:56:33,354 --> 00:56:37,313
Boy, that's the place.
I can hardly wait.

792
00:57:14,929 --> 00:57:16,897
Right here, boys!
Right here!

793
00:57:16,964 --> 00:57:19,990
Get your cake, pie,
dill pickles, and ice cream!

794
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:22,092
Eat all you can!
Be a glutton!

795
00:57:22,169 --> 00:57:24,637
Stuff yourselves!
It's all free, boys!

796
00:57:24,705 --> 00:57:27,367
It's all free!
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

797
00:57:27,441 --> 00:57:29,500
The Rough House!
The Rough House!

798
00:57:29,577 --> 00:57:32,375
It's the roughest, toughest
joint you ever seen!

799
00:57:32,446 --> 00:57:34,414
Come in and pick a fight,
boys!

800
00:57:34,482 --> 00:57:35,949
Oh, boy, a scrap!

801
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:38,349
Come on, let's go in and poke
somebody in the nose.

802
00:57:38,419 --> 00:57:39,351
Why?

803
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,944
Aw, just for the fun of it.

804
00:57:41,022 --> 00:57:42,922
Okay, Lampy.

805
00:57:45,126 --> 00:57:46,457
Tobacco Row!
Tobacco Row!

806
00:57:46,527 --> 00:57:48,893
Get your cigars, cigarettes,
and chewing tobacco!

807
00:57:48,963 --> 00:57:50,794
Come in
and smoke your heads off!

808
00:57:50,865 --> 00:57:52,730
There's nobody here
to stop you!

809
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,598
There's somethin'... phony
about all this.

810
00:57:58,673 --> 00:58:00,732
I've gotta get him
outta here.

811
00:58:00,808 --> 00:58:02,503
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry!

812
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:04,544
See the model home.
It's open for destruction.

813
00:58:04,578 --> 00:58:08,139
And it's all yours, boys!
It's all yours!

814
00:58:12,753 --> 00:58:13,981
What'd I tell ya?

815
00:58:14,055 --> 00:58:15,750
Ain't this a swell joint?

816
00:58:15,823 --> 00:58:19,054
Yeah! Bein' bad's
a lot of fun, ain't it?

817
00:58:19,126 --> 00:58:20,115
Yeah, uh-huh.

818
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:22,355
Get a load of that
stained-glass window.

819
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:30,662
All right, now,
hop to it, you blokes.

820
00:58:30,738 --> 00:58:32,569
Come on! Come on!

821
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,609
Shut the doors
and lock 'em tight!

822
00:58:35,676 --> 00:58:38,907
Now get below
and get them crates ready.

823
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:41,742
Give a bad boy enough rope,

824
00:58:41,816 --> 00:58:44,580
and he'll soon make
a jackass of himself.

825
00:59:01,369 --> 00:59:03,394
Where is everybody?

826
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,000
Place is like a graveyard.

827
00:59:09,076 --> 00:59:11,567
I don't like the looks
of this.

828
00:59:16,817 --> 00:59:18,808
Hey, where are you?!

829
00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:38,561
Where do you suppose all
the kids went to, Lampwick?

830
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:41,904
They're around here somewheres.
What do you care?

831
00:59:44,078 --> 00:59:46,842
You're having a good time,
ain't ya?

832
00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:48,814
I sure am.

833
00:59:48,883 --> 00:59:52,250
Oh, boy. This is the life,
huh, Pinokey?

834
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:53,809
Yeah.

835
00:59:53,888 --> 00:59:56,686
It sure is.

836
00:59:56,757 --> 01:00:00,659
Ah, you smoke
like me grandmother.

837
01:00:00,728 --> 01:00:03,162
Come on, take a big drag!

838
01:00:03,264 --> 01:00:04,629
Like this.

839
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:09,367
Okay, Lampy.

840
01:00:26,554 --> 01:00:28,283
Some fun, huh, kid?

841
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,488
Okay, Slats, your shot.

842
01:00:46,907 --> 01:00:50,240
What's the matter, Slats?
Losin' your grip?

843
01:00:54,648 --> 01:00:56,707
So this is where I find you!

844
01:00:56,784 --> 01:00:58,877
How do you ever expect to be
a real boy?!

845
01:00:58,953 --> 01:01:02,218
Look at yourself... smokin'!

846
01:01:02,289 --> 01:01:03,415
Playin' pool!

847
01:01:03,491 --> 01:01:05,584
You're comin' right home
with me this minute!

848
01:01:05,659 --> 01:01:09,254
Hey... who's the beetle?

849
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:10,422
Put me down!

850
01:01:11,732 --> 01:01:12,994
He's my conscience.

851
01:01:13,067 --> 01:01:15,092
He tells me what's
right and wrong.

852
01:01:15,169 --> 01:01:16,363
What?!

853
01:01:16,437 --> 01:01:19,497
You mean to tell me you take
orders from a grasshopper?!

854
01:01:19,573 --> 01:01:20,597
Grasshopper?!

855
01:01:20,674 --> 01:01:22,801
Look here,
you ignorant young pup!

856
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:25,641
It wouldn't hurt you to take
orders from your grasshopper...

857
01:01:25,713 --> 01:01:27,908
your conscience...
if you have one.

858
01:01:28,015 --> 01:01:29,573
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

859
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:32,244
Screwball
in the corner pocket.

860
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:45,289
Why, you young hoodlum,

861
01:01:45,366 --> 01:01:48,699
I'll knock your block off!

862
01:01:53,641 --> 01:01:56,235
Why, I'll take you apart
and put you back together!

863
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,278
Oh, don't hurt him, Jiminy.
He's my best friend.

864
01:01:58,345 --> 01:02:02,179
Why, I'll...
Your best friend?!

865
01:02:02,249 --> 01:02:06,583
And what am I?
Just your conscience.

866
01:02:06,654 --> 01:02:10,112
Okay, that settles it.

867
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:11,282
But, Jiminy...

868
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:14,293
You buttered your bread.
Now sleep in it!

869
01:02:23,437 --> 01:02:25,871
Go on, laugh!
Make a jackass outta yourself!

870
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,067
I am through!
This is the end.

871
01:02:28,142 --> 01:02:29,609
But, Jiminy...

872
01:02:29,677 --> 01:02:32,373
Lampwick says
a guy only lives once.

873
01:02:34,148 --> 01:02:37,584
Come on! Come on!
Let him go!

874
01:02:44,959 --> 01:02:46,358
Burns me up.

875
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:48,827
After all I tried to do
for him.

876
01:02:48,896 --> 01:02:53,595
Who's his conscience anyway...
me or that hoodlum Lampwick?

877
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:54,895
I've had enough of this.

878
01:02:54,969 --> 01:02:56,937
I'm taking the next boat
outta here.

879
01:02:57,004 --> 01:02:59,097
Open up that door.
Open up!

880
01:02:59,173 --> 01:03:00,470
I want to go home!

881
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:09,282
Come on, you blokes!
Keep her moving!

882
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:13,081
Lively there, now.
We haven't got all night!

883
01:03:16,023 --> 01:03:19,288
Where'd all the donkeys
come from?

884
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,954
Come on! Come on!
Let's have another!

885
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,293
And what's your name?

886
01:03:27,201 --> 01:03:29,032
Okay, you'll do.

887
01:03:29,103 --> 01:03:30,400
I n you go!

888
01:03:30,471 --> 01:03:33,463
You boys will bring
a nice price!

889
01:03:34,475 --> 01:03:36,136
All right, next!

890
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:39,976
And what might your name be?

891
01:03:41,715 --> 01:03:43,808
So you can talk.

892
01:03:43,884 --> 01:03:45,181
Yes, sir.

893
01:03:45,252 --> 01:03:48,483
I want to go home to my mama!

894
01:03:48,555 --> 01:03:51,319
Take him back!
He can still talk!

895
01:03:51,392 --> 01:03:56,091
Please, please, I don't want
to be a donkey!

896
01:03:56,163 --> 01:03:57,858
Let me outta here!

897
01:03:57,931 --> 01:03:59,159
Quiet!

898
01:03:59,233 --> 01:04:03,329
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it!

899
01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:04,393
Boys?

900
01:04:04,471 --> 01:04:06,405
So that's...

901
01:04:09,075 --> 01:04:10,940
Hear that beetle talk...

902
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:14,503
you'd think somethin'
was gonna happen to us.

903
01:04:19,853 --> 01:04:21,184
Conscience.

904
01:04:28,762 --> 01:04:30,787
Where does he get that stuff?

905
01:04:30,864 --> 01:04:33,856
"How do ya ever expect
to be a real boy?"

906
01:04:33,934 --> 01:04:36,266
What's he think
I look like...

907
01:04:36,336 --> 01:04:37,735
a jackass?

908
01:04:37,804 --> 01:04:39,465
You sure do!

909
01:04:43,143 --> 01:04:45,703
Hey, you laugh like a donkey!

910
01:04:49,382 --> 01:04:51,043
Did that come outta me?

911
01:04:59,826 --> 01:05:01,088
What the...

912
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:02,594
What's goin' on?!

913
01:05:05,198 --> 01:05:06,631
I've been double-crossed!

914
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:07,894
Help! Help!

915
01:05:07,968 --> 01:05:09,435
Somebody help!

916
01:05:09,502 --> 01:05:11,163
I've been framed!

917
01:05:11,238 --> 01:05:12,637
Help!

918
01:05:12,706 --> 01:05:14,298
Please, you've gotta help me!

919
01:05:14,374 --> 01:05:15,671
Be a pal!

920
01:05:15,742 --> 01:05:17,869
Call that beetle!
Call anybody!

921
01:05:21,014 --> 01:05:22,345
Mama!

922
01:05:22,415 --> 01:05:26,351
Mama!

923
01:05:42,569 --> 01:05:44,002
What's happened?!

924
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:46,163
I hope I'm not too late!

925
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,332
What'll I do?!

926
01:05:54,547 --> 01:05:56,481
Oh, Jiminy, help!

927
01:05:56,549 --> 01:05:58,710
Quick!
The kids! The boys!

928
01:05:58,785 --> 01:06:00,446
They're all donkeys!

929
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,147
You too!

930
01:06:02,222 --> 01:06:03,382
Come on, quick!

931
01:06:03,456 --> 01:06:06,050
Before you get any worse!

932
01:06:06,126 --> 01:06:08,924
This way, Pinoke!
It's the only way out!

933
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:20,735
Hurry up...
before they see us!

934
01:06:22,776 --> 01:06:24,505
You gotta jump!

935
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:50,098
You all right?

936
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:51,535
Sure.

937
01:06:51,604 --> 01:06:54,164
I thought we'd never make it.

938
01:06:55,508 --> 01:06:58,341
Certainly feels good
to be back on...

939
01:06:58,411 --> 01:07:01,175
dry land.

940
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,216
Come on. Let's get home.

941
01:07:04,284 --> 01:07:06,718
Father! Father, I'm home!

942
01:07:06,786 --> 01:07:09,118
We're home, Mr. Geppetto!
Home again!

943
01:07:09,189 --> 01:07:12,283
It's me... Pinocchio!
I'm home to stay!

944
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:15,726
Here he is, Mr. Geppetto!
Home at last!

945
01:07:15,795 --> 01:07:19,128
Hey, maybe he's asleep.

946
01:07:20,867 --> 01:07:22,459
Father!

947
01:07:22,535 --> 01:07:25,095
Father, it's me!

948
01:07:25,171 --> 01:07:28,436
Pinoke, come here.

949
01:07:28,508 --> 01:07:29,805
Look.

950
01:07:29,876 --> 01:07:31,309
He ain't here.

951
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:34,814
He's gone.

952
01:07:34,881 --> 01:07:37,145
Yeah, and Figaro.

953
01:07:37,217 --> 01:07:39,412
And Cleo, too.

954
01:07:43,757 --> 01:07:46,783
Maybe somethin' awful
happened to him.

955
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:50,489
Don't worry, son.
He probably hasn't gone far.

956
01:08:00,774 --> 01:08:01,741
It's a message.

957
01:08:01,808 --> 01:08:02,740
What's it say?

958
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:04,174
It's about your father.

959
01:08:04,244 --> 01:08:05,176
Where is he?

960
01:08:05,245 --> 01:08:07,509
Why, it says here...

961
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:11,448
he went looking for you,
and he was swallowed by a whale.

962
01:08:11,518 --> 01:08:12,780
Swallowed by a whale?!

963
01:08:12,852 --> 01:08:14,217
Yeah...

964
01:08:14,287 --> 01:08:15,879
A whale?!

965
01:08:15,955 --> 01:08:17,820
A whale named Monstro!

966
01:08:17,891 --> 01:08:18,949
Oh, he's...

967
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:20,788
But wait. He's alive.

968
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,122
Alive? Where?

969
01:08:22,195 --> 01:08:25,460
Inside the whale
at the bottom of the sea.

970
01:08:25,532 --> 01:08:27,466
Bottom of the sea?!

971
01:08:27,534 --> 01:08:29,365
Hey! Where you goin'?!

972
01:08:29,436 --> 01:08:31,461
I'm going to find him!

973
01:08:31,538 --> 01:08:33,733
But, Pinoke, are you crazy?!

974
01:08:33,807 --> 01:08:36,332
Don't you realize
he's in a whale?

975
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:38,138
I gotta go to him.

976
01:08:38,211 --> 01:08:40,509
Hey, Pinoke! Wait!

977
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:42,844
Listen here, son!

978
01:08:44,717 --> 01:08:47,845
But this Monstro...
I've heard of him.

979
01:08:47,921 --> 01:08:49,411
He's a whale of a whale!

980
01:08:49,489 --> 01:08:51,821
Why, he swallows
whole ships alive!

981
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:53,756
Tie it good and tight, now.

982
01:08:53,827 --> 01:08:56,318
And besides, it's dangerous.

983
01:08:56,396 --> 01:08:57,658
Bye, Jiminy.

984
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:59,197
Goodbye?

985
01:08:59,265 --> 01:09:02,996
I may be live bait down there,
but I'm with ya. Come on.

986
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:05,003
Let's go.

987
01:09:05,071 --> 01:09:08,939
Look out below!

988
01:09:15,648 --> 01:09:18,913
Gangway down there!

989
01:09:26,226 --> 01:09:30,322
Gee... what a big place!

990
01:09:41,674 --> 01:09:43,403
Come on, Jiminy!

991
01:09:43,476 --> 01:09:44,773
All right.

992
01:09:44,844 --> 01:09:47,142
Soon as I take on
some ballast.

993
01:09:47,213 --> 01:09:49,272
One side, sister.

994
01:09:54,053 --> 01:09:56,817
Well, so long.

995
01:10:02,028 --> 01:10:04,189
Put it in the wrong end.

996
01:10:10,436 --> 01:10:13,405
No more privacy
than a goldfish.

997
01:10:13,473 --> 01:10:16,465
Ooh! Chilly!

998
01:10:20,246 --> 01:10:22,271
Father!

999
01:10:32,659 --> 01:10:34,320
Father!

1000
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:43,659
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!

1001
01:10:43,736 --> 01:10:46,364
Father!

1002
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:48,430
Father!

1003
01:10:48,508 --> 01:10:51,204
He ain't my father.

1004
01:10:54,514 --> 01:10:55,503
Hey, what the...

1005
01:10:58,184 --> 01:10:59,208
Let go!

1006
01:10:59,285 --> 01:11:02,846
Run along,
you little... squirt.

1007
01:11:02,922 --> 01:11:05,220
What's the matter, kid?
I was only...

1008
01:11:07,026 --> 01:11:10,154
We were only looking
for Monstro.

1009
01:11:11,297 --> 01:11:12,821
That got 'em.

1010
01:11:14,067 --> 01:11:16,035
Father!

1011
01:11:24,944 --> 01:11:27,504
Father!

1012
01:11:30,216 --> 01:11:31,979
Hello.

1013
01:11:37,123 --> 01:11:39,717
Can you tell me
where we can find Monstro?

1014
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:41,350
Will ya?

1015
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:45,158
Gee. They're scared.

1016
01:11:48,468 --> 01:11:50,663
Pardon me, Pearl.

1017
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:55,699
Are you acquainted
with Monstro, the whale?

1018
01:12:02,148 --> 01:12:04,082
Whoa, hold it, there.

1019
01:12:13,126 --> 01:12:15,617
Father!

1020
01:12:18,931 --> 01:12:20,455
One side there, son.

1021
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:22,728
Come on, boys, break it up.

1022
01:12:22,802 --> 01:12:24,201
Break it up, now.

1023
01:12:27,206 --> 01:12:29,731
Hey, what the...

1024
01:12:29,809 --> 01:12:32,209
Quit shovin', now.

1025
01:12:32,278 --> 01:12:33,677
Don't...

1026
01:12:33,746 --> 01:12:35,873
Take it easy.
Take it easy, there.

1027
01:12:42,455 --> 01:12:45,049
Whoo, whoo, whoo, there.

1028
01:12:46,292 --> 01:12:47,691
Steady there, Nellie.

1029
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,728
Go ahead, Pinoke.
Ask them.

1030
01:12:49,796 --> 01:12:54,062
Could any of you tell me
where to find Monstro?

1031
01:12:54,133 --> 01:12:57,193
Whoa, boy! Whoa! Hey!

1032
01:12:59,605 --> 01:13:01,732
Thanks a lot.

1033
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:06,779
Father!

1034
01:13:06,846 --> 01:13:09,144
Father!

1035
01:13:51,657 --> 01:13:55,115
Not a bite for days.

1036
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:04,295
We can't hold out much longer.

1037
01:14:11,711 --> 01:14:19,482
I never thought it would end
this way, Figaro...

1038
01:14:19,552 --> 01:14:22,146
starving to death...

1039
01:14:22,221 --> 01:14:26,317
in the belly of a whale.

1040
01:14:26,392 --> 01:14:29,225
My poor little Pinocchio.

1041
01:14:31,397 --> 01:14:34,298
He was such a good boy.

1042
01:14:35,334 --> 01:14:38,326
It's hopeless, Figaro.

1043
01:14:42,642 --> 01:14:46,009
There isn't a fish left.

1044
01:14:46,078 --> 01:14:49,445
If the monster doesn't
wake up soon...

1045
01:14:49,515 --> 01:14:53,007
I'm afraid we are done for.

1046
01:15:13,606 --> 01:15:16,200
Here they come!

1047
01:15:16,275 --> 01:15:17,333
Tuna!

1048
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:19,435
Oh, tuna fish!

1049
01:15:22,615 --> 01:15:25,311
Food! We'll eat!

1050
01:15:25,384 --> 01:15:28,547
Here's a big one.

1051
01:15:28,621 --> 01:15:32,557
Get them in there, Figaro!

1052
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:34,889
Wait!

1053
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,622
Wait a minute!
Have you seen...

1054
01:15:43,269 --> 01:15:45,863
Oh, we gotta get out of here!

1055
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:56,915
Come on, Pinoke,
don't wait for me!

1056
01:15:58,184 --> 01:16:00,118
Never saw so many!

1057
01:16:08,761 --> 01:16:10,922
Here's another one!

1058
01:16:10,996 --> 01:16:12,930
Enough for weeks!

1059
01:16:12,998 --> 01:16:14,590
Here's a big one.

1060
01:16:22,908 --> 01:16:25,274
Keep them in there, Figaro!

1061
01:16:58,444 --> 01:17:00,708
Hey, blubber mouth, open up!

1062
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,372
I gotta get in there!

1063
01:17:02,448 --> 01:17:05,383
It looks like
the last of them.

1064
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:13,621
Here's a big one!
Only a few left!

1065
01:17:13,692 --> 01:17:15,660
We gotta work fast!

1066
01:17:15,728 --> 01:17:16,660
Hey!

1067
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:19,630
Here's another one!

1068
01:17:19,698 --> 01:17:21,063
Hey, Father!

1069
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:22,065
Father!

1070
01:17:22,134 --> 01:17:24,193
Don't bother me now,
Pinocchio!

1071
01:17:26,906 --> 01:17:27,838
Father!

1072
01:17:27,907 --> 01:17:30,137
My son!

1073
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:33,406
Hey, Father! Here I am!

1074
01:17:34,814 --> 01:17:36,975
Oh, oh, yes!

1075
01:17:37,049 --> 01:17:38,516
My boy.

1076
01:17:38,584 --> 01:17:40,848
I'm so happy to see you!

1077
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,820
Me, too, Father.

1078
01:17:50,162 --> 01:17:51,322
You're here, too.

1079
01:17:51,397 --> 01:17:52,557
Yes.

1080
01:17:52,631 --> 01:17:55,429
We all are together again.

1081
01:17:56,435 --> 01:17:58,596
Ooh, you are soaking wet.

1082
01:17:58,671 --> 01:17:59,603
Yes, Father.

1083
01:17:59,672 --> 01:18:01,765
You mustn't catch cold.

1084
01:18:01,841 --> 01:18:03,103
But I came to see you!

1085
01:18:03,175 --> 01:18:05,541
You know, you shouldn't
have come down here.

1086
01:18:05,611 --> 01:18:06,543
But, Father...

1087
01:18:06,612 --> 01:18:08,603
But I'm awfully glad
to see you.

1088
01:18:08,681 --> 01:18:10,876
Let me take your hat.

1089
01:18:15,821 --> 01:18:18,119
What's the matter?

1090
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:19,953
Those ears!

1091
01:18:20,025 --> 01:18:21,549
Ears?

1092
01:18:21,627 --> 01:18:23,288
Oh, these.

1093
01:18:24,597 --> 01:18:25,996
Oh, that's nothing.

1094
01:18:26,065 --> 01:18:28,295
I got a tail, too!

1095
01:18:32,471 --> 01:18:36,066
What's happened to you?

1096
01:18:36,141 --> 01:18:39,304
Well, I...

1097
01:18:39,378 --> 01:18:42,074
Oh, never mind now.

1098
01:18:42,147 --> 01:18:44,775
Old Geppetto has
his little wooden head.

1099
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,148
Nothing else matters.

1100
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:50,154
I gotta get in.
My pal's in there!

1101
01:18:50,222 --> 01:18:53,885
Come on, ya big moose,
open up, I tell ya!

1102
01:18:53,959 --> 01:18:55,187
Cut it out!

1103
01:18:57,229 --> 01:19:00,824
Go on!
Beat it, ya buzzards!

1104
01:19:02,101 --> 01:19:04,797
Get out?
Oh, no, no, son.

1105
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:06,895
I've tried every way.

1106
01:19:06,972 --> 01:19:09,839
Why, I even built a raft!

1107
01:19:09,909 --> 01:19:11,501
A raft?

1108
01:19:11,577 --> 01:19:12,601
That's it.

1109
01:19:12,678 --> 01:19:13,736
We'll take the raft,

1110
01:19:13,812 --> 01:19:15,837
and when the whale
opens his mouth...

1111
01:19:15,915 --> 01:19:18,543
No, no, no, no.
Now listen, son.

1112
01:19:18,617 --> 01:19:22,246
He only opens his mouth
when he's eating.

1113
01:19:22,321 --> 01:19:24,789
Then everything comes in.

1114
01:19:24,857 --> 01:19:26,415
Nothing goes out.

1115
01:19:26,492 --> 01:19:28,756
It's hopeless, Pinocchio.

1116
01:19:28,827 --> 01:19:30,761
Come, we'll make a nice fire,

1117
01:19:30,829 --> 01:19:32,763
and we'll cook
some of the fish.

1118
01:19:32,831 --> 01:19:34,492
A fire! That's it!

1119
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:36,659
Yes, and then we'll all
eat again.

1120
01:19:36,735 --> 01:19:37,827
A great big fire!

1121
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:39,268
Lots of smoke!

1122
01:19:39,338 --> 01:19:41,329
Smoke? Oh, yeah, sure.

1123
01:19:41,407 --> 01:19:43,307
A smoked fish
will taste good.

1124
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:44,433
Quick... some wood!

1125
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:45,875
Pinocchio, not the chair!

1126
01:19:45,945 --> 01:19:48,641
Hurry, Father! More wood!

1127
01:19:48,714 --> 01:19:51,046
Oh, what will we sit on
if we...

1128
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:53,346
We won't need it!
We're getting out!

1129
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,179
Getting out? But how?

1130
01:19:57,256 --> 01:19:59,417
We'll make him sneeze!

1131
01:19:59,491 --> 01:20:01,152
Make him sneeze?

1132
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:05,959
Ohh, that will make him mad!

1133
01:20:26,819 --> 01:20:29,515
Well, it's about time!

1134
01:20:33,258 --> 01:20:37,354
- It won't work!
- Hurry, Father!

1135
01:20:37,429 --> 01:20:38,953
Climb aboard!

1136
01:20:39,031 --> 01:20:40,828
We'll never get by
those teeth!

1137
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:42,366
Yes, we will!

1138
01:20:42,434 --> 01:20:46,370
Hey, which way you goin'?!
Wait for me!

1139
01:20:46,438 --> 01:20:49,373
Hang on! Here we go!

1140
01:20:57,016 --> 01:21:00,645
Gesundheit.

1141
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:01,947
We are going back!

1142
01:21:02,021 --> 01:21:04,421
No, we'll make it!
Faster! Faster!

1143
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:09,419
It's no use!
Here it goes!

1144
01:21:17,036 --> 01:21:19,266
We made it!

1145
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:28,077
Look, now he is mad!

1146
01:21:33,118 --> 01:21:36,053
I told you he'd be furious!

1147
01:21:46,131 --> 01:21:47,063
He's gone!

1148
01:21:47,132 --> 01:21:48,326
Where'd he go?!

1149
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,960
Look out!

1150
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:53,664
Hang on!

1151
01:22:07,586 --> 01:22:09,850
He's coming back! Hurry!

1152
01:22:09,922 --> 01:22:13,016
He's trying to get us!
Paddle, son!

1153
01:22:22,034 --> 01:22:24,025
Let's go back!

1154
01:22:25,737 --> 01:22:28,001
Look out! Jump!

1155
01:22:34,613 --> 01:22:37,548
Father! Father!

1156
01:22:37,616 --> 01:22:39,584
Oh, Father!

1157
01:22:39,651 --> 01:22:41,812
Pinocchio, swim for shore.

1158
01:22:41,887 --> 01:22:43,218
Swim for shore.

1159
01:22:46,859 --> 01:22:48,622
Hang on, Father!

1160
01:22:48,694 --> 01:22:51,390
Save... yourself.

1161
01:24:01,867 --> 01:24:04,392
Save yourself.

1162
01:24:04,469 --> 01:24:08,838
Don't mind me, son.

1163
01:24:08,907 --> 01:24:11,273
Save yourself...

1164
01:24:35,901 --> 01:24:37,664
My boy...

1165
01:24:41,506 --> 01:24:45,135
My brave little boy...

1166
01:24:53,352 --> 01:24:59,018
Prove yourself brave,
truthful, and unselfish,

1167
01:24:59,091 --> 01:25:03,255
and someday
you will be a real boy.

1168
01:25:03,362 --> 01:25:06,024
Awake, Pinocchio.

1169
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:07,929
Awake.

1170
01:25:13,272 --> 01:25:14,432
Father!

1171
01:25:14,506 --> 01:25:16,997
Whatcha cryin' for?

1172
01:25:17,075 --> 01:25:20,704
'Cause... you're dead,
Pinocchio.

1173
01:25:20,779 --> 01:25:22,940
No! No, I'm not!

1174
01:25:23,015 --> 01:25:25,483
Yes, yes, you are.

1175
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:26,710
Now lie down...

1176
01:25:26,785 --> 01:25:29,083
But, Father, I'm alive.
See?

1177
01:25:29,154 --> 01:25:30,815
And...

1178
01:25:30,889 --> 01:25:33,187
And I'm...

1179
01:25:33,258 --> 01:25:34,452
I'm...

1180
01:25:34,526 --> 01:25:36,050
I'm real!

1181
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,686
I'm a real boy!

1182
01:25:37,763 --> 01:25:39,628
You're alive!

1183
01:25:39,698 --> 01:25:42,326
And you are a real boy!

1184
01:25:42,401 --> 01:25:45,893
A real, live boy!

1185
01:25:45,971 --> 01:25:49,031
This calls for a celebration!

1186
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:58,076
Professor! Lots of music!

1187
01:26:11,663 --> 01:26:15,326
Well! This is practically
where I came in.

1188
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:34,043
Thank you, milady.

1189
01:26:34,119 --> 01:26:37,714
He deserved to be
a real boy.

1190
01:26:37,789 --> 01:26:40,656
And it sure was nice
of you to...

1191
01:26:44,796 --> 01:26:46,286
Well, I'll be!

1192
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:49,128
My, my!

1193
01:26:49,201 --> 01:26:51,567
Solid gold, too.

1194
01:26:53,505 --> 01:26:56,065
Oh, I think it's swell!

1195
01:27:00,645 --> 01:27:05,412
<i>When your heart</i>
<i>is in your dreams</i>

1196
01:27:05,484 --> 01:27:12,890
<i>No request is too extreme</i>

1197
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:20,660
<i>When you wish upon a star</i>

1198
01:27:20,732 --> 01:27:23,963
<i>Your dreams</i>

1199
01:27:24,035 --> 01:27:28,529
<i>Come true</i>

1200
01:27:28,607 --> 01:27:33,806
<i>You'll find</i>
<i>your dreams come true</i>

1201
01:27:38,395 --> 01:28:08,395
