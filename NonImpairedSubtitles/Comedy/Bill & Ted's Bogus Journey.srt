1
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:17,056
It is time.

2
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:24,858
They've reached the second crucial
turning point in their destiny.

3
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:29,563
Their message is about to
reach millions.

4
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:33,504
But... we will change all that.

5
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:38,273
When our mission is successful...

6
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:42,612
...no longer will the world
be dominated...

7
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:48,053
...by the legacy of these two fools!

8
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:51,523
No longer will we hear this:

9
00:00:52,162 --> 00:00:54,187
We will stop them now!

10
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:57,362
Brothers and sisters...

11
00:00:58,636 --> 00:01:00,763
...are we ready?

12
00:02:31,962 --> 00:02:35,762
- Greetings, my excellent pupils.
- Station.

13
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:40,266
Let's continue our study of the
physics of acoustical reverberation.

14
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:43,929
Meet today's most non-bogus
guest speakers.

15
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:46,132
Say hello to Thomas Edison.

16
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:48,068
Hello there.

17
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:50,439
To help us on the musical side:

18
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:52,544
Johann Sebastian Bach.

19
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,811
And Sir James Martin
of Faith No More...

20
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:04,084
...founder of the Faith No More
Spiritual and Theological Center.

21
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:09,695
- Station!
- Station!

22
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,801
And a special treat
from the 23rd century:

23
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:14,798
Miss Ria Paschelle.

24
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:22,044
Miss Paschelle is
the inventor of the...

25
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:25,909
...statiophonicoxygeneticamp-
lifiagraphiphonideliverberator.

26
00:03:26,116 --> 00:03:29,017
Hard to imagine the world
without them, isn't it?

27
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:34,483
Remember, this Friday, Ben Franklin
and Aretha Franklin will be here.

28
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:39,719
Saturday is the field trip
to Babylonia. And very important:

29
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,300
Do not do your homework without
wearing headphones...

30
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:45,461
De Nomolos. My old teacher.

31
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:50,524
Rufus.
My favorite pupil.

32
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:53,303
- I thought you were...
- Dead?

33
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:55,427
No.

34
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,231
Just in preparation.

35
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:05,243
I worked within the system
until I could stand it no longer.

36
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,280
And soon...

37
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:13,480
...soon the system
will never have existed.

38
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:17,324
- You won't get away with it.
- Time will tell.

39
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,119
Time has told.

40
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:25,097
I'll go back and change that,
with the aid of my secret weapons!

41
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:31,936
How's it going, dudes?

42
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:55,427
Friends, friends, friends.
These are automatons.

43
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:59,829
Replicas only.
Furnished with my agenda.

44
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,800
Now, what is your mission?

45
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,103
- First, we totally kill Bill and Ted.
- Then we take over their lives.

46
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:10,610
Then we utterly destroy them.

47
00:06:10,814 --> 00:06:15,774
At the Battle of the Bands, we give
their speech except totally different.

48
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:19,921
And thus a new future is born.
A great future.

49
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:22,588
Don't tell us.
You programmed us.

50
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:25,523
- He's totally a robot!
- So are you!

51
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:27,629
We're total metal heads!

52
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:30,332
Shut up.

53
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:35,471
Now.

54
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,739
- What is the fuel?
- Fear!

55
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:41,604
- What is the engine?
- Discipline!

56
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:44,144
- What is the ideal?
- Order!

57
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:46,407
And how do we achieve it?

58
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,286
Death to Bill and Ted!

59
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:03,394
Catch you later, evil dude.

60
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:48,367
I am Bill S. Preston...

61
00:07:48,578 --> 00:07:50,307
...Esquire!

62
00:07:52,716 --> 00:07:56,618
This is Ted "Theodore" Logan!

63
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,520
On drums and keyboards...

64
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:05,286
...celebrating their fifth year
in the 20th century...

65
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:08,589
...the princesses
from medieval England.

66
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:11,490
Joanna and Elizabeth.

67
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:14,200
And we are...

68
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:17,673
...Wyld Stallyns.

69
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:25,580
You tell me you're
the greatest band, but you stink.

70
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:29,644
We don't understand it either.

71
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:31,445
You can't sing.

72
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:36,388
- The girls can play. But you guys?
- Girls mature faster than guys.

73
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:39,118
Plus, they started
in the 15th century.

74
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:40,590
What do you mean?

75
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:44,096
- They're from medieval England.
- Ted, shut up.

76
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:46,434
Medieval England, Iowa.

77
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:51,005
The Battle of the Bands is
the biggest event in the area.

78
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,006
We're talking
about a $25,000 first prize...

79
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:58,671
...a two-year record deal and exposure
to people in the business.

80
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:04,718
We're even live on Channel 12. If you
were me, would you put you guys on?

81
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,081
No way.

82
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:11,190
Since you work for Pretzels 'N' Cheese,
I'll give you a shot.

83
00:09:11,394 --> 00:09:13,021
Excellent!

84
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:20,401
But last. Midnight.
By that time, everyone will be gone.

85
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:23,198
That's all right.
We're used to that.

86
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:26,807
We cleaned out Ted's brother's
junior high dance.

87
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,468
They turned on "La Bamba"
while he was playing his solo.

88
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,511
Shut up, Ted!

89
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:36,777
Guys, do yourself a favor.
Prepare a little.

90
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:39,979
Work on your act.
Think of something.

91
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,591
Don't worry.
We won't let you down.

92
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:52,292
- Dude, we gotta win.
- Then we could propose to the ladies.

93
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:57,132
We can't raise a family on the
money from Pretzels 'N' Cheese.

94
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:01,509
I'll tell Missy we're on our way.

95
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:05,078
Should be a most resplendent
birthday party.

96
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:09,645
- Shall we, ladies?
- Great, sure.

97
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,641
So you have something
else to celebrate tonight.

98
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:36,737
We got into the Battle of the Bands.

99
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:42,482
If we win, I'll totally
pay you back your money.

100
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,716
What if you don't win?

101
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:51,056
Well, uh, I guess...

102
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:58,927
- Maybe sell more blood.
- Think about selling the instruments.

103
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:03,003
Of course, we've always got
a spot for you.

104
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:07,807
Remember my friend, Colonel Oats
from the Alaskan Military School?

105
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:14,743
- "How's it going?"
- Yeah.

106
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:16,816
Splendidly.

107
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:19,485
Remember...

108
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:22,283
...it's not too late for you, Ted.

109
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:30,356
For either of you.

110
00:11:31,468 --> 00:11:33,493
For all four of you.

111
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:43,337
Fresh fudge.

112
00:11:44,614 --> 00:11:46,013
Hi, Oatsie.

113
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,179
Darling.

114
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:52,650
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Missy.

115
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:55,620
Hey, Missy.
I mean, Mom.

116
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:03,992
I can't believe Missy
divorced your dad...

117
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,827
...and married mine.

118
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:08,395
Shut up, Ted.

119
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,904
- Your dad looks bad.
- I know.

120
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:20,010
What's next?

121
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:25,085
- Maybe she'll marry you.
- Then you'll be your own stepdad.

122
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:34,489
You probably noticed we haven't
given you our gifts yet.

123
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:36,427
That's because...

124
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:45,064
That's because we wanted to say...

125
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:54,745
Excuse us, dude.

126
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:06,022
I wrote this myself.

127
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:08,288
I wrote this last night.

128
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:14,492
"Elizabeth..."

129
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:15,693
"Joanna...

130
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,898
...as I wander through this dark
and Ionely forest of life..."

131
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:23,477
"...surrounded by various beasts..."

132
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,740
"...bears, vipers, squirrels..."

133
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,441
"Not to mention barnacles
and algae..."

134
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,756
"...man-of-wars, starfish,
blowfish, catfish..."

135
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,121
Oh, no, that's freshwater.

136
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:41,325
The point is, I know we promised you
a better life than this.

137
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:47,602
What I mean to say is, I realize
when we took you out of England...

138
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:51,240
...we said the future held
some really good stuff.

139
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:54,672
Although stuff hasn't
worked out how we thought...

140
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:58,246
...it will, we hope.

141
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:02,376
The day after tomorrow,
if things work out...

142
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:05,145
What this is about is...

143
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:14,858
- Will you...?
- Marry us?

144
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:23,600
- Theodore...
- I'd love to.

145
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:09,781
- Aim for the cat, dude!
- I'm trying, Evil Ted! I'm trying!

146
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:16,286
Aw, just missed!

147
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:30,735
- Not bad.
- Yeah, let's make it bad.

148
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:43,384
We're here, dude.

149
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,682
Is Rufus with you?

150
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:48,080
One second.

151
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:03,695
Looks like we lost him in the
circuits of time, duder.

152
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:07,206
Good.
Then he's gone forever.

153
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,811
Our first act of business:

154
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:14,279
Destroy that ridiculous,
insipid band!

155
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:16,749
You got it, dude!

156
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:18,916
Get to work.

157
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,879
Now!

158
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:23,786
Study these books well.

159
00:16:23,993 --> 00:16:26,587
When my mission is completed...

160
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:29,560
...this will be the new history.

161
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:32,501
What a shithead.

162
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:39,565
- Bye!
- Bye!

163
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:42,210
Drive safe!

164
00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:44,735
- Dude.
- What?

165
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:48,406
After we're married,
will the girls stay with us?

166
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:51,553
Yeah, our girlfriends are
most chaste.

167
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:55,756
- At least they're not dating our dads.
- Good point, dude.

168
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:03,624
- Hello?
- This is Joanna.

169
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,893
Joanna! How'd you call so fast?

170
00:17:07,103 --> 00:17:09,196
It's not important. This is:

171
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:13,671
Elizabeth and I have decided
we're quitting Wyld Stallyns.

172
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:14,865
What?

173
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:16,204
- Yes!
- Why?

174
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:19,381
You're losers and
we don't want to see you again.

175
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:20,571
No way!

176
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:26,746
We're going to the desert to be alone.
It's over. Goodbye.

177
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,463
- I totally fooled them.
- Yeah, they're completely brilliant.

178
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:39,692
Not!

179
00:17:40,837 --> 00:17:43,738
- Let's start phase two.
- Station.

180
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:14,631
<i>An incredible fortune in stones.</i>

181
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:19,264
<i>Yet I'd trade them all</i>
<i>for a hand phaser.</i>

182
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:22,771
<i>Or a good solid club.</i>

183
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:27,205
Maybe we should've proposed
to them sooner.

184
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:31,176
How could we, Ted?

185
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:33,912
We could barely afford
our own apartment.

186
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,424
This is most non-non-heinous.

187
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:42,124
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta find them.

188
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:43,626
Talk to them.

189
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:45,591
But how?

190
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:07,316
Who could that be?

191
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:16,898
How's it going, Bill and Ted?

192
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:19,700
Ted, it's us again.

193
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,564
- How's it going, Bill?
- Not bad, Bill. And you?

194
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:24,797
Bad.

195
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:30,868
We came to help in your most
unfortunate situation.

196
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:39,845
How?

197
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:42,149
Come with us. We'll show you.

198
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,758
Excuse us.

199
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:52,493
- I got a weird feeling here.
- Why?

200
00:19:53,102 --> 00:19:54,364
I don't know.

201
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:58,206
How do we know they're really us?

202
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,603
We've been through this before.

203
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:07,612
Without the intervention
of our future selves...

204
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:11,753
...would we have passed history?
Or met the babes?

205
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:15,782
Or had a most excellent adventure
through time?

206
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:24,765
Ted, if you're really me,
how many fingers am I gonna hold up?

207
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:25,991
Three.

208
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:30,267
You're right!

209
00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:34,033
Let's go, guys.
We'll drive.

210
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,472
- Ted.
- What?

211
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:46,519
I think we're about to embark
on an unprecedented expedition.

212
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:50,048
- Dude.
- What?

213
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:54,361
I got a full-on robot chubby.

214
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,764
Later, Evil Ted.

215
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:58,528
Later.

216
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:14,547
I'm cold.

217
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:19,716
Hey! Can we have some heat back here?

218
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:21,412
Shut up, Bill.

219
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:25,987
That other you's a real jerk.

220
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:31,963
I'll be more considerate to myself
when I become him.

221
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:34,261
He said, shut your holes!

222
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:39,265
I got a very bad feeling.

223
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:14,468
Out.

224
00:22:21,984 --> 00:22:25,511
So where are Joanna and Elizabeth?

225
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,446
They're not here.

226
00:22:27,657 --> 00:22:31,855
We lied. Here's the truth,
we're gonna kill you now.

227
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:35,029
- No way!
- Yes way, Ted.

228
00:22:35,498 --> 00:22:39,764
- We're programmed to do it.
- And we want to do it too.

229
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:42,437
You dick, Bill!

230
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:50,702
- You're metal, dude!
- I know. Check it out.

231
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,979
Let's go.

232
00:23:02,692 --> 00:23:04,182
Bogus.

233
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:41,919
We gotta do something.

234
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:46,059
Dudes, even though
you're doing this...

235
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:49,669
...we, we...

236
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:51,430
We love you.

237
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,369
We love you.

238
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:57,078
Fags!

239
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:05,381
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

240
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:26,999
Yes! I totally loogied on that
good dead me!

241
00:24:28,544 --> 00:24:32,071
- We're fully, full-on evil robots.
- Yeah!

242
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:39,783
- You wanna take the van?
- No, it's beat.

243
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,652
There's a Porsche.

244
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:46,753
Let's bag it.

245
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:50,088
Station.

246
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:29,628
Bill...

247
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:32,538
...what happened?

248
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,199
Ted...

249
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,503
...we're dead, dude.

250
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,550
- No way.
- Yes way.

251
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,153
Look.

252
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:55,592
Now what?

253
00:25:59,502 --> 00:26:00,833
Who's that?

254
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:13,044
Who are you?

255
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:14,774
Ted...

256
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:18,445
...it's the Grim Reaper, dude.

257
00:26:21,257 --> 00:26:23,054
How's it hanging, Death?

258
00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:26,688
You will come with me.

259
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:32,895
We can't.
We gotta get back to the babes.

260
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:35,570
Ted, we can't. We're dead, dude.

261
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:39,366
We gotta stop these evil "usses."
We gotta try.

262
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:44,540
Excuse us, dude,
but is there any way back?

263
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:49,975
You may challenge me to a contest.

264
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:52,181
But if you lose...

265
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:55,957
...you will remain here
in the afterlife...

266
00:26:56,425 --> 00:26:57,915
...forever.

267
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:04,692
What if we win?

268
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:09,465
No one has ever won.

269
00:27:10,706 --> 00:27:14,198
- Dude, we gotta ditch this guy.
- Definitely.

270
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:15,869
But how?

271
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:21,049
Melvin.

272
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,888
Excuse us, dude...

273
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:29,751
...but your shoes are untied.

274
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:43,400
I can't believe
we just melvined Death.

275
00:27:46,008 --> 00:27:48,738
Let's hope he doesn't
catch up with us.

276
00:28:29,985 --> 00:28:31,452
No way!

277
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:36,015
This isn't funny.

278
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:37,749
Way to go, Joanna!

279
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,656
I don't understand
what's come over you two.

280
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:44,765
You see, we used to be puss-weeds,
but now we're metal.

281
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:47,367
So get over here and put out!

282
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:52,168
You can forget
about us playing tonight.

283
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:54,064
Fine.

284
00:28:59,815 --> 00:29:02,045
Then I guess that's that.

285
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:06,245
Yeah, see you.

286
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,926
Catch you later, babes!

287
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,640
Ted, I have an idea.

288
00:29:32,848 --> 00:29:35,749
Tonight after we make
De Nomolos' speech...

289
00:29:36,518 --> 00:29:38,509
...let's waste them.

290
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:43,487
Station. Meanwhile, let's trash
this lame rathole.

291
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:45,182
Stellar, Evil Ted!

292
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,328
- Ted, we have got to stop them.
- Yeah. But how?

293
00:30:00,743 --> 00:30:02,108
I hope this works.

294
00:30:02,311 --> 00:30:05,747
It worked in <i>The Exorcist.</i>
<i>I</i> and <i>III</i>!

295
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:16,052
You'll move downtown so DeLoach
can take her maternity leave.

296
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:19,489
Also, anyone interested
in moonlighting...

297
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:23,187
...we're stepping up security
for the Battle of the Bands.

298
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,698
I hear your son's band is playing.

299
00:30:29,238 --> 00:30:33,470
Thanks for reminding me, sergeant.
Also, Scott Frank...

300
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:38,178
- So, how do we do this?
- I don't know.

301
00:30:39,615 --> 00:30:41,640
Why don't you try something?

302
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:43,977
Okay.

303
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,663
Okay, dudes.

304
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,733
I mean, fellow policemen...

305
00:31:07,276 --> 00:31:09,938
...my son, Ted "Theodore" Logan...

306
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:12,739
...and his friend
Bill Preston, Esquire...

307
00:31:12,948 --> 00:31:17,385
...have been murdered and replaced
by evil robots from the future.

308
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:19,281
You totally did it, dude!

309
00:31:19,488 --> 00:31:21,456
I totally possessed my dad.

310
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:27,721
Okay.

311
00:31:28,497 --> 00:31:33,560
You have to arrest these robots
so they don't ruin everything for us.

312
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,329
I mean, my son and Bill.

313
00:31:36,872 --> 00:31:41,206
And, most importantly,
they don't hurt the babes.

314
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:43,869
The princesses.

315
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,407
This isn't working.

316
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:50,278
- Back me up, dude.
- You got it, dude.

317
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:05,061
I totally believe you, dude.

318
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:11,003
- Doughnuts!
- Excellent!

319
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:12,867
Savory cruller.

320
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:16,967
- I got really hungry being dead.
- Yeah!

321
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:21,472
I don't think they believe us.

322
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:25,352
We have to find someone who will.

323
00:32:26,188 --> 00:32:28,850
Catch you later, cop dudes!

324
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:38,194
Ted, we can't go like this.

325
00:32:49,811 --> 00:32:51,802
Thanks, Dad.

326
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:57,581
- Good morning.
- Sergeant.

327
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:04,153
Gandhi.

328
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:07,723
Anne Boleyn.

329
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,288
Aristotle.

330
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:13,866
President Chester A. Arthur.

331
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:17,135
Clark Gable.

332
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,431
Charlemagne.

333
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:22,877
And I would like to contact Ty Cobb.

334
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:32,183
- Has this séance stuff ever worked?
- No.

335
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:36,019
But it will today, dude.

336
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:46,695
O great spirits
from the netherworld...

337
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:50,861
...leave your celestial
abode and speak upon us...

338
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:54,270
...with your life lessons.

339
00:34:04,953 --> 00:34:07,251
I feel the spirits have arrived!

340
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:09,390
How's it going...

341
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,458
...New Age dudes?

342
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:16,188
Spirits, can you hear me?

343
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,531
And we can see down your...

344
00:34:21,737 --> 00:34:24,570
It's your mom, dude!

345
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:29,571
You're right! Move over, dude.

346
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,042
Spirits, what have you to say to us?

347
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:38,948
The princesses are in trouble.

348
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:43,584
Ted and his most
excellent friend Bill...

349
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,521
...were killed!

350
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:50,658
- Listen to us.
- Beware!

351
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,568
O evil spirits from Hell...

352
00:34:57,773 --> 00:35:00,936
...I send you back into the darkness!

353
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:08,749
- What's she doing?
- I don't know, but it's not good.

354
00:35:12,354 --> 00:35:13,912
No way!

355
00:36:10,445 --> 00:36:13,209
This is a totally deep hole.

356
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:19,716
- Now what?
- I don't know.

357
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:37,996
- You wanna play 20 Questions?
- Okay. I got one.

358
00:36:38,473 --> 00:36:39,997
Are you a mineral?

359
00:36:42,644 --> 00:36:44,407
Are you a tank?

360
00:36:45,814 --> 00:36:47,111
Good one!

361
00:36:51,153 --> 00:36:54,384
- Not bad!
- Can we do it again?

362
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:59,751
I'm working as hard as I can!

363
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:01,952
No way!

364
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:09,893
This is not what I expected
this place to look like.

365
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,038
We got totally lied to
by our album covers, man.

366
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:28,313
Who's that?

367
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,057
Ted, who do you think it is, dude?

368
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:38,924
How do we get his attention?

369
00:37:39,835 --> 00:37:41,564
Sign of the devil, dude!

370
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:46,039
- Hey, Devil dude!
- Down here!

371
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:48,471
Down here, dude!

372
00:37:48,677 --> 00:37:51,510
Two little guys!

373
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:53,738
Big dude! Down here!

374
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:08,326
I kind of like this.

375
00:38:10,365 --> 00:38:12,094
Excellent!

376
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:16,035
Let's get out of here.

377
00:38:21,877 --> 00:38:26,177
Ted, if I die, you can have
my Megadeth collection.

378
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:28,781
But, dude, we're already dead!

379
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:34,181
- Well, then they're yours, dude.
- Whoa! Thanks, dude.

380
00:38:54,943 --> 00:38:57,138
How's it going, Beelzebub?

381
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,580
Okay. Can we go now?

382
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:04,808
You may go.

383
00:39:08,823 --> 00:39:10,381
Thanks, dude!

384
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:15,325
You know, you got a bad rap,
but you're actually an okay dude!

385
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:32,443
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

386
00:39:34,115 --> 00:39:37,084
Maybe we should try
one of these tunnels.

387
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,622
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

388
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,160
Maybe we should try
one of these doors.

389
00:39:56,571 --> 00:39:58,505
After you, dude.

390
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:08,244
Now where are we?

391
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:12,612
Who's that?

392
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:18,689
It's Colonel Oats!

393
00:40:19,394 --> 00:40:21,021
No way!

394
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:23,158
Gentlemen!

395
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,833
Welcome to Hell.

396
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:30,537
- No way.
- What?!

397
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:32,331
No way, sir?

398
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,371
You two...

399
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:39,106
...will do whatever
I tell you to do...

400
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:42,181
...from now on.

401
00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:44,716
Is that clear?

402
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:49,085
- Yes, sir, dude!
- What?!

403
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:52,626
- Yes, dude, sir!
- What?!

404
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:55,025
Yes, sir, sir dude!

405
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:58,028
Get down and give me...

406
00:40:58,233 --> 00:41:00,360
...infinity.

407
00:41:03,638 --> 00:41:07,904
Stupid, pathetic,
craven little cretins.

408
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:14,380
- I can't possibly do infinity pushups!
- Pitiful little morons.

409
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:17,310
- Maybe we can do girls' style.
- Jokers!

410
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,922
You petty, base, bully,
bullock, bugger billies.

411
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:25,923
You're not strong! You're silky boys!

412
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:30,592
Silk comes from the butts
of Chinese worms.

413
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:36,032
- We gotta get out of here.
- I'll eat you up like butter cakes.

414
00:41:36,237 --> 00:41:38,671
Get back here!

415
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:44,239
- Dude.
- What?

416
00:41:44,446 --> 00:41:47,142
I think we're in
our own personal hell.

417
00:41:47,348 --> 00:41:51,444
- Let's split up.
- That way he can't get us so bad.

418
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,808
What happened?

419
00:42:40,735 --> 00:42:42,600
Bogus!

420
00:43:09,998 --> 00:43:14,628
Granny S. Preston, Esquire.

421
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:16,359
No way.

422
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:27,739
Theodore!

423
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:31,751
You made your brother cry.

424
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,953
How about...

425
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:35,983
...a kiss...

426
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:41,085
...for your dear old granny, Bill?

427
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:49,434
Come along.

428
00:43:57,278 --> 00:44:00,076
You stole Deacon's Easter basket.

429
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:03,773
No way. This was 10 years ago!

430
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,649
Come here!

431
00:44:18,433 --> 00:44:22,301
That was non, non, non...
Non-heinous!

432
00:44:22,503 --> 00:44:23,868
Choose...

433
00:44:24,072 --> 00:44:25,300
...your...

434
00:44:25,506 --> 00:44:27,633
...eternity.

435
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:34,310
Choose your own, you fag!

436
00:44:43,157 --> 00:44:47,958
You ugly, red source of all evil!

437
00:44:54,936 --> 00:44:57,666
Hello, girls.

438
00:45:07,282 --> 00:45:08,408
- Dude.
- What?

439
00:45:08,616 --> 00:45:10,777
- Hell sucks!
- Definitely!

440
00:45:10,985 --> 00:45:15,684
- You no-nosed salamanders!
- Deac's Easter basket!

441
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,691
Come to Oatsie!

442
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,326
I want one right on the lips!

443
00:45:28,636 --> 00:45:33,938
- There's only one way out!
- Right. We gotta play the Reaper!

444
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:43,175
Choose your game.

445
00:45:43,685 --> 00:45:45,949
But if you lose...

446
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:48,849
...you will stay here in Hell...

447
00:45:49,657 --> 00:45:51,386
...forever.

448
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:10,575
D-1.

449
00:46:15,216 --> 00:46:16,205
Miss.

450
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,759
B...

451
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:28,121
...3.

452
00:46:29,597 --> 00:46:31,258
Miss.

453
00:46:33,034 --> 00:46:35,662
C-6.

454
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,201
Hit.

455
00:46:45,113 --> 00:46:47,911
- Dude...
- I know.

456
00:46:54,689 --> 00:46:57,055
J-7.

457
00:46:58,126 --> 00:47:00,219
J-7...

458
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:02,818
Hit.

459
00:47:04,565 --> 00:47:08,592
A hit. You have sunk my battleship.

460
00:47:09,303 --> 00:47:10,327
Excellent!

461
00:47:12,774 --> 00:47:15,937
- I knew he put it in the J's.
- Good thinking.

462
00:47:16,144 --> 00:47:18,135
You must play me again.

463
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,807
- What?!
- Best two out of three.

464
00:47:23,017 --> 00:47:24,245
No way!

465
00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:29,989
Yes way.

466
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:40,692
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

467
00:47:51,412 --> 00:47:53,539
I believe...

468
00:47:53,748 --> 00:47:57,878
...Col. Mustard did it
in the study with the candlestick.

469
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:09,426
Sorry, Death. You lose.
It was Professor Plum.

470
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:13,623
- I said "Plum."
- No way. You said "Mustard!"

471
00:48:13,835 --> 00:48:15,200
Can we go back now?

472
00:48:17,538 --> 00:48:19,233
Best three out of five.

473
00:48:20,341 --> 00:48:22,639
I don't believe this guy.

474
00:48:34,555 --> 00:48:37,080
- Best of seven?
- Damn right!

475
00:48:41,929 --> 00:48:43,920
Right hand, green.

476
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:50,862
Left hand, red.

477
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:57,370
Right foot, green.

478
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,512
Right foot...

479
00:49:25,873 --> 00:49:27,033
Well?

480
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:33,612
I will...

481
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:37,110
...take you back.

482
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:49,091
- You played very well.
- Especially with your heavy robes.

483
00:49:49,297 --> 00:49:51,094
Don't patronize me.

484
00:49:51,299 --> 00:49:55,531
Whatever. You got a lot
to learn about sportsmanship.

485
00:49:56,704 --> 00:49:58,171
This way.

486
00:49:59,307 --> 00:50:01,172
Now we can save the babes.

487
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:05,471
But, Bill, how will we fight
those other usses?

488
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,707
They're totally stronger than us.
And way smarter.

489
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:12,818
Plus, they already killed us once.

490
00:50:14,322 --> 00:50:16,119
One minute, duder!

491
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:21,792
If we were good human usses and we had
to fight two evil robot usses...

492
00:50:21,996 --> 00:50:25,523
...what would we do?
- Make good robot usses?

493
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:28,258
Good thinking, dude!

494
00:50:28,603 --> 00:50:29,661
Excuse us.

495
00:50:30,004 --> 00:50:32,700
- Excuse me, Death?
- Oh, now what?

496
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:36,206
Could you take us to someone
who could help us?

497
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:39,868
You have beaten me.
I am at your command.

498
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:41,343
Cool!

499
00:50:41,549 --> 00:50:43,176
This way.

500
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:46,481
- Ted.
- What?

501
00:50:46,687 --> 00:50:48,712
Don't fear the Reaper.

502
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:51,725
I heard that.

503
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:07,104
This is most atypical.

504
00:51:31,632 --> 00:51:33,293
Welcome to Heaven.

505
00:51:35,536 --> 00:51:37,504
I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

506
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:39,470
Thank you.

507
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:42,803
Through there.

508
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,671
Welcome to Heaven.

509
00:51:45,846 --> 00:51:47,939
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

510
00:51:49,316 --> 00:51:53,844
"Only the most serene and enlightened
souls shall gain audience."

511
00:51:54,055 --> 00:51:56,114
Dude, we're in big trouble.

512
00:51:58,526 --> 00:52:00,585
I think I have an idea.

513
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:11,265
Wise dudes.

514
00:52:11,605 --> 00:52:13,664
Can we ask you a question?

515
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:16,073
Right this way, please.

516
00:52:26,821 --> 00:52:30,450
We're in Heaven,
and we just mugged three people.

517
00:52:30,658 --> 00:52:33,957
We better leave
before we ruin it for everybody.

518
00:52:36,897 --> 00:52:38,762
Come on, Death.

519
00:52:39,633 --> 00:52:41,624
You look great, dude.

520
00:52:42,937 --> 00:52:44,495
You think so?

521
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:51,033
You do.

522
00:52:53,948 --> 00:52:55,609
Shut up.

523
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:59,210
- Come on, dude.
- It's not funny.

524
00:52:59,987 --> 00:53:02,387
I can't believe I'm doing this.

525
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:05,582
How did I end up in this situation?

526
00:53:25,206 --> 00:53:26,434
How's it going?

527
00:53:28,043 --> 00:53:30,068
What is the meaning of life?

528
00:53:40,188 --> 00:53:44,318
<i>Every rose has its thorn</i>

529
00:53:44,526 --> 00:53:48,622
<i>Just like every night has its dawn</i>

530
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,822
<i>Just like every cowboy</i>

531
00:53:52,033 --> 00:53:56,265
<i>Sings a sad, sad song</i>

532
00:54:01,276 --> 00:54:04,473
<i>Every rose has a thorn</i>

533
00:54:06,915 --> 00:54:08,348
Don't I know you?

534
00:54:10,085 --> 00:54:11,313
No.

535
00:54:53,428 --> 00:54:57,194
So, God, as if you didn't know...

536
00:54:57,799 --> 00:55:02,361
...we're not the three wise people
you might have thought we were.

537
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:06,939
We mugged three people and took
their clothes. Sorry.

538
00:55:07,142 --> 00:55:10,771
- I'm Bill S. Preston.
- I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.

539
00:55:10,979 --> 00:55:15,643
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

540
00:55:17,485 --> 00:55:20,147
This lovely lady is the Grim Reaper.

541
00:55:20,355 --> 00:55:23,586
He brought us when we
challenged him and won.

542
00:55:25,994 --> 00:55:31,022
First, congratulations on Earth!
It's a most excellent planet.

543
00:55:31,232 --> 00:55:36,101
- We enjoy it on a daily basis.
- Not to mention your other planets.

544
00:55:36,304 --> 00:55:40,263
Mars, Jupiter, Uranus.

545
00:55:42,744 --> 00:55:46,373
But the point is, we died.

546
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:49,015
Most unfairly.

547
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:52,245
But we won the chance to come back.

548
00:55:52,453 --> 00:55:56,287
We gotta construct something
to save the women we love.

549
00:55:56,958 --> 00:56:00,519
And there's not a lot of time.
So we were wondering...

550
00:56:00,728 --> 00:56:04,220
...could you help us
find somebody to help us?

551
00:56:04,966 --> 00:56:07,366
<i>Station.</i>

552
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:10,497
We were thinking along the lines...

553
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:13,970
...of maybe a scientist or something.

554
00:56:27,488 --> 00:56:28,853
Cool.

555
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:33,889
Thanks, God.

556
00:56:34,229 --> 00:56:38,063
Yeah. You're a just and noble creator.

557
00:56:39,367 --> 00:56:42,928
- We'll be going now.
- Keep up the good work.

558
00:56:43,137 --> 00:56:45,162
Catch you later, God.

559
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:59,284
Sorry. They melvined me.

560
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:08,185
All right, upside-down cake!

561
00:57:08,396 --> 00:57:11,194
- Hey, Evil Ted.
- What?

562
00:57:16,404 --> 00:57:18,201
We're out of dishes.

563
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:21,641
Check this out.

564
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,570
Not bad, E.T.

565
00:57:29,784 --> 00:57:31,012
Let me try.

566
00:57:37,926 --> 00:57:40,486
You totally didn't see the fan.

567
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:48,831
Tell my body to get over here
and get me!

568
00:57:49,304 --> 00:57:52,239
That's all right. I'll get you.

569
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:56,243
Got your head, dude.

570
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:01,777
I'm totally gonna tackle you, dude.

571
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,954
- Touchdown for Evil Ted!
- We're total headbangers.

572
00:58:13,194 --> 00:58:16,493
Come on. There you go.

573
00:58:22,403 --> 00:58:26,396
Stop wasting time.
Proceed with the plan now.

574
00:58:26,607 --> 00:58:28,302
<i>Okay, dude.</i>

575
00:58:29,277 --> 00:58:32,678
<i>What do you say</i>
<i>we trash their relationships?</i>

576
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:36,908
I hate them.

577
00:58:37,118 --> 00:58:40,281
I hate the robot versions of them.

578
00:58:40,755 --> 00:58:42,655
<i>You made us, dude.</i>

579
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:52,197
Looks like this is the place.

580
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,301
Now all we gotta do
is find that scientist.

581
00:58:56,371 --> 00:58:59,932
- What kind of name is Station?
- I don't know.

582
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:02,507
Must be some kind of future guy.

583
00:59:08,182 --> 00:59:10,173
Okay, how many syllables?

584
00:59:12,387 --> 00:59:14,651
Is it a play or a song or...?

585
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:18,324
It's something big.

586
00:59:19,927 --> 00:59:22,225
My money's on Einstein.

587
00:59:24,966 --> 00:59:26,490
That's Station?

588
00:59:27,335 --> 00:59:30,668
Did you assume
the most brilliant scientist...

589
00:59:30,872 --> 00:59:34,603
...in the universe
would be from Earth?

590
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,143
Yeah.

591
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:43,744
Movies?

592
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:47,051
- Nine words.
- Good, Mr. Franklin.

593
00:59:47,255 --> 00:59:49,621
Fire? Cigarettes?

594
00:59:49,824 --> 00:59:52,452
- Clouds, clouds.
- Smoke?

595
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:56,826
<i>Butch and Sundance: The Early Years.</i>

596
01:00:02,737 --> 01:00:06,104
- Death!
- Sorry.

597
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,402
<i>Smokey and the Bandit III.</i>

598
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:15,446
Smokey is the bandit!

599
01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:27,692
Excuse us. Martians?

600
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:31,730
First, my friend,
Bill and I congratulate you...

601
01:00:31,933 --> 01:00:35,027
...on a well-played round of charades.

602
01:00:35,236 --> 01:00:37,500
You've been referred to us...

603
01:00:37,705 --> 01:00:41,539
...as the most brilliant scientists
in the universe.

604
01:00:43,177 --> 01:00:46,169
Would you help us build
good robot usses...

605
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:50,248
...to save two princesses
from bad robot usses?

606
01:00:59,694 --> 01:01:01,924
Sounds good, Station.

607
01:01:05,633 --> 01:01:07,430
Let's rock, Death.

608
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:38,594
- We're alive.
- Yeah.

609
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:43,259
But I think a buzzard
was pecking at my head.

610
01:01:48,943 --> 01:01:51,377
Dinner's over, worm-dude.

611
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:56,913
You guys okay?

612
01:01:58,419 --> 01:02:00,319
Where's Death?

613
01:02:09,397 --> 01:02:10,762
You okay, dude?

614
01:02:14,535 --> 01:02:16,560
I'm fine.

615
01:02:23,544 --> 01:02:26,980
First, we go back to town
and clean up.

616
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:29,513
Second, we warn the princesses.

617
01:02:29,717 --> 01:02:33,619
Third, we buy stuff
to build good robot usses.

618
01:02:35,623 --> 01:02:37,318
Let's go.

619
01:02:40,394 --> 01:02:42,521
What? What?

620
01:02:57,311 --> 01:03:00,872
Here, kitty, kitty!
Here, kitty, kitty!

621
01:03:01,082 --> 01:03:02,777
There's one, dude!

622
01:03:04,585 --> 01:03:06,519
Just missed, dude.

623
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:09,686
Dude, we're there.

624
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,619
Okay. I got an idea.

625
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,378
How's it going, lady humans?

626
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:07,171
Okay, this is Builders Emporium...

627
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:11,317
...a repository for electronics
and robot materials.

628
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,977
Get what you need to make metal usses.

629
01:04:18,793 --> 01:04:22,991
- Ready for the big night?
- No! We're not going.

630
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:28,794
I think you guys
should stop right there.

631
01:04:29,904 --> 01:04:32,270
Catch you later, future wife.

632
01:04:34,675 --> 01:04:36,267
Evil breath!

633
01:04:36,577 --> 01:04:37,566
Who are you?

634
01:04:37,778 --> 01:04:39,905
Well, you see...

635
01:04:51,926 --> 01:04:53,291
Come on.

636
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:58,926
- Any luck?
- They're not at our place or theirs.

637
01:04:59,133 --> 01:05:03,627
I'll try your dad's.
Maybe they went to talk to Missy.

638
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,104
Logan residence.

639
01:05:14,315 --> 01:05:17,648
Evil Bill S. Preston,
Esquire, speaking.

640
01:05:20,221 --> 01:05:23,657
It's them! They're back from the dead.

641
01:05:23,858 --> 01:05:26,053
We get to kill them again.

642
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,557
Excellent!

643
01:05:43,411 --> 01:05:45,743
See you real soon.

644
01:05:49,617 --> 01:05:52,950
- But this time we're ready for you!
- Yeah!

645
01:05:56,524 --> 01:05:59,015
We can be ready for them too.

646
01:05:59,226 --> 01:06:02,252
Good luck getting
in the concert, losers!

647
01:06:08,936 --> 01:06:12,633
<i>- Initiate the final plan.</i>
<i>- You got it, great one.</i>

648
01:06:14,275 --> 01:06:16,709
<i>Do not fail me.</i>

649
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:19,338
<i>Metallic buffoons.</i>

650
01:06:25,386 --> 01:06:28,549
- That other me is a dick.
- Yeah.

651
01:06:30,624 --> 01:06:33,593
I hope the Stations
know what they're doing.

652
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:55,538
Station! What are you doing?

653
01:06:57,718 --> 01:07:01,552
Dudes! This is no time
to be playing games!

654
01:09:21,562 --> 01:09:23,655
That one's me, right?

655
01:09:27,034 --> 01:09:28,763
Not bad.

656
01:09:28,969 --> 01:09:31,529
How's it going, Good Robot Bill?

657
01:09:32,373 --> 01:09:34,238
How's it doing?

658
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,085
<i>Kate Axelrod for KJM...</i>

659
01:09:48,288 --> 01:09:52,224
<i>... reporting live from</i>
<i>the San Dimas Auditorium.</i>

660
01:09:52,426 --> 01:09:55,486
<i>We're rocking at</i>
<i>the Battle of the Bands.</i>

661
01:09:55,696 --> 01:09:59,154
<i>So stay tuned and hold tight</i>
<i>until we find out...</i>

662
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:02,563
<i>... who will be your winner.</i>

663
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:14,044
Ready? You're up.

664
01:10:14,248 --> 01:10:15,715
Where are the girls?

665
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:20,285
- Hanging from the rafters.
- We'll kill them at the finale.

666
01:10:21,088 --> 01:10:23,113
Good luck, gentlemen.

667
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:31,354
Check it out.

668
01:10:33,434 --> 01:10:34,799
Not bad.

669
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:03,726
Let's hear it for Primus!

670
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:44,029
- Are they ready?
- Station.

671
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:46,069
Excellent work, dude.

672
01:11:46,273 --> 01:11:50,369
- What about me? I made the wigs.
- Okay, Death.

673
01:11:50,577 --> 01:11:53,842
I helped do the shopping.
I pushed the cart.

674
01:11:54,047 --> 01:11:57,312
- Do they work like we asked?
- Station.

675
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:03,918
You're a most excellent scientist.

676
01:12:04,558 --> 01:12:08,153
Plus, you got an excellently huge
Martian butt.

677
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:17,228
Feel free to split
in two parts again and relax.

678
01:12:17,437 --> 01:12:21,737
Don't overlook my butt.
I work out all the time.

679
01:12:21,942 --> 01:12:25,036
And reaping burns a lot of calories.

680
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:34,520
Ready to take on those evil usses
and save the babes?

681
01:12:36,223 --> 01:12:40,182
<i>Fight evil usses. Save the babes.</i>

682
01:12:40,394 --> 01:12:43,158
- Ready, Bill?
- Ready, Ted.

683
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:46,264
Let's go get 'em.

684
01:12:46,466 --> 01:12:49,230
And now, the last band of the evening.

685
01:12:49,436 --> 01:12:52,166
Wyld Stallyns!

686
01:13:02,883 --> 01:13:05,283
How's it going, worms?

687
01:13:05,786 --> 01:13:08,516
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!

688
01:13:08,722 --> 01:13:11,384
And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan!

689
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:16,325
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

690
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:20,059
Hold it right there!

691
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:25,400
We're Wyld Stallyns!

692
01:13:25,606 --> 01:13:29,508
No, dudes. We're Wyld Stallyns!

693
01:13:32,145 --> 01:13:36,206
You totally killed us,
you evil metal dickweeds!

694
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:39,010
Yeah, and we're gonna do it again!

695
01:13:39,219 --> 01:13:43,019
Plus, we're gonna totally
kill your girlfriends.

696
01:13:51,164 --> 01:13:54,565
Don't worry, babes! We'll save you.

697
01:13:57,271 --> 01:14:00,763
Everybody, say hello
to Station's creation!

698
01:14:01,108 --> 01:14:04,077
Good Robot Bill and Ted!

699
01:14:17,491 --> 01:14:19,584
We may have met our match.

700
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,920
Kudos to you, good human usses.

701
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:29,201
- Catch you later, Bill and Ted!
- Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

702
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:07,903
- Elizabeth!
- Theodore!

703
01:15:08,475 --> 01:15:11,308
- Joanna!
- William!

704
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:26,088
Who is that?

705
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:44,768
Who are you?

706
01:15:45,979 --> 01:15:47,674
Who am I?

707
01:15:54,588 --> 01:15:57,318
I am De Nomolos.

708
01:15:58,325 --> 01:16:00,293
I am their master.

709
01:16:01,862 --> 01:16:05,354
And I must see to it that you die.

710
01:16:08,001 --> 01:16:09,696
But first...

711
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:40,260
<i>We are now transmitting on every</i>
<i>channel throughout the world.</i>

712
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,634
My word!

713
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:50,337
<i>I want the whole universe</i>
<i>to behold this...</i>

714
01:16:50,544 --> 01:16:53,206
<i>... transfer of power.</i>

715
01:16:54,614 --> 01:16:57,674
<i>No longer will our future society...</i>

716
01:16:57,884 --> 01:17:01,081
<i>... be based on</i>
<i>the ideas and the music...</i>

717
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:03,813
<i>... of these two fools!</i>

718
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:09,419
<i>They will be based on my ideas...</i>

719
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:13,789
...and my ideas alone!

720
01:17:15,168 --> 01:17:18,137
How do we get out of this?
There's no time.

721
01:17:18,338 --> 01:17:22,069
We do. After we get away
from this guy...

722
01:17:22,275 --> 01:17:27,338
...we time-travel back and set up
the things we need to get him now.

723
01:17:27,547 --> 01:17:29,447
Yeah, like what?

724
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:32,142
Like a sandbag.

725
01:17:38,024 --> 01:17:39,355
Excellent!

726
01:17:39,559 --> 01:17:41,720
Then we'll get a cage.

727
01:17:49,136 --> 01:17:50,728
My friends.

728
01:17:51,438 --> 01:17:53,838
I too can play the time game.

729
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,373
If you do that,
once I have vanquished you...

730
01:17:57,577 --> 01:18:01,638
...I'll go back and set up this key.

731
01:18:12,092 --> 01:18:14,822
And another gun.

732
01:18:24,571 --> 01:18:28,530
Right. Only there's one thing
you didn't think of.

733
01:18:28,742 --> 01:18:31,905
Only the winners can go back
and set things up.

734
01:18:32,112 --> 01:18:34,103
And that's gonna be us.

735
01:18:34,314 --> 01:18:38,375
We set up the key,
and we set up the gun.

736
01:18:40,954 --> 01:18:42,922
Excuse me.

737
01:18:43,123 --> 01:18:46,149
Your shoelaces are untied.

738
01:18:52,933 --> 01:18:54,264
Melvined.

739
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:09,706
You're under arrest.

740
01:19:09,916 --> 01:19:11,611
Way to go, Dad!

741
01:19:16,456 --> 01:19:18,356
Book him, Danno.

742
01:19:25,332 --> 01:19:26,959
Good job, Death.

743
01:19:32,205 --> 01:19:33,934
Who was that guy?

744
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:37,268
I can answer that question.

745
01:19:37,577 --> 01:19:39,909
Ms. Wardroe, thanks for the help.

746
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,571
We definitely...

747
01:19:43,316 --> 01:19:45,341
Take it off, baby!

748
01:19:53,827 --> 01:19:55,351
Rufus!

749
01:19:55,562 --> 01:19:56,893
When did you get here?

750
01:19:57,264 --> 01:19:59,459
Just in time for your audition.

751
01:19:59,766 --> 01:20:03,099
So you were Ms. Wardroe all along.

752
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:06,971
Would anyone else have let you
in this contest?

753
01:20:10,977 --> 01:20:14,310
That was Chuck De Nomolos,
my old gym teacher.

754
01:20:14,514 --> 01:20:18,974
And, by the way, sit-up champion
of the 27th century.

755
01:20:19,219 --> 01:20:23,656
And now, gentlemen, I believe
the stage belongs to you.

756
01:20:23,857 --> 01:20:25,256
Thanks, Rufus.

757
01:20:38,405 --> 01:20:40,965
<i>Dude, we still don't know how to play.</i>

758
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:43,703
Maybe we ought to get good.

759
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:45,104
How?

760
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,530
That was a fast 16 months
of intensive guitar training.

761
01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:16,003
Except for the two-week
medieval honeymoon.

762
01:21:17,944 --> 01:21:20,435
Hello, San Dimas!

763
01:21:21,715 --> 01:21:24,047
Let me introduce you
to a little friend.

764
01:21:24,417 --> 01:21:26,009
This is little Ted.

765
01:21:26,586 --> 01:21:29,020
Hello, little Ted!

766
01:21:29,222 --> 01:21:31,122
This is little Bill.

767
01:21:34,627 --> 01:21:37,790
Now for the rest of our band.

768
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,801
On conga and bongos, proof that
you can't tell a book by its cover...

769
01:21:46,005 --> 01:21:48,735
...the dude who can make one word
mean anything...

770
01:21:48,942 --> 01:21:50,876
...Station!

771
01:21:55,949 --> 01:21:57,541
Our backup dancers...

772
01:21:57,751 --> 01:22:00,379
...Station's most bodacious
creations...

773
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:03,454
...the Good Robot Usses!

774
01:22:09,796 --> 01:22:10,956
And over here...

775
01:22:11,164 --> 01:22:14,133
...our bass player,
the Duke of Spooks...

776
01:22:14,334 --> 01:22:17,098
...the Doc of Shocks,
the Man With No Tan...

777
01:22:17,303 --> 01:22:20,170
...please say hello
to Death himself...

778
01:22:20,373 --> 01:22:22,238
...the Grim Reaper!

779
01:22:29,983 --> 01:22:32,577
<i>You might be a king</i>
<i>Or a little street sweeper</i>

780
01:22:32,786 --> 01:22:36,187
<i>But sooner or later</i>
<i>You dance with the Reaper</i>

781
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,688
Get down with your bad self!

782
01:22:50,303 --> 01:22:52,965
I love show business.

783
01:22:54,174 --> 01:22:55,937
Ladies and gentlemen...

784
01:22:56,676 --> 01:22:58,644
...we've been to the past.

785
01:22:59,045 --> 01:23:00,842
We've been to the future.

786
01:23:01,314 --> 01:23:03,680
We've been all around the afterlife.

787
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,717
And you know...

788
01:23:07,787 --> 01:23:09,812
The best place to be...

789
01:23:12,725 --> 01:23:14,090
...is here.

790
01:23:15,128 --> 01:23:17,096
And the best time to be...

791
01:23:17,564 --> 01:23:19,054
...is now.

792
01:23:24,871 --> 01:23:27,635
And all we can say is...

793
01:23:29,576 --> 01:23:30,804
...let's rock!

794
01:23:32,045 --> 01:23:33,569
One! Two!

795
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:36,544
One, two, three, four!

796
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:03,801
Right good! Right good!

797
01:27:36,289 --> 01:27:38,314
<i>You are go, Stallyn!</i>

798
01:27:39,358 --> 01:27:41,622
<i>Come home soon. We'll miss you.</i>
