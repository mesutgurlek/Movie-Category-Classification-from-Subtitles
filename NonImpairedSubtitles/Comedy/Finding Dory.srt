3
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:50,140
Hi.
I'm Dory.

4
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:54,232
I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

5
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:57,723
- Yes!
- That's exactly what you say.

6
00:00:57,748 --> 00:00:58,848
Okay, okay.

7
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:01,437
We'll pretend to be
the other kids now.

8
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:05,838
- Hi, Dory.
- Ahoy, there.

9
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,849
Do you want to
play hide and seek?

10
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:09,569
Okay.
I love to.

11
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:12,115
We'll hide and you count
and come find us.

12
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,203
Okay, Daddy.

13
00:01:13,227 --> 00:01:14,816
No, no.
Not daddy.

14
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,734
I'm the nice fish
who wants to be your friend.

15
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,127
- Okay?
- Okay, Daddy.

16
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:21,155
- No.
- I'm hiding.

17
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,530
Now count to 10.

18
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:27,219
1, 2, 3.

19
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:31,107
Uh.
4... um...

20
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:34,775
I like sand.
Sand is squishy.

21
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,283
Mommy, can I go
play with them?

22
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:38,743
- Dory?
- Dory!

23
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:39,801
Dory, cupcake.

24
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:41,985
- Dory, honey.
- Hold your toes, sweetie.

25
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:43,501
Remember, honey.

26
00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:45,378
We have to stay away
from the undertow.

27
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:48,049
Okay, sweetheart.
What about the rhyme we learned.

28
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,473
We see the undertow
and we say.

29
00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:52,036
Let's go.

30
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:53,693
No.
No.

31
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:55,674
It's, "Heck no!"

32
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,449
Okay?
Let's try it again.

33
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:59,797
We see the undertow
and we say.

34
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:01,702
There's the undertow.

35
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:04,895
There's the undertow.
There's the undertow.

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,634
There you find the undertow
and we see the undertow.

37
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:13,861
- Did I forget again?
- No, no.

38
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:16,846
- No, sweetie. It's okay.
- No biggie, cupcake.

39
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,844
What if I forget you?

40
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:23,395
Huh!
Would you ever forget me?

41
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,229
- Oh cupcake, no.
- We will never forget you, Dory.

42
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:30,668
And we know
you'll never forget us.

43
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:57,623
FINDING
DORY

44
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:12,060
Hello?

45
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,714
Hello?

46
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,836
- Did you hear that?
- What's that? Hear what?

47
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,690
Stan, I just...
I heard someone say hello.

48
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:21,298
Who?
I didn't hear anybody said hello.

49
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:25,126
I don't know, Stan.
I just heard someone say hello.

50
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:26,432
Yeah, there's a lot
of fish here.

51
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,592
Anybody, literally anybody
could have just said hello.

52
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:29,279
Hello?

53
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:30,067
- There.
- Where?

54
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:32,038
- There. There, right there.
- Wh-What am I look?

55
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:33,303
- There.
- Oh.

56
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:35,965
Hello?

57
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,607
- Hello.
- Oh my goodness, it's a child.

58
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:38,643
- Hello.
- Hi, kid.

59
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,076
- Hello.
- Over here. Hello?

60
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:41,284
Hi.

61
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:44,503
Hi, I'm Dory.
Can you please help me?

62
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:46,029
Oh hi, Dory.

63
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:47,841
Ar...
Dory, are you lost?

64
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:49,300
Where are your parents?

65
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:52,337
Umm.
I can't remember.

66
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:54,650
- Oh.
- We'll look around. Uh.

67
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,881
Are any of this fish
your parents?

68
00:04:01,514 --> 00:04:05,330
Hi, I'm Dory.
Can you please help me?

69
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:06,966
- Huh?
- Um.

70
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,946
Honey, you just...
you just said that.

71
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,975
- I did?
- Mm-hm.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,783
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:18,088
I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

74
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:20,753
- Oh, how awful.
- Short-term memory loss.

75
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:21,774
Okay, just...

76
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,722
You wait here for one second,
okay, sweetpie.

77
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:25,522
- Stan. Stan. Stan.
- What? What?

78
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:27,110
What do I do?
The poor thing is lost.

79
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:28,208
I don't know.
I mean...

80
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:29,979
- We have to do something.
- What do you want me to do? I mean...

81
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,314
- She can't remember a thing!
- She could come from anywhere.

82
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,065
Well.

83
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,358
- You are-You are no help today.
- I'm just...

84
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:37,794
- Dory. sweeitie, how about we...
- Oh, she's gone.

85
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,219
- Dory?
- That's not good.

86
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:43,059
- Dory?
- Dory?

87
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,341
I'm Dory.
I lost my family.

88
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:48,163
Can you help me?

89
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,199
I'm Dory.
I suffer from short-term memory... huh!

90
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:05,237
Just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.

91
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:16,450
Hi. I lost my family.
Can you help me?

92
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:19,457
- Where did you see them last?
- Well, uh...

93
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:21,759
Funny story.
But... I forgot.

94
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:24,160
Aw, sweetie.
Do you want to come swim with us?

95
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:27,127
That is the nicest offer
I've gotten all day.

96
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:29,156
I... I think.
I can't remember.

97
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:33,028
Anywho, thanks.
But, heheh, I'm looking for someone.

98
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:34,640
Oh,

99
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:37,928
Can't remember.
Can't remember.

100
00:05:38,644 --> 00:05:41,015
Hi!
I'm Dory.

101
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,934
Was it something I said?

102
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,297
Kidding. Okay, okay.
You're not coming back.

103
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:48,061
I was looking for something
and I...

104
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:51,560
Okay, totally get it.
Date night. Have fun.

105
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:54,184
Well. I hope you find whatever
it is you are looking for.

106
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:57,222
You and me both.
Any idea what that was?

107
00:05:57,247 --> 00:06:00,339
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:03,027
Okay.
Guess we'll hang out another time.

109
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:06,431
Don't be a stranger... stranger.

110
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:12,492
Huh?

111
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:15,785
A white boat!
They took my son!

112
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:18,611
My son!
Help me, please!

113
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:20,042
LOOK OUT!

114
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:23,992
Oh. Oh.
Sorry!

115
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,557
Are you-Are you okay?

116
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:27,168
- He's gone. He's gone.
- There, there.

117
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:28,390
- No, he's gone.
- It's alright.

118
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:29,635
- He's gone.
- It'll be okay.

119
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,588
No. No.
They took him away!

120
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:33,401
I... I have to find the boat.

121
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,733
- A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.
- You have?

122
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:37,383
Uh-huh. This way!
It went this way.

123
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:39,090
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

124
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:42,490
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

125
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:50,692
one year later

126
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:57,332
.

127
00:06:57,704 --> 00:06:59,952
.

128
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:06,079
Hand me the ratchet wrench.
So I can fix it.

129
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,532
Ow!

130
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,156
Hey, Marlin.

131
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,006
Oh.
Hey, guys.

132
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:19,446
I was just...
Ow ow ow...

133
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:22,176
Dory, it's not time
to get up yet.

134
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:25,704
- You have to go back to bed.
- Remember. There aren't any mistakes.

135
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,065
Alright.
Yeah, sorry.

136
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,884
Back to bed.
Back to bed.

137
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:33,923
Hey, Marlin.
Oww!

138
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:35,800
Go back to bed.
That was it.

139
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:37,055
- Very simple, bed.
- Ah.

140
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,578
- Back to...
- Got it.

141
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:42,675
- Hey, Marlin.
- And... we're up.

142
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:45,163
That's it, ready to start the day.

143
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:46,556
And we were looking
for something.

144
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:47,836
- Nemo.
- Right.

145
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:49,892
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

146
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:52,733
Of course I don't really
remember yesterday all that well.

147
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:53,780
Anyway.

148
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:56,841
I would say, the scariest moment
of the trip was the 4 sharks.

149
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,624
Wait.
I thought there were 3 sharks.

150
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,144
No. No.
There were definitely 4.

151
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:02,805
But the last time you told it,
there were 3.

152
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,437
Son. Which one of us traveled
across the entire ocean.

153
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:07,235
Nemo did.

154
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,036
Obviously we had to cross
the ocean to find him. So...

155
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:11,912
You know, he went first.

156
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,286
I guess that's true.
Isn't it?

157
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:20,192
Well.
You made it.

158
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:22,606
- You almost missed the field trip.
- A field?

159
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:24,451
Ooo, I love field trips.
Where are we going?

160
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:26,898
- I thought you told her.
- I did tell her.

161
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,977
- Uh, Dory.
- Yeah.

162
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:33,731
Mr. Ray has too many fish
to keep an eye on today.

163
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,081
- Uh-huh.
- So.

164
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,095
- It would be best if today...
- Um-hm.

165
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,535
If you weren't exactly...

166
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,812
- with the class.
- Oh. Why not?

167
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:45,351
You know, you have problems
remembering things sometimes.

168
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:47,028
That's the one thing
I can't remember, yeah.

169
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:47,990
Okay.

170
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:51,229
Sometimes it's not your fault,
but it can cause you to wonder.

171
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:54,347
And Mr. Ray doesn't really
have time to worry about...

172
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:55,807
- Fish who wonders.
- Sure.

173
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:58,523
In another words, he doesn't
have enough help.

174
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:00,836
Poor guy.
You know, he's so overworked.

175
00:09:00,861 --> 00:09:02,387
- You understand.
- I totally understand now.

176
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:03,649
- Okay. Good.
- Mm-hm.

177
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:05,604
He wants me to be
the teacher's assistant.

178
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,547
- Uh. No, not exactly.
- Well, I'm so honored.

179
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:11,758
I've never been a
teaching assistant before.

180
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:14,846
Mr. Ray, you got help.

181
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:19,443
Oh ho ho.
Okey-dokey!

182
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:22,271
- Alright, kids.
- Alright, kids.

183
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,147
- Today's the day.
- Today's the day.

184
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:27,440
-  Field trip to the stingray migration.
- Stingray migration.

185
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:30,605
Now, does anyone know
why we migrate?

186
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,095
Come on, you got
to know this stuff.

187
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,929
Migration is about going back to...

188
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:37,047
- Bed!
- Yes.

189
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:37,841
- No.
- No.

190
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,129
- The sand!
- No.

191
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:42,255
- Migration is about going home.
- Home.

192
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,384
- Which is where you are from.
- Where you are from.

193
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,232
Can someone tell me
where they are from.

194
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:47,469
I live by a giant rock.

195
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:49,150
I live 3 coral caves
away from here.

196
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:51,270
My house is covered in algae.

197
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:53,600
- Where did you grow up, Dory?
- Me?

198
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,484
Um.
I don't know.

199
00:09:57,143 --> 00:10:00,573
My family.
Where are they?

200
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:05,243
Can I help you?

201
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:08,514
I'm sorry. Did I forget again?
See, I suffer from...

202
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:10,295
- Short-term memory loss.
- Short-term memory loss.

203
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,748
So how can you remember you have a
family if you have short-term memory loss?

204
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:15,279
Good question.
Good question.

205
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:18,418
See, I can remember somethings
because well, they make sense.

206
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:20,334
Like... what.
I have a family.

207
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,950
I-I know, because I... You know,
I must've come from somewhere, right?

208
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:24,971
Everyone has a family.
And I may not remember

209
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:26,426
their names and
what they look like.

210
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:29,890
And I may not even be able
to ever find them again. But...

211
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:32,468
- What are we talking about?
- Mommies and daddies.

212
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:34,198
Mommies and daddies, right.

213
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:36,405
Why are we talking about
mommies and daddies?

214
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,825
Oh. Oh.
That class.

215
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,262
Oh oh.
Why me? Okay.

216
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:43,279
You guys seem
really young but...

217
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:44,998
Okay.
You see, kids.

218
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:46,750
When 2 fish love each other...

219
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:49,080
And, we'll stop right there.

220
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:50,776
Climb aboard, explorers.

221
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:54,877
I feel a migration
song coming on.

222
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:02,359
Migration, migration, let's learn about migration.

223
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:06,560
It's nature's inspiration
to move around the sea.

224
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:09,758
Here's a scientific commerce.

225
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:12,951
Where did everyone go?
By myself...

226
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,624
Oh there they are and back.

227
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:18,077
What's minus 4 degrees
based on solar positioning.

228
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:19,799
Oh, kids.
Stay away from the edge.

229
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:20,972
Okay. You hear that.
Okay.

230
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,073
Everybody stay back from the edge.
Come on.

231
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,188
- Okay, that's too far.
- That's too far, come on.

232
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:26,216
Come on, get back over here.
Back this way.

233
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:29,239
- Now, I need everyone to listen.
- Alright, listen up.

234
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:31,953
- When the rays pass through here,
- The rays, they are going to pass through.

235
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:35,492
- What do we have to be careful of?
- Everybody has to be careful of what?

236
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,084
- The undertow.
- The undertow.

237
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:38,651
- That's right.
- That's right.

238
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:41,488
The under...
The undertow.

239
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:47,069
Because the current created
by all the flapping is very strong.

240
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:49,077
If you are not careful,
you can get pull in.

241
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:52,367
Mr. Ray. So how do the stingrays
all know where to go?

242
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:54,741
That's what an instinct is, Nemo.

243
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:57,623
Something deep inside you
that feels so familiar that

244
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:59,260
... you have to listen to it.

245
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,941
Like a song you've always known.

246
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:05,363
And I can hear mine now!

247
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:07,856
Our hearts know where to go.

248
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:14,321
Oh, we're going home.

249
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:16,544
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

250
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:21,274
To make our way back home.

251
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:24,908
Oh, we're going home.

252
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:27,081
Wow.

253
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:33,677
We, see the undertow.

254
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:35,321
And we sang...
AH!

255
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:39,781
- Dory!
- Dory!

256
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:43,207
Dory.
Dory.

257
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:45,351
Huh!
Is she dead?

258
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:47,429
No, she's not dead.

259
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,940
Give her some space, everybody.

260
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:52,508
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.

261
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:54,926
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.

262
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:58,051
Oh. I remembered something.
It's uh.

263
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:59,669
Huh!
I remembered something.

264
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:01,664
I actually remembered something.
Something important.

265
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:04,511
Something important, what?
What was it?

266
00:13:04,903 --> 00:13:07,558
I'm not sure anymore.
But I can still feel it, it's...

267
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,087
Alright.
Thank you, Mr. Ray.

268
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:13,845
Try to remember better.
Don't be such a dory, Dory.

269
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:18,837
Uh. Oh!
Oh!

270
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:20,551
What?
Did you remember?

271
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:21,607
I don't remember.

272
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:23,376
It was something.
It was...

273
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:26,051
Oh, oh, oh.
It was something about... the...

274
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:27,849
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.

275
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,055
Huh!

276
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:33,310
My family!
I remember my family!

277
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:35,270
They are out there somewhere.
I have to find them.

278
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:36,734
Guys, you got to help me.
Guys.

279
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,560
Guys, hello?

280
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,759
Guys, where are you?

281
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:42,345
- Dory.
- Hello?

282
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,487
Dory.

283
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:44,757
Ah.

284
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:46,666
- Where did you go?
- You were the one who go.

285
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,460
My parents.
I remembered them.

286
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:49,776
What?
What did you remember?

287
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:50,902
I remember them.

288
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:53,217
My mom, my dad!
I have a family!

289
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:55,021
Oh.
They don't know where I am.

290
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,402
- Let's go. We have to go.
- Dory. No.

291
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:57,989
No!
This is crazy.

292
00:13:58,014 --> 00:13:59,682
Where exactly are you
trying to go?

293
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,252
To the... To the...
gym of the... Baltic.

294
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:04,476
- The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
- Yes!

295
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:07,075
No, Dory. California is all
the way across the ocean.

296
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,647
- Then we better get going.
- How come everytime

297
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,056
we're on the edge of this reef,
one of us is trying to leave?

298
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:14,973
For once, can't we
just enjoy the view.

299
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:17,615
How can you be talking about the view
when I remembered my family.

300
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,711
No! No!
We've done our ocean travels.

301
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:22,329
That part of our lives is over.
The only reason to travel

302
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,868
in the first place, is so you
don't have to travel ever again.

303
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:26,458
Yeah, but I want to...

304
00:14:27,317 --> 00:14:29,049
- Dory, look.
- Please.

305
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:31,870
All I know.

306
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,449
Is that I missed them.

307
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:40,687
I really, really missed them.
I didn't know what that felt like.

308
00:14:42,362 --> 00:14:44,559
Do you know
what that feels like?

309
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:53,796
Yes.
I know what that feels like.

310
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,553
I don't want to forget this.

311
00:14:56,871 --> 00:15:01,005
Somewhere out there
is my family.

312
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,876
Please, Marlin.

313
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:08,071
I can't find them on my own.
I'll forget.

314
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:10,127
Please help me find my family.

315
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:11,125
Yeah, Dad.

316
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,293
You can get us all the way
across the ocean. Right?

317
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:16,133
No.

318
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:21,311
But I know a guy.

319
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:24,268
Woo hoo!

320
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:28,066
Righteous!
Righteous!

321
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:30,349
Hoo hoo!
Ta-day!

322
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,561
Totally sick!
Totally sick!

323
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,143
I know.
Isn't it great?

324
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:53,614
No!
I'm going to be totally sick.

325
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,871
It's the California current, dude.
Got some abhorrent job.

326
00:15:56,898 --> 00:15:59,527
- Surf's up, dude.
- Aw!

327
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:01,345
Hey, dude,
if you're going to hurl,

328
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,539
just do me a solid.
Head to the back of the shell.

329
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:05,480
Lean out and
go for distance.

330
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,644
We call that,
"Feeding the fishes!"

331
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,827
.

332
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:11,235
And now, we are looking
for my parents at

333
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,933
the brooch of the
Atlantic or the...

334
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,048
- The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
- Exactly.

335
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:16,726
How are you going
to find your parents?

336
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:18,523
Do you remember what
they looked like?

337
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:20,698
I'm a bit new to the memory
thing so I can't say for sure.

338
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:23,470
But something tells me
they were mostly blue with...

339
00:16:23,495 --> 00:16:25,499
- ... maybe yellow.
- That sounds right.

340
00:16:25,524 --> 00:16:27,988
Also, I'm pretty sure I'm going
to know them when I see them.

341
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:28,948
We're family.

342
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:33,319
By the way, crossing the ocean is the
kind of thing you should only do once.

343
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:37,671
- One time!
- Morro bay, California's coming up, dudes.

344
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,947
Woo hoo!
Let's find my family.

345
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:41,138
Go! Go!
Go, go, go!

346
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:43,400
- Just go, Dad!
- Don't push me, Nemo.

347
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:46,014
- Woo!
- Ahh!

348
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:49,315
Woo hoo!
Ha ha.

349
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:52,708
So long, little blue.
I hope you find your parents.

350
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:55,442
And good luck feeding the fishes.

351
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:58,275
Too late, I already fed.

352
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,764
Oh.

353
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:04,929
This feels familiar.

354
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:06,449
Mom!
Dad!

355
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:08,987
Dory. Dory. Dory.
Wait. Wait.

356
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:12,646
- Mom! Dad!
- Stop yelling for a second.

357
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:14,262
Do you really think your parents
are just going to be

358
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:16,235
floating around here waiting for you?

359
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,577
Well, I... I don't know but
there's only one way to find out.

360
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,745
- Mom! Dad!
- Shout louder, Dory.

361
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,495
- MOM! DAD!
- Shhh shh shh.

362
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,749
Huh!
What was that?

363
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:27,979
Wait.
I heard that before.

364
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:29,773
I remembered someone
saying shh shh shh.

365
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,006
Yes, well done.
That was me, 1 minute ago.

366
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,031
- Shh shh shh.
- Huh!

367
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:37,737
Please, have you seen
my mommy and daddy?

368
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:40,182
Their names are
Jenny and Charlie.

369
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:41,665
- Shh shh shh.
- Shh shh shh.

370
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,556
Huh!
Jenny and Charlie.

371
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:47,037
- What? Jenny and what?
- Those are their names.

372
00:17:47,062 --> 00:17:48,938
My parents are
Jenny and Charlie!

373
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:50,065
- Shh shh shh.
- Dory, wait!

374
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,628
- Jenny!
- Can't we just take a moment

375
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,963
- Charlie!
- to come up with a plan.

376
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,186
- Jenny! Charlie!
- Shh shh shh.

377
00:17:55,211 --> 00:17:57,764
- Are you crazy?
- Sorry, she's-she's a little excited.

378
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:00,919
- Jenny! Charlie!
- Dory. Dory. Stop yelling for a second.

379
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:03,693
It's not a good idea to come
into a new neighborhood

380
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:06,022
and call this much
attention to yourself.

381
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:08,436
You don't understand.
I remembered my parents names.

382
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:09,982
- Jenny Charlie!
- Dory. Dory.

383
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,692
These crabs are locals.

384
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:14,206
And I get the feeling they are
shushing us for a reason.

385
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:16,856
- You might wake up something dangerous.
- Are you talking about.

386
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:19,272
Like something with one big eye,
tentacles and a snappy thing?

387
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:22,214
Well, that's very specific.
But something like that, yes.

388
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:25,014
You just in general
don't want to...

389
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:27,920
- Oh, hi.
- Oh boy.

390
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:28,971
Goodness.

391
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:30,706
Okay.
We made a mistake.

392
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:33,515
We're backing away.
Let us live.

393
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,357
And we will...
We'll worship you.

394
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,089
- We'll build a...
- Uh.

395
00:18:37,114 --> 00:18:39,578
Do you like a...
Do you like a monument?

396
00:18:39,603 --> 00:18:41,428
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

397
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:49,468
Whoa!

398
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:51,760
Swim for your life!

399
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:11,026
- Nemo!
- Nemo!

400
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:14,258
- Nemo!
- Dad!

401
00:19:19,747 --> 00:19:20,805
Nooo!

402
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,938
Nemo, hold on to me!
And don't let go!

403
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,728
Dory! Dory.
Dory, slow down.

404
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:35,949
- We're not being chased anymore.
- Are you sure?

405
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,182
AH!

406
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:42,433
Jenny.
Jenny and Charlie.

407
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,562
Jenny and Charlie!

408
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:45,427
Jen...
I just-I just remembered their names.

409
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,527
We have to keep going,
we're so close. Huh?

410
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:48,557
Are you hurt?

411
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:50,855
Huh!
Oh my goodness, Nemo.

412
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,403
- Are you okay? What happened?
- Not now, Dory. Please.

413
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:55,976
- Oh no. Oh no. Nemo.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

414
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:58,978
Oh no. Oh, Nemo.
I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

415
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:00,799
Huh!
Oh my goodness.

416
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,156
- Nemo, are you okay?
- I said not now.

417
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,958
- You've done enough.
- I have?

418
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:07,792
Oh no.
But I... I can fix it.

419
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:09,440
I can.
I'll go get help.

420
00:20:09,465 --> 00:20:12,447
You know what you can do, Dory?
You can go wait over there.

421
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:16,946
Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best.

422
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:19,609
You're right.

423
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,055
I don't know why I thought
I could do this.

424
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,202
Find my family, I can't do this.
I'm so sorry.

425
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:26,649
- I'll fix it.
- I'm okay.

426
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:27,915
Well.
I'm going to get help, okay?

427
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,508
Okay? I can do that.
I'll-I'll be...

428
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,974
It will be alright, Nemo.

429
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:37,822
Hello?
Someone, hello.

430
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:39,776
Anyone?
Hello.

431
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:42,246
- Anyone?
- Hello.

432
00:20:43,228 --> 00:20:46,116
- Hello?
- I'm Sigourney Weaver.

433
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:49,040
Oh. Hi, Sigourney.
I need your help.

434
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:52,830
- Won't you please join us.
- Oh, Great, great, great.

435
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:56,491
As we explore the wonders
of the Pacific ocean

436
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:59,507
and the amazing life
it holds within.

437
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:03,478
Sigourney?
Sigourney Weaver, where are you?

438
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:05,697
- Dory, there you are!
- Guys, I found help.

439
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,564
Sigourney Weaver is going to
tell us where we are.

440
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:08,634
- Look out!
- Ah!

441
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:11,433
- Aw. Look at this.
- No respect for ocean life.

442
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,858
- Marlin! Nemo!
- Dory!

443
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:14,907
No, no, no.
Not again! Not again!

444
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:17,396
Let's take her inside
and see how she does.

445
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,326
- Dory! Dory!
- Don't worry, Dory!

446
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:24,006
Keep calm!
We'll come find you!

447
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:26,915
And welcome to the
Marine Life Institute,

448
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,095
where we believe in rescue,
rehabilitation and release.

449
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:35,594
Marlin?
Nemo?

450
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,951
Hello? Hello?
Can you help me?

451
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:45,087
Me? Help you?
Ah-choo!

452
00:21:45,112 --> 00:21:46,228
Ehhh.

453
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:47,677
AHH!

454
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:50,586
Ah!
Huh!

455
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:51,917
Huh!

456
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:54,653
Huh?
What's happening?

457
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:56,592
- Help.
- Looks like we're done here.

458
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:57,633
Dude, cut it out.

459
00:21:57,658 --> 00:21:58,902
You're a scientist.
We've talked about this.

460
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:01,029
Oh, come on.
It's funny.

461
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:09,365
Okay.
Okay.

462
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:23,238
Just get a hold of yourself.

463
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:24,369
Ah!

464
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:26,640
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

465
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:28,697
- Hey, you.
- Oh.

466
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,945
- Spinner.
- Huh! Thank goodness.

467
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,472
- Hi, I'm Dory. I'm...
- Name's Hank.

468
00:22:33,497 --> 00:22:35,247
- How sick are you?
- Sick? I'm sick?

469
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:36,542
Why else would you
be in quarantine.

470
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:38,271
Oh no.
How long do I have?

471
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:40,168
- I have to find my family.
- Alright now. Don't get hysterical.

472
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,676
Oh oh.
Not good.

473
00:22:41,702 --> 00:22:43,266
What? What is it?
What happened?

474
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,400
- Huh! What's that?
- That there, is bad news.

475
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:50,089
It's a transport tag for fish who
can't cut it inside the institute.

476
00:22:50,114 --> 00:22:51,870
They get transferred
to permanent digs.

477
00:22:51,895 --> 00:22:55,132
An aquarium in Cleveland.

478
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:57,421
Fish in here,
go back into the ocean.

479
00:22:57,446 --> 00:23:00,355
- Cleveland fish, stay there forever.
- Huh!

480
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,536
Cleveland, no!
I can't go to the Cleveland.

481
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:05,644
I have to get to the jewel of Morro bay,
California, and find my family.

482
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:07,864
That's this place,
The Marine Life Institute.

483
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:09,950
The jewel of Morro bay, California.

484
00:23:09,975 --> 00:23:12,222
- You're here.
- You mean I'm from here?

485
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:14,599
My parents are here.
I have to get to them.

486
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,506
- So what exhibit are you from?
- Wait. I'm from an exhibit?

487
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,496
Which one?
I have to get there.

488
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,172
That's a hard one, kid.
Unless.

489
00:23:23,197 --> 00:23:25,595
Nah. It'd never work.
It's too crazy.

490
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,656
What do you mean? Just tell me.
I'm okay with crazy.

491
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,140
You know I can see that.

492
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:32,322
Well, there's one thing I can think of
to help you get to your family.

493
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:35,204
- If I just take...
- Yes! Great idea.

494
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:37,396
You take me to find them.
Why didn't I think of that?

495
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:40,328
Uh. No, no, no.
If I just take your tag.

496
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:42,781
I can take your place
on the transport truck.

497
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:45,178
Then you can go back inside
and find your family.

498
00:23:45,203 --> 00:23:47,359
All you have to do
is give me the tag.

499
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,047
What tag? Huh!
There's a tag on my fin.

500
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:52,189
Huh? How can you forget
you have a tag on your fin?

501
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:54,533
Oh no. I' sorry.
I...

502
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,066
I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

503
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:59,149
You don't remember what
we were talking about?

504
00:23:59,174 --> 00:24:01,910
Mm-mm, not a clue.
What were we talking about?

505
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:03,146
Um.

506
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:04,538
You were about to
give me your tag.

507
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:06,644
Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why-Why do you want it?

508
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:08,323
SO I CAN GO TO...!

509
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:11,984
- So that I can go to Cleveland.
- Cleveland.

510
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:13,611
I hear good things about Cleveland.
Why do you want to go there.

511
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:15,921
Because if I stay here I'm going
to get released back into the ocean.

512
00:24:15,946 --> 00:24:18,831
And I have extremely unpleasant
memories of that place!

513
00:24:19,787 --> 00:24:21,904
I just want to live
in a glass box alone.

514
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:23,916
That's all I want.

515
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:25,257
GIVE ME YOUR TAG!

516
00:24:25,282 --> 00:24:27,330
Hey, man.
Don't touch my tag.

517
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:30,888
Look.

518
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,620
I don't work here.

519
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:39,550
It's not like I have
a map of this place.

520
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:40,880
Huh! A map.
Good idea.

521
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:42,129
You take me to the map.

522
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:44,902
I figure out where my parents are.
Oh boy.

523
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:46,363
Alright.

524
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,958
If I get you to your family
will you give me...

525
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:50,636
I don't have much.
Um.

526
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:53,192
I... How about if
I give you this tag.

527
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:55,164
Great idea.

528
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:03,406
Are you absolutely sure
that's what I said?

529
00:25:03,431 --> 00:25:06,082
"Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best."

530
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:07,227
- Yeah, Dad.
- I said that?

531
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:08,282
You said that.

532
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,319
Dory swam to the surface, and
then she got taken by someone...

533
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:11,949
Alright, I don't want to
hear the whole story again.

534
00:25:11,974 --> 00:25:13,729
I was just asking
about the one part.

535
00:25:13,754 --> 00:25:16,968
Because, look, if I said that.
I'm not positive I did.

536
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:20,703
It's-It's actually a complement.
Because I asked her to wait.

537
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,508
And I said,
"It's what you do best."

538
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:24,415
So I...
I...

539
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,610
Oh, it's my fault!
It's all my fault!

540
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:29,889
She got kidnapped and taken into...
whatever this place is.

541
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:31,404
What if it's a restaurant?

542
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,787
Oy! You two.
Shut it.

543
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:37,853
Yeah, we're trying to sleep.
And you interrupted my favourite dream.

544
00:25:37,878 --> 00:25:39,781
Is that the one about
you laying on this rock?

545
00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:42,139
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is a good one.

546
00:25:42,164 --> 00:25:43,857
- Oh. Yeah.
- It's one of my favorites.

547
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:45,957
- Uh, Excuse us. Hello.
- Son. Son. Son.

548
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:47,490
- We're trying...
- Those are sea lions.

549
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,341
They are natural predators.
They could pounce at any moment.

550
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:55,884
- They don't look very pouncey.
- That's what they want you to think.

551
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:58,807
Just get behind me
and let me do the talking.

552
00:25:58,832 --> 00:25:59,880
Excuse me.

553
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:02,248
We're worried about our friend.
Is that a restaurant?

554
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:05,634
Ah ha, mate.
It's not a restaurant.

555
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:07,858
- Your friend is okay.
- She is?

556
00:26:07,883 --> 00:26:11,290
It's a fish hospital.
Sigourney Weaver says,

557
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:13,809
she'll be rescued, rehabilitated
and released.

558
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:16,048
She'll be in and out in a jiff.
We should know.

559
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:17,746
- Nasal parasite.
- Anemia.

560
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:19,979
All fixed up and
sent on our way.

561
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:22,256
Oh.
Thank goodness.

562
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:25,470
Sure. That's alright.
Don't you worry...

563
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,941
- Oy! Gerald.
- Gerald! Get off!

564
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:28,038
- Shove off!
- Get off, Gerald!

565
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:29,583
- No, you know that! Off!
- You're not fond of.

566
00:26:29,608 --> 00:26:32,115
- Off!
- Off!

567
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,542
Don't you worry about a thing.

568
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:39,675
That place is the Marine Life Institute.
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.

569
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,571
Huh!
She was right.

570
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:44,065
Looks like Dory can do
something besides forget.

571
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,875
Thank you, Nemo.
Thank you for that.

572
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,324
So how are we
going to get inside?

573
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:49,412
Wait.
You want to get inside, me lad?

574
00:26:49,437 --> 00:26:52,206
Desperately.
Our friend is in there, lost, alone.

575
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:54,698
She's scared.
She'll have no idea what to do.

576
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:56,396
Oh.

577
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:59,151
- We know a way.
- You do?

578
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:03,113
What are they doing?

579
00:27:03,138 --> 00:27:05,526
I don't know.
It sounds bad.

580
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:07,829
- Are we there yet?
- Shh, keep it down.

581
00:27:07,854 --> 00:27:09,988
Hank, I'm so glad
I found you.

582
00:27:10,013 --> 00:27:12,091
It feels like... destiny.

583
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:14,936
For what must be the millionth time.
It's not destiny.

584
00:27:14,961 --> 00:27:16,558
Oh oh.
Have I said destiny before?

585
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,143
I'm sorry.
I'm just so nervous

586
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:19,475
because I'm going
to meet my parents.

587
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,523
I hadn't seen them in...
I don't even know how long.

588
00:27:21,548 --> 00:27:22,958
Because, you see I suffer from

589
00:27:22,983 --> 00:27:24,098
- short-term memory loss.
- Short-term memory loss.

590
00:27:24,123 --> 00:27:25,899
Look. No more talking, okay?
I don't like talking.

591
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:27,369
I don't like chattering,
questions and...

592
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:28,467
"How are you?",
"Oh, I'm fine."

593
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:29,822
"How are you?",
"Oh, I'm fine too."

594
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:31,601
News flash.
Nobody's fine.

595
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:33,720
Oh, I'm fine.
How are you?

596
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,716
Hank, look.
There's a map.

597
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:37,482
Shhh. The plan is
you're going to read that.

598
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:39,091
And figure out
where your parents live.

599
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,334
And I'm on a truck
to Cleveland.

600
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,647
- You got it?
- Got it.

601
00:27:41,672 --> 00:27:44,055
- What was the first part again?
- Oh.

602
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,295
What?
The octopus escaped again.

603
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,697
Wow.
Look at all the exhibits.

604
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:50,713
How can you do this park
in one day, seriously.

605
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,414
- Pick one!
- Okay.

606
00:27:53,189 --> 00:27:54,820
Well, tell everyone to
keep an eye out.

607
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,131
I mean, we're suppose to be releasing
the octopus back to the ocean today.

608
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:02,058
Well.
Of course I haven't seen it.

609
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,758
If I was looking...

610
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,378
Hey.
There you are.

611
00:28:06,403 --> 00:28:08,281
- Hurry up.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

612
00:28:08,306 --> 00:28:09,874
It starts with a 'K'.

613
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:13,216
<font color=#ff80c0>[KID ZONE]</font>    <font color=#64cdff>[OPEN OCEAN]</font>
- Kiidd Zzz onee.
Kid zone.

614
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,412
No. No, kids.
Kids grab things.

615
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:17,277
And I'm not losing
another tentacle for you.

616
00:28:17,302 --> 00:28:18,457
You lost a tentacle?

617
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:21,272
Well, then you're not an octopus,
you're a septopus.

618
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:22,742
I may not remember
but I can count.

619
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,699
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

620
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:26,774
Journey to the deep.

621
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,108
Hey look, shells.
Huh!

622
00:28:30,315 --> 00:28:32,580
Hey look, shells.

623
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:36,306
- Daddy, here's a shell for you.
- Oh, that's great, Dory.

624
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:38,355
- You found another one.
- I did?

625
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,123
Oh yes, you did.
You're getting good at this, Dory.

626
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,728
Hey look, shells.

627
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:50,213
- Hey, I live here.
- Yes. Yes indeed.

628
00:28:50,238 --> 00:28:51,797
I like shells.

629
00:28:51,822 --> 00:28:54,643
Ahaha.
That's right, dear.

630
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:58,335
Do you think you can
find me another shell?

631
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,855
The purple ones are my favourite.

632
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:04,054
Okay, Mommy.

633
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:06,482
Oh, Mommy.

634
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:07,994
Purple shell.
Purple shell.

635
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:10,408
- Hank, my home had a purple shell.
- So what?

636
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:12,307
Half the exhibits here
have purple shells in them.

637
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:13,588
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

638
00:29:13,613 --> 00:29:15,916
I remember her now.
Purple shells were her favourite.

639
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:18,121
And she had this adorable giggle
and my dad was really funny.

640
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:20,597
And now your wacky memories
are going to get us caught.

641
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:25,844
Still think this is destiny?

642
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,189
- Hank, we need to find my folks.
- Quiet.

643
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,068
Base, this is Carol.

644
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:40,816
I think I might have
found that missing octopus.

645
00:29:41,923 --> 00:29:43,233
- See what you did?
- Sorry.

646
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:45,289
This could not be worse.

647
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:49,317
DES-TI-NY.
Huh, Destiny?

648
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:50,377
- Come on.
- Hank.

649
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:51,859
- Don't talk just hide.
- I got a feeling.

650
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:53,547
- I think we should get into the bucket.
- No, stop.

651
00:29:53,572 --> 00:29:55,377
Seriously, it says 'Destiny'.
And it is.

652
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:56,998
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We got to get in that bucket.

653
00:29:57,023 --> 00:29:58,385
I'm not going with you
in that bucket.

654
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,017
- I go in that bucket.
- Don't. Don't go in that bucket!

655
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,280
Bye.

656
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:06,726
Hey, guys.
I'm looking for my family.

657
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:09,449
Oh, good idea.
Play dead.

658
00:30:15,455 --> 00:30:17,151
I'm sorry.
I got to blink.

659
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:19,511
How do you hold your
eyes open that long?

660
00:30:30,226 --> 00:30:31,708
Hey, guys.

661
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,908
Wait a second.
Ah!

662
00:30:38,954 --> 00:30:39,967
Ah!

663
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:43,312
Our next guest, has been
here a very long time.

664
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:47,117
She's a whale shark.
Her name is Destiny.

665
00:30:47,142 --> 00:30:48,468
Destiny, really?

666
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:51,270
You'll notice,
she's extremely near sighted.

667
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:53,754
And has trouble navigating
her environments.

668
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:56,405
Oh.
And here she comes now.

669
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,561
Ooo. Destiny.
Huh! You're a fish?

670
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:03,005
Wait.
What?

671
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,313
Hi. Hello there.
Can you help me?

672
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:07,169
Whoa!

673
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:09,905
Alright, I'll go with you.

674
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,229
- Excuse me, hi.
- Who is that?

675
00:31:12,254 --> 00:31:13,628
Is that blue blob talking?

676
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:15,270
Can you help me?
I lost my family.

677
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:17,338
- You lost your family?
- Well, it's a long story.

678
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:19,150
And truth be told,
I don't remember most of it.

679
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:20,878
Oh, that is so sad.
You poor thing.

680
00:31:20,903 --> 00:31:22,232
OW!

681
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:27,765
Sorry, not a great swimmer.
I can't see very well.

682
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,365
Oh.
I think you swim beautifully.

683
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,728
In fact, I've never seen a fish
swim like that before.

684
00:31:31,753 --> 00:31:33,193
Thank youuu.

685
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:35,924
Youuuu're welcommme.

686
00:31:35,949 --> 00:31:37,317
Wait.
Say that again.

687
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:40,558
Um.
Youuuu're welcommme.

688
00:31:40,582 --> 00:31:41,993
- Dory?
- Yes.

689
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:43,133
- Dory.
- Yes.

690
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:44,287
- Dory?
- Yes.

691
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:45,968
- Ah, Dory.
- Yes.

692
00:31:45,993 --> 00:31:47,930
- You and I were friends!
- No.

693
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:50,579
- Dory, it's me, Destiny.
- You know me?

694
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:53,300
Of course. We talked through
the pipes when we were little.

695
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:55,675
- We were pipe-pals!
- We were?

696
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,256
Aw, you're so pretty.

697
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:58,792
- So you know where I'm from?
- Yep.

698
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,988
You, are from the
open ocean exhibit.

699
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,721
- Oh!
- I'm from the open ocean exhibit?

700
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:04,166
Then that's where my parents are.

701
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:05,934
We got to go.
Can you take me there?

702
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:08,462
Uh. Kind of tough for a whale
to travel around here.

703
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:10,701
Can you please keep it
down over there.

704
00:32:10,726 --> 00:32:12,790
- My head hurts.
- Who's that?

705
00:32:12,815 --> 00:32:13,950
- That's my neighbor, Bailey.
- Uh-huh.

706
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:15,351
He was brought in
with a head injury.

707
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:16,640
I know you're talking
about me, Destiny.

708
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:18,298
He thinks he can't
use his echolocation

709
00:32:18,323 --> 00:32:19,941
- but I overheard the doctors talking.
- I'm right here.

710
00:32:19,966 --> 00:32:21,476
There's not a thing
wrong with him.

711
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:23,029
I can hear every word
you're saying about me.

712
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:24,438
What's echolocation?

713
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:27,189
Well, Bailey's head is suppose
to put out a call and the echo

714
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:29,476
helps him find objects far away.

715
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:33,225
Oh but apparently,
he's still healing.

716
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,723
Now I know you're
talking about me.

717
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:36,645
- I really can... echolocate.
- Oh.

718
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,225
I cannot have this conversation again.
I just can't.

719
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,415
I hit my head very
hard out there.

720
00:32:40,454 --> 00:32:43,188
- See how swollen it is?
- Your head is suppose to be big.

721
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,139
- You're a Beluga.
- Echolocation.

722
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,599
Oh. Like the world's most
powerful pair of glasses?

723
00:32:48,624 --> 00:32:50,007
- What?
- What are glasses?

724
00:32:50,032 --> 00:32:53,350
Sort of like, you go wooo.
And then you see things.

725
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,690
Why do I know that?

726
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:58,163
Oh.
That's interesting.

727
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:01,255
- There you are.
- Hank.

728
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,847
- Listen up. You and I are square.
- Hank.

729
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:05,253
I took you to the map,
now give me that tag.

730
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,373
Wait, wait, wait.
No.

731
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:08,334
I know where my parents are.
They are in...

732
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,559
What's it called.
The place... it's... silted ocean.

733
00:33:10,584 --> 00:33:11,607
- Open ocean.
- Open ocean.

734
00:33:11,632 --> 00:33:12,695
- Open ocean!
- Huh!

735
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,990
Open ocean.
I know where that is!

736
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:18,044
That's the exhibit located
right next to, I don't care.

737
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:19,144
- Easy.
- Huh!

738
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:20,908
If you are trying to get to
the open ocean exhibit,

739
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:22,415
just go through the pipes.

740
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,689
- Through the pipes, great.
- Through the pipes?

741
00:33:24,714 --> 00:33:26,910
Yep. Take two lefts.
Swim straight, and you'll hit it.

742
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:28,807
Oh, that's a lot of directions.

743
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,114
That's... Did you get that, Hank?
All that?

744
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:33,542
- Uh, yeah.
- Great, let's go.

745
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:35,656
I'm not going with you.
I won't fit.

746
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,347
You'll have to go by yourself.

747
00:33:37,372 --> 00:33:38,852
Um.

748
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:42,090
Uh. That's...
That... I'm...

749
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:45,712
See, I can't.
Because I'm not so good with directions.

750
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:47,516
Well, that's too bad.
A deal is a deal.

751
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,933
You want to find your parents.
That's how you get to them.

752
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:51,256
- Now give me your tag.
- But, Hank.

753
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,615
I... can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.

754
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,356
Not my problem.
Tag.

755
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:56,753
But I can't get in that way.

756
00:33:56,778 --> 00:33:58,417
Well, I'm sorry.
But there's no other way!

757
00:33:58,442 --> 00:34:00,473
There's no other way.
Huh!

758
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,678
There's no other way.

759
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:05,264
- Now, now, don't panic.
- No dear.

760
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:07,288
It's okay.
You know, not everything in life

761
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:09,509
is easy to do.
Isn't that right, Charlie?

762
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:10,909
Yeah.
Your mother's right.

763
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:13,897
When something is too hard, Dory.
You should just give up.

764
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:15,350
- Charlie!
- A joke.

765
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,849
- I'm kidding, just a joke.
- Okay.

766
00:34:16,874 --> 00:34:18,791
A joke.
Uh, caution.

767
00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:21,189
- Joker at work.
- Joke, I got it.

768
00:34:21,514 --> 00:34:25,117
You see, cupcake.
There's always another way.

769
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,542
Thank you, Daddy.

770
00:34:29,057 --> 00:34:30,674
Thank you, Daddy.

771
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:33,303
Huh! Nope.
My father said there's always another way.

772
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:34,841
What?
There is no other way.

773
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:37,214
Open ocean. Open ocean.
Open ocean.

774
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,215
Open Ocean, I'm pretty sure
it's the building over there.

775
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,769
It's ill defined and roundish.

776
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:44,325
- Like Bailey's head.
- Wait. What?

777
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,973
There's always another way.
There's always... huh!

778
00:34:45,998 --> 00:34:47,216
There.

779
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,849
Guys, follow me.
I know how we can get to locomotion.

780
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:51,555
- Open ocean.
- Open ocean.
- Exactly.

781
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:53,371
Uh.
Guys.

782
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:56,514
Guys. You know I can't
swim over there, right?

783
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:01,964
I don't see how this is
going to get us inside.

784
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:05,024
- What are you even doing?
- We're calling her over, of course.

785
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:07,839
Calling her over.
Calling who over?

786
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:14,596
Lads.
Meet Becky.

787
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,688
Flying?
No no no...

788
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:21,281
New information.
Listen, tell her thank you.

789
00:35:21,306 --> 00:35:23,799
I mean, you guys have gone
above and beyond, really.

790
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:27,977
But is there a way to get in
that involves like swimming.

791
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:29,585
Because that's really our strength.

792
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:32,175
Look, your friend is going
to be in quarantine.

793
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:34,270
<font color=#6fffb7>+ QUARANTINE</font>
- That's where they take
the sick fish.

794
00:35:34,295 --> 00:35:38,684
And the one and only one way
into that place is Becky.

795
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:43,140
Hi, Becky.
Ow!

796
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:44,779
Stop.
Lets call her Pecky.

797
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,156
- This is really...
- I think she likes you, Dad.

798
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:48,550
Becky, love.

799
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:52,115
These 2 nice fish need
to get into quarantine.

800
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,318
Are you free today, Rebecca darling?

801
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:57,584
Becky, is...
Would that work with your schedule?

802
00:35:57,609 --> 00:35:59,785
Ow.
She doesn't understand what I'm saying.

803
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,524
All you have to do
is imprint with her, mate.

804
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:03,343
I'm... what?

805
00:36:03,368 --> 00:36:04,519
- Imprint.
- Imprint.

806
00:36:04,544 --> 00:36:06,775
Look her in the eye
and say, Oorrooo.

807
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,663
And she'll be
in sync with you.

808
00:36:08,703 --> 00:36:12,260
- Now, look her in the eye.
- Yeah!

809
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,749
Nemo.

810
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:15,834
I think we should device
and alternate plan.

811
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:17,707
One that involves
staying in the water

812
00:36:17,732 --> 00:36:21,004
That's all I'm saying.
Because this bird, this bird...

813
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:23,095
- This ain't the bird!
- That's find, Dad.

814
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,080
And in the mean time,
Dory will just forget us.

815
00:36:25,105 --> 00:36:27,868
Like you say.
It's what she does best.

816
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:29,767
Fine.

817
00:36:30,203 --> 00:36:34,024
Uh, okay.
Look her in the eye.

818
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:37,085
- Which-Which eye?
- Just pick one, mate.

819
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,603
Becky.

820
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,503
Oorroo, Becky.

821
00:36:50,718 --> 00:36:54,134
Okay.
This is all great.

822
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:57,610
How exactly is Becky
suppose to carry us?

823
00:36:57,634 --> 00:37:00,333
Oh, yeah.
I almost forgot.

824
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,328
Gerald.

825
00:37:02,656 --> 00:37:04,853
Gerald.
Give us your pail.

826
00:37:04,886 --> 00:37:06,620
We'll let you sit on the rock.

827
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:09,710
Yeah, Gerald.
We swear it.

828
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:14,218
That's right.
Chive on over here.

829
00:37:14,243 --> 00:37:16,614
Come on, you can do it.

830
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,084
- That's right.
- Mind your nose, scuff your bump.

831
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:24,890
Thank you so much, Gerald.

832
00:37:24,915 --> 00:37:28,593
Welcome to your time
on this rock.

833
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,945
Comfortable, ain't it?

834
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:32,769
- Time's up.
- Time's up.

835
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:33,923
- Now get off!
- Get off, Gerald!

836
00:37:33,948 --> 00:37:35,259
- Off!
- Off!

837
00:37:35,411 --> 00:37:36,621
This is nuts!

838
00:37:36,646 --> 00:37:39,882
Why do I keep getting
talked into insane choices?

839
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:41,438
Good luck!

840
00:37:45,727 --> 00:37:47,290
Okay.
When I tell you, you're gonna...

841
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:49,693
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I'm gonna signal with a big splash.

842
00:37:49,718 --> 00:37:50,891
On my mark.

843
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:54,515
Not clear yet.
Not clear yet.

844
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,564
- Now?
- Not till Destiny gives the signal.

845
00:37:58,332 --> 00:37:59,755
You know something?

846
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,301
I've no idea why
you're even doing this.

847
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:03,433
What do you mean?

848
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:06,010
It seems like a lot of trouble
just to find some more fish.

849
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,439
If I had short-term memory loss,

850
00:38:07,464 --> 00:38:09,393
I just swim off into the blue
and forget everything.

851
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:11,428
I don't want to do that.
I want my family.

852
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:13,972
Not me, kid.
I don't want anyone to worry about.

853
00:38:13,997 --> 00:38:16,643
You're lucky, no memories.

854
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:18,979
- No problems.
- Huh.

855
00:38:19,004 --> 00:38:21,127
No memories, no problems.

856
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:24,694
Still not clear.
Still not clear.

857
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,192
You don't have to say it
when it's not time.

858
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:27,438
- Not...
- Just tell me when it is time.

859
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:29,764
Okay, here we go.
And wait!

860
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:31,192
Here we go, wait.
Are you serious?

861
00:38:31,216 --> 00:38:32,285
Okay, on the count of three.

862
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,524
- Don't count, just say go.
- GO!

863
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:35,565
Now! Now!
Do it! Do it!

864
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,960
Wow, look at that.
I mean...

865
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:39,423
- That's the signal!
- Go, go, go. That's the signal!

866
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:45,686
Now remember.

867
00:38:45,711 --> 00:38:49,902
- Destiny said, follow the signs to
the Open Ocean exhibit.
- Uh-huh.

868
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,721
I can't see squat.
So it's your job to look for it.

869
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:55,140
Got it.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.

870
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:56,758
I'm just going to repeat it, okay?
That should work.

871
00:38:56,783 --> 00:38:59,338
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.

872
00:38:59,363 --> 00:39:00,708
Go right.

873
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,538
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.

874
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:04,816
Ow!

875
00:39:05,514 --> 00:39:06,696
Left.

876
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:09,413
And steer clear of people, will you.
Especially kids.

877
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:12,498
- I don't want to be touched.
- Shh. Do not mess me up.

878
00:39:12,523 --> 00:39:14,562
- Ah!
- Wah!

879
00:39:14,587 --> 00:39:15,856
Oh, poor baby.

880
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:17,632
Let me get that for you.
Here you...

881
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:18,824
Woo!

882
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:21,064
Oh my.

883
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:23,738
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

884
00:39:23,763 --> 00:39:24,794
Oh, sorry.

885
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:27,015
Okay.
I was looking, looking...

886
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,365
Oorroo, Becky.

887
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,724
Drop us anywhere.
We're okay.

888
00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:30,890
Just wait, Dad.

889
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:32,917
I think she's looking
for a place to land.

890
00:39:32,957 --> 00:39:34,574
She's confuse, Nemo!

891
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,041
She doesn't even know
which way to look!

892
00:39:42,986 --> 00:39:44,310
Wait, wait, wait!
Becky! Becky!

893
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:45,979
What are you doing?
Oorroo.

894
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:48,026
Oorroo roo roo roo.

895
00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:52,274
Okay, it's going somewhere.
The question is where?

896
00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:54,194
Which way?
Do you see the sign?

897
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:55,409
I'm looking.
I'm looking.

898
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:57,329
Something to something
that gets me to my family.

899
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:00,406
My family!
The world's most powerful pair of glasses.

900
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,647
I know that.
Why do I know that?

901
00:40:02,672 --> 00:40:04,948
It's another memory.
Hank, we need to go that way.

902
00:40:04,973 --> 00:40:07,021
Left.
Go-go left.

903
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,023
<font color=#00ffff>OPEN OCEAN ></font>

904
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:13,002
Becky.
Oorroo, oorroo.

905
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,940
She can't hear you, Dad.

906
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:16,975
Alright, alright, alright.
New plan.

907
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,957
We have to get closer to Becky
so she can hear us.

908
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:22,329
I don't think we should
move the pail.

909
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:23,817
Nemo.

910
00:40:24,795 --> 00:40:26,570
Without me, Becky's lost.

911
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:29,434
- Dad, just trust her.
- Trust her?

912
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:31,377
So she can forget us altogether?

913
00:40:31,402 --> 00:40:33,426
- I trust Becky.
- You trust Becky.

914
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:35,513
Becky's eating a cup.

915
00:40:36,862 --> 00:40:39,806
Becky. Beck?
Oorroo.

916
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:48,171
GIFT SHOP

917
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,405
Well.

918
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:52,347
At least we're not stuck
in a bucket anymore.

919
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,941
We're on top of quarantine.

920
00:40:57,966 --> 00:41:00,863
The baby otter tour
is beginning now.

921
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:02,676
Why, thanks, Sigourney Weaver.

922
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:05,238
Hey, who want's to
learn about otters?

923
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:08,659
Looking for the world's most
powerful pair of glasses.

924
00:41:08,684 --> 00:41:09,904
Huh!
Otters!

925
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:11,746
It's a huge cuddle party!

926
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:14,549
Huh!
Cuddle party, I'm in.

927
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:16,837
Where are we?
Are we close to open ocean?

928
00:41:16,862 --> 00:41:18,609
Uh, yes, I think.
Well, I don't know.

929
00:41:18,634 --> 00:41:20,669
- But I saw that other sign so...
- What? What other sign?

930
00:41:20,694 --> 00:41:22,351
The world's most powerful
pair of glasses.

931
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,040
What?
What are you talking about?

932
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:27,318
- Why would we follow that sign?
- Well... Because I remembered it.

933
00:41:27,343 --> 00:41:29,121
No, no, no.
That wasn't the plan.

934
00:41:29,146 --> 00:41:30,895
WAHH!

935
00:41:31,397 --> 00:41:33,109
Alright, that's it!

936
00:41:33,149 --> 00:41:34,822
- You've wasted my time.
- Wait, no.

937
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:37,566
That transport truck leaves at dawn
and I'm not missing it.

938
00:41:37,591 --> 00:41:38,922
- So give me your tag.
- Wait. No.

939
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:40,824
- Now I remember that sign.
- So?

940
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:43,739
So I'm remembering more and more
and I feel like my memory is getting better.

941
00:41:43,764 --> 00:41:45,938
- I think we should...
- NO! Your memory is not working!

942
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,464
You can't remember anything!

943
00:41:47,489 --> 00:41:50,044
It's probably how you lost
your family in the first place!

944
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:51,229
Huh!

945
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,817
Alright. Look.
Let's just take it down a notch.

946
00:41:55,842 --> 00:41:57,814
- Just give me the tag, you know.
- You know something?

947
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,048
For a guy with 3 hearts
you're not very nice.

948
00:42:00,073 --> 00:42:01,655
3 hearts?
What are you talking about?

949
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,257
- I don't have 3 hearts.
- Yes, you do.

950
00:42:03,282 --> 00:42:04,312
- I don't.
- You do.

951
00:42:04,337 --> 00:42:05,189
- Don't.
- Do!

952
00:42:05,214 --> 00:42:06,809
- Stop saying that!
- Fun fact.

953
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:09,193
The octopus has 3 hearts.

954
00:42:09,218 --> 00:42:10,576
- 2 pump blood to the gills.
- What?

955
00:42:10,608 --> 00:42:12,927
- While the third pumps blood
through out the body.
- Wait.

956
00:42:14,459 --> 00:42:15,947
<font color=#ffff80>KID ZONE</font>

957
00:42:16,644 --> 00:42:18,983
You know, someone with 3 hearts
shouldn't be so mean.

958
00:42:19,008 --> 00:42:21,815
And it's mean to say that
I would lose someone I love!

959
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,616
<font color=#ffa579>INTERACTIVE
FISH POND</font>

960
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:24,879
I did not lose them!

961
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:26,432
Hank?

962
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,686
Hank!

963
00:42:29,262 --> 00:42:30,463
Hank?

964
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:31,515
Hands.

965
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,652
No, not Hans.
I'm looking for Hank.

966
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,806
- Hands.
- Hank, with a 'k'. "Hankk."

967
00:42:35,831 --> 00:42:38,273
- Hands!
- Hands?

968
00:42:38,298 --> 00:42:39,847
Oh, hands!

969
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,415
Hank!
Hank?

970
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:46,549
- My arm!
- Hank!

971
00:42:46,574 --> 00:42:48,605
<font color=#ffa579>INTERACTIVE
FISH POND</font>

972
00:42:49,922 --> 00:42:51,593
Where are you, Hank?!

973
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:54,685
Can you please help me?
I'm looking for...

974
00:42:56,161 --> 00:42:57,614
Please help me.
I've lost my friend, Frank.

975
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,312
- I'm sorry, not Frank.
- You're in my space!

976
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:02,678
He's an octopus.
No, sep-septopus.

977
00:43:02,702 --> 00:43:05,486
He-That's right, he's a septopus.
Septopus. Septopus. Septopus.

978
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:07,981
Huh!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, septopus.

979
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:09,769
He's camouflaged.

980
00:43:12,178 --> 00:43:13,466
Hank.
Come on, Hank.

981
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:14,983
Let's get out of here.

982
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:17,732
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hank!

983
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:20,118
Wh-Wh-What's the plan?

984
00:43:20,143 --> 00:43:22,297
The plan is I'm going to
stay here forever.

985
00:43:22,322 --> 00:43:24,301
Okay.
Good plan.

986
00:43:25,593 --> 00:43:27,319
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Hank.

987
00:43:27,344 --> 00:43:29,905
I'm sorry I can't remember right.
Huh!

988
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,051
- Sweetie. Sweeite. Careful.
- Watch out, cupcake.

989
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,178
Ho ho.
Watch where you are going.

990
00:43:34,203 --> 00:43:38,662
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I'm sorry I can't remember right.

991
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:43,684
Sweetie. Sweeite.
You don't need to be sorry.

992
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:45,737
You know what you need to do?

993
00:43:45,878 --> 00:43:49,026
- Just, keep swimming.
- Yeah.

994
00:43:49,051 --> 00:43:51,582
And I bet you can
remember that because...

995
00:43:51,607 --> 00:43:55,580
We just... We're gonna...
We're gonna sing a song about it.

996
00:43:55,605 --> 00:43:59,558
- Just keep swimming.
- Just keep swimming.

997
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,145
- Swimming.
- Swimming.

998
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,656
- What do we do? We swim.
- What do we do? We swim.

999
00:44:03,681 --> 00:44:05,756
- Swim.
- Swim.

1000
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:09,490
Just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.

1001
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,599
Huh!
My parents taught me that song!

1002
00:44:13,624 --> 00:44:16,641
We sang it as a family.
All this time I thought I made it up.

1003
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:18,542
- What song?
- Just keep swimming.

1004
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,475
Hank.
We... just got to keep swimming.

1005
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,870
What?
No way!

1006
00:44:21,895 --> 00:44:23,917
Listen to me.
It's too dangerous to move.

1007
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:25,854
No, you listen to me.
I know you're scared.

1008
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:28,203
But you can't give up.
Follow me.

1009
00:44:28,228 --> 00:44:30,861
Just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.

1010
00:44:30,886 --> 00:44:31,853
Ahhh!

1011
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,611
My mom wrote this song for me.

1012
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:37,275
It's gonna get us out of here.

1013
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,010
Sing with me, Hank.
Come on.

1014
00:44:39,706 --> 00:44:42,513
I'm coming Mommy.
I'm coming Daddy.

1015
00:44:42,538 --> 00:44:43,627
- Stop.
- Huh?

1016
00:44:43,652 --> 00:44:45,988
- Turn back.
- Turn back.

1017
00:44:46,013 --> 00:44:49,520
- You are heading right for poker's cove.
- You are heading right for poker's cove.

1018
00:44:49,545 --> 00:44:51,960
- Poker's cove.
- Poker's cove.

1019
00:44:51,985 --> 00:44:54,864
- Poker's cove?
- Incoming!

1020
00:44:59,668 --> 00:45:01,155
What is it?

1021
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:06,174
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

1022
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:08,962
Everybody does it.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

1023
00:45:13,365 --> 00:45:14,461
Hank?

1024
00:45:14,486 --> 00:45:16,836
Oh, Hank.
There you are.

1025
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:20,318
Wow.
You got us out of there.

1026
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,910
Huh.
I did.

1027
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:25,330
I got us out of there.

1028
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:28,003
I mean technically,
you also got us in there.

1029
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:32,555
But, if you hadn't, I'm not sure
we would have gotten... here.

1030
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:35,998
Echolocation.

1031
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:37,492
Echolocation.
Huh!

1032
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:40,061
The world's most powerful pair of glasses.
We found it.

1033
00:45:40,086 --> 00:45:43,379
No, no, no.
You found that.

1034
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:51,533
Welcome to the open ocean.

1035
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:53,563
Home.

1036
00:45:54,198 --> 00:45:58,084
OOrroo.
Oorroo Oorroo.

1037
00:45:58,109 --> 00:46:02,134
Oorroo.

1038
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,103
Dad, stop.
She's not coming back.

1039
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,686
She might.
Oorroo.

1040
00:46:05,711 --> 00:46:08,671
Dad. You made her feel
like she couldn't do it.

1041
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:17,767
You're not talking about Becky,
are you?

1042
00:46:19,462 --> 00:46:21,335
I missed Dory.

1043
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:23,195
Me too.

1044
00:46:27,077 --> 00:46:30,281
The truth is I'm just
so worried about her.

1045
00:46:30,306 --> 00:46:32,981
She's the one that should be
worried about us.

1046
00:46:33,006 --> 00:46:36,623
Well, she would definitely have
an idea what to do if she were here.

1047
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:40,084
- I don't know how she does that?
- I don't think she knows, Dad.

1048
00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:42,975
She just... does.

1049
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,776
Then we'll just have to think.

1050
00:46:46,467 --> 00:46:48,971
- What would Dory do?
- What would Dory do?

1051
00:46:48,996 --> 00:46:51,364
Yeah!
What would Dory do?

1052
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:53,290
She would access her situation.

1053
00:46:53,315 --> 00:46:56,078
And she would evaluate.
And she would analyze her options.

1054
00:46:56,103 --> 00:46:58,581
Dad, that's what would Marlin do.

1055
00:46:58,606 --> 00:47:01,591
Right, that's what I would do.
She wouldn't even think twice.

1056
00:47:01,616 --> 00:47:04,578
She would just look at the
first thing she sees and...

1057
00:47:12,111 --> 00:47:13,824
That was awesome.

1058
00:47:16,468 --> 00:47:18,275
Dory would do it.

1059
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:23,039
Nemo, hold on to me.

1060
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:30,703
Hey, it's working!

1061
00:47:35,432 --> 00:47:39,137
Just keep gasping.

1062
00:47:45,035 --> 00:47:46,426
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1063
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:48,882
- What would Dory do now?
- Who's Dory?

1064
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:51,966
Oh boy.
Are we happy to see you.

1065
00:47:51,991 --> 00:47:54,866
Happy to see me?
I'm happy to see you!

1066
00:47:54,891 --> 00:47:57,523
I haven't had anyone
to talk to in years.

1067
00:47:57,548 --> 00:47:59,204
Years, wow.

1068
00:47:59,229 --> 00:48:01,196
Well, unfortunately we can't stay long,
we have to go because we...

1069
00:48:01,221 --> 00:48:03,113
Now why would you want to go?

1070
00:48:03,138 --> 00:48:05,578
You just landed.
Stay a while.

1071
00:48:05,603 --> 00:48:07,329
Tell me all about yourself.

1072
00:48:07,354 --> 00:48:10,122
Well I would love to, but my son
and I have to get to quarantine so...

1073
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:12,343
- Wonderful thing to have a son.
- Ah yeah, it is.

1074
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:13,890
Of course I don't have a family.

1075
00:48:13,922 --> 00:48:16,500
- I dated a nice scallop for a while.
- Well that's fascinating.

1076
00:48:16,532 --> 00:48:19,195
But scallops have eyes, she was
looking for something different.

1077
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,072
I'm kidding, well not about
scallops having eyes, they do.

1078
00:48:22,097 --> 00:48:24,655
And they see into your soul
and they break your heart.

1079
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,136
Oh Shelley.
Why! Why!

1080
00:48:29,161 --> 00:48:31,251
Now what would Dory do?

1081
00:48:31,765 --> 00:48:38,235
Come with us, as we explore the
mysterious world of the open ocean.

1082
00:48:39,261 --> 00:48:40,494
Okay, follow me.

1083
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:43,379
- You're in a cup.
- Right, I'll follow you then.

1084
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:55,958
Wait.

1085
00:48:55,983 --> 00:49:00,686
An octopus has three hearts.
Huh, that's a fun fact.

1086
00:49:11,311 --> 00:49:12,653
We're-We're here.

1087
00:49:12,678 --> 00:49:15,071
- This is-This is really happening.
- Shh.

1088
00:49:24,843 --> 00:49:26,952
Well.
Looks like this is it, kid.

1089
00:49:26,977 --> 00:49:29,840
- Now, I got a truck to catch.
- Wait. Wait.

1090
00:49:29,865 --> 00:49:31,762
I had something for you.

1091
00:49:33,585 --> 00:49:37,230
- Tag.
- The tag, right.

1092
00:49:43,572 --> 00:49:47,537
You know.
I think I'm going to remember you.

1093
00:49:49,574 --> 00:49:52,161
Ah.
You'll forget me in a heartbeat, kid.

1094
00:49:52,186 --> 00:49:53,996
Three heartbeats.

1095
00:49:54,736 --> 00:49:57,209
I'll have a hard time
forgetting you though.

1096
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:04,278
My parents are actually down there.

1097
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:10,923
You okay?

1098
00:50:11,959 --> 00:50:13,495
I'm ready.

1099
00:50:13,707 --> 00:50:15,148
Yeah.

1100
00:50:15,575 --> 00:50:16,964
I think you are.

1101
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:18,340
Whoa oh.

1102
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,936
Wow!

1103
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:30,310
Where are they?

1104
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:32,320
Okay.
Okay.

1105
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,482
Pardon me.
Uh. Oh.

1106
00:50:39,507 --> 00:50:42,401
Hi. Hello. Have you seen
a mom and a dad without me?

1107
00:50:42,426 --> 00:50:44,116
Excuse me.
Have you seen a couple?

1108
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:48,042
They are old like you, not old
like you but older than you even.

1109
00:50:48,067 --> 00:50:49,708
Okay.
Bye.

1110
00:50:49,732 --> 00:50:52,043
Hi. Do you know anyone
who lost a kid?

1111
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:54,687
A long time ago,
that would be me.

1112
00:50:54,712 --> 00:50:57,850
I don't know how long ago exact...
Okay, you're in a hurry.

1113
00:50:57,875 --> 00:50:59,271
Ho ho.
Watch where you are going.

1114
00:50:59,296 --> 00:51:00,475
Sorry.

1115
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:07,121
Huh!

1116
00:51:07,146 --> 00:51:10,878
It's our goal that every animal
we rescued and cared for

1117
00:51:10,903 --> 00:51:14,614
will eventually returned home
to where they belong.

1118
00:51:18,397 --> 00:51:19,646
Shells.

1119
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:21,757
And, there we go.

1120
00:51:21,782 --> 00:51:25,740
- Now, if you ever get lost, Dory.
- You just follow the shells.

1121
00:51:25,765 --> 00:51:28,066
I love shells.

1122
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:29,801
Huh!

1123
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:37,195
Follow the shells.

1124
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:52,393
- Hey, I live here.
- Yes. Yes, indeed.

1125
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:55,678
Huh! My home!
That's my home!

1126
00:51:56,353 --> 00:51:58,462
Mom!
Dad!

1127
00:51:59,663 --> 00:52:03,041
Okay, cupcake.
Now count to 10.

1128
00:52:03,257 --> 00:52:06,626
1, 2, 3.

1129
00:52:06,651 --> 00:52:08,950
- Huh!
- 4.

1130
00:52:08,975 --> 00:52:11,185
Youuu're welcome.

1131
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:15,363
- Who're you talking to, cupcake?
- My pipe-pal, Destiny.

1132
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,355
Mom.
Dad?

1133
00:52:30,943 --> 00:52:34,026
Mommy loves purple shells.
Huh!

1134
00:52:40,879 --> 00:52:42,457
Mommy?

1135
00:52:42,482 --> 00:52:46,463
- What's going to happen to her?
- There, there, Jenny.

1136
00:52:46,488 --> 00:52:49,131
Oh no. Don't cry, Mommy.
Don't cry.

1137
00:52:49,156 --> 00:52:52,658
Do you think she's... that she
can make it on her own, Charlie?

1138
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:56,085
Oh honey.
It will be okay.

1139
00:52:58,244 --> 00:53:01,105
Mommy loves purple shells.

1140
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:11,837
- Dory!
- Dory?

1141
00:53:11,862 --> 00:53:12,874
Dory!

1142
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:14,860
Mommy?
AHHH!!!

1143
00:53:14,885 --> 00:53:15,797
- Dory!
- Dory!

1144
00:53:15,822 --> 00:53:18,592
MOMMY !
DADDY !!!

1145
00:53:21,047 --> 00:53:22,635
My parents.

1146
00:53:23,484 --> 00:53:26,467
I...
I lost them.

1147
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:36,183
It was my fault.

1148
00:53:37,023 --> 00:53:38,991
- Where's your tag?
- Huh?

1149
00:53:39,017 --> 00:53:40,975
Your tag, it's missing.

1150
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,808
Is that why you are
not in quarantine?

1151
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:44,053
- Quarantine?
- Yeah!

1152
00:53:44,078 --> 00:53:46,063
That's where they took
all the blue tangs.

1153
00:53:46,088 --> 00:53:47,716
- Isn't that right, Bill?
- Yep.

1154
00:53:47,741 --> 00:53:50,381
The blue tangs are getting
their own exhibit in Cleveland.

1155
00:53:50,406 --> 00:53:52,608
They'd ship out on a truck
at the crack of dawn.

1156
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:53,922
- Must be nice.
- What?

1157
00:53:53,947 --> 00:53:56,206
No. No.
My parents are back in quarantine?

1158
00:53:56,231 --> 00:53:59,190
They are being shipped to Cleveland.
But I just-I just got here.

1159
00:53:59,215 --> 00:54:00,902
I've got to get to them.
They don't know I'm here.

1160
00:54:00,927 --> 00:54:03,344
Don't worry, it's easy
to get to quarantine.

1161
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:05,874
You can just go through
the pipes, honey.

1162
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:12,402
- Oh, I can't do that.
- Why not?

1163
00:54:12,427 --> 00:54:13,669
I'll forget where I'm going.

1164
00:54:13,694 --> 00:54:17,081
And I can't be somewhere
where I... have nobody to help me.

1165
00:54:17,106 --> 00:54:18,831
Well, then I guess you're stuck here.
Huh.

1166
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,104
You're not helping, Bill.

1167
00:54:20,129 --> 00:54:23,327
Just go in there if you want to.
You'll be fine.

1168
00:54:26,415 --> 00:54:28,039
Oh boy.

1169
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:29,262
Could you uh.

1170
00:54:29,287 --> 00:54:32,320
Could you tell me how to
get there, through the pipes?

1171
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:35,757
Sure, honey.
It's 2 lefts and then a right.

1172
00:54:35,782 --> 00:54:37,174
Simple.

1173
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:41,986
Okay.

1174
00:54:43,908 --> 00:54:46,495
2 lefts and a right.
I can do this.

1175
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,749
2 lefts and a right.
Okay.

1176
00:54:48,774 --> 00:54:50,554
Don't forget.

1177
00:54:55,434 --> 00:54:58,498
2 lefts and a right.

1178
00:54:58,523 --> 00:55:03,245
2 lefts and a right.

1179
00:55:04,704 --> 00:55:07,874
2 lefts,
and-and a right?

1180
00:55:07,899 --> 00:55:11,125
Shoot.
Left and right.

1181
00:55:11,584 --> 00:55:13,480
Wait.
Did I already take a left?

1182
00:55:13,505 --> 00:55:15,699
Oh no, it's happening.

1183
00:55:15,724 --> 00:55:18,011
Okay, hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

1184
00:55:18,036 --> 00:55:19,336
Which way?

1185
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:20,664
Where am I going?

1186
00:55:20,689 --> 00:55:22,658
I can't remember. Okay.
Okay, I'm lost.

1187
00:55:22,683 --> 00:55:25,016
This is too hard, I can't remember.
I'm forgetting everything.

1188
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:27,453
I'm going to be
stuck forever in the pipes.

1189
00:55:27,478 --> 00:55:29,257
The pipes.
The pipe-pals.

1190
00:55:29,282 --> 00:55:31,783
Pipe-pals.
Pipe-pals!

1191
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:35,502
- And... Swim, swim, swim.
- Yeah, I don't know about this.

1192
00:55:35,527 --> 00:55:37,479
Trust me.
I won't let you hit anything.

1193
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:38,606
Wall.

1194
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:41,257
What's the point!
I'll never learn to get around.

1195
00:55:41,282 --> 00:55:42,579
You better.
If you can't do it in here,

1196
00:55:42,604 --> 00:55:43,931
you'll never do it
out in the ocean.

1197
00:55:43,956 --> 00:55:45,834
Now really focus, okay?

1198
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:46,668
Wall!

1199
00:55:46,693 --> 00:55:48,192
Destinyyy.

1200
00:55:48,248 --> 00:55:50,348
Dory?
Hellooo.

1201
00:55:50,373 --> 00:55:54,182
I'm lost in the pipes and
my parents are departing.

1202
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,881
Hang on, Doryyy.

1203
00:55:55,906 --> 00:55:58,034
- Bailey, you got to use your echolocation.
- You know it's broken.

1204
00:55:58,074 --> 00:56:00,887
Just stop it and try the ooo thing
Dory talked about, will you ?!

1205
00:56:00,912 --> 00:56:03,874
- Huh, I don't think I can.
- Don't bail on me, Bailey!

1206
00:56:09,211 --> 00:56:11,307
Come on, Bailey.
What did you just tell me, huh?

1207
00:56:11,332 --> 00:56:12,949
Really.
Focus.

1208
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:14,019
I feel stupid.

1209
00:56:14,044 --> 00:56:15,620
- Bailey.
- Sorry.

1210
00:56:16,037 --> 00:56:18,395
- Hellooo.
- Uh, here.

1211
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,074
We're hereee.

1212
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:22,261
Guys.
Guys.

1213
00:56:22,286 --> 00:56:23,739
What? What?
What is it?

1214
00:56:23,764 --> 00:56:25,371
I'm getting something.

1215
00:56:25,396 --> 00:56:26,558
Here we go.

1216
00:56:26,661 --> 00:56:28,082
Oh yes.

1217
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:31,081
I can see the quarantine!
Ha ha ha!

1218
00:56:31,106 --> 00:56:33,447
This is amazing!

1219
00:56:34,464 --> 00:56:36,851
I can see everything!
And I can see you!

1220
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:38,661
He can see youuu.

1221
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,090
My life's a rainbow!
Can you see me?

1222
00:56:41,115 --> 00:56:42,236
Oh wait.

1223
00:56:42,261 --> 00:56:43,687
- It doesn't work that way.
- Bailey!

1224
00:56:43,712 --> 00:56:45,439
Okay.
Tell Dory to go left.

1225
00:56:45,464 --> 00:56:48,889
- He says go leeeft.
- Leeeft?

1226
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:52,080
- Straight.
- Straiiight.

1227
00:56:52,105 --> 00:56:53,825
Straight.

1228
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:55,227
- Go right.
- Riiight.

1229
00:56:55,252 --> 00:56:56,635
Riiight?

1230
00:56:57,219 --> 00:56:58,661
I'm light headed.

1231
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,293
- Wait.
- What?

1232
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:02,923
I'm picking up something else.
Hold on, let me zoom out.

1233
00:57:03,548 --> 00:57:05,637
Huh!
Holy Neptune.

1234
00:57:05,662 --> 00:57:07,464
- She's not alone.
- What? What is it?

1235
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:09,459
- I can't tell but it's coming for her.
- Oh no!

1236
00:57:09,484 --> 00:57:11,280
Doryyy, swimmm!

1237
00:57:11,305 --> 00:57:13,270
- Swim the other wayyy.
- What? Whereee?

1238
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:14,412
- What? Where?
- Go right!

1239
00:57:14,437 --> 00:57:15,995
Riiight.

1240
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,399
No, my right!

1241
00:57:18,424 --> 00:57:20,038
Oh no.
She's heading right towards it.

1242
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:22,697
No!
Dory, turn around!

1243
00:57:23,643 --> 00:57:26,380
That's great, Dory!
You're heading right towards us.

1244
00:57:26,405 --> 00:57:28,114
What?
You want me to go right?

1245
00:57:28,139 --> 00:57:30,619
No. No. Not right.
Oh, I can't look.

1246
00:57:31,196 --> 00:57:33,957
- AHH!
- AHH!

1247
00:57:33,982 --> 00:57:35,297
- Dory!
- Dory!
- Marlin?

1248
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:37,704
- Oh my gosh!
- Dory, you're okay!

1249
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,472
- It's consuming her.
- Dory.

1250
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:42,645
- It's eating her alive.
- Oh Dory.

1251
00:57:42,669 --> 00:57:43,597
You're okay.

1252
00:57:43,622 --> 00:57:45,075
You found me!
How did you find me?

1253
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,530
There was a crazy clam.
He wouldn't stop talking.

1254
00:57:47,555 --> 00:57:51,078
We just slowly back away from
him and into these pipes.

1255
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,406
And then we just
started looking.

1256
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:55,306
Doryyy, I'm sorryyy.

1257
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:57,345
Okay.
What was that?

1258
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:58,729
Hang on, I got to take this.

1259
00:57:58,754 --> 00:58:01,599
It's oook.
Sorry for whaaat?

1260
00:58:01,624 --> 00:58:03,844
- What? You're okayyy?
- Yes!

1261
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:06,264
I found Marlin and Nemooo.

1262
00:58:06,289 --> 00:58:09,110
Dad, did you hear that?
Dory really does speak whale.

1263
00:58:09,135 --> 00:58:10,165
I heard it.

1264
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,012
And it's bringing back
some very bad memories.

1265
00:58:12,037 --> 00:58:15,442
So let's get out of here.
I say we... we go this way.

1266
00:58:15,467 --> 00:58:17,517
Follow me.
It's time to head home.

1267
00:58:17,542 --> 00:58:20,849
Wait, wait, wait. Um. Um.
My parents are here.

1268
00:58:20,874 --> 00:58:22,736
- They are?
- You found your parents?

1269
00:58:22,761 --> 00:58:24,122
Well, not exactly.

1270
00:58:24,154 --> 00:58:25,721
No.
I mean, not yet.

1271
00:58:25,746 --> 00:58:27,626
But uh, I know where they are.

1272
00:58:27,681 --> 00:58:30,205
And I don't know exactly
how to get there.

1273
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:31,903
But I know that...
Well, I'm getting help.

1274
00:58:31,928 --> 00:58:34,994
- Down to quarantinnne.
- Quarantine, that's it.

1275
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:39,010
Oh, and I met this septopus.
Super cranky but secretly kind of sweet.

1276
00:58:39,035 --> 00:58:41,128
And he got me into the exhibit...

1277
00:58:41,825 --> 00:58:43,552
The exhibit.

1278
00:58:45,296 --> 00:58:46,570
Dory?

1279
00:58:46,949 --> 00:58:49,450
Do you think my parents
will want to see me?

1280
00:58:49,475 --> 00:58:52,229
What?
Why wouldn't they want to see you?

1281
00:58:52,398 --> 00:58:54,007
Because...

1282
00:58:54,757 --> 00:58:56,558
I lost them.

1283
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:58,090
Dory.

1284
00:58:58,115 --> 00:59:01,414
Your parents are going to be
overjoyed to see you.

1285
00:59:01,447 --> 00:59:04,537
They're going to miss
everything about you.

1286
00:59:04,562 --> 00:59:05,892
- Really?
- Dory.

1287
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,631
- Do you know how we found you?
- Something about a clam or...

1288
00:59:08,656 --> 00:59:10,334
- No. No.
- No, an oyster.

1289
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:11,256
- Mollusc.
- No.

1290
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,459
- Something.. I don't know.
- No. No clam.

1291
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:15,264
We were having a very hard time.

1292
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:18,995
Until Nemo thought,
"What would Dory do?"

1293
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:20,811
Why would you say that?

1294
00:59:20,836 --> 00:59:22,273
Because ever since I've met you,

1295
00:59:22,298 --> 00:59:26,451
you showed me how to do
stuff I never dream of doing.

1296
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:28,687
Crazy things.

1297
00:59:28,712 --> 00:59:32,924
Outsmarting sharks and
jumping jellyfish.

1298
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,947
And finding my son.

1299
00:59:36,224 --> 00:59:38,807
You made all that happened.

1300
00:59:39,233 --> 00:59:42,481
Really?
I didn't know you thought that.

1301
00:59:42,918 --> 00:59:44,716
Unless I forgot.

1302
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,822
No, you didn't forget.

1303
00:59:47,254 --> 00:59:49,041
I never told you.

1304
00:59:49,517 --> 00:59:51,957
And I'm sorry about that.

1305
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:56,718
But Dory,
because of who you are

1306
00:59:56,751 --> 01:00:00,266
you are about to find
your parents.

1307
01:00:00,927 --> 01:00:02,884
And when you do that.

1308
01:00:03,988 --> 01:00:05,294
You...

1309
01:00:06,212 --> 01:00:08,057
You'll be home.

1310
01:00:19,581 --> 01:00:20,812
Dad?

1311
01:00:20,837 --> 01:00:24,817
Does this mean we have
to say goodbye to Dory?

1312
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:28,777
Yes, Nemo.
We do.

1313
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,216
Hey! So how much more
we got left to load?

1314
01:00:50,249 --> 01:00:51,606
Uh, just this last row.

1315
01:00:51,631 --> 01:00:54,790
The sooner we finish.
The sooner this truck gets to Cleveland.

1316
01:00:54,815 --> 01:00:56,643
<font color=#ff7979>TL59</font>
- Watch the turn.
- Watch what?

1317
01:00:56,668 --> 01:00:57,914
- Ow!
- Too late.

1318
01:00:57,939 --> 01:01:00,046
Okay, I think we're close.

1319
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:03,386
- Hi !
- Hi !

1320
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:05,550
- Is this quarantine?
- Yes, this is it.

1321
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:07,855
We're in quarantine.
My parents are here!

1322
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,017
- Yay!
- Yay!

1323
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:10,544
Where are we going?
Hey, no no no.

1324
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:12,045
Why are we going
towards the door?

1325
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,631
We are all better!

1326
01:01:13,656 --> 01:01:16,042
- Yay!
- I feel fantastic!

1327
01:01:16,067 --> 01:01:17,328
Ahchoo!

1328
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:18,919
Dude.

1329
01:01:18,947 --> 01:01:19,978
Huh!

1330
01:01:20,647 --> 01:01:22,230
My family.

1331
01:01:22,563 --> 01:01:23,669
Come on, let's go.

1332
01:01:23,694 --> 01:01:25,480
- Excuse me.
- Dory, wait a minute!

1333
01:01:29,081 --> 01:01:30,869
I'm coming, Mommy!

1334
01:01:31,183 --> 01:01:32,770
I'm coming, Daddy!

1335
01:01:32,795 --> 01:01:34,015
Woo-hoo!

1336
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,637
Almost home.

1337
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:38,728
I think I'm getting
the hang of this.

1338
01:01:42,989 --> 01:01:44,856
I heard footsteps.

1339
01:01:46,676 --> 01:01:48,896
- Huh! Hank!
- Quiet.

1340
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:50,570
Hank, we need to
get in that tank.

1341
01:01:50,595 --> 01:01:51,987
- Huh! That rhyme.
- Why?

1342
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:53,858
Her parents are there.

1343
01:01:53,883 --> 01:01:55,855
Oh.
Look.

1344
01:01:56,538 --> 01:01:58,717
You got 3 minutes to get
everyone in this cup with you.

1345
01:01:58,742 --> 01:02:00,258
And then I'm on
that truck to Cleveland.

1346
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:02,142
- Got it?
- Got it.

1347
01:02:06,581 --> 01:02:08,201
Oh boy.

1348
01:02:11,919 --> 01:02:15,988
Mom?
Dad?

1349
01:02:16,197 --> 01:02:18,873
Hey, everybody.
It's me, Dory.

1350
01:02:18,966 --> 01:02:22,237
Dory?

1351
01:02:22,262 --> 01:02:26,758
Mom?
Dad?

1352
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:29,934
Mom?
Dad?

1353
01:02:30,298 --> 01:02:32,236
She should just pick two
and let's go.

1354
01:02:32,261 --> 01:02:33,324
- Dad.
- What?

1355
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:35,196
I'm kidding.
It's a reunion.

1356
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:37,506
Mom?
Dad?

1357
01:02:38,049 --> 01:02:39,966
Where are my parents?

1358
01:02:40,428 --> 01:02:41,437
Dory?

1359
01:02:41,462 --> 01:02:43,841
Are you really Jenny
and Charlie's girl?

1360
01:02:43,874 --> 01:02:45,474
Yes, I am.
That's me.

1361
01:02:45,499 --> 01:02:46,810
Where are they?

1362
01:02:46,835 --> 01:02:48,013
Well, Dory.

1363
01:02:48,038 --> 01:02:50,417
Right after you disappeared.
They thought you...

1364
01:02:50,442 --> 01:02:53,338
Well, they thought you must have
ended up here, in quarantine.

1365
01:02:53,363 --> 01:02:54,504
Uh-huh.

1366
01:02:54,529 --> 01:02:56,291
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

1367
01:02:56,316 --> 01:02:59,189
And.
So they came here.

1368
01:02:59,214 --> 01:03:01,116
- To look for you?
- They're here!

1369
01:03:01,141 --> 01:03:02,549
Where are they?

1370
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:09,015
- Dory, that was years ago.
- Huh?

1371
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,886
They never came back.

1372
01:03:10,911 --> 01:03:12,065
Oh no.

1373
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,795
You see, Dory.

1374
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:17,847
When fish don't come back
from quarantine, it means.

1375
01:03:17,872 --> 01:03:20,789
- They're not...
- What?

1376
01:03:20,814 --> 01:03:23,280
Dory, they're gone.

1377
01:03:23,305 --> 01:03:26,178
Huh!
They're.... dead?

1378
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,882
- They wanted to find you.
- Wait, are you sure?

1379
01:03:28,907 --> 01:03:30,654
Are you sure they're gone?

1380
01:03:30,754 --> 01:03:32,925
Dory, listen.
It's going to be okay.

1381
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:34,937
Oh Dory,
they loved you so much.

1382
01:03:34,962 --> 01:03:38,462
Anyone not looking to go
to Cleveland, final warning.

1383
01:03:40,406 --> 01:03:43,116
- Dory, are you alright?
- Are you okay?

1384
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:45,541
- I was too late.
- Dory, no.

1385
01:03:45,566 --> 01:03:47,677
- Now listen.
- I don't have a family.

1386
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:51,125
No, Dory.
That's not true.

1387
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:53,282
Time to go!

1388
01:03:53,307 --> 01:03:55,246
I'm-I'm all alone.

1389
01:03:55,271 --> 01:03:57,382
- Dory.
- Dory!

1390
01:03:59,123 --> 01:04:00,943
Where's everybody else?

1391
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,159
Your orange friends are
on their way to Cleveland.

1392
01:04:03,184 --> 01:04:05,304
Gotcha.
I found the octopus.

1393
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:06,369
Aw!

1394
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,951
Where did he go?

1395
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:11,487
Huh!

1396
01:04:17,294 --> 01:04:19,953
Mommy?
Daddy?

1397
01:04:28,596 --> 01:04:31,704
No. No.
No.

1398
01:04:31,863 --> 01:04:33,644
Help.
Help me.

1399
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:36,886
Help.
Help me, please.

1400
01:04:36,983 --> 01:04:39,136
Somebody help me!

1401
01:04:39,587 --> 01:04:40,610
Hey, can...

1402
01:04:40,635 --> 01:04:41,716
Help me.
Can you help me.

1403
01:04:41,741 --> 01:04:42,893
- I've lost them.
- Oh.

1404
01:04:42,918 --> 01:04:44,131
- I...
- Lost who?

1405
01:04:44,156 --> 01:04:46,245
I...
I...

1406
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:47,328
Sorry, honey.

1407
01:04:47,353 --> 01:04:49,751
I can't help you if
you don't remember.

1408
01:04:50,635 --> 01:04:51,836
Huh!

1409
01:04:52,228 --> 01:04:53,887
Oh.
Hey, can you help me?

1410
01:04:53,912 --> 01:04:56,943
- I've lost... them.
- Uh, can you be more specific?

1411
01:04:56,968 --> 01:05:00,075
My. My them.
Them. Them.

1412
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:07,110
Help.

1413
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:08,921
Help.

1414
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:13,057
Please.
They're gone!

1415
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:29,715
Lost.
I've lost everyone.

1416
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,970
There's nothing I can do.

1417
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:36,961
Shoot, I can't forget.
What was I forgetting?

1418
01:05:37,302 --> 01:05:38,603
Something.

1419
01:05:39,154 --> 01:05:40,801
Something important.
Wh...

1420
01:05:40,826 --> 01:05:42,468
What was it?
I...

1421
01:05:43,668 --> 01:05:44,962
What was it?

1422
01:05:45,699 --> 01:05:47,409
It's going away.

1423
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:48,560
It's going away.

1424
01:05:48,585 --> 01:05:50,839
It's going because
all I can do is forget.

1425
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,109
I just forget
and I forget.

1426
01:05:53,134 --> 01:05:56,959
It's what I do best.
It's what I do.

1427
01:05:57,596 --> 01:06:02,641
What do I do?
What do I do?

1428
01:06:04,153 --> 01:06:06,202
What would Dory do?

1429
01:06:08,253 --> 01:06:10,636
I would look around.

1430
01:06:10,919 --> 01:06:14,378
And um,
it's just water over there.

1431
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:17,035
And a lot of kelp over here.

1432
01:06:17,276 --> 01:06:19,885
Kelp is better, okay.

1433
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:30,094
Now what?
Lots of kelp, looks the same.

1434
01:06:30,515 --> 01:06:33,931
They all look the same
except there's a rock.

1435
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:38,603
Over there,
and some sand... this way.

1436
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:41,355
I like sand.
Sand is squishy.

1437
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:58,539
This isn't going anywhere.

1438
01:07:00,151 --> 01:07:02,019
There's nothing here.

1439
01:07:02,504 --> 01:07:04,217
Nothing but kelp.

1440
01:07:04,242 --> 01:07:07,359
Lots of kelp and
some shells.

1441
01:07:07,874 --> 01:07:10,280
This... way.

1442
01:07:10,758 --> 01:07:12,636
I like shells.

1443
01:07:15,562 --> 01:07:19,620
I like... shells.

1444
01:07:45,246 --> 01:07:46,578
Whoa!

1445
01:08:24,032 --> 01:08:25,998
Hello.
I'm...

1446
01:08:26,023 --> 01:08:27,622
- Dory!
- Dory!

1447
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:29,064
Look at you.

1448
01:08:29,089 --> 01:08:30,882
- Oh, my baby.
- I believe you.

1449
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:32,230
- I mean, look at you.
- You found us.

1450
01:08:32,255 --> 01:08:34,803
- I'm never letting you go again.
- My missing girl, you are here.

1451
01:08:34,828 --> 01:08:36,440
- It's you.
- Yes.

1452
01:08:36,465 --> 01:08:37,888
- Really you.
- Oh, absolutely.

1453
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:39,375
Mom, you're actually here.
You're...

1454
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,663
I am.

1455
01:08:40,688 --> 01:08:44,236
- And Dad, so are you.
- I'm right here, cupcake.

1456
01:08:47,615 --> 01:08:48,983
I'm so sorry.

1457
01:08:49,008 --> 01:08:50,050
- Oh, honey.
- What?

1458
01:08:50,075 --> 01:08:52,438
Oh, honey.
No, no, no, cupcake.

1459
01:08:52,463 --> 01:08:54,854
I know I've got a problem.
I know I'm...

1460
01:08:54,879 --> 01:08:57,553
And I'm so sorry that all this
time and I want to fix it.

1461
01:08:57,577 --> 01:08:59,880
- And I can't. And I try I try.
- Oh, Dory.

1462
01:08:59,912 --> 01:09:03,348
But my thoughts, they leave my head.
And ideas changed and...

1463
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:04,841
I've forgotten you
and I'm so sorry.

1464
01:09:04,866 --> 01:09:08,559
Dory, Dory, Dory.
Don't you dare be sorry.

1465
01:09:08,584 --> 01:09:11,431
Look.
Look what you did.

1466
01:09:11,645 --> 01:09:12,724
What?

1467
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:16,826
- You found us!
- That's right, you found us.

1468
01:09:17,347 --> 01:09:18,391
Honey.
Honey.

1469
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:21,411
Why do you think we
stay put here all these years?

1470
01:09:21,436 --> 01:09:24,029
Because we believe one day

1471
01:09:24,054 --> 01:09:27,173
- you'd find us again.
- Exactly!

1472
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:28,381
But.

1473
01:09:28,406 --> 01:09:30,096
I thought you were gone.
How did you?

1474
01:09:30,121 --> 01:09:31,832
We went into quarantine
to look for you.

1475
01:09:31,857 --> 01:09:33,344
But you weren't there.

1476
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:36,397
And we knew you must have
gotten out through the pipes.

1477
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,892
Through the pipes.
That's right, sweetie.

1478
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:39,234
- So.
- So, we did too.

1479
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:42,905
And we stayed, in this spot
for you ever since.

1480
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:45,929
Because-Because we thought
you might come back.

1481
01:09:45,954 --> 01:09:49,427
So everyday, we go out
and lay out...

1482
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:50,970
Shells.

1483
01:09:55,981 --> 01:09:58,731
And you found us.

1484
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:00,246
Oh honey.

1485
01:10:00,272 --> 01:10:02,102
You found us.
And you know why you found us

1486
01:10:02,127 --> 01:10:04,200
because you remembered.

1487
01:10:05,126 --> 01:10:11,097
You remembered in your own
amazing Dory way.

1488
01:10:12,484 --> 01:10:14,122
I did.

1489
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:17,659
- All by myself.
- Oh honey, really?

1490
01:10:17,684 --> 01:10:21,132
Have you been by yourself
all these years?

1491
01:10:21,157 --> 01:10:23,190
Oh my poor little girl.

1492
01:10:23,215 --> 01:10:25,040
Oh, I haven't been all by myself.

1493
01:10:25,065 --> 01:10:27,360
Huh!
Marlin and Nemo!

1494
01:10:27,794 --> 01:10:29,364
Nobody saw where Dory went?

1495
01:10:29,389 --> 01:10:30,100
- No.
- No.

1496
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:33,413
Seriously?
That's a lot of eyeballs doing nothing.

1497
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,111
Oh oh oh. Excuse me.
Can you help us.

1498
01:10:35,136 --> 01:10:36,539
- We're look...
- Me? Help you?

1499
01:10:36,564 --> 01:10:37,851
Ahchoo!

1500
01:10:39,994 --> 01:10:42,160
Huh! Dad, look!
It's Dory!

1501
01:10:42,185 --> 01:10:43,622
Oh, thank goodness.

1502
01:10:43,647 --> 01:10:46,587
See, Nemo.
I knew she'd find a way... What?

1503
01:10:46,612 --> 01:10:48,626
Hey, where's Dory?
Is she with you?

1504
01:10:48,651 --> 01:10:50,541
Huh!
I'm sorry.

1505
01:10:50,566 --> 01:10:52,730
I tried to hold on
but I couldn't and...

1506
01:10:52,755 --> 01:10:54,125
- I lost her.
- What?

1507
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:55,621
Alright.
Let's get going.

1508
01:10:55,646 --> 01:10:57,070
NOOOO!

1509
01:10:57,095 --> 01:10:59,548
And then, the whale swallowed us,
even though I speak whale.

1510
01:10:59,573 --> 01:11:01,492
- A whale?
- Good thing I wasn't there to see that.

1511
01:11:01,517 --> 01:11:03,858
Actually, Marlin never believes that
I even know how to speak whale.

1512
01:11:03,883 --> 01:11:05,803
But, you know what?
He always kind of trust me anyway.

1513
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:07,403
You know.
I like this Marlin already.

1514
01:11:07,428 --> 01:11:09,435
Yeah, and then somehow
we found Nemo.

1515
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:10,946
Or did he find me?
I don't know.

1516
01:11:10,971 --> 01:11:12,944
But, you now what?
Nemo is the sweetest.

1517
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:14,725
He just never gives up
on me no matter what.

1518
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:15,971
Um.
What would Dory do?

1519
01:11:15,996 --> 01:11:18,590
- Okay. We'll go this way.
- Well. We'll certainly have to thank...

1520
01:11:20,428 --> 01:11:22,793
Wait.
Wait, I know this place.

1521
01:11:22,818 --> 01:11:24,317
- Hello.
- Huh!

1522
01:11:24,342 --> 01:11:26,793
- I'm Sigourney Weaver.
- There!

1523
01:11:26,818 --> 01:11:29,832
- Won't you please join us.
- That's the Marine Life Institute.

1524
01:11:29,857 --> 01:11:33,032
- Oh, you were born there.
- Dory, is that where your friends are?

1525
01:11:33,057 --> 01:11:35,364
Yes, they were stuck in...
in something.

1526
01:11:35,389 --> 01:11:37,859
They were-They were going...
somewhere.

1527
01:11:37,884 --> 01:11:40,089
Huh, a truck.
They're in the truck.

1528
01:11:40,113 --> 01:11:42,339
That means I can... huh!
Never see them again.

1529
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:43,510
No.
No no no.

1530
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,682
What would Dory do?
What would Dory do?

1531
01:11:45,706 --> 01:11:49,352
I know they are good friends of yours.
But a truck is kind of a tall order.

1532
01:11:49,378 --> 01:11:50,888
- Yeah. You mother's right, Dory.
- Please! Please!

1533
01:11:50,913 --> 01:11:53,523
All I know is that I... missed them.
I... I...

1534
01:11:53,548 --> 01:11:55,983
I really-I really missed them.

1535
01:11:56,767 --> 01:11:58,616
I've said that before.

1536
01:11:59,353 --> 01:12:01,664
Um.
Dory.

1537
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:02,743
Mom.

1538
01:12:02,768 --> 01:12:04,457
Marlin and Nemo are
more than good friends.

1539
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:06,421
They're...
They're family.

1540
01:12:06,446 --> 01:12:08,183
And I have to
get them back.

1541
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:10,454
See. When they found me,
it felt like fate.

1542
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:11,897
Do you know what I mean?
Or...

1543
01:12:11,922 --> 01:12:14,548
What's another word for fate.
Like.

1544
01:12:14,573 --> 01:12:16,705
Destiny.
Destiny!

1545
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:18,739
Destinyyy!

1546
01:12:18,764 --> 01:12:20,837
- Dory?
- Destinyyy.

1547
01:12:20,862 --> 01:12:22,672
- Morning, Destiny.
- Shh shh shh, shush.

1548
01:12:22,697 --> 01:12:24,847
It's Dory.
Something's wrong.

1549
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,546
I got her!
She's right outside the institute.

1550
01:12:30,515 --> 01:12:31,359
Destiny!

1551
01:12:31,384 --> 01:12:32,553
- We got to jump.
- Jump?

1552
01:12:32,578 --> 01:12:33,836
No time to argue!

1553
01:12:33,861 --> 01:12:36,410
- Destinyyy.
- Dory. Dory.

1554
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,437
The truck thing with
your friends is leaving.

1555
01:12:38,462 --> 01:12:40,151
- Oh no! That's bad.
- No no no no.

1556
01:12:40,176 --> 01:12:43,520
- What do we do?
- Destinyyy!

1557
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,296
- Alright.
- Yeah.

1558
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:47,384
- Here we go.
- Yes.

1559
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:48,407
- One.
- Yes.

1560
01:12:48,432 --> 01:12:49,501
- Two.
- I CAN'T !

1561
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:51,080
I can't do it!
I'll never make it out there!

1562
01:12:51,105 --> 01:12:52,164
- Destiny!
- Huh?

1563
01:12:52,189 --> 01:12:54,660
I got the world's most
powerful pair of glasses.

1564
01:12:54,685 --> 01:12:56,568
You got the world's most
powerful pair of glasses.

1565
01:12:56,593 --> 01:12:59,059
- I will be your eyes.
- You're going to be my eyes.

1566
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:03,307
- But-But the walls!
- There are no walls in the ocean.

1567
01:13:03,332 --> 01:13:04,618
No walls?

1568
01:13:04,643 --> 01:13:06,644
It's your destiny, Destiny.

1569
01:13:06,668 --> 01:13:09,541
- Well, why didn't you say so!
- What? No, Destiny.

1570
01:13:09,566 --> 01:13:11,410
Wait.
NO, that's a wall!

1571
01:13:11,435 --> 01:13:12,687
WALL !

1572
01:13:17,038 --> 01:13:18,078
Mom, Dad.

1573
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:20,003
This is my pipe-pal, Destiny.
Say hi.

1574
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:22,446
Dory.
Are these little blue blobs your parents?

1575
01:13:22,471 --> 01:13:24,380
They look just like you.

1576
01:13:24,405 --> 01:13:26,740
Hello, I'm Bailey.
Mrs. Dory, Mr. Dory.

1577
01:13:26,765 --> 01:13:28,318
- Oh please, call me Jenny.
- Oh, I'm-I'm Charlie.

1578
01:13:28,343 --> 01:13:30,861
Okay, okay, we got to go.
We got to stop that truck.

1579
01:13:30,886 --> 01:13:32,498
Okay.
What truck?

1580
01:13:33,561 --> 01:13:36,120
Huh!
Bailey, status report.

1581
01:13:36,144 --> 01:13:38,365
Oh yes!
My beautiful gift!

1582
01:13:39,634 --> 01:13:40,681
Found it!

1583
01:13:40,706 --> 01:13:43,184
The truck's merging onto the
freeway, it's heading south.

1584
01:13:43,209 --> 01:13:46,522
Let's go.
We are stopping that truck.

1585
01:13:47,206 --> 01:13:50,641
- This, I got to see.
- Yeah, yeah, me too.

1586
01:13:50,665 --> 01:13:52,454
Oh boy, this is going to be good.

1587
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:54,345
Huh! What the?
Gerald?!

1588
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:57,420
- Have you lost your marbles?
- Don't get used to it, Gerald!

1589
01:13:57,445 --> 01:13:59,551
Cheeky Joe, that one.

1590
01:14:01,422 --> 01:14:03,405
Bailey, I forgot everything,
catch me up.

1591
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:04,682
Yes, ma'am.

1592
01:14:04,953 --> 01:14:06,820
Your friends are still
on the truck.

1593
01:14:06,846 --> 01:14:08,851
They're heading north
towards the bridge.

1594
01:14:08,876 --> 01:14:09,692
Oh look.

1595
01:14:09,717 --> 01:14:11,783
There's a bunch of
cute otters over there.

1596
01:14:11,808 --> 01:14:12,882
I want one.

1597
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:14,401
- Ow!
- Ahh!

1598
01:14:16,663 --> 01:14:17,741
Ow!
Bailey!

1599
01:14:17,766 --> 01:14:18,597
Oh oh oh.

1600
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:20,479
I see the truck!
It's over there!

1601
01:14:20,504 --> 01:14:21,981
I don't see how
we can get on it, Dory.

1602
01:14:22,006 --> 01:14:24,235
Oh man, if only there was
a way to stop traffic.

1603
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:25,871
Stop traffic.
Stop traffic.

1604
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:27,745
Everyone needs to stop.
People stop to look at things.

1605
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:29,452
Things that they like.
Things that are cute.

1606
01:14:29,477 --> 01:14:31,169
Huh!
Things that are cute!

1607
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,562
- Okay, I got it.
- What? What is it?

1608
01:14:33,587 --> 01:14:35,921
Quickly before I forget.
Destiny, when the truck reaches the bridge,

1609
01:14:35,946 --> 01:14:38,235
- you flip me up there.
- Got it.

1610
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,842
You guys.
Follow me.

1611
01:14:39,867 --> 01:14:42,258
- Everyone else, stay here.
- Whoa. Whoa.

1612
01:14:42,283 --> 01:14:44,510
Dory, honey.
You're not leaving us again.

1613
01:14:44,535 --> 01:14:46,411
Your mother is right.
You have to stay with us.

1614
01:14:46,436 --> 01:14:48,171
Dory, sweetie.
What happens if...

1615
01:14:48,196 --> 01:14:49,701
- You know, if you're gone for...
- Mom.

1616
01:14:49,726 --> 01:14:50,813
- I don't know, too long and...
- Mom.

1617
01:14:50,838 --> 01:14:52,038
- What if you get confused.
- Mom.

1618
01:14:52,063 --> 01:14:53,636
And that makes you distracted.
And what if...

1619
01:14:53,661 --> 01:14:55,291
I lose you again?

1620
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:58,028
Yes.

1621
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:01,330
Mom, Dad.
It's going to be okay.

1622
01:15:01,355 --> 01:15:04,133
Because,
I know that even if I forget.

1623
01:15:04,482 --> 01:15:06,476
I can find you again.

1624
01:15:10,743 --> 01:15:12,274
Okay, a little left.

1625
01:15:12,604 --> 01:15:13,914
Back the other way a bit.

1626
01:15:13,939 --> 01:15:14,974
Okay, that's it.

1627
01:15:14,999 --> 01:15:16,269
- Yo. Don't do it.
- Bailey!

1628
01:15:16,294 --> 01:15:18,060
Okay. Now, now!
Do it! Do it!

1629
01:15:18,085 --> 01:15:20,758
- Time for your idea.
- Okay. What idea?

1630
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:29,259
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

1631
01:15:29,284 --> 01:15:31,188
What do I do? What do I do?
What would Dory do?

1632
01:15:31,213 --> 01:15:32,558
Come on, cars.
Cars, I see cars.

1633
01:15:32,582 --> 01:15:33,892
Otters in front of cars.

1634
01:15:33,918 --> 01:15:35,497
Car have to stop.
Stop traffic!

1635
01:15:35,522 --> 01:15:37,332
Cuddle party!

1636
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:40,644
Look out!

1637
01:15:42,385 --> 01:15:44,277
- They're so cute!
- Aww.

1638
01:15:44,302 --> 01:15:47,939
Look at them.
There must be, 1, 2, 3...

1639
01:15:50,498 --> 01:15:51,769
What's going on, Dad?

1640
01:15:51,794 --> 01:15:54,266
I don't know how.
I don't know in what way.

1641
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:56,406
But I think this has
something to do with...

1642
01:15:58,569 --> 01:15:59,815
- Dory!
- Dory!

1643
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,390
Water. Water.
I need water.

1644
01:16:02,415 --> 01:16:04,682
Are you crazy?
How do you get here?

1645
01:16:05,044 --> 01:16:06,743
- Dory!
- Dory!

1646
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:08,988
I thought we'd
never see you again.

1647
01:16:09,013 --> 01:16:10,344
Ah, me too.
But darn it.

1648
01:16:10,369 --> 01:16:13,487
No matter how hard I tried,
I just couldn't forget you.

1649
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,887
Guess I miss the rest of
my family too much, huh.

1650
01:16:16,912 --> 01:16:19,104
- We're family?
- Mm-hm.

1651
01:16:19,528 --> 01:16:21,456
Do you know what
that feels like?

1652
01:16:22,081 --> 01:16:25,264
Yes.
I know what that feels like.

1653
01:16:25,588 --> 01:16:27,002
- Aw!
- Aw!

1654
01:16:27,027 --> 01:16:28,554
Hey!
Hey, come on.

1655
01:16:28,579 --> 01:16:30,748
Out of the truck.
Those aren't your fish. Shoo.

1656
01:16:30,773 --> 01:16:32,085
Oh no.
There goes our ride.

1657
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:33,706
Back in the water, come on.

1658
01:16:33,731 --> 01:16:36,919
Doryyy, the traffic is starting to mooove.

1659
01:16:36,944 --> 01:16:38,681
Leave it to me.
I got this.

1660
01:16:40,908 --> 01:16:42,781
Becky.
Becky, come back!

1661
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:45,743
We need your help, Becky!
Wahh!

1662
01:16:46,616 --> 01:16:48,261
Dory, follow me.

1663
01:16:48,943 --> 01:16:50,980
No, no, wait.
We don't have Dory!

1664
01:16:51,005 --> 01:16:52,232
No, no, Becky.
Wait. Stop.

1665
01:16:52,257 --> 01:16:53,741
We need to go back.
Becky.

1666
01:16:53,766 --> 01:16:55,782
Back, back, Becky.

1667
01:16:57,395 --> 01:16:58,773
Ahh!
Please don't eat us!

1668
01:16:58,798 --> 01:17:00,846
- Where's Dory?
- Who are you?

1669
01:17:00,871 --> 01:17:02,148
- Jenny?
- Marlin?

1670
01:17:02,173 --> 01:17:03,967
- Charlie?
- Nemo?

1671
01:17:04,243 --> 01:17:06,863
- Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
- Thank you for taking care of our Dory.

1672
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:08,971
Dory!
She's still in the truck!

1673
01:17:08,996 --> 01:17:11,400
Becky!
Back to Dory!

1674
01:17:11,425 --> 01:17:13,417
Oorroo Dory!

1675
01:17:16,172 --> 01:17:18,467
Okay, kid.
I guess this is goodbye.

1676
01:17:18,492 --> 01:17:19,557
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

1677
01:17:19,582 --> 01:17:20,903
I mean, you're not
going to the Cleveland.

1678
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:22,220
You are coming to
the ocean with me.

1679
01:17:22,245 --> 01:17:24,008
What is it with you
and ruining my plans.

1680
01:17:24,033 --> 01:17:26,058
Listen to me.
I have one goal in life.

1681
01:17:26,083 --> 01:17:28,187
- One. And it is to...
- No, you listen to me.

1682
01:17:28,386 --> 01:17:31,007
What is so great about plans?
I never had a plan.

1683
01:17:31,032 --> 01:17:32,698
Did I plan to lose my parents?
No.

1684
01:17:32,723 --> 01:17:34,617
Did I plan to find Marlin?
No.

1685
01:17:34,642 --> 01:17:36,750
Did you and I plan to meet?

1686
01:17:36,775 --> 01:17:38,426
- Wait, did we?
- Are you almost done?

1687
01:17:38,451 --> 01:17:39,706
Well, I don't think we did.

1688
01:17:39,731 --> 01:17:41,614
And that's because the best things
happened by chance.

1689
01:17:41,639 --> 01:17:42,815
Because that's life.

1690
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,377
And that's you being with me,
out in the ocean.

1691
01:17:45,402 --> 01:17:47,393
Not safe in some
stupid glass box.

1692
01:17:47,418 --> 01:17:48,842
- Can I say something?
- I'm not done!

1693
01:17:48,867 --> 01:17:50,705
A friend of mine,
her name's Sigourney,

1694
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:53,550
once told me that all
it takes is 3 simple steps.

1695
01:17:53,575 --> 01:17:57,491
Rescue, rehabilitation and
one other thing, that is...

1696
01:17:57,516 --> 01:17:58,625
- Release!
- Release!

1697
01:17:58,650 --> 01:17:59,435
- Yay!
- Yay!

1698
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,795
That's right.
So, what do you say?

1699
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:05,797
- Release!
- Release!

1700
01:18:05,822 --> 01:18:08,514
- Release!
- Release!

1701
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,397
I was going to say, okay.

1702
01:18:14,844 --> 01:18:16,211
Not good.

1703
01:18:16,327 --> 01:18:17,561
- Oh, no, no.
- Where are they going?

1704
01:18:17,586 --> 01:18:18,743
- Charlie, they are going away.
- What do we do?

1705
01:18:18,768 --> 01:18:20,713
Quick, guys, grab my fin.

1706
01:18:22,814 --> 01:18:24,519
He's trying to get
the door open

1707
01:18:24,544 --> 01:18:25,752
It's locked from the outside!

1708
01:18:25,777 --> 01:18:27,180
Come on, Dory.
You can do it!

1709
01:18:27,205 --> 01:18:28,610
Destiny.
Destiny!

1710
01:18:28,635 --> 01:18:30,425
- Wall! Wall! Wall!
- Whoa!

1711
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:30,951
- Oh no.
- Oh no.

1712
01:18:30,976 --> 01:18:32,123
Dory!
No, wait!

1713
01:18:32,148 --> 01:18:34,054
- Dory!
- Dory!

1714
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:35,883
Bailey, where are they heading?

1715
01:18:36,669 --> 01:18:38,484
I'm losing them!

1716
01:18:42,114 --> 01:18:44,282
Dory.
It's over.

1717
01:18:44,307 --> 01:18:46,346
No. There's-There's...
There's got to be away.

1718
01:18:46,371 --> 01:18:47,491
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1719
01:18:47,516 --> 01:18:50,315
Dory, now listen to me.
There's no way to get out.

1720
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:53,405
But, there's got to be a way.
There's always a way.

1721
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:54,988
There isn't, Dory.
I'm telling you,

1722
01:18:55,013 --> 01:18:56,987
this time there's
no other way!

1723
01:18:57,012 --> 01:18:58,832
Well, what about that?

1724
01:19:00,186 --> 01:19:02,711
Holy carp.
There is another way.

1725
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,863
Take a deep breath, kid.

1726
01:19:04,889 --> 01:19:06,512
- Release!
- Release!

1727
01:19:06,537 --> 01:19:08,538
Ahchoo!
Excuse me.

1728
01:19:08,563 --> 01:19:10,804
- Release!
- Release!

1729
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:19,472
- What is that?
- I don't care! Just get it off!

1730
01:19:19,497 --> 01:19:21,203
- What?
- What the?

1731
01:19:21,642 --> 01:19:23,651
Suck it, bipeds.

1732
01:19:23,931 --> 01:19:25,880
Alright, Hank.
You got 7 arms.

1733
01:19:25,905 --> 01:19:27,387
I don't know.
Just try something.

1734
01:19:27,412 --> 01:19:29,118
Okay.
Here we go!

1735
01:19:29,605 --> 01:19:30,502
Huh?

1736
01:19:30,527 --> 01:19:32,585
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Stop!

1737
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:34,080
What?
Oh.

1738
01:19:34,105 --> 01:19:36,112
- That's doing something.
- And we are moving.

1739
01:19:36,137 --> 01:19:37,432
- Good job, Hank.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

1740
01:19:37,457 --> 01:19:39,002
- Hey!
- Come on!

1741
01:19:39,027 --> 01:19:41,764
Wait.
Wait.

1742
01:19:41,789 --> 01:19:43,996
Listen, I'm not trying
to tell you how to drive,

1743
01:19:44,021 --> 01:19:46,165
certainly I can't...
I'm not in any position.

1744
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:48,342
But could you...
could you go faster?

1745
01:19:49,163 --> 01:19:50,491
Hey, slow...

1746
01:19:52,635 --> 01:19:54,832
Hey!
Give us our truck back!

1747
01:19:54,888 --> 01:19:56,996
I can't see squat!
Which way are we going?

1748
01:19:57,021 --> 01:19:58,114
Okay.
Well...

1749
01:19:58,139 --> 01:20:01,216
All the cars are going left.
So-So, go left.

1750
01:20:01,241 --> 01:20:04,169
Gilman Street.
Ashby Avenue.

1751
01:20:04,194 --> 01:20:07,078
Oh, Gilman street... again.
Huh, Gilman street again.

1752
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:09,607
How much longer are
we going to veer left?

1753
01:20:11,862 --> 01:20:12,886
It's okay.

1754
01:20:12,911 --> 01:20:14,429
We just need to
know how we got on.

1755
01:20:14,454 --> 01:20:15,804
And then we'll know
how to get off.

1756
01:20:15,829 --> 01:20:17,547
Well, let me know
when you figured it out.

1757
01:20:17,572 --> 01:20:19,336
Unfortunately I can't remember
how we got on.

1758
01:20:19,361 --> 01:20:20,810
Huh!
Hey, I know those guys.

1759
01:20:20,835 --> 01:20:22,225
That's where we came from.
Turn right.

1760
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,394
Here we go!

1761
01:20:28,068 --> 01:20:30,707
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Wahh!

1762
01:20:30,802 --> 01:20:31,831
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1763
01:20:31,856 --> 01:20:33,282
HEY!

1764
01:20:33,307 --> 01:20:35,289
We are so fired.

1765
01:20:35,314 --> 01:20:38,138
Keep straight, straight.
Left. Left.

1766
01:20:38,163 --> 01:20:40,784
No, no, no, no.
Right. Right. Right.

1767
01:20:40,816 --> 01:20:42,922
- Good driving, Hank.
- Pay attention to the road.

1768
01:20:42,947 --> 01:20:45,338
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh oh. Fork in the road.

1769
01:20:45,363 --> 01:20:46,387
- Which way?
- Uh.

1770
01:20:46,412 --> 01:20:47,785
Ocean. Ocean.
Hey, a boat!

1771
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,643
You know, I have had great
experiences with boats but...

1772
01:20:49,668 --> 01:20:51,082
- Which way!
- Uh.

1773
01:20:51,107 --> 01:20:52,431
Huh!
Boats go to the ocean!

1774
01:20:52,456 --> 01:20:54,362
- Right.
- Hold on!

1775
01:20:57,075 --> 01:20:59,303
We're out of time, kid.
Where do we go now?

1776
01:20:59,328 --> 01:21:01,214
Um. Well, um.
Okay, I'll figure it out.

1777
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:02,745
I don't-I don't know.
But, well.

1778
01:21:02,777 --> 01:21:05,230
Something will come and...
Huh!

1779
01:21:05,255 --> 01:21:07,964
Seagulls!
Hank, follow those birds.

1780
01:21:07,989 --> 01:21:09,984
The ocean is left, Hank.

1781
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:14,558
Hold on.

1782
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:15,730
I'm getting something.

1783
01:21:15,755 --> 01:21:17,778
Is it them?
Is everything perfect?

1784
01:21:17,896 --> 01:21:21,367
Oh oh, it's the fuzz.
Busted.

1785
01:21:24,165 --> 01:21:26,524
Okay, we're good.
Huh, the ocean.

1786
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:29,805
- It's straight ahead, floor it.
- Now we're talking.

1787
01:21:31,223 --> 01:21:33,170
- Oh. Oh oh.
- What do you mean, oh oh?

1788
01:21:33,195 --> 01:21:34,354
Oh no.
What would I do?

1789
01:21:34,379 --> 01:21:36,955
What would I do? What would I do?
What would I do?

1790
01:21:37,352 --> 01:21:39,645
Hank, I'm gonna ask you
to do something crazy.

1791
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:41,742
I'm okay with crazy.

1792
01:21:42,164 --> 01:21:43,603
Alright, Hank.

1793
01:21:43,835 --> 01:21:45,106
There's no way out!
It's over!

1794
01:21:45,131 --> 01:21:47,186
They are going to fish jail!

1795
01:21:47,407 --> 01:21:48,519
Wait.

1796
01:21:48,718 --> 01:21:49,985
Oh no.

1797
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:53,430
Get back!
Get back...

1798
01:21:53,519 --> 01:21:55,200
- AHH!
- AHH!

1799
01:21:55,226 --> 01:21:59,186
I see trees of green,

1800
01:21:59,744 --> 01:22:02,862
red roses too.

1801
01:22:03,037 --> 01:22:06,096
I see them bloom,

1802
01:22:06,532 --> 01:22:08,771
for me and you.

1803
01:22:09,149 --> 01:22:14,579
- Free!
- Free!

1804
01:22:31,636 --> 01:22:34,672
Dory!

1805
01:22:34,698 --> 01:22:38,506
What lies before you represents
the third and final part

1806
01:22:38,531 --> 01:22:40,844
of the marine life mission.

1807
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:46,740
Rescue, rehabilitation and release.

1808
01:22:46,765 --> 01:22:49,232
Come to Papa.

1809
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:58,345
I'm Sigourney Weaver.
Thank you for joining me.

1810
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:04,708
1, 2, 3, 4.

1811
01:23:04,733 --> 01:23:07,945
Uh... Wait a minute.
Why am I counting?

1812
01:23:07,977 --> 01:23:09,306
Hey, where's everyone?

1813
01:23:09,331 --> 01:23:11,560
Oh oh, did...
Did they leave me?

1814
01:23:11,585 --> 01:23:13,745
No. No no.
They wouldn't do that.

1815
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:15,564
Okay, that's okay.
I can figure this out.

1816
01:23:15,589 --> 01:23:17,815
What was I just doing then?
I was um...

1817
01:23:18,073 --> 01:23:20,997
I was covering my face.
So I was trying to hide.

1818
01:23:21,022 --> 01:23:22,704
Okay.
So why was I trying to hide?

1819
01:23:22,729 --> 01:23:23,957
Wait, huh!
Oh, I'm...

1820
01:23:23,982 --> 01:23:26,684
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Ready or not, here I come!

1821
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:28,114
Ah ha, found you.

1822
01:23:28,139 --> 01:23:29,189
- I see you.
- Oh.

1823
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:30,438
Ha ha!
Gotcha.

1824
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:32,593
Alright, you little shrimps,
recess is over.

1825
01:23:32,618 --> 01:23:34,766
- Oh man.
- Ha! Nobody found me.

1826
01:23:34,791 --> 01:23:36,200
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

1827
01:23:36,225 --> 01:23:37,588
Time for another...
Don't touch me.

1828
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:38,626
Time for another lesson.

1829
01:23:38,651 --> 01:23:41,136
When is Mr. Ray coming back
from his migration?

1830
01:23:41,161 --> 01:23:43,286
If he is smart, he'll stay away
from here as long as he can.

1831
01:23:43,311 --> 01:23:45,352
But until he does,
I'm your substitute teacher.

1832
01:23:45,377 --> 01:23:48,318
Okay, kids.
Who wants to learn about echolocation?

1833
01:23:48,343 --> 01:23:49,823
Nobody.

1834
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:53,318
Okay, cupcake.
Have fun.

1835
01:23:53,343 --> 01:23:55,168
Nice day for a swim, huh?

1836
01:23:55,193 --> 01:23:57,262
Alright.
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

1837
01:23:57,287 --> 01:23:59,444
Well.
I guess we'll go back home and...

1838
01:23:59,469 --> 01:24:02,540
brush up on the anemone.
You coming, Dory?

1839
01:24:02,565 --> 01:24:04,536
Me? Oh.
I'm just going to the drop-off.

1840
01:24:04,561 --> 01:24:05,843
Oh.
Okay.

1841
01:24:05,868 --> 01:24:07,752
What?
The drop-off?

1842
01:24:07,777 --> 01:24:10,477
NO!
That's-That's-That's a good idea?

1843
01:24:10,502 --> 01:24:11,203
Yeah.

1844
01:24:11,228 --> 01:24:12,973
I just thought
I go enjoy the view.

1845
01:24:12,998 --> 01:24:14,293
Bye bye.

1846
01:24:14,318 --> 01:24:15,578
The view.

1847
01:24:15,603 --> 01:24:19,080
Well, you have a good time.
All by yourself.

1848
01:24:19,105 --> 01:24:22,677
Not.
Not getting... lost.

1849
01:24:34,561 --> 01:24:35,679
Oh.

1850
01:24:35,922 --> 01:24:37,167
Huh?

1851
01:24:40,457 --> 01:24:42,816
No no no...
Dory.

1852
01:24:42,841 --> 01:24:45,544
Dory.
Dory.

1853
01:24:58,562 --> 01:25:00,111
- Hey, Marlin.
- Oh, hey.

1854
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:01,141
Hello, Dory.

1855
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:02,506
You alright?
You looked worried.

1856
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:04,445
No, no, no.
I'm-I'm fine.

1857
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:06,725
It's how I always look.

1858
01:25:10,878 --> 01:25:11,976
What?

1859
01:25:12,001 --> 01:25:13,918
Well, I just...

1860
01:25:15,466 --> 01:25:16,957
You did it.

1861
01:25:17,116 --> 01:25:18,269
Huh!

1862
01:25:18,294 --> 01:25:20,881
- Yay!
- You did it, cupcake.

1863
01:25:20,906 --> 01:25:23,317
- Yes!
- Did what?

1864
01:25:23,342 --> 01:25:26,367
Sweetie.
You just followed the shells

1865
01:25:26,392 --> 01:25:28,735
all the way back home.

1866
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,910
Huh!
Oh my gosh, I did?

1867
01:25:30,935 --> 01:25:32,788
- All by myself?
- Yeah.

1868
01:25:32,813 --> 01:25:35,027
Do you know what
this means, honey?

1869
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:36,418
It means.

1870
01:25:36,443 --> 01:25:39,908
You can do whatever
you put your mind to, Dory.

1871
01:25:39,933 --> 01:25:41,217
Really?

1872
01:25:41,242 --> 01:25:42,765
Look at us go!

1873
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:45,711
Huh!
Mommy, can I go play with them?

1874
01:25:45,736 --> 01:25:47,750
- Yeah.
- Absolutely!

1875
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:50,155
Go get them, cupcake.

1876
01:25:54,897 --> 01:25:56,179
Yeah.

1877
01:25:56,378 --> 01:25:57,829
I did it.

1878
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:01,493
Hm.

1879
01:26:02,067 --> 01:26:03,114
Hm.

1880
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:10,703
It really is quite a view.

1881
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,400
Yep.

1882
01:26:16,543 --> 01:26:18,714
Unforgettable.
