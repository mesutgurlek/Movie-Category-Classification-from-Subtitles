- Really?

156
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,572
Hey.
May I come in?

157
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:53,138
Oh, please!

158
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:56,674
I get so lonely when I hear
that third attendance bell ring...

159
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:59,847
and all my kids are not here.

160
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:04,792
Sorry, I'm late. It's just like
this new schedule's totally confusing.

161
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:08,455
I know that dude!

162
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:10,863
Mr. Spicoli.

163
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:14,097
That's the name they gave me.

164
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:19,732
- You're ripping my card!
- Yes.

165
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:23,267
Hey, bud, what's your problem?

166
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:25,314
No problem at all.

167
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:29,283
I think you know
where the front office is.

168
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:31,013
You dick!

169
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:34,523
I have taken the time
to print up a complete schedule...

170
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:38,152
of class quizzes
and the chapters they cover.

171
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:41,026
Please pass them
to the desk behind you.

172

Did you hear about this surfer guy
who pulled a knife on Mr. Hand
this morning?

175
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:00,412
Oh, no!
He just called him a dick.

176
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:04,317
A dick? Oh, God.
People exaggerate so much here.

Linda, that girl
looks just like Pat Benatar.

178

There are three girls at Ridgemont...

179

the Pat Benatar look.

Do you think guys find that
more attractive?

183
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,503
Stacy, please, give me a break!
You are so much prettier!

184
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:32,014
Yeah, I know, but do you think
they'd be better in bed?

185
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:34,709
What do you mean?
You either do it or you don't.

186
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:40,222
No. There are like... variables
that I might not be good at.

187
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,557
- Like what variables?
- Like, you know, giving blow jobs.

188
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:48,256
What's the big deal?

189
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:51,892
- I never did it.
- You've never given a blow job?

190
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:56,462
Never? Stace, there's nothing to it.
It's so easy.

197
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:28,165
Good. Push it slowly in and out.
You got it.

198
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:30,365
Okay.

199
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,204
- Can I ask you something
and you promise not to laugh?
- Sure.

200
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:37,770
Okay. When a guy has an orgasm,
how much comes out?

201
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:40,577
A quart or so.

00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,948
[Laughing]
No, I'm just kidding.

I'll get my mom to write a note.

Nobody's getting me into a room
with a bunch of dead guys.

206
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:03,230
You have to go.
I hear it's part of the final.

207
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:06,070
I hear it's really disgusting.
Do you know what they do?

208
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:08,736
- Have you heard?
- What?

209
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:11,177
The bodies are dissected
and Mr. Vargas...

210
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:14,478
pulls out parts of the dead body
and holds them up.

211
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,882
You mean, he reaches in
and pulls this stuff out?

212
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:21,185
- Like stomach and tumors or something?
- Yeah, stomach, tumors, entrails.

213
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:25,717
Good day, everyone.
My name is Mr. Vargas.

214
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:28,696
Look.
I'm a little slow today.

215
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:32,667
I just switched to Sanka,
so have a heart.

216

[Vargas]
All right, now.

217
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:40,031
The World of Life. That is the name
of the textbook we will be using.

218
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:43,075
I'm in love.

00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:47,014
See the mustache comin' in, Rat?

220
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,381
You can almost cross it out.

221
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,087
- I'm in love.
- You are a wuss. Part wimp, part pussy.

222
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,562
What do you mean wuss?
This girl is my... exact type.

223
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,326
- Where'd you see her?
- In my biology class.

224
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,526
- Did you get her number?
- No.

225
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:09,332
- Did you get her name?
- No! No! It's too soon.

226
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:11,396
It's never too soon, Rat.

227
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:15,376
A girl decides how far she's gonna
let you go in the first five minutes.

228
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:19,381
What am I supposed to do? Go up to
this strange girl in my biology class...

229
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:23,249
and say, "Hello. I'd like you to
take your clothes off and jump on me"?

230
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:25,116
I would.

231
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:28,351
I can see it all now. This is
gonna be just like last summer.

232
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:30,415
You fell in love
with that girl at the Fotomat.

233
00:15:30,493 --> 00:15:34,759
You bought $40 worth of fuckin' film,
and you never even talked to her.

234
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,731
You don't even own a camera!

235
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,926
You tell me, Mike.
What should I do?

236
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:41,596
This is what you do.

237
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:44,868
Start from the minute
you walk into biology.

238
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:48,775
I mean, don't just walk in.
Move across the room.

239
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:51,439
And you don't talk to her.

240
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:54,779
You use your face.
You use your body.

241
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:57,376
Use everything.

242
00:15:57,453 --> 00:15:58,920
That's what I do.

243
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:01,218
I mean, I just send out
this vibe...

244
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,782
and I have personally found
that women do respond.

245
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:07,329
I mean, something happens.

246
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:09,558
Naturally something happens.

247
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:12,567
You put the vibe out to 30 million
chicks, something is gonna happen.

248
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:16,503
That's the idea, Rat.
That's the attitude.

249
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:18,665
- The attitude?
- Yeah.

250
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:22,302
The attitude dictates
that you don't care whether
she comes, stays, lays or prays.

251
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:25,347
Whatever happens,
your toes are still tappin'.

252
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:30,045
Now, when you got that...
then you have the attitude.

253
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:35,214
- Good night, Stacy.
- Good night, Mom.

I don't know.

00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:25,504
- How 'bout The Point?
- Okay.

262

00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:43,780
am I gonna get to first base?

00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:28,646
I don't understand why you want
to break up with a girl like that.

309
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:33,052
Me and Lisa have been going together
for two years. I love her and all.

310
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:36,216
I mean, she's great in bed.

311
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:40,490
It's just that...
I'm a single, successful guy.

312
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:47,494
And this is my last year in school.
This could be the best year of my life!

313
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:52,203
I just feel like I need
my freedom now, you know?

314
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:58,078
Okay, here's your preparation stuff.

315
00:21:58,147 --> 00:22:02,311
You got your sliced tomatoes,
shredded lettuce, secret sauce.

316
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:05,149
- What's the secret sauce?
- Thousand Island dressing.

317
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:07,712
What's the secret sauce
at Bronco Burger?

318
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,486
- Ketchup and mayonnaise.
- Gotcha.

319
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,027
Order for you, Bradley.

320
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,493
- Were those flowers really for me?
- Of course!

321
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:20,797
- How much did they cost?
- Don't worry about it.

322
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,838
Want to go to The Point tonight?

323
00:22:24,073 --> 00:22:26,007
What's there to do at The Point?

324
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:30,535
What do you mean? We've been
going out together for two years.

325
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:34,777
I don't want to have to use sex
as a tool, Brad.

326
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,786
Tool? Tool for what?
We've been going together for two years!

327
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:42,153
- I don't want to talk about it here.
- I wanna talk about it!

328
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:44,522
- Brad?
- Lisa!

329
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:46,993
Brad!

330
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:50,725
You gotta flip 'em, or they'll burn.
Great.

331
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:52,791
"C."

332
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:55,063
"D."

333
00:22:55,137 --> 00:22:57,799
"F."

334
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:01,331
"F." "F."

335
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,709
Three weeks we've been talking
about the Platt Amendment.

336
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,079
What are you people, on dope?

337
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,019
A piece of legislation was introduced
into Congress by Senator John Platt.

338
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:16,353
It was passed in 1906.

339
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:18,689
This amendment to our Constitution...

340
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:21,252
has a profound impact
upon all of our...

341
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,824
Where is Jeff Spicoli? I saw him earlier
today near the first floor bathrooms.

342
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:29,735
Is he still on campus?
Anyone? Yes, Desmond?

343
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:32,399
I saw him by the food machines.

344
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:35,103
- How long ago?
- Right before class.

345
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:37,407
Okay.
Bring him in.

346
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:41,709
What is this fascination with truancy?

347
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:45,618
What is it that gets inside your heads?

348
00:23:45,688 --> 00:23:49,522
There are some teachers in this school
who look the other way at truants.

349
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:51,617
It's a little game
that you both play.

350
00:23:51,694 --> 00:23:54,595
They pretend they don't see you.
You pretend you don't ditch.

351
00:23:54,663 --> 00:23:58,360
Now, who pays the price later?
You!

352
00:24:01,036 --> 00:24:03,664
Wait a minute.
There's no birthday party for me here!

353
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:08,202
- [Class Giggling]
- Hola, Mr. Hand.

354
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:10,745
What's the reason for your truancy?

355
00:24:10,813 --> 00:24:13,043
Just couldn't make it on time.

356
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:15,743
You mean,
you couldn't or you wouldn't?

357
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,380
It was like a full crowd scene
at the food lines.

358
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:23,584
Food will be eaten on your time.

359
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:27,220
Why are you continuously late
for this class, Mr. Spicoli?

360
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:31,756
Why do you shamelessly waste
my time like this?

361
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,604
- I don't know.
- [Giggling]

362
00:24:56,492 --> 00:24:58,858
I like that.
[Chuckles]

363
00:24:58,928 --> 00:25:01,624
"I don't know."
That's nice!

364
00:25:01,697 --> 00:25:03,927
"Mr. Hand,
will I pass this class?"

365
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:07,935
"Gee, Mr. Spicoli,
I don't know!"

366
00:25:08,003 --> 00:25:10,528
That's nice. I really like that.
You know what I'm gonna do?

367
00:25:10,606 --> 00:25:14,565
I'm going to leave your words on this
board for all my classes to enjoy.

368
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:17,111
Giving you full credit,
of course, Mr. Spicoli!

369
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:18,976
All right.

370
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:20,743

371
00:25:29,124 --> 00:25:32,821
<i> Sleigh bells ring
are you listening</i>

372
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:34,658
- Mommy!
- <i> In the lane</i>

373
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,288
- Oh, no!
- <i> Snow is glistening</i>

374
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:40,893
<i> A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight</i>

375
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,167
<i> Walking in a winter wonderland</i>

376
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:46,465
How fucking long
do I have to wait?

377
00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:50,676
Christmas sucks.
I hate it.

378
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:53,544
You gotta get used to working holidays.
People are always screaming.

379
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:55,846
I have to quit this job.
I'm gonna get so fat...

380
00:25:55,918 --> 00:26:00,821
- no one's gonna want to take me out.
- Ron hasn't called, huh?

381
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:05,588
- Not since November.
- What does it matter?
He's a stereo salesman.

382
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:08,425
What'd you wanna do, marry him?
Have kids with him?

383
00:26:08,497 --> 00:26:11,762
Have this guy come home
50 years old and bald?

384
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:15,395
And have that little Pacific Stereo
sign on? Come on, Stace.

385
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:17,302
Hey, it's his loss.

386
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:20,434
Got any Blue Oyster Cult?

387
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:23,967
No, I don't have any
Blue Oyster Cult.

388
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:27,709
I ate 34 pairs last time.
Where were you?

389
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:30,115
I was that close to working
at 7-Eleven, you know.

390
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,581
What?

391
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:39,359
- All right! Play me?
- Totally.

392
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:41,726
You got quarters?

393
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:47,701
When are those Earth, Wind and Fire
tickets comin' in?

394
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,864
Earth, Wind and Fire?
Geez, I haven't heard anything.

395
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:52,930
The minute I do,
I'll let you know.

396
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:55,533
I'm plannin' on taking
my little brother over here.

397
00:26:55,611 --> 00:26:59,274
Is that your little brother?
He's a good-lookin' kid.

398
00:26:59,348 --> 00:27:01,316
Great.
Charles Jefferson...

399
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:04,750
for Earth, Wind and Fire
and little brother.

400
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,914
I'll let you know when
they come around, okay?

401
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,158
[Sighs]

402
00:27:12,227 --> 00:27:16,254
Wow! Does he really live here?
I thought he just flew in for games.

403
00:27:16,331 --> 00:27:19,061
Shit! He knows where to come
when he wants some tickets.

404
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:22,570
Go on. Get outta here.
You're messing up my business.

405
00:27:22,638 --> 00:27:25,505
Come on, Rat.
Let's go get you a woman.

406
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:27,508
Wow.

407
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,703
You ready for
your moment of truth?

408
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:32,542
Damone, I noticed I was starting
to get a pimple this morning...

409
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:36,948
Rat, the shyness routine
is really starting to aggravate me.

410
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:41,149
I mean, who is she, anyway?
She's a waitress in a pizza parlor.

411
00:27:41,223 --> 00:27:45,592
Look at her. Look at you.
A member of the Honor Roll.

412
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:48,824
Assistant to the assistant manager
of the movie theater.

413
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:53,960
Rat, if this girl
can't smell your qualifications,
then who needs her, right?

414
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:56,197
- Right.
- All right. How do you feel?

415
00:27:56,271 --> 00:27:58,239
- I feel good.
- Do ya? All right.

416
00:27:58,307 --> 00:28:01,299
Now stop fucking around
and go get her.

417
00:28:01,376 --> 00:28:04,868
Hey, Rat, you gotta ace that jacket.

418
00:28:04,947 --> 00:28:07,381
- Yeah?
- Yeah. All right, that's cool.

419
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:11,852
You look good. All right?
Go get her.

420
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:19,683
$1.10, and you get five cents back.

421
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:21,696
Thanks.

422
00:28:21,764 --> 00:28:25,723
- Hi! Don't I know you
from biology class?
- Yeah!

423
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:30,602
- What can I do for you?
- I had a couple of questions.
I was curious.

424
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:33,539
What do you do with the
jackets people leave here?

425
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:36,806
- We keep 'em.
- You keep 'em?

426
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:40,371
In case they come back.
You can look through it if you want.

427
00:28:40,449 --> 00:28:43,748
No, that's cool. It would take
too long to look through all that.

428
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:46,049
I'll pick up a new one.

429
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,849
What was your other question?

430
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:54,624
Oh, my other question is...

431
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:57,995
can I have your phone number
so I can ask you out sometime?

432
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:02,469
- Do you have a pen?
This one's out of ink.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:13,248 --> 00:29:17,275
Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy.
My name is Mark Ratner.

434
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:21,620
I've gotta go.

435
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:41,005
Lisa, I have something to tell you.

436
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:46,537
Look, I'm a senior now.

437
00:29:46,615 --> 00:29:49,880
I'm a single, successful guy.

438
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,682
And I've got to be fair to myself.

439
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:57,453
Lisa... I think I need my freedom.

440
00:30:01,864 --> 00:30:04,025
Oh, don't do that.

441
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:06,260
- Please, please don't do that.
- Brad!

442
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:10,396
- Can you cover me on register two?
- Okay.

443
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:16,104
- May I help you?
- Ah, yes.

444
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:18,510
This is not the best breakfast
I ever ate and...

445
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,607
- I'd like my money back.
- Okay. I believe
you have to fill out a form.

446
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:25,847
No. I'd like my money back now.

447
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:29,357
I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way.
I have to fill out a form.

448
00:30:29,424 --> 00:30:31,858
Well, you ate most of it
already so...

449
00:30:31,927 --> 00:30:34,987
See that sign?
It says "100% guaranteed."

450
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:37,793
You know what the meaning
of guarantee is?
Did they teach you that here?

451
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:40,528
Sir, if you'd just wait a minute.

452
00:30:40,602 --> 00:30:43,537
Look. Just put your little hand
in the cash register...

453
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:47,632
and give me my $2.75 back,
please, Brad.

454
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:52,203
Sir, if you'd just give me a minute.
I'll find the forms.
I'll take care of everything.

455
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:55,250
I don't have a minute.
You've made me late enough.

456
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:58,115
I am so tired of dealing
with incompetence.

457
00:30:58,186 --> 00:31:01,212
It says 100% guaranteed,
you moron!

458
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,624
Mister, if you don't shut up,
I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.

459
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:09,130
Ah, is there a problem here?
Can I help you, sir?

460
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:14,225
You bet you have a problem.
Your employee used profanity
and threatened me with violence.

461
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:17,033
I'm surprised. I eat here all the time
and usually have good service.

462
00:31:17,105 --> 00:31:22,099
All I wanted was my money back on this
breakfast. It was a little under-cooked.

463
00:31:22,177 --> 00:31:25,010
And he threatens me with violence.
I'm gonna call your super...

464
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,311
I can take care of it.

465
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:34,015
Mr. Hamilton, did you threaten this
customer or use profanity in any way?

466
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:39,220
Uh... he insulted me first.
He called me a moron, Dennis.

467
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:42,889
Answer me! Did you threaten
this customer or use profanity?

468
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:45,593
- Yes.
- You're fired.

469
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:49,433
I'm very sorry, sir.
I'll refund your money right now.

470
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,438
I hope you won't hold this against us.

471
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:54,202
You know how these young kids are
these days.

472
00:31:54,276 --> 00:31:56,710
[Dennis] Here we are.
Perhaps another breakfast?

473
00:31:56,778 --> 00:31:59,906
I hope you had
a hell of a piss, Arnold!

474
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:09,924
[Announcer] The world's finest
surfers showed up today to do battle...

475
00:32:09,992 --> 00:32:14,554
with what's turned out to be the biggest
waves to hit this coast since 1946.

476
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:17,063
Hello. I'm Stu Nahan,
and I'd like you to meet this young man.

477
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:21,125
His name, Jeff Spicoli.
Jeff, congratulations.

478
00:32:21,203 --> 00:32:23,728
Things looked rough out there today.

479
00:32:23,805 --> 00:32:27,332
I'll tell you, Stu,
I did battle with some humongous waves.

480
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:32,346
Just like I told the guy on ABC,
"Danger is my business."

481
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:37,374
A lot of people
expected Mark "Cutback" Davis,
or Bob "Jungle Vet" Gerard...

482
00:32:37,452 --> 00:32:40,979
- would take the honors this year.
- Those guys are fags!

483
00:32:41,056 --> 00:32:44,822
Let me ask you. When you get out there,
do you ever fear for your life?

484
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:49,489
Stu, surfing's not a sport.
It's a way of life. It's no hobby.

485
00:32:49,564 --> 00:32:54,297
It's a way of looking at that wave
and saying, "Hey, bud, let's party!"

486
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,637
[Laughing]
Where'd you get this jacket?

487
00:32:56,705 --> 00:33:00,607
From the network. Let me ask you,
what's next for Jeff Spicoli?

488
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:04,668
Headed over to the Australian
and then the Hawaiian Internationals.

489
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:09,046
Then me and Mick are gonna wing on over
to London and jam with the Stones.

490
00:33:09,684 --> 00:33:13,450
You guys are invited too.

491
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:15,752
[Boy Knocking On Door]
Jeff! Jeff!

492
00:33:15,824 --> 00:33:19,021
Jeff, Dad says you have to get up.

493
00:33:19,094 --> 00:33:22,928
- Leave me alone.
- Dad says you're gonna be late again,
you butthole!

494
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:26,661
- Leave me alone!
- Dad says you're gonna be late again,
you booger!

495
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:30,501
Dad, Jeff threw his snorkel at me!

496
00:33:32,574 --> 00:33:36,135
We just want to say that
we're not Spirit Bunnies anymore.

497
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:40,147
We always hated that name.
It bugged the heck out of Dina and me.

498
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:42,775
- It's just such a put-down!
- Really!

499
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:47,049
We know you've got a lot of spirit,
everybody, right?

500
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:50,455
And we're gonna destroy Lincoln
next week! All right!

501
00:33:54,196 --> 00:33:57,563
You know, it takes a lot
of courage to get up here...

502
00:33:57,632 --> 00:34:00,294
and do something that
you know people will make fun of.

503
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:03,565
- Yeah.
- Man...

504
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:06,334
I'm never gonna talk
to those guys again.

505
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:10,367
I'm the one who got Arnold and Dave
their jobs there in the first place.

506
00:34:10,445 --> 00:34:13,346
If you'd apologize to Dennis,
I'm sure he'd take you back.

507
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:16,816
Fuck Dennis Taylor!
I'm not gonna apologize to that wimp.

508
00:34:20,255 --> 00:34:22,587
I'm just glad
we're still together...

509
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:27,060
because a lot's happened,
and I really need you this year.

510
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,498
Look, Brad, I've been trying
to think of a way to tell you this.

511
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:37,204
We're almost out of school.
It's our last year.

512
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:41,834
And I think we owe it
to ourselves to be free,

513
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:45,744
to go out with other people.

514
00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:50,582
I still want to be friends.

515
00:34:50,652 --> 00:34:53,678
What do I say to her
once we get in the car?

516
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:58,055
No problem, Rat. What you need
is my special five-point plan.

517
00:34:58,126 --> 00:35:00,287
Come on, Damone, I need real help.

518
00:35:00,362 --> 00:35:02,353
What'd you mean?
Men have died...

519
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,661
trying to obtain this
valuable information.

520
00:35:05,734 --> 00:35:07,668
- But I'll give it to you for free.
- What's your five-point plan?

521
00:35:10,672 --> 00:35:14,130
All right.
Now, pay attention.

522
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:20,070
First of all, you never let on
how much you like a girl.

523
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:23,242
Oh, Debbie... hi.

524
00:35:24,386 --> 00:35:27,617
Two.
You always call the shots.

525
00:35:27,689 --> 00:35:31,386
Kiss me, you won't regret it.

526
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:35,896
Three. Act like wherever you are,
that's the place to be.

527
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:39,123
Isn't this great?

528
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:41,726
Four.

529
00:35:41,803 --> 00:35:45,000
When ordering food, find out what she
wants, then order for the both of you.

530
00:35:45,073 --> 00:35:46,973
It's a classy move.

531
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:50,273
The lady will have
the linguine in a white clam sauce,

532
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:52,745
and a coke with no ice.

533
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:54,543
And five.

534
00:35:54,616 --> 00:35:58,177
Now, this is most important, Rat.

535
00:35:58,253 --> 00:36:00,346
When it comes down to makin' out,

536
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:02,413
whenever possible,

537
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,219
put on side one
of Led Zeppelin IV.

538
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,591

539
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,901
- This is a nice car.
- Yeah. It's my sister's.

540
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:21,101
Yeah?

541
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,472
Do you have Mrs. George
for English?

542
00:36:25,547 --> 00:36:30,041
- Yeah. She's pretty good.
- Yeah, she is pretty good.

543
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:41,027
- Have you decided?
- Um, yeah.

544
00:36:41,096 --> 00:36:43,792
I'll have the knockwurst.

545
00:36:43,865 --> 00:36:46,129
Excellent.

546
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:49,068
You work at Cinema Four, right?

547
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:51,970
That must be great.
You get to see all those free movies.

548
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,237
You get free popcorn.

549
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,677
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

550
00:36:58,747 --> 00:37:01,181
Would you mind if I excuse
myself for a moment?

551
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:03,410
Oh, no, go ahead.

552
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:06,010
Are you ready to order here?

553
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:11,052
She will have the knockwurst.

554
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:14,095
And you?

555
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:17,029
- I'll have the same.
- Anything to drink?

556
00:37:17,098 --> 00:37:19,532
- Coke.
- Two Cokes.

557
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:22,661
Okay.
Thank you.

558
00:37:24,172 --> 00:37:26,163
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

Um... yeah.

- Me too.

I'm real sorry someone broke in

at such a fancy place.

You want to come in for a sec?

Um, you want to look
at a photo album?

I keep a lot of pictures

This is me being stupid.

You had Degan?

- He always wore the same suit!
- The same suit!

621
00:41:34,522 --> 00:41:37,980
- He must've had 500 of those suits.

No. Look, l... She gets crazy.

And you are a close

01:04:04,304 --> 01:04:07,296
Half, okay?
And a ride to the clinic.

911
01:04:07,374 --> 01:04:09,842
Seventy-five dollars and a ride.

912
01:04:11,344 --> 01:04:12,902
Okay.

913
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,243
Okay. Thanks.

914
01:04:19,352 --> 01:04:21,320
Thank you.

[Damone]
Rick, I need that $50 you owe me.

917
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:33,590
- Don't have it.
- I know times are tight,
but I really need it.

918
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:37,831
- Don't have it now.
- When you needed the tickets,
I got 'em for you.

919
01:04:37,904 --> 01:04:40,270
So close to stage
you probably scared the band.

920
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,774
I'm not the Bank of America.

921
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:45,902
I know you're not the Bank of America,
but I need my $50.

922
01:04:45,979 --> 01:04:49,745
- How about Thursday?
- Thursday's too late.
I need it tonight.

923
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:52,376
Can't give you what I don't have.

924
01:04:52,452 --> 01:04:57,151
Just forget about it.
I'll get it from you Thursday, okay?

925
01:04:57,223 --> 01:04:59,623
All right.
See ya.

Stacy, he says he's helping
his father in the garage.

938
01:05:42,502 --> 01:05:43,935
He'll call you later.

Wait a second.

941
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:57,377

We're just going bowling.
- Okay.

01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,384

Debbie, you ready to leave?
- Yes. Thank you.

Stacy, I can't let you go
unless you have a ride home.

to meet me downstairs.

Since when do you
go bowling anyway?

950
01:06:48,034 --> 01:06:51,265
Okay, Brad.
Please don't tell Mom and Dad.

951

Come on!
Who did it?

I told you to tell Mike to pay for it.
Why didn't you tell him?

Linda, he didn't show up.

That little prick!

961
01:07:32,745 --> 01:07:35,714
I called his house.

962
01:07:35,782 --> 01:07:40,276
His mother told me he was
in the garage helping his father.

963

Mike Damone's
a no-brain little prick, Stacy.

964

I'm not gonna let him
get away with this.

965

Linda, please don't do anything.
I don't even like the guy.

Hi, Mikey!
[Giggling]

972
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:41,740
Hi, Damone.

973
01:08:52,725 --> 01:08:56,126
Damone, what went on
between you and Stacy?

974
01:08:56,196 --> 01:09:00,292
Let me tell you something.
Sometimes girls go haywire.

975
01:09:00,366 --> 01:09:04,666
It happened a month ago.
I've been trying to think
of a way to tell you ever since.

976
01:09:04,737 --> 01:09:08,605
We were out... messin' around,
and something happened.

977
01:09:08,675 --> 01:09:11,473
It's over.
It's no big deal.

978
01:09:11,544 --> 01:09:14,479
I never even called her again.

979
01:09:17,517 --> 01:09:19,985
If you ask me,
she's a very aggressive girl.

980
01:09:20,053 --> 01:09:22,886
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't understand.

981
01:09:22,956 --> 01:09:27,325
- She never really was your girlfriend.
- Fuck you, Damone.

982
01:09:27,393 --> 01:09:31,921
There are a lot of girls out there,
and you have to mess around with Stacy?

983
01:09:31,998 --> 01:09:34,523
What do you gotta prove, anyway?

984
01:09:35,435 --> 01:09:37,369
I'm sorry.

985
01:09:37,437 --> 01:09:40,065
I always stick up for you.

986
01:09:40,139 --> 01:09:44,371
Whenever people say, "That Damone, he's
a loudmouth," and they say that a lot,

987
01:09:44,444 --> 01:09:47,208
I always say,
"Hey, you just don't know Damone."

988
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:51,148
When they call you an idiot,
I say, "Damone's not an idiot.
You just don't know him."

989
01:09:51,217 --> 01:09:55,984
Well, you know something, man?
Maybe they do know you pretty good.

990
01:09:56,055 --> 01:09:58,182
Maybe I'm just finding out now.

991

- A big talker, man!
- Knock this crap off!

997
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,342
Take it somewhere else.

998
01:10:19,412 --> 01:10:22,074
Not in my gym, buddy.

Hurry up.

1002

Today we're going to explore
how this hospital preserves human life.

1003
01:10:47,974 --> 01:10:52,308
We'll be visiting every floor
where these fine doctors and nurses...

1009
01:11:12,632 --> 01:11:14,566
Class, this is Dr. Miller.

1010
01:11:14,634 --> 01:11:17,694
He'll be joining us
for the last part of our tour today.

1011
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:20,534
If you guys will follow me, please.

1012
01:11:22,542 --> 01:11:25,477
I'd like to ask you one last time.

1013
01:11:25,545 --> 01:11:29,276
Conduct yourselves
with the utmost maturity.

1014

- [Mr. Vargas] Yes, Greg?
- Who are these guys?

1016
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,334
Most of them are derelicts.

1017
01:11:50,403 --> 01:11:53,429
They sold their bodies
to medicine for money.

1018
01:11:53,506 --> 01:11:56,942
- About $30, I think?
- Twenty-five.

This gentleman here is named Arthur.

1021
01:12:01,748 --> 01:12:05,047
Arthur was good enough
to die last week of heart failure.

Here an incision has been made.

The ribs have been sawed off,

1026
01:12:20,366 --> 01:12:25,235
allowing us to remove
the breastplate...

1027

and really observe the human organs
as they exist in their natural state.

1028

Here we have the human lungs.

1029
01:12:32,845 --> 01:12:35,871
And here is the human heart
which, you can see,

01:15:26,052 --> 01:15:28,077
Mr. Hand!

1064
01:15:28,154 --> 01:15:31,885
Well, were you going somewhere
tonight, Jeff?

1065
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:33,983
Yeah.
The graduation dance.

1066
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,255
It's the last school fiesta
of the year.

1067
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:39,162
Hmm. I'm afraid we've got
some business to discuss here.

1068
01:15:39,231 --> 01:15:42,325
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?

1069
01:15:42,401 --> 01:15:46,667
According to my calculations,
Mr. Spicoli,

1070
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:51,767
you wasted a total of, uh,
eight hours of my time this year.

1071
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:56,178
And rest assured,
that is a kind estimate.

1072
01:15:56,248 --> 01:16:00,412
Now I have the unique pleasure
of squaring our account.

1073
01:16:00,486 --> 01:16:05,753
Tonight you and I are going to talk in
great detail about the Davis Agreement,

1074
01:16:05,825 --> 01:16:10,524
all the associated treaties, and
the American Revolution in particular.

1075
01:16:10,596 --> 01:16:15,465
If you can turn to page 47
of Land of Truth and Liberty.

1076
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:19,800
Oh, I left that book in my locker,
Mr. Hand.

1077
01:16:19,872 --> 01:16:24,104
In that case, I'm glad I remembered to
bring an extra copy... just for you.

1078
01:16:25,277 --> 01:16:28,041

1079
01:16:48,534 --> 01:16:53,403
<i> He was a hardheaded man
He was brutally handsome</i>

1080
01:16:53,472 --> 01:16:57,238
<i> And she was terminally pretty</i>

1081
01:16:57,309 --> 01:17:00,836
<i> She held him up
and he held her for ransom</i>

1082
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:05,350
<i> In the heart
of the cold, cold city</i>

1083
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:07,079
<i> He had a nasty reputation
as a cruel dude</i>

1084
01:17:07,153 --> 01:17:08,586
[Damone] Look, Mark.

1085
01:17:08,654 --> 01:17:12,590
I want to apologize for
everything that's happened.

1086
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:14,683
I'm really sorry.

1087
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,819
A guy just doesn't do that to a buddy.

1088
01:17:16,896 --> 01:17:18,921
I understand.
You can't help it.

1089
01:17:18,998 --> 01:17:21,296
You're just lewd,
crude and obnoxious.

1090
01:17:21,367 --> 01:17:24,768
- I can deal with that.
- Excuse me.

1091
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:31,838
Are we still friends?

1092
01:17:33,245 --> 01:17:35,645
- Huh?
- Okay.

1093
01:17:35,715 --> 01:17:37,649
All right.

1094
01:17:37,983 --> 01:17:41,350
[Jeff] What Jefferson
was saying was, "Hey!

1095
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:44,583
"We left this England place
'cause it was bogus.

1096
01:17:44,657 --> 01:17:48,559
"So if we don't get some cool rules
ourselves... pronto,

1097
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:51,221
we'll just be bogus too."

1098
01:17:53,032 --> 01:17:55,091
Very close, Jeff.

1099
01:17:57,503 --> 01:18:00,370
I think I've made my point with you
tonight.

1100
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:04,569
Do you have a guy like me
in class every year?

1101
01:18:04,643 --> 01:18:07,476
You know,
a guy who you make an example of?

1102
01:18:07,546 --> 01:18:10,982
- You'll find out next year.
- No way!

1103
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:14,918
As soon as I cruise history, I'm not
coming near your side of the building.

1104
01:18:14,987 --> 01:18:18,115
- "Cruise history"?
- Soon as I pass your class.

1105
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:21,216
Ooh. If you pass.

1106
01:18:21,293 --> 01:18:23,693
You're gonna flunk me?

1107
01:18:23,763 --> 01:18:27,221
Don't worry, Spicoli.
You'll probably squeak by.

1108
01:18:27,299 --> 01:18:30,325
[Laughing]
Yeah! Aloha, Mr. Hand.

1109
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:35,600
Aloha, Spicoli.

1110
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:46,174
Honey,
these are my two star students.

1111
01:18:46,252 --> 01:18:48,948
Boys, I'd like you to meet
my wife, Mrs. Vargas.

1112
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:50,955
Hi.

1113
01:18:51,023 --> 01:18:53,514

1114
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:05,136
Summer!
Yea!

1115
01:19:05,204 --> 01:19:07,832
Totally!
[Yelling]

1116
01:19:10,643 --> 01:19:12,577
[Linda]
I wrote him a letter.

1117
01:19:12,645 --> 01:19:16,081
Tell me what you think.
"Dear Doug.

1118
01:19:16,148 --> 01:19:18,378
"I received your message that
you weren't coming to my graduation.

1119
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:22,284
"Doug, this is not the kind of thing
that occurs between adults.

1120
01:19:22,354 --> 01:19:27,223
"Maybe you've found someone new,
someone more mature.

1121
01:19:27,293 --> 01:19:31,354
"But if you ask me, Doug,
you're the one being childish.

1122
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:35,059
"Anyhow, if you think I'm gonna
sit around and wait for you, forget it.

1123
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:38,501
- Sincerely, Linda." What do you think?
- Uh...

1124
01:19:38,571 --> 01:19:40,505
I have another version
where I call him an asshole.

1125
01:19:40,573 --> 01:19:42,973
No, that one's better.
It's more...

1126
01:19:43,042 --> 01:19:44,976
- Mature?
- Yeah.

1127
01:19:45,044 --> 01:19:47,444
- I don't have to sink to his level.
- Yeah.

1128
01:19:47,513 --> 01:19:50,141
- I can go out with anyone I want,
practically.
- That's right.

1129
01:19:50,216 --> 01:19:54,118
Yeah.
Thanks for cheering me up.

1130
01:19:55,487 --> 01:19:57,978
Come on.

1131
01:20:01,627 --> 01:20:04,755
Hey, dude!
I know that song.

Hey, I'm not.

Linda, I finally figured it out.

I don't want sex.
Anyone can have sex.

- I want romance.
- You want romance?

In Ridgemont? We can't even get
cable TV here, and you want romance.

Another summer at Perry's.
I can't. I swear.
