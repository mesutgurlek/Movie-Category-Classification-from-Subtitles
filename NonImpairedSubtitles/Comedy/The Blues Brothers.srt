1
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:52,705
The assistant warden wants this one
out of the block early.

2
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:54,705
Wants to get it over with fast.

3
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:56,944
Okay. Let's do it.

4
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,309
Hey, wake up. It's time.

5
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:03,754
Wake up. Let's go. It's time.

6
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:56,825
This is it.

7
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,708
7474505B.

8
00:04:10,154 --> 00:04:13,590
- What wing?
- Maximum wing, Block 9.

9
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:14,709
Standard release?

10
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:17,149
Parole, three out offiive.
Good behaviour.

11
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,665
Give me a minute.

12
00:04:47,714 --> 00:04:50,182
One Timex digital watch, broken.

13
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:54,229
One unused prophylactic.

14
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:01,787
One soiled.

15
00:05:19,794 --> 00:05:23,707
Boots, black.
Belt, black.

16
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:29,427
One black suitjacket.

17
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:34,064
One pair black suit pants.

18
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,865
One hat.

19
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,626
Black.

20
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:43,265
One pair sunglasses.

21
00:05:45,754 --> 00:05:47,984
Twenty-three dollars
and seven cents.

22
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:52,670
Sign here.

23
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,103
- What's this?
- What?

24
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:44,707
This car.

25
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:46,625
This stupid car.

26
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,665
Where's the Cadillac?

27
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,784
The Caddy.
Where's the Caddy?

28
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,466
The what?

29
00:07:56,554 --> 00:08:00,069
The Cadillac we used to have.
The Bluesmobile.

30
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:01,507
I traded it.

31
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:05,189
- You traded the Bluesmobile for this?
- No, for a microphone.

32
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:06,627
A microphone?

33
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:10,311
Okay, I can see that.

34
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:13,466
- What the hell is this?
- This was a bargain.

35
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:16,671
I picked it up at the Mount Prospect
City Police Auction last spring.

36
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:20,508
It's an old Mount Prospect police car.
They were practically giving them away.

37
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,984
Well, thankyou, pal.

38
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:27,270
The day I get out of prison...

39
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:30,983
my own brother picks me up
in a police car.

40
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:56,225
You don't like it?

41
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:01,505
No, I don't like it.

42
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:21,505
Car's got a lot of pick-up.

43
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,472
It's got a cop motor,
a 440-cubic-inch plant.

44
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:28,069
It's got cop tyres,
cop suspension, cop shocks.

45
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:30,190
A model made
before catalytic converters...

46
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:32,708
so it'll run good on regular gas.

47
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:36,070
What do you say?
Is it the new Bluesmobile, or what?

48
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:40,705
Fix the cigarette lighter.

49
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:17,945
What are we doing here?

50
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:22,193
You promised you'd visit
the Penguin the day you got out.

51
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:25,346
Yeah. So I lied to her.

52
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:27,425
You can't lie to a nun.

53
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:30,153
We gotta go in
and visit the Penguin.

54
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:33,431
No fucking way.

55
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:32,584
Who is it?

56
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:34,505
Jake and Elwood.

57
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:39,587
Come in.

58
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:57,672
Hello, boys.

59
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:01,069
Nice to see you.

60
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,032
Please, have a seat.

61
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:20,463
No, boys.

62
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:22,624
Come over here in front of me.

63
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:25,467
I want to see your faces.

64
00:12:37,954 --> 00:12:42,345
The county took a tax assessment
ofthis property last month.

65
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:45,153
They want $5,000.

66
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:46,986
Won't the church pay?

67
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:51,186
They would ifthey were
interested in keeping the place.

68
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:54,829
But they aren't.

69
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:59,066
The archbishop wants to sell this
building to the Board of Education.

70
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,667
What will happen to you?

71
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:03,348
I'll be sent to the missions--

72
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:07,586
Africa, Latin America...

73
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:09,232
- Korea.
- Forget it!

74
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:12,704
Five grand? No problem. We'll have it
foryou in the morning. Let's go.

75
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:17,264
I will not take
your fii lthy, stolen money!

76
00:13:19,794 --> 00:13:23,582
Well, then.
I guess you're really up shit creek.

77
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:27,744
I beg your pardon.
What did you say?

78
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,705
I offered to help you.

79
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:34,872
You refused to take our money.

80
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:39,185
Then I said,
''I guess you're really up shit creek.''

81
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:41,905
- Christ,Jake, take it easy, man.
- Elwood!

82
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:44,986
- Ow! Shit!
-Jesus Christ!

83
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,587
- Shit!
-Jesus!

84
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:48,904
- Shit! Goddam it!
- Son ofa bitch!

85
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,547
You fat penguin!

86
00:13:58,634 --> 00:13:59,544
Fuck this!

87
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:14,593
You are
such a disappointing pair.

88
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:17,632
I prayed so hard foryou.

89
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:19,591
It saddens and hurts me...

90
00:14:19,674 --> 00:14:22,029
that the two young men
whom I raised...

91
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:24,184
to believe
in the Ten Commandments...

92
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:27,232
have returned to me
as two thieves...

93
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:31,865
with fii lthy mouths
and bad attitudes.

94
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,910
Get out!

95
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:36,428
And don't come back...

96
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:40,507
until you've
redeemed yourselves.

97
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:50,423
Boys, you gotta learn
not to talk to nuns that way.

98
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,312
Curtis!

99
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:58,862
- You look fii ne!
- Good to see you!

100
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:00,785
Buy you boys a drink?

101
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,425
Boys, things are bad.

102
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:10,426
They gonna sell this place
to the Board of Education...

103
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:12,425
and I'll be out on the street.

104
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:18,033
That money's got to be in the Cook
County Assessor's Offiice within 1 1 days.

105
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:22,671
They wouldn't turn you out,
would they?

106
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:28,544
Shit. What's one more old nigger
to the Board of Education?

107
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:33,470
Curtis, you and the Penguin
are the only family we got.

108
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:36,512
You're the only one
that was ever good to us...

109
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:41,031
singing ElmoreJames tunes and
blowing the harp for us down here.

110
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:45,824
Well, the sister was right. You boys
could use a little churching up.

111
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:48,553
Slide on down
to the Triple Rock...

112
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:51,023
and catch Reverend Cleophus.

113
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:53,912
You boys listen
to what he's got to say.

114
00:15:58,114 --> 00:16:00,025
I don't want to listen
to nojive-ass preacher...

115
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:02,389
talking to me
about heaven and hell.

116
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:06,471
You get wise.
You get to church!

117
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:24,192
All I'm saying is,
we got to fii gure out...

118
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,663
some way
to get that money honestly.

119
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,745
That could be a problem.

120
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:31,108
Like the Penguin says.

121
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:34,709
We got to move toward redemption.
We got to go to church.

122
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:38,150
''We got to move toward redemption.
We got to go to church.''

123
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:39,553
Bullshit.

124
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,704
Come on.

125
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:03,185
And now, this week's sermon...

126
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:06,266
is from our beloved,
the Reverend Cleophus James!

127
00:17:13,794 --> 00:17:16,024
And now, people--

128
00:17:17,314 --> 00:17:19,145
And now, people--

129
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:25,393
When I woke up this morning,
I heard a disturbing sound.

130
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:30,186
I said,
when I woke up this morning...

131
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:32,583
I heard a disturbing sound!

132
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:37,310
What I heard
was the jingle-jangle...

133
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:39,305
ofa thousand lost souls!

134
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,830
I'm talking about the souls
of mortal men and women...

135
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:45,791
departed from this life!

136
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:48,752
Wait a minute!

137
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:53,305
Those lost, anguished souls
roaming unseen over the earth...

138
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:56,824
seeking a divine light...

139
00:17:56,914 --> 00:18:00,384
they'll not fii nd
because it's too late!

140
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:05,993
Too late! Yeah! Too late
for them to ever see again...

141
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:10,590
the light they once chose
not to follow! All right!

142
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,711
Don't be lost
when the time comes!

143
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:17,343
For the day ofthe Lord cometh...

144
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:19,994
as a thief in the night!

145
00:18:20,074 --> 00:18:22,872
Amen

146
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:25,745
Say amen!

147
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:34,833
- Let us all
- All go back

148
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,472
- To the old
- Old landmark

149
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,591
As we stay
in the service of the Lord

150
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:48,472
- Let uspreach
- Preach the word

151
00:18:48,554 --> 00:18:51,944
- Got topreach
- Preach the wordall the way

152
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:56,985
Do it, knowit, feelit

153
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:17,628
Jake, are you all right?

154
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:34,150
Alleluia

155
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:38,510
The band.

156
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:42,952
Do you see the light?

157
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:49,427
What light?

158
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,425
Have you seen the light?

159
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:56,634
Yes!
Jesus H. Tap-Dancing Christ!

160
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,512
I have seen the light!

161
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,067
The band!

162
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:35,746
- Praise God!
- And God bless the United States!

163
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:42,112
Stay in theservice
ofthe Lord

164
00:22:51,634 --> 00:22:53,590
Yea, Lord

165
00:23:17,994 --> 00:23:21,270
We'll put the band back together,
we do a few gigs...

166
00:23:21,354 --> 00:23:24,505
we get some bread.
Bang-- five thousand bucks!

167
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:28,906
Well, getting the band
back together might not be that easy.

168
00:23:28,994 --> 00:23:31,792
- What are you talking about?
- They split.

169
00:23:31,874 --> 00:23:33,910
They all took straightjobs.

170
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:36,064
Yeah? So you know
where they are.

171
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:38,190
You said you were
keeping in touch with them.

172
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:43,792
I got a couple of leads,
a few phone numbers.

173
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:46,786
But, I mean, how many ofthem
visited or even wrote you?

174
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:50,071
They're not the kind of guys
who write letters.

175
00:23:50,154 --> 00:23:52,873
You were outside.
I was inside.

176
00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:56,185
You were supposed to keep
in touch with the band.

177
00:23:56,274 --> 00:23:59,072
I kept asking you
ifwe were gonna play again.

178
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:02,942
What was I gonna do,
take away your only hope?

179
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,872
Take away the very thing
that kept you going in there?

180
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:09,673
I took the liberty
of bullshitting you. Okay?

181
00:24:09,754 --> 00:24:14,270
- You lied to me.
- It wasn't lies. It wasjust bullshit.

182
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:28,546
- Shit.
- What?

183
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,465
- Rollers.
- No.

184
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,112
Shit.

185
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:11,713
- What? What did I do?
- You failed to stop at a red signal.

186
00:25:11,794 --> 00:25:14,024
The light was yellow, sir.

187
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:16,423
May I see your license, please?

188
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,187
Goddam it!

189
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:27,664
I haven't been pulled over
in six months.

190
00:25:27,754 --> 00:25:29,949
I bet those cops
have got SCMODS.

191
00:25:32,474 --> 00:25:37,025
State County Municipal Offender
Data System.

192
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:04,870
Elwood, we show your license
currently under suspension.

193
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:07,263
Step out ofthe car, please.

194
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:30,785
First you trade the Cadillac
for a microphone.

195
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:33,024
Then you lie to me
about the band.

196
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:35,264
Now you're gonna put me
right back in thejoint!

197
00:26:35,354 --> 00:26:38,073
They're not gonna catch us.
We're on a mission from God.

198
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:58,429
We are in high-speed pursuit
northbound on Courtland Avenue.

199
00:26:58,514 --> 00:27:01,824
Black-and-white 1 974 Dodge sedan
with Illinois plates.

200
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,030
Request assistance.

201
00:27:27,154 --> 00:27:29,952
We'll be all right ifwe can
just get back on the expressway.

202
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:34,023
This don't look
like no expressway to me!

203
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,831
Don't yell at me.

204
00:27:37,914 --> 00:27:40,064
What do you want me to do,
motor head?

205
00:27:40,154 --> 00:27:42,145
Try not to be so negative
all the time.

206
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:45,067
Why don't you offer
some constructive criticism?

207
00:27:49,194 --> 00:27:53,472
You got us into this parking lot, pal.
Now you get us out!

208
00:27:53,554 --> 00:27:56,307
You want out
ofthis parking lot?

209
00:27:58,754 --> 00:28:00,949
- Will there be anything else?
- Do you have Miss Piggy?

210
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:23,828
- There's pants and burgers.
- Yeah, lots ofspace in this mall.

211
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:38,270
Disco pants and haircuts.

212
00:29:04,594 --> 00:29:06,425
Baby clothes.

213
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:08,550
This place has got everything.

214
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,784
New Oldsmobiles
are in early this year.

215
00:29:43,394 --> 00:29:45,271
Pier 1 Imports.

216
00:29:58,474 --> 00:29:59,827
Oh, shit!

217
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:39,229
They broke my watch!

218
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:41,782
I'm gonna catch that sucker...

219
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:44,593
if it's the last thing
I ever do.

220
00:33:27,154 --> 00:33:30,032
Nice place, huh?

221
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:21,827
Hey, Sam.

222
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:35,633
Hey, Lloyd.

223
00:34:35,714 --> 00:34:38,831
- Anybody call for me on the phone?
- No. No calls.

224
00:34:38,914 --> 00:34:43,305
Some guy left his card.
Cop. Said he'd be back.

225
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:55,825
This here's my brother,Jake.
He just got out of the joint.

226
00:34:55,914 --> 00:34:58,826
He's gonna be staying with me
for a few weeks.

227
00:34:58,914 --> 00:35:00,506
Yeah. Okay.

228
00:35:02,354 --> 00:35:05,152
Did you get me
my Cheez Whiz, boy?

229
00:35:26,234 --> 00:35:29,032
Well, it ain't much,
but it's home.

230
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:33,789
- How often does the train go by?
- So often you won't even notice it.

231
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,387
What are you doing?

232
00:36:02,474 --> 00:36:04,783
Making dinner.
Want some?

233
00:36:09,674 --> 00:36:11,869
Tomorrow we got to get
the band back together.

234
00:36:11,954 --> 00:36:14,673
I'm gonna quit work
in the morning, fii rst thing.

235
00:36:14,754 --> 00:36:16,870
And how are you going
to get to work...

236
00:36:16,954 --> 00:36:20,071
Mr Lead Foot, Mr Hot-Rodder,
Mr Motor Head?

237
00:36:20,154 --> 00:36:22,543
Those cops tookyour license away.

238
00:36:22,634 --> 00:36:24,625
They got your name,
your address.

239
00:36:24,714 --> 00:36:27,274
No, they don't got my address.
I falsifiied my renewal.

240
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,948
I put down 1 060 West Addison.

241
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,025
That's Wrigley Field.

242
00:36:42,794 --> 00:36:45,547
I gotta hit the sack.

243
00:36:45,634 --> 00:36:48,353
Hey, you sleaze! My bed!

244
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:35,831
This, gentlemen, is the elegant
abode ofone Elwood Blues.

245
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,552
Thanks, Mr Mercer.

246
00:38:37,634 --> 00:38:42,105
- I kinda like the Wrigley Field bit.
- Yeah, real cute.

247
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:52,030
Hi, Sam.

248
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:06,747
Hi. Has my friend arrived yet?
He failed to report in yesterday.

249
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,233
I don't want trouble.

250
00:39:08,314 --> 00:39:11,670
Tell us where they are,
and there'll be no trouble.

251
00:39:25,874 --> 00:39:27,307
Stand back.

252
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:12,992
It's almost 9:00.
We've gotta go to work.

253
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:10,424
Hello, Elwood. Sit down.
What's on your mind?

254
00:41:11,274 --> 00:41:12,627
I gotta quit.

255
00:41:13,394 --> 00:41:15,988
Why is that, Elwood?

256
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:19,111
I'm going to become a priest.

257
00:41:28,034 --> 00:41:31,026
I'll call payroll and have them get
your severance pay ready.

258
00:41:36,114 --> 00:41:38,947
- Good luck.
- God bless you, sir.

259
00:41:39,034 --> 00:41:40,183
Thankyou.

260
00:41:53,874 --> 00:41:58,629
- What's this?
- This is the last known address...

261
00:41:58,714 --> 00:42:01,308
of Bones Malone
and Blue Lou Marini.

262
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:08,107
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

263
00:42:51,074 --> 00:42:53,713
- Mrs Toronto?
- Tarantino.

264
00:42:53,794 --> 00:42:58,185
Ma'am, do you have a Thomas Malone
or Louis Marini living here?

265
00:42:59,474 --> 00:43:02,432
Not any more.
They moved out a long time ago.

266
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:04,823
I don't take in boarders any more.

267
00:43:06,314 --> 00:43:09,511
- May we come in, ma'am?
- Please.

268
00:43:19,714 --> 00:43:23,150
Did they leave a forwarding address?
A phone number?

269
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:26,032
Did they live quietly?
What were their personal habits?

270
00:43:26,114 --> 00:43:28,230
They were good boys...

271
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,511
but they made
a lot of racket at night.

272
00:43:31,594 --> 00:43:33,425
Are you the police?

273
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:35,744
No, ma'am.
We're musicians.

274
00:43:37,874 --> 00:43:39,227
Mr Man!

275
00:43:44,794 --> 00:43:49,151
- Yes, ma'am?
- They left this card. Maybe it'll help.

276
00:44:01,714 --> 00:44:03,625
Thanks.

277
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:01,984
Thankyou. You're marvellous.

278
00:45:04,514 --> 00:45:07,187
Thankyou. I'm Murph,
and these are the Magic Tones.

279
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:09,549
Steve ''The Colonel'' Cropper,
Donald ''Duck'' Dunn...

280
00:45:09,634 --> 00:45:12,626
Willie ''Too Big'' Hall
and Tom ''Bones'' Malone.

281
00:45:12,714 --> 00:45:14,670
We'll be back with the Magic Tones
for the Armada Room's...

282
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,143
two-hour disco swing party
after this short break.

283
00:45:17,234 --> 00:45:20,385
Till then, don't you go changing.

284
00:45:23,714 --> 00:45:27,707
So you're out. You're free.
You're rehabilitated.

285
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:30,672
What's next? What's happening?
What you gonna do?

286
00:45:30,754 --> 00:45:32,904
You got the money you owe us,
mother-fucker?

287
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:35,428
Let's get something
straight here.

288
00:45:35,514 --> 00:45:37,789
The reason he got locked in the slam
in the fii rst place...

289
00:45:37,874 --> 00:45:40,707
was for sticking up a gas station
to coveryou guys.

290
00:45:40,794 --> 00:45:42,352
You're kidding.

291
00:45:42,434 --> 00:45:45,232
He pulled thatjob to pay
for the band's room-service tab...

292
00:45:45,314 --> 00:45:47,782
from that Kiwanis gig
in Coal City.

293
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:49,705
- You did?
- That's right.

294
00:45:49,794 --> 00:45:52,991
So I don't want to hear
any more ofthis small-change shit.

295
00:45:53,074 --> 00:45:54,905
We're putting the band
back together.

296
00:45:59,154 --> 00:46:03,625
Who here at this table
can honestly say...

297
00:46:03,714 --> 00:46:07,673
that they played any fii ner
or felt any better than they did...

298
00:46:07,754 --> 00:46:09,665
when they were
with the Blues Brothers?

299
00:46:12,594 --> 00:46:14,710
You were the backbone...

300
00:46:14,794 --> 00:46:18,389
the nerve centre
ofa great rhythm-and-blues band.

301
00:46:18,474 --> 00:46:22,672
You can make that live,
breathe and jump again.

302
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:24,790
Murph and the Magic Tones?

303
00:46:24,874 --> 00:46:27,911
Look at you in those
candy-ass monkey suits.

304
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,462
And I thought
I had it bad inJoliet.

305
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,704
At least we got
a change in clothes.

306
00:46:32,794 --> 00:46:35,262
You're wearing the same shit
from three years ago.

307
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:37,265
Jake ain't lying, though.

308
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:40,585
We had a band powerful enough
to turn goat piss into gasoline.

309
00:46:40,674 --> 00:46:43,825
We'll never get that fat sound again
without more horns.

310
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:45,745
We'll never get Mr Fabulous.

311
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:47,825
- Where is he?
- Forget it.

312
00:46:47,914 --> 00:46:50,223
Mr Fabulous is the top maitre d'
at the Chez Paul.

313
00:46:50,314 --> 00:46:52,305
He's pullin' down
six bills a week.

314
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:55,670
- Matt Murphy got married.
- Where is Matt ''Guitar'' Murphy?

315
00:46:55,754 --> 00:46:57,745
He opened a restaurant with his old lady
on Maxwell Street...

316
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:59,825
and he took Blue Lou with him.

317
00:46:59,914 --> 00:47:04,465
You'll never get Matt and Mr Fabulous
out ofthem high-paying gigs.

318
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:07,193
Oh, yeah?

319
00:47:07,274 --> 00:47:09,742
Well, me and the Lord...

320
00:47:09,834 --> 00:47:12,064
we got an understanding.

321
00:47:12,154 --> 00:47:14,224
We're on a mission from God.

322
00:47:26,314 --> 00:47:28,828
Mainly French cuisine.

323
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:32,623
No, sir. Mayor Daley no longer
dines here. He's dead, sir.

324
00:47:33,794 --> 00:47:36,308
Private dining rooms
are available.

325
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,743
Oh, no. It was supposed to be
fiive years.

326
00:47:39,834 --> 00:47:42,553
Didn't you get fiive years?
No, sir, not you.

327
00:47:42,634 --> 00:47:44,465
And your name, sir?

328
00:47:44,554 --> 00:47:48,786
Rizzolo, for eight at 1 1 :30.
Thankyou.

329
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,865
Mr Fabulous,
how marvellous it is to see you.

330
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,787
- You're looking younger than ever.
- Wait. You guys can't come in here.

331
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,865
Nonsense, my dear fellow.

332
00:47:58,954 --> 00:48:00,910
My brother and I
have come to dine...

333
00:48:00,994 --> 00:48:03,747
to celebrate my early release
from the service ofthe state.

334
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:06,545
Wait. Let's talk outside.

335
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,545
- Let's have a cup ofcoffee outside.
- Why, heavens, no.

336
00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:11,592
We seek a full meal and all
the compliments ofthe house.

337
00:48:11,674 --> 00:48:13,505
Come, Elwood.

338
00:48:13,594 --> 00:48:15,949
Let us adjourn ourselves
to the nearest table...

339
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:19,344
and overlook this establishment's
board offare.

340
00:48:20,394 --> 00:48:23,272
Good evening. Chez Paul.
Wait! Hey!

341
00:48:23,354 --> 00:48:27,108
Sir, do you mind calling back
in about fiive minutes, please?

342
00:48:48,114 --> 00:48:50,389
We'll have a table
in a few moments.

343
00:48:56,874 --> 00:48:58,227
Excuse me.

344
00:48:58,314 --> 00:49:00,874
Give us a bottle
ofyour fii nest champagne...

345
00:49:00,954 --> 00:49:04,310
fiive shrimp cocktails
and some bread for my brother.

346
00:49:04,394 --> 00:49:07,989
We have a Dom Pérignon '71
at $1 20.

347
00:49:08,074 --> 00:49:10,144
That'll be fii ne, pal.

348
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:18,464
Seriously, the food here is really
expensive. The soup is fucking $1 0!

349
00:49:18,554 --> 00:49:21,387
Let's go outside.
I'll buy you a cup ofcoffee.

350
00:49:22,154 --> 00:49:24,145
We're putting the band
back together.

351
00:49:24,234 --> 00:49:27,510
- Forget it. No way.
- We're on a mission from God.

352
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,505
Hold it. Hold it.
What's this?

353
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:32,425
Waiter? Sir?

354
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:34,550
Please, waiter?

355
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:38,785
Yes, sir? How are your salads?

356
00:49:38,874 --> 00:49:41,308
The salads are fii ne.

357
00:49:41,394 --> 00:49:45,785
It'sjust that we'd like
to move to another table...

358
00:49:45,874 --> 00:49:48,183
away from those two gentlemen.

359
00:49:48,274 --> 00:49:50,105
Why? Have they been
disturbing you?

360
00:49:51,274 --> 00:49:53,742
No. It'sjust that--

361
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:57,065
Well, frankly,
they're offensive-smelling.

362
00:49:57,154 --> 00:49:59,793
I mean, they smell bad.

363
00:50:02,394 --> 00:50:05,192
Excuse me. I'll see if I can locate
another table foryou.

364
00:50:05,274 --> 00:50:06,627
Thankyou.

365
00:50:17,674 --> 00:50:19,187
Wrong glass, sir.

366
00:51:08,234 --> 00:51:10,464
How much for the little girl?

367
00:51:10,554 --> 00:51:13,591
- The women? How much for the women?
- What?

368
00:51:13,674 --> 00:51:15,665
I want to buy your women.

369
00:51:15,754 --> 00:51:19,030
Your little girl. Your daughters.
Sell them to me.

370
00:51:19,114 --> 00:51:21,423
- Sell me your children.
- Maitre d'!

371
00:51:29,474 --> 00:51:32,944
Cut it out. The owners are gonna
ask me to call the cops.

372
00:51:33,034 --> 00:51:36,310
- You wouldn't do that to me, would you?
- Hejust got outtaJoliet.

373
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:39,352
He's on parole. You can't
call the cops on him, man.

374
00:51:40,234 --> 00:51:42,270
- We're putting the band back together.
- I said no.

375
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:43,833
Absolutely not!

376
00:51:46,234 --> 00:51:48,145
How much foryour wife?

377
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:54,304
We're putting the band back together.
We need you, man. We need your horn.

378
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:56,112
I really can't.

379
00:51:56,194 --> 00:51:58,469
We got everybody except
Matt ''Guitar'' Murphy and Blue Lou.

380
00:51:58,554 --> 00:52:00,784
- We're getting them next.
- No way.

381
00:52:05,634 --> 00:52:08,751
Ifyou say no, Elwood and I
will come here for breakfast...

382
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,746
lunch and dinner
every day ofthe week.

383
00:52:15,074 --> 00:52:18,191
Okay. I'll play.
You got me.

384
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:22,867
Sir?

385
00:52:37,794 --> 00:52:40,262
White men!

386
00:52:40,354 --> 00:52:42,549
White women!

387
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:46,422
The swastika is calling you!

388
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:52,110
The sacred and ancient symbol
ofyour race...

389
00:52:52,194 --> 00:52:55,027
since the beginning oftime.

390
00:52:56,354 --> 00:53:00,632
TheJew is using the black...

391
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:03,751
as muscle against you.

392
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:08,384
And you are left there, helpless.

393
00:53:08,474 --> 00:53:13,104
-Fuckyou!
-What are you gonna do about it, whity?

394
00:53:14,354 --> 00:53:17,505
-Just sit there?
- Go back where you came from!

395
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,346
Ofcourse not!

396
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:22,187
- Son ofa bitch!
- You are going tojoin...

397
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:23,673
with us...

398
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,072
the members of...

399
00:53:26,154 --> 00:53:30,193
the American Socialist
White People's Party:

400
00:53:31,314 --> 00:53:34,590
an organization ofdecent...

401
00:53:34,674 --> 00:53:37,746
law-abiding white folk...

402
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:40,189
just like you.

403
00:53:40,274 --> 00:53:42,469
Go to hell, bastards!

404
00:53:42,554 --> 00:53:43,953
Go to hell!

405
00:53:44,034 --> 00:53:46,104
I pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler...

406
00:53:48,474 --> 00:53:50,066
the immortal leader ofour race.

407
00:53:52,074 --> 00:53:53,871
To the order for which he stands.

408
00:53:55,834 --> 00:53:58,064
One great cause.

409
00:53:58,154 --> 00:54:00,714
Sacred and invincible.

410
00:54:00,794 --> 00:54:03,513
Hey, what's going on?

411
00:54:03,594 --> 00:54:06,711
Those bums won their court case
so they're marching today.

412
00:54:06,794 --> 00:54:09,786
- What bums?
- The fucking Nazi party.

413
00:54:11,194 --> 00:54:13,025
Illinois Nazis.

414
00:54:14,474 --> 00:54:16,624
I hate Illinois Nazis.

415
00:54:16,714 --> 00:54:18,989
Heil Hitler!

416
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:27,228
Ten-hut!

417
00:54:41,034 --> 00:54:43,104
- Gruppenfuehrer!
- Yes, sir!

418
00:54:43,194 --> 00:54:46,584
Get that car's license plate number.

419
00:54:46,674 --> 00:54:49,586
We're gonna kill
that son ofa bitch.

420
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:17,026
Come on home, babe

421
00:55:20,114 --> 00:55:22,184
Oh, come on home, woman

422
00:55:24,114 --> 00:55:28,187

When she talk like that

431
00:56:38,274 --> 00:56:40,230
lcan't take it like that

432
00:56:47,354 --> 00:56:49,868

Thankyou, ladies and gentlemen.

436
00:57:32,194 --> 00:57:34,913
That was ''Boom, Boom,''
a song that I wrote back in the '50s.

437
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:36,712
- No, you didn't.
- It was a hit.

438
00:57:36,794 --> 00:57:38,944
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

439
00:57:39,554 --> 00:57:42,148
I wrote ''Boom, Boom''!
I wrote ''Boom, Boom''!

440
00:57:52,954 --> 00:57:55,707
- Can I help you, boys?
- You got any white bread?

441
00:57:55,794 --> 00:57:57,147
Yes.

442
00:57:57,234 --> 00:57:59,907
I'll have some
toasted white bread, please.

443
00:58:02,154 --> 00:58:04,110
You want butter orjam
on that toast, honey?

444
00:58:04,194 --> 00:58:05,343
No, ma'am. Dry.

445
00:58:07,194 --> 00:58:11,426
- Got any fried chicken?
- Best damn chicken in the state.

446
00:58:11,514 --> 00:58:13,982
Bring me four fried chickens
and a Coke.

447
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:16,269
You want chicken wings
or chicken legs?

448
00:58:16,354 --> 00:58:18,822
Four fried chickens and a Coke.

449
00:58:18,914 --> 00:58:20,666
And some dry white toast, please.

450
00:58:20,754 --> 00:58:22,745
You all want anything to drink
with that?

451
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:24,426
- No, ma'am.
- A Coke.

452
00:58:24,514 --> 00:58:26,744
Be up in a minute.

453
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:30,827
We got two honkies out there
dressed like Hasidic diamond merchants.

454
00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:34,304
- Say what?
- They look like they're from the CIA.

455
00:58:34,394 --> 00:58:39,104
- What they wanna eat?
- The tall one wants white-bread toast.

456
00:58:39,194 --> 00:58:41,947
- Dry. With nothing on it.
- Elwood!

457
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:46,312
And the other one wants
four whole fried chickens and a Coke.

458
00:58:46,394 --> 00:58:48,669
And Jake! Shit!
The Blues Brothers!

459
00:58:49,434 --> 00:58:52,028
- Hi,Jake!
- Matt! How you doing?

460
00:58:52,114 --> 00:58:54,708
- How wasJoliet?
- Oh, it's bad.

461
00:58:54,794 --> 00:58:56,546
On Thursday night
they serve a wicked pepper steak.

462
00:58:56,634 --> 00:58:59,671
Can't be as bad as the cabbage rolls
at the Terre Haute Federal Pen.

463
00:58:59,754 --> 00:59:01,904
Or that oatmeal
at the Cook County slammer.

464
00:59:01,994 --> 00:59:04,428
- They're all pretty bad.
- Matt--

465
00:59:04,514 --> 00:59:06,106
Me and Elwood--

466
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:08,503
we're putting the band back together.

467
00:59:08,594 --> 00:59:10,027
We need you and Blue Lou.

468
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:12,389
Don't talk that way around here.
My old lady--

469
00:59:12,474 --> 00:59:14,305
- She'll kill me.
- Ma'am, you gotta understand.

470
00:59:14,394 --> 00:59:18,433
This is a lot bigger than any domestic
problems you might be experiencing.

471
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:20,425
Matt, what the hell
is he talking about?

472
00:59:20,514 --> 00:59:23,472
- Don't get riled, sugar.
- Don't you ''sugar'' me!

473
00:59:23,554 --> 00:59:25,510
Now, you not going
back on the road no more.

474
00:59:25,594 --> 00:59:28,313
And you ain't playing
any more two-bit, sleazy dives.

475
00:59:28,394 --> 00:59:29,873
You're living with me now...

476
00:59:29,954 --> 00:59:33,549
and you're not gonna go sliding around
with your white hoodlum friends.

477
00:59:33,634 --> 00:59:37,309
But, babes! This isJake and Elwood!
The Blues Brothers!

478
00:59:38,634 --> 00:59:42,024
The Blues Brothers! Shit!

479
00:59:42,114 --> 00:59:45,186
They still owe you money, fool!

480
00:59:45,274 --> 00:59:46,343
Ma'am.

481
00:59:46,434 --> 00:59:48,390
Would it make you feel better
ifyou knew...

482
00:59:48,474 --> 00:59:51,625
that what we're asking Matt to do
is a holy thing?

483
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:54,626
You see,
we're on a mission from God.

484
00:59:54,714 --> 00:59:57,353
Don't you blaspheme in here!

485
00:59:57,434 --> 00:59:59,868
Now, this is my man,
my restaurant...

486
00:59:59,954 --> 01:00:01,945
and you two are gonna
walk right out that door...

487
01:00:02,034 --> 01:00:04,070
without your dry, white toast...

488
01:00:04,154 --> 01:00:05,951
without your four fried chickens...

489
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:08,548
and without Matt ''Guitar'' Murphy!

490
01:00:08,634 --> 01:00:10,192
Now you listen to me!
I love you.

491
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:12,071
But I'm the man
and you're the woman.

492
01:00:12,154 --> 01:00:14,110
And I'll make the decisions
concerning my life!

493
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,912
You better think about
what you saying.

494
01:00:15,994 --> 01:00:18,428
You better think about
the consequences ofyour actions.

495
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:19,742
Shut up, woman!

496
01:00:20,314 --> 01:00:21,303

Let's boogie.

548
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,025
Well, go ahead, damn it!

549
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,547
Shit!

550
01:05:09,234 --> 01:05:10,952
Pardon me...

551
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:13,753
but we do have a strict policy
concerning handling the instruments:

552
01:05:13,834 --> 01:05:16,109
An employee
of Ray's Music Exchange...

553
01:05:16,194 --> 01:05:18,025
must be present.

554
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,706
Now, may I help you?

555
01:05:19,794 --> 01:05:22,592
Ray, it's me.JolietJake.

556
01:05:22,674 --> 01:05:25,313
I once rented some column speakers
from you...

557
01:05:25,394 --> 01:05:27,350
for my band-- The Blues Brothers.

558
01:05:27,434 --> 01:05:29,948
Hey, Ray. It's me. Murph,
of Murph and the Magic Tones.

559
01:05:30,034 --> 01:05:31,672
Remember me?
I bought three Fender amps.

560
01:05:31,754 --> 01:05:35,633
- Oh, we sell a lot ofamplifiiers.
- Not like these. They were beautiful.

561
01:05:35,714 --> 01:05:39,104
- Upholstered with thick, red shag.
- Right!

562
01:05:39,194 --> 01:05:42,743
I remember now.
I'll buy them all back for 350 apiece.

563
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:44,267
Three fiifty?

564
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:46,788
I paid 800 each
not six months ago.

565
01:05:46,874 --> 01:05:49,434
You know-- depreciation, man.

566
01:05:49,514 --> 01:05:51,391
Ray, we're here to buy stuff.

567
01:05:51,474 --> 01:05:54,546
We need pianos, amps, mikes--
the works.

568
01:05:56,834 --> 01:05:58,153
Go on! Get!

569
01:06:02,074 --> 01:06:05,703
Breaks my heart:
a boy that young going bad.

570
01:06:07,274 --> 01:06:09,151
Tell me a little
about this electric piano.

571
01:06:09,234 --> 01:06:11,145
You have a good eye, my man.

572
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:13,190
That's the best
in the city of Chicago.

573
01:06:13,274 --> 01:06:15,663
- How much?
- Two thousand bucks and it's yours.

574
01:06:15,754 --> 01:06:18,791
You can take it home with you.
I'll throw in the black keys for free.

575
01:06:19,754 --> 01:06:22,268
Two thousand
for this chunk ofshit?

576
01:06:22,354 --> 01:06:24,185
Come on, Ray!

577
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:29,505
Really, Ray. It's used.
There's no action left in this keyboard.

578
01:06:35,994 --> 01:06:37,871
Excuse me.

579
01:06:37,954 --> 01:06:40,422
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the action on this piano.

580
01:06:48,114 --> 01:06:51,151
Well, lheardabout the fella

Shake it, shake it, baby

Okay, man.

We'll take these axes.

614
01:09:08,314 --> 01:09:11,829
Naturally. And as usual,
I gotta take an IOU.

615
01:09:45,794 --> 01:09:48,024
You guys go inside.
Get yourselves a bite.

616
01:09:48,114 --> 01:09:50,105
I've got to make a phone call.

617
01:09:50,194 --> 01:09:53,186
Does this phone call
concern our fii rst gig?

618
01:09:53,274 --> 01:09:55,583
Have I ever lied to you?

619
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,383
What are we gonna do, man?
We don't got no gig.

620
01:10:05,474 --> 01:10:07,465
How much money you got?

621
01:10:07,554 --> 01:10:09,510
- I got a quarter.
- That's enough for a phone call.

622
01:10:09,594 --> 01:10:11,585
Come on.

623
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:22,352

625
01:10:24,274 --> 01:10:26,105
Who are you gonna call,Jake?

626
01:10:26,194 --> 01:10:27,912
Do you remember Maury Sline?

627
01:10:27,994 --> 01:10:30,428
Sline? Booking agent?
What about him?

628
01:10:30,514 --> 01:10:33,392
He got us some good showcases
in the old days.

629
01:10:33,474 --> 01:10:35,942
He got us the Morgan Park.
He got us the Ticktock.

630
01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:38,184
I got him laid.
He owes me.

631
01:10:39,194 --> 01:10:40,946
Give it a shot.

632
01:11:09,314 --> 01:11:12,351
There's got to be at least
seven dollars' worth ofchange here.

633
01:11:21,634 --> 01:11:22,987
Sir.

634
01:11:25,754 --> 01:11:27,790
- What did you fii nd out?
- Okay.

635
01:11:27,874 --> 01:11:30,832
I called a friend
at the Motor Vehicle Department.

636
01:11:30,914 --> 01:11:34,190
That license plate is like a rash
all over the computer.

637
01:11:34,274 --> 01:11:36,993
The car belongs
to a known traffiic menace.

638
01:11:37,074 --> 01:11:39,634
- What's his name?
- His name is Elwood Blues.

639
01:11:39,714 --> 01:11:43,593
He's got a record a mile long.
And he's a Catholic.

640
01:11:44,874 --> 01:11:46,990
- Did you get his address?
- Ofcourse.

641
01:11:47,074 --> 01:11:48,632
1 060 West Addison.

642
01:11:50,394 --> 01:11:52,191
Let's go.

643
01:12:04,914 --> 01:12:07,826
Anybody with that kind of record
is gonna make a mistake.

644
01:12:09,514 --> 01:12:11,903
I want all party members
in the tristate district...

645
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:16,909
to monitor the city, county
and state police on their CBs.

646
01:12:16,994 --> 01:12:19,189
Mr Blues is gonna fuck up.

647
01:12:19,274 --> 01:12:21,663
And when he does...

648
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:25,542
he better pray the police get to him
before we do.

649
01:12:33,354 --> 01:12:37,029
We been in this car for three hours now.
Where is this place?

650
01:12:37,114 --> 01:12:40,231
I told you it'd take
a little while to get there.

651
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:45,627
- What's the name ofthe place?
- The name ofthe place is--

652
01:12:47,674 --> 01:12:49,073
Bob's Country Bunker.

653
01:12:49,154 --> 01:12:52,590
- Here we are.
- Bob's Country Bunker?

654
01:13:10,114 --> 01:13:12,503
The sign says, ''Tonight only,
the Good Ole Boys.''

655
01:13:12,594 --> 01:13:16,030
Blues Brothers! It should read,
''Tonight only...

656
01:13:16,114 --> 01:13:18,674
the Blues Brothers'
triumphant return.''

657
01:13:18,754 --> 01:13:20,153
Must be some kind of mistake.

658
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:22,065
You guys unload the stuff.

659
01:13:22,154 --> 01:13:24,748
Elwood, come with me.

660
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,472
What can I get you boys?

661
01:13:47,554 --> 01:13:50,022
You thirsty, hungry
orjust driving through?

662
01:13:50,114 --> 01:13:52,753
Maybe you'd like a beer
or something a little harder?

663
01:13:52,834 --> 01:13:55,394
We happen to make
the state's best pepper steak.

664
01:13:55,474 --> 01:13:57,510
No, thankyou, ma'am.

665
01:13:57,594 --> 01:14:00,108
We may be sucking back
a few beers later on.

666
01:14:00,194 --> 01:14:02,833
We'll be here all night.
You see, we're the band.

667
01:14:02,914 --> 01:14:05,951
You are?
Gee, that's nice!

668
01:14:06,034 --> 01:14:08,150
Hey, Bob, this is the band!

669
01:14:08,234 --> 01:14:09,986
All right!

670
01:14:10,074 --> 01:14:13,066
What kind of music
do you usually have here?

671
01:14:13,154 --> 01:14:16,829
We got both kinds.
We got country and western.

672
01:14:20,154 --> 01:14:22,509
Jake, are you sure this is the place?

673
01:14:22,594 --> 01:14:25,062
Yeah, sure. This is the place.

674
01:14:30,114 --> 01:14:32,787
- Hi! You the Good Ole Boys?
- That's us!

675
01:14:32,874 --> 01:14:35,752
The rest ofthe band's
in the parking lot getting our stuff.

676
01:14:35,834 --> 01:14:38,029
Well, I'm sure glad
to have you boys here.

677
01:14:38,114 --> 01:14:40,150
I'm Bob and this here is my place.

678
01:14:40,874 --> 01:14:43,911
Well, it's a beautiful place, Bob!

679
01:14:43,994 --> 01:14:48,033
I guess you wanna get your steel guitars
and everything set up on stage.

680
01:14:48,114 --> 01:14:51,072
Claire, get up and turn those stage
lights on and get these boys going.

681
01:14:57,474 --> 01:14:58,873
Chicken wire?

682
01:14:58,954 --> 01:15:01,070
What do you say
we have a sound check?

683
01:15:04,354 --> 01:15:07,824
Excuse me, sonny. I'll give this
to you. You're the tallest one.

684
01:15:07,914 --> 01:15:10,189
Okay. What is it?

685
01:15:10,274 --> 01:15:12,469
That there is a list
ofthe songs...

686
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:14,545
that you boys
will be playing tonight.

687
01:15:31,434 --> 01:15:35,029
I don't think we know
any ofthe songs on this list.

688
01:15:36,994 --> 01:15:39,667
This list doesn't mean anything.
They'rejust requests.

689
01:15:39,754 --> 01:15:41,267
Do our regular set.
First tune.

690
01:15:41,354 --> 01:15:43,743
''Give Me Some Loving.''
One, two--

691
01:15:43,834 --> 01:15:45,711
One, two, three, four.

692
01:16:00,074 --> 01:16:01,826
Shit!

693
01:16:01,914 --> 01:16:04,144
What are those damn freak
pecker heads playing?

694
01:16:04,234 --> 01:16:08,193
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We're glad to be here tonight.

695
01:16:08,274 --> 01:16:12,904
We're the Good Old Blues Brothers
Boys Band from Chicago.

696
01:16:12,994 --> 01:16:16,031
We hope you'll like our show.
I'm Elwood. This is my brotherJake.

697

01:16:36,394 --> 01:16:38,385
Give mesome loving

704
01:16:38,474 --> 01:16:40,351
Get off the stage!

705
01:16:42,034 --> 01:16:43,262
Everyday

706
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:46,783
Why'd they turn off the lights?

707
01:16:46,874 --> 01:16:49,308
- Maybe they blew a fuse.
- I don't think so.

708
01:16:49,394 --> 01:16:51,225
Those lights are off on purpose.

709
01:16:51,314 --> 01:16:54,226
We gotta fii gure out something
these people like, and fast!

710
01:16:54,314 --> 01:16:56,589
I got it. Remember the theme
from ''Rawhide''?

711
01:16:56,674 --> 01:16:58,027
Old favourite. Rowdy Yates.

712
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,833
- What key?
- ''A.'' Good country key.

713
01:17:00,914 --> 01:17:02,267
''Rawhide'' in ''A.''

714
01:17:09,514 --> 01:17:12,108
Rollin ', rollin '

We'd like to do a favourite ofthe horn
section. We hope it's one ofyours.

732
01:19:00,314 --> 01:19:04,944

But do whatyou feel,
andkeep both feet on the wheel.

755
01:20:58,914 --> 01:21:00,825
You don't have togo home

01:21:00,914 --> 01:21:02,347

761
01:21:08,234 --> 01:21:09,428
- Ride 'em in
- Cut 'em out

762
01:21:10,274 --> 01:21:14,028
Ride 'em in, rawhide

763
01:21:17,394 --> 01:21:20,466
Let's get the hell out of here.

764
01:21:27,314 --> 01:21:30,624
Shit, I wanna tell you, that's some
ofthe best goddam music we've had...

765
01:21:30,714 --> 01:21:32,830
at the Country Bunker
in a long time.

766
01:21:32,914 --> 01:21:36,953
Well, sorry we couldn't remember
''The Wreck ofthe Old 97.''

767
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:40,583
Why, hell! You guys can learn it
next time when you come back.

768
01:21:40,674 --> 01:21:43,791
Bob, about our money for tonight.

769
01:21:43,874 --> 01:21:46,434
That's right.

770
01:21:46,514 --> 01:21:48,470
Two hundred dollars...

771
01:21:48,554 --> 01:21:51,068
and you boys drank
$300 worth of beer.

772
01:21:51,154 --> 01:21:53,349
When we fii rst came in...

773
01:21:53,434 --> 01:21:56,153
the bar lady never charged us
for the fii rst round.

774
01:21:56,234 --> 01:22:00,113
So, like, we fii gured
beer was complimentary for the band.

775
01:22:03,394 --> 01:22:06,511
Well, I'll just go out
and take up a collection from the boys.

776
01:22:06,594 --> 01:22:09,108
I sure would appreciate it.

777
01:22:15,194 --> 01:22:17,310
I say this trip is nowhere, man.

778
01:22:17,394 --> 01:22:18,907
I say we gotta quit.

779
01:22:18,994 --> 01:22:21,906
What? Quit?

780
01:22:21,994 --> 01:22:24,144
I wish you guys
would make up your mind.

781
01:22:24,234 --> 01:22:27,670
Otherwise I gotta call Mr Ronzini at
the Holiday Inn to get our old gig back.

782
01:22:27,754 --> 01:22:30,348
Back at the Armada Room?

783
01:22:30,434 --> 01:22:33,232
Listen, they want us
to pay for the beer we drank.

784
01:22:33,314 --> 01:22:34,429
So you'd better split.

785
01:22:34,514 --> 01:22:38,268
The next gig is gonna be dynamite!

786
01:22:38,354 --> 01:22:40,663
Huge! You'll see.

787
01:22:44,354 --> 01:22:47,664
I say we give the Blues Brothers
just one more chance.

788
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:50,222
Why not? Ifthe shit fiits, wear it!

789
01:22:50,754 --> 01:22:52,346
Scoot over, goddam it!

790
01:22:58,754 --> 01:23:00,585
Boys look a little upset.

791
01:23:01,794 --> 01:23:04,183
Hey, man. Don't worry.
We got a couple ofdays.

792
01:23:04,274 --> 01:23:06,344
We'll get the Penguin's tax money.

793
01:23:06,434 --> 01:23:10,313
I mean, look. We got an appointment
to see Mr Sline tomorrow.

794
01:23:10,394 --> 01:23:12,225
Everything's gonna be all right.

795
01:23:12,314 --> 01:23:13,827
Let's skate.

796
01:23:15,554 --> 01:23:18,068
Goddam it.

797
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:22,745
Excuse me. Are you
the Good Ole Boys?

798
01:23:22,834 --> 01:23:25,792
That's right. I'm Tucker McElroy,
lead singer, driver ofthe Winnebago.

799
01:23:25,874 --> 01:23:28,308
I'd like to talk to you,
but we're running very late.

800
01:23:28,394 --> 01:23:32,467
I'mJacob Stein, American Federation
of Musicians Union, Local 200.

801
01:23:32,554 --> 01:23:34,863
I've been sent here to see
ifyou're carrying your permits.

802
01:23:34,954 --> 01:23:36,467
Our what?

803
01:23:36,554 --> 01:23:39,148
Your union cards.
May I see your cards, please?

804
01:23:40,594 --> 01:23:43,267
Suppose we ain't got no union cards,
and we go in and start playing anyway?

805
01:23:43,354 --> 01:23:46,391
What you gonna do about that?
You gonna stop us?

806
01:23:46,474 --> 01:23:48,544
Stein!

807
01:23:48,634 --> 01:23:52,309
You gonna look funny trying to eat
corn on the cob with no fucking teeth!

808
01:23:53,594 --> 01:23:58,110
Listen, let me talk to Bob,
the owner.

809
01:23:58,194 --> 01:24:01,106
See ifwe can put your band
on contract waivers for tonight.

810
01:24:01,194 --> 01:24:03,754
I don't want you to move
from this spot.

811
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:05,665
Just let me handle this.

812
01:24:08,954 --> 01:24:11,184
We'll talk to Bob.

813
01:24:15,114 --> 01:24:17,150
Get in the car and start her up.

814
01:24:20,674 --> 01:24:23,632
You know you boys owe me
a lot of money for that beeryou drank!

815
01:24:23,714 --> 01:24:26,706
- Goddam it!
- Bob, we loved playing here tonight.

816
01:24:26,794 --> 01:24:29,388
My brother's writing out an
American Express traveller's check...

817
01:24:29,474 --> 01:24:31,192
to cover the bar tab.

818
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:32,946
I sure would appreciate it.

819
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:36,390
I'd better check up, see how he's doing.
I have to sign it too.

820
01:24:36,474 --> 01:24:41,150
I usually sit in the car and write it
out on the glove compartment lid.

821
01:24:45,194 --> 01:24:46,866
Need a pencil.

822
01:24:57,274 --> 01:24:59,834
- Were them guys from the union?
- What the hell, ''union''?

823
01:24:59,914 --> 01:25:03,031
Those boys skipped out of here
owing me a lot of money for beer.

824
01:25:03,114 --> 01:25:05,389
What the hell are you guys
all dressed up for?

825
01:25:05,474 --> 01:25:06,907
We're the Good Ole Boys!

826
01:25:06,994 --> 01:25:09,952
You're the Good Ole Boys?

827
01:25:28,074 --> 01:25:30,907
''A.F.M.'' Shit!

828
01:25:48,434 --> 01:25:51,392
Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration,
don't fail me now!

829
01:26:04,834 --> 01:26:07,826
I don't believe it!
It's that shit-box Dodge again.

830
01:26:07,914 --> 01:26:10,223
The bastards are ours now!

831
01:26:28,874 --> 01:26:31,832
Holy shit!

832
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:44,226
Boys, you in big trouble.

833
01:26:47,434 --> 01:26:49,425
Maury, you owe me.

834
01:26:49,514 --> 01:26:52,233
We'll play anywhere, anytime,
for anybody.

835
01:26:52,314 --> 01:26:55,863
Put us in the Double Up Lounge, or
the Morgan Park Theatre, or the Crystal.

836
01:26:55,954 --> 01:26:58,263
We always knocked them dead
in thosejoints.

837
01:26:58,354 --> 01:27:01,744
Discos. They're all discos.

838
01:27:03,154 --> 01:27:06,271
Singles. Mixed singles.
Gay singles.

839
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:09,152
These people like to dance
with each other.

840
01:27:09,234 --> 01:27:11,031
We are a dance band.

841
01:27:11,114 --> 01:27:13,548
I don't know, boys.
I just don't know.

842
01:27:14,914 --> 01:27:16,586
Times have changed,
you know what I mean?

843
01:27:17,634 --> 01:27:19,545
What are you guys gonna do?
The same act?

844
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:21,386
You wear
the same farkakte suits.

845
01:27:21,474 --> 01:27:24,193
You'll scare people away.

846
01:27:24,274 --> 01:27:26,026
Don't you ever wear bluejeans
orjump suits...

847
01:27:26,114 --> 01:27:28,503
like Wayne Cochran
and the C.C. Riders?

848
01:27:28,594 --> 01:27:30,107
You gotta come through for us.

849
01:27:31,194 --> 01:27:33,344
We need 5,000 bucks fast.

850
01:27:34,394 --> 01:27:36,271
Five thousand bucks?

851
01:27:36,354 --> 01:27:38,026
Who do you thinkyou are?
The Beatles?

852
01:27:39,114 --> 01:27:42,151
You know the size hall you gotta work
to take in that kind of money?

853
01:27:42,234 --> 01:27:44,668
We'll fii ll any hall in the country.

854
01:27:46,474 --> 01:27:49,068
You guys familiar
with the Palace Hotel ballroom?

855
01:27:50,114 --> 01:27:53,311
- Never heard of it.
- Nice place up north.

856
01:27:53,394 --> 01:27:56,431
Built in the '40s
on Lake Wazapamani.

857
01:27:56,514 --> 01:27:58,266
That seats 5,000.

858
01:27:58,354 --> 01:28:00,663
You guys fii ll that place,
you can make 5,000 bucks, easy.

859
01:28:00,754 --> 01:28:04,349
- Book us for tomorrow night.
- Hold it! Tomorrow night?

860
01:28:04,434 --> 01:28:07,073
A gig like that, you gotta prepare
the proper exploitation.

861
01:28:07,154 --> 01:28:09,952
I know about that stuff.
I been exploited all my life.

862
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:12,389
Forget it. There's no way
with you guys. Forget about it.

863
01:28:15,234 --> 01:28:18,510
Say, how's Mrs Sline?

864
01:28:18,594 --> 01:28:20,505
I might have some information
she'd like to know.

865
01:28:25,314 --> 01:28:27,111
You blackmailing me?

866
01:28:27,194 --> 01:28:30,743
Ifyou wanna put it that way.
Maury, we need this gig!

867
01:28:30,834 --> 01:28:32,347
We're on a mission from God.

868
01:28:35,634 --> 01:28:38,512
Get us the hall, and I guarantee
we'll pack them in for miles around.

869
01:28:38,594 --> 01:28:40,266
What do you say?

870
01:28:41,994 --> 01:28:43,825
Okay. I'll get you the Palace Hotel.

871
01:28:45,194 --> 01:28:47,913
I'll print up show bills. I'll make
the place look real pretty, okay?

872
01:28:47,994 --> 01:28:51,782
I don't thinkyou guys
are gonna gross dollar one.

873
01:28:53,154 --> 01:28:55,190
But ifyou do, I want a taste
ofthe gig, okay?

874
01:28:55,274 --> 01:28:56,866
Thanks, Maury.

875
01:29:03,674 --> 01:29:08,225
Listen, you boys heard me talk

01:29:08,314 --> 01:29:10,589
They used to live here,
just like you.

877
01:29:10,674 --> 01:29:13,063
And I used to sing to them,
just like with you.

878
01:29:13,154 --> 01:29:16,703
TonightJake and Elwood are going out

What is it?

916
01:31:50,394 --> 01:31:52,589
We're out of gas.

917
01:31:53,634 --> 01:31:56,273
Oh, shit.

918
01:32:18,154 --> 01:32:20,873
Wow! A classic. What a room!

919
01:32:20,954 --> 01:32:22,467
This place is gonna swing tonight.

920

It's a fucking barn.
We'll never fii ll it.

921
01:32:24,434 --> 01:32:26,823
We've gotta fii ll this hall tonight.

01:32:28,954 --> 01:32:31,184
Young children?
What do you mean?

924
01:32:31,274 --> 01:32:34,983
Jake and Elwood are donating

01:32:44,954 --> 01:32:47,787
Nope. I said ''we're'' out of gas.

930
01:32:47,874 --> 01:32:50,672
Tanker truck's late.
Should have been here two hours ago.

931
01:32:50,754 --> 01:32:53,746
It's always late on Thursdays.

932
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:57,509
I guess we'll have to wait.

933
01:33:20,714 --> 01:33:22,545
Excuse me, sir.

934
01:33:24,394 --> 01:33:28,103
Yes, you. Could you fii ll it up

935
01:33:31,394 --> 01:33:33,225
Sure.

936
01:33:33,314 --> 01:33:36,226
You want I should wash
the dead bugs off the windshield?

937
01:33:37,354 --> 01:33:39,185
No. I'm in kind ofa hurry.

938
01:33:48,914 --> 01:33:50,666
Where in the hell are they?

939
01:33:50,754 --> 01:33:55,111
So maybe you'd like to come by
and see the show.

940
01:33:55,194 --> 01:33:59,028
I'm awfully sorry, but I do have
a prior dinner engagement.

941
01:34:07,114 --> 01:34:08,752
Thanks, Marvin.

942

I don't see those Blues Brothers.

944
01:34:24,834 --> 01:34:26,028
We'll wait.

945
01:34:28,194 --> 01:34:30,469
Okay, you're all set.

946
01:34:30,554 --> 01:34:34,513
That'll be $94.

947
01:34:37,034 --> 01:34:38,626
Here's 95.
Thankyou.

948
01:34:38,714 --> 01:34:41,786
Okay. And that's a dollar change.

949
01:34:41,874 --> 01:34:45,344
- Oh, keep the change.
- Thanks.

950
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:50,390
So, look. Ifyour date...

951
01:34:50,474 --> 01:34:52,863
don't work out tonight
for any reason...

952
01:34:52,954 --> 01:34:57,072
there's a motel
up on the interstate.

953
01:34:57,154 --> 01:35:00,908
Maybe we could, say, meet...

954
01:35:00,994 --> 01:35:03,633
around midnight?

955
01:35:04,994 --> 01:35:06,985
I'll think about it, Elwood, okay?

956
01:35:09,114 --> 01:35:10,706
Bye.

957
01:35:24,234 --> 01:35:26,031
Son ofa bitch!

958
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:28,985
Come on!

959
01:36:00,954 --> 01:36:03,149
We're really late.
You'd better step on it.

960
01:36:11,914 --> 01:36:14,872
I always like to perform
for angry mobs.

961
01:36:14,954 --> 01:36:16,433
You can't quit now.

962
01:36:16,514 --> 01:36:17,947
What can they be doing?

963
01:36:35,074 --> 01:36:36,905
My head hurts.

964
01:36:37,954 --> 01:36:39,626
That Night Train's a mean wine.

965
01:36:39,714 --> 01:36:41,545
You'd better get bright!
We got a show to do.

966
01:36:41,634 --> 01:36:43,943
Then we gotta fii gure out
some way to collect that gate money...

967
01:36:44,034 --> 01:36:48,073
get it to the County Assessor's offiice
as soon as they open in the morning.

968
01:36:56,034 --> 01:36:57,865
We want the show!

969
01:37:07,794 --> 01:37:10,262
Gentlemen, I'm leaving.

970
01:37:11,234 --> 01:37:12,587
Man, we were so close.

971
01:37:12,674 --> 01:37:14,665
Hey, you guys know
''Minnie The Moocher''?

972
01:37:14,754 --> 01:37:16,984
I knew a hooker once
named Minnie Mazola.

973
01:37:17,074 --> 01:37:19,429
No! The song ''Minnie the Moocher.''

974
01:37:19,514 --> 01:37:21,823
- Yeah. So what?
- Hit it!

975
01:37:50,554 --> 01:37:56,345
Hey, folks, here's a story
'bout Minnie the Moocher

976
01:37:56,434 --> 01:38:01,064
She wasa low-down hoochie coocher

977
01:38:01,154 --> 01:38:04,908
She was the roughest, toughest frail

978
01:38:04,994 --> 01:38:07,554
But Minnie hada heart

979
01:38:07,634 --> 01:38:09,465
Asbig asa whale

980
01:38:29,074 --> 01:38:33,670
She messedaround
with a bloke namedSmokey

981
01:38:33,754 --> 01:38:37,269
She lovedhim
though he was cokey

982
01:38:38,514 --> 01:38:41,426
He tookherdown to Chinatown

983
01:38:41,994 --> 01:38:46,670
Andheshowedherhow
to kick thegong around

984
01:39:26,474 --> 01:39:29,910
She hada dream
about the King ofSweden

985
01:39:31,114 --> 01:39:34,789
Hegave herthings
thatshe wasneedin '

986
01:39:34,874 --> 01:39:39,425
Hegave hera home
built ofgoldandsteel

987
01:39:39,514 --> 01:39:43,871
A diamondcar
with theplatinum wheels

988
01:40:39,914 --> 01:40:42,747
This is glue. Strong stuff.

989
01:40:49,834 --> 01:40:51,631
What the hell are you doing?

990
01:40:51,714 --> 01:40:53,909
This can is from
a surplus disposal run.

991
01:40:53,994 --> 01:40:56,872
Fifteen overcharged ounces
of pure, uncompounded...

992
01:40:56,954 --> 01:40:59,627
isopropyl butane monosulfate.

993
01:40:59,714 --> 01:41:01,909
When combined with oxygen
and a little heat...

994
01:41:01,994 --> 01:41:04,144
it will cause a rapid expansion.

995
01:41:30,394 --> 01:41:33,466
PoorMin, poorMin

996
01:42:15,354 --> 01:42:17,231
- Let's take them!
- Wait a minute.

997
01:42:17,314 --> 01:42:20,989
I've never even heard
these boys sing, all right?

998
01:42:21,074 --> 01:42:22,826
All right.

999
01:42:22,914 --> 01:42:25,030
They're not going no place.

1000
01:42:25,114 --> 01:42:27,753
All right, cover all exits! Let's go!
Come on! Hurry up!

1001
01:42:30,634 --> 01:42:33,148
Move it!

1002
01:42:51,794 --> 01:42:53,989
Who wants an Orange Whip?
Orange Whip?

1003
01:42:55,874 --> 01:42:57,751
Three Orange Whips.

1004
01:43:15,714 --> 01:43:17,944
Excuse us.

1005
01:43:18,034 --> 01:43:20,104
Good evening, ladies.

distinct pleasure ofthe management...

1008
01:44:23,634 --> 01:44:27,547

the evening's star attraction.

1009
01:44:27,634 --> 01:44:31,866
Here they are, back after
their exclusive three-year tour...

1010
01:44:31,954 --> 01:44:35,867
of Europe, Scandinavia
and the subcontinent.

1011
01:44:35,954 --> 01:44:39,549

community...

1018
01:45:41,994 --> 01:45:45,430
who have chosen tojoin us in
the Palace Hotel ballroom at this time.

1019
01:45:45,514 --> 01:45:47,664
We certainly hope you all
enjoy the show.

1020
01:45:47,754 --> 01:45:49,745
And remember that
no matter who you are...

1021
01:45:49,834 --> 01:45:52,143
and what you do
to live and survive...

1022
01:45:52,234 --> 01:45:55,032
there's still some things
that make us all the same.

1023
01:45:55,114 --> 01:45:58,902
You. Me. Them. Everybody.

1069
01:50:34,394 --> 01:50:37,386
You were great!
I've got to record you.

1070
01:50:37,474 --> 01:50:40,386
- Bullshit.
- I don't bullshit.

1071
01:50:40,474 --> 01:50:42,226
I'm president of Clarion Records...

1072
01:50:42,314 --> 01:50:44,509
the largest recording company
on the eastern seaboard.

1073
01:50:44,594 --> 01:50:46,983
- So what?
- Here's $1 0,000.

1074
01:50:47,074 --> 01:50:49,952
An advance on your fii rst
recording session.

1075
01:50:52,234 --> 01:50:53,303
Is it a deal?

1076
01:50:54,354 --> 01:50:56,504
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal.

1077
01:50:56,594 --> 01:50:59,427
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal!

1078
01:50:59,514 --> 01:51:02,187
Listen, all these cops out here--
they're waiting for us.

1079
01:51:02,274 --> 01:51:05,471
We gotta get out with nobody
seeing us. You know a back door out?

1080
01:51:05,554 --> 01:51:08,512
Sure. I used to be head bouncer here
back in the '70s.

1081
01:51:08,594 --> 01:51:12,223
There's an electrical service duct
behind your drummer's riser.

1082
01:51:12,314 --> 01:51:14,225
Do us a favour.

1083
01:51:14,314 --> 01:51:17,351
Take $1 ,400 and give it
to Ray's Music Exchange...

1084
01:51:17,434 --> 01:51:20,153
in Calumet City,
and give the rest to the band.

1085
01:51:20,234 --> 01:51:21,826
- You got it.
- Thanks.

1086
01:51:21,914 --> 01:51:23,711
Bye.

1087
01:51:40,434 --> 01:51:43,267
Me and Elwood are gonna make a break
for it. You and the band keep playing.

1088
01:51:59,954 --> 01:52:03,424
- Something's wrong.
- Where'sJake?

1089
01:52:06,874 --> 01:52:08,432
Where'd they go?

1090
01:52:21,074 --> 01:52:23,383
I sure hope this thing
leads someplace.

1091
01:52:23,474 --> 01:52:26,034
Elwood, we're gone, man.

1092
01:52:34,034 --> 01:52:36,502
Who is that girl?

1093
01:52:36,594 --> 01:52:38,789
Well,Jake.

1094
01:52:38,874 --> 01:52:41,627
You lookjust fii ne down there...

1095
01:52:41,714 --> 01:52:43,784
slithering in the mud
like vermin.

1096
01:52:43,874 --> 01:52:45,705
No problem.

1097
01:52:46,754 --> 01:52:48,824
You're not gonna get away from me
this time.

1098
01:52:54,034 --> 01:52:55,467
Check that out! Let's go!

1099
01:53:14,314 --> 01:53:16,908
It's good to see you,
sweetheart!

1100
01:53:17,954 --> 01:53:19,865
You contemptible pig.

1101
01:53:21,554 --> 01:53:24,751
I remained celibate foryou.

1102
01:53:24,834 --> 01:53:27,507
I stood at the back
ofa cathedral...

1103
01:53:27,594 --> 01:53:29,983
waiting, in celibacy, foryou...

1104
01:53:30,074 --> 01:53:33,544
with 300 friends and relatives
in attendance.

1105
01:53:33,634 --> 01:53:36,751
My uncle hired the best
Rumanian caterers in the state.

1106
01:53:36,834 --> 01:53:39,143
To obtain the seven limousines...

1107
01:53:39,234 --> 01:53:42,385
my father used up his last favours
with Mad Pete Trullo.

1108
01:53:43,394 --> 01:53:46,192
So for me, for my mother...

1109
01:53:46,274 --> 01:53:50,153
my grandmother, my father,
my uncle and for the common good...

1110
01:53:50,234 --> 01:53:53,465
I must now kill you
and your brother.

1111
01:54:06,434 --> 01:54:09,346
Oh, please don't kill us!

1112
01:54:11,074 --> 01:54:14,828
You know I love you, baby! I wouldn't
leave you! It wasn't my fault!

1113
01:54:14,914 --> 01:54:16,711
You miserable slug!

1114
01:54:16,794 --> 01:54:20,104
You thinkyou can talkyour way
out ofthis? You betrayed me!

1115
01:54:20,194 --> 01:54:22,992
No, I didn't. Honest!

1116
01:54:23,074 --> 01:54:24,905
I ran out of gas!

1117
01:54:24,994 --> 01:54:27,986
I had a flat tyre!
I didn't have money for cab fare!

1118
01:54:28,074 --> 01:54:30,030
My tux didn't come back
from the cleaners.

1119
01:54:30,114 --> 01:54:31,866
And old friend came in
from out oftown!

1120
01:54:31,954 --> 01:54:36,186
Someone stole my car! There was
an earthquake! A terrible flood!

1121
01:54:36,274 --> 01:54:41,064
Locusts! It wasn't my fault,
I swear to God!

1122
01:55:02,794 --> 01:55:04,671
Jake, honey.

1123
01:55:17,074 --> 01:55:18,985
Let's go.

1124
01:55:21,714 --> 01:55:23,511
Take it easy.

1125
01:55:38,354 --> 01:55:40,310
You're now going to
totally demolish that car.

1126
01:55:43,274 --> 01:55:47,267
You want to maybe consider
going after the Blues Brothers?

1127
01:55:57,154 --> 01:55:59,384
It's 1 06 miles to Chicago.

1128
01:55:59,474 --> 01:56:02,193
We got a full tank of gas,
halfa pack ofcigarettes...

1129
01:56:02,274 --> 01:56:04,913
it's dark
and we're wearing sunglasses.

1130
01:56:04,994 --> 01:56:05,870
Hit it.

1131
01:56:48,114 --> 01:56:51,550
Shit, man. Can't this damn thing
go any faster than this?

1132
01:56:51,634 --> 01:56:53,864
Bob, I think I've got
a little problem.

1133
01:56:56,434 --> 01:56:58,265
Goddam, boy.

1134
01:57:21,234 --> 01:57:22,587
Shit.

1135
01:57:48,434 --> 01:57:51,710
Don't you say a fuckin' word.

1136
01:58:28,154 --> 01:58:31,464
All units, we have a ten-seven-niner.

1137
01:58:31,554 --> 01:58:33,067
Offiicers are in pursuit:

Southbound on State Highway 47.

1146
01:59:39,794 --> 01:59:42,627

approaching Chicago city limits.

1153
02:00:06,754 --> 02:00:09,587

Maintain pursuit.

1156
02:00:19,234 --> 02:00:21,190

ofthe Blues Brothers has been approved.

Well, this is defii nitely
Lower Wacker Drive.

1159
02:00:55,274 --> 02:00:57,947
If my estimations are correct...

1160
02:00:58,034 --> 02:01:02,391
we should be very close to
the Honourable Richard J. Daley Plaza.

1161
02:01:02,474 --> 02:01:05,034
- That's where they got that Picasso.

There they are.

1164
02:04:21,154 --> 02:04:22,951
- Oh, no!
- What the fuck was that?

1165
02:04:23,034 --> 02:04:25,389
The motor. It's thrown a rod.

1166
02:04:25,474 --> 02:04:28,147
