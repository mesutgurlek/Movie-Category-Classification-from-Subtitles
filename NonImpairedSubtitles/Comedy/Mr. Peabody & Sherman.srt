00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:05,420
<i> Our story begins
high over New York City... </ i>

2
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:07,137
<i>... in the luxurious penthouse apartment... </ i>

3
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:10,928
<i>. .. of perhaps the most unlikely genius the world's ever known. </ i>

4
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:14,303
Oh ,Sorry, you cut me doing
My  yoga.

5
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:17,668
You were expecting “downward dog” perhaps!?
(Yoga postures).

6
00:01:18,192 --> 00:01:20,847
My name is Mr. Peabody.

7
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,269
And since we’re going to be spending  some time together...

8
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,657
... I’d like to 
tell you a little bit about myself  .

9
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:27,288
You see ,
Ever since I was a puppy,

10
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:29,150
It was clear,
that I was different.

11
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,326
<i>  I tried to 'fit in':
"No, thank you"... </ i>

12
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,081
<i>... But never could. </ I>

13
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:38,116
<i> As I grew, I saw more and more of my little mates</ i>

14
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:40,889
<i> being chosen by their new families. </ i>

15
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:45,128
<i> But for some reason,
I never was. </ I>

16
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,570
Come on, boy,
fetch the  stick!

17
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,834
But why?
Won’t you just throw it again?

18
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:53,329
It’s an exercise in futility.

19
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:56,244
I don’t want this one, Mommy.
He’s sarcastic.

20
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:58,155
Wait, wait, come back!
throw the stick.

21
00:01:58,156 --> 00:01:59,537
I'll stay, I'll heal,

22
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:00,885
I'll even shake hands! 

23
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:02,988
Bark, bark.

24
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:05,970
<i> So, without the family of my own... </ i>

25
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,916
<i>... I dedicated myself to the pursuit of
Knowledge. </ I>

26
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:11,676
<i> culture, and
athletics. </ i>

27

<i> I receive my degree at Harvard. </ i>

28
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,666
Valedogtorian  (a dog valedictorian ;) of course
Yehh.. . </ I>

29
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:21,495
<i> And then I devoted myself to helping
mankind. </ I>

30
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:25,126
<i> I  Pioneered new
techniques in alternative energy. </ i>

32
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,054
<i> And in my spare time, I invented

<i>... The back side olly

35
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:41,743
And….. the Zoumba! 

36
00:02:48,022 --> 00:02:51,019
But what I’m most proud of , is my son:

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,974
Sherman.

38
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,808
Hi, Mr. Peabody.

39
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,915
Oh , Have you told them about "WABAC"?

40
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,982
I was just getting to that.

41
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,343
When I adopted Sherman,

42
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:03,603
I vowed to be the best father I could be.

43
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:07,950
To prepare him for all the
wonders of the world, present and past.

44
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:12,462
And so, Sherman
inspired the greatest invention of my life.

45
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:14,899
A Tiechine  “ time machine”!

46
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:25,186
Of course, time travel
Can be a little... unpredictable.

47
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:27,484
There are bound to be a few misapps along the way

48
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:30,760
Let’s just say, the Leaning Tower of Pisa
wasn’t  always leany.

49
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:34,001
But there’s nothing like learning the lessons of history firsthand

50
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:35,477.
Right, Sherman?

51
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:37,824
Where are we going today,
Mr. Peabody?

52
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:40,403
Not WHERE, Sherman,
WHEN.

53
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,348
<b> French Revolution-1789 </ b>

54
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,428
Wow this is the biggest house I've ever seen!

55
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:59,675
<i> it's the palace of Versailles,
home of Marie Antoinette. </ I>

56
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:02,107
 You know, she was mostly famous for one thing:  

57
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:06,562
"Cake! I love cakes so much!"

58
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:14,100
Marie Antoinette surely likes cakes,
Mr. Peabody.

59
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:15,311
Indeed she does.

60
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:17,415
Maria was a woman with a prodigious appetite

61
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,107
For all things covered with frosting.

62
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:22,426
But her expensive taste 
made her the target of much criticism.

63
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:23,099
Why?

64
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:25,591
Because, Sherman, during Marie’s reign 

65
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:28,730
The common people of France were exceedingly poor.

66
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:32,869
- Got any bread?
- Not! I am exceedingly poor!

67
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:36,092
- Now can we have some cake?
- mais oui!

68
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:40,215
Oh yeah sorry
, may WE have some cake?

69
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:41,676
mais oui

70
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:43,446
Maybe she can’t hear me
through the hair.

71
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:46,451
Sherman, what
the queen means  is...

72
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:49,549
Ohh Let them eat cake!

73
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,806
And when the Queen hear the poor of Paris  

74
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:55,354
... could not even buy bread...

75
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:58,191
... she said:
"let them eat cake!"

76
00:04:58,234 --> 00:04:59,727
-Non
-oui, I heard it myself.


77
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:01,370
- It’s Scandal!
- Shocking!

78
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,723
- Down with the Queen!
- Down with the monarchy!

79
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:04,855
Wait.

80
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,345
What kind of cake?

81
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:09,024
Vive la Revolution! (Long live the Revolution)

82
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,440
Vive la Revolution!

83
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,917
Smashing party, Your Majesty...

84
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:18,886
... But now, I'm afraid 
Sherman and I must be...

85
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,317
Sherman. Sherman!

86
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:22,884
Sherman!

87
00:05:25,193 --> 00:05:26,339
Sherman?

88
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,345
Sheerman!

89
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,655
- Dear Sherman!
- Hey, Mr. Peabody.

90
00:05:33,656 --> 00:05:35,184
What are you doing in here?

91
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:37,229
Trying these other cakes.

92
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,604
There is one in here, with whipped cream and strawberries
, that’s...

93
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:43,826
... pretty fantastic!

94
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,735
Sherman, don’t   you remember why  
I told you to stay close to me...

95
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:48,310
... during the French Revolution?

96
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:51,415
Because after the French Revolution, it was gonna rain?
- close.

97
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,052
I said, after the French Revolution...

98
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,008
... comes the Reign of Terror!

99
00:06:00,123 --> 00:06:02,341
Vive la   Revolution!

100
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,627
Round the fearistocrats!

101
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:22,330
The Queen and aristocratic colonies   

102
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:25,544
... must pay the price
for their greed!

103
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:28,724
We will slaughter them like the dogs,
They are!

104
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:30,831
Starting with this one!

105
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:33,990
Mr. Peabody, what should I do?

106
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:36,984
Nothing Sherman,
Just stay right there!

107
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:38,326
But Mr. Peabody...

108
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:42,984
Everything’s going to be fine, Sherman.
Just stay right there!

109
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:51,624
Chop off his head!

110
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:55,901
Mr. Peabody!

111
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:05,555
A cantaloupe? 
The lowest of the foods!

112
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:09,345
Who dares to insult me with this melon?

113
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:15,868
Get that dog!

114
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:18,373
Mr. Peabody, how do you escape?

115
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:19,361
It’s Simple, Sherman.

116
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:21,534
I noticed the 
 distance between the sewer lids...

117
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:24,280
... reasoned  that there must be one 
directly under the guillotine platform...

118
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,770
... noted the loose board
under the basket...

119
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:28,230
... computed the angle at which the setting sun
will bounce off your glasses...

120
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:30,176
... momentarily blinding the executioner...

121
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:32,549
... and chose that moment to put the
executioner‘s melon...

122
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,236
...giving me the added weight to tip the board

123
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:35,964
... to facilitating my exit.

124
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:36,690
Amazing!

125
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:39,720
 It’s not amazing. It’s just the matter of keeping my head.

126
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,338
Keeping your head...

127
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,709
I don’t get it.

128
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:45,940
There he is!
After them!

129
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:48,130
Come on, Sherman, quick!

130
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:53,764
This water taste terrible!

131
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,517
Interestingly,
That’s not water!

132
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,521
Ha Ha I’ve got you now!

133
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,316
Indeed, you have monsieur Robespierre...

134
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:10,299
... And what a master of the chase you are!

135
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,342
Oh you know this?

136
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:15,213
Of course. Doubling back on me like that
 , that  was genius.

137
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:15,978
Thank you.

138
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:18,209
I just hoped you don’t  take
my little confederate   here,

139
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,904
I depend on him so completely.

140
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:21,162
Get over here you!

141
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:23,245
- You are devilishly clever, sir.
- I know.

142
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:24,791
And much quicker than you as well.

143
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,303
But are you quick enough...

144
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:27,470
... for this?

145
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:28,660
Ha Ha See? quick!

146
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:31,409
Quick yes,
but not too smart.

147
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:33,763
Oh  ,  Another cantaloupe!
Your sword.

148
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:36,677
Alright , Sherman looks like
  It’s  time  

149
00:08:36,678 --> 00:08:38,747
for a little pop quiz in your offensing!  

150
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:39,631
Go!

151
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:42,979
Forward! Pairing!
right! Repeat!

152
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:04,610
-ha ha you missed!
- I never miss.

153
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:15,419
-Come on!
- wowww , Yes!

154
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:21,845
Do you smell that, Sherman?

155 
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:23,692
It wasn’t me, Mr. Peabody.

156
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:26,454
I know. It wasn’t you. It’s methane gas in the sewer system.

157
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:29,426
And giving the fact that it ignites 
at 306 degrees Fahrenheit...

158
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:32,759
... we’re about to use it,
to blast out of here!

159
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:34,540
hang on!

160
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:51,941
 wooow

161
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:56,459
Nice landing,
hey, Sherman?

162
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,673
So, what did you learn today, Sherman?

163
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:02,961
The French revolution
was crazy!

164
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:03,980
How so?

165
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:06,312
All those
executions and heads dropped off...

166
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:09,039
... and nobody stand up and say  it
was not right.

167
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,693
And think:

168
00:10:09,728 --> 00:10:11,778
Marie Antoinette
could have avoided the whole revolution

169
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,341
If she simply issued and edict...

170
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:15,054
... to distribute bread amongst the poor.

171
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:16,900
But then, she could not have a dessert.

172
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:18,568
Why, Mr. Peabody?

173
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:23,361
Because Sherman,
You can’t have your cake and edict too.

174
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:25,726
I don’t get it.

175
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:38,500
Where we gonna go tomorrow, Mr. Peabody?

176
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:41,867
  Ancient Rome?   The Wild West?
  1492?

177
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:45,112
No, Sherman. Tomorrow we won’t be going to any of
those places.

178
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,271
Why not ?

179
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:50,545
because
tomorrow's adventure is one that 
you’re going to be taking all on your own.

180
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:52,048
What do you mean, Mr. Peabody?

181
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:55,248
Do not you remember?
It's your first day of school!

182
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:57,452
- Can I drive?
- Of course not!

183
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,898
New York-Today

184
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,499
And remember, Sherman:
no i before e, except before c'.

185
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,525
I know, Mr. Peabody.

186
00:11:13,536 --> 00:11:16,840
And do not forget about the translational principle:
2 +3 = 3 +2

187
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:18,500
I know, Mr. Peabody.

188
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:19,736
And if you have to go to the bathroom...

189
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:22,268
... just raise  your hand proudly,
and say, "I have to go."

190
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:24,114
I will, Mr. Peabody.

191
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:26,810
And remember, the No. 2 pencil
Is standard for most uses...

192
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,919
... but there are times ,
When  the No. 1 Comes in handy

193
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,959
I left a little pencil charge
in your backpack

194
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,829
... which you can use
whenever needed.

195
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,363
I think I'll be okay.

196
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,766
- ok, bye, Mr. Peabody.
- Wait.

197
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:42,975
'll See you after school.

198
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:44,311
- Sherman!
- I gotta go...

199
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:45,578
... I got to sign up for the clubs.

200
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,752
Sherman , no one is  more in favor of   ...

201
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:50,173
... participation in fraternal organizations than I.

202
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:51,879
But before you go...

203
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,808
... I want you to have this.

204
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,610
Thanks.
What is it?

205
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:57,569
A dog whistle.

206
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:04,119
It doesn’t work, Mr. Peabody.

207
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:07,582
It …Works fine, Sherman.

208
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:11,082
It’s just a frequency only dogs
Can hear.

209
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:11,872
Oh , cool.

210
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,497
Let that little keepsake  be a reminder to you
...

211
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,862
... that no matter what challenges you face
...

212
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:19,193
... no matter however far away  I might seem  
...

213
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:21,515
 bye , Mr. Peabody!

214
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,709
... I am with you.

215
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:36,883
George Washington.

216
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:39,464
Who can tell me, who he is?

217
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:41,612
Oh, me! I can, I can!

218
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,333
O. .. Sherman.

219
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:46,492
The first president of the United States of America.

220
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,696
Good job.

221
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:50,852
And when President Washington was a little boy
...

222
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,238
... what kind of tree did he cut down?

223
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:54,937
I, I! Me!

224
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:56,988
- Penny.
- A cherry tree.

225
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:57,941
apocryphal!

226
00:12:57,976 --> 00:12:59,274
What kind of tree is that?

227
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:01,910
It’s not a tree, it’s a word:
apocryphal.

228
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:03,766
It Means that the story is not true.

229
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:04,670
really?

230
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:07,383
Yeah. George Washington
never   cut down a cherry tree...

231
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,187
... and he never said that
 He can lie.

232
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,383
People made those stories  


233
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:12,322
..to teach kids a lesson about lying  .

234
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:13,262
But they’re not true.

235
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:17,323
  he did cross the Delaware River,
Christmas night in 1776 though.

236
00:13:17,324 --> 00:13:19,114
My dad took me there this summer.

237
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:21,595
we crossed it too.
I fell in .

238
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,436
Ha,looks like someone really know 
The history.

239
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:28,184
ha, Penny?

240
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:35,137
It’s really great meeting you,
guys.

241
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,570
Maybe you can come over to my house sometime .

242
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:39,068
I could bring
my new 'model'.

243
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,315
It’s a hydrogen atom.

244
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:42,461
you've Only got one, hah ?

245
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:44,839
Yes, we have to split it.

246
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:46,847
Good one.

247
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:49,992
Check it , guys.

248
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:55,540
What do you got there, Sherman? Kibbles or Bits?

249
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,401
Actually, I’ve got baby   carrots, organic apple juice...

250
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,396
... and tuna sandwich.

251
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:04,017
It’s super high in omega3.

252
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:06,509
So you eat human food, hah?

253
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,042
Yes, why wouldn’t I?

254
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:09,293
Because you're a dog.

255
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:11,264
No, I'm not.
- sure you are.

256
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:13,502
Your dad’s a dog, so
 You’re a dog too.

257
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,417
I think you’re confused.
It’s an adoptive relationship.

258
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:17,791
- zip it, Carl.
- ok.

259
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:20,648
Here , 'll Show you. fetch.

260
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:24,801
Go on, doggy,
Go get your lunch.

261
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:27,657
Go on. Go get it!

262
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:30,792
the humiliation!

263
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:33,571
Sherman, go get your food.

264
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,211
Make like a good little doggie.

265
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,827
- What’s this?
- It’s mine. Give it back!

266
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:48,516
What is it? A Whistle?

267
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:52,330
The stupid thing.
It doesn’t even work.

268
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:53,571
it's   for dogs, penny

269
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:56,112
It operates send a frequency that only dogs can hear.

270
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:58,385
- back up, Carl.
- ok.

271
00:14:58,386 --> 00:15:01,131
Penny, that whistle‘s my private property.
Give me back!

272
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:03,955
- Jump, doggy, jump!
- I'm not a dog.

273
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:07,380
Come on, Sherman. Just Admit it,
you're a dog.

274
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:09,003
- Sit!
- Let me go!

275
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:11,580
Not until you beg like a dog.

276
00:15:11,581 --> 00:15:14,551
Come on, Sherman. beg.

277
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:18,999
Thank you for coming in on such short notice
...

278
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,719
... to discuss the problem with
Sherman.

279
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,405
Oh , it’s not a problem, at all  principal prudey
 I fully expected this.

280
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:25,285
You did?

281
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,122
Yes, and as with all thing Sherman related,
I prepared for it.

282
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:31,310
Here is a curriculum, that takes Sherman
Advanced preparation in acount...

283
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:33,251
... but we both require you to skip on grade.

284
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:34,135
Mr. Peabody...

285
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:36,234
There is some pre-algebra work , sheet and advanced reading list...

286
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,185
and a link to a web Site that I created...

287
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:40,270
... to start studying mandarin Chinese.

288
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:41,818
It is after all the language of the future.

289
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:42,773
Mr. Peabody!

290
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,033
I'm not saying that we shouldn’t study and French too,
Principal Purdy I’m saying have a new look...

291
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:47,341
Mr. Peabody!

292
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:49,507
What? not enough?
Swahili?

293
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:53,447
Sherman got into a fight today.

294
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:54,844
Oh , dear...

295
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:58,963
Pictures were taken,
for insurance purposes.

296
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,070
He bit her.

297
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,485
I must say, it does not look good for you
, Mr. Peabody.

298
00:16:14,486 --> 00:16:16,908
After all... you are a dog.

299
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,474
Who may I ask are you?

300
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:23,211
I am Miss Grunion from
The bureau of child Safety and Protection.

301
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:26,748
We required by law to contact them whenever,
there is an ...

302
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:28,821
... incident.

303
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:32,120
Sherman has never done anything
Like this before.

304
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:33,689
I'm sure he must have had a reason.

305
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,927
- well ,The girl was being bit of a bully  ...
- quiet , Purdy!

306
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:40,019
It is normal for children to tease.

307
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,367
It’s not Normal for them to bite.

308
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,177
Clearly it’s because of how he’s being raised.

309
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,140
In my opinion,

310
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:50,135
A dog can never be
A suitable parent to a little boy.

311
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,939
I must point out, Miss Grunion, that 

312
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,466
I won the right to adopt
Sherman in a court of law.

313
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:57,888
And the court
Can take it away from you!

314
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,842
I’ll be coming to your home tomorrow evening,
 To conduct an investigation.

315
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:06,354
If I discover that you are in anyway an unfit parent...

316
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:10,098
... I will see to it, 
Sherman is removed from your custody

317
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:17,085
Permanently.

318
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,115
I hope I made myself clear.

319
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,628
 crystal.

320
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:30,372
I’m Sorry I bit her,
Mr. Peabody.

321
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:31,807
I won’t do it again.

322
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:36,423
you've done two thing, you wont do it again.this kind of 
want and violence is totally unacceptable.

323
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:40,095
And rather uncharacteristic,
given how you feel about Mr. Gandhi.

324
00:17:40,422 --> 00:17:42,984
What on earth provoked it?

325
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:48,866
She called me a dog.

326
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:57,098
Well.

327
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,268
Alright then thank you for telling me.

328
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:05,043
Trying get some sleep.

329
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:11,253
I love you, Mr. Peabody.

330
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,524
I have a deep regard for you as well,
Sherman.

331
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:41,035
Mr. Peabody , you're a Nobel Prize winning scientist.

332
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:43,497
And added to the head of stick

333
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:44,540
A 'Captain' of industry.

334
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,106
Why would you want to adopt a boy?

335
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:50,978
Because, your honor, when I found
Sherman...

336
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:54,163
... it reminded me of how I started out
in life.

337
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:58,319
And now I want to give him
the one thing I always wanted .

338
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,784
A home!

339
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:02,648
And you're sure you're capable
Of meeting all the challenges

340
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,564
Of raising a human boy?

341
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,386
With all due respect...

342
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:08,791
... how hard could it be?

343
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:10,968
Very well, then.

344
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,255
If a boy can adopt a dog...

345
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:17,772
... I see no reason why a dog cannot adopt 
a boy.

346
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:24,504
- Da-da.
- No, Sherman. Not, da-da.

347
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:26,429
You should call me Mr. Peabody.

348
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,872
Or in less formal moments, simply
Peabody.

349
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:32,420
That’s right.

350
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:34,254
Mr. Pibaba.

351
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,169
What you’re cooking, Mr. Peabody?

352
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,054
Oh, Nothing much.

353
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:20,979
Just a little Dungeness crab   with the passion fruit...

354
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,870
... And basil sauce, some truffle quail

355
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:24,107
sauce berries, and...

356
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:26,280
... baked Alaska .

357
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:28,996
Wow, is today some kind of special occasion?

358
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:29,984
You could say.

359
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:32,808
- It's not my birthday.
- No, it isn’t.

360
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,147
- It's not your birthday.
- Right again.

361
00:22:35,148 --> 00:22:37,591
It’s not Father’s Day, is it?

362
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:40,267
No, it’s not Father’s Day.

363
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,007
- Is the President coming over for dinner, again?
- No.

364
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:46,332
Oh so who is coming to dinner?

365
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,893
Let's just say, if the evening 
Is a  success...

366
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:52,197
... we can put this whole biting business
Behind us.

367
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,928
The Petersons!
Welcome!

368
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:04,187
- So is literally a dog.
- PAUL!

369
00:23:04,188 --> 00:23:05,294
No that’s alright .

370
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:08,346
Although I  prefer
the "literate dog."

371
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:11,278
That’s Funny!
Isn’t that funny, Paul?

372
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,139
He is not a big laugher.

373
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,999
We are so delighted you could 
Make it on such short notice.

374
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,887
Aren’t we Sherman?

375
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,257
Aren’t we, Sherman?

376
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:24,655
Yes,i've just into know what's going on.

377
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:26,818
Say hello to Penny, Sherman.

378
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:28,098
Hi, Penny.

379
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:29,938
Hello, Sherman!

380
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:33,373
Now why don’t you go show penny
your mineral collection, sherman?

381
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:37,100
I am sure we will find those new
  geodes of yours  fascinating.

382
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:38,588
Come on.

383
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,778
I’m so glad you accepted my invitation.

384
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:45,868
Now the kids can resolve their differences...

385
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:47,615
... before   Miss Grunion arrives.

386
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:49,293
You barking up the wrong tree , Mr!

387
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,246
In fact, if it wasn’t for patty
I would have press charges already.

388
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:53,656
Now I have to tell you , Peabody...

389
00:23:53,657 --> 00:23:56,892
Where  my daughter,
is concerned nothing is more important than...

390
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,671
Hello?
sure, I ‘ll  take the survey.

391
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,877
Everything’s going swimmingly?

392
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,549
Why didn’t you tell me she was coming over here?

393
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,579
because I didn’t want you to worry.

394
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:18,720
ok. Because I did not want to listen to
your belly-aching.

395
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:21,776
- Thanks for your honesty.
- You’re welcome.

396
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:24,993
I do not know what
You think that we supposed to do anyway.

397
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:26,324
She Hates me! 

398
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,837
Share her your interests.

399
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:28,814
Tell her wired anecdotes.

400
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:31,470
Mr. Peabody, I hate her.

401
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:34,867
Sherman  every great relationship starts
-from a place ofconflict...

402
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:37,391
... and evolves into something richer.

403
00:24:38,272 --> 00:24:40,281
Bon chance (in French).

404
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:42,409
Make it work.

405
00:24:42,877 --> 00:24:44,937
Do not tell her about the WABAC.

406
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:51,118
Do not even think about it .

407
00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:07,891
Peabody, that was amazing!

408
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:09,658
Paul, wasn’t that amazing?

409
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,608
I'm more in the rock ' n ' roll.

410
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:19,202
I Meant the flamingos.

411
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:26,531
Bagpipes?

412
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:29,542
Didgeridoo.
(Australian wind instrument)

413
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:33,378
Sitar .

414
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:34,863
Steel Drums
(drums from Trinidad).

415
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:36,164
Trombone.

416
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:37,468
Xylophone.

417
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:38,703
Drum.

418
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:39,930
Organ.

419
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:40,724
Oboe.

420
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,732
Piccolo

421
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:42,273
Touba.

Whistle.

424
00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:51,478
You know what?
This has been but a complete waste of time.

425
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:54,089
Let’s  get Penny,
and go home- ..!

426
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:55,600
Are you alright, Paul?

427
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:57,993
I'm... fine!

428
00:25:58,226 --> 00:25:59,650
This happens whenever he’s tense.

429
00:25:59,651 --> 00:26:00,683
Paul, if I might...

430
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,671
Stay away from me, Peabody!

431
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:04,589
Just get back!
I need traction.

432
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:08,414
You can trust me, Paul.
I am a licensed chiropractor.

433
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:23,676
Peabody!

434
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:25,698
I feel great!

435
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:28,540
I really feel great!

436
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:31,198
Peabody, you’re a miracle worker!

437
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:35,488
Look at me. I’m dancing!

438
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:38,491
You know, Penny...

439
00:26:38,526 --> 00:26:41,237
... Sigmund Freud says,
that if you do not like a person...

440
00:26:41,238 --> 00:26:45,158
... Because they remind you of something
 you don’t like about yourself.

441
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:47,433
what do you know about Sigmund Freud?

442
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:48,535
More than you think.

443
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:52,073
Surely . Just like you knew all that stuff about George Washington

444
00:26:52,074 --> 00:26:54,411
not really cutting down  the cherry tree.

445
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,715
- What a crup!
- But it's true!

446
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:58,299
- How do you know?
- I just know!

447
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,073
- did You read it in a book?
- No.

448
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:01,281
-     see it in a movie?
- No.

449
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:03,145
Did your brainiac dad tell you?

450
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:03,786
No!

451
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:05,250
so how do you know, Sherman?

452
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:06,779
How-Do  You -KNow?

453
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,920
He Told me.

454
00:27:07,955 --> 00:27:10,713
- Who told you?
- George Washington.

455
00:27:12,126 --> 00:27:14,793
George Washington.

456
00:27:14,962 --> 00:27:16,295
Yeah.

457
00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:18,340
Liar.

458
00:27:21,238 --> 00:27:23,370
Do not tell her about the WABAC.

459
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:27,123
He calls it the  "WABAC".

460
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,379
So where have you gone it in?

461
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,379
Not where  , Penny.
When.

462
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,272
Okey , smart guy.
when.

463
00:27:34,273 --> 00:27:42,676
1965, 1776, 1620, 1492,
1215, 4...

464
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:44,225
Can
It go back to an hour ago?

465
00:27:44,226 --> 00:27:44,841
Why?

466
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:47,446
Because I can take it home,
Pretend to be sick...

467
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:50,196
... and not come
To this lame dinner party.

468
00:27:50,197 --> 00:27:51,197
Mr. Peabody says,

469
00:27:51,198 --> 00:27:52,743
 you should never use the
WABAC..

470
00:27:52,744 --> 00:27:54,768
... to travel to a time
When you existed  .

471
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:55,612
How come?

472
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:57,838
There   be two of you  .

473
00:27:57,896 --> 00:28:01,076
Ohhh, Yeah . I guess  the world’s
  not ready for that.

474
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,784
Now that we ‘ve seen it ,
Maybe we should go   back.

475
00:28:09,785 --> 00:28:13,147
Are you Kidding?
Where should we go first?

476
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,773
Mr. Peabody says I’m
not allowed to drive it until I’m older.

477
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:19,220
You do everything Mr. Peabody says?

478
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:20,035
Yeah...

479
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,624
You know what that makes you, Sherman?

480
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:24,809
An obedient son.

481
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,900
No. A dog.

482
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:42,372
Nice control!

483
00:28:43,162 --> 00:28:44,353
Don’t let it go, Patty.

484
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,023
Hands up, Paul!

485
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:47,882
Here we go.

486
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,702
Oh ,Yeah!

487
00:28:56,991 --> 00:28:58,384
Look at this.

488
00:29:02,536 --> 00:29:05,625
This is a little home-spun concoction
I‘d like to call:

489
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,728
" Einstein on the beach".

490
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,221
- To the kids .
- To the kids!

491
00:29:16,013 --> 00:29:18,419
- Mr. Peabody!
- Sherman?

492
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,484
Can I talk to you for a second?

493
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:23,113
Of Course.
Excuse me.

494
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,887
I’ve really hit off with Penny’s parents.

495
00:29:28,888 --> 00:29:30,580
I think we can file  
this night

496
00:29:30,581 --> 00:29:32,555
Under   "unqualified success".

497
00:29:32,556 --> 00:29:35,961
- I’d hold off filing it just yet.
- What do you mean?

498
00:29:35,962 --> 00:29:38,138
Where is Penny?

499
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,185
Ancient Egypt...

500
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:43,278
You Use the WABAC?

501
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,911
What's happening, big guy?
We’re running   low.

502
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,717
Ill be right there, Paul.

503
00:29:50,718 --> 00:29:52,648
How
... how could you do such a thing?

504
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:53,720
She called me a liar,

505
00:29:53,721 --> 00:29:56,699
For saying   George Washington
never cut  down a cherry tree.

506
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,082
 so you took her to see
George Washington?

507
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,269
Yeah.. she was into it.

508
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:04,235
- Hey, Peabody.
- Hey.

509
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,134
- Where is Penny?
- Playing hide and seek.

510
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:08,006
- Pooping.
- Pooping...

511
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:09,642
- playing hide and seek.

512
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:12,572
Well, which is it?

513
00:30:12,907 --> 00:30:14,653
What's going on here?

514
00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:16,187
Yeah, what's going on here?

515
00:30:16,188 --> 00:30:17,687
- What have you done with Penny?
- Penny?

516
00:30:17,688 --> 00:30:19,205
Penny! Penny!

517
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,963
- oh my gosh.
- Where ‘s our daughter?

518
00:30:22,348 --> 00:30:24,021
It's hard to say, Paul...

519
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,291
She could be here...

520
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:29,301
... or here, or here, or here, or here
...

521
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,645
that will hold them.

522
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:36,530
I learned that trick from a swami, at the
  Ubud Bali.

523
00:30:36,531 --> 00:30:37,726
Let’s go !

524
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:54,964
Ancient Egypt!
Land of the Pharaohs.

525
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:57,927
A Lighthouse of progress on horizon of humanity.

526
00:30:57,928 --> 00:31:01,926
But a cruel and barbarous civilization just the same .

527
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:05,630
I just hope penny isn’t suffering too badly.

528
00:31:18,384 --> 00:31:20,032
What are you doing here?

529
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:22,184
We have come to take you home.

530
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:24,619
What’s the Egyptian word  
For  tattle-tale?

531
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,931
Mofshi –a-ser “ مفشی السر.” 

532
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:28,601
But that’s beside the point.
Get your clothes on, we’re going home.

533
00:31:28,602 --> 00:31:30,739
Who died and made you ,pharaoh?

534
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,651
Now bring on the mani-peddi!

535
00:31:33,743 --> 00:31:36,264
see, Mr. Peabody?
Impossible!

536
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:38,057
Indeed.
But watch what happens...

537
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:41,877
... when an immovable object  ,
meets an irresist force.

538
00:31:41,878 --> 00:31:43,957
Penny, come here, right now.

539
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:44,926
Penny, come on.

540
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,266
I am not penny anymore.

541
00:31:47,294 --> 00:31:51,617
Now I'm the princess Hatshepsut,
precious flower of the Nile!

542
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,930
Precious, perhaps, but if you think we’re
Going to leave you here...

543
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:57,511
... You are most definitely in DE-Nile.

544
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,306
I don’t get it.

545
00:31:59,341 --> 00:32:00,517
Now, come along.

546
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:01,915
Unhand her!

547
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:05,615
What's the matter, my sweet, little 
Desert blossom?

548
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:07,922
Are these barbarians
Bothering you?

549
00:32:07,923 --> 00:32:10,589
As the matter of fact, they are.

550
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,355
Bow barbarians!

551
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:14,529
As you wish, Your highness.

552
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,629
Who‘s that, Mr. Peabody?

553
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,902
That, Sherman, is the living image of Amon,

554
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,234
Son of  Akhenaten ,the lord of the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom...

555
00:32:21,235 --> 00:32:23,548
... King Tutankhamun.

556
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:26,745
- Otherwise known as King Tut.
- My boyfriend.

557
00:32:26,746 --> 00:32:29,533
King Tut is your boyfriend?

558
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:32,394
-uhuum
-would you like me to have them skinned, covered with honey,

559
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:35,025
… And layed in a pit of fire ants?

560
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:36,608
  you do that for me?

561
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:40,287
Anything, my Desert Flower.
Consider it a wedding gift.

562
00:32:40,347 --> 00:32:43,751
- What? You can’t marry this guy?
- Why not?

563
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:46,636
Well for one , his name rhymes with
'butt'.

564
00:32:46,637 --> 00:32:47,376
I do not care.

565
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:49,847
I’m gonna have a big, fat
Egyptian wedding.

566
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:52,249
Spoiler alert:
king tut dies young.

567
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,165
Are you sure   you‘ve thought this through?

568
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,502
Oh trust me, I thought it through.
I’m getting everything.

569
00:32:56,503 --> 00:33:00,875
The royal astronomy had decreed.
Your wedding must take place tomorrow.

570
00:33:00,876 --> 00:33:01,945
At Dawn.

571
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,611
- Who is he?
- He is Ay.

572
00:33:03,612 --> 00:33:04,471
He is you?

573
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:06,823
I am Ay, the Grand Vizier.

574
00:33:06,824 --> 00:33:09,072
Yeah , that’s his name.

575
00:33:09,073 --> 00:33:12,835
Oh grand Vizier   , would you mind telling
The precious Princess   here...

576
00:33:12,836 --> 00:33:15,237
...  precisely what it means to be married
the young pharaoh?

577
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:16,320
Gladly.

578
00:33:16,355 --> 00:33:19,779
It Means she will be bound to him in eternity.

579
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,857
Through these
sacred ceremonies of disembowelment...

580
00:33:22,858 --> 00:33:24,630
... and mummification.

581
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:27,268
As described in the Holy text.

582
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,570
Uh , hold up a second.
Can you walk me through that , somebody?

583
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:31,632
What he means, Penny,

584
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:33,628
Is that when I die,
they kill you,too.

585
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:36,611
And then they rip out your organs,
Stuff them in canopic jars...

586
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:38,394
... and the mummify what ever’s left.

587
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:39,531
Ok , I’m seeing this  now.

588
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:40,632
Thank you.

589
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,645
I’m gonna Go with them.

590
00:33:42,852 --> 00:33:45,551
There's no turning back, now!

591
00:33:45,552 --> 00:33:46,649
To the Palace!

592
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:49,110
Let the wedding preparations begin!

593
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:52,257
Mr. Peabody! Sherman!
Do something!

594
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:55,635
Do not worry, Penny,
we'll save you!

595
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:02,106
Hey ,Wait !
You can’t just...

596
00:34:02,635 --> 00:34:04,030
... leave us here.

597
00:34:04,734 --> 00:34:07,239
- Mr. Peabody?
- Yes, Sherman?

598
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:08,628
Can I Hold Your Hand?

599
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,551
Of course you can.

600
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:12,820
boy. Your hand’s cold,
Mr. Peabody.

601
00:34:12,821 --> 00:34:14,803
- Sherman? 
- Yeah?

602
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:18,079
That’s not my hand.

603
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:25,115
That’s  disarming.

604
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:28,495
Now, to find the way out of here
...

605
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:30,923
Look around  , Sherman.

606
00:34:30,924 --> 00:34:33,701
These tombs are lined with hieroglyphics design...

607
00:34:33,702 --> 00:34:35,615
... To assist the Pharaoh ‘s souls...

608
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,668
... in their journey toward the eternal life.

609
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:40,804
And they may assist us as well.

610
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:44,330
This the pics the god of  Anubis,

611
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:46,450
Sailing the boat of Ra
To the underworld.

612
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:50,025
It appears the boats of 
 Ra are the key to our escape.

613
00:34:50,026 --> 00:34:52,352
We must find them in time
to stop the wedding.

614
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:55,211
If you ask me, we should let her
 marry that guy.

615
00:34:55,212 --> 00:34:56,524
They deserve each other.

616
00:34:56,525 --> 00:34:58,055
What’s that Sherman?

617
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:59,758
Tut, give me a break.

618
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:03,069
Bald, wears a skirt and makeup?

619
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,625
If I did not any better, Sherman,
I would say that you're jealous.

620
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:07,392
jealous?
Of what?

621
00:35:07,393 --> 00:35:09,473
Tut’s affection for Penny,
Of  course.

622
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,532
you think I like Penny?

623
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:13,830
Give me a break.

624
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:16,981
It‘s not like I want to ….. hold her hand...

625
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:18,943
... or go to the park  ...

626
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:21,477
... or watch her while she’s brushing her hair...

627
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:26,451
. .. or anything...

628
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:34,065
Quickly, Sherman.

629
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:41,871
careful, Sherman.
It’s a booby trap.

630
00:35:42,802 --> 00:35:45,514
- What's so funny?
- You said booby.

631
00:35:47,577 --> 00:35:50,910
One wrong step and we are done forever.

632
00:35:51,885 --> 00:35:53,230
The boat...

633
00:35:53,265 --> 00:35:54,641
... of  Ra...

634
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:55,983
... sails straight...

635
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,122
... to day.

636
00:35:57,157 --> 00:36:00,094
Take-the –wrong - boat...

637
00:36:00,095 --> 00:36:02,260
... man-will pay.

638
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,016
alright, Sherman,
Now it's your turn.

639
00:36:04,017 --> 00:36:06,761
Do the puzzle exactly as I did.

640
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:09,738
Think it through.
One step at a time.

641
00:36:17,435 --> 00:36:18,878
... I mean, ‘pay’.

642
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:20,315
Oh my...

643
00:36:33,964 --> 00:36:35,308
The boats of the Ra.

644
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:36,622
One boat is the way out...

645
00:36:36,623 --> 00:36:39,226
...  the other will send us
Wandering into darkness and in certain death.

646
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:40,219
What?

647
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,861
Sherman, get on the boat.

648
00:36:41,862 --> 00:36:44,954
As soon as I move these blocks together,
It’s going to move very fast.

649
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:47,560
- Which boat, Mr. Peabody?
- What?

650
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:50,004
What is I’m not certain that’s wrong boat ?

651
00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:51,271
That one!

652
00:37:04,716 --> 00:37:07,311
We did it, Sherman!
Sherman?

653
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:08,959
Mr. Peabody!

654
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:10,636
What are you doing over there?

655
00:37:10,637 --> 00:37:13,161
I thought you pointed at this one.

656
00:37:38,485 --> 00:37:39,522
Sherman?

657
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,805
Sherman!

658
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,053
Are you alright?

659
00:37:42,822 --> 00:37:44,118
I'm good.

660
00:37:57,506 --> 00:38:01,401
The sun god Ra,
commands us to begin...

661
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:04,139
... the sacred ceremony!

662
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,557
Bring forth the plate
for the blood oath!

663
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:27,200
Where   blade meets flesh,
in the sacred right  ...

664
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:33,355
... we pay tribute
To the sun God, Ra.

665
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,966
Wait!

666
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:39,406
The Anubis, the god of Death!

667
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:41,503
The wedding must not continue!

668
00:38:41,504 --> 00:38:43,523
Why, Anubis, why?

669
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:46,105
plagues! Flames!

670
00:38:46,473 --> 00:38:48,909
If this marriage packed in sealed …..

671
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,503
... I will shower down upon the land,
uncountable plagues.

672
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:54,419
Why again with the plagues?

673
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,385
What did I ever move to Egypt?

674
00:38:56,386 --> 00:38:59,999
but, Anubis, the sun god, Ra,
has declare...

675
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,787
... that this girl is to be the 
Boy –king‘s wife.

676
00:39:02,788 --> 00:39:04,421
That’s so funny.

677
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:07,741
I was talking to the sun god Ra just the other day...

678
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:10,348
... and he told me he changed his mind.

679
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,550
really?

680
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:15,501
Oh , the flip flap Ra we call it , here in the underworld.

681
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:17,082
But it's too late.

682
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:19,414
We have already paid for the catering.

683
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:24,652
Too bad you’re going to lose your deposit.

684
00:39:26,386 --> 00:39:29,811
  one smoke, Sherman.
This trick is  working.

685
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:32,764
deliver the girl to the gates of the city...

686
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:36,536
... And leave her there,
 where the gods will retrieve her  forth with.

687
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:39,436
Only in this manner,

688
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:42,983
May the plagues upon this land   be avoided.

689
00:39:43,676 --> 00:39:47,751
Anubis  has spoken.

690
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:50,369
Take this girl
to the gates!

691
00:39:56,815 --> 00:40:00,177
Anubis, you sound unwell.

692
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:04,666
Well I am   feeling a little under the weather,
but I'm feeling much better now.

693
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:07,467
Thank you.

694
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,016
Penny, Sherman quickly.

695
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,441
- Come on, Penny!
- Sherman!

696
00:40:27,864 --> 00:40:29,149
Runaway bride!

697
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,530
Stop, them you fools!

698
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,102
Penny Sherman, climb  on board!

699
00:41:03,614 --> 00:41:05,584
They are Getting away!

700
00:41:26,124 --> 00:41:26,746
We made it!

701
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:28,405
Where do we go next,
Mr. Peabody?

702
00:41:28,406 --> 00:41:29,961
home. We have to get back to the dinner party...

703
00:41:29,962 --> 00:41:32,840
... Before Penny’s parents 
Realize she’s missing.

704
00:41:32,841 --> 00:41:35,074
We don’t have to mention the whole...

705
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,353
... King Tut wedding thing , right?

706
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:38,361
certainly not.

707
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,028
anyway, as far as I’m concerned...

708
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:42,287
... they get married too young
in Ancient Egypt.

709
00:41:42,288 --> 00:41:45,431
Or... perhaps I’m just some old Giza.

710
00:41:49,397 --> 00:41:50,409
Warning:

711
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:53,133
WABAC power supply Insufficient.

712
00:41:53,134 --> 00:41:54,548
Charge now.

713
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:57,175
What's the matter, Mr. Peabody?

714
00:41:57,176 --> 00:41:59,000
All this zipping about the cosmos ...

715
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:00,420
... is trimmed our power supply.

716
00:42:00,421 --> 00:42:02,449
We are going up to make an unscheduled stop.

717
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,939
As luck we have it...

718
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,986
... we have just enough power to make 
to the Renaissance.

719
00:42:12,457 --> 00:42:15,760
<b> Florence, Italy-1508 </ b>

720
00:42:18,856 --> 00:42:20,935
I can’t even tell to my left brain...

721
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:22,469
... command the right , anymore!

722
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,603
How many times I gotta   tell you,
Mona Lisa...

723
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:25,632
Mona Lisa?

724
00:42:25,905 --> 00:42:27,537
No, no, no!

725
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:29,379
I cannot paint...

726
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,574
... until you smile!

727
00:42:30,575 --> 00:42:34,034
Leonardo, tell me one thing,
I have to smile about!

728
00:42:34,035 --> 00:42:35,914
The sunshine, the pasta...

729
00:42:35,915 --> 00:42:39,822
... all the things that make Italy such popular destination!

730
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,174
But , I have not seen any of them Leonardo...

731
00:42:42,175 --> 00:42:44,757
... because I’m sitting here all day on my abbondanza!

732
00:42:46,745 --> 00:42:49,586
I do not think that means
'chair' in Italian.

733
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:53,470
Peabody, my old friend!

734
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:55,999
What a welcome interruption!

735
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,605
Believe you me , This woman is make me nuts

736
00:42:59,606 --> 00:43:03,541
So, are you banned? Good to see you.
What do you want?

737
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:05,274
We’re in a desperate hurry to go home...

738
00:43:05,275 --> 00:43:07,572
... but the WABAC 
needs a jump start...

739
00:43:07,573 --> 00:43:08,476
... and we thought...

740
00:43:08,477 --> 00:43:10,620
... who better than,
Leonardo Da Vinci...

741
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:11,965
... to help us on the way.

742
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:14,397
Peabody I would love to help you...

743
00:43:14,398 --> 00:43:16,760
... but you come in a very bad time.

744
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:20,765
I do not know what I’m going to do,
with this crazy woman.

745
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:22,503
You see what I mean?

746
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:23,781
What is the problem?

747
00:43:23,782 --> 00:43:24,990
What is the problem?

748
00:43:24,991 --> 00:43:28,093
I am half way done with the painting. She won't even smile!

749
00:43:28,094 --> 00:43:31,104
Fine. I smile.

750
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:33,970
No!

751
00:43:34,005 --> 00:43:35,652
That’s a fake smile!

752
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:37,231
Everybody knows that.

753
00:43:37,232 --> 00:43:39,646
Why don’t you make a real smile?

754
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,306
Why do not you say something funny?

755
00:43:41,307 --> 00:43:45,014
I paint the paintings,
I make the machines...

756
00:43:45,015 --> 00:43:47,486
... I don’t tell the jokes!

757
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:49,889
Perhaps I can be of assistance.

758
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:52,798
You see, humor is not immune
To loss of science.

759
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:54,684
Using algorithms, we can extrapolate...

760
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:56,729
... but is universally considered funny.

761
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,307
Thus producing a formula ...

762
00:43:58,308 --> 00:44:01,296
... that is scientifically certain to cause laughter.

763
00:44:01,297 --> 00:44:04,238
Case in point, the pratfall.

764
00:44:09,586 --> 00:44:11,557
Is everyone amused?

765
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:17,372
The data was so clear...

766
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:18,798
Do not worry, Mr. Peabody,
I got it!

767
00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:20,057
No, no, Sherman...

768
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:37,199
Perfect!
hold that smile!

769
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,312
Hold it right there!
Do not move! Don’t move!

770
00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:49,793
Well, Leo, if my calculations are correct...

771
00:44:49,794 --> 00:44:52,947
... This mean an hour should generate
enough centripetal force to send us home.

772
00:44:52,948 --> 00:44:56,011
I’ve got a one last piece to got to pound   in place.

773
00:44:56,012 --> 00:44:59,306
Sherman, why don’t you fetch the hammer
for Mr. Da Vinci?

774
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:01,645
Okay, Mr. Peabody.

775
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:08,555
- Mr. Peabody?
- well-done, Sherman.

776
00:45:08,556 --> 00:45:10,124
But Mr. Peabody...!

777
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:12,341
Very helpful.

778
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:26,958
Sherman!

779
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:29,278
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

780
00:45:29,876 --> 00:45:33,274
The Hammer...Da Vinci

781
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,468
Oh ,Okay, Mr. Peabody.

782
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:40,409
Here you go, Mr. Da Vinci.

783
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,625
Do you need any Help?

784
00:45:41,626 --> 00:45:45,088
No, no, that’s quite alright.
Thank you.

785
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:47,111
Sherman!

786
00:45:47,404 --> 00:45:49,863
Let’s Go.
Let's go explore.

787
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:54,382
Uh , well I’m Supposed to be having
 father-son time, with Mr. Peabody.

788
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:57,209
Would not you rather have fun with me?

789
00:45:58,036 --> 00:45:59,117
okey.

790
00:45:59,152 --> 00:46:00,959
Sherman!
Where are you going?

791
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,698
Exploring.

792
00:46:02,906 --> 00:46:05,008
- But we need your help.
- No, we don’t.

793
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,471
I mean, we can manage,
somehow.

794
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:10,028
He’s a boy, Peabody.

795
00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:12,664
Let him have some fun.
Let him go.

796
00:46:12,665 --> 00:46:15,165
Thanks, Mr. Peabody.

797
00:46:17,793 --> 00:46:20,542
He’s growing up, Peabody.

798
00:46:20,543 --> 00:46:23,668
Like a baby bird,
leaving the nest.

799
00:46:23,705 --> 00:46:26,579
Isn’t it wonderful?

800
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:35,819
It's like a museum.

801
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:38,812
It's like toy store.

802
00:46:48,862 --> 00:46:50,172
Check this one.

803
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:53,194
It is the world biggest model airplane.

804
00:46:53,195 --> 00:46:56,275
It’s not a model, Penny,
It’s the prototype.

805
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,057
And we should
probably just   leave that alone.

806
00:46:59,058 --> 00:46:59,944
OK.

807
00:46:59,979 --> 00:47:02,085
But wouldn’t it be cool if
We could fly it?

808
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:04,105
I don’t think Mr. Peabody would like that.

809
00:47:04,106 --> 00:47:06,153
Well, Mr. Peabody isn’t here.

810
00:47:06,154 --> 00:47:08,328
Just tell me how it works.

811
00:47:08,395 --> 00:47:09,609
Please!

812
00:47:09,644 --> 00:47:10,823
for learning.

813
00:47:11,424 --> 00:47:12,510
Uh ,Okay.

814
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:16,419
The force come from this kind of board...

815
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,732
... then it shoots along the track...

816
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:20,700
... until wind catches the wings.

817
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:22,543
But how does it go?

818
00:47:22,544 --> 00:47:24,599
How do you takeoff?

819
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,009
You just pull down that lever.

820
00:47:27,946 --> 00:47:29,325
This one?

821
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,705
Oh boy.

822
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:40,652
This is crazy!

823
00:47:40,951 --> 00:47:43,221
No , it’s not Sherman.
It's fun!

824
00:47:43,222 --> 00:47:44,648
I’m gonna Die!

825
00:47:44,952 --> 00:47:47,728
o stop being such a giant.

826
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,060
Nothing is as beautiful ...

827
00:47:56,061 --> 00:47:59,936
... as an elegant equation,
translated into perfect engineering.

828
00:47:59,937 --> 00:48:02,541
Why can’t children be
so simple?

829
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:05,310
Because children are not machines,
Peabody.

830
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:08,578
believe me .
I tried to build one.

831
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:10,451
Oh , It was creepy.

832
00:48:13,145 --> 00:48:15,140
Here, Sherman.
You fly it.

833
00:48:15,141 --> 00:48:16,354
But I do wanna fly.

834
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:18,481
Sure you do.
It’ll be fun!

835
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:21,251
No seriously, Penny, I don’t want to.

836
00:48:21,252 --> 00:48:22,870
I ‘m letting go.

837
00:48:22,905 --> 00:48:24,431
- One... two...
- Don’t let go!

838
00:48:24,432 --> 00:48:27,409
- No!
-... Three!

839
00:48:29,835 --> 00:48:31,508
Penny, fly the plane!

840
00:48:31,761 --> 00:48:34,406
No, Sherman,
you now have to save us.

841
00:48:34,407 --> 00:48:35,712
But I can’t do it.

842
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:38,406
I'm Serious, Penny.
I don’t know how to fly!

843
00:48:38,407 --> 00:48:40,521
You can do it.
I know you can.

844
00:48:40,522 --> 00:48:43,621
Come on, Sherman.
fly.

845
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:11,773
See? You got it, Sherman

846
00:49:11,774 --> 00:49:14,407
You're right.
I have got it!

847
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:24,130
Mama mia!
The Da Vinci sailed again.

848
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:27,458
Yes, but I see that the child he made.
So creepy.

849
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:29,524
Papa. Mama.

850
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:00,075
I‘ll down up here, Leonardo.

851
00:50:00,076 --> 00:50:02,170
And I'm whole done down here.

852
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:04,344
It is beautiful, isn’t it?

853
00:50:04,345 --> 00:50:05,630
every piece in its place...

854
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:08,601
... doing precisely what it suppose to do.

855
00:50:08,613 --> 00:50:12,390
Ey , Look, Peabody!
It’s my flying machine!

856
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:13,776
My flying machine!

857
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,836
Sherman? Sherman!

858
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,377
Sherman, what are you doing up there?

859
00:50:18,378 --> 00:50:19,985
I'm flying!

860
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:22,682
But Sherman you don’t know how to fly!

861
00:50:22,683 --> 00:50:25,084
- I don’t?
- No.

862
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:35,718
Turn. Turn, Sherman.
Lean! Lean!

863
00:50:49,775 --> 00:50:53,178
Sherman! Sherman!
Are you okay?

864
00:50:53,191 --> 00:50:55,681
That was pretty fantastic!

865
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:59,240
I can’t believe it!

866
00:50:59,937 --> 00:51:02,650
My flying machine it worked!

867
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,144
Sherman, you're the first
flying man!

868
00:51:06,145 --> 00:51:09,062
You should be very proud,
Peabody!

869
00:51:09,063 --> 00:51:10,877
Very very proud.

870
00:51:10,878 --> 00:51:13,431
“proud” doesn’t begin to describe it.

871
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:18,187
Leonardo, will you please fire up the mechanism?

872
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,638
papa, mama!

873
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:41,420
Mona!

874
00:51:43,068 --> 00:51:45,264
papa, mama!

875
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:14,240
I'm sorry I broke the plane, Mr. Peabody.

876
00:52:14,241 --> 00:52:15,620
Well, you Should be.

877
00:52:15,621 --> 00:52:16,885
You could have been killed.

878
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:19,969
What are you talking about?
Sherman flew a plane.

879
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,432
He was amazing!

880
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:24,975
Sherman destroyed a priceless historical artifact.

881
00:52:24,992 --> 00:52:27,424
Whatever.
You should be happy.

882
00:52:27,425 --> 00:52:29,916
It turns out that
Sherman is not a complete and total loser after all.

883
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,033
Yes, Mr. Peabody.

884
00:52:31,034 --> 00:52:34,813
Turns out that I'm not a complete and total loser after all.

885
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,815
Miss Peterson...

886
00:52:36,816 --> 00:52:39,496
... Stop turning my son
Into a hooligan.

887
00:52:39,497 --> 00:52:41,286
It’s not my fault he is a hooligan.

888
00:52:41,287 --> 00:52:43,790
Yeah. It’s not her fault I'm a hooligan.

889
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:45,187
Well it’s certainly not my fault.

890
00:52:45,188 --> 00:52:46,515
I spent the last 7 years...

891
00:52:46,516 --> 00:52:48,352
... teaching  Sherman good judgment.

892
00:52:48,353 --> 00:52:49,538
If you are such a great parent,

893
00:52:49,539 --> 00:52:53,198
why is Miss Grunion trying to take Sherman away from you?

894
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:56,572
Is that true?

895
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,637
Is somebody gonna take me away from you?

896
00:52:58,638 --> 00:53:01,198
No, Sherman.
I’ll never let that happen.

897
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:03,432
You just need to trust me.

898
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:05,817
Oh dear, a Black Hole!

899
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:12,521
What’s happening?

900
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,118
If I cannot pull us out of here
...

901
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:17,855
... we are going to be smashed
to smithereens on the horizon.

902
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:25,189
There’s not enough power to resist the gravitational pole.

903
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:27,147
I've got to burn everything...

904
00:53:27,796 --> 00:53:29,130
Why didn’t you tell me?

905
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:30,139
Tell you what?

906
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:33,195
Why didn’t you tell me that Miss Grunion
was trying to take me away from you?

907
00:53:33,196 --> 00:53:35,401
It’s not your job to worry about these things.

908
00:53:35,402 --> 00:53:37,403
You just didn’t think I could handle it...

909
00:53:37,404 --> 00:53:39,371
We will discuss later.
Now sit down.

910
00:53:39,372 --> 00:53:41,827
I do not want to discuss it later!

911
00:53:41,828 --> 00:53:43,153
Sherman, sit.

912
00:53:43,188 --> 00:53:45,267
You can’t talk to me Like that.

913
00:53:45,268 --> 00:53:46,682
I'm not a dog.

914
00:53:46,683 --> 00:53:47,853
What did you say?

915
00:53:47,888 --> 00:53:50,945
I said I'm not dog!

916
00:53:50,946 --> 00:53:53,437
You're right, Sherman,
you're not.

917
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:56,161
you're Just a very bad boy.

918
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:02,234
T minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

919
00:54:02,269 --> 00:54:08,342
... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

920
00:54:22,547 --> 00:54:25,346
Sherman? Penny?

921
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:28,168
Sherman, are you okay?

922
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,364
Sherman?

923
00:54:39,324 --> 00:54:40,863
He’s Gone.

924
00:54:41,246 --> 00:54:43,012
Where are we, anyway?

925
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:45,931
Oh ,No.

926
00:54:46,204 --> 00:54:49,869
We are on the brink
one of the most brutal conflicts in history.

927
00:54:52,647 --> 00:54:56,755
<b> Trojan War-1184 BC </ b>

928
00:55:14,206 --> 00:55:16,874
How are we doing heroes of Greece?

929
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:20,461
Feel good?
Feel strong?

930
00:55:21,268 --> 00:55:22,799
Okay, let's get warmed up,

931
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,970
if we are to succeed
something out there.

932
00:55:24,971 --> 00:55:29,684
Remember what happened to Achilles,
and whole thing with his heel.

933
00:55:30,856 --> 00:55:32,550
You look fine, Diomedes.

934
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:35,184
Menelaus, my man!

935
00:55:35,192 --> 00:55:36,274
my man.

936
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:38,745
Are you ready to get on the field ,
Shermanous?

937
00:55:38,746 --> 00:55:41,955
Sure thing, Mr. Agamemnon!

938
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:43,665
That’s cute.

939
00:55:48,474 --> 00:55:51,843
Odysseus, what news do you bring?

940
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,546
Someone left this for us.

941
00:55:53,547 --> 00:55:55,112
A present, nice!

942
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:58,058
It looks just like our horse.

943
00:55:58,641 --> 00:56:00,786
Should I bring it inside?

944
00:56:01,709 --> 00:56:03,689
I’d be rude not to.

945
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:10,894
I did not see that coming.

946
00:56:11,522 --> 00:56:14,900
Jeez louise!
What is that smell?

947
00:56:17,097 --> 00:56:19,903
Ohh-huh This is the smell of victory!

948
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:23,817
Greetings , men of Athens,
Sparta and Thebes.

949
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:27,143
Peabody here.
I‘ve come for Sherman.

950
00:56:27,144 --> 00:56:28,146
Do you know this guy?

951
00:56:28,147 --> 00:56:30,616
I thought I did,
but now I’m not so sure.

952
00:56:30,617 --> 00:56:33,318
They must be spy.
Kill him!

953
00:56:33,547 --> 00:56:35,487
No, no!

954
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,998
He is... my dad.

955
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:39,295
Your dad?

956
00:56:39,513 --> 00:56:41,566
It’s an adoptive relationship.

957
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:47,137
Thank you
For taking such good care of my son, Agamemnon...

958
00:56:47,138 --> 00:56:49,540
... But it's time for him to come home.

959
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:51,903
Sorry, Mr. Peabody,
I‘ve joined the Greek army.

960
00:56:51,904 --> 00:56:53,468
The Shermanous is one of us now.

961
00:56:53,469 --> 00:56:54,999
- He's a brother.
- I’m his brother.

962
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,027
He’s my son!

963
00:56:56,028 --> 00:56:57,670
- He took an oath!
- I took an oath.

964
00:56:57,671 --> 00:56:58,862
He’s seven!

965
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:00,635
…and a half!

966
00:57:00,848 --> 00:57:04,838
All sons must prove
themselves to their fathers.

967
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:09,326
Today,
Shermanous will prove himself on the field of battle.

968
00:57:09,327 --> 00:57:10,656
But he’s only a child.

969
00:57:10,919 --> 00:57:12,125
Your dad may not think …

970
00:57:12,126 --> 00:57:14,190
you're ready to become a man,
Shermanous...

971
00:57:14,191 --> 00:57:15,943
... but we do.

972
00:57:15,944 --> 00:57:17,224
Yes, Mr. Peabody.

973
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,011
Now
I will show you what I can handle.

974
00:57:19,012 --> 00:57:20,635
FYI...

975
00:57:20,636 --> 00:57:21,910
... alot of heroes have father issues.

976
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:24,695
My old man is a Minotaur.
Half man-half bull.

977
00:57:24,696 --> 00:57:26,209
All judgment.

978
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:28,531
Ajax here,
is the strongest guy in the world...

979
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:30,035
... but his father never accepted...

980
00:57:30,036 --> 00:57:32,508
... that his real dream was to sing.

981
00:57:32,509 --> 00:57:34,106
I wanted to be in the Greek chorus.

982
00:57:34,107 --> 00:57:36,524
And don’t even get me distorted about Oedipus.

983
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:37,403
Let’s just say that,

984
00:57:37,438 --> 00:57:40,450
You do not want to be in his house over the holidays.

985
00:57:40,451 --> 00:57:41,831
It’s awkward.

986
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,143
Sherman,
I’m concerned you haven’t thought this through.

987
00:57:44,144 --> 00:57:45,215
this is a war.

988
00:57:45,216 --> 00:57:47,206
Do you realize what about to happen?

989
00:57:47,207 --> 00:57:49,319
I'll tell you what's going to happen.

990
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,663
We’re gonna destroy their houses...

991
00:57:51,694 --> 00:57:52,993
... pull down their temples...

992
00:57:52,994 --> 00:57:55,356
... And makes the streets of the city
One red!

993
00:57:55,357 --> 00:57:58,643
With Trojan blood!

994
00:57:58,678 --> 00:58:00,102
Yeah!

995
00:58:00,137 --> 00:58:03,446
Blood, blood, blood!

996
00:58:13,416 --> 00:58:15,019
Zeus on 3!
one...

997
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,688
Sherman,
I absolutely forbid you to fight in the Trojan War.

998
00:58:17,689 --> 00:58:20,633
That’s not fair!
All my friends are fighting in the Trojan War.

999
00:58:20,634 --> 00:58:21,551
two...

1000
00:58:21,586 --> 00:58:23,764
- Sherman it‘s dangerous!
- I’ wearing a helmet.

1001
00:58:23,765 --> 00:58:25,064
-three!
- You’re not going!

1002
00:58:25,065 --> 00:58:26,671
Oh , yes. I am.

1003
00:58:26,706 --> 00:58:28,277
Zeus!

1004
00:58:33,435 --> 00:58:37,105
Eat my bronze,
You Trojan dogs!

1005
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:41,890
Eat my bronze,
You Trojan dogs!

1006
00:58:54,124 --> 00:58:55,658
Well , that’s cutting it close.

1007
00:58:57,718 --> 00:59:00,638
This is why I ask you to obey me,
Sherman.

1008
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,879
Because I'm your father.

1009
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,704
And it’s my job to keep you safe.

1010
00:59:06,605 --> 00:59:09,852
But Are you sure Miss Grunion, will take me away?

1011
00:59:11,116 --> 00:59:13,679
Not as long as I’m around.

1012
00:59:25,654 --> 00:59:28,382
Mr. Peabody, help me!

1013
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:29,735
Penny!

1014
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:40,627
Smell my victory!
Smell it!

1015
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:43,909
That's my ride!

1016
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,570
Mr. Peabody hurry!

1017
00:59:55,273 --> 00:59:56,522
I'll take that.

1018
01:00:44,462 --> 01:00:46,010
You did it, Sherman!

1019
01:00:46,011 --> 01:00:47,424
Mr. Peabody helped.

1020
01:00:47,425 --> 01:00:49,142
Now, let's get
To the WABAC  ...

1021
01:00:49,143 --> 01:00:50,458
... go home , unhypnotise Penny’s parents...

1022
01:00:50,459 --> 01:00:52,414
... Finish that dinner party
Eat my baked alaska...

1023
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:53,788
... charm the pants off Miss Grunion...

1024
01:00:53,789 --> 01:00:56,122
... and make sure none of 
This ever happens in the place.

1025
01:00:56,123 --> 01:00:57,309
Sounds good.

1026
01:00:57,869 --> 01:00:59,016
I ‘m in.

1027
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:03,650
Sherman !

1028
01:01:04,514 --> 01:01:05,189
Penny!

1029
01:01:05,224 --> 01:01:06,991
Sherman, no!

1030
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:26,695
Mr. Peabody...

1031
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:29,011
Mr. Peabody?

1032
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:32,257
Mr. Peabody!

1033
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,611
Dad!

1034
01:01:49,045 --> 01:01:53,003
Oh , Mr. Peabody, what should I do?
What should I do?

1035
01:01:56,009 --> 01:01:58,732
There is nothing you can do, Sherman.

1036
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:03,705
I just want to go home...

1037
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:06,852
Home?

1038
01:02:08,002 --> 01:02:09,352
That’s it!

1039
01:02:09,923 --> 01:02:11,448
I‘ve got an idea.

1040
01:02:11,957 --> 01:02:13,154
Come on!

1041
01:02:15,219 --> 01:02:16,569
Where we gonna go?

1042
01:02:16,604 --> 01:02:17,884
We’re going  home.

1043
01:02:17,919 --> 01:02:19,840
There’s
only one person who can help us...

1044
01:02:19,841 --> 01:02:21,839
... and that’s Mr. Peabody.

1045
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,703
What are you talking about?
This is not possible.

1046
01:02:23,704 --> 01:02:25,498
We’ve got a Time Machine,
Penny.

1047
01:02:25,499 --> 01:02:27,437
I can set it so that
We get home...

1048
01:02:27,438 --> 01:02:29,307
... when Mr. Peabody is still there.

1049
01:02:29,308 --> 01:02:32,398
But I thought you’re not suppose
to go back to a time when you existed.

1050
01:02:32,399 --> 01:02:34,412
What choice do we have?

1051
01:02:34,775 --> 01:02:35,973
ERROR

1052
01:02:36,008 --> 01:02:39,218
You are attempting to travel to an era in which you exist.

1053
01:02:39,219 --> 01:02:42,320
This could alter the fabric of space-time.

1054
01:02:42,321 --> 01:02:43,956
ERROR

1055
01:02:46,491 --> 01:02:47,459
Hang on!

1056
01:03:00,266 --> 01:03:03,275
This is a little home-spun concoction
I’d like to call:

1057
01:03:04,242 --> 01:03:06,919
" Einstein on the beach".

1058
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:12,727
- To the kids.
- To the kids!

1059
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:15,251
Mr. Peabody!

1060
01:03:15,286 --> 01:03:16,839
Sherman? Penny?

1061
01:03:16,874 --> 01:03:18,710
Can we talk to you a second?

1062
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,704
Of Course.
Excuse me.

1063
01:03:23,253 --> 01:03:25,000
I’ve really hit it off with your parents.

1064
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,432
I think we can file this night under

1065
01:03:26,433 --> 01:03:28,466
"unqualified success".

1066
01:03:28,467 --> 01:03:32,004
- I’d hold off filing it just yet.
- What do you mean?

1067
01:03:32,005 --> 01:03:34,034
Why are you dressed like ancient...

1068
01:03:34,035 --> 01:03:35,960
... Greeks?
You use the WABAC!

1069
01:03:35,961 --> 01:03:37,851
I did.
I know it's terrible.

1070
01:03:37,852 --> 01:03:38,850
But why?

1071
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:40,904
Penny and I got into an argument about
George Washington.

1072
01:03:40,905 --> 01:03:42,889
So I made him show me
the WABAC.

1073
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:44,172
And I lost her in Ancient Egypt.

1074
01:03:44,173 --> 01:03:45,402
And got engaged King TuT.

1075
01:03:45,403 --> 01:03:46,597
So I came back and got you.

1076
01:03:46,598 --> 01:03:47,453
We ran out of gas.

1077
01:03:47,454 --> 01:03:48,186
In Florence.

1078
01:03:48,221 --> 01:03:49,086
And went into a black hole.

1079
01:03:49,087 --> 01:03:50,723
And then you died in Ancient Troy.

1080
01:03:50,724 --> 01:03:51,586
Died?

1081
01:03:51,621 --> 01:03:52,946
I have a hard believing that.

1082
01:03:52,947 --> 01:03:53,890
It’s True!

1083
01:03:53,925 --> 01:03:56,152
But now you're here,
and everything’s gonna be ok!

1084
01:03:56,153 --> 01:03:58,908
I told you never to
Come back to a time when you existed...

1085
01:03:58,909 --> 01:04:00,287
... because there will be two of you.

1086
01:04:00,288 --> 01:04:03,273
Yes, but the other  one of me
is in Ancient Egypt.

1087
01:04:07,704 --> 01:04:08,772
Who are you?

1088
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:10,608
He’s you, but from another timeline.

1089
01:04:10,609 --> 01:04:13,814
But I thought you said, 
never to come back to a time when you existed.

1090
01:04:13,815 --> 01:04:15,135
Exactly!

1091
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:17,889
I know, I know.
But what was I supposed to do?

1092
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:20,289
Mr. Peabody died
 In Ancient Troy.

1093
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,654
Died?
I have a hard time believing that.

1094
01:04:22,655 --> 01:04:23,926
Thank you!

1095
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:25,162
What are we going to do?

1096
01:04:25,197 --> 01:04:27,862
well, for starter , both Sherman can’t stay here. 

1097
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:29,242
Why? We can bump it!

1098
01:04:29,243 --> 01:04:30,453
or think at the same thing!

1099
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:32,463
That’s so weird. It’s like we are twins.

1100
01:04:32,464 --> 01:04:34,647
I was thinking that too.

1101
01:04:34,648 --> 01:04:35,392
see?!

1102
01:04:35,427 --> 01:04:37,536
We can’t have two Shermans
 In the same timeline.

1103
01:04:37,537 --> 01:04:40,624
it put too much strength on the space time continuum.

1104
01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:42,539
What to do?
What to do...

1105
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,866
The Peterson
Can’t know  any of this.

1106
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:47,960
- Hey, Peabody!
- Hey!

1107
01:04:47,961 --> 01:04:48,944
How's it going?

1108
01:04:48,979 --> 01:04:51,715
Paddy and I are working on our appetite.

1109
01:04:51,716 --> 01:04:54,508
What the
smells coming from your kitchen are yummy!

1110
01:04:54,509 --> 01:04:56,665
Especially  that baked alaska!

1111
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,527
Yeah... So, what's going on here?

1112
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:00,355
Yes, what are these cloaks?

1113
01:05:00,356 --> 01:05:02,622
Toga party!

1114
01:05:02,694 --> 01:05:04,063
Toga party?

1115
01:05:04,064 --> 01:05:07,464
Yes, it is a toga party!

1116
01:05:07,465 --> 01:05:09,397
But what about dinner?
I’m Starving.

1117
01:05:09,398 --> 01:05:11,260
Why not go to the dining room...

1118
01:05:11,261 --> 01:05:13,305
... and talking those quails
You’ve been talking about?

1119
01:05:13,306 --> 01:05:14,928
- No!
- Why not?

1120
01:05:14,929 --> 01:05:18,938
Because... it's so fun right here.

1121
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:29,621
Miss Grunion !

1122
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:32,232
How delightful!

1123
01:05:32,233 --> 01:05:34,615
We were having such a good time,
I almost forgot you’re coming.

1124
01:05:34,616 --> 01:05:36,551
Why don’t you join the party?

1125
01:05:36,552 --> 01:05:38,241
Stop , I’m not here for a party!

1126
01:05:38,242 --> 01:05:40,131
I’m here for the investigation.

1127
01:05:40,132 --> 01:05:43,668
good! Why don’t you start investigating
over  here?

1128
01:05:43,669 --> 01:05:46,804
Or here... or here... or here...

1129
01:05:46,805 --> 01:05:49,702
stop waving your hands around!

1130
01:05:51,234 --> 01:05:52,211
Sherman?

1131
01:05:52,246 --> 01:05:54,092
Wait!
Is that...

1132
01:05:54,093 --> 01:05:55,383
-... Sherman!

1133
01:05:55,418 --> 01:06:00,146
duo  Shermanous?
What is going on here, Peabody?

1134
01:06:02,595 --> 01:06:03,988
Nobody move!

1135
01:06:03,989 --> 01:06:05,970
Sherman, I’ve got to get you out of here...

1136
01:06:05,971 --> 01:06:08,292
... before you touch yourself.

1137
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:11,595
Mr. Peabody, you didn’t die!

1138
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:14,819
- Of course I didn’t!
- Thank you!

1139
01:06:14,941 --> 01:06:16,950
How did you get back?

1140
01:06:16,951 --> 01:06:18,320
After a few failed experiments...

1141
01:06:18,321 --> 01:06:20,708
... I had  upon a combination of bone, stone and
Yak fat ...

1142
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:22,654
... And constructed a rudimentary
WABAC.

1143
01:06:22,655 --> 01:06:24,015
You know what they say...

1144
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:27,091
... if at first you don’t succeed,
try, and try again.

1145
01:06:27,092 --> 01:06:28,968
This is no time for
puns!

1146
01:06:28,969 --> 01:06:30,420
Even good ones.

1147
01:06:30,421 --> 01:06:32,237
Penny, Sherman quickly.

1148
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,984
You’re not going anywhere.

1149
01:06:33,985 --> 01:06:35,724
I’ve seen quit enough to remove the boy...

1150
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:38,990
... both boys,
From this home.

1151
01:06:38,991 --> 01:06:40,518
No, do not!

1152
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:43,433
Miss Grunion  please!
This is All my fault.

1153
01:06:43,434 --> 01:06:45,737
I started it.

1154
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,470
I'm so sorry, Sherman.

1155
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:51,702
You have nothing to apologize for, Penny.

1156
01:06:51,703 --> 01:06:55,206
A dog should never’ve been allowed to adopt a boy
In the first place.

1157
01:06:55,207 --> 01:06:58,545
- Now, come on!
- Miss Grunion, becareful!

1158
01:06:59,774 --> 01:07:01,388
What’s happening?

1159
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:07,419
Mr. Peabody! Help !

1160
01:07:08,308 --> 01:07:09,698
Sherman?

1161
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:26,210
Hey, where did the other two go?

1162
01:07:26,624 --> 01:07:28,172
Our cosmic doubles combined,

1163
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:32,343
In order to reconcile
in space-time continuum.

1164
01:07:33,078 --> 01:07:35,021
Okay, that make sense.

1165
01:07:35,146 --> 01:07:39,952
I do not know what just happened,
but I know it was wrong!

1166
01:07:39,953 --> 01:07:41,660
This boy is coming with me!

1167
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:42,409
Mr. Peabody!

1168
01:07:42,444 --> 01:07:43,878
- No, Miss Grunion!
- oh you’re hurting me!

1169
01:07:43,879 --> 01:07:45,223
Get back here!

1170
01:07:45,765 --> 01:07:47,924
Oh , you’re hurting me!

1171
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,673
He Bit me!

1172
01:07:58,592 --> 01:08:00,975
He Bit me!

1173
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,922
Yes, Hello, police?

1174
01:08:03,923 --> 01:08:05,680
I’ like to report an assault.

1175
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,010
a bite!

1176
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:08,912
Mr. Peabody, what are we gonna do?

1177
01:08:08,913 --> 01:08:10,946
Yes, yes, that’s right.
Get here as soon as possible.

1178
01:08:10,947 --> 01:08:12,302
Run!

1179
01:08:12,516 --> 01:08:14,890
He’s kidnapping children!

1180
01:08:17,057 --> 01:08:19,280
I can’t believe you bit her, Mr. Peabody.

1181
01:08:19,281 --> 01:08:21,052
I know, Sherman. It was wrong.

1182
01:08:21,053 --> 01:08:23,860
Wrong? It was awesome!

1183
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:26,344
And now to return to our proper 
timeline...

1184
01:08:26,345 --> 01:08:28,288
... and erase  this mess.

1185
01:08:31,631 --> 01:08:32,489
There he is!

1186
01:08:32,524 --> 01:08:35,674
He’s got my daughter,
in this gigantic space apple!

1187
01:08:42,209 --> 01:08:44,514
My face is numb.

1188
01:08:49,049 --> 01:08:50,453
What’s wrong?

1189
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,761
Time Travel failed.

1190
01:08:56,762 --> 01:08:57,580
Oh dear...

1191
01:08:57,615 --> 01:08:59,371
What is it, Mr. Peabody?

1192
01:08:59,372 --> 01:09:02,960
Our cosmic doubles colliding ripped the whole in
The space-time continuum.

1193
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:05,366
That’s why we didn’t get to the past.

1194
01:09:08,426 --> 01:09:10,704
Hi, Peabody!
 
1195
01:09:10,705 --> 01:09:13,209
Looks like the past is
coming to us.

1196
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:19,092
I will get you, dog!

1197
01:09:21,431 --> 01:09:23,655
Penny, my bride!

1198
01:09:27,115 --> 01:09:28,292
What?

1199
01:09:30,853 --> 01:09:32,464
Oh dear! oh dear

1200
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,106
Follow that orb.

1201
01:09:56,476 --> 01:09:57,931
I’m Coming!

1202
01:10:01,316 --> 01:10:03,757
What sort of creature are you?

1203
01:10:03,758 --> 01:10:05,930
The name’s Grunion!

1204
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:10,720
I'm in love!

1205
01:10:13,194 --> 01:10:15,589
I just need to find a wormhole.

1206
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,316
Hey , Einstein, it’s the red light.

1207
01:10:24,317 --> 01:10:26,652
Hey ,I’m walking here.

1208
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:28,116
Cake!

1209
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:35,691
Here they go! Don’t lose them!

1210
01:10:41,341 --> 01:10:43,102
I’m trying to find another wormhole...

1211
01:10:43,103 --> 01:10:44,830
... But they all lead back to the present.

1212
01:10:44,831 --> 01:10:46,803
Time Travel failed.

1213
01:10:46,804 --> 01:10:49,007
Time Travel failed.

1214
01:10:55,146 --> 01:10:57,478
There  he is!
after them!

1215
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:00,218
Penny, my queen,
I know you're in there.

1216
01:11:01,287 --> 01:11:03,428
We’re coming  Shermanous!

1217
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,267
Time Travel failed.

1218
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:09,921
Mr. Peabody, look out!

1219
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:20,992
Shermanous, hold on.

1220
01:11:20,993 --> 01:11:23,750
We shall release you from this egg.

1221
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:27,212
drop the saber,

1222
01:11:27,213 --> 01:11:29,023
And step away from the futuristic orb.

1223
01:11:29,024 --> 01:11:31,977
I take orders from no man!

1224
01:11:31,978 --> 01:11:35,162
liberté (Freedom), égalité (Equality), fraternité (Fraternity)!

1225
01:11:38,718 --> 01:11:40,528
Don’t tase me, bro.

1226
01:11:41,727 --> 01:11:44,638
Come out, Peabody,
With the paws in the air.

1227
01:11:46,036 --> 01:11:48,196
Mr. Peabody  , you are under arrest...

1228
01:11:48,197 --> 01:11:50,771
...for kidnapping, reckless endangerment...

1229
01:11:50,772 --> 01:11:53,312
... and a multiplicity of major traffic violations!

1230
01:11:53,313 --> 01:11:54,677
You don’t understand.

1231
01:11:54,678 --> 01:11:56,855
There ‘s a rip in the space-time continuum.

1232
01:11:56,856 --> 01:11:59,380
If you arrest me, I won’t be able to fix
...

1233
01:12:00,545 --> 01:12:02,679
For too long you've bamboozled the world ...

1234
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,727
... with your fancy jargon
and that little red tie of yours. ..

1235
01:12:05,728 --> 01:12:07,220
... and look what’s come of it.

1236
01:12:07,221 --> 01:12:08,625
Take him away!

1237
01:12:08,626 --> 01:12:09,991
Wait.

1238
01:12:10,224 --> 01:12:12,890
- Mr. Peabody!
- Sherman!

1239
01:12:14,325 --> 01:12:16,512
What’s gonna happen to Mr. Peabody?

1240
01:12:16,513 --> 01:12:20,264
Don’t you know what
happens to dogs that bite?

1241
01:12:20,321 --> 01:12:23,033
Let me go.
You don’t know what you’re doing.

1242
01:12:23,034 --> 01:12:25,369
Please,
before it's too late!

1243
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:26,836
Wait!

1244
01:12:26,871 --> 01:12:28,482
Give him another chance!

1245
01:12:28,483 --> 01:12:30,024
He is through with chances.

1246
01:12:30,025 --> 01:12:32,240
Now
He has to pay for his mistakes.

1247
01:12:32,241 --> 01:12:34,600
But
I'm the one who made all the mistakes.

1248
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:37,123
I'm the one who used the WABAC
without permission.

1249
01:12:37,124 --> 01:12:40,486
The only mistake Mr. Peabody ever made...

1250
01:12:40,926 --> 01:12:42,852
... was me.

1251
01:12:43,393 --> 01:12:44,922
Sherman!

1252
01:12:45,159 --> 01:12:47,991
You're absolutely right, Sherman.

1253
01:12:47,992 --> 01:12:52,831
What kind of a father could
this dog ever be to a boy?

1254
01:12:54,918 --> 01:12:56,660
Maybe you're right, Miss Grunion...

1255
01:12:56,661 --> 01:12:58,948
... but there’s one thing you haven’t considered.

1256
01:12:58,949 --> 01:13:00,245
What’s that?

1257
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:04,729
I'm a dog too!

1258
01:13:05,877 --> 01:13:08,747
If being a dog means
You’re like Mr. Peabody...

1259
01:13:08,748 --> 01:13:10,464
... who never turns his back on you...

1260
01:13:10,465 --> 01:13:13,738
... and who’s  always there to
pick you up when you fall...

1261
01:13:13,918 --> 01:13:17,960
... And loves you,
No matter how many times you mess up...

1262
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:20,845
... if that what it means to be a dog...

1263
01:13:20,846 --> 01:13:23,961
... then yeah.
I’M A DOG TOO!

1264
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:27,831
I'm a dog too!

1265
01:13:27,832 --> 01:13:30,299
I'm a dog too!

1266
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:33,000
I'm a dog too!

1267
01:13:33,001 --> 01:13:34,748
I'm a dog too!

1268
01:13:34,982 --> 01:13:36,272
I'm a dog as well! A poodle dog!

1269
01:13:36,307 --> 01:13:38,282
I am a dog too.

1270
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:40,034
Did the one that dog thing.

1271
01:13:40,035 --> 01:13:42,578
- I'm a dog too!
- I.

1272
01:13:57,862 --> 01:14:00,217
I'm a dog too.

1273
01:14:06,598 --> 01:14:08,730
I’m Spartacus.

1274
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:11,218
alright, fine.
You are all dogs.

1275
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:13,278
But You can’t change the law.

1276
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:15,183
I know someone who can.

1277
01:14:17,081 --> 01:14:19,303
George Washington!

1278
01:14:20,214 --> 01:14:22,605
We hold these truths to be self-evident.

1279
01:14:22,606 --> 01:14:26,198
That all men,
and some dogs...

1280
01:14:26,305 --> 01:14:29,673
... Are created equal.

1281
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:34,286
I hereby award Mr. Peabody
a presidential pardon.

1282
01:14:34,287 --> 01:14:35,736
Me too.

1283
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,799
I've done worse.

1284
01:14:51,744 --> 01:14:54,407
Mr. Peabody, look!

1285
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:07,564
It’s getting closer!

1286
01:15:07,599 --> 01:15:08,864
What are we going to do?

1287
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:11,752
This is the greatest collection of
geniuses, ever assembled.

1288
01:15:11,753 --> 01:15:14,750
Surely we can come up with another way of 
getting to the past.

1289
01:15:14,751 --> 01:15:16,840
I gonna built a catapult.

1290
01:15:16,841 --> 01:15:18,542
Then we go very fast!

1291
01:15:18,543 --> 01:15:21,511
But remember as you
approach the speed of light...

1292
01:15:21,512 --> 01:15:23,993
... gravity will get too strong.

1293
01:15:23,994 --> 01:15:27,839
And indeed, for every action,
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

1294
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,417
How about we just punch
That big hole, in the face.

1295
01:15:39,759 --> 01:15:41,660
I have an idea.

1296
01:15:41,966 --> 01:15:44,593
Hey, everybody!
I have an idea!

1297
01:15:44,594 --> 01:15:46,869
Yes what is it, Sherman?

1298
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:49,224
Why not go to the future?

1299
01:15:49,225 --> 01:15:50,511
the future?

1300
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,704
I have never been there before.

1301
01:15:52,705 --> 01:15:55,546
So, it’s probably not as messed up.

1302
01:15:56,279 --> 01:15:59,262
Sherman, that’s it!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1303
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:00,483
Not usually.

1304
01:16:00,518 --> 01:16:02,953
It's exactly what you all just said!

1305
01:16:03,347 --> 01:16:06,031
Except the total opposite!

1306
01:16:06,032 --> 01:16:08,235
If we set the WABAC to the future...

1307
01:16:08,236 --> 01:16:09,860
... and go very very fast...

1308
01:16:09,861 --> 01:16:12,003
... we’ll create our own gravitational field ...

1309
01:16:12,004 --> 01:16:13,968
... that’s equal and opposite...

1310
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:17,356
... to the rip in the space-time continuum!

1311
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:21,392
I don’t get it...

1312
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:25,405
We’re gonna Fly up there,
and punch that big hole in the face.

1313
01:16:25,406 --> 01:16:26,985
Yes!

1314
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:32,049
Sherman, you're a genius!

1315
01:16:33,266 --> 01:16:36,911
But , Peabody,
how far in the future must you go?

1316
01:16:36,912 --> 01:16:38,732
just a few seconds are to do it.

1317
01:16:38,733 --> 01:16:41,155
And then we’ll sling shut right back!

1318
01:16:41,156 --> 01:16:43,016
Are you sure this is going to work?

1319
01:16:43,017 --> 01:16:45,049
Do not worry, Penny.

1320
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:47,844
Just remember, I'm...

1321
01:16:48,155 --> 01:16:49,336
... genius!

1322
01:16:50,433 --> 01:16:52,904
Sherman,
I need to reprogram the WABAC.

1323
01:16:52,905 --> 01:16:54,090
alright, Mr. Peabody.

1324
01:16:54,091 --> 01:16:56,841
That means you have to drive.

1325
01:17:02,142 --> 01:17:17,342

1326
01:17:25,202 --> 01:17:26,951
In order to make the leap into the future...

1327
01:17:26,952 --> 01:17:29,180
... the WABAC have to go very fast.

1328
01:17:29,181 --> 01:17:31,699
Faster than has ever gone before.

1329
01:17:32,043 --> 01:17:34,111
Are you Ready, Sherman?

1330
01:17:34,467 --> 01:17:35,753
I’m ready.

1331
01:17:39,937 --> 01:17:42,545
Come on, Sherman,
you can do it.

1332
01:17:52,363 --> 01:17:53,974
Now, Mr. Peabody?

1333
01:17:53,975 --> 01:17:56,142
Sherman, we need more speed.

1334
01:17:59,014 --> 01:18:00,140
Now?

1335
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,106
Just a Little more.

1336
01:18:04,575 --> 01:18:06,382
Not yet, Sherman.

1337
01:18:06,533 --> 01:18:07,948
Not yet.

1338
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:10,405
Now!

1339
01:18:47,038 --> 01:18:48,592
Farewell!

1340 
01:18:49,144 --> 01:18:51,180
- Everybody addio !
- papa, mama.

1341
01:18:51,181 --> 01:18:53,085
Goodbye!

1342
01:18:53,086 --> 01:18:55,151
Abschied

1343
01:18:57,936 --> 01:19:00,377
You haven’t seen the last of me, Peabody!

1344
01:19:00,378 --> 01:19:03,633
You’ll make a mistake ensurely,
and when you do...

1345
01:19:03,634 --> 01:19:05,557
... I'll be there!

1346
01:19:06,037 --> 01:19:08,635
This is mine!

1347
01:19:28,027 --> 01:19:31,389
Come on, Sherman. Come on!

1348
01:19:54,785 --> 01:19:56,161
Yeah!

1349
01:20:20,678 --> 01:20:22,771
If you want to watch television before
 I get home...

1350
01:20:22,772 --> 01:20:24,215
... simply press the input 3 times...

1351
01:20:24,216 --> 01:20:26,084
... and then use the
remote control as usual.

1352
01:20:26,085 --> 01:20:27,149
yes, Sherman.

1353
01:20:27,184 --> 01:20:29,844
And if you worried about making friends 
at the  PTA (parent teacher association )meeting...

1354
01:20:29,845 --> 01:20:31,661
... consider bringing snacks
for everyone.

1355
01:20:31,662 --> 01:20:33,458
The are always appreciated.

1356
01:20:33,459 --> 01:20:34,923
yes, Sherman.

1357
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:37,928
And remember, Mr. Peabody...

1358
01:20:37,929 --> 01:20:40,087
... I have  club after school today.

1359
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:42,852
Sherman, wait.

1360
01:20:42,935 --> 01:20:45,676
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

1361
01:20:55,012 --> 01:20:57,611
Hey, Mr. Peabody.
Hey, Sherman.

1362
01:20:57,612 --> 01:20:59,106
Wait up!

1363
01:21:01,742 --> 01:21:03,468
no doubt about it:

1364
01:21:03,469 --> 01:21:06,122
Every dog should have a boy.

1365
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:57,043
I know pronounce you husband and wife!

1366
01:21:57,044 --> 01:21:59,543
You may kiss the Grunion.

1367
01:22:00,713 --> 01:22:03,360
Come here, soldier!

1368
01:22:06,153 --> 01:22:15,531
