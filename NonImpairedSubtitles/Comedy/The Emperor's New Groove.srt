1
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:38,667
Will you take a look at that?
Pretty pathetic, huh?

2
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:43,037
Well, you'll never believe this,
but that llama you're looking at
was once a human being.

3
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:46,407
And not just any human being.
That guy was an emperor.

4
00:00:46,512 --> 00:00:49,413
A rich, powerful ball of charisma.
Oh, yeah!

5
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,311
This is his story.
Well, actually, my story.

6
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:58,049
That's right...
I'm that llama.

7
00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:00,523
The name is Kuzco...

8
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:02,992
Emperor Kuzco.

9
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:06,895
I was the world's nicest guy,
and they ruined my life for no reason.

10
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,933
Oh, is that hard to believe?
Look, I tell you what.

11
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:14,631
You go back a ways,
you know, before I was a llama
and this will all make sense.

12
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,540
All right, now see. That's a little
too far back. Oh! Look at me.

13
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:20,544
That's me as a baby.

14
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:25,415
Ahem.
All right, let's move ahead.

15
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:46,765
- Oh, yeah.
- There are despots and dictators

16
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:49,101
Political manipulators

17
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:53,667
There are blue bloods
with the intellects of fleas

18
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:55,769
There are kings and catty tyrants

19
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,077
Who are so lacking in refinements

20
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:02,414
They'd be better suited
swinging from the trees

21
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,579
He was born and raised to rule

22
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:07,317
No one has ever been as cool

23
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:11,623
In a thousand years of aristocracy

24
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:14,197
An enigma and a mystery

25
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:16,232
In Mesoamerican history

26
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:19,531
The quintessence of perfection
that is he

27
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:23,432
Okay, this is the real me.
Not this.

28
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:27,238
This. Not this.
Winner. Loser.

29
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:32,009
Okay, see this palace? Everyone in
it is at my command. Check this out.

30
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:35,711
Butler. Chef.

31
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,515
Theme song guy.

32
00:02:37,622 --> 00:02:40,819
Oh, yeah!
He's the sovereign lord of the nation

33
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:43,086
He's the hippest cat
in creation

34
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:47,722
He's the alpha
the omega, A to Z

35
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:49,857
And this perfect world will spin

36
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:52,231
Around his every little whim

37
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:54,896
'Cause this perfect world
begins and ends with

38
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:56,701
- Me.
- What's his name

39
00:02:56,808 --> 00:03:00,904
Kuzco

40
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:04,072
- That's his name
- Kuzco

41
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:08,175
- He's the king of the world
- Kuzco

42
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:12,052
- Is he hip or what
- Kuzco

43
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:14,056
Yeah

44
00:03:17,628 --> 00:03:19,528
You threw off my groove!

45
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,532
I'm sorry, but you've thrown off
the emperor's groove.

46
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:27,331
- Sorry!
- You were saying?

47
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:31,704
What's his name
Kuzco

48
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:35,108
Kuzco

49
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:39,513
- Kuzco
- That's his name

50
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:41,642
- Kuzco
- Kuzco

51
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:44,745
- Is he hip or what
- Kuzco

52
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:48,451
Don't you know he's
the king of the world

53
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:53,223
- Kuzco
- Whoa, yeah

54
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:58,468
Boom, baby!

55
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,961
Your Highness, it is time for you
to choose your bride.

56
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:05,633
All righty.
Trot out the ladies.

57
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:09,611
Let's take a look-see.
Hate your hair. Not likely.

58
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:13,149
Yikes, yikes, yikes.
And let me guess.

59
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,380
You have a great personality.
Is this really the best you could do?

60
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,752
Oh, yes. Oh, no.
l-I mean, p-perhaps...

61
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:24,385
What is he babbling about? He's like
the thing that wouldn't shut up.

62
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:28,124
Anyway, still wondering about
that llama in the opening?

63
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:31,391
Well, let me show you the people
responsible for ruining my life.

64
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:36,594
First, there's Pacha.

65
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:40,464
Uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Emperor
Kuzco. You see, I got this summons.

66
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:44,437
Inside, up the stairs
and to the left. Just follow the signs.

67
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:48,202
Oh, great.
Thanks a lot.

68
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,609
Uh, and don't be fooled
by the folksy peasant look.

69
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:55,973
- Uh, pardon me. That's mine.
- Oh, here you go.

70
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,951
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

71
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:02,046
- Oh, hey. Are you all right?
Here. Let me, uh...
- Oh, you're so very kind.

72
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:04,182
- What happened?
- Well, l...

73
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:06,283
I threw off the emperor's groove.

74
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:10,353
- What?
- His groove, the rhythm in which he
lives his life, his pattern of behavior.

75
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:14,458
I threw it off, and the emperor
had me thrown out the window.

76
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:18,733
- Oh, really?
I'm supposed to see him today.
- Don't throw off his groove!

77
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,570
- Oh, okay.
- Beware the groove.

78
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:24,668
- Hey, are you gonna be all right?
- Groove.

79
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:29,546
You see what I mean? This guy's trouble,
but as bad as he is...

80
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,551
he is nothing compared
to what's coming up next.

81
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:34,151
And why have you come here today?

82
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:37,782
Well, Y-Your Highness...
I mean, Your Grace.

83
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:40,258
Okay, gang.
Check out this piece of work.

84
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:43,353
This is Yzma,
the emperor's advisor...

85
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:46,433
living proof that dinosaurs
once roamed the Earth.

86
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:48,900
And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man.

87
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:52,700
Every decade or so she gets a new one.
This year's model is called Kronk.

88
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:57,634
Yeah, I got that there, Yzma.

89
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:02,079
Yep, that's Kronk.

90
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:04,708
Now lately, Yzma's
gotten into this bad habit...

91
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,117
of trying to run the country
behind my back...

92
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:09,212
and I'm thinkin'
that's got to stop.

93
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:12,452
It is no concern of mine
whether your family has...

94
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,222
- What was it again?
- Um, food.

95
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,357
Ha! You really should have thought
of that before you became peasants.

96
00:06:19,467 --> 00:06:22,595
We're through here.
Take him away. Next!

97
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:25,901
But l...
Oh, okay.

98
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:31,704
The nerve of some
of those peasants, huh?

99
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:33,872
Tell me about it.

100
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:36,449
- Hi there.
- Oh, Your Highness.

101
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:44,390
- Uh, you were doing it again.
- Doing? Doing... Doing... Doing what?

102
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:49,225
Doing my job. I'm the emperor and you're
the emperor's advisor. Remember that?

103
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,164
But, Your Highness, I was only dealing
with meaningless peasant matters.

104
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:57,499
Whoa.
Look at these wrinkles.

105
00:06:57,605 --> 00:07:00,472
What is holding
this woman together?

106
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:03,635
What the... How long
has that been there?

107
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:06,213
Good thinkin', Yzma.
What do you say, Kuzco?

108
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:09,909
Whoa! No touchy!
No touchy. No touch.

109
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:12,508
Uh, excuse me, Your Highness.
The village leader is here to see you.

110
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,680
Oh, great. Send him in.
Oh, and by the way, you're fired.

111
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,487
Fired?
W-W-What do you mean, fired?

112
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:22,188
Um, how else can I say it?
You're being let go...

113
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:25,288
your department's being downsized,
you're part of an outplacement...

114
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,595
we're going in a different direction,
we're not picking up your option.

115
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:31,468
- Take your pick. I got more.
- But l... You, uh...

116
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:37,768
But... But, Your Highness, I have been
nothing if not loyal to the empire...

117
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,042
for-for-for many, many years.

118
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:43,811
Hey, everybody
hits their stride.

119
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,546
You just hit yours
50 years ago.

120
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:49,623
So, who's in my chair?

121
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:53,091
Oh, oh! I know! Yzma.
Yzma's in your chair, right?

122
00:07:53,194 --> 00:07:56,755
- Very good, Kronk. Here. Get the snack.
- Got it.

123
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,067
Okay, you heard the man.
Up, up, up.

124
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,330
I'm okay. I'm fine.

125
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,608
Okay. Show him in.

126
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:16,510
Uh, afternoon, Your Highness.
I'm here because I received a summons...

127
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:19,141
Hey, there he is! My main village man.

128
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:22,585
Um, Pacha.
Anyway, l-I got this summons...

129
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:25,317
Pacha. That's right.

130
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:28,656
- You are just the man I wanted to see.
- I am?

131
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:31,492
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

132
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,430
You can fix my problem,
can't you?

133
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:37,696
Sure. I'll do what I can.

134
00:08:37,804 --> 00:08:40,602
Good, good. That's just
what I wanted to hear.

135
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:43,676
Are you aware of just how important
your village is to the empire?

136
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:47,076
Well, I know we grow the crops
that you use here at the palace.

137
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,671
We also herd the llamas that you...

138
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:54,550
- My village?
- Oh, yeah.

139
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:59,387
You got a pretty sweet little setup
there on top of that hill, don't you?

140
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:04,055
Yeah. My family has lived on that
hilltop for the last six generations.

141
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:06,894
Uh-huh.
So tell me...

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,195
where do you find
you get the most sun?

143
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:13,671
Oh, l-I'd say just on
the other side of those trees.

144
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:18,302
When the sun hits that ridge
just right, these hills sing.

145
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:20,311
- Well, that settles it.
- Really?

146
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:23,143
Yep. Problem solved.
Thanks for coming.

147
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,616
That's it?
That's all you wanted me for?

148
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:30,281
I just needed an insider's opinion
before I okayed this spot for my pool.

149
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,350
- Uh, your pool?
- Boo-yah! Welcome to Kuzcotopia...

150
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:39,592
my ultimate summer getaway,
complete with water slide.

151
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:43,760
- What?
- Isn't it great?
It's my birthday gift to me.

152
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,565
I'm so happy.

153
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:50,601
I don't understand
how this could happen.

154
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,510
Well, let me clear it up for you.
At my birthday celebration tomorrow...

155
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:57,412
I give the word,
and your town will be destroyed...

156
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:59,542
to make way for this.

157
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:08,225
So, if I were you, I'd pick up some
change-of-address forms on the way home.

158
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:10,922
But-But, um, where will we live?

159
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:14,000
Hmm.
Don't know, don't care.

160
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,728
- How's that?
- Oh, but wait. You can't...

161
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:22,872
When I give the word...

162
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:26,742
your little town thingy
will be bye-bye.

163
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:30,078
- Bye-bye.
- Oh, w-wait. No...

164
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:34,279
Boo-hoo. Oh, yeah.
Everything was goin' my way.

165
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:37,318
Or so I thought.

166
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,355
He can't get rid of me
that easily.

167
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:44,260
Who does that ungrateful
little worm think he is? Does he...

168
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:46,889
a little to the left...

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,867
have any idea of
who he's dealing with?

170
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:53,996
How could he do this to me?
Why, I practically raised him.

171
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:57,975
- Yeah, you think he
would've turned out better.
- Yeah, go figure.

172
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:00,011
Well, it's better you're
takin' out your anger...

173
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:03,241
on these things instead
of the real Kuzco, huh?

174
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:05,408
That's it, Kronk!
That's it!

175
00:11:05,518 --> 00:11:08,385
I'll get rid of Kuzco.

176
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:12,788
- The real Kuzco?
- Of course the real Kuzco.

177
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:14,792
Don't you see?
It's perfect.

178
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:17,158
With him out of the way
and no heir to the throne...

179
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:20,892
I'll take over and rule the empire.

180
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,061
- Brilliant!
- So how does that work
with you bein' fired and all?

181
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:29,505
The only ones who know about
that are the three of us,
soon to be the two of us.

182
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:31,600
And I'm one of
those two, right?

183
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:33,701
To the secret lab!

184
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:37,531
Pull the lever, Kronk.

185
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,132
- Wrong lever!
- Huh?

186
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:43,439
Why do we even
have that lever?

187
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:46,748
Get out of my way!

188
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:53,054
Please remain seated and keep your arms
and legs in at all times.

189
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:55,488
Faster, faster!

190
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:57,992
Yzma, put your hands
in the air!

191
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:08,933
Ah, how shall I do it?
Oh, I know.

192
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:12,667
I'll turn him into a flea,
a harmless little flea...

193
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:16,609
and then I'll put that flea in a box
and then I'll put that box
inside of another box...

194
00:12:16,713 --> 00:12:20,774
and then I'll mail that box
to myself, and when it arrives...

195
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:23,580
I'll smash it with a hammer!

196
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:27,122
It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant,
I tell you! Genius, I say!

197
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:36,162
Or, to save on postage,
I’ll just poison him with this.

198
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:40,100
Take it, Kronk.
Feel the power.

199
00:12:40,203 --> 00:12:42,296
Oh, I can feel it.

200
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:44,498
Our moment of
triumph approaches.

201
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:48,300
It's dinnertime.

202
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,612
So, is everything
ready for tonight?

203
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:04,716
Oh, yeah. I thought we'd start off
with soup and a light salad,
and then see how we feel after that.

204
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:08,194
Not the dinner.
The, you know...

205
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:10,630
Oh, right.
The poison...

206
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:14,464
The poison for Kuzco, the poison
chosen especially to kill Kuzco...

207
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,936
Kuzco's poison.

208
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,871
- That poison?
- Yes! That poison.

209
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,239
- Got you covered.
- Excellent.

210
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:24,541
A few drops in his drink,
and then I'll propose a toast...

211
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:26,615
and he will be dead before dessert.

212
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:30,174
Which is a real shame,
because it's gonna be delicious.

213
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:32,846
Boom, bam, baby!
Let's get to the grub.

214
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:36,516
I am one hungry
king of the world.

215
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:40,858
So, no hard feelings
about being let go?

216
00:13:40,963 --> 00:13:43,397
None whatsoever.

217
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:47,299
Kronk, get the emperor a drink.

218
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:50,304
Drink. Right.

219
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:08,513
Your Highness.

220
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:11,491
- Is something burning?
- My spinach puffs!

221
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:22,761
So, he seems nice.

222
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:26,035
H-He is.

223
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:29,305
He's what,
in his late twenties?

224
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:33,041
- I'm not sure.
- Saved 'em!

225
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:35,174
- That's great. Good job.
- Great! Very good job.

226
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:38,310
Watch it.
They're still hot.

227
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:45,160
Kronk.
The emperor needs his drink.

228
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:48,560
Right. Oh. Right.

229
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:58,633
Hey, Kronky,
everything okay back there?

230
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:02,302
Well... Oh, uh...

231
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:05,347
The drinks were a bit on the...

232
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:08,281
oh, uh, warm side.

233
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:13,314
Hey, did you see that sky today?
Talk about blue.

234
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:15,983
Yes, Kronk. Riveting.

235
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:18,856
A toast to the emperor!

236
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,054
Long live Kuzco!

237
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:24,723
Don't drink the wine.
Poison.

238
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,302
Ah! Tasty.

239
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:37,508
Finally!
Good work, Kronk.

240
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:40,104
Oh, they're so easy to make.
I'll get you the recipe.

241
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:43,379
Now to get rid of the body.

242
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:45,386
Okay! What were we saying?

243
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:48,855
Uh, uh, w-we were just
making a toast...

244
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,725
to your long and healthy rule.

245
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,731
Right. So what are you gonna do?

246
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,165
I mean, you've been
around here a long time and...

247
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:02,499
I really mean a long time.

248
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:06,507
I mean, it might be difficult
for someone of your age...

249
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:08,509
adjusting to life
in the private sector.

250
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:13,310
Hey, Kronk, can you
top me off, pal? Be a friend?

251
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:17,614
- Now, about you finding new work,
that's-that's gonna be tough.
- Hit him on the head.

252
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,780
- More broccoli?
- Because you're, you know...

253
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,917
Let's face it. You're no
spring chicken, and I mean that
in the best possible way.

254
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:29,157
What? A llama?

255
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:31,256
He's supposed to be dead!

256
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,858
Yeah, weird.

257
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,438
Let me see that vial.

258
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:40,808
This isn't poison.

259
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,074
This is extract of llama.

260
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:47,672
You know, in my defense,
your poisons all look alike.

261
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:49,944
You might think about
relabeling some of them.

262
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:54,546
Take him out of town
and finish the job now!

263
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:59,390
- What about dinner?
- Kronk, this is kind of important.

264
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:04,364
- How about dessert?
- Well, I suppose there's time
for dessert.

265
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:08,062
- And coffee?
- All right. A quick cup of coffee.

266
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,162
Then take him out of town
and finish the job!

267
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,640
Guess where I am right now.
Uh-huh. In the bag.

268
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,743
Still think I'm not the victim here?
Watch. It gets better.

269
00:17:25,854 --> 00:17:27,754
Hey!

270
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:30,051
He's doing his own theme music?

271
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:42,329
Big, dumb and tone deaf.

272
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:46,100
I am so glad I was unconscious
for all of this.

273
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,470
Mission accomplished.

274
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,224
- You're not just gonna let him
die like that, are you?
- My shoulder angel.

275
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:11,265
Don't listen to that guy. He's trying to
lead you down the path of righteousness.

276
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:14,199
I'm gonna lead you
down the path that rocks.

277
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,497
- Oh, come off it.
- You come off it!

278
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:18,835
- You.
- You.
- You.
- You infinity.

279
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:24,708
Listen up, big guy. I got three good
reasons why you should just walk away.

280
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,747
Number one...
Look at that guy!

281
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:28,873
He's got that sissy
stringy music thing.

282
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:32,112
We've been through this.
It's a harp, and you know it.

283
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,553
Oh, right. That's a harp
and that's a dress.

284
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,148
- Robe!
- Reason number two...

285
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,660
Look what I can do.

286
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:42,855
But what does that
have to do with anything?

287
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:46,456
- No, no. He's got a point.
- Listen, you guys.

288
00:18:46,568 --> 00:18:51,198
You're sort of confusing me,
so, uh, begone! Uh... Or, uh, you know.

289
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:54,434
- However I get rid of you guys.
- That'll work.

290
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:19,323
Um, what's with the chimp and the bug?
Can we get back to me?

291
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:23,663
Oh, boy.
Think, think, think.

292
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:26,900
What to do, what to do?
What do we do with the body?

293
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:35,975
What am I gonna
tell the village?

294
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:40,214
Come on, Kronky. Come on, Kronky. Okay.
What do I do? What do I do?

295
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,161
Back! Elbow! Shoulder!

296
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:56,637
Oh. Hey! Hey, you!

297
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:00,333
Hey! Excuse me. Excuse me. Stop!
Pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry about that.

298
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:02,910
Comin' through.
Hey, you with the cart!

299
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:04,945
Uh-oh.

300
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:07,139
This is not good.

301
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,375
Hope that doesn't
come back to haunt me.

302
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:05,764
Mom! Mom! I think I'm still growing!
Measure me again!

303
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:08,034
All right, Tipo.
Stand still and let's see.

304
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,975
Mom, you and I both know
that it's impossible for him...

305
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,809
to have grown in
the last five minutes.

306
00:21:13,915 --> 00:21:17,180
- Isn't it?
- Look how much you've grown.

307
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:19,219
What? Tipo, get out of the way.

308
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,949
- It's my turn again. Measure me.
- Dad's home.

309
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:26,724
Hey!

310
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,728
Come here.

311
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:35,027
- Dad! I ate a bug today!
- Oh! Was Mom baking again?

312
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:37,366
- Don't tell her I said that.
- I heard that.

313
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:39,406
Okay, everybody, move aside.

314
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,975
Lady with a baby
comin' through.

315
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:44,943
Dad! Dad! Dad!
Look at how big I am.

316
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:47,139
- We were all measured today.
- Oh.

317
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:51,184
I'm going through a growth spurt.
I'm as big as you were when you were me.

318
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:52,752
Mm-hmm. Sure are.

319
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:57,314
That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

320
00:21:57,425 --> 00:22:02,021
Okay, okay, you two.
Our deal was that you could
stay awake until Daddy came home.

321
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,394
Now say good night.

322
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:07,059
Dad, do we have to?

323
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:15,270
No, you two can stay up.
We're just gonna be sittin' here tellin'
each other how much we love each other.

324
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,503
Right, honey?

325
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:20,614
Good night.

326
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,047
So, what did the emperor want?

327
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:26,120
You know what?
He couldn't see me.

328
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,688
- Couldn't see you? Why not?
- I don't know.

329
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,317
- Well... Well, that's just rude.
- Well, he is the emperor.
I'm sure he's busy.

330
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:36,591
- No, no, no, no. No. Emperor or no
emperor, it's called common courtesy.
- Honey...

331
00:22:36,697 --> 00:22:40,599
If that were me, I'd march right back
there and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

332
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:43,727
- Sweetie, sweetie, think of the baby.
- Pacha, I'm fine.

333
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:46,739
This baby's not coming
for a while, but even if it was...

334
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,741
I'd give that guy
a piece of my mind.

335
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:52,574
That kind of behavior just-just...

336
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,671
I gotta go wash something.

337
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:12,457
Pacha? You okay?

338
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:16,230
Hmm? Oh, yeah. I'm just
a little tired from the trip.

339
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:19,602
Um, I'm gonna go
put Misty away.

340
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,886
Hi. Excuse me.
Two seconds here.

341
00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:36,923
Um, I'm the one
in the cart. Remember?

342
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:40,482
This story's about me,
not him.

343
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:44,656
Okay. You got it? All right. We're gonna
move ahead. Sorry to slow you down.

344
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:56,642
Huh?

345
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,147
Whoa.

346
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:06,447
- Where'd you come from, little guy?
- No touchy.

347
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:09,421
- Demon llama!
- Demon llama? Where?

348
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,660
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

349
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:18,527
Ow! Ow, my head.

350
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:21,499
Okay, demon llama.
Just take it easy.

351
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:24,400
I mean you no harm.

352
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:28,498
What are you talking about...
Oh, wait, I know you.

353
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:32,875
- You're that whiny peasant.
- Emperor Kuzco?

354
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,880
Yeah. Who do you think
you were talkin' to?

355
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:37,109
Uh, how did...

356
00:24:38,953 --> 00:24:42,389
You don't look like the emperor.

357
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,618
What do you mean I don't
look like the emperor?

358
00:24:45,726 --> 00:24:51,096
- Do this...
- What is this, some kind of little
game you country folk like to...

359
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,359
It can't be!

360
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:58,230
My face!
My beautiful, beautiful face!

361
00:24:58,339 --> 00:25:00,671
- Okay, okay, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'm an ugly, stinky llama!

362
00:25:00,774 --> 00:25:03,675
- Wait, okay, Your Majesty. Shh.
- Llama face!

363
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:06,211
What happened?

364
00:25:06,313 --> 00:25:08,873
I'm tryin' to
figure that out, okay?

365
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,013
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything.

366
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:17,989
Wait a minute.
I remember you.

367
00:25:18,092 --> 00:25:20,560
I remember telling you
that I was building my pool...

368
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:23,391
where your house was,
and then you got mad at me.

369
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:29,560
- And you turned me into a llama!
- What? No, I did not.

370
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,434
- Yes, and then you kidnapped me.
- Why would I kidnap a llama?

371
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,771
I have no idea. You're
the criminal mastermind, not me.

372
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:38,970
- What?
- You're right.

373
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,047
That's giving you
way too much credit.

374
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,446
Okay. I have to get back
to the palace.

375
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:46,918
Yzma's got that "secret lab."

376
00:25:47,021 --> 00:25:49,546
I’ll just snap my fingers
and order her to change me back.

377
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:52,888
Hey, you.
No time to waste. Let's go.

378
00:25:56,163 --> 00:26:00,793
Hey, tiny, I want to get out of this
body. Wouldn't you? Now let's go.

379
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:05,233
Build your summerhouse
somewhere else.

380
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:07,637
You wanna run that
by me again?

381
00:26:09,543 --> 00:26:12,808
I can't let you go back
unless you change your mind...

382
00:26:12,913 --> 00:26:15,507
and build your summer home
somewhere else.

383
00:26:17,518 --> 00:26:21,454
I got a little secret for you.
Come here. No, closer.

384
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:24,524
I don't make deals
with peasants!

385
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,253
Then I guess I can't
take you back.

386
00:26:27,361 --> 00:26:30,592
Fine. I don't need you.
I can find my own way back.

387
00:26:30,698 --> 00:26:34,293
I wouldn't recommend it. It's a little
dangerous if you don't know the way.

388
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:36,835
- Nice try, pal.
- No, really. I'm telling you...

389
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:39,667
there are jaguars and snakes
and quicksand.

390
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:44,403
- I'm not listening.
- I'm not kidding.
Listen, you cannot go in there.

391
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:48,038
Ow! Still not listening.

392
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:53,279
Aw, you...
Fine. Fine. Go ahead.

393
00:26:53,387 --> 00:26:56,845
If there's no Kuzco,
there's no Kuzcotopia.

394
00:26:56,957 --> 00:26:58,891
Takes care of my problem.

395
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,234
Scary jungle. Right.
Oh, a leaf.

396
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:20,439
Oh, it might attack me.
Oh, it's a scary tree.

397
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:23,311
I'm afraid.

398
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:26,716
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor, and as such...

399
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,086
I'm born with an innate
sense of direction.

400
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,625
Okay, where am I?

401
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:41,225
Help me!
Help me! Help me!

402
00:27:44,104 --> 00:27:48,438
- Too late.
- Okay, that was the freakiest thing
I've ever seen.

403
00:27:57,017 --> 00:27:59,952
What do you want?

404
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,886
Oh, for me?
Why, I don't know what to say.

405
00:28:04,858 --> 00:28:07,053
- Ow!
- Hit the road, bucky.

406
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:15,096
Ow! Huh? Huh?

407
00:28:17,337 --> 00:28:20,272
Huh? Uh-oh.

408
00:28:29,483 --> 00:28:31,417
No, no.
No, no, no, no.

409
00:28:31,518 --> 00:28:34,112
No, no. No, don't.

410
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:41,017
Ha!

411
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:46,998
No!

412
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:08,310
You killer jaguars...

413
00:29:08,422 --> 00:29:11,687
Whoa!

414
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:36,204
Don't worry, Your Highness.
I got ya. You're safe now.

415
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:44,352
Maybe I'm just new to this whole
rescuing thing, but this, to me...

416
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:46,948
might be considered kind of
a step backwards, wouldn't you say?

417
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:51,621
No, no, no. It's-It's okay. This-This
is all right. We can figure this out.

418
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:59,004
- I hate you.
- No!

419
00:30:00,306 --> 00:30:02,206
Ow! Ow!

420
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:15,246
Ow! Ow!

421
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:25,130
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting all funned out.

422
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:27,358
- Uh-oh.
- Don't tell me.

423
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:29,661
- We're about to go over
a huge waterfall.
- Yep.

424
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:32,533
- Sharp rocks at the bottom?
- Most likely.

425
00:30:32,638 --> 00:30:34,663
Bring it on.

426
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:09,835
Your Highness.
Your Highness, can you hear me?

427
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:12,103
Oh, boy.
Come on, breathe.

428
00:31:13,713 --> 00:31:15,738
Breathe!

429
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:18,112
Oh. Why me?

430
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:29,188
All right.

431
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:43,966
For the last time,
it was not a kiss.

432
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:48,570
Well, whatever you call it,
it was disgusting.

433
00:31:48,681 --> 00:31:51,275
And if you would've done what I ordered
you to do in the first place...

434
00:31:51,384 --> 00:31:55,946
we all could've been spared
your little kiss of life.

435
00:31:57,556 --> 00:32:00,582
But now that you're here,
you will take me back to the palace.

436
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:04,857
I'll have Yzma change me back, and then
I'll start construction on Kuzcotopia.

437
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,899
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, now look...

438
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,400
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

439
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:14,067
I just think if you really
thought about it...

440
00:32:14,173 --> 00:32:16,698
you'd decide to build your home
on a different hilltop.

441
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,970
And why would I do that?

442
00:32:19,078 --> 00:32:21,171
Because...

443
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,374
deep down, I think you'll realize
that you're forcing an entire village...

444
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:26,383
out of their homes
just for you.

445
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:30,114
And that's bad?

446
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:32,656
Well, yeah.

447
00:32:32,758 --> 00:32:35,124
Uh, nobody's that heartless.

448
00:32:37,463 --> 00:32:41,229
- Now take me back.
- What? Wait, wait.
How can you be this way?

449
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:44,894
All you care about
is building your summer home and
filling it with stuff for you.

450
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,838
Uh, yeah. Doy. Me.
Everyone else in the kingdom gets it.

451
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:52,809
You're the only one that doesn't seem
to be with the program, eh, Pacha?

452
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:56,040
You know what? Someday,
you're gonna wind up all alone...

453
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:59,049
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

454
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:02,245
Thanks for that. I'll log that away.
Now, for the final time...

455
00:33:02,354 --> 00:33:05,221
I order you to take me
back to the palace.

456
00:33:05,324 --> 00:33:07,417
Looks to me like
you're stuck out here...

457
00:33:07,526 --> 00:33:11,724
because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.

458
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:16,391
Because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.

459
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:19,767
Me, me, me.

460
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,171
Huh? What?
I didn't do anything. I didn't...

461
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:26,438
Somebody's throwing stuff. You gonna
build a fire or what? What's going on?

462
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:30,506
He's never gonna
change his mind.

463
00:33:32,952 --> 00:33:35,546
How am I ever gonna
get out of here?

464
00:34:03,181 --> 00:34:06,981
And so, it is with
great sadness...

465
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:10,748
that we mourn the sudden departure
of our beloved prince...

466
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:14,186
taken from us so tragically...

467
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:17,125
on the very eve
of his 18th birthday.

468
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:20,755
- Poor little guy.
- His legacy will live on
in our hearts...

469
00:34:20,865 --> 00:34:24,926
- He never had a chance.
- for all eternity.

470
00:34:26,037 --> 00:34:28,301
Well, he ain't gettin' any deader.

471
00:34:28,406 --> 00:34:30,397
Back to work.

472
00:34:43,254 --> 00:34:47,350
Kronk, darlin',
I must admit you had me worried...

473
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:49,484
when you mixed up those poisons.

474
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:53,690
But now that Kuzco is dead,
all is forgiven.

475
00:34:53,798 --> 00:34:57,791
Ah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's... He's dead, all right.

476
00:34:57,902 --> 00:35:01,702
I mean, you can't get much deader
than he... than he is right now.

477
00:35:01,806 --> 00:35:05,037
Unless, of course,
we killed him again.

478
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:06,974
I suppose.

479
00:35:07,078 --> 00:35:11,708
- Hey, look, the royal dresser's here.
- Kronk.

480
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:14,182
- I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.
- Kronk.

481
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:17,846
I wear a 66 long
and a 31 waist.

482
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:20,857
Kuzco is dead, right?

483
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:25,692
Tell me Kuzco's dead.
I need to hear these words.

484
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:29,995
- Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?
- He's still alive?

485
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:32,467
Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

486
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:37,564
- Kronk.
- I just thought I'd give you the
heads-up in case Kuzco ever came back.

487
00:35:37,675 --> 00:35:41,543
- He can't come back!
- Yeah. That would be kind of awkward...

488
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:43,546
especially after
that lovely eulogy.

489
00:35:43,648 --> 00:35:47,140
You think? You and I
are going out to find him.

490
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:50,688
If he talks, we are through!
Now let's move.

491
00:35:53,024 --> 00:35:55,185
Tipo, what is it?

492
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:58,990
I had a dream that Dad was tied to a log
and was careening out of control...

493
00:35:59,097 --> 00:36:01,156
down a raging river of death!

494
00:36:01,266 --> 00:36:03,325
- All right, all right, it's okay. Shh.
- It was awful!

495
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:08,269
It's okay, it's okay. Tipo, calm down.
It was just a dream. Your dad's fine.

496
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:11,706
He just went back
to see the emperor.

497
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:15,371
Oh. Like you told him to,
'cause you're always right.

498
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,574
That's right. Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.

499
00:36:18,683 --> 00:36:20,583
Yeah, like that
would ever happen.

500
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:23,620
- It could.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

501
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:25,848
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-uh.
- Nuh-uh.

502
00:36:25,957 --> 00:36:27,424
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

503
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:29,550
- Good night, you two.
- Yeah-huh. Night, Mom.
- Nuh-uh. Night, Mom.

504
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:31,424
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

505
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,540
Uh, hey.

506
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,543
- Thanks.
- Oh.

507
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,584
No problem.

508
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:58,346
- Feels like wool.
- Yeah.

509
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:01,185
- Alpaca?
- Oh, yeah, it is.

510
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:05,251
Oh, yeah, I thought so.
It's nice.

511
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:08,195
- My wife made it.
- Oh, she knits?

512
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:12,167
- Crochets.
- Crochets? Nice.

513
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:13,998
Thanks.

514
00:37:19,376 --> 00:37:21,276
So...

515
00:37:21,378 --> 00:37:27,044
So, I was thinking that
when I got back to the city, we'd, uh...

516
00:37:27,151 --> 00:37:32,214
I mean, there's lots of hilltops,
and maybe I might, you know, l-I might...

517
00:37:32,323 --> 00:37:36,817
Are you saying
you've changed your mind?

518
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:40,158
- Oh, well, l-l...
- Because you know that means...

519
00:37:40,264 --> 00:37:43,097
you're doing something nice
for someone else.

520
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,000
- No, I know that. I know.
- And you're all right with that?

521
00:37:47,104 --> 00:37:49,004
Yes.

522
00:37:54,411 --> 00:37:56,311
What?

523
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:00,746
Don't shake unless you mean it.

524
00:38:08,626 --> 00:38:11,595
All right.

525
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:14,163
Let's get you
back to the palace.

526
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:16,825
Oh, by the way, thanks.

527
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:20,563
No, thank you.

528
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:36,345
Okay. Once we cross this bridge,
it's only an hour to the palace.

529
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:40,048
- Good, because believe it or not,
I think I need a bath.
- I believe it.

530
00:38:40,157 --> 00:38:42,387
- What was that?
- Nothing.

531
00:38:43,994 --> 00:38:45,825
Whoa! Kuzco!

532
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:49,489
- Kuzco!
- Yeah?

533
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,467
Quick, help me up!

534
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:55,766
- No. I don't think I will.
- You're gonna leave me here?

535
00:38:55,873 --> 00:38:59,673
Well, I was gonna have
you imprisoned for life,
but I kind of like this better.

536
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:01,870
I thought you were
a changed man.

537
00:39:01,979 --> 00:39:04,709
Oh, come on. I had to say something
to get you to take me back to the city.

538
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:08,774
- So all of it was a lie?
- Well, yeah. No, wait.

539
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:14,322
Uh, yeah, yeah.
It all was a lie. Toodles.

540
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:16,393
We shook hands on it!

541
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:24,767
You know, the funny thing
about shaking hands is you need hands.

542
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:27,837
Okay. Buh-bye.

543
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:33,602
- Are you okay? Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm all right.

544
00:39:33,711 --> 00:39:37,340
Good! That's for going back
on your promise!

545
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:40,740
Yeah. That's for
kidnapping me...

546
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:45,220
and taking me to your village, which
I'm still gonna destroy, by the way.

547
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:47,051
No touchy.

548
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:50,058
Why did I risk my life
for a selfish brat like you?

549
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,789
I was always taught that
there was some good in everyone,
but, oh, you proved me wrong.

550
00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:57,128
Oh, boo-hoo.
Now I feel really bad. Bad llama.

551
00:39:57,234 --> 00:40:00,431
I could've let you die out there
in that jungle, and then
all my problems would be over.

552
00:40:00,537 --> 00:40:02,801
Well, that makes you
ugly and stupid.

553
00:40:02,906 --> 00:40:05,272
- Let's end this.
- Ladies first.

554
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:26,893
- Ow! Ow!
- Ow! Ow!

555
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:35,166
What are we gonna do?

556
00:40:35,272 --> 00:40:38,241
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

557
00:40:38,342 --> 00:40:40,833
That's it for me!

558
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:42,912
No, we're not.
Calm down.

559
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:46,176
I have an idea.
Give me your arm.

560
00:40:46,283 --> 00:40:48,183
Okay, now the other one.

561
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:54,888
When I say go, push against my back
and we'll walk up the hill.

562
00:40:54,992 --> 00:40:57,290
Ready? Go.

563
00:40:57,394 --> 00:41:02,627
- Ow! You did that on purpose.
- No, I didn't!

564
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:06,169
Now, we're gonna have to work together
to get out of this, so follow my lead.

565
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:10,206
- Ready? Right foot.
- Whose right? Your right or-or mine?

566
00:41:10,307 --> 00:41:12,537
- I don't care. Mine.
- Well, why yours?

567
00:41:12,643 --> 00:41:14,770
- Okay, your right! Ready?
- Okay, got it.

568
00:41:14,878 --> 00:41:16,778
Okay. Right.

569
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,078
- Left. Right.
- Look, we're moving!

570
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:25,849
Don't look down!
Now, stay with me. Stay with me.

571
00:41:25,956 --> 00:41:29,483
Right. Left.
Right. Left.

572
00:41:29,593 --> 00:41:33,529
Right. Left. Right!

573
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:38,124
- Now what, genius?
- Working on it.

574
00:41:38,235 --> 00:41:40,396
Okay, here's the deal.

575
00:41:40,504 --> 00:41:43,667
Stretch out your neck,
and I'll grab the rope.

576
00:41:43,774 --> 00:41:46,402
How do I know you won't let me fall
after you grab the rope?

577
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,502
You're just gonna
have to trust me!

578
00:41:52,316 --> 00:41:55,479
You know, it's a good thing
you're not a big, fat guy...

579
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:57,486
or this would be
really difficult.

580
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:03,356
Almost. Got it!

581
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,624
- It's stuck.
- Take your time. No hurry here.

582
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:11,524
- Scorpions!
- Kuzco!

583
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,234
Oh, no!

584
00:42:24,348 --> 00:42:25,975
Huh?

585
00:42:30,587 --> 00:42:33,522
Whoa!

586
00:42:42,032 --> 00:42:43,829
Huh?

587
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:45,834
Look out!

588
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,940
Yeah! Oh, look at me
and my bad self.

589
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:55,773
I snatched you
right out of the air.

590
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:59,178
"Oh, I'm a crumbly canyon wall,
and I'm taking you with me."

591
00:42:59,283 --> 00:43:01,649
Well, not today, pal.
Uh-huh.

592
00:43:01,752 --> 00:43:03,982
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

593
00:43:04,087 --> 00:43:06,419
- You just saved my life.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

594
00:43:06,523 --> 00:43:09,822
Huh? So?

595
00:43:09,927 --> 00:43:12,487
- I knew it.
- Knew what?
- That there is some good
in you after all.

596
00:43:12,596 --> 00:43:14,860
- Oh, no.
- Admit it.
- Wrong.
- Yes, there is.

597
00:43:14,965 --> 00:43:18,059
- Nuh-uh.
- I think there is.
- Nuh-uh.
- Hey, you could've let me fall.

598
00:43:18,168 --> 00:43:22,662
Come on. What's the big deal?
Nobody's that heartless!

599
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:26,300
Don't read too much into it.
It was a one-time thing.

600
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,844
Right. Sure.

601
00:43:28,946 --> 00:43:30,914
Well, we better get going.

602
00:43:31,014 --> 00:43:34,313
With that bridge out, it's
a four-day walk to the palace.

603
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:36,852
What? You mean you're still
taking me back?

604
00:43:36,954 --> 00:43:42,017
- I shook on it, didn't I?
- Well, yeah, uh, but I hope you
realize that doesn't change a thing.

605
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:45,026
I'm still building Kuzcotopia
when I get back.

606
00:43:45,128 --> 00:43:48,655
Well, four days is a long time. Who
knows? Maybe you'll change your mind.

607
00:43:48,765 --> 00:43:51,165
Uh-huh. Four days.

608
00:43:51,268 --> 00:43:54,567
- What are the chances
of you carrying me?
- Not good.

609
00:43:56,864 --> 00:43:59,025
No, no, no!

610
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:01,465
We've searched every village
surrounding the palace...

611
00:44:01,568 --> 00:44:03,536
and still no sign of Kuzco.

612
00:44:03,637 --> 00:44:06,037
Where is he?

613
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,937
- Kronk!
- Kronk here.

614
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:11,273
- I'm getting tired. Pull over.
- Sure thing. Kronk out.

615
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:27,317
Perfect.
These are my best shoes.

616
00:44:29,029 --> 00:44:31,259
I hate this jungle.

617
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:36,698
Oh, look. A golden-throated
small-winged warbler.

618
00:44:36,804 --> 00:44:39,500
Just one more
for exotic bird bingo.

619
00:44:39,606 --> 00:44:41,506
I am loving this.

620
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,646
Get away from me!

621
00:44:55,055 --> 00:44:58,183
Yeah. Tell me about it.

622
00:44:58,292 --> 00:45:01,853
No, no, it's not you. She's not
the easiest person to get close to.

623
00:45:01,962 --> 00:45:04,453
There's a wall there.
Trust me.

624
00:45:04,565 --> 00:45:06,590
Are you talking
to that squirrel?

625
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,759
I was a junior chipmunk, uh...

626
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:11,394
and I had to be versed in
all the woodland creatures.

627
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:14,941
Please continue.

628
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:19,143
Why me? Why me?

629
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:21,476
Hey, it doesn't always
have to be about you.

630
00:45:21,582 --> 00:45:23,447
This poor little guy
has had it rough.

631
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,678
Seems a talking llama
gave him a hard time the other day.

632
00:45:26,787 --> 00:45:29,722
Oh, a talking llama?

633
00:45:29,823 --> 00:45:31,723
Do tell.

634
00:45:34,061 --> 00:45:36,427
Uh, he doesn't really
wanna talk to you.

635
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,623
Well, then you ask him.

636
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,234
I hate being in the middle.
Squeaky, uh...

637
00:45:42,336 --> 00:45:44,668
squeak, squeaker, squeakin'.

638
00:45:47,074 --> 00:45:49,133
Jaguars? No kidding?
Brutal.

639
00:45:56,183 --> 00:45:58,083
Uh, could you give us
a little room here?

640
00:45:58,185 --> 00:46:00,415
Uh, sorry.

641
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:05,124
A little bit more, please.

642
00:46:05,225 --> 00:46:08,353
- How's this?
- Yeah, that's good.

643
00:46:08,462 --> 00:46:12,125
Now ask him which way
the talking llama went!

644
00:46:12,232 --> 00:46:15,724
Uh, squeakity-squeak, squeakin'.

645
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:30,182
- Low blood sugar, huh?
- Yeah. It's a curse.

646
00:46:30,284 --> 00:46:33,515
Well, as soon as we get something to
eat, you're walking the rest of the way.

647
00:46:45,398 --> 00:46:47,332
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut...

648
00:46:47,434 --> 00:46:52,371
home of the mug of meat.

649
00:46:52,472 --> 00:46:54,565
What'll it be?

650
00:46:54,674 --> 00:46:58,007
We'll have two specials.
Is that all right, dear?

651
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:01,740
Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.

652
00:47:01,848 --> 00:47:06,285
- We're on our honeymoon.
- Bless you for coming out in public.

653
00:47:06,386 --> 00:47:08,445
So that's two specials.

654
00:47:08,555 --> 00:47:11,786
And an onion log.
To split.

655
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:15,523
Ordering!
I need two heartburns...

656
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:18,826
and a deep-fried doorstop
on table 12!

657
00:47:21,368 --> 00:47:23,529
Okay, so I'll admit
this was a good idea.

658
00:47:23,637 --> 00:47:26,697
When will you learn that
all my ideas are good ones?

659
00:47:26,806 --> 00:47:29,969
That's funny, because I thought that
you going into the jungle by yourself...

660
00:47:30,076 --> 00:47:35,036
being chased by jaguars, lying to me
to take you back to the palace
were all really bad ideas.

661
00:47:35,148 --> 00:47:38,015
Oh, yeah. Anything sounds bad
when you say it with that attitude.

662
00:47:38,118 --> 00:47:42,714
Hot and crispy pill bug
for the happy couple.

663
00:47:48,061 --> 00:47:49,961
Oh, boy.

664
00:47:56,803 --> 00:47:59,169
Oh, here.
Let me get that for you.

665
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:06,401
- Where are you going?
- I'm just gonna slip into the kitchen
and have a word with the chef.

666
00:48:06,513 --> 00:48:09,209
- You're gonna get us thrown out.
- Please.

667
00:48:09,315 --> 00:48:12,648
With this disguise,
I'm invisible.

668
00:48:18,658 --> 00:48:21,320
We've been walking around in circles
for who knows how long.

669
00:48:21,428 --> 00:48:25,387
That is the last time we take
directions from a squirrel.

670
00:48:25,498 --> 00:48:28,695
I should have done away
with Kuzco myself when I had the chance.

671
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:34,140
Oh, you really gotta stop
beating yourself up about that.

672
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:40,271
Uh-oh. I'll get you
another one there, Yzma.

673
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,349
- You using that fork, pal?
- Hey, don't I know you?

674
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:46,180
- I don't think so.
- Wrestled you in high school?

675
00:48:46,286 --> 00:48:48,186
- Don't remember that.
- No? Metal shop?
- Uh, no...

676
00:48:48,288 --> 00:48:50,848
Oh, I got it. Miss Narca's
interpretive dance... two semesters.

677
00:48:50,957 --> 00:48:54,893
I was usually in the back because
of my weak ankles. Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.

678
00:48:54,994 --> 00:48:58,259
Uh, no, look, l-I don't think
we've ever met, but, look, I gotta go.

679
00:48:58,364 --> 00:49:01,891
- Don't worry. I'll think of it.
- Look, all I know is
the food looked iffy.

680
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:04,196
All right? And I'm not the only one
that thinks that, I'm sure.

681
00:49:04,304 --> 00:49:07,000
- Psst! Hey!
- So I'm just checking to make sure...

682
00:49:07,107 --> 00:49:09,007
that you're gonna take
the main course up a notch.

683
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:12,875
Is there anything on this menu
that is not swimming in gravy?

684
00:49:12,979 --> 00:49:15,413
- Hang on. I'll go ask the chef.
- It's a simple question.

685
00:49:15,515 --> 00:49:19,611
Is there or is there not
anything edible on this menu?

686
00:49:21,788 --> 00:49:24,655
Hey, I didn't ask him
about dessert yet!

687
00:49:24,758 --> 00:49:27,124
Hey, pal, what's your policy
on making special orders?

688
00:49:27,227 --> 00:49:29,127
All right, buster,
that's it!

689
00:49:29,229 --> 00:49:31,663
You want a special order,
then you make it! I quit!

690
00:49:31,765 --> 00:49:35,599
- Yeah, but l... Hold on.
- You know, I try and I try, but there's
just no respect for anyone with vision.

691
00:49:35,702 --> 00:49:39,263
- That-That's it! There's just
nothing I can do about it!
- Wait a second. Please don't go.
- Ordering.

692
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:43,172
- Three pork combos, extra bacon on
the side, two chili cheese samplers...
- No, no.

693
00:49:43,276 --> 00:49:45,836
a basket of liver and onion rings,
a catch of the day...

694
00:49:45,945 --> 00:49:48,971
and a steak cut
in the shape of a trout.

695
00:49:49,082 --> 00:49:51,778
- You got all that, honey?
- Three oinkers wearing pants,
plate of hot air...

696
00:49:51,885 --> 00:49:54,854
basket of Grandma's breakfast
and change the bull to a gill, got it.

697
00:49:54,954 --> 00:49:58,947
- What's going on?
- There's no time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.

698
00:49:59,058 --> 00:50:01,117
What is he doing in there?

699
00:50:04,964 --> 00:50:07,057
- Come on!
- In a minute. I'm still hungry.

700
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:09,761
- No, Kuzco!
- Okay, I'll make it simple for you.

701
00:50:09,869 --> 00:50:12,633
I'll have a spinach omelet
with wheat toast. You got it?

702
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:16,231
- Can do.
- What's taking so long?

703
00:50:16,342 --> 00:50:18,572
- Pickup!
- Kronk, what are you doing?

704
00:50:18,678 --> 00:50:20,703
- Kind of busy here.
- Why am I not surprised?

705
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:23,749
Yo! Order's up!

706
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:28,150
Oh, well, while you're at it, make me
the special. And hold the gravy!

707
00:50:28,254 --> 00:50:31,712
- Check. Pickup!
- You know what? On second thought,
make my omelet a meat pie.

708
00:50:31,825 --> 00:50:34,851
- Meat pie. Check.
- Kronk!

709
00:50:34,961 --> 00:50:39,091
- Can I order the potatoes
as a side dish?
- I'll have to charge you full price.

710
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,600
- Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?
- You got it. Want cheese
on those potatoes?

711
00:50:42,702 --> 00:50:45,432
- Thank you, Kronk.
Cheddar will be fine.
- Cheddar spuds coming up.

712
00:50:45,538 --> 00:50:48,507
- Spuds yes, cheese no.
- Hold the cheese.
- No, I want the cheese.
- Cheese it is.

713
00:50:48,608 --> 00:50:51,907
- Cheese me no "likee."
- Cheese out.
- Cheese in!
- Come on. Make up your mind!

714
00:50:52,011 --> 00:50:54,741
- Okay, okay, on second thought,
make my potatoes a salad.
- Make my potatoes a salad.

715
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:15,097
Excuse me. You see
that woman over there?

716
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:17,499
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.

717
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:26,304
One, two, three, four
Happy, happy birthday
from all of us to you

718
00:51:26,412 --> 00:51:28,903
We wish it was our birthday
so we could party too

719
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:31,449
Happy, happy birthday
May all your dreams come true

720
00:51:31,551 --> 00:51:34,520
- We wish it was our birthday
so we could party too
- It's your birthday?

721
00:51:36,556 --> 00:51:39,923
- What are you doing?
- Look, there's two people in there
looking for you.

722
00:51:40,026 --> 00:51:42,119
- What?
- A big guy and a skinny old woman.

723
00:51:42,228 --> 00:51:44,560
Wait. Was this woman
scary beyond all reason?

724
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:47,224
- Oh, yeah.
- That's Yzma and Kronk. I'm saved!

725
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:50,700
-Trust me, they're not here to save you.
-They'll take me back to the palace.

726
00:51:50,803 --> 00:51:53,636
Thanks for your help. You've been great.
I can take it from here.

727
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,231
No, no, you don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.

728
00:51:56,342 --> 00:51:59,505
- Kill me? Their whole world
revolves around me.
- No, I can't let you!

729
00:51:59,612 --> 00:52:03,571
What? Wha...
Oh! Oh, I get it.

730
00:52:03,683 --> 00:52:05,742
- What?
- You don't want to take me
back to the palace.

731
00:52:05,852 --> 00:52:08,980
- You want to keep me
stranded out here forever.
- No!

732
00:52:09,088 --> 00:52:12,057
- This has all been an act,
and I almost fell for it.
- Will you just listen to me...

733
00:52:12,158 --> 00:52:16,356
No, no, you listen to me.
All you care about is
your-your stupid hilltop!

734
00:52:16,462 --> 00:52:19,522
- What?
- You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here. Go!

735
00:52:19,632 --> 00:52:22,533
- But-But...
- Go on! Get out of here!

736
00:52:22,635 --> 00:52:25,035
Fine!

737
00:52:25,138 --> 00:52:28,630
-Oh, this entire mess is all your fault.
-What'd I do?

738
00:52:28,741 --> 00:52:32,541
If you hadn't mixed up those poisons,
Kuzco would be dead now!

739
00:52:32,645 --> 00:52:37,082
There'll be no more diversions until
we track that llama down and kill him!

740
00:52:37,183 --> 00:52:41,483
Said I was sorry. Can't just let it go,
not even on your birthday.

741
00:52:41,587 --> 00:52:43,919
Kuzco must be eliminated.

742
00:52:44,023 --> 00:52:46,821
The empire will finally be rid
of that useless slug.

743
00:52:46,926 --> 00:52:51,863
Well, you got a point. Nobody really
seems to care that he's gone, do they?

744
00:52:54,334 --> 00:52:56,234
Pacha!

745
00:53:00,206 --> 00:53:02,606
Pacha?

746
00:53:39,278 --> 00:53:41,371
So this is where you came in.

747
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,506
See, just like I said,
I'm the victim here.

748
00:53:44,617 --> 00:53:47,381
I didn't do anything, and they ruined
my life and took everything I had.

749
00:53:47,486 --> 00:53:51,616
-Hey, give it a rest up there, will you?
-What? I'm just telling them
what happened.

750
00:53:51,724 --> 00:53:55,490
Who you kidding, pal? They saw the
whole thing. They know what happened.

751
00:53:55,594 --> 00:53:59,928
- Well, yeah, but... but...
-Just leave me alone.

752
00:54:27,692 --> 00:54:30,092
The peasant at the diner!

753
00:54:31,596 --> 00:54:33,621
He didn't pay his check.

754
00:54:44,776 --> 00:54:50,180
He's the peasant who I saw leaving
the city who disappeared into the crowd
with Kuzco on the back of his cart.

755
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:52,943
He must have taken him back to his
village, so if we find the village,
we find him...

756
00:54:53,051 --> 00:54:55,884
and if we find him, we find Kuzco.

757
00:54:55,987 --> 00:54:58,581
Oh, yeah,
it's all comin' together.

758
00:55:00,249 --> 00:55:02,012
- Yzma!
- What?

759
00:55:03,252 --> 00:55:05,584
This had better be good!

760
00:56:11,713 --> 00:56:15,376
So there we were standing on the cliff,
and the ground started to rumble.

761
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:20,009
And just as it started to go,
he grabbed me before I fell.

762
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:21,884
Do you believe that?

763
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:25,084
You know, call me crazy for following
this guy all the way out here...

764
00:56:25,193 --> 00:56:29,152
but as much as he tries to deny it,
I know there's some good in him.

765
00:56:29,264 --> 00:56:32,290
Besides, I couldn't just
leave him out here all alone.

766
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,527
He's a lousy llama.

767
00:56:34,636 --> 00:56:38,037
I mean,
a really lousy llama.

768
00:56:50,218 --> 00:56:52,652
Hey, listen, Pacha, you know...

769
00:56:52,754 --> 00:56:55,120
what I said to you
back at the diner, that-that...

770
00:56:55,223 --> 00:56:57,123
l-I didn't really...

771
00:56:58,293 --> 00:57:00,887
So, you tired of being a llama?

772
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:05,664
Yes!

773
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:08,668
Okay, we're just gonna stop at
the house and get some supplies.

774
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:10,795
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.

775
00:57:10,905 --> 00:57:13,601
Hey there, Pacha. Hey, you know,
you just missed your relatives.

776
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:16,677
- My relatives?
- Yeah. We just sent 'em
up to your house.

777
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:19,440
- What did they look like?
- Well, you see,
there was this big guy...

778
00:57:19,547 --> 00:57:22,175
and this older woman who was, uh...

779
00:57:22,283 --> 00:57:24,945
- How would you describe her?
- Scary beyond all reason.

780
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:26,884
Yeah, that's it.

781
00:57:27,081 --> 00:57:29,675
So remind me again how
you're related to Pacha?

782
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:33,446
Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's
wife's step-niece's great aunt.

783
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:38,585
Twice removed.

784
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:41,286
- Uh-huh.
- Isn't that right, Kronk?

785
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:43,920
Ninety-nine monkeys
jumpin'on the bed

786
00:57:44,031 --> 00:57:46,898
One fell off
and bumped his head

787
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:50,027
You know, I am so sorry that
you had to come all this way...

788
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:55,234
but as I said to you before,
you may recall, Pacha is not here.

789
00:57:55,342 --> 00:57:58,641
- I'll be sure and tell him you came by.
- Oh, would you, please?

790
00:57:58,746 --> 00:58:01,146
That would be just great.

791
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:03,648
Oops. Silly me.

792
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:06,049
No, no. Allow me.

793
00:58:11,058 --> 00:58:13,822
She's hiding something. When I give
the word, we search the house.

794
00:58:13,927 --> 00:58:16,555
Okay, but I still have
94 monkeys to go.

795
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:21,166
- So while we're waiting for Paca...
- Pacha.

796
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:23,168
Yeah, l...
Oh, yes.

797
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:26,262
Um, perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

798
00:58:26,373 --> 00:58:29,604
You know, why don't you just
come back when Pacha gets home?

799
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,941
I'm sure he'd love
to show you the...

800
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:34,810
Uh, excuse me, won't you?

801
00:58:34,915 --> 00:58:37,782
I think I left something
in the oven.

802
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:41,582
This is my variation of double Dutch.
On the signal, we switch places.

803
00:58:41,689 --> 00:58:43,657
- Kronk, it's time!
- Okay.

804
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:49,086
So we have to get back to the palace,
find the lab and change him back.

805
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:50,788
Hi there!

806
00:58:50,898 --> 00:58:53,526
- Um, that was him.
- Whoops.

807
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:58,905
You know what? I don't believe
you're really my great aunt.

808
00:58:59,006 --> 00:59:01,065
You're more like
my great-great-great...

809
00:59:01,175 --> 00:59:03,905
Go. I'll stall them long enough
for you two to get a head start.

810
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:08,607
- Thanks, honey.
- You have a lovely wife.
They're both very pretty.

811
00:59:08,716 --> 00:59:11,446
great-great-great-great-great...

812
00:59:11,552 --> 00:59:15,420
- All right! Are you through?
- great-great aunt.

813
00:59:15,522 --> 00:59:17,956
- So, where were we?
- Listen, sister,
we're not leaving until...

814
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:20,549
I show you the house.
Of course.

815
00:59:20,661 --> 00:59:23,221
Hey, was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

816
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:26,356
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

817
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:29,732
What do you mean, the door is stuck?
Try jiggling the handle.

818
00:59:29,837 --> 00:59:33,898
- There is no handle in here.
- There's not? Are you sure?

819
00:59:34,007 --> 00:59:36,202
All right,
I've had enough of this.

820
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:39,370
Tell us where the talking llama is,
and we'll burn your house to the ground.

821
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,108
Uh, don't you mean "or"?

822
00:59:42,216 --> 00:59:45,811
Tell us where the talking llama is,
or we'll burn your house to the ground.

823
00:59:45,919 --> 00:59:49,685
Well, which is it? That seems
like a pretty crucial conjunction.

824
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,122
That's it, Kronk!
Break the door down!

825
00:59:52,226 --> 00:59:55,354
Break it down? Are you kidding me?
This is hand-carved mahogany.

826
00:59:55,462 --> 00:59:59,193
I don't care, you fool. Get out of
my way. I'll break it down myself.

827
00:59:59,299 --> 01:00:02,291
- A-one!
- Okay, kids, you know what to do.

828
01:00:02,403 --> 01:00:04,303
- Two!
- Right, Mom!

829
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:06,999
Three!

830
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:19,511
Okay, children,
on your mark...

831
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,952
get set, go!

832
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:26,218
Stop it, you little brats!
Huh?

833
01:00:27,528 --> 01:00:32,488
Ow! Oh, there they go, Kronk!
And... They're getting away!

834
01:00:34,601 --> 01:00:36,728
Well, I had a great time.
Let's not wait...

835
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:39,328
until the next family reunion
to get together.

836
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,807
- Kronk!
- l, uh... I gotta run.

837
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:54,803
Okay, why does she even
have that lever?

838
01:01:56,549 --> 01:02:00,144
Please remain seated and keep your arms
and legs in at all times.

839
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:06,091
Huh?

840
01:02:07,693 --> 01:02:11,026
- What does it look like?
- I don't know. Just keep looking.

841
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:13,325
Over here!
It has to be one of these.

842
01:02:13,432 --> 01:02:15,957
Lions, tigers, bears...

843
01:02:16,068 --> 01:02:17,729
Oh, my.

844
01:02:17,837 --> 01:02:19,737
Looking for this?

845
01:02:22,074 --> 01:02:25,475
No! It can't be! How did you
get back here before us?

846
01:02:25,578 --> 01:02:29,070
Uh... How did we, Kronk?

847
01:02:29,181 --> 01:02:33,015
Well, ya got me. By all accounts,
it doesn't make sense.

848
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,314
Oh, well, back to business.

849
01:02:35,421 --> 01:02:38,390
Okay, I admit it. Maybe I wasn't
as nice as I should have been.

850
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:41,289
But, Yzma, do you
really want to kill me?

851
01:02:41,394 --> 01:02:44,522
Just think of it
as you're being let go...

852
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,928
that your life's going
in a different direction...

853
01:02:47,033 --> 01:02:50,525
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

854
01:02:50,636 --> 01:02:53,901
Hey, that's kind of like what he said
to you when you got fired.

855
01:02:54,006 --> 01:02:56,474
I know.
It's called a cruel irony...

856
01:02:56,576 --> 01:02:58,806
like my dependence on you.

857
01:02:58,911 --> 01:03:02,813
- I can't believe this is happening!
- Then I bet you weren't expecting this.

858
01:03:02,915 --> 01:03:04,974
No!

859
01:03:05,084 --> 01:03:07,348
- Aha!
- Oh, okay.

860
01:03:08,387 --> 01:03:11,550
Finish them off.

861
01:03:11,657 --> 01:03:14,785
Hey, you're not backing down now,
are you, big guy?

862
01:03:16,028 --> 01:03:17,928
Uh, where's the other guy?

863
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:22,462
- Yo!
- Sorry I'm late. So what'd I miss?

864
01:03:22,568 --> 01:03:26,504
Well, Yzma just tossed me this knife and
asked me to, you know, take them out.

865
01:03:26,606 --> 01:03:30,702
And then this guy popped up and then
we waited for you, and quite honestly...

866
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:33,574
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

867
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:36,671
This one simple thing.
It's like I'm talking to a monkey.

868
01:03:36,782 --> 01:03:40,878
- Whoa now!
- A really, really
big stupid monkey named Kronk!

869
01:03:40,987 --> 01:03:43,217
-Ouch.
-And do you want to know something else?

870
01:03:43,322 --> 01:03:46,052
I've never liked
your spinach puffs.

871
01:03:46,158 --> 01:03:48,058
Never!

872
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:53,365
- That's it. She's going down.
- Now, now, remember, guys.

873
01:03:53,466 --> 01:03:56,492
From above, the wicked shall
receive their just reward.

874
01:03:59,939 --> 01:04:01,839
That'll work.

875
01:04:08,347 --> 01:04:11,976
- Strange. That usually works.
- And so does this!

876
01:04:12,084 --> 01:04:15,076
Ah. Should have seen
that coming. Whoa!

877
01:04:17,356 --> 01:04:19,881
Give me that vial!

878
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,230
Oops. Clumsy me.

879
01:04:31,671 --> 01:04:33,730
Which one? Which one?

880
01:04:36,308 --> 01:04:39,072
Better hurry.
I'm expecting company.

881
01:04:42,548 --> 01:04:46,177
Kill them!
They murdered the emperor!

882
01:04:46,285 --> 01:04:49,049
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me... Kuzco!

883
01:04:49,155 --> 01:04:51,783
- They're not listening to me!
-Just take 'em all.

884
01:05:00,499 --> 01:05:03,662
- Get them!
- Hey, I've been turned into a cow.

885
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:07,205
- Can I go home?
- You're excused. Anyone else?

886
01:05:07,306 --> 01:05:10,070
- No, we're good.
- Yeah, we're-we're good.
- Get them!

887
01:05:10,176 --> 01:05:12,770
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.

888
01:05:15,414 --> 01:05:17,314
Uh, Pacha?
Little help!

889
01:05:19,985 --> 01:05:22,453
Come on! Come on!

890
01:05:28,894 --> 01:05:31,362
Oh, please be
something with wings.

891
01:05:33,365 --> 01:05:37,768
Yeah! We're flyin'!
Uh-oh.

892
01:05:43,275 --> 01:05:46,005
We're not getting anywhere
with you picking the vials.
I'm picking the next one.

893
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:48,945
- Fine by me!
- Give me that one.

894
01:05:50,282 --> 01:05:52,182
Don't you say a word.

895
01:05:57,289 --> 01:06:00,315
Quick!
Drain the canals!

896
01:06:00,426 --> 01:06:02,326
Open up!

897
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:07,431
Yea! I'm a llama again!

898
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:09,433
Wait.

899
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:20,144
- There they go! After them!
- Come on, men!

900
01:06:20,246 --> 01:06:22,373
Nobody lives forever! Charge!

901
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:43,863
Okay, only two left.
It's gotta be one of these.

902
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:50,441
No!

903
01:07:00,352 --> 01:07:02,252
I'll take that.

904
01:07:02,354 --> 01:07:05,016
This is the one.
This'll change you back to a human.

905
01:07:05,124 --> 01:07:07,456
Ow! Hey, get her off!

906
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,427
Ow! Get her off me!

907
01:07:19,171 --> 01:07:22,800
- Drink the potion!
- Okay, okay!

908
01:07:22,908 --> 01:07:27,140
- Where did it go? Where is it?
- Looking for this?

909
01:07:27,246 --> 01:07:31,307
Is that my voice?
Is that my voice?

910
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:33,783
- Oh, well.
- No, no! Don't drop it!

911
01:07:33,886 --> 01:07:36,354
I'm not going to drop it,
you fool!

912
01:07:36,455 --> 01:07:38,389
I'm going to drink it!

913
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:41,323
And once I turn back
into my beautiful self...

914
01:07:41,427 --> 01:07:43,895
I'm going to kill you!

915
01:07:53,706 --> 01:07:56,436
Oh! Uh-oh.

916
01:08:16,695 --> 01:08:19,493
- Kuzco!
- Be right there! Give me a minute!

917
01:08:22,201 --> 01:08:24,692
Kuzco! Whoa!

918
01:08:25,804 --> 01:08:27,704
Kuzco!

919
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,175
The vial!

920
01:08:44,056 --> 01:08:47,753
For the last time,
we did not order a giant trampoline.

921
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:50,795
You know, pal, you could have
told me that before I set it up.

922
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:09,873
The vial!
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

923
01:09:29,335 --> 01:09:31,428
- I win.
- Whoa.

924
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:35,035
Got it!

925
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:38,041
What are the odds of
that trap door leadin' me out here?

926
01:09:45,684 --> 01:09:48,209
Here, uh, let me
get this for you.

927
01:09:50,756 --> 01:09:53,657
Well, see ya
on the other side.

928
01:10:03,061 --> 01:10:06,292
Oh, now, you-you-you stop
being so hard on yourself.

929
01:10:06,398 --> 01:10:08,298
- All is forgiven.
- You're sure?

930
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,700
Oh, it's not the first time
I was tossed out a window,
and it won't be the last.

931
01:10:12,804 --> 01:10:14,772
What can I say?
I'm a rebel.

932
01:10:14,873 --> 01:10:16,773
Whoa-ho-ho, tiger.
Oh, hey!

933
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:19,969
I gotta use that arm later.
Okay, buddy, take care.

934
01:10:21,746 --> 01:10:23,680
He's a sweet guy.

935
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:35,256
So, you lied to me.

936
01:10:36,995 --> 01:10:38,929
- I did?
- Yeah. You said...

937
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:42,466
when the sun hits this ridge
just right, these hills sing.

938
01:10:42,567 --> 01:10:44,694
Well, pal, I was dragged
all over those hills...

939
01:10:44,803 --> 01:10:48,000
and I did not hear any singing.

940
01:10:50,508 --> 01:10:55,241
So I'll be building my summer home
on a more magical hill.

941
01:10:55,347 --> 01:10:57,542
Thank you.

942
01:10:59,618 --> 01:11:01,609
Couldn't pull the wool
over your eyes, huh?

943
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,847
No, no, I'm sharp.
I'm on it.

944
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:07,118
Looks like you and your family are stuck
on the tuneless hilltop forever, pal.

945
01:11:16,267 --> 01:11:21,398
You know, I'm pretty sure I heard
some singing on the hill next to us.

946
01:11:21,506 --> 01:11:23,406
In case you're interested.

947
01:11:27,412 --> 01:11:31,178
- Ha! Boom, baby!
- Ha! Boom, baby!

948
01:11:35,253 --> 01:11:37,915
You'd be the coolest dude
in the nation

949
01:11:38,023 --> 01:11:40,116
Or the hippest cat in creation

950
01:11:40,225 --> 01:11:43,194
But if you ain't got friends
then nothing's worth the fuss

951
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:46,861
A perfect world will come to be

952
01:11:46,965 --> 01:11:49,092
When everybody here can see

953
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,600
That a perfect world begins and ends

954
01:11:51,703 --> 01:11:53,830
A perfect world begins and ends

955
01:11:53,938 --> 01:11:56,634
A perfect world
begins and ends with us

956
01:11:58,343 --> 01:12:01,779
- "My acorn is missing."
- Squeak, squeakin', squeak, squeakity.

957
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,611
- "Did you eat the acorn?"
- Squeaker, squeak, squeak, squeakin'?

958
01:12:05,717 --> 01:12:10,211
- "You owe me a new acorn."
- Squeak, squeak, squeak,
squeak, squeaker...

959
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:13,149
- Squeakin'.
- I'm so proud of you guys.

960
01:12:18,721 --> 01:12:22,885
In the quiet time of evening

961
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:29,160
When the stars assume their patterns

962
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,902
And the day has made his journey

963
01:12:37,172 --> 01:12:41,734
And we wondered just what happened

964
01:12:41,844 --> 01:12:44,608
To the life we knew

965
01:12:44,713 --> 01:12:47,876
Before the world changed

966
01:12:47,983 --> 01:12:50,781
When not a thing I had

967
01:12:50,886 --> 01:12:52,820
Was true

968
01:12:55,624 --> 01:12:58,525
But you were kind to me

969
01:12:58,627 --> 01:13:01,824
And you reminded me

970
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:05,889
That the world
is not my playground

971
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:12,029
There are other things that matter

972
01:13:14,143 --> 01:13:17,442
And what is simple needs protecting

973
01:13:20,249 --> 01:13:24,777
Or my illusions all would shatter

974
01:13:24,887 --> 01:13:27,822
But you stayed

975
01:13:27,923 --> 01:13:31,757
In my corner

976
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:35,853
The only world I know
was upside-down

977
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:41,670
And now the world and me

978
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:44,204
We know you carry me

979
01:13:44,306 --> 01:13:50,142
You see the patterns
in the big sky

980
01:13:50,245 --> 01:13:56,115
Those constellations look
like you and I

981
01:13:56,218 --> 01:14:02,054
Just like the patterns
in the big sky

982
01:14:02,157 --> 01:14:07,322
We could be lost
we could refuse to try

983
01:14:07,429 --> 01:14:10,364
But we made it through

984
01:14:10,466 --> 01:14:14,061
In the dark night

985
01:14:14,169 --> 01:14:18,105
Who would those lucky guys
turn out to be

986
01:14:20,976 --> 01:14:23,809
But that unusual blend

987
01:14:23,912 --> 01:14:27,871
Of my funny friend and me

988
01:14:32,955 --> 01:14:36,152
I'm not as clever as I thought I was

989
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:44,126
I'm not the boy
I used to be because

990
01:14:44,233 --> 01:14:46,167
You show me somethin' different

991
01:14:46,268 --> 01:14:49,897
You show me somethin' pure

992
01:14:50,005 --> 01:14:55,068
I always seemed so certain
but I was really never sure

993
01:14:55,177 --> 01:14:57,941
But you stayed

994
01:14:58,046 --> 01:15:01,812
And you called my name

995
01:15:01,917 --> 01:15:05,614
When others would have walked out
on a lousy game

996
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:11,223
And look who made it through

997
01:15:11,326 --> 01:15:13,521
But your funny friend and me

998
01:15:13,629 --> 01:15:19,761
- You see the patterns in the big sky
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

999
01:15:19,868 --> 01:15:25,272
Those constellations look
like you and I

1000
01:15:25,374 --> 01:15:31,074
That tiny planet
and the bigger guy

1001
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:37,119
I don't know whether
I should laugh or cry

1002
01:15:37,219 --> 01:15:42,657
-Just like the patterns in the big sky
- We'll be together

1003
01:15:42,758 --> 01:15:46,489
We'll be together
till the end this time

1004
01:15:46,595 --> 01:15:48,586
You don't know
you don't know

1005
01:15:48,697 --> 01:15:54,363
-Don't know the answer or the reason why
-We'll stick together

1006
01:15:54,470 --> 01:16:00,272
We'll stick together
till the day we die

1007
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:04,072
If I had to do this all
a second time

1008
01:16:06,415 --> 01:16:10,078
I won't complain or make a fuss

1009
01:16:12,955 --> 01:16:15,685
Who would the angels send

1010
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:18,726
But that unlikely blend

1011
01:16:18,827 --> 01:16:21,955
Of those two funny friends

1012
01:16:22,064 --> 01:16:25,033
That's us
