Dinghy ahoy.

Dinghy off the port bow.

4
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,167
- Dinghy off the port bow!
- Dinghy off the port bow!

5
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,468
Dinghy off the port bow.

00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,043
- Captain, dinghy off the...

00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,115
I got it!

8
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,045
I got it.

9
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,658
Where is it?

10
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,620
It's right here, captain.

11
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,432
I never thought I'd see it
with me own eye.

I'd rather not discuss

Look, there he is.

35
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,531
Talk to me, Krabs.

36
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:26,569
It started out as a simple order:
A Krabby Patty with cheese.

37
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,638
When the customer took a bite,

38
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,605
no cheese!

39
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,205
Get ahold of yourself, Eugene.
I'm going in.

40
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,776
Take it easy, friend. I'm the manager
of this establishment.

41
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,980
Everything's gonna be just fine.

42
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,717
- I'm really scared here, man.
- You got a name?

43
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,519
- Phil.
- You got a family, Phil?

44
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,593
Come on, Phil, stay with me.
Let's hear about that family.

45
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,532
I got a wife
and two beautiful children.

46
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,037
That's what it's all about.
I want you to do me a favor, Phil.

00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,732
What?

48
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,706
Say cheese.

49
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,787
Order up.

50
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,360

And it's finally gonna
come true. Today.

Sorry about this, calendar.

58
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:52,684
Because today is the grand-opening
ceremony for The Krusty Krab 2,

59
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,521
where Mr. Krabs will announce
the new manager.

SpongeBob!
What are you doing in here?

69
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,174
I have to tell you something,
Squidward.

70
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,475
Whatever it is,
can't it wait until we get to work?

71
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,676
- There's no shower at work.
- What do you want?

72
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,650
I just wanted to say
I'll be thanking you

73
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,949
in my managerial acceptance
speech today.

74
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,718
Get out!

75
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,794
Okay. I'll see you at the ceremony.

76
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,489
That sounds like the manager
of the new Krusty Krab 2.

77
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,669
Oops. Hold on.

78
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,135
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Oh, thanks, Patrick.

79
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,208
And tonight, after my big promotion,
we're gonna party till we're purple.

00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,935
I love being purple!

81
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,138
We're going to the place
where all the action is.

82
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,715
- You don't mean...?

86
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,431
I'd better get going.

I'm ready. Promotion.
I'm ready. Promotion.

88

Good luck, SpongeBob.
Hey, look for me at the ceremony.

89
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,375

Hello, Bikini Bottom!

92
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,652
Perch Perkins here, coming
to you live from in front of

93
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,049
The Krusty Krab restaurant,

94
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,690
for years the only place
to get a delicious

95
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,828
and mouthwatering Krabby Patty.
Until today, that is.

96
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,694
That's right, folks. Longtime owner
Mr. Krabs is opening a new restaurant

97
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,995
called The Krusty Krab 2.

98
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,966
First of all,
congratulations, Mr. Krabs.

99
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,200
Hello. I like money.

100
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,141
What inspired you to build
a second Krusty Krab

101
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,338
right next door to the original?

102
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,039
Money.

103
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,312
Curses!

104
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,747
It's not fair.

105
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,551
Krabs is being interviewed
by Perch Perkins,

106
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,489
and I've never even had
one customer!

107
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:27,399
<i>Don't get worked up again, Plankton,
I just mopped the floors.</i>

108
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:32,010
Oh, Karen, my computer wife,
if only I could have managed to steal

109
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,974
the secret to Krabs' success,

110
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,513
the formula for the Krabby Patty.

111
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:42,716
Then people would line up
to eat at my restaurant.

112
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,584
Lord knows I've tried.

113
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:51,089
I've exhausted every evil plan
in my filing cabinet...

114
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,232
<i>...from A to Y.
- A to Y?</i>

115
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,367
Yeah, A to Y.
You know, the alphabet.

116
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,036
<i>What about Z?</i>

117
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:02,173
<i>- Z?
- Z. The letter after Y.</i>

118
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,571
W, X, Y,

119
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,039
Z. Plan Z!

120
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,681
<i>- Here it is, just like you said.
- Oh, boy.</i>

121
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,411
It's evil.

122
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,419
It's diabolical.

123
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,455
It's lemon-scented.

124
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,255
This Plan Z can't possibly fail!

125
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,027
So enjoy today, Mr. Krabs,

126
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,101
because by tomorrow,
I'll have the formula.

127
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,101
Then everyone will eat
at the Chum Bucket,

128
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,968
and I will rule the world!

129
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,702
All hail Plankton. All hail Plank...!

130
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,780
I'm ready. Promotion.
I'm ready. Promotion.

131
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,008
I think I stepped in something.

132
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:53,552
Not in something,
on someone, you twit.

133
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,953
Sorry, Plankton.

134
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,990
Are you on your way
to the grand-opening ceremony?

135
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,655
No, I am not on my way over
to the grand-opening ceremony.

136
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:06,895
I'm busy planning to rule the world!

137
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,535
Well, good luck with that.

138
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:13,769
I'm ready. Promotion.
I'm ready. Promotion.

139
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,607
Stupid kid.

140
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,250
Welcome. Welcome, everyone,
to the grand opening

141
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,547
of The Krusty Krab 2.

142
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,085
- We paid $9 for this?
- I paid 10.

143
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,262
Now, before we begin
with the ribbon-cutting,

144
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,092
I'd like to announce the name
of our new manager.

145
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,825
Yay! Yeah!

146
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,738
Yeah! Now we're talking! Yeah!

147
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,410
Yes. Well, anyway...

148
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:50,878
The new manager is a loyal,
hard-working employee.

149
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,614
<i>Yes.</i>

150
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,979
The obvious choice for the job.

151
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,381
<i>He's right.</i>

152
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,956
A name you all know.
It starts with an S.

153
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,095
<i>- That's me.
- Please welcome our new manager...</i>

154
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,389
...Squidward Tentacles.

155
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:10,160
Yes! Yeah!

156
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,535
Oh, better luck next time, buddy.

157
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:18,976
Yeah! All right!

158
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,014
People of Bikini Bottom,
as the manager of...

159
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,411
SpongeBob.

160
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,884
Hold the phone, folks, I'm getting an
important news flash from Mr. Krabs.

161
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,784
Go ahead, Mr. K.

162
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,185
I'm making a complete what
of myself?

163
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,461
The most embarrassing thing
you've ever seen?

164
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,062
And now it's worse
because I'm repeating

165
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,998
everything you say
into the microphone?

166
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:49,368
Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob,
you didn't get the job.

167
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:54,772
- What?
- You did not get the job.

168
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,874
But... But why?

169
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,218
SpongeBob, you're a great fry cook,

170
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,719
but I gave the job to Squidward
because being manager

171
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,051
is a big responsibility.

172
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,319
Well, let's face it, he's more...

173
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,724
...mature than you.
- I'm not...

174
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,229
...mature?

175
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,891
Lad, I mean this
in the nicest of ways,

176
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,799
but there's a word for what you are,

177
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,563
and that word is...

178
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,537
Now, let's see...

179
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,440
- Dork?
- No, wait, that's not right. Not a dork.

180
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,479
- A goofball?
- Closer, but no, no, no.

181
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,150
- A ding-a-ling.
- Wing nut.

182
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,114
A Knucklehead McSpazatron.

183
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,947
Okay, that's enough.

184
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:40,216
Look, what I'm trying to say is,
you're just a kid.

185
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,156
And to be a manager,
you have to be a man.

186
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,762
Otherwise they'd call it "kid-ager. "

187
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:49,298
You understand-ager?
I mean, you understand?

188
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,560
I guess so, Mr. Krabs.

189
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,068
SpongeBob?

190
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,301
I'm ready. Depression.

191
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,413
I'm ready. Depression.

192
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,440
Poor kid.

193
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,780
Hooray for SpongeBob!

194
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,592
Hooray for SpongeBob!

195
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,025
Let's hear it for SpongeBob!

196
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,462
Hello?

197
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,830
Where'd everybody go?

198
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,666
Did I miss something?

199
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,342
Did you see my butt?

200
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,740
<i>Later that evening...</i>

201
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,350
Time to put Plan Z into effect.

202
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:43,851
Starting at the undersea castle
of King Neptune.

203
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,768
Oh, right.

204
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,701
The royal court is now in session.

205
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,966
Bring the prisoner forward.

206
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:13,681
So you have confessed to the crime
of touching the king's crown.

207
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,649
- Yes, but...
- But what?

208
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,723
But it's my job, Your Highness.
I'm the royal crown polisher.

209
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:24,259
Well, then I guess
I can't execute you.

210
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,830
- Twenty years in the dungeon it is.
- Daddy.

211
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,768
You're free to go.

212
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,029
Bless you, Princess Mindy.

213
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,270
Mindy, how dare you defy me.

214
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,910
Why do you have to be so mean?

215
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:43,843
I am the king.
I must enforce the laws of the sea.

216
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,609
Father, I wish you'd try
a little love and compassion

217
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,343
instead of these harsh punishments.

218
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,385
That would be nice.

219
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,557
Squire, clear the room.

220
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,693
I wish to speak
to my daughter alone.

221
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,563
What is this, Mindy?

222
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,858
- Your crown?
- And what does this crown do?

223
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,594
- Covers your bald spot.
- It's not bald, it's

224
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,101
thinning.

225
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:12,710
This crown does much more
than cover a slightly receding hairline.

226
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:18,316
No, this crown entitles the one who
wears it to be in charge of the sea.

227
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,747
One day, you will wear this crown.

228
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,045
I'm gonna be bald?

229
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,716
Thinning!

230
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,517
Anyway, the point is,
you won't wear it

231
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,990
until you learn how to rule
with an iron fist.

232
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,095
Like your father.

233
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,896
Dad, your "crown"...

234
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,334
What the...?

235
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,631
My crown!

236
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,873
Someone has stolen
the royal crown!

237
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,637
I got it. I got it.

238
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,256
Hey, all you Goobers,
it's time to say howdy

239
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:08,229
to your favorite undersea peanut,
Goofy Goober.

240
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,600
Howdy, Goofy Goober!

241
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,104
Hey, fellow Goofy Goobers.
Time to sing.

242
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:21,507
<i>Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah
You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

243
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:26,048
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

244
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,559
All right. Get it together, old boy.

245
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,727
I know. I'll just stop thinking about it.

246
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,806
Hey, you know,
I actually feel a little better.

247
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,840
I don't even remember
why I was sad.

248
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:56,105
Hey, it's the new
Krusty Krab 2 manager.

249
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,579
Wow, the pressure's
already setting in.

250
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,017
No, Pat, you don't understand.

251
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,815
I didn't get the promotion.

252
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,817
What? Why?

253
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,427
Mr. Krabs thinks I'm a kid.

254
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,764
- What? That's insane.
- I know.

255
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:17,231
Well, saying you're a kid,
it's like saying I'm a kid.

256
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,395
- Here's your Goober Meal, sir.
- I'm supposed to get a toy with this.

257
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,165
Thanks.

258
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,708
I'm gonna head home, Pat.
The celebration's off.

259
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,712
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm not in a Goober mood.

260
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,407
Okay, see you.

261
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,055
And here's your Triple
Gooberberry Sunrise, sir.

262
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,150
Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, huh?

263
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,157
I guess I could use one of those.

264
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,057
Now you're talking.

265
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,631
Hey, waiter, we need
another one over here.

266
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,064
There you go.

267
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,604
Boy, Pat, that hit the spot.

268
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,375
- I'm feeling better already.
- Yeah.

269
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,712
Waiter, let's get
another round over here.

270
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,891
Oh, Mr. Waiter. Two more, please.

271
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,296
Waiter.

272
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,261
Oh, waiter.

273
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,336
Waiter.

274
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,803
Waiter.

275
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,273
- Waiter!
- Why do I always get the nuts?

276
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:37,609
All right, folks, this one goes out
to my two bestest friends

277
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,408
in the whole world:

278
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,451
Patrick and this big peanut guy.

279
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,747
It's a little ditty called...

280
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:49,189
..."Waiter!"

281
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,761
Hey. Hey, get up.

282
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,991
Hey, come on, buddy.
I wanna go home.

283
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,463
Come on, pal.

284
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,035
Oh, my head.

285
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,573
Listen to me. It's 8 in the morning.

286
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,471
Go scrape up your friend
and get going.

287
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,771
My friend?

288
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,382
Patrick. Hey, what's up, buddy?

289
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,781
Wait, you said 8:00.

290
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:20,049
I'm late for work.
Mr. Krabs is gonna be...

291
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,423
Mr. Krabs.

292
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,388
Now, pay attention, Squidward.

293
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,558
As new manager, you've gotta keep
a sharp eye out for paying customers.

294
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,737
Yawn.

295
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:38,302
What's this? King Neptune is riding
toward The Krusty Krab at lunchtime.

296
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,307
He's got money.

297
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,306
Stay in the coach, daughter.
This won't take long.

298
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,713
Daddy, please.
I think you're overreacting.

299
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,516
Silence, Mindy.
I know what I'm doing.

300
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,589
- Squire.
- Yes, Your Highness.

301
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,261
Have this pole executed at once.

302
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:01,454
A hundred and one dollars
for a Krabby Patty?

303
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:05,034
With cheese, Mr. Squidward,
with cheese.

304
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,508
Greeting, subjects.

305
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,405
I seek the one known
as Eugene Krabs.

306
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,706
May he present himself
to me at once.

307
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:21,011
I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness.
Would you like to order something?

308
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,383
Nay! I'm on to you, Krabs!

309
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,650
You have stolen the royal crown,
you cannot deny.

310
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,383
For, clever as you are,

311
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,793
you left one damning piece of evidence
at the scene of the crime.

312
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,729
"I stole your crown.
Signed, Eugene Krabs. "

313
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,460
Relinquish the royal crown
to me at once.

314
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,663
But... But this is crazy. I didn't do it.

315
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:46,640
<i>Ahoy, this is Eugene Krabs.
Leave a message.</i>

316
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:51,043
<i>Hi, Mr. Krabs. This is Clay,
the guy you sold Neptune's crown to.</i>

317
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,344
<i>Yeah, I just wanted to say
thanks again for selling me the crown.</i>

318
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,954
<i>Neptune's crown.
I sold it to a guy in Shell City,</i>

319
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,989
<i>and I just wanted to say thanks again
for selling me the crown.</i>

320
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,127
<i>Neptune's crown.</i>

321
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,992
<i>Which is now in Shell City.
Goodbye.</i>

322
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,164
Don't you just hate wrong numbers?

323
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,135
My crown is in
the forbidden Shell City?!

324
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,507
Plan Z. I love Plan Z.

325
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,477
Prepare to burn, Krabs.

326
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,213
Wait, Neptune.
Please, I'm begging you.

327
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:35,154
I ain't a crook.
Ask anyone, they'll vouch for me.

328
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,690
Very well, then.

329
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,526
Before I turn this conniving
crustacean into fishmeal,

330
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:46,796
who here has anything to say
about Eugene Krabs?

331
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:53,536
I've got something to say
about Mr. Krabs.

332
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,441
SpongeBob, me boy,
you've come just in time.

333
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,116
- Pardon me, miss.
- Please, tell King Neptune

334
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,013
all about me.

335
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:05,588
I have worked for Mr. Krabs
for many years

336
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,784
and always thought
he was a great boss.

337
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,394
You see? A great boss.

338
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:16,226
I now realize
that he's a great big jerk!

339
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,528
I deserve that manager's job!

340
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:24,801
But you didn't give it to me,
because you say I'm a kid.

341
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,071
Well, I am 100-percent man!

342
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:35,186
And this man has got
something to say to you.

343
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:46,625
There. I think I made my point.

344
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,993
Anyone else?

345
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,431
No? Well, then.

346
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,601
Me pants are on fire!

347
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,176
Me underwear's on fire!

348
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,678
I'm on fire!

349
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,376
Oh, yeah.

350
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:11,522
And now, Eugene Krabs, you will...

351
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,985
Wait.

352
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,985
I'm flattered you would do this
on my account,

353
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,924
but being manager
isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over.

354
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:23,727
Quiet, fool! Mr. Krabs stole my crown,
and now it's in Shell City.

355
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,836
- That's why he must die.
- Doesn't it seem a little harsh

356
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,471
to kill someone over a crown?

357
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,609
You don't understand. My crown
is a symbol of my king-like authority.

358
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,405
And between you and me...

359
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,013
...my hair is thinning a bit.

360
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:41,549
Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not
that notice... Bald. Bald.

361
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,620
- Bald! Bald!
- Bald! Bald!

362
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,585
My eyes!

363
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,384
All right, all right.

364
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,390
King Neptune, sir?

365
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,962
Would you spare Mr. Krabs' life
if I went to get your crown back?

366
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,499
You, go to Shell City?

367
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,374
No one who's gone to Shell City
has ever returned.

368
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:10,981
What makes you think you could?
You're just a kid.

369
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,081
But I'm not a kid. I can do it.

370
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,948
Run along, I have a crab to cook.

371
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,415
No! I won't let you.

372
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,455
Very well, then.

373
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,687
I'll have to fry you both.

374
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,194
Daddy, stop it.

375
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,525
Can't you get through one day
without executing someone?

376
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:33,533
Mindy. I told you
to stay in the carriage.

377
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,330
Where's your love and compassion?

378
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,298
Look at this little guy.

379
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,945
He's willing to risk his life
to find your crown and save his boss.

380
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,376
- But, daughter, I...
- Please, Father?

381
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,517
At least let him try.
What have you got to lose?

382
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,846
Might I remind you
of your special problem?

383
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:54,287
- Bald! Bald! Bald!
- Bald!

384
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,085
- Bald! Bald!
- My eyes!

385
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,761
All right.

386
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,396
Very well, Mindy.

387
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,088
I'll give him a chance.

388
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,564
But when your little champion
fails to return,

389
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,136
I get to splatter this crab
all over the walls.

390
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,834
And as for you, be back here
with my crown in exactly ten days.

391
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,568
- He can do it in nine.
- Eight.

392
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,973
- Seven.
- Six.

393
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,206
- Patrick!
- Patrick!

394
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,713
Six it is, then.

395
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,045
- Five.
- Patrick, shush.

396
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:26,588
Until then, the crab shall remain
frozen where he now stands.

397
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,759
No, wait. I'm begging you.

398
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,323
Who turned on the AC? Mr. Krabs!

399
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,392
Oh, no, this is terrible.

400
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,263
Who's gonna sign my paycheck?

401
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,961
Come along, Mindy.

402
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,871
Listen, you guys, the road
to Shell City is really dangerous.

403
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,738
There's crooks, killers
and monsters everywhere.

404
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,743
And what's worse,
there's a giant Cyclops

405
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,247
who guards the outskirts of the city
and preys on innocent sea creatures.

406
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,646
Don't let him catch you,
because if he does,

407
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,652
he'll take you back to his lair,
and you'll never be seen again.

408
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,291
She's purty, SpongeBob.

409
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,755
Here, take this.

410
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,451
What's in here?

411
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,955
It's a magical bag of winds.

412
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,793
- I stole them from my father.
- You're hot.

413
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,969
Once you find the crown,
open the bag of winds

414
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,501
and you'll be blown back home.

415
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,536
- Mindy!
- I'm coming.

416
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,937
- Good luck, SpongeBob.
- Wait. How did you know my name?

417
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,941
Oh, I'm gonna be
queen of the sea one day.

418
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,239
I've learned the names
of all the sea creatures.

419
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,972
What's my name?

420
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,276
That's easy. You're Patrick Star.

421
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,258
- Mindy!
- I gotta go. I believe in you guys.

422
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,654
Thanks, Mindy.

423
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,156
Don't worry, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick, Squidward and I...

424
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,798
Pass.

425
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,730
- Patrick and I...
- Hi.

426
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,600
...are gonna get that crown back
and save you from Neptune's wrath.

427
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:54,142
You've got nothing to worry about.
Your life is in our hands.

428
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,210
Patrick, let's go get that crown.

429
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,763
- Feast your eyes, Patrick.
- What is it?

430
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,940
The Patty Wagon.

431
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,674
Mr. Krabs uses it
for promotional reasons.

432
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,607
Let me show you
some of its features.

433
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,509
Sesame-seed finish,
steel-belted pickles,

434
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,184
grilled-leather interior.
And under the hood,

435
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:38,686
a fuel-injected french-fryer
with dual overhead grease traps.

436
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,121
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

437
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,396
Hey, I thought you didn't have
a driver's license.

438
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,465
You don't need a license
to drive a sandwich.

439
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:04,406
- Shell City, here we come!
- Shell City, here we come!

440
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,319
Ding-a-ling.

441
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,354
Hey there, old buddy. Freeze.

442
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,390
One secret formula to go, please.

443
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,996
No, no, don't trouble yourself.
I'll get it.

444
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:27,500
Well, I'd like to hang around,
but I've got Krabby Patties to make...

445
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,236
...over at the Chum Bucket.

446
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:34,742
Plan Z, I love you.

447
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:45,412
<i>Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah
You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

448
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,524
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

449
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,690
Fill her up, please.

450
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:59,669
What'll it be, fellas,
mustard or ketchup?

451
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,141
Are they laughing at us?

452
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,970
No, Patrick,
they're laughing next to us.

453
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,614
Where you two dumb kids
headed, anyway?

454
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,680
- Kids?
- Now, Patrick.

455
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,285
For your information,
we are not kids, we are men.

456
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:20,219
And we're off to get
King Neptune's crown in Shell City.

457
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,915
- Shell City?
- Shell City?

458
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:26,826
Ain't that the place that's guarded
by a killer Cyclops?

459
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,225
That's right.

460
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,368
Lloyd, take off your hat in respect.

461
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,264
Respect for the dead!

462
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,480
You two dipsticks ain't gonna last
ten seconds over the county line.

463
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:47,879
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.

464
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,718
Out of the car, fellas.

465
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,890
How many seconds was that?

466
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,158
Twelve.

467
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,427
- In your face.
- In your face.

468
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,268
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

469
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,946
Who's the kid now?

470
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,775
They're dead.

471
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,019
Perch Perkins here
with an incredible news flash.

472
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,749
Plankton is selling Krabby Patties
at the Chum Bucket.

473
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,190
How is this possible? Let's find out.

474
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,388
Step right up. Plenty for everybody.

475
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,090
<i>Excuse me, Plankton.
Perch Perkins, Bikini Bottom News.</i>

476
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:40,669
- Can I get a minute?
- Anything for you, Perch.

477
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:44,535
All of Bikini Bottom wants to know,
how did you get the Krabby Patty?

478
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,644
Well, Perch, before my dear friend
Eugene Krabs

479
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,010
was frozen by King Neptune...

480
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,878
I'm sorry.

481
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,151
He confided in me a secret wish.

482
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:01,815
"Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence
at the Chum Bucket," he said.

483
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,620
"Don't let the flame die out. "

484
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,231
By the way, act now and you get
a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet

485
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,336
with every purchase.
Here you go, Perch.

486
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,099
- Thanks.
- Bucket helmets for everyone!

487
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,335
My helmet!

488
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,015
Karen, baby, I haven't felt this giddy

489
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,778
since the day you agreed
to be my wife.

490
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,250
<i>I never agreed.</i>

491
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:34,254
Evil Plan Z is working perfectly.

492
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,427
Nothing can stop me now.

493
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:39,188
<i>Nothing except SpongeBob
and his pink friend.</i>

494
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:43,791
<i>My sensors indicate
that they're going after the crown.</i>

495
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:47,597
<i>If they make it back, Neptune might
discover some fingerprints.</i>

496
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,773
<i>Tiny fingerprints.</i>

497
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,504
<i>Stubby, tiny fingerprints.</i>

498
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,646
Evil Plan Z
is way ahead of you, baby.

499
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:00,045
I've already hired someone
to take care of those two.

500
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,584
He's a vicious,
cold-blooded predator.

501
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,802
Sesame seed.

502
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,633
Hey, mister.

503
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,708
Does that hat take ten gallons?

504
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,296
- Going on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,695
- Moving on.
- Just keep going.

506
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,097
Yup.

507
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,101
Gonna get that crown.

508
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,608
Oh, yeah.

509
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,210
- All right.
- All right.

510
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:04,142
Yeah. Victory.

511
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:08,308
- Are we there yet?
- We must be close by now.

512
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,720
Patrick, look. We're doing great!

513
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,991
Shell City's only five days away.

514
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,723
By car.

515
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,497
I wish we still had our car.

516
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,166
SpongeBob, look.

517
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,858
Our car!

518
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,164
- The key.
- Where do you think it is?

519
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,356
There it is, Pat. The key!

520
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,296
Now, how are we gonna get it?

521
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,798
I know. Walk in and ask him for it.

522
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,436
What are you looking at?

523
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:04,930
- Patrick, that's a terrible idea.
- Sorry.

524
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:08,772
I know. I'll go in and create
a distraction, and you get the key.

525
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,516
Wait. I wanna do the distraction.

526
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:17,086
Okay. I guess it really doesn't matter
who does the distraction.

527
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,986
You see me walking back...?

528
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,722
Can I have everybody's attention?

529
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,134
I have to use the bathroom.

530
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:41,377
It's right over there.

531
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,149
Stupid contacts. Oh, there it is.
I better go wash it off.

532
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,115
Patrick. You call that a distraction?

533
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,880
Well, I had to go to the bathroom.

534
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,591
Well, I got my hands dirty
for nothing.

535
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,122
Patrick, check it out.

536
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,427
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

537
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,498
- Bubble party!
- Bubble party!

538
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,579
Hey!

539
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,255
Who blew this bubble?

540
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,656
You all know the rules!

541
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:33,126
All bubble-blowing babies
will be beaten senseless

542
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:37,097
by every able-bodied patron
in the bar.

543
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,429
That's right! So who blew it?

544
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:45,070
So nobody knows.

545
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,141
- Maybe it was...
- Shut up!

546
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,608
Somebody in here ain't a real man.

547
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,181
You! We're on a baby hunt.

548
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:57,215
And don't think we don't know
how to weed them out.

549
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,150
Now, everybody line up.

550
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:04,717
DJ, time for the test.

551
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:12,162
No baby can resist
singing along to this.

552
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,935
SpongeBob, it's the
Goofy Goober theme song.

553
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,732
I know.

554
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,240
<i>Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

555
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,976
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

556
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,618
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

557
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:32,789
- It was you! You're the baby!
- No, no! I only coughed, I swear.

558
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:37,350
DJ! Turn it up louder!

559
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,725
Don't sing along, Patrick.

560
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,696
I'm trying.

561
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,732
Trying so hard.

562
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,100
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

563
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:56,606
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

564
00:36:56,814 --> 00:37:00,910
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah</i>

565
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:05,252
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah</i>

566
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:09,719
Well, well, well.

567
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,686
Which one of you babies was it?

568
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,387
- It was him.
- It was him.

569
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,691
- He did it.
- He did it.

570
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,265
I've never even eaten at...

571
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:20,403
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah</i>

572
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:25,440
Well, looks like we got ourselves
a double baby.

573
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,644
Man, that was a close call.

574
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,544
Guess what I got.

575
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,719
The key!

576
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:50,557
Too bad SpongeBob's not here
to enjoy SpongeBob not being here.

577
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,068
Morning.

578
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:04,275
Some people have no taste
in headgear.

579
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,919
Babies too?

580
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,280
Excuse me, miss,

581
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,790
but where is everybody
getting that horrid headwear?

582
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,120
Who said that?

583
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:19,318
Down here.

584
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,794
Well, I got it at the Chum Bucket.

585
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,490
Plankton's giving them away free
with every Krabby Patty.

586
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,069
Chum Bucket? Free? Krabby Patty?

587
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:32,003
Plankton? Giving? With?

588
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,938
So you're selling
Krabby Patties, Plankton?

589
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,778
That's right, Squidward.

590
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,382
And there's a free bucket helmet
with every purchase.

591
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,715
Care for one?

592
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,758
No. You may have hoodwinked
everyone else in this backwater town,

593
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,451
but you can't fool me.

594
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,131
I listen to public radio.

595
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,594
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- It means you set up Mr. Krabs.

596
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,102
You stole the crown
so Neptune would freeze him

597
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:06,504
and you could finally get your stubby
little paws on the Krabby Patty formula.

598
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,906
It was you all along.

599
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,980
But you made one fatal mistake.

600
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,344
You messed with my paycheck.

601
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:18,113
And I'm gonna report you
to the highest authority in the land,

602
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,017
King Neptune!

603
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:23,990
We'll see about that,
Inspector Looselips.

604
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:28,293
<i>Now activating helmet
brain- control devices.</i>

605
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,532
What?

606
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,250
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

607
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,478
<i>- What's going on here?
- All hail Plankton.</i>

608
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,850
Seize him, slaves!

609
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,356
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

610
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,623
I'm getting out of here!

611
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,465
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

612
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,697
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

613
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,033
Who can stop me now?

614
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,070
Who?

615
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,085
- Come on, Pat, one more time.
- Okay.

616
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:29,556
We're on a baby hunt. And don't think
we don't know how to weed them out.

617
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,560
"Weed them out. "

618
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,770
What a jerk.

619
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,104
The road's getting kind of bumpy here.

620
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,174
You know, SpongeBob,

621
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,112
there's a lesson to be learned
from all of this.

622
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:55,615
What's that, Patrick?

623
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,654
A bubble-blowing double baby
doesn't belong out here

624
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,620
in man's country.

625
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,555
Yeah. Wait.

626
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,285
We blew that bubble.

627
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:09,091
Doesn't that make us
a bubble-blowing double baby?

628
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,327
Hey, look, free ice cream!

629
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,500
Oh, boy!

630
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,672
How you doing?

631
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,281
Wait a minute.

632
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,815
Wait a minute.

633
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,713
SpongeBob!

634
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,054
Yeah?

635
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,481
Make mine a chocolate!

636
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,722
Got you covered. Two, please.

637
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,392
Certainly.

638
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,589
You kids enjoy.

639
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,231
Actually, we're men,
lady, but thanks.

640
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,128
Okay, Patrick, let's...

641
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,498
You can let go now.
I said, let go, please.

642
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,065
What is this?

643
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,580
What kind of old lady are you?

644
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,773
Did you get the ice cream?

645
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,909
Step on it, Patrick!

646
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:53,770
Hey!

647
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,036
You may not know it, cowboy,

648
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:02,110
but we got a rule around here
about blowing bubbles.

649
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:07,543
All bubble-blowing babies
will be beaten senseless by every

650
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,878
able-bodied...

651
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,915
- In bar...
- Bar...

652
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:30,598
Come on, kiddies,
have some ice cream.

653
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,646
I'll let you pet Mr. Whiskers.

654
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,841
Jump for it, Patrick!

655
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,206
Well, we lost our car again.

656
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:11,347
Never mind the car,
where's the road?

657
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,176
Road. Road. Road.

658
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,683
Road. Road. Road.

659
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,014
Road. R... Sorry.

660
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:20,817
There's the road.

661
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,649
On the other side of this...

662
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,287
...deep, dark...

663
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,993
...dangerous...

664
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,568
- Hazardous.
... hazardous...

665
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,170
Monster-infested.

666
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,203
Yeah, monster-infested...

667
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,700
...trench.

668
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,275
Hey, SpongeBob, look!

669
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,671
Here's the way down.

670
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,481
Well, we're not gonna get
the crown standing here.

671
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,883
On to Shell City.

672
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,924
Hey, look, it's making noise.

673
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,100
SpongeBob?

674
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,539
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going home, Patrick.

675
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,469
But what about Mr. Krabs?

676
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,903
What about us?

677
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,101
We'll never survive in that trench!

678
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,940
You said it yourself,
this is man's country.

679
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:21,515
And let's face it, Pat. We're just...

680
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,051
...kids.
- We're not kids.

681
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,154
Open your eyes, Patrick!

682
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,790
We blow bubbles, we eat ice cream.

683
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:32,223
We worship a dancing peanut,
for corn's sake!

684
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,420
We don't belong out here!

685
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:37,498
We do not worship him.

686
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,795
You've been wearing the same Goofy
Goober Peanut Party underpants

687
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,062
for three years straight.

688
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,101
What do you call that?

689
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,673
Worship?

690
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:49,368
You're right, SpongeBob.
We are kids.

691
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,312
Pull your pants up, Patrick.

692
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:01,252
- We're going home.
- But you can't go home.

693
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,226
Mindy!

694
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,951
Mindy?

695
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,464
- How much did you hear?
- I heard enough.

696
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,226
- Did you see my underwear?
- No, Patrick.

697
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,528
Did you want to?

698
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:14,999
Look, guys, you may be kids,

699
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,639
but you're the only ones left
who can get that crown.

700
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,604
What do you mean,
the only ones left?

701
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,177
Things have gotten a lot worse
since you left Bikini Bottom.

702
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,282
Or should I say Planktopolis.

703
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,679
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

704
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,249
No resting!

705
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:35,619
This monument celebrating my glory
isn't gonna build itself.

706
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,487
Move faster!

707
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,958
Oh, my gosh! Patrick, look!

708
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:43,099
Plankton's turned everyone
we know into slaves.

709
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,766
Squidward.

710
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,768
Sandy.

711
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,267
Mrs. Puff.

712
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:50,665
Even Gary.

713
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,936
Plankton.

714
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,268
Can't your father do something?

715
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,206
My father's too distracted
by his bald spot to do anything.

716
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:03,311
Squire, will you hurry.

717
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,654
So you see, you can't quit.

718
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,326
The fate of Bikini Bottom
rests in your hands.

719
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:14,128
- But... But we're just...
- Hey. It doesn't matter if you're kids.

720
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,323
And what's so wrong with
being a kid, anyway? Kids rule!

721
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,729
You don't need to be a man
to do this.

722
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,235
You just gotta believe in yourself.

723
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:25,101
You just gotta believe!

724
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,844
- I believe.
- That's the spirit.

725
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,638
I believe that

726
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:35,080
everybody I know is a goner!

727
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,479
Come on, guys.

728
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,048
Guys.

729
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,295
Guys?

730
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:04,968
Guys?

731
00:48:08,817 --> 00:48:10,717
Oh, boy.

732
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:13,253
Think, Mindy, think.

733
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,090
Yup, I guess you're right.

734
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,758
A couple of kids could never
survive this journey.

735
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,895
That's why I guess I'll just
have to turn you into men.

736
00:48:30,538 --> 00:48:33,405
You can do that? How?

737
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:36,270
With my mermaid magic.

738
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:40,114
Did you hear that, Patrick?

739
00:48:40,315 --> 00:48:43,682
She'll use her mermaid magic
to turn us into men!

740
00:48:43,885 --> 00:48:45,284
Hooray!

741
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:49,116
We're gonna be men! We're gonna
be men! We're gonna be men!

742
00:48:49,457 --> 00:48:51,084
Good. Now, let's get started.

743
00:48:51,293 --> 00:48:52,487
Close your eyes.

744
00:48:52,694 --> 00:48:55,219
- Are we men yet?
- Not yet.

745
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:56,692
Spin around three times.

746
00:48:57,198 --> 00:48:58,529
I think it's working.

747
00:48:59,334 --> 00:49:02,326
Good. Now, keep your eyes shut.

748
00:49:02,704 --> 00:49:04,695
With my mermaid's magic

749
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,438
and my one tailfin,

750
00:49:08,643 --> 00:49:12,101
I command the two of you
to turn into men!

751
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:13,614
Open your eyes.

752
00:49:17,485 --> 00:49:21,945
I don't feel any... Oh, my gosh,
Patrick, you have a mustache!

753
00:49:22,157 --> 00:49:23,124
So do you!

754
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,856
So now that you're men,
can you make it to Shell City?

755
00:49:34,736 --> 00:49:36,203
- Guys.
- Yeah?

756
00:49:36,404 --> 00:49:39,965
I said, now that you're men,
can you make it to Shell City?

757
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:41,164
Heck, yeah!

758
00:49:41,376 --> 00:49:44,174
- Are men afraid of anything?
- Heck, no!

759
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:45,368
And why?

760
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,844
Because we're invincible!

761
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:49,880
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

762
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:52,479
I never said that.

763
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:53,754
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

764
00:49:53,955 --> 00:49:54,922
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

765
00:49:55,123 --> 00:49:57,990
Yeah! Yeah!

766
00:49:58,993 --> 00:50:01,257
Yeah! Yeah!

767
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:03,328
Yeah.

768
00:50:06,034 --> 00:50:07,934
- Patrick?
- Yeah, buddy?

769
00:50:08,136 --> 00:50:11,003
Why did we jump over the edge
instead of taking the stairs?

770
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:12,901
Bec...

771
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:14,837
Well...

772
00:50:27,355 --> 00:50:29,789
- Patrick.
- Are we dead?

773
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:32,289
No. Far from it, my friend.

774
00:50:32,494 --> 00:50:35,224
We're safe and sound
at the bottom of this trench.

775
00:50:42,637 --> 00:50:44,366
The mustaches worked!

776
00:50:44,572 --> 00:50:46,403
Do you know what that means?

777
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:49,475
We are invincible!

778
00:50:52,914 --> 00:50:56,008
<i>Now that we're men
We can do anything</i>

779
00:50:56,251 --> 00:51:00,051
<i>Now that we're men
We are invincible</i>

780
00:51:00,255 --> 00:51:03,816
<i>Now that we're men
We'll go to Shell City</i>

781
00:51:04,025 --> 00:51:07,392
<i>Get the crown, save the town
And Mr. Krabs</i>

782
00:51:07,729 --> 00:51:09,128
<i>Now that we're men</i>

783
00:51:09,397 --> 00:51:11,388
<i>We have facial hair</i>

784
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,089
<i>Now that we're men</i>

785
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:15,132
<i>I change my underwear</i>

786
00:51:15,336 --> 00:51:18,772
<i>Now that we're men
We've got a manly flair</i>

787
00:51:18,973 --> 00:51:22,431
<i>We've got the stuff
We're tough enough to save the day</i>

788
00:51:22,944 --> 00:51:25,174
<i>We never had a chance
when we were kids</i>

789
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,070
<i>No! No! No!</i>

790
00:51:27,282 --> 00:51:29,182
<i>But take a look at what
the mermaid did</i>

791
00:51:41,863 --> 00:51:43,421
Yeah, go, Pat.

792
00:51:59,113 --> 00:52:00,705
Oh, yeah.

793
00:52:01,282 --> 00:52:03,307
Yeah, go, SpongeBob.

794
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:07,148
Hooray!

795
00:52:07,355 --> 00:52:11,223
<i>Now that they're men
We can't bother them</i>

796
00:52:11,426 --> 00:52:14,953
<i>Now that they're men
They have become our friends</i>

797
00:52:15,163 --> 00:52:18,326
<i>Now that they're men
There'll be a happy end</i>

798
00:52:18,533 --> 00:52:21,866
<i>They'll pass the test
And finish the quest for the crown</i>

799
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,867
<i>They'll pass the test</i>

800
00:52:24,072 --> 00:52:25,767
<i>And finish the quest</i>

801
00:52:25,974 --> 00:52:30,877
<i>They'll pass the test
And finish the quest for the crown</i>

802
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:33,013
"Shell City, dead ahead. "

803
00:52:33,214 --> 00:52:34,374
We did it, Pat!

804
00:52:34,582 --> 00:52:35,947
We made it past everything!

805
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,244
Even the hideous,
disgusting monsters.

806
00:52:43,124 --> 00:52:44,421
Not you guys.

807
00:52:44,626 --> 00:52:46,025
You guys are awesome!

808
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:49,628
Well, Patrick, we should be there
in one more verse.

809
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:51,799
<i>- Now that we're men...
- Finally.</i>

810
00:52:53,968 --> 00:52:56,095
I got you right where I want you.

811
00:52:57,872 --> 00:52:59,430
Can I help you with something, sir?

812
00:52:59,774 --> 00:53:01,332
Name's Dennis.

813
00:53:01,543 --> 00:53:04,034
I've been hired to exterminate you.

814
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:08,210
You're gonna exterminate us?

815
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:27,401
Listen, junior,

816
00:53:27,602 --> 00:53:30,435
you caught me and my friend here
in a good mood today,

817
00:53:30,638 --> 00:53:32,697
so I'm gonna let you off
with a warning.

818
00:53:32,907 --> 00:53:34,636
Step aside,
and you won't have to feel

819
00:53:34,842 --> 00:53:37,367
the awesome wrath
of our mustaches.

820
00:53:37,879 --> 00:53:40,143
You mean these?

821
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:47,684
I thought you still had a piece of salad
stuck to your lip from lunchtime.

822
00:53:53,328 --> 00:53:54,920
They were fake?

823
00:53:55,129 --> 00:53:56,756
Of course they were fake!

824
00:53:56,965 --> 00:54:00,423
This is what a real mustache
looks like.

825
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:07,667
- Is he a mermaid?
- All right. Enough gab.

826
00:54:10,545 --> 00:54:12,604
What are you gonna do to us?

827
00:54:12,814 --> 00:54:15,009
Plankton was very specific.

828
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,317
Plankton?

829
00:54:16,517 --> 00:54:19,179
For some reason,
he wanted me to step on you.

830
00:54:19,387 --> 00:54:20,979
Step on us?

831
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:25,649
Yeah! That way you'll never find out
that he stole the crown!

832
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:29,453
Perhaps I've said too much.

833
00:54:37,372 --> 00:54:38,999
That's a big boot.

834
00:54:39,207 --> 00:54:40,174
Don't worry.

835
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:42,809
This will only hurt a lot.

836
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:48,739
I love this job!

837
00:54:50,652 --> 00:54:52,916
- Bigger boot!
- Wait, Pat.

838
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:55,248
This bigger boot saved our lives.

839
00:54:57,158 --> 00:54:59,023
Thank you, stranger.

840
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:06,794
Stranger?

841
00:55:08,069 --> 00:55:09,832
It's the Cyclops!

842
00:55:34,028 --> 00:55:36,189
Help us! Help us!

843
00:55:38,566 --> 00:55:40,591
Save us, someone!

844
00:56:06,427 --> 00:56:07,860
Are we dead?

845
00:56:08,062 --> 00:56:09,529
I don't think so.

846
00:56:10,665 --> 00:56:13,566
Artificially colored rocks?

847
00:56:16,104 --> 00:56:18,368
I don't know where we are.

848
00:56:18,573 --> 00:56:20,200
What is this?

849
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:23,867
It's some kind of wall
of psychic energy.

850
00:56:24,078 --> 00:56:28,014
No, Pat, it's a giant glass bowl.

851
00:56:28,216 --> 00:56:30,047
Hey, there's some fish folk.

852
00:56:31,385 --> 00:56:33,876
- Hey, over here!
- Hey! Hey! Hey, you guys!

853
00:56:34,088 --> 00:56:36,682
- You guys, hey! Help!
- Hey! Help!

854
00:56:36,891 --> 00:56:40,292
- A little help here! We're stuck in this...
- Help us out of the tank!

855
00:56:40,895 --> 00:56:42,294
Wait a second.

856
00:56:47,135 --> 00:56:50,002
Those fish are dead.

857
00:57:10,525 --> 00:57:12,083
What's he gonna do with us?

858
00:57:18,065 --> 00:57:22,195
Oh, no, he's going for his
evil instruments of torture.

859
00:57:28,643 --> 00:57:30,838
Glue? Google eyes?

860
00:57:41,656 --> 00:57:45,558
He's making
a humorous diorama of...

861
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:49,787
...Alexander Clam Bell?

862
00:57:49,997 --> 00:57:54,195
Patrick, he's killing sea animals and
making them into smelly knickknacks.

863
00:57:54,402 --> 00:57:56,233
And I think we're next.

864
00:57:56,537 --> 00:58:00,803
- You think so?
- Patrick! No!

865
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:19,722
The heat is so intense
from this lamp that I can't move.

866
00:58:19,927 --> 00:58:21,417
Tell me about it.

867
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:35,606
This doesn't look too good, Patrick.

868
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:37,243
You mean we're not gonna

869
00:58:37,445 --> 00:58:41,882
<i>Get the crown, save the town
And Mr. Krabs?</i>

870
00:58:42,116 --> 00:58:46,678
I don't even think we're gonna
be able to save ourselves, buddy.

871
00:58:50,825 --> 00:58:53,419
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

872
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:58,656
Well, it looks like what everybody
said about us is true, Patrick.

873
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,765
You mean that we're attractive?

874
00:59:00,968 --> 00:59:03,937
No, that we're just kids.

875
00:59:04,138 --> 00:59:07,835
A couple of kids
in way over their heads.

876
00:59:08,042 --> 00:59:10,533
We were doomed from the start.

877
00:59:10,745 --> 00:59:12,372
I mean, look at us.

878
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,242
We didn't even come
close to the crown.

879
00:59:15,449 --> 00:59:17,610
We let everybody down.

880
00:59:17,818 --> 00:59:19,581
We failed.

881
00:59:19,787 --> 00:59:21,345
Shell City.

882
00:59:21,555 --> 00:59:24,581
Yeah, we never made it to Shell City.

883
00:59:24,792 --> 00:59:26,453
Shell City.

884
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:27,855
Exactly, buddy.

885
00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:31,190
Yeah, the place we never got to.

886
00:59:31,399 --> 00:59:32,525
Shell City.

887
00:59:32,733 --> 00:59:34,963
Okay, now you're starting
to bum me out, Patrick.

888
00:59:35,169 --> 00:59:37,603
No, look at the sign.

889
00:59:38,005 --> 00:59:42,806
"Shell City.
Marine gifts and sundries. "

890
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:46,138
Shell City is a gift shop?

891
00:59:46,347 --> 00:59:51,046
But if this is Shell City,
then where's the...?

892
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:54,186
- Crown.
- Crown.

893
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,719
Neptune's crown.

894
00:59:57,925 --> 01:00:01,019
This is Shell City.

895
01:00:01,228 --> 01:00:04,322
Pat, we did make it.

896
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:08,130
Yeah, I guess we did.

897
01:00:10,271 --> 01:00:14,264
We did all right
for a couple of goofballs.

898
01:00:23,584 --> 01:00:29,716
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

899
01:00:29,924 --> 01:00:35,954
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

900
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:43,368
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah</i>

901
01:00:43,571 --> 01:00:50,909
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

902
01:01:07,028 --> 01:01:11,089
That's the end of SpongeBob.

903
01:01:11,298 --> 01:01:12,925
Come here, you.

904
01:01:15,703 --> 01:01:17,466
Shut up and look at the screen.

905
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,099
The bird's right. Look.

906
01:01:21,308 --> 01:01:24,709
It be the tear of the Goofy Goobers.

907
01:01:57,144 --> 01:01:59,203
Hey, we're alive.

908
01:02:05,386 --> 01:02:08,116
- Let's get that crown.
- Right.

909
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:13,117
On three, Patrick. Ready?
One, two, three.

910
01:02:13,327 --> 01:02:15,591
Hey, it's lighter than I thought.

911
01:02:32,813 --> 01:02:34,542
What's happening?

912
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:37,615
I don't know. Look!

913
01:03:22,897 --> 01:03:25,058
Come on, Patrick.

914
01:03:25,266 --> 01:03:28,929
Let's get this crown
back to Bikini Bottom.

915
01:03:30,337 --> 01:03:33,465
- Do you still have that bag of winds?
- I sure do.

916
01:03:36,877 --> 01:03:38,572
Here you go.

917
01:03:40,214 --> 01:03:41,238
What?

918
01:03:41,448 --> 01:03:42,779
Nothing. Nothing.

919
01:03:42,983 --> 01:03:44,610
Okay, let's go over the instructions.

920
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:49,048
Let's see, it says here, "Step one:
Point bag away from home. "

921
01:03:49,256 --> 01:03:52,657
- Okay.
- "Step two: Plant feet firmly on ground. "

922
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,589
- Right.
- "Step three:

923
01:03:54,795 --> 01:03:57,263
Remove string from bag,
releasing the winds. "

924
01:03:57,464 --> 01:03:59,455
Check.

925
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:01,567
Well, that seems simple enough.

926
01:04:01,769 --> 01:04:03,896
Point bag away from home,
feet firmly on ground,

927
01:04:04,104 --> 01:04:05,696
pull string, releasing the winds.

928
01:04:05,906 --> 01:04:08,067
All right, let's do it for real.

929
01:04:08,275 --> 01:04:10,835
SpongeBob?

930
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:15,439
- No, no, stop!
- I was bad, I'm sorry!

931
01:04:15,649 --> 01:04:17,549
- Please, bag.
- I'm sorry, I just thought...

932
01:04:17,751 --> 01:04:19,912
It was a mistake!

933
01:04:25,726 --> 01:04:30,254
Oh, no. How will we ever get
back to Bikini Bottom now?

934
01:04:30,464 --> 01:04:31,795
I can take you there.

935
01:04:40,975 --> 01:04:43,944
- Who are you?
- I'm David Hasselhoff.

936
01:04:44,144 --> 01:04:45,736
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

937
01:04:47,648 --> 01:04:48,876
So where's your boat?

938
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,911
Boat?

939
01:04:55,789 --> 01:04:59,281
- Go, Hasselhoff.
- Next stop, Bikini Bottom.

940
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:04,995
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

941
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,999
Well, Krabs,
you know what today is?

942
01:05:09,203 --> 01:05:10,898
Sorry about this, calendar.

943
01:05:11,105 --> 01:05:12,766
March 14.

944
01:05:12,973 --> 01:05:14,634
Wait, that's not right.

945
01:05:14,842 --> 01:05:19,176
It should say
"The day that Krabs fries. "

946
01:05:25,419 --> 01:05:27,353
Guess who's here.

947
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,860
Hooray for Hasselhoff!
Nothing can stop us now.

948
01:05:44,071 --> 01:05:48,007
Unidentified object
off the hindquarters.

949
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,501
It looks like...

950
01:05:52,212 --> 01:05:53,679
...bigger boot.

951
01:05:53,881 --> 01:05:55,872
But how?

952
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:06,183
Dennis!

953
01:06:06,393 --> 01:06:07,883
Did you miss me?

954
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,425
This is the best seat in the house.

955
01:06:15,636 --> 01:06:19,834
All right, Neptune, let's get it on.

956
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,771
Eugene Krabs,
your six-day reprieve is up,

957
01:06:23,977 --> 01:06:27,469
and it is time for you to die.

958
01:06:27,681 --> 01:06:30,912
Please, I didn't do it.

959
01:06:31,118 --> 01:06:33,814
There is nothing else I can do.

960
01:06:34,021 --> 01:06:36,387
You can give SpongeBob and Patrick
a little more time.

961
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:41,289
Except give SpongeBob and Patrick
a little more time...

962
01:06:41,495 --> 01:06:43,963
What? Mindy, will you butt out.

963
01:06:44,164 --> 01:06:46,860
I won't have you stalling
this execution.

964
01:06:47,067 --> 01:06:49,763
Stalling? I'm not stalling anything.

965
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:51,801
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

966
01:06:52,005 --> 01:06:55,270
Yes, you are.
You're doing it right now.

967
01:06:55,476 --> 01:06:58,468
- I'm stalling.
- Yes.

968
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:00,374
- Stalling?
- Stalling!

969
01:07:00,748 --> 01:07:03,376
- Stalling.
- Stalling!

970
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:04,676
Oh, boy.

971
01:07:08,489 --> 01:07:10,616
Now, where were we?

972
01:07:10,824 --> 01:07:13,054
- Patrick, run.
- No.

973
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,727
I'm tired of running.

974
01:07:14,928 --> 01:07:18,796
If we run now, we'll never stop...

975
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,627
Run, SpongeBob!

976
01:07:28,175 --> 01:07:30,643
Take it easy back there, fellas.

977
01:07:38,685 --> 01:07:40,448
SpongeBob, be careful.

978
01:07:40,654 --> 01:07:42,781
Come on, kid, give it up.

979
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:45,453
Dennis always gets his man.

980
01:07:45,893 --> 01:07:47,383
Never!

981
01:07:55,569 --> 01:07:57,332
Yeah! I did it!

982
01:07:57,538 --> 01:07:59,301
You got guts, kid.

983
01:07:59,506 --> 01:08:01,235
Too bad I gotta rip them out of you.

984
01:08:01,442 --> 01:08:03,410
I don't know what Plankton's
paying you,

985
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:06,272
but if you let us go,
I can make it worth your while.

986
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,846
It's gonna take a lot more than 5...

987
01:08:09,049 --> 01:08:12,610
- What is this?
- That, sir, is five Goober dollars.

988
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:15,983
Legal tender at any participating
Goofy Goober...

989
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,750
I got bubbles. Fun at parties.

990
01:08:19,393 --> 01:08:21,258
My eyes.

991
01:08:21,462 --> 01:08:23,362
I got you, SpongeBob.

992
01:08:23,564 --> 01:08:25,532
Thanks, buddy.

993
01:08:25,732 --> 01:08:26,858
Thanks a lot.

994
01:08:27,067 --> 01:08:28,625
That's it.

995
01:08:28,836 --> 01:08:30,497
I'm through messing around.

996
01:08:30,704 --> 01:08:33,332
See you later, fools.

997
01:08:40,314 --> 01:08:42,009
See you.

998
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:45,284
So you think...

999
01:08:45,486 --> 01:08:47,647
...I'm...

1000
01:08:47,855 --> 01:08:50,153
...stalling.

1001
01:08:50,357 --> 01:08:52,325
Where am I, in Crazytown?

1002
01:08:52,526 --> 01:08:56,792
I have had enough of this nonsense!

1003
01:08:56,997 --> 01:09:02,435
You are to wait in the carriage
until the execution is done.

1004
01:09:03,737 --> 01:09:06,297
- But, Daddy...
- Now!

1005
01:09:09,576 --> 01:09:11,009
No, no, no!

1006
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:14,044
Oh, SpongeBob, wherever you are,
you better hurry.

1007
01:09:16,617 --> 01:09:20,815
Okay, fellas, this is where you get off.
Bikini Bottom's directly below.

1008
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:23,421
But we'll never be able
to float down in time.

1009
01:09:23,624 --> 01:09:26,320
Who said anything about floating?

1010
01:09:26,994 --> 01:09:30,395
<i>- Initiating launch sequence.
- What the...?</i>

1011
01:09:32,266 --> 01:09:35,667
- Did you see that?
- The control.

1012
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:39,502
All hands on deck.

1013
01:09:40,507 --> 01:09:44,238
<i>Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight...</i>

1014
01:09:44,444 --> 01:09:48,574
Eugene Krabs, the time has come...

1015
01:09:48,782 --> 01:09:50,443
- No.
- Yes.

1016
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:52,380
<i>...six, five...</i>

1017
01:09:52,586 --> 01:09:53,553
...for you...

1018
01:09:53,754 --> 01:09:55,381
- No.
- Yes.

1019
01:09:55,589 --> 01:09:57,181
<i>...three, two...</i>

1020
01:09:57,391 --> 01:09:59,018
...to fry.
- No.

1021
01:09:59,226 --> 01:10:01,558
<i>- Yes.
- ... one.</i>

1022
01:10:06,066 --> 01:10:07,624
No!

1023
01:10:10,504 --> 01:10:13,234
You done good, Hasselhoff.
You done...

1024
01:10:18,645 --> 01:10:20,806
Hooray! We made it.

1025
01:10:21,014 --> 01:10:23,482
We made it.

1026
01:10:28,255 --> 01:10:30,621
My crown.

1027
01:10:30,824 --> 01:10:34,692
My beautiful crown!

1028
01:10:36,363 --> 01:10:40,561
SpongeBob? Patrick?
I knew you could do it.

1029
01:10:49,242 --> 01:10:53,611
Oh, yes. Well done, SpongeBoob.

1030
01:10:54,147 --> 01:10:56,980
Sorry to rain
on your parade, Plankton.

1031
01:10:57,184 --> 01:10:59,516
Oh, don't worry about me.

1032
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:05,420
My parade shall be quite dry
under my umbrella!

1033
01:11:05,626 --> 01:11:08,060
Umbrella?

1034
01:11:13,467 --> 01:11:14,593
Daddy, no.

1035
01:11:14,801 --> 01:11:17,167
Daddy, yes.

1036
01:11:21,274 --> 01:11:24,209
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

1037
01:11:25,946 --> 01:11:31,043
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

1038
01:11:31,251 --> 01:11:37,815
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

1039
01:11:38,992 --> 01:11:40,653
SpongeBob, what happened?

1040
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:42,920
- Plankton cheated.
- Cheated?

1041
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,394
Hold on there, baldy.

1042
01:11:45,599 --> 01:11:46,725
Oh, grow up.

1043
01:11:46,933 --> 01:11:50,130
What, you think this is a game
of kickball on the playground?

1044
01:11:50,337 --> 01:11:53,500
You never had a chance
to defeat me, fool.

1045
01:11:53,707 --> 01:11:55,174
And you know why?

1046
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:56,865
Because you cheated?

1047
01:11:57,077 --> 01:12:00,911
No, not because I cheated.
Because I'm an evil genius.

1048
01:12:01,114 --> 01:12:03,207
And you're just a kid.

1049
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:06,350
A stupid kid.

1050
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:14,650
I guess you're right, Plankton.
I am just a kid.

1051
01:12:14,861 --> 01:12:17,421
Of course I'm right.
Okay, Neptune, time to kill.

1052
01:12:17,631 --> 01:12:20,691
And you know, I've been through
a lot in the past six days,

1053
01:12:20,901 --> 01:12:23,495
five minutes,
27-and-a-half seconds.

1054
01:12:23,704 --> 01:12:26,434
And if I've learned anything
during that time,

1055
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,904
it's that you are who you are.

1056
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:34,445
- That's right. Okay, Neptune...
- And no amount of mermaid magic...

1057
01:12:34,648 --> 01:12:38,243
...or managerial promotion...

1058
01:12:38,452 --> 01:12:40,249
...or some other third thing...

1059
01:12:40,454 --> 01:12:43,946
...can make me anything more
than what I really am inside:

1060
01:12:44,324 --> 01:12:46,087
- A kid.
- That's great.

1061
01:12:46,293 --> 01:12:48,591
- Now, get back against the wall.
- But that's okay.

1062
01:12:48,795 --> 01:12:50,558
- What? What's going on?
- Because I did

1063
01:12:50,764 --> 01:12:52,823
what everyone said
a kid couldn't do.

1064
01:12:53,033 --> 01:12:56,434
I made it to Shell City,
and I beat the Cyclops,

1065
01:12:56,636 --> 01:13:00,834
and I rode the Hasselhoff,
and I brought the crown back.

1066
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:03,908
- All right, we get the point.
- So, yeah, I'm a kid.

1067
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:06,545
And I'm also a goofball.
And a wing nut.

1068
01:13:06,747 --> 01:13:08,874
And a Knucklehead McSpazatron!

1069
01:13:09,816 --> 01:13:12,307
- What's going on here?
- But most of all, I'm...

1070
01:13:12,519 --> 01:13:15,249
- Okay, settle down. Take it easy.
- I'm... I'm...

1071
01:13:15,455 --> 01:13:16,615
What the scallop?!

1072
01:13:16,823 --> 01:13:18,120
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober</i>

1073
01:13:21,328 --> 01:13:22,886
<i>You're a Goofy Goober</i>

1074
01:13:25,165 --> 01:13:28,066
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers</i>

1075
01:13:30,137 --> 01:13:33,504
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goober</i>

1076
01:13:35,942 --> 01:13:38,638
<i>Put your toys away
Well, all I gotta say</i>

1077
01:13:38,845 --> 01:13:40,642
<i>When you tell me not to play
I say no way</i>

1078
01:13:40,847 --> 01:13:43,680
<i>- No way!
- No, no freaking way</i>

1079
01:13:45,018 --> 01:13:47,612
<i>I'm a kid, you say
When you say I'm a kid</i>

1080
01:13:47,821 --> 01:13:49,686
<i>I say, "Say it again"
And then I say thanks</i>

1081
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:52,450
<i>- Thanks!
- Thank you very much</i>

1082
01:13:54,361 --> 01:13:58,024
<i>So if you're thinking
That you'd like to be like me</i>

1083
01:13:58,231 --> 01:14:01,860
<i>Go ahead and try
The kid inside will set you free</i>

1084
01:14:06,473 --> 01:14:07,872
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober</i>

1085
01:14:10,977 --> 01:14:12,604
What's happening?

1086
01:14:15,215 --> 01:14:19,379
His dance moves are impressive,
but I'm in control.

1087
01:14:19,586 --> 01:14:23,283
<i>- Seize him!
- All hail Plankton.</i>

1088
01:14:50,851 --> 01:14:53,149
I'm free. I've been freed!

1089
01:14:53,353 --> 01:14:54,945
What?

1090
01:14:55,922 --> 01:14:57,253
No!

1091
01:15:09,603 --> 01:15:11,230
My precious helmets!

1092
01:15:22,382 --> 01:15:24,509
His chops are too righteous.

1093
01:15:24,718 --> 01:15:28,586
The helmets can't handle
this level of rock 'n' roll.

1094
01:15:28,788 --> 01:15:31,256
Karen, do something.

1095
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:33,183
Karen?

1096
01:15:36,396 --> 01:15:38,796
All right, that's the last straw.

1097
01:15:38,999 --> 01:15:42,400
Neptune, I command you to...

1098
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:46,769
- Here you go, Daddy.
- I better get out of here.

1099
01:15:47,774 --> 01:15:50,140
Look, it's the wizard who saved us.

1100
01:15:50,343 --> 01:15:52,402
Out of my way, fools.

1101
01:16:04,591 --> 01:16:07,560
Come on, I was just kidding.

1102
01:16:08,361 --> 01:16:11,922
Come on, you guys knew that,
didn't you?

1103
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,329
With the helmets
and the big monuments...

1104
01:16:15,669 --> 01:16:18,103
Wasn't that hilarious, everybody?

1105
01:16:18,305 --> 01:16:20,933
I will destroy all of you!

1106
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:24,768
Well, Mindy, I have to admit,
you were right.

1107
01:16:24,978 --> 01:16:26,969
Your compassion
for these sea creatures

1108
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,977
proved a most admirable trait.

1109
01:16:29,182 --> 01:16:33,846
Without it, I would have never
again seen my beloved crown.

1110
01:16:34,054 --> 01:16:37,751
I think you're going to make a fine
ruler of the sea one day.

1111
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:39,926
- Now, let's go home.
- Daddy,

1112
01:16:40,126 --> 01:16:41,753
haven't you forgotten something?

1113
01:16:41,962 --> 01:16:44,328
What? Oh, yeah.

1114
01:16:44,931 --> 01:16:49,300
Eugene Krabs,
I forgot to unfreeze you.

1115
01:16:52,038 --> 01:16:53,528
What the...?

1116
01:16:54,674 --> 01:16:56,699
I guess I had it set to
"real boy" ending.

1117
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:04,947
Oh, I'm sorry
for falsely freezing you, Krabs.

1118
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:08,678
And may I say, sir,
you are a very lucky fellow

1119
01:17:08,888 --> 01:17:11,914
to have in your employ
such a brave, faithful

1120
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:14,958
and heroic young lad.

1121
01:17:15,662 --> 01:17:18,631
- Where is he, anyway?
- I'm up here.

1122
01:17:23,303 --> 01:17:24,861
I'm on it.

1123
01:17:28,641 --> 01:17:31,201
Go to him now, Krabs.
Embrace him.

1124
01:17:31,878 --> 01:17:35,814
SpongeBob, me boy,
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

1125
01:17:36,016 --> 01:17:37,950
That's a mistake I won't make again.

1126
01:17:38,151 --> 01:17:41,314
Oh, Mr. Krabs, you old soft-serve.

1127
01:17:41,521 --> 01:17:44,513
And now, SpongeBob,
I'm gonna do something

1128
01:17:44,724 --> 01:17:47,249
that I should've done six days ago.

1129
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:50,657
Mr. Squidward,
front and center, please.

1130
01:17:50,864 --> 01:17:55,733
I think we all know who rightfully
deserves to wear that manager pin.

1131
01:17:55,935 --> 01:17:58,199
I couldn't agree more, sir.

1132
01:17:58,405 --> 01:18:00,930
Hooray for SpongeBob!

1133
01:18:04,444 --> 01:18:06,071
Wait a second, everybody.

1134
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:08,372
There's something I need to say first.

1135
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:10,378
I just don't know how to put it.

1136
01:18:10,583 --> 01:18:12,847
I think I know what it is.

1137
01:18:13,053 --> 01:18:15,988
After going on
your life-changing journey,

1138
01:18:16,189 --> 01:18:20,626
you now realize you don't want
what you thought you wanted.

1139
01:18:20,827 --> 01:18:26,129
What you really wanted
was inside you all along.

1140
01:18:26,566 --> 01:18:30,024
Are you crazy? I was just gonna
tell you that your fly is down.

1141
01:18:30,336 --> 01:18:34,397
Manager! This is
the greatest day of my life!

1142
01:26:32,418 --> 01:26:34,579
You know, David Hasselhoff
is a great artist.

1143
01:26:34,787 --> 01:26:36,084
Excuse me, sir.

1144
01:26:37,557 --> 01:26:38,819
You folks have to leave.

1145
01:26:40,259 --> 01:26:44,286
What? Say that again, if you dare.

1146
01:26:44,497 --> 01:26:46,692
You folks have to leave.

1147
01:26:48,434 --> 01:26:50,402
Okay.
