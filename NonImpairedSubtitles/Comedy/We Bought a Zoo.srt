1
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,920
DYLAN: My dad is a writer
who specialized in adventure.

2
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,880
This is Benjamin Mee.

3
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,120
I am surrounded by hundreds,
probably thousands of killer bees.

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,880
If I wasn't wearing this suit,
I would be dead in an instant!

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,200
ANNOUNCER: May I have
your attention, please?

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,040
DYLAN: He interviewed
dangerous dictators.

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,520
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

8
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,440
What's your favorite movie?

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,520
Segunda.

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,480
DYLAN: He even flew into
the center of Hurricane Charley.

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,320
It was a Category 4 storm.

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,120
How far are we from the eye?

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,600
PILOT: About two minutes!

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,320
This hurricane, sir,

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,400
Charley, is really kneading us well, sir.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,240
Tell me when it gets severe!

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,840
(LAUGHS)

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,000
DYLAN: He knew the ins and outs
of strange and exotic adventure,

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,920
backwards and forwards.

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,480
But nothing prepared him for this one.

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,040
Come on, come on. We're late, guys.
Let's go. Come on.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,760
- Come on, come on. We're really late.
- (PHONE RINGING)

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,160
- ROSIE: Dad, can you get my hair?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,800
Dad, I'll just get waffles.

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,440
No, no, no, I want you to have eggs, man.

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,520
- We have time. You need the protein.
- We don't have time.

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,720
- Mama always gave me almond milk.
- Dad, you didn't read the label.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,080
You didn't read the label.

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,560
- These aren't gluten free.
- Will you do that?

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,280
- I can't eat these!
- Did anybody even say good morning?

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
- Hello, Benjamin Mee.
- Take your thing.

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,800
- Look, Dad, the dog!
- Don't step on the...

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,280
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi, Sharon.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800
No, I can't... I can't go hiking.

35
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,960
It's just not a great time for me.

36
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,680
Okay. Okay.
Listen, I'm gonna call again tomorrow.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,360
- Okay, thank you.
- Great!

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,680
Where's our lunches?

39
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,200
What is on your feet?

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,640
Reindeer slippers.

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
BENJAMIN: Look, I am the one
who gets the emails

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,320
about your lack of effort, man. Okay?

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,720
You either know where the book is
or you don't.

44
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,200
Dad, it's whatever.
Look, I'll know it when I get to school.

45
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,840
You know what?
"Whatever" is the laziest word

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,360
of the 20th century, all right?

47
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,840
I'm... I've had it with "whatever."

48
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't want to hear it again
in this century ever again.

49
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,160
"Whatever" is over.

50
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,520
He says it all the time. He won't have
anything left to say in this century.

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,360
I'm not lettin' you out of the car
till I get a new word.

52
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,760
You know, you gotta focus, man.

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,320
If you focused as much on your homework

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,080
as you do on your artwork, you'd have it all.

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,320
- But as it is...
- Dad, I finished The Seventh Tower.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,680
...you're gonna get an F.

57
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,600
Pernicious.

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,920
Thank you.

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,360
(MOUTHING)

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,280
BENJAMIN: Good word.

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,600
Dad. Nobody's gonna give an F
to a kid whose mom died six months ago.

62
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,520
What does perni... pern...

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,200
pernicious mean?

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,120
It's causing insidious harm or ruin.

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
Causing damage.

66
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,440
DYLAN: Get out, get out, get out.

67
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,120
Keep goin', guys, come on.

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,760
Dad!

69
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,600
Man, all right.

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,560
I'll get you a new... I'll get you a new bag.

71
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,480
Come on, sweetie. Come on.
Okay, where did Mom get the backpacks?

72
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
- WOMAN: Mr. Mee?
- Just don't worry about it.

73
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,880
- Hi. Oh, okay.
- Benjamin, I thought maybe...

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
Here you go, guys.
Here's your bag, sweetheart. Here.

75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,440
There's one, there's two, all right.
Goodbye.

76
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,480
- Bye, honey.
- ROSIE: Bye, Dad!

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,960
Bye, hon!

78
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,080
I thought, maybe...

79
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,480
It's lasagna. Dinner for three.

80
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,160
Great, thank you.

81
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,600
Or four.

82
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,520
You know, my brother is actually
coming for dinner tonight.

83
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
So that's perfect.

84
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,480
And I'll get the dish back to you
within the week.

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,240
In time. In time.

86
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,320
In time, then.

87
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,240
Thank you.

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,640
- ROSIE: Bye, Dad.
- Bye, sweetheart.

89
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
Benjamin, I've arrived at a thought.

90
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,640
Tell me, Dunc.

91
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,320
I believe you should court the girl
we met at Jamba Juice.

92
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,680
She's a stunner.

93
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,520
She keeps callin' me to go hiking.

94
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,680
- Benjamin, hike her.
- (CHUCKLES)

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
All right. Let's see.

96
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,640
BENJAMIN: Cerrado.

97
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,000
DUNCAN: Yeah, looks like
Bernie's closed for renovations.

98
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,400
Which means Bernie's hung over.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,840
Is she a stunner? I mean,
is that what they call a stunner now?

100
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,160
I mean, what do I know?
I was spoiled. I had the real thing.

101
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, what else do we have around here?

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,920
Got Little Dom's.

103
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,000
No.

104
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,680
- Hey.
- Nope. No.

105
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,960
Look. The world is gonna get very small

106
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,880
if you don't go to any of the places
where you and Katherine used to go.

107
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
I met her there.

108
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,200
- Man, I'm sorry. That's right.
- It's all right, man.

109
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,040
You know, I gotta get back anyway.
Want to just do it next week?

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
Look.

111
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,080
You gotta let a little sunlight in. Okay?

112
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,720
Human interaction is a good thing.

113
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,160
Take it from a guy who spent six months
on a commercial fishing boat in Bali

114
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,680
trying to find himself.

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
- (CHUCKLES)
- Remember that?

116
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,160
Yeah. And you know what I found?

117
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,200
I missed people.

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,680
So just do me a favor.

119
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,360
Attempt to start over.

120
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,040
I shall try to start over.

121
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
(LAUGHS)

122
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,760
- You're handsome!
- Hey-a, so are you!

123
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,880
All right.

124
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,880
- I love you, my brother.
- I love you, too, man.

125
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,600
You're a good guy.

126
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,760
Sunlight.

127
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,120
- Human interaction.
- Got it!

128
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,000
Joy.

129
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,800
BENJAMIN: All right, McGinty, so get this.

130
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,720
I go to the volcano eruption site.
And I take the kids.

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,040
And I write about the end of the world
from the point of view

132
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,760
of the generation that's gonna save it.

133
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,200
And we do a whole thing
about how life is elemental,

134
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,280
and all the software, and laptops,

135
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,920
and apps in the world
aren't gonna change that.

136
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,120
And we call it... You ready?

137
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,880
iPocalypse.

138
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,360
Wow. Just wow.

139
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,040
It's good, right?
I mean, I think it could be a series,

140
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,560
like the killer bees.

141
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,080
That is bold stuff.

142
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,880
You're not gonna say yes, are you?

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,560
No. Listen.

144
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,280
I think we should give you
an online column.

145
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,560
That way, you'll be protected.
This is the way we live now.

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,440
If the paper goes down or gets sold,
you'll still be safe.

147
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,320
You'll be viral.

148
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,560
Don't keep me around out of...

149
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,120
I am not!

150
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,920
Out of sympathy. I mean, I hate sympathy.

151
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,440
I'm sick of sympathy.

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
I know.

153
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,160
- You know what?
- Bad things happen. You just keep going.

154
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,800
I quit.

155
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,960
Benjamin. You lost your wife, man.

156
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,600
In some quarters, sympathy would be
considered the appropriate response.

157
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,440
No, I'm not gonna sit around here
and spin my wheels

158
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,320
and live in a state of sponsored pity.

159
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,280
Please! Let me lay you off
so you can get the benefits!

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
That's more sympathy! No!

161
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,320
I quit.

162
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,680
And I love you. And those patched elbows.

163
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,880
- You're killin' me.
- I'll miss you.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,480

- Classy. Real classy.

They left the cashbox right on the counter.

169
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,800
It was kind of their fault
if you think about it.

170
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
That's three suspensions in one semester.

171
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,040
That's gotta be some kind of record.

172
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,680
Yeah, well, maybe I'll get a prize.

173
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,960
Could you possibly be
making a joke right now?

174
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
- (SQUEAKING CONTINUES)
- Jesus, that is annoying!

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,840
- Dad, stop.
- No, I can fix it.

176
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,720
Dad, here he come...

177

BENJAMIN: Frame's a little loose. I...

178
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,520
Just give me one second.

179
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,360
I'm fine with my squeaky window, Mr. Mee.

180
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,880
In fact, I rather enjoy it.

181
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,240
Besides today's theft,

182
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,200
there's a darkness here
that we need to deal with.

183
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,840
Mr. Devereaux, Dylan's art teacher,

184
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,120
wanted you to see his wall mural.

185
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,840
We encourage creativity at the school.

186
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,880
There's a nice treatment
of the word "love".

187
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,400
A whimsical portraiture of recycling.

188
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,720
A hard-hitting exposé about world peace.

189
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,200
Here is the great Bob Marley.

190
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,040
Though we don't endorse
all that he stood for.

191
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,920
Sunflowers.

192
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,360
And guess which one is your son's.

193
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,760
We're a three-strike school, Mr. Mee,
and today was his fourth strike.

194
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm sorry. We have to expel Dylan.

195
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,760
But, as one parent to another, I...

196
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,040
I would examine his inner life.

197
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,160
Let's go.

198
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,680
It's like he was expelling me
for my artwork.

199
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,920
I can almost live with the artwork.

200
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,000
I mean, if Charles Manson needed
a personal muralist, you'd be the guy.

201
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,440
But no, he didn't expel you
because of the artwork.

202
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,960
He expelled you because you stole.

203
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,800
You stole!

204
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,520
It breaks my heart.

205
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,520
Always lasagna.

206
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,560
Dad, someday you're gonna
have to eat some of that lasagna.

207
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,800
Honey...

208
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,120
Or throw it away.

209
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,520
(CHUCKLES)

210
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,840
Hey, why didn't you go to Sadie's
for the play date, sweetie?

211
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,160
No reason. Lots to do here.

212
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,880
Hey, Rosie?

213
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,840
Am I doin' anything right?

214
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,520
You're handsomer than the other dads.

215
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,360
Lots of them don't have hair.
So that's good.

216
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,000
Awesome. I'm gonna take baldness
off my list of things to worry about.

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,200
Daddy, I can't sleep. The neighbors again.

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,760

Hey!

STEVENS: It's a new day for you, Mr. B.

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,960
We have a full day
of house hunting planned

227
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,880
and I think you'll be very excited
at what's available.

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,640
We just want new. We want new...
New everything.

229
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,160
New opportunities, new schools, just new.

230
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,960
In the current economic environment,

231
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,720
you're gonna find that now,
the buyer is now the king.

232
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,480
But what I'm hopin' for
is like a big backyard.

233
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,880
Substantial, you know, just rolling hills.

234
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,880
It's gonna be very hard
to find rolling hills in the city.

235
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,520
- It just... It's just not available!
- Right, well...

236
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,240
I mean, stationary hills. We...

237
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,880
The hills don't have to roll, right, honey?

238
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,200
- Yeah?
- Just new.

239
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,400
Know what? It's all about new.
People love new.

I love new. Hell, I'm new!
Excuse my language, but I'm new.

- All right.
- Hell, I'm new.

I love her. You know how I picture her?

doin' this job?

- Hell, yeah. First day.

I mean, what would we do with 18 acres?

The Rosemoor property
has some challenges.

Well, what doesn't?

275
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,680

I want to offer the word "unique".

276
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,320
Wait a second. Is that it?

- Yes.
- Rosie.

278

- And...
- BENJAMIN: Look.

to take a picture, Rosie.

whoa, whoa. Mr. Mee, right now,

Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

to you yet, now. All right?

Why didn't you mention it earlier?

Well, that's a bit complicated.

Well, complicated's okay.

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,840
is going to care and maintain
these endangered animals.

319
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,960
Oh, come on.

320
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,200
And then there's the remaining staff
on board and, you know.

321
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,800
If no one buys this property soon,

322
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,640
these animals will probably have to be...

323
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,480
- Well.
- Well.

324
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,520
Thanks. I mean, I don't know
anything about animals and zoos.

325
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,800
- I mean, it's a...
- It is.

326
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,160
- It is what it is.
- It is what it is.

327
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,000
Sometimes you don't know what it is
until you see what it is.

328
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,520
You know? Once you see what it is,

329
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,080
then you can figure out, is it what it is?

330
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,360
You understand?

331
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,000
- No, but we can move on.
- Yeah.

332
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,840
It's just... It's just too bad.

333
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,680
Yeah.

334
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,640
- So we keep on lookin'. Right, Rosie?
- Yeah.

one day and she gets eaten!

I like your feathers.

I like yours on your head. And I like your...

Your... No?

I said "human" interaction.

352
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,960
This is what happens when people have
a you-know-what occur in their lives.

353
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,960
They wake up one day and they say,

354
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,560
"I'm gonna quit my job and try something
completely different with my life."

355
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,400
But then they wake up another day.

356
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,880
And they say to themselves, "Thank God

"nine miles from the nearest Target store."

But maybe my older brother
didn't see this place.

- Gracias, Lupe.
- Look.

This is... This is simple destiny.

in the summertime.

set for the end of June, right?

Start handicappin' horses?

Well, now, that was a little misguided.

Go into the commercial shrimping
business and call myself Captain Dunk.

It's only two zebras.

And a lion. And a jaguar.

383
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,520
And 47 other species,
seven of which are endangered.

384
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,280
And all of them are saved
the second we make this deal.

385
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,880
The kids are gonna be so psyched.

- Yeah.

somebody to rescue them.

What?

400

Mommy used to wear that sometimes.

407
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,920
She did. This was a...

408
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,560
It started out as mine,
but she kind of adopted it.

409
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,240
But it's got rips and everything
everywhere.

410
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,960
Tough to give some of these
things away, right?

- Keep it?
- It's time.

Let that sweatshirt start over.

413

Let it start over. Okay. This is it.

But he's been stressed out.

on Paxil, but can't afford it.

477
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,480
So he's occasionally depressed.

478

No, tigers and lions are very different.

He's our eldest. He's 17.
He's a Bengal tiger.

505
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,880
You know, tigers have special sensors

506
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,040
in the front of their two-inch canines.

507
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
They can actually detect
the pulse in your aorta.

508
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,880
So when they attack, they bite you,

509
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,000
take your pulse with their teeth,

510
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,840
reposition those suckers and boom,
there goes your carotid.

511

you'll have to make straightaway, Ben.

515

Benjamin. Ben was my dad.

516
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,520
Spar, who you just met, the tiger?
He's gonna need some special care,

517
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,120
so we have a large animal vet
coming from San Diego.

518
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,920
It's just that he's a fortune
to get here and...

519
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,000
That's okay, I'll pay.

520
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,480
Well, no, he... He's also very old,

521
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,080
so the truth is, we don't really know
how much longer he's got and I...

522
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,320
Just set it up. What else do we have?

523
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,280

Look, they're not called cages,
they're called enclosures.

637
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,200
Here's the revised Duncan plan.

638
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,040
Dump the animals. Keep Kelly.

639
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,560
That's true joy.

640
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,880
It's about Rosie, man.

641
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,240
She is happy here.

642
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,520
Rosie is seven.

643
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,360
Just make her a nice zoo screensaver
and she'll be just as happy.

644
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,560
Look. I'm tryin' to give 'em
an authentic American experience.

645
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,160
And it ends with you authentically living

646
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,080
on my veloured couch
with your two children.

647
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,880
I see you working in a field, in Bolivia,

648
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,760
for angry men. With large mustaches.

649
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,320
- Hey, back off.

(DYLAN HUMMING)

651
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,120
What ya doin'?

652
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,880
You want a sandwich?

653
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,840
No. That's okay.

654
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,160
How'd you get the nosebleed?

655
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,920
I slipped on the roof and banged it.

656
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,280
It's a weird house.

657
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,040
Yeah.

658
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,280
I like your drawing.

659
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,960
Thanks.

660
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,360
It's a little dark.

661
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,600
Where's the sun?

662
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,280
There's no sun in the underworld.

663
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,160
That I'm aware of.

664
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,680
- I'm off at 4:00.
- Cool.

665
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,920
So I'll come back every day at 4:15
and bring you a sandwich.

666
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,840
Okay.

667
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,920
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

668
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,360
Mr. Mee? We've got the bill
from the feed company.

669
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,600
It's a little high, 'cause somebody
had them deliver on a Saturday.

670
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,680
Hi.

671
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,720
RHONDA: More bad news.

672
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,560
Sorry. And I'd go to the Target if you want.

673
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,080
I'm not sure if all Dwyer's clothes fit him.

674
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,640
Dylan. His name's Dylan.
His clothes are fine.

675
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,240
And I just have to say that I love this job.

676
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,320
But I keep getting calls on
the overdrafts on these checks.

677
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,040
You're three weeks overdue
on the purchase...

678
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,240
Hey, guys. I forgot to buy butter.

679
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
How important is butter
to this meal tonight?

680
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,080
We're gonna take a vote.

681
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,400
And remember,

682
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,760
it's nine miles each way
to the grocery store.

683
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,280
Nine miles.

684
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,840
Nine miles there. Nine miles back.

685
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,280
So I think the question we need to
ask ourselves as a family

686
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,920
is butter worth your dad driving 18 miles

687
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,000
right now to get it?

688
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,960
Let's vote.

689
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,800
Long day for you, Ben?

690
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,120
Long day for you.

691
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,120
You should go home.
We'll take over. We're good.

692
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,280
DYLAN: Corn's ready!

693
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,520
Eighteen miles for butter.

694
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,600
But I'm just tellin' Kelly here
that she's gotta...

695
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,640
She's gotta go have some time to herself.

696
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,640
So, just tell me what, you know,
just give me a list of what to do,

697
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,400
- and I'll do it.
- Are you sure?

698
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah, we got it.

699
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,320
Okay. Spar has a...

700
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,080
A new medication, so let me just...

701
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,680
Make sure that this gets in his food

702
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,000
- and that he eats it all.
- Okay.

703
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Turn off the lights in the garage.

704
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,720
The garage.

705
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,880
There is a new shipment of exotic snakes,

706
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,520
so just leave them in the travel crates

707
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,120
and I'll put them in the exhibit
in the morning.

708
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,720
And the monkeys need fruit as well.

709
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,840
Go home.

710
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,360
Go out.

711
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,880
Go to the city. Go find your girlfriends.

712
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,680
I think I'll just find my pillow.

713
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,600
- All right, good night.
- Night.

714
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,880
Oh! That thing.

715
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,360
You wanted me to remember that thing,

716
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,520
- and I...
- Go home.

717
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,160
Okay.

718
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,640
Nine point two miles.

719
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,240
So, technically, that's 18.4 miles for butter.

720
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,360
You know I found some, right?

721
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,280
BENJAMIN: All right, so Rosie and I'll

722
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,280
go to the tiger enclosure
and give them some water.

723
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,880
Why don't you just go over to the garage

724
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,560
and make sure the lights are off
in the side room?

725
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,520
Dad, I have a sick amount
of homework tonight.

726
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,040
Dad!

727
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,560
Get it done!

He looks tired, Dad.

732
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,880
He's gonna be okay.

733
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,520
Isn't that right, buddy?

See that? He likes us.

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,920
Dylan really loves you, you know?

737
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,880
I know.

738
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,800
He's just mad that
his friends don't visit him here.

739
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,400
He thought they would all visit.
But nobody came.

Ugh!

745
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,800
Could you possibly
point another fan at me?

746
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,280
You have three fans blowing on you.

747
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,040
I like it.

748
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,520
I can't even find you in there.
You're like a Chilean miner.

749
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,680
We're gonna have to go get

750
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,880
Kelly and maybe even get MacCready.

751
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,880
Dig you out. My goodness.
There, it's Miss...

- There's Rosie.

Don't... Don't look now.
You're happy. Ha ha!

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,040
Your happy is too loud?

Uh-oh! Whose happy is loud?

759
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,240
Now what do we have here?

760
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,600
It's our old friend.

761
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,040
I didn't think this one was gonna
make the trip.

Did Mama hurt a lot
before she had to leave us?

Well...

764
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,000
Well, do you remember

765
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,200
the night that we were tucking you in,

766
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,240
and you asked Mommy that?

767
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,200
- No?
- No.

768
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,160
Well, she said...

769
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,040
She said that it looked worse than it felt.

770
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,360
Remember? She said sometimes
people look really sick

771
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,400
but they don't feel really sick.

772
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,520
Do you feel like you can't see her?

773
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah.

774
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,720
And you feel like you can't hear her voice?

775
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,680
ROSIE: Uh-huh. But I know what to do.

776
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,200
Catch her spirit.

777
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,760
BENJAMIN: Catch her spirit. That's right.

778

- Here it comes.
- Okay, look for it.

779
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,120
There you go.

780
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,200
And put it in your heart.

781
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,560
It fell. Okay, get it.

782
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,440
Hold it there.

- Can you see her?
- Yeah.

Yeah?

- Right there.
- That's right.

in your heart and my shoulder.

Did you even read that book? Man...

You're funny with everyone else,
but never with me, which I find funny.

00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,400
Well, you know what I find funny?

800
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,440
I gotta drive you 40,000 miles to school.

801
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,120
Here you go, one, two. There you go.

802
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,440
And don't think I don't notice
you just changed the subject.

803
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,760
Dylan likes Lily.

804
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,920
Please, she's way younger than me.
She's 12.

805
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,520
It doesn't work like that.

806
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,000
She's about a foot taller.

807
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,840
Don't be a tiny person.

808
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,080
- I'm an idiot.
- Dude!

809
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,200
(HISSING)

810
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,120
I'll call Kelly.

811
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,680
This one seems really not happy with me.

812
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,520
- You got a big guy there.
- Yeah.

813
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,160
We live on a snake farm!

814
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,160
Okay. That's a... Whoa. Come on.

815
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,200
- Wow. Wow. Wow.
- (CHUCKLING)

816
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,960
Yeah, I'm... Funny, funny.

817
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,560
Glad you guys are enjoyin' yourselves.

818
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,320
I mean, how could this even happen, man?
I don't even know how you did this!

819
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,840
Dad, there's nothin' you could say to me

820
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,640
that's more harsh than
what I'm sayin' to myself!

821
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,960
Well, I disagree!

822
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,280
I just want you to be happy, man.

823
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,200
Unless you don't want to be happy.

824
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,280
What is so great about being happy?

825
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,720
That you're happy.

826
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,800
I'm sorry I messed up the box of snakes.

827
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,080
Whatever!

828
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,080
ROSIE: You're not supposed
to say that in this century.

829
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,160
He's so patronizing to me!

830
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,360
- Nice word, hotshot!
- DYLAN: Yeah!

831
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,920
Whatever!

832
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,440
(SCREAMING)

833
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,880
KELLY: Now you'll notice here
that I am stringing this cable

834
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,720
right near the hock, right near the center.

835
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,640
So I'm gonna have you
string up this carcass in a tree.

836
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,640
It's good for the tigers to feel like
they're searching for their food

837
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,000
like they do in the wild.

838
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,080
Awesome.

839
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,320
Hey, I'm pretty sure
this is none of my business,

840
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,760
but I noticed that
your kid really pushes your buttons.

841
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,240
You give him a lot of rope.

842
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,160
I did not appreciate the way
he kicked that garter snake.

843
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,680
Hey, wait, I feel like I should be
helping you here.

844
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,200
It's all good.

845
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,840
Yeah, look, he's 14,
and he went through somethin'

846
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,000
that no kid should ever have to go through,

847
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,440
so I'm givin' him a little bit of leeway.

848
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,840
Look, honestly, I don't know.

849
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,520
I'm tryin' to figure it out.
There's no manual for what happened.

850
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,560
I mean, a minute ago,
he was into paper airplanes,

851
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,120
and now he's into
portraits of decapitations.

852
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,400
- And they're really good.
- Yeah, well,

853
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,360
what do I know? I still live with my mother.

854
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,040
I'm not good with people.

855
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,000
You're doing very well.

856
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,560
You know, I expected you to be
heading for the hills by now.

857
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,360
Well, we got through today.

858
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,640
Yeah, we got through today.

859
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,800
(HUMMING)

860
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,880
(CAR APPROACHING)

861
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,240
Mayday, mayday! Kelly, do you copy?

862
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,840
- Full alert!
- Copy, full alert.

863
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,040
Contain the dark lord.

864
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,120
It's Walter Ferris.

865
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,600
BENJAMIN: But no, no, no, no.
He's supposed to come

866
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,040
a week before we open for the inspection.

867
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,280
Well, it looks like he's decided to
pay a hello visit.

868
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,280
Yeah, but we're not even close to ready.

869
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,800
KELLY: Look, just be yourself.

870
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,240
This is life or death, man.

871
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,800
Okay, got it.

872
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,880
Keep MacCready away from him.
We don't need any bloodshed today.

873
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,320
- MACCREADY: Let me out of here!
- I'm sorry, MacCready!

874
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,000
The door seems to be stuck!

875
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,800
Benjamin Mee.

876
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,400
- Walter Ferris.
- Pleasure.

877
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,440
Our inspection happens

878
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,760
a week before we open,
according to my information.

879
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,000
So I've asked for June 30th, which would

880
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,640
get us open by July 7th. 7 /7.

881
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,480
I'm here for a pop by, Mr. Mee.

882
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,800
Great. Let's schedule a pop by.

883
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,800
We've only just
really arrived here, Mr. Ferris.

884
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,440
A pop by, Mr. Mee,
is, by its very definition, a surprise.

885
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,320
I'll be taking notes in preparation
for the actual inspection.

886
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,400
As will I.

887
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,760
Now, we're responsible for the upkeep,
not just the granting of licenses.

888
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,480
Welcome to the business of
live-animal maintenance, Mr. Mee.

889
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,600
It's a real fun party.

890
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,240
Where's your zookeeper?

891
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,120
That's me. Kelly.

892
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,320
Hello, Kelly.

893
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,600
I have you down as an assistant.

894
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,800
No formal training?

895
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,040
I moved up.

896
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,480
Oh!

897
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,960
Now why would you buy this place?

898
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,360
I just can't get

899
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,440
a handle on it.

900
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,880
Wow.

901
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,120
You know, actually,

902
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,480
quite a lot's been written about

903
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,560
the innovative design of these enclosures

904
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,840
built by Peter MacCready.

905
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,280
I know all about MacCready.

906
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,680
I've been coming here long before you.

907
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,200
And I know what's in the Jaguar, too.

908
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,200
(WHIRRING)

909
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,240
You're eight inches short.

910
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,720
That's regulation.

911
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,360
New guidelines are being raised this year.

912
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,480
Raise the barrier heights, too.

913
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,480
I'd make that first priority, as well.

914
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,040
I see one of these tigers is 17 years of age?

915
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,640
Yeah, that's Spar, right here.
He had a recent bout

916
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,360
with kidney disease.
That's in remission now.

917
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,840
We're just dealin' with
a little bit of hip dysplasia.

918
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,400
Have you begun to
draw up an end-of-life plan?

919
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,480
Part of the humane care of an animal
is preparing for the inevitable...

920
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,040
He's fine.

921
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,000
We had the vet come out from San Diego,
took a look at him.

922
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,560
So we're all good there.

923
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,920
The endgame on a big cat
can be very costly.

924
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,000
I understand, but we're not there yet.

925
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,400
Thank you for your concern.

926
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,600
I guess I just don't understand
how you can call this place home.

927
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,120
You know what? Like this. It's our home.

928
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,040
Where is my old friend MacCready?

929
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,680
(GRUNTING)

930
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,960
Where is Ferris?

931
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,280
Okay, he gave us 12 top-priority items,

932
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,800
two medium-priority. We have one month.

933
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,040
How much of this
can we get done in a month?

934
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,240
MACCREADY: I'll kill him!

935
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,600
Ferris!

936
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,400
I mean, how much is this gonna cost?

937
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,200
I'm gonna have to go take a look around.

938
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,640
You know, go through it
in an itemized way, but,

939
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,160
I mean, you're gonna have to
put some more skin in the game, boss.

940
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,720
How much?

941
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,160
I'd say you're lookin' at
about a buck fifty here.

942
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,720
- Maybe a buck.
- Okay.

943
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,560
ROSIE: A dollar fifty?

944
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,960
I have that.

945
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,720
Good, go get it. We're gonna need it.

946
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,400
Good.

947
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,760
Okay.

948
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,680
Okay. Okay.

949
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,760
Okay.

950
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,240
I'm just gonna take a little walk
and wrap my brain around this one.

951
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,160
Well,

952
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,200
Ferris lusts you.

953
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,960
I'm not takin' one for the team,
if that's what you're gettin' after.

954
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,080
I'm not gettin' after anything like that.

955
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,600
No way.

956
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,720

01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,800
Hey, listen, I gotta go.

1116
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,480
Don't tell anybody what I heard, okay?

1117
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,360
Sure! Thanks!

1118
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,360
You don't have to leave so fast.

1119
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,080
I'm goin' home.

1120
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,840
It's Rhonda.
She's leavin' for some job in Mexico

1121
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,480
and she just turned everybody against you.

1122
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:38,400
They're all in there. Says you don't
have any more money, man.

1123
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,520
- She says you're a fraud.
- I got it.

1124
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,920
Well...

1125
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,920
I want to say it has been
an amazing experience here.

1126
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:59,400
Each of you,
I've come to know in some small way.

1127
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,800
But the financial climate being what it is,

1128
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,760
- (SCOFFS)
- I think none of us thought we'd...

1129
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,920
Well...

1130
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,360
I don't know how to say this.

1131
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:24,040
I've been an adventure addict
my whole life.

1132
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:27,600
With no big regard for cost.

1133
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,920
With... Well, with no regard for cost.

1134
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,960
Basically, I was just an observer
and a writer.

1135
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,400
But this is my first real adventure.

1136
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,480
And I just want to say that

1137
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,960
it's been the best one of all
because it's personal.

1138
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,520
And thanks to my Katherine,

1139
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,480
the money came through.

1140
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,520
So, I don't know what you've heard,

1141
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:22,040
but I am able to say,
though I don't have a lot,

1142
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,520
I do have enough to get us by.

1143
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,160
And if you stick with me,
I will give this everything.

1144
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:32,200
But I will need everything from you
and we are going to reopen this zoo.

1145
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,640
It is the best job in the world.

1146
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,880
And it's gonna take everything
to make it work.

1147
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:44,640
So don't... Don't give up on our adventure.

1148
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,520
Well, that's good enough for me.

1149
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,040
- LILY: Me, too.
- Done, man.

1150
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,400
- All right.
- Whoo!

1151
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,360
Yeah!

1152
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,680
Circus money, man.

1153
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,360
Our adventure is just beginning.

1154
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:02,920
That's not what I meant.

1155
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,120
I know.

1156
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,960
And Rhonda?

1157
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,920
I wish you the best in Mexico.

1158
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,360
I don't speak Spanish.

1159
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,240
Adiós.

1160
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,280
All right.

1161
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,600
(SQUEAKING)

1162
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,800
Cut!

1163
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,800
- All right!
- Almost there, buddy!

1164
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,600
You just get that hat?

1165
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,160
So you woke up this morning
and you thought to yourself...

1166
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,840
It's cold.

1167
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,480
..."I'm gonna put on this hat."

1168
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,320
Why? What do I look like in the hat?

1169
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,720
(LAUGHS)

1170
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,320
I think Spar will like these.

1171
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,320
All right, do we need anything else
while we're in the land of people?

1172
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,920
Nope. I'm good.

1173
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,120
Yeah?

1174
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,560
How come you don't tell stories anymore?

1175
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,840
Well, because we're livin' the story.

1176
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,520
I wish we could tell Mom that.

1177
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,360
You don't think Mom knows?

1178
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,000
I know she knows.

1179
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,800
Me, too.

1180
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,080
Okay. $74.39.

1181
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,280
(EXHALES)

1182
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,840
I don't come up with the prices.

1183
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,200
No, it's not the prices. It's me.

1184
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,560
It's really well worn.

1185
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,400
- It might not work.
- It'll work.

1186
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,560
- It... It'll work.
- No, no, no.

1187
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,720
It's just that it says
"Rosemoor Animal Park".

1188
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,000
- That's the one.
- You work there?

1189
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,480
I do, and I also own it.

1190
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,360
Strange but true.

1191
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,400
- We bought a zoo!
- Throttle down.

1192
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,200
I love that zoo!

1193
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,680
Really?

1194
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,400
Oh, my... We used to go there all the time!

1195
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,280
- Is it gonna open again soon?
- BENJAMIN: Yes.

1196
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,960
We're gonna open in a few days.

1197
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,880
We're goin' for the 7th, 7 /7.

1198
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,400
7 /7. Well, you know what?
I'm gonna be there.

1199
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,880
You reserve me nine tickets,
'cause I'm gonna bring the in-laws.

1200
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,560
And maybe we could feed
a couple of 'em to the tigers.

1201
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,920
(LAUGHING)

1202
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,160
Thank you so much.

1203
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,800
I'm sorry. Mister! Your bulbs.

1204
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1205
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,600
- 7 /7.
- 7 /7.

1206
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,240
You want to hear somethin' crazy?
I think we're gonna be okay.

1207
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,160
(GROANS)

1208
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,880
Come on, man, we talked about this.

1209
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,800
You gotta eat that food to get all the meds.

1210
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,120
You know, there's a major buzz
waitin' for you inside that meat.

1211
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,760
Your neurotransmitters are gonna be firin'

1212
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,320
all the way to the moon and back.

1213
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,680
You'll be dating seven-year-olds.

1214
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,600
Have every house cat from here to El Cajon.

1215
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,320
Buddy, if you don't eat the food

1216
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,480
- and you don't get your medicine,
- (SNARLING)

1217
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,800
it all goes downhill very fast.

1218
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,520
I'm tellin' you the truth.

1219
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,600
Trust me.

1220
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,440
Come on, man, we're almost there.

1221
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,520
You gotta stick with me.

1222
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,320
We got opening day comin' up.

1223
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,560
He's fine. He's okay.

1224
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,000
- Hey.
- He got up there and can't come down.

1225
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,200
Well, can we use the ladder?

1226
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,040
We tried luring him with food.

1227
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,360
He's gotta come down from there.

1228
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,960
He's gotta eat his food,
he's gotta drink water,

1229
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,080
he's gotta take his medication.

1230
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,320
He's dehydrated.

1231
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,600
I mean, we've gotta
get him into the enclosure.

1232
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,520
Are the other two inside?

1233
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,840
- Benjamin!
- Look, if he moves to attack me,

1234
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,240
at least he'll be moving, right?

1235
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,840
- He's slow, I can outrun him.
- It's not a bullfight.

1236
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,520
Benjamin!

1237
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,560
I think it's time.

1238
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,600
For what?

1239
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,880
He's ready. Let's call the vet.

1240
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,680
You're the owner. You have to okay this.

1241
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:28,920
No, man.

1242
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,440
Look, this doesn't feel right.

1243
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,120
Benjamin, it never feels right.

1244
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,440
- Stuck?
- Yeah, stuck. He's stuck.

1245
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,160
- Anybody, ideas?
- Loud noises scare the big cats.

1246
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,720
Loud noises scare the big cats.

1247
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,800
Wait. Hold on.

1248
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:48,880
LILY: We can scare him
into goin' back in.

1249
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,240
That's a good idea. All right,

1250
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,400
- when I give the signal...
- Hey, hold on a sec.

1251
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,320
...you guys just yell, scream,
make as much noise as possible.

1252
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,720
Spar's gonna hate it,
but maybe he'll come down.

1253
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,880
I don't know. It's our only option.

1254
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,160
- Hold on.
- KELLY: So, guys, get pots, pans,

1255
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,400
stuff like that, okay?

1256
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,000
Nathan? Nathan, go to two.

1257
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,560
Nathan? Nathan, wake up!

1258
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,960
- (ALL SHOUTING)
- Come on, get off!

1259
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,680
ROBIN: Get off of there, Spar!

1260
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,760
MAN: We love you, Spar!

1261
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:16,640
Come on! Come down, Spar!
Come on down!

1262
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,920
Come on, honey, come down for us!

1263
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,520
Come on, get down, Spar! Get down!

1264
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,640
Come on, Spar! Come on, come on!

1265
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,120
Get down off the rock, Spar!

1266
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,680
Come on down!

1267
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,280
Come on, hotshot, come on!

1268
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:38,040
Would you just do what's good for you?
Will you listen and get off the rock?

1269
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,160
Would you just listen sometimes
and do what's good for you?

1270
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,800
- Come on, Spar! Come on!
- You're an animal! You can't do this to me!

1271
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,440
Come on, baby!

1272
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,200
That's it! That's it, that's it! Go, go there!

1273
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,960
BENJAMIN: Get off the rocks!
Get off the rocks!

1274
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,440
(ALL CHEERING)

1275
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,840
Do you think I want to do this by myself?

1276
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,240
Do you think I want to come out here

1277
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,880
and drag you out here?

1278
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,960
I did it because I was desperate!

1279
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,240
Benjamin?

1280
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,240
Hey, look, I'm feelin'
a real lack of privacy right now.

1281
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,240
Like, maybe we're all a bit
in each other's pockets.

1282
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,080
Can't you see his legs? He's suffering, man.

1283
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,600
He's in a lot of pain.
I can't stand to watch it.

1284
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,920
- I know him. I see it.
- Yeah, I mean, I know him.

1285
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,640
Hey! Hey.

1286
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,480
He's in so much pain.

1287
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,880
They can't tell you, but they show you.
You know, they show you.

1288
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,000
Well, hang on.
What is all the cheering about, then?

1289
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,560
- He's okay.
- It's going to happen.

1290
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,720
He's better.

1291
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,240
It's going to happen.

1292
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,280
- Don't repeat it to me like I'm a kid.
- It's going to happen.

1293
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,680
You've never done this before!
You don't know how this goes!

1294
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,360
I know exactly how this goes.

1295
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,800
And I invite you to
tell me about that sometime.

1296
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,240
But this is a rookie mistake.

1297
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,680
I've been with him for 13 years.

1298
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,920
You can't see how selfish this is,

1299
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,240
to extend this?
Come on, you're too smart not to.

1300
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,200
I'm saying, we just let him live
for a couple more weeks.

1301
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,400
Get him some medicine and
invest in a little bit of hope!

1302
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,840
No, I can't stand by and watch this happen!

1303
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,440
- I'm not gonna do it!
- Well, it's not up to you.

1304
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,640
It's gonna happen.

1305
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,720
Don't make me get angry.

1306
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,560
'Cause that would just
be so terrible, if you got angry.

1307
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,080
You know what the right thing to do is!

1308
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,760
I'm so disappointed in you.

1309
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,000
Well, you don't even
know me well enough to say that!

1310
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,600
Hi, Lucy.
When are you gonna have those babies?

1311
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,160
Hey, Rosie. Your dad around?

1312
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,920
He said he was goin' to think.
He does that sometimes.

1313
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,000
You guys makin' dinner?

1314
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,600
- No.
- Well, let me help you.

1315
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,680
- I'll order a pizza or something.
- No, look, it's fine.

1316
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,760
Look, Dad'll be back soon.
He's just having a mood.

1317
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,760
KELLY: Yeah? How long do those last?

1318
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,520
A couple of years.

1319
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,400
Pizza. Pizza, pizza, pizza.

1320
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,880
Smells good.

1321
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,560
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1322
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,400
- You miss Lily?
- Me?

1323
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,480
- No.
- I bet you put all your feelings

1324
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,960
- into your drawings?
- Nah, not really.

1325
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,880
I guess I just can't talk to girls that well?

1326
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,000
Well, talkin' to girls is easy.
They'll tell you everything.

1327
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,520
The secret to talking is listening.

1328
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,120
I thought if I came out here it would stop.

1329
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,680
Back home, every place
reminded me of her.

1330
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:40,200
Filippe's on Third Street. Balboa Park.

1331
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,920
Little Dom's, the coffee shop,
that... That's a big one.

1332
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,280
I mean, the air,
the way it smelled in May and August,

1333
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,640
because those were the months that her

1334
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:51,480
favorite bushes grew flowers
all over our neighborhood.

1335
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,160
They're all triggers, man.

1336
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,600
And it got better for a while.

1337
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,280
I mean, it... It did, out here.

1338
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,320
But the funny thing is that

1339
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,440
it just turns out that she's here, too.

1340
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,520
I mean, I go to Home Depot.
I go to the nine-miles-away Target.

1341
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,720
We need a new store.

1342
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,000
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1343
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,320
And seriously, I'm avoiding half the aisles.

1344
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:17,800
Condiments.

1345
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,440
Pastries, forget about it.

1346
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:24,720
She loved red kites
and blueberry Pop-Tarts.

1347
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,440
I mean, who doesn't, right?

1348
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,640
Who doesn't?

1349
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,160
If only I could talk to her
about getting over her.

1350
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,920
Yeah.

1351
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:44,000
And most of all, it's the kids.
They're the biggest triggers of all.

1352
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,240
BENJAMIN: I mean, Dylan. His eyes.

1353
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,920
You know, I've only seen
that expression in somebody's eyes

1354
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,920
once in my life.

1355
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,000
And the way he just drives me nuts,
he makes me crazy.

1356
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,280
Denies me, frustrates me.

1357
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,840
And all the time,
he's looking back at me with her eyes.

1358
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,160
And none of her lightness.

1359
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:16,640
What I've figured out is that
when you love somebody that much,

1360
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:19,360
that hard, that long,

1361
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,000
you can never get away from them,
no matter where you go.

1362
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,200
And that only comes

1363
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,400
once in a lifetime.

1364
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,840
Just can't get a handle on it.

1365
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,320
I cannot let go.

1366
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,200
I can.

1367
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,560
Sleep well, Benjamin. Sweet dreams.

1368
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:10,680
I get it now, okay?
I get why you can't stand me!

1369
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,000
Okay. All right.

1370
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,240
No. At least now I know the real reason
why you hate me!

1371
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,880
Look, I heard you admit it to her.

1372
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,920
Like you were talking about cornflakes.

1373
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,240
You hate me!

1374
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,000
I hate you? Wait a second.

1375
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,920
Okay, we've had some problems, man,
but we're figurin' it out, okay?

1376
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,560
That is bullshit!

1377
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,240
Admit it! You wish I wasn't here!

1378
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,440
With that expression in my eyes?

1379
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,920
I heard you!

1380
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,480
Hold on! Enough with the drama! All right?

1381
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,600
Knock it off! You misheard me!

1382
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,680
I can't stand it here!
Look, can't you see that?

1383
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,040
No, but thank you for telling me, again!

1384
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,600
I keep forgetting! It's all about you!

1385
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:50,480
Why don't I just pack us up?
We'll just go on the road together.

1386
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,720
We could be hobos.

1387
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,640
Because you wasted all our money!

1388
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,440
Some of that belonged to me, Dad!

1389
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,440
I didn't waste our money.
I thought you liked it here.

1390
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,760
And I'm sorry, I thought your friends
would come out and visit you, man.

1391
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,600
I called them all myself and I invited 'em.

1392
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:07,320
And I'm sorry,
I thought you and Lily were friends.

1393
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,640
I thought, I thought, I thought...

1394
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,160
I thought this was...

1395
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,320
I mean, I thought you liked me!

1396
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,760
I thought this was
a dream come true for us!

1397
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,600
It's your dream!

1398
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,880
You can't force a dream
onto someone else, Dad!

1399
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:17,960
Yes, I can!

1400
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,720
- I can force a dream on you!
- Why are you yelling?

1401
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,560
Because it's a good dream!

1402
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,440
And it's got cool animals in it
and some pretty great people, too!

1403
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,400
And because I'm your father
and I'm the only one you've got!

1404
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,960
And the line of people in this world
who really care about you ends here!

1405
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:35,120
So stop moping around this place, man!

1406
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,480
And pick up a shovel and dig a hole!

1407
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,480
Do something!

1408
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,240
You just sit here
and feel sorry for yourself, man!

1409
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,760
Help me with your sister!

1410
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,760
- Help me, damn it!
- Help me, damn it! Help me!

1411
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,840
(SIGHS)

1412
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,880
I'm sorry that your mother
got sick when she did.

1413
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:02,800
Believe me.

1414
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:09,880
I'm sorry that you didn't get
more of a childhood, man.

1415
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,400
That's just how that one went.

1416
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:19,360
But we live with a seven-year-old girl
who still believes in the Easter Bunny.

1417
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,480
What are we gonna do?

1418
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,440
You never ask me how I'm doin'.

1419
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,840
You never even taught me how to shave.

1420
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,040
What, you want to know how to shave?

1421
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,080
I would love to teach you how to shave!

Is it time?

1426
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,320
What happened with you and Lily?

1427
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,520
I don't know.

1428
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:13,920
I guess I didn't listen to something
she told me or somethin'?

1429
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,240
I mean, I liked her.

1430
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,720
It's like you embarrass yourself
if you say something,

1431
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,640
and you embarrass yourself if you don't.

You know, sometimes all you need
is 20 seconds of insane courage.

1435
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:47,000
Just, literally 20 seconds
of just embarrassing bravery.

1436
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:52,040
And I promise you,
something great will come of it.

1437
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,240
I never know what to say to you.

1438
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,120
I'm the same way.

1439
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:22,760
Why don't we just tell each other
what we wish the other guy would say?

"I'm sorry I brought you out to the sticks."

In the trunk of this car is haddock.

- Are you serious?
- No.

Serious is the smell in that car.

- Yeah. It fits.

- Love our logo, she's a beaut.

- Worse.

is to jimmy it from the inside.

from the other side of this enclosure

we did this whole thing for nothing?

You've come this far. Huh?

Plus, I wasn't named after Bob Dylan.

1605
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:57,280
I was named after a dog named Dylan.

Or better yet, just stay indoors.

just handed me his umbrella.

01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,920
I love that you're telling stories again.

1736
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:28,720
This is the story before the story.

1737
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:32,720
This is where you and you begin.

1738
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,880
Because this is where I met your mom.

1739
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:39,400
She was sitting right there in that chair.

1740
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,640
Hang on.

1741
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:51,840
Hey, hey. So,

1742
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,360
I was walkin' by.

1743
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:00,000
And I saw her and I literally stopped,
like this, just stopped.

1744
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:02,840
And went, "Oh, my God.

1745
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:07,000
"That is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen in my entire life."

1746
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:08,480
But I've never done anything like this.

1747
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,440
I'd never gone and talked
to a total stranger before.

1748
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,760
But she was right there.

1749
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:18,160
And so I thought to myself,
"20 seconds." Right?

1750
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:20,800
Go.

1751
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:29,200
Now I'm in the restaurant. And I'm terrified.

1752
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,160
Thinkin' about leaving.

1753
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:33,840
I can actually touch her. She's right there.

1754
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,640
She still hasn't seen me.

1755
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,400
And I still have 15 seconds of courage left.

1756
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,480
I'm goin' for it.

1757
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:42,200
Bravery.

1758
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:44,640
Here's what I said.

1759
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,480
What?

1760
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:55,760
(SIGHS)

1761
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,640
I said,

1762
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,800
"Excuse me."

1763
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:24,520
Hi, Mom.

1764
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,080
Hi, Mommy.

1765
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:37,560
"Why would an amazing woman like you

1766
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:41,040
"even talk to someone like me?"

1767
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:48,960
(CHUCKLES)

1768
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:50,960
Why not?

1769
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:53,640
(GATHERING STORIES PLAYING)

1770
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,000
And then I heard you

1771
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:43,960
You made me long for

1772
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,360
To be a part of

1773
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:52,040
Something that I can't see

1774
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:55,000
A life that is beyond

1775
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:59,760
Something that I can't fear

1776
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:02,760
To be a part of

1777
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:07,600
The story, it belongs to you

1778
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:26,440
Something you said burns

1779
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:29,520
Apart the pen and the paper

1780
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:33,520
You can't always write it

1781
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:38,120
It is something you have to do

1782
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:41,080
Gathering stories

1783
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:45,880
A story, it belongs to you

1784
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,800
They say that it's gone now

1785
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:53,320
You know that I disagree

1786
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:12,560
I barely hear you

1787
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,720
Your signal is cold now

1788
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,080
So turn me into

1789

Video

1790
02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:30,920
Tune the radio

1791
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:39,560
Sing along

1792
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:46,840
To all our favorite songs

1793
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:54,160
Your signal is growing

1794
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:57,960
Out in little pieces

1795
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:02,120
And watch in a moment

1796
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:05,480
Secure it for falling

1797
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,080
Over the stars

1798
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,080
Over the nights

1799
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:16,080
Over the rains

1800
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:17,920
Over the moons

1801
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Over the days

1802
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:21,880
Over the streams

1803
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,720
Over the skies

1804
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,600
Over the ponds

1805
02:02:25,680 --> 02:02:27,440
Over the fires

1806
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:29,520
Over the lakes

1807
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:31,360
Over the trees

1808
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:33,240
Over the minds

1809
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:35,120
Our kid zigs

1810
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:37,240
Opens doors

1811
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:39,080
Over the doors

1812
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:40,800
I am alive
