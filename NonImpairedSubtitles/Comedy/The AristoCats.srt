00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:27,096
Which pets’ address
is the finest in Paris

2
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:31,008
Which pets possess
the longest pedigree

3
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:35,037

00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:43,151
Which pets are blessed
with the fairest forms and faces

6
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:47,092
Which pets know best
all the gentle social graces

Which pets live
on cream and loving pats

8
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:54,296
Naturellement
The Aristocats

9
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:58,964
They show "aristocatic" bearing
when they're seen upon an airing

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,976
An "aristocatic" flair in
what they do and what they say

11
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:05,842
Aristocats are never found
in alleyways

12
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,079
Or hanging 'round the garbage cans
where common kitties play, oh, no

13
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:15,111
Which pets are known
to never show their claws

14
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:19,091
Which pets are prone
to hardly any flaws

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,028
To which pets do the others
tip their hats

16
00:01:23,097 --> 00:01:27,056
Naturellement
The Aristocats

17
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:38,931
Marie, my little one...

18
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:40,905
you're going to be as beautiful
as your mother.

19
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:41,462
you're going to be as beautiful
as your mother.

20
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,564
Isn't she, Duchess?

21
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,173
Careful, Toulouse!

22
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:54,980
You're making it very difficult
for Edgar.

23
00:02:57,121 --> 00:03:00,113
Whoa, Frou-Frou, whoa.
Steady, girl.

24
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,164
Thank you, Edgar.

25
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:10,860
Oh, of course, Frou-Frou.

26
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:13,870
I almost forgot.

27
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:17,101
Madame, uh, uh, may I take
your parcel, Madame?

28
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:19,370
It really is much too heavy
for you, Madame.

29
00:03:19,443 --> 00:03:22,879
Now, tut tut, Edgar.
Don't fuss over me.

30
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:30,579
Berlioz, come back here. Haven't you
forgotten something, darling?

31
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:34,591
Thank you, Miss Frou-Frou, for
letting me ride on your back.

32
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,561
- You're quite welcome, young man.
- How was that, Mama?

33
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:41,393
Very good, darling.
That was very nice.

34
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:45,993
Come along, Duchess, kittens.
Come along.

35
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,473
Oh, and Edgar, I'm expecting
my attorney, Georges Hautecourt.

36
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,509
You remember him, of course.

37
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:54,977
Of course, Madame.

38
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:57,742
How could anyone forget him?

39
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:10,920
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh

40
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:15,689
Oh!

41
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:21,404
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de...

42
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:26,136
Whoops! Oh, ho, ho. I'm not
as spry as I was when I was 80. Eh?

43
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,340
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh

44
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:37,052
Ah, good day, sir.
Madame is expecting you, sir.

45
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:39,112
Evening!
Evening, Edgar.

46
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,921
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh
Ta-rah-rah boom de-eh

47
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:45,622
Oh, another ringer, sir.
You never miss.

48
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:50,294
Come on, Edgar. The last one
up the stairs is a nincompoop.

49
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:52,768
Uh, uh, could we take
the elevator this time, sir?

50
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:55,601
Oh, oh, that birdcage?
Poppycock!

51
00:04:55,673 --> 00:04:58,233
Elevators are for old people.
Whoops!

52
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,641
Uh, may I give you a hand, sir?

53
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:04,078
You haven't got an extra foot,
have you, Edgar?

54
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:08,380
That always makes me laugh, sir.
Yes. Ha, ha. Every time.

55
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:11,250
- Whoa, ah! Let go of my cane!
- Ooh, ah, careful, sir.

56
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:13,449
Oh, please.
l-l-I'm frightfully sorry, sir.

57
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:18,253
Don't panic, Edgar.

58
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:21,355
Upward and onward.
Whee!

59
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:23,559
Am I going too fast
for you, Edgar?

60
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,659
Oh, please, sir, hold...

61
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:33,402
There now, Duchess.
That's better.

62
00:05:33,477 --> 00:05:36,878
We must both look our best
for Georges.

63
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:40,678
He's our oldest and
dearest friend, you know.

64
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:45,718
Come in.

65
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,487
Announcing Monsieur...

66
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:54,526
Georges Hautecourt.

67
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:58,090
Oh, my goodness, Edgar,
I know Georges.

68
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,935
Adelaide, my, my dear.

69
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:06,171
So good to see you, Georges.

70
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:11,876
Ah, still the softest hands
in all of Paris, eh?

71
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:16,215
You're a shameless flatterer,
Georges.

72
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:22,551
Adelaide, that's, that's music!
It's from Carmen, isn't it?

73
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:25,686
That's right.
It was my favorite role.

74
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:27,924
Yes, yes!

75
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:31,866
It was the night of your grand premiere
that we first met, remember?

76
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:35,531
- Oh, indeed, I do.
- And how we celebrated your success.

77
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:38,370
Champagne.
Dancing the night away.

78
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:47,550
Oh, Georges!

79
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,194
Oh.

80
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:10,536
Oh, thank goodness.

81
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:13,304
Just in time.

82
00:07:13,377 --> 00:07:18,906
Ah, Georges, we're just a pair
of sentimental old fools.

83
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:26,618
Now, Georges, do be serious.

84
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,059
I've asked you to come here on
a very important legal matter.

85
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:34,620
Uh! Oh!
Splendid, splendid!

86
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:36,893
Who do you want me
to sue, eh?

87
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:40,027
Oh, come now, Georges.
I don't wish you to sue anyone.

88
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:42,265
I simply want
to make my will.

89
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:45,103
Will, eh?
Will. Will.

90
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:52,876
Now then, who are
the beneficiaries?

91
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,784
Well, as you know,
I have no living relatives...

92
00:07:56,854 --> 00:08:02,087
and naturally, I want my beloved cats
to be always well cared for.

93
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:06,619
And certainly no one can do this better
than my faithful servant, Edgar.

94
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:08,130
Edgar?

95
00:08:08,265 --> 00:08:12,395
Adelaide, you mean to say you're
leaving your vast fortune to Edgar?

96
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,529
Everything you possess?

97
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:19,042
Stocks and bonds? This, this mansion?
Your country chateau?

98
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:22,135
Art treasures? Jewels?
And, and...

99
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:25,512
Oh, no, no, Georges.
To my cats.

100
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,245
- To your cats?
- Cats!

101
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,551
Yes, Georges, I simply wish
to have the cats inherit first.

102
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:34,921
Then, at the end
of their life span...

103
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:37,984
my entire estate
will revert to Edgar.

104
00:08:38,062 --> 00:08:41,964
Cats inherit first!
And I come after the cats.

105
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:47,095
l, me, after... No.
It's, it's not fair! Oh!

106
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:50,004
I mean... Ooh!
Each cat'll live about 12 years.

107
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:52,542
I can't wait...
And, and each cat has nine lives.

108
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,671
That's... Four times 12,
and multiply by nine times.

109
00:08:56,747 --> 00:09:01,377
No, it's less than that. Well, anyway,
it's much longer than I'd ever live.

110
00:09:01,452 --> 00:09:04,319
I'll be gone.

111
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:08,620
No. Oh, no.
They'll be gone.

112
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:10,626
I'll think of a way.

113
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:13,527
Why, there are a million
reasons why I should.

114
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:16,290
All of them dollars.

115
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:18,528
Millions.

116
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:22,436
Those cats have got to go!

117
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:27,667
- Wait for me. Wait for me.
- Me first. Me first.

118
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:30,976
Why should you be first?

119
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,573
Because I'm a lady,
that's why.

120
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:35,035
Ha-uh. You're not a lady.

121
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:36,002
Ha-uh. You're not a lady.

122
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:38,663
You're nothin' but a sister.

123
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,475
I'll show you
if I'm a lady or not.

124
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:51,979
- You're tickling.
- Get her, Berlioz, get her.

125
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:58,518
Fight fair, Marie.

126
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:02,153
Females never fight fair.

127
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:05,198
Ah! Now that hurt.
Mama, Mama!

128
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:07,995
Marie, darling, Marie,
you must stop that.

129
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:12,596
Th-This is really not ladylike.
And, Berlioz...

130
00:10:12,673 --> 00:10:16,700
but such behavior is most unbecoming
to a lovely gentleman.

131
00:10:16,777 --> 00:10:18,802
Well, she started it.

132
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,042
Ladies do not start fights...

133
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:24,549
but they can finish them.

134
00:10:24,618 --> 00:10:27,382
Berlioz, now don't be rude.

135
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:30,218
We were just practicing
biting and clawing.

136
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,556
Aristocats do not practice
biting and clawing...

137
00:10:34,628 --> 00:10:36,721
and things like that,
that's just horrible.

138
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:40,164
But someday we might meet
a tough alley cat.

139
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:51,043
Now, that will do.
It's time we concerned ourselves
with self-improvement.

140
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:54,706
Now, you want to grow up to be lovely,
charming ladies and gentlemen.

141
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,909
Now, Toulouse you go and start
on with your painting.

142
00:10:57,984 --> 00:10:59,611
Yes, Mama.

143
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:06,152
Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint
before we start our music lesson?

144
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:10,128
- Please?
- Well, yes, my love, but...

145
00:11:10,197 --> 00:11:12,722
- Whoops.
-you must be very quiet.
- Uh-oh.

146
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:26,545
Uh-huh.

147
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,852
Yeah.

148
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:43,828
- It's Edgar.
- Yeah, old pickle puss Edgar!

149
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:48,801
Old pickle puss!
Now, now, Berlioz.

150
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,996
That is not kind.

151
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:53,699
You know Edgar is so fond
of all of us...

152
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:56,436
and takes very good care of us.

153
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,640
Rock-a-bye kitties
Bye-bye you go

154
00:12:01,915 --> 00:12:05,373
La-la-la-la
And I'm in the dough

155
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:07,784
Oh, Edgar,
you sly old fox.

156
00:12:15,662 --> 00:12:17,823
Oops! Oh, dear.

157
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:20,594
A slip of the hand
and it's off to dreamland.

158
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:24,228
I say, that's not at all bad.
Slip of the hand, dreamland.

159
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:26,670
Now, let's leave Toulouse
to his painting.

160
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,343
Now, dear, you go to the piano.
Now, run along, both of you. Go ahead.

161
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:34,778
- Yes, Mama.
- Yes, Mama.

162
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:39,012
It's time to practice
your scales and your arpeggios.

163
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:41,178
Ouch!

164
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:59,668
I'm ready, maestro.

165
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:05,239
Oh! Mama,
he did it again.

166
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,971
- Tattletale.
- Now, Berlioz.

167
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:11,108
Now, please, darling,
settle down...

168
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:13,778
and play me
your pretty little song.

169
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:15,481
Yes, Mama.

170
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:20,182
Do, me, so
Do, do, so, me, do

171
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,163
Every truly cultured
music student knows

172
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:30,465
You must learn your scales
and your arpeggios

173
00:13:30,537 --> 00:13:35,099
Bring the music ringing from
your chest and not your nose

174
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:39,669
While you sing your scales
and your arpeggios

175
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:46,413
If you're faithful
to your daily practicing

176
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:51,446
You will find your progress
is encouraging

177
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:56,360
Do, me, so, me, do, me, so, me
Fa, la, so it goes

178
00:13:56,429 --> 00:14:01,492
When you do your scales
and your arpeggios

179
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:03,433
Do, me, so, do...

180
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:17,773
Do, me, so
Do, do, so, me, do

181
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:20,115
Do, me, so
Do, do, so, me, do

182
00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:25,180
Though at first it seems
as though it doesn't show

183
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:29,957
Like a tree
ability will bloom and grow

184
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:35,935
If you're smart you'll learn
by heart what every artist knows

185
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:40,029
You must sing your scales
and your

186
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:45,772
Arpeggios

187
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,986
Ah, good evening,
my little ones.

188
00:15:10,503 --> 00:15:14,803
Your favorite dish
prepared in a very special way.

189
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:17,638
It's creme de la creme
a la Edgar.

190
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:21,408
Sleep well. l, I mean,
eat, eat well, of course.

191
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:41,864
Good evening, Duchess.
Hello, kittens.

192
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:44,199
- Hello, Roquefort!
- Hi, Roquefort!

193
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,262
Uh, good evening
Monsieur Roquefort.

194
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,276
Mmm. Something smells
awfully good.

195
00:15:51,344 --> 00:15:53,869
Mmm, what is
that appetizing smell?

196
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:56,882
It's creme de la creme
a la Edgar.

197
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,350
Oh, won't you join us,
Monsieur Roquefort?

198
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:03,150
Well, yes. l, I mean, well,
I don't mean to interrupt.

199
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:08,752
But... But it so happens
that I have a cracker with me.

200
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:11,092
Come on, Roquefort,
have some.

201
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:14,691
Oh, thank you.
Don't mind if I do.

202
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:16,895
Just a few dunks.

203
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:21,233
Mmm. Ooh, very good.

204
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:23,241
My compliments
to the chef.

205
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:25,903
Mmm, this is yummy.

206
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:29,843
Mmm, delicious.

207
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:33,479
Double delicious.

208
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:37,148
This calls for another cracker.
I'll be right back.

209
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:52,895
So that's...

210
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:57,906
creme de la creme...

211
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:01,205
a la Edgar.

212
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:49,650
Lafayette.
Hey, Lafayette.

213
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,449
- Lafayette!
- Well, I'm right here.

214
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:56,686
Listen.
Wheels approachin'.

215
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,888
Oh, Napoleon, we done bit
six tires today.

216
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:02,796
Chased four motorcars
and a bicycle and a scooter.

217
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:06,131
Hush your mouth!

218
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:08,796
It's a motorcycle.
Two cylinder.

219
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,806
Chain drive.

220
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:14,366
One squeaky wheel,
on the front, it sounds like.

221
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:18,904
Now, you go for the tires, and I'll go
right for the seat of the problem.

222
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:21,780
How come you always grab
the tender part for yourself?

223
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:25,747
'Cause I outrank you,
that's why.

224
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:29,087
Now, stop beatin' your gums
and sound the attack.

225
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:34,493
No, that's mess call.

226
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:36,191
Made a mess of it, huh?

227
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:38,291
You can be replaced,
you know.

228
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:40,802
Okay, let's charge.

229
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,202
Wait a minute.
I'm the leader!

230
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:46,640
I'm the one that says
when we go.

231
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,611
Here we go.
Charge!

232
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:29,373
Nice doggie, nice doggie.
Heel, roll over, play dead.

233
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,014
Yeow!

234
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:39,686
This sure beats runnin',
Napoleon.

235
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:30,212
- Step on the gas, Napoleon.
- I got her wide open.

236
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:35,909
Ow!

237
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,290
Yeow!

238
00:22:20,597 --> 00:22:23,657
Oh! Oh, where am I?

239
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,125
I'm not at home at all.

240
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:30,011
Children, where are you?
Answer me.

241
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:30,670
Children, where are you?
Answer me.

242
00:22:30,745 --> 00:22:34,545
Berlioz, Toulouse, Marie,
where are you?

243
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:36,709
Here I am, Mama.

244
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:41,854
Marie, darling.
Ar-Are you all right?

245
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:46,053
Uh, I guess I had a nightmare
and fell out of bed.

246
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:48,994
Now, Marie darling,
n-now, now don't be frightened.

247
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:52,931
- Mama! Mama!
- That's Berlioz!

248
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:55,333
Over here, darling Berlioz.
Here we are.

249
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:58,570
A-And don't worry. Everything
is going to be all right.

250
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,404
I'm comin', Mama.

251
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:05,105
Gee, I'm cold and I'm wet.

252
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:06,737
Mama?

253
00:23:06,814 --> 00:23:08,645
Mama?

254
00:23:08,716 --> 00:23:10,809
Mama!

255
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:14,280
Oh, darling.

256
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:17,222
That's only a little frog,
my love.

257
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:20,022
But he had a mouth
like a "hippolotamus."

258
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:26,296
Oh, what's so funny?

259
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:29,302
Now, now, darling... Darlings,
now you just stay here...

260
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,895
and I go and I look
for Toulouse.

261
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:35,431
Toulouse!
Toulouse, where are you?

262
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,377
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!

263
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:41,574
- Toulouse!
- Hey.

264
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:44,083
What's all the yellin' about, huh?

265
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:45,710
Why didn't you answer?

266
00:23:45,787 --> 00:23:49,655
Mama, he's been here
all the time.

267
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:52,022
Oh, thank goodness.
Oh.

268
00:23:52,093 --> 00:23:54,027
A-Are you all right?

269
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:56,825
I was having
a funny dream.

270
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:58,832
Edgar was in it.

271
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,996
And we were all riding
and bouncing along...

272
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:08,839
Frogs? Uh-oh, it wasn't a dream.
Edgar did this to us.

273
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,639
Edgar?

274
00:24:10,712 --> 00:24:15,411
Oh, darling, why, that's...
Why, that's ridiculous!

275
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:18,247
Yeah. Maybe you fell
on your head, Toulouse.

276
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:24,591
Mama, I'm afraid.
I wanna go home.

277
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:29,028
Now, now, my darling, now don't
be frightened. You'll see...

278
00:24:29,097 --> 00:24:32,931
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Now, let's
get into the basket, all of us.

279
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,434
What's gonna happen to us?

280
00:24:35,503 --> 00:24:39,064
Why, darlings, l,
I just don't know.

281
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,665
It does look hopeless,
doesn't it?

282
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:45,270
I wish we were home with Madame
right now.

283
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:49,476
Oh, poor Madame.

284
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,849
She'll be so worried
when she finds us gone.

285
00:24:57,058 --> 00:24:59,959
Duchess? Kittens?

286
00:25:00,027 --> 00:25:04,726
Oh, my gracious! I had the most
horrible dream about them.

287
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,036
Thank goodness
it was only a dream.

288
00:25:10,104 --> 00:25:12,299
Oh, dear,
what a terrible night.

289
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:18,641
Now, now, my darlings.
Don't be frightened.

290
00:25:18,713 --> 00:25:21,238
The storm will soon pass.

291
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:26,314
Oh! Oh, no!
They're gone!

292
00:25:27,388 --> 00:25:29,686
Duchess! Kittens!

293
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:32,282
Duchess, where are you?

294
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,591
They're gone!
They're gone!

295
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:41,397
Duchess? Kittens? Gone?
Why, that's terrible!

296
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:43,733
But where? Why?

297
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:48,242
Good heavens! Anything could happen
to them on a night like this!

298
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:51,210
Get, get washed down
a storm drain.

299
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,577
Struck by lightning.

300
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:56,173
Oh, they'll need help.

301
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,616
I've just got
to find them.

302
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:04,515
Duchess! Kittens!

303
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,632
Duchess!

304
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:17,262
Kittens!

305
00:26:17,338 --> 00:26:19,636
Kittens!

306
00:26:34,662 --> 00:26:37,927
I like a chee-chee-chee-chee-rony
like they make at home

307
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:41,457
Or a healthy fish
with a big backbone

308
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,561
I'm Abraham Delacey

309
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:46,801
Giuseppe Casey

310
00:26:48,543 --> 00:26:51,671
Thomas O'Malley

311
00:26:51,746 --> 00:26:53,976
O'Malley the alley cat

312
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:57,176
I've got that wanderlust

313
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:59,276
Gotta walk the scene

314
00:27:00,755 --> 00:27:03,815
Gotta kick up
highway dust

315
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:07,088
Feel the grass
that's green

316
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:10,062
Gotta strut
them city streets

317
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:13,328
Showin' off my eclat

318
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:15,231
Yeah

319
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:18,170
Tellin' my friends
of the social elite

320
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:21,265
Or some cute cat
I happen to meet

321
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:23,367
That I'm

322
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:28,511
Abraham Delacey
Giuseppe Casey

323
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,517
Thomas O'Malley

324
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:34,316
O'Malley the alley cat

325
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:37,887
Oh, why, monsieur...

326
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,359
your name seems to cover
all of Europe.

327
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:44,023
Well, of course.
I'm the only cat of my kind.

328
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:48,197
I'm king of the highway

329
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:51,170
Prince of the boulevard

330
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,539
Duke of the avant-garde

331
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,272
The world
is my backyard

332
00:27:58,346 --> 00:28:01,281
So if you're goin'
my way

333
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:04,841
That's the road
you wanna seek

334
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:08,286
Calcutta to Rome
or home sweet home

335
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:12,383
In Paris
magnifique you all

336
00:28:13,828 --> 00:28:16,023
Oh, boy! An alley cat!

337
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:18,156
Shh, shh. Listen.

338
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:21,668
I only got myself

339
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:25,172
And this big old world

340
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,208
But I sip that cup
of life

341
00:28:28,276 --> 00:28:31,905
With my fingers curled

342
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:34,709
I don't worry
what road to take

343
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:38,047
I don't have to think
of that

344
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:42,679
Whatever I take
is the road I make

345
00:28:42,757 --> 00:28:45,726
It's the road of life
Make no mistake

346
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:47,852
For me

347
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:51,397
Yeah
Abraham Delacey

348
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:54,866
Giuseppe Casey
Thomas O'Malley

349
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:59,066
O'Malley the alley cat

350
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:05,404
That's right
And I'm very proud of that

351
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,413
Yeah

352
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:14,580
Bravo! Very good.
You are a great talent.

353
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:18,751
Well, thank you.
And what might your name be?

354
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:20,760
My name is Duchess.

355
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:23,262
Duchess.

356
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:26,664
Beautiful.
Love it.

357
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:30,431
And those eyes.
Ooh.

358
00:29:30,504 --> 00:29:34,440
Why, your eyes are like
sapphires sparkling so bright.

359
00:29:34,508 --> 00:29:38,410
They make the morning
radiant and light.

360
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:42,745
- How romantic.
- Sissy stuff.

361
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:45,752
Oh, c'est tres jolie,
monsieur.

362
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,483
Very poetic.
But it is not quite Shakespeare.

363
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:52,754
'Course not.
That's pure O'Malley, baby.

364
00:29:52,827 --> 00:29:56,092
Right off the cuff. Yeah.
I got a million of'em.

365
00:29:56,163 --> 00:29:58,131
Oh, no more, please.

366
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:00,531
I am really in
a great deal of trouble.

367
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:02,796
Trouble?

368
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,034
Helping beautiful dame...
uh, uh, damsels in distress
is my specialty.

369
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:10,077
Now, what's the hang-up,
your ladyship?

370
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:13,045
Well, it is most important
that I get back to Paris.

371
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:17,574
So, if you would be just
so kind and show me the way.

372
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:21,383
Show you the way?
Perish the thought!

373
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:24,856
We shall fly to Paris
on a magic carpet...

374
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:26,722
side by side...

375
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:30,560
with the stars
as our guide...

376
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:32,565
just we two.

377
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:35,431
Oh, that would
be wonderful.

378
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:39,405
Three? Four?

379
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:41,407
Five?

380
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:44,569
Oh, yes, Monsieur O'Malley.
These are my children.

381
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:46,237
Oh, how sweet.

382
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:48,873
Do you really have
a magic carpet?

383
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:53,079
- And are we really gonna ride on it?
- Now, now, Marie.

384
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:58,421
Mama, do I have sparkling
sapphire eyes that dazzle, too?

385
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:00,653
Ooh, did I say that?

386
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:03,094
Yes, right off your cuff.

387
00:31:03,164 --> 00:31:06,099
And you said we're gonna ride
on a magic carpet.

388
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:09,159
Well, now, uh, what I meant...
You see, l...

389
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:13,070
No poetry to cover this
situation, Monsieur O'Malley?

390
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,768
Well, what I had in mind was
a kind of a sports model, baby.

391
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:20,109
- You know, one of those...
- Uh, perhaps a, a magic carpet
built for two?

392
00:31:20,181 --> 00:31:23,116
I wouldn't take up much room.

393
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:27,485
I understand perfectly,
Monsieur O'Malley.

394
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:30,615
Well, come along, darlings.

395
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:37,964
I'm a tough alley cat, too.

396
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:42,799
Hey, there, you're comin' on.
I'll bet you're a real tiger
in your neighborhood.

397
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,135
Yeah. That's 'cause I practice
all the time.

398
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:48,801
Now, now, Toulouse, Toulouse,
come along, dear.

399
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:51,242
Yes, Mama.

400
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:53,803
See ya around, Tiger!

401
00:31:58,686 --> 00:32:02,281
Ha-ha. Now, that's
quite a family.

402
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:06,850
And come to think of it, O'Malley,
you're not a cat, you're a rat.

403
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:09,725
Right? Right.

404
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:12,061
Hey! Hey, hold up, there!

405
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:14,067
Yes, Monsieur O'Malley?

406
00:32:14,135 --> 00:32:17,866
Now, look, kids,
if I said magic carpet...

407
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:20,065
magic carpet
it's gonna be.

408
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:24,009
And it's gonna stop
for passengers...

409
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:25,670
right...

410
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:29,348
here.

411
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,941
Oh, boy!
We're gonna fly after all.

412
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,819
Ah, another flight into
the fantasy, Monsieur O'Malley?

413
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,726
No, no, no, baby!

414
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:39,624
No, no, no, baby!

415
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:44,926
Now, you just hide over there and you
leave the rest to J. Thomas O'Malley.

416
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:47,763
- Quick, Mama, get in here.
- But, but, children...

417
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:50,201
Hurry up, Mama. Hurry.

418
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,535
One magic carpet comin' up.

419
00:32:58,612 --> 00:33:00,876
That's a magic carpet?

420
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:17,458
Stupid cat!
Brainless lunatic!

421
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:23,770
All right, step lively.
All aboard for Paris.

422
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:26,363
Why, Mr. O'Malley,
you could have lost your life.

423
00:33:27,908 --> 00:33:30,595
So, I've got a few to spare.
Nothin'.

424
00:33:30,728 --> 00:33:32,525
How can we ever thank you?

425
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:35,532
My pleasure entirely.

426
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:39,598
Aloha. Auf Wiedersehen.

427
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:42,936
Bon soir. Sayonara.

428
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:45,373
And all those
good-bye things, baby.

429
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:48,139
Sayonara, Mister... Oh!

430
00:33:48,213 --> 00:33:51,649
- Mama!
- Marie! Marie!

431
00:33:56,888 --> 00:34:00,153
- Oh, Marie, are you all right?
- Yes, Mama.

432
00:34:00,225 --> 00:34:02,159
Haven't we met before?

433
00:34:02,227 --> 00:34:05,663
Oh, and I'm so very glad we did.

434
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,359
Thank you, Mr. O'Malley,
for saving my life.

435
00:34:09,434 --> 00:34:11,868
No trouble at all,
little princess.

436
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:15,667
And when we get to Paris, I'll
show you the time of your life.

437
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,834
Oh, I'm so sorry, but...

438
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,844
Well, we just couldn't.

439
00:34:20,912 --> 00:34:25,178
You see, my mistress will be
so worried about us.

440
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,280
Well, humans don't really worry
too much about their pets.

441
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:33,110
Oh, no.
You just don't understand.

442
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:36,210
She loves us very much.

443
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:40,189
Poor Madame,
in that big mansion...

444
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:43,091
all alone.

445
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,620
In all our days,
in tender ways...

446
00:34:47,698 --> 00:34:50,064
her love for us was shown.

447
00:34:52,003 --> 00:34:54,699
And so, you see...

448
00:34:54,772 --> 00:34:57,570
we can't leave her alone.

449
00:35:00,344 --> 00:35:02,869
She'd always say that...

450
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:06,110
we're the greatest treasure
she could own...

451
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:13,613
because with us
she never felt alone.

452
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:19,591
Oh, Roquefort, I've been
so worried about you.

453
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:21,655
Did you have any luck
at all?

454
00:35:21,732 --> 00:35:24,166
Not a sign of them,
Frou-Frou.

455
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:26,430
And I've searched
all night.

456
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:31,168
I know, and poor Madame
didn't sleep a wink either.

457
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:35,008
Oh, it's a sad day
for all of us.

458
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:46,047
Morning, Frou-Frou,
my pretty steed. Ho-hmm.

459
00:35:46,123 --> 00:35:49,889
Can you keep a secret? Hmm?
Of course you can.

460
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:54,122
I've some news
straight from the horse's mouth.

461
00:35:54,198 --> 00:35:57,565
If you'll pardon the expression,
of course. Ha.

462
00:35:57,635 --> 00:36:00,468
Look, Frou-Frou,
I've made the headlines.

463
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:05,566
" Mysterious Catnapper
Abducts Family of Cats"

464
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:10,444
- Well, aren't you proud of me?
- So, he's the catnapper!

465
00:36:10,514 --> 00:36:13,506
The police said it was
a professional, masterful job.

466
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:15,313
The work of a genius.

467
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:17,445
Not bad, eh,
Frou-Frou old girl?

468
00:36:21,892 --> 00:36:24,759
Oh, they won't find a clue to
implicate me. Not one single clue.

469
00:36:25,696 --> 00:36:29,427
Why, I'll, I'll,
I'll eat my hat if they...

470
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,968
My hat!
My umbrella!

471
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:34,163
Oh, oh gracious!

472
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:37,298
l, I've got to get
those things back tonight.

473
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,674
But... Ooh, you...

474
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:43,976
Why, that sneaky, crooked...

475
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:46,380
no good butler of...

476
00:36:56,694 --> 00:37:00,528
- Anyone for breakfast?
- What breakfast?
- Where is it?

477
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:02,532
Right under
that magic carpet.

478
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,967
But now we have to cook up
a little spell.

479
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:08,528
You know.
You ready?

480
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:11,598
All right. First,
to make the magic begin...

481
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:13,871
you wiggle your nose.

482
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:16,974
And tickle your chin.

483
00:37:17,048 --> 00:37:20,176
Now, you close your eyes...

484
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:23,345
and cross your heart.

485
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:27,380
Then presto!
Breakfast a la carte.

486
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:30,222
- Hurray!
- We did it!
- Look, Mama, look.

487
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:36,960
Why, Mr. O'Malley,
you are amazing!

488
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:40,128
True. True.

489
00:37:49,213 --> 00:37:52,808
Thieves! You robbers!
Mangy tramps!

490
00:37:52,883 --> 00:37:55,511
Take that and that!

491
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:05,351
Oh! Oh, what a horrible,
horrible human.

492
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:07,363
Well, some humans
are like that, Duchess.

493
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:09,490
I've learned to live with it.

494
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,229
I'll show him.
Meow!

495
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:16,239
Hey, cool it, you little tiger.
That guy's dynamite.

496
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:18,241
But he called us tramps.

497
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:21,540
Oh, I'll be so glad
when we get back home.

498
00:38:21,612 --> 00:38:24,911
Well, that's a long way off
so we better get movin'.

499
00:38:30,988 --> 00:38:34,549
Gee whiz!
Look at that bridge!

500
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:38,152
- Come on, let's play train.
- Now, be careful, children.

501
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:40,754
Marie's the caboose.
All aboard!

502
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:45,634
Whoo! Whoo!

503
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:48,870
Whoo! Whoo!

504
00:38:48,939 --> 00:38:51,965
Clickety, clickety,
clickety, clickety.

505
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:54,101
Whoo! Whoo!

506
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,114
- Oh, no!
- All right, now, don't panic.

507
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:00,173
Down underneath here.

508
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:15,965
Mama!

509
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:18,627
Marie! Oh, Marie!

510
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:20,795
Keep your head up, Marie.
Here I come.

511
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:41,357
Thomas! Thomas, up here.

512
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:54,662
Gee, Marie, why'd you have
to fall off the bridge?

513
00:39:57,775 --> 00:40:01,404
Thomas! Oh, Thomas!
Take care!

514
00:40:01,478 --> 00:40:04,811
I'm all right, honey. Don't worry.
I'll see ya downstream.

515
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:18,451
What beautiful countryside,
Abigail.

516
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:21,225
Oh, so much like
our own dear England.

517
00:40:21,298 --> 00:40:23,892
Oh, indeed yes.

518
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:27,734
Amelia, if I walk much further,
I'll get flat feet.

519
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:31,866
Abigail, we were born
with flat feet.

520
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:38,204
I say,
look over there.

521
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:40,477
Oh! Oh, how unusual.

522
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:43,520
Well, fancy that.
A cat learning how to swim.

523
00:40:43,587 --> 00:40:45,987
And he's going about it
all the wrong way.

524
00:40:46,056 --> 00:40:49,423
Quite.
We must correct him.

525
00:40:49,493 --> 00:40:52,018
Sir! Sir!

526
00:40:52,096 --> 00:40:54,326
You are most fortunate
we happened along.

527
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:56,332
Yes, we're here
to help you.

528
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,359
No, no. Back off, girls.
I'm doin' fine.

529
00:41:00,437 --> 00:41:04,430
First, you must gain self-confidence
by striking out on your own.

530
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:07,602
Go away.
I'm tryin' to get to shore.

531
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:11,341
You will never learn to swim properly
with that willow branch in your mouth.

532
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:13,007
Indeed not!

533
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:15,711
Snip, snip.
Here we go.

534
00:41:15,786 --> 00:41:17,777
Don't do that!

535
00:41:19,456 --> 00:41:21,924
You're doing splendidly!

536
00:41:21,992 --> 00:41:25,894
And don't worry about form.
It will come later.

537
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,796
Ooh, he takes to water
like a fish, doesn't he?

538
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:31,858
A very enthusiastic pupil.

539
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:38,160
No. Now, this is no time
for fun and games.

540
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:46,963
Gracious, Amelia.
You don't suppose...

541
00:41:47,035 --> 00:41:49,765
Oh, yes! Yes, I do!
Bottoms up!

542
00:41:54,176 --> 00:41:56,371
- Deeper!
- Deeper!

543
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:01,943
Look, Ma, there he is.

544
00:42:02,017 --> 00:42:05,680
You really did quite well
for a beginner.

545
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:10,248
Oh, Thomas!
Thank goodness you're safe.

546
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:13,726
- Keep practicing!
- And toodlely pip.

547
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:17,523
Can I help you,
Mr. O'Malley, huh?

548
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,397
Help? I've had all the help
I can take.

549
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:24,906
Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so
much for helping Mr. O'Malley.

550
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:28,405
Of course, my dear.
But first, introductions.

551
00:42:28,477 --> 00:42:30,707
Yes. We British like
to keep things proper.

552
00:42:32,748 --> 00:42:36,878
Now, now, I am Amelia Gabble,
and this is my sister...

553
00:42:36,952 --> 00:42:39,443
- Uh, Miss Abigail Gabble.
- We're twin sisters.

554
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:42,319
- You might say we're related.
- Oh, silly thing.

555
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:46,725
How nice.
I never would have guessed.

556
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:50,162
- Look, they got rubber feet.
- Yeah!

557
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:54,167
- We're on holiday.
- For a walking tour of France.

558
00:42:54,236 --> 00:42:57,103
- Uh, swimming some of the way.
- On water, of course.

559
00:42:57,172 --> 00:42:59,333
Of course.

560
00:42:59,408 --> 00:43:02,844
Uh, Thomas, this is Amelia
and Abigail Gabble.

561
00:43:02,911 --> 00:43:06,574
Yeah, honey. Get those two
web-footed lifeguards out of here.

562
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:08,912
Now, now, Thomas.

563
00:43:08,984 --> 00:43:12,044
Okay, okay, baby.
Hiya, chicks.

564
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:14,255
Oh.

565
00:43:18,894 --> 00:43:21,863
We're not chickens.
We're geese.

566
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,923
No! I thought
you were swans.

567
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:29,095
Ooh! Ooh! Flatterer!

568
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:33,437
Your husband is very charming
and very handsome.

569
00:43:33,509 --> 00:43:35,238
Well, ha, uh...

570
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,642
You see, l-I'm not exactly
her husband.

571
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:41,649
Exactly? You either are
or you're not.

572
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:44,880
All right.
I'm not.

573
00:43:44,953 --> 00:43:47,854
- Oh?
- Oh? Hmm.

574
00:43:47,923 --> 00:43:50,391
- He's scandalous.
- He's nothing but a cad.

575
00:43:50,459 --> 00:43:53,690
- Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.
- A roue.

576
00:43:53,762 --> 00:43:56,993
- Mmm, his eyes are too close together.
- They're shifty, too.

577
00:43:57,065 --> 00:44:01,331
- And look at his crooked smile.
- His chin is very weak, too.

578
00:44:01,403 --> 00:44:05,737
Obviously a philanderer who trifles
with unsuspecting women's hearts.

579
00:44:05,807 --> 00:44:08,241
How romantic.

580
00:44:10,312 --> 00:44:12,872
Please.
Please let me explain.

581
00:44:12,948 --> 00:44:16,884
Thomas is a dear friend of ours.
He's just helping us to get to...

582
00:44:16,952 --> 00:44:20,752
Come on, Duchess, come on.
Let's get out of here.

583
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:25,259
Well, girls, see ya around.
We're on our way to Paris.

584
00:44:25,327 --> 00:44:28,763
Ooh, how nice.
We're going to Paris ourselves.

585
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,695
Why don't you join us?

586
00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:33,030
I think that's
a splendid idea.

587
00:44:33,101 --> 00:44:35,035
Oh, no.

588
00:44:35,103 --> 00:44:38,561
Now, uh,
you stand here, dear.

589
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,041
And, uh, let's see,
uh, you take this position.

590
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,908
- Uh, Duchess, you will do nicely here.
- Yes, very good.

591
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,211
And, and you, dear,
you take this place.

592
00:44:48,283 --> 00:44:50,410
Oh, now that leaves
Mr. O'Malley.

593
00:44:50,485 --> 00:44:52,715
Oh, we can't leave him,
can we?

594
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:58,989
Mr. O'Malley, I think
you should be the rear end.

595
00:44:59,061 --> 00:45:02,622
Ready, everyone?
Now, think goose.

596
00:45:02,698 --> 00:45:05,724
Forward march.

597
00:45:11,173 --> 00:45:14,973
Mama, do we have to waddle
like they do?

598
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:17,307
Yes, dear.
Think goose.

599
00:45:19,615 --> 00:45:23,608
When we get to Paris,
you must meet Uncle Waldo.

600
00:45:23,685 --> 00:45:26,341
- Waldo?
- Yes, he's our uncle.

601
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,409
We are to meet Uncle Waldo
at Le Petit Cafe.

602
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:33,743
Le Petit Cafe? Oh, that's
that famous restaurant.

603
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,874
Ah! C'est magnifique.

604
00:45:43,224 --> 00:45:46,091
Oh, he bit my finger!

605
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:48,356
Get out! Go! Go!
Get out! Scram!

606
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,091
Good riddance!

607
00:46:03,278 --> 00:46:05,940
Why, why, it's Uncle Waldo!

608
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:08,073
Uncle Waldo!

609
00:46:08,149 --> 00:46:11,209
Abigail! Amelia!

610
00:46:11,286 --> 00:46:13,413
My two favorite "nooses."

611
00:46:13,488 --> 00:46:18,084
Uncle Waldo. Tsk, tsk. l, I do
believe you've been drinking.

612
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,118
Oh, dear! What happened
to your lovely tail feathers?

613
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:25,826
Girls, it's outrageous.

614
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,495
Why, you won't believe
what they tried to do...

615
00:46:29,571 --> 00:46:33,098
to your poor old
Uncle Waldo.

616
00:46:33,174 --> 00:46:35,768
Look! Look at this!

617
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:40,110
" Prime Country Goose
A la Provencale.

618
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:42,445
Stuffed with chestnuts"?

619
00:46:42,517 --> 00:46:47,580
"And basted
in white wine."

620
00:46:47,656 --> 00:46:51,922
Basted? He's been
marinated in it.

621
00:46:51,993 --> 00:46:53,620
Dreadful!

622
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,529
Being British,
I would have preferred sherry.

623
00:46:59,934 --> 00:47:02,266
Sherry! Sherry.

624
00:47:02,337 --> 00:47:04,430
Oh-oh, oh, oh!

625
00:47:04,506 --> 00:47:07,270
Oh, Uncle Waldo,
you're just too much.

626
00:47:07,342 --> 00:47:09,435
You mean,
he's had too much.

627
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:12,874
- Uh, Abigail, Abigail.
- Yes, yes.

628
00:47:12,947 --> 00:47:15,609
We best get
Uncle Waldo to bed.

629
00:47:15,684 --> 00:47:17,618
Ah, I say there now.

630
00:47:17,686 --> 00:47:21,122
What's all the whis-whispering
about, huh?

631
00:47:21,189 --> 00:47:23,157
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

632
00:47:23,224 --> 00:47:25,658
Now, now, now, now, girls.
Girls!

633
00:47:25,727 --> 00:47:28,321
Don't shush
your old Uncle Waldo.

634
00:47:28,396 --> 00:47:32,093
Why, you'll, you'll wake up
the whole neighborhood.

635
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:33,759
- Shh.
- Whoopee!

636
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:36,133
- Shh.
- No.
- Neighborhood.

637
00:47:36,204 --> 00:47:39,731
- Oh, come along, Uncle Waldo.
- Oh, yes, I think we'd better be going.

638
00:47:39,808 --> 00:47:42,299
Oh, right-o, girls.

639
00:47:42,377 --> 00:47:46,313
Birds of a feather must
"hic" together.

640
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:49,509
That's stick together.

641
00:47:49,584 --> 00:47:51,415
I'll say!

642
00:47:53,655 --> 00:47:55,885
- Girls! Girls!
- Shoo, shoo, shoo.

643
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:06,289
You know somethin'?
I like Uncle Waldo.

644
00:48:07,268 --> 00:48:10,567
Especially when
he's marinated.

645
00:48:13,937 --> 00:48:15,666
Frou-Frou,
here comes Edgar.

646
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:17,764
Hurry, Roquefort,
hop aboard the motorcycle.

647
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:20,867
And for goodness sakes,
do be careful!

648
00:48:26,216 --> 00:48:29,811
Frou-Frou, tonight operation
catnapper will be completed.

649
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:32,219
Wish me luck.
Fisherman's luck.

650
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:42,555
Bye, Frou-Frou.
Ooh!

651
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:04,909
Lafayette!
Lafayette, listen.

652
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:10,818
Oh, shucks, Napoleon. That ain't
nothing' but a little ol' cricket bug.

653
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:13,652
It's squeaky shoes approachin'.

654
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:16,318
Oh, cricket bugs
don't wear shoes.

655
00:50:16,393 --> 00:50:18,657
Hush your mouth!

656
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:22,165
Let's see.
They're oxford shoes...

657
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:25,167
size nine and a half.

658
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:28,204
Hole in the left sole,
it sounds like.

659
00:50:28,272 --> 00:50:32,106
- What color are they?
- Why, they're black...
Ah, now how would I know that?

660
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:37,847
Hey, now the squeakin'
has stopped.

661
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:41,009
I still say it was
a little ol' cricket bug.

662
00:50:41,084 --> 00:50:42,949
I'm the leader.

663
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,956
I'll decide what it was.

664
00:50:47,024 --> 00:50:48,958
It was a little
ol' cricket bug.

665
00:50:49,026 --> 00:50:52,860
I'll see you in the mornin',
Napoleon.

666
00:51:20,924 --> 00:51:23,688
That's my hat!
I'm the leader!

667
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,163
Well, shoot fire! Don't get sore
at me. I ain't done nothin'.

668
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:16,412
Ooh, oh, hey.

669
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,448
Ooh!

670
00:52:28,725 --> 00:52:31,057
Mmm, that feels good,
Lafayette.

671
00:52:31,128 --> 00:52:33,562
That's all right.

672
00:52:40,304 --> 00:52:42,295
A little lower
and faster there.

673
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:47,036
I'm scratchin' as fast
as I can.

674
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:50,511
Right there! That's good!
Oh, ooh, ooh!

675
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,514
Ooh!

676
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:24,113
Mmm, it's so warm and...

677
00:53:24,181 --> 00:53:27,673
mmm, cozy.

678
00:53:44,334 --> 00:53:48,794
Wh-Wh-What's goin' on? Lafayette,
what in tar nation are you tryin' to do?

679
00:53:48,872 --> 00:53:51,636
Aw, I get blamed
for everything.

680
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:55,075
Wait a minute!
Where's my hat? Where...

681
00:53:55,145 --> 00:53:57,909
And somebody stole
my bumbershoot.

682
00:53:57,981 --> 00:54:00,541
Well, where's
my beddie-bye basket?

683
00:54:00,617 --> 00:54:05,281
And whoever it is,
is gonna get it and get it good.

684
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:07,653
This time,
I get the tender part.

685
00:54:07,724 --> 00:54:10,955
Hush your mouth!
Now, come on.

686
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:25,998
Hey, N-Napoleon,
oh, it's them shoes again!

687
00:54:26,076 --> 00:54:29,011
Yeah, yeah, I hear' em.

688
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:32,515
Napoleon, I'm plumb
goose-pimply scared.

689
00:54:32,582 --> 00:54:36,416
Now, this is no time
to turn chicken.

690
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:48,598
I got a feelin' this case
is gonna bust wide open.

691
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,363
Ah, d-d-d-did, did, did,
did you see him?

692
00:54:55,439 --> 00:54:58,374
No, no. He sneaked up
behind me and tailgated me.

693
00:54:58,442 --> 00:55:02,208
- Well, he didn't hurt me.
He hit me on the head.
- Shh, shh.

694
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:04,304
Listen.

695
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:07,714
Sounds like a one-wheeled,
oh...

696
00:55:07,784 --> 00:55:11,811
- A one-wheeled what?
- You're not gonna believe this...

697
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:14,857
but it's a one-wheeled
haystack.

698
00:55:14,925 --> 00:55:17,393
Hey! There it goes!
Come on, after it!

699
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:24,730
- I got him, I got him, I got him!
- Ouch! That's me!

700
00:55:24,801 --> 00:55:26,166
Oh, wow.

701
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:29,069
Oh, get him, get him,
get him, get him!

702
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:40,014
Well, c'est la guerre, Napoleon.
I guess you can't win 'em all.

703
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:43,951
Ow! Ohh, ohh, ohh!
Criminently!

704
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:07,004
Thomas, Madame will be so worried.
Are you sure we can't get home tonight?

705
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,514
Mama, I'm tired.

706
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,915
Me, too!
And my feet hurt.

707
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:16,922
Look, baby, it's late,
and the kids are bushed.

708
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:19,515
I'll bet we walked
a hundred miles!

709
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:22,357
I'll bet it's more
than a thousand!

710
00:56:22,429 --> 00:56:24,727
Now, now, darlings,
cheer up.

711
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,029
Mr. O'Malley knows a place
where we can stay tonight.

712
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:31,628
How much farther is it,
Mr. O'Malley?

713
00:56:31,705 --> 00:56:37,234
Keep your whiskers up, tiger.
It's just beyond that next chimney pot.

714
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:41,371
Well, there it is.
My own penthouse pad.

715
00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:45,908
It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's
peaceful and quiet. And you'll...

716
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:50,321
Oh! Oh, no!

717
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,621
Sounds like Scat Cat
and his gang have dropped by.

718
00:56:53,693 --> 00:56:55,888
Oh, friends of yours?

719
00:56:55,962 --> 00:57:00,194
Uh-huh, yeah. They're old buddies.
And they're, they're real swingers.

720
00:57:00,267 --> 00:57:02,861
Swingers?
What is a swinger?

721
00:57:02,936 --> 00:57:05,803
You know, uh, not exactly
your type, Duchess.

722
00:57:05,872 --> 00:57:08,966
And, uh, maybe we'd better find
another place. Huh?

723
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:13,843
Oh, no, no, no. I would like to see
your pad, and meet your Scat Cat.

724
00:57:13,913 --> 00:57:16,643
Well, okay.

725
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:22,951
Hey, Scat Cat, blow some
of that sweet stuff my way.

726
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:31,396
Well, lookie here! Big Man O'Malley
is back in his alley.

727
00:57:31,464 --> 00:57:34,729
Swing on down here, daddy!

728
00:57:34,801 --> 00:57:38,567
Lay some skin on me, Scat Cat.
Yeah!

729
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,298
Welcome home, O'Malley.

730
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:46,903
Duchess, this is
the greatest cat of'em all.

731
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,143
Oh, I'm delighted to meet you,
Monsieur Scats Cat.

732
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,980
Likewise, Duchess.

733
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,021
You're too much.

734
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:58,285
Oh, ho-ho,
you are charming.

735
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:00,724
And your music is so...

736
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:04,423
so different,
ah, so exciting.

737
00:58:04,497 --> 00:58:07,830
It isn't Beethoven, Mama,
but it sure bounces.

738
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:13,171
Say! This kitten cat
knows where it's at.

739
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:18,311
- Knows where what's at?
- Well, little lady,
let me elucidate here.

740
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:18,777
- Knows where what's at?
- Well, little lady,
let me elucidate here.

741
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,214
Everybody wants to be a cat

742
00:58:22,282 --> 00:58:26,116
Because a cat's the only cat
who knows where it's at

743
00:58:26,186 --> 00:58:31,146
Tell me, everybody's pickin'up
on that feline beat

744
00:58:31,224 --> 00:58:34,785
- 'Cause everything else is obsolete
- Strictly high-button shoes

745
00:58:34,861 --> 00:58:38,319
A square with a horn
makes you wish you weren't born

746
00:58:38,398 --> 00:58:42,164
Every time he plays

747
00:58:42,235 --> 00:58:46,365
But with a square in the act
you can set music back

748
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,373
To the caveman days

749
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:54,346
I've heard some corny birds
who tried to sing

750
00:58:54,414 --> 00:58:58,680
But still a cat's the only cat
who knows how to swing

751
00:58:58,752 --> 00:59:03,246
Who wants to dig a longhaired
gig and stuff like that

752
00:59:03,323 --> 00:59:06,622
When everybody
wants to be a cat

753
00:59:06,693 --> 00:59:10,322
A square with a horn
makes you wish you weren't born

754
00:59:10,397 --> 00:59:12,160
Every time he plays

755
00:59:12,232 --> 00:59:14,427
Oh, a rinky, tinky, dinky

756
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:18,062
With a square in the act
you can set music back

757
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,163
To the caveman days

758
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,435
Oh, a rinky, tinky, tinky

759
00:59:22,509 --> 00:59:25,774
Yes, everybody
wants to be a cat

760
00:59:25,845 --> 00:59:30,373
Because a cat's the only cat
who knows where it's at

761
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:35,217
When playing jazz
you always has a welcome mat

762
00:59:35,288 --> 00:59:38,519
'Cause everybody digs
a swingin' cat

763
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:41,856
Oh, boy, fellas,
let's rock the joint!

764
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,062
Groove it, cats.

765
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:09,754
Shanghai, Hong Kong
egg fu yung

766
01:00:09,823 --> 01:00:12,087
Fortune cookie
always wrong

767
01:00:12,158 --> 01:00:13,955
That's a hot one!

768
01:00:15,295 --> 01:00:17,286
How about you and me,
Duchess?

769
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,526
Yes, let's swing it,
Thomas.

770
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,833
Groovy, Mama, groovy!

771
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,134
Blow it, small fry, blow it.

772
01:00:31,845 --> 01:00:33,836
Boy, he blew it!

773
01:00:33,913 --> 01:00:35,938
But he was-a close!

774
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,865
- Mmm!
- Beautiful!

775
01:00:56,936 --> 01:01:00,804
If you want to turn me on

776
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:04,366
Play your horn
Don't spare the tone

777
01:01:04,444 --> 01:01:07,004
And blow a little soul

778
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,447
Into the tune

779
01:01:15,221 --> 01:01:19,851
Let's take it to
another key

780
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:23,020
Modulate
and wait for me

781
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:27,396
I'll take a few ad-libs
and pretty soon

782
01:01:30,637 --> 01:01:34,573
The other cats
will all commence

783
01:01:34,641 --> 01:01:38,236
Congregatin'
on the fence

784
01:01:38,311 --> 01:01:41,644
Beneath the alley's
only light

785
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:44,114
Where every note is

786
01:01:44,183 --> 01:01:50,088
Out of sight

787
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:58,324
Everybody, everybody

788
01:01:58,398 --> 01:02:01,196
Everybody wants to be a cat

789
01:02:01,267 --> 01:02:05,397
Hallelujah
Everybody, everybody

790
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,463
Everybody wants to be a cat

791
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:13,001
I'm tellin' you
Everybody, everybody

792
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:15,912
Everybody wants to be a cat

793
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:20,351
- Yeah
- Everybody, everybody

794
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:23,412
Everybody wants to be a cat

795
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:27,721
- Mmm
- Everybody, everybody

796
01:02:27,794 --> 01:02:30,729
Everybody wants to be a cat

797
01:02:30,797 --> 01:02:34,995
- Hallelujah
- Everybody, everybody

798
01:02:35,068 --> 01:02:38,196
Everybody wants to be a cat

799
01:03:01,853 --> 01:03:06,483
Everybody wants
to be a cat

800
01:03:06,558 --> 01:03:11,552
Because a cat's
the only cat

801
01:03:11,629 --> 01:03:15,929
Who knows where
it's at

802
01:03:16,901 --> 01:03:20,496
Oh, yeah

803
01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:23,735
Happy dreams, my loves.

804
01:03:29,113 --> 01:03:33,311
I'll bet they're on
that magic carpet right now.

805
01:03:33,384 --> 01:03:35,648
They could hardly keep
their eyes open.

806
01:03:37,121 --> 01:03:39,988
Oh! Such an exciting day.

807
01:03:40,058 --> 01:03:43,425
It sure was.
And what a finale!

808
01:03:45,997 --> 01:03:49,660
Thomas, your friends
are really delightful.

809
01:03:49,734 --> 01:03:51,668
I just love them.

810
01:03:51,736 --> 01:03:54,136
Well, they're kind a rough,
you know, around the edges.

811
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:58,301
But if you're ever in a jam,
wham, they're right there.

812
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,971
And, wham,
when we needed you...

813
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:03,741
you were right there.

814
01:04:03,815 --> 01:04:07,012
Hmm, that was just
a lucky break for me, baby.

815
01:04:07,085 --> 01:04:10,919
Oh, and thank you so much
for offering us your home.

816
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:14,755
Oh, I mean your pad.

817
01:04:14,826 --> 01:04:18,023
- It's very nice.
- Well now, wait a minute.

818
01:04:18,096 --> 01:04:21,031
You know, this is
the low-rent district, remember?

819
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:23,158
No, no, no, I like it!

820
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:27,671
Well, uh, well, all it needs
is a, is a little tidying up.

821
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:32,699
And, well, maybe a,
a little feminine touch.

822
01:04:32,777 --> 01:04:35,041
Well, if you're applying
for the job, well...

823
01:04:35,113 --> 01:04:38,742
Goody! Mother's going
to work for Mr. O'Malley.

824
01:04:39,951 --> 01:04:44,854
Boy! Your eyes
are like sapphires.

825
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:50,755
Gee! Ha. That's pretty corny,
though, huh?

826
01:04:50,828 --> 01:04:54,093
Oh, no! Not at all.

827
01:04:54,165 --> 01:04:57,100
Any woman would like it.

828
01:04:57,168 --> 01:05:00,729
l, I mean,
even little Marie.

829
01:05:02,307 --> 01:05:07,609
Yeah. All those little kittens,
Duchess, I love 'em.

830
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:10,011
And they are
very fond of you.

831
01:05:10,081 --> 01:05:12,447
- Yeah!
- Well, you know,
- Shh.
- they need a...

832
01:05:12,517 --> 01:05:15,680
Well, you know, a sort...

833
01:05:15,753 --> 01:05:19,780
Well, a sort of a...
Well, a father around.

834
01:05:19,857 --> 01:05:24,294
Oh, Thomas, Thomas,
that would be wonderful!

835
01:05:24,362 --> 01:05:28,958
Oh, darling,
if, if only I could.

836
01:05:29,033 --> 01:05:32,867
- But why can't ya?
- Because of Madame.

837
01:05:32,937 --> 01:05:35,405
l, I could never leave her.

838
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:39,273
But, but Madame's...

839
01:05:39,344 --> 01:05:42,074
well, she's just
another human.

840
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,114
You're just her house pets.

841
01:05:44,182 --> 01:05:48,619
Oh, no, no! We mean
far more to her than that!

842
01:05:50,521 --> 01:05:53,888
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear...

843
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:56,426
but we just have
to go home tomorrow.

844
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,689
Yeah.

845
01:05:58,763 --> 01:06:02,995
Well, I guess you know best.

846
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:06,036
But I'm gonna miss you,
baby.

847
01:06:06,104 --> 01:06:09,437
And those kids!

848
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,475
Gee, I'm gonna
miss them, too.

849
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:15,137
- Well, we almost had a father.
- Yeah.

850
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:19,510
Let's go back to bed.

851
01:06:23,087 --> 01:06:25,453
Good night, Duchess.

852
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,219
Good night, Thomas.

853
01:06:51,082 --> 01:06:56,076
Hey! Meow!

854
01:06:56,154 --> 01:06:58,952
What a classy neighborhood!

855
01:06:59,023 --> 01:07:03,016
- Dig these fancy wigwams.
- Wigwams?

856
01:07:03,094 --> 01:07:05,289
Are you sure we're
on the right street?

857
01:07:05,363 --> 01:07:08,264
Yes. Yes. Let's hurry.
We're almost home.

858
01:07:08,332 --> 01:07:12,598
Duchess! Kittens!
Hallelujah, they're back!

859
01:07:17,842 --> 01:07:21,938
Oh, no! Edgar!
I've got to do something quick!

860
01:07:24,115 --> 01:07:27,278
Edgar, old chap, get used
to the finer things of life.

861
01:07:27,351 --> 01:07:32,516
Ooh, someday they're all going
to be yours, you sly old fox.

862
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:37,926
Oh!
Oh, he got me!

863
01:07:37,995 --> 01:07:41,897
- Hurray, we're home!
- Wait for me, wait for me!

864
01:07:41,966 --> 01:07:45,129
Me first! Me first!

865
01:07:46,737 --> 01:07:48,204
It's locked.

866
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:51,400
Come on!
Let's all start meowing.

867
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:58,271
It can't be them!
The kittens!

868
01:08:05,256 --> 01:08:07,520
Don't come in!

869
01:08:09,727 --> 01:08:11,922
Go away! Away!

870
01:08:11,996 --> 01:08:14,556
Look! There's Roquefort.

871
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:18,068
- Hi, Roquefort.
- He's sure glad to see us.

872
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,004
I don't know what to say.

873
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:25,008
I only wish that l...

874
01:08:25,076 --> 01:08:27,340
Maybe just a...

875
01:08:27,411 --> 01:08:30,847
short, sweet good-bye
would be easiest.

876
01:08:30,915 --> 01:08:35,318
I'll never forget you,
Thomas O'Malley.

877
01:08:36,554 --> 01:08:39,921
- Bye.
- So long, baby.

878
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:43,586
Don't come in!
Look out for Edgar!

879
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,437
Duchess,
wherever have you been?

880
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:56,302
Look out for the...

881
01:08:58,042 --> 01:08:59,509
sack.

882
01:08:59,577 --> 01:09:02,740
Well...

883
01:09:02,813 --> 01:09:05,551
I guess they won't
need me anymore.

884
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:07,982
You came back!

885
01:09:08,053 --> 01:09:10,920
Oh, it, it just isn't fair.

886
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:14,255
Edgar! Edgar, come quickly!

887
01:09:14,326 --> 01:09:16,726
Coming, Madame, coming!

888
01:09:16,796 --> 01:09:20,061
I'll take care of you later.

889
01:09:20,132 --> 01:09:23,727
Oh, Edgar, they're back!
I heard them!

890
01:09:23,803 --> 01:09:26,397
Hurry, hurry, let them in.

891
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:30,504
Duchess? Kittens?

892
01:09:30,576 --> 01:09:35,070
Come here, my darlings.
Where are you? Come on.

893
01:09:35,147 --> 01:09:38,310
Uh, allow me, Madame.

894
01:09:38,384 --> 01:09:40,852
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

895
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,411
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

896
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:45,423
His name is "O"' what?

897
01:09:45,491 --> 01:09:47,459
His name is O'Malley.
O'Malley.

898
01:09:47,526 --> 01:09:49,892
Abraham Delacey
Guiseppe Casey.

899
01:09:49,962 --> 01:09:52,362
Oh, never, never mind.
Just run, move, go get him!

900
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:54,865
Yes, yes, I'm on my way!

901
01:09:54,934 --> 01:09:57,698
I told you it was Edgar.

902
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:00,170
Aw, shut up, Toulouse.

903
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,833
Oh, it's no use, Edgar.

904
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:07,538
I'm afraid it was just
the imagination of an old lady.

905
01:10:07,613 --> 01:10:11,379
But I was so sure
that I heard them.

906
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:14,248
I'm so sorry, Madame.

907
01:10:22,361 --> 01:10:25,421
Mr. O'Malley!

908
01:10:28,234 --> 01:10:31,328
Hey, stop!

909
01:10:31,403 --> 01:10:35,339
Duchess, kittens in trouble.
Butler did it.

910
01:10:35,407 --> 01:10:37,204
Duchess and kittens
in trouble?

911
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:40,609
Look, you go get Scat Cat
and his gang of alley cats.

912
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:44,308
A-Alley cats?
But I'm a mouse!

913
01:10:44,383 --> 01:10:47,318
- Look, I'm gonna need help.
- You mean you want me...

914
01:10:47,386 --> 01:10:51,254
Move! Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you,
and you won't have a bit of trouble.

915
01:10:58,497 --> 01:11:00,624
" No trouble," he said.

916
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:04,135
Well, that's easy for, ah,
for what's-his-name to say.

917
01:11:04,203 --> 01:11:07,263
He's got nine lives.
I've only got one.

918
01:11:11,744 --> 01:11:15,009
What's a little swinger like you
doin' on our side of town?

919
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:19,483
Oh, please, ah, I was sent here
for help by a cat.

920
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,179
Why, this is outrageous!
This is crazy!

921
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:26,315
Kinky!

922
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:31,853
Oh, but, but honest!
He told me just to mention his name.

923
01:11:31,931 --> 01:11:35,025
So, start mentioning name,
rodent!

924
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,091
Now... Oh, now, wait a minute,
fellows.

925
01:11:37,169 --> 01:11:41,128
Lo... Don... Look, don't, don't, don't,
don't rush me. His name is O'Toole.

926
01:11:41,206 --> 01:11:44,141
I don't dig him.
Strike one.

927
01:11:44,209 --> 01:11:47,440
Oh, ooh, O'Brien!

928
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:50,482
- Strike two.
- Oh, boy.

929
01:11:50,549 --> 01:11:55,145
- You believe me, don't you?
- Keep talkin', mousey.

930
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:59,486
H-How about O'Grady?

931
01:11:59,558 --> 01:12:01,150
Huh?

932
01:12:01,226 --> 01:12:05,356
Mousey, you just struck out.
Any last words?

933
01:12:05,431 --> 01:12:09,231
Oh, no, oh! Why did I listen
to that O'Malley cat?

934
01:12:09,301 --> 01:12:12,464
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?

935
01:12:12,538 --> 01:12:15,234
Hold it, cats.
This little guy is on the level.

936
01:12:15,307 --> 01:12:17,969
You're darn tootin'
I'm on the level!

937
01:12:18,043 --> 01:12:21,035
Oh, we didn't mean-a to,
to rough-a you, squeaky.

938
01:12:21,113 --> 01:12:23,843
Don't worry about me.
O'Malley needs help.

939
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:26,077
Duchess and the kittens
are in trouble.

940
01:12:26,151 --> 01:12:28,142
Come on, cats.
We gotta split.

941
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,656
Hey, wait for me!
You don't know the way!

942
01:12:53,512 --> 01:12:58,814
Now, my little pesky pets,
you're going to travel first-class...

943
01:12:58,884 --> 01:13:01,648
in your own
private compartment...

944
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,883
all the way to Timbuktu.

945
01:13:04,957 --> 01:13:08,825
And this time,
you'll never come back.

946
01:13:08,894 --> 01:13:12,022
Oh, oh, oh,
we-we-we've got to hurry.

947
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:14,565
The baggage truck will be here
any moment now.

948
01:13:19,972 --> 01:13:22,236
Ooh!

949
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:14,257
Over there!
They're in the trunk!

950
01:14:26,305 --> 01:14:28,273
Quiet!

951
01:14:35,247 --> 01:14:38,375
Everybody out of here fast.

952
01:14:39,918 --> 01:14:43,945
You're going to Timbuktu...

953
01:14:44,022 --> 01:14:47,458
if it's the last thing I do.

954
01:15:13,585 --> 01:15:16,418
Well, Mac, this must be
the trunk, eh?

955
01:15:16,488 --> 01:15:20,549
Yup! And she goes
all the way to Timbuktu.

956
01:15:20,626 --> 01:15:23,151
Heave ho!

957
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:49,822
Now, my pets,
a little closer together.

958
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,925
Good! Good!

959
01:15:52,002 --> 01:15:54,732
Look, Georges,
what do you think?

960
01:15:54,805 --> 01:15:57,865
Very good, very good!

961
01:15:57,941 --> 01:15:59,932
But I think we should
get on with the will.

962
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:03,969
Yes, yes, of course.
But you know what to do.

963
01:16:04,048 --> 01:16:07,245
Very well.
Scratch one butler.

964
01:16:07,318 --> 01:16:11,846
You know, Georges, if Edgar
had only known about the will...

965
01:16:11,922 --> 01:16:15,380
I'm sure he never
would have left.

966
01:16:15,459 --> 01:16:17,950
Duchess, it's wonderful
to have you all back.

967
01:16:18,028 --> 01:16:22,192
And I think this young man
is very handsome.

968
01:16:22,266 --> 01:16:24,530
Shall we keep him
in the family?

969
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:28,497
Of course we will.

970
01:16:28,572 --> 01:16:31,200
We need a man
around the house.

971
01:16:31,275 --> 01:16:36,269
An-and, Georges, we must be sure to
provide for their future little ones.

972
01:16:37,448 --> 01:16:40,576
Of course!
The more the merrier.

973
01:16:42,419 --> 01:16:46,788
Now, don't move.
Smile.

974
01:16:46,857 --> 01:16:48,984
Say cheese!

975
01:16:49,059 --> 01:16:51,823
Did somebody say "cheese"?

976
01:16:51,895 --> 01:16:53,624
Thank you.

977
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:58,498
Now, run along downstairs.
There's a surprise for you.

978
01:17:04,308 --> 01:17:06,572
Adelaide,
what's that music?

979
01:17:06,643 --> 01:17:10,340
Sounds like a gang
of swinging hep cats.

980
01:17:10,414 --> 01:17:12,575
That's exactly what
they are, Georges.

981
01:17:12,649 --> 01:17:15,743
They're the start
of my new foundation.

982
01:17:15,819 --> 01:17:17,946
What foundation?

983
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:21,752
My home for all the alley cats
of Paris.

984
01:17:25,763 --> 01:17:29,221
Everybody, everybody

985
01:17:29,299 --> 01:17:32,268
Everybody wants to be a cat

986
01:17:33,103 --> 01:17:36,231
Everybody, everybody

987
01:17:36,306 --> 01:17:40,265
Everybody wants to be a cat

988
01:17:40,344 --> 01:17:43,905
Everybody, everybody

989
01:17:43,981 --> 01:17:47,417
Everybody wants to be a cat

990
01:17:47,484 --> 01:17:51,181
Everybody, whoopee

991
01:17:51,255 --> 01:17:54,782
Everybody wants to be a cat

992
01:17:54,858 --> 01:17:58,589
Everybody, everybody

993
01:17:58,662 --> 01:18:02,029
Everybody wants to be

994
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:07,332
A cat

995
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:13,202
Hey, Napoleon,
that sounds like the end.

996
01:18:13,336 --> 01:18:16,305
Wait a minute.
I'm the leader.

997
01:18:16,372 --> 01:18:18,704
I'll say when it's the end.

998
01:18:19,942 --> 01:18:21,967
It's the end.

999
01:18:32,622 --> 01:18:36,389
Oh, yeah
