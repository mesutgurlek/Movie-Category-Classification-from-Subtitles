00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,244
<i>Welcome back to</i> Celebrity Dance Factor.

2
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,116
I'm Hutch Davidson
and we are live from Hollywood

3
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,748
just moments away from crowning
our season champion.

4
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,355
Now, we've just seen the last dances
from our first two finalists.

5
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,654
Reality television star, Whitney Port.

6
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,468
And Miami Heat basketball star,
Dwyane Wade.

7
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,941
Which brings us to our last, but certainly
not least, finalist of the night.

8
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,777
Everyone's favorite tough love trainer from
the weight-loss show, <i>Lose it and Weep.</i>

9
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,316
Oh, my God, I think I'm gonna throw up.

10
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,912
- We got this. We got this, okay?
- You're right. We can do this.

11
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,184
- Just one more dance. One more dance.
- We know how to do this.

12
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,284
Jules Baxter
and her partner, Evan Webber!

13
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,478
Alex, quick, come see this!

14
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,941
What are you watching?

15
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,415
<i>Celebrity Dance Factor.</i>

16
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,213
- No.
- It's the finals!

17
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,947
Even I need a cold shower after that one.

18
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,479
Let's turn to our esteemed panel ofjudges.
Tyce? Let's hear your score.

19
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,223
Five stars!

20
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,888
Okay. Cheryl Cole?

21
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,599
You know what, if I had six stars,
I'd give you the six.

22
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,795
But I've only got five,
so you can have those.

23
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,968
- Jules is taking it.
- No. I think D-Wade has it.

24
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,338
- What?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

25
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,242
And Taboo of The Black Eyed Peas,
let's have your thoughts.

26
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,803
It wasrt for me, so I gave you a three.

27
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,545
- Dude. She's totally doing him.
- No way.

28
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,676
Don't question the sage insights

31

32
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,753
Thank you.

And the winner of <i>Celebrity Dance Factor,</i>
Season 15 is...

34
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,508
I can't...

35
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,915
Jules Baxter and Evan Webber!

36
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,817
<i>Jules? Are you okay?</i>

37
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:12,942
<i>I'm sorry. So sorry.</i>

38
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,981
Let's hope she's not pregnant, folks.

39
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,650
Fireworks!

40
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,598
Book signing. <i>Milk It!</i> the book!

41
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,905
Pictures of breasts inside!

42

Welcome, everyone, to The Breast Choice.

43
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,681
I'm Wendy Cooper, wearing two hats today
as store owner

44
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,878
and author of my very first
childrers book <i>Milk It!</i>

45
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,547
Yay!

46
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,018
So let's get started.

47
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,526
Hi.

48
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,990
"Goats do it.

49
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,464
"Cows do it.

50
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,464
"Kitties do it.

51
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,701
"Even dolphins in the sea do it.

52
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,706
"When your mommy uses her breasts
to feed a baby

53
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,506
"she is feeding her baby the..."

54
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,843
Tits!

55
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,110
Gary!

56
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,816
Okay, okay. Sorry. I got it. I got it.

57
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,618
- Hey, kid!
- All right!

58
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,420
- They're called breasts.
- Thank you all for coming.

59
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:30,154
It was just lovely. And hug your mommies
for breast-feeding you.

60
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,823
- Thank you.
- Bye. Thank you. See you.

61
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,493
- Hey! Great job, hon!
- Did you get that kid?

62
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,796
No. He was too fast.

63
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,870
But I said some choice words.
They were very choice.

64
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,702
Punk. Next time, get him.

65
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,039
Okay. I will. But what's important right now?

66
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,740
That I just had my first reading.

67
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,806
Yeah! Yeah, you did! You did great.

68
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,215
- I gotta get back, okay?
- What? No! Gar!

69
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,777
- Lil Wayne is waiting.
- Can't some other dentist do it?

70
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,948
Squeaks, it's my first grill!

71
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,957
- Right? Yeah.
- All right.

72
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,755
- It's a big deal.
- I was gonna take you to lunch, but okay.

73
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,388
Next time, all right?
Congratulations! Great job!

74
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,394
- Gar!
- Yeah?

75
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,731
Two minutes.

76
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,136
- I gotta go.
- Honey!

77
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,507
- Honey, I got to go, I got...
- Honey!

78
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,571
- Janice!
- Yeah.

79
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,048
I'm taking Gary in the back.

80
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,790
Look, we can do this the easy way
or we can do this the hard way.

81
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,555
And I get it, you're naked, you're vulnerable
but this is a safe place, you know.

82
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,325
No need to resort to cheap theatrics.

83
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,400
We're better than that, right? We're artists.

84
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,596
So, let's just keep it dignified.

85
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,975
Look, kid.

86
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:55,207
If you don't smile, your mom doesn't buy
any prints and I don't get paid.

87
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,643
So, suck it up.

88
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,447
All right, baby. You like it when I'm bossy?

89
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,518
Okay! Okay.

90
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,518
Work the feet. Show me those gums!
That's it, baby!

91
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,324
Holly, these are amazing.

92
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,528
Well, I can give you 20% off
on prints if you order today.

93
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,506
- Oh, my God! I am so sorry.
- Okay!

94
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,211
That's okay. It happens.

95
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,338
You know the last guy
who threw up on me?

96
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,473
You know what I did? I married him.

97
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,611
You're so good with kids.
You should have one of your own.

98
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,313
Yeah. That's kind of the plan.

99
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,822
Well, don't wait too long.
You don't wanna miss your window.

100
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,982
Right.

101
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,494
Yeah! Let's get you cleaned up. Yeah.

102
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,390
What do you got?

103
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,524
Some wine, cheese and crackers,
your favorites.

104
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,124
That's a real treat.

105
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,596
So what's the movie anyway?

106
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,400
<i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

107
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,203
All right! That's a good one. Yeah.

108
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,139
What are you...

109
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,637
I would like to propose a toast.

110
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,741
Okay. But you haven't had a drink
in two years.

111
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,609
I just...

112
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,848
I think we should take a break from trying.

113
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,184
And just be us for a while.

114
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,257
All right. I'll drink to that. Sure.

115
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,355
To us.

116
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:20,058
And if that doesn't work
we'll do three rounds of IVF.

117
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,631
And if that doesn't work,

118
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,000
we'll just adopt, which will be great,

119
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,972
because I have no fears,
genetic or otherwise.

120
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,302
To us.

121
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,409
To not snuffing out the flame.

122
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,639
- Okay.
- Okay.

123
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,915
What are you doing? Oh, my God!
Are you gonna go for it?

124
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,348
You're going for it. You did it.

125
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,822
You just... You crushed it.
You crushed a glass of wine.

126
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,390
Oh, my God, I'm wasted.

127
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,225
Yeah, I bet you are!

128
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:54,194
It's so good. Why have I wasted two years
not drinking this?

129
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,794
Oh, my God! The Big Pig is here.

130
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,733
- I didn't even get a tweet!
- All right, people.

131
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,238
It's swine time, let's go!
What do you want, bud?

132
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,708
Yeah, give me two carnitas tacos
and a jalapeno fritter.

133
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,768
Good man. You have your cardiologist
on speed dial, right?

134
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,505
Right? You do, right? Hey, girls.

135
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,383
How are you?
Best meal on wheels right here.

136
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,885
Tell that to my cheese and bacon panini.
Total foodgasm.

137
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,688
Bacon?

138
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,488
Have a good night.

139
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,018
Bacon.

140
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,358
You know what? I'm also gonna get
the Georgia Dog Special.

141
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,533
- Yo, chef. Where're you going?
- Two seconds.

142
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,398
I added to my order.
Do you think he heard it?

143
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,664
I can't do anything with gloves on.

144
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,428
What can I get you guys?

145
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,000
All right, excellent choice.

146
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,134
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

147
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,143
There's a line if you want to order.

148
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,047
The only thing I'm ordering is for you
to stop serving bacon, okay? Pig's our turf.

149
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,984
Oh, my God! Your turf?

150
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,650
- Yeah.
- Is this <i>West Side Story?</i>

151
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,712
Are we gonna rumble at midnight?

152
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,351
You know what, maybe I got
a whole gang of back-up dancers

153
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,019
- just ready to go, okay?
- Wow!

154
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,119
You're the cheese truck, so stick to cheese.

155
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,256
- Can I order now?
- No! Just give me one second, please.

156
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,697
That's funny, 'cause I noticed that those
jalapeno fritters you guys are serving...

157
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,863
Are awesome, right? They're my invention.
I made them.

158
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,497
They have ricotta cheese in them.

159
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,439
Come on! That's like a little bit of cheese.

160
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,170
That's nothing compared
to the bacon crutch

161
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,768
you're propping these sandwiches up on.

162
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,406
They're paninis, they're grilled peach
and blue cheese paninis,

163
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,949
with a dash of bacon.

164
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,746
Also awesome. Also my invention.

165
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,887
All right, you wanna go? Let's go.
Your special against my special.

166
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,549
Whoever sells the most tonight, wins.

167
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,225
- Fine.
- Fine.

168
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,319
All right, if I win,
you have to have a drink with me.

169
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,320
And if you win, you may have

170
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,626
- three drinks with me.
- That's cute.

171
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,191
So you can stand me up again?
No thank you.

172
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,466
That was five years ago.
But that's sweet you still remember that.

173
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,905
I'm impressed, Rosie.

174
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,067
I'll see you in the field, all right?

175
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,043
- It doesn't keep me up nights.
- Sure.

176
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,477
Who's that?

177
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,480
This guy from high school. Total player.

178
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,042
I'd play with that.

179
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,984
Don't be gross. Don't be that girl.

180
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,789
You're not still hungry, are you?

181
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,920
I don't know. It depends on what you got left
in your picnic basket.

182
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,193
Dr. Cooper. We're in a public place.

183
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,962
I know. It's all so unscheduled.

184
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,093
I win.

185
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,198
What did you think was gonna happen?

186
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,400
Well, I asked you to prom first, all right.
And then you said, "Maybe"

187
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,873
- so I decided to ask someone else.
- No, I didn't...

188
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,706
Yes, you did. So I asked someone else.
Then you said, "Yes."

189
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,874
So I tried to take you both.
What's so wrong with that?

190
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,509
- I'm not saying it worked.
- Fine.

191
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,844
I blocked out most of high school anyway.

192
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,786
Hey. Where'd you get this guy?

193
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,447
I fought a grill and the grill won.

194
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,992
Why'd you fight the grill?
It always wins.

195
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,324
- "Chef hands." Occupational hazard.
- Yeah, guys love it, though.

196
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,293
- Do they?
- Guys love burned hands.

197
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,661
Yeah? Check this out. Okay.

198
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,133
First time breaking down a pig
when I was 16.

199
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,169
- Five stitches. Five. Yeah.
- Five?

200
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,205
- That is adorable!
- I wasrt asking your opinion, that's okay.

201
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,035
- That is adorable!
- All right, I wasrt asking your opinion.

202
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,804
Look. A deli slicer
nearly took my whole thumb off.

203
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,573
All right. Second-degree burn.
Making caramels.

204
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,213
- Your own fault.
- Yeah, I know.

205
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,874
Home-made is the best, though.

206
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,283
- So good for you for trying.
- Never again. Never again.

207
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,014
- Julienning shallots.
- Julienning shallots?

208
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,580
'Cause Julianne, ex-girlfriend, right there,
she got me.

209
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,853
- Julianne. I see what you did there.
- I know.

210
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,020
- That's good.
- Yeah? It was good, right? I saved it for you.

211
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,030
Whoever she was, you probably deserved it.

212
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,800
What? You are so mean.
Are you always this mean?

213
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,301
- Always.
- Is that your gift?

214
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,032
Always?

215
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,935
Okay.

216
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,003
Okay, Trouble. I'm gonna go.

217
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,111
- You're gonna go?
- I'm gonna go.

218
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,251
- It's been super real.
- Where do you think you're going?

219
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:11,153
- It's been great catching up with you...
- Yes!

220
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,924
Formal handshake. Good to see you.

221
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,653
Maybe I'll see you on the truck line

222
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,785
- again sometime, right?
- Yeah.

223
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,256
Yeah, Rosie Brennan.

224
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,456
- Your hands are on my waist.
- They are on your waist, aren't they?

225
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,762
How did they find themselves there?
I don't know.

226
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,235
This is really awkward, isn't it?

227
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,271
Well, if you don't stop me,
I'm just gonna kiss you.

228
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,272
Is that gonna be okay?

229
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,589
This is me getting in my car.

230
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,058
This is you waving goodbye.

231
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,530
My zipper's stuck.

232
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,037
Is that our alarm?

233
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,163
What?

234
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,834
- Yeah. Definitely.
- No, I think our car's that way.

235
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,308
<i>No, it's this way.</i>

236
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,759
Water feels so good.

237
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,160
Good, baby.

238
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,390
Do you want some tea?

239
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,861
No.

240
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,028
Are you sure you're not freaking out?

241
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,936
Seriously, I mean, just say so.
I can handle it.

242
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,538
Freak out's a little strong.

243
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,873
I really thought I had a bum fallopian tube.

244
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,044
- I just don't wanna force it.
- Hey, Crazy.

245
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,680
I wanted to be with you
before you were pregnant.

246
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,014
This just speeds things up a little.

247
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,311
- A lot.
- So?

248
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,180
We're old enough. We love each other.

249
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,256
What's to figure out?

250
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,023
Apart from what are you gonna do
about your show?

251
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,429
Well, we start filming in three weeks

252
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,059
and I'll be finished before I have to deliver.

253
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:08,531
So, basically, I am going to be
helping people get thin while I get fat.

254
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,338
What are you doing?

255
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah!

256
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,677
- Shit! My tattoo!
- So what?

257
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,554
You're not gonna be the only mom out there
with that Spring Break dolphin. Trust me.

258
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,181
But those other moms
aren't getting judged like me.

259
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,119
Good call, Holly.
"I'll never get tired of a dolphin."

260
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,688
I'm not tired of it. I smile every time I see it.

261
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,698
Oh, God! Stop!

262
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,462
Let's do it.

263
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,903
- Let's see.
- Okay.

264
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,775
No, no, no!

265
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:44,866
What? No!

266
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,610
- Even our wedding photo?
- I'm not taking any chances.

267
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,904
Okay?

268
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,541
Be normal.

269
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,889
And you're planning on
bringing the baby home here?

270
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,116
- Yeah, we're...
- No.

271
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,751
No, this is just a rental.

272
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,091
We're buying a house, a really nice house.

273
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:08,429
A big yard, one story,
no pool or sharp edges of any kind.

274
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,264
Yeah, we're moving into a padded cell.

275
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,897
And why did you choose Ethiopia?

276
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,138
Honestly, we would have been happy
adopting from anywhere.

277
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,771
We were on a waiting list for Guatemala,
but then they closed their adoptions.

278
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:25,112
So we started researching Ethiopia
and we just...

279
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,942
We just really fell in love with the culture.

280
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,618
Plus, all the white babies were taken.

281
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,690
You're a comedian?

282
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,183
- No. He's not.
- No.

283
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,089
- He's not even funny. At all.
- Yeah.

284
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,759
What he does is, he actually picks songs
for commercials for an ad agency.

285
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,062
- Great health insurance.
- Yeah.

286
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,539
They're working on a big ad
for Delta Air Lines...

287
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,099
Well, we're bidding on it.
It's not a done deal yet.

288
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,570
And how's the photography business?

289
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,206
Well, I'm still waiting for the Guggeneim
to start collecting my work.

290
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,012
But until then, I'm shooting at
the Aquarium.

291
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,144
And, you know, it pays the bills.

292
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,124
"All the white babies were taken"?

293
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,658
What?

294
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:09,885
Cookie?

295
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:10,986
No, thank you.

296
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,223
So you think we're looking at a year?

297
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,757
Well, every case has its own timeline.
You just have to be patient.

298
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,297
But on average, yes, a year. Maybe more.

299
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,937
More?

300
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,571
I could work with that, right?
Yeah, that sounds good.

301
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,176
So does that mean you like us?

302
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,974
I don't see any red flags.

303
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,349
But you need to baby-proof
if you're going to stay here.

304
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,987
Yeah. Of course.

305
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,516
Do you have a wedding photo?

306
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,889
The Ethiopian authorities really like to
see that in the packet.

307
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,825
- No.
- Yeah, we do.

308
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,091
- Of course we do. Yeah, we do.
- No, we don't. We lost it.

309
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,293
- Yeah. We do. Where is it?
- No! No! No!

310
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,437
I think it's right here.

311
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,736
Vegas. It was a costume wedding.

312
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,201
I was Prince, Holly was a showgirl.

313
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,237
He loves <i>Purple Rain.</i>

314
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,681
You know what, why don't we just say
it got burned in a fire?

315
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,249
Good one.

316
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,810
- Here.
- Thank you.

317
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,121
Wendy, can I go
on my 15-minute Facebook break?

318
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,519
Wendy?

319
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,526
Wendy?

320
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,622
Are you dead?

321
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,495
Hey.

322
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,061
Man, I was dreaming
that I had a kangaroo pouch.

323
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,938
That sounds awesome.

324
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,434
It was like a purse.
I could hide my snacks in it.

325
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,910
You're like a human-kanga hybrid.

326
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,441
I like to rub my breasts, too.

327
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,386
Gary! Gar Bear!

328
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:53,123
Gar! Gary! Gar Bear! Gar!

329
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,458
- Wendy!
- We're pregnant!

330
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,670
I'm with child! We're pregnant!

331
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,433
- Oh, my God!
- We did it!

332
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:07,034
My balls work! My balls work! Oh, my God!

333
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,313
Keep it in your lane, people.

334
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,178
I did it! I did it!

335
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,151
- We did it! We're gonna have a baby!
- We made a baby!

336
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,625
Shit!

337
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,456
Rosie, hurry up!
I need my lucky bra for my interview.

338
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,126
Ro!

339
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,830
Two seconds, that's all I wanted.

340
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:32,028
What's her deal?
I thought she finally got laid.

341
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,128
I don't know.

342
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,532
I love these hardwood floors!

343
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,641
This is it, baby. It's so perfect.
This is the one.

344
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,209
Are you insane?
We're not buying, we're just looking.

345
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,843
You want the house or the baby?

346
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,317
I want the house for the baby.

347
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,616
We can't afford it.

348
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,814
- Hi.
- Hi.

349
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,488
Hi.

350
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,287
Look, this is it.
This is the one we have to get.

351
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,523
We're just looking.

352
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,301
- Stop worrying.
- Okay, okay.

353
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,565
It's just, he gives me a hard time
when I'm late, you know.

354
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,633
Don't let him get into your head.

355
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,041
Yeah. Okay. You're right.
He can't ruin this. Not today.

356
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,510
No.

357
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,240
So, Dad.

358
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,146
Wendy and I have
a little announcement to make.

359
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,445
- We're pregnant!
- We're pregnant!

360
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,318
Oh, my God!

361
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:29,885
Isn't that great?

362
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,726
- So are we!
- What?

363
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,266
You're... What, are you... Are you kidding?

364
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,995
Yeah, hell's bells.
I guess it's congratulations to all of us.

365
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,072
Holy... I had no idea
that you guys were even trying.

366
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,672
- We werert!
- No.

367
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,871
Now, look, son,
there's no blanks in this pistol.

368
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,345
Boom!

369
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,242
You guys, you've been trying
for quite a while.

370
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,149
What two, three months?
Something like that?

371
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,978
Two years.

372
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,856
Not everything's a race, Dad.

373
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,116
- Gar.
- No.

374
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,683
- Yeah. Right?
- No. Not everything.

375
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,087
Only things where you can come in first.

376
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,261
- Okay.
- Come on.

377
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,199
Gary, let's celebrate.
Let's go to Margaritaville.

378
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,203
- I don't wanna go to Margaritaville.
- Come on.

379
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,704
I don't wanna go to Margaritaville.

380
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,405
Everybody wants to go to Margaritaville.

381
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,135
- I don't wanna go.
- Come on!

382
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,840
I'm gonna break out
the Don Julio "Blank-o."

383
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,506
"Blanco," Dad. "Blanco."
That's how you pronounce it.

384
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,109
And it's 11:00 a.m., kind of early for shots.

385
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,013
- It's 5:00 somewhere.
- True.

386
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,384
- Don't be a pussy.
- You know what?

387
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,857
Margaritaville is <i>abierto</i> for business.

388
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,523
Wendy, I just have to say, I am just
so happy to have a baby expert in the family.

389
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,862
Are you feeling anything yet?

390
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,958
Joy.

391
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,697
- Yeah.
- Some exhaustion.

392
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:49,202
A little nausea. Some heartburn.
And my boobs are killing me.

393
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,573
Plus, I have to pee every five minutes.

394
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:56,307
But it's just proof
that a miracle is happening inside of me.

395
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,973
So I'm so happy.

396
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,550
It is a miracle, isn't it?

397
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,349
I mean, I thought I'd have to
give up my Pilates, and my running

398
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,952
- and tennis and my strip-aerobics.
- Sure.

399
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,586
And kickboxing, just all my activities.

400
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,926
But it just turns out
I have all this extra energy.

401
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,199
- You know? You know?
- Oh, yeah.

402
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,734
Plus,

403
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,635
I'm like crazy-horny.

404
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,132
- Okay. Okay.
- I mean,

405
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:26,506
if I even get a whiff of Ramsey,
it's like I just have to pounce, you know?

406
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,170
And I gotta give this old boy credit.

407
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:32,512
He's still got that race car engine
that can go the distance.

408
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,743
- Hormones. What're you gonna do?
- Yeah. Yeah.

409
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,789
I don't know.
Maybe not talk about it at brunch?

410
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,983
- Yep, that's what I'd do.
- That's what I'd do, too.

411
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,719
We're on the same page on that one.

412
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,658
Honey, I know you can't have any

413
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,663
- so I'm gonna do one for you and the baby.
- The baby!

414
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,058
Sweet.

415
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,459
- Here's to the Coopers.
- Yeah, you know what, what the hell.

416
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,164
Yeah.

417
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,936
Well, that was delicious.

418
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,772
Honey, I didn't make any of it.
You know Ramsey don't want me cooking.

419
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,470
- Your mom and I...
- Not my mom.

420
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,309
We sure wish y'all could stay longer.

421
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,113
Yeah. That's the thing. It's such a bummer,

422
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,880
but the missus
and little Mini Cooper and I,

423
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,148
we have an appointment.

424
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,985
- Yes, at...
- Walmart.

425
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,524
- For paint.
- Yeah. And mulch.

426
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:17,653
Well, you know what they say.
Money isn't everything,

427
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,959
but sure keeps you connected to your kids.

428
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,764
- So how much you need?
- Dad, I don't need any money.

429
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,300
- I don't need any money.
- Come on. How much you need?

430
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,461
No, I don't need anything at all.
Thank you so much.

431
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,697
- Man pats.
- Man pats, that's great.

432
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,240
Come here, baby, give your mama a kiss.

433
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,467
- What?
- Okay...

434
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,134
- Baby.
- Okay.

435
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,804
My baby boy. I'm so proud of you.
You've grown up so fast.

436
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,871
Okay, Gary. Gar.

437
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,347
- What? Yeah.
- Okay.

438
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,577
- Awesome. This was so much...
- All right. We'll see y'all later.

439
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,621
Yeah, great, this was a thing, you know?

440
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,553
- Congratulations!
- Yeah, congrats.

441
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,320
- Come back soon!
- Don't ever kiss her again.

442
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,456
Well...

443
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,359
Okay. Are you sure you took the test right?

444
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,796
You pee on a stick. It's idiot-proof.

445
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,169
No, I know. It's just, you know, one time.

446
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,264
Yeah.

447
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,109
So what do you want to do?

448
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,449
I don't know.

449
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,551
What do you want to do?

450
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,411
Look, I don't know.

451
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:21,721
I just found out, okay? You're the girl.
Don't you get to decide?

452
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,693
Great, great. So then it's all on me?

453
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,753
No. No, I didn't mean...

454
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,462
Shit. Should we get married?

455
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,162
"Shit. Should we get married?" Yeah.

456
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,237
No, it's just,
when you put it like that, that's...

457
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,436
I'm sorry, Rosie.
I'm just trying to do the right thing here.

458
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,309
- I didn't mean to...
- Then don't ask the wrong questions.

459
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,443
- Just forget that I said anything.
- No.

460
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,885
Just forget it 'cause I'll figure it out.
Whatever it is, it's not your problem.

461
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,182
- Rosie!
- It's fine.

462
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,780
I have to get back to the truck anyway.

463
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,335
There he is!

464
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,164
Perfect. Okay, guys, look right here.

465
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,230
Big smile.

466
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,538
Aristotle! Good smile!

467
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,747
Okay, beautiful. You can pick up your prints
at the kiosk at the front.

468
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,577
All right, everyone.
Aristotle needs his down time.

469
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,514
Okay, can we all wave bye-bye?

470
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,286
Bye!

471
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,090
Thank you, nice friend.

472
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,123
So, how's Alex? Is he excited?

473
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,058
Yeah! Yeah! He's...

474
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:33,757
No. Actually, he's... I don't know.

475
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,062
I don't know. Maybe he's just not ready.

476
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,125
- They're never ready.
- Yeah.

477
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,262
Dude's group.

478
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,669
- What?
- Dude's group.

479
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,298
It's like <i>Fight Club,</i>

480
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,707
only there's no fighting,
everybody has babies,

481
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,802
they don't talk about what they do there.

482
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,870
I don't know what they do there
and I don't need to know.

483
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,883
All I know is that Craig started going
when I was pregnant with Henri

484
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,010
- and he's losing his shit.
- Yeah.

485
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:58,783
Now, he loves being a dad
and he never misses a Saturday.

486
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,758
You want Alex ready?
Send him to the dudes.

487
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,453
Your blood pressure is low
and you are in good health.

488
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,397
- And Dad's gonna keep you that way, right?
- Right.

489
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,366
- Look at these pamphlets.
- Thank you.

490
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,528
That's all we need to know.
Let's not go crazy with the research.

491
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,765
I love research. It soothes me.

492
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,070
Well then, you'll love the wall.
I'll see you both in a month.

493
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,837
Wow!

494
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,742
- Look at the wall!
- No, no, no, no.

495
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,008
I don't want to know about
everything that can go wrong.

496
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,515
Oh, my God! Look at this.

497
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,347
Okay, there's breast-feeding,
we have to know about this.

498
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,712
Cord-blood-banking,
this is very important these days.

499
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,985
You need to learn the Bradley Method.
And... What?

500
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,253
"Circumcision: Yes or No?"

501
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,488
Of course. How is that even a question?

502
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,588
Actually, a lot of couples are choosing
not to circumcise these days.

503
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,590
- Interesting.
- Who said that?

504
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,101
The expert, honey.
So clearly, there's a question.

505
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,571
- That's why it says "Yes or No?"
- My answer is "Yes." Yes! Yes!

506
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,834
- My answer is, "I need to read about it."
- No more...

507
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,839
See you tomorrow, okay?

508
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:03,313
I'm not gonna forget it.

509
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,288
<i>Can I get a "I can do it"? You can do it!</i>

510
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,057
<i>- I can do it!</i>
<i>- Who are you doing it for?</i>

511
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,961
Oh, my God.
Damn, this show gives me the munchies.

512
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,294
<i>This is the beginning of the rest of your life!</i>

513
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,062
I so wanna do that slide-y thing.

514
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,898
I feel so bad, but it's hilarious.

515
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,337
- No, no, this is just so funny.
- I hope they're having fun.

516
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:26,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

517
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,774
Marco, this is Courtney and Molly.

518
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,608
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- And vice-versa.

519
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:35,312
I thought you said "Cute Marco."
Not "Hot Marco."

520
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,418
Well done, Rosie.

521
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,150
- Well done.
- You said I was cute?

522
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,657
- Ignore them.
- Yeah, we did.

523
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,657
So, you're going, right?

524
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,592
No, I'm not. I've already got friends.

525
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,529
- But these guys all have babies.
- Yeah. That sounds terrible.

526
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,027
Craig goes. You like Craig.

527
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,003
I tolerate Craig at a barbecue.
Not as a forced play date.

528
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:01,508
- Lf you go, just once...
- Holly, I am trying to work here, okay?

529
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,407
- Oh, my God!
- I'll give you one right here, right now.

530
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,717
Really?

531
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,481
- Right here, right now?
- Yes.

532
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,327
Hey, Craig.

533
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,700
Alex, Vic. Vic, Alex.

534
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,734
Welcome to Happy Hour.

535
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,399
Let's walk.

536
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,310
I sense your fear, Alex. It's cool.

537
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:45,876
You're still on the other side.

538
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,846
Stay on that side, Alex.

539
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,614
This is the side
where happiness goes to die.

540
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,245
Don't mind Craig. He's had a bad week.

541
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:55,589
Kara just took a three-day business trip
and little Henry there just got sick.

542
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,585
- Here you go, big boy. Walk it off.
- Thanks.

543
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:02,394
By the way, when we're around Kara,
it's still "Henri." "Henry's" on the DL.

544
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,695
- Henri.
- You got that, Alex?

545
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,760
It's very important. That's the first rule.

546
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,237
- Don't talk about what we walk about.
- Rule #1.

547
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,399
Got it.

548
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,672
See, Alex, women pretty much control
the baby universe. And why not?

549
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,942
They carried the damn things,
pushed them outta their vaginas.

550
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,779
I never used to use that word
for that part of the body but, trust me,

551
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,250
once a baby comes out of it, it's a vagina.

552
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,614
- Yeah!
- It changes.

553
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,623
Here, we're free.
No one's looking over your shoulder.

554
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,387
If you put the diaper on backwards
or forget to heat the bottle up,

555
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,960
you go with it.

556
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,656
If you wanna ditch those carrot sticks
and feed your kid McNuggets

557
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:34,993
- you go for it.
- Who cares?

558
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,192
And if your wife named your kid "Henri"

559
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,327
and you wanna ignore
that silent-H bullshit...

560
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,964
- Bullshit!
...you're in a safe place. What's up, Henry!

561
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,337
- Good to know.
- Henri. What is he, a mime?

562
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,574
Where does "Henri" come from anyway?

563
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,874
<i>- Cirque du Soleil.</i>
- So dumb.

564
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,612
It looks like
you've got your hands full there.

565
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,878
Yeah, I got four under five.

566
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,220
One more, we can run a full court.
Two more and I got pallbearers.

567
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,892
I got Evander here. Venus and Jeter
are my twins, and my main man Jordan.

568
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:07,822
Sure, twice a year, I think about the price
of college and cry in my car for a half hour.

569
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,697
But then I punch myself in the dick
and get over it.

570
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,328
- I can go for four more.
- Really?

571
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,632
Come on, Jordan. Keep up.

572
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,473
Craig, do you have some sunscreen?

573
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,375
Relax. Sunburn is full of vitamin D.

574
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,072
- Guys! It's Davis!
- Totally!

575
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,305
- D-Bone!
- Hey, big guy!

576
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,576
Fellas.

577
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,811
What's up, bro?

578
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,180
Offspring. New guy.

579
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,280
What's up, man?

580
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,915
- Everybody good?
- Yeah, man.

581
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,825
So, D-Biscuit, haven't seen you
hanging around. Where you been?

582
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,762
- Costa Rica, bro.
- Central America, classic.

583
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:40,855
I had to do some work.

584
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,024
- Really?
- Working it.

585
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:45,000
- "Work!"
- This lucky bastard's a surf photographer,

586
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,866
- travels all over.
- Sweet.

587
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,102
What?

588
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,109
Costa Rica.

589
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,972
The mountains of Costa Rica.

590
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,642
Whoa! Whoa!

591
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,012
That's classified.

592
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,452
Gotta watch it, Davis.
That one looks like a wife.

593
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,580
She got "wife eyes."

594
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,323
"Girlfriend tits," but definitely "wife eyes."

595
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,588
I've got to get better pictures on my phone.

596
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,027
Your phone ain't the problem, bro.

597
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,656
Come on. You guys are the ones
living the real dream.

598
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,723
I will <i>Freaky Friday</i> with you anytime.

599
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,766
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, Patel, what's the Camaro situation?

600
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,237
- You ready to sell that bad boy or what?
- Never.

601
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,433
- Never?
- Yeah.

602
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,305
Ask him when was the last time he drove it.

603
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,809
Plus, you can't even get
a car seat in that thing.

604
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,843
Patel's wife wants him to trade in
his '69 Camaro.

605
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,240
We have bets on how long he can last.

606
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,809
Gabriel, I understand you've embraced
the minivan, and that's your journey,

607
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,516
but I don't want to drive a vagina on wheels.

608
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,624
My vagina seats seven, comfortably.

609
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,093
I've been in it a million times.

610
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,858
Plus, Patel test drove a minivan
last week anyway.

611
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,398
- What?
- So?

612
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,826
That doesn't mean anything!

613
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,233
I look at houses with Holly,
but we're not buying one.

614
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,163
- Bro, bro, bro.
- What?

615
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,868
When your wife says
you're just test driving minivans,

616
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,205
you're buying a minivan.

617
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,336
And when she says
you're just looking at houses,

618
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:03,971
- you're buying a house.
- No, I'm not.

619
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,606
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I'm not buying a house.

620
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:06,877
Check your receipts.

621
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,680
Welcome to escrow, bitch.

622
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,021
No, thank you. Have the Breast Day!

623
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,056
Janice! Janice!

624
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,117
- You're not gonna believe this.
- What?

625
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,857
You are looking at
one of the keynote speakers

626
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,399
at the next regional ABC Kids Expo.

627
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,334
- Shut up! No!
- Yes!

628
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,131
You're living your wisdom!

629
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,297
I know!

630
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,568
- She's speaking at the Expo!
- I'm speaking at the Expo!

631
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:35,642
<i>At the Expo, about the breast pump</i>
<i>And the lactation</i>

632
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,845
Sorry, I just... Sorry.

633
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,317
No more cell phones.
Landlines only from here on out.

634
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:51,624
I am protecting my miracle.

635
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,357
Actually, that was my cell phone.

636
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:08,609
Hey, guys. I'm sorry.
Can I just borrow Alex for two secs?

637
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,976
- What?
- This is it!

638
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,310
- Already?
- Yes!

639
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,940
It's supposed to be a year. Or more!

640
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,085
<i>You got lucky. I'm sending his pictures now.</i>

641
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,520
<i>His name is Kaleb, he's six weeks old.</i>

642
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:22,852
<i>We don't have any family medical history</i>
<i>and probably never will</i>

643
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:26,021
<i>so you two will need to consider</i>
<i>whether that'll be an issue for you.</i>

644
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,597
- Well...
- It's not!

645
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,796
- Okay. It's not.
- It's not.

646
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,100
<i>Great, I'll leave you to it.</i>

647
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:44,180
Oh, my God! Alex, look at him!
He's gorgeous!

648
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,107
Can you feel it?

649
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,747
We're gonna be a family.

650
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,415
Oh, yeah. Real soon.

651
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,458
- Here, let's take a picture by the sign.
- All right.

652
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,392
Okay, make sure you get the sign
and the house.

653
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,762
And us.

654
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,537
It's a boy.

655
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,973
- Wow!
- Honey!

656
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,704
I just peed myself a little.

657
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,477
A girl.

658
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,678
- Yes!
- A mini-me!

659
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,054
- We want it to be a surprise.
- It's okay. We don't have to say.

660
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,221
Evan, I'm pregnant. That's surprise enough.
We wanna know.

661
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,456
It's a boy.

662
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:37,262
A boy! That's so cute! I love boys!

663
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,029
It looks like it's a little early to tell.

664
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,573
That's okay.

665
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,410
She looks good.

666
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,671
- It's a boy, Dad.
- Well...

667
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,849
He kinda looks like
the Loch Ness Monster to me,

668
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,579
but I'll take your word for it.

669
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,313
He's beautiful, y'all.

670
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,447
- Thank you.
- Now I will see your baby,

671
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,526
and raise you one more.

672
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,196
Twins!

673
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,865
Twins.

674
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,300
- Oh, my goodness! So great!
- God.

675
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,539
Can you believe it? Two!

676
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,005
Two <i>nmero unos.</i>

677
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,937
- And you got the 4-D ultrasound video.
- Yeah.

678
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,844
Don't you kinda wish you'd done it now?
I offered to pay for it.

679
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,807
So, who wants dessert?

680
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,373
I do! Park it here.

681
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,479
- I don't know if you take it right off...
- What? Maybe you don't.

682
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,887
- Take it easy.
- Wow!

683
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,693
Two! Two <i>nmero unos!</i>

684
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,626
Holy shit!

685
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,828
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop!

686
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:42,923
All right, turn to the side.

687
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,759
Flash me the belly. I want to see it. Come on.

688
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,503
I know. I'm finally starting to show.

689
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,772
- I'm gonna take one every week.
- Nice.

690
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,206
- Watch you two grow.
- That's a good one.

691
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,641
That's a good one, huh?

692
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,578
Little peanut.

693
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,014
I'm really glad you're here.

694
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,017
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

695
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,212
Where else would I be?

696
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,433
Marco? Wake up.

697
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,665
I'm bleeding.

698
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:56,940
<i>Reminding, rewinding</i>
<i>Removing, regretting</i>

It's my fault. I wished it.

709
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,827
Don't say that. It's not your fault. Okay?

710
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,256
I never even felt it kick.

711
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,495
Congratulations. You're off the hook.

712
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,872
Rosie, don't say that. Come on. Hey!

713
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,068
Hey!

714
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,245
Rosie, hey!

715
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,515
We're not a couple.

716
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,751
We've never even been on a real date,
you know.

717
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,960
I think we can do ourselves a favor
and stop pretending.

718
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,689
Rosie! Hey, it's me!

719
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,329
Tequila shots! Don't judge.

720
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,593
Shit, Ro. You okay?

721
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,797
- Yeah, I want to get inside.
- Come on.

722
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,013
<i>Fighting fit.</i>

723
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,849
All right, that's perfect. Let's see the bump.
That's great.

724
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,155
- Turn to your right.
- Can we hurry this up?

725
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:32,354
He's pushing on my bladder.

726
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,954
Great. All right. We got it.

727
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,328
Okay, but did you get my rack?

728
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,765
Because I am gonna need evidence
that I had these.

729
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,166
- We've got proof.
- You got it? Okay.

730
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:40,430
Yeah. That's great. Thanks, Jules.

731
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:42,404
- Jules, that was great.
- Thank you.

732
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,498
We are so excited to have you
as our Spring cover mom.

733
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:45,599
Me, too.

734
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,710
Listen, can we just try to keep it positive?

735
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,143
You know, there's a lot of articles out there

736
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:52,114
that make women over 35 who are pregnant
feel like crap.

737
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,680
- Right.
- And I just don't want...

738
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,549
- No, it's gonna be so...
- Sorry, I've got to take this.

739
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,250
Hey, you. Did you watch it?

740
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:03,417
That circumcision video you sent me?
Give me a little heads up next time.

741
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,324
I was eating lunch. Now I'm scarred for life.

742
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:09,422
Yeah, gross! Nobody needs to see
how the sausage gets made, Jules!

743
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,201
I'm not gonna let somebody
hurt my baby like that.

744
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,533
<i>Jules, trust me.</i>
<i>He's not even gonna remember it.</i>

745
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,935
It's not even medically necessary.

746
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:20,272
And besides, it actually makes the penis
less sensitive.

747
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:23,507
That's why you do it. Give the kid
some endurance, a fighting chance.

748
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,276
He's perfect as he is. I don't get the point.
What is it?

749
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,684
Because I'm Jewish?

750
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:33,086
Half Jewish.
Christmas tree Jewish, that's what you said.

751
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,557
But my penis is full Jew.
This is my jurisdiction.

752
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,026
Okay, so I have no say in
what happens to my son?

753
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,762
Besides, if you had your foreskin,
maybe I would like you a little bit more.

754
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,925
How much more?

755
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,764
A tip more.

756
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,998
Look, I would feel shafted if we didn't do it.

757
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,009
Can we discuss this weirdness later?
I'm working.

758
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,806
Okay.

759
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:55,971
I love you. Bye.

760
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,240
Love you, too.

761
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,015
Well, if it's any consolation,
I like an uncut guy.

762
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,646
Yeah, I once banged my way
straight across Eastern Europe.

763
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,417
It was fun.

764
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,726
I don't know, man. Out of the blue,
I got this call and suddenly...

765
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,192
- Jordan!
...we got this baby.

766
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,923
- That's right, you got a baby.
- It's not good.

767
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,625
They said it was gonna be
at least a year or more, all right?

768
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,828
And that's the one thing you can count on
with adoption, right? Time.

769
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,299
I need that time to save, to get ready.

770
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,865
There's no such thing as ready.

771
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:28,503
You just jump on a moving train
and try not to die.

772
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,244
- Great.
- What's up, man? You terrified?

773
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,044
Because you should be.

774
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,585
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna get to the hospital room.

775
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:39,714
And she's gonna be laying there
with her legs splayed wide open.

776
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,948
My woman gave birth doggie-style.

777
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,456
They can do that, you know.

778
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,464
And then out is gonna slide a little miracle.

779
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:52,628
Half you, half her, your DNA all mixed
together in one magical baby cocktail.

780
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,295
The best day of your life.

781
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,202
That's sweet, but Alex here is adopting.

782
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,341
Yeah, do it that way. No fuss, no muss.

783
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,002
Come on, Jordan!

784
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,442
- What if he hates me?
- He will.

785
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:08,383
I mean, what if he tries to kill me
in my sleep when he's 15?

786
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,249
Well, then I guess
you're not a very good father.

787
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,288
That's normal.
That's like every Greek tragedy.

788
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,482
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys.

789
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,354
I'm serious, okay? I need help.

790
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:16,584
Dude, you're gonna be fine.

791
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,924
You've just got to get over
your fear of babies. They can smell fear.

792
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:20,827
Like bears or wives.

793
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,695
You need some practice.
Here, hold Henry for a second.

794
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,994
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Do not do that.

795
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,093
- Do not touch his baby!
- Shut up!

796
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,195
That kid is a grenade, and he will go off.

797
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,536
You know what, start with Evander here.
She never cries.

798
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,766
No, I'm cool, thank you.

799
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,208
She fell off the changing table last week,
didn't make a sound.

800
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,740
You dropped your kid off a changing table?

801
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,006
How was that even possible?

802
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:40,274
It's very possible.

803
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,343
It's much more common than you think.
But you know what? Rule number two...

804
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,910
- We don't judge.
- No judging.

805
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,614
Stuffjust happens, okay?
Last week my kid ate a cigarette.

806
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,660
I caught him playing in the dryer yesterday.

807
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,127
I picked up the wrong baby from day care.

808
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,891
Found my baby swimming in the toilet.

809
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:57,331
And for the record,
the roll-off did not happen on my watch.

810
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,369
- Dodged a bullet.
- No judging.

811
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,870
- Come on. Come on.
- No, really, that's okay.

812
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,032
- Come on. Come on. Here you go!
- That's all right.

813
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,741
Good catch.

814
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,635
Take her back.

815
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:09,836
Take her back!

816
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,708
I hope that adoption agency
has a return policy.

817
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,149
Big help, guys. Glad I came out.

818
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,351
It's Davis!

819
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,286
Davis! Davis! Davis!

820
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,359
- Yeah, bro!
- D-Bone!

821
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,551
- What is up?
- Boom.

822
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,562
S'up fellas, kids, Jordan!

823
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,257
Dude, this kid is like Mickey Rourke
in <i>The Wrestler.</i>

824
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:34,869
I wish he was that well behaved.
He's more like Mickey Rourke in real life.

825
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:37,935
So tall.

826
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,532
- Been working out?
- Yeah.

827
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,239
I missed out on high fives before.
I'll take one if you had a spare.

828
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,946
- I got you, Craig.
- Thank you.

829
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,479
- Sorry, Davis.
- All right, I'm out of here.

830
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,689
Nice job, Craig.

831
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,576
Kara, what time is it?

832
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,184
I've got 20 minutes to make it
to the crib sale at Babies "R" Us.

833
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,518
I've been totally cracking out on baby stuff.

834
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,215
Sneaker-socks.
I've got my 2-in-1 swing rocker.

835
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,689
What is with the face?

836
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,096
Holly, I'm sorry to tell you this

837
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,965
but we just had our budget meeting,

838
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,129
and I don't know
that we're renewing your contract.

839
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:45,631
I've got to cut down on all my freelancers.
You were the last one hired.

840
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,712
Wait. But this is my main job.

841
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,439
We're about to close on the house.

842
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:58,415
I'm doing what I can to keep you,
but it just isn't looking good.

843
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,895
Okay.

844
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,527
- Don't hate me.
- No.

845
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,734
Do me a favor?

846
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:24,009
Don't tell Alex
until I can find something else. Okay?

847
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,639
Okay.

848
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,912
Okay.

849
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,675
- I'm sorry.
- No.

850
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:35,223
And reach! And push.
Okay now, break starfish formation.

851
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,489
Let's get back in position.
I want opposite sets. Crunch it up.

852
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,757
I want 10 of those on each side.
That's 20, people.

853
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,456
And I need a minute.
And don't think I won't be watching you.

854
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,626
Keep it moving.

855
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:49,569
"I'm Not Circumcising My Baby."
Well done. Well done. Front page.

856
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,007
Okay, look, I was gonna tell you.
I did not say this to them.

857
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:56,341
They overheard our private conversation.
I would never talk to them about us.

858
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,811
Why is this such a big deal to you?

859
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:00,372
Because I don't think that it's right.
And I'm his mother.

860
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,510
And I'm his father.
Parenthood is about compromise.

861
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,418
- Well, then compromise, Evan.
- I have.

862
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:08,489
I stay at your place.
We spend the holidays with your family.

863
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,091
Yeah, but I have sacrificed
my entire body for this.

864
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,890
So that means
you just get to win every argument?

865
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,523
No, that means that in every relationship...

866
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,067
What are you guys doing?
Come on! Pick it up!

867
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,897
In every relationship,
there's an alpha and a beta.

868
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,064
- And I'm the alpha.
- And I'm the alpha.

869
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,165
- No, I'm the alpha. No, I am!
- No, I'm the alpha. No, I am!

870
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,334
Jinx.

871
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:33,411
You know, I'm just gonna
stay at my place tonight.

872
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:40,188
Hey, Jules! If you're interested,
I never got snipped.

873
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,901
<i>Only one star</i>
<i>on the tango last week, Megan,</i>

874
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,703
<i>but the samba's still to come.</i>
<i>How do you feel?</i>

875
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,800
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't really care about the trophy.</i>

876
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,175
<i>I'm here for Evan.</i>

877
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,070
<i>Right, Papa-daddy?</i>

878
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,741
<i>Evan has promised</i>
<i>he's gonna knock me up next.</i>

879
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,009
<i>She's kidding, Jules.</i>

880
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:10,576
<i>No, I'm not, Jules.</i>
<i>We're gonna be sister-wives!</i>

882
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:24,961
Why don't you take a break. I have this.

883
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,559
Thanks.

884
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,179
Okay E-invite, draft 38.

885
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,308
Okay.

886
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:45,617
"Let's shower Wendy and Gary Cooper
with light and love

887
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,123
"to honor the arrival of their Mini Cooper."

888
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,453
That's cute.

889
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:53,690
And then I put a picture of a Mini Cooper

890
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:55,857
at the end.

891
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:56,957
Where did you get the picture?

892
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,025
I stole it from the Internet.

893
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:04,904
Wendy, shut your pregnant face.
You do not want to see this.

894
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:10,935
It's okay. She's my mother-in-law-ish.
Shit, hi!

895
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:12,780
Wendy, hi!

896
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,908
Skyler, hi!

897
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:16,111
Look at our bellies.

898
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,814
We are like twins!
Except I'm actually having twins.

899
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:23,891
You really love to remind me about that
every time. Hi.

900
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,527
I just came by to personally invite y'all
to our baby shower.

901
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:30,422
Wow, this is your shower invite.

902
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:35,268
Look, I know that Ramsey and Gary have not
always gotten along so well

903
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,897
but we are family. Okay?

904
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,374
And it would just mean the world to me
if y'all came.

905
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,707
Of course, Skyler. That's... You...

906
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:45,772
Wow!

907
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,109
What is it?

908
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:52,380
It's Mini Coopers.

909
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:54,280
Beep beep!

910
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,990
Beep beep! Beep beep...

911
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,560
You know, because there's two of them
and there's two in here, and they're pink.

912
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:03,893
Yeah.

913
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,663
So, Skyler, seven months.
How are you feeling?

914
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,865
With the side effects, you know.
Because I know that

915
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:13,637
at this point in the pregnancy, acne and

916
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:17,441
bleeding gums, constipation,
it's all totally normal. Totally normal.

917
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,817
When my sister was pregnant,
she got herpes.

918
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,779
No, that's... She didn't get...
Not from being pregnant.

919
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,550
No, I feel so whole.

920
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:31,587
You know? And just feminine.
With all this life running through me.

921
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:35,324
I felt the exact same way
when I had my phantom pregnancy.

922
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,125
Don't pay attention to her.

923
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,833
But, yeah, I mean, I just... It's beautiful.

924
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,465
But what am I saying?
You know exactly what this is like.

925
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,037
Totally.

926
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:49,436
Well, I just came
to drop off that little invitation.

927
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,310
And I'm gonna go to my pregger 'lates.

928
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,572
Sounds pregger-ific.

929
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,080
- All right, one more time.
- Bring it in.

930
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:57,620
Okay. I'll see y'all there?

931
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,281
- Yes, I will tell Gary.
- Okay. Thank you.

932
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:01,824
- Yeah.
- Okay.

933
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,122
Hey, Wendy,
do you mind if I take one of these?

934
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,822
- What's that?
- Holly Castillo Photography.

935
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,025
Ramsey's been on me about getting
one of these pregnancy portraits done, so...

936
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:14,363
Well, Holly's the best,
so she'll make you look amazing-er.

937
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:15,695
Bye.

938
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:17,998
Bye. Bye.

939
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:19,700
Bye!

940
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,677
I mean, look at her. No cellulite.
Not even in daylight.

941
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,610
She's wearing six-inch heels.

942
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,546
God, she's like
a magical pregnancy unicorn.

943
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,917
Gary is gonna shit a sideways brick
when he sees this.

944
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,959
Hey, come on! We started Mini Cooper.
That's our thing.

945
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:39,792
We own it, right?

946
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,796
<i>All right! Thank you.</i>
<i>Hey, a little heads up, America.</i>

947
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,423
- Do we have to watch this?
- Yes.

948
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,401
<i>While we send these four home to train</i>
<i>on their own before our live finale</i>

949
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:50,065
<i>some of our previous seasons' contestants</i>
<i>are going to get a little surprise.</i>

950
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,906
<i>That's right. I'm gonna be dropping in</i>
<i>on some of you guys</i>

951
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,877
<i>to see how you're keeping the weight off.</i>
<i>You've been warned.</i>

952
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:01,108
They can't get someone else to fly around
and do these interviews?

953
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:03,477
I don't like you traveling this late.

954
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:06,113
Nobody's asking you to stop doing your job.

955
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,157
Besides, these are my contestants, Evan.

956
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:11,353
I was there when they lost the weight
and I want to be there for them now.

957
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:15,296
You're pushing yourself too hard, Jules.
Especially at your age.

958
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:18,834
Wow! Thanks. That's super-supportive.
I appreciate that.

959
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,733
What, I'm not even
supposed to mention reality?

960
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:25,774
I am healthy. I have a low blood pressure.
Not that you're helping me any.

961
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,504
Look, I just think someone should
go with you and little Jackson there.

962
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,307
Well, you know what, I have my crew,

963
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,973
and you are welcome to leave your show
and come along.

964
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,607
And we are not naming him Jackson.

965
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,049
You liked it last week.

966
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,418
Obviously you caught me
in a moment of weakness.

967
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,049
Honestly, God, seriously, I sometimes think

968
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,253
that it would just be so much easier
if I could do this on my own.

969
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,455
Really? You think that?

970
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:49,959
Come on.

971
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,627
Evan, we danced on a show
for three months together

972
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,170
and suddenly we're supposed to
agree on everything?

973
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,103
Fine. Why don't you make every decision
about our child's entire life

974
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,643
and just send me an email
when you've got it figured out.

975
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:11,977
Why do you do that, Jules?

976
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,721
I know you've been busting ass with work
and getting everything ready for the baby.

977
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,021
- I just wanted to...
- Alex, about work.

978
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,186
- There's something that came up...
- No, no!

979
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:22,288
No shop talk tonight, all right?

980
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,798
I just want to remind you

981
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,199
that even though we're gonna be parents,
we can still kick it old school. All right?

982
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,363
Alex and Holly style.

983
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:33,905
Surprise!

984
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,005
Happy Baby Shower, bitches!

985
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:45,148
<i>Might as well face it</i>
<i>You're addicted to love</i>

986
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:49,285
Listen to that. Someone call the cops.
They're murdering a song.

987
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,553
- I know, it hurts.
- Literally.

988
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:53,061
<i>I love it when you call me Big Poppa</i>

989
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:56,292
<i>Throw your hands in the air</i>
<i>If you're a true player</i>

990
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,561
<i>I love it when you call me Big Poppa</i>

991
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,827
- We should have another baby.
- Oh, yeah!

992
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,338
Come on, you gonna sweat that
weave out tonight.

993
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,601
We got our twins.
Let's go for triplets, all right?

994
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,310
No, no, no, that's baby juice!

995
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:13,473
To us.

996
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,211
To actually getting Rosie out of the house!

997
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,549
In something other than
stained pajama pants.

998
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,301
I'll be right back.
