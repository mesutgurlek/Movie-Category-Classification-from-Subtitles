1
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,774
Oh Look

2
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,937
The first time retail shopping experience

3
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,246
Her nanny try to take her

4
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,612
But she just cry cry

5
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,286
Remember this year on the 17

6
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,786
She had so much potential back then

7
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,886
She is a lawyer. That's way is better

8
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:08,101
There she is. - You always say
she has the had a

9
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,332
perfect shake head for a tiara

10
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,664
Look at that slump dog

11
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,052
it would not be the first time

12
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,062
Oh look at that

13
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:39,031
First day at Howard - Unbelievable

14
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,637
I love that I did that last night

15
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,203
Oh my god that is Bruce first highlight

16
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,147
Is this the key to
the first office at the firm?

17
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,822
Look there she is with congress women

18
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,494
That is two kick ass women

19
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,261
I like them

20
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:13,726
I really like them

21
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,033
The first day they meet

22
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,467
you can see in his eyes

23
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,544
They are truly Romeo and Juliet

24
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:29,849
I think it is her

25
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,510
Quick light out

26
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:36,753
Hollack

27
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,686

28
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,690
Surprise

Marcus, Sabrina I cannot believe

31
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,680
On a country it is a huge Biggy

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,648
Thank you. You guys are the best

33
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,974

34
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,082
You mean this one

35
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,964
Clarity between fk and vvs

36
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,801
Oh my god it is from Amment

37
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,109
Look you guys this is me
and Amment on a snow globe

38
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,633
It is his favorite place
in the whole world

39
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,243
I love snow globe

40
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,081

41
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,049
Well listen honey

42
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,585
You are a full time bride now so you are
going to need all the wardrobe

43
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,050
I am not quitting my job you guys

44
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,121
You guys remember the feeling we get during
a really intense spinning class

45
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,764
That feeling that we feel
so truly amazing about our self

46
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,996
That is what I felt being a lawyer

47
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:57,931
I love it

48
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,908
Congratulation you did it

49
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,311
With tree long answer

50
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:16,385
You manage to totally undermine
the foundation that turns legal

51
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,323
By the way

52
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,486
It only took me two wrong answer

53
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,966
Sweetie you customize my

54
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,436
Ammeth you are not going to
believe my news

55
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:39,539

00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,464
Are you serious

60
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:04,029
Are you sure this is
what you want to do

61
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,801
I could get marry anywhere
I wouldn matter

62
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,901
That is a lie

63
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,373
I am going to get marry
under the green monster

64
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,351
And in just three and 4 days

00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,153
We had so much to talk about

66
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,553

67
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,959

It is absolutely vital to find Bruce

73
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,458
His father might be a little more difficult

74
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,447
may i ask why

75
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:16,840
You want to send an invitation to
your wedding to your dog mother

76
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,803
And you are serious

00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,170

84
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,637
It is from me and the girl

85

i told you they had one

102
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,776

103
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,641

What is it

106
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,855
It is my double platinum VVIP Versace

107
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,298
You got the wrong Versace lady
- Really

108
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,668
Brucer

109
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,961
Oh my god

110
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,535
Come on open this door immediately

111
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,781
Who are you what are you doing here

112
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,875
You had my dog mom in there and
i need her to come out right now

113
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,820
Absolutely not i am not authorize
to realize her

114
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,248
I am not een allowed to have the key

115
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,501
i dont think you are
understanding me

116
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,103
I am willing to pay for her

117
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,607
It is not for sale. It is a legal
property of this facility

118
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,336
And what kind of facility is this

119
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,781
I am so sorry

120
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,744
Ally this Versace is confident in facility

121
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,250
It is a test subject there

122
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,724
I want her out of there immediately

123
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,125
The animal test subject is realize
on voluntary basis

124
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,739
Our law firm represent them.
We can just tell them to fix this

125
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,007
Ok. So how are
you going to convince them

126
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,248
Presenting Brucer Woods

127
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,990
Who am I? Where do i came from

128
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:02,250
Abandon at first i was on my own
at my early age

129
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,190
Fighting on the main street for survival

130
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,965
Turning tricks

131
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,832
Even when i found a loving mother

132
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,082
When i look in the mirror
who would i look

133
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,016
Who was it that was looking back at me

134
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,646
This is Brucer question

135
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,185
I think yes

136
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,616
Thank you

137
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,096
Miss Wood

138
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,805
We are lawyer we have right to
fight for justice

139
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,966
And this is definitely injustice

140
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,971
I cant believe i say that

141
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:58,272
What we fight for is our client
and their best interest

142
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,143
Yes, but isnt doing the right thing
for everybody interest

143
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,183
I think you are confusing
the right thing and the law

144
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,619
You dont think it is the same would you

145
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,198
Why dont we get back to business

146

And discuss your very bright future

147
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,932
Pardon me i dont mean to interrupt

148
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:38,290
Sorry i just dont think i can work
with people that believe that

149
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,352
You know what

150
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,362
You are right

151
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,968
Thank you Mr Blink - You should not work
with people that believe that

152
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,959
Absolutely i knew you would understand

153
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,269
You are fired Dell - What

154
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,669
We only had room
for serious lawyers here

155
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,975
Take the rest of the days
clear out your things

156
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,681
But the secretarial board already
gave me a balloon

157
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,287
Keep te balloon if you wish

158
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:26,804
Why dont you come out sweetie i know
Brucer would not blame you

159
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,942
But i am all he speak for in this world

160
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,534
And i had completely fail him

161
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,310
You know what i thought
the first time i saw you

162
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,954
I thought that momont is really special

163
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,155
She believe she can make it
different and she will

164
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:55,190
So come on out lets talk about it

165
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:56,632
No

166
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,069
We could go over some wedding detail

Like breast feeding

192
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,185
And if i want to give a voice to Brucer

It is going to be fun

274
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,178
However the next time you consider

Committees had call the order

Welcome to the special committees

00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,899
Welcome to Wellington madam

278
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,114
You have a package

279
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,585
Inside the box is the most
perfect wedding shoe ever

280
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,087
I wouldn be able to wear them

281
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,427

283
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,263

284
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,065
Alle Woods

285
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,381
I hate that feeling

286
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,858
Whatever that means

287
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,252
I guess i better get going

288
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,524
If i had to pass a law i had to work

289
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,407
It is call the committees
of energy and commerce

290
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,207
Oh ya right

291
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,451
Thanks

292
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,857
This is really important

293
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,299
That means she only had one
free had for bingo night

294
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,194
Where is you bill Rina

295
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,673
The draft lawyer couldn
draft in six weeks

296
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,475
But if you would talk
to the congressman aid

297
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,375
I could at least put on an agenda

298
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,642
Beside there is a lot of issue
to come first

299
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,984
Maybe you could talk
to them yourself

300
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,719
Maybe directly to the congressman

301
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,490
In fact now that i think about it

302
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,761
With Rina clear passion
for the project

303
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,129
It is like what i always say

304
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,840
If you left someone else do for you,
you could do for yourself

305
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,451
Stick it out with the lawyer,
now get to yours eventually

306
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,015
Want to get hearing for your bill

307
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:42,166
If she could put her name
on something warm and fussy

308
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,297
ie something like

309
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:45,836
Puppy

310
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,138
That could do the trick -Really

311
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:52,206
What if i show them the photo what
are they doing for the animal

312
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,272
That would work

313
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:02,812
You got to do your home work

314
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,721
How do you know about all this

315
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,627
You work on the White House

316
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,029
No at the Wellington

317

useful person when i been on Washington

336
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,151
Time to get serious

337
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,512

When you think what
they do to the animal

343
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,572
Just i dont think about it

344
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,119
Looks great

345
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,988
When was the last time

346
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,875
I am sorry what did you

00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,343
What would i do without you

361
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,280
You are going to get this bill through

362
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,653
An honest voice is
louder than the crowd

363
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,193

As not what your best friend
can do for men,

406
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,294
but what you can do
for men's best friend.

407
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,302
The committee of hearing
come first to the order.

408
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:27,151
HR 2562, AKA, Bruiser's Bill.

409
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:32,885
Represent the Victoria Rudd of responder
proposing a band of animal testing.

410
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:37,290
I like to welcome you all at the began
consideration this very important issue.

411
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,097
This week, you were here an expert
testimony from both sides...

412
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,928
that I asked you to keep your ears...

413
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,763
and your minds open.

414
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,300
This is my first congratulate,
can you believe it?

415
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:53,877
As I come today as a citizen and a scientist
for the Nature Institute for 25 years.

416
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:58,814
It becoming increasingly clear this suppose
the alternative to animal testy.

417
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,577
Our alternative at all.

418
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:04,618
I'd like to this all that might
represent two considerations.

419
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:08,725
Precisely, I saw at a pets store with a label...

420
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,250
"This part is part is testing on human".

421
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:13,689
Now, that's the problem we're discussing.

422
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:21,038
We try to discuss for the facts...

423
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:28,774
the sacker and tucker wide calls noses other
sentimental mumble jumble consider this.

424
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,907
What we see sacker is a part.

425
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,116
We are can see sacker so mind...

426
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,518
and so to move on such a bill
at this junction of time we having...

427
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,885
at already unstable local economic
across the country.

428
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,555
Now, that? The problem we're discussing.

429
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,265
You know I'll do anything for you,

430
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:51,435
but I got to tell you now, that is one tough
room, you got to be prepare more.

431
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,035
Alright.

432
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,670
Excuse me, ladies, I have to go.
Good evening.

433
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:54,796
Ok.

434
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,843
I know you have bad day in court,
for the same thing...

435
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,970
they made their case, we made ours.

436
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,840
That was bad.

437
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:10,754
I think we have the both uncommitted
even without your testimony.

438
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:13,314
But they have scientist
at the court to listen.

439
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,756
So, do we?

440
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,587
Elle, listen to me.

441
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:21,261
Go home. Have a early evening.

442
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:22,889
Sorry.

443
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,628
Victoria Rudd., yes...

444
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,200
Oh, hang on a minute, would you?

445
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,571
Go home, try to relax.

446
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:35,374
And don't think like them,
think like you.

447
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,382
Ok. Thanks.

448
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,247
- Good night.
- Go night.

449
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,946
Bob, how are you?

450
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,629
Thanks, nice work.

451
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:53,960
Alright.

452
00:48:59,069 --> 00:48:59,770
Sac?

453
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,473
Oh, here, I'm sorry about that,
this happen all the time.

454
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:08,240
My break is almost up, but I want to
get you this before tomorrow.

455
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,639
Oh, great, lets walk.

456
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,611
How did you know all these?

457
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,552
100 of dogs walk,
- 1000 of plastic bags.

458
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:22,256
This is perfect;
this is exactly what I need.

459
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:28,657
Of course I appreciate your support,
why won't you continue?

460
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:40,710
Alright. I'll do what I can.

461
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,075
Don't push me, Bob.

462
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,079
I don't care.

463
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,613
Alright, good night.

464
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:55,258
Listen, I need to call my favor.

465
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:55,993
I'm listening.

466
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,985
I've changed my position
on Bruiser's Bill.

467
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,370
He is good. He is really good.

468
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,635
I? Really glad we're watching this.
This is good for you.

469
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,038
Kenneth, I'm starting to worry about how
may get all this wedding planning done...

470
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:17,705
Elle, I want you to follow
my lead in Washington.

471
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,909
And always make sure Bruiser
will wear the sweater.

472
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,419
Is that child cindering?

473
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,148
No, that's not child cindering.

474
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:26,723
Seriously, honey.

475
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:28,792
Don't worry about
the wedding research.

476
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:31,022
Just give them hell tomorrow.

477
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,335
The chairs are now recognize
the Elle Woods.

478
00:50:58,321 --> 00:50:59,754
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

485
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:24,414
Yes. Yes, but how did you...

486
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:28,685
What if I told, Represent Kroft that you owe
the special bound in your steps...

487
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,449

00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:34,156
To the pain and suffering
at innocent animals.

00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,370
Bruiser.

494
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:59,106
How much time to the act
on my behave... helpless.

495
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:03,211
But today, I did the opportunity
to speak for him.

496
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,380
Who do you speak for?

497
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,860
Mr. Fued.

498
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,870
The next time when you reach for
your over night moisturizing gloss,

499
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,271
by the way, its nothing to be ashamed
for men to use them.

500
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:27,802
Consider asking yourself,
would you willing to scarify...

501
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:30,606
in a name of beauty and soft cubicle.

502
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,574
Are you willing to
scarify animal welfare?

503
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,851
Or how about, just say the
welfare when animal...

504
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,755
like Jerry.

505
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:42,885
Your child with pals, that striking
retrieve the black classmates.

506
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,932
You know about Jerry?

507
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:51,833
When all the other children refuse
to play the with you,

508
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,334
who was that always your tender?

509
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,431
Jerry Billy.

510
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,076
Mr. Chairman,

511
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:14,557
when you look at those steps with
the torment dies on your Rock Leslie.

512
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,683
Did this not make your
heart grow with warm?

513
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,329
To respect Ms. Wood,
I won't go that far.

514
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:25,135
He learns that between seven different kinds
of pipes and fetch each one on comment.

515
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:29,003
Do you not swear to protect him
with every shot gun in your...

516
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,174
termining animation case?

517
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,945
It won't come with that, this is a dog we're
talking about. Leslie is a dog.

518
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:41,550
But, if you could speak for Leslie,
what would you say?

519
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:50,088
What will Leslie want you to say
for him, Mr. Chairman?

520
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:56,726
Say.

521
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,039
Oh, here it is.

522
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:13,245
My Rock Leslie is
a homosexual imitation,

523
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:16,015
then I'll say, "I'm out."

524
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,217
And my dog is gay.

525
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,025
And guess what?

526
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,255
I couldn? Be part of the little play.

527
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:31,735
I don? Care how good my hands goes slick
back some high dollars for me,

528
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:36,866
just one down stair,
into that sneaks sissy dog that I know.

529
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,270
No cosmetic could ever be with it.

530
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,473
Bruiser's Bill.

531
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,842
Bruiser's Bill.

532
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,978
Bruiser's Bill.

533
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:51,421
We did it.

534
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,048
Bruiser's Bill.

535
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,795
Hey, Bruiser, you worth with that.

536
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:18,481
I would like to conclude this hearing by
thanking you all with testimony...

537
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,244
Mr. Chairman.

538
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,986
The Chairs had recognized
the general law of restitution.

539
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,216
Mr. Chairman, committee members,

540
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,719
I would like to thank you for
your consideration of this bill.

541
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:34,693
However after further reflection on this
budget reality in this whole years,

542
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:38,458
I feel I must draw my support
for Bruiser's Bill.

543
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:39,624
What?

544
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,379
Everybody calm down.

545
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,419
I'm sorry, Bruiser.

546
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,229
I'm sorry too, Elle.

547
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,169
I know you think I let you down.

548
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:18,505
Believe me, I thought about your reaction
maybe more than I should have.

549
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,403
By Grace.

550
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:25,982
Grace?

551
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:30,282
The last two section, she's been pushing
this homoner intensive bills.

552
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,548
This morning, she struck the deal.

553
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:40,697
I was draw my support for Bruiser's Bill;
homoner intensive comes to a vote.

554
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,699
That was the price and I paid it.

555
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:46,931
That's not a deal and trace and secrets.

556
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,136
That's not people wants.

557
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:05,251
Elle. I'm sorry.

558
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,521
So, what's your story?

559
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,287
You even honest?

560
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,124
I guess you were.

561
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:00,970
He doesn? Play games and
I think you're the only one.

562
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:06,344
This is how you did it.

563
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:12,251
And I even that was happy,
that was really brave...

564
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:15,986
To trusting you actually

565
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,088
Trusting this system.

566
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:23,830
Trusting yourself.

567
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,196
I did.

568
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,383
Go on.

569
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:31,663
We even put the hearts over the eyes.

570
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:33,892
That? My idea.

571
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,372
Thank you everybody, this is really nice.

572
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,545
But, I... this can? Help for this.

573
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:45,412
We have a plan, to vote for you.

574
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,719
How about 100 of signature
we can spring Bruiser's Bill...

575
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,552
from committee straight
to the house for the vote.

576
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:56,352
I don? Know that,
sounds really complicated.

577
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:57,961
You can part with any of us.

578
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:01,419
That long maintaining your sparker,
we never sparker.

579
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:06,459
It means, in anyone of us one person
can make a different until you get on.

580
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:12,172
Its not really 218 signatures?

581
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:14,438
It? Not that hard.

582
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:17,468
Yeah.

583
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:23,615
I guess I know more shift with that.

584
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,310
Well, that's me.

585
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,785
Elle, is time to finish where you started.

586

financial perform hearing.

588
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:46,669

589
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,171

590
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:58,788

Ok, we have 2 signatures,

608

01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,094
If it works for you,
I've been painting my own poster.

655
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,472
I don? Care she have 2 weeks left.

656
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:52,703
She can have 2 years left.
She is not gonad pull this off.

657
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:58,103
I will not be out lose
by this silly little blonde.

658
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,109
Don't worry, Bob, I'll get her.

659
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,680
And the little dog, too.

660
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:12,028
Even the entire willing to 62 like changing
hair cut, that will so not even close.

661
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,495
We get a problem here.

662
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,629
The bad news is...

663
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:18,965
Renna...

664
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:32,504
Wow, you, you look amazing.

665
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:37,379
Its just Elle's highlight
so it will finishing roles.

666
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,086
I did it.

667
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:41,123
Cool.

668
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:42,725
Ok, so, what is bad news?

669
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,560
We just lost Hanner Feld

670
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,431
The problem is, we were planning him to bring
Joson, Paul and Jennal with unboard.

671
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:49,298
What you talking about?

672
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:52,790
I talked to him by myself that I confirm
to him this morning in the breakfast.

673
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:56,233
Well, I don? Know,
somebody must get to the lunch.

674
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:58,641
Its Grace.

675
01:07:58,641 --> 01:07:59,869
- Just make sure. - I will.

676
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,174
I'm looking for Grace Foster.

677
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:05,548
I just want to know if she's coming back
for lunch soon, because...

678
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:08,384
Elle, hi.

679
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,351
Oh, hi.

680
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,875
I was just gonad call you.

681
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:14,219
I was looking for Grace.

682
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:16,425
The discharge petition.

683
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:17,693
Yeah, we intended to fail,

684
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:20,423
and I was just wondering Grace
know anything about it.

685
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:22,664
Now that isn't important anymore.

686
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,994
Could I speak with you for a moment?

687
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:26,525
Sure.

688
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,478
You did it now.

689
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:36,545
You won.

690
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:39,215
You can collect Bruiser's mum
anytime you like.

691
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:40,182
What?

692
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:43,319
Well, if you promise not to be disappointed
in me again,

693
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,618
I'll tell you I've pulled a few strings...

694
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:51,124
said Manifest, is releasing all
of the tested animals.

695
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,628
All of them?

696
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:53,595
All of them.

697
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:54,763
And what's more,

698
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:58,494
they have been so impress on
how you handle yourself down here.

699
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:02,331
They want you to come on aboard
and head to legal department.

700
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:04,373
Its a very general offer now.

701
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:06,273
I don? Know.

702
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:10,608
You did it. You did what
you came here for do.

703
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,315
But what about the discharge petition?

704
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,485
I mean its just about just want it
at most but all demo.

705
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:21,257
I agree. But you got a great dement place
that can carry on without you,

706
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,987
same magnify when you up
there by Monday.

707
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,152
You can go home.

708
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:29,931
Congratulation, Elle.

709
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:31,465
Wow, thank you.

710
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:40,675
We have to stick together,
Washington blonde.

711
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:45,507
Do you haven? Know the representer Hanner that
have lunch today at members dining room?

712
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,451
I skipped lunch today. Have a facial.

713
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:54,555
Ok. Alright, thanks. I'll call you back.

714
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:56,291
Yeah.

715
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:10,139
Emend, I know you probably
in case lock last week now,

716
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:12,733
but I want you to call me back
when you get this.

717
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:15,177
I think I'm coming home.

718
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:18,305
But it? A good thing now, maybe.

719
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,779
Call me back.

720
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,624
Would you leave us alone now?

721
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:35,964
Excuse me?

722
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,866
Look, I know you've been
working against us.

723
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:39,561
And I know some how personal.

724
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:40,836
You don? Like me.

725
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:42,531
Clearly.

726
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:50,239
Your bill is trivial to me,
I have my origin.

727
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,651
You know, that's only asking,
Grace...

728
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:59,088
Homoner Intensive?
I didn't touch that bill.

729
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,648
Its the tax fight for the wealthy.

730
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,761
Haven't you been pushing it
in the last two section?

731
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:09,458
Look, Victoria had a live interview
with Coney Chance an hour.

732
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,190
I don? Have time for this.

733
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:14,303
With that interview, she is preparing for?

734
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,100
She's a make up right now.

735
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,841
She's a make up?

736
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,709
Test, 1, 2, 3.

737
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:25,047
Is Ms Chan is available, I'd like to go over
some ground rows before we go on.

738
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,947
Thank you.

739
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,249
Ok. Thanks.

740
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,455
Doesn't she have beautiful complexion?

741
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,582
She's like a PSA for SPS.

742
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,415
Oh, thank you, Elle. I though you're gone.

743
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:40,562
Oh, home? No, no, I'm not ready yet.

744
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,264
I've been dumber speaking on this.

745
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,466
I mean actually feeling a little bit mardy.

746
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,536
I thought I need a light spoliation
and hyper separation...

747
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:50,506
I thought Victoria will have
a good recommendatin for me.

748
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:52,574
Surely, this isn? A best time.

749
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:54,510
No, no, I know you? E very busy, so...

750
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,375
I already called your facilist,

751
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:58,911
but the thing is, she said
you didn't come in today.

752
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,651
Oh, no, no, I went some place else.
Some place new.

753
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:03,719
Is that all?

754
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,277
No, that's not all.

755
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:09,919
Every woman knows that a good facial can be
painful experience done probably.

756
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,219
Likely the result and let loch areas is
all over your skin,

757
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,125
swelling paining your teeth and particular...

758
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:20,436
even more, so facialist pending
so many of the best stars...

759
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:22,734
payback for the fall, commonly
that's what I like to say.

760
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:24,673
What are you talking about?

761
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,876
Isn't that's the first rule of the facial that
there is 24 hours window between...

762
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:32,147
facial and any major occasion,
such as save a day of dancer...

763
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:34,547
or maybe an interview
with Ms Polly Brovich?

764
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:38,844
I don't think that's a rule that a Washington
woman can easily forget.

765
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:41,123
This is ridiculous, can we clear this room?

766
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:43,614
You lie me about your lunch hour, why?

767
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,626
Because you? E having lunch
with Hanner Feld?

768
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:49,231
You turn on me against for all these time,
haven't you?

769
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:51,033
For god sake. Enough, that's enough.

770
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:54,370
Thank you. Out.

771
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,305
Thank you, I'll be with you at the moment.

772
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:04,947
Yes. I lied to you, I killed Bruiser's Bill.

773
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:08,484
You're animal lover, what about
Donny Medision, your dog?

774
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:10,179
It? Not mine, I brought it.

775
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:16,125
Elle, we've been through all of these before.

776
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:20,118
I treated your bill for the Homoner's bill
that Grace set committee me too.

777
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:21,594
That's a lie.

778
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,165
Grace never want in that.

779
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:26,335
You locked this bill, nobody else.
And I wanna know why.

780
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:27,936
- Why? - Yes, why?

781
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:31,206
Why this anything ever happened
in Washington survival,

782
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:34,607
you have no idea what it takes to
get you to stay here.

783
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,178
The money you take.

784
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:43,318
So happen my chief financial contributors have
to poachers in a major cosmetic company.

785
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:46,719
And they want to continue testing on animals.

786
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:50,726
So much so that they willing want to bankrupt
my potent and just selection...

787
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:53,718
if I did not kill your bill.

788
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:55,921
I trusted you.

789
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,157
I looked up to you.

790
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,638
I can't do anyone any good
if I'm no longer here.

791
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:05,334
But you? E not doing anybody any good.

792
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:08,338
Nobody, not even yourself.

793
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,880
And I'm sorry that I can't let that happen.

794
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:20,547
You can't proof how I change my vote
or how I locked your bill.

795
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,424
If you work against mine,

796
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:26,793
and I've spend 20 years building up my credit
ability in this town and back home.

797
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:28,957
I'm not gonad go with the press.

798
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,362
I don't believe in black mail.

799
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:36,067
That I do believe in people,
and I gonad take Bruiser's bill to them.

800
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:39,007
The people believe what
we tell them to believe.

801
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:40,542
It will never work out.

802
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:43,272
You can't get the people to care.

803
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,681
Watch me.

804
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:09,696
Ladies, its time.

805
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:13,897
You mean...

806
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,802
Are you sure?

807
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,148
Are you with me?

808
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:23,982
I think so.

809
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:25,914
Celina?

810
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:31,822
Yeah. Yes. We'll with you.

811
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:34,793

Grace?

856
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,819
You have to take something extra,

857
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:28,748
you have to push something no regular
citizens react for dream.

I know just a person who make it happen.

863
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:53,505

I want to do some good.

Why you want to do with me?

866
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:07,361
Those silly girls that I told you
about the blessed on your feet,

867
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:10,055

01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:26,374
Don't think about it.

871
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:28,977
And now...

872
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:34,617
It? A little unconventional.

873
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:40,227

the president permission,

874

About a piece of registration
called Bruiser's Bill.

884
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:10,484
You know? Today is suppose
to be bi-education.

885
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:18,226
I want to tell you the education that you all
have giving me in the pass three months.

886
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:20,195
What about Bruiser's Bill,
we still need 15 signatures?

887
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:21,196
She's blowing it.

888
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:24,632
Se, one day I came to Washington
to help my dog Bruiser...

889
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,498
some where along the way I learnt really...

890
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:30,227
unexpected lesson.

891
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:34,436
Anyone of you thinking, who is this girl?

892
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:39,536
And what is this simple small town grow girl
from L.A. has to save all that?

893
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:41,940
Well, I'll tell you.

894
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,746
Its about something that bigger that me.

895
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:55,024
This is about the matter that should be the
highest important to every American.

896
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:58,489
My hair.

897
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:03,497
You see, this is a salon in Beverly Hill.

898
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:06,872
Its really fancy and beautiful.

899
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:10,779
But its impossible to get in there, I mean
I'm not Julia Robert or one of the girls...

900
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:12,679
so, you just forget it.

901
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:15,315
But, one day, they called me.

902
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:21,450
So, I was finally get the chance to sit
on one of the beauty chairs.

903
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:23,281
I was so excited.

904
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:37,438
The shampoo girl washed my hair with color
intensive moisturizing conditioning shampoo.

905
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:49,480
Suppose to say, it was just wrong.

906
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,179
All wrong.

907
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:53,080
For me. You know?

908
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:55,817
First, I was angry.

909
01:24:55,924 --> 01:25:01,463
I never realize my anger
was completely distracted,

910
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:06,298
I had sat there and witnesses,
and I just let it happened.

911
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:09,565
I didn't get involve in the process.

912
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:13,039
I forgot to use my voice.

913
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:17,403
I forgot to believe in myself.

914
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:20,481
But now, I know better.

915
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:26,109
I know that one honest voice
can be a liar than a crown.

916
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:31,893
I know that if we lose our voice,

917
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:35,192
or we let those who speak
on our behave...

918
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:37,722
compromise our voice.

919
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:45,495
This country, this country is fall
on a really bad hair cut.

920
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:52,043
So, speak up, America.

933
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:19,893
Bowing to public pressure, test animals
across the country were released...

934
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:43,485
You did it. Thank you.

935
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:47,052
Paulette finally got her hot dog.

936
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:54,035
Her husband delivered Fenway Parks
home plate to Washington.
