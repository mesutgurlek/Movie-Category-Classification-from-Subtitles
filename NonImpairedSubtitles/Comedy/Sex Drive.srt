Hello, my name is Sean Anders.
Screenwriter and director of <i>Sex Drive.</i>

2
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:13,551
Hi, John. I didn't see you there.

3
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:18,462
- This is John Morris.
- Screenwriter and producer of <i>Sex Drive.</i>

4
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:21,365
- Welcome to the unrated...
- Uncircumcised...

5
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:22,732
...edition of...

6
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:24,703
<i>...Sex Drive.</i>
<i>- Sex Drive.</i>

7
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:27,262
How many times has this happened to you?

8
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:31,675
You purchase an unrated DVD to view
with your friends. Only with your friends...

9
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:35,875
Only to find that you got the same
old movie with a few extra curse words,

10
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,247
and maybe an additional tit or two.

11
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:40,377
- What a jip.
- And how...

12
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:41,785
Not this time.

13
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:46,019
That's right, John.
On this unrated DVD we promise you,

14
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:47,424
the viewer,

15
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:52,454
a genuinely wacky, zany
and unrated viewing experience.

16
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:55,433
- We promise...
- Plus, we promise more tits.

17
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:57,766
Bare tits like these.

18
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:01,337
These tits are good.

19
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:05,311
Plus, more cock, like this.

20
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,346
That's good cock, John.

21
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:13,082
That's right, John, and that's not all,
we promise lots of additional scenes,

22
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:17,487
takes and other bullshit
that will make the movie way too long.

23
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:20,321
And this means a lower standard
of filmmaking for you,

24
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:21,383
- the viewer.
- The viewer.

25
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:26,156
So, if you've never seen <i>Sex Drive</i> before,
please, for real,

26
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,701
do not watch this version first.

27
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:32,500
Watch the real theatrical version
and then come back and watch this one.

28
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:33,664
Why?

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,302
Yes, because this version
of the movie is going to suck.

30
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:49,378
Sorry, but I couldn't help but notice you.
I have this exact same tribal tattoo.

31
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:51,424
Mine's one my... It's on my back.

Looks like you had a long, nasty night.

Darren and I already discussed them,
and he said he'd pay for it.

Oh, no. I was just hoping
you could slit my wrists for me quickly.

Please don't take this the wrong way,

it's just coming across as needy,
you know?

your mom's still bat-shit crazy.

What? You're telling me
she doesn't shit-talk me?

No, actually, she doesn't. She doesn't, ever.

198

All right. Let me give you some advice,
Lance, all right?

Don't ever get married.
Just an endless parade of horseshit.

- Yeah, really. We're good at it.

- Yeah. I didn't mean to undersell it,

but it's an impressive thing.

933
00:59:15,832 --> 00:59:17,663

- Wow, that'd be cool.

I might be the coolest guy you ever met.

01:30:34,642 --> 01:30:37,475
His heart was breaking
for this poor little thing.

1366
01:30:37,712 --> 01:30:42,411
Shit, that boy lan don't seem
like he got no balls at all.

1367
01:30:42,484 --> 01:30:46,284
Why? 'Cause he got to fussing some
over a suffering critter?

1368
01:30:46,755 --> 01:30:48,780
I think that's real sweet.

1369
01:30:48,857 --> 01:30:52,122
Well, I say this Lance,
he sounds like a real hunk of man.

1370
01:30:52,627 --> 01:30:56,222
The only way you can keep his kind around
is to get his babies up in you pronto.

1371
01:30:56,297 --> 01:30:58,731
But he got no respect for bitches.

1372
01:30:59,567 --> 01:31:04,266
Shathayd's right. No respect for bitches.
None whatsoever.

1373
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:07,941
You love lan, don't you, baby?

1374
01:31:11,012 --> 01:31:15,574
Well, it's just we've been best friends
since we were really little,

1375
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:19,542
and I don't know, he's the only person
I can really talk to, you know?

1376
01:31:19,854 --> 01:31:22,414
You give your heart to that boy,

1377
01:31:22,490 --> 01:31:27,860
and you can toss that "friendship" right out
the motherfucking window.

1378
01:31:27,929 --> 01:31:33,526
When I was a girl, my best friend was
a fella named Creighton McDaniel.

1379
01:31:34,502 --> 01:31:40,065
We used to stay up all night just talking
and laughing and carrying on.

1380
01:31:41,276 --> 01:31:45,975
Then one day I got it into my head
that we ought to be more than friends.

1381
01:31:46,047 --> 01:31:48,379
So I tell him I love him.

1382
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:50,407
What happened?

1383
01:31:53,555 --> 01:31:55,250
We dated for a few weeks.

(FARTING)

1385
01:31:56,424 --> 01:31:58,824
Then he met a gal over in Wofford.

1386
01:32:00,195 --> 01:32:02,527
We still talk from time to time.

1387
01:32:03,698 --> 01:32:06,223

1388

01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:19,844

1390
01:32:21,783 --> 01:32:25,150

1391

1405

1407
01:33:12,934 --> 01:33:16,199
Yeah, well, that's out.
I was supposed to meet her two hours ago.

1408
01:33:17,438 --> 01:33:19,303
Dude, when we get out of here,
just tell her you got pinched.

1409

talking about earlier,

1417

I don't give a shit what Denise says,

1418
01:33:44,365 --> 01:33:46,959
I think there's still room for somebody
to write the great American novel.

1419
01:33:47,035 --> 01:33:50,061

- Are you okay? Why are you in jail?

1426
01:34:20,468 --> 01:34:21,457
I mean, there's a number of charges,

1427
01:34:21,536 --> 01:34:23,731
but the most prominent ones
were animal cruelty

1428
01:34:23,805 --> 01:34:25,864
and the assaulting the officer.

02:03:14,467 --> 02:03:16,230
- A pleasure.
- Yeah, thanks for fixing our bus.

1817
02:03:16,302 --> 02:03:18,702
- Appreciate it.
- Thanks for playing that show for us, too.

1818
02:03:18,771 --> 02:03:22,104
- Yeah, no worries.
- It was a nice five-song set.

1819
02:03:22,175 --> 02:03:24,575
Yeah, what do you guys typically...

1820
02:03:24,644 --> 02:03:27,078
I assume you get compensated
very well for that.

1821
02:03:27,146 --> 02:03:30,047
- Must be a good living.
- Yeah, we do. I mean...

1822
02:03:30,116 --> 02:03:33,017
Yeah, you know, I...
Gosh, if I was really to calculate

1823
02:03:33,086 --> 02:03:36,214
what you'd lose if this bus
couldn't have gotten back on the road,

1824
02:03:36,289 --> 02:03:37,483
if you couldn't have gotten to your shows,

1825
02:03:37,557 --> 02:03:42,426
I imagine all those weeping teenage girls
outside, "I need to dance."

1826
02:03:42,495 --> 02:03:45,464
Could we send you some pictures?
We don't really have cash or anything.

1827
02:03:45,531 --> 02:03:48,500
- Some autographed photos?
- Or we could give you CDs.

1828
02:03:48,568 --> 02:03:50,798
Yeah, we've got a lot of use
for that around here.

1829
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:52,963
There is a lot of work
that needs to be done around here.

1830
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:57,305
- You guys are some strapping young lads.
- I don't know if we're really built for that.

1831
02:03:58,745 --> 02:04:01,270
- Yeah.
- I can hear you.

1832
02:04:01,347 --> 02:04:03,747
I'm just saying,
you guys put in a 20-minute show,

1833
02:04:03,816 --> 02:04:05,443
- we spent all night on the bus...
- Yeah.

1834
02:04:05,518 --> 02:04:06,712
I mean, that was a lot of work.

1835
02:04:06,786 --> 02:04:08,981
We could maybe try
to write a check later on,

1836
02:04:09,055 --> 02:04:11,523
or like I said,
we could send you guys some CDs.

1837
02:04:11,591 --> 02:04:13,821
City folk are always trying to solve things
with money.

1838
02:04:13,893 --> 02:04:15,918
It's the spirit of the community
around here.

1839
02:04:15,995 --> 02:04:18,520
Lord, please bless this Fall Out Boy.

1840
02:04:18,598 --> 02:04:21,362
Keep him safe on the road.

1841
02:04:21,434 --> 02:04:24,528
Help him to aspire
to the heights of Jon Bon Jovi.

1842
02:04:24,604 --> 02:04:25,832
- Help him to...
- Thanks.

1843
02:04:25,905 --> 02:04:27,805
- Okay, thanks, man.
- Thanks, man. We gotta roll.

1844
02:04:27,874 --> 02:04:29,808
- Amen.
- We gotta roll, man. Thank you very much.

1845
02:04:29,876 --> 02:04:31,434
All right, boys.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

1846
02:04:31,511 --> 02:04:34,480
I loved your penis on the Internet,
by the way.

1847
02:04:34,547 --> 02:04:36,606
- Fucking asshole!
- You're a dick!

1848

Hi. I'm Amanda Crew, professional actor.

1902
02:09:05,551 --> 02:09:07,883
You know in all the teen unrated DVDs,

1903
02:09:07,953 --> 02:09:11,514
you never really get to see
the star's naughty parts.

1904
02:09:11,991 --> 02:09:15,427
Well, that is gonna change today.

1905
02:09:15,494 --> 02:09:17,394
That's right. Take a seat,

1906
02:09:17,463 --> 02:09:20,296
maybe close the door
so mom doesn't come in.

1907
02:09:20,366 --> 02:09:23,267
Get all ready. Looks good.

1908
02:09:24,670 --> 02:09:26,001
Here we go.

1909
02:09:29,742 --> 02:09:31,232
Suckers!

1910
02:09:32,878 --> 02:09:34,175
This is serious matter.

1911
02:09:35,281 --> 02:09:36,441
Run for your life.

1912
02:09:36,515 --> 02:09:39,109
MAN 1: Oh, shit! You know what?
We see the fake balls on the table there.

1913
02:09:39,185 --> 02:09:40,209
(ALL LAUGHING)

1914
02:09:40,286 --> 02:09:43,016
MAN 2: All right. We'll shoot another. Cut.
MAN 3: Cut.
