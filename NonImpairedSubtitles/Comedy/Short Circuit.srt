1
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,145
Enemy neutralized, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:31,939
Objective completed.

3
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,360
- Very nice.
- Yes, very nice.

4
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,744
Introducing your host, Dr Howard Marner.

5
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:47,829
President of Nova Robotics

6
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,468
Well, ladies and gentlemen

7
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,315
I want you to meet strategic artificially
intelligent nuclear transport

8
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,777
Or SAINT, as we call it.

9
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,611
If a question of survival,
then SAINT is the answer

10
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,749
It is quite simply, the most
sophisticated robot on planet Earth.

11
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:40,841
Adaptable to steaming jungle and burning
deserts and frozen arctic wastes

12
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,385
Well, of course it's adaptable
because it's a robot.

13
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,546
Therefore, impervious to...

14
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,851
- the ravages of nature.
- Crush ice.

15
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,067
Glass. Ice.

16
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,611
Gin.

17
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,197
Tonic.

18
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,492
A squeeze of lime.

19
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,625
- Your cocktail, Dr. Marner.
- Thank you, Number 2.

20
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,047
Just the way I like it...

21
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:23,133
shaken, but not stirred.

22
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,096
Oh my...

23
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,097
Well...

24
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,560
One thing we can't control is the weather. The
man upstairs is still in charge of that department.

25
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:38,732
So, why don't we just move our
little presentation back into the lab?

26
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,760
- Oh, and one more thing Dr. Marner.
- Yes, Senator Mills.

27
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,888
Where's the young man
that actually designed these things?

28
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,338
- Dr. Crosby?
- Yes.

29
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,058
We were told we would be meeting with him.

30
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,335
And so you shall.

31
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:15,509
- When?
- Soon.

32
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,521
Maybe not today, but soon.

33
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:19,481
- Why not today?
- Flu.

34
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:23,944
I'd feel happier about approving this
project if I could speak with him.

35
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,436
I'll see what I can do.

36
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,449
Would you excuse me for just...
I'll be back in just a second.

37
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:34,329
Norman, bolt up the motion control system please.
Don't forget that. It's very important.

38
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:36,107
Where is he?

39
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,833
I need him.

40
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:38,615
Stat!

41
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,668
Excuse me sir.

42
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,130
Crosby... he is hiding in the toilet, sir.

43
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:45,288
Public relations is everybody's job.

44
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,614
Well he is sitting at the cross
they are making him dog sick, sir.

45
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,889
Look. He's supposed to be here.
I want him here. I pay him to be here.

46
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:55,017
Well, the last time I am seeing him,
he is busy vomiting, sir.

47
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,978
Well, clean him up and
send him out to hob nob.

48
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,354
Stat!

49
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:12,409
Newton, come on, hurry up.
They are waiting for you.

50
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,749
Newton Crosby. You must make
instantaneous appearance.

51
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,031
Marner says "Stat".

52
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,212
You have to go
hob nob with the big wigs.

53
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,549
Is that a yes or the number
of your intelligence quotient?

54
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:28,957
Ben, I don't hob nob.

55
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,637
If you you like all that P.R. crap,
why don't you go hob nob.

56
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,879
Mingle with the brass. Have a ball.

57
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:37,267
I am sick of wearing
the dress in this family.

58
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:44,066
Crosby, now don't you hang up on me. I know
you're there. I want you up here right away!

59
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:46,725
Come on Newton! Swallow
your guts. You can do it.

60
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,613
Show them that you're a hot shot
fun guy underneath your clothes.

61
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:50,937
Now, what do they need me for?

62
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,159
To tell them each robot costs
10 million dollars and it kills people?

63
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:55,786
Ben, a child of four can tell them that.

64
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:57,194
That is why they are needing you.

65
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,571
- Now come on. Hurry up!
- Just one dance.

66
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,708
Now, I have to go to the jack.
So you wait for me.

67
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,709
The "john."

68
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,744
Oh, ya, you're doing real good.

69
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:09,424
- Just keep working on those last two bars.
- Let us go!

70
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,388
Coming through, please.

71
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:19,351
Wine coolers. Perier, Long Island ice tea.

72
00:09:19,403 --> 00:09:20,727
Please take a drink.

73
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,844
...he's putting on a tie.

74
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,190
He's going to tell you about
these peace time uses.

75
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:27,343
It's got plenty of peace time uses.

76
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:29,444
You mean besides serving gin and tonic?

77
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,740
The only way to secure the peace,
Senator, and I'm sure you know...

78
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,607
is be prepared. See...

79
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:39,288
We can parachute these robot guys
behind enemy lines.

80
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,863
They hide out till
the first strike blows over.

81
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,043
Then, each one of these little boogers
carries a 25 megaton bomb

82
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:49,798
right up the middle main street of Moscow.
Like the mail man bringing bad news.

83
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,500
We call it "Operation Gotcha Last".

84
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,680
- That's what you call insuring peace.
- Oh, ya...

85
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:57,556
just...

86
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:01,310
We're all thinking the same way. Would you
like to see our control center, Senator?

87
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:11,028
Hey, Norman. You better get
number 5 off that generator, man.

88
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,156
OK, OK, I'll get to it.

89
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,625
Run, Jim!

90
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,886
Jesus H God!

91
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,971
What the hell happened?

92
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,973
I don't know.

93
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,935
Oh my God! It's fried.

94
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,316
Oh! We're in deep shit now, man.

95
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,808
I hope got a few million bucks.

96
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,988
Because that's what they're going
to charge us if this think is fried.

97
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,324
- Everything checks out.
- What?

98
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,994
It's amazing.
Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.

99
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:06,375
OK, robots. Verbal command. Access
code 29 report to disarming section.

100
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,087
Get out of here, you little crap bucket!

101
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,213
Go on!

102
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,740
It's the ultimate soldier.

103
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,316
Obeys orders, never asks questions.

104
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,954
Originally, I had non-military
purposes in mind.

105
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:46,415
I designed it as a marital aid.

106
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,169
Very funny.

107
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,035
No...

108
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,257
I'm sure we'll all agree that
Dr. Crosby has designed a weapon...

109
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:57,994
that will keep our world safe
for all time.

110
00:11:58,046 --> 00:12:00,679
Howard, what's so safe
about blowing people up?

111
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:14,234
Coffee service coming through.
Please watch your step.

112
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,737
Hot coffee.

113
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:24,286
Coffee service coming through.
Please watch your step.

114
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:07,204
Please serve yourselves.
Have a canopy. Shrimp toast. Caviar.

115
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,782
Pate, salmon moose, Cheese Whiz...

116
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:15,087
Ladies and gentlemen,
our prototypes are here.

117
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,726
I've only counted 4,
so tell me I've miscounted.

118
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:31,343
- Gag me with a fork, sir.
- What?

119
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,064
Number 5 left the debriefing station
and then it just disappeared.

120
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:35,806
Oh, God, not today!

121
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,193
- Alright, call security.
- I did, sir, stat.

122
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:40,779
Good, you did, great.
Just stay calm!

123
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,921
- How're you doing?
- Running late as usual.

124
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,101
I knew it. God damned garbage cans!

125
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:14,511
Garbage cans with guns.
Newfangled bullshit!

126
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,389
- Have you got anything stronger?
- I got trouble which I don't need.

127
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:21,069
Because my wife is home cooking a steak
which is going to be dried out when I get there.

128
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:24,615
I think we got it.
What is that right there?

129
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:29,244
- Coffee machine.
- You're right, that's what it is.

130
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,820
- It's a coffee machine.
- That's very good, Howard.

131
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,584
Now it is time to freeze this place,
seal the doors, slam the gates shut.

132
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,048
All right, good enough.

133
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,009
OK, here you go.

134
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,722
Main gate. Captain.

135
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,224
- Where did you disappear to?
- I was hob nobbing.

136
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,905
OK, OK come on over here quick.
Come on. Come on, quick.

137
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,616
The guys downstairs say that number
5 was hit by a huge power surge.

138
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:09,243
He should have shut down.
Did you try the return code?

139
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:10,661
Ya, no response.

140
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,633
This is very strange, he won't talk to me.

141
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:38,146
- You sure number 5 is operational?
- Ya, as far as I know.

142
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:40,232
- Check the list polling system.
- OK.

143
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:41,848
Let's try the emergency override.

144
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,610
This is bullshit. Just let me go get it.

145
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:46,770
Access code, 42721.

146
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:49,481
Access gained, number 5 standing by.

147
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,618
With that ease,
you've gotten him on your terminal.

148
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,619
You're just a fine kid.

149
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,080
Report your position.

150
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,585
Malfunction, need input.

151
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,129
What the hell's a need input for?

152
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,224
I don't know,
I guess it can't triangulate his position.

153
00:16:14,276 --> 00:16:15,340
That's a simple function.

154
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,395
Do you know how to triangulate
your position, Howard?

155
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:20,178
- No.
- Well, then, there you go.

156
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,190
I'm glad you think
this is all such a joke, Crosby.

157
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,151
Don't worry, Skroeder,
you're not going to miss a meal.

158
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:26,570
Just shut it down, pick it up.

159
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,566
Unable, malfunction.

160
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:34,828
How can it refuse to turn itself off?

161
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,027
Maybe it's pissed off.

162
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,988
It's a machine, Skroeder,
it doesn't get pissed off...

163
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,043
it doesn't get happy, it doesn't get sad,
it doesn't laugh at your jokes.

164
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:44,129
- It just runs programming.
- Usually runs programs.

165
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:48,165
Anybody try the homing device yet?

166
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,427
- No.
- Oh, come on you guys, use your heads!

167
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,555
It's probably right down the hall and...

168
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:56,183
Ah... Here it comes...
Here it comes...

169
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,352
And...

170
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,230
Bingo!

171
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:05,432
Good lord!
It is outside the fence!

172
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,819
Oh, and that is not
the worst of it, Dr. Marner.

173
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:10,489
Don't tell me its laser is still armed.

174
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,022
Bimbo!

175
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,450
Crosby, what's he going to do?

176
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:14,983
Howard, it's hard to say.

177
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,943
It's malfunctioning.
It might not do anything.

178
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:20,582
But it could decide to blow away
anything that moves. Couldn't it?

179
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:22,835
Couldn't it, Crosby?

180
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:45,274
Oh, my God. It's not coming back.
We've got to destroy it.

181
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:47,322
No. Howard, you're
overreacting. You can't...

182
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:49,319
Look, let us at least try to catch it first.

183
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:50,769
Ya, we'll panic later, OK?

184
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,782
What if you don't catch it. What if it goes
out and melts down a bus load of nuns...

185
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,160
How would you like to
write the headline on that one?

186
00:17:56,212 --> 00:17:58,120
- Nun soup?
- Ben!

187
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:00,487
- Howard.
- What?

188
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,417
OK, it's malfunctioning. Think about it.

189
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:06,243
- What about function?
- Alright, look...

190
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,005
Why don't you get your
team together and Skroeder,

191
00:18:08,057 --> 00:18:08,796
Duke, Otis!

192
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,924
- And detain number 5 the best you can...
- Alright, Howard.

193
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:13,093
- and still avoid an incident.
- I'm already moving.

194
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:14,094
And Skroeder,

195
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,888
You understand
you don't have to blow it up.

196
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,839
You don't have to blow it up, Skroeder.

197
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,800
Just try and bring it back in one piece.
- One piece will do.

198
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:26,148
Whatever it takes to put that stupid
contraption out of commission, gentlemen,

199
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,276
- that's what you do.
- Yes sir.

200
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,943
Give inertial status...

201
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:44,249
Let's scramble one, maybe it'll listen
to what comes with a decoder.

202
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:45,115
What is this?

203
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,033
Running diagnostics.
Testing its logic circuits.

204
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,380
Let's just bounce on off its magnesium
casing. What do you think, I don't know.

205
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:52,841
What is this? Input, Input, Input...

206
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,082
Come on...

207
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,844
Let's boot it up.
See if you can boot it.

208
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:59,728
Return to D-Station...
Come on. Now!

209
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,560
Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?

210
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,438
Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?

211
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,439
What is going on?

212
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,306
I don't know,
must be the print scanner...

213
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:13,070
- it must be reading it some place.
- I'm not understanding the reference

214
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,495
Need input.

215
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,456
Input.

216
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:56,029
- Did you see something?
- Oh God... I hope not.

217
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:58,949
- Well, I saw something.
- Ya, me too.

218
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:00,576
Oh shit!

219
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,561
It's right outside.
- Captain Skroeder, Captain Skroeder

220
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:09,293
<i>This is Bravo 4, over.
Skroeder, what have you got, over.</i>

221
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:13,380
He's right in front of us, sir, we're
on the bridge out on 101, over.

222
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:17,050
We're on our way.
Loose it and you're dead meat.

223
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,459
- It's going berserk.
- Ben, how'd this happen?

224
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:53,003
Who is knowing how to read
the mind of a robot?

225
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,966
Weeeeee!

226
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:31,239
I am not cut out for this!
You did this, Crosby...

227
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,168
- Howard!
- so you wouldn't have to talk to those people.

228
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,242
Just calm down.

229
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,839
Excuse me, sir, but we're loosing
its signal. It's going out of range.

230
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:38,408
We're going to have to follow it now.

231
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,873
Can I get a vehicle? Can I get...

232
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:43,262
- Howard, is there a van or anything like that?
- Of course there's a van!

233
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,191
Thanks for calling me, Mrs. Cepeda,
where's that son of a bitch?

234
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:59,486
He's around the bend and up
to no good, you better believe it.

235
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,324
Get the hell down here, Beasley!

236
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:07,109
- Hey!
- What are you doing home?

237
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:09,371
This is my home! It's not
your home. I live here.

238
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:11,023
What are you doing with Beasley?

239
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:12,572
Uh... well, darn it, you know

240
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,199
he looked kind of sick to me so I thought...

241
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,461
I'd just take him down to the vet
and fix him up a bit.

242
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:18,239
He doesn't look sick, you look sick.

243
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,913
What did you come back
here for anyway?

244
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:23,677
Well, to tell you the truth, I thought that
maybe we could patch things up.

245
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:26,388
Sort of pick up where we left off.

246
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,558
You know you want me back.

247
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,842
What is this?

248
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:34,104
Quinn's Medical Research? You slime bag!

249
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:35,679
The dog is on its last legs.

250
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,920
That's very funny. Why don't
you get the hell out of here!

251
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:40,110
You know what I figure?
I figure you owe me some money.

252
00:22:40,162 --> 00:22:41,904
- So I'm just here to collect.
- I owe you?

253
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:43,854
- That's right.
- I supported you.

254
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:47,534
That was my money you used
to buy your big red dorkmobile!

255
00:22:47,586 --> 00:22:48,994
No! Damn it!

256
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,538
Hey! Hey!

257
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:57,169
- Do not do that car!
- Get away from me!

258
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:03,050
Alright. If this is your idea of playing
hard to get, you can knock it off now.

259
00:23:03,102 --> 00:23:04,624
You mutation!

260
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:07,804
- God damn it! Don't ever call me that!
- You don't even know what it means!

261
00:23:07,856 --> 00:23:09,765
Ya, well, I can find out!

262
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,810
Hey! You! You leave her alone!

263
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,546
- Oh, God!
- Oh honey!

264
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:22,476
- Are you OK, honey?
- Ya.

265
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:24,561
- Are you sure?
- Ya, I'm fine.

266
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,198
And I thought he
was going to be a nice one.

267
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,731
- Different from the other ones.
- Ya right!

268
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:31,537
- Well, he sure was better looking.
- Well, looks aren't everything.

269
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:35,207
I know that.
Every time I look at Mr. Cepeda.

270
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:37,866
Honey, listen,
I hate to tell you this but a...

271
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,796
the man from the city...
he was snooping around again.

272
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:42,496
I told them all this was temporary.

273
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,581
It's just until I can find homes for them.

274
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,969
Well, he says that four years
is not too temporary.

275
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:48,178
He was going to call the sheriff on you.

276
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,294
Oh, great!

277
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:52,161
Maybe the sheriff would like a pet?

278
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:55,179
Beasley. Beasley come to me, baby.

279
00:23:55,231 --> 00:23:58,094
Good Beasley!
Beasley, come here.

280
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,440
Did he scare you?
Did he scare you, honey?

281
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:01,431
I'm sorry.

282
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,903
I feel like I've been cooped up
inside this lab forever.

283
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:07,614
Well, it's an opportunity
to spread your legs.

284
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,121
Good to smell the breezes, hum?

285
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:10,524
Has it changed much out there?

286
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:12,452
Oh, yes, you can say that two times.

287
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:13,860
Hey! Hey! Come on you guys!

288
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,456
Come on, get points!
Skroeder's coming up empty!

289
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:18,949
We're on our way, Howard,
to the great outdoors.

290
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:22,004
Newton, you know what is out there
in the great outdoors?

291
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:23,912
Girls. Ummm.

292
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:26,498
With brassieres and legs.

293
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,218
You have the working knowledge the girl?

294
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,668
No, but I read about them.

295
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,139
Well then... maybe I can furnish you
with some schematic drawings.

296
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,338
All right.

297
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,091
Hey! Who told you could
take Number One?

298
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:38,478
Howard, logically, if we need
protection from Number Five...

299
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,886
this is the best weapon
we could have.

300
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:42,399
Great, great!
So, instead of $11 million on the loose...

301
00:24:42,451 --> 00:24:44,406
we're going to have
twenty-two.

302
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,361
And plus, we are needing
gas money.

303
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,909
I'm sorry.
I just...

304
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,036
I have to draw the line
at snakes.

305
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:58,373
Ya, I'm sure it would make
a wonderful pet, but...

306
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,669
wait, isn't there a home
for cobras somewhere?

307
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:05,297
Can you hang on
for a second?

308
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,391
Can I call you right back?
Thanks.

309
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,648
Hey! Get out of there!

310
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:27,736
Frank?

311
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,405
Mr. Scumo!

312
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,703
I know you're in there.

313
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:41,708
Get out! Get out!
I'll call the cops.

314
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:55,430
What?
Are you deaf?

315
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,274
Oh, my God!

316
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:14,616
Oh, my God! I knew they'd
pick me. I just knew it.

317
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:19,997
Hello.

318
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,458
Well, I guess...

319
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:27,546
welcome to my planet.

320
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:33,177
Oh boy! Is this thrilling or what?

321
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,182
Don't be scared.

322
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,100
I'm a friend.

323
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,519
Friend?

324
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:48,609
Do you know
the word "friend"?

325
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,279
Because that's what I am.
I'm a friend.

326
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,656
So, here I come.

327
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:58,619
Nice and extremely friendly.

328
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:16,512
Hi.
It's me.

329
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:22,601
So, this is earth.

330
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:25,479
I'm Stephanie.
Speck.

331
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,148
No offense, but...

332
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,735
is that really you or is that
like a space suit...

333
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,862
and you're inside some place,
maybe just your brain...

334
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,240
in a little jar
or something like that?

335

Input.

338

That's information.

339

Listen, I am full of it.

340
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:53,298
Why don't you come to my house
and we can sit down and talk...

341

Come on.
It's okay.

343

No, no.
I mean come with me.

344
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:14,111
Come here. This way.

345
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:25,946
Come here.

346
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:29,063
Come on. Right this way.

347
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:32,129
March! Heel! Giddy up!

348
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,590
- Forward!
- Forward!

349
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,301
Forward, forward.
Come forward.

350
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,970
That's good.
That's really good.

351
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,431
Don't be afraid, guys.
He's a friend.

352
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,798
These are animals.
They're lower life forms.

353
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,103
They're always a little skittish
around new people, aliens. Whatever.

354
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:50,814
Malfunction. Need input.

355
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:53,348
Input.
All right, right. You got it, OK.

356
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,612
This is a house.
We live within it, inside it.

357
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,615
- We have a floor, see...
- Floor.

358
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:02,034
And we have the opposite
of a floor...

359
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,869
which is the ceiling.
Look up!

360
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:05,694
Ceiling.

361
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:07,414
We have windows and...

00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:16,840
Music.

365
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:20,552
And... look at this.

366
00:29:20,604 --> 00:29:23,138
This is a plant.
See?

367
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,265
And these are goldfish.

368
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,591
Don't touch.

369
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,832
And look over there.

370
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:31,970
See, these are ants.

371
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:34,441
They're not aunts,
they're ants.

372
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,860
It's an ant farm.

373
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:41,865
Look! These are my bunnies.
Edwina and Norman.

375
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:46,286
I bet you got some amazing
animals in your planet.

376
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,623
Good, there you go.

377
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:51,708
This is Earth, where
we are now.

378
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:55,504
You are here.
Here.

380

00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:02,386
Beavers.
Cherries. Input.

382
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,429
I'm giving you
great input.

383
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,765
More input.
More input.

384
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,685
How about pictures?
Do you like pictures?

385
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:11,728
We have a lot
of pictures here.

386
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:13,897
A lot of them.

387
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:18,527
This is a picture
of an aardvark.

388
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,488
See that? It's an aardvark.

389
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:24,950
- It's a mammal.
- Input. Aardvark.

390

- Holy Crowl. You can read.

391

- More input.
- Okay, no problem.

No problem.

00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:51,059
- My neck.
- Sorry.

395
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:52,968
This is very healthful
for the neck.

396
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,606
Can you believe it's been
5 years since I've driven?

397
00:30:55,658 --> 00:30:56,930
I'd say ten.

398
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,015
It's all coming
back to me, though.

399
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,069
You know what many people
are liking at night?

400
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,197
- What?
- Headlights.

401
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:07,743
- It's a lot better. Thanks.
- Definitely, ya

402
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,547
More input, Stephanie.

403
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,508
- More!
- There isn't anymore.

404
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,635
You've read everything
in the house.

405
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:29,348
Animal.
Mammal, skunk.

406
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,143
That's a container
drinking glass.

407
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:36,250
Pasta, semolina,
spaghetti.

408

Food, liquid,
spaghetti sauce.

409
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,527
Look, this may be hilarious
where you come from...

410
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:43,445
but on this planet it's considered rude.

411
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:47,616
Plants, fruits, oranges...

412
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,202
apples, lemons, limes.

413
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:52,371
That's great.
Thanks a lot.

Pardon me for saying so,

438

Besides, we got a job to do.

00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:52,050
And if you act now,
we'll send along...

469
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:55,053
You didn't come a million miles
to do TV commercials, did you?

470
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:58,088
<i>- Duracell...
- Of course you didn't.</i>

471
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,852
Come on. There's something
I wanna show you outside.

472
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,438
Bird. Raven.
Never more.

473
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:07,065
Now look.
Look.

474
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:12,029
Look.
No, no. There.

475
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:14,031
See?

476
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:17,284
Beautiful.

477
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:20,746
- Light bulb.
- No. Sun.

478
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:23,540
Beautiful.
No sun.

479
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:28,462
- Beautiful sun.
- Beautiful.

480
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,881
Rhinoceros, turtle...

481
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:32,883
Volkswagen.

482
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,053
You mean with that fat little
body, you can see those things.

483
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:41,934
Beautiful animal.

484
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,561
Mammal, canine, dog.

485
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,356
Mutt.

486
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:51,026
- Beasley.
- Beasley.

487
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:56,198
Beasley, stop it!

488
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:59,076
Beasley, down!
What are you doing?

489
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:00,369
Stop it!

490
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:01,662
Look out!

491
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:07,334
My God! What happened?
Are you all right?

492
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:11,255
Please, don't be hurt.
Are you okay?

493
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,382
Say something.

494
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,678
Beautiful Stephanie.

495
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,768
"S A I N T Prototype
number five...

496
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:28,397
Nova Robotics. Damon,
Washington". You're a robot?

497
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,941
- Yes.
- I thought you were alive number 5.

498
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:33,527
I let you tear my house
to shreds and you're a robot!

499
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:37,406
You're a machine from that dumb
war lab place. I'm so stupid.

500
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,409
Stupid: Foolish, gullible,
doltish...

501
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,035
- dumbbell.
- Shut up!

502
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:44,788
Shut up: Silence, hush,
sit on it, can it.

503
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,082
Am I the jerk of the world?
You're just programmed.

504
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,294
Jerk of the world, turkey,
idiot, pain in the ass.

505
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:54,381
I hope you're programmed
to pay for the mess you made.

506
00:36:58,427 --> 00:36:59,887
What if there's a reward
out for that thing?

507
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,722
I could take care of as many
animals as I want.

508
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:03,849
Hello.

509
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:06,810
I'd like to speak to one of your
head Warmongers, please.

510
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:10,480
Dr. Warmonger, Marner.
I think this may be something.

511
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:16,904
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

512
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:19,072
<i>I'd like you to know
I have one of your robots.</i>

513
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:21,700
God!

514
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,578
Good.
Yes.

515
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,372
Listen...

516
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:30,542
thank you very much
for calling.

517
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:33,086
Our people are
on their way.

518
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:37,299
Mount up!
We've got it!

519
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:38,926
Move! Move! Move!

520
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:42,095
Today, gentleman, today!
Let's go!

521
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:50,812
We gotta run away!
Let's go, let's go.

522
00:37:50,864 --> 00:37:53,690
In the meantime,
it's very important...

523
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:55,776
that you try to keep
a safe distance.

524
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:57,945
How safe a distance?

525
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,073
Well, see, it's malfunctioning.

526
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:05,285
We have to disassemble
it and check it out.

527
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:06,829
It's goofy little gadget.

528
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:10,082
Try to keep everyone as far away
from it as possible, okay?

529
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:12,960
Not that it's dangerous
or anything like that.

530
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,754
How much is a contraption
like that worth, anyway?

531
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:18,340
<i>Worth? I don' know.
A few hundred dollars maybe.</i>

532
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:20,884
No reward or anything
like that for finding it, is there?

533
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:25,222
Well, we do have a daily tour
of our facilities here.

534
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:28,642
<i>You know, I might even be able
to get you a student discount.</i>

535
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:31,061
- Hey! It's gone!
- Gone?

536
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:32,688
Wooly mammals.

537
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,648
Sheep.
Sweaters, mittens.

538
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,068
Never mind, I see it. Go back
to your nuclear warheads.

539
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:45,784
Hey, you, Number Five,
What are you doing?

540
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:48,068
You're gonna scare
my animals, bozo.

541
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,539
Listen, I just called Nova and
they are coming out to get you.

542
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:53,824
- They'll give you a tune up.
- Tune-up? Input.

543
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:56,420
They'll take you apart,
find out which screw is loose.

544
00:38:56,472 --> 00:39:00,382
Apart: Undone, dismantle,
dissect, disassemble.

545
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:01,842
Right.

546
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:03,677
Jump!

547
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:09,641
- Look, it's a grasshopper.
- Grasshopper, Orthoptarous insect.

548
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,186
Jump.

549
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:14,021
That's great.
Okay.

550
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,360
All right, let's go back now.
Come on.

551
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,362
Hey!

552
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:27,326
Damn it! You klutz!
Look what you did.

553
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,036
Error.

554
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:31,121
Grasshopper disassembled.

555
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:33,290
Reassemble.

556
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:35,532
Reassemble.

557
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:39,338
I can't reassemble him.
You squashed him, he's dead.

558
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,454
Dead?

559
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:43,832
Right.
Dead as a doornail.

560
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:47,137
Reassemble, Stephanie.
Reassemble.

561
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:51,756
I know you don't understand.

562
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,843
But when you're dead,
you're dead.

563
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:59,024
That's just the way it is.
Dead is forever.

564
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:04,279
Squash, dead.

565
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,242
Disassemble, dead!

566
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:12,079
Disassemble, dead!

567
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:13,956
Slow down.

568
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:17,960
- No disassemble.
- Where are you going?

569
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,339
- Please, escape.
- Oh, my God!

570
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:24,633
Hey, you!
Get out of my truck.

571
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:28,512
Hey! Hey! Let me in.
Let me in.

572
00:40:28,564 --> 00:40:30,754
No! Don't.

573
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:32,975
You open this door
right now.

574
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,812
Get out of my truck,
you thief.

575
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:45,320
No, don't start my truck.
You don't know how to drive.

576
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,833
Come back here with my truck,
you big hunk of tin.

577
00:40:57,885 --> 00:40:59,918
You can't take my truck.

578
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:18,729
You better be heavily insured
because you'll find yourself...

579
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:21,481
slapped with
a humongous lawsuit!

580
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:43,504
Newton, I'm seeing a blip
on my scope. Drive slowly.

581
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:47,841
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry.

582
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:51,053
Newton, there it goes.
It's moving at extreme velocipede.

583
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:02,262
Right of the line.
The right.

584
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:04,608
Accurate, proper,
correct, appropriate.

585
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:06,401
My side, over here.
Quickly!

586
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:07,486
- The right.
- Right.

587
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:08,904
The right.

588
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:15,536
Look out! Look out!

589
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:20,040
My kitchen!

590
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:24,628
No!

591
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:29,216
Where she going? I thought
Howard told her to stay put.

592
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:31,844
Go figure out chicks, man.

593
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:34,513
Look out!

594
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:40,018
Oh great! Nice work,
can head.

595
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,687
- Thanks at lot.
- Sorry.

596
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,442
Oh, no. Stop it now!
Stop!

597
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:49,820
- Turn left or we're going to crash!
- Left!

598
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,740
Turn! Turn!

599
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:55,742
- Fish!
- Look out!

600
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:57,619
Salmon!
Sushi.

601
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:00,289
Jeez, Number Five,
we're going to be killed.

602
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:03,500
- Disassemble.
- Disassemble all over the place.

603
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:06,295
Disassemble.
No!

604
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,095
Escape! Escape!

605
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:17,764
Flee! Hide! Refuge!

606
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:20,184
What are you afraid of?
What's the matter with you?

607
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:23,312
Nova Robotics.
Disassemble. Dead.

608
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,856
Disassemble Number Five. Dead.

609
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,025
But you can't die.
You're a machine.

610
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:30,861
- No.
- No, you're not a machine?

611
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:34,490
- Yes.
- Yes, you are or you're not?

612
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:36,366
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

613
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,483
Yes, not.

614
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:40,725
Talk about a malfunction.

615
00:43:40,777 --> 00:43:42,915
Not malfunction, Stephanie.

616
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:48,545
Number Five is alive.

617
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:52,257
Just keep going straight.
Just keep going straight.

618
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:53,926
Ok, Ok, alright...

619
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:56,136
We're getting closer.
Ben, we're getting closer.

620
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:57,679
I can sense it,
I can sense it.

621
00:43:57,971 --> 00:43:59,723
There they are! You see them?
They're right there.

622
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:04,853
Nova. Disassemble.

623
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:06,188
Dead. Disassemble number 5.

624
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:08,190
Dead.

625
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:11,527
Girlie, girlie, come quick!
Girlie, danger! Come on!

626
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:13,529
No, no disassemble,

627
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:16,240
No disassemble,
Number Five.

628
00:44:17,282 --> 00:44:18,700
Come on, you!

629
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:21,745
What planet is this guy from?

630
00:44:21,797 --> 00:44:24,029
No, no disassemble.

631
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:26,114
Oh, number 5, don't be scared.

632
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:28,752
You just wait here a second.
I'll be right back.

633
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:38,554
Come on, Number one.
Come on. Very good.

634
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:41,056
Careful. Moving nicely.

635
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:43,100
Jeez, another one.

636
00:44:43,392 --> 00:44:45,050
How many of these guys
have you got, anyway?

637
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:48,480
- You are a girl, right?
- Yes, as far as I know.

638
00:44:48,532 --> 00:44:51,233
Hi.
How you doing?

639
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,652
Your little brother's hiding
in my truck.

640
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:56,280
I have seen some
strange bizarre drivers...

641
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:59,283
but you may be
awarded the cake.

642
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:02,286
Me? Talk to your robot.
He did the driving.

643
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:04,402
Did you say the robot
drove the truck?

644
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:07,364
Yeah, that's right, chum.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

645
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:10,377
Oh, bull dyke, you cannot hold
your water with that story, girl.

646
00:45:10,429 --> 00:45:12,410
Hey, I was there, okay?

647
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,798
You're sure you weren't doing any
steering or anything like that?

648
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:16,498
Yeah, I like to drive off cliffs.

649
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:19,636
- There's no way my robot could have driven.
- Are you calling me a liar?

650
00:45:19,688 --> 00:45:23,807
No, but maybe you
have amnesia.

651
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:28,604
Newton! We are wasting
valueless time.

652
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:30,939
So what are these guys
used for, anyway?

653
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,525
- It's top-secret crap.
- That's what I figured.

654
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:35,986
Dr. Love, I'd like to get
my robot back.

655
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:38,697
He knows that,
but he's scared.

656
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:40,908
It's a machine.
It doesn't get scared.

657
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,202
It doesn't get happy.
It doesn't get sad.

658
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:46,705
- It just runs programs.
- How do you explain that?

659
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:53,285
You see?

660
00:45:53,337 --> 00:45:55,881
He's scared that if you take him
apart he's going to die.

661
00:45:55,933 --> 00:45:57,716
- Where'd you hear that?
- Number Five told me.

662
00:45:57,768 --> 00:45:59,785
He'd tell you if you'd
just talk to him.

663
00:45:59,837 --> 00:46:01,803
That's what I've been
trying to do for...

664
00:46:01,855 --> 00:46:04,765
No, I mean with your mouth.
Watch.

665
00:46:04,817 --> 00:46:05,766
Okay, Ben,
this is the plan.

666
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:06,923
Number Five!

667
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:09,645
Number Five!
Come on out. It's okay.

668
00:46:09,697 --> 00:46:11,011
- Is it cool?
- It's okay.

669
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:12,856
These guys aren't going
to hurt you. They're friends.

670
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:15,797
- No disassemble?
- No, no.

671
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:18,362
They just want
to talk to you.

672
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,328
Come forward.
Do you remember forward?

673
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,278
- Forward.
- That's it, come on.

674
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,499
I can't believe it.
It's listening to her, not to us.

675
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:33,210
I am standing here
beside myself.

676
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:35,035
Okay! Now.

677
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:37,381
You just tell them
what you told me.

678
00:46:37,433 --> 00:46:41,301
Number Five
not just robot.

679
00:46:41,353 --> 00:46:44,972
There it is! Move out!

680
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:47,015
Move! Move!

681
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:49,268
Move out!

682
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,062
Go! Go! Go!
Today, gentleman, today!

683
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:56,024
- Down, girlie!
- What, are you nuts?

684
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:07,494
Stop! Please.

685
00:47:07,786 --> 00:47:09,663
I have clearance!
I have clearance!

686
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,446
Bend down!

687
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:12,948
You quit doing that!

688
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,794
You think I'm doing this for
my own self-gratification?

689
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:33,812
Go!

690
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:46,116
No, Don't! Stop!

691
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:47,326
Stephanie!

692
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:51,747
They're killing him!

693
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:53,290
Hold your fire!

694
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,293
Damn it, stop!
Hold your fire!

695
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:58,504
Hold your fire!

696
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:03,759
Number Five alive!

697
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:06,386
Stephanie!

698
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:08,180
Number Five,
I'm sorry.

699
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:11,975
Steph-an-ia...

700
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:14,092
You're paralyzing him.

701
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:17,731
I cut all his power. You can
load it on the truck now.

702
00:48:17,783 --> 00:48:19,483
What the hell
is the matter with you...

703
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:21,276
you four-eyed idiot.

704
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:23,257
What an asshole.

705
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:24,947
I heard that.

706
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:28,075
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Where are you taking him?

707
00:48:28,127 --> 00:48:29,451
Okay, I want you guys to...

708
00:48:29,503 --> 00:48:30,442
He's not being a him.

709
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:33,455
It's only being wires and several
mechanisms and other such...

710
00:48:33,507 --> 00:48:34,738
machine type apparatus...

711
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,876
<i>for the Pete of sake.
The sake of Pete...</i>

712
00:48:37,928 --> 00:48:39,993
No, you have to turn
him back on.

713
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:42,422
He was talking before
like a real person.

714
00:48:42,474 --> 00:48:43,497
Couldn't you see that?

715
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:46,009
Look, lady, all I could see was that
something mechanical...

716
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:47,761
is screwed up and
I'm going to fix it, okay?

717
00:48:47,813 --> 00:48:49,638
Ok, fine! You fix it,
Einstein.

718
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:51,129
I plan to.

719
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:52,881
And it's Crosby.
Newton Crosby.

720
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,476
- Stephanie Speck.
- Nice meeting you.

721
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:55,467
Same here.

722
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:56,885
- Ben? Ben?
- Sir! Stat!

723
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:58,897
I want you to go with Number Five
and make sure they do not...

724
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:00,482
switch off the memory.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

725
00:49:00,534 --> 00:49:01,859
- Absolutely, sir.
- Okay.

726
00:49:01,911 --> 00:49:03,475
Bye-bye, goofy woman.

727
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:06,196
I enjoyed repeatedly throwing
you to the ground.

728
00:49:06,248 --> 00:49:07,948
No mistake.
Stat.

729
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,493
You can call me
if you want to.

730
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:12,692
Call you?

731
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:14,413
To let me know
if Number Five's okay.

732
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:17,166
Okay, maybe I will.

733
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,793
Well, don't do me
any favors, Jack.

734
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:29,835
So there we are.

735
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:31,628
We're right on top of
Mount St. Helen's...

736
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,808
- and we've got two flat tires.
- Two, that's bad.

737
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,852
Now Hazel's running around
the parking lot.

738
00:49:36,904 --> 00:49:38,437
Hazel.

739
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:39,897
<i>She's waving
her credit card...</i>

740
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:43,692
It's life.
It's life.

741
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:46,612
That is very funny
American name, Hazel.

742
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,781
Well, It's sure not one you
can hear much anymore.

743
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:51,700
I never heard it
before I met her.

744
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:54,703
All except for witch hazel,
who I think she's named after.

745
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:59,124
- I thought it was a nut.
- That's an old name.

746
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:00,667
It's an old family name.

747
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:02,294
They were from
some place in Europe...

748
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:05,464
and there's always a Hazel in it.
In her family.

749
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:08,842
I guess there's always some
Hazel in Europe.

750
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:15,766
She's running around trying
to buy somebody's spare tire.

751
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:18,977
She's showing people her ID's
to prove the checks are good...

752
00:50:19,029 --> 00:50:21,021
like a branch of our bank
where they could check.

753
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:26,109
She was even trying to swap some
souvenirs when she was gotten.

754
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:28,987
All of which were made from
the ashes of the volcano...

755
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,658
Did you get a piece of ash?

756
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:38,080
So, of course nobody's going to sell
her a spare tire...

757
00:50:38,132 --> 00:50:40,274
after what we just told
them happened to us.

758
00:50:40,326 --> 00:50:42,417
Especially the way
she was telling them.

759
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,586
And she was trying to convince
them I wasn't a bad driver...

760
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,171
which I'm not.

761
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:49,007
But, she was doing it by telling
them how thin the road is.

762
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:51,593
You know, and how curvy and
how many rocks there were...

763
00:50:51,645 --> 00:50:53,053
and how big
and sharp they are.

764
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:55,138
And all the time I know
what these people are thinking.

765
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,266
They gotta drive down
the same road...

766
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:34,011
- Sir?
- Yes, sir?

767
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:35,512
Sir?

768
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:38,140
Oh, my goodness gracious!

769
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,017
It can't shoot us with
that laser, can it?

770
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:41,758
I am not knowing.

771
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,813
- Would he kill me if I stopped?
- Who is to say?

772
00:51:44,865 --> 00:51:46,482
Would he kill me
if I don't stop?

773
00:51:46,534 --> 00:51:48,567
Again I am shrugging.

774
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:50,235
I'm stopping.

775
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:53,311
Good choice.

776
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:56,033
Number Five furious,
livid, perturbed.

777
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:59,995
Hold it right there.

778
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:03,457
Colt 45.
Semi automatic.

779
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,032
Play Doh.

780
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:07,085
What do we do now?

781
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:10,964
I don't know about you, but
I'm planning to scream and run.

782
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:13,133
Good answer.

783
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:24,520
What is he doing?

784
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:03,267
There it goes
Very good.

785
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:05,352
You earned that one.

786
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:25,664
Hi, honey!
What is for dinner?

787
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:48,979
Bingo!

788
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,592
<i>Practice, Easy Three,
to third and fourth.</i>

789
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:00,532
<i>Lucky's seventh and
Pacer in the rear.</i>

790
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:03,785
<i>Now it's Double Trouble making
a move on the outside rail...</i>

791
00:54:03,837 --> 00:54:06,605
<i>and Practice right behind.
Jimmy's Folly is calling...</i>

792
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:09,374
<i>That's the serpent and the devil...
same on him.</i>

793
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,210
<i>And the devil is the...</i>

794
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:04,972
Ready, aim!

795
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,183
What happened?

796
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:13,272
I hope you took the grass
out of the glove compartment.

797
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:16,233
Anything wrong, officer?

798
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:19,486
There's gotta be a logical
explanation for all of this.

799
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,739
Maybe, if it was programmed
to think it was alive...

800
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:24,241
then it could act alive.

801
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:26,910
Maybe you've created another
Frankfurter's monster.

802
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:29,788
Do I look like the kind of a man
who can actually hear his...

803
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,656
Howard I think that something
incredible is going on.

804
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:34,626
What's going on is that we've
got a red alert on your hands?

805
00:55:34,678 --> 00:55:35,586
No, it's not dangerous.

806
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:37,796
We just have to find
Number Five, get some answers.

807
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:39,204
There's only one answer.

808
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:41,175
All right, blast it off the
face of the earth, right?

809
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:43,719
Doctor... how many kids you got?

810
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:45,335
None.

811
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:46,471
Well, let me tell you
something, Doctor.

812
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:49,725
I got three of them.
Three dandy little Schroeders.

813
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:51,773
And I want them to be adults,
not barbecued.

814
00:55:51,825 --> 00:55:53,718
So don't you give me
any of your bullshit.

815
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,898
That having been said, I think
I've got to alert the media.

816
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:57,399
Now Schroeder's going to handle
this from now on...

817
00:55:57,608 --> 00:55:58,775
and you stay
at your terminal.

818
00:55:58,817 --> 00:56:00,100
Howard, this is ridiculous.

819
00:56:00,152 --> 00:56:01,726
Think of it as
a full-scale field test.

820
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:03,437
Leave your terminal and
you're out of a job.

821
00:56:03,489 --> 00:56:05,115
Howard, we are going to have
to put up some roadblocks...

822
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:06,825
and I'm going to
need some Hueys.

823
00:56:06,877 --> 00:56:07,816
Some what?

824
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:10,078
Helicopters, Howard.
Jesus Christ!

825
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:12,748
- I thought they were choppers.
- Now they're called Hueys.

826
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,833
Well, why wasn't I notified?

827
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,173
Okay, this is the plan...

828
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,479
- Stephanie Speck.
- Yes.

829
00:56:35,531 --> 00:56:36,344
We're from KJMB News.

830
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:39,107
Can you please tell us something
about the Nova robot?

831
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:40,901
- Were you scared?
- No, no.

832
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,903
<i>Did he try to molest
you in any way?</i>

833
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:44,905
<i>No, he's not that kind
of a robot.</i>

834
00:56:44,988 --> 00:56:48,033
<i>Do you know that there's a $25
thousand reward for anyone that turns it in?</i>

835
00:56:48,085 --> 00:56:49,441
<i>No, I don't know anything
about it.</i>

836
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:51,703
<i>I don't know where he is.
Please, leave me alone.</i>

837
00:56:51,755 --> 00:56:52,996
<i>Why didn't you go
to the police?</i>

838
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:55,582
You know where it is.

839
00:56:57,042 --> 00:57:00,838
For 25 thousand dollars I'm damn
well going to know where it is too.

840
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:10,430
Frank?

841
00:57:12,558 --> 00:57:14,309
Is that you, Frank?

842
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:17,104
I'm warning you,
I'm armed and dangerous.

843
00:57:21,692 --> 00:57:24,778
Disguise, camouflage. Hi!

844
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,865
Number Five!
You got away?

845
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:28,939
Yep.

846
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:30,409
You can't stay here!
They'll find you!

847
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,329
Stephanie.
Changed color.

848
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:43,589
Attractive,
nice software.

849
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:46,362
You sure don't talk
like a machine.

850
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:48,546
Alive, Stephanie.
Number Five alive.

851
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,514
Yes, I know you think
you're alive...

852
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:52,431
but those guys who built
you say no way.

853
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:54,516
I don't know what
to think anymore.

854
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:56,018
I know it's not safe
for you here.

855
00:57:56,185 --> 00:57:57,644
Go on.
Get out of here. Go on!

856
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:04,318
Solitude, isolation. Alone.

857
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:07,321
Number Five, come on!

858
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:10,021
Lonely bum.

859
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:11,857
Number five, please.

860
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:15,329
If I went to jail, who would
take care of my animals?

861
00:58:15,381 --> 00:58:16,955
You sure wouldn't.

862
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:19,197
What are you doing?

863
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:22,294
"A can of soup.
A meal in itself."

864
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:27,090
All right, you can stay,
but just for tonight.

865
00:58:27,216 --> 00:58:27,956
Excellent.

866
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,635
If they catch you
I don't know you.

867
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:31,762
You got it.

868
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,180
Okay, Ben, let's do it.

869
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:36,391
This is the very first vehicle
I've stolen in the US of A.

870
00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:37,518
Me, too. It's kind of exciting,
Isn't it?

871
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:39,686
With excitement like this,
who is needing enemas?

872
00:58:39,738 --> 00:58:40,969
Look Ben, we're doing
the right thing.

873
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:43,816
If they trash Number Five, we'll
never find out what happened.

874
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:46,777
Dr. Marner!

875
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:48,612
I knew you would try this.

876
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:49,811
You're not going
to make it, fellas.

877
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:52,324
There are soldiers out there
with bazooka's and choppers...

878
00:58:52,376 --> 00:58:53,940
or whatever the hell
they call them now.

879
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:57,246
We've got to try anyway. You're
a scientist, you understand.

880
00:58:57,298 --> 00:58:59,081
I'm a business man.
I'm not a scientist anymore.

881
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:00,332
Damn you, Howard.

882
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:02,918
20 years ago you would have
chauffeured us in this situation.

883
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:04,409
Well, times have changed.

884
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:06,745
Because that was then
and this is now.

885
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:08,966
All right, now come on.
Let's get back upstairs.

886
00:59:09,675 --> 00:59:11,260
What the heck, Newton.

887
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:13,929
Let us punch the sack.
Tomorrow is the next day.

888
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:15,973
No.

889
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:18,976
No.

890
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:21,019
No. I'm going.

891
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:24,106
Howard, shoot me
if you have to.

892
00:59:24,158 --> 00:59:25,149
Don't think I won't.

893
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:26,483
Come on, Howard,
you know you're bluffing.

894
00:59:26,535 --> 00:59:28,152
Lord Rama, Lord Rama.

895
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:29,903
Lord Rama,
Lord Rama, grant my wish.

896
00:59:32,156 --> 00:59:33,146
All right, I'm bluffing.

897
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,325
Ok, thank you. Come on, Ben,
let's get out of here.

898
00:59:35,377 --> 00:59:36,660
Right. Very good.

899
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:41,874
It doesn't matter anyway, the
doors are electronically sealed.

900
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:43,083
Don't be too sure.

901
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:49,756
Then you'll have
to drive over me.

902
00:59:49,808 --> 00:59:51,221
That's the way
it's gotta be.

903
00:59:51,273 --> 00:59:52,634
This is going to be
very messy.

904
00:59:52,718 --> 00:59:55,345
This is how I get
the big bucks.

905
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:29,379
Yeah.

906
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:03,121
Oh, very good.

907
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:05,040
Great.

908
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:07,417
Oh! Hey, thanks.

909
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:10,295
Okay, turn off the TV.

910
01:01:10,379 --> 01:01:12,172
- It's time for bed.
- No.

911
01:01:18,637 --> 01:01:21,265
No, turn off the TV.
It's time for bed.

912
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:25,727
Come on Steph, lighten up.
Let's give it a whirl.

913
01:01:25,779 --> 01:01:27,437
- Hey!
- Ya!

914
01:01:28,522 --> 01:01:32,025
- Listen, you, it's three a.m.
- It's early.

915
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:33,683
I mean, don't you ever
get enough?

916
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:36,258
Wrestling, roller derby,
Jimmy Swaggert...

917
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:38,782
The Three Stooges.
Give it a rest, will ya?

918
01:01:38,834 --> 01:01:41,410
Larry, Curly, Moe.

919
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:45,873
Hey, know what?
You're not a bad dancer.

920
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:47,583
Dancing fool.

921
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:52,713
- Big finish.
- Right.

922
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:55,507
And then I'm going to bed
and in the morning...

923
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:57,718
you have to find yourself
a new home.

924
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:00,929
This home.
Stephanie home.

925
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:02,420
Number Five home.

926
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:05,392
Oh, Number Five, you don't know
what you're saying.

927
01:02:05,444 --> 01:02:07,561
Number Five know.

928
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:16,945
"More than a woman."

929
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:21,992
"More than a woman to me."

930
01:02:22,044 --> 01:02:23,452
Oh, Number Five.

931
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:30,417
"More than a woman to me."

932
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:42,846
<i>I'll croon</i>

933
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:45,891
<i>A little song
About the moon</i>

934
01:02:47,476 --> 01:02:50,354
<i>And when I'm finished
With my crooning</i>

935
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:52,689
<i>On my knees I'll fall</i>

936
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,692
<i>My life, my love, my all</i>

937
01:02:57,528 --> 01:03:01,698
Okay, to make these
golden fluffy pancakes...

938
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:05,661
add flour, milk...

939
01:03:05,713 --> 01:03:07,120
and eggs.

940
01:03:13,669 --> 01:03:16,421
Mix thoroughly.

941
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:23,637
Still lumpy.

942
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:31,353
Marvelous.

943
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:34,356
For crisp, yet moist
potatoes...

944
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:37,401
brown on one side,
then turn over.

945
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:43,532
This will be
some good slop.

946
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:45,826
Is something burning?

947
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:48,704
- Morning.
- Oh! Number Five!

948
01:03:48,756 --> 01:03:50,946
- Good morning.
- Sleep well?

949
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:53,250
You're making me breakfast,
aren't you?

950
01:03:53,302 --> 01:03:54,751
Pancakes surprise.

951
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:57,588
Oh, Number Five,
you're so sweet.

952
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:00,591
Oh, no.

953
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:05,095
It's the revenge
of the Mutations.

954
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:08,807
Listen, why don't you turn that
stove off and I'll be right back.

955
01:04:09,475 --> 01:04:11,977
Wait!
It'll get cold.

956
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:16,106
What are you
doing here, creep?

957
01:04:16,158 --> 01:04:17,556
Oh, good morning.

958
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:19,610
I saw you on TV last night
on the news.

959
01:04:19,902 --> 01:04:21,361
Yeah, I'm a real
big celebrity.

960
01:04:21,778 --> 01:04:23,572
You know there's
a reward out for that robot?

961
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:25,324
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

962
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:27,075
No, I don't know
anything about it.

963
01:04:27,117 --> 01:04:28,452
Why don't you get off
my property?

964
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:42,007
- Steph...
- Leave me alone.

965
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:43,634
- Where is it?
- It's not here.

966
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:47,221
- Get out or I'll call the cops.
- Stephanie, breakfast.

967
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:50,224
Pancakes, hash browns.

968
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:53,633
Twenty five thousand dollars.

969
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:56,271
Don't worry, we'll split it.
Twenty for me and five for you.

970
01:04:56,323 --> 01:04:58,357
Listen, you gotta talk
computer to him.

971
01:04:58,482 --> 01:04:59,358
Tell him exactly what
you're doing...

972
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:01,652
exactly where you're going, or
he's not going to move an inch.

973
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:03,904
Number Five, this is Frank.

974
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:08,575
How, Robot.
Me friend.

975
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:11,620
No, talk computer,
not Apache.

976
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:15,082
Fresh O.J.?
Not from concentrate.

977
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:20,963
Thanks.

978
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,548
Listen, what do you say
we jump in my car...

979
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,299
we'll take a ride.
I'll take you home.

980
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:26,844
Tell him where home is.

981
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:28,887
Home is Nova.

982
01:05:29,555 --> 01:05:30,806
Nova! No!

983
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:32,495
No disassemble!

984
01:05:32,547 --> 01:05:33,892
Number Five, run!

985
01:05:33,934 --> 01:05:35,686
Come on, treads,
don't fail me now.

986
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:38,835
- Run, get away now!
- Get off me!

987
01:05:38,887 --> 01:05:41,473
You tricked me,
you little bitch!

988
01:05:41,525 --> 01:05:43,902
Does this mean I don't
get my five thousand dollars?

989
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:46,113
Forget it! Forget it!

990
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:49,074
He can go thirty miles an hour,
you big stupid jerk.

991
01:05:49,408 --> 01:05:50,482
I'll show you, how
stupid I am.

992
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:53,453
- Guess who's going to help me catch it.
- No, I'd rather die first!

993
01:05:53,505 --> 01:05:54,621
Where the hell is my car?

994
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,417
Hi.

995
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:04,955
Piece of cake.

996
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:07,259
Oh, my God!
My car!

997
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:10,596
- Oh, way to go, Number Five.
- Uh-oh!

998
01:06:14,516 --> 01:06:15,893
Oh, my God, no!

999
01:06:16,143 --> 01:06:17,603
Number Five, look out!

1000
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:23,525
"Say Pilgrim, that like to
parted my hair."

1001
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:26,904
"If you wanna play rough,
I can sure oblige ya."

1002
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:31,241
How can he do that?

1003
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:40,532
"Frankie...

1004
01:06:40,584 --> 01:06:44,546
you broke the unwritten law.
You ratted on your friends.

1005
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,173
And when you do that, Frankie...

1006
01:06:47,225 --> 01:06:48,967
your enemies don't respect you...

1007
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:51,391
you got no friends no more.

1008
01:06:51,443 --> 01:06:53,764
You got nobody Frankie."

1009
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:55,974
Pretty good, huh?

1010
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,811
Unbelievable.

1011
01:06:59,394 --> 01:07:00,771
Look out!

1012
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,816
How about that,
a goddamn robot?

1013
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,362
Stephanie, get off me!

1014
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:10,572
Stephanie, that's it.

1015
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:13,575
No!
Not disassemble Stephanie.

1016
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:18,705
No!

1017
01:07:42,855 --> 01:07:45,399
I'm calling Nova, and I'm
calling the cops.

1018
01:07:45,607 --> 01:07:47,234
And as for you, you
little pain-in-the-neck...

1019
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:50,070
you better not come crawling
back to me, because now it's over!

1020
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:51,363
Good.

1021
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,438
Okay, come on.

1022
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,159
They're gonna be after you.
We gotta get out here, now.

1023
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:02,833
So now I am having no job
to speak about.

1024
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,710
I will have to smack
the sidewalk.

1025
01:08:04,877 --> 01:08:06,545
I'm not going to let it happen.
You're not going to get fired...

1026
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:08,046
I'm not going to get fired...

1027
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:10,340
because we're going to find
Number Five intact.

1028
01:08:10,392 --> 01:08:11,206
Very good.

1029
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:12,759
<i>That's right, Howard.</i>

1030
01:08:12,885 --> 01:08:14,803
- It's Scrotum?
- Schoreder.

1031
01:08:15,345 --> 01:08:16,294
Same thing.

1032
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:17,254
<i>Now all roads are blocked</i>

1033
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:20,142
<i>her only chance is
a back road into the hills.</i>

1034
01:08:20,194 --> 01:08:22,311
<i>We'll concentrate our search there.</i>

1035
01:08:26,607 --> 01:08:28,567
Where the hell are we?

1036
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:30,486
"New York City".

1037
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:32,654
No, I don't think so.
Try the other side.

1038
01:08:32,706 --> 01:08:33,655
Ok.

1039
01:08:35,115 --> 01:08:36,909
Oh. Texaco.

1040
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:38,160
Great.

1041
01:08:38,619 --> 01:08:41,205
Well, I'm lost.
I don't know where to go.

1042
01:08:41,538 --> 01:08:43,415
- Strategy.
- What about it?

1043
01:08:43,467 --> 01:08:44,958
Need some, quick.

1044
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:47,920
Right, what we need is somebody
to make those bozos listen.

1045
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:51,173
- Not bozos.
- What?

1046
01:08:51,225 --> 01:08:52,382
One bozo.

1047
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:54,676
Newton Crosby, PhD.

1048
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:57,262
Hey, malfunction, he's the enemy.
He can't help.

1049
01:08:58,013 --> 01:08:59,212
Couldn't hurt.

1050
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:01,266
You know, I know why Number
Five took a liking to her.

1051
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:04,812
If it did have that capability,
which it doesn't, but if it did.

1052
01:09:04,864 --> 01:09:07,179
I mean, I think she's pretty,
don't you think?

1053
01:09:07,231 --> 01:09:10,400
I am thinking she's a virgin.
Or at least she used to be.

1054
01:09:10,943 --> 01:09:12,319
<i>Hello Crosby.</i>

1055
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:13,518
I think it's Howard.

1056
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:16,156
<i>I know you're listening,
so pick up the mike.</i>

1057
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:18,242
This is Crosby.
How's your back, Howard?

1058
01:09:18,294 --> 01:09:19,775
Just hunky-dory, thanks.

1059
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:22,204
I just swore out some warrants
for your arrest.

1060
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:23,195
Good golly.

1061
01:09:23,247 --> 01:09:26,416
<i>But because I'm a nice guy, I'm
going to give you one last chance.</i>

1062
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:29,127
<i>I got a phone call from that loony
in the lunch wagon.</i>

1063
01:09:29,179 --> 01:09:30,379
<i>She wants to see you.</i>

1064
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:33,121
<i>- Only you.
- She does?</i>

1065
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:35,676
Oh! Her pants are blazing for
you Newton Crosby.

1066
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:39,138
Will you grow up. I'll be there,
Howard, on one condition.

1067
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:40,514
No Schroeder.
Is it a deal?

1068
01:09:40,597 --> 01:09:41,765
<i>It's a deal.</i>

1069
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:44,393
<i>- Where does she want to meet?
- The Black Lion Inn.</i>

1070
01:09:54,987 --> 01:09:56,321
Good luck, sir.

1071
01:10:19,261 --> 01:10:20,512
Hi.

1072
01:10:21,555 --> 01:10:23,296
He's hidden far away.

1073
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:24,933
He's scared of you guys,
you know.

1074
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,103
Do I get him or not?

1075
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:30,314
First we talk... inside.

1076
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:36,351
My ex-boyfriend used to
bring me here.

1077
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:38,822
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Fine, good to see you.

1078
01:10:38,874 --> 01:10:41,533
- Yeah, ex. So what?
- Ah, nothing.

1079
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:45,829
Okay, here's the deal.

1080
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:48,332
Number Five is alive.

1081
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:53,337
I mean, he is really alive,
like you and me, you see?

1082
01:10:53,389 --> 01:10:55,370
I understand. They can seem
quite life-like...

1083
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:58,342
but they're still machines.
Just like your stereo...

1084
01:10:58,394 --> 01:10:59,619
or your vacuum cleaner.

1085
01:10:59,671 --> 01:11:00,844
No, I know he's a machine.

1086
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:03,378
You're a machine, I'm a
machine. We're alive.

1087
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:06,642
How it happens, who the hell
knows. But it has happened.

1088
01:11:06,694 --> 01:11:08,143
Okay.

1089
01:11:08,602 --> 01:11:12,856
Believe me, I'm not against the
idea that happen, but you see...

1090
01:11:13,106 --> 01:11:15,234
I built the machine from scratch.

1091
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:18,111
And alive, alive...

1092
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:19,311
it doesn't compute.

1093
01:11:19,363 --> 01:11:24,159
I know. It's not your everyday
event. But somehow, it's true.

1094
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:29,414
As Guerrero steps to the plate.
The pitch...

1095
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:33,710
and it's a long line drive
to deep left center.

1096
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:36,129
Hyde is going back for it!
He's...

1097
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:43,929
Robot alert!
Number Five located.

1098
01:11:44,555 --> 01:11:47,349
Engage in capture,
do not destroy.

1099
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:51,019
Have you thought about
what you're doing?

1100
01:11:51,071 --> 01:11:52,928
Trying to hide something
like this?

1101
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,984
If you want to help Number Five,
let me have it back.

1102
01:11:57,036 --> 01:11:59,278
It's malfunctioning.
It needs to be repaired.

1103
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:01,947
Life is not a malfunction.

1104
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:09,621
Number Five axis four twenty-nine.

1105
01:12:09,673 --> 01:12:10,956
Stay where you are.

1106
01:12:12,457 --> 01:12:15,711
- Strike three.
- Number Five, stay where you are.

1107
01:12:17,838 --> 01:12:20,924
Number one,
you're out of there.

1108
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:25,679
Number Five, stay
where you are.

1109
01:12:26,972 --> 01:12:27,973
Oh, my gosh.

1110
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:34,396
Tools.

1111
01:12:34,605 --> 01:12:35,731
Hammer! Axe!

1112
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:38,348
Rope!

1113
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,278
Three quarter inch double-braid.
Perfecto!

1114
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:45,157
"Escaped Robot Fights for
His Life. Film at Eleven."

1115
01:12:45,209 --> 01:12:46,658
Target in sight. Fire!

1116
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:53,123
Capture and hold.
Elevation sixteen degrees.

1117
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:57,919
Visibility five feet,
two feet, no feet.

1118
01:12:57,971 --> 01:13:01,965
Hey, laser lips! Your mama
was a snowblower.

1119
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:21,735
That wraps you up,
you rascally robot.

1120
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:28,325
Target located. Elevation
sixteen degrees. Fire!

1121
01:13:29,117 --> 01:13:30,369
Holy moley!

1122
01:13:34,623 --> 01:13:37,042
- Elevation 22 degrees.
- Dumbo!

1123
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:38,877
Axis lost. Seventeen...

1124
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,957
Temper, temper!

1125
01:13:46,009 --> 01:13:47,386
Three degrees. Fire!

1126
01:13:54,309 --> 01:13:55,310
Oley!

1127
01:13:57,855 --> 01:14:00,149
Don't fire.
Don't light a match.

1128
01:14:01,358 --> 01:14:04,528
Well, when you gotta go
don't squeeze the charming.

1129
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:29,418
Oh, no.
Nova!

1130
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:30,335
Let me tell you something.

1131
01:14:30,387 --> 01:14:32,546
I don't like these Nova guys
anymore than you do.

1132
01:14:32,598 --> 01:14:34,975
In fact, I don't care if they
ever get Number Five back...

1133
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:36,133
but I want to see it.

1134
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:39,313
If I show where he is,
do I have your word...

1135
01:14:39,365 --> 01:14:41,049
you will not experiment on him?

1136
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:42,876
You will not flip his switches?

1137
01:14:42,928 --> 01:14:44,540
And you will not take him apart?

1138
01:14:44,592 --> 01:14:46,153
Absolutely.
You have my word.

1139
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,990
He's out back.
I'll take you to him.

1140
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:51,950
If you are ready, young lady,
you can take me, too.

1141
01:14:52,002 --> 01:14:52,816
Schroeder!

1142
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:54,578
Terrific job, Crosby.
Thanks for the help.

1143
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,038
- No, I had nothing...
- You bastard!

1144
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:57,664
- I'm not...
- You're liar.

1145
01:14:57,716 --> 01:14:58,665
No I didn't know...

1146
01:15:01,376 --> 01:15:03,045
Stephanie, a trap!

1147
01:15:03,128 --> 01:15:04,796
Nova! Depart!

1148
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,507
<i>Look out!</i>

1149
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:19,478
Here's your table sir.

1150
01:15:19,812 --> 01:15:22,731
- You little bastard!
- Paco, please. No autographs, sir.

1151
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:26,735
Come Stephanie.
We be German.

1152
01:15:30,531 --> 01:15:31,406
Bastard!

1153
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,194
Stop!

1154
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:39,206
- Stop!
- Go, go, go, go!

1155
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:52,136
Great idea. Newton Crosby,
Ph. Dork.

1156
01:15:59,476 --> 01:16:01,854
- What are you doing?
- Keep driving.

1157
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:16,326
- Step on it!
- Okay, hold on.

1158
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:28,589
I have had it!
I have had it!

1159
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:32,467
- This was a precision operation.
- Schroeder, you set me up!

1160
01:16:32,519 --> 01:16:34,428
Crosby, I'm telling you
right now...

1161
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:38,307
this little fart of a robot is
beginning to give me red ass.

1162
01:16:39,558 --> 01:16:41,716
Where the hell
are those other robots?

1163
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:44,646
They should have cut
Number Five to pieces by now.

1164
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:51,195
- Where are you guys going?
- Who's asking?

1165
01:16:51,247 --> 01:16:53,202
A wise guy.

1166
01:16:53,254 --> 01:16:55,157
Excuse this.

1167
01:16:55,365 --> 01:16:56,742
And this.

1168
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:02,664
<i>Hey, Cut it out!</i>

1169
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:09,755
<i>Numskulls.</i>

1170
01:17:26,647 --> 01:17:28,941
Cars. Dumb machines.

1171
01:17:29,942 --> 01:17:31,068
That creep.

1172
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:33,904
I should have known. Every time
I think a guy's gonna be okay...

1173
01:17:33,956 --> 01:17:35,437
turns out to be a real jerk.

1174
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:37,032
They are all alike!
All of them!

1175
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:38,575
Stephanie...

1176
01:17:38,617 --> 01:17:40,661
Well, the next time they mess
with us, we're gonna kick ass.

1177
01:17:40,994 --> 01:17:43,622
Kick ass?
Donkey, mule, burro...

1178
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:46,124
One of them comes near you,
you blast them!

1179
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:48,126
Just burn his butt
with your laser.

1180
01:17:48,178 --> 01:17:49,545
- Burn?
- Yeah!

1181
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:53,841
No!
No disassemble.

1182
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:57,386
Number Five, come on,
they deserve it.

1183
01:17:57,438 --> 01:17:58,929
Stephanie.

1184
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,932
Jesus, I'm sorry.

1185
01:18:02,141 --> 01:18:03,100
I just...

1186
01:18:04,393 --> 01:18:07,146
I don't know what
to do anymore.

1187
01:18:08,147 --> 01:18:09,898
Take heart little lady.

1188
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:12,317
I'll fix their wagon.

1189
01:18:33,547 --> 01:18:37,468
Well, the cat is dragged in a sight
for four eyes that is for sure.

1190
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,042
You look dreadful.

1191
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:40,512
What happened?
Where is Number five?

1192
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:43,432
I saw something incredible.
I saw three robots...

1193
01:18:43,484 --> 01:18:45,006
totally re-programmed in
ten minutes.

1194
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:47,394
I saw Number Five crash
trough a wall, grab the girl...

1195
01:18:47,446 --> 01:18:48,510
I think he was rescuing her...

1196
01:18:48,562 --> 01:18:50,595
crash trough another wall
and drive away.

1197
01:18:50,647 --> 01:18:53,056
- It was screaming her name.
- Now, wait a minute.

1198
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:55,464
If you're thinking what I'm
thinking you're thinking...

1199
01:18:55,516 --> 01:18:58,128
then you are thinking that
female chick is some sort of...

1200
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:00,741
- super hacker or something.
- Sure. She's a super hacker.

1201
01:19:00,793 --> 01:19:02,060
First, she cracks
the Nova access code...

1202
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:03,275
then, she deciphers
for the language...

1203
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:05,662
I invented, all
while we were sitting in the bar.

1204
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:09,186
- Which was great.
- Really? Tell me. What happened?

1205
01:19:09,238 --> 01:19:11,710
We were interfacing, operating
on the same wavelength...

1206
01:19:11,762 --> 01:19:12,878
Very good, my advice helped, then.

1207
01:19:14,338 --> 01:19:16,423
What happened, did she stick
her tongue down your throat?

1208
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:17,247
No, no.

1209
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:19,426
Come on, sit in the van and tell me.
I want to know, yes sir.

1210
01:19:19,478 --> 01:19:20,469
Yes! Come on, Newton.

1211
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:21,543
Oh, my goodness.

1212
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:24,807
I am sporting
a tremendous woody right now.

1213
01:19:24,859 --> 01:19:26,058
Come on, tell me Newton.

1214
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:29,770
Our hands came really
close to touching.

1215
01:19:29,822 --> 01:19:31,814
And she said I had really
nice eyes.

1216
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:32,856
Yeah, you have really brown eyes.

1217
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:36,151
And then Schroeder came in with
his Gestapo and ruined it all.

1218
01:19:36,203 --> 01:19:38,429
Those bunch of
male-type organs.

1219
01:19:38,481 --> 01:19:40,656
- Right.
- That's what I'm meaning.

1220
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:42,439
That's the RF receiver.

1221
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:44,514
It's still tuned to Number Five's
wavelength, right?

1222
01:19:44,566 --> 01:19:46,537
Yes, but only if it is less than
twenty feet away.

1223
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:51,458
Hello, bozos.

1224
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:58,257
<i>Guys, it's Howard. If you don't
return my van in 15 minutes...</i>

1225
01:20:00,259 --> 01:20:03,303
Benjamin Jhabutiyah,
delete.

1226
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:05,347
No, wait!
Rethink yourself.

1227
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:07,391
Exit, depart, leave.

1228
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:09,685
Hear my dust, Newton Crosby!

1229
01:20:09,737 --> 01:20:10,727
Let us break wind!

1230
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:16,150
Newton Crosby,
no run, no talk.

1231
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:18,110
Drive.

1232
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:22,364
Today, Crosby, today!

1233
01:20:39,923 --> 01:20:41,383
Number Five?

1234
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:45,387
Number Five,
where are you?

1235
01:20:57,941 --> 01:20:59,401
All right dipshit...

1236
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:01,685
where's Number Five?
What did you do to him?

1237
01:21:01,737 --> 01:21:03,822
- You gotta control yourself just a tad.
- Hello.

1238
01:21:04,948 --> 01:21:06,148
Hi.

1239
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,160
You kidnapped him?

1240
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:10,913
Kidnapped,
shanghaied, hijacked.

1241
01:21:10,965 --> 01:21:12,831
Outstanding!

1242
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:15,167
Communicate!
Need input!

1243
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:17,919
I have questions,
queries, posers.

1244
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:20,370
- You and me, both.
- Well, good.

1245
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:24,176
You go up there, sit down,
look at the stars...

1246
01:21:24,593 --> 01:21:27,763
talk to each other,
get to know each other...

1247
01:21:27,815 --> 01:21:29,598
- man to man.
- Yes.

1248
01:21:29,848 --> 01:21:32,726
Beautiful stars.
Better see.

1249
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:36,146
Beautiful stars.
Better see?

1250
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:37,137
Oh, my God.

1251
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:39,848
Are all geniuses as
stupid as you?

1252
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,381
He means it's a beautiful
view of the stars.

1253
01:21:42,433 --> 01:21:44,863
I think he speaks very well
for a four day old.

1254
01:21:47,533 --> 01:21:50,869
Come. Come.
Input! Input!

1255
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,831
Beautiful.

1256
01:21:54,883 --> 01:21:56,531
Right.

1257
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:58,001
One more time,
from the top.

1258
01:21:58,752 --> 01:22:00,087
Who is your programmer?

1259
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,840
Me.

1260
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,513
You rewired
all your switches.

1261
01:22:10,013 --> 01:22:12,141
No wonder
you're malfunctioning.

1262
01:22:14,309 --> 01:22:19,022
Switches are my switches.
Life not malfunction.

1263
01:22:19,074 --> 01:22:22,025
Not malfunction.
I am alive.

1264
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:25,602
No, you're not!
You can't be.

1265
01:22:25,654 --> 01:22:27,489
There's gotta be another
explanation.

1266
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:29,449
Okay! What?

1267
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:34,611
Sorry, time's up.

1268
01:22:34,663 --> 01:22:36,874
Wait a minute,
I'm thinking.

1269
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:45,090
Could be any number
of mechanical possibilities.

1270
01:22:45,142 --> 01:22:47,301
Entrance of moisture
into the system.

1271
01:22:47,353 --> 01:22:49,329
- Heat expansion.
- Try again.

1272
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,305
- Vibration damage.
- No way Jose.

1273
01:22:51,513 --> 01:22:53,515
- I'm fit as a fiddle.
- Okay.

1274
01:22:54,266 --> 01:22:56,602
Then why did you
ignore your programming?

1275
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:59,771
Programming says "Destroy".

1276
01:22:59,823 --> 01:23:02,149
Is disassemble.
Make dead.

1277
01:23:02,983 --> 01:23:04,401
Number Five cannot.

1278
01:23:04,453 --> 01:23:05,444
Why?

1279
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,770
Why cannot?

1280
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:11,074
Is wrong. Incorrect.

1281
01:23:11,533 --> 01:23:15,318
Newton Crosby, PhD,
not know this?

1282
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:19,333
Well, of course I know it's wrong
to kill, but who told you?

1283
01:23:20,626 --> 01:23:22,920
I told me.

1284
01:23:27,591 --> 01:23:31,209
<i>Pattycake, pattycake,
baker's man</i>

1285
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:34,963
<i>Bake me a cake
as fast as you can...</i>

1286
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:38,018
Here, I brought you some soup.
It's getting cold.

1287
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:39,978
- Thank you.
- Convinced yet?

1288
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:44,691
Well, I got one.

1289
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:52,950
<i>There we go.
Pattycake, Pattycake...</i>

1290
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:56,662
Number Five,
what do you make of this?

1291
01:23:58,330 --> 01:23:59,790
Wood pulp?

1292
01:23:59,998 --> 01:24:02,167
Plant, vegetable,
tomato.

1293
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:04,962
Water, salt,
monosodium glutamate.

1294
01:24:05,379 --> 01:24:07,798
Okay. Thank you.

1295
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:10,342
Now you're talking
like a robot.

1296
01:24:10,968 --> 01:24:13,929
And resemble,
look like...

1297
01:24:15,973 --> 01:24:17,766
butterfly.

1298
01:24:17,818 --> 01:24:19,351
Bird.

1299
01:24:19,643 --> 01:24:21,854
- Maple leaf.
- Where?

1300
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:27,276
Holy shit!

1301
01:24:27,526 --> 01:24:30,696
No shit.
Where see shit?

1302
01:24:33,532 --> 01:24:36,994
Ok, here's your oscillating
circuit. That's done right.

1303
01:24:37,046 --> 01:24:38,276
And here's...

1304
01:24:38,328 --> 01:24:39,746
Now, why'd you do this?

1305
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:41,029
Why'd you do this?

1306
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:45,085
You shouldn't even
be operating if this goes into...

1307
01:24:45,137 --> 01:24:46,587
Let me get my other one.

1308
01:25:21,288 --> 01:25:22,706
I got it!

1309
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:26,158
I got it!

1310
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,836
All right, this is it!

1311
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:29,703
Now, listen close.

1312
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:31,538
There's a priest, a minister
and a rabbi.

1313
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:34,218
They're out playing golf and
they're trying to decide...

1314
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:35,260
how much to give to charity.

1315
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:37,461
So the priest says, we'll
draw a circle on the ground...

1316
01:25:37,513 --> 01:25:39,473
we'll throw the money way up
in the air and whatever lands...

1317
01:25:39,525 --> 01:25:40,974
inside the circle,
we give to charity.

1318
01:25:41,016 --> 01:25:42,924
The minister says "no", we'll
draw a circle on the ground,

1319
01:25:42,976 --> 01:25:45,687
we'll throw the money way up in the air
and whatever lands outside the circle...

1320
01:25:45,739 --> 01:25:47,773
that's what we give to charity.
The rabbi says "no, no, no"...

1321
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:49,691
we'll throw the money way
up in the air...

1322
01:25:49,858 --> 01:25:51,902
and whatever God wants, He keeps.

1323
01:25:58,826 --> 01:26:02,579
Oh! I get it. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...

1324
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:18,929
What's the matter?

1325
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:23,433
- Is he laughing?
- Yeah.

1326
01:26:25,602 --> 01:26:27,469
And the joke wasn't
even that funny.

1327
01:26:27,521 --> 01:26:29,189
And I figured I screwed up
the punch line.

1328
01:26:29,565 --> 01:26:31,900
Whatever God wants
He keeps.

1329
01:26:32,401 --> 01:26:34,027
Well, you look kinda
shook up.

1330
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:35,779
Yeah, it's really true.

1331
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:39,533
Spontaneous emotional
response.

1332
01:26:39,575 --> 01:26:41,034
I am alive. Yes?

1333
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:43,704
Yeah, yeah, yes you are.
Yes! Yes!

1334
01:26:50,377 --> 01:26:51,326
Hey!

1335
01:26:51,378 --> 01:26:53,297
I hope you bought enough
for everybody.

1336
01:26:53,922 --> 01:26:55,424
Give me one, too, Steph.

1337
01:26:56,967 --> 01:26:59,052
Oh, right on the sensor.

1338
01:27:04,725 --> 01:27:06,810
Danger! Nova!

1339
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:13,066
All right, come on,
come down.

1340
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:15,684
Why?
Just tell them he's alive.

1341
01:27:15,736 --> 01:27:17,154
Well, it doesn't look like
they want to hear that.

1342
01:27:17,206 --> 01:27:18,019
What? Wait a minute.

1343
01:27:18,071 --> 01:27:20,157
The plan was: We convince you,
and you convince them.

1344
01:27:20,209 --> 01:27:21,825
Damn it, Crosby,
you lied to me again.

1345
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,259
Deploy!

1346
01:27:49,311 --> 01:27:51,563
Hit it, hit it, hit it!
Deploy!

1347
01:27:55,818 --> 01:27:58,195
The army!
The real army!

1348
01:27:58,362 --> 01:28:00,989
Your target is there,
gentlemen.

1349
01:28:02,199 --> 01:28:03,732
Crosby...

1350
01:28:03,784 --> 01:28:07,120
if I were you I would
come out of there.

1351
01:28:07,172 --> 01:28:08,653
Stat.

1352
01:28:08,705 --> 01:28:11,166
Jesus, these guys
are really severe!

1353
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:14,253
Weapons. M-16 machine guns.

1354
01:28:14,711 --> 01:28:17,339
- 40mm grenade launchers.
- Let me handle it.

1355
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,385
Hi, Howard.

1356
01:28:21,635 --> 01:28:23,470
Schroeder. How you doin'?

1357
01:28:23,762 --> 01:28:25,629
Howard. Howard!

1358
01:28:25,681 --> 01:28:28,600
We're fine. Number Five
is right here with us.

1359
01:28:28,652 --> 01:28:31,301
I've got it completely
under my control.

1360
01:28:31,353 --> 01:28:33,605
- Another lie.
- I'm lying to them, not to you.

1361
01:28:33,772 --> 01:28:35,023
It's still lying.

1362
01:28:36,233 --> 01:28:38,569
We're coming out now.

1363
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:43,574
They're cooking something up.
I can smell it.

1364
01:28:43,626 --> 01:28:45,450
We gotta fire them now, Howard.

1365
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:49,538
Don't you dare shoot
your stupid guns.

1366
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:52,374
- Where's Number Five?
- He's fine. He's in the van.

1367
01:28:53,167 --> 01:28:54,459
Okay. Okay.

1368
01:28:54,877 --> 01:28:58,255
Why don't you and the young
lady just get away from the van...

1369
01:28:58,422 --> 01:28:59,923
and let us handle it?

1370
01:29:00,007 --> 01:29:02,593
Yes, Stephanie, get away.
Danger.

1371
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:04,595
No, listen...

1372
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:08,140
I was able to activate
the voice command module.

1373
01:29:08,192 --> 01:29:09,005
God damn it!

1374
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:11,560
I am sick and tired of listening
to this technical bullshit.

1375
01:29:11,602 --> 01:29:14,646
Shut up, Schroeder,
I'll handle this.

1376
01:29:14,698 --> 01:29:16,482
He's stalling.

1377
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:23,155
Crosby, we're going to have to
ask you to surrender the robot.

1378
01:29:24,781 --> 01:29:25,782
No!

1379
01:29:27,201 --> 01:29:29,786
- Stat?
- Stat!

1380
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:33,290
- What does that mean anyway?
- I don't know.

1381
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:35,918
But that is not the point.

1382
01:29:36,084 --> 01:29:38,587
We need that robot.

1383
01:29:38,629 --> 01:29:40,412
Howard, listen...

1384
01:29:40,464 --> 01:29:42,466
I know what
the malfunction is.

1385
01:29:43,175 --> 01:29:44,291
Sorry, Crosby...

1386
01:29:44,343 --> 01:29:46,282
we can't take any more chances.

1387
01:29:46,334 --> 01:29:48,222
We're not losing that thing again.

1388
01:29:48,555 --> 01:29:51,683
Howard, if you'd just come over
and inspect the unit...

1389
01:29:53,977 --> 01:29:55,562
You're all such
a bunch of liars!

1390
01:29:56,438 --> 01:29:58,732
As soon as they're clear,
open fire!

1391
01:29:58,816 --> 01:29:59,639
What have you done?

1392
01:29:59,691 --> 01:30:01,338
- Schroeder!
- I'll take care of this.

1393
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:02,986
No, you're not taking over.
Now listen...

1394
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:07,783
Banzai!

1395
01:30:11,578 --> 01:30:13,372
<i>Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!</i>

1396
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,499
He's alive! He's alive!

1397
01:30:18,627 --> 01:30:19,659
Call them off, Howard.

1398
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:21,547
You're making the biggest
mistake in history!

1399
01:30:21,672 --> 01:30:23,340
He's alive! I can prove it.

1400
01:30:26,593 --> 01:30:28,846
No, look, it's okay.
He's going to make it!

1401
01:31:19,855 --> 01:31:21,315
No!

1402
01:31:35,996 --> 01:31:37,831
Number Five!

1403
01:32:02,022 --> 01:32:05,651
Oh, my God.
Get me out of here.

1404
01:32:15,953 --> 01:32:17,913
Magnificent! Magnificent!

1405
01:32:17,955 --> 01:32:20,457
Now that, my friend,
is how you kick ass!

1406
01:32:20,582 --> 01:32:23,836
Years of research are down the tube
and you're happy as a pig in slop.

1407
01:32:23,877 --> 01:32:25,921
Just doing my job, sir.

1408
01:32:26,964 --> 01:32:29,967
Maybe from now on you can
do it somewhere else.

1409
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:00,247
Are you going to be okay?

1410
01:33:01,582 --> 01:33:03,458
I don't think so.

1411
01:33:03,876 --> 01:33:05,711
Not for a while.

1412
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:11,175
I'm sorry you lost your job.

1413
01:33:11,884 --> 01:33:14,761
But I'm really glad you quit Nova.

1414
01:33:16,555 --> 01:33:18,932
- What will you do now?
- I don't know yet.

1415
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:22,686
My dad left me a few
acres up in Montana.

1416
01:33:23,353 --> 01:33:25,564
I hear it's beautiful there
this time of year.

1417
01:33:25,981 --> 01:33:27,524
Great idea!

1418
01:33:27,608 --> 01:33:30,694
I say we cruise on up there
and check it out.

1419
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:35,324
Hi, honey! I'm home!

1420
01:33:35,824 --> 01:33:37,284
Number Five?

1421
01:33:40,162 --> 01:33:42,623
Pull over, pull over,
quick, pull over!

1422
01:33:51,048 --> 01:33:53,300
- Number Five!
- Stephanie!

1423
01:33:53,342 --> 01:33:56,220
It's so good to see you.
I thought they blew you up.

1424
01:33:56,345 --> 01:33:58,847
Counterfeit. facsimile.
Replica!

1425
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:03,185
He made a duplicate of himself
from all these spare parts.

1426
01:34:03,237 --> 01:34:04,937
That's incredible!
This guy's a genius!

1427
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:06,553
Above average.

1428
01:34:06,605 --> 01:34:07,648
Oh, Number Five, you are great!

1429
01:34:07,689 --> 01:34:09,900
You're outstandingly great!

1430
01:34:11,568 --> 01:34:12,820
What's our next move?

1431
01:34:12,861 --> 01:34:14,947
Come on, let's do as he says.
We'll go to Montana.

1432
01:34:14,999 --> 01:34:15,948
Ya!

1433
01:34:16,448 --> 01:34:18,826
I got forty acres up there.
Great for him to hide out...

1434
01:34:18,878 --> 01:34:20,233
Soak up input.

1435
01:34:20,285 --> 01:34:22,621
I don't know. I have
responsibilities here.

1436
01:34:22,673 --> 01:34:24,957
- What about my animals?
- Come on, Stephanie.

1437
01:34:25,009 --> 01:34:27,376
Wait a minute.
Did you say forty acres?

1438
01:34:27,876 --> 01:34:30,170
Listen, do you like animals?

1439
01:34:31,088 --> 01:34:33,090
Yeah. How many animals
are we talking about?

1440
01:34:33,142 --> 01:34:35,968
Great. I drive, you two
work this out.

1441
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:52,057
Number five stupid name.

1442
01:34:52,109 --> 01:34:56,280
- Want to be Kevin or Dave.
- Just watch the road, okay?

1443
01:34:56,738 --> 01:34:58,907
Maybe Johnny. Yeah.

1444
01:34:59,366 --> 01:35:02,035
Johnny Five. That's cool.

1445
01:35:05,038 --> 01:35:06,331
Gimme five.
