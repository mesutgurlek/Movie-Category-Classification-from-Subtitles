1
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:38,893
How about some red-hot peanuts?

2
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,769
Peanuts! Get your peanuts here!

3
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,832
Go! Go! Go! Go!

4
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,278
Safe!

5
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:53,884
Now batting for the Cardinals,
number 14, Stanley Boyer!

6
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,490
Come on!

7
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:07,092
We missed four innings.

8
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:11,500
Well, like l said, l had to stop
and do some business. Here. Sit down.

9
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:15,069
Hey, you usher,
can l talk to you a second?

10
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,574
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,240
Gil, this is Stan.
He´s gonna watch you for a while.

12
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:27,513
l have some friends l´m meeting.
l´ll be back for the ninth inning.

13
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:30,350
- Have fun, kid.
- Get your programs!

14
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:41,197
- So, Gilly, big baseball fan?
- Kind of.

15
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,963
Dad bring you here a lot?

16
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:47,665
Once a year on my birthday.
Then he pays an usher to watch me.

17
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,342
Oh, l see.

18
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:58,312
You have to understand,
my father in his own childhood...

19
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,478
was without a positive
male influence.

20
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:02,987
Huh?

21
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:06,320
His own father kicked him out
when he was 15...

22
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:10,726
so my dad was taught to see
child raising as a burden--

23
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:14,960
a prison rather than a playground.

24
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,969
You understand what l´m saying?

25
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,473
- You don´t talk like a kid.
- Well, l´m not really a kid.

26
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,532
- You´re not a duck.
- l´m remembering when l was a kid.

27
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,546
l´m 35 now.
l have kids of my own.

28
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,215
You don´t really even exist.

29
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:34,752
- You´re an amalgam.
- A what?

30
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:41,524
A combination of several ushers
my dad left me with over the years.

31
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:45,394
- l combined them into one memory.
- Why?

32
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:48,433
This was a great
symbolic moment in my life.

33
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,661
My father dumping me with you.

34
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:54,672
lt´s why l swore things would be
different with my kids.

35
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,643
lt´s my dream--
strong, happy, confident kids.

36
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,737
That´s great.

37
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:06,649
You´ve got a lovely family,
and l´m a goddamn amalgam!

38
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,448
Who´s that?

39
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:15,516
- That´s my wife.
- Nice.

40
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,255
Yeah?

41
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,356
Game´s over, honey.

42
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,960
The St. Louis Cardinals thank you
for attending today´s game.

43
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:29,098
Please drive home safely
and soberly.

44
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:30,573
Let´s go.

45
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:34,079
Come on, Justin.
Do you want to walk? Let´s walk.

46
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:38,014
lt´s fun. Come on. Let´s walk.
Sure you don´t want to walk?

47
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,573
There we go.

48
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,812
l´ll get it.

49
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:48,025
There´s your pennant.

50
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,752
Watch it!
Watch the car.

51
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,160
Watch it.
There´s so many cars.

52
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:31,435
Want me to put you down?

53
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:53,224
Where is that kid?
Where is she?

54
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,624
- Daddy!
- Oh, there she is.

55
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:02,332
Get in the seat.
Buckle up.

56
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:20,046
- Honey? Taylor.
- Hey, hey, hey!

57
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,346
You´re a rat.

58
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:57,549
When you´re slidin´ into first
and you´re feelin´ something burst

59
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,217
Diarrhea, diarrhea

60
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:03,853
When you´re slidin´ into third
and you lay a juicy turd

61
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:06,523
Diarrhea, diarrhea

62
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:09,396
When you´re slidin´ into home
and your shorts are full of foam

63
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,069
When you´re sitting in your Chevy
and your shorts are feeling heavy

64
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,378
Kevin, honey,
where did you learn that song?

65
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,539
Last summer at camp, Mom.

66
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:25,276
Ah, that was money well spent.

67
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,451
When you´re slidin´ into first
and you´re feelin´ something burst

68
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,956
Diarrhea, diarrhea

69
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:56,643
That´s what you´re gonna sleep in?
You´ll get cold.

70
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,109
Perfect.

71
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,883
Gil, Taylor isn´t feeling well.
She wants you.

72
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:08,324
- lt´s those hot dogs.
- l´ll deal with Kevin and Justin.

73
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:13,092
Hey, what do you say? Later when
the kids are asleep, l wear this outfit?

74
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,100
She´s in our bed.

75
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,173
Hi, Daddy.

76
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,138
What´s the matter, honey?
You don´t feel so good?

77
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:30,147
- You feel like you want to throw up?
- Okay.

78
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,342
Oh, my God.
Oh, Taylor, baby, sweetie.

79
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:39,222
Gil, why are you
just standing there?

80
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:43,091
l´m waiting for her head
to spin around.

81
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:06,883
Oh, can you come with me to see
Kevin´s principal on Monday?

82
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:11,355
Oh, l love it when you talk to me
about school and meetings.

83
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:14,859
- Now talk to me about shopping.
- l know. l´m sorry.

84
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,623
l just remembered now.
l´ve been meaning to ask you.

85
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:20,460
Fine. l´ll be there.

86
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:28,128
What´s the matter?

87
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,176
Nothing. l was
a little tense before, but--

88
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:34,735
No, l mean with Kevin.
Why are we going to see his principal?

89
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:38,544
Oh, because his teacher said
he´s been making that face again.

90
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:40,551
Oh, what, this?

91
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,483
Yes, the tense face.

92
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:47,582
He makes that same face
at Little League.

93
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:50,958
- You know what his teacher asked me?
- What?

94
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,965
lf we´d ever taken him
for a psychiatric evaluation.

95
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,734
- What?
- She was just asking.

96
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,442
Why? Because he makes a face?
Has she ever looked in the mirror?

97
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,708
Well, you know, the face,
the crying, the nervousness.

98
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:12,614
- They mentioned the crying?
- Yeah.

99
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:16,245
You know, he doesn´t really
finish his work.

100
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,125
Hey, we´ll talk to them on Monday.

101
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,095
Don´t worry.
l´m sure he´ll be fine.

102
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:26,755
Come here.

103
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:32,326
Where was l?

104
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,339
- Was l here?
- Yeah.

105
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:37,341
- l was there already?
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,073
That really pisses me off.

107
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,715
The kid needs a little
more attention...

108
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:52,313
so the teacher´s gonna put
a label on him: ''problem kid.''

109
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,383
Let´s find out who Kevin´s teacher
is gonna be next year...

110
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,361
and make sure it´s not
one of these hysterics!

111
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,796
You´re right, Gil.
Kevin´s great.

112
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,096
He can´t be that much of a problem.

113
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:06,729
Right. Now, if it was
my sister´s kid--

114
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:08,739
Garry.

115
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,733
There´s a kid with problems.

116
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:38,669
Hi, Garry.
You´re up so early.

117
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:40,500
Yeah.

118
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:49,513
- Where are you going?
- Out.

119
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,751
- What´s in the bag?
- Nothing.

120
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,984
The whole family´s coming tonight.
There´s a big surprise.

121
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:01,116
Grandma and Grandpa
are gonna be here.

122
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,684
Uncle Gil and Aunt Karen
are bringing their kids.

123
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:07,198
Aunt Susie´s gonna be here
and Uncle Nathan and their kids.

124
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,199
lt was nice talking to ya.

125
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,338
Julie.

126
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,903
- Hey, Julie.
- Yeah?

127
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,675
- Can l come in for a minute?
- Yeah.

128
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:27,879
l really need your help.
The whole family´s coming tonight.

129
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:31,480
- Could you just give me a hand?
- Yeah, in just a few minutes.

130
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:33,922
Are you all right?
l heard you moaning last night.

131
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:37,223
l had a stomachache,
but it´s fine now.

132
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:40,287
- You hate me?
- What?

133
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,664
For making you study so much
and giving up all your dates.

134
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:45,498
No, you were right.

135
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,336
Honey, l´m telling you,
those SAT scores are your ticket.

136
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,808
And, sweetie,
once you get to school...

137
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:56,246
you´re gonna meet a lot of guys
you like just as well as that Tod.

138
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:59,283
Why do you always say ''that Tod''?
lt sounds so--

139
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,583
You´re right. l´m sorry.
lt´s been pleasant for a moment.

140
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:07,386
l´m just gonna give everybody
spaghetti and salad...

141
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,950
and l better cook a steak
for my dad.

142
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:12,155
See you later, honey.

143
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,533
You okay?

144
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:21,301
Man, your mother can talk!

145
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,033
Gosh, she hates my ass.

146
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,409
And it´s such a cute ass.

147
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:33,308
Last night she heard the moaning.
She thought it was me.

148
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,752
So you´re gonna have to try
and control yourself, Tod.

149
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,821
With you, it´s impossible.

150
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,859
Wait. l brought something.

151
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,371
Ooh, good.

152
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:03,839
We can record our love.

153
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:06,679
Susan? Hi, sis. lt´s Helen.

154
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:09,151
Did l loan you my big platter?

155
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,918
Great. Would you bring it tonight?
l just need it to serve.

156
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:18,019
Listen, Julie got 1291
on her SAT´s.

157
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:21,888
l know.
l feel so proud of her.

158
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,527
lt´s great. How´s Patty?

159
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,538
We´re a little disappointed
with the effort...

160
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,166
she´s been giving
lately towards her work.

161
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,905
Math, French,
everything´s gone downhill.

162
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,914
Nathan´s talking to her right now.

163
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,450
He´s trying to figure out
what´s wrong.

164
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,782
Look, Patty,
all l´m saying is...

165
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:45,289
if you want to have
just an ordinary academic career...

166
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:49,020
and attend an ordinary university,
that´s your prerogative.

167
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:53,087
But l must tell you, l think
you´re selling yourself way short.

168
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:55,598
- How´s it going?
- l don´t know.

169
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:59,125
Sometimes l feel as though
we want it more than she does.

170
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,330
Patty, you know we love you.

171
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:08,107
Could you just give your father
that extra effort he´s looking for?

172
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,706
Okay, Mama.

173
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:16,086
That´s all l ask.

174
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:19,214
Come on, Kevin. l got you.

175
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,789
l want that, Kevin.

176
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:30,129
- Time to come in now, children.
- Hi, Grandma.

177
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,203
Hey, you want to--

178
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,975
- Grandma.
- Gil, you have a good memory.

179
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,774
Was it yours or Helen´s
or Susan´s wedding l got drunk at?

180
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:44,974
lt was all three, Dad.
Congratulations.

181
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,348
At which one
did l punch the bandleader?

182
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,481
That was mine.
We have photos.

183
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,887
l´m having them blown up
for the commitment hearings.

184
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:58,288
You think he´s funny, huh?
He wasn´t this funny as a kid.

185
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:03,300
Stayed in his room all day.
You were a moody son of a bitch.

186
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,697
Gee, l wonder why.

187
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,569
Do you remember that little guy
who wouldn´t leave my side?

188
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:11,574
l know.

189
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:16,012
Now if l take a step toward him,
he takes a step away.

190
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,209
l don´t know
what´s happening to him.

191
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:22,310
He´s just so unhappy,
and he won´t talk to me...

192
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:24,878
and l don´t know how to help him.

193
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:27,550
Did you ever consider
having Ed talk to him?

194
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:32,359
Are you kidding? He won´t even
acknowledge he´s got these kids...

195
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,423
now that he´s got his new wife
and his new kids.

196
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,402
He won´t even fix
my kids´ teeth anymore.

197
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,202
He says it makes him uncomfortable.

198
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:46,243
l wish he´d drop his drill
down his pants.

199
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,370
Are you seeing anybody?

200
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:53,315
Well, Garry´s biology teacher
asked me out.

201
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,377
Biology? That´s promising.

202
00:15:56,454 --> 00:16:00,117
Oh, no. He´s not the type
l usually go for.

203
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,860
''The Penal Colony'' by Franz Kafka.

204
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:08,831
Patty a doctor yet?

205
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,101
Mock if you will.

206
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:12,693
All right.

207
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:16,207
Our children are more capable of
absorbing information than we are...

208
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:19,038
yet we insist on treating them
like adorable little morons.

209
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:25,547
Are you saying Patty
can learn things l can´t learn?

210
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,646
Patty, which one of these...

211
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:34,715
is the square root of 8,649?

212
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:42,799
Ninety-three.

213
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:55,069
They´re like sponges, Gil,
just waiting to absorb.

214
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:57,046
l want this.

215
00:16:57,115 --> 00:16:58,548
You see?

216
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,515
Take my advice.
Forget about Kevin and Taylor.

217
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,987
lt´s too late.
Work on Justin.

218
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:09,925
Actually, Justin is quite bright. ln his
preschool class, he was the only--

219
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:15,726
Slow down, Justin.
l´ll get you some dip.

220
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:23,571
You remember that guy you went out
with in college, Jeffrey Sanders?

221
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:26,610
He always chased me out of the room
when he came over.

222
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,771
- Oh, yeah.
- l saw him today.

223
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,874
- God, what a loser, huh?
- ln a Rolls.

224
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,885
l meant me.

225
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,046
What is that?

226
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,091
Oh, Nathan and Patty and l
are ''power eating.''

227
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:42,319
We bring our own food everywhere.

228
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:45,191
Nathan turned me on to it,
and l never felt better.

229
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:47,458
- Where do you get that stuff?
- This is it.

230
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:50,968
Everybody in the living room.
This is the big surprise.

231
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:54,630
Oh, Larry!

232
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,139
My baby!

233
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:00,636
- You look great. Dad!
- Oh, hi, son.

234
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:03,238
Great to see you!

235
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:05,680
- Shit.
- Well put.

236
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,980
Who´s that?

237
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:10,987
That´s my kid brother Larry,
your uncle.

238
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,615
- Don´t give him any money.
- l won´t.

239
00:18:13,691 --> 00:18:17,627
Just a little something for being
the best dad in the world.

240
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:22,421
l found it a couple of months ago.
lt´s for your collection.

241
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,492
- A toy car!
- Oh, this is great!

242
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,265
A Stutz!

243
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:30,796
Yeah, if you´ve got it,
spend it on the people you love.

244
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,900
Right?

245
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:37,272
- ls this Grandma?
- Yeah, she´s still alive.

246
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:46,215
Jesus! Grandma, you got short.

247
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,758
l´m shrinking.

248
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,556
Bummer!

249
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,053
Gilbo!

250
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,027
- How long has it been? Three years?
- About that.

251
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:02,834
You stopped wearing your turban.

252
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:04,340
Yeah.

253
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,504
My God!
Susan, you look great.

254
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,673
lf you weren´t my sister--

255
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:17,180
l know it´s been hard.

256
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,155
Dad?

257
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,629
You were supposed to wait outside
so l could introduce you.

258
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,495
Well, why don´t you do it now,
Larry?

259
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,643
Everybody...

260
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,980
this is my son, Cool.

261
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:51,188
- Did he say ''Cool''?
- Cool.

262
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,885
- Your son?
- lt´s a long story.

263
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,393
Let´s eat.

264
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:03,896
Keep Patty away from my brother.
He´ll suck the intelligence out of her.

265
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:10,404
Cool is adorable. Why didn´t you
ever write us you had a son?

266
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,376
l didn´t know myself
until a couple of months ago.

267
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,208
See...

268
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,739
a few years ago l was living
in Vegas with this girl.

269
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:23,685
A showgirl. She was
in that show, ''Elvis On lce.''

270
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,280
Anyway, we drifted apart...

271
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:29,485
as people do
in these complicated times...

272
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,929
and then a couple of months ago,
she shows up with Cool, tells me...

273
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:38,992
''You watch him. l shot someone.
l have to leave the country.''

274
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:43,563
That´s a parent?

275
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,267
Anyway...

276
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:49,404
we´re back in town because l´ve got
something really huge cooking.

277
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,143
Enormous. Monster.
Dad, this is it.

278
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:56,186
From now on, l´m gonna be
taking care of all of you.

279
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:59,621
This isn´t another get-rich-quick
scheme, is it, Larry?

280
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,489
What´s wrong
with getting rich quick?

281
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,155
Quick is the best way to get rich.
Look who l´m talking to.

282
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,164
You ever see her family?

283
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:12,498
They find a nickel, they huddle together
and bury it like squirrels.

284
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,004
What´s the deal, son?
What do you have going?

285
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:20,135
Has anyone heard of hydroponics?

286
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:21,678
Well, that´s great!

287
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:26,240
Hydroponics is the growing
of plants without soil.

288
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:30,276
What are you using? Coarse sand
or suspension hydroponics?

289
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,845
l don´t--

290
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:37,691
There´s a guy with a lab coat that
makes that decision. l make the deal.

291
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:42,324
And l got to thinking,
Cool´s had no kind of life, no family.

292
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,598
So while l´m locking this down,
l thought we would stay with you.

293
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,605
- With us?
- A couple of weeks.

294
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:53,474
The thing is, we don´t have
the big house anymore, you know.

295
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:56,945
We just have the one bedroom for us
and one for Grandma.

296
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,745
Grandma´s welcome
to stay with us for a while.

297
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:03,116
lt´d be valuable for Patty to have
a multigenerational influence.

298
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,749
Fine with me.

299
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:09,020
Well, l´ll have to give you
a list of her medications--

300
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,561
and you´ll have to pick up
her shower chair.

301
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:15,224
There´s her hearing aid batteries,
magnifying glass for reading.

302
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,732
Oh, geez.

303
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:19,736
- What happened?
- Your mouth used up all the power.

304
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,965
Don´t worry, Dad.
We can still find the bar.

305
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,838
- l´ll get a flashlight.
- l´ll get it, sis.

306
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:27,434
- Where is it? ln the bedroom?
- lt´s in the nightstand.

307
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,707
Mom, Dad, what happened?

308
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,607
- You know l don´t like it in the dark.
- This is a blackout.

309
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:36,915
lt´s a temporary interruption
in the home´s electrical supply.

310
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,478
Something´s busted.

311
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:40,888
Where´s the switch?

312
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,490
- Bring it here.
- Oh, here it is.

313
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:47,190
What is this?

314
00:22:56,808 --> 00:23:01,336
- Mommy, what was that?
- That was an electric ear cleaner.

315
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:05,143
- lt was kind of big.
- lt sure was!

316
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:11,783
l don´t think we really
have to worry about him.

317
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:14,324
The point is, once they see us
they´ll realize...

318
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,327
that we´re fine
and the kid is fine.

319
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:31,608
l think we have to be very careful
about Kevin´s educational environment.

320
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,268
Absolutely.

321
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:36,939
With that in mind, l don´t think
Kevin should come back here next fall.

322
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:40,576
l recommend that he
be transferred to a school...

323
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,814
that offers
special education classes.

324
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,851
You mean,
because he´s so smart?

325
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:53,158
Well, actually, l mean a class
for children with emotional problems.

326
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:59,695
Hi. l´m sorry l´m late.

327
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,898
You must be the Buckmans.
l´m Dr. Jeffrey Lucas.

328
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,238
Dr. Lucas is a child psychologist.

329
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:08,710
He´s been observing Kevin
for the last couple of months.

330
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:11,981
Why?

331
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:18,047
Mr. Buckman, this is a public school.
Thirty-eight kids to a class.

332
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:21,216
We estimate that Kevin´s teacher
spent at least...

333
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:24,591
20% of her time dealing with Kevin.

334
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:28,758
That class is going to finish
the year behind. lt isn´t fair.

335
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:34,032
Kevin is a very sweet, sensitive,
extremely tense little boy.

336
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,699
He needs some special attention.

337
00:24:38,576 --> 00:24:40,737
- lt´s ´cause he was first.
- Hmm?

338
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:43,177
lt´s because he was our first.

339
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:46,307
l mean, l think we were very tense
when Kevin was little.

340
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,319
lf he got a scratch,
we were hysterical.

341
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:53,050
By the third kid, you know,
you let them juggle knives.

342
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,457
On the other hand, Kevin may
have been like this in the womb.

343
00:24:56,527 --> 00:25:00,258
Recent studies indicate that
these things are all chemical.

344
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:02,959
She smoked grass.

345
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:08,870
- l never smoked when l was pregnant.
- ln college, you were like a chimney--

346
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,805
Fifteen years ago.

347
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,900
There could have been
some chromosome distortion.

348
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:15,411
Well, you let them do anything.

349
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:18,380
You let them watch TV
just like that.

350
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:23,887
So we´ll put the TV´s in the garbage,
and we´ll perform Shakespeare--

351
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:31,756
l´m sorry.

352
00:25:33,397 --> 00:25:36,093
l´m just a little
thrown off by this.

353
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:44,574
You should not look upon Kevin´s
going to a special school...

354
00:25:44,642 --> 00:25:47,167
as any kind of failure
on your part.

355
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:50,074
No, l´ll blame the dog.

356
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:54,951
ln an educational environment
that´s more sensitive to his needs.

357
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:58,352
First of all, Kevin is not going
to a special school.

358
00:25:58,422 --> 00:26:01,084
Whether it´s right or not,
there´s a stigma.

359
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:03,092
Children are cruel.

360
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,618
l won´t subject Kevin
to that kind of cruelty.

361
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:10,890
lf we have to, we´ll send him
to a private school.

362
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:14,199
l don´t care what it costs.
l´ll get a second job.

363
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:19,141
Mr. and Mrs. Buckman,
this problem won´t just go away.

364
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,112
lf we need to, we´ll send Kevin
to a private therapist.

365
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,344
That´s right. Look, it´s a problem.
We´re aware of it.

366
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:30,148
But we´re his parents.
We can handle it.

367
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:36,852
Well, the next school year
is four months off...

368
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:41,387
so let´s see
what can be accomplished, hmm?

369
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:51,967
- l need to see.
- No, not in the street.

370
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,476
Please.

371
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:05,448
What is this?

372
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,287
lt´s the party celebrating
my mother´s promotion at the bank.

373
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,188
Excuse me. This is the wrong batch.
This is my mother´s.

374
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,202
There should be another envelope
for Buckman.

375
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:26,538
That was picked up already.

376
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,771
By who?

377
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:57,965
l, l, l think this one
is my favorite.

378
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,475
This is just--

379
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:01,909
lt was just for fun, Mom.

380
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:05,039
Well, l´m glad to know
it´s not a job.

381
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:08,984
lt´s that Tod, isn´t it?
There´s one where you can see his face.

382
00:28:09,053 --> 00:28:13,012
Does it bother you that l did those
things or that l did them with Tod?

383
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,856
Gee whiz, Julie. There´s so many things
that bother me about this...

384
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:19,020
l don´t know how to separate them.

385
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:23,199
Whoo! Here´s something
for my wallet.

386
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:25,360
Tod is very important to me.

387
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:28,098
And we´ve got the pictures
to prove it.

388
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:30,106
- Mom.
- This is your room.

389
00:28:30,174 --> 00:28:33,701
You did these things
right here in my house?

390
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,305
Well, l thought someone in
this house ought to be having sex.

391
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:40,578
l mean, with something
that doesn´t require batteries.

392
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:45,587
What did you say to me?
Goddamn it! You get back here!

393
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:48,716
Open this door!
Goddamn it to hell!

394
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,261
l would just like a little respect!

395
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,558
Not a lot, just a little!

396
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,794
Do you know why l´m having sex
with machinery?

397
00:28:56,867 --> 00:29:01,304
Because your father left to have a party
and l stayed to raise two kids!

398
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,999
l have no life!

399
00:29:03,073 --> 00:29:07,601
Goddamn it!
What are you doing?

400
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:10,078
l´m leaving before we say things
we´ll regret.

401
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:12,980
You´re gonna say something worse
than the battery remark?

402
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,483
Tod and l are in love.

403
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:18,116
lt´s not ''going steady'' love.
lt´s love.

404
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,714
l need him. He´s my life.

405
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:23,419
He touches me, and l quiver.

406
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:26,292
Oh, would you give me
just a small break?

407
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:28,297
See? You can´t handle it.

408
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:32,301
Tod´s working now. We´ll find
a place to live somewhere.

409
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:36,139
- Hi, Garry.
- Hi.

410
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,141
- l´m moving out, Garry.
- Bye.

411
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:41,010
You´ve upset your brother!

412
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,570
Julie, l´m telling you...

413
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:49,017
if you walk out of this house,
don´t ever think about coming back.

414
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:50,519
Fine.

415
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:12,268
Honey, l´m always here
if you need me. Sweetheart!

416
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:16,302
Honey, be careful.
lf you want anything, just call me!

417
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,516
Bye.

418
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:26,822
Oh, man!

419
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:31,093
lncredible!
Just incredible!

420
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:34,619
l knew you´d be the one
who´d appreciate this.

421
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:40,600
Three years, every night, every weekend,
l had dinner out here.

422
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:44,163
Yeah, it was a piece of junk
when l found it.

423
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:47,677
First time l got laid
was in a car like this.

424
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:50,844
- Frank?
- What?

425
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,746
Cool just finished lunch.

426
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:54,750
l´ll call the newspaper.

427
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:59,481
l thought you and Larry
could take him somewhere.

428
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,185
l am showing Larry my car.

429
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:05,422
Just plop him in front of the TV.
That´s what he always does.

430
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,963
Wasn´t that Super Bowl incredible
right down to the last minute?

431
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,470
Amazing.

432
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:17,063
They´re usually not that close.

433
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:20,338
And usually the winning team
covers the point spread.

434
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,641
Usually, you can count on it.

435
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:25,739
- Take a beating?
- No, thanks. l already took one.

436
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,388
Anyway, l had to pay off,
and it´s left me a little--

437
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:41,330
- What do you need?
- Huh?

438
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:45,664
Aw, come on. Don´t insult me.
l didn´t come here to be insulted.

439
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:47,397
Come on.

440
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:51,532
Puttin´ together a deal, you gotta look
like you can piss with the big boys.

441
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:55,271
You see? You know.

442
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:57,713
How much?

443
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,949
A couple thousand.
Three, tops.

444
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:03,782
- Three?
- Tops.

445
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:23,169
Good. See, Grandma,
Patty studies Eastern philosophy.

446
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,505
Our future leaders will have to be much
more in tune with the Oriental mind.

447
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,011
Okay, sweetie, one more time.

448
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,843
- Nathan, guess what?
- Oh, you´re home early.

449
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:34,782
- l have good news.
- What?

450
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,593
What´s up?

451
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:47,461
l´m going to teach summer school.
We´ll have vacation money.

452
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:49,123
Oh, that´s great.

453
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:53,268
Mexico.

454
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,364
Gil and Karen will watch Patty.
l just want to call them.

455
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:03,406
Gee, honey, l´m really not too pro
on Patty spending a week with Gil.

456
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,708
Why not?

457
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,774
l´m a little concerned
about his jocularity.

458
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:09,443
He´s a wonderful guy.

459
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,920
lt´s just he´s
a little lighthearted...

460
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:16,323
about things that l--
that we consider important.

461
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:20,124
She has fun over there.
You know, she scampers.

462
00:33:20,197 --> 00:33:21,858
She cavorts.

463
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:24,958
Hey, try this.
We take Patty with us.

464
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:26,468
To Mexico?

465
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,700
lt´s a perfect opportunity
to start her on Spanish.

466
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:34,674
lt´ll be fun.

467
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:39,842
Nathan, l thought it would be nice
if you and l could be alone.

468
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,148
We will be.
We´ll get two rooms.

469
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:50,117
Which one will l be in?

470
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:54,823
That means ''come here'' in Spanish.

471
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,069
Please. l want you
to listen to something.

472
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:01,161
l´ve got a tape
of a mariachi band.

473
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:05,800
An authentic indigenous
native Mexican form of music.

474
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,324
- Gil, good morning.
- Hello, Cindy.

475
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:32,468
When were you gonna tell me?

476
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,803
Tell you what?

477
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,067
Lenny called this morning.

478
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:40,508
He wondered where we should take Phil
Richards to celebrate his partnership.

479
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:43,637
That Lenny is an asshole.
You believe that guy?

480
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:47,343
Nobody was supposed to have
that information until next month.

481
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,351
That partnership is mine.

482
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:52,877
You said when Ted got back,
you´d make it official.

483
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:57,552
Look, l never said you didn´t do
great work. You do terrific work.

484
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,062
Every firm does good work.

485
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,624
l know you´re smarter than Phil,
but the guy works like a Trojan.

486
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:07,864
He schmoozes clients.
He brings in business.

487
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:09,872
He´s here nights, weekends.

488
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,933
l own the guy. And that´s
what puts your name on the door.

489
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:17,139
This is really coming
out of left field.

490
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:20,479
l´ve been here eight years.
l´m the backbone of the operation.

491
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,212
l know that.

492
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:26,552
lf l don´t get this partnership,
l gotta think about going elsewhere.

493
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:31,287
- That´s not realistic.
- Why?

494
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:33,625
You go somewhere else,
you´re gonna have to get in line...

495
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:37,394
behind guys who are younger,
who have been there longer...

496
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:42,166
who are more committed
and are willing to work for less money.

497
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:51,139
Look, this thing with Phil
is not etched in stone.

498
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:54,649
l can jerk him along
for the next month.

499
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:57,482
Why don´t you use that time
to give us your best shot?

500
00:35:57,554 --> 00:35:59,988
Put in the hours.
Dazzle me.

501
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:02,924
Dazzle you?

502
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:12,527
Listen, Dave.
l´m having a problem at home.

503
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,970
l really need to spend
a lot of extra time with my son.

504
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:18,735
Then l don´t know what we can do.

505
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,070
Get this guy. Yeah, yeah.

506
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:30,183
Oh, well. They´re bad dudes. That´s
why they call the game ''Bad Dudes.''

507
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,688
l should go stay with the girls.
Got enough quarters?

508
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:37,923
- Dad?
- Yeah?

509
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:41,259
How come l´m seeing
a psychiatrist?

510
00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:47,728
We were gonna have
a big talk about that.

511
00:36:47,804 --> 00:36:50,932
- What´s wrong with me?
- Nothing.

512
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,306
- You´re great.
- Then how come--

513
00:36:57,447 --> 00:37:01,349
You´re a kid like l was.
You have a lot of worries. That´s all.

514
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:06,185
And these doctors are experts
at helping people with their worries.

515
00:37:06,256 --> 00:37:08,349
lt´s nothing to feel bad about.

516
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,891
You´re a great kid,
and l love you very much, okay?

517
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:22,361
Hey, you know what l think?
This is gonna be a great summer for you.

518
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:24,907
And don´t forget
you got a birthday coming up.

519
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:27,205
Let´s have a great party.

520
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:28,938
Can we have Cowboy Dan?

521
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:30,877
- Who?
- Cowboy Dan.

522
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:34,816
The gun-fighting balloon man.
He was at Billy´s party. He´s cool.

523
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,944
Absolutely.
lt´s a done deal.

524
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,716
This is your dad talking.
Now you´ve got me excited.

525
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:43,856
Now, what do we say when we see
a cute eight-year-old girl?

526
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,360
Hubba-hubba.

527
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:51,560
Don´t tell your mom l taught you that.
lt could be bad. Let´s go.

528
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,330
Wow!

529
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:01,701
- You like it?
- Yeah.

530
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:05,179
- lt´s good. lt´s shiny.
- Yeah.

531
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:08,081
And you know,
it was junk when l found it.

532
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:12,187
The first time l got laid
was in a car--

533
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:14,485
That´s a story for another time.

534
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:29,098
Hi, Dad.
Dinner ready?

535
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:30,935
What was that?

536
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:35,877
Huh? Oh, some friends
who were just dropping me off.

537
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,347
Friends? Friends slow down.
They even stop.

538
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,412
Sweetie, you´re gonna be okay.

539
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,521
Honey, why would you
be panhandling?

540
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:22,389
l needed money
for a place to stay.

541
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:24,393
You have a place to stay.

542
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:27,362
l´d have to tell you what happened.

543
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:30,457
- What did happen?
- l don´t want to tell you.

544
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,059
- Did you leave that Tod?
- Yes.

545
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:37,568
He promised me he was gonna start
a house-painting business.

546
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,166
Then he said he changed his mind.

547
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:43,406
He´s gonna race dragsters
with his brothers.

548
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,108
He can´t even drive a regular car.

549
00:39:47,517 --> 00:39:50,611
So his brothers came over,
and we got in a fight.

550
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:55,351
He said, ''No bitch is gonna
tell me what to do for a living.''

551
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,256
He told me he loved me.

552
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:02,764
Sweetie.

553
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:06,335
They say that...

554
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:10,398
and then they come.

555
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:13,443
Honey, what can you expect
from a kid like that?

556
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:18,243
Mom, back off. The last guy
you dated stole our furniture.

557
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,144
- Men are scum.
- l know.

558
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,316
l know, sweetie.
Men are scum.

559
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:43,505
- Honey, Julie´s home.
- Great.

560
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:51,114
Come on. Let´s go eat
lots of ice cream.

561
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,776
You want an ice-cream soda?

562
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:59,117
How about a hot fudge sundae?

563
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:01,680
You want a banana split?

564
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:04,249
Do you want something
like french fries?

565
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:06,261
- Yes.
- You do?

566
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,833
l thought l´d find you here.

567
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,802
Does that make you Sherlock Holmes?
l live here.

568
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,098
You live with me.

569
00:41:16,072 --> 00:41:17,562
l wouldn´t live with you...

570
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,166
if the world were flooded with piss
and you lived in a tree.

571
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:22,143
l´m going to the movies.

572
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:25,079
You´re not leaving here
till you hear what l have to say.

573
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:28,606
l´m not--
Let go of me!

574
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:30,915
- Let her go!
- Just listen to me.

575
00:41:30,987 --> 00:41:34,650
Let her go!
Goddamn it! Let her go!

576
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:36,988
Please, Mrs. Buckman.
l love her.

577
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,223
You can´t run out on me.
You´re my wife.

578
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:43,425
lf you don´t let her go,
l´m gonna call the-- His what?

579
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:49,996
His wife. We got married
a couple of days ago.

580
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:52,303
Are you out of your mind?

581
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:54,309
Please, Mrs. Buckman.

582
00:41:55,111 --> 00:41:57,204
Julie, l didn´t mean it.

583
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,243
l´m sorry.

584
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,775
My brothers were ragging on me,
and l couldn´t back down.

585
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:08,756
But last night, l told them.
They mean nothing.

586
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,395
You mean everything.

587
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,859
Christ!

588
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:23,565
Okay, look lively.
You´re doing great.

589
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,165
Shortstop, here it goes.
All right, pick it up.

590
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,041
Easy now, over to first.
That´s the way to play.

591
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:31,774
That´s right. You´re beautiful.

592
00:42:31,848 --> 00:42:34,180
You´re a bunch of
wild, young Bohemians.

593
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,719
Let´s go again.
Second base, here we go.

594
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:39,778
Get down on it. Don´t be afraid.
lt can´t hurt you. Here we go.

595
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:41,847
Get down on it!

596
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:47,329
Wayne, get Ben some ice.

597
00:42:47,397 --> 00:42:50,332
All right, we´re gonna need
a new second base man.

598
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,392
Which one of you outfielders
wants to try second base?

599
00:42:55,805 --> 00:42:58,865
How about you, Kevin?
You want to try second base?

600
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:03,177
All right!

601
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:09,014
Oh, Matt, none of that.
Let´s be a team.

602
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:10,518
Get out there and hustle.

603
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,196
Remember, the word is ''fun.''

604
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:23,061
So just go on out there...

605
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,966
and what you catch you catch
and what you miss you miss.

606
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,526
Okay, Dad.

607
00:43:39,015 --> 00:43:41,006
Way to go, Kevin!

608
00:43:55,498 --> 00:43:59,696
And now it is my great pleasure
to introduce our valedictorian...

609
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:02,529
Kevin Buckman.

610
00:44:19,622 --> 00:44:21,385
Thank you.

611
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:25,861
When l was nine years old,
l had kind of a rough time.

612
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,864
A lot of people thought
l was pretty mixed up.

613
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:32,163
But there was one person
who got me through it.

614
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:34,635
He did everything right.

615
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:37,229
And thanks to him, today...

616
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,640
l´m the happiest,
most confident...

617
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:43,803
and most well-adjusted person
in this world.

618
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:47,973
Dad, l love you.

619
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,420
You´re the greatest.

620
00:45:16,312 --> 00:45:17,745
All right!

621
00:45:18,915 --> 00:45:23,443
One more out, guys! Let´s go!
ls your arm tired, Shaun?

622
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:29,821
Hey, Gil, our boys
finally gonna win one game?

623
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,157
Way to be supportive, Lou.

624
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,461
That´s right, Kevin!

625
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,303
Way to go, Tommy!
All right!

626
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,276
We got bases loaded.
We´re only one run down.

627
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:50,278
You can do it.
Get up there.

628
00:45:51,214 --> 00:45:53,239
Please, God,
let ´em win one game.

629
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,380
Got it!

630
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,432
You stink, Buckman!

631
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:22,209
- He had no business being out there!
- What´s the matter with you?

632
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,543
lt´s terrible!

633
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:44,592
Why´d you make me play
second base?

634
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:06,220
Someone´s climbed to the roof
of the bell tower with a rifle!

635
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:10,521
lt´s Kevin Buckman.
His father totally screwed him up.

636
00:47:10,593 --> 00:47:12,618
What´s he yelling?

637
00:47:12,695 --> 00:47:15,858
You made me play second base!

638
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:20,560
Kevin, l´m sorry.
l did the best l could.

639
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:26,540
Nice shot, son.
lt´s important to be supportive.

640
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:29,043
Come on. Let´s sing
one of the old tunes.

641
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:32,013
When you´re sliding into home
and your pants are full of foam

642
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:33,514
Diarrhea

643
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:00,875
Well?

644
00:48:02,178 --> 00:48:04,612
Why are you pouring water
through my diaphragm?

645
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,239
To check.

646
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:09,683
To see if it´s okay.
You didn´t know l did that, huh?

647
00:48:09,752 --> 00:48:12,687
Obviously not,
or you wouldn´t have tried this.

648
00:48:12,755 --> 00:48:15,690
Are you accusing me
of making that hole?

649
00:48:15,758 --> 00:48:18,693
No, a woodpecker came in here,
went into the bathroom...

650
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:22,595
opened the drawer with his wing
and pecked holes in your diaphragm.

651
00:48:22,665 --> 00:48:26,294
l can´t believe you would jeopardize
our plan. Remember what we read?

652
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:29,099
A majority of exceptional people
are either only children...

653
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,970
or firstborns
with five years between sibs.

654
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:34,305
- We agreed--
- No, you agreed.

655
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:37,403
And they´re not sibs.
They´re babies, and l want another one.

656
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,473
So this is how you go about it?
By vandalizing your contraception?

657
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:45,214
- Because you won´t discuss it!
- We discussed this years ago!

658
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:46,721
l think we were wrong.

659
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:49,883
l think we were right,
and l´m not discussing it again.

660
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:55,063
- Tod?
- Yeah?

661
00:48:55,131 --> 00:48:57,827
- Do you want me to make breakfast?
- No, thanks, Helen.

662
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,427
- Julie´s gonna do it.
- l´ll get the fire extinguisher.

663
00:49:01,504 --> 00:49:05,907
l´ll see you guys at dinner.
Sweet Jesus!

664
00:49:05,975 --> 00:49:09,536
What are you doing?
Are you joining the Marines?

665
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,913
l knew you´d make
a thing out of this, Mom.

666
00:49:15,685 --> 00:49:18,153
Just clean up the hair.

667
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:29,056
You ready?
Want anything to eat?

668
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,259
How long are they
gonna be living here?

669
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:33,268
Not much longer, l think.

670
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:40,132
l was just thinking.
lt´s getting pretty crowded here.

671
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:44,236
lt´s not so crowded. There´s a lot
more room since they shaved their heads.

672
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,449
l was just thinking...

673
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:51,076
maybe l could stay with Dad
for a while.

674
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,084
What?

675
00:49:57,293 --> 00:50:02,230
l´ve been here a long time. Maybe
l should live with him for a while.

676
00:50:02,298 --> 00:50:04,994
You wanna live with your father?

677
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:08,536
Kind of.

678
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:15,808
Have you talked to your father
about that?

679
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:21,773
No. Not yet. l thought l´d call him.

680
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:23,284
Honey...

681
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:28,249
you don´t know
your father like l do.

682
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:31,919
l don´t know him at all.
What´s his number?

683
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,433
He´d be at work now.

684
00:50:42,505 --> 00:50:44,166
So that´s...

685
00:50:45,341 --> 00:50:47,935
2-0-6...

686
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:51,173
5-7-9-0.

687
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,893
ls Dr. Lampkin there?

688
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:08,588
His son.

689
00:51:15,638 --> 00:51:20,132
No, Dad, it´s not Joey.
lt´s Garry, your other son.

690
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,475
l need to ask you something.

691
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:26,640
lt´ll just take a second.

692
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:34,414
Would it be okay
if l stay with you for a while?

693
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,818
A few months.

694
00:51:58,548 --> 00:51:59,981
Shit.

695
00:52:08,591 --> 00:52:10,855
He didn´t think
it was such a good idea.

696
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:14,055
- Sweetie--
- l´ve gotta go.

697
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:46,158
When´s Cowboy Dan, the gun-fighting
balloon man, gonna be here?

698
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,493
lsn´t that him?

699
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:50,862
That´s the schmuck
who brought the horse.

700
00:52:50,933 --> 00:52:55,199
- l don´t think he´s coming.
- Of course, he is. He´s a professional.

701
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:59,469
You think he wants to put a blot on
the entire balloon-bending profession?

702
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:02,636
Go on and have fun. We´ll have
burgers and dogs in a second.

703
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:05,146
Let´s go watch the horse shit.

704
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,088
Why don´t you play with Justin?

705
00:53:13,155 --> 00:53:15,953
l don´t understand what he´s doing.

706
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:18,323
He´s spinning.

707
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:20,328
What for?

708
00:53:20,396 --> 00:53:22,330
No reason. Just for fun.

709
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,497
Doesn´t look like fun.

710
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,671
lt isn´t.

711
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,699
You tried it?

712
00:53:39,515 --> 00:53:42,143
So does Julie have a nice place?

713
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:47,087
Yeah, she has a lovely place.
She has my place.

714
00:53:47,156 --> 00:53:49,750
She and that Tod are both
living in my house.

715
00:53:49,825 --> 00:53:52,123
Really?

716
00:53:52,194 --> 00:53:55,061
Actually, it was my idea.

717
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:59,192
Otherwise, she was gonna quit school
and get a job.

718
00:53:59,268 --> 00:54:03,432
Maybe this way
she´ll still go to college.

719
00:54:04,974 --> 00:54:07,169
Here we go.
The thumb trick. Ready?

720
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,575
Here´s my thumb. Watch it.

721
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,910
- What are you doing?
- The thumb trick. Show her, Dad.

722
00:54:18,854 --> 00:54:22,415
Okay, but this is the last time.
Here we go. Ready?

723
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:39,337
l mean, Justin is gonna
go full-time next year...

724
00:54:39,408 --> 00:54:44,072
so everybody´s askin´ when l´m gonna
go back to work like l´m supposed to.

725
00:54:44,146 --> 00:54:48,708
And l´m thinkin´ about it.
l mean, l used to work. lt was okay.

726
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:53,881
But l think l´m better at this.
l think l´m sort of good at it, so--

727
00:54:53,956 --> 00:54:58,484
But then people make me feel embarrassed
like l don´t have goals or something.

728
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:03,498
Like l sit around here eating bonbons
all day, right? Oh, l don´t know.

729
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,500
What does Gil say?

730
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:09,129
He says l should do whatever l want.
l could have killed him for that.

731
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,139
What are you so upset about?

732
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:14,472
Nathan, she´s weird.
She´s a weird child.

733
00:55:14,543 --> 00:55:17,068
l think a few days a week
of preschool could be very helpful.

734
00:55:17,146 --> 00:55:19,876
This is not the right age for Patty
to be socially activated.

735
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:25,285
She´s not a bomb. She´s a little kid who
has no ability to relate to other kids.

736
00:55:25,354 --> 00:55:27,584
You want her to relate to him?

737
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,418
Help, help, help!

738
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:34,054
When l met him, l was a little wild.

739
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,530
l was a little out of control.

740
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,762
He kind of took me in hand.

741
00:55:39,835 --> 00:55:43,669
l liked that.
He´s very commanding.

742
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:48,005
He got me into teaching.
He got my shit together.

743
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:50,511
Boy, he really turned me on.

744
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:52,911
Really? l mean, of course, really.

745
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,473
Nathan and l used to be hot.

746
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:59,385
l know he doesn´t look it,
but we were like rabbits.

747
00:55:59,455 --> 00:56:03,721
l used to give him, you know...

748
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:07,889
oral, you know, on the highway.

749
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:10,093
What?

750
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:13,135
He was always trying
to get a research grant.

751
00:56:15,137 --> 00:56:17,503
And you thought that would help?

752
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:21,509
No, but, l mean,
he kept getting turned down.

753
00:56:21,577 --> 00:56:23,511
He´d get real, real tense.

754
00:56:24,947 --> 00:56:28,678
So if l saw him getting
really tense, l´d just...

755
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:31,584
lean over while
he was driving and l´d--

756
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,785
l just spoke to your mother. Grandmother
wants to stay at Helen´s for a while.

757
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:39,794
- Can you drive her there tomorrow?
- Sure.

758
00:56:56,178 --> 00:56:58,874
He likes to butt things
with his head.

759
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,409
How proud you must be.

760
00:57:06,522 --> 00:57:10,049
Here it is. Now it´s right there
in front of you. Be careful.

761
00:57:20,469 --> 00:57:23,131
Here. Take this off.

762
00:57:24,206 --> 00:57:26,766
Now really try and hit it.

763
00:57:26,842 --> 00:57:29,242
Really give it a good shot.

764
00:57:29,311 --> 00:57:31,370
Give it a good whack!

765
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:33,915
Put your shoulder into it
and whack it.

766
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,952
Now just kill it. Kill it!

767
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:19,091
When l was born,
Grover Cleveland was president.

768
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,763
l´m sorry l´m late.

769
00:58:26,735 --> 00:58:28,498
Where should l do it?

770
00:58:29,805 --> 00:58:32,399
Who are you,
and what are you going to do?

771
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:35,467
l´m from Party Time Entertainment.

772
00:58:35,544 --> 00:58:37,739
l´m your stripper.

773
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:42,512
What´s the birthday boy´s name,
because l paint it across my breasts?

774
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:52,218
lt was a mix-up. l got Cowboy Dan´s
card, and he got mine. l´m sorry.

775
00:58:52,294 --> 00:58:55,092
Wait a minute. What about Cowboy Dan?
He is coming?

776
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:58,031
He showed up at the Lodge Hall,
and they were expecting me.

777
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,729
They beat him severely,
so Cowboy Dan ain´t coming.

778
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:04,534
Cowboy Dan´s not coming?

779
00:59:05,507 --> 00:59:08,067
- Hold it together.
- l knew it.

780
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:09,872
l told you.

781
00:59:09,945 --> 00:59:13,278
All the kids are gonna hate me.
lt´s gonna be just like Little League.

782
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,182
- Cowboy Dan is coming.
- Gil?

783
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:20,211
He´s coming!
Cowboy Dan is coming!

784
00:59:36,805 --> 00:59:38,670
Howdy, partner.

785
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:41,369
You´re Kevin´s father.
You´re not Cowboy Dan.

786
00:59:43,345 --> 00:59:47,475
That´s right.
They call me Cowboy Gil...

787
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:49,813
as in guilty.

788
00:59:54,323 --> 00:59:59,192
l saw Cowboy Dan.
l didn´t like the look on his face.

789
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:02,321
lt was like this, so l killed him.

790
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:05,196
l blew a hole in him this big.

791
01:00:08,337 --> 01:00:11,738
Actually it was about this big.

792
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:16,700
You know, when l think about it,
that hole was about this big.

793
01:00:19,581 --> 01:00:22,607
And his guts were spilled out
all over the floor.

794
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:27,947
As l was walkin´ away,
l slip around on his guts.

795
01:00:28,023 --> 01:00:32,050
A couple of other people came by
and started slippin´ on his guts too.

796
01:00:34,363 --> 01:00:39,027
After l blow a hole in somebody
and slip around on their guts...

797
01:00:39,101 --> 01:00:44,368
afterwards, l always like
to make balloon animals.

798
01:00:47,676 --> 01:00:50,645
That´s mighty courteous of you.

799
01:00:56,685 --> 01:00:58,619
Here we go!

800
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,635
- What´s he doing?
- l don´t know.

801
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,843
Your lower intestines.

802
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:51,302
Why, you little lily-livered--

803
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:56,375
Where´s Cowboy Gil?

804
01:01:56,445 --> 01:01:58,777
Ambush, ya little four-footers!

805
01:02:19,234 --> 01:02:20,929
And here it is.

806
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:26,407
lt´s made with a quart of milk,
two cups of sugar and three cow pies.

807
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:29,808
Will you get down off the horse
before you hurt yourself?

808
01:02:29,878 --> 01:02:31,971
Honey, l gotta make a big exit.

809
01:02:32,047 --> 01:02:35,983
That´s Cowboy Gil´s woman.
Take a bow, little lady.

810
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:41,212
l sure hope that
when l mosey back this way one day...

811
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,123
you don´t mind
if l stop in and say hello.

812
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:48,061
l gotta mosey
on back to Abilene.

813
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,792
Keep your powder and your pants dry.

814
01:02:50,866 --> 01:02:55,997
Kevin, l hope this is
the best danged birthday you ever had.

815
01:02:56,805 --> 01:02:58,432
Adios, buckaroos!

816
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:13,614
Don´t try and follow me to Abilene.

817
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:03,838
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.

818
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,840
Did you have a nice birthday?

819
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:09,036
- Dad was funny.
- He sure was.

820
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:12,603
Well, good night,
nine-year-old boy.

821
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:19,248
Happy birthday, kiddo.

822
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:21,346
- Dad?
- Yeah?

823
01:04:22,257 --> 01:04:25,124
When l grow up,
can l work where you work?

824
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:26,683
Why?

825
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:29,925
That way we can still
see each other every day.

826
01:04:38,907 --> 01:04:41,603
Good night. l love you.

827
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,611
l love you too.

828
01:04:46,748 --> 01:04:49,273
- Mom?
- What?

829
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:51,182
Hubba-hubba.

830
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:27,670
- Let me outta here!
- Hello, Helen?

831
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:31,504
The door was unlocked.

832
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,309
Oh, my God.

833
01:07:33,381 --> 01:07:37,283
- What channel is this?
- No, Gran, this is a tape.

834
01:07:37,352 --> 01:07:41,118
She needs a man. Now.

835
01:07:41,189 --> 01:07:44,386
This isn´t mine.
l don´t watch this.

836
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:52,032
What´s everybody doing in here?
Did you break my lock?

837
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,967
Susie, Gran,
would you please go to my room?

838
01:07:55,036 --> 01:07:56,333
Sure.

839
01:07:56,404 --> 01:08:01,808
One of those men reminded me
of your grandpa. God bless him.

840
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:05,377
- Listen.
- How could you break my lock?

841
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:08,678
l came in here because
l was afraid you were on drugs.

842
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,684
Why would you think that?

843
01:08:10,752 --> 01:08:12,811
Because of what you did
to your father´s office.

844
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:14,685
What do you mean?

845
01:08:14,756 --> 01:08:20,285
He found your hammer. Those were
your initials burned into the handle.

846
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:23,525
- Someone must have taken it.
- Just don´t--

847
01:08:23,598 --> 01:08:26,658
Honey, all these feelings--

848
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:29,568
You´re right to have
all these feelings.

849
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:35,234
You´re a great kid, honey.

850
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:38,507
You just got a lousy dad.

851
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:41,572
You´ve just got to learn to say,
''The hell with him.''

852
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:49,947
Actually, that´s good advice
for both of us. The hell with him!

853
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:59,133
l don´t know what to say
about the tapes.

854
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:02,932
l assume you´re watching these...

855
01:09:03,004 --> 01:09:05,837
because you´re curious about sex...

856
01:09:05,907 --> 01:09:07,875
you know, or filmmaking.

857
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:13,037
ls there anything
you´d like to ask?

858
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,415
Who?

859
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:19,278
Me.

860
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:26,449
No, l don´t blame you.
What about Uncle Gil?

861
01:09:26,528 --> 01:09:28,519
He´s busy with his own kids.

862
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:35,096
-Where´s my wife?
-School. She´s at cheerleading practice.

863
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,798
Bitchin´. So what´s up?

864
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:47,807
Would you like to speak to Tod?

865
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,866
Can l speak frankly?
No holds barred?

866
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:09,801
Please.

867
01:10:10,872 --> 01:10:13,602
That is one messed-up little dude.

868
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:17,610
Sure we can talk straight?

869
01:10:26,521 --> 01:10:31,686
A few months ago, Garry got
his first boner. You know what that is?

870
01:10:32,961 --> 01:10:34,553
lf memory serves.

871
01:10:34,629 --> 01:10:38,998
Great. Anyway,
since then he´s been--

872
01:10:41,469 --> 01:10:44,905
Slappin´ the salami.
No offense.

873
01:10:46,808 --> 01:10:51,108
Apparently he´s goin´ for
a world record. Chicken´s burnin´.

874
01:10:56,117 --> 01:10:58,745
Damn! That looked good too.

875
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:04,417
Anyway, he was afraid there was
something wrong with him.

876
01:11:04,492 --> 01:11:06,960
Like he was a pervert or something.

877
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:09,963
l told him that´s
what little dudes do.

878
01:11:10,031 --> 01:11:11,965
l mean, we´ve all done it.

879
01:11:12,734 --> 01:11:15,396
That made him happy.

880
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:19,702
- Garry was happy?
- Yeah. He even smiled.

881
01:11:20,608 --> 01:11:23,099
l never even knew he had teeth.

882
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:28,481
l guess a boy Garry´s age
really needs a man around.

883
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:29,983
Yeah, well--

884
01:11:32,587 --> 01:11:36,489
lt depends on the man.
l had a man around.

885
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:40,119
He used to wake me up in the morning
by flicking lit cigarettes at my head.

886
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:44,689
''Hey, asshole, get up
and make me breakfast.''

887
01:11:47,235 --> 01:11:52,502
You know, Miss Buckman, you need
a license to buy a dog or drive a car.

888
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:56,203
Hell, you need a license
to catch a fish.

889
01:11:56,277 --> 01:12:00,304
But they´ll let any butt-reamin´ asshole
be your father.

890
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:08,819
Well, l´m gonna pick up Julie.

891
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:13,486
They´re hassling her about her hair.
She does look kind of stupid.

892
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:17,829
l don´t know what
we were thinkin´ about.

893
01:12:23,204 --> 01:12:24,796
Thanks.

894
01:12:58,006 --> 01:12:59,940
Kevin wants to go.

895
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:01,600
How´d you go through
those quarters so fast?

896
01:13:01,676 --> 01:13:04,907
- Another kid took Kevin´s money.
- Shut up!

897
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:08,415
- What kid?
- Never mind. Can we just go?

898
01:13:08,483 --> 01:13:10,417
- lt was that kid!
- Never mind!

899
01:13:10,485 --> 01:13:14,615
That kid? That kid´s not bigger
than you. Go back and get your money.

900
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:17,123
Dad, let me handle it, okay?

901
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,490
You want me to help you
get your money back?

902
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,496
Can we just go? l wanna go!

903
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,499
- Okay.
- Okay? That´s a little kid!

904
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:29,298
- Justin can beat up that kid.
- Will you just shut up?

905
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:37,178
- What´s the matter?
- l lost my retainer.

906
01:13:37,245 --> 01:13:40,009
Where? lt´s okay.

907
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:42,982
- l put my retainer on the table!
- Just relax.

908
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,985
lt´s okay, honey.

909
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:49,012
lt´s his retainer.
He lost his retainer.

910
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:55,727
lt´s all right, sweetheart.
We´ll find it.

911
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:02,069
Oh, God!

912
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:16,773
- Here. Let me.
- Where are the kids?

913
01:14:16,851 --> 01:14:19,376
Your folks are driving them home.
They´ll wait with them at our house.

914
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:23,390
That´s just what Kevin needs.
Time alone with my dad.

915
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:27,962
Let´s just go.

916
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:32,659
They´re $200. lf you dropped $200
in here, you´d look, right?

917
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,840
Let´s face it.
He´s getting worse.

918
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:45,209
He has his good days,
and he has his bad days.

919
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:49,410
Why is he so high-strung?
He´s like a poodle.

920
01:14:49,484 --> 01:14:52,317
Everything´s
blown out of proportion.

921
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:55,151
Where does he get
this obsessive behavior?

922
01:14:58,193 --> 01:15:00,286
l wish l knew.

923
01:15:02,263 --> 01:15:05,357
They´re gonna
put him in Special Ed.

924
01:15:05,433 --> 01:15:07,958
What´d you think?

925
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:11,904
That you´d dress up like a cowboy
and coach Little League...

926
01:15:11,973 --> 01:15:13,770
and Kevin would be fine?

927
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:18,345
l mean, no, l didn´t.

928
01:15:20,748 --> 01:15:23,342
Yeah, yeah, okay, l did.

929
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:27,684
Well, honey, you were
really kiddin´ yourself.

930
01:15:35,663 --> 01:15:41,101
You know, when your kid is born,
it can still be perfect.

931
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:44,002
You haven´t made any mistakes yet.

932
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:47,564
And then they grow up to be like...

933
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,141
like me.

934
01:15:58,853 --> 01:16:00,878
l´m gonna be home late tomorrow.

935
01:16:00,955 --> 01:16:02,889
How come?

936
01:16:02,957 --> 01:16:05,824
l´m attempting to dazzle Dave.

937
01:16:05,893 --> 01:16:09,954
l´m trying to put together
a major income property thing...

938
01:16:10,031 --> 01:16:12,022
for one of our bigger clients.

939
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,897
Has Dave said anything?

940
01:16:13,968 --> 01:16:15,902
Thursday, when l left
for Little League, he said...

941
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:18,370
''Let´s all thank Gil for stopping by.''

942
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:21,374
- l didn´t take it as a good sign.
- Let´s just wait and see.

943
01:16:21,442 --> 01:16:23,376
Worrying isn´t gonna help.

944
01:16:24,812 --> 01:16:26,746
God, l´m so tense.

945
01:16:28,549 --> 01:16:31,017
You´re tense right now, honey?

946
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:33,883
My back is tense.
My neck is tense.

947
01:16:33,955 --> 01:16:37,550
My ears are tense.
lt´s like they´re hot or something.

948
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:40,753
Maybe l could do something
to help you relax.

949
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:47,124
- l doubt it, honey.
- l´d like to try.

950
01:17:12,593 --> 01:17:14,959
l am so sorry.

951
01:17:15,029 --> 01:17:19,125
lt´s all right, honey. lt was my fault.
You just kind of took me by surprise.

952
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,361
So, how´d this happen?

953
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,531
Show him, honey.

954
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:33,505
lt´s awfully late, Frank.
We need to get Cool right to bed.

955
01:17:33,581 --> 01:17:35,606
He´ll be all right.

956
01:17:42,423 --> 01:17:43,822
Hi, Dad.

957
01:17:48,663 --> 01:17:50,597
Take the boy inside.

958
01:17:54,268 --> 01:17:57,431
l couldn´t resist.
l had to take it out for a spin.

959
01:17:57,505 --> 01:17:59,905
Purrs like a kitten.

960
01:17:59,974 --> 01:18:02,568
You´re probably wondering why
l took it out without telling you.

961
01:18:02,643 --> 01:18:05,612
l wanted to have it appraised
so you´d know how much it was worth.

962
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,911
Only they can´t appraise it
unless they have all the paperwork.

963
01:18:08,983 --> 01:18:11,611
The registration, the proof of purchase.
You got those things around?

964
01:18:11,686 --> 01:18:13,847
l´m not a schmuck!

965
01:18:14,922 --> 01:18:17,186
You were going to sell my car.

966
01:18:19,927 --> 01:18:22,327
- Dad!
- Don´t bullshit me anymore!

967
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:25,491
lt belittles us both!

968
01:18:26,467 --> 01:18:29,436
l want you out of the house.

969
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,102
They´re gonna kill me.

970
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:47,782
- Bookies?
- Friggin´ basketball.

971
01:18:49,056 --> 01:18:51,047
l had a lock.

972
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:53,252
This miserable
son-of-a-bitch rookie...

973
01:18:53,327 --> 01:18:55,887
throws in a goddamn 50-footer
at the buzzer.

974
01:18:55,963 --> 01:18:57,988
lt was a nightmare.

975
01:18:58,065 --> 01:18:59,999
lt was like he reached into my chest
and ripped out my--

976
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:01,500
Shut up!

977
01:19:03,838 --> 01:19:07,899
How much do you owe?
The truth now!

978
01:19:07,975 --> 01:19:11,274
- $26,000.
- Jesus!

979
01:19:11,345 --> 01:19:15,748
Dad, l´m never gambling again. l swear
to God. But these guys mean business.

980
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:18,047
What about that 3,000 l gave you?

981
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,980
l took it to the track.

982
01:19:22,056 --> 01:19:26,083
l wanted to run it up so l wouldn´t
have to hit you for the whole amount.

983
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:30,290
What is the matter with you? You´re
not a kid anymore! You´re not stupid.

984
01:19:30,364 --> 01:19:33,561
Dad, l can´t get a break.

985
01:19:33,634 --> 01:19:36,626
l have been so close so many times,
l could touch it.

986
01:19:36,704 --> 01:19:40,970
Did you ever think
about getting a job?

987
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:44,978
Oh, great.
Oh, that is just great now.

988
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:47,105
What did you always tell me, huh?

989
01:19:47,181 --> 01:19:51,311
''Make your mark.
Don´t be one of the numbers.''

990
01:19:51,385 --> 01:19:53,512
You misunderstood me.
You weren´t listening.

991
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:57,547
lf l called you up to tell you,
''Hey, Dad, l´m the new assistant...

992
01:19:57,625 --> 01:20:00,685
sub-vice president of pencil sharpening
at some crappy little company''...

993
01:20:00,761 --> 01:20:03,093
you´re telling me
you´d think that was great?

994
01:20:03,164 --> 01:20:07,225
l am better than that!
l am not Gil!

995
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,477
Look...

996
01:20:18,546 --> 01:20:20,946
l´ve made some mistakes.

997
01:20:21,015 --> 01:20:23,381
l have to learn from them.

998
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:30,756
They´re gonna kill me, Dad,
with pain.

999
01:20:33,694 --> 01:20:35,992
l´m your son.

1000
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:49,337
Hydrogen.

1001
01:20:50,211 --> 01:20:51,644
Helium.

1002
01:20:54,215 --> 01:20:56,376
Carbon.

1003
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:58,509
Excuse me, honey?

1004
01:20:58,586 --> 01:21:02,579
l don´t mean to interrupt,
but l´ve made up some new cards.

1005
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:06,354
Really?
Well, that´s great, Mommy.

1006
01:21:06,427 --> 01:21:09,828
l´m so glad you´re back
with the program. Let´s do your cards.

1007
01:21:09,897 --> 01:21:14,300
Why don´t l show them to you first
and make sure they´re appropriate?

1008
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:21,437
Sweetheart, Mommy and Daddy
will be back in two minutes.

1009
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:24,478
- How many seconds is that?
- 120.

1010
01:21:33,387 --> 01:21:34,718
''This is...''

1011
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:37,849
the only way...

1012
01:21:37,925 --> 01:21:39,916
l can get...

1013
01:21:39,994 --> 01:21:41,985
your attention.''

1014
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:45,032
Honey, this is really basic stuff.
She´s way beyond this.

1015
01:21:45,099 --> 01:21:47,033
''l´m leaving you.''

1016
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:50,571
You´re leaving me?

1017
01:21:53,374 --> 01:21:54,966
''Yes.''

1018
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:03,209
Well, thank you.

1019
01:22:05,753 --> 01:22:07,721
l really had a great time.

1020
01:22:07,788 --> 01:22:11,189
lt´s been years since anybody´s
taken me to a carnival.

1021
01:22:11,258 --> 01:22:14,694
You thought that was a carnival?
That was my parents´ house.

1022
01:22:14,762 --> 01:22:17,856
You know, you´re pretty funny
for a biology teacher.

1023
01:22:17,932 --> 01:22:19,365
Thank you.

1024
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:25,772
Would you like to come in?

1025
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,206
- Sure.
- Good.

1026
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:34,714
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Mrs. B!

1027
01:22:37,151 --> 01:22:39,085
Hi, Mom. Hi, Mr. Bowman.

1028
01:22:39,153 --> 01:22:40,586
Knee drop!

1029
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:50,528
That´s a nice knee drop, honey.
Want some coffee?

1030
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:53,089
- l´d love some.
- The kitchen´s right there.

1031
01:22:55,069 --> 01:22:57,037
- Can l ask you something?
- Sure.

1032
01:22:57,104 --> 01:22:59,402
How come you finally
decided to go out with me?

1033
01:22:59,473 --> 01:23:01,873
My grandmother told me to.

1034
01:23:01,942 --> 01:23:04,069
Not really.
She´s been staying with us.

1035
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:08,104
lt´s a little crowded, so tomorrow
l´m taking her over to my brother Gil´s.

1036
01:23:08,182 --> 01:23:12,243
Hi, Julie. l would like to
introduce you to Mr. Bowman.

1037
01:23:13,988 --> 01:23:15,979
What´s up?
Did you get the Twinkies?

1038
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:19,322
l found this
in the trunk of your car.

1039
01:23:21,996 --> 01:23:25,432
- You´re racing again, aren´t you?
- Yeah. So what?

1040
01:23:25,499 --> 01:23:27,490
So you promised, that´s what!

1041
01:23:27,568 --> 01:23:30,128
- l changed my mind.
- You changed your mind?

1042
01:23:30,204 --> 01:23:33,901
- Yeah! l changed my mind!
- What about house painting?

1043
01:23:33,974 --> 01:23:37,171
- l gave it up.
- You gave it up? That was your future.

1044
01:23:37,244 --> 01:23:39,508
Well--

1045
01:23:40,881 --> 01:23:44,146
Dave and Rod kinda
took all the equipment and split.

1046
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:48,817
l don´t know where they are.

1047
01:23:48,889 --> 01:23:52,017
l told you not to trust those guys.
Didn´t l tell you?

1048
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:54,220
l´m not as smart as you are, okay?

1049
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:57,992
l didn´t get 13,000
on my SAT´s, okay?

1050
01:23:58,065 --> 01:24:00,533
- l´m stupid, okay?
- Okay!

1051
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:01,863
- Julie--
- Butt out!

1052
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:06,305
- Maybe l should leave.
- No! Maybe l should leave.

1053
01:24:06,373 --> 01:24:08,364
What do you mean, ''maybe''?

1054
01:24:13,914 --> 01:24:16,382
What is it with the women
in this family?

1055
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:19,180
They make all the men
in this family wanna leave!

1056
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:26,521
lf he thinks l´m having his baby now,
he´s crazy.

1057
01:24:30,931 --> 01:24:33,923
- Baby?
- Your daughter´s having a baby?

1058
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:35,969
A baby?

1059
01:24:36,036 --> 01:24:38,197
You´re gonna be a grandma?

1060
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:46,406
l´m too young.
Grandmothers are old.

1061
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:50,849
They bake, and they sew and they
tell you stories about the Depression.

1062
01:24:50,918 --> 01:24:55,321
l was at Woodstock, for Christ´s sake!
l peed in a field!

1063
01:24:55,389 --> 01:24:58,950
l´ve hung onto the Who´s helicopter
as it flew away.

1064
01:24:59,026 --> 01:25:00,789
l was at Woodstock.

1065
01:25:00,861 --> 01:25:05,161
Oh, yeah?
l thought you looked familiar.

1066
01:25:07,434 --> 01:25:11,268
l´ve spoken
with Ted and Dan and...

1067
01:25:11,338 --> 01:25:16,401
we have decided to make
Phil Richards a partner.

1068
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:22,140
Holy shit!

1069
01:25:22,216 --> 01:25:24,582
- l know you´re upset--
- Upset?

1070
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:27,450
Haven´t you seen the deals
l´ve been putting together?

1071
01:25:27,521 --> 01:25:31,287
l have been killing myself.
l mean, aren´t you dazzled?

1072
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:34,127
You still don´t get it, do ya?

1073
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:39,997
Phil has just brought in three
brand-new, multimillion-dollar clients.

1074
01:25:40,067 --> 01:25:45,061
He has spent the last month wining
and dining these guys, gettin´ ´em laid.

1075
01:25:45,139 --> 01:25:47,664
He doesn´t tell me about problems
with his kids.

1076
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:50,005
l´m not even sure if he has kids.

1077
01:25:50,077 --> 01:25:53,877
lf this man´s dick fell off,
he would still show up to work.

1078
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:55,779
He is an animal.

1079
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:58,751
That´s what dazzles, not the work.

1080
01:25:58,819 --> 01:26:03,449
You can´t do what he does.
Ya hate that shit.

1081
01:26:03,524 --> 01:26:06,254
- Now, Phil Richards--
- l quit!

1082
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:09,057
- Oh, Gil.
- Forget it.

1083
01:26:09,129 --> 01:26:12,189
Phil brought you some big clients.
You´re happy.

1084
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:17,197
l´m just gonna call my clients,
give ´em the news, and l´m outta here.

1085
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:19,637
Friday´s my last day.
Don´t make me a party.

1086
01:26:30,784 --> 01:26:33,719
Hey, this is not
a playground, okay?

1087
01:26:34,755 --> 01:26:36,154
Dad!

1088
01:26:37,224 --> 01:26:40,751
Not now! Not now!

1089
01:26:42,863 --> 01:26:44,831
Knock it off!

1090
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:51,836
God, l can´t believe
they did this.

1091
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:58,837
The other kids got picked up,
and ours are watching a tape.

1092
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:02,076
Helen just dropped your grandma off.
Let´s talk.

1093
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:04,242
l quit my job.

1094
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:07,982
Why?

1095
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:12,420
They gave the partnership
to Phil Richards.

1096
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:16,054
This is a guy who leaves
his wife and kids...

1097
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:19,896
then puts his money in his girlfriend´s
name to get out of paying child support.

1098
01:27:19,967 --> 01:27:23,630
l mean, the guy is--

1099
01:27:23,704 --> 01:27:26,264
Anyway, l couldn´t stand it.
l snapped.

1100
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:28,399
Can you still change your mind?

1101
01:27:28,475 --> 01:27:31,444
What do you mean, change my mind?
l quit.

1102
01:27:32,279 --> 01:27:37,512
Did you say anything that would make it
difficult for them to take you back?

1103
01:27:37,584 --> 01:27:41,611
Jesus, honey, l was hoping
you´d be a little more supportive.

1104
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:43,850
l´m pregnant.

1105
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,129
Since when?

1106
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,308
Since l am.
l´m due in February.

1107
01:28:03,377 --> 01:28:07,211
l didn´t want to say anything
until l was sure.

1108
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:11,047
- How did this happen?
- lt was an accident.

1109
01:28:12,152 --> 01:28:15,246
Anyhow, this is why
l´m saying maybe...

1110
01:28:15,322 --> 01:28:19,383
now this isn´t the best time for you
to be out of work or starting a new job.

1111
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:22,952
lf you´d told me there was a chance of
this happening, l might not have quit.

1112
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:25,794
You never told me
there was a chance you might quit.

1113
01:28:25,866 --> 01:28:29,029
- lt was a spur-of-the-moment decision.
- Pretty big one.

1114
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:34,405
Are you saying l should crawl back, kiss
Dave´s feet and get my crappy job back?

1115
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:37,069
l quit.

1116
01:28:37,144 --> 01:28:39,271
lf l go back now, they´ve got me.
l´m a eunuch.

1117
01:28:39,346 --> 01:28:42,713
This puts a minor crimp
in my life too.

1118
01:28:42,783 --> 01:28:46,981
l was thinking about starting
back to work in the fall. Now l can´t.

1119
01:28:48,322 --> 01:28:50,415
That´s the difference
between men and women.

1120
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:53,221
Women have choices.
Men have responsibilities.

1121
01:28:53,293 --> 01:28:54,954
Oh, really?

1122
01:28:56,263 --> 01:29:01,860
Okay, well, then,
l choose for you to have the baby.

1123
01:29:01,935 --> 01:29:04,335
That´s my choice.
You have the baby.

1124
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:08,432
You get fat. You breast-feed until your
nipples are sore. l´ll go back to work.

1125
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:12,843
Let´s return from la-la land,
because that ain´t gonna happen.

1126
01:29:12,913 --> 01:29:15,177
Whether l crawl back to Dave
or get another job...

1127
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:18,912
it´s obvious now l´m gonna
have to spend less time at home.

1128
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:22,649
l´m gonna have to have business dinners.
l´m gonna have to play racquetball.

1129
01:29:22,723 --> 01:29:25,021
l´m gonna have to get guys laid.

1130
01:29:25,092 --> 01:29:27,788
l hope you don´t mind if l bring home
a few prostitutes...

1131
01:29:27,861 --> 01:29:31,695
because that´s what it takes to get
anywhere, and l´m not getting anywhere.

1132
01:29:31,765 --> 01:29:35,895
Whatever happens, you have
to count on less help from me.

1133
01:29:35,969 --> 01:29:38,961
Why don´t you just say
what you´re really thinking?

1134
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:41,303
What am l thinking?

1135
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,707
That l should have an abortion?

1136
01:29:46,947 --> 01:29:49,177
l didn´t say that.

1137
01:29:49,249 --> 01:29:52,218
That´s a decision every woman
has to make on her own.

1138
01:29:52,286 --> 01:29:54,345
Are you running for Congress?

1139
01:29:54,421 --> 01:29:58,517
Don´t give me that. l want your opinion
about what we should do.

1140
01:29:58,592 --> 01:30:00,992
Let´s pretend
it´s your decision, okay?

1141
01:30:01,061 --> 01:30:05,998
Pretend you´re a caveman or your father.
What do you want me to do?

1142
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:11,904
l want...

1143
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:17,908
l want whatever you want.

1144
01:30:17,978 --> 01:30:20,538
l wanna have the baby.

1145
01:30:20,614 --> 01:30:23,674
Well, great!
Let´s have it then.

1146
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:25,911
Let´s see how l can
screw the fourth one up.

1147
01:30:25,986 --> 01:30:29,080
Let´s have five. Let´s have six!

1148
01:30:29,156 --> 01:30:33,092
Let´s have a dozen
and pretend they´re doughnuts.

1149
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,856
l´m really happy about the way
things are turning out, aren´t you?

1150
01:30:37,731 --> 01:30:41,895
With your frame of mind, not only am l
not sure we should have another baby...

1151
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:44,631
l´m not sure we should
keep the three we´ve got.

1152
01:30:44,705 --> 01:30:47,265
l´m ready to discuss it.
However, l can´t right now.

1153
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:49,571
l gotta go to
the goddamn Little League.

1154
01:30:49,643 --> 01:30:52,544
Ten little boys are waiting for me
to guide them into last place.

1155
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,638
You really have to go?

1156
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:58,048
My whole life is ''have to.''

1157
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:03,112
- Come on, Kevin. Get your glove.
- You said l don´t have to play anymore.

1158
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:05,715
l know what l said,
but now l´m changing my mind.

1159
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:08,556
lf l have to go, you have to go.
Move it.

1160
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:10,563
Kevin, this one´s for you.

1161
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:18,400
Get behind the ball.
lt´s easier to come in.

1162
01:31:18,472 --> 01:31:21,805
Hi, Dad.
What are you doing here?

1163
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:26,574
Karen said you were here.
Can l speak to you a second?

1164
01:31:29,183 --> 01:31:31,743
Wayne, can you take over
a second?

1165
01:31:36,623 --> 01:31:39,114
What´s up?

1166
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:41,184
l need your advice.

1167
01:31:43,363 --> 01:31:45,729
Wait a second.
My head is spinning.

1168
01:31:45,799 --> 01:31:47,767
Come on.

1169
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:54,073
Larry needs $26,000,
or gamblers are gonna kill him.

1170
01:31:55,976 --> 01:31:57,671
Jesus!

1171
01:31:57,744 --> 01:32:00,736
l´m supposed to decide
whether to give it to him.

1172
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:06,847
And you want my advice?

1173
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:10,347
Why me? Why now?

1174
01:32:10,424 --> 01:32:13,552
Because l know you think
l was a shitty father.

1175
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:31,801
Thank you for not arguing.

1176
01:32:31,878 --> 01:32:36,247
And l know you´re a good father,
so tell me, what would you do?

1177
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:45,553
- You got that kind of money?
- l got it. lt´s gonna hurt.

1178
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:50,495
l wanted to retire next year.
This will put that off for a while.

1179
01:32:50,564 --> 01:32:52,498
A long while.

1180
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:58,370
l never should have had four.

1181
01:32:59,873 --> 01:33:04,936
You know, when you were two years old,
we thought you had polio.

1182
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,971
You know about that?

1183
01:33:09,049 --> 01:33:11,142
Yeah, Mom once said something.

1184
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:15,177
Yeah, well,
for a week we didn´t know.

1185
01:33:17,057 --> 01:33:19,025
l hated you for that.

1186
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:22,051
- What?
- l did.

1187
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:27,897
l did. l hated having
to go through that...

1188
01:33:27,968 --> 01:33:32,302
caring, the worrying, the pain.

1189
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:36,140
That´s not for me.

1190
01:33:36,209 --> 01:33:40,168
You know,
it´s not like that all ends...

1191
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:43,842
when you´re 18 or 21 or 41 or 61.

1192
01:33:43,917 --> 01:33:47,478
lt never, never ends.

1193
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:53,226
lt´s like your Aunt Edna´s ass. lt goes
on forever and is just as frightening.

1194
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:58,696
- That´s true.
- There is no end zone.

1195
01:33:58,765 --> 01:34:04,169
You never cross the goal line, spike
the ball and do your touchdown dance.

1196
01:34:04,237 --> 01:34:05,670
Never.

1197
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:11,075
l´m 64.

1198
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:16,244
Larry´s 27.

1199
01:34:17,918 --> 01:34:20,546
And he´s still my son.

1200
01:34:22,789 --> 01:34:25,656
Like Kevin is your son.

1201
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,594
You think l want him
to get hurt?

1202
01:34:30,997 --> 01:34:33,124
He´s my son.

1203
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:39,805
Come on.

1204
01:34:44,544 --> 01:34:47,513
l´m all right.
l´ll figure it out.

1205
01:34:53,787 --> 01:34:58,087
Who´s to say
who´s the shitty father?

1206
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:00,752
Kevin´s in therapy.

1207
01:35:00,827 --> 01:35:04,354
We got called to school last year
because Taylor was kissing all the boys.

1208
01:35:04,431 --> 01:35:07,457
Justin keeps ramming things
with his head.

1209
01:35:07,534 --> 01:35:10,435
My career is in the shithouse.

1210
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:17,477
You worry too much.

1211
01:35:17,544 --> 01:35:20,240
You always did.

1212
01:35:36,129 --> 01:35:38,996
Okay, let´s go. Let´s get ´em.

1213
01:35:39,065 --> 01:35:42,466
Let´s get this one.
Come on. You can do it.

1214
01:35:53,146 --> 01:35:57,412
We only need one more out!
Can´t you even field a ground ball?

1215
01:35:57,484 --> 01:36:01,944
Matt, l´m not gonna warn ya again. One
more comment, and you´re outta there.

1216
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:06,288
What are you yellin´ at him for?
He´s the only player you got.

1217
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:11,456
Matt, we need one more out, son.
Wherever it´s hit, you go for it.

1218
01:36:11,531 --> 01:36:13,465
lt´s the only chance
you have to win.

1219
01:36:14,868 --> 01:36:17,132
All right, come on, now!
Don´t blow it!

1220
01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:20,264
All right, no big deal.
No big deal.

1221
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:23,935
One more out. Just relax.

1222
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:27,036
Relax and concentrate.
Let´s go!

1223
01:36:34,788 --> 01:36:36,255
Oh, shit!

1224
01:36:42,629 --> 01:36:44,290
Get it, Matt!

1225
01:37:36,716 --> 01:37:37,808
He´s out!

1226
01:38:10,383 --> 01:38:13,352
l´m gonna help you.

1227
01:38:16,756 --> 01:38:20,157
Now, we see these gangsters.

1228
01:38:20,226 --> 01:38:22,820
We agree to pay them
a thousand dollars a month.

1229
01:38:22,896 --> 01:38:27,026
They´re businessmen. They´ll see
that something is better than nothing.

1230
01:38:28,802 --> 01:38:33,000
Then Monday morning, 8:00 a.m....

1231
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:36,565
you come to work with me
at my place.

1232
01:38:36,643 --> 01:38:39,077
l´m going to teach you
the business.

1233
01:38:39,913 --> 01:38:41,608
Plumbing supplies.

1234
01:38:41,681 --> 01:38:45,242
ln a few years, l´ll retire,
and you´ll take over.

1235
01:38:45,318 --> 01:38:48,913
Meanwhile,
as long as you´re working...

1236
01:38:48,989 --> 01:38:53,949
and if you agree to go to Gamblers
Anonymous, l´ll keep paying your debt.

1237
01:38:54,894 --> 01:38:57,089
That´s it.

1238
01:39:09,643 --> 01:39:12,043
Let me just add a wrinkle.

1239
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:16,105
About an hour ago, l got a phone call
from an associate in Chile.

1240
01:39:16,182 --> 01:39:18,150
Big opportunity.

1241
01:39:18,218 --> 01:39:20,152
Platinum.

1242
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:24,680
Why don´t l just toddle off down there
for a few months, see if it pans out?

1243
01:39:24,758 --> 01:39:27,591
lf it does, great.
lf not...

1244
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:31,062
we put the Frank Buckman plan
into effect.

1245
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:32,723
Sound good?

1246
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:36,628
Sure.

1247
01:39:38,805 --> 01:39:40,739
Great.

1248
01:39:44,577 --> 01:39:47,910
- l could use a little--
- Two thousand enough?

1249
01:39:47,981 --> 01:39:49,243
Ample.

1250
01:39:50,383 --> 01:39:51,816
Ample.

1251
01:39:52,952 --> 01:39:55,420
Well, better pack.

1252
01:39:55,488 --> 01:39:58,150
- What about Cool?
- What?

1253
01:39:58,224 --> 01:40:01,250
Oh, Jesus, that´s a tough one.

1254
01:40:01,327 --> 01:40:05,127
This is not really
the kind of trip that--

1255
01:40:06,199 --> 01:40:08,133
Listen, how about if--

1256
01:40:11,137 --> 01:40:13,435
Don´t worry about it.

1257
01:40:40,033 --> 01:40:44,333
- My dad´s going away.
- Yes.

1258
01:40:44,404 --> 01:40:46,736
He´s leaving right away.

1259
01:40:50,877 --> 01:40:52,970
ls he ever coming back?

1260
01:40:59,285 --> 01:41:01,810
Would you like
to stay here with us?

1261
01:41:04,157 --> 01:41:05,249
Yeah.

1262
01:41:06,993 --> 01:41:09,257
Good.

1263
01:41:14,267 --> 01:41:16,565
- Good morning, Mrs. Haffner.
- Hi, Michelle.

1264
01:41:16,636 --> 01:41:20,868
- Susan, l need to talk to you.
- Not now, Nathan. l have a class.

1265
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:25,172
l want you to come home. This is very
bad for Patty. She can´t concentrate.

1266
01:41:25,245 --> 01:41:28,578
- l gotta go.
- Wait. Listen to me.

1267
01:41:28,648 --> 01:41:30,912
lt´s bad for me too.

1268
01:41:32,118 --> 01:41:34,109
l love you, Susan.

1269
01:41:37,991 --> 01:41:40,289
Those are words.
They don´t solve anything.

1270
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:43,488
l can compromise.
l can change.

1271
01:41:45,598 --> 01:41:47,964
l don´t think
you´re capable of change.

1272
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:04,880
We´re way behind because of yesterday´s
bomb threat, so let´s get going.

1273
01:42:07,153 --> 01:42:12,318
Why do birds suddenly appear

1274
01:42:12,392 --> 01:42:16,795
Every time you are near

1275
01:42:17,797 --> 01:42:21,233
Just like me
They long to be

1276
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:23,929
Close to you

1277
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:28,300
Nathan, please.
l´ll lose my job.

1278
01:42:28,374 --> 01:42:33,778
Why do stars twinkle in the sky

1279
01:42:33,847 --> 01:42:38,546
Every time you walk by

1280
01:42:38,618 --> 01:42:42,918
Just like me
They long to be

1281
01:42:42,989 --> 01:42:45,321
Close to you

1282
01:42:45,391 --> 01:42:48,690
We´re trying so hard
to keep these kids off drugs.

1283
01:42:48,761 --> 01:42:53,528
On the day that you were born
the angels got together

1284
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:57,229
And decided to create a dream
come true

1285
01:42:57,303 --> 01:42:59,601
This was the song from our wedding.

1286
01:42:59,672 --> 01:43:03,005
So they sprinkled moondust
in your hair

1287
01:43:03,076 --> 01:43:06,204
And golden sunlight
in your eyes so blue

1288
01:43:06,279 --> 01:43:09,009
lt´s a wedding kind of a song.

1289
01:43:09,082 --> 01:43:14,850
That is why
All the guys in town

1290
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:20,223
Follow you all around

1291
01:43:20,293 --> 01:43:22,853
Just like me

1292
01:43:22,929 --> 01:43:25,227
They long to be

1293
01:43:25,298 --> 01:43:28,028
Close to you

1294
01:43:36,042 --> 01:43:37,839
You´re crazy.

1295
01:43:46,286 --> 01:43:49,278
Susan, l love you.
Please, come home.

1296
01:44:15,415 --> 01:44:17,349
How´s it look?

1297
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:23,321
Lookin´ hot.
Lookin´ damn hot.

1298
01:44:41,207 --> 01:44:44,973
Mom! Hurry. He´s over there.
He´s gonna kill himself.

1299
01:44:45,044 --> 01:44:48,741
- Julie, l´m not his mother.
- Please, Mommy, please. l´m so scared.

1300
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:51,215
- Now l´m ''Mommy.''
- He´s trying to prove something.

1301
01:45:00,693 --> 01:45:02,957
Oh, God, he´s already going.

1302
01:45:04,063 --> 01:45:07,123
ln eight seconds
he´s gonna be a legend.

1303
01:45:45,171 --> 01:45:47,230
- My God!
- Come on!

1304
01:46:06,993 --> 01:46:09,587
Back up. Give him some room.

1305
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,297
Did l win?

1306
01:46:17,737 --> 01:46:22,299
- l´m all right.
- We´ll get you to first aid, make sure.

1307
01:46:22,375 --> 01:46:25,606
My brother´s car.
l killed the car.

1308
01:46:25,678 --> 01:46:27,703
Julie, come on. Let´s go.

1309
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:29,771
- l can´t.
- What?

1310
01:46:29,849 --> 01:46:32,477
l can´t. This is too intense.
This is--

1311
01:46:32,552 --> 01:46:36,579
This is marriage.
Now, let´s get in the truck.

1312
01:46:40,359 --> 01:46:43,226
Come on! Let´s go!

1313
01:46:43,296 --> 01:46:46,424
Can you do that again next week?
The crowd loved it.

1314
01:46:46,499 --> 01:46:48,694
Yeah, sure.

1315
01:46:48,768 --> 01:46:52,204
That´s a good job for me.
Crash dummy.

1316
01:46:52,271 --> 01:46:56,139
- Stop that. You´re very important.
- Why?

1317
01:46:56,209 --> 01:47:00,771
Why? Because you´re gonna be the father
of my grandchild. That´s why.

1318
01:47:16,529 --> 01:47:19,794
- l love you.
- l love you too.

1319
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:23,630
l was so scared.

1320
01:47:39,886 --> 01:47:44,721
You, like, saved their marriage.
That was really cool.

1321
01:47:46,058 --> 01:47:50,995
Yeah, well, l give ´em six months.
Four, if she cooks.

1322
01:47:51,063 --> 01:47:54,328
You don´t think
they´re gonna make it?

1323
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:58,063
Well, you know, honey,
the odds aren´t good.

1324
01:47:58,137 --> 01:48:01,903
Then why´d you say all that?
Why did you try to keep them together?

1325
01:48:01,974 --> 01:48:04,101
Because Julie wants Tod.

1326
01:48:04,177 --> 01:48:06,907
Whatever you guys want,
l want to get for you.

1327
01:48:06,979 --> 01:48:09,174
That´s the best l can do.

1328
01:48:10,783 --> 01:48:12,683
l´m glad you´re going out
with Mr. Bowman.

1329
01:48:12,718 --> 01:48:17,553
- Yeah? Why?
- Well, he´s funny.

1330
01:48:17,623 --> 01:48:20,615
And he´s the kind of guy
that´d be nice to you.

1331
01:48:21,527 --> 01:48:23,825
Somebody should be nice to you.

1332
01:48:23,896 --> 01:48:27,423
l tell you, kid,
l could stand that.

1333
01:48:30,236 --> 01:48:32,864
- Can we tape over Susan´s wedding?
- No!

1334
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:36,739
- What are we supposed to tape over?
- Mom, my ears are loose.

1335
01:48:36,809 --> 01:48:40,245
l´ll fix them. Your pants are backwards.
Go upstairs and turn them around.

1336
01:48:40,313 --> 01:48:43,578
Tell Grandma we´re leaving.
She´s still playing Nintendo.

1337
01:48:44,884 --> 01:48:48,183
- You know your lines?
- l don´t have any lines. l´m Dopey.

1338
01:48:48,254 --> 01:48:49,687
l´ll say.

1339
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:53,124
Kevin, take Justin outside
and put him in his car seat.

1340
01:48:53,192 --> 01:48:55,888
l have to do everything.
Come on, shrimp.

1341
01:48:58,364 --> 01:49:01,299
And l´m the one in therapy.

1342
01:49:02,301 --> 01:49:04,235
l´m not a shrimp.

1343
01:49:18,451 --> 01:49:19,816
l love you.

1344
01:49:21,887 --> 01:49:23,320
l love you too.

1345
01:49:25,024 --> 01:49:29,484
No, l mean, l really love you.

1346
01:49:32,565 --> 01:49:35,033
l love you too.

1347
01:49:40,773 --> 01:49:44,709
Dave called. He was crying.
He actually cried.

1348
01:49:44,777 --> 01:49:48,838
lf l come back, they´ll give me a corner
office with new furniture and a raise.

1349
01:49:48,914 --> 01:49:51,610
Like that´s supposed
to make up for everything.

1350
01:49:51,684 --> 01:49:54,812
Anyway, l took the job.
l couldn´t think.

1351
01:49:54,887 --> 01:49:58,015
l was still high
from the Little League game.

1352
01:49:58,090 --> 01:50:01,184
lsn´t that demented?
That a grown man´s happiness...

1353
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:04,161
depends on whether
a nine-year-old catches a pop-up?

1354
01:50:04,230 --> 01:50:06,755
- What if he missed?
- But he didn´t.

1355
01:50:06,832 --> 01:50:10,859
- But he could have.
- But he didn´t, Gil.

1356
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:16,606
You threw him 12 million pop-ups in the
backyard. You cut the odds considerably.

1357
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:19,509
lf you hadn´t--

1358
01:50:19,578 --> 01:50:24,481
But there´s three of them,
and you want to have four.

1359
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:27,815
And the fourth one could be Larry.

1360
01:50:27,887 --> 01:50:32,085
They´re gonna do a lot of things.
Baseball´s the least of it.

1361
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:34,956
And in all those things,
sometimes they´re gonna miss.

1362
01:50:35,027 --> 01:50:39,191
- Sometimes they won´t.
- Sometimes they will.

1363
01:50:39,265 --> 01:50:44,202
What do you want? Guarantees?
These are kids, not appliances.

1364
01:50:44,270 --> 01:50:48,070
- Life is messy.
- l hate messy.

1365
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:50,802
lt´s so messy!

1366
01:50:50,876 --> 01:50:55,074
You know, when l was 19,
Grandpa took me on a roller coaster.

1367
01:50:58,150 --> 01:51:01,142
Up, down, up, down.

1368
01:51:01,887 --> 01:51:06,722
- Oh, what a ride.
- What a great story.

1369
01:51:08,227 --> 01:51:10,286
l always wanted to go again.

1370
01:51:10,363 --> 01:51:15,198
lt was just interesting to me that
a ride could make me so frightened...

1371
01:51:15,267 --> 01:51:20,295
so scared, so sick, so excited...

1372
01:51:20,373 --> 01:51:23,433
and so thrilled all together.

1373
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:29,611
Some didn´t like it.
They went on the merry-go-round.

1374
01:51:31,417 --> 01:51:34,511
That just goes around.
Nothing.

1375
01:51:36,122 --> 01:51:38,056
l like the roller coaster.

1376
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:41,184
You get more out of it.

1377
01:51:44,864 --> 01:51:48,664
Well, l´ll be seeing you
in the car.

1378
01:51:56,776 --> 01:51:59,142
She´s a very smart lady.

1379
01:52:00,446 --> 01:52:02,710
Come on, Taylor.
Your ears are ready.

1380
01:52:02,782 --> 01:52:05,876
A minute ago
l was confused about life.

1381
01:52:05,951 --> 01:52:09,853
Then Grandma came in with her wonderful
and effecting roller coaster story.

1382
01:52:09,922 --> 01:52:11,913
Now everything is great again.

1383
01:52:16,362 --> 01:52:19,593
l happen to like
the roller coaster, okay?

1384
01:52:22,168 --> 01:52:26,400
As far as l´m concerned,
your grandmother is brilliant.

1385
01:52:26,472 --> 01:52:29,270
Come on, Taylor.
Hurry up.

1386
01:52:33,512 --> 01:52:38,006
lf she´s so brilliant, how come
she´s sitting in our neighbor´s car?

1387
01:52:58,471 --> 01:53:03,067
- lt´s good to be home.
- lt sure is!

1388
01:53:03,142 --> 01:53:05,610
Somebody stole our dishes!

1389
01:53:10,082 --> 01:53:13,745
They´re not stolen.
They´re put away.

1390
01:53:13,819 --> 01:53:16,845
They´re not stolen!

1391
01:53:19,225 --> 01:53:22,752
They´re not stolen.
They´re put away.

1392
01:53:22,828 --> 01:53:25,592
They´re not stolen!

1393
01:53:26,999 --> 01:53:29,797
They´re put away!

1394
01:53:31,036 --> 01:53:34,335
- What was that?
- lt came from the bedroom.

1395
01:53:34,406 --> 01:53:38,433
- lt sounds like a monster.
- Someone should see what it is.

1396
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:42,003
- Not me!
- Let Dopey do it.

1397
01:53:49,822 --> 01:53:53,189
They´re hurting my sister!

1398
01:53:55,127 --> 01:53:56,560
He´s going. Get him.

1399
01:53:58,163 --> 01:54:00,529
Get him.

1400
01:54:02,668 --> 01:54:06,069
Get away from my sister! Stop!

1401
01:54:17,049 --> 01:54:22,351
Come back here.
Come back here, little one.

1402
01:54:25,524 --> 01:54:28,652
He´s ruining the whole play!

1403
01:54:28,727 --> 01:54:31,127
l think that´s the Buckmans´ kid.

1404
01:55:05,230 --> 01:55:06,663
That´s great!

1405
01:56:16,568 --> 01:56:19,867
You´re doin´ great. One more push,
and the baby will be here.

1406
01:56:19,938 --> 01:56:23,271
Bear down. Push.
We´re almost there, Mom. Come on.

1407
01:56:23,342 --> 01:56:26,641
Push. That´s it. Great.
You´re doin´ great.

1408
01:56:26,712 --> 01:56:29,146
- You´re doin´ fine.
- Here we go now.

1409
01:56:29,214 --> 01:56:32,980

- Push. Here comes the baby. Good.

1410

Here it is. lt´s a girl!

1411
01:56:37,389 --> 01:56:40,552
Good! Congratulations, Mom.

1412
01:56:40,626 --> 01:56:45,928
You´d better get out in the lobby, Dad.
You´ve got about 100 relatives in there.

1413
01:57:19,798 --> 01:57:21,060
Well?

1414
01:57:22,868 --> 01:57:25,632
lt´s a girl.

1415
01:57:25,704 --> 01:57:28,298
Helen´s fine.
