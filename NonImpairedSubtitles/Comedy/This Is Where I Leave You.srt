00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,263
It's a bulging disk.
It's pretty common, actually.

WENDY: Hmm. Hmm.
MAN 1: Usually in men, though, right?

You do see it mostly in men,
but she's pretty active.

310

She's real active.

311

Well, I'm managing a small, small,
very private equity fund.

312

Mostly small... Hey, Molly.

313
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,482
Mostly small cap, emerging markets.
All that good stuff.

- No, no kids yet. One day, maybe.

315

We made love on our first date. In his car.
Behind the Texaco station.

Oh, shit. She's telling the Texaco story.

HILARY:
Mort left the air conditioning on.

318
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,749
By the time we were done,
the battery was dead.

319
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,331
We had to call my father to come
and give him a jump start.

320
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,212
Maybe they wanna hear
about his hobbies.

321
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,811
The stuff that's going on
in fossil fuels is just really sexy.

322
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,507
God, the passion, the creativity,
the angles.

323
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,802
- Jesus Christ.
- “Angles"?

324
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,002
- Mort knew his way around a woman's body.
- Mother.

325
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,679
- And the sheer size of him. Circumference.
- Mom.

326
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,141
- I don't mind telling you, the man was hung.
- That should've been the headstone.

327
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,854
Clearly, she lost more than a husband. Hmm?
Anybody need anything from the kitchen?

328
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,978
No, it's true. I mean, I
miss him and I miss it.

329
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,235
- Hi.
- Hi, Judd. I'm just trying to make some space.

330
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,117
Hmm. Well, I'm gonna sneak out for a drive.

331
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,950
I have a feeling Mom
is just getting warmed up in there.

332
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,489
The talking helps.

333
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,202
Jerry died 20 years ago...

334
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,995
...and I still find ways of randomly
working him into conversations.

335
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,162
Like right there, for instance.

336
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,627
How come you never found anyone else?

337
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,965
Boy. That was very rude. I apologize.

338
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,050
It'd be a terrible mistake
to go through life...

339
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,292
...thinking people are the sum total
of what you see.

340
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,518
Linda, I'm an asshole. Just forgive me.

341
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,179
- You get a free pass this week.
- Thank you.

342
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:21,442
And thank you for taking care of Mom
these past few months.

343
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,696
I'll bet she would've been a
mess without you. Thank you.

Why don't you swing by the store
and pick up Horry?

345
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,784
I don't like him walking home in the dark.
He gets confused sometimes.

00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,444
Sure.

347

PENNY:
I'm so sorry about your dad.

353

I should've come today. I'm sorry.
I have a thing with funerals.

354
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,241
I'm afraid I'll start laughing or bawling or
say something inappropriate, so I don't go.

355
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,246
Which is not a solution,
but there you have it.

356
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,750
- Anyway, what's it been? Seven, 8, 9 years?
- Something like that.

357
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,877
Horry said you came alone.
What happened to Quinn?

JUDD: Mm-mm.

359
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,353

- Just a freak accident on an elliptical.

Goddamn antidepressants I'm on.
You know?

361
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,380
- They just obliterate whatever filter I have.
- Mm-hm.

00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,095
It's very embarrassing.

- She left me.
- I knew it! I fucking knew it!

- I knew that. I'm sorry, but...
- Aah!

She slept with my boss, so...

Gosh. And now your father.

I'm sorry, Judd.
You're having a profoundly shitty year.

370

I've had better. Yeah, it's not...

371

Anyway, so you live here still?

372
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:01,584
My mom got very sick, so I came back to
spend time with her and see that through.

373
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:06,589
And then, I don't know,
I just became the girl that never left.

Are you still skating?

Yeah, I'm still skating. I'm running the skating
school over at Spencer's now, which is great.

- It's perfect. I get to skate every day.
- Good for you.

The owner gives me run of the place,
which is awesome...

...in exchange for some
small sexual favors.

Hmm. Nice of him. And you.
Great arrangement.

JUDD: No, I didn't.
