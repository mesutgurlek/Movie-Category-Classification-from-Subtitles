00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,921
Hi. I'm Johnny Knoxville.

2
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,691
Welcome to Jackass.

3
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,510
Hello. I'm Johnny Knoxville

4
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,344
and I'm about to rent a car.

5
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:39,683
What's up?

6
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,652
Uh, I have a reservation.

7
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,417
Okay, I need a driver's license
and a credit card.

8
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,422
All right.

9
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,186
I need a signature here

10
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,286
that you're going to use
your coverage instead of ours.

11
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,557
Is that white one us?

12
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,563
Yes.

13
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,966
We're gonna walk around
and inspect it together.

14
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,334
Looks pretty good.

15
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,270
I'm just looking for dents
and major scratches.

16
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,273
Yeah.

17
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,276
Something major,
gonna write it down.

18
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,606
Little ding there.

19
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:06,610
Yeah.

20
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,442
No, we'll take
good care of her.

21
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,106
Thank you.
Have a good week.

22
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,775
You, too. Thank you.

23
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,471
I'm Johnny.

24
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,476
Hey.

25
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,637
We're gonna be doing

26
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,738
a hell of a lot
of work here today.

27
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,627
Trust us. We're gonna have fun.

28
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,468
Hi. I'm Johnny Knoxville,
and this is called the...

29
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,231
Oh, fuck!

30
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,498
Shut the car off.

31
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,625
Oh, fuck!

32
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,002
I guess we didn't reinforce
the windshield.

33
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,408
That fucker comes...
missed me by that much.

34
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,448
That's why you got the roll bars
behind you, dude.

35
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,757
Whose car is this?

36
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,884
This is your guys' car.

37
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,929
I rented it
from you earlier.

38
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,930
Yes. Yeah, wha...?

39
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,932
Yeah, I hit a dog.

40
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,594
A dog isn't gonna do that.

41
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,763
Come on in.

42
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,036
I had a accident,
as you can see.

43
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,667
I was...
I mean, I drink.

44
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,609
I just black out,
so I, um...

45
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,613
Were you drinking
or anything?

46
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,615
Yeah, I had a little,
to be honest.

47
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,416
Is there any license
plates on it?

48
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,419
There was.

49
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,546
Yeah?

50
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,558
Well, hopefully you guys
will incur some of the cost.

51
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,718
Oh, no.

52
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,592
'Cause I rented it
from you guys fair and square.

53
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,461
I don't want to get stuck
with the whole charge of it.

54
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,058
Well, you are going to get stuck
with the entire thing.

55
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,397
Well, I don't think
I should.

56
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,767
I think
you guys should help.

57
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,467
No. You declined
any additional coverage.

58
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,908
Right there.
You declined it.

59
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,841
Yeah, but that's
just paperwork, you know?

60
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,005
It's a legal contract.

61
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,775
Yeah, but I was a little...
I was...

62
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,374
I had a few to drink
when I signed that, too, so...

63
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,317
We're gonna have to
get this worked out.

64
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,287
Yeah, you're gonna have
to pay for that car.

65
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,619
Well, you're gonna have to
help me pay for that car.

66
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,124
No, we don't do that.

67
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,094
I returned it
with a full tank of gas.

68
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,857
You returned
it demolished.

69
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,126
Well, it's got
a full tank of gas.

70
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,566
That's the least of our worries
right now, is the gas.

71
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,567
Oh.

72
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,194
This is
an unmitigated outrage.

73
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,432
I've never seen anything
like this before.

74
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,372
What does that mean?

75
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,172
No one's ever done that.

76
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,147
Well, I can't pay for it.

77
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,378
Well, you're gonna have to.

78
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,420
Well, I ain't.

79
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,184
Look, I'm gonna let
you two guys work it out

80
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,815
and I'm gonna go outside

81
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,986
but, um, that car's gonna
have to be paid for.

82
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,939
"F" you!

83
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,596
You all right?

84
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,505
You all right?

85
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,245
Knoxville knocked my nuts
in half.

86
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,091
This is...

87
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,033
Oh, it hurts my teeth!

88
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,105
I can't even
turn it off.

89
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,740
I thought
it was supposed to help.

90
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,748
Okay, you ready?

91
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,114
Yeah.

92
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,257
Okay, okay, I got it.
I'm taking care of you.

93
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,259
- It's all right. Okay.
- Oh, my God, it's so bad.

94
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,259
It's cool. You cool?

95
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,260
I'm good. Okay.

96
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,261
Come on.

97
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,924
Ease up. Come on.
Daddy's gotcha.

98
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,193
Oh, my God,
it's so fucking bad.

99
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,529
Daddy's gotcha. Come on.

100
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,269
Whoo!

101
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,635
You're gonna have
tits of steel.

102
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:07,638
Oh!

103
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,368
Yeah, you're so
buff right now.

104
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,636
Yeah, this goes
on the gooch.

105
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,836
Yeah, it goes-goes around.

106
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,900
This goes on the gooch.

107
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:13,911
Oh, dude, he's done.

108
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,072
Who's gonna do the gooch?

109
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,447
In case you didn't know
what the gooch is

110
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,745
the gooch is the spot

111
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,117
between your balls
and butt hole, and...

112
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,120
Ooh!

113
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,156
Oh!

114
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,631
- Ooh!
- Does it smell?

115
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,637
- Does it smell like "man"?
- Smell.

116
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:41,968
Just smell it. Just smell it.

117
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,338
Ehren, smell it.

118
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,443
No, come on.

119
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,881
All right, let's
zap my nuts.

120
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,680
Yeah, yeah,
let's get it over with.

121
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,448
- Are we ready?
- They're so gone, man.

122
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,488
Okay.

123
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,960
He likes it!
He li...

124
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,300
He likes it.

125
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,818
Afternoon. How you doing?

126
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,186
Oh...

127
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,353
Son of a bitch.

128
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,297
What happened?

129
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,164
Oh, man! Oh!

130
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,921
Aw, fuck! Oh!

131
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,660
Well, now the cats
are rockin'

132
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,466
And everyone's feeling
all right

133
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:23,338
And on a Wednesday evening,
there's sure gonna be a fight

134
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,706
Yeah, a fight

135
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,871
I say somebody's gonna get
their head kicked in tonight

136
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,108
Well, now
everybody's groovin'

137
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,241
And everyone's shouting
for more

138
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,444
More

139
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,510
I say there's gonna be
a pool of blood...

140
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,656
I say somebody's gonna get
their head kicked in tonight

141
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,490
We're gonna rip up
the chairs

142
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,859
Tear down the walls

143
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,862
Smash up the band

144
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,228
And really have a ball...

145
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,962
The whole dance hall will be
a total mess

146
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,470
Well, the cats are rockin'

147
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,268
And everyone is feelin'
all right

148
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,308
All right...

149
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,709
Whoa!

150
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,248
I say somebody's gonna get
their head kicked in tonight

151
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,282
Whoa!

152
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,854
Oh...

153
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,829
Yes! That was the best thing
I've ever seen.

154
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,596
Tear down the walls
Smash up the place

155
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,636
Really have a ball...

156
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,540
And the whole dance hall
will be a total mess...

157
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,539
Oh, fuck, dude.

158
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,133
Oh!

159
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,110
...And on a Wednesday evening,
there's sure gonna be a fight

160
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,672
Be a fight!

161
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,117
I say somebody's gonna get
their head kicked in tonight.

162
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,087
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Are you okay?

163
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,092
Get over here!

164
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,287
Help him! Help him! Help him!

165
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,294
Medic!

166
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,295
No, no, no, no.

167
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,628
Don't move him.
Don't move him!

168
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,099
Oh, shit.

169
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,499
That had bad news
written all over it.

170
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,537
Are you okay? You all right?

171
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,866
That was like the worst thing

172
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,463
that could ever happen
right there.

173
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,905
John can't drive for shit.

174
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,374
I don't know what happened.

175
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,377
I just remember we went
in the air

176
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,005
and the next thing I know
I'm... just fucked.

177
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,105
Look at that cart.

178
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,979
Dude, you were hauling
so much ass.

179
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,120
We're here in Tokyo,
and I feel like partying.

180
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,623
Hi. I'm Party Boy.

181
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,030
Oh, can I try this?

182
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,362
Here we go.

183
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,800
It's my party music.

184
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,771
You like it?

185
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,103
Kind of makes you
wanna party, huh?

186
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,473
Kind of feel like
partying right now.

187
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,972
Ready?

188
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,779
See, that's what
the big ones do

189
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,616
but sometimes
they don't wanna...

190
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,781
Ow!

191
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,289
Fuck!

192
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,620
Don't pull on it, man.

193
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,422
You can't pry
his mouth open.

194
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,889
It's slowly
getting weightless.

195
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,898
Is he over?

196
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,229
No, you're twisting him!

197
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,893
You're fuckin' twisting him!

198
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,769
Oh, fuck!
He's-He's got my nipple, dude.

199
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,068
He's got my fuckin' nipple.

200
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,870
Wait, wait, wait,
he's gonna help you.

201
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,911
I know. I know.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

202
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:20,911
Hang on.
Don't move.

203
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,574
Oh! Ow...

204
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,911
You little bastard!

205
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,952
Oh, look at the teeth marks.

206
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,618
Man.

207
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,758
I'm Bunny the Lifeguard

208
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,804
and if any of these alligators
try to ruin our swimming,

209
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,395
I'm gonna wrestle them down

210
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,441
and probably have my way
with them.

211
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,476
If he falls
and he lands near an alligator,

212
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,943
an alligator grabs ahold of him,
Steve-O will relax,

213
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,207
let the alligator take him

214
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,373
and hopefully the alligator
will release him.

215
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,384
Hi. I'm Steve-O, and this is...

216
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,218
Oh, shit.

217
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,022
There's no such thing
as failure, Steve-O.

218
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,027
Take another step.

219
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,028
You got it.

220
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,257
Aah.

221
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,857
One thing I know is
good tightrope-walking.

222
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,628
Oh, no.

223
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,898
Oh, yes.

224
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,566
You're cool.
You're good.

225
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,269
Put the chicken
on him!

226
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,577
Yeah!

227
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,772
Yeah!

228
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,909
Oh, shit.

229
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:33,917
There you go.

230
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,044
Yeah, there you go.

231
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,815
Food, food, food,
food, food.

232
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,254
Go back the other way.

233
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,257
No, keep going, Steve-O.

234
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,952
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

235
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,826
Yeah!

236
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,061
Come on, Steve-O,
keep your head up!

237
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,628
Keep your head up,
Steve-O!

238
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,200
Keep your head up!
Keep your head up!

239
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,269
- You guys, you gotta do this!
- Keep your head up!

240
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,278
Keep your butt up!

241
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,974
You got it!
All right, all right!

242
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,142
Keep your butt...

243
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,892
Put it in your ass
and let him take it.

244
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,892
Come on.

245
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:16,893
Oh!

246
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,224
Stick the bone up your ass.

247
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,491
And let him pull it out.

248
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,092
Get ready.

249
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,737
Stay there.
Don't move. Don't move.

250
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,739
It'll be over
before you know it.

251
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,035
Don't look! Don't look!

252
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,041
Steve-O, don't look.

253
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,202
Don't look! Don't look!

254
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,403
Don't move! Don't move!

255
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,606
Hold still! Hold still!

256
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,241
He's going to the tail of it.

257
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,047
Don't look. - Don't look!
- Don't move! Don't move!

258
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,899
I ran straight
into a crocodile.

259
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,458
What the hell.

260
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,764
Oh, my God.

261
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,771
Why can't you walk
on a tightrope?

262
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,363
I don't know.

263
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,567
I thought you'd do it.

264
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,038
Yeah.

265
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,045
I just... I don't know, man.

266
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,444
I'm sure I could learn

267
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,416
but today... you know...
today was my first try.

268
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,715
I'm Bam Margera,
and my parents are dead asleep.

269
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,983
It's 12:42 right now

270
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,151
and Phil has to be at work
at 5:00 in the morning.

271
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,821
So he's trying to get
a good night's sleep

272
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,922
and I'm gonna go
wake his ass up.

273
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,269
I'm dying!

274
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,378
Holy shit!

275
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,377
Oh, my God, I'm
opening the windows.

276
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,610
Gettin' crazy over here.

277
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,947
Look at Phil's tummy.

278
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,953
Oh! Oh, my God!

279
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,752
Phil, you gotta be up
for 5:00 in the morning tonight.

280
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,452
6:00, I gotta be at work.

281
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,494
Yo, here he comes.

282
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,401
Here he comes. Here he comes.

283
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,801
Jesus Christ, Bam!

284
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,733
I almost broke my leg
getting out of there!

285
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,327
There's shit
all over the goddamn...

286
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,633
How am I going to work now?

287
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,422
Go!

288
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,121
I... oh! Jesus!

289
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,288
That woman in the corner
cold playin' the role

290
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,958
Leave her ass in the corner
till her feet gets cold

291
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,831
Knowin' for a fact
that girl is wack

292
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,598
If you hold your hand out,
she'll turn her back

293
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,867
Better walk, don't talk,
she's all pretend

294
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,840
Can't be her friend
unless you spend

295
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,069
Aah!

296
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,738
Wall to wall after all,
get ready to throw

297
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,075
All your money at the bitch

298
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,708
'Cause she thinks
she's so... phisticated

299
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,485
So... phisticated

300
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,185
So... phisticated

301
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,462
So... phisticated.

302
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,662
What are you doing?

303
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,721
You know, I oughta
arrest you right now

304
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,322
with all that
in your clothes.

305
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,526
What's wrong with you?

306
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,966
What are you
talking about?

307
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,469
Get this out of
your pocket, man!

308
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,469
That's all me!

309
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,302
- All of this!
- All of that! That's all me!

310
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,343
What is this bullshit?

311
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,915
- What is the meaning of this?
- Those are my bananas.

312
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,483
Don't never come in
here no more, man!

313
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,483
What are you...?

314
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,484
Get out!

315
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,750
And take the other stuff
out of your pockets.

316
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:12,755
Geez!

317
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:13,813
Get it all out!

318
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,359
That's how you treat
an old man?

319
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,724
Get out! Go!

320
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,286
An old man that steals,
I can't believe it.

321
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,801
Hey, man, what kind of games
you play? Get out!

322
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:30,766
Get out, man!

323
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,934
Goddamn it!

324
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,946
What is wrong with you?

325
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,645
Get out!

326
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,821
Man, quit playing!

327
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,397
I was Lon Chaney's lover!

328
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,437
Go back and love him!

329
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,107
So, we're gonna go
to this hardware store...

330
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,665
they sell toilets...

331
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,507
and, uh, I'm gonna take a shit
right in one of the toilets.

332
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,568
I'm gonna shit my pants

333
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,205
before we get
to that fuckin' place.

334
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,749
Dave, fight it, man.

335
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,285
And I don't even want to make
a joke about it right now

336
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,842
because I just want
to hold it in.

337
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:16,853
Gotta poo?

338
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:17,854
Pretty much.

339
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:18,855
Really? Yeah.

340
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:19,856
Really, man, don't.

341
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,119
Do you want
to ruin everything?

342
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,125
I swear to God, it's...

343
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,126
Really? That bad?

344
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,355
Yeah, like it's a problem.

345
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,659
Is this the worst
you ever had to go boom-boom?

346
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:27,663
No, no.

347
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,290
I shit my pants at the fair.

348
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,028
Oh, dude,
he's shitting right now.

349
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,034
Get outta the car!

350
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,094
Oh, get out, dude, get out!

351
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,605
No shit, get outta here!

352
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,906
Come on, man,
get outta the fuckin' car.

353
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,977
Get outta the fuckin' car!

354
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,113
What do I do?

355
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,482
Did you shit?

356
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,615
Holy shit!

357
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,886
I'm taking a cab
back to the hotel.

358
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,452
He just shat everywhere.

359
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,608
What's wrong, man?

360
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,876
I had to sit there

361
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,611
while he shat.

362
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,120
I need to go home right now.

363
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,716
It's on my hand.

364
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,216
Is that a bolt?

365
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,419
We have very...

366
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,483
What the hell

367
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,494
you doing?

368
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,894
What's that?
What are you doing?

369
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,898
Oh, I'm sorry.

370
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,730
I'm almost done.

371
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,030
I hope you didn't
take a shit

372
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,070
in that son of a bitch.

373
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,901
You take a shit in there

374
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,100
you get to clean it out, pal.

375
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:22,605
That is disgusting, man.

376
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,649
What a fuckin' "Froot Loop."

377
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,790
Want to playback?

378
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,436
Ow!

379
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,995
What the fuck? What the...?

380
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,111
Got him, dude.

381
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,613
Turn around.
Let's see it.

382
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,943
That was so much...

383
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:09,015
Oh... no!

384
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,501
- Yeah.
- Look at me.

385
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,501
That's a good one.

386
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,537
We're ready.

387
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,136
I'm Ehren McGhehey,
and this is the mousetrap.

388
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,610
You'll be the cat,
I'll be the mouse

389
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,479
You'll be the cat,
and I'll be the mouse

390
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,144
You'll be the cat
and I'll be the mouse...

391
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,619
Go, go, go, go!

392
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,489
...You'll be the cat,
yeah, I'll be the mouse

393
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:48,191
You'll be the cat
and I'll be the mouse

394
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,460
You'll be the cat, baby,
I'll be the mouse

395
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,466
Oh!

396
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,437
Oh...

397
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,272
Ow. All right!
All right! All right!

398
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,209
...You'll be the cat...
- Ow!

399
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,877
Aah! Come on!

400
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:05,881
Come on.

401
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,713
Okay, that's enough.

402
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,549
That's enough!
That's enough!

403
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,589
I call it! Hey! Time!

404
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,301
This isn't gonna work.

405
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,529
It might.

406
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,200
Wh-What's gonna happen here?

407
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,470
I don't know

408
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,012
but it's not quite
what's going to be intended.

409
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,311
Raab's putting
a fucking tampon on.

410
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,212
That's like
a Courtney Love-sized maxipad.

411
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,551
Dudes, this is, like,
worse than a hanging.

412
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:49,958
I'm Raab Himself and I'm
a complete fucking idiot.

413
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,332
Oh, that's funny.

414
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,597
It didn't work.

415
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,603
Nope.

416
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,196
We gotta get
another one, man.

417
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,399
Let's do it again.

418
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:07,912
Hey, I'm Raab Himself,
and this is Bungee Wedgie.

419
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:28,489
Is that your shitty ass, dude?

420
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,830
Look at the bloody,
shitty underpants.

421
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,563
Didn't give me a wedgie.

422
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:33,569
I went forward.

423
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:34,605
I can't believe it.

424
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,838
All right, we're here
in the Valley today

425
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,904
to do our own little
riot control test.

426
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,175
This is George Hruska.

427
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,251
All right, George,
uh, what do you do

428
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,183
All right, George,
uh, what do you do

429
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,015
and what are we
doing here today?

430
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,419
Well, I'm vice president
of operations

431
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,888
with ALS Technologies.

432
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,925
We manufacture
less-lethal ammunition.

433
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,325
We're one of the top
manufacturing companies

434
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,589
in the United States

435
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,598
and we're going to shoot you
with one of our projectiles.

436
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,133
It's called the pen-prevent.

437
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:07,137
It's a 40-gram,
tail-stabilized bag.

438
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:11,073
It'll be traveling
about 250 feet per second.

439
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,609
Is that lethal?

440
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:16,374
It's considered less lethal.

441
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,678
So, this morning I thought
I was taking it in the chest

442
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,378
with the beanbag projectile,

443
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,647
but George and his
company said no way

444
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,689
'cause if it hits me
in the heart,

445
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,850
I'm pretty much
done with, so, uh...

446
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,450
We want to take every
single precaution...

447
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:30,619
Right.

448
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,822
...necessary to help
protect your vital organs.

449
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,091
Where are my intestines?

450
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,291
Are they in that area?

451
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,298
I think so.

452
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,834
Awesome.

453
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,871
Ugh.

454
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,069
So you're gonna take
some practice shots?

455
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,270
Right.

456
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,248
Jesus Christ.

457
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,444
Yeah.

458
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,852
You know, this is nothing
to be messing around with.

459
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,323
This is nothing
for anybody

460
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,622
to just be thrown
into a.12-gauge shotgun

461
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,255
and-and, uh, you know,
think they could take it.

462
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,027
You know, that's one
of the reasons I'm doing this

463
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,660
is because I can do this
in a controlled state.

464
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,275
Safety's off.

465
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,648
Going hot.

466
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,306
That really hurt.

467
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,347
That looked like it hurt.

468
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,972
Oh, fuck, dude.

469
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,141
Did you see the way

470
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,244
I caught that beanbag
with my stomach?

471
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,618
That's instinct.

472
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:08,147
You can't teach that.

473
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,488
Oh!

474
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,931
It hurts so much.

475
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:21,631
Like going from a prone position
to standing is... ooh!

476
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,472
Ouch.

477
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,645
Hi. I'm Wee Man,
and this is a big cone.

478
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,300
Oh, my God, my brakes!

479
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,396
I can't...

480
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,667
My brakes!

481
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:34,542
My brakes! My brakes!

482
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,637
Stop me! Stop me!

483
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,113
Stop me!

484
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,352
Oh!

485
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,321
- You all right?
- That was so fast!

486
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,721
- You all right?
- Yeah.

487
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,383
You have...
Your brakes go out?

488
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,290
Yeah. The whole thing
doesn't work.

489
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,293
Really?

490
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,829
Will you push me to the top?

491
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,023
I wanna do it again.

492
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,104
I could sure go
for a Miller High Life.

493
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,489
Oh, you're
in so much trouble.

494
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,766
Kick her ass!

495
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,718
I'm about to get the shit
kicked out of me by a girl.

496
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,696
Dude, I told you
to keep up the left!

497
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,106
Oh...

498
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,269
I'm not gonna agree!

499
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,757
...seven... eight... nine...

500
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,298
ten.

501
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,468
That's the winner.
That's it.

502
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,594
And the winner.

503
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,069
And still champion.

504
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,664
Now pronounce her name.

505
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,577
Look at his bloody mouthpiece.

506
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,206
Oh, God, my jaw is, like,
two inches to the left.

507
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,342
I seriously felt all right
for a little bit

508
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,784
until she punched me
in the nose.

509
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,049
I knew she was fighting dirty.

510
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,828
One, two, three, four.

511
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,965
Oh, Jesus!

512
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,905
Go grab the dead kitty.

513
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,744
Dude, I've fuckin' been in there
before, dude. It sucks.

514
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:30,548
When the days are short
and the nights are long

515
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,057
And I walk and they walk

516
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,185
I twist and they twist

517
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,253
And I shimmy and they shimmy

518
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,595
And I fly and they fly

519
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,328
Well, we're out there
having fun

520
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,368
In the warm California sun

521
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,570
Where they're out there
havin' fun

522
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,905
In the warm California sun

523
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,878
Where they're out there
havin' fun

524
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,643
In the warm California sun.

525
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,910
Yeah!

526
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,281
Whoo!

527
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,356
Oh, God!

528
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,213
I've got your picture

529
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,516
Of me and you

530
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,250
You wrote I love you

531
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,259
I love you too

532
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,352
I sit there staring when
there's nothing else to do

533
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,489
Oh, it's in color

534
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:51,034
Your hair is brown

535
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,468
Your eyes are hazel

536
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:56,028
And soft as clouds

537
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,632
I often kiss you when there's no
one else around

538
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,271
I've got your picture,
I've got your picture

539
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,250
I'd like a million of you
over myself

540
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,152
I want a doctor
to take your picture

541
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,554
So I can look at you
from inside as well

542
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,558
You got me turning up
and turning down

543
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,594
I'm turning in,
I'm turning round

544
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,391
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese

545
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,430
I really think so

546
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,897
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese

547
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,901
I really think so

548
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,242
I've got your picture,
I've got your picture

549
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,253
I'd like a million of 'em
over myself

550
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,516
I want a doctor
to take your picture

551
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,614
So I can look at you
from inside as well

552
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,354
I'm turning up,
I'm turning down

553
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,293
I'm turning in,
I'm turning round

554
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,921
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese

555
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,022
I really think so

556
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,828
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese

557
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,736
I really think so

558
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,172
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese

559
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:07,039
I really think so

560
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,204
I'm turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese

561
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,748
I really think so...

562
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,845
Since we no longer have
to bleep cuss words,

563
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,414
I promise I will get my mom
to say, "Fuck"

564
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,982
by the end of this movie.

565
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,224
Hello. I'm Johnny Knoxville

566
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,892
and we're about to test
my rocket skates.

567
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,929
Go!

568
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,275
All right, this is
rocket skates, take two.

569
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,697
This one's gonna be
a little more powerful

570
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:01,697
than the last one, so...

571
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,199
Why, these are
different bottle rockets?

572
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,359
No, there's
just more of them.

573
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:28,655
Ow.

574
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,291
Oh, fuck!

575
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,454
What's wrong?

576
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,988
I fell and busted my ass,
that's what's fuckin' wrong.

577
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,503
That's it.

578
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,199
No more rocket skates.

579
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:49,135
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

580
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,408
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

581
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,245
Oh...

582
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,841
- That's the way
- Uh-huh

583
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,079
Uh-huh, I like it

584
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,087
- Uh-huh
- Uh-huh

585
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,087
- That's the way
- Uh-huh

586
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,088
Uh-huh, I like it

587
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,148
- Uh-huh
- Uh-huh

588
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,285
That's the way...

589
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,028
God, this party sucks!

590
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:52,902
Hey, my man... wasabi, lots.

591
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,444
Wasabi.

592
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,280
Yeah!

593
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:02,684
So today, I'm gonna treat myself
to some...

594
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,485
Blech!

595
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,153
Little circles.

596
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,526
God, chopsticks are so stupid.

597
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,301
That looks like
a pretty good line, huh?

598
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,072
Whoa!

599
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:31,481
More.

600
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:33,778
Do another one.

601
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,148
Do another snooter.

602
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,356
I need a pick-me-up.

603
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,009
Oh...

604
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,285
Look out!

605
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,490
God, get back here!

606
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,425
I said, "Get back here!"

607
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,799
Get... Hey!

608
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:46,950
My transistor radio
comes from far away

609
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,651
And when it's night
over here

610
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,387
Over there,
it's a-breaking day

611
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:58,229
I remember all the good times
I had a-walking in the sand

612
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,139
With a beautiful girl
that I met made in Japan.

613
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,939
This is bullshit!

614
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,549
Ow!

615
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,137
Uh-oh.

616
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,274
Phil?

617
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,076
Phil?!

618
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,617
Phil?!

619
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,982
Hey, Phil!

620
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,252
Oh, my God.

621
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,588
Is this thing real?!

622
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,529
What thing?

623
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,464
This alligator?!

624
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,467
What?

625
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,525
Look, look, look!

626
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:08,036
Look around the corner!

627
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,442
What is that?

628
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:13,601
Where have you been?!

629
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:15,770
Don't you even look? Oh!

630
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:19,514
Oh, my God!

631
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,572
It's moving!

632
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,016
Look, Phil!

633
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,917
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

634
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,251
I don't know
what to do now.

635
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,291
Aren't you scared to death?!

636
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,129
Ooh, it's so gross
that it's even on the floor.

637
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,565
I'm going out! I'm leaving!

638
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:37,725
Where's my keys?

639
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,632
That is the scariest
fucking thing

640
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,261
I ever saw in my whole life!

641
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,566
- I'm leaving.
- Don't leave.

642
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,663
Where the hell you going?

643
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,901
I'm leaving.
I swear to God!

644
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,909
Phil, seriously, please.

645
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,571
How are we going to get
this thing out of here!

646
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:50,977
I'm scared to death!

647
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:54,810
Oh, God!

648
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,685
Aw, man.

649
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,283
No! No!

650
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,884
No, I'm not going near it!

651
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,519
No, no! God, where is it?

652
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,895
Oh, great!
You don't have it, do you?

653
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:09,933
He's not there?

654
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,902
Seriously, is that real?!

655
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,403
I'm serious. Is it real?

656
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:15,904
Is it real?

657
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,099
- Is it real?
- Yes.

658
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:21,141
How dare you bring that
in this house!

659
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,451
Dude, dude.

660
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,452
Ow! Wait a minute!

661
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:31,510
Stop! Chill, dude.

662
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,921
Look at that.
He kicked your ass, dude.

663
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,890
I didn't even
get you.

664
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,757
You got beat up by Wee Man.

665
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:39,761
Dude.

666
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,922
Let me see.

667
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,158
He didn't even get you.

668
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,426
Where? I didn't even...

669
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,797
He didn't even get you.

670
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,201
Oh!

671
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,967
Let me see the back
of your head.

672
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,369
It'll be all right.

673
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:57,137
I'm here with Eric Koston
and Clyde Singleton

674
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,614
and today I'm gonna
50/50 this rail,

675
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,708
and... or try to.

676
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:02,877
So, this thing's long.

677
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:03,885
Yeah, thanks.

678
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,921
Thanks for reminding me.

679
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,652
You got it.

680
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:13,724
I got it.

681
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:14,923
I got this.

682
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,359
Do you know,
is he gonna go?

683
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:18,992
- Yeah.
- Is he gonna go?

684
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,900
He's gonna go somewhere.

685
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:21,903
He's goin'.

686
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,803
Yeah, he's goin', yeah.

687
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,069
My impression
of Johnny Knoxville.

688
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,111
Something like this.

689
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,644
Ow, my face!

690
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,375
I'm Johnny Knoxville

691
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,940
and I'm gonna grind
this rail.

692
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:38,814
Ready, set, go!

693
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:49,589
Yeah! Yeah!

694
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,099
Yeah!

695
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,658
He made it
all the way down.

696
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:54,101
I can't believe he got
that far.

697
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,570
I can't believe
he got that far.

698
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,402
You made it
to the fucking bottom!

699
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:58,441
I can't, I can't...

700
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:21,796
This is the paper cuts.

701
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:22,797
I'm getting paper cuts

702
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,891
between the webbings
of my fingers

703
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,765
and the webbings of my toes.

704
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,896
Hold it still.
There's no good way to do it.

705
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,462
Yeah, I know.
So just deal with it.

706
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,598
Take a... take a breath.

707
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,938
Ow! Ow!

708
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:41,914
Oh, you can feel
when it goes in.

709
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,451
Oh, this one works good.

710
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,612
Gimme the next one.

711
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:46,656
Do it. Do it.

712
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:51,819
Ow!

713
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:54,090
Oh, yeah, opened up
with a good one.

714
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,256
Did you hear that?

715
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,197
- Oh, that was my flesh!
- Oh, dude.

716
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,201
If I do your hand,
you'll forget

717
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,203
about the pain
in your foot.

718
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,704
That is a good point.

719
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,536
Take a deep breath.

720
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,769
Aah!

721
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,008
Lance is trying...

722
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,176
Are you gonna puke?

723
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,686
- Watch Lance pass out.
- Lance is gonna puke!

724
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:20,552
From what, the pepperoni
or the paper cuts?

725
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,023
Both?

726
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,219
The pepperoni?

727
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,740
Is he okay?
I don't know.

728
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,900
Wait, is he all right?

729
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,910
- Medic!
- Hey, don't knock over the beer.

730
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:42,136
Are you okay?

731
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,201
Yeah, I'm good.

732
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,218
Steve-O, if you want to do
some more, do it.

733
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,480
I'm done.

734
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:52,487
Is everybody ready?

735
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,488
Yeah.

736
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:54,489
Okay.

737
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:55,525
That looks funny.

738
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:02,096
Now that sucked!

739
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,564
God, am I glad I came down

740
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,726
to see what was going on
in this room.

741
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,139
Mm-hmm.

742
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,446
Wait a minute.

743
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,951
I know what my fortune is.

744
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,317
It's partying.

745
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:49,578
This is...

746
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,614
Oh!

747
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,283
I like big butts
and I cannot lie

748
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,080
I like big butts
and I cannot lie

749
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,585
You other brothers
can't deny

750
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,416
That when a girl walks in
with an itty-bitty waist

751
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,319
And a round thing in your face
you get sprung

752
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,652
Oh!

753
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,319
I wanna pull up front, cuz I
notice that butt was stuffed

754
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,487
Deep in the jeans
she's wearin'

755
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,827
I'm hooked and I can't
stop starin', oh, baby

756
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,766
I wanna get wit ya
and take your picture

757
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,268
My homeboys tried to warn me

758
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,600
- But that butt you got makes
- Me so horny

759
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:17,264
Ooh, rump of smooth skin

760
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,932
You say you wanna get
in my Benz

761
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:20,476
Well, use me, use me

762
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,205
'Cuz you ain't
that average groupie

763
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,680
I want 'em
real thick and juicy

764
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,944
So find that juicy double

765
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:30,350
Mix-a-Iot's in trouble, beggin'
for a piece of that bubble

766
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,547
So I'm lookin'
at rock videos

767
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,214
Knock-kneed bimbos
walkin' like ho's

768
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,724
You can have them bimbos

769
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:38,158
I'll keep my women
like Flo Jo

770
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:39,695
So your girlfriend rolls
a Honda

771
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,822
Playin' workout tapes
by Fonda

772
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,230
But Fonda ain't got a motor
in the back of her Honda

773
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:48,931
My anaconda don't want none
unless you got buns, hun

774
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,495
You can do side bends or sit-ups

775
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,508
But please don't lose
that butt

776
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,271
Some brothers wanna play
that hard role

777
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:55,971
And tell you
that the butt ain't gold

778
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,979
So they toss it and leave it

779
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,981
And I pull up quick
to retrieve it

780
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,550
So, ladies,
if the butt is round

781
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,018
And you want
a triple-x throw down

782
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:06,920
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT,
and kick them nasty thoughts

783
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,991
Baby got back

784
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,091
Baby got back.

785
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,941
Oh, honey,
it's been a while.

786
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,601
It's a little too much.

787
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:28,974
No.

788
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,284
Irving, you think
you can do it?

789
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,444
You want a spot?

790
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,782
No, I got it.
I got it.

791
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:38,878
You got it?
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,583
If you need a spot,
just give me a call.

793
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,818
Okay.

794
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:56,301
What's the quickest
you ever knocked anyone out?

795
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,273
I hold
the California state record.

796
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,139
It's like 18 seconds,
including the-the 10-count.

797
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:03,577
I took it to the jaw,
I took it to the jaw

798
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:06,172
One, two, three,
there was never a doubt

799
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:08,774
We want fun,
and you might as well face it

800
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,911
We want fun, yeah,
you better believe it

801
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:14,353
We want fun,
no, you don't understand

802
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:16,358
Fun, fun, fun, fun,
make your demands

803
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:19,520
We want fun
and we can taste it

804
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,496
Yes, everybody get wasted!

805
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:24,398
I think
you're gonna break that today.

806
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:25,729
I'm Johnny Knoxville.

807
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:26,734
And I'm Butterbean.

808
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:29,101
Today, we're gonna do
a little boxing.

809
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,149
All right, you guys,

810
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,349
touch gloves
and come out fighting.

811
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:04,539
Get up!

812
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:05,540
Aw, man.

813
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,576
One more time.

814
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,545
This is the last time
you're kicking my ass.

815
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:10,671
One more time.

816
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,715
More pain. That's it.

817
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,111
You haven't even hit me.

818
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:17,244
Hit me once, at least.

819
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,287
There you go.

820
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:31,634
He's out.

821
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:43,512
Is Butterbean okay?

822
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,683
Look at this.

823
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,691
And by knockout
in the first round...

824
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,693
new champion, Butterbean!

825
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,922
Whoo! Yeah!

826
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,191
Where we going, Knoxville?

827
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:03,562
The hospital.

828
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,897
What the hell are
we doing that for?

829
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:06,901
I don't know.

830
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,200
Apparently,
I have a big gash in my head

831
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,263
and I think
I'm a little concussed.

832
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,206
Are you giving me a shot?

833
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,265
Yeah.

834
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:15,276
Yeah.

835
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:16,277
Are you okay?

836
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:17,278
Mm-hmm.

837
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,747
- We got one more to go, buddy.
- Yes, sir.

838
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,078
Then you're a free man.

839
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,243
Thank you.

840
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,412
You're gonna be
not feeling great

841
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,182
the next 24 hours.

842
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,814
- Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
- Okay.

843
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:31,793
You'll probably see me
in two or three days.

844
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:39,828
Hey! Hey!

845
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,671
Goddamn it!

846
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,934
What are you doing?

847
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,270
Hey! Get off, man!

848
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,708
- What's going on here?
- Get off!

849
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,745
Get off!

850
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,181
We're in Okinawa

851
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,887
and we're about to go swim
with some whale sharks

852
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,793
but first...

853
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,832
we need to go rub one out.

854
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:17,898
Well, I made the mistake
of showing them

855
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:21,170
what sea cucumbers do
when they're threatened

856
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:22,802
and that is, you know,

857
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,642
as soon
as something touches them,

858
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,011
these white threads come

859
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,447
out of the end of it

860
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:31,351
and, uh, Steve-O and Chris
thought it was a great idea.

861
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:34,254
So, they're out there
trying to, uh...

862
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:35,256
Masturbate?

863
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,917
...masturbate, yeah.

864
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,290
So, anyway, I-I apologize.

865
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,934
This is the...

866
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:50,335
With a simple shave
of the razor

867
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,932
Steve-O easily
disguises himself...

868
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,703
to fool the whale
sharks into thinking

869
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:55,972
he's a harmless young boy.

870
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,241
I am pretty nervous
about my wiener

871
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,112
around that whale
shark; I really am.

872
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,550
Now, the best way to think
of the whale sharks

873
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,383
they're like big
puppy dogs. Uh...

874
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,547
Sometimes puppies bite.

875
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:08,113
Puppies,
they have little teeth.

876
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,988
They have little teeth.
Little teeth.

877
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,890
You're gonna get a gummer.

878
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,053
All right.

879
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,393
So, it's kinda like being
with a gal with no teeth.

880
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:16,591
- Kind of, yes.
- Yeah.

881
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:19,897
So right below in these waters,
30-foot whale sharks

882
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,301
are waiting to eat
these freakin' shrimp

883
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:23,532
out of our crotches.

884
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,573
Okay.

885
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,673
Oh!

886
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:34,074
Oh, they kind of... they pinch.

887
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,447
Are these alive?

888
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,878
Aah!

889
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,387
They don't feel good
on the way...

890
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,388
You're part of this.

891
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,986
Look at this shrimp.

892
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,426
I guess I don't really have
any last words.

893
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,935
I'm just gonna kill myself
once I lose my wiener.

894
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:58,973
Come on, baby,
let's do the twist

895
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,275
Come on, baby

896
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,713
Let's do the twist

897
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:10,882
You look fine, yeah

898
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,855
When you go like this

899
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,855
Tell me, baby

900
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:23,331
Have you seen my sis?

901
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:25,890
Tell me, baby

902
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:28,435
Have you seen my sis?

903
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:33,142
She knows how to rock

904
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,234
And do the cha-cha twist

905
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,369
Aha

906
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:40,473
Hey, cha-cha-cha

907
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:44,008
Whoa, baby, cha-cha-cha.

908
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,955
My penis is really small now.

909
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,461
I can't really look cool
right now.

910
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,834
Hi. I'm Johnny Knoxville.

911
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,394
This is the tidal wave. Go.

912
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,708
How'd it look?

913
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:15,842
It looked good.

914
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,050
You just got... creamed.

915
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,963
Ooh!

916
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:27,258
Ooh!

917
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,662
I don't even, like,
pick a tattoo, like...

918
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,892
unless I'm pretty sure

919
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:33,901
that people are gonna laugh
every time they see it.

920
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,870
Oh, my God, dude.

921
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,873
Like, how do you perform

922
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,282
the fuckin' world's
dumbest tattoo?

923
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:55,113
Fuck, man, at least I don't have
to look at it, right?

924
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:05,527
My name is Henry Rollins
and this is...

925
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,938
Yeah!

926
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:15,238
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

927
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:26,655
This is really gonna
fuck you up!

928
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,792
Prissy motherfucker!

929
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,979
It's a total smiley face, dude.

930
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:15,202
Oh! Oh!

931
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,241
I just fully got a haircut
just, like, a week ago.

932
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:27,907
You're about to get
many more.

933
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:34,184
Oh!

934
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,090
Oh!

935
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,092
Yeah, me, too.

936
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:39,128
I am not doing it.

937
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:45,298
Look at Ehren.

938
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,336
Oh!

939
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,633
Oh, shit!

940
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,968
So, we're finding it
a little bit chilly in Japan.

941
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,637
We're gonna warm ourselves up
with some fireworks.

942
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:57,680
Uh-huh.

943
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:02,915
Let's go, dude.

944
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:05,283
Roll back there, just a bit.

945
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,618
Oh, no!
This is a bad angle.

946
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:08,714
Switch.

947
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:09,917
Oh, no, no, no.

948
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:10,924
Uh...

949
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:11,925
Oh.

950
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,518
Uh...

951
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:16,121
Ow!

952
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,833
Like, an ember fell
right in my corn hole, dude.

953
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,535
All right,
Johnny's double-knotting it.

954
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,601
Double knot it, but gently.

955
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:50,989
You may think
this next stunt is impossible.

956
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:53,626
You gotta squat a little,
Pontius.

957
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:54,795
Oh!

958
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:55,963
Ew!

959
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,699
Every time!

960
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,706
Ew!

961
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,675
Is Chris's dick
shorter or...

962
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:02,608
Yeah, it's a
little shorter.

963
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:07,915
Ow!

964
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,576
Keep it in! Hold it!

965
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:10,619
Stick...

966
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,226
It almost hit Loomis
in the face.

967
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,768
Goddamn, this is the...

968
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,933
Let's get fucked up...

969
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,876
Fuck!

970
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,879
...Let's get fucked up...

971
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:38,971
Mother!

972
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:43,679
...Let's get fucked up...
What a dumb-ass idea.

973
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,853
...Let's get fucked up...

974
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:50,552
I'm surrounded by cacti.

975
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:51,888
For fuck's sake.

976
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:53,053
Cactus!

977
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,289
It's cacti!

978
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:55,625
It's cactus.

979
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,928
Whatever it is, it hurts.

980
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:19,121
You wanna get up and cross?

981
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,363
This is the yellow snow cone.

982
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:35,095
Pack it in there nice and tight.

983
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,442
Little cold out here.

984
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,102
It might take a second.

985
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:45,306
Oh! There we go.

986
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,512
I'm not even worried
about the pee.

987
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,075
I'm just worried about...

988
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:53,121
Come on,
you're missing the cone, dude!

989
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:54,121
I'm sorry.

990
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:58,957
You're missing the cone!

991
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:01,155
You better eat
that whole thing, too.

992
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,061
You gotta go eat
that spot, too.

993
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,396
Aw!

994
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,265
Enjoy the snow cone.

995
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,405
Aw, you just wasted
a whole bunch!

996
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,907
Dude, get that whole mouthful
right there.

997
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,169
Keep going!

998
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,473
Keep going!

999
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,479
- Eat it!
- Come on, it's your pee.

1000
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:19,479
Oh, come on.

1001
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:21,482
I'm trying. It's so cold.

1002
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,484
Swallow it!
Swallow it!

1003
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:24,917
Oh, God.

1004
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:25,919
Eat it!

1005
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:27,250
Swallow it!

1006
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,847
- No, no, don't...
- Oh, no, no. Oh, no puking.

1007
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:29,914
I'm doing it!

1008
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,549
Don't look at it.

1009
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,130
Dude, it's dripping
out the bottom.

1010
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,223
Will you catch that,
what's dripping out the bottom?

1011
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:44,135
Oh, my God!

1012
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:46,140
Oh, my God!

1013
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,144
Oh, that was bad.

1014
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:56,882
That sucked!

1015
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,317
Kick yourself in the head,
Wee Man.

1016
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,914
This is totally better.

1017
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,277
What are you doing?

1018
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,682
Are you starting

1019
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,548
to lose your mind
on that shit?

1020
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:04,711
Bam, stop it!

1021
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:07,585
Now, you're getting crazy
on this shit.

1022
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,225
"Ape!"

1023
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,228
He's starting to lose it!

1024
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,264
Jesus Christ!

1025
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,103
Ape, I need toilet paper!

1026
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:21,535
Ape, I need toilet paper!

1027
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:24,129
Okay, this is called the...

1028
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,298
When people tee off

1029
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,865
when they're coming down
with their swing,

1030
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:29,911
we're gonna blow
these air horns.

1031
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:48,428
Here she goes again.

1032
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:49,691
No. It's another one?

1033
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,398
She still hit it pretty good.

1034
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:21,596
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?

1035
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,393
That I'd come over here
and kick your ass.

1036
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:25,058
Here, you lost
your club. Sorry.

1037
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:27,295
Didn't I tell you
I was going to come over here

1038
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:28,563
and kick your ass
for that?

1039
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:30,229
But... I'm sorry.
I got bursitis.

1040
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:31,603
- You got bursitis?
- Yeah.

1041
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:33,574
So, that means you gotta play
with a horn?

1042
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:34,574
It helps.

1043
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:36,372
I'll give you something
to play with, pal.

1044
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:39,608
Sorry.
It won't happen again.

1045
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,658
- Oh, fuck!
- He's teeing off!

1046
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:57,926
Get down! Get down!

1047
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,968
Oh, shit!

1048
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:06,066
Get back.
Get down, get down.

1049
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,804
Watch this! Wait. Wait.

1050
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:26,789
Oh, these things
are scary.

1051
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:30,107
I'm Bam Margera.

1052
01:09:30,184 --> 01:09:31,344
I'm Johnny Knoxville.

1053
01:09:31,419 --> 01:09:34,411
And we're gonna be
burglars today.

1054
01:09:43,164 --> 01:09:44,654
Oh, God!

1055
01:09:44,732 --> 01:09:46,097
Fuck! Get the diamonds!

1056
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:49,034
Dude, I told you not
to fall off the damn beam.

1057
01:09:49,103 --> 01:09:50,695
Turn around!

1058
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:52,068
Fuck!

1059
01:09:56,143 --> 01:09:59,579
Aw, holy fuck!

1060
01:09:59,647 --> 01:10:01,615
Idiot!

1061
01:10:04,151 --> 01:10:05,243
Go!

1062
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:06,616
Oh, fuck!

1063
01:10:11,926 --> 01:10:13,257
You all right?

1064
01:10:13,327 --> 01:10:14,259
You okay?

1065
01:10:14,328 --> 01:10:15,590
I'm good. I'm good.

1066
01:10:15,663 --> 01:10:17,597
What'd you think happened
right there?

1067
01:10:17,665 --> 01:10:18,927
It's embarrassing.

1068
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:20,556
I was barely
halfway through the ceiling

1069
01:10:20,635 --> 01:10:21,932
and you were already
out the door.

1070
01:10:22,003 --> 01:10:24,801
You're a real sprinter.

1071
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,670
Guys in masks, I'm out.

1072
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:32,470
I don't play.
I don't play.

1073
01:10:34,148 --> 01:10:36,616
Is there any actual,
like, real reason...

1074
01:10:36,684 --> 01:10:40,051
why anyone would shove something
up their ass like this?

1075
01:10:40,121 --> 01:10:41,053
No.

1076
01:10:41,122 --> 01:10:42,783
I'm claiming predictions
for this event.

1077
01:10:42,857 --> 01:10:43,789
Where's Ryan?

1078
01:10:43,858 --> 01:10:44,950
Are you going to make them?

1079
01:10:45,026 --> 01:10:46,789
Number one,
it's not getting in there.

1080
01:10:46,861 --> 01:10:49,489
Number two, even if it does,
it's not staying in there.

1081
01:10:49,563 --> 01:10:51,326
Definitely no
sitting down happening.

1082
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:52,889
Number three, there's no way

1083
01:10:52,967 --> 01:10:55,094
they're gonna believe
that this is true.

1084
01:10:55,169 --> 01:10:57,103
So, you're saying it's...

1085
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,230
I'm saying there's
nothing I want more

1086
01:10:59,307 --> 01:11:00,968
than for this to happen, but...

1087
01:11:01,042 --> 01:11:02,839
You don't want it
to happen that much.

1088
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:04,036
No, I really do.

1089
01:11:04,111 --> 01:11:06,409
This is our original talent
for this piece, by the way.

1090
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,412
Yep. I think that...

1091
01:11:07,481 --> 01:11:08,914
It's one of the
first things I think

1092
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:10,278
I've ever seen
you duck out on.

1093
01:11:10,351 --> 01:11:13,377
Oh, man, I am so glad
I turned this idea down.

1094
01:11:13,454 --> 01:11:14,716
I'm so glad.

1095
01:11:14,789 --> 01:11:17,280
Oh, yeah.

1096
01:11:17,358 --> 01:11:22,591
I'll probably use all of this
before the end of the segment.

1097
01:11:22,663 --> 01:11:25,257
Uh... what else we got?

1098
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:26,766
A condom.

1099
01:11:26,834 --> 01:11:28,597
Thank you.

1100
01:11:28,669 --> 01:11:31,934
And, um, a little toy car.

1101
01:11:32,006 --> 01:11:34,497
Blue, it's my favorite color.

1102
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:38,974
Let me see that. Dangle it.

1103
01:11:40,348 --> 01:11:43,442
Look at the reservoir tip.

1104
01:11:43,517 --> 01:11:45,451
Now I'm lubing up...

1105
01:11:45,519 --> 01:11:46,611
I can't see the car.

1106
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,621
...the little toy car,

1107
01:11:48,689 --> 01:11:50,987
because I'm going
to put it in my butt.

1108
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:56,797
Be comfortable.

1109
01:11:57,832 --> 01:11:59,925
Hey, Ed's here
for rescuing, dude.

1110
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,230
You're here for
making it a problem.

1111
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,793
All right,
you're gonna watch this?

1112
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:05,236
You're making me
uncomfortable.

1113
01:12:05,306 --> 01:12:06,238
Sorry.

1114
01:12:06,307 --> 01:12:07,899
I gotta get another job.

1115
01:12:07,975 --> 01:12:09,408
Lube up your corn hole.

1116
01:12:09,477 --> 01:12:11,172
I am. I'm spackling.

1117
01:12:11,245 --> 01:12:13,236
Spackling.

1118
01:12:13,314 --> 01:12:15,077
Heart rate's going up
for sure!

1119
01:12:15,149 --> 01:12:16,241
Oh, dude, it hurts.

1120
01:12:16,317 --> 01:12:18,080
Your adrenaline's flowing,
isn't it?

1121
01:12:18,152 --> 01:12:20,177
There's no getting around it,
it fucking hurts like hell.

1122
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:21,551
Come on in, Manny.

1123
01:12:21,622 --> 01:12:23,590
You're just in time, Manny.

1124
01:12:23,657 --> 01:12:26,956
Oh, Manny...
tell me I'm a man.

1125
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:31,491
Man, it feels so goddamn gross.

1126
01:12:33,567 --> 01:12:34,829
This is insane, man.

1127
01:12:34,902 --> 01:12:37,063
This is...
this is totally insane.

1128
01:12:37,138 --> 01:12:38,867
- It's in.
- It's in, dude.

1129
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:39,928
- It's in?
- Yeah.

1130
01:12:40,007 --> 01:12:41,599
- Let's see.
- Oh, fuck!

1131
01:12:41,675 --> 01:12:43,768
I feel like
I have to shit my ass.

1132
01:12:43,844 --> 01:12:45,971
Is there anything intact?

1133
01:12:50,117 --> 01:12:52,085
You said
that you didn't want to do it

1134
01:12:52,153 --> 01:12:53,950
because your dad
would disown you?

1135
01:12:54,021 --> 01:12:55,750
Well, I mean, it wasn't that.

1136
01:12:55,823 --> 01:12:58,291
You drank wine
off of a dude's ass crack.

1137
01:12:58,359 --> 01:12:59,951
My dad never saw that.

1138
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:02,551
I never told him that...
you know.

1139
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:05,190
I was gonna do this
and I was like, "Dad"...

1140
01:13:05,266 --> 01:13:07,894
I was, like, "Dad,
we're going hard these days

1141
01:13:08,035 --> 01:13:10,401
and there's some ideas
floating around."

1142
01:13:10,471 --> 01:13:12,666
I just mentioned
the car in the butt.

1143
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:15,106
My dad, like...
the only time in my life

1144
01:13:15,176 --> 01:13:16,905
I ever heard my dad, like...

1145
01:13:16,977 --> 01:13:19,343
You know, it's like
when your parents say,

1146
01:13:19,413 --> 01:13:22,439
"I'm not mad at you;
I'm just disappointed," you know

1147
01:13:22,516 --> 01:13:24,814
like, that hurts so much more,
you know?

1148
01:13:24,885 --> 01:13:27,581
Fucking rad.

1149
01:13:27,655 --> 01:13:29,088
Look at him walk.

1150
01:13:29,156 --> 01:13:31,522
John's gonna win, dude.

1151
01:13:31,592 --> 01:13:33,423
I'm not too excited
about this skit.

1152
01:13:33,494 --> 01:13:35,325
It's not my favorite
I've ever done,

1153
01:13:35,396 --> 01:13:37,261
because there's a toy car
in my butt

1154
01:13:37,331 --> 01:13:39,299
but this is the...

1155
01:13:44,638 --> 01:13:46,606
I think I need an X ray.

1156
01:13:46,674 --> 01:13:47,606
Antoine?

1157
01:13:47,675 --> 01:13:49,768
Yes?

1158
01:13:49,844 --> 01:13:50,936
How you doing?

1159
01:13:51,011 --> 01:13:52,603
Pretty good.

1160
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,942
I'm Ryan, and this is...

1161
01:13:54,014 --> 01:13:55,311
What can I do for you?

1162
01:13:55,382 --> 01:13:58,112
I was partying last night
with some frat guys.

1163
01:13:58,185 --> 01:13:59,117
I passed out.

1164
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:01,051
I must have fallen down
or broken something,

1165
01:14:01,121 --> 01:14:03,214
because I haven't been able
to walk right since.

1166
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:04,689
We're gonna take
X ray now, to be sure.

1167
01:14:04,758 --> 01:14:05,850
Okay.

1168
01:14:05,926 --> 01:14:08,121
- Take one of those.
- Oh, okay.

1169
01:14:11,298 --> 01:14:12,230
This is comfy.

1170
01:14:12,299 --> 01:14:15,393
Hold your breath.
Don't move.

1171
01:14:53,974 --> 01:14:55,498
What's that?

1172
01:14:55,576 --> 01:14:57,100
I have no idea.

1173
01:14:57,177 --> 01:14:58,872
That's not part of you.

1174
01:14:58,946 --> 01:15:00,675
That's something extra.

1175
01:15:00,748 --> 01:15:02,613
I would've known
if I ate that.

1176
01:15:02,683 --> 01:15:05,550
No. You wouldn't be able
to swallow that.

1177
01:15:05,619 --> 01:15:06,881
That is a car toy.

1178
01:15:06,954 --> 01:15:09,218
Well, how did a car toy
get there?

1179
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:10,882
Maybe you stuck it up your ass.

1180
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:13,017
I didn't stick anything
up my ass.

1181
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:15,357
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

1182
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:17,897
No, I never seen that in there.

1183
01:15:18,032 --> 01:15:20,330
I've seen a toy car all over

1184
01:15:20,401 --> 01:15:23,131
but never
in somebody's rectum.

1185
01:15:23,203 --> 01:15:24,795
You can't get it out?
You don't have...

1186
01:15:24,872 --> 01:15:27,136
No, I... I'm a physician,

1187
01:15:27,207 --> 01:15:30,074
but I practice this,
X ray only.

1188
01:15:30,144 --> 01:15:33,739
You think maybe I can just,
you know, poop it out?

1189
01:15:33,814 --> 01:15:35,907
You won't be able
to poop it out.

1190
01:15:35,983 --> 01:15:38,076
In fact, it will hurt you.

1191
01:15:38,152 --> 01:15:41,144
I fact, I don't think
it's even good for you

1192
01:15:41,221 --> 01:15:42,688
that you poop it out.

1193
01:15:42,756 --> 01:15:45,054
What will happen
if you take Ex-Lax?

1194
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,092
Will that help?

1195
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,718
No, if he takes Ex-lax,

1196
01:15:47,795 --> 01:15:50,787
well, he gets a lot of diarrhea
but no car.

1197
01:16:01,909 --> 01:16:02,841
I appreciate it.

1198
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:04,138
Thank you
for taking care of me.

1199
01:16:04,211 --> 01:16:05,178
Okay. Thanks again.

1200
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,559
Oh! He's alive.

1201
01:16:19,627 --> 01:16:22,596
Oh, Johnny Knoxville,
he made it!

1202
01:16:24,131 --> 01:16:25,723
Oh, there is a God.

1203
01:16:25,799 --> 01:16:27,232
Oh, please.

1204
01:16:27,301 --> 01:16:28,393
And at last!

1205
01:16:28,469 --> 01:16:30,562
I thought it would never...

1206
01:16:30,638 --> 01:16:32,902
This is the end!

1207
01:16:32,973 --> 01:16:35,737
Oh, thank you, Jesus!

1208
01:16:35,809 --> 01:16:37,242
Oh...

1209
01:16:37,311 --> 01:16:39,847
Oh, child!

1210
01:16:39,847 --> 01:16:40,336
Oh, child!

1211
01:16:40,414 --> 01:16:42,939
- Let's see it! Let's see it!
- Not that bad.

1212
01:16:51,091 --> 01:16:52,615
Moments like this
never last

1213
01:16:57,231 --> 01:17:00,200
When do creatures
rape your face

1214
01:17:00,267 --> 01:17:05,705
Hybrids opened up
the door...

1215
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,866
Ooh, baby, when you cry

1216
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,205
Your face is momentary

1217
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:17,046
You hide your looks
behind these scars

1218
01:17:17,117 --> 01:17:19,381
In hybrid moments

1219
01:17:19,453 --> 01:17:23,116
Give me a moment...

1220
01:17:25,225 --> 01:17:27,284
Oh, fuck!

1221
01:17:27,361 --> 01:17:29,295
...Give me a moment

1222
01:17:29,363 --> 01:17:31,763
- Oh, fuck!
- Give me a moment

1223
01:17:36,603 --> 01:17:39,197
Ooh, baby, when you cry

1224
01:17:39,273 --> 01:17:41,571
Your face is momentary

1225
01:17:41,642 --> 01:17:46,102
You hide your looks
behind these scars

1226
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:48,876
- In hybrid moments
- Bam? Whoa!

1227
01:17:48,949 --> 01:17:51,850
- In hybrid moments
- Ha!

1228
01:17:51,919 --> 01:17:53,910
Aah!

1229
01:17:54,054 --> 01:17:55,282
Go!

1230
01:17:55,355 --> 01:17:56,481
Ow!

1231
01:17:56,557 --> 01:18:02,655
In hybrid moments,
in hybrid moments...

1232
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,795
Give me a moment

1233
01:18:08,869 --> 01:18:14,136
Give me a moment...

1234
01:18:20,247 --> 01:18:21,805
Whose dick do I gotta suck

1235
01:18:21,882 --> 01:18:24,043
to get some explosions
around here?

1236
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:39,797
I can't expect you to see me
when I'm not around

1237
01:18:39,867 --> 01:18:45,533
And my voice is destroyed
by confinement of sound

1238
01:18:45,606 --> 01:18:50,669
I'm a human machine
laced with hidden disease

1239
01:18:50,744 --> 01:18:54,703
If the future looks bleak,
then you're connected to me

1240
01:18:54,782 --> 01:18:56,716
Flesh into gear

1241
01:18:56,784 --> 01:19:00,515
My self appears dissected
and pretentious

1242
01:19:00,587 --> 01:19:02,612
A simple sound,
a heavy sigh

1243
01:19:02,689 --> 01:19:05,419
Could win
the whole world over

1244
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:09,155
You live in fear of being
someone you didn't want to

1245
01:19:09,229 --> 01:19:10,856
He's got a boner.

1246
01:19:10,931 --> 01:19:14,992
I realize your insecurities
will get the best of you.

1247
01:19:15,068 --> 01:19:19,198
Oh! Oh, fuck!

1248
01:19:21,241 --> 01:19:23,801
It's a man.

1249
01:19:25,946 --> 01:19:28,540
Whoa!

1250
01:19:28,615 --> 01:19:31,413
Ow!

1251
01:19:33,187 --> 01:19:36,315
Whoa! Ow! Ow!

1252
01:19:39,459 --> 01:19:40,824
Gator wrestling.

1253
01:19:48,402 --> 01:19:49,994
For fuck's sake,
come here!

1254
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:52,903
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1255
01:19:52,973 --> 01:19:54,099
Hurry!

1256
01:20:02,049 --> 01:20:04,176
We wanted to see if
you would run here

1257
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:05,582
with a car up your ass.

1258
01:20:05,652 --> 01:20:07,620
Oh, I ain't
runnin' anywhere.

1259
01:20:10,657 --> 01:20:12,784
It's scary enough to walk.

1260
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:14,794
You're nice.

1261
01:20:14,862 --> 01:20:15,920
You're a good man.

1262
01:20:16,063 --> 01:20:17,928
Want to come over for dinner?

1263
01:20:17,998 --> 01:20:18,930
Oh, that's okay.

1264
01:20:18,999 --> 01:20:20,591
You know
how to operate it now?

1265
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:22,259
Yeah, I think so.
I think so.

1266
01:20:22,336 --> 01:20:25,203
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough...

1267
01:20:25,272 --> 01:20:27,934
- I need help.
- Yep.

1268
01:20:28,008 --> 01:20:32,945
...When you get knocked down,
you gotta get back up

1269
01:20:33,046 --> 01:20:34,946
I ain't the sharpest knife
in the drawer

1270
01:20:35,048 --> 01:20:38,415
But I know enough to know

1271
01:20:38,485 --> 01:20:43,855
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough...

1272
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:45,323
The smiley face is
a complete crucial.

1273
01:20:45,392 --> 01:20:47,087
...I lit my brain
with rotgut whiskey...

1274
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,422
What did I say?

1275
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:49,427
Fuck.

1276
01:20:49,496 --> 01:20:50,895
I didn't say the "F" word.

1277
01:20:50,964 --> 01:20:52,454
Yeah, you did.
You said, "Fuck."

1278
01:20:52,532 --> 01:20:54,159
- I did?
- Don't worry, we'll bleep it.

1279
01:20:54,234 --> 01:20:55,758
Can we cut that out?

1280
01:20:55,836 --> 01:20:58,327
...And I had dudes
with badges frisk me...

1281
01:21:00,173 --> 01:21:01,834
It looks fine.
It looks normal.

1282
01:21:01,909 --> 01:21:03,877
...To teach me
how to swallow pride

1283
01:21:06,413 --> 01:21:09,075
I took advice
no fool would take...

1284
01:21:09,149 --> 01:21:10,878
I think it says, "Fuck,"
on my forehead.

1285
01:21:10,951 --> 01:21:12,543
...I got some habits
I can't shake...

1286
01:21:12,619 --> 01:21:14,018
They don't have a tail?

1287
01:21:14,087 --> 01:21:16,180
No! They must have
taken them out.

1288
01:21:16,256 --> 01:21:19,419
...I ain't the sharpest knife
in the drawer

1289
01:21:19,493 --> 01:21:20,892
But I know enough to know

1290
01:21:20,961 --> 01:21:23,156
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough...

1291
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:25,460
Show him the X ray.

1292
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,937
...lf you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough

1293
01:21:32,005 --> 01:21:34,439
When you get knocked down,
you gotta get back up...

1294
01:21:34,508 --> 01:21:36,476
I mean, trust me, dude,
I'm not unimpressed.

1295
01:21:36,543 --> 01:21:42,607
...That's the way it is
in life and love

1296
01:21:42,683 --> 01:21:46,244
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough

1297
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:51,648
If you're gonna be dumb,
you gotta be tough.

1298
01:21:57,364 --> 01:21:59,628
Aw, fuck!

1299
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:02,294
The next time, we can do...

1300
01:22:02,369 --> 01:22:03,802
Son of Jackass.

1301
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:06,134
Son...

1302
01:23:58,351 --> 01:24:00,319
D-ohh!

1303
01:24:08,462 --> 01:24:11,090
Yeah, dude.
