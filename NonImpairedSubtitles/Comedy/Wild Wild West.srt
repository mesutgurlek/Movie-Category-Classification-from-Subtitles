1
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:37,246
He's a madman!

2
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:42,009
I must warn the President!

3
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,318
Giant spider!

4
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:01,727
And they say you scientists
are supposed to be smart.

5
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:23,571
The legendary Captain James West.

6
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:26,741
And I finally got him all to myself.

7
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:30,384
And surely you should feel free
to treat him just...

8
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:32,453
...bad.

9
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:45,795
Darling....

10
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:49,471
Hold onto that for me for one second.

11
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:57,438
General McGrath's boys.

12
00:03:57,647 --> 00:04:00,138
Waiting for y'all for a week,
you show up now.

13
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,852
You wouldn't be working up here tonight,
now would you?

14
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:08,484
Working? Would you be working
if you were up here with you?

15
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,424
I didn't think so.

16
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:14,154
Wagon's coming!

17
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:23,136
Come on, McGrath's waiting
on this stuff.

18
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,213
Pack it up good, Virgil.

19
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:37,045
Next stop, New Orleans.

20
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:54,233
I'm not working!

21
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:56,504
Problem solved.

22
00:04:56,706 --> 00:05:01,234
You can't just ram a man's personal
things into some hole like that.

23
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:03,071
Is that so?

24
00:05:03,547 --> 00:05:05,276
I didn't mean it like that.

25
00:05:05,782 --> 00:05:07,511
Damn, this crate's heavy.

26
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:13,517
Oh, Jim...!

27
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:17,892
Much as I'd like to take credit for
that, you might want to hand me my gun.

28
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:46,455
That was fun! Which one of you boys
wants to strip down and go next?

29
00:05:47,157 --> 00:05:48,556
Bet you do.

30
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:54,153
Sure could use some clothes here!

31
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:00,593
Well, well.

32
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:02,504
We got us a shy nig--

33
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:11,444
Pants!

34
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:48,847
There was blood on the saddle

35
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,781
And blood on the ground

36
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:53,716
And a great big puddle of blood
all around

37
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:09,069
I'm so sorry. That won't be possible.
I have...

38
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:10,569
...tonsillitis.

39
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:20,309
I'm still waiting on my guns
and ammunition.

40
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,813
I see my men have brought
your merchandise.

41
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:24,654
General McGrath...

42
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,287
...your weapons are being delivered
as we speak.

43
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,755
Now, shall we go upstairs
and check the merchandise?

44
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:33,721
Direct me to the poot, sir.

45
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:36,597
I want something young and creamy.

46
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,031
A gamer that takes to the crop
and the spur.

47
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:42,769
You drive a hard bargain.
All right, 50 cents.

48
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:46,238
I'm very flattered,
but I'm just not interested.

49
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:48,809
You gotta be interested.
You're a whore!

50
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,281
I may be a whore, but I work alone!

51
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:15,034
Now I'm working.

52
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:27,415
Ma'am.

53
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:34,622
Nitro!

54
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:39,590
This is not the way you transport nitro!

55
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,473
What's your name, missy?

56
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:29,074
Dora.

57
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,406
My mother's name was Dora.

58
00:09:31,648 --> 00:09:33,206
Oh, really?

59
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,245
What kind of lady are you?

60
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:39,982
She's mine!

61
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,393
I feel like a ditty.

62
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:46,456
Go on, girl! Sing!

63
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:49,497
Okay, it's a ditty.

64
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:51,761
"Sons of the South."

65
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:02,536
Tempo.

66
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,031
Back on up, now.

67
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:40,746
General "Bloodbath" McGrath.

68
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:44,783
Sons of the South, come to glory

69
00:10:45,054 --> 00:10:46,817
Sons of the South

70
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:48,580
Arise

71
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:14,514
There's a lot of ham
for these skinny legs, let me tell you!

72
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,817
That's a new one. Look!

73
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:27,390
Let me out! Please!

74
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:29,997
-This room's occupied.
-I'll say.

75
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:39,074
Don't let the ear frighten you, my dove.

76
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:41,004
I lost it at Chickamauga.

77
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:42,767
Really? One can hardly notice.

78
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:46,915
Would you help me undress? I always
have trouble undoing this clasp.

79
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:48,447
Thank you.

80
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:53,615
What's this?

81
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:56,189
Why, it's a deep, deep pool.

82
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:00,759
Maybe it's your old swimming hole,
general. Are you feeling sleepy?

83
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:02,295
Yes, I'm sleepy.

84
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:04,925
Good! Now you'll be my little doggy.

85
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:08,126
When I say "speak," you'll tell me
everything. Understood?

86
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:09,997
Very good.

87
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:14,267
Which scientist is in that sack
in the other room. Dr. Escobar? Speak.

88
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,141
You can speak words, you stupid mutt.

89
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:22,312
Who do you work for?
Who paid you to kidnap Escobar?

90
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:25,584
No, watch the swirling spiral.
Watch the--

91
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:26,777
Bad dog!

92
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,387
Bad dog! Watch--

93
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:29,558
Damn!

94
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,226
Stay! Stay!

95
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:32,689
Bad dog!

96
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:40,803
Didn't mean to startle you, ma'am.
Looked like you needed help.

97
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:43,336
Looks can be deceiving,
dark stranger. I'm fine.

98
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:44,972
I'm sure you are, ma'am.

99
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:48,268
Big, sturdy gal like you
probably gets top dollar too.

100
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,074
Here you go.

101
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:55,509
Run along. I'm gonna sing my old friend
McGrath a lullaby.

102
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:57,083
I need him!

103
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,689
You got your money. Run along!
Have some dignity.

104
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,387
West!

105
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:18,537
That'd be an awful career decision.

106
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:30,676
West! West! Go! Go get him!

107
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:45,998
Get Escobar out of here!

108
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:47,533
Stop or I'll squeeze.

109
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:53,469
U.S. Army! Stay out of my way, lady!

110
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:55,473
I'm not a lady! I'm a U.S. marshal!

111
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:57,572
Stay out of my way!

112
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,272
"Get out of my way, get out of my way.

113
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:03,380
U.S. Army.

114
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:04,883
U.S. marshal."

115
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:06,621
Oh, dear!

116
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:10,325
Federal agents inside, sir.

117
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:12,824
So Miss Lippenreider informs me.

118
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:20,732
Still, I believe good manners dictate...

119
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,803
...that we should send out
the welcome wagon.

120
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:34,249
Now what?

121
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:30,100
Whoa, there, partner!

122
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:32,603
The war may have got you
40 acres and a mule...

123
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:36,677
...but you can't just traipse into the
President's office. Give me that gun.

124
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:38,771
What, that one?

125
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:40,975
What about that one?

126
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:48,448
-That'll get you killed.
-Gentlemen!

127
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:51,957
Don't make Captain West any later
than he already is.

128
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,863
There've been a lot of death threats.

129
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:01,901
The Cabinet made me hire
these damned detectives.

130
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:03,796
Drink?

131
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:04,995
Cigar?

132
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,004
Don't mind if I do, sir.

133
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:10,176
So I understand you let
General McGrath get away.

134
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,640
That's not exactly the way it happened.

135
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:16,148
-Some half-a-sissy masquerading as--
-Artemus Gordon.

136
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:17,716
You know him?

137
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,253
Of course. He's the best marshal
I've got. A kind of genius.

138
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:26,053
Gordon has proven himself as a cunning
operator, with a rapacious intellect.

139
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:29,060
Nothing will stop him
from completing a mission...

140
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:32,757
...except maybe the impulsive actions
of a headstrong cowboy.

141
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:34,964
Who are you, mister?

142
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:37,264
What do you mean, who am l?

143
00:16:37,473 --> 00:16:39,600
I am the President of the United States.

144
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:41,106
Wrong answer.

145
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:46,146
Who are you?

146
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,542
I am the President of the--
I'm Artemus Gordon.

147
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,810
How did you know?

148
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:57,487
The President went to West Point.
That says Harvard.

149
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,318
Very observant.

150
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,764
Somebody mind telling me
what's going on here?

151
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,566
President Grant....

152
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,000
Sir, these are perilous times.

153
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:13,964
I was merely demonstrating how
someone, using the art of disguise...

154
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:18,306
...could penetrate into the very bowels
of the White House, sir.

155
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:21,950
You're clever, Gordon. One day
it's going to get you killed.

156
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:24,251
Like today.

157
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:30,383
And West, not every situation calls for
your approach of "shoot first...

158
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:32,390
...shoot later, shoot some more...

159
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:35,564
...then when everybody's dead,
try to ask a question or two."

160
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:37,755
Working together will help you.

161
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:40,161
-Working together?
-Sir, with all due respect--

162
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:43,270
You'll work the way your
commander in chief tells you to.

163
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,007
Well, I was coming to that, sir.

164
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,844
Gentlemen, America's top scientists...

165
00:17:58,054 --> 00:18:00,887
...in the fields of physics,
hydraulics, explosives...

166
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,686
...all kidnapped in the last year and
all by General McGrath, it now appears.

167
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:09,088
You two have been working
on the same case the whole time.

168
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:11,860
Why did it take so long
to figure it out?

169
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:16,060
One of us was trying to catch McGrath
and the other was trying to marry him.

170
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:17,671
We don't have time for this.

171
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,904
Only one week, if we believe this:

172
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:26,981
"General, the scientists you seek are in
my employ creating a weapons system...

173
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,850
...beyond the pale of
contemporary imagination.

174
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:32,612
I suggest you put your affairs in order.

175
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:36,417
You have one week before you will
surrender the U.S. government."

176
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:39,695
The letter was delivered today
with that cake.

177
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:44,729
-It's marzipan, isn't it?
-Careful.

178
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,765
It's McGrath, sir.

179
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:52,270
McGrath may be a vicious killer,
but a mastermind he is not.

180
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:55,711
So whom do we seek?
After consulting with lntelligence--

181
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:58,903
McGrath is on his way to New Orleans.
The longer we're here...

182
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:01,514
...the farther he runs.
I don't need lntelligence.

183
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:03,412
You'd rather rely on stupidity.

184
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:05,450
Gentlemen, I am leaving for Utah...

185
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:09,614
...where the transcontinental railroads
will be joined at Promontory Point.

186
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,988
You two are the best I've got.

187
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,219
Put aside your differences...

188
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:18,058
...and find this madman,
whoever he is, and stop him.

189
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:20,392
You have one week.

190
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:21,970
Dismissed.

191
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:31,036
Gentlemen.

192
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:33,372
The Wanderer is at your disposal.

193
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:35,776
Engine number five, track six.

194
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:38,953
Mr. Gordon, the item you requested.

195
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:40,780
Thank you.

196
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:46,992
Figures.

197
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:48,220
My new invention.

198
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:53,368
The Bi-Valve lnterior Combustion
Twice-Exhausted Bi-Axle Nitro-Cycle.

199
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,036
Save it. Got a train to catch.

200
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:01,534
Not if I catch it first.

201
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,125
Nice horse!

202
00:20:47,223 --> 00:20:48,315
Gordon!

203
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:56,357
Stop the train!

204
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:05,136
Hey! I'm warning you!

205
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:06,831
Gordon! Stop the train!

206
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:09,468
Come in. Have a seat.

207
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:11,543
Stop the train!

208
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:13,840
Stop smiling at me!

209
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:25,956
How nice of you to drop in.

210
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:27,923
All right....

211
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:33,534
Let's drop the beards, the bikes,
the fake boobies.

212
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:36,897
Let's set that needlepoint aside
and handle this like men.

213
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:40,371
As a matter of clarification,
this is not needlepoint.

214
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,677
This is needlepoint.

215
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:46,109
I'm putting the final touches
on my latest invention.

216
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:48,408
I call it The lmpermeable.

217
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:50,448
It's a vest.
When worn under clothing...

218
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:53,747
...it can stop any bullet,
fired even at close range.

219
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:56,389
-Is that so?
-But I haven't tested it fully yet.

220
00:21:57,993 --> 00:22:02,259
I find guns so primitive and unnecessary
if one's done one's proper planning.

221
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:06,935
I have always felt that allowing any
situation to degenerate into violence...

222
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:09,296
...constitutes a failure on my part.

223
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:10,494
Well, Mr. Gordon...

224
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:12,234
...you failed.

225
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:20,507
All right, Mr. West,
we'll settle this...

226
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,345
...like men.

227
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,964
I love this train.

228
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:50,438
Cheers!

229
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,005
While you're down there,
feel free to make use...

230
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:57,117
...of my Sub-Carriage lnter-Rail
Vehicular Egressor.

231
00:22:57,553 --> 00:22:59,350
I designed it myself!

232
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:05,760
I've been thinking.
Maybe the President's right.

233
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:09,761
We should put aside our differences
and work together.

234
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:14,032
Fight each other all you please.
Harm my train...

235
00:23:14,236 --> 00:23:15,669
...I'll douse you like dogs.

236
00:23:15,905 --> 00:23:17,839
That's my truffle reduction sauce.

237
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:21,743
Let's get on about our President's
business, shall we?

238
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:23,677
-Where to?
-New Orleans.

239
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:26,311
Why don't we let
Professor Morton decide?

240
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:29,780
I don't need some nobody professor
telling me where to head.

241
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:34,983
Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton,
kidnapped from M.I.T. six months ago.

242
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,820
Expert in the field of metallurgy.
Discovered in a field of alfalfa.

243
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:41,995
That's a man's head.

244
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:46,696
This magnetic collar was found about
six feet away, near his body.

245
00:23:46,936 --> 00:23:48,767
Still trying to figure that one out.

246
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:50,164
That's a man's head.

247
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:54,972
According to the Retinal Terminus
Theory, a dying person's last image...

248
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:58,510
...burns into his eyeball like a photo.
Perhaps there's a clue there.

249
00:23:58,747 --> 00:24:01,841
I give you Morton's last image.

250
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:05,578
That's a man's head.

251
00:24:13,762 --> 00:24:18,358
Refraction of the lenses causes the
image to appear upside down, so we....

252
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:28,300
That...

253
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:31,239
...is a man's...

254
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:35,474
...head.

255
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:40,610
McGrath.

256
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:43,417
Something in his pocket.
It's too fuzzy to see.

257
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,889
Mortification of the aqueous humor's
led to a loss--

258
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:47,255
Glasses.

259
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:57,868
"Friends of the South, come to
a costume ball, April 1 4, half past 8.

260
00:24:58,073 --> 00:24:59,734
346 Pine Court, Garden District."

261
00:25:00,676 --> 00:25:02,234
New Orleans.

262
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:19,257
Gypsy queen...pirate....

263
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:22,361
How about this?
You can come as my manservant.

264
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:24,999
Why, yes'um, Master Gordon!

265
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,364
I swears I'd be delighted!
I sing and I dance for you, sir!

266
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:33,564
I swears none of the other white
folks'll know I'd rather shoot myself...

267
00:25:33,776 --> 00:25:35,903
...than play your damn manservant.

268
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:38,102
You must wear something.
It's a costume party.

269
00:25:38,313 --> 00:25:40,076
This is all I need to wear.

270
00:25:40,282 --> 00:25:42,341
If you insist on a firearm,
I have something...

271
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:43,950
...you'll find intriguing.

272
00:25:44,153 --> 00:25:45,279
I designed it to go...

273
00:25:45,654 --> 00:25:47,019
...with this.

274
00:25:48,457 --> 00:25:50,391
Jim West does not wear costumes.

275
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:52,287
Very well. What's your plan?

276
00:25:52,494 --> 00:25:55,554
I was thinking I'd go
as a government agent...

277
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:57,959
...who's gonna kill
General Bloodbath McGrath.

278
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:02,263
An armed, Negro cowboy costume in a
room full of white former slave owners.

279
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:03,870
You'll win first prize.

280
00:26:04,073 --> 00:26:07,531
Listen, the art of disguise is
what we need to get into the party...

281
00:26:07,743 --> 00:26:09,768
...to find the kidnapped scientists...

282
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:13,539
...before they're forced to create
something that'll destroy the U.S.

283
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:16,547
You and I have been handpicked
by the President himself.

284
00:26:16,752 --> 00:26:19,312
Our freedom is at stake,
and this is our duty as men.

285
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:23,514
Now, you go as a riverboat captain,
and I'll be a saloon girl.

286
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:26,489
About your beloved art
of disguise....

287
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:30,587
That night at Fat-Can's, it wasn't
difficult to see you weren't a woman.

288
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:32,699
I was propositioned by three men.

289
00:26:32,935 --> 00:26:34,334
You looked nasty.

290
00:26:34,603 --> 00:26:36,230
Just butt-ugly.

291
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:39,134
I mean, your breasts were
hard and stiff...

292
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:42,469
...and stuck out like a couple of rusty
cannons on a sunken ship.

293
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:45,112
These breasts are a work of art.

294
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:47,747
Aesthetically and
scientifically perfect.

295
00:26:48,117 --> 00:26:49,448
They look like shit.

296
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:53,211
-Touch them.
-I'm not touching them!

297
00:26:53,455 --> 00:26:55,286
Afraid you're wrong?
Touch my breasts!

298
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:57,220
Just one. Touch one!

299
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:00,191
Happy? I'm touching them.

300
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:01,589
I knew it!

301
00:27:01,797 --> 00:27:03,264
Squeeze it gently.

302
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:06,968
Not that hard! Now you've shifted
all the buckwheat around.

303
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:08,860
Buckwheat? That's your problem.

304
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:11,237
What are you doing?

305
00:27:22,484 --> 00:27:23,712
Now touch my breast.

306
00:27:28,757 --> 00:27:30,816
That's what a breast should feel like.

307
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:32,220
Very nice.

308
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:35,997
-Now touch yourself.
-Oh, my God, I'm hard!

309
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:42,165
I was just gonna jot down a note.

310
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:47,202
You could put a gun on that thing.

311
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:49,377
Then where would I keep my pencil?

312
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:53,310
I think you underestimate
the convenience of a pocket.

313
00:28:22,477 --> 00:28:24,911
What are you doing here, boy?

314
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,245
I sorry, sir.

315
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,909
I was hoping....

316
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:31,451
I was hoping I wouldn't...

317
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,651
...have to break your nose.

318
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,804
White folks.

319
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:54,837
Get your hands off me!

320
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:59,310
Put me in the dungeon with those smelly,
bearded men. But I won't get on that!

321
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:01,812
-You applied for the position.
-A standing-up one!

322
00:29:02,317 --> 00:29:03,978
I'm an entertainer.

323
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:09,958
Stop complaining. You'll enjoy it.

324
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:25,970
An authentic cowboy outfit,
complete with six-guns.

325
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:29,676
What a terribly clever costume, Mr...?

326
00:29:29,878 --> 00:29:30,708
West.

327
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:33,609
Jim West.

328
00:29:35,284 --> 00:29:37,775
West meets East. Mae Lee East.

329
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:39,884
Ma'am.

330
00:29:40,956 --> 00:29:43,550
Are you here alone, Mr. West?

331
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:48,728
I'm looking to surprise an old friend,
General McGrath. Have you seen him?

332
00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:52,661
I don't think that name was
on our guest list. And I would know.

333
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:55,266
I am Dr. Loveless' personal assistant.

334
00:29:56,138 --> 00:29:57,730
Dr. Arliss Loveless?

335
00:29:57,973 --> 00:29:59,804
Funny how some folks think he's dead.

336
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:02,909
Tonight is his coming-out party.

337
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:10,312
See anybody that looks familiar?

338
00:30:11,586 --> 00:30:13,417
Matter of fact, I do.

339
00:30:13,655 --> 00:30:14,917
I am jealous.

340
00:30:15,157 --> 00:30:16,317
Don't be.

341
00:30:21,163 --> 00:30:23,996
Meet me later in the foyer.

342
00:30:29,338 --> 00:30:33,832
Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord

343
00:30:34,176 --> 00:30:38,704
He is trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored

344
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:41,074
He has loosed the fateful lightning

345
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,409
Of His terrible swift sword

346
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:48,349
His truth is marching on

347
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,542
Don't you just hate that song?

348
00:31:17,552 --> 00:31:19,645
Why, y'all look like
you've seen a ghost.

349
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:24,317
It's me, dear friends.

350
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,251
Alive and kicking.

351
00:31:28,296 --> 00:31:30,594
Well, alive, anyway.

352
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,990
We may have lost the war...

353
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:36,864
...but heaven knows we haven't lost
our sense of humor.

354
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,374
No, not even when we lost a lung...

355
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,200
...a spleen...

356
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:44,968
...a bladder...

357
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:46,179
...two legs...

358
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,316
...35 feet of small intestine...

359
00:31:50,585 --> 00:31:55,454
...and our ability to reproduce,
all in the name of the South!

360
00:31:55,657 --> 00:31:58,990
Do we ever lose our sense of humor?

361
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,658
Now, I owe a deep debt of gratitude...

362
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:07,960
...to our friends from across the sea
for their comfort...

363
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,001
...and kindness.

364
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,840
So mi casa es su casa !

365
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:20,147
Let the party begin!

366
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:24,543
Mr. West.

367
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,952
How nice of you to join us...

368
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,992
...and add color to these
monochromatic proceedings.

369
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:35,823
When one comes back
from the dead...

370
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:38,693
...I find that an occasion to stand up,
be counted.

371
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:44,263
Miss East informs me that you expected
to see General McGrath here.

372
00:32:44,473 --> 00:32:45,838
I knew him years ago...

373
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:49,607
...but I haven't seen him
in a coon's age.

374
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:53,104
It'd be difficult
for a man of your stature...

375
00:32:53,315 --> 00:32:55,579
...to keep in touch with
even half the people you know.

376
00:32:56,318 --> 00:33:00,982
Perhaps Miss East will keep you from
being a slave to your disappointment.

377
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:04,153
Beautiful women encourage you
one minute and...

378
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,259
...then cut the legs out
from under you.

379
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:08,691
Quite. Will you excuse me, Mr. West?

380
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:11,423
Thank you.

381
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:52,737
You're in for a big surprise
when you get this one in the saddle.

382
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:56,137
Stupid cowboy!

383
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:58,511
He mistake you for me.

384
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:13,393
Since the nitro and guns were destroyed,
lice and demoralization has set in--

385
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,756
General McGrath, if I may interrupt.

386
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:18,761
Your men will have
their weapons tonight...

387
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,869
...and they will be part of the greatest
military victory of this century.

388
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:25,937
So have your men...

389
00:34:26,308 --> 00:34:27,366
...here...

390
00:34:30,178 --> 00:34:31,543
...at 1 0:00 tonight.

391
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:35,683
You, sir, are a pip.

392
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,779
I'd follow you into
the jaws of Cerberus hisself.

393
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,948
And so you shall.

394
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:19,886
Please! Somebody help me!

395
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:49,853
I said to meet me in the foyer.

396
00:35:50,225 --> 00:35:51,419
Foyer?

397
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,192
Well, I've never been
much good with French.

398
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:05,399
So let's see, Mr. West.

399
00:36:06,274 --> 00:36:09,573
Are you a dangerous spy of some sort...

400
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:12,574
...or just a handsome cowboy...

401
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:13,914
...who likes to...

402
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:16,115
...poke around?

403
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:19,120
I believe I'm that second one.

404
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:24,057
East and West.

405
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:28,861
Never the twain shall meet.

406
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:01,851
First, I'd like to reiterate
that you make one ugly woman.

407
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:06,796
While you were out here,
I found out Dr. Loveless...

408
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:09,401
...is meeting McGrath and his troops
in an hour.

409
00:37:09,637 --> 00:37:11,662
You go right ahead, enjoy the party.

410
00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:13,534
I'm going to save the Republic.

411
00:37:13,742 --> 00:37:16,711
By the way, boobies look great tonight.
Nice and perky!

412
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:22,539
Hang him!

413
00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:36,627
We need to teach y'all a lesson
about how to behave in polite society.

414
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:40,665
Never drum on a white lady's boobies
at a big redneck dance. Got it.

415
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:43,266
Sure am glad we got that cleared up.

416
00:37:58,486 --> 00:37:59,976
My God!

417
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:02,849
Excuse me, am I intruding?

418
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:05,756
I feel I know you from somewhere.

419
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:07,321
Nice try, buster.

420
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:10,430
I look like something out
of James Fenimore Cooper...

421
00:38:10,632 --> 00:38:12,361
...but I mean you no harm.

422
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,329
My name is Artemus Gordon...

423
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:17,935
...and if I'm not mistaken,
you're in trouble. Allow me.

424
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:21,166
I'm Rita.

425
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:22,874
I was hired as an entertainer.

426
00:38:23,545 --> 00:38:25,945
Not that I'm complaining,
but why are you here?

427
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:30,713
I'm looking for some missing scientists,
not that I'm complaining.

428
00:38:35,957 --> 00:38:39,518
I'm a special U.S. marshal
on assignment from the President.

429
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:42,389
If you're so special, how come
you're looking up here...

430
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:44,656
...when Loveless has them
down in the dungeon?

431
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:46,731
The dungeon has been cleared out.

432
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:51,371
I checked it after sampling the gumbo,
which was heavy on the okra.

433
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,474
There you are.

434
00:38:54,843 --> 00:38:56,470
Thank you. Artemus, was it?

435
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:58,043
It was.

436
00:38:58,313 --> 00:39:00,247
I don't forget a face that easily.

437
00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:05,582
Like to have everybody's attention.

438
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:10,013
We've had a series of major
misunderstandings this evening...

439
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:13,319
...and I'd like to take a minute
to clear a few of them up.

440
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:16,926
First of which, the whole drumming
on the boobies thing.

441
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:20,327
In my native land--

442
00:39:20,535 --> 00:39:22,662
-Georgia?
-Africa.

443
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:26,833
--my ancestors used drums
to communicate between villages.

444
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:31,102
Y'all can see how, with this gal, we can
communicate all the way to Baton Rouge.

445
00:39:34,115 --> 00:39:36,811
On a clear night, we might even
get Galveston.

446
00:39:37,018 --> 00:39:40,112
All I was saying to the gal was,
"Nice dress, darling.

447
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:43,256
Good to see you. My name's Jim.
How's your mama?"

448
00:39:43,558 --> 00:39:45,719
Then there was the redneck comment.

449
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:48,919
And I'm getting the sense that
y'all took that negatively.

450
00:39:49,364 --> 00:39:50,956
But let's break down that word.

451
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,896
"Redneck."

452
00:39:53,134 --> 00:39:57,127
First word: Red.
Color of passion, fire, power.

453
00:39:57,372 --> 00:39:59,465
Second word: Neck.

454
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:03,034
Neck....

455
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:11,048
I can't think of anything for "neck,"
but without it y'all still got "red."

456
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:13,379
That's something
to be really proud of.

457
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:16,389
And between us,
the whole slavery thing...

458
00:40:16,591 --> 00:40:19,219
...I don't understand
what the big deal was anyway.

459
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:22,624
Who wouldn't want folks
running around doing chores?

460
00:40:22,864 --> 00:40:25,492
Are you going to get your big,
fat ass out of bed...

461
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,861
...and pick your own damn cotton?

462
00:40:28,336 --> 00:40:29,325
I don't think so.

463
00:40:29,537 --> 00:40:32,904
So let's head on inside,
knock us back some shine.

464
00:40:33,107 --> 00:40:35,075
IKick this shindig off
the right way!

465
00:40:35,276 --> 00:40:38,006
Come on! Put this thing away.

466
00:40:38,546 --> 00:40:40,605
Come on! Let's go inside!

467
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,111
All right, hold on. Hold on!

468
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:49,146
I stand before you as a man realizing
that I've done something wrong.

469
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:52,392
Darling, I'd like the opportunity
to make it right.

470
00:40:54,062 --> 00:40:55,552
Will you marry me?

471
00:40:55,897 --> 00:40:57,888
That means "no." Okay, darling, listen.

472
00:40:58,132 --> 00:41:00,259
Would it help if I said
I thought you were a man?

473
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,414
Something's funny about that damn rope!

474
00:41:18,086 --> 00:41:19,849
Thank you! We had a lovely time!

475
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:28,020
"Hang him! Hang him!"
I ought to shoot you right now.

476
00:41:28,262 --> 00:41:32,426
Allow me to introduce you to my
trigger-happy partner, James West...

477
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:35,568
...who doesn't realize that
my Expanding Rope invention...

478
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:40,104
...was a diversion allowing me
to find the missing scientists.

479
00:41:40,308 --> 00:41:41,798
Scientists?

480
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:46,707
This is Rita. I found her in a cage
in Loveless' bedroom.

481
00:41:46,948 --> 00:41:48,074
She's an entertainer.

482
00:41:48,282 --> 00:41:51,342
I'm afraid I haven't been quite honest
with you about that.

483
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:52,780
My name is Rita Escobar.

484
00:41:52,987 --> 00:41:57,014
I came to find Guillermo Escobar,
the scientist. My father.

485
00:41:57,225 --> 00:42:00,126
Sorry to interrupt, but I
gotta get to Malheureux Point.

486
00:42:00,528 --> 00:42:01,790
Malheureux Point?

487
00:42:05,466 --> 00:42:07,661
He's so impetuous.

488
00:42:09,037 --> 00:42:10,732
Yes, he's an idiot.

489
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,010
Well, general, it's been a long journey
from New Liberty.

490
00:42:20,214 --> 00:42:22,774
Not a day goes by that
I don't contemplate it, sir.

491
00:42:22,984 --> 00:42:23,916
So do l.

492
00:42:24,152 --> 00:42:28,748
If I'd had the scientific understanding
of gunpowder and primers I have today...

493
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,423
...I might've been standing here.

494
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:31,750
That's not what I meant.

495
00:42:31,993 --> 00:42:34,553
You meant the stomach-churning
carnage...

496
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:38,128
...that earned you
your unfortunate nom de guerre.

497
00:42:38,332 --> 00:42:41,392
What was that nickname again?

498
00:42:45,073 --> 00:42:47,166
Bloodbath McGrath.

499
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,410
The Butcher of New Liberty.

500
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,277
They ought to be here by now.

501
00:42:57,518 --> 00:42:59,418
Maybe we're in the wrong place.

502
00:43:00,354 --> 00:43:04,347
We're supposed to wait
exactly on this here spot.

503
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:05,589
There.

504
00:43:54,942 --> 00:43:57,809
You sawed-off sadistic bastard!
You betrayed us!

505
00:43:58,012 --> 00:44:02,472
Having donated half my being to
create a weapon capable of doing this...

506
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:05,049
...how did you and General Lee
repay my loyalty?

507
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:08,689
You surrendered at Appomattox!
So who betrayed whom?

508
00:44:08,923 --> 00:44:12,154
Munitia, make note the turret speed
must be accelerated.

509
00:44:12,426 --> 00:44:15,190
Change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8.

510
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,158
Scream...scream....

511
00:44:17,632 --> 00:44:18,963
"Help me."

512
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:20,464
"Do not pull my arm!"

513
00:44:20,668 --> 00:44:23,398
I demand you give the order to stop
this slaughter now!

514
00:44:23,604 --> 00:44:27,199
We'll need more loading drills. I hear
too much time between screams.

515
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:30,343
Give them the order to desist!

516
00:44:30,545 --> 00:44:34,982
I understand your distress, but
these men are not dying senselessly.

517
00:44:35,183 --> 00:44:38,550
It is for a far greater cause
than you can possibly imagine.

518
00:44:38,786 --> 00:44:41,050
You go straight to hell, sir!

519
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:42,779
After you, sir.

520
00:44:48,796 --> 00:44:50,263
Bloodbath McGrath...

521
00:44:50,464 --> 00:44:52,295
...indeed.

522
00:44:53,801 --> 00:44:55,462
That concludes the festivities.

523
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:58,195
Ladies, feed him to the crabs.

524
00:44:58,406 --> 00:45:02,900
Since the beginning of written history,
a nation's power has been determined...

525
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:06,477
...by the size of its army.
Tonight, that chapter will be closed.

526
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:11,516
The traditional army, to say nothing of
the United States, will become extinct.

527
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:14,016
Laid low by a cripple...

528
00:45:14,255 --> 00:45:16,689
...as the general
so amusingly implied...

529
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:19,319
...and "mechanology."

530
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:22,760
But that tank is just a
little hors d'oeuvre...

531
00:45:22,997 --> 00:45:26,364
...compared to what the country's
greatest scientists are cooking up.

532
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:28,728
So, if I have piqued your interest...

533
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:31,063
...bring 1 000 kilograms of gold...

534
00:45:31,272 --> 00:45:34,673
...to Spider Canyon
within the next four days.

535
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:38,709
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a tank to catch.

536
00:47:22,216 --> 00:47:24,776
Judging from the position
of these bodies...

537
00:47:24,985 --> 00:47:28,944
...it laid down a 360-degree pattern
of cannon fire.

538
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,048
I think I'm gonna be sick.

539
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:32,452
My God.

540
00:47:33,194 --> 00:47:35,685
What kind of weapon did this?

541
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:39,229
It rolls on and on, making a screeching
sound like a wounded animal.

542
00:47:39,467 --> 00:47:41,833
It has a cabin on top with a cannon.

543
00:47:42,036 --> 00:47:44,129
It swivels around like an eagle's head.

544
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:45,305
You saw it?

545
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:49,565
Heard about it. I thought it was
crazy survivors' stories.

546
00:47:50,745 --> 00:47:52,110
Survivors?

547
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,347
Not here.

548
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:57,449
New Liberty, Illinois, a free slave town
just over the border.

549
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:02,649
A week before the war ended in '65,
I was with the 9th Cavalry.

550
00:48:02,857 --> 00:48:06,987
We discovered old folks, women
and children slaughtered.

551
00:48:07,328 --> 00:48:09,694
They used them for target practice.

552
00:48:28,048 --> 00:48:31,814
That's when I vowed to chase
this yellow devil to his grave.

553
00:48:35,456 --> 00:48:37,048
What's wrong, West?

554
00:48:37,491 --> 00:48:39,721
I thought you'd be glad
to see me like this.

555
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,121
Actually, I'm kind of disappointed.

556
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:45,298
I was hoping to kill the Butcher
of New Liberty myself.

557
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:50,028
Well, go on, shoot. Send me on to hell.

558
00:48:51,672 --> 00:48:55,005
But if you want the devil that's
responsible for New Liberty...

559
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:56,970
...it's Loveless.

560
00:48:58,212 --> 00:49:02,979
He manned the machine there. He killed
all them children, old folks...

561
00:49:03,851 --> 00:49:06,376
...just like he killed my boys here.

562
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:11,586
Where is he?

563
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,693
Where did he go?

564
00:49:20,067 --> 00:49:21,659
Where's he going?!

565
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:23,700
I know that.

566
00:49:25,973 --> 00:49:28,032
I'll tell you if you take me along.

567
00:49:28,242 --> 00:49:30,073
You'll tell me, or I'll leave you here.

568
00:49:32,246 --> 00:49:35,511
The girls at the mansion,
you know, they talk.

569
00:49:35,716 --> 00:49:39,379
"I wonder if my hair
will get frizzy in the desert."

570
00:49:39,587 --> 00:49:41,555
"Where is this Oo-tah anyway?"

571
00:49:44,492 --> 00:49:45,516
Utah.

572
00:49:48,662 --> 00:49:50,220
Let's go, Coleman. Utah.

573
00:49:50,564 --> 00:49:51,758
Aye, sir.

574
00:49:57,004 --> 00:50:00,872
Why couldn't we give her a ride
home to Texas? It's on the way.

575
00:50:01,075 --> 00:50:03,066
On our way to Utah,
where our President is.

576
00:50:03,277 --> 00:50:04,938
How do you feel about that coincidence?

577
00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:29,165
We wouldn't have known where
Loveless was going if not for her.

578
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,565
Seems a bit ungracious, if not perilous.

579
00:50:31,772 --> 00:50:36,141
She'd have been in our way. She and I
would've wound up in the saddle.

580
00:50:36,744 --> 00:50:40,202
That's funny, I got the feeling
she was more interested in me.

581
00:50:55,396 --> 00:50:57,591
I've tried to place myself
in Loveless' shoes.

582
00:50:58,132 --> 00:50:59,724
Good luck with that one.

583
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:02,926
What could a maniac with no
reproductive organs want with Rita?

584
00:51:03,604 --> 00:51:05,697
Which is not to say that
Rita doesn't possess...

585
00:51:05,906 --> 00:51:09,034
...a beauty worthy of a Shakespeare
sonnet or a Botticelli painting.

586
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,037
My God, the curvature of her buttocks...

587
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:15,374
...and the swell
of that magnificent bosom!

588
00:51:15,883 --> 00:51:17,646
So full, so sumptuous....

589
00:51:17,885 --> 00:51:22,185
So...what were all those foreign
ministers doing at Loveless' party?

590
00:51:22,389 --> 00:51:25,051
This is what really puzzles me.

591
00:51:25,259 --> 00:51:27,523
Did you have any idea
there were so many?

592
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:31,494
-How long has she been here?
-Somewhere around Botticelli's buttocks.

593
00:51:32,566 --> 00:51:34,033
I am profoundly sorry.

594
00:51:34,234 --> 00:51:37,965
I'll spare you the embarrassment.
Make a sandwich. You're getting off.

595
00:51:38,172 --> 00:51:41,073
I know why those foreign guys
were at Loveless' party.

596
00:51:43,077 --> 00:51:44,977
This is fantastic. How do you cook it?

597
00:51:45,212 --> 00:51:46,975
I mean, you can cut it with a fork.

598
00:51:47,181 --> 00:51:50,150
In a daubiere. It's a clay pot.
It's a French method.

599
00:51:50,351 --> 00:51:51,909
Foreign ministers.

600
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:54,915
They were mad about something,
you know, like...

601
00:51:55,122 --> 00:51:58,114
...there was some real bad deal
in Louisiana on purpose.

602
00:51:58,359 --> 00:51:59,519
The Louisiana Purchase.

603
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,953
And Queen somebody of France
got swindled.

604
00:52:02,196 --> 00:52:03,254
Queen lsabella of Spain.

605
00:52:03,464 --> 00:52:06,661
This is ridiculous.
Coleman, stop the train.

606
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:09,893
-Miss Escobar's getting off.
-Who the hell is Miss Escobar?

607
00:52:10,104 --> 00:52:14,040
A frightened, starving, half-naked young
woman who wants to find her father.

608
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:15,569
Half-naked?

609
00:52:15,776 --> 00:52:17,300
Coleman, stop the train!

610
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:20,844
We're not putting anybody off
here in the middle of nowhere!

611
00:52:21,048 --> 00:52:22,777
Especially if they're half-naked!

612
00:52:23,651 --> 00:52:27,143
Please, Jim. My father's
the only family I've got.

613
00:52:27,388 --> 00:52:31,449
Am I to sit at home and wait for news
that he's been killed, or do something?

614
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:32,884
What would you do?

615
00:52:33,127 --> 00:52:34,924
I don't have anything against you.

616
00:52:35,129 --> 00:52:39,361
What happens when we find Loveless
and you're still on this train?

617
00:52:41,035 --> 00:52:43,799
I know you'd never let him take me back.

618
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:46,132
I've seen you shoot.

619
00:52:47,307 --> 00:52:51,073
Let me assure you any attack by Loveless
would be an exercise in futility.

620
00:52:51,311 --> 00:52:53,779
I'll demonstrate how
some of my design suggestions...

621
00:52:53,981 --> 00:52:56,916
...have made the Wanderer
completely impervious to attack.

622
00:52:57,151 --> 00:53:01,144
Over here, three seemingly
innocent billiard balls, yes?

623
00:53:02,156 --> 00:53:07,059
Depress the number, it's a sleeping-gas
bomb effective in under three seconds.

624
00:53:07,261 --> 00:53:10,822
So put your mind at ease.
You are safe within these walls.

625
00:53:11,065 --> 00:53:13,397
I don't know about you,
but I'll sleep better...

626
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,068
...assuming Loveless barges in here
to play pool.

627
00:53:16,537 --> 00:53:20,564
And speaking of sleeping,
I'm really tired, Artie.

628
00:53:20,774 --> 00:53:22,571
Could I borrow something to wear?

629
00:53:22,776 --> 00:53:25,438
-I have just--
-I got something you can wear.

630
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:28,512
It ain't stylish, but it won't explode
when you put it on.

631
00:53:28,716 --> 00:53:30,343
That would be nice.

632
00:53:40,928 --> 00:53:43,260
Loveless has kidnapped
a few metallurgists, so...

633
00:53:43,497 --> 00:53:45,522
...whatever he's building
will have armor.

634
00:53:45,733 --> 00:53:47,496
He kidnapped a couple of chemists...

635
00:53:48,402 --> 00:53:49,801
...so it'll have explosives.

636
00:53:50,003 --> 00:53:53,962
According to you, Rita's father's the
world's foremost expert in hydraulics...

637
00:53:54,174 --> 00:53:56,574
...so the thing's gonna move.

638
00:53:56,777 --> 00:54:00,611
What could he build that'd make the
President surrender the government?

639
00:54:01,248 --> 00:54:02,613
A bedside heater.

640
00:54:03,817 --> 00:54:04,647
What?

641
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:08,682
Rita needs a bedside heater.
It gets quite chilly back there.

642
00:54:08,889 --> 00:54:11,483
That's what I was talking about.
The distraction.

643
00:54:12,526 --> 00:54:13,515
What?

644
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,225
Good night, and thank you for saving me.

645
00:54:20,801 --> 00:54:21,790
Good night, ma'am.

646
00:54:25,105 --> 00:54:26,003
That outfit--

647
00:54:26,206 --> 00:54:29,664
-Is most becoming.
-Lovely. I hope it's not too breezy.

648
00:54:29,877 --> 00:54:31,845
-Back there.
-But if there's anything....

649
00:54:32,045 --> 00:54:32,909
Anything at all....

650
00:54:33,113 --> 00:54:33,943
I'm right here.

651
00:54:34,281 --> 00:54:36,306
Aren't you boys nice?

652
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,245
Well, sweet dreams.

653
00:54:43,624 --> 00:54:45,319
I told you she'd be a distraction.

654
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,889
She's not a distraction.

655
00:54:48,095 --> 00:54:51,223
It's nice having her onboard.
She's a breath of fresh ass.

656
00:54:52,766 --> 00:54:53,790
Pardon me?

657
00:54:55,068 --> 00:54:56,399
You said "ass."

658
00:54:56,837 --> 00:55:00,773
No, I said, "It's nice having her
onboard, she's a breast of fresh air."

659
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,707
Let's just get some shut-ass.

660
00:55:30,504 --> 00:55:32,028
We have Loveless, gentlemen.

661
00:55:32,606 --> 00:55:35,097
Seven hundred yards and closing.

662
00:55:35,509 --> 00:55:37,067
Maintain this speed. I'm coming up.

663
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,770
-What's that?
-I took the liberty...

664
00:55:41,982 --> 00:55:44,007
...of installing that while you slept.

665
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:47,880
Don't take liberties with my things!

666
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:49,349
Very good.

667
00:55:49,556 --> 00:55:51,922
I've only made one or two
additions to your wardrobe.

668
00:56:12,279 --> 00:56:14,747
Am I missing something here?

669
00:56:57,858 --> 00:57:00,190
If we are pursuing Loveless...

670
00:57:00,394 --> 00:57:02,589
...why is he behind us?

671
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:07,330
That's why.

672
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,229
What's going on?

673
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:16,170
Nothing. It's fine. Get down.

674
00:57:19,579 --> 00:57:21,672
-Push that magic button.
-What are you doing?

675
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:23,516
Seeing if your Egressor works.

676
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:24,782
We need a plan.

677
00:57:25,052 --> 00:57:26,314
-Push the button!
-Very good.

678
00:57:31,692 --> 00:57:33,159
He's so courageous.

679
00:57:37,097 --> 00:57:39,258
Would you pull on
one of those pool cues?

680
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:41,262
-This one?
-Thank you.

681
00:57:44,571 --> 00:57:48,302
You know, courage is only as good
as the machinery that supports it.

682
00:57:55,382 --> 00:57:56,371
Good luck.

683
00:59:14,928 --> 00:59:17,658
I have them square in my sights, sire.

684
00:59:17,998 --> 00:59:21,161
As do l, Munitia. As do l!

685
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:26,697
Fire away!

686
00:59:41,221 --> 00:59:44,122
That's it! I won't let Loveless
take me away!

687
00:59:44,357 --> 00:59:47,383
-I'd rather be dead!
-That's not a good thing to wish for!

688
00:59:47,594 --> 00:59:50,062
Please, Artie! Don't leave me alone!

689
00:59:53,133 --> 00:59:55,260
Ladies, we need a new train.

690
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:57,899
-Give me the ball.
-I won't!

691
01:00:03,343 --> 01:00:04,275
It's Loveless!

692
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:06,139
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is!

693
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:23,896
An innocent billiard ball this way,
but depress the number...

694
01:00:24,097 --> 01:00:26,759
...and on impact it ruins our mission.

695
01:00:28,068 --> 01:00:30,366
-Don't move!
-Let go of my leg.

696
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:34,700
Loveless has fitted us with the same
metal device that we found on Morton.

697
01:00:34,975 --> 01:00:36,340
Good morning, gentlemen.

698
01:00:36,643 --> 01:00:38,167
I trust you slept well.

699
01:00:38,411 --> 01:00:41,812
-What have you done with Rita?
-Rita, is it? How familiar!

700
01:00:42,015 --> 01:00:44,984
Rita is sleeping off the aftereffects
in the stateroom.

701
01:00:45,185 --> 01:00:46,675
She is quite lovely, isn't she?

702
01:00:47,254 --> 01:00:51,281
Who knows? I might even
become familiar with her myself.

703
01:00:51,491 --> 01:00:54,517
-That'd be one more reason to kill you.
-Oh, yes, Mr. West.

704
01:00:54,728 --> 01:00:57,322
To a no doubt well-endowed
blackamoor like yourself...

705
01:00:57,531 --> 01:01:02,230
...it seems impossible that a freak like
me could enjoy the pleasure of a woman.

706
01:01:02,435 --> 01:01:05,302
But having witnessed my use
of mechanology thus far...

707
01:01:05,505 --> 01:01:08,497
...don't you think I'd devise
something for my lower body...

708
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:11,336
...that was hard-pumping
and indefatigably steely?

709
01:01:11,978 --> 01:01:15,072
And, speaking of hard-pumping,
Mr. Coleman...

710
01:01:15,282 --> 01:01:16,613
...full steam ahead.

711
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:29,291
What a marvelous train. You don't mind
my borrowing it, do you?

712
01:01:29,563 --> 01:01:31,861
Aside from a lack
of wheelchair access...

713
01:01:32,065 --> 01:01:34,090
...I find it a most comfortable way...

714
01:01:34,301 --> 01:01:37,532
...to pass the long miles to my
laboratory in Spider Canyon.

715
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:41,764
By the way, I'll be seeing President
Grant soon at Promontory Point.

716
01:01:41,975 --> 01:01:43,704
What shall I tell him for you?

717
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:46,843
I'm afraid it can't be
that you're alive...

718
01:01:47,047 --> 01:01:48,514
...and well!

719
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:52,414
Get out your toolkit.
Get this thing off my neck.

720
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:56,320
My tools are gone.

721
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:02,560
"Welcome to Loveless Experimental
Camp for Political Dissidents.

722
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:04,593
There are no guards, no barbed wires.

723
01:02:04,831 --> 01:02:07,356
Stay within the perimeter,
you'll stay alive."

724
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:09,259
I don't have time for this.

725
01:02:12,806 --> 01:02:14,797
See? Nothing.

726
01:02:26,419 --> 01:02:27,852
And now we have to run.

727
01:02:35,228 --> 01:02:38,026
The collars on our necks seem
to contain powerful magnets!

728
01:02:39,065 --> 01:02:41,431
As long as we can outrun the blade,
we'll be fine!

729
01:02:41,635 --> 01:02:44,195
How long does it take a magnet
to lose its power?

730
01:02:44,437 --> 01:02:46,564
-About 400 years!
-Damn!

731
01:02:59,286 --> 01:03:01,117
The gully! The gully!

732
01:03:01,521 --> 01:03:02,954
Run for the gully!

733
01:03:06,926 --> 01:03:08,086
Go, Gordon! Go!

734
01:03:20,006 --> 01:03:21,701
Leap into my arms!

735
01:03:22,008 --> 01:03:23,236
Now!

736
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,592
Bless you.

737
01:03:49,502 --> 01:03:50,764
Sorry.

738
01:03:52,172 --> 01:03:53,764
Rita, my dear.

739
01:03:54,007 --> 01:03:58,944
Not that I'm ungrateful to Providence
for bringing you back, but I confess...

740
01:04:01,848 --> 01:04:05,340
...I'm a bit curious as to how
you managed to wind up with them.

741
01:04:05,552 --> 01:04:10,080
They seemed so sure they could find you,
I thought if I stayed with them...

742
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:13,191
...they'll bring me back
to all my friends.

743
01:04:14,994 --> 01:04:19,055
Not to give you a big head,
but I kind of missed you.

744
01:04:19,299 --> 01:04:22,860
Well, isn't that a coincidence?
Because I kind of miss me too.

745
01:04:33,546 --> 01:04:36,140
What's your plan for getting
this thing off my neck?

746
01:04:37,484 --> 01:04:38,473
Excuse me?

747
01:04:38,985 --> 01:04:43,046
That's what you're here for. You're
the master of this mechanical stuff.

748
01:04:43,823 --> 01:04:44,881
Oh, I see.

749
01:04:45,091 --> 01:04:49,050
Now I'm the master
of this mechanical stuff.

750
01:04:49,396 --> 01:04:51,557
As opposed to five minutes ago,
when I was trying...

751
01:04:51,765 --> 01:04:54,427
...to find an intelligent solution
to this very problem.

752
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:57,158
Then something happened.
Someone, who'll remain nameless...

753
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:58,860
Jim!

754
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:01,437
West!

755
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:05,305
...decided to jump over the wire...

756
01:05:05,512 --> 01:05:08,208
...providing us with that romp
through the cornfield...

757
01:05:08,415 --> 01:05:11,578
...and that death-defying leap
into the abysmal muck!

758
01:05:11,785 --> 01:05:15,084
And here we stand,
while that demented maniac...

759
01:05:15,288 --> 01:05:19,190
...hurtles toward our President
on our only mode of transportation...

760
01:05:19,392 --> 01:05:22,623
...armed with God knows what
machinery of mass destruction...

761
01:05:22,862 --> 01:05:26,457
...with the intention
of taking over the country!

762
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:29,133
-I think you need to calm down.
-I can't be calm!

763
01:05:30,236 --> 01:05:33,899
I'm the master of the mechanical stuff!

764
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,640
And I have to help you! You!

765
01:05:36,876 --> 01:05:39,868
The master of the stupid stuff!

766
01:05:40,213 --> 01:05:42,010
Wanna get your collar off?
I'll get it off!

767
01:05:42,215 --> 01:05:44,581
I don't have a gun.
Otherwise, I'd shoot it off!

768
01:05:44,984 --> 01:05:46,975
Here's something in the true
Jim West style!

769
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,482
I'll bash it with a rock!

770
01:05:48,721 --> 01:05:50,245
You don't wanna do that.

771
01:05:50,757 --> 01:05:52,224
But I do!

772
01:05:58,164 --> 01:06:00,029
-What did you do?
-I didn't do shit!

773
01:06:00,233 --> 01:06:02,394
You've reversed the polarity
of your magnet.

774
01:06:02,902 --> 01:06:04,893
I did not do shit!

775
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:08,136
Be still! Be still!

776
01:06:08,408 --> 01:06:10,740
I'll put my foot in your chest.
Push off.

777
01:06:15,915 --> 01:06:16,882
You all right?

778
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:19,779
I'm just peachy. Can you
help me get my boot off?

779
01:06:25,024 --> 01:06:25,922
Sorry!

780
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,764
And that would be my belt buckle.

781
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:40,133
When you tell this story
to your grandkids, leave this part out.

782
01:06:40,507 --> 01:06:41,599
Don't worry.

783
01:06:43,443 --> 01:06:47,277
I'll undo your belt. I'll run that way,
you run the other way.

784
01:06:47,547 --> 01:06:52,484
Let me understand your plan. You'll
run fast that way and I'll run that way.

785
01:06:52,952 --> 01:06:55,284
-It's ingenious.
-Whatever, Gordon.

786
01:06:55,822 --> 01:06:59,223
One, two, three!

787
01:07:18,311 --> 01:07:19,335
Oh, look.

788
01:07:19,979 --> 01:07:21,139
My auxiliary toolkit.

789
01:07:21,347 --> 01:07:24,009
I forgot about it. It must've
slipped out of my pocket.

790
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:25,408
Your pocket?

791
01:07:25,652 --> 01:07:29,281
Why wasn't it on some contraption
that shoots out your ass?

792
01:07:29,656 --> 01:07:32,022
That's the first place
Loveless would've looked.

793
01:07:50,877 --> 01:07:52,003
What?

794
01:07:53,546 --> 01:07:54,877
Nothing.

795
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:00,144
No, thank you. I'm fine.

796
01:08:00,587 --> 01:08:02,248
Not quite myself out here.

797
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,691
There's a very large spider
on your hand.

798
01:08:09,796 --> 01:08:11,696
He's just trying to get warm.

799
01:08:17,203 --> 01:08:19,364
How is it you know so much
about the desert?

800
01:08:20,406 --> 01:08:23,933
I lived out here as a boy.
I was raised by the lndians.

801
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:26,405
Really? Now, that is--

802
01:08:26,613 --> 01:08:27,637
Look, a desert wasp...

803
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,973
...one of the world's greatest hunters.

804
01:08:30,216 --> 01:08:32,650
She'll kill the spider,
lay her eggs inside...

805
01:08:32,885 --> 01:08:35,149
...so her babies will have food
when they hatch.

806
01:08:35,388 --> 01:08:37,379
Now I'm really hungry.

807
01:08:37,724 --> 01:08:40,852
How did your parents,
who I assume were Negro...

808
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,994
...feel about you
being raised by lndians?

809
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:45,561
They didn't have much to say about it.

810
01:08:45,765 --> 01:08:47,926
I was sent to another plantation
when I was a boy.

811
01:08:48,134 --> 01:08:50,967
Ran away as soon as my legs
were strong enough to take me.

812
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:53,070
Did you ever see your family again?

813
01:08:56,342 --> 01:08:58,936
They were at the camp at New Liberty.

814
01:09:03,483 --> 01:09:05,314
I'll help you get him, Jim.

815
01:09:11,124 --> 01:09:13,649
You really have no idea
where we're going, do you?

816
01:09:14,127 --> 01:09:16,254
I know exactly where we're going.

817
01:09:16,629 --> 01:09:18,529
Going to Spider Canyon.

818
01:09:18,931 --> 01:09:22,458
We'd get there a lot faster if you
weren't dragging that thing around.

819
01:09:22,835 --> 01:09:26,271
A lot of scientific ingenuity and
hard work went into this.

820
01:09:26,472 --> 01:09:28,337
It'd be a shame to just discard it.

821
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:31,601
You never know when a high-powered
magnet might come in handy.

822
01:09:46,826 --> 01:09:48,623
When you're right, you're right.

823
01:09:52,031 --> 01:09:53,760
Loveless' private track.

824
01:10:00,106 --> 01:10:03,166
This is not a mirage.
If this isn't a mirage, then that--

825
01:10:03,376 --> 01:10:06,539
Is Spider Canyon.
What now, Mr. Plan Man?

826
01:10:09,382 --> 01:10:14,319
What do we have? lntelligence, a sense
of purpose, the element of surprise.

827
01:10:14,687 --> 01:10:16,484
What does Loveless have?

828
01:10:29,368 --> 01:10:31,097
He has his own city.

829
01:10:53,893 --> 01:10:56,453
He has an 80-foot tarantula.

830
01:10:57,263 --> 01:10:59,891
Yes, well, I was coming to that.

831
01:11:03,002 --> 01:11:06,199
Nice to see an invention
that actually works.

832
01:11:06,405 --> 01:11:08,805
Most impressive.

833
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,039
If a little ungainly.

834
01:11:19,819 --> 01:11:20,945
He's trapped.

835
01:11:21,721 --> 01:11:24,212
That thing will never get
past those rocks.

836
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:40,404
Gordon, let's go!

837
01:11:45,044 --> 01:11:46,978
Gordon, let's ride!

838
01:11:47,713 --> 01:11:49,180
You do know how to ride?

839
01:11:49,382 --> 01:11:51,612
-Yes, I know how to ride.
-A horse.

840
01:11:51,818 --> 01:11:53,718
Yes, when something primitive
is called for.

841
01:11:53,953 --> 01:11:56,751
How about now? A giant spider's
stomping toward our President.

842
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,948
I was just thinking of another spider.

843
01:11:59,759 --> 01:12:02,523
Remember when that little wasp
destroyed the tarantula?

844
01:12:02,795 --> 01:12:05,593
The wasp had an advantage.
It could fly.

845
01:12:06,732 --> 01:12:08,097
Exactly.

846
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:13,200
In 1 540, Leonardo da Vinci designed
a flying machine, but never finished it.

847
01:12:13,406 --> 01:12:16,466
With some extrapolation
and a bit of imagination, I've--

848
01:12:16,676 --> 01:12:20,874
We don't have time for any of your plans
or half-baked inventions.

849
01:12:22,748 --> 01:12:25,114
We gotta stick to what we each do best.

850
01:12:45,838 --> 01:12:49,604
"May God continue the unity
of our country...

851
01:12:49,942 --> 01:12:54,276
...as this railroad unites
the two great oceans of this world."

852
01:13:56,472 --> 01:13:57,803
Good Lord!

853
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:28,069
Well, now, isn't this a coincidence?

854
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:30,795
I'm out for a little morning ride...

855
01:14:31,006 --> 01:14:32,633
...and in the middle of nowhere...

856
01:14:32,841 --> 01:14:36,572
...I bump into General Ulysses
S. Grant himself.

857
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:39,748
We've never been properly introduced.
I'm Dr. Arliss Loveless...

858
01:14:39,948 --> 01:14:41,677
...formerly of the Confederate Army.

859
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:43,474
Yes, Dr. Loveless.

860
01:14:44,353 --> 01:14:46,913
It's a fine-looking spider
you have there.

861
01:14:47,122 --> 01:14:48,419
What can I do for you today?

862
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:52,217
I have a humble abode nearby.
I hope you'll accept my hospitality.

863
01:14:52,461 --> 01:14:54,122
I have a proposition to make.

864
01:14:54,329 --> 01:14:55,728
What proposition is that?

865
01:14:55,964 --> 01:15:00,128
The immediate and unconditional
surrender of the United States...

866
01:15:00,369 --> 01:15:01,996
...to the Loveless Alliance!

867
01:15:02,204 --> 01:15:05,105
I didn't realize we were at war.

868
01:15:05,307 --> 01:15:08,276
You have me at somewhat
of a disadvantage.

869
01:15:08,477 --> 01:15:11,207
I didn't bring my fly swatter.

870
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:23,221
How about now?

871
01:15:23,992 --> 01:15:28,122
In matters pertaining to war,
the person to talk to would be me.

872
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:29,695
And now just who are you?

873
01:15:29,898 --> 01:15:32,492
I am the President of the United States.

874
01:15:32,768 --> 01:15:37,467
This man is an actor hired to stand in
for me on public occasions.

875
01:15:37,673 --> 01:15:40,369
Not a good actor at that.
He's too fat and dull-witted.

876
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:44,208
You got a lot of brass, Gordon.
Where's West?

877
01:15:44,413 --> 01:15:45,675
You know him, sir.

878
01:15:49,685 --> 01:15:50,811
Take this man away!

879
01:15:51,186 --> 01:15:54,087
Captain! Lieutenant!

880
01:15:54,857 --> 01:15:55,687
Sergeant!

881
01:15:56,859 --> 01:15:57,848
Private!

882
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,692
You are dismissed, sir! Leave!

883
01:16:00,929 --> 01:16:02,191
We'll take them both!

884
01:16:08,036 --> 01:16:10,163
Was this part of your plan, Gordon?

885
01:16:10,372 --> 01:16:14,365
Well, I'm by your side, sir.
That's what counts.

886
01:16:23,085 --> 01:16:26,111
I got a telegram for a Dr. Loveless
from his mother, Irene.

887
01:16:26,321 --> 01:16:29,256
She said, "Come home.
Stop all this foolishness."

888
01:17:09,665 --> 01:17:10,791
Bonjour...

889
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,326
...buenas tardes, and good day!

890
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:17,431
Great, glorious day!

891
01:17:17,773 --> 01:17:22,710
A day of healing for the wrongs
that have been done to us all.

892
01:17:25,647 --> 01:17:27,444
How long have we waited?

893
01:17:28,617 --> 01:17:31,484
1776, wasn't it, old bean?

894
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:35,620
The most expensive cup of tea
in history.

895
01:17:37,192 --> 01:17:40,161
Manhattan, for a handful of beads.

896
01:17:40,362 --> 01:17:41,624
How.

897
01:17:42,798 --> 01:17:45,631
"Remember the Alamo," indeed.

898
01:18:29,411 --> 01:18:30,673
Thanks, Artie.

899
01:18:34,016 --> 01:18:38,385
Today, I'm proud to be able
to sit before y'all...

900
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:42,747
...and tell you that the wrongs
will be righted...

901
01:18:43,058 --> 01:18:45,686
...the past made present...

902
01:18:46,094 --> 01:18:49,154
...the united, divided!

903
01:19:01,076 --> 01:19:05,877
Great Britain gets back the 13
original colonies, minus Manhattan.

904
01:19:06,348 --> 01:19:09,681
Florida and the Fountain of Youth
go back to Spain.

905
01:19:10,085 --> 01:19:14,351
Texas, New Mexico,
California, Arizona...

906
01:19:14,556 --> 01:19:16,285
...revolve a Mxico.

907
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:19,453
And a little piece for me to retire on.

908
01:20:10,645 --> 01:20:15,275
My partner nations insist that
we make this as legal as possible.

909
01:20:16,151 --> 01:20:18,278
Personally, I like the symmetry of it.

910
01:20:18,487 --> 01:20:19,647
After all...

911
01:20:20,388 --> 01:20:25,325
...wasn't it you, President Grant, that
made us sign a surrender at Appomattox?

912
01:20:25,694 --> 01:20:27,389
Never will I sign that paper.

913
01:20:27,629 --> 01:20:30,996
Never will the United States
ever surrender!

914
01:20:39,341 --> 01:20:41,536
We're at loggerheads, then, aren't we?

915
01:20:42,344 --> 01:20:46,371
I suppose the threat of death to someone
with your valorous war record...

916
01:20:46,581 --> 01:20:48,048
...would mean nothing.

917
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:51,151
If you still refuse
to sign the surrender...

918
01:20:51,353 --> 01:20:53,344
...we'll start by shooting
your man, Gordon.

919
01:20:56,191 --> 01:20:59,160
Don't worry.
I'm wearing an lmpermeable.

920
01:21:09,337 --> 01:21:10,827
May I make one request?

921
01:21:13,341 --> 01:21:14,865
That she aim at my heart...

922
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:18,445
...my heart, which has loved
this country so much.

923
01:21:19,514 --> 01:21:20,538
Shoot him in the head.

924
01:21:22,017 --> 01:21:22,984
Damn!

925
01:21:24,419 --> 01:21:25,477
Ready!

926
01:21:25,854 --> 01:21:26,684
Aim!

927
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,303
A new girl!

928
01:21:48,276 --> 01:21:51,109
Well, what a nice surprise.

929
01:22:20,408 --> 01:22:23,741
Ebonia, why are you so cruel to me?

930
01:22:36,825 --> 01:22:38,452
This brassiere is killing me.

931
01:22:40,662 --> 01:22:42,027
Thank you.

932
01:22:46,268 --> 01:22:49,294
And this garter belt
is riding up my ass.

933
01:22:49,504 --> 01:22:53,065
-Be careful with that dress.
-To hell with your damn dress.

934
01:22:58,346 --> 01:23:00,974
We'll have you out of here
in a second, Mr. President.

935
01:23:05,453 --> 01:23:06,852
Bye-bye!

936
01:23:07,989 --> 01:23:10,856
-Is she with us?
-Captain West, sir.

937
01:23:11,059 --> 01:23:12,754
Oh, he's so graceful!

938
01:23:42,524 --> 01:23:43,354
IKill him!

939
01:23:43,758 --> 01:23:44,884
Him!

940
01:23:45,093 --> 01:23:46,287
Him! Him!

941
01:23:46,494 --> 01:23:47,358
The girl!

942
01:24:00,542 --> 01:24:02,407
Is that the eight ball? Get down.

943
01:24:06,081 --> 01:24:07,309
That wasn't sleeping gas.

944
01:24:07,515 --> 01:24:09,540
No, the eight ball's an incendiary bomb.

945
01:24:11,419 --> 01:24:12,249
The President!

946
01:24:14,989 --> 01:24:15,921
Let's go!

947
01:24:16,124 --> 01:24:18,615
Save the President! We'll be fine!

948
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:26,232
They're getting away. We gotta
do something! We gotta get horses!

949
01:24:26,468 --> 01:24:28,095
Right now we need a plan.

950
01:24:28,303 --> 01:24:30,203
That flying machine idea of yours....

951
01:24:30,405 --> 01:24:34,808
Were you acting like you knew what you
were talking about, or can you build it?

952
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,518
Bernoulli was considered
insane by his peers.

953
01:24:47,722 --> 01:24:50,714
His theory states that the air
over a bird's wing moves...

954
01:24:50,925 --> 01:24:53,189
...at a lower pressure
than that below the wing.

955
01:24:53,395 --> 01:24:56,694
That's called lift. And is
what we will now attempt.

956
01:24:56,898 --> 01:24:59,423
It's only a theory.
It's never been tested.

957
01:24:59,634 --> 01:25:02,694
Here's a little bon voyage
present for you guys.

958
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:06,135
Gunpowder, nitroglycerine
and .44 caliber primers.

959
01:25:06,574 --> 01:25:08,804
How the devil do you know
about explosives?

960
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:12,275
U.S. Marshal Coleman. President wanted
me to look after you.

961
01:25:12,514 --> 01:25:15,483
But I draw the line at defying gravity,
so good luck.

962
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:19,912
Hold on!

963
01:25:29,831 --> 01:25:32,061
Avanti! Avanti!

964
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:35,168
-Why isn't this avanti -ing?
-Not enough lift!

965
01:25:35,437 --> 01:25:36,836
We need more speed!

966
01:25:51,152 --> 01:25:53,017
-That's a cliff!
-Yes, I know!

967
01:25:53,388 --> 01:25:55,788
-That means the ground is gonna end!
-I know!

968
01:26:10,038 --> 01:26:11,903
It works! It works!

969
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:15,200
If you had to get one right,
I'm sure glad it was this one.

970
01:26:19,981 --> 01:26:22,848
What kind of fancy name you got
picked out for this thing?

971
01:26:23,051 --> 01:26:26,077
Wait, let me guess:
an Elevation Enhancer...

972
01:26:27,322 --> 01:26:29,950
...or a Gravity-Repeller Vehicle.

973
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:32,217
No, I was thinking of something simple.

974
01:26:32,494 --> 01:26:34,485
Air Gordon.

975
01:26:44,672 --> 01:26:47,106
Mr. President, I'll ask you once again:

976
01:26:47,308 --> 01:26:51,267
Sign the surrender, or
I will decimate this town!

977
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:53,344
You've had my answer.

978
01:26:54,215 --> 01:26:58,743
I understand, but I urge you to
reconsider in light of the following...!

979
01:28:26,107 --> 01:28:28,075
Hang on, Mr. President!

980
01:28:28,776 --> 01:28:30,403
Here, here.

981
01:28:34,349 --> 01:28:35,247
Let's go!

982
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:46,622
Gentlemen, I am truly impressed
by your effort and ingenuity.

983
01:28:46,861 --> 01:28:49,352
Why not swear an oath
of loyalty to me...

984
01:28:50,231 --> 01:28:52,256
...and forego your execution?

985
01:28:52,567 --> 01:28:55,764
I thought I'd stuff your half-ass
in one of these cannons...

986
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:58,268
...and fertilize the landscape with you.

987
01:29:02,377 --> 01:29:04,538
We may not have a woodshed on board...

988
01:29:04,746 --> 01:29:07,840
...but that boy is gonna
get a whupping anyway!

989
01:29:15,923 --> 01:29:18,483
You're the one that's supposed
to give me my whupping?

990
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:21,692
Hell, I got one of those.

991
01:29:26,067 --> 01:29:29,036
Gordon only gave me one.
Give me a second and I'll--

992
01:29:44,686 --> 01:29:45,675
Damn!

993
01:30:20,788 --> 01:30:22,756
That's it. No more Mr. IKnife Guy.

994
01:30:56,224 --> 01:30:58,158
I learned that from a Chinaman.

995
01:31:02,263 --> 01:31:04,060
I just made that up.

996
01:31:08,002 --> 01:31:09,333
Nice hat.

997
01:31:14,275 --> 01:31:15,264
No!

998
01:31:56,217 --> 01:31:57,445
Sorry.

999
01:32:10,598 --> 01:32:13,829
Miss Lippenreider,
take over the controls.

1000
01:32:40,127 --> 01:32:42,027
Somebody promised me a whupping.

1001
01:32:43,231 --> 01:32:44,289
Dark-haired fella.

1002
01:32:44,599 --> 01:32:46,533
Crazy beard. About your height.
Seen him?

1003
01:32:47,435 --> 01:32:52,338
You know, Loveless, you just can't beat
a good old-fashioned pair of legs.

1004
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:57,274
Well, you're obviously
not a poker player, Mr. West.

1005
01:33:14,896 --> 01:33:18,696
Four of a kind always beats a pair.

1006
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:23,327
Now, was there someone
particularly close to you...

1007
01:33:23,537 --> 01:33:26,563
...who perished in that military action?

1008
01:33:30,544 --> 01:33:31,943
Well, that struck a nerve.

1009
01:33:37,585 --> 01:33:40,986
I likes to beat my feet...

1010
01:33:41,389 --> 01:33:44,051
...on the Mississippi mud!

1011
01:33:46,093 --> 01:33:47,321
Stop it!

1012
01:33:48,496 --> 01:33:50,293
Stop him, please!

1013
01:33:51,265 --> 01:33:52,425
Drop it!

1014
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:57,963
Drive.
Stop, or I'll shoot.

1015
01:33:58,172 --> 01:34:00,402
You expect to kill me
with that little peashooter?

1016
01:34:00,608 --> 01:34:01,540
If I have to, yes.

1017
01:34:01,742 --> 01:34:04,006
Why is it that I am unafraid?

1018
01:34:04,211 --> 01:34:05,337
Shoot...

1019
01:34:05,579 --> 01:34:06,568
...him...

1020
01:34:06,781 --> 01:34:08,248
...Gordon!

1021
01:34:11,252 --> 01:34:13,015
Shoot him!

1022
01:34:17,425 --> 01:34:19,256
After all that, you missed?

1023
01:34:19,527 --> 01:34:20,926
Actually, I didn't.

1024
01:34:29,704 --> 01:34:31,137
Thank you.

1025
01:34:31,372 --> 01:34:33,465
Your chivalry's about to be tested.

1026
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:38,200
Wait!

1027
01:34:46,787 --> 01:34:50,518
Well, Dr. Loveless, I bet
you thought it was pretty funny...

1028
01:34:50,725 --> 01:34:53,922
...big metal foot on my face and all.

1029
01:34:54,128 --> 01:34:56,392
If you ask me, somebody around here...

1030
01:34:56,597 --> 01:34:59,896
...owes somebody else
around here an apology.

1031
01:35:06,941 --> 01:35:10,570
Quit dancing around and figure out
how to run this damn thing!

1032
01:35:10,845 --> 01:35:12,312
We got a real problem there!

1033
01:35:16,584 --> 01:35:18,415
Please, Mr. West!

1034
01:35:20,154 --> 01:35:22,088
Show some mercy!

1035
01:35:22,289 --> 01:35:24,450
Now don't you fret none,
Dr. Loveless.

1036
01:35:24,658 --> 01:35:27,422
We got a lovely half-a-jail cell
picked out for you.

1037
01:35:28,262 --> 01:35:30,992
Please, sir! You fine, dark warrior!

1038
01:35:31,265 --> 01:35:35,031
Finding the right
combination of levers--

1039
01:35:37,705 --> 01:35:38,569
Don't do that again.

1040
01:35:38,773 --> 01:35:41,867
I have always admired you, Mr. West.

1041
01:35:42,376 --> 01:35:44,071
I want you to understand that.

1042
01:35:51,786 --> 01:35:56,723
For four years I've chased the animal
responsible for the New Liberty massacre.

1043
01:35:57,124 --> 01:35:58,284
I hear that's you.

1044
01:35:58,492 --> 01:36:00,858
I am not an animal! I am a visionary!

1045
01:36:01,128 --> 01:36:02,117
I am a genius!

1046
01:36:02,463 --> 01:36:05,864
And now I am angry!
And after I kill you...

1047
01:36:06,567 --> 01:36:09,866
...I swear I'm gonna boil you down
for axle grease!

1048
01:36:32,259 --> 01:36:34,250
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!

1049
01:36:34,462 --> 01:36:37,090
How did we arrive
in this dark situation?

1050
01:36:37,698 --> 01:36:40,496
I have no idea.
I'm as stumped as you are.

1051
01:36:42,703 --> 01:36:44,796
I'm facing a very
difficult problem here.

1052
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:48,133
On the one hand, I have
an overwhelming love for myself...

1053
01:36:48,342 --> 01:36:52,005
...and on the other, the raw,
seething hatred that I have for you.

1054
01:36:52,213 --> 01:36:55,944
I could kill you very easily, Mr. West,
just by pulling on this lever.

1055
01:36:56,851 --> 01:36:59,615
But I would die along with you,
hence my conflict.

1056
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:03,616
Decisions...

1057
01:37:04,024 --> 01:37:05,150
...decisions.

1058
01:37:05,926 --> 01:37:08,087
Allow me to make that decision for you.

1059
01:37:08,295 --> 01:37:12,254
Mr. West, although you are
as black as the night on the outside...

1060
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,489
...inside...

1061
01:37:14,335 --> 01:37:17,793
...you are yellow!

1062
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:22,175
You just don't have it in you.

1063
01:37:23,043 --> 01:37:24,408
Do you...

1064
01:37:25,846 --> 01:37:26,778
...boy?

1065
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,769
Now that's a whupping.

1066
01:38:06,086 --> 01:38:09,351
Gentlemen, I'm creating a new agency...

1067
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:12,184
...whose purpose
is to protect the President.

1068
01:38:12,593 --> 01:38:14,083
Welcome to the Secret Service.

1069
01:38:14,295 --> 01:38:16,229
Agents number one and number two.

1070
01:38:16,564 --> 01:38:18,293
Thank you, Mr. President.

1071
01:38:18,499 --> 01:38:21,935
Do you mind if I ask which one is agent
number one and which is number two?

1072
01:38:22,269 --> 01:38:24,066
I don't think that matters. Do you?

1073
01:38:24,471 --> 01:38:25,563
Not if you don't, sir.

1074
01:38:25,773 --> 01:38:29,675
Anyway, you'll have plenty of time
to discuss it on your new assignment.

1075
01:38:30,144 --> 01:38:32,135
See you in Washington, gentlemen.

1076
01:38:39,353 --> 01:38:41,344
Mr. President, what about our train?

1077
01:38:41,689 --> 01:38:43,350
I'm taking it, of course.

1078
01:38:43,557 --> 01:38:46,321
Hell, you let Loveless blow up mine.

1079
01:38:51,865 --> 01:38:52,923
My heroes.

1080
01:38:53,133 --> 01:38:54,100
Look at you.

1081
01:38:55,369 --> 01:38:56,336
You're a vision.

1082
01:38:56,537 --> 01:38:58,664
That's a right fine dress you got on.

1083
01:38:58,872 --> 01:39:03,536
I wanted to thank you for all you've
done for me before I went back to Texas.

1084
01:39:03,944 --> 01:39:06,037
Texas? What do you mean?

1085
01:39:06,247 --> 01:39:07,805
Come to Washington with me.

1086
01:39:08,015 --> 01:39:10,916
Or better yet, come back
to Washington with me.

1087
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:14,918
I'm afraid I haven't been
completely honest with you.

1088
01:39:15,656 --> 01:39:19,456
Professor Escobar is not my father.
He's my husband.

1089
01:39:21,895 --> 01:39:23,385
You could've told us that.

1090
01:39:25,332 --> 01:39:27,994
Rita, dear, we really must be going.

1091
01:39:35,409 --> 01:39:37,843
At least you still have each other.

1092
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:58,192
Jim?

1093
01:39:59,033 --> 01:40:00,227
What now, Artie?

1094
01:40:00,534 --> 01:40:02,399
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

1095
01:40:03,337 --> 01:40:05,202
Actually, I do, Artie.
