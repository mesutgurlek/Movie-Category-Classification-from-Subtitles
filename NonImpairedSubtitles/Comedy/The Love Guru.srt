1
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,096
<i>When I was a child in India,</i>

2
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:43,005
<i>growing up in the tiny village</i>
<i>of Harenmahkeester,</i>

3
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,238
<i>I found a voice-over machine,</i>

4
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,410
<i>which I still use to this day.</i>

5
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,678
Oh, hi.

6
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,521
I decided to use
the Morgan Freeman setting.

7
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,491
I am His Holiness the Guru Pitka.

8
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,755
In my book, <i>If You're Happy</i>
<i>and You Know it, Think Again,</i>

9
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:08,795
I speak of intimacy, or "into-me-l-see."

10
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:13,168
Intimacy is like putting your wiener
on the table and having someone say,

11
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,764
"That looks like a penis, only smaller."

12
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,511
Only smaller.

13
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,617
Though I was raised here in India,
I was born in America,

14
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,710
which is where our journey begins.

15
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:33,282
It's the story of a hockey player
named Darren Roanoke,

16
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:38,295
my most resistant student,
who became my greatest teacher.

17
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,760
Or some such bullshit. I don't know.
Gotta go!

18
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,134
- Hi, I'm Trent Lueders!
- And I'm Jay Kell.

19
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,543
Tonight is all about champions.

20
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:55,636
But before we get going,

21
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,876
I'd like to start by thanking
my own personal champions.

22
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,146
The fans who supported me
with their cards and letters

23
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:05,782
during my recent addiction
to peyote buttons and Frangelico.

24
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:10,454
I've already apologized to my friends,
my family, and my god.

25
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,361
And now, I'd like to apologize
to Dame Judi Dench

26
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,934
for my vicious and brutal attack.

27
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:20,597
I'm sorry, Judi, you did not deserve that,
and I hope the staples come out soon.

28
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,402
Over to you, Trent.

29
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,670
Thanks, Jay!

30
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,940
Tonight, the Toronto Maple Leafs'
Darren Roanoke

31
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,675
<i>is the subject of our player profile.</i>

32
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,546
Hockey has its legends.

33
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,951
Now, the new one, Darren Roanoke.

34
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,587
Known as the Tiger Woods of hockey,

35
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,025
Roanoke brought the sport
to a whole new audience.

36
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,393
- Hey, yo, check this, son!
- Check this!

37
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,560
<i>A role model turned bad boy.</i>

38
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,661
<i>He was in a perfect marriage.</i>

39
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,898
<i>But before the playoffs,</i>

40
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,636
<i>he stunned the world</i>
<i>by separating from his wife, Prudence.</i>

41
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,213
From role model to dating models.

42
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,507
Roanoke found out his wife, Prudence,

43
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,449
<i>was dating the L.A. Kings' legendary</i>

44
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,853
<i>French-Canadian goalie,</i>
<i>Jacques "Le Coq" Grande.</i>

45
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,721
He earned his nickname, "Le Coq,"

46
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,694
for reasons that cannot be stated
on this program.

47
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,356
This interview is over.

48
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,296
Holy...

49
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,765
<i>That's when Roanoke fell apart.</i>

50
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:33,171
<i>Roanoke is hit hard.</i>
<i>Open net! He misses!</i>

51
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,940
Damn, damn, damn!

52
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,679
But the question on everyone's mind is,
can the Leafs win without Roanoke?

53
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,552
Well, can we win the Cup
without Roanoke?

54
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,215
Not a chance, boss.

55
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,659
As long as Jacques "Le Coq" Grande
is banging Darren's wife,

56
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,024
Darren's toast.

57
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,590
My father once told me the Yankees
hired a guru to turn their team around.

58
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,828
I have our guru.

59
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,769
If he can fix Darren, we win the Cup.

60
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,705
They call him the Love Guru.

61
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,931
<i>Tumble out of bed</i>
<i>and I stumble to the kitchen</i>

62
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,095
<i>Pour myself a cup of ambition</i>

63
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,968
<i>Yawning, stretching, try to come to life</i>

64
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,172
<i>Jump in the shower</i>
<i>and the blood starts pumping</i>

65
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,109
<i>Out on the streets</i>
<i>the traffic starts jumping</i>

66
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:18,343
<i>With folks like me on the job</i>
<i>from 9:00 to 5:00</i>

67
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,749

70

<i>and they never give you credit</i>

71

<i>if you let it</i>

72
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,945
<i>They let your dream</i>
<i>just to watch them shatter</i>

73
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,948
<i>You're just a step</i>

Rajneesh! Mariska Hargitay.

98

Your manager Richard Pants is here.

99
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,920
Dick Pants. Send him in.

Mariska Hargitay, Your Holiness.

101

Have you seen today's paper?

102
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,294
Oh, don't tell me,

103
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,531
it's another article about
Deepak Chopra being number one

104
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,334
and me being number two?

105
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,375
Not in as many words.

106
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,175
Quaking pudding! I can't take this!

107
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,340
Not again! What? Why, why?

108
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,817
<i>Babu,</i> to be the world's second
most popular

109
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,152
Neo-Eastern-Self-Help-Spiritualist

110
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,186
Thank you, Rajneesh.
You are my compass.

111
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,825
Give me a pound.

112
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,663
Lock it down.

113
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,293
Break the pickle.

114
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:26,894
Tickle, tickle.

115
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,130

Who's the gift basket from, Dick?

Brad and Angelina.

123
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,691
It says,
"Thank you for the gift of true intimacy,

124
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,096
"but we've decided
to work with Deepak instead."

125
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,830
What does Deepak Chopra have
that I don't have?

126
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,929
He's been on <i>Oprah.</i>

127
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,337
<i>Oprah!</i>

128
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:08,345
And Oprah loves a great story.
Now, take a look at this.

129
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,644
The Toronto Maple Leafs
will pay you $2 million,

130
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,447
if you can get Darren Roanoke
back with his wife

131
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,351
in time to win the Stanley Cup.

132
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,447
Two million dollars!

133
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,787
That's a lot of cheese.

134
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,453
But wait, it gets better!

135
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,087
I spoke to Oprah's producers,

136
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,427
and if you can restore
Darren Roanoke's marriage,

137
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,525
they guarantee
that you will be on her show!

138
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,161
Let me get this straight.

139
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:37,265
If I fix their marriage, I get on <i>Oprah,</i>

140
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:41,779
and if I get on <i>Oprah,</i>
I'm the next Deepak Chopra!

141
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,551
Deepak Chopra. Maurice Pitka.

142
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,920
Please enter the ashram
of the Guru Tugginmypudha.

143
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:07,471
Guru Tugginmypudha,
you are so good with nunchucks,

144
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,234
yet you are blind.

145
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,865
I am not blind.

146
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,568
I am just severely cross-eyed.

147
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,648
I know, it is weird.

148
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,014
Be seated.

149
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,261
Deepak, here you go.

150
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:43,099
Maurice, you're not of Indian blood.

151
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,734
Speak of your parents.

152
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,076
They are both dead.
They were missionaries.

153
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,672
And what did they do before then?

154
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,048
They were dog stylists.

155
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,485
So, let me get this straight.

156
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,719
They were into doggy style
before the missionary position?

157
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,566
That's hilarious.
My parents are dead. Thanks.

158
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,863
Deepak,

159
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,598
why do you want to join
the Tugginmypudha Ashram?

160
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,571
To seek my true self.

161
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,643
All right, kiss ass.

162
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,177
Maurice, why do you want to join?

163
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,375
I want to become a guru
so girls will like me.

164
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,452
Then I will like myself.

165
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:32,622
Deepak, you will enjoy love in all forms.

166
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,660
Maurice, you must
wear this chastity belt.

167
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,828
Chastity belt? That sucks!

168
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,367
Once you have learned

169
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,701
that self-love is more important
than being loved by others,

170
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,206
you may remove the belt.

171
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:54,575
Master, if I am not allowed
to be with a woman, may I still...

172
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,581
You will go cross-eyed!

173
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,984
Guaranteed.

174
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,898
- Mariska Hargitay. Yeah.
- Mariska Hargitay.

175
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,666
I am His Holiness, the Guru Pitka.

176
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,401
Welcome to my ashram,

177
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,501
the Ecumenical Intuitive Enlightenment
Initiative Organization,

178
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,911
or EIEIO.

179
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,041
- Guru Pitka had a farm.
- EIEIO.

180
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,781
- And on that farm, he did no harm.
- EIEIO.

181
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,288
Okay.

182
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:43,953
If I sit like this any longer,
I'm gonna pop my dink bag.

183
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,430
Listen up. I am a guru.

184
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,763
Let's look at the word "guru," okay?

185
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:54,465
My goal is to get you to say,
"Gee, you are you."

186
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,474
TM.

187
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,910
And the you of "guru" is intimacy.

188
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,073
Or "into-me-l-see."

189
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,548
I see.

190
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,119
Without intimacy, you feel nowhere.

191
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:14,989
Tonight I want you to go
from nowhere to "now here."

192
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,128
Yeah.

193
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,357
It's like in <i>The Electric Company,</i>
you know?

194
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,299
- Now...
- Here.

195
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,665
- Nowhere.
- Nowhere.

196
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:30,433
My laws of intimacy
are kind of like my Bible.

197
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,444
And let's look at the word "Bible,"
shall we?

198
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,539
The Bible is " basic instructions
before leaving earth."

199
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,639
TM.

200
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,919
Put that shit on a T-shirt.

201
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,614
Show the T-shirt.

202
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:51,694
Now, I myself
have a guru, Guru Tugginmypudha.

203
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:57,395
And my guru, Guru Tugginmypudha
had a guru, Guru Cheddafrumunda.

204
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:02,202
And Guru Cheddafrumunda
had a guru, Guru Hathasmalvena.

205
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,267
Guru Hathasmalvena had
two main periods of his Gita,

206
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,209
or words of wisdom.

207
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,841
The first period
came before he got syphilis.

208
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,178
Some pre-syphilitic
words of wisdom include,

209
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,723
"To know something is good.

210
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,096
"To do something is God."

211
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,795
Then, after he got syphilis,
he would say things like,

212
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,202
"Eatin' ain't cheatin'."

213
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,002
"Did it smell that bad when you ate it?"

214
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,504
"Liquor up front, poker in back."

215
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,842
But his point was this,

216
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:46,179
"If you can't love yourself,
you can't love another."

217
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,249
And that's the end of that one. Yeah.

218
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,684
Mariska Hargitay.

219
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,086
Some announcements.

220
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,718
On Friday, please join us

221
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,424
for our first annual Gamblers
Anonymous Monte Carlo Night.

222
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,400
Yeah. Just for funzies, you know.
Bring your singles. Yeah.

223
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,200
All right, good night, everyone! Yeah!

224
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,070
Thank you so much!

225
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,178
Great show, Guru Pitka.

226
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,054
Hey, any bears in the cave?

227
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,490
- Any bears?
- Oh, yeah.

228
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,892
Bear cub. Left cave.

229
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,156
- Right here?
- There. Right there.

230
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,253
Yeah. Right.

231
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,994
That little booger gave me a
nose-whistle during the whole show.

232
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,366
Now, I'm ready to receive.

233
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,248
Mariska Hargitay, Your Holiness.

234
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,817
Mariska Hargitay, Jessica Simpson.

235
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,122
Did you get into the VIP room okay?

236
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,757
I love you.

237
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,399
Mariska Hargitay, Your Holiness.

238
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,665
Mariska Hargitay, Val Kilmer.

239
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,444
Why do you hurt me?

240
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,251
I know why. I know why.

241
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,287
- Mariska Hargitay, Guru Pitka.
- Mariska Hargitay...

242
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,357
Mariska Hargitay.

243
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,262
I so enjoyed your sutra,

244
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,426
especially the part
about not being a victim.

245
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,502
Well, thank you.

246
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,901
Because you are such
a generous benefactor,

247
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,942
we are establishing the
"Mariska Hargitay Special Victims Unit."

248
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,879
The whole nine yards.

249
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,814
Thank you, Your Holiness.

250
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:04,048
You have gone
from nowhere to now here.

251
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,024
I'm beautiful and I have a secret.

252
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,120
Bang.

253
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:14,957
Yes.

254
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:20,232
Guru Pitka, this is Jane Bullard,
owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

255
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,034
<i>- Guru Pitka?</i>
- Hold on one second.

256
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,969
<i>Guru Pitka?</i>

257
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,598
No!

258
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,572
So, you are the owner
of the ice hockey team,

259
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,614
the Toronto Maple Leaves?

260
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,513
- Actually, it's Leafs.
- Who said that?

261
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,451
How did you get there?

262
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,454
This little guy
scared the crap out of me.

263
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,889
I think I'm gonna have to do
a panty check.

264
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,859
I might have some
monkey-mustard back there.

265
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,520
No, I am good.

266
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,621
Who is this prick?

267
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,462
Well, how do you do? Shrimp?

268
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,130
What'd you call me, Jagamo?

269
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,002
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your gnome... Name!

270
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,736
You are a midget.

271
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,671
I find that term condescending!

272
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,443
Condescending.
That's a big word for you.

273
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,115
The man's an ass!

274
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,314
Your Holiness, you're an expert on love.

275
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,447
Yes, I am.

276
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,526
Why do you think Darren Roanoke
threw away his marriage?

277
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,222
Well, in my book,
<i>I Know You Are, But What Am I?</i>

278
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,356
I explain that when love goes wrong...

279
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,058
- Nothing goes right.
...nothing goes right.

280
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,762
- Yes!
- I've read it. It's impressive.

281
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,305
Yeah, it's nothing short
of a masterpiece.

282
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,603
So, do you think you can come back
with us to Toronto in the team jet?

283
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,201
- It's a date.
- Is it, now?

284
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,009
Well, this kitten's got a whip. Meow!

285
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,583
This is great, Your Holiness!

286
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:21,057
I can see you now,
spreading your message of self-love

287
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,151
- on <i>Oprah.</i>
<i>- Oprah!</i>

288
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,560
He's finally here for the first time
on the <i>Oprah</i> show.

289
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,859
Welcome Guru Pitka.

290
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:35,739
Oprah! Come on, Oprah.

291
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,573
Hello. Thank you very much.

292
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,619
Mariska Hargitay.
Thank you for the gift of water.

293
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,155
All right, I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

294
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,919
I find your work really inspiring.

295
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,986
I actually went to one of your sutras
after my father passed away.

296
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,759
I'm sorry to hear about your father.

297
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,095
Have you read my book
on the grieving process?

298
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,502
It's called, <i>What's This?</i>
<i>A Dead One of These.</i>

299
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,006
- Yes.
- Oh, you have?

300
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:15,671
I especially like the chapter,
"It Might Just Be Sleeping."

301
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,544
My favorite.

302
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,083
- I've read all your books.
- Oh. Well.

303
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:24,019
To tell you the truth,
I kind of have a schoolgirl crush.

304
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,422
Oh, really?

305
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,393
What does your husband
think about this crush?

306
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,725
I'm not married.

307
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,765
- Boyfriend?
- Nope.

308
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,066
Girlfriend?

309
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,766
Well, I mean,
there was one time in college.

310
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,636
Really?

311
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,438
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

312
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,713
Well, it's hard to believe a girl like you
can't find a man.

313
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,342
What does that mean, "a girl like me"?

314
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,478
Well, come on, I don't have words for it.

315
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:01,548
You know, nice girl, intelligent,

316
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:07,428
bedroom eyes, pouty lips, great rack,
tight bell-shaped ass,

317
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,760
thicker than a Snicker...

318
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,336
Say.

319
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,768
My problem with men
is the Bullard Curse.

320
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,671
What's a Bullard Curse?

321
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:22,975
My father, Hank Bullard,
bought the Leafs in 1967.

322
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,715
And we haven't
won a Stanley Cup since.

323
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,813
So, all the men in the city
blame me and my family.

324
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,583
Well, as I write in my book
<i>Stop Hitting Yourself.</i>

325
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,591
<i>Stop Hitting Yourself.</i>

326
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,389
<i>Why Are You Still Hitting Yourself?</i>

327
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,489
I explain that,
people may say bad things about you,

328
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,865
but you must never
say bad things about yourself.

329
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,704
I see someone who's ready for change.

330
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,744
It would just be easier to change,

331
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,439
if I didn't have to deal with the city
that hates me.

332
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,381
Jane, the City of Toronto
doesn't hate you.

333
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,315
- Oh, yeah, they do.
- Oh, no, they don't.

334
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,047
- Oh, yeah, they do.
- Oh, no, they don't.

335
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,213
Trust me.

336
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,188
At the arena,
I had Maintenance paint lines

337
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,758
to show me
where the crowd can't see me.

338
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:18,467
<i>You know, so they don't boo me</i>
<i>and throw stuff at my head.</i>

339
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:25,442
I mean, I didn't even ask for this job!
I guess it's just my fate!

340
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,136
Fate is a joke.

341
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:31,739
And as I once read on a wall,
in a truck stop bathroom in Barstow,

342
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,115
"The joke is in your hands."

343
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,149
Oh, my God, I just got that!

344
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,459
Well, to be more accurate,
the joke was in Rajneesh's hands.

345
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:49,801
What?

346
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,515
Nice shooting!

347
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,082
I am His Holiness, the Guru Pitka.

348
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,814
Look, man,
just get back on your pillow, all right?

349
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,356
There ain't no connection
between my love life and my hockey.

350
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,085
I'm not here to work with you.

351
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:18,060
I just came by to say hello and goodbye.

352
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,562
- Goodbye?
- Yeah.

353
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,529
I spoke with your wife, Prudence.

354
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,727
She broke it off with Grande,
and now she wants you back!

355
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,772
- Seriously?
- Sure. You don't need me.

356
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,137
Go back to what you were doing.

357
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,142
Yes!

358
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,721
There is one other thing.

359
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,050
I lied.

360
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,590
Prudence is still with Jacques Grande,

361
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,717
and he still has
the biggest wiener in hockey.

362
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,166
- Is it true?
- Yes, he has a ginormous hog.

363
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,102
Do you still think there is no connection

364
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,571
between Prudence
and how crappy you are playing?

365
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:04,972
Tell me this.

366
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,010
- Do you want Prudence back?
- Of course I do.

367
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,013
Then I need you
to write Prudence an apology letter,

368
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,447
and I will go deliver it to her.

369
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,848
All bids for connection count.

370
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,585
- What if it doesn't work?
- I can always refund your misery.

371
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,162
I was ominous just then.

372
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,444
Grande's not going to like you
talking to Prudence.

373
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,782
I know, but I must deliver
this apology letter to her.

374
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:53,551
- Do you think Grande saw us?
- Of course not, Rajneesh.

375
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,286
We are completely hidden by this bush.

376
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:02,627
This may go badly.

377
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,928
Keep the elephant running.

378
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,403
Prudence?

379
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,305
My little cabbage?

380
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,250
While I do your calves,
I'd like to sing a song

381
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:32,160
by the greatest singer ever
from Quebec, Miss Celine Dion.

382
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,198
<i>You were my strength when I was weak</i>

383
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:41,261
<i>You were my voice</i>
<i>when I couldn't speak</i>

384
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,238
<i>You were my eyes when I...</i>

385
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:54,617
<i>You saw the best there was in me</i>

386
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,056
No!

387
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,920
<i>You were my eye...</i>

388
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,054
Do not peck my fucking eyes!
Don't peck my eyes!

389
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:09,031
<i>Lifted me up when I couldn't reach</i>

390
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:13,764
<i>You gave me faith 'cause you believed</i>

391
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:17,239
<i>I'm everything I am</i>

392
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,936
<i>Because you love me</i>

393
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,443
That was beautiful.

394
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:27,348
And now, I'd like to show my love
by making for you a Quebec pizza.

395
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,478
- What's that?
- Pop-Tart with the ketchup.

396
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,954
She's good.

397
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,160
Guru Pitka? What happened to you?

398
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,562
Nothing. Why do you ask?

399
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:51,465
We've not much time.
I have an apology letter from Darren.

400
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:57,777
Well, you know, I got attacked
by a rooster. So, you know.

401
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,349
Yeah.

402
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,443
So he writes one stupid note
and you expect me to take him back?

403
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,954
- Perhaps I can change him.
- Ding-dong.

404
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,924
Did someone order
the special Quebec pizza, eh?

405
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,119
You know, like in the porno.

406
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,431
- Who is this in my house?
- Whoa!

407
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:21,531
Looks like he's smuggling a schnauzer.

408
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,732
Yeah.

409
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,869
Let me show you out.

410
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,204
Down, boy.

411
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,805
Read the letter.

412
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,849
- Nice place, eh?
- Yeah.

413
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,715
And I got her cheap.

414
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,153
So, it's an honor to have you
here in my house, Guru Pitka.

415
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,384
I think you are an amazing guru, and...

416
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,790
Hey! Mister!

417
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,424
What did you do to my rooster?

418
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,493
I don't know what you're talking about.

419
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,931
Stay away from my girlfriend!

420
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,867
The Wolverine.

421
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,793
Don't look at me with that tone of voice,
or I punch you in the shirt!

422
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,385
Okay, gotta go.

423
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,790
Beat it. I gotta take a dump.

424
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,424
Bodhisattva!

425
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:33,708
Hello, superstar.
Welcome to my new Toronto ashram.

426
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,143
Uncle Jack.

427
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,804
Can I get a hand
getting off this elephant?

428
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:40,681
Darren, if your Uncle Jack
helped you off an elephant,

429
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,811
would you help your Uncle
Jack off an elephant?

430
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,754
That's funny to you?

431
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,921
I don't know where I get it.

432
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,294
So did you give Prudence
my apology letter or what?

433
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,095
- Yes, of course!
- Did it work?

434
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,295
Let me answer it this way.

435
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,604
- You're an idiot.
- Yes, I am!

436
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,453
Now, your entourage must stay behind.

437
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,350
No, no, no, no, no. They protect me.

438
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,982
Well, they didn't protect you
from that outfit, now, did they?

439
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,616
What?

440
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,285
What's wrong with shark skin?

441
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,330
More like gay-skin, how about.
What? Yeah.

442
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,627
Snaps.

443
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,197
- Right, let's talk about Jacques Grande!
- No! Leave that man out of this.

444
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,501
You feel inadequate,

445
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:43,104
because he has plenty of clarity,
organization, charm, and knowledge.

446
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,272
TM.

447
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,985
Yeah, he's got a lot of that, all right.

448
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,851
Therefore, he's able to say to Prudence,

449
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,687
"Be loving and open-hearted
with my emotions."

450
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,121
TM.

451
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,159
You better stop right there.

452
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:05,066
Blowme is a good way
to remember that. Blowme, yeah.

453
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,571
Blowme, yeah. Blowme.

454
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:09,833
Blowme.

455
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,907
- You should stop.
- Well, I'm sure you're sick of this.

456
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,775
I know Prudence
has had it up to here with Grande.

457
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,849
All right, you know what?

458
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,212
I can't move my body!

459
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,952
It is an Indian martial art
known as "how to hurt a guy."

460
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,960
I am poking your third eye.

461
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:34,259
And if I twist my thumb,
I can make you crap yourself!

462
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,094
So, what do you want me to do?

463
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,962
What I need is to get you
to follow my method, Drama.

464
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,339
We must distract you
from your emotional pain,

465
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,169
regress you back to your childhood.

466
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:48,575
We must adjust your negativity,
mature you, and put it all into action.

467
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:52,682
If you follow my method,
not only will you win Stanley's Cup,

468
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,014
but you'll also get Prudence back.

469
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,211
You think this'll work?

470
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,879
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

471
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:00,082
No, you might want to
pick up some Depends.

472
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,785
I may have twisted my thumb. Yeah.

473
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,452
Check for coins.

474
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:05,529
Think fast.

475
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,191
Drama!

476
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,962
Drama.

477
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:17,773
Students, now I am going to teach you
the "D" of drama. Distraction.

478
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,208
Maurice, if Plato,
Shakespeare and Einstein

479
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,611
were talking about the meaning of life,

480
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,778
and two elephants
started humping outside,

481
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,914
even they would rush to the window.

482
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,992
It is the ultimate distraction.

483
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:40,561
We shall now compete in a game of tag.

484
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,565
It is called Stink Mop.

485
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,063
Enter, Sanjay!

486
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,875
Enter, Maurice.

487
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,580
Commence Stink Mop.

488
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,184
Stink Mop! Stink Mop!

489
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,588
- Stink Mop.
- Go.

490
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,896
- Stink Mop.
- Stink Mop!

491
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,264
Maurice.

492
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,028
What are you not thinking about?

493
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,832
I am not thinking about my chastity belt.

494
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,840
- That is distraction.
- Yes!

495
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,433
I get it! I am distracted!

496
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,544
Good distraction frees us
from emotional pain.

497
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,916
Bad distraction gives you
a mouth full of whizz.

498
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:49,090
- Once again, I'm Trent Lueders.
- And I'm Jay Kell.

499
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,427
Go, Leafs, go! Go, Leafs, go!

500
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,469
<i>Tonight, game one</i>
<i>of the Stanley Cup Finals.</i>

501
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,734
<i>L.A. Kings, Toronto Maple Leafs.</i>
<i>It's gonna get ugly.</i>

502
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,401
Ugly. You want to hear ugly?

503
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,445
At Promises, I shivved a guy
with a sharpened toothbrush

504
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,015
because he bogarted
the rehab toilet hooch

505
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,914
that I'd made
from apples and pantyhose.

506
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,283
That was ugly.

507
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,185
Over to you, Trent.

508
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,689
Thanks, Jay.

509
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,187
All right, guys. Bring it in.

510
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,457
Let's rip off their heads
and shit down their necks!

511
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,861
Yeah!

512
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,024
- Go! Go!
- Here we go!

513
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,103
Now, the first lesson is distraction.

514
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,728
In order to learn distraction,

515
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,569
you're not allowed to fight anyone
in today's hockey match.

516
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,642
I'm a hockey player!

517
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,005
That's what hockey players do.
We fight!

518
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,408
It's a problem.

519
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:39,074
Even Jay-Z had 99 of them,
and the bitch was not one of them.

520
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,682
Now, do you want to win Stanley's Cup?

521
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,085
Yes, I wanna win the Stanley Cup!

522
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,522
Then you are not allowed
to fight anyone for any reason!

523
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,893
Don't fight!
Now, get out there, and don't kill them.

524
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,899
- What is that?
- Corn dog.

525
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,065
What is it?

526
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,369
Is it made from dog?

527
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,376
What a freaking idiot.

528
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,540
Is this a dog's thingy?
Am I being punk'd?

529
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:16,444
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the Leafs take the ice.</i>

530
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,062
Hello, Los Angeles Kings.

531
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,260
I am His Holiness, the Guru Pitka.

532
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,065
And I have a message
from Darren Roanoke.

533
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:38,666
He told me to tell you
that you're all his bitches,

534
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,373
and that you can suck his big greasy...

535
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,541
Mariska Hargitay.

536
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,849
- I'm gonna kill you, Roanoke!
- You're dead, Roanoke!

537
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:55,983
Damn, Roanoke!

538
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,053
<i>And we're getting ready to drop the</i>
<i>puck for game one of the Finals.</i>

539
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:04,533
- I know I'm excited, Jay. How are you?
- I am rigid.

540
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,744
<i>It's a yard sale!</i>

541
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,381
- What?
- Not to fight.

542
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,616
You are not to fight anyone.

543
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,332
I would not wanna be his nutsack.

544
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,668
<i>They're coming after Roanoke!</i>

545
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,308
Get up!

546
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,481
What the hell are you doing?

547
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,613
Superstar, look at your hands.

548
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,888
- They're not shaking!
- Yes.

549
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,392
<i>Roanoke with the puck. What a pass!</i>

550
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,425
Goal!

551
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:14,801
Roanoke may be fighting for his life,
but he's playing great!

552
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:25,814
<i>Rob Blake is lucky</i>
<i>the refs didn't see that.</i>

553
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,909
But the refs will see that
on our post-game highlight reel.

554
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,855
That is the Altoids " Curiously Strong
Elbow to the Face" of the game.

555
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,552
Oh, God. Am I still dreaming?

556
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,089
No. Why do you ask?

557
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,360
Why'd you tell me not to fight?

558
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:47,062
Because you are now distracted,
therefore playing better.

559
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,604
It's the only way.

560
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,037
Yeah, well,
I can't keep getting my ass kicked!

561
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,702
Fine! Fight anyone for any reason.

562
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,369
You just said don't fight...

563
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,676
- What, it's just arbitrary with you?
- Of course not!

564
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,081
But we will let the dice decide.

565
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,646
Yes, it is arbitrary!
Fight anyone for any reason!

566
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,696
Fight anyone.

567
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,002
It's a bench-clearing brawl!

568
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,604
Remember, kids, this is not
how you play hockey.

569
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,976
- It's just ugly.
- I like it.

570
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,152
That was a good one.

571
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,020
One game suspension, Roanoke!

572
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,493
Way to go, Roanoke! You jag-off!

573
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:51,461
- Him, too?
- Anyone for any reason.

574
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,208
I love my job!

575
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,747
- Two games!
- Now, it's a two-game suspension.

576
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,478
That would mean Roanoke
would be out for game two and three!

577
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,053
He could play in game four.

578
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,452
Of course, we don't know
if we're going to game five!

579
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,116
Two and three, out,
can't play in the game.

580
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,490
He could watch the game at home,
but he can't play!

581
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,029
He can pretend to play
while he's at home,

582
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:25,125
but he cannot play on the ice
in the game that we're watching,

583
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,672
which is after this game,
'cause we're in game one.

584
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,401
You have a firm grasp of the obvious.

585
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,936
How could he do that?

586
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,810
Are you all right?

587
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,414
I'd like to thank the Academy.
Wow, these things are heavy. Yeah.

588
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,423
- Put me down, A-hole!
- Okay.

589
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:55,388
<i>And the Kings take the first game</i>
<i>of the Stanley Cup Finals.</i>

590
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,128
Damn it!

591
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,827
Cherkov, relax!

592
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,566
- Now, everyone, let's just take a seat.
- Okay.

593
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:15,447
First of all, let's agree next time
we decide to have a group meeting,

594
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,544
we take it in my office.

595
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,455
Now, Guru Pitka here
obviously has a plan.

596
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,360
So, Guru, enlighten us.
What is your plan?

597
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,059
Frankly, this is completely unexpected,
and I'm scared shitless.

598
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,657
- No, no!
- Let me at him!

599
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,499
- Take it easy, Frodo.
- No! Get back! No!

600
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,736
No! No!

601
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,065
Hippie queer!

602
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,508
- Throw a hex on you.
- Okay, okay.

603
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:45,173
Isn't there any way
that you could skip a step or two?

604
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:48,217
No way!
With Drama, there is no shortcuts.

605
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,947
We must now
take him back to his childhood.

606
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,387
- His childhood?
- Yes.

607
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,482
His mother only lives an hour away,

608
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,720
but he won't allow her
to go to the games.

609
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,227
Interesting.

610
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,666
He won't allow his mother
to come to any of his games!

611
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,634
Come, Rajneesh, a breakthrough!

612
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,465
Little help, please!

613
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,207
Okay. All right.

614
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,802
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

615
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,938
- Where are you going?
- To see Darren.

616
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,881
Jane, I promise you,
everything will be fine.

617
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,249
Come by my ashram, then I will explain.

618
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,049
Coach Cherkov, I would invite you,

619
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,683
but I know you have your meeting
with the Lollipop Guild.

620
00:40:35,297 --> 00:40:37,663
Why won't you let your mother come to
any of your hockey games?

621
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:39,199
'Cause, man,
I don't play well around her, man.

622
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:40,495
She freaks me out.

623
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:43,070
Then tomorrow we will go to her!

624
00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:46,629
- Oh, hell no! Oh, hell no!
- Oh, hells yes!

625
00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:01,849
- Yeah.
- This ain't <i>Driving Miss Daisy,</i> man.

626
00:41:01,957 --> 00:41:03,891
I'll break your fingers.

627
00:41:14,202 --> 00:41:15,760
Okay. Yo, this my street right here.

628
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:17,429
- Tonawanda Street.
- Tonawanda Street?

629
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:18,733
I know this street.

630
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,535
- You do?
- Yes.

631
00:41:20,642 --> 00:41:23,941
- At what number did you live?
- Fifty-three.

632
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:26,570
Do you know a Dickie Withers at 85?

633
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:28,080
- No.
- Well, it does.

634
00:41:29,117 --> 00:41:32,553
A dickie does wither at 85.
I own you! Yeah!

635
00:41:32,654 --> 00:41:34,451
Yeah! You are laughing!

636
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:37,990
You see, you're filled with joy of a child!

637
00:41:38,093 --> 00:41:40,584
You are now ready to meet your ma.

638
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:47,167
I'm warning you, GP, my mom's tough.

639
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:49,669
Oh, please. How bad can she be?

640
00:41:50,138 --> 00:41:52,800
<i>Raise it up and make a joyful noise</i>

641
00:41:52,908 --> 00:41:55,604
<i>Oh, I shall not be moved</i>

642
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,305
<i>- No, no, no, no</i>
<i>- No, I shall not be moved</i>

643
00:41:59,414 --> 00:42:00,381
<i>No, no</i>

644
00:42:00,482 --> 00:42:04,043
<i>Lead me to your rock</i>

645
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:06,780
<i>Where I shall not be</i>

646
00:42:06,888 --> 00:42:12,087
<i>I shall not be moved</i>

647
00:42:12,894 --> 00:42:15,624
Remember, Darren,
you must stand up to her.

648
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,754
Got it.

649
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:19,197
- Baby boy.
- Oh, Mom.

650
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:23,103
Now, why won't you let your ma
come see you play?

651
00:42:23,205 --> 00:42:25,799
It's just that you're not always
the most supportive, Ma.

652
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:27,397
Supportive?

653
00:42:30,045 --> 00:42:31,945
Pressure makes diamonds.

654
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:34,106
Pressure also makes rubble.

655
00:42:36,117 --> 00:42:39,917
And after a good whipping,
cream rises to the top.

656
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:41,511
So does scum!

657
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:46,989
- You're the Guru Pitka.
- Yes, I am.

658
00:42:47,095 --> 00:42:49,461
You're like
the poor man's Deepak Chopra.

659
00:42:49,564 --> 00:42:50,758
Game over.

660
00:42:50,865 --> 00:42:54,596
- Oh, Mom, don't, don't.
- Do you have something to say to me?

661
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,838
Yes, you do. Yes, go ahead.

662
00:43:01,743 --> 00:43:02,767
Yes.

663
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:08,180
You change your hair color?
'Cause it looks nice.

664
00:43:08,283 --> 00:43:10,114
We'll talk in the car.

665
00:43:11,486 --> 00:43:13,511
Well, this was fun.

666
00:43:13,622 --> 00:43:17,080
And by fun, of course
I mean emotionally scarring.

667
00:43:17,192 --> 00:43:21,026
I know you are not trying to tell me
how to raise my child.

668
00:43:21,129 --> 00:43:22,460
Gotta go.

669
00:43:23,765 --> 00:43:26,461
- Superstar! Superstar, wait!
- Whoa!

670
00:43:26,568 --> 00:43:31,437
Look at you. You're jumpy.
You're like prison bitch jumpy.

671
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:32,801
I told you that
we shouldn't have come here.

672
00:43:32,907 --> 00:43:33,896
No, no, no, no, no.

673
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:36,034
We have to go back in there
and confront your mother.

674
00:43:36,144 --> 00:43:38,169
There has to be another way.

675
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,771
Well, I hear you rappin'
Sister McCrappin'.

676
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:43,680
Okay, there are two ways
to regress you.

677
00:43:43,785 --> 00:43:45,582
One involves your mother,
your shame core,

678
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:48,485
and a grueling process
of intense self-examination.

679
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,989
- What's the other way?
- Well...

680
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:52,750
What does this sound like?

681
00:44:11,379 --> 00:44:14,075
I am making diarrhea sounds
with my cup.

682
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:15,911
I'm regressing you.

683
00:44:17,752 --> 00:44:20,653
Someone's in here. Someone's in here!

684
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:26,488
Yes. You are laughing!

685
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:28,493
Why am I laughing, man?

686
00:44:29,164 --> 00:44:31,428
Look what you did to my jacket.

687
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:33,493
Ball-gazer!

688
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:35,534
Go ahead!

689
00:44:36,204 --> 00:44:39,230
You bastard.
You totally caught me in a ball-gaze.

690
00:44:39,341 --> 00:44:42,367
Congratulations,
you have been regressed.

691
00:44:42,477 --> 00:44:43,842
I own you!

692
00:44:43,945 --> 00:44:46,379
- Yes, you own me.
- That was easy.

693
00:44:46,481 --> 00:44:48,949
But with ownership
comes responsibility.

694
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,608
<i>It was at this point that I realized</i>

695
00:44:50,752 --> 00:44:54,119
<i>that my student</i>
<i>was finally shedding his defenses.</i>

696
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:55,314
What are you doing?

697
00:44:55,457 --> 00:44:57,584
<i>He said while eating a chicken wing.</i>

698
00:44:57,692 --> 00:45:00,490
I am talking into my voice-over machine.

699
00:45:00,595 --> 00:45:04,531
<i>So, the Leafs lose game two</i>
<i>by a whopping six-to-one score.</i>

700
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:07,726
<i>The Leafs look rattled without Roanoke.</i>

701
00:45:09,371 --> 00:45:12,966
- It's Darren Roanoke.
- You mean Roan-choke more like.

702
00:45:15,677 --> 00:45:17,440
That's great. Nice hat.

703
00:45:17,545 --> 00:45:19,376
- I had a hat like that once.
- Yeah?

704
00:45:19,481 --> 00:45:21,711
Then my mom got a job.

705
00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:27,621
Looks like I'm gonna have to shove
these love beads someplace special.

706
00:45:27,722 --> 00:45:28,711
You got a problem?

707
00:45:28,823 --> 00:45:31,792
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Let me handle this.

708
00:45:31,893 --> 00:45:36,421
There are two things about violence
they teach you when becoming a guru.

709
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:37,930
The first thing is,

710
00:45:38,032 --> 00:45:41,968
an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.

711
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,765
The second thing is,

712
00:45:43,872 --> 00:45:47,308
never ever watch the bottle.

713
00:46:02,624 --> 00:46:04,592
You son of a bitch!

714
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:07,456
It's a bar fight!

715
00:46:33,655 --> 00:46:35,748
Down, down!

716
00:46:35,857 --> 00:46:37,620
Watch out!

717
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:39,124
- Well done!
- Nice job!

718
00:46:57,779 --> 00:46:59,747
Hold on, hold on.

719
00:47:09,724 --> 00:47:11,692
Niagara Falls is amazing.

720
00:47:12,594 --> 00:47:13,754
Darren.

721
00:47:13,862 --> 00:47:15,955
Just because
your mother only loved you

722
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:17,827
when you achieved

723
00:47:17,932 --> 00:47:21,163
doesn't mean that Prudence will
only love you when you achieve.

724
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:22,896
I was afraid
that Prudence would leave me

725
00:47:23,004 --> 00:47:25,632
if I didn't win the Stanley Cup,

726
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,538
- so I left Prudence first.
- That's it!

727
00:47:28,643 --> 00:47:32,010
However, we must
confront your mother.

728
00:47:32,146 --> 00:47:34,307
Prudence always wanted me
to stand up to my ma.

729
00:47:34,415 --> 00:47:36,440
- I know.
- I miss Prudence.

730
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:39,843
I miss the connection.

731
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:41,819
- Connection.
- Yeah.

732
00:47:42,457 --> 00:47:46,120
<i>Making love.</i>
<i>Falling asleep in each other's arms.</i>

733
00:47:46,227 --> 00:47:48,320
<i>Sometimes we would wake up</i>
<i>a couple hours later,</i>

734
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:50,829
<i>and it'd be like we were</i>
<i>the only two people in the world.</i>

735
00:47:50,932 --> 00:47:54,390
<i>Prudence would stare into my eyes,</i>
<i>and she'd say...</i>

736
00:47:54,502 --> 00:47:56,766
- Damn.
<i>- Damn.</i>

737
00:47:56,971 --> 00:47:59,064
<i>It sort of became our song.</i>

738
00:47:59,774 --> 00:48:01,765
You are a very lucky man.

739
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:06,213
I would like to have
a"damn" moment like that someday.

740
00:48:06,314 --> 00:48:11,013
How can you be the Love Guru
if you've never been in a relationship?

741
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,451
Well, there is someone I like.

742
00:48:13,555 --> 00:48:15,216
But until I learn to love myself,

743
00:48:15,323 --> 00:48:17,655
I can only go out
with three girls named Ann.

744
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:19,989
- Three girls named Ann?
- Yeah.

745
00:48:20,094 --> 00:48:22,892
Ann Visible, Ann Flatable, and Ann Job.

746
00:48:23,998 --> 00:48:25,329
Ann Job!

747
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:29,970
Well, you know,
I deflect because of the pain.

748
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:33,500
I gotta get my girl back, GP.

749
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:35,337
Otherwise,
what am I gonna do with this?

750
00:48:36,044 --> 00:48:38,137
I have two tattoos.

751
00:48:38,246 --> 00:48:40,111
One tattoo is the Drama tattoo,

752
00:48:40,214 --> 00:48:42,182
which signifies
the self-determinist philosophy

753
00:48:42,283 --> 00:48:44,342
of the Tugginmypudha Ashram.

754
00:48:44,452 --> 00:48:45,544
And what's the other tattoo?

755
00:48:45,653 --> 00:48:48,850
Daffy Duck pushing a lawn mower
through my pubes.

756
00:48:49,924 --> 00:48:52,290
Look, he's dancing. Yeah. Right.

757
00:48:53,294 --> 00:48:56,161
Ball-gazer! Oh, my God! There you go!

758
00:48:56,264 --> 00:48:59,028
The ball-gazing student
has become the ball-gazing master.

759
00:49:13,681 --> 00:49:16,844
<i>- Saying I love you</i>
<i>- Saying I love you</i>

760
00:49:16,951 --> 00:49:23,083
<i>Is not the words</i>
<i>I want to hear from you</i>

761
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:28,629

762
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,564
<i>But if you only knew</i>

763
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:38,970

772
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:34,154
That was great!

773
00:50:34,262 --> 00:50:35,923
Thank you, Speedy. That's great.

774
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:39,431
Mariska Hargitay. That's great.

775
00:50:41,169 --> 00:50:43,535
That was lovely.
But we need to talk about Darren.

776
00:50:43,638 --> 00:50:47,540
- This is a disaster. He's my only...
- Jane! Do you trust me?

777
00:50:48,543 --> 00:50:50,170
I do trust you.

778
00:50:51,546 --> 00:50:52,706
I'm not really sure why.

779
00:50:52,814 --> 00:50:56,079
It's the beard.
It makes me look like Santa.

780
00:50:56,684 --> 00:51:00,279
And by the way, you look breathtaking.

781
00:51:01,122 --> 00:51:03,556
- Thank you.
- As do I.

782
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:07,954
Come.
My staff has prepared a lovely meal.

783
00:51:10,798 --> 00:51:12,595
- Wow.
- Right?

784
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,669
I am so hungry
I could eat a skunk's bottom.

785
00:51:16,571 --> 00:51:20,769
Which is a lot like calamari.
But that's not what we're having tonight.

786
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:22,843
Rajneesh will now prepare a dish

787
00:51:22,944 --> 00:51:25,845
made of two lychees
wrapped in a doughy pouch.

788
00:51:25,947 --> 00:51:30,213
- It's called Kartapal Birigalapatt.
- What's that mean?

789
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:32,115
Nuts in a sling.

790
00:51:32,954 --> 00:51:34,819
Oh, thanks, but I'll pass.

791
00:51:34,922 --> 00:51:37,686
Very well, I'll have your nuts in a sling.

792
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:40,655
Cough.

793
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:44,922
Reject this man.
Not fit for military service.

794
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:48,466
Would you like your nuts to be crushed?

795
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:51,561
Doesn't everyone? Who is this guy?

796
00:52:00,948 --> 00:52:02,313
Geronimo!

797
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:04,818
That is our safe word.

798
00:52:07,355 --> 00:52:11,621
Now, we get the nuts nice and hot,
so they tighten up and get firm.

799
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:19,898
That's good.

800
00:52:20,568 --> 00:52:23,594
Feels good.
I mean, tastes good. I mean, what?

801
00:52:25,807 --> 00:52:28,002
You want curlies on your nuts?

802
00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:31,374
Do I look like a child?
Of course I want curlies on my nuts.

803
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:33,674
Don't forget your pickle.

804
00:52:34,782 --> 00:52:38,274
- Would you like some soup instead?
- Yes.

805
00:52:38,386 --> 00:52:42,049
Rajneesh, I'd like an alligator soup,
and make it snappy.

806
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:48,294
Because alligators are snappy,
and at the same time, I want it prompt.

807
00:52:50,898 --> 00:52:54,561
Here it is. There's your soup.
Watch out! It's dangerous!

808
00:52:56,838 --> 00:52:58,738
You're as cute as pie.

809
00:52:59,574 --> 00:53:02,441
I haven't laughed like this
in such a long time.

810
00:53:02,543 --> 00:53:04,010
Why not?

811
00:53:04,111 --> 00:53:07,877
It's hard to laugh
when men only see you as some curse.

812
00:53:07,982 --> 00:53:11,008
Jane, there is no curse.

813
00:53:11,118 --> 00:53:14,952
You're just afraid of intimacy,
or into-me-l-see.

814
00:53:15,056 --> 00:53:19,152
Remember, being vulnerable
is being woundable.

815
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,558
I say take the risk.

816
00:53:21,662 --> 00:53:25,860
- Well, that's easy to say and hard to do.
- Is it?

817
00:53:27,268 --> 00:53:31,102
What's the downside
of throwing away your fear?

818
00:53:31,205 --> 00:53:34,265
The only way out is in.

819
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,446
I think I'm about to risk something.

820
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,983
- What's wrong?
- We can't do this.

821
00:53:48,089 --> 00:53:49,556
What? You tell me to be vulnerable,

822
00:53:49,657 --> 00:53:50,715
and then you turn around
and wound me?

823
00:53:50,825 --> 00:53:53,259
- I can explain.
- Okay, go ahead.

824
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:54,692
I can't explain.

825
00:53:54,795 --> 00:53:57,355
- I should go.
- No, Jane, wait! I...

826
00:53:57,465 --> 00:53:59,729
Jane! Jane!

827
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:05,729
<i>Game three here in Los Angeles.</i>
<i>The L.A. Kings have beaten the Leafs.</i>

828
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,970
They are one game away
from a Stanley Cup victory.

829
00:54:10,077 --> 00:54:13,342
They can't be happy
in the Leafs' locker room right now.

830
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:17,781
I'm sorry, I blacked out for a second.
Have they dropped the puck?

831
00:54:17,885 --> 00:54:20,251
Damn it! We're down three games

832
00:54:20,354 --> 00:54:23,414
because you decided
you couldn't win without Roanoke.

833
00:54:23,524 --> 00:54:26,288
And you! You're just a stupid rich girl!

834
00:54:26,394 --> 00:54:29,227
You were born on third,
and you think you hit a triple!

835
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:30,592
You don't know hockey!

836
00:54:30,698 --> 00:54:32,563
- Are you finished?
- No!

837
00:54:35,202 --> 00:54:39,070
- Now I'm finished! And, Pitka!
- Yes?

838
00:54:39,173 --> 00:54:41,869
- What's the capital of Thailand?
- Bangkok.

839
00:54:41,976 --> 00:54:43,238
Exactly.

840
00:54:44,211 --> 00:54:47,112
Omar Sharif, my balls!

841
00:54:49,784 --> 00:54:51,843
My balls, you prick!

842
00:54:55,222 --> 00:54:57,656
- Stay down, bitch!
- Okay.

843
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:01,317
Jane! Jane, wait!

844
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:05,957
He's right! I'm just a stupid rich girl
about to be a huge failure.

845
00:55:06,067 --> 00:55:09,093
Failure?
There's no such thing as failure.

846
00:55:09,203 --> 00:55:11,398
Only early attempts at success.

847
00:55:11,505 --> 00:55:16,169
You know what? I hired you
to fix Darren Roanoke. Do your job!

848
00:55:20,448 --> 00:55:22,541
Your Holiness,
I spoke with the producers at <i>Oprah,</i>

849
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:26,211
and if they don't see Darren and
Prudence together by the next game,

850
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,379
your spot will go to Deepak.

851
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:32,084
But Darren is not ready!
He must truly deal with his mother.

852
00:55:32,193 --> 00:55:36,459
- And I will not take a shortcut.
- Take a shortcut!

853
00:55:36,564 --> 00:55:39,692
Do you want to be
the next Deepak Chopra or not?

854
00:55:55,649 --> 00:55:58,345
<i>Babu,</i> you cannot take a shortcut.

855
00:55:58,452 --> 00:56:00,886
But I need to become
the next Deepak Chopra!

856
00:56:00,988 --> 00:56:04,082
But how will you get Grande
away from Prudence?

857
00:56:04,191 --> 00:56:09,959
I have one idea that just might work.
Yeah.

858
00:56:10,531 --> 00:56:15,525
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome</i>
<i>the incredible Miss Celine Dion!</i>

859
00:56:19,073 --> 00:56:21,735
Celine! It is my day of lucky!

860
00:56:35,856 --> 00:56:37,551
What'll you have?

861
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:41,728
- A martini.
- All right, then.

862
00:56:53,007 --> 00:56:58,502
Jacques Grande.
Is he "Mr. Right" or "Mr. Right Now?"

863
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:11,082
Jacques and I get along just fine.

864
00:57:11,192 --> 00:57:13,786
You have,
what we call in the guru business,

865
00:57:13,894 --> 00:57:15,589
"love without knowledge."

866
00:57:15,696 --> 00:57:19,598
But what you had with Darren
is love with knowledge.

867
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,964
A real connection.

868
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:24,333
Come by my ashram tomorrow at noon.

869
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:27,635
I will show you a Darren
who is completely changed.

870
00:57:27,741 --> 00:57:29,709
Do you think he's really changed?

871
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,869
I mean, he can't even play
in front of his own mother.

872
00:57:31,979 --> 00:57:33,640
She's like kryptonite to him.

873
00:57:33,747 --> 00:57:36,272
Can't play in front of his mother?

874
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:40,776
Hey! I said stay away from the girl!

875
00:57:40,888 --> 00:57:44,221
Rajneesh, let's make like a baby
and head out.

876
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:52,699
- So you went to see your mother?
- Yes.

877
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,360
But did you stand up to her?

878
00:57:57,304 --> 00:57:59,169
He doesn't have to stand up
to his mother.

879
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:02,470
- Yes, he does!
- Not now, Kato.

880
00:58:02,576 --> 00:58:06,205
Now, aren't there a few more steps
in your Drama plan?

881
00:58:06,313 --> 00:58:10,807
- Yes. Maturity and Action.
- Beat it, Rajneesh.

882
00:58:11,385 --> 00:58:13,785
Yes. We did Maturity and Action.

883
00:58:13,888 --> 00:58:17,619
"M" and "A" spells "ma," and we went
to Buffalo and we saw his ma.

884
00:58:17,725 --> 00:58:19,022
Right. See?

885
00:58:19,126 --> 00:58:22,061
You see, I left 'cause I was scared
that if I didn't win the Stanley Cup,

886
00:58:22,163 --> 00:58:23,357
you would leave me.

887
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:26,433
But I don't care
if you win the Stanley Cup.

888
00:58:28,102 --> 00:58:29,933
Can you forgive me?

889
00:58:38,746 --> 00:58:40,611
Of course I can forgive you.

890
00:58:43,417 --> 00:58:46,045
Stick a fork in them, they're done.

891
00:58:46,153 --> 00:58:47,780
Champers wishes!

892
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:53,019
It would be great
if you could stick around for a while.

893
00:58:55,029 --> 00:58:56,087
You know,
just to make sure Darren's okay.

894
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:57,630
Yes, of course. Yeah, business.
Yes, of course.

895
00:58:57,731 --> 00:59:00,131
Would His Holiness staying on
qualify as an extension?

896
00:59:00,234 --> 00:59:02,327
Pants! <i>Sheket Bevakasha!</i>

897
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:06,428
Because if that were the case,
we would refuse payment.

898
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,065
- Of course, I'll stay, Jane.
- Until we get the call from <i>Oprah.</i>

899
00:59:09,176 --> 00:59:11,610
Go to your naughty mat, Dick!

900
00:59:11,712 --> 00:59:13,202
Miss Bullard.

901
00:59:15,516 --> 00:59:17,882
Mariska Hargitay.

902
00:59:20,354 --> 00:59:24,688
Your Holiness? Mark my words,
this shortcut will haunt you.

903
00:59:28,295 --> 00:59:30,593
- Congratulations.
- Well done.

904

01:01:55,909 --> 01:01:58,503
<i>Roanoke has done it! We're all tied!</i>

934
01:01:58,612 --> 01:02:01,547
<i>The Leafs have won</i>
<i>three straight games!</i>

935
01:02:01,648 --> 01:02:04,446
<i>Game seven will be in Toronto.</i>

936
01:02:04,551 --> 01:02:06,746
- Hey!
<i>- It's down to one game.</i>

937
01:02:06,854 --> 01:02:09,084
Get me out of here, pricks!

938
01:02:12,626 --> 01:02:17,825
...champion. I just got the call.
You are 100% booked on <i>Oprah.</i>

939
01:02:18,365 --> 01:02:19,525
Great.

940
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:22,292
I got on <i>Oprah,</i> right?

941
01:02:23,036 --> 01:02:26,494
- I'm the next Deepak Chopra, right?
- You are.

942
01:02:28,542 --> 01:02:30,836
He's definitely in.

943
01:02:30,944 --> 01:02:34,345
- Doesn't feel good, does it?
- Get off my tits!

944
01:02:37,751 --> 01:02:39,241
Congratulations.

945
01:02:39,353 --> 01:02:42,720
Darren and Prudence are back together,
we got a shot at winning the Cup,

946
01:02:42,823 --> 01:02:46,782
and you got on <i>Oprah.</i>
I suppose all that's left is...

947
01:02:46,894 --> 01:02:48,327
The check.

948
01:02:50,664 --> 01:02:52,393
Yeah. Here we go.

949
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:57,096
Oh, my pretty.
Miss Bullard, it has been terrific.

950
01:02:57,204 --> 01:02:59,798
Now, if any of your other players
have any professional catastrophe,

951
01:02:59,907 --> 01:03:04,776
personal pain, or a drug addiction,
please do not hesitate to call.

952
01:03:04,878 --> 01:03:07,938
Your Holiness,
the check and I will be in the car.

953
01:03:08,048 --> 01:03:09,640
- Cheerio.
- Bye.

954
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:14,252
- I guess you got everything you wanted.
- Not everything, Jane.

955
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:20,490
Well, say there was this guru, say.

956
01:03:20,594 --> 01:03:22,994
And this guru was, you know,
handsome, you know,

957
01:03:23,096 --> 01:03:26,327
had a nice gleam in his eye,
a nice tuck in his butt, say.

958
01:03:26,433 --> 01:03:31,166
And say this guru,
maybe not me, maybe somebody else,

959
01:03:31,271 --> 01:03:34,900
had a certain vow.

960
01:03:35,709 --> 01:03:37,540
What kind of vow?

961
01:03:38,779 --> 01:03:43,546
Forget about it. Just Etch A Sketch
everything I was saying.

962
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,251
Mariska Hargitay.

963
01:03:53,694 --> 01:03:55,662
Mariska Hargitay.

964
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:05,763
<i>Well, here we go. Game seven.</i>

965
01:04:05,873 --> 01:04:08,671
It all comes down to this,
ladies and gentlemen.

966
01:04:08,775 --> 01:04:10,003
Who do you like tonight, Jay?

967
01:04:11,678 --> 01:04:12,667
Jay?

968
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:14,906
I like the Christmas babies, Trent!

969
01:04:15,015 --> 01:04:19,247
And I like the way my skin feels
when I'm wearing my rainbow jacket!

970
01:04:25,025 --> 01:04:26,686
By your command.

971
01:04:29,663 --> 01:04:31,358
You're back on drugs, aren't you?

972
01:04:31,465 --> 01:04:34,491
Yes, I am, asshole-face man!

973
01:04:36,303 --> 01:04:38,737
By the power of Gahar,
I command thee to vanish!

974
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:40,932
- Let's see what's happening rinkside.
- No!

975
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:44,010
Well, here comes Lucy the elephant.

976
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:46,978
<i>I cannot be killed but with fire!</i>

977
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:52,211
<i>The Deluca Brothers Circus is</i>
<i>coming to town. Isn't that just adorable?</i>

978
01:04:52,853 --> 01:04:56,653
Well, whoever wins tonight
walks away Stanley Cup champions.

979
01:04:57,558 --> 01:05:01,654
Listen up! It's down to one game,
and we've got the momentum!

980
01:05:01,762 --> 01:05:03,525
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

981
01:05:07,935 --> 01:05:09,493
Why you got your heads down?

982
01:05:10,571 --> 01:05:12,436
We can beat these clowns.

983
01:05:12,539 --> 01:05:15,770
Besides, I still have
a few trick on my sleeve.

984
01:05:16,643 --> 01:05:21,273
<i>Flight 22 to Chicago</i>
<i>is now boarding at Gate Five.</i>

985
01:05:21,381 --> 01:05:25,977
Our plane leaves in 20 minutes.
The people at <i>Oprah</i> are very excited!

986
01:05:26,086 --> 01:05:27,178
That's great.

987
01:05:27,287 --> 01:05:30,984
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

990
01:05:38,332 --> 01:05:39,856
Hi, baby!

991
01:05:41,635 --> 01:05:42,602
What do I do?

992
01:05:43,804 --> 01:05:44,828
I don't know!

993
01:05:44,938 --> 01:05:48,066
<i>Oh, say, can you see</i>

<i>By the dawn's early light</i>

<i>Roanoke is freaking out...</i>

998
01:06:00,454 --> 01:06:02,251
What do I do?
What do I do? What do I do?

999
01:06:02,356 --> 01:06:06,019
No, no! Nothing to see here.
Our plane is about to leave for <i>Oprah,</i>

1000
01:06:06,126 --> 01:06:09,618
and we have to go realize
every dream we've ever had.

1001
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:12,924
I am not going with you, Dick.

1002
01:06:13,033 --> 01:06:15,399
Oh, no! No!

1003
01:06:15,502 --> 01:06:19,700
If you don't get on that plane,
I will take 60% of the ashram!

1004
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:23,031
Fine. I don't need material things.

1005
01:06:23,944 --> 01:06:27,903
I was put on this earth
to spread a message of peace and love.

1006
01:06:28,015 --> 01:06:31,416
- Give me that ticket! Give me it!
- No! Please, no!

1007

You will never be
the next Deepak Chopra!

1008

What?

1009
01:06:48,368 --> 01:06:49,892
Box him out!

1010
01:06:51,605 --> 01:06:52,833
Oh, damn.

1011

Baby, are you all right?

1015
01:07:04,885 --> 01:07:07,319
I can't play in front of you, Ma!

1016
01:07:07,954 --> 01:07:12,084
It's all my fault for not putting
more pressure on you to succeed.

1017
01:07:16,563 --> 01:07:17,552
- Yes.
- Hello?

1018
01:07:17,664 --> 01:07:19,222
Jane, I'm on my way.

1019

- I thought you said he was cured!
- I was wrong.

Tell Coach Cherkov to buy some time!

1021

Okay.

Wait a second, who is Chip?

- Boo! You suck, Bullard!
- No, you suck!

1032

You can say bad things about me,
but I won't say bad things about myself!

So, guess what?
You can all just kiss my Canadian ass!

Are you as turned on as I am right now?

You're a bad, bad person.

1037

I'll take that as a yes.

1042
01:08:42,415 --> 01:08:45,009
- Jane!
- You lied to me!

1043
01:08:45,118 --> 01:08:48,349
Yes. I only pulled away from you
because of this.

1044
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:56,756
My name is the Guru Pitka,
and I wear a chastity belt.

1045
01:08:58,265 --> 01:09:03,430
So, you didn't reject me.
You're just devoted to a higher purpose.

1046
01:09:03,537 --> 01:09:04,936
Yes, Jane.

1047
01:09:07,774 --> 01:09:10,106

Good luck. He won't even let me in.

1049
01:09:22,689 --> 01:09:26,682
Darren, I took a shortcut with you,
and I'm sorry.

1050
01:09:27,394 --> 01:09:29,760
Now, what is it you can't face?

1051
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:34,392
- What did you say to me?
- What is it you can't face?

01:09:35,035 --> 01:09:39,165
- I can't face my ma.
- Then that's what you have to face.

1053
01:09:39,272 --> 01:09:41,303
- Will you help me?
- I can't.

1054
01:09:41,408 --> 01:09:44,468
You're on your own

1055
01:09:44,578 --> 01:09:48,344
Darren, the only way out is in.

1056
01:09:51,084 --> 01:09:52,517
Yes, yes, yes, it's good.

1057
01:09:52,619 --> 01:09:56,146
It's good, it's good,

What the hell happened to you?

1059
01:09:57,824 --> 01:10:02,158
Ma! I'm a grown man,

1060
01:10:04,497 --> 01:10:05,896
I love you.

Now, how long will it take you
to get dressed and get down to the ice?

1063
01:10:17,177 --> 01:10:18,769
- Five minutes.
- Well, you better hurry up,

1064
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,847
'cause there's only six minutes
left in the game!

1065
01:10:20,947 --> 01:10:24,280
Go, baby boy! Go, go, go, go, go!

1066
01:10:24,784 --> 01:10:28,117
I think I made a happy wee-wee. Yeah.

1067
01:10:31,024 --> 01:10:35,620
Come on. Let's go quickly!
Come on. Come, come. Hello?

1068
01:10:35,795 --> 01:10:42,462

- Coach, I'm ready.
- Get in there!

1070
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:49,272
Darren Roanoke is in the game!

1071
01:10:57,050 --> 01:11:00,781
Hey, Rob Blake. The first thing
they teach you about hockey

1072
01:11:00,887 --> 01:11:03,151
is never ever watch the puck.

1073

<i>Roanoke's going for the Ice Slam!</i>

1074

<i>This is it, folks.</i>

<i>just him and Grande!</i>

1079
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:44,628
<i>With one second left! It's a penalty shot.</i>

1080
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:47,632
<i>Roanoke could win</i>
<i>the Stanley Cup here.</i>

1081
01:11:48,134 --> 01:11:49,226
Hey!

1082
01:11:49,903 --> 01:11:56,308
Listen, Darren, I know we are rivals,
but fate chose these sides, not us.

1083
01:11:57,243 --> 01:12:01,304
So, before you take this shot,
I just need to say

1084
01:12:04,284 --> 01:12:05,615
damn!

1085
01:12:07,988 --> 01:12:09,546
Show it to me.

1086
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:21,795
Damn!

1087
01:12:23,169 --> 01:12:29,768
I don't know what Grande just said
to Roanoke, but he is now out to lunch.

1088
01:12:30,377 --> 01:12:33,005
Superstar! What did he say to you?

1089
01:12:33,113 --> 01:12:34,740
He said, "Damn!"

1090
01:12:34,848 --> 01:12:38,181
"Damn!" Quaking pudding.
That's not good.

1091
01:12:38,284 --> 01:12:40,650
- Cherkov, call a time-out.
- We're out of time-outs.

1092
01:12:40,754 --> 01:12:41,914
Just buy us some time.

1093
01:12:42,022 --> 01:12:44,217
He needs a distraction. Jane, follow me!

1094
01:12:44,324 --> 01:12:45,951
He's gotta take the shot, now!

1095
01:12:46,059 --> 01:12:48,857
I promised myself I'd never do this.

1096
01:12:48,962 --> 01:12:51,624
Hey, ref! I'm having a heart attack.

1097
01:12:54,067 --> 01:12:57,059
Out of the way! Coach! Coach!

1098
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:58,899
Get the crash kit!

1099
01:12:59,406 --> 01:13:02,898
- Sir, may I borrow your elephant, Lucy?
- Sure.

1100
01:13:03,009 --> 01:13:07,275
Bodhisattva!

1101
01:13:10,483 --> 01:13:13,782
Come, come! Come on, boy!
Elephant coming through!

1102
01:13:13,887 --> 01:13:17,084
Come on, Bodhi!
Let's go quickly! Come on, Bodhi!

1103
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:23,223
Clear!

1104
01:13:47,687 --> 01:13:48,847
Yes!

1105
01:13:54,928 --> 01:13:56,259
Yes!

1106
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,401
Get busy, Bodhi.

1107
01:14:32,465 --> 01:14:33,932
Eight seconds!

1108
01:14:37,303 --> 01:14:39,100
What do you make of this?

1109
01:14:39,205 --> 01:14:43,437
I think they're doing it, Trent.
I think they're doing it hard.

1110
01:14:44,077 --> 01:14:46,511
Let's go to the Kellistrator.

1111
01:14:54,854 --> 01:14:57,618
The ultimate distraction!

1112
01:15:03,163 --> 01:15:05,461
- I love you.
- I love you.

1113
01:15:11,604 --> 01:15:15,870
Post-ejaculation,
the barbs at the tip of the penis retract.

1114
01:15:15,975 --> 01:15:19,843
Bing-bam-boom, you got
a baby pachyderm. Back to you, Trent.

1115
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:28,712
Now, what happens
if you don't score this goal?

1116
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:29,947
I'd still be a hero

1117
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:31,857
to me!

1118
01:15:31,991 --> 01:15:35,859
Yes! "Gee, you are you." TM.

1119
01:15:38,064 --> 01:15:39,429
Go get 'em!

1120
01:15:44,704 --> 01:15:46,934
Come on, Roanoke! Let's go!

1121
01:15:56,482 --> 01:15:57,881
Five-hole!

1122
01:15:58,952 --> 01:16:00,044
No!

1123
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:03,750
<i>Five-hole trap!</i>

1124
01:16:11,998 --> 01:16:16,662
<i>The Toronto Maple Leafs</i>
<i>have won the Stanley Cup!</i>

1125
01:16:16,769 --> 01:16:19,499
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1126
01:16:20,006 --> 01:16:21,405
Yeah!

1127
01:16:23,776 --> 01:16:28,611
- I love hockey! I love hockey!
- I love hockey, too!

1128
01:16:29,082 --> 01:16:30,777
They did it!

1129
01:16:35,922 --> 01:16:39,653
The curse is over for the Leafs,
and I need to sleep!

1130
01:16:45,131 --> 01:16:47,793
We didn't waste time.
We didn't waste no time.

1131
01:16:50,003 --> 01:16:52,904
- Maurice?
- Deepak Chopra!

1132
01:16:53,506 --> 01:16:56,202
Oprah called me,
and she said you canceled.

1133
01:16:56,309 --> 01:16:58,470
I told her
she should give you another chance.

1134
01:16:58,578 --> 01:17:03,845
As great as you are, I don't need
to become the next Deepak Chopra.

1135
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:06,180
I am the first Guru Pitka!

1136
01:17:06,953 --> 01:17:08,420
You are free.

1137
01:17:08,521 --> 01:17:10,921
You're a good man, Deepak Chopra.

1138
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:15,686
Hey, Pitka?
Sorry I punched you in the nuts.

1139
01:17:16,663 --> 01:17:18,961
That's okay. Give me a hug.

1140
01:17:23,436 --> 01:17:26,132
If you ever sucker punch me again,

1141
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:30,073
I'll kick your ass all the way back
to the Keebler factory.

1142
01:17:31,744 --> 01:17:34,838
Give me a pound. Lock it down.

1143
01:17:34,947 --> 01:17:37,780
Break the pickle. Tickle, tickle.

1144
01:17:38,718 --> 01:17:39,878
- You.
- No, you.

1145
01:17:39,986 --> 01:17:42,079
- Come on now, you.
- No, you.

1146
01:17:42,188 --> 01:17:43,746
Well, no, you.

1147
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:58,065
<i>And so our story ends</i>
<i>where it all began,</i>

1148
01:17:58,871 --> 01:18:02,932
<i>here in the tiny Indian village</i>
<i>of Harenmahkeester,</i>

1149
01:18:03,042 --> 01:18:05,408
<i>in the valley of Lintinmybelli.</i>

1150
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:07,103
Oh, hi.

1151
01:18:07,213 --> 01:18:11,115
- Maurice.
- Oh, my God. You look so beautiful.

1152
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:13,474
Thank you.

1153
01:18:14,454 --> 01:18:18,652
Maurice.
You have finally learned to love yourself.

1154
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:21,750
You may now renounce
your vow of chastity.

1155
01:18:21,861 --> 01:18:23,726
May I have the key?

1156
01:18:28,101 --> 01:18:31,593
There is no key. There never was.

1157
01:18:31,704 --> 01:18:33,797
There's a snap in the back.

1158
01:18:39,612 --> 01:18:44,015
Thank you, Guru Tugginmypudha. Yeah.

1159
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:45,744
Are you leaving?

1160
01:18:45,852 --> 01:18:51,313
The last rule of guru
is to rid student of the need of guru.

1161
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:53,516
Yes, of course.

1162
01:18:58,731 --> 01:19:00,699
Okay, see you.

1163
01:19:02,969 --> 01:19:04,960
Doesn't work sometimes.

1164
01:19:06,572 --> 01:19:08,733
So, what do you want to do now?

1165
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:11,173
Well, I've been wearing this belt
since I was 12 years old.

1166
01:19:11,277 --> 01:19:13,871
What do you think I want to do now?

1167
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:15,574
I want to sing!

1168
01:19:16,949 --> 01:19:21,579
<i>Some people call me</i>

Hey, Peter,
can we move the camera in?

1189
01:21:18,137 --> 01:21:20,264
All I can see is asses.
