You have a map of the stars homes?

9
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,212
C & apos; eastern & apos; wasted money,
except to see a cheesy TV.

J & apos; got Al Gore once.

00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:02,537
Probably the most famous.

18
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:05,950
J & apos;'ve also had Tatum O & apos;
Neal for his reality show.

Actor, writer.

I know Carrie Fisher.

28
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,917
Really?

29
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:35,063
- But how?
- Met on Twitter.

30
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:37,748

It could become an HBO film.

00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:50,175
C & apos; hell is this place?

34
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:52,401
I thought c & apos; was on the map.

35
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,817
There was a big house.

36

The house & apos; childhood Benjie Weiss.

37
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,414
How do you know?

38
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:03,831
J & apos; was his babysitter.

39
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,168
The evil babysitter, c & apos; was me.

40
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:10,352
Strange!

41
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:16,872
My agent wants me to play in Babysitter 2

42
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:19,826
This & apos; not sure yet but

43
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,354
Jakob Leitner, my personal trainer,
m & apos; got an audition.

44
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:26,922
It is very influential.
We were together in Beverly.

45
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,798
Fingers crossed.

46
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:39,197

Why is that?

You're so caught.

50
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:48,517
Not for you.

51
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:54,769
J & apos; loved Bad Babysitter.

52
00:04:57,838 --> 00:05:00,560
It was $ 780 million in the world
.

53
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:02,364
People tend to forget.

54
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,663
You don & apos; did not & apos; iPad?

00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:26,605
How did you get AIDS?

60
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:33,126
I don & apos; not have AIDS,
c & apos; is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

61
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:40,990
You know what...

62
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:43,905
I'll make a movie about your life.

63
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:47,702
Ryan Gosling will play my role.
And I, yours.

64
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,891
We'll all  Oscar.

65
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,146

66
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:57,252
- C & apos;'s this disease, damn!
- Something to blood, I think.

67
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:00,167
C & apos; is "no" that m & apos; bored.
You & apos; aces or you & apos; did not.

68
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:02,431
You were serious?

69
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:04,924
Could show it to Ryan.
He ​​will like.

70
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:06,651
We could show Ryan?

71
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:09,949
You come just to wipe your ass.

72
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,903
It would be very moving.

73
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:15,856
J & apos;'ve even Song:
A shitty life.

00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,999
Stop, Benjie.

80
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:35,878
Stop?

81
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:37,681
J & apos;'ve got a better idea.

82
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:39,982
Show me your pussy!

83
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,243
I know you have one.

- Five million.

86
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,939
Plus 10%.

87
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:57,895

20% of revenues.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,227
You think about it what?

91
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:06,410
We have them by the balls.

92
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,518
Super.

93
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:11,474
C & apos;'s when, & apos; audition?

94
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,583
This & apos; not an audition.

95
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:16,038
C & apos;'s true.

96
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,531
And c & apos; When is the test & apos; urine?

97
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:23,172
They are seen Friday at 10:00.

98
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,662
They want s & apos; make sure you're clean.

99
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:29,809
But  & apos; agreement depends on the match?

100
00:07:29,846 --> 00:07:33,145
- They protect their franchise.
- C & apos;'s me, the franchise.

101
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,249
You want to eat, Stafford?

102
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:40,395
J & apos; listening to a cassette of the Dalai Lama.

But Tibet is overpriced.

105
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,409
J & apos;'ve even kept the receipt & apos; Amazon.

106
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:52,477
Buddhists say a prayer...

107
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:54,970
- Genie will be there?
- She does not prefer.

108
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,927
I want that & apos; she comes.

109
00:07:57,425 --> 00:08:01,760
"Do eaters,

110
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,754
." Are completely without ego "

111
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:06,286
I go into my room

112
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:13,075
No, Mom...

113
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:15,492

N & apos;. between not in my room when
I sleep

00:08:28,456 --> 00:08:30,067
I will not let you do more

119
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,056
Species bitch

120
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:38,084
You're hurting me

121
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:39,695
How

122
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:42,534
I t & apos;..!.? did wrong

123
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:45,525
J & apos; was your little girl

124
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:47,635
and yet you m & apos; did wrong

125
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,856
Why, Mom

126
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:54,194
Your parents t & apos;.? beat
This b & apos;'s no excuse?.

127
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,337
Stop  forgive Havana.

128
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:02,901
I do not care that & apos; they did.
They would have killed you.

129
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,011
I t & apos; would have killed her...

130
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:08,616
How dare you do that to a child
?

131
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:13,871
How could you do this to me
to me, your daughter?

132
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:17,553
I want to be free, Clarice.

133
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:22,617
Clarice, mom, free me!

134
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:27,028
I want to be free.

135
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:30,020
I want to win back the stolen years.

136
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:31,324
S & apos; he pleases you...

137
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,579
I now rely on a special item.

138
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:40,107
Everything is stored in
thighs.

139
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:48,507
Regains years, Havana.

140
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:52,497
Stolen Regains years the little girl.

141
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,957
Rebecca, stop.
You're a patient here.

142
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:08,338
I want t & apos; help, not...

143
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:10,831
Do not you think that I & apos;'ve fired?

144
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,520
I think you do not want to.

145
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,744
You need & apos; help.

146
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,854
You do not want m & apos; help?

147
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:18,273
Not like that...

148
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,583
should think about that & apos;'re doing.

149
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:38,180
On any given flesh

150
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:41,861
On the front of my friends

151
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,970
On each hand reaching

152
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:47,808
J & apos; put your name

153

Miss Havana?

154
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,295
Miss Genie is there.

155
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:06,910
How are you, darling?

156
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:09,979
It's going... J & apos;'ve had a very hard session with
Stafford.

157
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:13,161
You're so brave!

158
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,191
I do not feel brave.

159
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:19,260
J & apos; i need & apos; slave.

160
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,102
And your famous Adagio?

161
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,709
J & apos; had to fire her.

162
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:25,897
- But why?
- It robbed me.

163
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:29,885
My God... Incredible!

164
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:33,376
It m & apos; stole & apos; silver ring
and Vicodin.

165
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:35,178
My God!

166
00:11:35,217 --> 00:11:36,828
And you & apos; got caught in the act?

167
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:40,511
- You called the police?
- I & apos;'ve threatened to do so.

168
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:42,926
And she is & apos; hosto?

169
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:45,995
With all the slaves cameos.

170
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:47,568
They have their special wing.

171
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:50,253
I'll call Carrie.

172
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:54,779
Not. Love her all you want but
& apos; not fuck with that.

173
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:55,892
It will make laugh.

174
00:11:56,352 --> 00:11:59,343
I have to see her at a party.
It will give me names.

175
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:02,144
Good...

176
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:05,980
And Stolen Waters?

177
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,894
They are all at Sundance.

178
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:11,733
Everyone except me!

179
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:13,804
C & apos; was the best reading of my life.

180
00:12:14,072 --> 00:12:16,451
I'm totally amazed!

181
00:12:16,911 --> 00:12:17,947
I know.

182
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:22,894
The only thing that worries might be

183
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:26,385
to cast a star in a supporting role.

184
00:12:26,423 --> 00:12:28,227
But everyone does!

185
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,596
C & apos; film is rather minor,
your mother turned

186
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:34,786
There 30 years.

187
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:36,549
It could be great.

188
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,468
C & apos;'s a reinvention.

189
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,194
C & apos;'s a film & apos; author.

190
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:43,186
Who do you think has had the & apos;
idea of ​​my mother watching

191
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:45,449
Stolen Waters if she lived?

192
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:46,714
C & apos;'s me!

193
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:49,131
J & apos;'ve given & apos; idea Damien
there 4 years.

194
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,860
I know.

195
00:12:49,898 --> 00:12:52,852
I deserve the role and
& apos; be credited as a producer.

196
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,805
Worth & apos; Oscar for Supporting Actress,

197
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:58,490
& apos; is a second chance...

198
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,140
c & apos; Javitz is Damien.

199
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:02,135
It raises the actors!

200
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:04,205
And I & apos;'ve been great.

201
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:07,848
Sterl always does?

202
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:11,762
It m & apos; owes.

203
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,332
I & apos; was presented to Harvey, who produced.

204
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,518
J & apos;'ve talked to Harvey

205
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:19,087
will talk to Damien.
But you know...

206
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,197
Harvey Harvey will always

207
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,422
and Sterl can talk...

208
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,761
You know that & apos; everything is done for.

209
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:28,178
But ultimately, c & apos;'s a film & apos; author.

210
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:31,784
You'd be great in this role.
But in case you & apos; forgot,

211
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,393
your mother is dead but a cult actress.

212
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,503
And Damien Javitz

213
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:38,957
& apos; not PT Anderson.

214
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:41,297
- There are so many movies...
- Really?

215
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:43,445
- The blockbusters.
- Where?

216
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:44,480
Where it Genie?

217
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,246
L & apos; other day Jacob m & apos; said,

218
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,159
as I know many celebrities

219
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:51,422
I should become an agent.

220
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,875
You know what & apos;
we feel when we told you that?

221
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:57,329
All I'm doing

222
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,054
in my life and in my analysis,

223
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:01,895
& apos;'s role.

224
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,196
It will not?

225
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:06,229
J & apos; have cramps.

226
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:07,878
- It's all right?
- No, that's wrong.

227
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:29,320
L & apos; mother-daughter incest,
it's too 80s

228
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:31,583
I'm not Anne Sexton.

229
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:34,344
The shock will s & apos; mitigate.

230
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:37,106
Qu & apos; do that & apos; there, Havana?

231
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:41,248
You thought it would be the sixth sense?
The dead speak?

232
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,742
You want to know what the dead?

233
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:46,312
You know what & apos;'s & apos; Hell?

234
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:48,805
A drug-free world!

235
00:14:50,071 --> 00:14:51,720
But what is happening?

236
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,446
The worst cliche porn Vana

237
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:56,284
this fantasy child rape!
Vis, whore!

238
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,123
Or die.

239
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:02,998
C & apos; not a little shabby
want to be me & apos; screen?

240
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,877
You hate me,

241
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:07,293
but you're ready for anything
for me!

242
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:12,242
Do you want this role, but you do
& apos; shalt not.

243
00:15:13,123 --> 00:15:14,620
You don & apos; not even have the talent.

244
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:18,379
I & apos; was
and j & apos; was young and beautiful.

245
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,870
You? With your tits hanging
and your old worn hole?

246
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:23,556
It stinks even more than me!

247
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,264
Who is this?

248
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,201
C & apos;'s non-Hodgkins.

249
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:56,889
What are you doing here?

250
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:02,758
On my notebooks & apos; schoolboy

251
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,059
On my desk and trees

252
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,207
On the sand snow

253
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,119
J & apos; put your name

254
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,380
I'll make this movie...

255
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,757
You are just that?

256
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:18,024
What & apos; said Arnold?

257
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:20,747
On any given flesh

258
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,934
On the front of my friends

259
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:24,583
On each hand reaching

260
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:26,462
J & apos; put your name

261
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,865
On my notebooks & apos; schoolboy

262
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:36,321
On my desk and Trees

263
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:38,046
On the sand snow

264
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,618
J & apos; put your name

265
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,652
On any given flesh

266
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,492
On the front of my friends

267
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:44,950
On each hand reaching

268
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,063
J & apos; put your name

269
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:47,827
Freedom

270
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,582
See you at & apos;
school with Bad Babysitters.

271
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:09,767
I'm stuck?

272
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:12,069
Not at all. You're the first.

273
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,562
Your holidays were hectic.

274
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,020
Rather productive.

275
00:17:16,058 --> 00:17:17,784
It & apos; was not easy

276
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:19,202
for any of us.

277
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:21,505
But he learned a lot.

278
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,113
Absolutely.

279
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:27,987
I myself spent
by this drug trip.

280
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:30,442
Not at your age, of course, but...

281
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,820
We all do stupid things, right?

282
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,198
It & apos; arrived very young.

283
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,189
Benjie has matured a lot.

284
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:39,877
A lot.

285
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:44,519
In Praise the Heavy,
I was getting 300,000 a week.

286
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:47,242
J & apos; was 9 years old.

287
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,543
C & apos; not hallucinating?

288
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:50,848
L & apos; crazy money.

289
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:52,497
For all.

290
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:53,993
He was worth.

291
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,027
You have many fans.

292
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,020
J & apos;'ve exceeded...

293
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,513
Mother Teresa péterait sinkers
before so much dough.

294
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:02,202
She has already lost it.

295
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,848
She is dead.
You can not fart higher!

296
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:10,218
We have a warrant.
Cristina knows.

297
00:18:10,678 --> 00:18:12,212
And you too.

298
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:13,823
Must protect the franchise.

299
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:18,043
We & apos; played tight...

300
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,804
Arnold, your team was great.

301
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:22,339
Nothing in the tabloids.

302
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:25,408
An adult into rehab,
it can boost a career.

303
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:26,865
A kid, c & apos; different.

304
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,436
We understand Jeb.

305
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,813
Although Drew has benefited.

306
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:34,537
Friends,

307
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:37,413
we are on your side.
You have to understand.

308
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:41,403
We would not be here without
a dose of confidence.

309
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:46,734
- There are already a budget?
- 58

310
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:48,383
But C & apos; is confidential.

311
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:51,682
We lost it.
But we did not count on it.

312
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:54,635
Sign is Emma Watson for the young mother.

313
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,633
It s  & apos; entertain well.

314
00:18:58,357 --> 00:19:01,540
One must know how Benjie s & apos; is detoxified.

315
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:05,184
Benjie went into a private home.

316
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:07,524
That of & apos; associate of my husband.

317
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:10,477
Your mother is really great.

318
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:14,620
She can hit without a trace.

319
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:32,992
Damn.

320
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:39,667
Never nobody m & apos;
yet humble way.

321
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:40,779
Never.

322
00:19:41,776 --> 00:19:43,502
C & apos;'s over, baby.

323
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,845
They were.

324
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,835
Damien finds me too old?

325
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,979
And the cast? Sarah Horowitz?

326
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,895
Havana, the character is simply
younger.

327
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:58,194
C & apos;
which is Sarah Horowitz & apos m; gave my first role.

328
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:02,297
He must have seen me in this horror
on TNT.

329
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,523
Do not work for the & apos; silver.

330
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:07,437
We can not all be as malignant as
you.

331
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,621
You'll support me, Sterl?

332
00:20:11,197 --> 00:20:12,462
You'll talk to Damien?

333
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:14,802
You know I do.

334
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:21,936
He thinks Azita Wachtel.

335
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,500
She was nominated for an Oscar
and is Canadian.

336
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:29,032
You know the reputation of this Wachtel?

337
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:33,060
It would leave producers
piss him in the ass.

338
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:35,322
C & apos;'s good to know.

339
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,158
You know him well, Damien...

340
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,307
That's three times
I & apos; calls in vain.

341
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:42,496
Your reading was great.

342
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,721
There you & apos; said?

343
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,600
He said C & apos; "very strong".

344
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,249
There & apos s; really said?

345
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:49,668
Yes.

346
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:55,345
I have to have this role.
It would be awesome together.

347
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:57,533
I thought that & apos; we & apos; already.

348
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:01,061
Diandra?

349
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:02,978
But it is very old!

350
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:05,970
She is 23! 16 on IMDb.

351
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,502
- How do you know that & apos; she is 23 years old?
- Large pierced lips.

352
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,148
Please take 23 years for that?

353
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,683
It is tattooed on his ass.

354
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:13,948
She is menopausal!

355
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:17,170
Sympas, girls, right?

356
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:20,010
- Rhett, you told him?
- You will not believe it.

357
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,078
C & apos;'s too weird.
I will not tell you.

358
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,649
It's starting to like me.

359
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,185
C & apos;'s a crazy...

360
00:21:26,222 --> 00:21:30,173
She posted 6,000 messages on my Facebook
in 2 months.

361
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:31,401
You'll & apos; marry?

362
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:34,048
- Fuck her, Rhett.
- Licking for the rules.

363
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,349
- Do not be vulgar.
- He does not like that.

364
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,609
It can not... because t & apos;'re menopausal.

365
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,182
Shut up!

366
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,787
Calm down!

367
00:21:45,977 --> 00:21:49,314
We discover that & apos; technician sold him my shit

368
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:50,733
to 3000 dollars.

369
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:52,727
You said, your shit?

370
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:55,067
You heard. My shit.

371
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,947
C & apos; shit is high quality.

372
00:21:57,331 --> 00:21:59,823
It is rice Nobu.

373
00:22:01,665 --> 00:22:03,276
Straight from your caravan?

374
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:07,418
When the guy is emptying...

375
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:08,685
Qu & apos; do that & apos; she did?

376
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:10,870
She & apos; stores... just in case.

377
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:14,476
- Where is she & apos; money?
- A brown box...

378
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,238
Benjie, you're disgusting!

379
00:22:17,276 --> 00:22:20,498
I offer daily specials when
j & apos; have the runs...

380
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:22,914
- Liquidation of stock.
- Everything must go.

381
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:27,287
Come...

382
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,589
Who is it?

383
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,772
- Starla Gent. Country singer.
- She won The Voice?

384
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,457
She made second.
C & apos;'s a fucking bitch.

385
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:38,488
And a great actress!

386
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,597
Javitz gave him your role.

387
00:22:40,636 --> 00:22:42,094
Shut up!

388
00:22:43,551 --> 00:22:46,121
I wonder if Blake Shelton pissed in that ass.

389
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:48,959
And Sam, you like her?

390
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:51,989
You can kiss it, you know.

391
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:55,327
She wants to play in your film.
And she has good Vicodin.

392
00:22:55,595 --> 00:22:57,512
It's been almost 90 days.

393
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:59,239
- What?
- What I'm sober, asshole.

394
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,267
My God, what a stench!

395
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:06,681
This bitch
TV was in the toilet.

396
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,559
How it s & apos; calls?

397
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:10,439
As if a corpse had farted.

398
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,735
This & apos; not Sterl Carruth?

399
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:17,036
Yes, Havana Segrand.

400
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:18,685
We have the same agent.

401
00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:20,258
How old is she?

402
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:21,907
Totally menopause.

403
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:23,020
Beyond.

404
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:25,705
Quasi-dead.
Older than my grandmother.

405
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:29,043
No, it & apos; is a GMB
Grandmother fuckable.

406
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:33,338
- They fuck together?
- Genre fucking compassion.

407
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:36,329
As nurses who violate the old to the & apos; hospice?

408
00:23:36,944 --> 00:23:39,207
His mother & apos;
not die in a fire?

409
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:40,741
As Jack Cassidy.

410
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:41,969
C & apos;'s that?

411
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:44,500
The Swinger deviation.
The father of David Cassidy.

412
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:46,878
- And c & apos;'s that?
- The brother of Shawn Cassidy.

413
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:50,752
You know that his mother was a very cool
actress.

414
00:23:51,173 --> 00:23:52,555
Clarice Taggart?

415
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:57,120
A & E made a documentary about it.
It was very cool.

416
00:23:57,158 --> 00:23:58,501
She was young.

417
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:08,780
C & apos; hell is that?

418
00:24:18,676 --> 00:24:20,480
Hi, Damien, what's going on?

419
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:22,397
Yes, I know.

420
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:24,814
I am ready to wear two earrings
& apos; ear.

421
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:27,536
Maestro

422
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:32,255
I am with my kids
and I tell them a story.

423
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:33,558
Can I call you?

424
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:40,655
Yes, I remember you. Immediately
.

425
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:43,800
Cite my name when you speak.

426
00:24:43,838 --> 00:24:45,641
You're so crazy.

427
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:48,173
Suck me and say something about you.

428
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,485
I & apos; loved so much.

429
00:25:01,214 --> 00:25:05,204
You were a little girl so pretty...
But you were lying.

430
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:08,349
How could you become
monster who lies?

431
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:14,293
Qu & apos; do that & apos; he goes?

432
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:29,713
Tell me.

433
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:32,668
I'm sorry...

434
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:35,736
J & apos; was not & apos; ease.

435
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,187
I'm not terrible, as dyke.

436
00:25:40,223 --> 00:25:41,911
You should take a Klonopin.

437
00:25:53,763 --> 00:25:55,105
I know a man

438
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:58,328
who lives under  & apos;
sword of Damocles we call AIDS.

439
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:01,205
"When my time comes,"
m & apos;

440
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,854
. "I'll be ready

441
00:26:03,122 --> 00:26:06,191
." Has he said,  My bags are packed, the
threshold "

442
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:07,956
J & apos; like it

443
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:09,567
J & apos;. really like.

444
00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:12,904
There is a time
in our life and therapy

445
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:16,739
s when our eyes & apos;
linger on luggage near the door.

446
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:18,312
After crying.

447
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,000
After suffering.

448
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,953
After dried fountains Memory

449
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:26,098
and bloodied our hands on the remains of our parents.

450
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,630
I thought Garry Marshall would be there,

451
00:26:28,668 --> 00:26:31,008
that & apos; was a meeting, not a hearing
.

452
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:34,077
They m & apos; gave a bad route.
J & apos; had to walk two terminals.

453
00:26:34,115 --> 00:26:35,572
At & apos; arrival I stank.

454
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,679
And the casting director
not even calculates me.

455
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:41,173
It goes without saying to me hello.

456
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:45,238
And she told me that Garry
didn & apos; perhaps even expect it.

457
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,768
C & apos; Garry Marshall is not Bertolucci.
His films are even more & apos; silver.

458
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:50,225
And I know Garry well.

459
00:26:50,454 --> 00:26:52,296
She told me that & apos; they will shoot me.

460
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:55,289
And I: "Sorry, but I need
makeup."

461
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:57,475
And she said:
"Well, you do it or not?"

462
00:26:57,513 --> 00:26:58,855
Like this!

463
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:01,003
I & apos; take it anymore, Jacob!

464
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:03,727
I'm so tired and
c & apos;'s so pathetic...

465
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:05,760
C & apos;'s Carrie?

466
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:08,214
In addition, Jacob more.

467
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:10,861
Hi, Carrie!

468
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,544
How are you?

469
00:27:15,273 --> 00:27:18,072
When  j & apos;
have reconnected with myself, I'll tell you.

470
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,568
It was crazy.

471
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:20,565
Have you finished filming?

472
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:23,826
We return to Prague tomorrow
to redo some scenes.

473
00:27:23,864 --> 00:27:25,168
You go Javitz?

474
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:27,585
J & apos; hope.
Did you hear something?

475
00:27:27,623 --> 00:27:29,579
Genie m & apos; said you preparing yourself.

476
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:33,108
It would be so great
you play your own mother.

477
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:36,023
Every girl should have the opportunity, right?

478
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:38,287
You know Damien?

479
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:41,701
We just had dinner together in Tangier.

480
00:27:41,738 --> 00:27:44,040
If you see him, tell him to m & apos; commit.

481
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:47,224
Genie m & apos; spoke of & apos; Adagio.

482
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,867
- You & apos;'ve had a long time?
- Three years.

483
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:53,476
Still Looking an assistant?

484
00:27:53,514 --> 00:27:55,394
Yes. You became my agency
& apos; hiring.

485
00:27:55,431 --> 00:27:56,698
Do me a favor.

486
00:27:56,736 --> 00:27:58,156
It will seem odd,

487
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:02,183
but & apos;
would like you to see a girl he met on the Internet.

488
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:04,522
I'm so nervous.

489
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,054
It's okay. Want some tea?

490
00:28:08,051 --> 00:28:09,509
Thank you. Yes.

491
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,074
Your home is so beautiful.

492
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:17,833
The walls so thick and the wind organ
...

493
00:28:17,871 --> 00:28:20,824
They come & apos;
a monastery in Dharamsala.

494
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:24,852
J & apos;'ve met the Dalai Lama,
c & apos;'s a very cool guy.

495
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,651
He laughs a lot.

496
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:32,101
C & apos;
is like a guy with whom you would want to hang out,

497
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,825
but & apos;
is impossible because it is the Dalai Lama.

498
00:28:36,436 --> 00:28:38,085
Thanks for the tea.

499
00:28:38,124 --> 00:28:40,847

My housekeeper.

500
00:28:41,614 --> 00:28:44,951
One of his daughters is sick.
It should have 40 kids.

501
00:28:46,984 --> 00:28:49,017
So you know why you're here.

502
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:50,053
Thanks to Carrie.

503
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,431
You are known on the Net?

504
00:28:52,738 --> 00:28:56,343
She was looking for someone & apos; one on Twitter,
for a novel.

505
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:58,261
On a girl who had been burned.

506
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:01,713
I replied and s & apos;
is seen in a Star Wars convention.

507
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,283
It must have been strange for you.

508
00:29:05,088 --> 00:29:08,733
She is so great and so funny.

509
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:12,146
We are pretty crazy, we finish each
phrases & apos; another.

510
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:13,911
You came to see her?

511
00:29:14,946 --> 00:29:16,941
I just wanted to see Hollywood.

512
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:19,894
It m & apos; invited to the Four Seasons
for breakfast incl.

513
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,966
There was Zooey Deschanel.

514
00:29:22,004 --> 00:29:25,572
And Sally Draper, the girl from Mad Men.
C & apos; was awesome.

515
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:28,026
You have a family?

516
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:30,059
In Florida.
C & apos;'s where I come from.

517
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:33,395
Agatha...

518
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,078
We can talk about burns?

519
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,560
I worked in a planetarium.

520
00:29:44,022 --> 00:29:45,479
J & apos; was 12.

521
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,205
There was a short circuit

522
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,813
and I stayed at the & apos; inside...

523
00:29:49,851 --> 00:29:51,386
like a bitch.

524
00:29:57,215 --> 00:29:59,478
This & apos;'s not a very glamorous job.

525
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,935
I don & apos;'ve ever known glamor.

526
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:04,542
Basically, the job would

527
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,534
of shopping and & apos; fix the small stuff.

528
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:11,331
Miss Segrand  I'll be the most loyal, most skilled

529
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,285
and the best personal assistant
imaginable.

530
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,934
You have a car?

531
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:18,505
You know how to drive?

532
00:30:18,772 --> 00:30:20,767
J & apos; have a license in Florida.

533
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,717

535
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:31,545
Carrie is funny.

536
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:34,345
She knew that & apos; were to be seen.

537
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:38,757
You know how my mother died?

538
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:43,052
In a fire.

539
00:30:57,474 --> 00:30:59,316
I think you're beautiful.

540
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,765
And you know who you look like?

541
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:05,684
At & apos; inside?

542
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:09,826
Segrand Havana.

543
00:31:14,965 --> 00:31:17,114

00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:20,489
A tower & apos; Hollywood. Cash call.

545
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,238
On my notebooks & apos;
schoolboy on my desk and trees

546
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,731
On the sand snow

547
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:48,337
On any given flesh
On the front of my friends

548
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:51,290
On each hand reaching
J & apos; put your name

549
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,592
Freedom

550
00:31:57,657 --> 00:31:58,808
You survived a fire?

551
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,183
I don & apos;'ve never known what m & apos; happened.

552
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:05,213
I think j & apos;
was gone and I fell asleep.

553
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,735
What will you do in Hollywood?

554
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:15,838
Your money will s & apos; fly,
if you ride in a limo...

555
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:16,989
Actually, I & apos; got a job.

556
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:18,791
Really? Where?

557
00:32:19,368 --> 00:32:20,403
You know Segrand Havana?

558
00:32:20,978 --> 00:32:22,206
By reputation, yes.

559
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:24,584
I am his personal assistant.

560
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:27,345
C & apos; Carrie Fisher is the connection?

561
00:32:27,844 --> 00:32:28,726
Well yes...

562
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:32,217
Havana lent me a car.

563
00:32:36,628 --> 00:32:38,162
You want that & apos; have dinner together?

564
00:32:42,534 --> 00:32:43,840
Not this weekend.

565
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:45,105

566
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:47,061
scénar my work.

J & apos; have a great idea © e movie.
Could & apos; Ã © write together.

568
00:32:50,474 --> 00:32:53,275
The theme of & apos; incest. But
c & apos;'s a bit overrated.

569
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:55,154
L & apos; sexual abuse: the new religion!

570
00:32:55,193 --> 00:32:58,491
In fact, my parents were Ã ©
brother and sÂur. C & apos;'s a secret.

571
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:02,020

J & apos; would play.
With you, if you want.

574
00:33:08,502 --> 00:33:10,535
It would be pretentious pre ©

575
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:13,106
if we keep the side © mythological.

576
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,590
Ã  listen, Agatha...

577
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,271
I think you're crazy.

578
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:25,763
Yes. So what?

579
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:27,489
I mean...

580
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:30,213

, dating and seemed so Result © el!

586
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:18,236
Continue.

587
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:23,913
A girl that
j & apos; had known at the & apos; hospital.

588
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:27,249
He was sent © iPad,
but they said that & apos; Ã © it was dead.

589
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:33,310
She came in my room,
at home.

590
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:36,034
Ã  a m & apos; screwed up a sacred © e funk.

591

J & apos; perhaps have dreamed ©.

592
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:42,209
Do I get mad?

593
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:44,588
Not.

594
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:50,800
The time has come to confront you at certain things.

595
00:34:51,914 --> 00:34:52,795
My sÂur?

596
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:54,292
Yes.

597
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:00,543
She always wanted that & apos; they marry.

598
00:35:00,582 --> 00:35:02,269
C & apos; Ã © was his game

599
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:04,341
It was the cÃ © © Result ceremony..

600
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,217
C & apos; Ã © is strange, right?

601
00:35:09,136 --> 00:35:11,590
You think I'm crazy,
like her?

602
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:13,892
Not.

603
00:35:15,272 --> 00:35:16,155
More...

604
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:20,336
be aware © Result sister.

605
00:35:23,712 --> 00:35:26,549
Mom and Dad had gone to a party.

606
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:29,196
I must have been six or seven years.

607
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,378
That night, when everything happened,

608
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,750
we did the wedding ceremony.

609
00:35:40,282 --> 00:35:43,657
It m & apos; gave so-called vitamins.

610
00:35:46,265 --> 00:35:50,254
I woke up & apos; hosto,
j & apos; got a wash & apos; stomach.

611
00:35:51,213 --> 00:35:55,355
Firefighters m & apos;
had taken and I & apos;'ve ever reviewed.

612
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,071
You asked your parents?

613
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:04,331
They never talk & apos; her.

614
00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:08,091
This girl & apos; hospital...

615
00:36:09,663 --> 00:36:11,810
Harriet, what should I do?

616
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:15,493
What should I do if it comes back?

617
00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:18,102
You  m & apos; call.

618
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:23,741
J & apos;'m afraid when I see it.

619
00:36:23,778 --> 00:36:27,001
She & apos; look real.
I do not want to be hospitalized.

620
00:36:27,346 --> 00:36:29,264
My career is already pretty crappy.

621
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:32,984
You have experienced trials,
as a child.

622
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,208
j & apos;
have a split personality?

623
00:36:35,247 --> 00:36:36,934
I do not see it.

624
00:36:37,893 --> 00:36:40,348
Qu & apos; do that & apos; she wants me,
this bitch?

625
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:43,878
When you went out of your hiding
and you have expressed your fear,

626
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,796
Mom & apos; not appreciate.

627
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:48,173
But that & apos; may appoint
there is treatment.

628
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:51,126
She wants  j & apos; fails.
I will not yield.

629
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:54,656
C & apos;'s my little Vana.

630
00:36:55,577 --> 00:36:56,880
Give him homage.

631
00:36:57,226 --> 00:36:59,988
The "divinity of & apos; Imago"
as & apos; called Jung.

632
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:02,595
For us, it & apos;'s "& apos; magical child."

633
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:04,705
And that child n & apos; not fail.

634
00:37:06,278 --> 00:37:07,544
Lie down.

635
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,880
J & apos;'ve hired a girl.

636
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,223
C & apos;'s crazy.

637
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:14,064
Why is this crazy?

638
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:16,098
She is disfigured.

639
00:37:18,092 --> 00:37:21,314
Following a fire,
has severe burns on his face.

640
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:23,539
D & apos; where does it come from?

641
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:25,150
From Florida.

642
00:37:25,878 --> 00:37:27,297
C & apos;'s crazy.

643
00:37:27,336 --> 00:37:29,215
Fre apos; showed up at my door.

644
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,471
J & apos;'ve & apos; impression that & apos; in & apos; engaging,
I found.

645
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:38,536
People & apos; not come into our lives by chance
. We are convened.

646
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:42,372
Two women associated with fire.

647
00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:46,246
I bet those visions
will disappear.

648
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:49,123
You really think so?

649
00:37:49,813 --> 00:37:52,076
You welcome mom home.

650
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:54,339
You tell her, "Mom,

651
00:37:54,992 --> 00:37:57,561
" between, you do not scare me.

652
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,943
"I'm invested.

653
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,052
" The soup is served.

654
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:03,008
"C & apos;'s my home, Mom

655
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,003
." I & apos;
have built on my affliction and my hopes.

656
00:38:05,387 --> 00:38:07,419
"And you can not hurt me.

657
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:10,680
" I am a magic child.
So between.

658
00:38:11,408 --> 00:38:13,710
"Mi casa es su casa."

659
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:16,319
Now take a deep breath.

660
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:18,851
Breathe!

661
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,475
If she comes here?

662
00:38:45,278 --> 00:38:45,967
She will not come.

663
00:38:46,314 --> 00:38:48,654
Qu & apos; do that & apos; she doing here?

664
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,070
From tourism, perhaps.

665
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:54,521
This & apos;'s not funny.

666
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:59,087
We have always responded differently,
you and me.

667
00:39:04,264 --> 00:39:05,607
It needs to get fired.

668
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,141
Next?

669
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:11,897
If it works for Havana,
we know where she is.

670
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:15,005
And it saves time.

671
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,241
And if she saw Benjie?

672
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:30,501
C & apos; tabloids is that m & apos; worried.

673
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,794
J & apos; my class have to do.

674
00:39:49,372 --> 00:39:50,830
On my notebooks & apos; schoolboy

675
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:52,825
On my desk and trees

676
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:54,627
On the sand snow

677
00:39:54,665 --> 00:39:55,663
J & apos; put your name

678
00:39:57,504 --> 00:40:00,995
On any given flesh
On the front of my friends

679
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:03,372
= = Son?

680
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,751
A second.

681
00:40:07,707 --> 00:40:08,781
Between.

682
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:13,154
J & apos;'ve seen the light.

683
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:16,068
I can not sleep.

684
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:18,984
Me either.

685
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:21,592
You were reading?

686
00:40:22,398 --> 00:40:23,971
A little, scénar.

687
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:26,426
C & apos;'s hard without a partner.

688
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,995
Mom gives me the Result © Plique.

689
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:32,907
But I & apos; like connaÃ®tre
the Result © Replicas & apos; first.

690
00:40:33,637 --> 00:40:35,478
C & apos;'s what makes you a pro.

691
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:42,996
I want to talk to you.

692
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,565
I take nothing.

693
00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:49,402
Even no Seroquel.
J & apos;'ve got a good sponsor.

694
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,009
It is clean and sober for twenty years.

695
00:40:52,393 --> 00:40:55,347
He had Robert Downey Jr, Demi Lovato...

696
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:56,152
No.

697
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:02,865
C & apos;'s your sÂur.

698
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,889
Perhaps that & apos; she has returned...

699
00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:10,344
in Los Angeles.

700
00:41:12,914 --> 00:41:13,912
She has called upon?

701
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,366
Not yet.

702
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:19,473
I thought she was in jail.

703
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:20,854
Ã  & apos; hospital...

704
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:22,849
very far & apos; here.

705
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:26,492
But it is free, white

706
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:28,180
and she is 18.
We had LIBA © rer.

707
00:41:29,062 --> 00:41:33,013
I nÃ © gocie measurement & apos; Ã © remoteness...

708
00:41:33,051 --> 00:41:34,969
A measure & apos; Ã © remoteness?

709
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:38,958
bad you & apos; hast not get in a
at birth.

710
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,413
You should have brought a judge
motherhood.

711
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:44,174
T & apos;'ve maybe tried.

712
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:47,014
We tried lots of things.

713
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:50,389
We mostly tried to do our best.

714
00:41:50,696 --> 00:41:51,808
C & apos;'s in your book.

715
00:41:52,882 --> 00:41:54,953
C & apos;'s your big thing.

716
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,986
"Do your best."

717
00:41:57,408 --> 00:41:59,786
C & apos;'s supposed to be positive.

718
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:05,156
I do not know anything about this girl.

719
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:08,685
If j & apos;'ve never known who she was...

720
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:10,565
I do not know if it is unsafe.

721
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,633
I knew this day would come.

722
00:42:14,286 --> 00:42:16,394
I thought that & apos; would it low profile.

723
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:19,195
C & apos; was silly.

724
00:42:20,345 --> 00:42:23,376
But I want you to tell me
if she tries to see you.

725
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:26,445
I'll tell you, if she goes.

726
00:42:26,483 --> 00:42:28,631
We like to share, remember...

727
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:38,450
some sleep, son.

728
00:42:56,517 --> 00:42:59,777
And by the power  & apos;
a word I start my life

729
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:02,577
I was born to know you

730
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:04,226
To name you

731
00:43:04,265 --> 00:43:05,339
Freedom

732
00:43:05,914 --> 00:43:07,756
Havana, darling...

733
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,054
I do not know not if you & apos;'ve read,

734
00:43:12,128 --> 00:43:15,043
but they announce that Damien chose Azita.

735
00:43:15,657 --> 00:43:18,265
This & apos; is hardly a surprise, but...

736
00:43:18,995 --> 00:43:21,909
I am furious with the method used.

737
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:24,977
It makes me lose face.

738
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:27,317
But C & apos;'s my problem, not yours.

739
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,312
I'm so sorry, darling.

740
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:31,844
Damien m & apos; called.

741
00:43:31,882 --> 00:43:34,413
C & apos;'s hard to say this on your answering machine...

742
00:43:34,451 --> 00:43:37,329
I did not want you & apos; may learn from another.

743
00:43:37,674 --> 00:43:41,662
I think you don & apos; got nothing to regret.

744
00:43:42,046 --> 00:43:44,156
I & apos;'ve always thought.

745
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:48,146
I know it & apos; was important to you.

746
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:52,748
But it must
that you put it behind you.

747
00:43:52,786 --> 00:43:54,820
So, onward!

748
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:58,963
I & apos; sends six scenarios.

749
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,992
There are plenty of awesome projects to
& apos; horizon.

750
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:04,486
Remind me when thou dost.

751
00:44:04,523 --> 00:44:05,827
I & apos; kisses.

752
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:08,896
L & apos; year will be tremendous!

753
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:41,999
J & apos; did a
hole that & apos; we can see everything.

754
00:44:42,037 --> 00:44:43,034
All to see?

755
00:44:43,073 --> 00:44:44,376
Money back.

756
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,138
I want to see her back zin.

757
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:50,475
Cut!

758
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,632
Mr zin will harvest all the laughs.

759
00:45:03,671 --> 00:45:05,511
There & apos; appears in four scenes.

760
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,005
And he steals all!
Small shit.

761
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:10,306
Call Genie.

762
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:13,030
I want that & apos;
it turns this little shit.

763
00:45:15,216 --> 00:45:16,327
Qu & apos; do you do here?

764
00:45:20,126 --> 00:45:22,236
I wanted to talk to you.
It can wait.

765
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:25,918
Even the studio and paranoid drugs?

766
00:45:25,955 --> 00:45:28,832
. Neither the studio nor his paranoid.

767
00:45:28,871 --> 00:45:30,290
One & apos; expected, Benjie!

768
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:32,285
K you put it!

769
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:35,469
I want to eat.

770
00:45:35,507 --> 00:45:39,304
My blood sugar drops when I turn with
Will zin shit.

771
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,551
You can put a burrito in the microwave?
Just two minutes.

772
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:02,817
It's okay?

773
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,502
Very well.

774
00:46:06,116 --> 00:46:08,417
I thought you worked your
scenario.

775
00:46:09,261 --> 00:46:11,831
J & apos; would.
J & apos;'ve got bills to pay.

776
00:46:12,905 --> 00:46:14,362
How's the show biz?

777
00:46:18,198 --> 00:46:18,965
It's okay.

778
00:46:19,387 --> 00:46:21,113
J & apos; got a call to Blue Matrix.

779
00:46:22,264 --> 00:46:22,993
You look?

780
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,946
I don & apos; not like soaps SF.

781
00:46:29,782 --> 00:46:32,773
C & apos;'s like Battlestar Galactica

782
00:46:32,812 --> 00:46:34,154
but post-September 11.

783
00:46:34,768 --> 00:46:38,374
I don & apos; think not!
J & apos; spent 18,000 dollars. Let's go!

784
00:46:38,412 --> 00:46:40,100
Havana, c & apos; is Jerome.

785
00:46:40,138 --> 00:46:40,790
Hi.

786
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:42,555
There is a driver.

787
00:46:42,977 --> 00:46:44,281
Awesome.

788
00:46:45,278 --> 00:46:48,193
It comes  & apos;
audition for Battlestar Galactica.

789
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,876
In fact, Blue Matrix.

790
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:54,407
I am one of your fans.

791
00:46:55,787 --> 00:46:56,901
Thank you.

792
00:46:58,166 --> 00:46:59,164
Good luck!

793
00:47:02,846 --> 00:47:03,613
My God!

794
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,224
Azita!

795
00:47:11,476 --> 00:47:14,008
Sydney m & apos; said you were here.

796
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:16,232
J & apos; going t & apos; call. Congratulations!

797
00:47:16,271 --> 00:47:18,150
Thank you. It m & apos; excites.

798
00:47:19,224 --> 00:47:20,528
You'll be sublime.

799
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:22,447
And you'll love work with Damien.

800
00:47:22,484 --> 00:47:24,057
It's so awesome.

801
00:47:26,397 --> 00:47:28,928
I feel so good.
And your mother was exceptional.

802
00:47:28,966 --> 00:47:30,961
It'll be a fun challenge for me.

803
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:32,726
This is not an imitation.

804
00:47:32,994 --> 00:47:34,682
You know who will play mother?

805
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:35,640
Anne.

806
00:47:37,328 --> 00:47:38,287
Hathaway.

807
00:47:39,822 --> 00:47:40,973
How are you?

808
00:47:42,047 --> 00:47:43,351
You love Anne.

809
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:45,154
You know her?
She's great.

810
00:47:45,805 --> 00:47:47,762
Empare up the character.

811
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,524
For a split second...

812
00:47:50,562 --> 00:47:52,710
j & apos;'ve thought © accept the role.
Crazy, right?

813
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:54,167
You should DA "...

814
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,162
J & apos; Ã © tais at the" tea © therapy at all costs. "

815
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,609
As cute!

816
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:04,217
You & apos; call...?

817
00:48:04,255 --> 00:48:06,941
C & apos; Micah.
Say hello at Havana.

818
00:48:06,979 --> 00:48:09,471
Micah... you're so cute.

819
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,313
C & apos; my timid.

820
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:14,113
He will break the cÂurs.

821
00:48:15,877 --> 00:48:18,677
- Happy T & apos; seeing.
- Me too.

822
00:48:21,209 --> 00:48:22,130
In 10 minutes?

823
00:48:48,174 --> 00:48:49,670
Thank you, Uma.

824
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,200
Been output.

825
00:49:04,438 --> 00:49:06,586
J & apos; love your new slave.

826
00:49:07,775 --> 00:49:09,846
C & apos;'s a horrible sentence, right?

827
00:49:10,652 --> 00:49:12,761
You have a lot in common.

828
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,947
This horrible type & apos; first.

829
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:18,898
"I'm invested, Mom.

830
00:49:18,937 --> 00:49:20,625
" The soup is served.

831
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:23,923
"I am a magic child
So between.

832
00:49:24,153 --> 00:49:25,802
" Mi casa es su casa. "

833
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:27,452
& apos; do you want?

834
00:49:27,989 --> 00:49:29,869
This bravado...

835
00:49:29,907 --> 00:49:32,361
C & apos;'s silly. Sorry.

836
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,203
C & apos; Only...

837
00:49:34,778 --> 00:49:36,772
I feel your touch nervous.

838
00:49:37,272 --> 00:49:40,378
C & apos;'s funny, but
j & apos;'ve lost & apos; used to people.

839
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:42,143
I do not want to hear it.

840
00:49:42,181 --> 00:49:45,250
These "incidents" of which you speak
in talk shows,

841
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:47,206
these are false memories.

842
00:49:47,245 --> 00:49:47,934
Liar!

843
00:49:47,973 --> 00:49:49,315
Since the first day.

844
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:53,650
C & apos;'s your stepfather t & apos;
did these things. J & apos; should have seen.

845
00:49:54,531 --> 00:49:57,525
His first wife
m & apos; said that & apos; he was like that.

846
00:49:58,483 --> 00:50:02,050
You had m ​​& apos; blame
not t & apos; having protected.

847
00:50:02,626 --> 00:50:04,121
Do m & apos; not approach.

848
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:11,370
You & apos; want it for that night.

849
00:50:12,522 --> 00:50:14,554
"C & apos;'s my home, Mom

850
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:18,045
." I & apos;
have built on my pain and my hopes

851
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,765
"and you can not hurt me."

852
00:50:28,939 --> 00:50:29,935


853
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,043
J & apos "Sorry ."; Was not & apos; ease.

854
00:50:34,768 --> 00:50:36,801
"I'm not terrible, as dyke."

855
00:50:54,407 --> 00:50:55,596
Are you okay?

856
00:50:56,364 --> 00:50:57,745
J & apos; have the flu.

857
00:50:58,742 --> 00:50:59,816
J & apos; I need cigarettes.

858
00:51:00,966 --> 00:51:02,539
American Spirit.

859
00:51:03,766 --> 00:51:05,876
Go get me some medicine.

860
00:51:05,915 --> 00:51:08,408
Ambien, Vicodin, Xanax

861
00:51:08,446 --> 00:51:11,131
... And Zoloft & apos; astragalus

862
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,624
and & apos; goldenseal.

863
00:51:14,468 --> 00:51:15,888
And Yogi tea.

864
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:17,883
Agatha...

865
00:51:18,227 --> 00:51:21,219
You know Stafford Weiss?
The therapist?

866
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:23,521
Not.

867
00:51:24,517 --> 00:51:25,860
Of course not.

868
00:51:25,899 --> 00:51:29,159
Why?
I repeat what I said a fucking corpse.

869
00:51:29,197 --> 00:51:30,539
J & apos; do need Tampax.

870
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:35,718
And the Cozy Shack.

871
00:51:35,756 --> 00:51:38,518
It is sold in trays,
as tapioca.

872
00:51:38,556 --> 00:51:39,823
A rice cake.

873
00:51:40,628 --> 00:51:43,466
And truffles Maison du Chocolat.

874
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:46,343
You'll find it all at Neiman.

875
00:51:47,378 --> 00:51:50,640
Come into the garden.
I have to move some plants.

876
00:51:59,308 --> 00:52:01,801
They are there since the earthquake.

877
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,450
I want to move here.

878
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:07,094
Do not care tiles,
we will redo.

879
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:08,667
They & apos; heavy air.

880
00:52:09,242 --> 00:52:12,348
Do not make me go
to the wicked mother. You are strong.

881
00:52:12,387 --> 00:52:15,801
You already have gloves.
Put all your weight & apos; effort.

882
00:52:17,949 --> 00:52:20,711
Do it rotate like that.
Do it rotate.

883
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:27,308
The door was open.

884
00:52:35,287 --> 00:52:36,053
What is going on?

885
00:52:36,668 --> 00:52:39,621
- This n & apos; has not yet gone to JT?
- What?

886
00:52:40,925 --> 00:52:43,764
The boy & apos;
Azita Wachtel died.

887
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,178
But I just see them!

888
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:50,361
He was with his father in Ojai
and s & apos; drowned.

889
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:52,010
My God! But how?

890
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:53,160
In the pool.

891
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,311
She & apos; was not there?

892
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:56,996
I do not know.
Nobody & apos; still has the details.

893
00:52:58,339 --> 00:53:01,408
But here's what we'll do.
I know, it & apos; horrible.

894
00:53:01,676 --> 00:53:03,402
You could replace it.

895
00:53:04,591 --> 00:53:05,435
But how?

896
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,199
Is Azita & apos; hospital.
She lost her head.

897
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:08,925
Under sedatives.

898
00:53:09,577 --> 00:53:13,030
- They can run without it.
- It will not resume work.

899
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:16,214
- They turned a lot?
- Just days.

900
00:53:16,252 --> 00:53:18,514
The cast m & apos; called three times.

901
00:53:18,553 --> 00:53:20,087
Sarah? You & apos;'ve remembered?

902
00:53:20,472 --> 00:53:21,967
Yes. They make an offer.

903
00:53:23,923 --> 00:53:25,189
Damien called?

904
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:27,529
No, but he must be devastated.

905
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:32,323
They will not & apos;
offers free & apos; approval of Damien.

906
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:35,201
Azita should.
It is expected to resume shooting.

907
00:53:35,584 --> 00:53:38,077
Go to  & apos;
funeral and resume the movie.

908
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:41,568
I know  c & apos; limit is,
but do you want the part?

909
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:43,601
I need to talk to Damien.

910
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:45,902
Good. But that comes & apos; happen.

911
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,050
I don & apos; was able to reach anyone.

912
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:52,692
It must be said that
s & apos; cated they are, we will win everything.

913
00:53:53,036 --> 00:53:54,609
At least that & apos; & apos they have someone, a d & apos; another.

914
00:53:55,184 --> 00:53:57,063
I & apos; calls I know.

915
00:53:59,058 --> 00:54:00,247
J & apos; send flowers?

916
00:54:01,398 --> 00:54:03,661
You don & apos;'re not supposed to know.

917
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,462
Guard flowers for Damien,
when you sign.

918
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:22,341
Come on, sing!

919
00:54:28,746 --> 00:54:31,049
C & apos; Micah is for breakfast!
For the miracle!

920
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:32,314
Who is Micah?

921
00:54:32,697 --> 00:54:36,188
Fire and & apos; water.
There is fire and he & apos; water.

922
00:54:36,226 --> 00:54:37,454
Adieu!

923
00:54:39,141 --> 00:54:40,330
Farewell, Micah!

924
00:54:41,482 --> 00:54:42,862
L & apos; fire and water. Say it.

925
00:54:56,595 --> 00:54:57,669
Excuse me.

926
00:54:58,052 --> 00:55:01,005
Looking Jerome Fontana.
There is a call for him.

927
00:55:01,043 --> 00:55:02,308
C & apos; Vorbalid is?

928
00:55:04,228 --> 00:55:05,492
Try to makeup.

929
00:55:16,808 --> 00:55:18,342
& apos; do you do here?

930
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:21,718
Havana is in the canteen.
I was looking for.

931
00:55:23,982 --> 00:55:25,899
C & apos;'s supposed to be a burn?

932
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:30,079
No, it & apos;'s a birthmark,
something.

933
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:37,827
There are 30 minutes.
Request for a makeup artist to remake you that.

934
00:55:45,998 --> 00:55:48,990
There was a tarp to the pool

935
00:55:49,028 --> 00:55:51,407
but the engine was being repaired.

936
00:55:53,286 --> 00:55:54,705
He could not swim.

937
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,352
The father heard the phone

938
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:00,766
and he thought c & apos; was Azita.
He ​​left a second...

939
00:56:00,804 --> 00:56:03,144
C & apos;'s always like that
it happens.

940
00:56:03,182 --> 00:56:06,135
I mean,
c & apos; is that & apos; we hear.

941
00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:11,390
You had Azita?

942
00:56:12,042 --> 00:56:14,229
Yes, I went to her house.

943
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:18,794
I said you would play the role.
It & apos; was relieved.

944
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,095
Finally, apparently.

945
00:56:22,476 --> 00:56:24,010
I do not feel at & apos; ease...

946
00:56:25,313 --> 00:56:28,497
Going to tell him that!
But we're close.

947
00:56:33,254 --> 00:56:34,749
J & apos; going t & apos; call

948
00:56:34,788 --> 00:56:37,013
to speak to you of my decision to take...

949
00:56:37,473 --> 00:56:39,199
Azita , but
c & apos; was such madness...

950
00:56:40,504 --> 00:56:43,763
J & apos;'ve understood, Damien.
I don & apos; have no problem with that.

951
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:45,605
Me, though.

952
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:48,252
I don & apos; not like this approach.

953
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:49,709
J & apos; had loved your reading.

954
00:56:50,093 --> 00:56:51,089
You know.

955
00:56:52,279 --> 00:56:55,424
J & apos;
had reservations about the relationship with your mother.

956
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,567
But the film I turn

957
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,981
is so different from the original script.

958
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,129
In fact, it doesn & apos; looks like any more.

959
00:57:06,202 --> 00:57:08,390
What the & apos; will reproach me.

960
00:57:08,427 --> 00:57:10,921
The script is amazing.

961
00:57:12,186 --> 00:57:13,261
Thank you.

962
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:17,825
I want you to feel strong,
despite the circumstances.

963
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:21,507
Nothing  & apos; happens by chance.

964
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,846
C & apos;'s what I think.

965
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:27,758
I'm glad you're here.

966
00:57:43,524 --> 00:57:46,323
Victoria Rabbit. Star Channel.
Are you ready?

967
00:57:47,398 --> 00:57:49,469
L & apos; interview was 16 hours.

968
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,732
Do you Genie & the apos; not say?

969
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,070
Can you give us 15 minutes?

970
00:57:56,335 --> 00:57:58,483
But we have been waiting for...

971
00:57:58,522 --> 00:58:02,319
Why not talk to my co-star Jim Carrey Jr?

972
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,739
Here!

973
00:58:03,777 --> 00:58:06,998
Hey, Mr. & apos; turd will zin,
you want to be on TV?

974
00:58:07,804 --> 00:58:08,418
Yeah.

975
00:58:09,108 --> 00:58:11,103
Bring your ass here.

976
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:18,697
Hello. I, c & apos; is Roy.

977
00:58:43,323 --> 00:58:43,975
Hey, Benjie!

978
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,465
Fuck! Get out!

979
00:58:47,504 --> 00:58:49,882
All is well.
I have come to ask forgiveness.

980
00:58:50,342 --> 00:58:51,225
How did you get in?

981
00:58:51,684 --> 00:58:54,868
I work for someone & apos;
a spinning here. Havana Segrand.

982
00:58:56,249 --> 00:58:57,745
You want me wrong, Agatha?

983
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:01,542
I mean you no harm.

984
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:03,652
You're my little brother.

985
00:59:04,035 --> 00:59:06,797
If you try, I'll kill you.
Do you understand?

986
00:59:12,819 --> 00:59:15,082
Are you hungry? A burrito?

987
00:59:15,466 --> 00:59:16,655
I leave immediately.

988
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:20,184
Havana Segrand...

989
00:59:22,447 --> 00:59:23,943
C & apos; not bullshit?

990
00:59:28,354 --> 00:59:31,193
It's really good.
We have the same agent.

991
00:59:33,072 --> 00:59:35,872
How thou art come
to work for it?

992
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,132
For & apos; intermediate & apos; friend.
Carrie Fisher.

993
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:42,163
For a disfigured schizo,

994
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,157
you're doing pretty well here.

995
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:48,952
They know you're there.

996
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:50,985
How?

997
00:59:51,637 --> 00:59:54,897
Dad knows and sees everything,
if you forgot.

998
00:59:54,935 --> 00:59:56,739
Watch out, & apos; elsewhere.

999
00:59:56,776 --> 00:59:59,883
The old T & apos; stuck
a prescription & apos; distance.

1000
01:00:00,957 --> 01:00:03,221
Do not tell her you m & apos; sawest.

1001
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,355
I'm not addicted to
"tour page"

1002
01:00:10,393 --> 01:00:14,037
So if you are looking for a revelation
easier your life...

1003
01:00:14,075 --> 01:00:16,914
It's been years since I t & apos; writing.

1004
01:00:19,177 --> 01:00:20,251
To explain.

1005
01:00:26,771 --> 01:00:28,421
Benjie, c & apos; Berg is Jeb.

1006
01:00:31,106 --> 01:00:31,950
I take a nap.

1007
01:00:32,411 --> 01:00:33,906
It is there.

1008
01:00:33,944 --> 01:00:36,553
I'm with my nieces
Connecticut...

1009
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,775
We at Universal.
Just leave them in the train!

1010
01:00:44,915 --> 01:00:45,988
T & apos;'re so mean!

1011
01:00:46,334 --> 01:00:48,598
I kiss later.
You want a Cobalt?

1012
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,592
Not. Sugar makes me mad.

1013
01:00:53,545 --> 01:00:54,312
Very funny!

1014
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,567
So, Mom and Dad t & apos;
have sent in crazy?

1015
01:01:00,488 --> 01:01:01,600
The judges, anyway.

1016
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:04,860
You & apos; look well.

1017
01:01:06,126 --> 01:01:09,694
J & apos; was among burn victims
and after my transplant, Florida.

1018
01:01:10,231 --> 01:01:12,838
The homeland of Scarface, Tony Montana.
Super.

1019
01:01:18,361 --> 01:01:19,973
C & apos; was you who brought it?

1020
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:22,735
C & apos;'s mother & apos; Havana.

1021
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,760
C & apos; was you who set the fire?

1022
01:01:30,866 --> 01:01:32,056
C & apos;'s hard.

1023
01:01:32,593 --> 01:01:34,357
No shit... C & apos; are you?

1024
01:01:37,579 --> 01:01:39,804
I did not want to hurt you.

1025
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:43,947
You know, for them? Who we are? They'll
& apos; say?

1026
01:01:43,984 --> 01:01:46,209
Pills, vitamins?

1027
01:01:46,593 --> 01:01:48,434
Probably sleeping pills.

1028
01:01:49,431 --> 01:01:53,153
So you m & apos; gave pills
and you damn fire to the house?

1029
01:01:53,765 --> 01:01:56,374
J & apos;'m having a little trouble believing
that you would not hurt me.

1030
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:57,602
I was seeing things.

1031
01:01:58,139 --> 01:01:59,941
- Like what?
- Children.

1032
01:02:03,892 --> 01:02:06,500
What were you doing when you saw them?

1033
01:02:08,534 --> 01:02:09,991
I said to them:

1034
01:02:10,029 --> 01:02:12,484
"With this ring, you m & apos;'re dedicated."

1035
01:02:13,827 --> 01:02:16,396
I remember. C & apos; was our game

1036
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:18,352
It worked every time..

1037
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:20,538
I said and they disappeared.

1038
01:02:25,832 --> 01:02:27,558
You should go now.

1039
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,503
There ACS © nario.

1040
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:37,685
You are part of & apos; very beautiful SCA © nario mythological.

1041
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:39,718
Oh, my God!

1042

My sÂur psychopath will
pitcher ACS © nario me!

1043

Agatha, Will & apos; into.

1044
01:02:49,729 --> 01:02:51,646
And rebuke this DVD.

1045
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:56,787
Do & apos; inquiÃ¨te not
I'm not a pyromaniac.

1046
01:02:59,088 --> 01:03:01,044
They coupe © pilot.

1047
01:03:04,151 --> 01:03:05,878
Work your program, Milton.

1048
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:08,370
No hassles in bed

1049
01:03:08,408 --> 01:03:10,786
The bed is for sleeping, do
& apos; love

1050
01:03:10,825 --> 01:03:12,397
but not to compete.

1051
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:13,740
Thank you.

1052
01:03:15,735 --> 01:03:16,962
See you Tuesday.

1053
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:30,924
Is that & apos; she's there?

1054
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:50,333
Hi, Agatha.

1055
01:03:52,673 --> 01:03:55,127
My books. Thou hast read?

1056
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:56,700
Yes.

1057
01:03:58,158 --> 01:03:59,654
Secrets kill.

1058
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:01,917
A classic.

1059
01:04:02,723 --> 01:04:03,796
How do you m & apos;'ve found © e?

1060
01:04:04,103 --> 01:04:05,867
No & apos; examination, s & apos; he should flashplaygames.net you.

1061
01:04:05,906 --> 01:04:07,824
- Benjie...
- M & apos; said where you Ã © tais?

1062
01:04:08,438 --> 01:04:10,777
How would he know?
Did you go see Benjie?

1063
01:04:11,391 --> 01:04:12,887
What a bad idea!

1064
01:04:13,807 --> 01:04:15,035
C & apos; was dangerous.

1065
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,793
But the question remains:

1066
01:04:20,021 --> 01:04:21,594
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

1067
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:24,854
I am recovering.

1068
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:27,807
I wanted to make amends.

1069
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:31,183
Nobody & apos; escapes the 12 Steps...

1070
01:04:36,093 --> 01:04:37,321
Why & apos; not you come?

1071
01:04:38,049 --> 01:04:39,852
C & apos;'s a question of victim.

1072
01:04:40,389 --> 01:04:43,841
Like, "I t & apos;
have never promised a rose garden."

1073
01:04:44,686 --> 01:04:46,027
You know why.

1074
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:48,903
I do not reward a murderous behavior.

1075
01:04:49,211 --> 01:04:50,630
J & apos;'ve changed.

1076
01:04:51,781 --> 01:04:53,430
I wanted to tell you how...

1077
01:04:53,468 --> 01:04:55,808
I'm sorry for what I & apos; did.

1078
01:04:55,847 --> 01:04:58,455
I wanted to tell you both.
J & apos; wrote.

1079
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:00,564
Apology accepted.

1080
01:05:01,524 --> 01:05:02,828
You need & apos; money?

1081
01:05:04,516 --> 01:05:05,973
No, I & apos; have a job.

1082
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:08,926
I work for  Segrand Havana. She
m & apos; told you.

1083
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:12,072
Here. Here 10,000 dollars.

1084
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:14,911
I want you to take a plane.

1085
01:05:14,948 --> 01:05:16,444
Our lives are rich.

1086
01:05:16,482 --> 01:05:18,861
We have built on your ashes.

1087
01:05:19,858 --> 01:05:21,508
Resigns from home Segrand.

1088
01:05:23,272 --> 01:05:24,270
Daddy.

1089
01:05:26,149 --> 01:05:27,223
I & apos; please.

1090
01:05:28,335 --> 01:05:31,403
N & apos; not even try to see
Benjie or Cristina. Do you understand?

1091
01:05:32,746 --> 01:05:36,774
You don & apos; did not believe that I & apos;
refoutre'd let you in my life & apos; air?

1092
01:05:37,925 --> 01:05:39,458
Take your skin cream,

1093
01:05:39,995 --> 01:05:43,563
your meds and your bags
cardboard and put them by the door.

1094
01:05:48,626 --> 01:05:50,160
And your program is working.

1095
01:05:59,903 --> 01:06:00,861
Good.

1096
01:06:01,361 --> 01:06:03,124
C & apos;'s over, Benjie.
At Friday.

1097
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:05,464
D & apos; agreement. Thank you, Rusty.

1098
01:06:21,766 --> 01:06:23,454
Qu & apos; do you do here?

1099
01:06:26,446 --> 01:06:28,326
Qu & apos; do
you doing in my pool?

1100
01:06:29,093 --> 01:06:30,051
Who are you?

1101
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,088
Micah.

1102
01:06:33,849 --> 01:06:35,344
C & apos; is a little drowned.

1103
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:38,145
I do not want to see.

1104
01:06:39,142 --> 01:06:40,868
I t & apos; do anything.

1105
01:06:42,595 --> 01:06:45,356
His father thinks that & apos; he could keep him from drowning.

1106
01:06:46,008 --> 01:06:47,888
Fathers think like that.

1107
01:06:47,926 --> 01:06:49,422
I will do nothing.

1108
01:06:50,725 --> 01:06:52,950
Go play with someone & apos, a & apos; another.

1109
01:06:53,756 --> 01:06:55,406
I live, asshole.

1110
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:57,515
I'm alive and I'm not crazy.

1111
01:07:11,478 --> 01:07:12,820
I know a man

1112
01:07:12,858 --> 01:07:16,733
who lives under  & apos;
sword of Damocles we call AIDS.

1113
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:19,724
"When my time comes,"
m & apos;

1114
01:07:20,146 --> 01:07:21,450
. "I'll be ready

1115
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:24,979
." Has he said,  My bags are packed, the
threshold "

1116
01:07:25,363 --> 01:07:27,243
J & apos; like it J & apos; really like

1117
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:45,528
Say

1118
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:52,932
Freedom: "We have to stop."

1119
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:58,340
"You're a woman....
I would like t & apos; help "

1120
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,283
" You do not think that I & apos;.
Have triggered these lights, b & apos; not it? "

1121
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:08,811
Say: "No & apos; was not your intention
You need & apos; help, c & apos;'s all.".

1122
01:09:13,491 --> 01:09:14,987
You do not want m & apos; help?

1123
01:09:19,129 --> 01:09:20,817
N & apos; not remove my socks.

1124
01:09:20,855 --> 01:09:24,807
J & apos;
have scars on my legs, stomach and back.

1125
01:09:35,776 --> 01:09:37,349
On my notebooks & apos; schoolboy

1126
01:09:37,387 --> 01:09:39,497
On my desk and trees

1127
01:09:39,536 --> 01:09:42,220
On the sand snow
J & apos; put your name

1128
01:09:42,451 --> 01:09:45,596
On any given flesh
On the front of my friends

1129
01:09:45,634 --> 01:09:48,435
On any hand reaching
J & apos; put your name

1130
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:22,226
Your mother, of course, was
Clarice Taggart

1131
01:10:22,266 --> 01:10:23,531
wonderful actress

1132
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:25,909
died in a fire in the 70

1133
01:10:25,947 --> 01:10:26,945
Christmas .

1134
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,129
You spoke of his addictions

1135
01:10:30,167 --> 01:10:33,888
and revealed, with great courage,
I must say,

1136
01:10:33,926 --> 01:10:36,458
that & apos; she abused you physically.

1137
01:10:36,496 --> 01:10:37,839
And sexually, yes.

1138
01:10:37,877 --> 01:10:41,750
What is rare. D & apos; usual
c & apos;'s father or stepfather.

1139
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:43,553
And we'll talk about it,
but d & apos; First

1140
01:10:44,704 --> 01:10:47,505
j & apos; have a burning question:

1141
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,422
Qu & apos; does it feel

1142
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:53,603
turn in the remake
Stolen Waters

1143
01:10:53,872 --> 01:10:56,480
and play precisely the role of your mother?

1144
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:58,207
Scary.

1145
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:01,543
You say all that & apos; we will become his mother,

1146
01:11:01,582 --> 01:11:03,691
but then c & apos;'s a bit extreme.

1147
01:11:04,267 --> 01:11:05,571
She was even named...

1148
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:09,713
For an Oscar, yes. But it n
& apos; had that & apos; Golden Globe.

1149
01:11:09,752 --> 01:11:12,552
I also feel good

1150
01:11:12,589 --> 01:11:14,047
as possible.

1151
01:11:14,085 --> 01:11:17,269
And we have the opportunity
& apos; having Damien Javitz.

1152
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:19,302
Agatha, can you come here?

1153
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:22,524
Who did rather strange films.
Really strange.

1154
01:11:26,781 --> 01:11:30,349
Do not be shy.
The Vicodin m & apos; totally constipated.

1155
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:33,725
I want you to go get me a laxative
: Happy Moment.

1156
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:38,250
They should & apos;
call Unhappy Moment.

1157
01:11:38,482 --> 01:11:41,319
I'm going to need you tonight.
Maria is taken.

1158
01:11:41,358 --> 01:11:44,388
One of his brats 1000
has nabbed cholera...

1159
01:11:45,883 --> 01:11:47,188
What should I do?

1160
01:11:47,226 --> 01:11:48,530
Tips for cooking.

1161
01:11:49,259 --> 01:11:52,635
Fill glasses.
Maybe use a little table.

1162
01:11:52,673 --> 01:11:54,859
It & apos; entertain.
A lot of interesting people.

1163
01:11:54,898 --> 01:11:56,470
It will serve you.

1164
01:11:58,312 --> 01:12:00,767
Fuck!
I will need an enema.

1165
01:12:01,955 --> 01:12:03,106
Wait a minute.

1166
01:12:03,144 --> 01:12:04,487
I wanted to ask you a question.

1167
01:12:06,597 --> 01:12:07,939
You see men?

1168
01:12:08,323 --> 01:12:09,627
Sometimes.

1169
01:12:10,509 --> 01:12:12,274
You see someone & apos; one right now?

1170
01:12:15,918 --> 01:12:17,529
I see that yes!

1171
01:12:17,797 --> 01:12:19,293
Just a little.

1172
01:12:19,983 --> 01:12:21,019
What does he do?

1173
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:22,477
He is an actor.

1174
01:12:22,515 --> 01:12:26,120
These are the worst! Must play their
the mirror every morning.

1175
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:28,345
Not mine.

1176
01:12:28,383 --> 01:12:29,726
There is also a screenwriter.

1177
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:34,598
You look very appealing.
No false modesty.

1178
01:12:35,557 --> 01:12:37,130
You fuck?

1179
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,159
Can you tell me!

1180
01:12:41,157 --> 01:12:42,307
Up & apos; where did you go?

1181
01:12:42,844 --> 01:12:44,416
Just about everything.

1182
01:12:44,455 --> 01:12:45,759
You have orgasms?

1183
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:48,291
Go for it!

1184
01:12:48,713 --> 01:12:49,595
Is server?

1185
01:12:51,397 --> 01:12:53,737
He drives a limousine.
You & apos;'ve seen.

1186
01:12:55,502 --> 01:12:56,730
He's cute.

1187
01:12:57,803 --> 01:12:59,682
Drivers are tombeurs.

1188
01:13:01,754 --> 01:13:04,631
J & apos; just need yoghurt and cigarettes.

1189
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:06,932
And call the plumber.
L & apos; water is cold.

1190
01:13:08,045 --> 01:13:09,310
Damn, it stinks here!

1191
01:13:19,168 --> 01:13:20,433
Hey, pilot fish.

1192
01:13:20,473 --> 01:13:23,502
- You go out late for a schoolboy.
- Two days off.

1193
01:13:23,541 --> 01:13:25,113
Take a Shirley Temple.

1194
01:13:25,497 --> 01:13:27,108
Are you kidding, I & apos; hope.

1195
01:13:27,147 --> 01:13:28,796
Do m & apos; not call Shirley.

1196
01:13:29,255 --> 01:13:31,097
Benjie  Weiss, Gretchen Voss.

1197
01:13:33,322 --> 01:13:36,314
Want  m & apos; burst.
Do you have something?

1198
01:13:36,352 --> 01:13:38,155
- The T & apos producers emmerdent?
- They try.

1199
01:13:38,193 --> 01:13:40,034
But one thing at a time.

1200
01:13:42,144 --> 01:13:43,448
Where is... Kayla?

1201
01:13:44,177 --> 01:13:44,944
We & apos; buggers.

1202
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:48,282
C & apos;'s already done. After the union
sold him my shit.

1203
01:13:49,547 --> 01:13:51,964
- She & apos; has had his song.
- She & apos; was where?

1204
01:13:53,421 --> 01:13:55,608
- C & apos;'s a long story.
- Long and hard.

1205
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,062
And Sam?

1206
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:00,670
We'll soon find out,

1207
01:14:01,246 --> 01:14:02,435
at least I & apos; hope.

1208
01:14:03,432 --> 01:14:06,310
She had a crush on you and you
& apos;'ve thrown.

1209
01:14:06,347 --> 01:14:07,345
But no.

1210
01:14:09,915 --> 01:14:11,103
I know you cam.

1211
01:14:11,564 --> 01:14:13,980
I do not want you to lose your sobriety.

1212
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:18,660
You'll turn a result of Babysitters?

1213
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:22,649
Yes, they m & apos; made an offer
my mother n & apos; was denied.

1214
01:14:23,608 --> 01:14:24,605
It made so much money!

1215
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,020
I & apos; saw in Thrill Kill.
Cool.

1216
01:14:28,326 --> 01:14:30,973
A comedy & apos; horror.
Critics have understood.

1217
01:14:31,817 --> 01:14:34,769
If you want, I & apos; have some GHB.
It smashes.

1218
01:14:35,461 --> 01:14:36,994
I & apos; love you.

1219
01:14:38,184 --> 01:14:41,214
Well, Sam is on the way.
Contract respected.

1220
01:14:42,517 --> 01:14:43,938
The Terminator.

1221
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:45,932
At yours.

1222
01:14:53,642 --> 01:14:55,406
I & apos; bought on eBay.

1223
01:14:55,444 --> 01:14:57,976
It seems that & apos; he served
at Columbine massacre.

1224
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,535
Is responsible, man.

1225
01:15:04,995 --> 01:15:05,801
I'll empty it.

1226
01:15:05,839 --> 01:15:06,875
Do not fuck.

1227
01:15:09,292 --> 01:15:10,020
Benjie!

1228
01:15:12,628 --> 01:15:13,587
He is sick.

1229
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,697
If & apos; America knew!

1230
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:19,072
Rhett, completes the joke.
On the clodhopper.

1231
01:15:19,111 --> 01:15:21,182
Never mind that & apos;
one hour that & apos; she started.

1232
01:15:22,103 --> 01:15:24,251
The clodhopper told the yuppie...

1233
01:15:24,595 --> 01:15:27,281
- C & apos; What is a yuppie?
- Are you serious?

1234
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:31,423
I know what  c & apos; east.
But not what it means.

1235
01:15:31,462 --> 01:15:33,610
The clodhopper say yuppie:

1236
01:15:33,649 --> 01:15:36,065
"I know a place to go,

1237
01:15:36,103 --> 01:15:38,865
" we dance, we & apos s, y beats, we drink,

1238
01:15:38,903 --> 01:15:40,553
"and there fuck!"

1239
01:15:41,282 --> 01:15:43,084
This joke is safe sex?

1240
01:15:43,123 --> 01:15:45,002
It s  & apos; underway. It bareback.

1241
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,152
Come on, give it to me.

1242
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,873
J & apos;
asked if that joke was guaranteed safe sex.

1243
01:15:50,334 --> 01:15:52,060
J & apos; hope not.

1244
01:15:53,134 --> 01:15:54,016
Then I'll kill you.

1245
01:15:55,358 --> 01:15:57,161
It's starting to do well.

1246
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,082
The yuppie said:

1247
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:01,112
"Super
Do that & apos; there will & apos; other people.?"

1248
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:02,646
Then the clodhopper said:

1249
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:06,521
"No Who & apos; another
Just you and me.?."

1250
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:16,186
Fucker!

1251
01:16:16,416 --> 01:16:17,644
You & apos;'ve killed!

1252
01:16:18,564 --> 01:16:20,060
- Damn!
- It is crazy.

1253
01:16:21,287 --> 01:16:23,167
- Get out!
- Dude, I'm sorry.

1254
01:16:23,435 --> 01:16:26,312
J & apos; had removed all the bullets.

1255
01:16:29,803 --> 01:16:32,411
You killed my dog.
Species con.

1256
01:16:32,449 --> 01:16:33,792
Motherfucker of Barje,

1257
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:35,864
you killed my dog.
Bar up!

1258
01:16:42,843 --> 01:16:44,110
I come in?

1259
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:46,411
Bad idea.

1260
01:16:46,449 --> 01:16:48,022
I did not stay long.

1261
01:16:48,713 --> 01:16:50,631
I wanted to make amends.

1262
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:02,329
J & apos;
saw this house in magazines.

1263
01:17:04,402 --> 01:17:07,853
In Architectural Digest.
With the profile of dad.

1264
01:17:11,305 --> 01:17:13,376
I feel a bit exhibited,

1265
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:19,168
but Stafford likes personalize everything

1266
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:22,390
for that & apos;
we know how and where we live.

1267
01:17:29,717 --> 01:17:32,670
Do you want anything?

1268
01:17:33,207 --> 01:17:34,588
No, thank you.

1269
01:17:43,218 --> 01:17:44,944
Theoretically, j & apos;'ve stopped.

1270
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:49,471
I thought you'd come earlier.

1271
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:51,925
It'll be seven years.

1272
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:55,800
C & apos;'s time that & apos; he m & apos;
had to do my makeup.

1273
01:18:00,249 --> 01:18:02,435
Agatha, I did not go to see you...

1274
01:18:02,742 --> 01:18:04,545
J & apos; would have done the same.

1275
01:18:07,191 --> 01:18:08,534
J & apos; afraid.

1276
01:18:09,915 --> 01:18:11,488
Ã  because of what you did.

1277
01:18:11,526 --> 01:18:12,830
N & apos; explain anything.

1278
01:18:13,636 --> 01:18:16,013
J & apos;
©'m so dreamed of & apos; old house.

1279
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:19,773
C & apos;
is the first place that I & apos;'ve visited ©, at my return.

1280
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:24,145
- Nobody & apos; nothing bÃ ¢ ti.
- The land belongs to us forever.

1281
01:18:24,183 --> 01:18:27,214
I redo the same dream for a
Ã © © eternity.

1282
01:18:27,713 --> 01:18:30,168
Benjie and me
we get married out there,

1283
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:33,811
under a white canopy. J & apos;
when I get it & apos; knew for you and Dad.

1284
01:18:34,732 --> 01:18:36,113
Tu Ã © tais in Europe.

1285
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:39,526
J & apos;'ve found the © © trunk key.
All photos.

1286
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:43,516
We did not know that & apos; Ã © one brother and was sÂur.

1287
01:18:45,741 --> 01:18:48,388
We had been Ã © sÃ © © © s
Pará since childhood.

1288
01:18:50,918 --> 01:18:52,568
C & apos; Ã © was a monstrous thing.

1289
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:55,637
It s  & apos; © s is met on campus.

1290
01:18:58,129 --> 01:18:59,971
We did not know.

1291
01:19:01,774 --> 01:19:02,694
We did not know.

1292
01:19:13,396 --> 01:19:14,624
What are you doing here?

1293
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:16,579
Stafford, the n & apos; not.

1294
01:19:18,306 --> 01:19:19,763
I & apos; told to leave.

1295
01:19:21,872 --> 01:19:23,100
You did not know.

1296
01:19:24,251 --> 01:19:25,977
C & apos; was a monstrous thing.

1297
01:19:26,936 --> 01:19:28,316
J & apos;'ve found your diaries.

1298
01:19:29,315 --> 01:19:31,309
L & apos; love is stronger than death.

1299
01:19:37,292 --> 01:19:38,481
Dirty bitch!

1300
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,632
Stop!

1301
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:41,128
Daddy, no...

1302
01:19:44,005 --> 01:19:45,616
You're hurting him.

1303
01:19:55,129 --> 01:19:56,164
You gotta leave.

1304
01:19:56,663 --> 01:19:57,775
Do not hit!

1305
01:19:58,389 --> 01:19:59,615
Do not hit!

1306
01:20:00,345 --> 01:20:01,495
Dad...

1307
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,720
Leave me alone!

1308
01:20:27,693 --> 01:20:28,882
My ring.

1309
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:31,951
She took my alliance.

1310
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:34,982
My ring!

1311
01:20:58,265 --> 01:21:01,179
Inspection pee.
You're caught in the act!

1312
01:21:02,061 --> 01:21:05,092
You know you deserve a shouting match
sacred.

1313
01:21:06,281 --> 01:21:06,971
What does that mean?

1314
01:21:07,393 --> 01:21:08,927
You know what I mean...

1315
01:21:09,733 --> 01:21:10,845
Will zin my two!

1316
01:21:12,188 --> 01:21:13,607
Who is the star here?

1317
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:17,749
You can tell me, Roy?

1318
01:21:18,517 --> 01:21:19,552
C & apos;'s you!

1319
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:22,927
There & apos; not your enemy.

1320
01:21:24,078 --> 01:21:24,769
You...

1321
01:21:27,147 --> 01:21:29,601
L & apos; love is stronger than death.

1322
01:21:35,701 --> 01:21:37,926
You're a naughty babysitter, Benjamin.

1323
01:21:37,964 --> 01:21:39,268
Creve!

1324
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:42,452
You're a naughty babysitter.

1325
01:22:09,569 --> 01:22:10,721
Fuck!

1326
01:22:12,101 --> 01:22:13,060
Holy shit!

1327
01:22:21,192 --> 01:22:22,650
There should be a little groggy.

1328
01:22:28,097 --> 01:22:29,018
My baby.

1329
01:22:38,107 --> 01:22:39,642
I'm sorry, Mom.

1330
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,869
But why?

1331
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,630
Benjie, why did you do that?

1332
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:46,277
This & apos; was that & apos; small boy.

1333
01:22:48,656 --> 01:22:50,420
J & apos;'ve seen the girl...

1334
01:22:51,495 --> 01:22:53,373
Who, baby? Agatha?

1335
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:55,828
Agatha came to see you?

1336
01:22:55,867 --> 01:22:57,976
The girl. It m & apos; trapped.

1337
01:22:58,781 --> 01:23:00,125
What little girl?

1338
01:23:01,468 --> 01:23:03,692
That of & apos; hospital.
The one that died

1339
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:05,380
and I & apos; keep seeing.

1340
01:23:06,876 --> 01:23:08,102
My baby...

1341
01:23:14,815 --> 01:23:15,966
Must go home.

1342
01:23:16,734 --> 01:23:18,804
Must be that & apos; he left California.

1343
01:23:19,610 --> 01:23:22,027
Jonas must speak to the prosecutor.

1344
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:23,868
There & apos; only 13 years old!

1345
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:29,736
The violence of & apos;
aggression will play against him, Cristina.

1346
01:23:29,775 --> 01:23:32,230
There & apos; has robbed someone with a gun.

1347
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:34,032
He hurt one boy!

1348
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:36,832
Justice has become very hard
for minors.

1349
01:23:38,021 --> 01:23:39,172
They'll put him in jail?

1350
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:42,969
They will not put him in jail.

1351
01:23:48,186 --> 01:23:49,183
The kid n  & apos; nothing.

1352
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:50,717
Thank you God!

1353
01:23:52,098 --> 01:23:53,978
They stopped the series.

1354
01:23:55,014 --> 01:23:56,548
Will there be another casting?

1355
01:23:58,657 --> 01:24:00,997
But C & apos;'s a very small role.

1356
01:24:01,381 --> 01:24:04,833
Benjie. I speak of the role of Benjie.
It's all over.

1357
01:24:05,562 --> 01:24:06,520
C & apos;'re done!

1358
01:24:08,899 --> 01:24:11,775
Now the whole world will know.

1359
01:24:16,455 --> 01:24:19,064
The world will know that we have committed crimes.

1360
01:24:19,946 --> 01:24:22,553
You  m & apos; not want
& apos; appealing to you?

1361
01:24:23,437 --> 01:24:24,778
No, I & apos;'m happy.

1362
01:24:26,773 --> 01:24:29,112
My God. I feel bad.

1363
01:24:29,151 --> 01:24:31,070
I think j & apos;'ve bronchitis.

1364
01:24:31,759 --> 01:24:33,486
Your voice is more exciting.

1365
01:24:33,524 --> 01:24:34,635
Thank you.

1366
01:24:35,556 --> 01:24:36,899
And your story & apos; love?

1367
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,544
It can go. It works.

1368
01:24:43,305 --> 01:24:45,031
C & apos;'s all you have to say?

1369
01:24:45,836 --> 01:24:46,795
I do not understand.

1370
01:24:47,218 --> 01:24:49,250
Well, that stuff burns...

1371
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:52,395
This & apos; not a little unhealthy?

1372
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:55,157
From the kiss?

1373
01:24:58,686 --> 01:24:59,722
Not. Not really.

1374
01:25:02,331 --> 01:25:04,248
She removes her gloves?

1375
01:25:09,158 --> 01:25:11,344
Your friends do not think it's a little unhealthy
?

1376
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:13,953
Do your friends know her?

1377
01:25:15,832 --> 01:25:17,135
J & apos; started a...

1378
01:25:18,249 --> 01:25:19,399
a screenplay about it.

1379
01:25:22,468 --> 01:25:24,386
C & apos;'s research.

1380
01:25:26,035 --> 01:25:28,030
Everything is research,
to a certain level.

1381
01:25:34,089 --> 01:25:36,890
And I, you would be willing to fuck me for
"search"?

1382
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:43,373
I do not know.

1383
01:25:45,712 --> 01:25:46,901
How would we do?

1384
01:25:49,126 --> 01:25:50,354
You come to see me?

1385
01:25:52,539 --> 01:25:54,304
Look at what I do.

1386
01:25:56,414 --> 01:25:57,525
How do we kiss?

1387
01:25:59,022 --> 01:26:00,096
For behind?

1388
01:26:01,668 --> 01:26:03,281
If you want.

1389
01:26:04,008 --> 01:26:05,236
I want it.

1390
01:26:05,773 --> 01:26:07,346
That last long?

1391
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:08,804
Yes.

1392
01:26:10,836 --> 01:26:13,406
I am more beautiful that & apos; her?

1393
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,083
Yes.

1394
01:26:20,579 --> 01:26:23,264
And my skin?
Do that & apos; she is more beautiful?

1395
01:26:25,066 --> 01:26:26,063
Yes.

1396
01:26:27,253 --> 01:26:30,168
And my holes?
Do that & apos; are better, my holes?

1397
01:26:31,549 --> 01:26:33,122
You want to fuck my holes?

1398
01:26:33,581 --> 01:26:34,540
Yes.

1399
01:27:07,796 --> 01:27:09,292
Must j & apos; go.

1400
01:27:12,475 --> 01:27:15,698
And S & apos; you like him, do not go down.
Put yourself behind the wheel.

1401
01:27:37,599 --> 01:27:38,558
What & apos; happened?

1402
01:27:40,553 --> 01:27:41,589
J & apos; took the bus.

1403
01:27:42,893 --> 01:27:44,274
And the car?

1404
01:27:45,117 --> 01:27:46,000
It is broken.

1405
01:27:46,613 --> 01:27:48,148
That  t & apos; happened yesterday?

1406
01:27:49,222 --> 01:27:50,411
J & apos; was sick.

1407
01:27:50,449 --> 01:27:52,252
J & apos;'ve been sick this week.

1408
01:27:52,291 --> 01:27:55,858
But I get up at 5:00
and I work 14 hours a day.

1409
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:56,893
You're going wrong?

1410
01:27:58,619 --> 01:28:00,269
I think j & apos; have the flu.

1411
01:28:01,228 --> 01:28:04,219
You act strangely.
And you're dirty.

1412
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,135
Sorry.

1413
01:28:07,173 --> 01:28:09,819
And c & apos;
is too much to ask that & apos; send a text message?

1414
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,504
Sorry.

1415
01:28:12,543 --> 01:28:14,307
Stop repeating that!

1416
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:16,226
You know...

1417
01:28:16,685 --> 01:28:19,178
Maybe that & apos;
it's time to return to Florida.

1418
01:28:20,866 --> 01:28:23,321
Returns to Kansas, Dorothy!
C & apos; perfect.

1419
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,354
But you could move your ass.

1420
01:28:25,853 --> 01:28:27,770
Because it gives me the creeps.

1421
01:28:30,954 --> 01:28:33,563
You stink. You stink. Do you understand?

1422
01:28:34,675 --> 01:28:36,516
Go home take a bath.

1423
01:28:36,784 --> 01:28:37,590
I'm sorry.

1424
01:28:39,163 --> 01:28:40,007
Oh, my God!

1425
01:28:41,003 --> 01:28:42,039
But you're bleeding!

1426
01:28:43,113 --> 01:28:44,993
You do not put Tampax?

1427
01:28:45,031 --> 01:28:46,105
You are psychotic?

1428
01:28:46,527 --> 01:28:47,601
I'm sorry.

1429
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,710
I don & apos; do not believe...

1430
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:53,431
My assistant bled on my couch to 12,000 dollars!

1431
01:28:53,471 --> 01:28:55,503
Get out of my life

1432
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:56,961
dirty  degenerate!

1433
01:28:56,999 --> 01:28:58,226
I'll pay you.

1434
01:28:58,264 --> 01:28:59,837
Go to the kitchen

1435
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:02,100
seek Perrier and rubs.

1436
01:29:02,139 --> 01:29:03,673
Go on Google for the stain.

1437
01:29:03,711 --> 01:29:07,048
I & apos;'ve picked up in the street.
I t & apos;'ve not paid for it.

1438
01:29:07,854 --> 01:29:10,309
For you to have your period
on my couch!

1439
01:29:10,654 --> 01:29:12,495
Do you think Carrie Fisher...

1440
01:29:12,534 --> 01:29:15,908
Nicole Kidman or Halle Berry

1441
01:29:15,948 --> 01:29:17,750
employ dirty critters?

1442
01:29:17,788 --> 01:29:19,131
Wacky and misshapen?

1443
01:30:10,913 --> 01:30:11,834
Hi, Agatha!

1444
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:15,976
J & apos; ran away & apos; hosto

1445
01:30:16,436 --> 01:30:19,045
and told a carer

1446
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:20,810
I would give him 10,000 dollars.

1447
01:30:22,803 --> 01:30:24,645
Con Poor fan!

1448
01:30:30,436 --> 01:30:31,511
How  m & apos; did you find?

1449
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:33,736
You  m & apos; told work for it.

1450
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:37,264
I've been here.

1451
01:30:40,103 --> 01:30:41,637
Where is Havana?

1452
01:30:41,675 --> 01:30:43,287
She went to Canyon Ranch.

1453
01:30:43,324 --> 01:30:45,204
Damien gave him two days of rest.

1454
01:30:53,642 --> 01:30:55,100
I'm lost, Agatha.

1455
01:30:56,941 --> 01:30:59,242
I can not go anywhere.

1456
01:31:00,278 --> 01:31:03,769
Benjie, I want you to m & apos; listens.

1457
01:31:03,807 --> 01:31:06,032
's All over, you know?

1458
01:31:07,605 --> 01:31:09,292
C & apos; is that of Cristina.

1459
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:11,594
Go get that from Dad.
Can you?

1460
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:13,473
You can pick her up?

1461
01:31:16,618 --> 01:31:18,881
Let's keep it a secret
much as possible.

1462
01:31:18,921 --> 01:31:21,145
Nothing should spoil my class.

1463
01:31:21,605 --> 01:31:24,520
At worst, I go to Oprah.

1464
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,663
I confess
kind Lance Armstrong.

1465
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:31,616
It could generate a lot of money.

1466
01:31:33,725 --> 01:31:36,986
This Monday on GMA,
We launch to try.

1467
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:34,905
Cristina!

1468
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:15,142
Daddy?

1469
01:34:14,519 --> 01:34:16,436
I n  & apos;'ve never taken so much!

1470
01:34:24,453 --> 01:34:26,141
C & apos; Ã © was so brave of you

1471
01:34:27,368 --> 01:34:28,519
back out there.

1472
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:32,279
I & apos; just did
slide his finger.

1473
01:34:33,505 --> 01:34:34,925
As S & apos; he wanted me to take her.

1474
01:35:18,076 --> 01:35:19,533
We should start...

1475
01:35:21,413 --> 01:35:24,635
J & apos;'ve vÃ © cu thirteen Ã © been © s.

1476
01:35:26,592 --> 01:35:27,934
Not bad.

1477
01:35:36,909 --> 01:35:38,061

Like your Ã © lice...

1482
01:35:54,707 --> 01:35:55,704
With this ring...

cÂur.

You may kiss the bride © e.

1487
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:22,593
On & apos; lack no deposit © Sir

1488
01:36:25,047 --> 01:36:26,429
On the bare loneliness

1489
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:30,648
On the death marches
J & apos; Ã © yell your name

1490
01:36:33,486 --> 01:36:35,136
On Santa © back

1491
01:36:36,747 --> 01:36:38,703
The likelihood disappeared

1492
01:36:40,890 --> 01:36:43,805
On & apos; hope no memory
J & apos; put your name

1493
01:36:47,065 --> 01:36:48,676
And by the power & apos; short...

1494
01:36:50,593 --> 01:36:51,975
I start my life...

1495
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:56,041
I born to know you, you... To name
