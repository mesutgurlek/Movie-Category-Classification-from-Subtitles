00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,463
It's all legal and above board.

161
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,367
So, uh, what do you
think of Frank?

162
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,602
- Light me.
<i>- Um...</i>

163
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,371
<i>Fucking amazing, isn't he?
</i>Frank, you're on fire.

164
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:30,408
- <i>He lives all the way out there, man.</i>
- I'm on fire.

165
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,110
- <i>I'm on fire.</i>
- On the furthest corners.

166
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,613
Fuck, I wanna be Frank.

167
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:37,915
- Don?
- Yeah.

168
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,385
<i>The head.</i> It smells
like sausages.

169
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:43,323
<i>- He never takes it off.</i>
- Never?

170
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,924
- No, never.
- He sleeps in it?

171
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,328
- Yep.
- What about eating?

172
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,563
He sucks liquid food
through a straw

173
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,664
that he funnels up
under the neckline.

174
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,568
Occasionally solids,
but it's not encouraged.

175
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,504
- What kind of liquid food?
- Grownut.

176
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,207
- <i>It's like a supplement.</i>
- He must have a very bushy beard.

177
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,409
- Not necessarily.
- How does he clean his teeth?

178
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,414
Look, Jon, you're just
gonna have to go with this.

179
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,483
Okay.

180
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:14,452
Sorry, it's just...

181
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,288
- It's pretty crazy, isn't it?
- <i>No, I know, I know.</i>

182
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,289
I understand.
I understand.

183
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,458
But let me tell you something...

184
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,528
Frank, with all his issues,

185
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,633
is without a doubt the most
100%- sanest cat I've ever met.

186
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,236
Okay.

187
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,371
Me, on the other hand...

188
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:37,775
Well, you seem
pretty sane to me.

189
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,410
Yeah!

190
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,314
<i>But, no no,</i>

191
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:46,650
I spent a lot of time
in a psychiatric hospital.

192
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:49,655
<i>I was labeled
as severely mentally ill.</i>

193
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,724
I used to fuck mannequins.

194
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:56,848
- Right.
- It's a condition.

195
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,497
Here we go.

196
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,635
<i>Welcome to Ireland.</i>

197
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,021
<i>Please remember...</i>

198

<i>Wakey-wakey,
eggs and bakey.</i>

199
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,611
And everybody out.

200
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,315
Welcome to Vetno...

201
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:51,785
<i>Our new home.</i>

Don?

203
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,790
- Don!
- All right.

204
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:03,093

<i>- impulse response.
- Okay, people.</i>

206
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,496
- Excuse me.
- <i>Nana, Baraque...</i>

207
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:08,332
How long will we be
staying here for?

208
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,401
...rhythm section shall be
housed in here. Ah, bunks.

209
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:12,839
<i>It is.</i>

210
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,076
Frank. The master
bedroom for you.

211
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,079
Had it customized
for all your requirements.

212
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:24,515
These will be the
bathing accommodations.

213
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,616
We will have many
productive seasons here.

214
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:29,087
And, Clara, your living quarters.
Don!

215
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,756
<i>Nice panoramic view
of the lake here.</i>

216
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:34,915
And, Jon, you and I
are just through here.

217
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,567
- Don.
- Yeah, buddy?

218
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,635
Don, sorry, I, uh...
I actually told work

219
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:48,573
that I'd be back on Monday.
Uh, so I was just wondering...

220
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,408
Why the fuck would you do that?

221
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,510
Well, I thought it was
just a gig, you know.

222
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,879
So I've only brought one
pair of pants and a t-shirt.

223
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,582
This is where I'll be staying,
right here in the green trailer.

224
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,784
So if you need anything
at night... you know,

225
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,121
sugar, milk...
If you freak out,

226
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,797
you just come a-knocking.

227
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,934
Come on, chop chop.

228
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,807
- That's alpine cedar... nice.
- Don!

229
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,907
- Yeah?
- How long are we staying here?

230
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:28,165
Just as long as it takes
to record the album, Jon.

231

<i>"Vetno, Ireland.</i>

<i>No.</i>

Right?

All bumpy and holes.

00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:19,797
Don't get me started on lips.

317
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,966
- Like the edges of a very serious wound.
- <i>That's true!</i>

318
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:26,170
But your head is still
sort of intimidating.

319
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,750
Well, underneath I'm giving
you a welcoming smile.

320
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,243
Would it help if I said my
facial expressions out loud?

321
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:35,512
Well, maybe.

322
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:37,280
Welcoming smile.

323
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:38,787
<i>Frank?</i>

324
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,789
You've been up all night talking
to the keyboard player?

325
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,991
I'm not just a keyboard player.

326
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:50,528
I write songs too. <i>You
write your own songs?</i>

327
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,096
Mm-hmm.

328
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,998
I'd love to play some
for you sometime.

329
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,099
I'd really like that.

330
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,968
Big non-threatening grin.

331
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,869
- Delighted look.
- Here, play one now.

332
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,502
- <i>You're funny.</i>
- Play one now.

333
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,361
- Excellent.
- Um, not... not right now.

334
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,212
- Okay?
- No no.

335
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,253
- I'd love to hear one of your songs.
- I would too.

336
00:24:10,254 --> 00:24:12,249
- Go on.
- I... I don't think so, guys.

337
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,018
Please!

338
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,221
Hey, guys, Jon...
He writes his own music.

339
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,056
He's gonna play
some music for us.

340
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,157
I...
<i>Come on.</i>

341
00:24:21,158 --> 00:24:23,964
- Clara.
- Share your music with us, Jon.

342
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:28,598
- Um...
<i>- Play something!</i>

343
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,135
Okay.

344
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,339
But I haven't
warmed up my hands.

345
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:38,341
Um, okay, um...

346
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:41,313
That's just... that's
a warm-up.

347
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:44,216
Um...

348
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:47,427

00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:06,270

359
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,982
Oh no, I've got one.
I've got one.

360
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,051
There's one which is like, um...

361
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,627
That's yours.

<i>Better.</i>

<i>- Little bit.
- Why?</i>

been able to find my...

Core song-writing themes.

371
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:19,278
- You know?
- You can write a song about anything.

372
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,380
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

373
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,686
Hey. Like your socks here.

374
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:30,723
They're pretty original.

375
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,259
Hey, look at this.

376
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,060
This little tuft in the carpet.

<i>I wonder how old he is
in carpet years?</i>

00:26:40,331 --> 00:26:43,500
Is it spring? Mmm.

379
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,368
He's the first to wake?

380
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:47,972
Or... is he old,

381
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:51,040
<i>but still strong enough</i>

382
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:54,046

00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:32,016
That's amazing.

392
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,418
Flattered grin, followed
by a bashful half-smile.

393
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,154
No, people should
know about you.

394
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:39,559
You should be famous.

395
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,030
You understand.

396
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,263
- I understand what?
- Understand that there are

397
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:50,033
<i>people out there
that might like our music.</i>

398
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:52,202
Sometimes I think Clara

399
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,073
doesn't care if people
like us or not.

400
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:58,779
- Really?
- It's weird.

401
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:01,825
It's really weird.

402
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:34,411
- What is this?
- Potato.

403
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,180
And what is this?

404
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,584
Stew.

405
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,852
You should go home.

406
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,619
Frank picked me, okay?

407
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,778
So it's not up to you.

408
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,259
- Excuse me?
- He said I was cherishable,

409
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,096
and he picked me
to join the band.

410
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,632
You are fingers being told
which keys to push.

411
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,635
- I push my own keys.
- 10 little bits

412
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:01,437
of bone and skin.

413
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:04,241
And I'm perfectly capable
of going to my furthest corners

414
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,295
and composing music.

415
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,346
- Your furthest corners?
- My furthest corners.

416
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,386
Someone needs to punch you
in the face.

417
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,354
<i>Lips pursed together</i>

418
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,389
<i>as if to say
"enough frivolity."</i>

419
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,126
Today...

420
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,193
We begin work
on the album in earnest.

421
00:29:24,194 --> 00:29:26,195
<i>"Frank wants us to start</i>

422
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:28,664

423
00:29:28,665 --> 00:29:32,235
<i>"He's created an entirely
new musical notation system."</i>

<i>"We've designed
our own instruments."</i>

<i>"He has initiated

<i>of physical exercise."</i>

428
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:52,222
Oh, for fuck's sake!

429
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,357
<i>"Fortunately, we have
a safe word for when</i>

430
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:56,438
- <i>things get too intense."</i>
- Chinchilla, chinchilla!

431
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:58,427
<i>"Chinchilla."</i>

432
00:29:58,428 --> 00:30:00,497
Chinchilla, chinchilla!

433
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,900
<i>"It's incredible.</i>

434
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,435
<i>Frank finds inspiration
in everything."</i>

435
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:08,963
- I find this inspiring.
- <i>"How does he do this?</i>

436
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:11,708
<i>If I'm to grow as an artist,</i>

<I>I must see as he sees."</I>

438
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:17,115
We could make an entire album
out of this one sound.

439
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,250
<i>"I dedicate myself

453

<i>Hey, man, what are you doing?</i>

454
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:10,701
I'm composing a song.

Oh, right.

Yeah, man.
I know.

458
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,381
- What?
- I know what it feels like

459
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,750
to try and write a song
and it just comes out shit.

But look, Jon,

474
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,424
sooner or later you're
gonna get the feeling,

475
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,526
"why can't I be Frank?"

476
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,731
Or "maybe I can be Frank."

477
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,666
But, Jon, there can
only be one Frank.

478
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,668
One.

479
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:54,637
Actually, don,

480
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:57,406
I think both our songs
were excellent.

481
00:32:57,407 --> 00:32:59,608
Yeah.

482
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:02,346
Right? Come on,
let's go for a walk.

483
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:05,715
<i>Yeah, I've known
Frank was special</i>

484
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:07,550
<i>since the moment
I first saw him.</i>

485
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:10,686
This nurse was trying
to wrestle his head off.

486
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:13,490
I mean, the guy must
have weighed 300 lbs.

487
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:17,094
Frank was freaking out so
hard, he just backed off.

488
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,599
- A mental hospital?
- Mmm.

489
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:25,434
Have you ever seen him
without the head?

490
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:26,772
God, no.

491
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:31,107
Maybe he's facially disfigured,

492
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:35,548
forced to wear a mask
like the elephant man.

493
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,783
Hmm. All I know is that
he told me once

494
00:33:40,784 --> 00:33:43,653
he was from Kansas...
Bluff, Kansas.

495
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:46,459
Bluff, Kansas.
Sounds dark.

496
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,627
'Cuzzi?

497
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:52,561
Naw.

498
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:53,867
Get back to work.

499
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,501
Miserable childhood,
mental illness...

500
00:33:58,502 --> 00:34:00,136
Where do I find
that kind of inspiration?

501
00:34:00,137 --> 00:34:02,672
<i>Congratulations.</i>

502
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:04,808

towards releasing</i>

503
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,510
<i>your creativity in a way

504
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:09,713
<i>every aspect of your life.</i>

505
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,148
<i>Take everyday activities
like shaving.</i>

506
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:14,518
As Edward DE Bono once said,

507
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,521
how often does someone
using a traditional wet razor

508
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:21,491
<i>stop to consider whether
instead of moving the razor,</i>

509
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:25,695
<i>it might be easier
to keep the razor still</i>

510
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,867
<i>and simply move the face?</i>

511
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,945
What is that?

512
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,448
I think it's called
"the idiot shriek."

513
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,186
- Such pain.
- Hey.

514
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:52,823
- Such emptiness.
- Hey!

515
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,763
Shit!

516
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:09,975
What?!

517
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,778
Easy, don.

518
00:35:14,778 --> 00:35:16,579
Start again...

519
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,947
From the beginning.

520
00:35:17,948 --> 00:35:19,683
Patient smile.

521
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,784
Stop saying your facial
expressions out loud.

522
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:23,719
- It's extremely annoying.
<i>- Sorry.</i>

523
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,990
We've run out of time.

524
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,791
We've spent all
of our rent money

525
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:31,597
and the landlord gave us
30 days' notice to leave.

526
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,632
And we didn't leave,

527
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:40,004
so now they've rented vetno to
a family of holidaymakers...

528
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:42,975
Who are right over there.

529
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:46,909
Why didn't you tell us?

530
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,912
I didn't wanna disappoint you.

531
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,551
<i>- I know.</i>
- I can pay.

532
00:35:54,463 --> 00:35:56,253
- What?
- When my grandfather died,

533
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,753
I inherited money.

534
00:35:57,754 --> 00:35:59,855
He said it was my nest egg.

535
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:03,963
He said I should only ever spend my
nest egg on something really important.

536
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,864
I want you guys
to have my nest egg.

537
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,266
Oh, Jon.

538
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,602
Thank you.

539
00:36:12,602 --> 00:36:15,070
Oh, ginger bird.

540
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:17,742
It'll buy us enough time
to make the album.

541
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,551
Shit. What do
we do about them?

542
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:26,678
Fucking crazy lady.

543

Don?

642
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,310
We're done.

643
00:46:34,223 --> 00:46:36,696
Hop to it! Oh, shite!
Over here!

644
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:41,596
Frank!

645
00:46:41,597 --> 00:46:43,367
Get the rope off!

646
00:48:02,778 --> 00:48:04,716
Bye, don.

647
00:48:06,716 --> 00:48:09,085
You were the best
keyboard player we ever had.

648
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:12,621
The best man I ever knew.

649
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:14,593
Don used to be
the keyboard player?

650
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,427
First it was don,

651
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,997
then it was Lucas.

652
00:48:20,997 --> 00:48:22,383
Now it's you.

653
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:57,396
<i>Jon, what the fuck
are you doing?</i>

654
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:12,908
<i>It's what don would want.</i>

655
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:17,713
So you've been posting
videos of us online?

656
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,148
That's not the point.

657
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,916
Because of those clips

658
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,518
<i>we've been offered a really
fucking important gig.</i>

659
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,121
You've been spying on us.

660
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:27,758
South by southwest.

661
00:50:28,758 --> 00:50:31,159
In Texas.
It's very prestigious.

662
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,762
- They've got a new discoveries strand...
- That's ridiculous.

663
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:35,363
Come on, Frank.
Let's get you cleaned up.

664
00:50:35,364 --> 00:50:37,666
Why does it say
"two-three-

665
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,869
seven-five-one"
at the bottom?

666
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,704
That's the number of people
who've watched the clip.

667
00:50:42,705 --> 00:50:46,474
Two-three-
seven-five-one people

668
00:50:46,475 --> 00:50:48,443
are interested in us?

669
00:50:48,444 --> 00:50:49,844
<i>Come on, Frank.</i>

670
00:50:49,845 --> 00:50:52,480
It's like magic.

671
00:50:52,481 --> 00:50:55,617
I told you we could be big.

672
00:50:55,618 --> 00:50:58,487
<i>Can't see anything
in this fucking...</i>

673
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,623
<i>Ah!... fucking place.</i>

674
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,525
What game are you playing?

675
00:51:03,526 --> 00:51:06,561
Filling Frank's head
with these bullshit ideas.

676
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:08,984
I can't hear you over
the sound of the bubbles.

677
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,634
Fuck! How the fuck
do these fucking...

678
00:51:12,635 --> 00:51:14,770
You've just pressed
the full-bubble-strength button.

679
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,672
<i>They're on a timer.
You've just restarted.</i>

680
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,641
- <i>They... they won't stop...</i>
- Leave Frank alone.

681
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:21,610
I know you want me to end up
like don or Lucas,

682
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:23,646
but that's not gonna be
my role in this band.

683
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,847
You are a mediocre child.

684
00:51:25,848 --> 00:51:27,715
- Excuse me?!
- <i>You're an infection.</i>

685
00:51:27,716 --> 00:51:29,756
You're like Joseph...
You keep him locked up like...

686
00:51:29,757 --> 00:51:31,920
You're bindweed,
chickweed, pit tramp,

687
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:33,956
- abscess, absence, vacuum.
- ... Josef...

688
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:37,826
- What's his fucking name?!... Josef Fritzl!
- Middle management!

689
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:38,827
Cunt!

690
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:47,802
Oh, fucking hell!
Oh, fucking hell!

691
00:51:47,803 --> 00:51:49,938
Oh oh God!

692
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:51,974
Ow ow!

693
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,479
Ow ow ow, oh fuck!

694
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:56,787
I'm fucking dying.

695
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,721
This is gonna be awkward.

696
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,856
What is?

697
00:52:07,857 --> 00:52:10,759
Us, you know...

698
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,232
Together.

699
00:52:16,232 --> 00:52:17,903
We will never be together.

700
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,570
Oh.

701
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,271
<i>I find you...</i>

702
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:25,843
<i>Disgusting.</i>

703
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,277
Mmm.

704
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,048
- Disgusting!
- Yeah, okay.

705
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:33,752
I get the point.

706
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:37,522
<i>Clara.</i>

707
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:41,856
What does he look like?

708
00:52:41,857 --> 00:52:43,531
I don't know.

709
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:50,933
Was it awful in
the mental hospital, Clara?

710
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:54,737
- How should I know?
- I assumed you were mentally ill.

711
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,804
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

712
00:52:56,805 --> 00:52:58,606
Oh.

713
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:00,727
So why are you so against us
finding an audience then,

714
00:53:00,728 --> 00:53:02,781
if it's not because
you're mentally ill?

715
00:53:07,082 --> 00:53:10,289
You're in love with Frank.

716
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:15,757
You love him and you're scared
that if other people love him,

717
00:53:15,758 --> 00:53:18,561
- you'll lose him.
- And one day I'll take off my glasses,

718
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,031
and he'll really see me.

719
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:24,666
And we'll do big kisses.

720
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:26,571
<i>That's really how you think?</i>

721
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:30,466
Don't presume to tell me
how I think.

722
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,580
If you fuck everything up
in America,

723
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,756
I'll stab you.

724
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:01,737
It's just like
"Paris, Texas," isn't it?

725
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,873
It's definitely...

726
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,809
What you looking for?

727
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,111
Don.

728
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,631
Hey, don?

729
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:30,368
Hey, partner.

730
00:54:32,244 --> 00:54:34,402
I remember you saying
that the desert here

731
00:54:34,403 --> 00:54:37,107
was your favorite place
in the whole world...

732
00:54:38,107 --> 00:54:40,144
After SeaWorld, San Diego.

733
00:54:42,144 --> 00:54:44,413
I know you were homesick, don.

734
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,016
I know there were times

735
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,951
when you wanted
to come back here,

736
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,857
but you didn't because of me.

737
00:54:54,857 --> 00:54:57,093
Well, you're home now, don.

738
00:54:58,093 --> 00:55:00,195
I promise those
sacrifices you made

739
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,798
won't be in vain.

740
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:06,001
Jon has foretold of a night

741
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:10,739
some nights from now when,
thanks to a secret camera,

742
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,876
legions and multitudes

743
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:17,012
of already adoring fans
shall gather

744
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:19,715
and-and they shall
receive our music

745
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:24,853
- in rapture.
- Okay.

746
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,892
- Oh!
- It's grownut.

747
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,428
Frank, it's grownut.

748
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:39,937
<i>All right, don.</i>

749
00:55:41,937 --> 00:55:44,773
- <i>Let's feed the desert with you anyway.</i>
- Oh, don.

750
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:47,135
It's fucking grownut!

751
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:14,820
- Looking good!
- Don't touch me.

752
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,773
<i>- Awesome costume, guy.</i>
- Oh, thank you.

753
00:56:18,774 --> 00:56:21,976
Thank you. We're
playing the sunshine

754
00:56:21,977 --> 00:56:22,977
day after tomorrow.

755
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:27,149
Frank!

756
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:42,230
- Hello.
- Something tells me that

757
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:44,500
you guys are the Soronprfbs.

758
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,501
- That's us.
- You're Jon.

759
00:56:46,502 --> 00:56:49,938
- Yes, hi.
- So here are the festival passes.

760
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,974
And an information pack
and did Simone

761
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:54,344
pronounce your name right?

762
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,784
- Jon.
- No, the band's name.

763
00:56:57,312 --> 00:56:59,981
Oh, actually I don't know.

764
00:56:59,982 --> 00:57:02,518
Clara, how do we pronounce
the band's name?

765
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,521
<i>- Ask him.</i>
- Listen, are you guys hungry?

766
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:09,958
Uh, yeah.
- Because we were gonna go get something to eat.

767
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,994
It's the best pancake house
in town.

768
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,996
There's open Mike.
It's gonna be awesome.

769
00:57:14,997 --> 00:57:17,065
Awesome.
Awesome.

You guys have been

775
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,549
all this craziness has to be
kind of overwhelming, I guess.

776
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,951
No, we're cool
with that, you know.

777
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:39,855
I'm delighted to be
launching our album here.

778
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,289
Delighted look, you know.

779
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:44,159
<i>This is the most...</i>

780
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,927
Unique...

781
00:57:45,928 --> 00:57:48,230
And exciting opportunity
you've given us

782
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:52,934
<i>to finally play in front of people who
actually know and love us, you know.</i>

783
00:57:52,935 --> 00:57:55,369
Until now, our audiences
tend to be people who...

784
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:58,840
Who chance upon us,
and realize after a few minutes

785
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:01,108
- they don't like us.
- Frank!

786
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:03,612
Actually, I gotta tell you guys.
I mean, we know who you are.

787
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,533
Simone and me, we found you, but the
audience won't have heard of you yet.

788
00:58:06,534 --> 00:58:07,949
They do not know and love us.

789
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:11,085
But more than 23,700 people
watched us on YouTube.

790
00:58:11,086 --> 00:58:13,387
Oh, 23,000 hits
on YouTube is nothing.

791
00:58:13,388 --> 00:58:16,058
They do not know us. <i>Yeah,
those kind of views,</i>

792
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,893
maybe one or two people
in the room will know you.

793
00:58:18,894 --> 00:58:23,097
Maybe nobody. Half a million, that's
when you're onto something big.

794
00:58:23,098 --> 00:58:26,101
We fucked it up. Okay, but
they're cool though, right?

795
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:28,418
- I mean they'll like us.
- They'll love you.

gave me credit for.</i>

<i>I am ready to make
my mark on this band."</i>

810
00:59:11,013 --> 00:59:14,081
<i>So you want us
to change our sound?</i>

811
00:59:14,082 --> 00:59:17,251
Look, we've always demanded that
the audience stretch their corners

812
00:59:17,252 --> 00:59:19,420
all the way out to meet ours.

813
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:22,023
But what if, Frank...

814
00:59:22,024 --> 00:59:25,994
What if we pull our corners back

815
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:29,230
<i>a little bit?
Just a tiny tiny bit</i>

816
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:32,233
and then everyone's corners can
meet in a place that's still

817
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:35,673
a really long way off.
But it's just a bit less...

818
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:41,175
<i>You know?
And a bit more likeable.</i>

819
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:45,249
- But not in a bad way.
- I'm not playing the fucking ukulele.

820
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,084
Frank...

821
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:52,054
I'm writing my most
likeable song ever.

822
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:56,090
I've always dreamed that one day
I'd have a band member

823
00:59:56,091 --> 00:59:58,393
who shared my vision

824
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,721
of creating
extremely likeable music.

825
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:03,699
So thank you, Jon.

826
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,101
You gave me the
little push I needed.

827
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:09,237
- Yeah.
- Okay, enough chatter.

828
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:10,307
Here it is!

829

Yeah!

- People will love it.
- Actually...

846
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,353
Actually, Frank,

847
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:02,224
I think that we could
push the likeability

848
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,358
even further.

849

01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,766
Can I just...

852
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,336
Um, where did you start?

853
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:20,182
But what if... I don't know,
we regulate it a bit more?

854
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,815
I love it!

855
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,150
- Yeah? And then maybe, you know, um...
- I love it.

856
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:31,786
If we played an "F" down here,
that would be good, wouldn't it?

857
01:01:31,787 --> 01:01:35,257
<i>You should be famous!

858

859
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,134
I'm officially here.
Check me.

860
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,137
Hello.
Sorry.

861
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,378
Thanks.
- We're igniting the light and letting it shine.

862

- We're igniting the light and letting it...
- Hi.

864
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,478
Hey hi, can I get
a quick word with you?

865
01:01:57,479 --> 01:01:59,480
We were in the forest
like secret squirrels.

866
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:02,118
Now we're likeable.
We're... we're so...

867
01:02:03,819 --> 01:02:06,353
It's gonna be huge.
Jon fixed everything.

868
01:02:06,354 --> 01:02:08,389
- You gotta come see us tomorrow night.
- Great!

869
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,858
- I promise nothing bad'll happen to you.
- Thank you so much.

870
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:13,561
- Let's go take a walk.
- I'm incredibly happy to be here.

871
01:02:13,562 --> 01:02:15,396
- I'm fine, I'm relaxed!
- Great.

872
01:02:15,397 --> 01:02:17,766
You know, forgive me
for my problems formerly.

873
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,534
The people were liking it.
The weight.

874
01:02:20,535 --> 01:02:23,572
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm totally relaxed.

875
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,416
I'm... I'm fine,
I'm perfectly fine.

876

<i>Frank's not okay. What
are you talking about?</i>

877

I need your help
to get him out of here.

878
01:02:33,515 --> 01:02:36,384
He said he's perfectly fine,

879
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:38,887
- relaxed.
- I need your help to get him out of here.

880
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:43,125
He looks happy to me.

881
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,396
- <i>Whereas you seem...</i>
- I seem what?

882
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,865
...not in control.

883
01:03:09,618 --> 01:03:10,622
Frank?

884
01:03:13,622 --> 01:03:15,660
Frank?

885
01:03:23,581 --> 01:03:25,634
Have you seen a man
wearing a fake head?

886
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,369
No?

887
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,337
Sorry, have you seen a man
wearing a fake head?

888
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:30,905
- Yeah, a great big head?
- Yeah.

889
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:33,117
Yeah, he and a lady
went around the corner.

890
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:37,545
Frank, Frank!

891
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:39,515
Frank!

892
01:03:45,187 --> 01:03:47,721
Frank? <i>Oh, can you
feel my breath?</i>

893
01:03:47,722 --> 01:03:48,722
Frank.

894
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,262
What the fuck are you doing?

895
01:03:55,263 --> 01:03:58,333
Breathe, breathe.
It's okay, it's okay.

896
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,568
<i>Shh, it's okay.</i>

897
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:02,737
Do you want to come back
to the hotel, Frank?

898
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:06,209
It's warm there.

899
01:04:07,209 --> 01:04:09,210
Don't listen to her.

900
01:04:09,211 --> 01:04:10,545
She's the one who's nuts.

901
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:13,681
Not you. Tomorrow
night is everything

902
01:04:13,682 --> 01:04:17,351
we've worked for.
They're ready to love us.

903
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:18,563
<i>Can you feel my breath?</i>

904
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:22,292
They're ready
to love you, Frank.

905
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:25,659
Don't throw that away.

906
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:28,435
Frank, stay with me.

907
01:04:33,435 --> 01:04:34,441
Oh, thank God.

01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:54,688
Yes, Jon, I'm a little bit sad.

Oh no!

915
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,250
- Oh, she stabbed me in the fucking leg!
- Frank!

916
01:05:03,251 --> 01:05:05,433
- Get off me. Frank!
- Hey, put the knife down.

<i>He would have drowned Lucas
to take his place in the band.</i>

939
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:20,541
- No, I wouldn't have.
- 'Cause when he looks inside himself,

940
01:06:20,542 --> 01:06:23,078
<i>he can't find anything there.</i>

941

- Yes, I can!
- <i>So his only hope</i>

is to live off of your
talent like a tick.

943
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:29,650
- Sorry?
- Which is why he had to get rid of Clara.

944
01:06:29,651 --> 01:06:31,786
Clara chose to stab me.

945
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:33,822
We're not playing without Clara.

946
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,623
What are you talking about? We've
got the biggest gig of our lives

947

could not have come at a better time.

01:06:40,428 --> 01:06:43,465
Frank, I've had everyone at South
by southwest on the phone.

949
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,101
Baraque and I have packed our things.
We're leaving.

950
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:51,605
No, you can't leave.
We've had 767,328 hits.

951
01:06:51,606 --> 01:06:53,574
Frank, say something.

952
01:06:53,575 --> 01:06:57,848
- 767,918! They're all watching.
- Frank?

953
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:01,715
So many people.

954
01:07:01,716 --> 01:07:02,787
See?

955
01:07:05,787 --> 01:07:09,157
So many people.

956
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:10,727
Don't f... oh!

957
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:13,833
Good luck playing
tonight without a band.

958
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:17,535
I've got one word for you:

959
01:07:20,535 --> 01:07:22,137
Unplugged!

960
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:24,471
Me on guitar, you on vocals.

961
01:07:24,472 --> 01:07:28,410
Delegates really like it when bands
go unplugged... special thing.

962
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,913
<i>- How's your leg?
- Oh, it'll be okay.</i>

963
01:07:32,914 --> 01:07:34,916
<i>We set everything up
like you guys asked.</i>

964
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,037
- Are you sure you want to go ahead?
- Oh, absolutely.

965
01:07:37,038 --> 01:07:38,920
Igniting the light
and letting it shine.

966
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:41,456
Frank, are you okay?

967
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:44,893
Uh-huh! Ooh, if I was you
guys, I'd be so nervous.

968
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,529
Oh, it goes with the territory.

969
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:49,797
Yeah, but I mean playing
without your band

970
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:51,900
after what just happened?

971
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,168
<i>Shit, man, I would be nervous.</i>

972
01:07:54,169 --> 01:07:57,204
Well, it's not like we don't
know the songs or anything.

973
01:07:57,205 --> 01:08:00,641
With that many people,
I would be shitting myself.

974
01:08:00,642 --> 01:08:02,882
- Would you please shut your mouth?
- <i>I'm just saying...</i>

975
01:08:02,883 --> 01:08:04,936
Igniting the light
and letting it shine.

976
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:19,194
- Where are you going?
- To do my ablutions.

977
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:20,931
That's not the toilet.

978
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,669
Just... be as quick
as you can.

979
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:29,873
- 30 seconds!
- Frank.

980

Just wait here
for a few seconds, okay?

983
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:44,886
Mm-hmm.
Hey!

984
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:46,720

but we're still here

993
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:21,592

994
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:24,859

Frank.

1017
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,878
I know you weren't happy
with the music...

1018
01:11:23,878 --> 01:11:26,053
So let's work on it together.

1019
01:11:32,053 --> 01:11:34,188
Why not?

1020
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:36,430
You're not Clara.

1021

01:12:03,851 --> 01:12:05,720
Oh, excuse me for a second.

1025
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:06,854
- Fuck.
- It's all right.

1026
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,823
It's all right.
Here.

1027
01:12:09,824 --> 01:12:11,192
- Here.
- Just leave it.

Oh, you stink!

1029
01:12:18,066 --> 01:12:20,167
I made it.

1030
01:12:20,168 --> 01:12:22,837
Now will you use it?!

1031
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:38,788
Take it off.

1032
01:12:40,788 --> 01:12:43,026
The head.

<i>Maybe you should take it off.</i>

I mean...

1035
01:12:49,464 --> 01:12:52,065
In cognitive
behavioral therapy they say

face your fears.

1037
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,872
They say take the head off.

1038
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,842
So let's do it.

1039
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:04,814
- Let's take the fucking head off.
- I have a certificate!

I know you have a certificate.

1041

I know you've got
a motherfucking certificate!

1042
01:13:12,053 --> 01:13:14,188
Just take it off!

1043

01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:19,761

1052
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,890
That way.

1053
01:13:49,891 --> 01:13:51,681
<i>- Was he injured?
- He was limping.</i>

1054
01:13:54,529 --> 01:13:55,967
Did you see his face?

1055
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:08,542
<i>Yeah hello, you want
to report a missing person?</i>

1056
01:14:08,543 --> 01:14:10,315
- Yes.
- <i>Name?</i>

1057
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:16,953
- Frank.
- <i>Frank what?</i>

1058
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,556
Just Frank.

1059
01:14:21,556 --> 01:14:24,358
- <i>Age?</i>

1060

30 and...

1061
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,199
50?

1062
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:33,247
<i>And what does
this person look like?</i>

1063
01:14:56,925 --> 01:15:00,064
Driving me crazy,
but I know who you are.

1064
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:05,068
- Hmm?
- You're the chinchilla guy, right?

1065
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:08,069
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>Awesome!</i>

1066
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,238
And then, what, there's the
dude with the big head

1067
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:13,006
and the crazy chick...
Uh... Clara, right?

...chinchilla guy!

1072
01:15:21,949 --> 01:15:24,618
- Chinchilla guy.
- Oi, chinchilla guy!

1073
01:15:24,619 --> 01:15:28,655
See? I mean, all the footage...
You're all totally erratic and shit,

1078

1108
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,918
I should never have tried
to pull your head off.

1109
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:25,452
- I don't know...
- I'm the tree surgeon.

1110
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:28,189
I'm just... I'm just here
to look at the tree.

1111
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:29,401
<i>Can I help you?</i>

1112
01:20:46,373 --> 01:20:49,245
I've been very worried
about you.

1113
01:20:51,245 --> 01:20:52,877
I just wanted to find you to...

1114
01:20:54,548 --> 01:20:56,455
Make sure you're okay.

1115
01:21:01,455 --> 01:21:03,140
How are things without the head?

1116
01:21:16,337 --> 01:21:18,972
<i>He had such a beautiful face,</i>

1117
01:21:18,973 --> 01:21:20,444
lovely skin.

1118
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:24,011
The head was my fault.

1119
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:26,247
I made him his first one.

1120
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:28,015
He was 14.

1121
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:30,516
<i>Said it was for a costume party.</i>

1122
01:21:30,517 --> 01:21:34,790
<i>I did it even though I knew
there wasn't any costume party.</i>

1123
01:21:36,673 --> 01:21:39,726
It turns out the worst thing
to do with something like that

1124
01:21:39,727 --> 01:21:41,694
is to pander to it.

1125
01:21:41,695 --> 01:21:43,498
Who knew?

1126
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,446
<i>What happened to Frank?</i>

1127
01:21:59,446 --> 01:22:02,450
Something must have happened
to him to make him like that.

1128
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,551
Nothing happened to him.

1129
01:22:05,552 --> 01:22:08,354
He's got a mental illness.

1130
01:22:08,355 --> 01:22:11,662
The torment he went through
to make the great music.

1131
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,662
The torment didn't
make the music.

1132
01:22:15,663 --> 01:22:19,370
<i>He was always musical. If
anything, it slowed him down.</i>

1133
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,842
It was a good home.

1134
01:22:28,842 --> 01:22:30,646
It's just like my home.

1135
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:47,798
I have to go now, Frank.

1136
01:22:50,798 --> 01:22:52,498
You all right?

1137
01:22:52,499 --> 01:22:54,642
Yeah.

1138
01:23:01,642 --> 01:23:03,846
I know I ruined everything.

1139
01:23:05,846 --> 01:23:07,891
I'm sorry.

1140
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:19,426
It's good you're still playing.

1141
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:21,096
<i>I'm not.</i>

1142
01:23:22,096 --> 01:23:24,097

1143
01:23:24,098 --> 01:23:26,717
