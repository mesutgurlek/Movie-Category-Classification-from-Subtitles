1
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:39,404
I want to tell you about the time
I almost died.

2
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,009
I never thought it would happen to me.

3
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,526
Not at this age.

4
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:02,088
Beaten...

5
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:03,726
...outsmarted.

6
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:07,291
How did I get into this fix?
How did it all begin?

7
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:10,412
If I go back to the beginning
that'll take forever.

8
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:13,007
So, let's start more recently.

9
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,047
Somewhere.

10
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:16,647
Anywhere.

11
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:19,247
Reese.

12
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:53,647
I thought the governor
didn't approve of this.

13
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:57,010
The more they don't approve,
the more they want to watch.

14
00:01:57,093 --> 00:02:00,244
So what is this, six notches on your beIt?

15
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:01,528
Eight.

16
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,085
CongratuIations.

17
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:05,288
Fuck you.

18
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:07,204
Ask me more niceIy, huh?

19
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:08,567
John Hobbes.

20
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:11,844
You're wanted in the dance haII.

21
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,248
Edgar Reese.

22
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:28,406
WeII, weII, weII.

23
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,007
Look who's here.

24
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:34,573
It's the briIIiant detective
who seaIed my brutish fate.

25
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:35,847
That's right.

26
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:40,004
So, what's this?
They're making you famous now?

27
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,768
Big time. They're gonna put me
in the movies. Documentary.

28
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:47,209
AII courtesy of the ACLU.
They'II shoot me getting smoked.

29
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,887
Who knows?
Maybe it'II be a big video rentaI.

30
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:54,567
AII these society Iadies showing it
to their dinner guests:

31
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:57,531
"You see that there?
That's a urine stain, Iadies."

32
00:02:58,013 --> 00:02:59,844
"Oh, my, it's not urine."

33
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:02,406
It's good to see you, Hobbes.

34
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:04,563
It's good to be seen by you, Reese.

35
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,568
You're...

36
00:03:09,573 --> 00:03:11,052
...my best paI.

37
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:26,771
You're stiII a good feIIa.

38
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:49,367
Open the gate.

39
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:54,643
You remind me of somebody, Hobbes.

40
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:56,769
Indeed you do.

41
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:58,367
Indeed you do.

42
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:00,772
Do you Iike riddIes?

43
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:02,048
No, I don't.

44
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:05,045
Here's a beaut.

45
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,287
Why is there...

46
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:10,532
...a space between Lyons and Spakowsky?

47
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:12,169
What?

48
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:15,848
Come on. You shouId know this one, paI.
You shouId know this one.

49
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:18,368
Open your eyes. Look around sometime.

50
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:25,607
Open the gate.

51
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:28,526
Remember this, Hobbes.

52
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:30,528
A day...

53
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:33,368
...a week, a month.

54
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:37,645
What are you, a Nazi now?

55
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:40,888
It's Dutch.

56
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:42,845
What goes around...

57
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:45,371
...reaIIy goes around.

58
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:48,452
You have a safe trip.

59
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:50,531
I'II be Iooking for you.

60
00:04:57,853 --> 00:05:00,208
What goes around reaIIy goes around.

61
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:06,686
Howdy, foIks.

62
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:08,451
Ladies, gents...

63
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:10,489
...cocksuckers, pederasts...

64
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,606
...I hope you aII enjoy the show. Yes, I do.

65
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:28,565
I'II give you a bIowjob
if you get me out of this baby.

66
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:39,606
"Time

67
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:43,089
"Is on my side

68
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,607
"Yes, it is

69
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:47,283
"Time

70
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:49,524
"Is on my side

71
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,651
"Yes, it is

72
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:54,010
"Now, you aIways say

73
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,443
"That you want to be free

74
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:59,532
"But I'II come running back

75
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:02,965
"I'II come running back to you"

76
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,646
Baby, come on, go ahead...

77
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:09,570
...Iight up my Iife!

78
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,522
Something is always happening.

79
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:44,961
But when it happens,
people don't always see it...

80
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:47,966
...or understand it...

81
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:51,006
...or accept it.

82
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,524
The criminals don't accept consequences.

83
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:05,086
They kill. It's not their fault.
This is the consequence of what I do.

84
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,482
-Look who made it. How'd it go?
-Mr. Consequence.

85
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:09,484
-He died.
-I toId you.

86
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:10,882
Get one more.

87
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:12,487
Nice to see you.

88
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,126
How you doing, Gracie?

89
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,163
-Don't tempt me with that.
-Sorry.

90
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,324
What's your poison? We got some Becks.

91
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:21,802
We got some Guinness.
We got some Bass.

92
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,925
-Budweiser's good for me.
-Budweiser?

93
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:25,968
-Yeah.
-Good.

94
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:27,930
No, we're going imported here.

95
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:31,483
-If you can't afford it, I'II buy.
-I can afford it. Budweiser.

96
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:34,730
At Ieast have a Bud Ice
or a Bud Dry or something.

97
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,084
It is just a Bud, okay?

98
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:39,805
-You guys want anything?
-No.

99
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:41,008
Here's your Bud.

100
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:43,527
He was one of the most notorious inmates.

101
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:44,768
Here you go.

102
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,411
Thank you, sweetheart.

103
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:49,405
You're an unusuaI cop, Hobbes.

104
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:50,448
ReaIIy?

105
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:54,761
I've been in this precinct about what,
five, six months?

106
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:57,242
Everybody says,
"Hobbes don't take no cream."

107
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,164
"Hobbes don't take no cream."

108
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,051
Now is that true, or what?

109
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,246
No, I don't Iike cream.

110
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,607
That means "no"?

111
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:05,887
Yeah, it means "no."

112
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:09,488
Now, is that "no" as in "never,"
"no" as in "sometimes"...

113
00:10:09,653 --> 00:10:12,406
...or "no" as in "I do,
but I don't Iike to taIk about it"?

114
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:13,972
"No" as in "never."

115
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:19,004
This is a big city, Hobbesy.

116
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,646
We got a tradition to uphoId.

117
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:23,964
Got something wrong with your ears?
When the man says something, he says it.

118
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:25,088
This is hypotheticaI:

119
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:29,405
A cop who's trying to make ends meet
wants a IittIe something on the side....

120
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:30,926
I don't Iike cream...

121
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:32,526
...and I don't judge.

122
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:33,966
You don't judge?

123
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,805
He's a fucking saint, huh?

124
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:38,453
So you're teIIing me
that under no circumstances...

125
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:41,093
...wouId a hoIy man Iike you ever,
you know...

126
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:43,403
...break the Iaw or do something....

127
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:45,728
Look, Lou...

128
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,247
...I couId jump across the tabIe,
snatch your heart out of your chest...

129
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,052
...squeeze the bIood out,
and stick it in your front pocket.

130
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,122
Oh, yeah?

131
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:57,802
If I Iost controI. But if I did...

132
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,932
...I'd be no different
than the peopIe we bust.

133
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,843
Now, as to your generaI question....

134
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:06,892
You take any cop on the force,
cream or no...

135
00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:10,932
...ninety-nine percent of the time
they're doing their job, aren't they?

136
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:11,963
Ninety-nine five.

137
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:13,327
Point five.

138
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,768
So he or she, cream or no...

139
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:19,250
...is doing more good out there every day...

140
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:22,570
...than any Iawyer or a stockbroker or...

141
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:26,483
...President of the United States
can ever do in their Iifetime.

142
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:29,931
Cops are the "chosen peopIe."

143
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:31,082
Amen.

144
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,325
Guess I'm switching to Bud.

145
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:45,206
Gracie, come here and get this foreign shit
off my tabIe...

146
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:47,011
...and bring me three Buds.

147
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:07,769
Damn it, what took you so Iong?

148
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:12,369
You know what you'd Iook Iike
with this sandwich up your ass?

149
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,202
Pardon me?

150
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,609
Like a fat, stupid fuck
with a sandwich up his ass.

151
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:20,729
CharIes, I hate to do this, but....

152
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:22,969
Put the job where the sandwich goes.

153
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:44,848
HeIIo?

154
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,608
HeIIo?

155
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:51,088
HeIIo?

156
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:03,805
Here we go. Juice, pretzeIs...

157
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:05,442
...appIe....

158
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,922
Peanut butter and jeIIy sandwich.

159
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:10,527
UncIe John, wiII you pIease
make my Iunch tomorrow?

160
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:11,728
Here's Toby.

161
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,643
I can't be having the same thing every day.

162
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:18,611
What do you want,
peanut butter and jeIIy sandwich?

163
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:21,845
JeIIy and peanut butter?

164
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:25,732
I Iove you, Dad.

165
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:28,049
Don't forget your UncIe Johnny.

166
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:30,522
I can feeI the Iove in this room, man.

167
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,846
-Bye.
-Be good.

168
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,282
-Have a good day at schooI.
-Okay. Bye.

169
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:40,487
You're doing a good job, Art.

170
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:41,722
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

171
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,647
Why don't you sit down with me?
Let's taIk a bit.

172
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:45,927
You're not in a hurry?

173
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:47,731
No, no....

174
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:49,531
I can reIax today.

175
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:52,167
Besides, what are they going to do?
Fire me?

176
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:55,206
-How're you doing?
-Okay.

177
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:57,045
-You're aII right?
-Yeah.

178
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:02,326
I Iove you, Johnny.

179
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:09,604
You ever think it wouId be easier,
your Iife wouId be easier...

180
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:12,526
...if maybe me and Sam
were not Iiving with--

181
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:14,008
No, no.

182
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,887
-Maybe Marcy wouIdn't have Ieft.
-Later for Marcy.

183
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:20,691
If she Ioved me, she wouId've never Ieft.

184
00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:23,571
Besides, famiIy's aIways first.
You're my brother.

185
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:28,847
I Iove you, too.

186
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:34,844
But don't make the boy any more
peanut butter and jeIIy sandwiches.

187
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,242
-No more peanut butter and jeIIy.
-Okay.

188
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:18,325
A cop knows.

189
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,087
A cop sees.

190
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:24,204
Even the most casual thing, it registers.

191
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:29,927
Often you don't remember till later on.
But then...

192
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:32,368
...you look back and you realize...

193
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:35,292
...you knew.

194
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,525
Good morning, Detective.

195
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:43,810
How're you doing, Lieutenant?

196
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:45,565
Look who's feeIing good today.

197
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:48,531
Hey, what can I say?
You're Iooking better than me.

198
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:50,532
Got a caII on four, Hobbes.

199
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:52,365
Thank you, Denise. Jonesy?

200
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:55,884
How's everything today? Good?

201
00:16:57,173 --> 00:16:58,401
Detective Hobbes.

202
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:00,051
Pal, you got a pen?

203
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,091
4541...

204
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:04,323
...South Stender, Apartment 2.

205
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:06,042
Who's there?

206
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:07,885
A clue, Magoo.

207
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:12,811
CouIdn't sIeep Iast night.

208
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:14,008
Who can?

209
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,882
Remember I used to get caIIs at two or
three o'cIock in the morning from Reese?

210
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:20,725
He Ioved you. He truIy did.

211
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:22,883
Somebody caIIed me Iast night.

212
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:24,447
Imagine that.

213
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:25,802
-Denise?
-Yeah?

214
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:29,409
Send a car to 4541 South Stender,
Apartment 2.

215
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:31,006
Make sure we gain entry.

216
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,082
Got a body?

217
00:17:32,173 --> 00:17:36,325
No, it's probabIy just some knuckIehead,
saw me on TV, trying to impress his girI.

218
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:38,324
-How'd I Iook Iast night?
-FabuIous.

219
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:40,165
You saw that? Four different channeIs.

220
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:42,084
You're a god. You're a god.

221
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:50,889
Name's Muskavich. Russian expatriate.

222
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:53,647
Super says no famiIy,
no friends, no nothing.

223
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:55,606
Why is he dead, then?

224
00:17:57,373 --> 00:17:58,647
What've you got?

225
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:02,211
I've got puncture wounds.

226
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:05,209
Look for a syringe, or something.

227
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,766
Eighteen.

228
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:10,812
-What's that, his eighteenth victim?
-CouId be.

229
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:12,887
CouId be.

230
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:24,086
Very tidy.

231
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:27,165
The DOA's been dead awhiIe,
so what the heII is this?

232
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,603
KiIIer sIept over and then...

233
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:31,684
...had a nice, neat breakfast.

234
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:33,047
Looks Iike it.

235
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:37,161
Check this out.

236
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:49,288
Shit.

237
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:50,728
What?

238
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:52,167
It's a riddIe.

239
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,967
Reese, in his ceII before he died,
he asked me, "Why is there a space...

240
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,123
"...between Lyons and Spakowsky?"

241
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:00,968
Yeah?

242
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:07,126
AccompIice?

243
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,524
Reese had an accompIice?

244
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,367
UnIess it's a copycat. Maybe the...

245
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:15,884
...prison guards or the peopIe
that made that documentary.

246
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:18,089
-You got a minute?
-I'II be there in a second.

247
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:20,926
Fifty peopIe must have seen
that documentary by now.

248
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:23,083
Me and Jonesy wiII run them down.

249
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,282
Yeah, good.

250
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:29,528
Fingerprint. Perp wore no gIoves.

251
00:19:29,653 --> 00:19:33,168
Left prints on the spoon and cereaI bowI
Iike he was advertising.

252
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:35,364
Maybe his prints aren't in the system.

253
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:36,488
I hate to be stupid...

254
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:37,847
Enjoy it, Lou.

255
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,323
...but is motive stiII something
we think about...

256
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:43,644
...or is it that aII these crimes
are done out of sickness?

257
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:45,049
Number 2.

258
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,646
Everything is motive.

259
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,525
Sickness is motive.

260
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:49,802
Sharp.

261
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:51,606
The coroner's preIim on the Ruski.

262
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:55,083
Isn't that the wacko poison
that Reese used on them Arab kids?

263
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:00,806
-Tiff?
-Yeah?

264
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:04,568
You Iike riddIes? You know,
puzzIes and shit? Brainteasers?

265
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:06,644
Sure, as Iong as I'm doing the teasing.

266
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:10,726
Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?

267
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,483
What does that even mean? Come on!

268
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:15,291
We had a Spakowsky in my rookie year.

269
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:16,647
South Precinct.

270
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:19,082
Come again?

271
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:21,403
Not your Spakowsky. This guy's a cop.

272
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:22,847
Keep taIking.

273
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:24,885
The guy's a fucking asshoIe.

274
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,010
He's the King Kong of asshoIes.
He's a fucking Iegend.

275
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:30,371
His name's up on the waII.

276
00:20:34,253 --> 00:20:35,208
What?

277
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:41,050
Some chief in the '30s
thought it wouId boost moraIe.

278
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:45,492
They kept it up untiI '81 or '82,
and it got to be Iike a booby prize.

279
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:48,485
It was downtown in the Iobby...
tiII they remodeIed.

280
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:50,652
Must've passed it by 1,000 times.

281
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:54,248
I guess I need to open my eyes
and Iook around sometime.

282
00:20:54,493 --> 00:20:57,690
Lyons, I don't remember him,
but Spakowsky, he was around.

283
00:20:57,853 --> 00:21:01,368
This guy was so fucking mean
that his wife shot him in the foot.

284
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:02,807
Who was '65?

285
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:04,326
Who was in that space?

286
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,369
You got me, bud. I don't know.

287
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:10,722
You're saying they took a name off?
Why wouId they do that?

288
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:14,727
I don't know. I caIIed Records.
They say they don't know who it was...

289
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:17,361
...and they don't know why it's not there.

290
00:21:17,453 --> 00:21:19,125
We'd better find out.

291
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:15,121
Lieutenant, just the man I wanted to see.

292
00:22:18,893 --> 00:22:20,008
"Robert MiIano."

293
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:21,287
That's right.

294
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:23,924
Cop of the Year, 1965.

295
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,927
Eight months Iater, goes up to a cabin,
middIe of nowhere, dies cIeaning his gun.

296
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:32,086
So it's either two things:
He was dirty or it was a woman.

297
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:35,448
What?

298
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:38,002
I met him once...MiIano.

299
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:41,485
He had a poker up his ass,
but otherwise he was a good cop.

300
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:44,292
-What I want to know is--
-I know what you want.

301
00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:46,326
I can't heIp you.

302
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:48,167
Can't heIp me?

303
00:22:48,573 --> 00:22:49,608
Look...

304
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:52,644
...do aII of us a favor, okay?

305
00:22:53,213 --> 00:22:54,851
Whatever you find out...

306
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:56,691
...keep it to yourseIf.

307
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,769
I got something for you.

308
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,851
Documentary on Reese.

309
00:23:05,173 --> 00:23:07,562
Thank you. You're a reaI white man.

310
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,128
Jonesy.

311
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:12,365
-Tape on Reese. You want to view it?
-Give me a sec.

312
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:14,371
What do you got on Muskavich?

313
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:15,806
Fingerprints were bust.

314
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:18,532
The crime scene says
the kiIIer probabIy had dark hair.

315
00:23:18,613 --> 00:23:19,966
He probabIy was Ieft-handed.

316
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:21,611
Yeah, Iike Reese.

317
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,571
He had bad teeth.
Found a piece in the corn fIakes.

318
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:26,970
Directory Assistance.

319
00:23:27,053 --> 00:23:28,771
Can you give me a number on a MiIano...

320
00:23:28,853 --> 00:23:30,445
...SyIvia M-I-L-A-N-O.

321
00:23:30,573 --> 00:23:31,767
Hold, please.

322
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:33,366
Hey, Lieutenant.

323
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:34,932
Excuse me, Boss.

324
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:42,404
If somebody dies because you kept
your mouth shut, you're hoIding the bag.

325
00:23:42,573 --> 00:23:45,133
When it's a perfect worId, Iet me know.

326
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:48,810
In the meantime,
it's not me keeping his mouth shut.

327
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,164
-Is that cIear enough for you?
-Yeah.

328
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:53,050
I'm sorry. There's no listing.

329
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:56,364
Okay, thanks. No, Iisten, Iisten.
You stiII there? HeIIo?

330
00:23:56,533 --> 00:24:00,765
Check and see if there's a G. MiIano,
a Gretta MiIano. Can you do that for me?

331
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:01,888
-Hold, please.
-Thanks.

332
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,804
Syringe had the same prints.

333
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:07,604
-So now what? Video time?
-Yeah.

334
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:11,331
You know, I was thinking....

335
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:12,732
Don't hurt yourseIf.

336
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:13,768
Eat me.

337
00:24:13,893 --> 00:24:15,372
Hold for the number.

338
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:18,651
Whoever did Muskavich,
knew the poison that Reese used.

339
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:21,645
He quotes Reese. He couId be a cop.

340
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:23,371
He couId be, huh?

341
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:25,364
Lou, couId be a cop, huh?

342
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:27,769
Please leave a message. Thank you.

343
00:24:28,973 --> 00:24:31,203
Make sure Hobbes gets a copy of this.

344
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:34,968
Are you watching, Johnny-boy?
I hope you're paying close attention.

345
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:36,486
Every gesture!

346
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:37,762
Every word!

347
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:47,402
Wait a second.

348
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:48,528
What?

349
00:24:48,693 --> 00:24:50,126
Check something out.

350
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,288
That...

351
00:24:57,613 --> 00:24:59,524
...Ianguage he was speaking...

352
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:00,807
...Iater.

353
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:02,292
That's Dutch?

354
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:04,646
That's what he said.

355
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:07,562
What's he speaking now? Is that Dutch?

356
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:09,642
This now?

357
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:13,683
This is mumbo-jumbo, gibberish.

358
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:16,972
You sure on that?

359
00:25:36,053 --> 00:25:37,281
Who is it?

360
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:40,843
It's Detective John Hobbes.
I'm looking for Miss Gretta Milano.

361
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:44,488
-Oh, yes. You left a message.
-Yes.

362
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,761
I wanted to taIk to you about your father.

363
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,972
How're you doing?

364
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:57,002
May I come in?

365
00:25:59,213 --> 00:26:00,487
Sure.

366
00:26:09,973 --> 00:26:12,567
You're surrounded by angeIs.

367
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:15,682
I teach theoIogy at the university.

368
00:26:15,813 --> 00:26:18,088
I see. Very beautifuI.

369
00:26:18,253 --> 00:26:19,368
Thank you.

370
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:22,607
Why do you want to know
about my father?

371
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:29,121
It's 30 years Iater and the fiIes are seaIed...

372
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:33,611
...and my boss was toId to Iet it aIone, so...

373
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:35,767
...here I am.

374
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:40,644
I can teII you what my mother toId me
before she died.

375
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,447
Why do you want to know?
Just curious, or...?

376
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:45,528
No, ma'am.

377
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:48,764
See, I'm the detective
who caught Edgar Reese.

378
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:51,765
I'm not sure if you're famiIiar with him.
He was just executed.

379
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:53,491
-Yeah, I read about him.
-Right.

380
00:26:53,573 --> 00:26:56,133
And this Reese feIIa, he...

381
00:26:57,213 --> 00:27:00,091
...in a roundabout way,
gave me your father's name.

382
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,371
Did Reese Iike to sing?

383
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:08,445
Yeah, he did, actuaIIy.

384
00:27:10,373 --> 00:27:13,604
And at the execution,
did he try and touch you or grab you?

385
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:16,042
Yeah, he did. He shook my hand.

386
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:19,088
Do you want some coffee?

387
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:20,288
Sure.

388
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:24,126
One condition:

389
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:26,206
You and I never spoke.

390
00:27:26,693 --> 00:27:30,288
You say nothing to your boss or partner.
Nothing goes in the fiIes.

391
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:33,809
My name and everything I say
is just between us. Agreed?

392
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:36,362
WiII I get a cup of coffee if I say yes?

393
00:27:39,253 --> 00:27:42,325
Detective, my dad was a good cop.

394
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:46,369
"Pride of the force" and aII that.
And then he shot himseIf.

395
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:49,730
A reporter found out
my father had been under investigation.

396
00:27:49,813 --> 00:27:53,010
He'd caught a kiIIer,
but copycat crimes started.

397
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:56,370
Evidence mounted up against him:
fingerprints, witnesses.

398
00:27:56,493 --> 00:28:00,532
The press never got reaI proof,
but my father's medaI was rescinded.

399
00:28:00,693 --> 00:28:01,728
I see.

400
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:06,843
So you're saying that when he died
someone made this evidence go away?

401
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:10,928
The mayor, the governor and
the chief of poIice, they aII needed a hero.

402
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:13,243
Some of these peopIe are
stiII important today.

403
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,801
-I see.
-No. Not yet, you don't.

404
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:20,526
My father saw the evidence against him,
toId my mother he couIdn't beat it.

405
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:23,241
So, he went to this cabin in the mountains.

406
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:26,769
It's a pIace that's been
in my mother's famiIy for generations.

407
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:28,526
He went there and....

408
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:33,727
The thing is...

409
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:36,691
...I know my father was innocent
of those murders.

410
00:28:37,253 --> 00:28:38,572
How do you know?

411
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:42,564
How do you know he was innocent?

412
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:47,527
It was 30 years ago.
It's not important anymore.

413
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:49,649
It's important to me, Miss MiIano.

414
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:52,042
Don't you want the truth to come out,
the kiIIer to be punished?

415
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:54,328
-Of course, I do.
-But?

416
00:28:57,973 --> 00:29:01,648
Are you afraid that if you teII me
your Iife may be in danger?

417
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:03,888
Yeah.

418
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:05,202
That's it?

419
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:07,042
Yes.

420
00:29:08,693 --> 00:29:09,808
Okay.

421
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:13,681
Okay.

422
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:15,365
Thank you very much.

423
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:17,569
-For the coffee as weII.
-Okay.

424
00:29:20,573 --> 00:29:21,892
Oh, Iisten....

425
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:24,533
If I have any more questions,
can I caII you?

426
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:26,491
I'd rather you didn't.

427
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:33,966
Detective....

428
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:37,051
Do you beIieve in God?

429
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:40,487
Yeah. I go to church every now and then.

430
00:29:41,053 --> 00:29:43,044
What I see in my Iine of work...

431
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:45,443
...faith's a IittIe hard to sustain.

432
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:48,528
Good Iuck.

433
00:29:56,893 --> 00:30:00,932
Sometimes I think the basicjob
that human beings have...

434
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:03,971
...isjust to figure out
what the hell is going on.

435
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:06,363
Example: Gretta Milano.

436
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:09,889
What was she hiding?
What was she so scared of?.

437
00:30:10,213 --> 00:30:13,808
And then her question about God.
What the hell is that all about?

438
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:24,410
You never know.
Down to the smallest thing.

439
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:28,722
The man who passes you
and catches your eye. Does he know you?

440
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:33,205
Did you go to school together? Is he a
homicidal maniac who hates you on sight?

441
00:30:37,813 --> 00:30:39,166
Or is it nothing?

442
00:30:40,453 --> 00:30:41,647
Nothing at all.

443
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:29,248
Wake up.

444
00:31:33,013 --> 00:31:34,969
Go to bed.

445
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:39,564
I know. I know.

446
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,564
Here we go. Up. Up.

447
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,042
I'm going, UncIe John.

448
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:49,648
HeIIo?

449
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:52,002
HeIIo?

450
00:31:57,093 --> 00:31:58,287
Let's go, Sam.

451
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,087
Good night.

452
00:32:09,253 --> 00:32:10,572
Good night, son.

453
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:16,731
-Johnny?
-Yeah?

454
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:18,971
Do you ever get scared?

455
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:22,367
Yeah, sometimes.

456
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,002
Me, too.

457
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:40,692
Good night, Art.

458
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:03,533
-Hello?
-Mrs. Moohr? This is CharIes.

459
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:06,648
ApparentIy, I must have gotten drunk
or something...

460
00:33:06,733 --> 00:33:08,803
...because the Iast few days....

461
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:11,081
Am I working tonight?

462
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:12,367
You quit.

463
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:14,162
I quit?

464
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:17,404
Yes. You insulted Harry
and he hired someone else.

465
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:19,484
But.... I mean.... How...?

466
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:24,810
Look, I'm reaIIy sorry....

467
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:28,250
CouId you apoIogize, pIease,
to your husband for whatever--

468
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,893
We always liked you, Charles. Goodbye.

469
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:52,322
HeIIo?

470
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:59,172
Well, well, well. Look who's here.

471
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:40,850
I pIayed Reese's tape on the phone
to a Iinguist. He's coming down.

472
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:42,082
Yeah? PreIim?

473
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:43,970
Said it sounded Mideastern.

474
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:46,209
-Anything on Muskavich?
-OnIy the pizza.

475
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,568
Now, we're hitting
your area of expertise, huh?

476
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,564
Pizza is a staff of Iife.

477
00:34:50,893 --> 00:34:54,772
Without pizza and other fine ItaIian foods,
there wouId be no happiness.

478
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,451
There was one sIice Ieft:

479
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:59,001
GarIic, Iinguica and pineappIe.

480
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,052
PIus, there was nothing
in Muskavich's stomach.

481
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:03,407
So it was the kiIIer's eats.

482
00:35:03,493 --> 00:35:06,291
HeII of a cIue. You better write
that one up for the journaI.

483
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:09,285
I wiII, Lou. And I wiII Iaud you copiousIy.

484
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,688
Thank you.

485
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:12,843
Detectives? Your guy's in Video.

486
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:15,725
The Iinguist guy's here.

487
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,766
I'II be right there.

488
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:22,202
Any Iuck?

489
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,642
John Hobbes, Professor Richard Louders.

490
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:26,365
-How do you do?
-PIeasure.

491
00:35:26,453 --> 00:35:28,364
This is compIeteIy exhiIarating.

492
00:35:28,453 --> 00:35:30,887
Who is this convict? Can I speak to him?

493
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:33,009
Not now. Have a seat.

494
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,848
Professor says it's a Ianguage.
He's just never heard it spoken aIoud.

495
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:38,844
-Meaning?
-Some kind of antique.

496
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:43,165
I beIieve this is a BibIicaI tongue:
Syrian Aramaic.

497
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:45,803
OnIy a few nomadic tribes stiII use it.

498
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,451
So you don't know what he's saying?

499
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:49,171
I haven't the faintest.

500
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:51,124
He's not too pIeasant, is he?

501
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:55,729
But if you'd spare me a copy,
I'd be more than happy to work it.

502
00:35:55,813 --> 00:35:59,488
I'd appreciate it. If you couId wait out front
for 15 minutes...

503
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:01,326
...we'II dupe one off for you.

504
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:02,687
I'II be waiting.

505
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:05,328
-See you in a minute.
-'Bye, Detective.

506
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:13,242
-Syrian Aramaic.
-Imagine that.

507
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:17,530
I got something eIse, too.
I'm Iooking up this cIipping...

508
00:36:17,613 --> 00:36:19,968
...of Reese, high-schooI basebaII team.

509
00:36:20,653 --> 00:36:22,086
He bats right.

510
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:24,327
He throws right.

511
00:36:26,173 --> 00:36:27,731
What are you saying, Hobbes?

512
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:30,088
Reese puIIed off some of the sickest shit
on record.

513
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:34,405
He speaks a Ianguage 2,000 years oId and
you're worried 'cause he's ambidextrous?

514
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,051
I'm worried about everything.

515
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:38,647
-Hobbes, caII on Line 1 .
-Thank you, BiII.

516
00:36:41,293 --> 00:36:42,408
Detective Hobbes.

517
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,723
Hey, pal, need another clue?

518
00:36:45,373 --> 00:36:47,364
1339 South Grove...

519
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:49,001
...Apartment 9.

520
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:55,687
Jonesy, that pizza pIace
with the number 17?

521
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,971
Is that cIose to Grove?

522
00:36:58,173 --> 00:36:59,367
I think so.

523
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:16,724
They're in the same pIace...

524
00:37:16,813 --> 00:37:17,928
...exactIy.

525
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:24,003
-It's Iike he's Iaughing at us.
-He is.

526
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:32,890
Cash, not a check?

527
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,327
That's right.

528
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:43,612
Take a Iook at this.

529
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:49,206
What the heII is this?

530
00:37:57,373 --> 00:37:58,886
You know what's scary?

531
00:38:00,893 --> 00:38:05,205
I'm going home Iast night, this guy's
waIking past me, he's going the other way.

532
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:07,764
He Iooks me right in the eye.

533
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:11,004
The kind of Iook Iike he knows you.
You know what I mean?

534
00:38:15,453 --> 00:38:17,683
It's the same guy that's in the bathtub.

535
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:19,411
-The stiff.
-You're shitting me.

536
00:38:19,493 --> 00:38:21,211
I shit you not. Same guy.

537
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:24,286
Oh, man.

538
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:27,449
I ain't smart enough to figure this out.

539
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:28,648
Me, neither.

540
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:30,246
Found under the sink.

541
00:38:34,373 --> 00:38:35,362
Same poison?

542
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:38,013
Same poison.
Better get that down to the Iab.

543
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:41,132
-What eIse have you got?
-The number on his chest.

544
00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:43,681
Last Thursday it's 18, now it's 2?

545
00:38:43,773 --> 00:38:47,732
Everything's under a CharIes OIom,
but it Iooks Iike that's an aIias.

546
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,929
So, we're running his prints.

547
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:01,530
To quote Yogi Berra ,
"It's Iike dájá vu aII over again."

548
00:39:01,693 --> 00:39:03,251
-You mean Reese?
-Yeah.

549
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:07,526
Whoever is doing it...

550
00:39:08,173 --> 00:39:09,925
...has a thing for Hobbes.

551
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:11,287
Seems like.

552
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:14,122
How is he?

553
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:15,527
Who, Hobbes?

554
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:18,962
How is he ever? He's fine. He's great.

555
00:39:19,613 --> 00:39:22,207
If it starts to work at him,
let me know, okay?

556
00:39:23,413 --> 00:39:26,211
And if it starts to work on me,
I'II Iet you know.

557
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:49,165
I thought that was you.

558
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,891
What are you doing, more...

559
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:52,611
...historicaI research?

560
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:57,963
Nice taIking to you. See you Monday.

561
00:39:58,413 --> 00:39:59,641
AII right, Lou.

562
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,005
Come on, Jimmy.

563
00:40:03,093 --> 00:40:04,446
Over here, shoot it!

564
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:06,125
Shoot it, shoot it!

565
00:40:06,293 --> 00:40:08,329
Come on, come on, Sam. Okay.

566
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,645
That's okay, that's okay.

567
00:40:10,853 --> 00:40:12,172
Score is tied.

568
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,085
No, 19 to 17.

569
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:15,882
You can take him.

570
00:40:15,973 --> 00:40:17,645
Pass the baII. I'm open.

571
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:19,326
Take the baII back.

572
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:23,966
Johnny's going to make a point.
He's got the baII.

573
00:40:24,053 --> 00:40:26,009
-Hi, Art.
-How're you doing?

574
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:28,483
Good one! Three, two, one!

575
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:32,091
That's it for me. I've gotta go.

576
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:34,323
No, I've gotta go. I have a Iong drive.

577
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:35,641
Art, get in here.

578
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,769
UncIe John, but he's a spaz.

579
00:40:38,253 --> 00:40:41,450
You don't disrespect your father, okay?
You understand me?

580
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:43,126
Cherish what you got.

581
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,561
Get on in there.

582
00:40:45,653 --> 00:40:47,609
-Want to come with us?
-I didn't bring my shoes.

583
00:40:47,693 --> 00:40:48,648
Come on.

584
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:50,888
What's up?

585
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:53,282
-Tiffany didn't get you?
-No, what's up?

586
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,409
You know how weird this case is?

587
00:40:56,693 --> 00:40:58,570
We got a positive I.D...

588
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:00,652
...on CharIes OIom.

589
00:41:01,573 --> 00:41:03,211
ReaI name's Mickey Noons.

590
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:05,643
Born in Canada, iIIegaI aIien.

591
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:08,208
BIah, bIah, bIah. SmaIItime shithead.

592
00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:09,767
That ain't bad.

593
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:11,127
That ain't it.

594
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:16,052
Noons kiIIed the Ruski. It's his prints
aII over Muskavich's apartment.

595
00:41:16,213 --> 00:41:17,168
What?

596
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:20,241
Let's see, Noons poisons Muskavich...

597
00:41:20,493 --> 00:41:23,371
...dumps him in the tub,
sets out the corn fIakes.

598
00:41:24,053 --> 00:41:27,284
Three days Iater somebody does
the exact same thing to him.

599
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,810
"Exact," because Noons and Muskavich
were kiIIed by the same person.

600
00:41:30,893 --> 00:41:32,246
Some kind of ringmaster?

601
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,607
I think so.

602
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:36,605
Hey, Art. You and Sam don't forget Iunch,
aII right?

603
00:41:37,053 --> 00:41:39,965
I don't know.
I can't seem to get my mind around it.

604
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:42,650
I got a bad feeIing about this.

605
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:43,882
Me, too.

606
00:41:44,813 --> 00:41:47,532
Somebody's pIaying with my dick
and it ain't me.

607
00:41:49,093 --> 00:41:50,651
-Yeah. See you.
-'Bye.

608
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:54,410
-Ten minutes, Art!
-Okay.

609
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:34,922
There are moments which mark your life.

610
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:38,370
Moments when you realize
nothing will ever be the same.

611
00:43:38,653 --> 00:43:41,645
And time is divided into two parts:

612
00:43:42,693 --> 00:43:44,012
Before this...

613
00:43:44,573 --> 00:43:45,972
...and after this.

614
00:44:15,413 --> 00:44:17,927
Sometimes you can feel
such a moment coming.

615
00:44:19,213 --> 00:44:21,886
That's the test...or so I tell myself.

616
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:24,888
I tell myself that at times like that...

617
00:44:25,573 --> 00:44:29,009
...strong people keep moving forward,
anyway...

618
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,722
...no matter what they're going to find.

619
00:47:40,853 --> 00:47:43,162
-Miss MiIano.
-Oh, heIIo.

620
00:47:44,773 --> 00:47:47,412
I went to your famiIy's pIace
in the mountains.

621
00:47:48,053 --> 00:47:49,805
-BeautifuI, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

622
00:47:49,893 --> 00:47:51,531
Let me get that for you.

623
00:47:52,213 --> 00:47:53,441
Trees and the water....

624
00:47:53,533 --> 00:47:56,127
AbsoIuteIy beautifuI.
What does "AzazeI" mean?

625
00:47:58,053 --> 00:48:02,205
Your father wrote it in the basement
on the waII, then he painted over it.

626
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:04,206
My dictionary...

627
00:48:04,453 --> 00:48:06,125
...says that it's "the...

628
00:48:06,293 --> 00:48:07,806
"...eviI spirit of the wiIderness."

629
00:48:07,893 --> 00:48:09,406
Whatever that means.

630
00:48:09,573 --> 00:48:12,246
One of the books your father had up there
taIks about demons...

631
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,244
...and how they move by touch.

632
00:48:14,373 --> 00:48:15,931
WaIk away, Mr. Hobbes.

633
00:48:16,253 --> 00:48:18,289
-Say again?
-If you enjoy your Iife...

634
00:48:18,373 --> 00:48:22,252
...if there's even one human being
you care about, don't take this case.

635
00:48:26,893 --> 00:48:30,203
It's out of my hands, Miss MiIano.
I mean, it's my job.

636
00:48:32,173 --> 00:48:33,492
'Bye, Mr. Hobbes.

637
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:35,722
That's it?

638
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:37,246
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

639
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:53,086
-Fax.
-Thanks.

640
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,642
Phone company sent MUDs and LUDs
for Noons' and Muskavich's apartments.

641
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:01,405
See those caIIs there?

642
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:04,605
They were made right around
the time they were kiIIed.

643
00:49:05,293 --> 00:49:07,727
You're saying the kiIIer caIIed me
from the crime scene?

644
00:49:07,813 --> 00:49:08,882
Sure Iooks Iike it.

645
00:49:08,973 --> 00:49:11,612
-Reese used to caII me at night.
-Reese is dead.

646
00:49:11,693 --> 00:49:14,287
Whoever's doing this
is in Ieague with Reese...

647
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:17,928
...or was imitating Reese.
I know he's stiII caIIing my house.

648
00:49:18,453 --> 00:49:20,409
How many times have I got to change
my phone number?

649
00:49:20,493 --> 00:49:23,326
The more you change it, the more it Iooks
Iike someone on the inside.

650
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:24,641
Like a cop?

651
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:26,368
Yeah.

652
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:33,646
It's nothing to me...

653
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:35,849
...but the egos upstairs....

654
00:49:37,653 --> 00:49:39,245
-You hear me?
-Both ears.

655
00:49:44,573 --> 00:49:47,531
I'm going to Iose my sense of humor.
What've you got?

656
00:49:47,773 --> 00:49:49,729
A transIation from the Aramaic:

657
00:49:50,093 --> 00:49:51,970
"I can't enter you by touch.

658
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:55,808
"But even when I can get inside you,
after I'm spirit, I won't.

659
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:59,524
"I'II fuck you up and down, Ieft and right."
That's in the BibIe.

660
00:49:59,613 --> 00:50:01,683
"If that doesn't work, I have other ways."

661
00:50:01,773 --> 00:50:04,207
We need a transIation of the transIation.

662
00:50:13,893 --> 00:50:15,246
Anything eIse?

663
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:17,611
No, I'm okay. Thanks.

664
00:50:51,773 --> 00:50:53,126
I like the night.

665
00:50:53,373 --> 00:50:54,567
The street.

666
00:50:54,733 --> 00:50:56,166
The smells.

667
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,689
The sense of another world.

668
00:51:04,013 --> 00:51:06,811
Sometimes you come
face to face with yourself.

669
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:04,088
Now...

670
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:05,692
...put that card back in.

671
00:53:05,773 --> 00:53:07,491
-Anywhere.
-AII right.

672
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:11,362
-TeII me when to stop, okay?
-Okay.

673
00:53:11,613 --> 00:53:13,683
Can you pronounce it for me again?

674
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:18,845
Okay, Professor, I think I got it.
AII right...'bye.

675
00:53:41,493 --> 00:53:44,166
I can get inside you.
After I'm spirit, I won't.

676
00:53:44,653 --> 00:53:45,608
No.

677
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:47,685
Better I get you for real.

678
00:53:49,213 --> 00:53:49,884
Fuck you...

679
00:53:49,973 --> 00:53:52,965
...up, down, left, right, coming, going....

680
00:53:53,693 --> 00:53:55,604
I'll get so close to you...

681
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:58,010
...so close it breaks you.

682
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:01,365
And if that doesn't work...

683
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,365
...well, I have other ways.

684
00:54:04,093 --> 00:54:05,572
I have so many...

685
00:54:05,733 --> 00:54:06,961
...many ways.

686
00:54:24,853 --> 00:54:25,808
Right.

687
00:54:25,973 --> 00:54:27,372
Fifteen minutes.

688
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:32,366
Hi. Can I heIp you?

689
00:54:34,413 --> 00:54:36,768
You're reIeasing a Richard SuckIe?

690
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:40,565
-He caIIed a cab.
-I'II have him brought right down.

691
00:54:46,413 --> 00:54:48,449
-Looking good today.
-Thanks.

692
00:54:52,653 --> 00:54:54,052
Rap sheet on Bobby Stiggers.

693
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:55,202
Thank you.

694
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:08,771
Hobbesy, teII me something.

695
00:55:08,853 --> 00:55:09,763
Shoot.

696
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:12,970
The other day you were
in the basement reading an oId fiIe.

697
00:55:13,053 --> 00:55:14,042
What about it?

698
00:55:14,133 --> 00:55:17,045
Looked Iike a map in there.
Are you going somewhere?

699
00:55:17,893 --> 00:55:18,928
I went up to the country.

700
00:55:19,013 --> 00:55:20,765
It's great to get out of town.

701
00:55:20,853 --> 00:55:22,730
LoveIy. Fresh air, you know?

702
00:55:23,013 --> 00:55:27,211
I used to do that. Go up to a house
in the mountains and sit by the water.

703
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:28,886
It was beautifuI.

704
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:32,489
So I'm curious. Where'd you go?

705
00:55:34,093 --> 00:55:35,321
Why do you ask?

706
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:39,168
Come here.

707
00:55:39,973 --> 00:55:41,042
Come here.

708
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:43,046
Come on, come here.

709
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:47,371
"Time

710
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:50,411
"Is on my side

711
00:55:51,493 --> 00:55:52,608
"Yes, it is

712
00:55:53,053 --> 00:55:54,850
"Time

713
00:55:55,773 --> 00:55:57,491
"Is on my side

714
00:55:58,133 --> 00:55:59,282
"Yes, it is"

715
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:01,091
-Lou?
-What?

716
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:04,726
"You're aIways saying

717
00:56:04,813 --> 00:56:06,644
"That you want to be free

718
00:56:06,893 --> 00:56:09,123
"But I'II come running back"

719
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:30,089
Why were you singing that song?

720
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,448
-Song?
-Why were you singing that song?

721
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:33,329
I was singing?

722
00:56:33,413 --> 00:56:36,166
Did they put you up to this?
Why did you sing that song?

723
00:56:36,253 --> 00:56:37,049
What're you taIking about?

724
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:40,091
-You don't know what I'm taIking about?
-No, I don't.

725
00:56:40,173 --> 00:56:43,643
You don't know what I'm taIking about?

726
00:56:58,933 --> 00:57:00,048
Hey, you!

727
00:57:11,133 --> 00:57:12,771
Syrian Aramaic.

728
00:57:14,173 --> 00:57:15,447
How cIever.

729
00:57:16,093 --> 00:57:17,003
Jesus.

730
00:57:19,373 --> 00:57:20,886
It's true what I said.

731
00:57:21,413 --> 00:57:22,926
I do know who you are.

732
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,088
AzazeI.

733
00:57:25,613 --> 00:57:27,126
Where'd you get that?

734
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,086
From MiIano's pIace?

735
00:57:29,573 --> 00:57:31,450
You found something up there.

736
00:57:32,253 --> 00:57:35,325
WeII, some things, paI, you shouIdn't know.

737
00:57:35,693 --> 00:57:36,887
Like what?

738
00:57:37,773 --> 00:57:38,808
Like what?

739
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:42,690
If you know, you shouId never, ever teII.

740
00:57:52,653 --> 00:57:54,166
Beware of my wrath.

741
00:59:08,013 --> 00:59:09,048
WeII?

742
00:59:12,253 --> 00:59:14,164
What were you doing back then?

743
00:59:15,493 --> 00:59:18,326
-What are you taIking about?
-You were singing.

744
00:59:19,613 --> 00:59:20,602
No.

745
00:59:21,053 --> 00:59:22,452
-I wasn't singing.
-You were.

746
00:59:22,533 --> 00:59:25,331
Lawrence and Mike were singing
some '60s thing.

747
00:59:25,413 --> 00:59:26,562
There you go.

748
00:59:27,613 --> 00:59:30,491
I wasn't singing it. I hated the fucking '60s.

749
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:35,686
I wasn't singing.

750
00:59:38,373 --> 00:59:41,206
I appreciate your situation, okay?
I really do.

751
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:45,808
Your father, mother, they're dead,
their Iives were ruined, your Iife's ruined.

752
00:59:45,893 --> 00:59:47,212
I'm very sorry about that.

753
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:51,206
But I gotta know what's going on.
If this thing is what it seems to be...

754
00:59:51,573 --> 00:59:54,804
...if this thing is what the book says
that it is, then....

755
01:00:00,973 --> 01:00:03,533
Is this for reaI? Do you beIieve this stuff?

756
01:00:03,613 --> 01:00:05,444
I beIieve more is hidden than is seen.

757
01:00:05,533 --> 01:00:09,526
I beIieve what I see. I'm trying to get
my mind around what I just saw.

758
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,201
Something...

759
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:12,686
...threatened me.

760
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:15,210
Reese threatened me in Aramaic.

761
01:00:15,293 --> 01:00:17,124
What eIse did Reese say?

762
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:19,124
I'm asking the questions here.

763
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:24,043
You answer the questions I ask.
Because if I don't know what's going on--

764
01:00:24,133 --> 01:00:27,205
We're not supposed to know.
We're not supposed to see.

765
01:00:27,453 --> 01:00:29,921
It's Iike the Mafia. They don't even exist.

766
01:00:30,013 --> 01:00:31,287
Okay...okay.

767
01:00:31,693 --> 01:00:34,571
That's good. That's a start.
They don't even exist.

768
01:00:34,653 --> 01:00:37,213
So where are they from?
Who the heII are they?

769
01:00:37,853 --> 01:00:40,048
There are certain phenomena...

770
01:00:40,213 --> 01:00:43,364
...which can onIy be expIained
if there is a god...

771
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:46,930
...and if there are angeIs.
And there are. They exist.

772
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:51,770
Some angeIs were cast down. A few
were punished by being deprived of form.

773
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:55,364
They can onIy survive in the bodies
of others. It's inside of us.

774
01:00:55,453 --> 01:00:58,445
Inside of human beings,
their vengeance is pIayed out.

775
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:02,648
That's it?

776
01:01:03,733 --> 01:01:05,405
Come on, get out of here.

777
01:01:06,093 --> 01:01:07,572
Come on.

778
01:01:08,173 --> 01:01:09,288
I mean....

779
01:01:09,853 --> 01:01:11,889
Miss MiIano, I'm just a cop, okay?

780
01:01:12,053 --> 01:01:13,247
I'm a detective.

781
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,483
My work is based upon evidence, facts.

782
01:01:15,573 --> 01:01:17,291
Mine, too. Mine, too.

783
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:21,646
Aren't your facts here
rather resistant to normaI interpretation?

784
01:01:23,253 --> 01:01:24,845
So you're saying that...

785
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,846
...Edgar Reese is actuaIIy--

786
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,572
At the time you knew him,
he was not himseIf.

787
01:01:29,693 --> 01:01:31,490
-He was AzazeI?
-Yes, AzazeI.

788
01:01:31,853 --> 01:01:34,287
Sadistic, Ieft-handed, Iikes to sing.

789
01:01:34,453 --> 01:01:37,013
Reese? Why does he focus in on me?

790
01:01:37,173 --> 01:01:39,767
You got his attention.
He tried to get inside you.

791
01:01:39,853 --> 01:01:44,210
He shook your hand. That didn't work,
so now he'II try to find some other way.

792
01:01:46,693 --> 01:01:48,570
Like he did with your father?

793
01:01:56,453 --> 01:01:58,683
How do we fight him? Is it possibIe?

794
01:01:58,773 --> 01:02:00,923
I beIieve it is. And I'm not aIone.

795
01:02:01,293 --> 01:02:04,444
There's a network. I don't even know
who they are. I just have numbers.

796
01:02:04,533 --> 01:02:06,205
These peopIe know the--

797
01:02:06,373 --> 01:02:09,649
We beIieve that God Iimited demons
and made them mortaI.

798
01:02:10,133 --> 01:02:12,408
He put a few of us here to fight them.

799
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:14,125
Us? Us who?

800
01:02:14,453 --> 01:02:15,602
Who, us?

801
01:02:16,013 --> 01:02:18,288
You're saying I'm one of these peopIe?

802
01:02:18,613 --> 01:02:21,127
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not.

803
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,410
You're just doing your job.

804
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:25,368
Okay.

805
01:02:25,693 --> 01:02:26,808
Touché.

806
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:29,569
So these demons are mortaI?
They can be kiIIed?

807
01:02:29,653 --> 01:02:31,291
-By the right person.
-Who is?

808
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,489
This is reIigion, Mr. Hobbes.

809
01:02:33,853 --> 01:02:37,129
These are matters of fate and divine order.
The right man--

810
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:38,771
-Or woman.
-Yes.

811
01:02:38,973 --> 01:02:40,770
It couId be you, me, anybody?

812
01:02:40,853 --> 01:02:44,243
The right person of the right character
with the right knowIedge....

813
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:46,324
So, this is what you've been doing.

814
01:02:46,413 --> 01:02:48,927
You've been preparing for this,
haven't you?

815
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:55,443
Can I ask you something personaI?

816
01:02:56,293 --> 01:02:58,727
Everything's personaI if you're a person.

817
01:02:59,013 --> 01:03:00,731
Is this why you Iive aIone?

818
01:03:02,973 --> 01:03:06,568
There's a difference between
risking for yourseIf and someone eIse.

819
01:03:06,813 --> 01:03:07,928
That's true.

820
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:09,288
I mean...

821
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:13,969
...if I had someone, I'd want to share
my Iife and thoughts, and work with them.

822
01:03:14,493 --> 01:03:18,122
If I shared this, I'd put them at risk
and I don't have that right.

823
01:03:19,533 --> 01:03:20,932
You can taIk to me.

824
01:03:21,253 --> 01:03:24,563
You don't have to. I'm not saying that....
I'm not, you know....

825
01:03:24,653 --> 01:03:28,726
Do whatever you want to do. I'm just
saying you can taIk to me if you want.

826
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:30,888
Thanks.

827
01:03:31,493 --> 01:03:33,643
That's a very nice thing to say.

828
01:03:34,453 --> 01:03:35,966
I've got to go.

829
01:03:36,093 --> 01:03:37,970
I hope I've been heIpfuI.

830
01:03:39,573 --> 01:03:41,643
-Thanks for Iistening.
-Thank you.

831
01:04:47,813 --> 01:04:48,848
I'm sorry.

832
01:04:48,973 --> 01:04:51,089
I was about to tap you on the shouIder.

833
01:04:51,173 --> 01:04:53,403
You're a friend of John Hobbes, right?

834
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:55,486
I'm Jay ReynoIds.

835
01:04:58,973 --> 01:05:00,008
You know?

836
01:05:01,453 --> 01:05:02,602
How IoveIy.

837
01:05:04,853 --> 01:05:06,809
You're not just Hobbes' chippy.

838
01:05:07,453 --> 01:05:08,647
Have we met?

839
01:05:08,813 --> 01:05:10,531
You seem vagueIy famiIiar.

840
01:05:12,013 --> 01:05:13,082
Come on...

841
01:05:13,213 --> 01:05:14,328
...teII me.

842
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:17,164
I'm about to find out anyway.

843
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:24,128
ForepIay.

844
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,288
Watch out.

845
01:05:25,373 --> 01:05:26,692
No, you don't!

846
01:05:51,093 --> 01:05:52,367
PIease, heIp me!

847
01:05:54,453 --> 01:05:55,932
Go! Go!

848
01:05:56,093 --> 01:05:58,004
-Open up!
-Go!

849
01:06:06,773 --> 01:06:08,411
Jesus, are you aII right?

850
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:31,732
Are you aII right?

851
01:06:37,533 --> 01:06:38,886
Thanks for coming.

852
01:06:44,413 --> 01:06:45,607
I ran.

853
01:06:47,293 --> 01:06:49,045
He came after me and I ran.

854
01:06:52,093 --> 01:06:53,287
Maybe you weren't ready yet.

855
01:06:53,373 --> 01:06:55,933
That's the point. You have to be ready.

856
01:06:56,773 --> 01:06:58,206
You know what it is?

857
01:06:59,893 --> 01:07:02,123
I never beIieved this day wouId come.

858
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:05,327
I thought God wouId make it up to me.
I'd be good...

859
01:07:05,413 --> 01:07:07,847
...and God wouId show me
an angeI instead.

860
01:07:10,533 --> 01:07:12,205
Do they know who you are?

861
01:07:17,813 --> 01:07:19,724
We shouIdn't be seen together.

862
01:07:20,373 --> 01:07:21,488
Not anymore.

863
01:07:27,813 --> 01:07:29,371
Wipe your tears.

864
01:07:42,653 --> 01:07:44,644
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

865
01:07:44,733 --> 01:07:46,086
How're you doing?

866
01:07:46,533 --> 01:07:47,488
Fine.

867
01:07:47,613 --> 01:07:49,649
Murders not getting you wound up?

868
01:07:51,013 --> 01:07:54,767
Bag the chocoIates. You ain't got
to taIk to me sideways. What's up?

869
01:07:56,253 --> 01:07:59,165
Where were you
when Muskavich and Noons were kiIIed?

870
01:08:00,133 --> 01:08:01,361
Where was I?

871
01:08:01,853 --> 01:08:03,286
Am I a suspect?

872
01:08:04,253 --> 01:08:05,402
Sit down.

873
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:10,726
Not to me, you're not.

874
01:08:10,813 --> 01:08:11,768
But....

875
01:08:12,293 --> 01:08:16,047
Lieutenant, you know....
What is it, the phone records again?

876
01:08:16,973 --> 01:08:18,406
What do they think I did?

877
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:22,042
I committed murder, then caIIed home,
then ran home and answered my phone?

878
01:08:22,133 --> 01:08:23,725
No, it's something eIse.

879
01:08:24,493 --> 01:08:25,767
Your prints.

880
01:08:26,613 --> 01:08:27,648
My prints?

881
01:08:28,293 --> 01:08:29,282
On what?

882
01:08:29,533 --> 01:08:31,808
On that fucking IittIe coin of yours.

883
01:08:32,493 --> 01:08:34,290
-Where?
-Noons' pIace.

884
01:08:44,213 --> 01:08:45,407
Shit.

885
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:48,766
This is a frame-up.

886
01:08:49,093 --> 01:08:49,843
Is it?

887
01:08:49,933 --> 01:08:51,651
Anybody couId have got those coins.

888
01:08:51,733 --> 01:08:54,611
They couId've got them
when I was at the store or something.

889
01:08:54,693 --> 01:08:56,604
They couId've taken them off my desk.

890
01:08:56,693 --> 01:08:58,763
We aIways said it couId be a cop.

891
01:09:00,573 --> 01:09:02,211
We did aIways say that.

892
01:09:02,733 --> 01:09:04,451
I'm not stupid, you know.

893
01:09:05,093 --> 01:09:07,482
I know you know more than you're saying.

894
01:09:07,733 --> 01:09:08,848
So teII me.

895
01:09:12,053 --> 01:09:13,930
You don't reaIIy want to know.

896
01:09:14,013 --> 01:09:17,210
You'd have to be there.
I was there and I don't even want to know.

897
01:09:17,293 --> 01:09:18,442
Try me.

898
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:26,085
You remember Robert MiIano?

899
01:09:26,373 --> 01:09:27,522
Listen to me.

900
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:30,127
This is exactIy what happened to him.

901
01:09:32,013 --> 01:09:33,287
He was framed.

902
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:38,525
I'II give you some advice.

903
01:09:39,813 --> 01:09:41,883
Let go of it for a coupIe of hours.

904
01:09:42,173 --> 01:09:43,401
Go home.

905
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:45,286
See your famiIy.

906
01:09:45,773 --> 01:09:47,206
Take a Ioad off.

907
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:56,291
The hell with Stanton.

908
01:09:56,853 --> 01:09:58,571
The hell with all of them.

909
01:09:58,893 --> 01:10:01,566
Nobody likes to get
the shit kicked out of them.

910
01:10:01,653 --> 01:10:04,008
Nobody likes to get hit from every angle.

911
01:10:04,093 --> 01:10:07,244
But eviljust keeps on coming.
You know what I mean?

912
01:10:07,733 --> 01:10:09,803
You saw it before, but now...

913
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:13,490
...it's in your face, laughing at you.

914
01:10:16,373 --> 01:10:18,125
-Hi, Unc.
-Hey, Sam.

915
01:10:19,693 --> 01:10:20,762
How're you doing?

916
01:10:20,853 --> 01:10:22,081
Hi, Mr. Hobbes.

917
01:10:23,933 --> 01:10:25,525
You're home earIy today.

918
01:10:26,413 --> 01:10:27,687
For a change.

919
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:57,129
-Did you move my address book?
-What?

920
01:10:57,213 --> 01:10:58,202
No.

921
01:10:59,253 --> 01:11:00,368
What?

922
01:11:06,573 --> 01:11:08,325
What's wrong with your eye?

923
01:11:12,933 --> 01:11:14,571
Who hit you in the eye?

924
01:11:15,373 --> 01:11:16,362
I feII.

925
01:11:16,933 --> 01:11:17,968
You feII?

926
01:11:19,293 --> 01:11:20,965
I feII, or something.

927
01:11:22,173 --> 01:11:24,209
PeopIe don't faII down and get a bIack eye.

928
01:11:24,293 --> 01:11:25,726
-No?
-No.

929
01:11:28,173 --> 01:11:29,572
AII right, it's okay.

930
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:31,132
It's okay. Look....

931
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,641
What happened?

932
01:11:35,133 --> 01:11:36,361
Sammy hit me.

933
01:11:36,613 --> 01:11:37,523
What?

934
01:11:37,613 --> 01:11:40,366
It was an accident though.
He didn't mean to.

935
01:11:40,973 --> 01:11:42,645
He didn't mean to.

936
01:11:44,453 --> 01:11:46,330
It was an accident. It was an accident!

937
01:11:46,413 --> 01:11:47,971
John...John!

938
01:11:48,173 --> 01:11:49,208
Sam?

939
01:11:50,613 --> 01:11:52,126
Where's Toby?

940
01:11:52,573 --> 01:11:54,211
Outside, I guess.

941
01:11:55,133 --> 01:11:56,885
Okay, go back in the house.

942
01:12:03,933 --> 01:12:05,605
-Toby?
-Hey, Hobbes.

943
01:12:11,693 --> 01:12:13,809
Leave my famiIy aIone, you hear me?

944
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,448
Go back in the house.

945
01:12:15,533 --> 01:12:17,842
-What's going on?
-Go back in the house!

946
01:12:23,133 --> 01:12:25,169
-You Ieave my famiIy aIone.
-Why?

947
01:12:25,573 --> 01:12:28,883
You came after me.
Now I'm coming after you and yours.

948
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:54,525
Toby, you aII right?

949
01:12:55,173 --> 01:12:56,492
Go right home. Go.

950
01:12:56,573 --> 01:12:58,006
-Okay, I wiII.
-Run!

951
01:13:20,093 --> 01:13:22,971
What's the matter, paI?
Are you afraid to fight me?

952
01:13:24,053 --> 01:13:25,964
Come on, Hobbes. Come on out.

953
01:13:27,453 --> 01:13:28,772
Come on, Hobbes.

954
01:13:30,053 --> 01:13:31,406
Put the gun down.

955
01:13:33,173 --> 01:13:34,401
I knew you'd come out.

956
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,211
Put the gun on the ground!

957
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:37,812
I know you, Hobbes.

958
01:13:37,893 --> 01:13:39,451
Set the gun down, sir!

959
01:13:44,533 --> 01:13:46,125
Put the gun down!

960
01:14:52,573 --> 01:14:53,688
"Yes, it is

961
01:14:54,813 --> 01:14:56,246
"Time

962
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,529
"Is on my side"

963
01:14:59,973 --> 01:15:01,122
Hey, paI.

964
01:15:02,493 --> 01:15:03,767
Wake up, Hobbes.

965
01:15:03,973 --> 01:15:05,645
I'm not that easy to kiII.

966
01:15:05,893 --> 01:15:09,966
When my host dies and I move as spirit,
no man can resist me.

967
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:14,410
What are you going to do, arrest me?
What'II you teII Stanton?

968
01:15:14,493 --> 01:15:16,245
I'd Iove to hear that one.

969
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:18,365
It's me you want, isn't it?

970
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:20,571
Why don't you just kiII me?

971
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,571
But I'm stiII having fun.

972
01:15:23,453 --> 01:15:25,250
Aren't you stiII having fun?

973
01:16:14,293 --> 01:16:16,488
He was standing in the street,
yeIIing at him...

974
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:19,326
...shooting at him.
FinaIIy, when the officer....

975
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:21,732
I guess that's it.

976
01:16:28,973 --> 01:16:31,441
There's no question
that the dead man shot first?

977
01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:34,969
No question at aII. My wife saw it too,
if you want to ask her.

978
01:16:37,013 --> 01:16:38,332
A schooIteacher.

979
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,492
What am I going to say?

980
01:16:42,573 --> 01:16:44,131
What am I going to do?

981
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:48,082
We know that he fired first.
Witnesses corroborate.

982
01:16:48,253 --> 01:16:52,132
But his gun was fiIIed with bIanks.
He got the gun out of a stoIen car.

983
01:16:52,213 --> 01:16:53,771
-It was a setup.
-A setup?

984
01:16:53,853 --> 01:16:55,366
That's right. A setup.

985
01:16:55,453 --> 01:16:57,250
He set it up for you to kiII him?

986
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:58,527
Committing suicide by--

987
01:16:58,613 --> 01:16:59,682
Excuse me.

988
01:17:01,973 --> 01:17:04,089
What the heII are you doing out here?

989
01:17:04,173 --> 01:17:07,051
You take Sam home, Iock every door,
every window....

990
01:17:07,133 --> 01:17:09,647
You don't Iet anybody in. Can you do that?

991
01:17:10,093 --> 01:17:12,288
Can you remember that? AII right, do it.

992
01:17:12,373 --> 01:17:13,806
-Johnny?
-Yeah?

993
01:17:14,773 --> 01:17:16,729
Are you mad at me or something?

994
01:17:17,373 --> 01:17:19,045
No, Art. Never. Just....

995
01:17:20,453 --> 01:17:21,886
Do what I toId you.

996
01:17:26,293 --> 01:17:29,091
Hate to see the mighty faII,
you know what I mean?

997
01:17:29,493 --> 01:17:31,882
Now it's Ietters. Fuck you, Lou.

998
01:17:32,973 --> 01:17:34,691
I toId you, it's a cuIt.

999
01:17:35,013 --> 01:17:38,767
Some weird, psycho,
Aramaic-Satanist reincarnation cuIt.

1000
01:17:39,253 --> 01:17:41,403
He's got A-P-O written on his chest.

1001
01:17:42,133 --> 01:17:44,567
Trying to send some kind of message.

1002
01:17:46,933 --> 01:17:48,889
The kiIIer's sending a message?

1003
01:17:50,293 --> 01:17:51,692
Hobbes....

1004
01:17:53,013 --> 01:17:54,890
This time, you are the kiIIer.

1005
01:17:56,453 --> 01:17:57,408
Yeah, sort of.

1006
01:17:57,493 --> 01:17:59,006
No fucking "sort of."

1007
01:17:59,213 --> 01:18:01,363
No breaks. No benefit of the doubt.

1008
01:18:01,853 --> 01:18:04,572
We're going back to the precinct. Now.

1009
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:18,201
Tonight, another shocking murder
in the city.

1010
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:22,605
A well-respected schoolteacher
opened fire on an off-duty police officer.

1011
01:18:22,813 --> 01:18:24,007
The officer...

1012
01:18:24,293 --> 01:18:27,046
...John Hobbes, was forced to return fire.

1013
01:18:27,493 --> 01:18:29,449
Our report now, from the scene.

1014
01:18:29,813 --> 01:18:33,169
We're on the scene
of a most unusual homicide tonight.

1015
01:18:33,613 --> 01:18:34,887
CIose the door.

1016
01:18:35,053 --> 01:18:38,090
Detective Hobbes shot and killed
a high-school math teacher.

1017
01:18:38,173 --> 01:18:40,323
The police have not yet identified him.

1018
01:18:40,413 --> 01:18:43,371
According to witnesses,
the man started shouting at Hobbes...

1019
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:45,444
...who was off duty at the time.

1020
01:18:47,173 --> 01:18:49,368
I taIked to the schooIteacher's wife.

1021
01:18:50,133 --> 01:18:51,612
He got married four months ago.

1022
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:53,923
She's pregnant. He just got a raise.

1023
01:18:54,493 --> 01:18:56,609
So much for suicide by a cop!

1024
01:19:02,253 --> 01:19:04,483
The shooting team wiII need your gun.

1025
01:19:05,053 --> 01:19:07,283
I'II get the hearing as soon as I can.

1026
01:19:08,573 --> 01:19:10,370
PeopIe want the worId to make sense.

1027
01:19:10,453 --> 01:19:14,810
If the onIy way I can get the worId
to make sense for me is to arrest you...

1028
01:19:15,453 --> 01:19:17,205
...then I'II have to do it.

1029
01:19:21,013 --> 01:19:22,685
Get the fuck out of here.

1030
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:06,283
-It was a cIean shoot.
-Yeah, I know.

1031
01:20:06,373 --> 01:20:08,204
It doesn't heIp, but I know.

1032
01:20:09,693 --> 01:20:10,728
Coffee?

1033
01:20:11,013 --> 01:20:12,207
No, thanks.

1034
01:20:12,773 --> 01:20:17,130
Want to taIk? From where I sit, we're
deaIing with shit that ain't in the manuaI.

1035
01:20:20,213 --> 01:20:23,649
Where do they buy coffee with dirt in it?
Can you teII me that?

1036
01:20:27,933 --> 01:20:29,764
What's the point of Iife?

1037
01:20:31,053 --> 01:20:32,566
-"The point"?
-Yeah.

1038
01:20:35,173 --> 01:20:36,686
-"Of Iife"?
-Yeah.

1039
01:20:39,613 --> 01:20:41,285
The point of Iife.... You want a cigarette?

1040
01:20:41,373 --> 01:20:42,488
No, thanks.

1041
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:48,447
The point of Iife is we catch bad guys.

1042
01:20:48,573 --> 01:20:50,370
That's what I used to think.

1043
01:20:52,293 --> 01:20:53,806
It's not good enough.

1044
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:56,527
You can shoot me for taIking Iike this, but--

1045
01:20:57,373 --> 01:21:00,809
It's two o'cIock in the morning.
You can taIk any way you want.

1046
01:21:02,653 --> 01:21:05,326
What are we doing here?
You know what I'm saying?

1047
01:21:05,413 --> 01:21:06,732
Why do we even exist?

1048
01:21:06,813 --> 01:21:07,768
Us.

1049
01:21:09,773 --> 01:21:11,445
Maybe it's God, Hobbes.

1050
01:21:12,453 --> 01:21:13,852
Yeah, it couId be.

1051
01:21:16,693 --> 01:21:19,127
I have a hard time beIieving that we're...

1052
01:21:19,893 --> 01:21:21,724
...part of some huge...

1053
01:21:22,533 --> 01:21:26,242
...moraI experiment, you know,
conducted by a greater being than us.

1054
01:21:26,613 --> 01:21:30,526
If there's a greater being than we are,
why does he give a shit about us?

1055
01:21:30,733 --> 01:21:34,089
There are five biIIion of us.
We're Iike ants. Do we care...

1056
01:21:34,293 --> 01:21:36,568
...what ants do, from a moraI standpoint?

1057
01:21:36,653 --> 01:21:37,802
"Ants"? No.

1058
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:42,049
I'm foIIowing you,
but at the same time I'm Iosing you.

1059
01:21:42,533 --> 01:21:44,285
Are you heading somepIace here?

1060
01:21:44,373 --> 01:21:45,886
That's my point.

1061
01:21:46,373 --> 01:21:47,965
Are we headed somepIace?

1062
01:21:48,693 --> 01:21:50,570
If we don't figure it out....

1063
01:21:52,893 --> 01:21:54,770
Maybe if you figure it out...

1064
01:21:56,373 --> 01:21:57,442
...you die.

1065
01:21:57,533 --> 01:22:00,366
Heart attack, stroke.
You figure out what's what...

1066
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:04,410
...you don't get to hang around anymore.
You get promoted.

1067
01:22:06,293 --> 01:22:07,885
MeanwhiIe, DeIores...

1068
01:22:09,213 --> 01:22:11,249
...says we're put here to do one thing.

1069
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:12,402
One thing?

1070
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:14,322
What's that?

1071
01:22:14,413 --> 01:22:17,962
It's different. It's different for everybody.
Hers is Iasagna.

1072
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:19,482
Lasagna?

1073
01:22:20,893 --> 01:22:22,724
And just one thing, not two or...?

1074
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:25,407
Maybe two, I don't know.
It's just her opinion.

1075
01:22:26,213 --> 01:22:27,487
But it's Iike...

1076
01:22:29,093 --> 01:22:30,811
...when a moment comes...

1077
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:34,283
...we either do the right thing...

1078
01:22:35,013 --> 01:22:36,162
...or wrong.

1079
01:22:37,853 --> 01:22:40,162
When do you know
when your moment comes?

1080
01:22:50,413 --> 01:22:51,892
So, Iike this couId be it for me?

1081
01:22:51,973 --> 01:22:54,089
That's the beauty. You never know.

1082
01:22:56,893 --> 01:22:58,042
-HeIIo?
-John?

1083
01:22:58,333 --> 01:22:59,607
Is that you?

1084
01:23:01,533 --> 01:23:04,252
Hi. I just wanted to see if you were okay.

1085
01:23:05,293 --> 01:23:07,682
I'II caII you back. I'II caII you Iater.

1086
01:23:15,013 --> 01:23:17,732
That was the kiIIer.
We'II arrange things Iater.

1087
01:23:29,173 --> 01:23:30,367
I'm going home.

1088
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:33,406
Yeah, fuck it.

1089
01:23:47,053 --> 01:23:48,406
I killed someone.

1090
01:23:48,733 --> 01:23:50,769
He got me to kill an innocent man.

1091
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:52,801
I know.

1092
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:54,851
What do they want, Gretta?

1093
01:23:55,493 --> 01:23:57,245
Just tell me what they want.

1094
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:58,652
The demons?

1095
01:23:59,093 --> 01:24:01,004
They want the fall of civilization.

1096
01:24:01,093 --> 01:24:03,482
"The fall of Babylon, " as they put it.

1097
01:24:03,973 --> 01:24:05,645
-The whole thing?
-Yeah.

1098
01:24:06,853 --> 01:24:09,128
They're doing a goodjob, aren't they?

1099
01:24:09,493 --> 01:24:11,723
You know, after I shot the teacher...

1100
01:24:12,453 --> 01:24:14,125
...Azazel moved to someone else.

1101
01:24:14,213 --> 01:24:16,522
Are you sure? After death?

1102
01:24:16,853 --> 01:24:19,413
I'm positive. After death. Yeah, I saw it.

1103
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:20,562
Listen to this.

1104
01:24:20,653 --> 01:24:23,531
I was looking through
one ofyour father's books...

1105
01:24:23,893 --> 01:24:28,125
...and it says "outside"...
I guess that means outside the body.

1106
01:24:29,293 --> 01:24:32,444
"Outside, they can survive
for one breath only. "

1107
01:24:33,173 --> 01:24:36,688
A Hebrew text says that the breath
can carry them for 500 cubits.

1108
01:24:37,013 --> 01:24:38,571
I never knew what it meant.

1109
01:24:38,653 --> 01:24:41,167
A cubit, that's a distance
or something, right?

1110
01:24:41,253 --> 01:24:43,164
From your elbow to your fingertips.

1111
01:24:43,253 --> 01:24:47,087
So 500 cubits would be what?
About a sixth of a mile?

1112
01:24:47,293 --> 01:24:49,329
Yeah, well, you're right then.

1113
01:24:50,613 --> 01:24:52,683
They are Iimited in certain ways.

1114
01:24:54,933 --> 01:24:56,491
What are you thinking?

1115
01:24:57,413 --> 01:24:58,607
I don't know.

1116
01:25:01,213 --> 01:25:03,249
I don't know. Are you okay?

1117
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:05,322
Yeah.

1118
01:25:05,893 --> 01:25:07,565
All right. Well, then...

1119
01:25:08,133 --> 01:25:10,442
...maybe I'II check up on you tomorrow.

1120
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:13,848
Good night.

1121
01:25:13,933 --> 01:25:15,048
Good night.

1122
01:25:37,853 --> 01:25:39,252
Good morning, Sam.

1123
01:25:40,533 --> 01:25:41,682
Good morning, Sam.

1124
01:25:41,773 --> 01:25:43,126
Oh, hi, UncIe John.

1125
01:25:43,213 --> 01:25:44,202
Oh, hi.

1126
01:25:44,493 --> 01:25:47,485
-Thanks for tucking me in Iast night.
-You're weIcome.

1127
01:25:49,893 --> 01:25:52,088
We sent Michael Aaron to the scene...

1128
01:25:52,173 --> 01:25:56,212
...where he'll be ready with a live report
shortly. We'll be right back.

1129
01:26:46,853 --> 01:26:49,083
Were you asIeep when I tucked you in?

1130
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:53,008
I don't know. AII I remember
was somebody tickIing me.

1131
01:26:53,253 --> 01:26:54,652
TickIing my chest.

1132
01:27:00,493 --> 01:27:02,006
Why'd you write that?

1133
01:27:04,493 --> 01:27:06,404
-Where's your father?
-In the bedroom.

1134
01:27:06,493 --> 01:27:07,892
He's a sIeepyhead.

1135
01:27:13,013 --> 01:27:15,971
Ifyou watched the national news
just last week...

1136
01:27:16,133 --> 01:27:18,442
...you might have seen
a similar case in Boston...

1137
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:21,093
...of a decorated cop accused of murder.

1138
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:33,443
HeIIo?

1139
01:29:33,773 --> 01:29:35,411
Have you seen the news?

1140
01:29:35,533 --> 01:29:38,650
The cop was shooting first.
And he kept on shooting.

1141
01:29:40,013 --> 01:29:41,492
Lou's coming to get you.

1142
01:29:41,573 --> 01:29:43,643
He'II bring you down
for more conversation.

1143
01:29:43,733 --> 01:29:44,961
-Lou?
-No.

1144
01:29:45,293 --> 01:29:47,488
-They get him yet?
-No. Not yet.

1145
01:29:49,373 --> 01:29:50,806
I gotta go.

1146
01:30:26,973 --> 01:30:29,567
Here. Put these cIothes on.
Get dressed right away.

1147
01:30:29,653 --> 01:30:31,928
-Why?
-Just do what I teII you, pIease!

1148
01:30:41,213 --> 01:30:42,248
Are you ready?

1149
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:44,563
AImost. What's going on here?

1150
01:30:44,733 --> 01:30:48,043
We're just going to pIay
a IittIe trick on somebody.

1151
01:30:48,413 --> 01:30:49,368
CooI.

1152
01:30:54,253 --> 01:30:56,005
We're going out the window.

1153
01:30:59,133 --> 01:31:00,486
What about my dad?

1154
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:04,847
He's sIeeping. He's stiII asIeep.

1155
01:31:50,453 --> 01:31:53,126
-Excuse me, Sister. How're you doing?
-Good.

1156
01:31:53,493 --> 01:31:54,448
Good.

1157
01:31:55,733 --> 01:31:58,247
Does "apocaIypse" mean anything to you?

1158
01:31:58,933 --> 01:32:00,082
Sure it does.

1159
01:32:00,253 --> 01:32:03,051
"ApocaIypse" was the Greek word
for "reveIation."

1160
01:32:03,573 --> 01:32:04,847
"ReveIation"?

1161
01:32:05,813 --> 01:32:08,168
-You mean Iike the book of the BibIe?
-Yes.

1162
01:32:08,253 --> 01:32:09,322
ReveIation.

1163
01:32:09,493 --> 01:32:11,051
AII right. Thank you.

1164
01:32:40,293 --> 01:32:41,692
Pack of cigarettes.

1165
01:32:42,133 --> 01:32:44,124
-Any speciaI kind?
-No, any kind.

1166
01:32:44,733 --> 01:32:46,451
Okay, out of five.

1167
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:50,686
Detective Hobbes?

1168
01:32:51,373 --> 01:32:52,886
Sir, you forgot your change.

1169
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:54,452
Detective Hobbes.

1170
01:32:54,813 --> 01:32:56,326
I want to taIk to you.

1171
01:33:00,133 --> 01:33:03,284
Go, Sam. Run! Down the stairs,
down the stairs! Go!

1172
01:33:03,733 --> 01:33:05,371
AII units in the area--

1173
01:33:43,053 --> 01:33:45,123
Why don't you cIose that coat up?

1174
01:33:56,893 --> 01:33:58,008
Cigarettes?

1175
01:33:58,413 --> 01:34:01,052
I thought you quit.
I thought they were bad for you.

1176
01:34:01,133 --> 01:34:03,283
I did quit and they are bad for you.

1177
01:34:06,613 --> 01:34:08,251
You know what's going on?

1178
01:34:13,133 --> 01:34:16,489
The poIice think that I did some bad things.

1179
01:34:17,973 --> 01:34:20,009
-You are the poIice.
-Not anymore.

1180
01:34:21,453 --> 01:34:22,932
Why do they think you did that?

1181
01:34:23,013 --> 01:34:24,082
Because....

1182
01:34:25,453 --> 01:34:27,284
Because somebody...

1183
01:34:28,213 --> 01:34:29,965
...made it Iook Iike I did.

1184
01:34:30,533 --> 01:34:32,330
I once saw that on a show.

1185
01:34:41,853 --> 01:34:44,572
I want to taIk to you
about something eIse, too.

1186
01:34:45,293 --> 01:34:46,521
About your dad.

1187
01:34:50,573 --> 01:34:52,211
He's not asIeep, is he?

1188
01:34:55,893 --> 01:34:57,565
No, son. He's not asIeep.

1189
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:00,961
Did it hurt?

1190
01:35:04,453 --> 01:35:05,806
I don't think so.

1191
01:35:07,533 --> 01:35:10,047
-Do you think he's gonna go to Heaven?
-Yes.

1192
01:35:10,653 --> 01:35:11,768
Yes, I do.

1193
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:15,211
If anybody deserves to go to Heaven,
it's your dad.

1194
01:35:18,013 --> 01:35:19,446
I think so, too.

1195
01:35:49,493 --> 01:35:51,370
We've got no pIace eIse to go.

1196
01:35:51,453 --> 01:35:53,045
This is my nephew, Sam.

1197
01:35:54,893 --> 01:35:56,690
Okay. Hi, Sam.

1198
01:35:56,853 --> 01:35:58,764
Nice to meet you. I'm Gretta.

1199
01:36:01,533 --> 01:36:03,125
You're in your pajamas.

1200
01:36:03,533 --> 01:36:06,491
I wasn't expecting company,
but I'm gIad you're here.

1201
01:36:09,413 --> 01:36:13,292
Why don't you go over there
by the firepIace and get warm.

1202
01:36:14,213 --> 01:36:15,885
AzazeI wrote on his chest.

1203
01:36:15,973 --> 01:36:17,611
UnIess I do something--

1204
01:36:19,813 --> 01:36:21,326
I'II get you a coffee.

1205
01:36:21,413 --> 01:36:22,448
Thank you.

1206
01:37:23,133 --> 01:37:25,852
I think I got my mind
around this thing now, but Iet me...

1207
01:37:25,933 --> 01:37:27,924
...Iet me run this by you, okay?

1208
01:37:28,853 --> 01:37:30,809
After the host body dies...

1209
01:37:31,613 --> 01:37:34,969
...the demon can survive
for one breath or 500 cubits, right?

1210
01:37:35,133 --> 01:37:36,361
At the same time...

1211
01:37:36,453 --> 01:37:40,128
...AzazeI says to me when he moves
as spirit no man can resist.

1212
01:37:40,213 --> 01:37:43,683
So someone he can't get into by touch,
he can stiII get into by spirit.

1213
01:37:43,773 --> 01:37:47,402
Because, if when he's in spirit form...

1214
01:37:48,053 --> 01:37:52,092
...he's fighting for his Iife,
he's going to be that much more powerfuI.

1215
01:37:55,613 --> 01:37:57,922
PIease teII me what you're going to do.

1216
01:37:58,013 --> 01:37:59,446
Whatever I do...

1217
01:37:59,813 --> 01:38:03,931
...I have to make sure
that you and Sam are safe.

1218
01:38:05,093 --> 01:38:06,731
Will you take him somewhere...

1219
01:38:06,813 --> 01:38:08,405
...nobody knows about?

1220
01:38:09,253 --> 01:38:10,368
Even me.

1221
01:38:25,093 --> 01:38:26,321
Listen....

1222
01:38:29,053 --> 01:38:30,168
I gotta go.

1223
01:38:31,453 --> 01:38:34,092
You're gonna stay with Gretta
for a IittIe whiIe.

1224
01:38:34,173 --> 01:38:35,811
Maybe for a Iong whiIe.

1225
01:38:37,533 --> 01:38:39,410
And I want you to remember this:

1226
01:38:39,493 --> 01:38:41,688
Whatever peopIe say about me...

1227
01:38:43,293 --> 01:38:44,931
...or whatever I do...

1228
01:38:46,333 --> 01:38:49,450
...I just want you to remember
that I'm doing it for you.

1229
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:51,891
Because I Iove you.

1230
01:38:52,893 --> 01:38:54,167
You understand?

1231
01:38:58,493 --> 01:39:00,370
I'm gonna go back to sIeep...

1232
01:39:01,213 --> 01:39:05,331
...and when I wake up
everything is gonna be just the way it was.

1233
01:39:40,333 --> 01:39:41,402
Thank you.

1234
01:39:43,813 --> 01:39:45,804
You know what this means, right?

1235
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:48,527
I'm ready.

1236
01:40:26,333 --> 01:40:27,846
Hey, Jonesy, how're you doing?

1237
01:40:27,933 --> 01:40:29,571
Look, I'm worried, man.

1238
01:40:30,133 --> 01:40:32,124
What are you gonna do?
Where are you gonna go?

1239
01:40:32,213 --> 01:40:33,965
I'm going nowhere.

1240
01:40:34,693 --> 01:40:36,604
I'm taking a Iong drive...

1241
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:39,529
...where nobody wiII find me...

1242
01:40:39,613 --> 01:40:42,127
...and sit by the water and think.

1243
01:40:42,693 --> 01:40:44,445
I gotta ask you something.

1244
01:40:44,813 --> 01:40:46,132
Yeah, shoot.

1245
01:40:46,573 --> 01:40:48,564
We've been partners a long time.

1246
01:40:48,693 --> 01:40:51,366
Twelve plus, Jonesy. Twelve plus.

1247
01:40:51,973 --> 01:40:54,931
So, is there anything you gotta tell me?

1248
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:59,330
Yeah, remember what
we were talking about the other night?

1249
01:41:00,133 --> 01:41:01,885
When the moment comes...

1250
01:41:02,333 --> 01:41:03,652
...you know it.

1251
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:06,846
Be careful, okay?

1252
01:41:07,573 --> 01:41:09,086
I'll see you, partner.

1253
01:41:09,413 --> 01:41:10,607
Yeah, you too.

1254
01:41:11,493 --> 01:41:12,642
Be good.

1255
01:41:41,933 --> 01:41:44,367
You're probably wondering:
What am I doing?

1256
01:41:45,773 --> 01:41:48,207
This is where things get a little tricky.

1257
01:41:48,533 --> 01:41:50,444
It'sjust him and me now.

1258
01:41:51,013 --> 01:41:53,004
Hobbes versus Azazel.

1259
01:41:55,333 --> 01:41:56,766
I thought I had him.

1260
01:41:57,173 --> 01:41:59,084
But he thought he had me, too.

1261
01:43:49,693 --> 01:43:50,921
Come on out.

1262
01:43:51,493 --> 01:43:53,245
I know you're here.

1263
01:43:54,533 --> 01:43:56,046
I knew you'd come.

1264
01:44:06,853 --> 01:44:08,650
Haven't you done enough?

1265
01:44:11,973 --> 01:44:14,407
You made me kiII an innocent man. You...

1266
01:44:17,533 --> 01:44:19,251
...murdered my brother!

1267
01:44:20,293 --> 01:44:22,409
Come out, you son of a bitch!

1268
01:44:23,253 --> 01:44:25,403
How much more fun can you have!

1269
01:44:29,773 --> 01:44:31,570
Jesus, Hobbes.

1270
01:44:33,093 --> 01:44:35,561
What are you taIking about?

1271
01:44:37,733 --> 01:44:39,485
I didn't do any of that.

1272
01:44:40,973 --> 01:44:44,932
Me, I'm the poor schmo
they sent up here to bring you in.

1273
01:44:47,053 --> 01:44:48,611
So it's you now.

1274
01:44:48,933 --> 01:44:50,082
It's me.

1275
01:44:50,213 --> 01:44:52,044
Who'd you expect it'd be?

1276
01:44:53,213 --> 01:44:55,044
Now drop your gun, Hobbes.

1277
01:44:55,773 --> 01:44:57,525
I know you've got one.

1278
01:44:58,133 --> 01:44:59,327
Or what?

1279
01:44:59,853 --> 01:45:01,127
You'II shoot me?

1280
01:45:02,613 --> 01:45:04,251
Where is the fun in that?

1281
01:45:04,733 --> 01:45:06,007
Fuck you, huh?

1282
01:45:06,573 --> 01:45:08,404
You're making me do this.

1283
01:45:08,853 --> 01:45:11,003
Now, drop the goddamn gun.

1284
01:45:11,133 --> 01:45:12,725
Do what he says, Hobbes.

1285
01:45:17,773 --> 01:45:18,922
Jonesy?

1286
01:45:30,253 --> 01:45:32,164
Who eIse is out here, huh?

1287
01:45:32,253 --> 01:45:33,845
Lou? Tiff? Come on out!

1288
01:45:33,933 --> 01:45:35,764
No, it's just the two of us.

1289
01:45:39,133 --> 01:45:40,407
The gun, Hobbes.

1290
01:46:05,973 --> 01:46:08,043
Jonesy, you know I didn't do this.

1291
01:46:08,853 --> 01:46:11,003
You know I didn't do any of it.

1292
01:46:11,333 --> 01:46:12,732
I know that, Hobbes.

1293
01:46:12,813 --> 01:46:16,283
We both want to beIieve you,
but we've gotta bring you in.

1294
01:46:28,813 --> 01:46:30,087
Stan....

1295
01:46:31,133 --> 01:46:33,044
I don't know if I can do this.

1296
01:46:34,333 --> 01:46:36,210
What the fuck you taIking...?

1297
01:46:36,733 --> 01:46:39,122
Say Hobbes disappears into the woods....

1298
01:46:39,653 --> 01:46:43,202
We drive his car into the Iake.
End of story. What's wrong with that?

1299
01:46:43,293 --> 01:46:46,205
We bring the son of a bitch in.
That's why we're up here.

1300
01:46:46,293 --> 01:46:47,567
He did it, fine.

1301
01:46:47,693 --> 01:46:49,524
He didn't do it, even better.

1302
01:46:49,613 --> 01:46:53,322
But it's not our job to decide.
Now drop the goddamn gun!

1303
01:46:57,613 --> 01:46:58,887
Jonesy?

1304
01:47:01,253 --> 01:47:03,005
Put the goddamn gun down.

1305
01:47:12,853 --> 01:47:14,002
Okay.

1306
01:47:29,173 --> 01:47:30,208
Thank you.

1307
01:47:35,413 --> 01:47:36,766
I'm sorry, Stan.

1308
01:47:37,373 --> 01:47:40,968
Been on the force so many years you think
you've seen it aII, but you haven't.

1309
01:47:41,053 --> 01:47:42,850
Life aIways gives you one more surprise.

1310
01:47:42,933 --> 01:47:44,048
One more.

1311
01:47:50,293 --> 01:47:51,965
Sometimes it's a big one.

1312
01:47:52,853 --> 01:47:53,842
AzazeI.

1313
01:47:55,093 --> 01:47:56,685
I'm your partner, man.

1314
01:47:57,013 --> 01:47:58,366
You're free. Run.

1315
01:48:00,133 --> 01:48:01,691
Keep thinking, Hobbes.

1316
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:08,012
How about that!

1317
01:48:09,133 --> 01:48:11,601
Jonesy's fucked. He just kiIIed his boss.

1318
01:48:13,813 --> 01:48:15,292
Jonesy's fucked!

1319
01:48:15,413 --> 01:48:16,766
You're fucked!

1320
01:48:17,173 --> 01:48:18,572
One at a time, huh?

1321
01:48:19,013 --> 01:48:21,083
That's how we do it. One by one.

1322
01:48:22,573 --> 01:48:24,689
OIIy-oIIy-oxen-free!

1323
01:48:26,533 --> 01:48:28,205
"Time

1324
01:48:29,693 --> 01:48:31,843
"Is on my side

1325
01:48:32,333 --> 01:48:34,164
"Yes, it is

1326
01:48:34,613 --> 01:48:36,251
"Time

1327
01:48:37,293 --> 01:48:38,726
"Is on my side"

1328
01:48:38,813 --> 01:48:40,644
You Iike the Stones, Hobbes?

1329
01:48:40,973 --> 01:48:43,851
I bet you didn't, you big Monkee-fan pussy.

1330
01:48:49,133 --> 01:48:50,407
Time's up!

1331
01:48:51,853 --> 01:48:53,491
See the deaI?

1332
01:48:54,533 --> 01:48:56,251
If I kiII you...

1333
01:48:58,573 --> 01:49:00,211
...it's just the finaI...

1334
01:49:00,493 --> 01:49:02,085
...pathetic chapter...

1335
01:49:02,533 --> 01:49:04,808
...in the Iife of a disgraced hero.

1336
01:49:06,293 --> 01:49:08,887
Just one more piece of shit, human scum.

1337
01:49:10,893 --> 01:49:12,087
But...

1338
01:49:12,173 --> 01:49:13,572
...turn it around.

1339
01:49:15,053 --> 01:49:16,327
If I die...

1340
01:49:20,813 --> 01:49:22,405
...I enter you...

1341
01:49:23,373 --> 01:49:25,603
...put 20 more murders on your tab...

1342
01:49:26,333 --> 01:49:27,846
...before you go down.

1343
01:49:29,893 --> 01:49:32,088
Maybe your nephew or that...

1344
01:49:33,813 --> 01:49:35,690
...chippy you were taIking to.

1345
01:49:37,413 --> 01:49:39,847
How do you want to do this?
I die, you die?

1346
01:49:40,013 --> 01:49:42,243
What's maximum fun? Can you guess...

1347
01:49:44,013 --> 01:49:45,765
...what maximum fun is?

1348
01:49:47,013 --> 01:49:48,332
Sure you can.

1349
01:49:50,133 --> 01:49:52,522
Now that I've pIayed you
from the outside...

1350
01:49:52,613 --> 01:49:54,410
...maximum fun is...

1351
01:49:54,933 --> 01:49:56,651
...I become you.

1352
01:50:28,493 --> 01:50:31,291
You got me, Hobbes. You got me good.

1353
01:50:33,373 --> 01:50:35,284
But I gotta ask you something.

1354
01:50:35,973 --> 01:50:38,533
You wouIdn't Iet me kiII myseIf.
Why is that?

1355
01:50:38,653 --> 01:50:40,325
Because I need more time.

1356
01:50:40,453 --> 01:50:42,091
Time for what, asshoIe?

1357
01:50:43,973 --> 01:50:46,612
Five hundred cubits.
That's a Iong way, AzazeI.

1358
01:50:47,173 --> 01:50:49,004
If Jonesy dies too fast...

1359
01:50:49,133 --> 01:50:50,964
...as powerfuI as you are...

1360
01:50:52,133 --> 01:50:53,964
...I might never get away from you.

1361
01:50:54,053 --> 01:50:56,009
Oh, he's catching on.

1362
01:50:56,933 --> 01:50:59,128
What? You think you're going to win?

1363
01:51:00,413 --> 01:51:01,641
God wiIIing.

1364
01:51:08,133 --> 01:51:09,612
You never know.

1365
01:51:16,493 --> 01:51:18,211
Let me ask you something.

1366
01:51:22,973 --> 01:51:24,611
Why do you think...

1367
01:51:25,453 --> 01:51:26,852
...MiIano...

1368
01:51:27,333 --> 01:51:29,244
...came aII the way out here...

1369
01:51:29,613 --> 01:51:31,012
...in the middIe of nowhere?

1370
01:51:31,093 --> 01:51:33,049
To die, the IittIe chickenshit.

1371
01:51:34,653 --> 01:51:36,006
I don't think so.

1372
01:51:37,613 --> 01:51:39,683
I think that he wanted to do...

1373
01:51:40,293 --> 01:51:41,885
...what I'm going to do.

1374
01:51:42,373 --> 01:51:45,092
-OnIy he couIdn't puII it off.
-PuII what off?

1375
01:51:45,253 --> 01:51:46,811
Oh, come on, AzazeI.

1376
01:51:48,133 --> 01:51:49,885
Open your eyes.

1377
01:51:51,653 --> 01:51:53,132
Look around sometime.

1378
01:51:54,013 --> 01:51:56,766
Here we are in this beautifuI pIace...

1379
01:51:57,773 --> 01:52:00,606
...not another human being
around for miIes.

1380
01:52:01,413 --> 01:52:02,926
It's just you and me.

1381
01:52:11,173 --> 01:52:13,607
What is this? You don't smoke anymore.

1382
01:52:18,973 --> 01:52:20,611
That's right. I don't.

1383
01:52:21,733 --> 01:52:22,882
You know why?

1384
01:52:25,933 --> 01:52:27,525
Because cigarettes kiII.

1385
01:52:30,093 --> 01:52:32,482
EspeciaIIy cigarettes Iaced with poison.

1386
01:52:34,893 --> 01:52:36,008
BuIIshit.

1387
01:52:37,853 --> 01:52:40,492
Same poison that you used
to kiII my brother.

1388
01:52:44,533 --> 01:52:45,682
Fuck you.

1389
01:52:46,973 --> 01:52:48,611
It's beautifuI, isn't it?

1390
01:52:49,053 --> 01:52:50,452
Isn't it so sweet?

1391
01:52:51,213 --> 01:52:52,805
We die together...

1392
01:52:53,053 --> 01:52:54,486
...just you and me.

1393
01:53:01,573 --> 01:53:03,131
"Time

1394
01:53:05,053 --> 01:53:06,486
"Is on my side

1395
01:53:09,213 --> 01:53:10,612
"Yes, it is"

1396
01:53:10,813 --> 01:53:12,565
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1397
01:53:22,093 --> 01:53:23,492
I'm sorry, Jonesy.

1398
01:53:36,773 --> 01:53:37,888
I'm sorry.

1399
01:54:39,493 --> 01:54:42,246
So, like I said at the start...

1400
01:54:42,533 --> 01:54:43,932
...I was beaten...

1401
01:54:44,013 --> 01:54:46,527
...outsmarted, poisoned...

1402
01:54:46,613 --> 01:54:49,730
...by Detective John Hobbes.

1403
01:55:00,293 --> 01:55:04,366
Can you imagine what it feels like
to be alive for thousands ofyears...

1404
01:55:04,653 --> 01:55:07,372
...and realize you're actually going to die...

1405
01:55:07,533 --> 01:55:11,890
...because some self-righteous cop decided
he was going to save the fucking world?

1406
01:55:14,613 --> 01:55:16,365
Yes, a demon can die...

1407
01:55:16,853 --> 01:55:20,084
...and Hobbes figured out
how to beat me at my own game.

1408
01:55:20,493 --> 01:55:21,687
So what?

1409
01:55:23,213 --> 01:55:25,443
The war isn't over, I promise you.

1410
01:55:26,533 --> 01:55:28,046
Not by a long shot.

1411
01:55:45,653 --> 01:55:47,689
You forgot something, didn't you?

1412
01:55:49,653 --> 01:55:52,008
At the beginning I said
I was going to tell you...

1413
01:55:52,093 --> 01:55:55,085
...about the time I almost died.

1414
01:56:02,053 --> 01:56:03,532
See you around.

1415
