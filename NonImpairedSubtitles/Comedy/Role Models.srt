it and quit it.

bang, bang the drum.

00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:55,881
Yeah, and if she doesn't
come back, I'd go for that
friend of hers in the sweater.

773
00:31:55,992 --> 00:32:00,053
I know she's a few pounds
overweight, but, you know,
in my experience,

774
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:03,291
it's the bigger ones that
do way more stuff.

775
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,458
Good talk, Wheeler.

776
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:06,195
Pick you up at 10:00.

777
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:17,835
Hi, Ronnie.

778
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:19,472
How are you today?
What are you doing here?

779
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:20,880
I told you I'd pick
you up at 10:00, right?

780
00:32:20,984 --> 00:32:22,246
But I thought
you'd pussy out.

781
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:26,721
Well, you see? It's wonderful.
We're learning so
much about each other.

782
00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:35,188
Hey! You must be Wheeler.

783
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:36,890
I'm Karen.
Hi, Karen.

784
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,865
Wow, you look way too young
to be Ronnie's mother.

785
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:40,368
What are you,
the babysitter?

786
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,131
(GIGGLING)
You're funny.

787
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:44,764
You're gonna need that
sense of humor if you're
gonna keep up with my son.

788
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:47,604
It's about time Sturdy Wings
found someone who could.

789
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:51,772
Yeah, well,
I think that Ronnie's
a great little dude.

790
00:32:51,881 --> 00:32:54,543
"A great little dude"?
You're cute.

791
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,279
You ready, pal?

792
00:32:57,387 --> 00:32:59,116
I ain't your pal, vanilla.

793
00:32:59,656 --> 00:33:01,681
Karen, would you mind
signing my hours sheet?

794
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:03,349
Sure.
Great.

795
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:05,888
Well.

796
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:08,555
All right.
You boys have fun.

797
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:11,156
His idea of fun
is a fucking
pottery class, yo.

798
00:33:11,268 --> 00:33:14,829
Hey. Hey, hey.
Watch your mouth,
little man.

799
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:17,740
I love you.

800
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:18,967
I love you, too.

801
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:25,971
I got shotgun!

802
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:30,544
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

803
00:33:30,654 --> 00:33:32,622
Stop. Who are you?
What do you want?

804
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:35,748
I'm Danny from Sturdy Wings.
I'm here for Augie.

805
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:39,056
Oh. I'm sorry. Augie, right.
He'll be out in a minute.

806
00:33:39,162 --> 00:33:40,561
Let me ask you something,

807
00:33:40,664 --> 00:33:43,292
because you're one
of these guys that's
good with kids, right?

808
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,265
Yeah. Totally.

809
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:47,029
'Cause, the kid, man,
I don't get it.

810
00:33:47,137 --> 00:33:49,128
He's into dragons
and fairies

811
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:50,672
and, you know, hoboes.

812
00:33:50,774 --> 00:33:51,832
Right.

813
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:53,875
So, I mean,
what am I supposed
to say to him?

814
00:33:53,977 --> 00:33:55,001
Yeah. I don't know. I don't...

815
00:33:55,111 --> 00:33:57,978
Hey, but while I've
got you here in
my personal space,

816
00:33:58,081 --> 00:34:00,743
I was wondering if you
could maybe sign off on
my hours from yesterday.

817
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,818
Oh, no, I don't...
I'm not the kid's parent.

818
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:05,979
No, that's... Parental
signatures are mama's
department. One second.

819
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:09,490
Lynette! Augie's little
buddy's here.
He needs your signature.

820
00:34:09,592 --> 00:34:12,117
Oh! Hi!
Hi.

821
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:13,820
I'm Lynette.
I'm Danny.

822
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,261
So good to meet you.
You, too.

823
00:34:15,365 --> 00:34:18,493
I was wondering if you
could maybe sign my hours
sheet from yesterday.

824
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:19,693
Sure!

825
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:25,139
You know, we are so thrilled
that you are gonna be
spending some time with Augie,

826
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:29,339
because, you know,
just how he is.

827
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:31,636
How is he?

828
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:35,775
I'm just glad you're gonna
be getting him out of
his own little world a bit.

829
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:38,752
It's like, "Get out of here!
Leave home!"

830
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:41,581
Hey, why don't you come over
for dinner on Saturday night,

831
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:43,420
and we can get to know you
a little bit better?

832
00:34:43,526 --> 00:34:47,485
I don't think so.
It's not you. I hate having
dinner with people.

833
00:34:47,597 --> 00:34:48,689
Hey, Augie, ready to...

834
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:49,787
Yeah, let's go.
Yeah.

835
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:57,733
MAN 1: I think
they're over here.

836
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:59,809
MAN 2: I'm disappointed.
This isn't gonna
hurt anybody.

837
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:04,171
So, your parents... Wow.

838
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:06,041
Jim is not my dad.

839
00:35:06,649 --> 00:35:09,675
Okay. Well, that's
probably good.

840
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:13,913
MAN: Hey, hey, Odeon.
Make way
for King Argotron!

841
00:35:17,394 --> 00:35:18,520
Dude.

842
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:23,928
Bow as your daughter does.

843
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:26,599
Xanthians.

844
00:35:27,203 --> 00:35:28,568
Why bother?

845
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:30,996
Good one, sir.

846
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,802
Man, why do you
bow for that guy?

847
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:38,346
Because he's the king,
and he rules
the entire realm.

848
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:40,177
He rules the entire realm?
Yeah.

849
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:44,583
My bad. Is that when
he is or isn't whacking
it to <i>The Sims?</i>

850
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:48,213
You know, Augie,
maybe you should think
about losing the cape.

851
00:35:48,324 --> 00:35:49,985
At least in public.

852
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:52,653
People tend to avoid
people in capes.

853
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:55,060
I know that's not
the case here.

854
00:35:55,765 --> 00:35:57,630
Look at these people.

855
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,137
(HORN HONKS)

856
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,763
I like these people.
No, I know.

857
00:36:04,874 --> 00:36:08,366
But, you know,
this isn't reality.
It's not the real world.

858
00:36:08,478 --> 00:36:11,879
I know that,
but in this world,
I don't have to be me.

859
00:36:13,082 --> 00:36:15,073
WOMAN: I'm stuck again!

860
00:36:15,185 --> 00:36:17,551
Well, looks like maybe
one of your people
could use a hand.

861
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:20,521
Help! Help! Help!
Her, I don't like.

862
00:36:29,432 --> 00:36:31,332
Okay. This is my place.

863
00:36:31,901 --> 00:36:33,300
Shit hole.

864
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:38,268
Look, kid, you're obviously
not a big fan of me,
and that's okay,

865
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:40,069
but I think there's
something to be gained

866
00:36:40,176 --> 00:36:43,270
from us spending 139
more hours together.

867
00:36:44,113 --> 00:36:45,273
Yeah.

868
00:36:47,016 --> 00:36:49,109
You know, my dad left me
when I was young,

869
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:51,210
so I know it sucks,

870
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:54,552
but what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

871
00:36:54,657 --> 00:36:57,353
Says the punk living
in the shit hole.

872
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:00,054
Who are these clowns?

873
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:01,152
WHEELER: Kiss?

874
00:37:01,264 --> 00:37:02,561
You don't know who Kiss is?

875
00:37:02,665 --> 00:37:04,155
No. Never heard of them.

876
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:05,461
They look like
idiots to me.

877
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:06,557
No, no, no, dude.

878
00:37:06,669 --> 00:37:08,694
These are four
of the smartest guys
who ever lived.

879
00:37:08,805 --> 00:37:11,035
They're these Jewish guys
that grew up in New York,

880
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,233
and they put on guitars
and makeup to get girls,

881
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:15,038
and all of their songs
are about fucking!

882
00:37:15,144 --> 00:37:16,771
I'm listening.

(SONG PLAYS ON STEREO)

884
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:25,218
Seriously, this song
is called <i>Love Gun,</i> and it's
about Paul Stanley's dick

885
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:27,881
and how this girl's gonna
get some of his dick!

886
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:29,322
Cool.

887
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:30,756
I didn't know Jews
could sing like that.

888
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,990
No. No. They couldn't at
the time. That's why they
had to dress like clowns.

889
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:36,360
This got them girls?

890
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:39,902
Get this! They've
been getting pussy
nonstop for 30 years!

891
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:42,164
They're probably fucking
right now, and they're
old dudes!

892
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,001
They put makeup on,
and it's all good!

893
00:37:44,107 --> 00:37:45,233

hours this weekend.

00:38:05,695 --> 00:38:07,094
That's not gonna
be enough.

902
00:38:07,196 --> 00:38:10,290
Somehow we gotta get them
on the weekdays, too.

903

Hey, we could pretend
to be their uncles,
pull them out of school.

904
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:14,969
That just sounds
kind of creepy.

905
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:16,265
Yeah, I guess.

I mean, you laid that
genius line on her.

I can't believe she
didn't take your bait.

are we full of shit?

weekend with the boys?

We did 14 hours.
Will you sign our sheets?

00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:45,427
Maybe give us a few
more, just for kicks?
Round it up to 50?

Cocaine.

924
00:38:57,046 --> 00:38:58,570
What'd you have
for dinner?
Was it cocaine?

925
00:38:58,681 --> 00:39:03,618
I will sign your sheets,
but you need to know I am not
here to service your hours.

926
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,382
I'm here to service
these young boys.

927
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:10,084
Do you think I give a shit
if you guys go to prison?

928
00:39:10,193 --> 00:39:12,161
I've been to prison. I have.

929
00:39:12,261 --> 00:39:14,092
I've been to prison.

930
00:39:14,497 --> 00:39:19,298
A prison of drugs, alcohol
and sick thoughts.

931
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:21,763
I used to have sick thoughts.

932
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:24,032
So don't you come in here,

933
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,904
preaching to me about hours

934
00:39:27,677 --> 00:39:32,137
when you're standing
over there, and you're
standing over there,

935
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:34,216
and I don't know
which way is up!

936
00:39:34,317 --> 00:39:35,648
Um...
Should we come back?

937
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:36,946
We can come back.
Yeah.

938
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:38,486
Come here.

939
00:39:39,122 --> 00:39:42,057
We're having an overnight
camping trip,
Big Bear this weekend.

940
00:39:42,158 --> 00:39:45,093
I suggest that you
ask your Littles
to go with you.

941
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:48,061
Maybe worry a little bit
about them and not so
much about your hours.

942
00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:50,064
Overnight?
That's great. Sign us up.

943
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,724
And, fellas,
will you do me a favor?

944
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:54,234
Next time you
want to bullshit me,

945
00:39:54,837 --> 00:39:57,431
bullshit each
other instead, okay?

946
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:00,506
See how that feels.

947
00:40:01,244 --> 00:40:02,939
Okay.
Yep.

948
00:40:03,046 --> 00:40:04,638
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

949
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:06,679
All right.

950
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:08,876
I hate camping.

951
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:10,384
You could use a little
dose of the outdoors.

952
00:40:10,486 --> 00:40:13,785
Camping blows.
It's dirty, and I don't
like sleeping on rocks.

953
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,824
Bring some Ambien.
You'll sleep like a baby.

954
00:40:15,925 --> 00:40:19,759
There's always a guy with an
acoustic guitar that doesn't
quite know how to play it.

955
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,188
(SINGING) <i>Kumbaya, my...</i>

956
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:23,287
Wait. I know it.

957
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:24,366
<i>Kumbaya</i>

958
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,832
You know.
Wait. I know it. Wait.

959
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,698
<i>Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

960
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:34,169
No. Wait.
Oh, yeah, I got it.

961
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:35,301
This is it.

962
00:40:36,345 --> 00:40:38,370
I think that's got it.

963
00:40:40,116 --> 00:40:41,447
God damn it, Ronnie!

964
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:43,212
What? 'Cause I'm black,
you think I did it?

965
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:46,413
No, 'cause you did it
is why I think you did it.

966
00:40:47,724 --> 00:40:50,192
Let me tell you something.
I am not your Big,
and I'll hit you.

967
00:40:50,293 --> 00:40:51,260
I will hit a child.

968
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,453
I've never done that before,
but I will punch
you in the face.

969
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:54,825
Let's dance,
Ben Affleck!

970
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:56,398
Ronnie! Leave him alone.

971
00:40:56,499 --> 00:40:57,488
Fine!

972
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,465
But I'm watching
you, Daredevil.

973
00:40:59,569 --> 00:41:02,504
Looks like you guys
could use a hand up here.

974
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:04,133
(LAUGHS)

975
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,901
MARTIN: Come on, man!
Just having some fun.

976
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:07,407
Let's take a hike.
RONNIE: Thank you.

977
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,378
Don't worry. Once the little
ones are asleep,
I'll break out the PG stuff.

978
00:41:11,481 --> 00:41:12,948
<i>Kumbaya,</i> huh?

979
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:14,277
You don't happen
to know any Wings,
do you?

980
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:15,680
Wings? Yeah.

981
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:18,053
(SINGING) <i>Love, take me down</i>
<i>to the streets</i>

982
00:41:18,154 --> 00:41:19,519
(LAUGHS) Yeah!

983
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:23,349
Man! She got some
boobies on her!

984
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:24,983
You sure do like
boobies, Ronnie.

985
00:41:25,094 --> 00:41:26,118
I sure do.

986
00:41:26,229 --> 00:41:28,925
Sometimes I call myself
the Booby Watcher.

987
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:32,364
Even got my own
comic book. <i>Adventures of</i>
<i>the Booby Watcher.</i>

988
00:41:32,468 --> 00:41:35,028
Okay. You know,
I got a theory
about boobies.

989
00:41:35,138 --> 00:41:36,469
Really?
Yeah.

990
00:41:36,572 --> 00:41:38,540
You see, there are as
many women as there
are men on this planet.

991
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:39,665
True that, true that.

992
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:43,303
And every woman
has two boobs,
for the most part.

993
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,676
So therefore, there's
twice as many boobs
as there are men.

994
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:48,717
We're outnumbered,
and it's overwhelming.

995
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:51,150
We're powerless.
We have to accept it.

996
00:41:51,254 --> 00:41:53,779
I like your take
on boobies.

997
00:41:54,457 --> 00:41:56,220
And I like boobies.

998
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:57,849
Kid, you got a lot to learn.

999
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,052
I know what I'm doing.
Really?

1000
00:41:59,162 --> 00:42:00,686
So you're aware that
you've committed
one of the most

1001
00:42:00,797 --> 00:42:01,764
common rookie
boob-watching errors?

1002
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,451
What you mean?

1003
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,584
Never stare at
the boobies, kid.

1004
00:42:05,694 --> 00:42:08,322
Yeah, once you get caught,
the game's over.

1005
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:10,360
But how?
It's called training.

1006
00:42:10,466 --> 00:42:12,991
You know,
being aware without
drawing attention.

1007
00:42:13,102 --> 00:42:15,798
You don't think I've noticed
the 34-C's in the
camouflage tank top

1008
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:17,599
setting up the tent
directly to the left of us?

1009
00:42:17,706 --> 00:42:21,107
How about those twin cannons
hiking up the mountain
ridge 50 yards due west?

1010
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,438
Or the ridge itself?

1011
00:42:22,544 --> 00:42:23,875
Round mounds of
grass shaped like...

1012
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:25,680
Boobies!

1013
00:42:25,781 --> 00:42:26,770
Don't look over there.
Look here.

1014
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:30,074
Yeah, focus.
You'll get it.

1015
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:33,445
Too bad old Sweeny herself
couldn't come up here
for this trip.

1016
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:34,613
That would have
been fun, huh?

1017
00:42:34,723 --> 00:42:35,815
Yeah. A real blast.

1018
00:42:35,924 --> 00:42:38,518
Yeah, she probably
just had to
hold down the fort.

1019
00:42:38,627 --> 00:42:39,616
(CHUCKLES)

1020
00:42:39,728 --> 00:42:41,525
You got a thing
for Sweeny, Martin?

1021
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:45,823
Sweeney? Me? No.
Now that is
a knee slapper.

1022
00:42:46,268 --> 00:42:47,530
Your erection is showing.

1023
00:42:47,736 --> 00:42:48,703
What?

1024
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,207
You okay?

1025
00:42:55,611 --> 00:42:57,511
(SIGHING) Nature.

1026
00:42:57,813 --> 00:43:01,340
Did you know that bald eagles
are known to engage in
a bizarre mating ritual

1027
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,078
where two eagles fly upwards,
lock talons,

1028
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,348
then fall towards the earth
while rotating,

1029
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:09,515
separating moments before
they crash into the ground,

1030
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:12,590
if, and only if,
they consummate
their bird fuck?

1031
00:43:13,295 --> 00:43:17,095
If they don't,
they're willing to accept
death by hard ground.

1032
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,698
It's the ultimate race
against the clock.

1033
00:43:19,802 --> 00:43:21,133
Why are you
telling me this?

1034
00:43:21,236 --> 00:43:22,794
Why would I not?

1035
00:43:31,873 --> 00:43:33,568
Hi, Danny.

1036
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:35,666
I forgot to tell you,
they'll be telling

You should stop by.

1040
00:43:40,616 --> 00:43:44,746
And as the barn door
creaked open,
ever so slowly,

1041
00:43:44,853 --> 00:43:47,822
standing there with
the moon at his back

1042
00:43:47,923 --> 00:43:52,690
and holding the severed head
of the pediatrician's
mother in his hand,

1043
00:43:52,794 --> 00:43:55,592
was Philip,

the pizza delivery boy

1045
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,699
from when they ordered pizza
at the beginning of the story!

1046
00:44:00,802 --> 00:44:02,667
Come on, you guys!

1047
00:44:02,771 --> 00:44:04,102

Hey, come here.

are unscareable.

1049
00:44:05,774 --> 00:44:07,901
Think you can do better?
Who's got a better story?
Come on.

1050
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,274
You guys are so smart.
Who's got a scarier
story than me?

1051
00:44:10,379 --> 00:44:12,279
Yes?
So what's up?

1052
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:14,576
I don't know.
What's up with you?

1053
00:44:14,683 --> 00:44:16,207
I know you're engaged.
I haven't forgotten.

1054
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:17,285
Uh-huh.

1055
00:44:17,419 --> 00:44:18,579
So what's this?

1056
00:44:18,687 --> 00:44:19,654
Ooh.

1057
00:44:19,921 --> 00:44:21,047
Those are my testicles.

1058
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:22,282
Yeah.

1059
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:24,450
Listen,
I have an arrangement
with my fiancé.

1060
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:29,019
I'm completely faithful to
him within the area codes
of greater Los Angeles.

1061
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:33,090
Out here, I'm just another
woman who's ready to cheat.

1062
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:34,964
Give me two minutes.

1063
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,834
How about you, Daniel?
You think you can top it?

1064
00:44:37,973 --> 00:44:39,531
It's Danny.
Oh.

1065
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:44,874
(SINGING) <i>Oh, Danny boy</i>
<i>The Danny boys are Danny boys</i>

1066
00:44:45,881 --> 00:44:49,248
Come on, man!
We're on pins and needles.
Give us a story.

1067
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:51,444
Okay, I've got a really
good horror story,

1068
00:44:51,553 --> 00:44:54,716
and it's particularly
terrifying
because it's true.

1069
00:44:54,823 --> 00:44:56,757
Oh, a true story!

1070
00:44:56,858 --> 00:45:00,726
In countries all over the
world, including our own,

1071

children, many
of them just like you,

00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,824
are abducted and sold

1073

into the world of
underground sex trafficking.

Okay!

you there, Danny boy.
That is a scary story.

1076
00:45:14,876 --> 00:45:17,811
Story time is over!
Everybody, let's break
into our groups.

1077
00:45:17,913 --> 00:45:21,542
Group A, come with me
for Martin's midnight
mystery hike.

1078
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,811
And group B, go with Duane.
What you got on tap, Duane?

1079
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:26,615
We are gonna make
some s'mores
using white chocolate.

1080
00:45:26,722 --> 00:45:27,711
Oh.

1081
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:30,986
Well, I'm not sure
I agree with that,
but to each their own.

1082
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:33,186
Hey, hey, Danny.
Is this all your Ambien?

1083
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:34,284
Yeah.

1084
00:45:34,396 --> 00:45:36,523
Okay, 'cause Connie
and I are gonna take some,

1085
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:38,360
and then we're gonna stay up
as late as we can,

1086
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:40,128
because if you fight
the urge to go to sleep,

1087
00:45:40,235 --> 00:45:42,499
things start to get
all trippy, and then
we're gonna fuck.

1088
00:45:42,604 --> 00:45:43,662
Connie who's engaged.

1089
00:45:43,772 --> 00:45:44,864
Oh, yeah.

1090
00:45:44,973 --> 00:45:48,807
You know what? Don't
worry about it. We'll
make do with three each.

1091
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:59,111
Fight it. Come on.
Stay awake.

1092
00:45:59,888 --> 00:46:02,755
You know, a lot of people
don't realize that bushes,
just like flowers,

1093
00:46:02,858 --> 00:46:05,088
emit a wonderful aroma,
especially at night.

1094
00:46:05,193 --> 00:46:06,785
Who wants to sniff
this bush?

1095
00:46:13,902 --> 00:46:16,370
(SIGHS) So Ronnie's out on
some kind of hike.

1096
00:46:16,471 --> 00:46:17,529
Where's Wheeler?

1097
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:18,867
He's having sex
with a married lady.

1098
00:46:18,974 --> 00:46:19,963
Oh.

1099
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:21,906
Are you sewing?
Yeah.

1100
00:46:22,377 --> 00:46:24,607
This is my country's
emblem.

1101
00:46:26,715 --> 00:46:29,912
Do you think we can speak
in private for a second?

1102
00:46:31,753 --> 00:46:33,118
Yeah. Yeah.

1103
00:46:34,723 --> 00:46:37,021
I already talked to Kuzzik
and Artonius,

1104
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:42,153
and we would like to
officially invite you to be a
soldier in the Xanthian army.

1105
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:45,825
Well, that's very kind of you,
but I would like
to respectfully decline.

1106
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:47,026
I'm kind of a pacifist.

1107
00:46:47,135 --> 00:46:49,126
I don't really believe
in imaginary bloodshed.

1108
00:46:49,237 --> 00:46:52,263
But there's room in Laire
for all belief systems.

1109
00:46:52,374 --> 00:46:56,003
Even early barbaric
modalities
have their place.

1110
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,645
Augie, look, you're
a good kid. I like you,

1111
00:46:59,748 --> 00:47:02,216
but I'm not really into
the whole buddy-buddy,

1112
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:04,615
let's-go-do-stuff-together
kind of thing.

1113
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,949
Well, why are you here?

1114
00:47:09,724 --> 00:47:11,487
It's court-ordered.

1115
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,027
What did you do?

1116
00:47:14,796 --> 00:47:17,663
I just had one of those days
where you wake up and say,

1117
00:47:17,766 --> 00:47:20,758
"Where did the last
10 years of my life go?"

1118
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:24,066
I asked my girlfriend
to marry me out of impulse.

1119
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:26,229
She dumped me.

1120
00:47:27,075 --> 00:47:31,409
And then I ran a truck
that looks like a bull
into a statue of a horse.

1121
00:47:32,113 --> 00:47:33,876
I'm not here by choice
either, by the way.

1122
00:47:33,982 --> 00:47:35,040
No?

1123
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,845
My guidance counselor
signed me up.

1124
00:47:36,952 --> 00:47:38,613
Really?
Yeah.

1125
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,247
Said anyone who wears
a cape and has a sword
should have more friends.

1126
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:44,120
Whoop-dee-doo, right?

1127
00:47:44,926 --> 00:47:46,587
So both of us don't
want to be here.

1128
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:47,957
No.

1129
00:47:48,063 --> 00:47:50,190
Well, we got that in common.

1130
00:47:51,766 --> 00:47:53,131
So do you have
a girlfriend?

1131
00:47:53,235 --> 00:47:54,361
No. What?

1132
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:57,697
Why would you ask...
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

1133
00:47:57,806 --> 00:48:00,741
But what about that girl
you're always looking at,
with the cap and the...

1134
00:48:00,842 --> 00:48:02,742
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1135
00:48:02,844 --> 00:48:05,210
Come on!
Don't bullshit me.

1136
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:07,076
You're always
looking at her.

1137
00:48:07,182 --> 00:48:09,673
You mean Esplen,
the Goddess of Navalore?

1138
00:48:09,784 --> 00:48:10,808
I don't know. Probably.

1139
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:11,943
Her name's Sarah.

1140
00:48:12,053 --> 00:48:13,145
Sarah.

1141
00:48:13,555 --> 00:48:15,113
Ah, Sarah.

1142
00:48:16,491 --> 00:48:17,549
You ever talk to her?

1143
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:18,717
No.

1144
00:48:18,827 --> 00:48:21,489
I've killed her a couple
of times in battle, but
that's not really anything.

1145
00:48:21,596 --> 00:48:22,528
Talk to her.

1146
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:23,893
No, I can't talk to her.

1147
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:26,832
Romance her.
Give her that patch
of yours. She'll love it.

1148
00:48:26,935 --> 00:48:27,959
No, I can't give her this.

1149
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:29,263
She'll be flattered!
Why not?

1150
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:31,100
I made it for you.

1151
00:48:33,508 --> 00:48:34,475
You made that for me?

1152
00:48:34,576 --> 00:48:35,634
Yeah.

1153
00:48:36,478 --> 00:48:37,570
Great. Now I gotta do it.

1154
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:39,078
Yeah, that kind
of was my plan.

1155
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,704
That was so low, dude.

1156
00:48:45,687 --> 00:48:48,212
No. Come on, Connie.
Stay awake.

1157
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,652
Fuck.

1158
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:55,594
I gotta pee.

1159
00:48:56,431 --> 00:48:57,557
Yep.

1160
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:01,795
Hey! Martin!

1161
00:49:01,903 --> 00:49:02,892
Okay.

1162
00:49:03,004 --> 00:49:05,029
What are you
doing out here?

1163
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,664
I'm just doing my
perimeter check.

1164
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:10,176
Hey, did you know
that dinosaurs
are not extinct?

1165
00:49:10,278 --> 00:49:13,805
Because birds are dinosaurs,
and they're everywhere.

1166
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:16,040
Okay!

1167
00:49:16,651 --> 00:49:18,551
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
Now, all right.

1168
00:49:19,187 --> 00:49:21,280
I gotta pee.
I really gotta pee.

1169
00:49:25,894 --> 00:49:27,361
Look at that.

1170
00:49:28,096 --> 00:49:30,155
Yo, Wheeler!
You in there?

1171
00:49:34,769 --> 00:49:36,134
Oh, my God.

1172
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:39,034
MAN 1: Dude.
MAN 2: Nice, man.

1173
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,698
Oh, boy.

1174
00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:43,744
This is a classic case
of guy on the ground.

1175
00:49:50,952 --> 00:49:52,442
I'm sorry.
I don't care.

1176
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:53,646
Okay.

1177
00:49:53,888 --> 00:49:56,823
So I heard there was
some sex on the trip

1178
00:49:56,925 --> 00:49:58,654
and some drugs, too.

1179
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:01,921
Only thing missing
was rock 'n' roll.

1180
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:07,094
What was Danny doing
with those Ambiens?

1181
00:50:07,202 --> 00:50:09,602
He has trouble sleeping
outdoors.

1182
00:50:10,472 --> 00:50:13,805
How did Wheeler come
to be naked in
the center of camp?

1183
00:50:13,908 --> 00:50:15,205
He was sleepwalking.

1184
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,175
Danny ever offer you drugs?
Well...

1185
00:50:17,278 --> 00:50:18,973
Answer me.
No, ma'am.

1186
00:50:19,347 --> 00:50:21,679
Did Wheeler ever
expose himself to you?

1187
00:50:21,783 --> 00:50:23,045
Hell no!

1188
00:50:25,453 --> 00:50:28,980
Fellows? These young gentlemen
here have decided your fates.

1189
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:32,924
If it was up to me, I'd lock
you both up, but the boys
are saying you're okay.

1190
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:36,191
This is your last chance.
Start acting like Bigs.

1191

Yeah. You are white.

Yes, JJ.

you lose your arm.
Yes.

1214
00:51:38,893 --> 00:51:40,360
You gotta put it behind
you, like this.

You get hit in the leg,
you lose the leg.

You can't use it.

Yeah.
Yeah, you gotta hop.

Come on, whitey, dance!
Break it on down!
Get it funky!

1230
00:52:22,437 --> 00:52:23,699
He's out.

1231
00:52:35,183 --> 00:52:36,377
(GRUNTING)

1232
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,018
Thank you.
Yep.

1233
00:52:46,127 --> 00:52:47,856
Call her. Sweep
her off her feet.

1234
00:52:47,962 --> 00:52:49,088
It's not that easy, Augie.

1235
00:52:49,197 --> 00:52:50,721
Just let her know
how you feel.

1236
00:52:50,832 --> 00:52:51,799
Give her one call.

1237
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,094
All right. I'll...

1238
00:52:53,201 --> 00:52:54,793
Just get off my back.

1239
00:52:54,903 --> 00:52:56,530
Did you know in
the 14th century that

1240
00:52:56,638 --> 00:52:59,471
knights used to write love
songs and poems for
the women they loved,

1241
00:52:59,574 --> 00:53:00,802
even if she was married?

1242
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:02,240
No, I didn't know that.

1243
00:53:02,343 --> 00:53:03,367
Well, there you go.

1244
00:53:03,478 --> 00:53:04,775
It's her voice mail.

1245
00:53:04,879 --> 00:53:06,744
Hey, Beth.
How's it going?
It's me.

1246
00:53:06,848 --> 00:53:09,043
Tell her her hair
is like 1,000 suns.
Look, I...

1247
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:11,243
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted
to get together.

1248
00:53:11,352 --> 00:53:12,717
I know there's a lot
of stuff I'd like to say.

1249
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:14,015
(WHISPERING)
Whispering eye.

1250
00:53:14,122 --> 00:53:16,886
So, if you get a chance,
give me a call back and...

1251
00:53:16,991 --> 00:53:19,050
You long for her
whispering eye.
We can...

1252
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,491
We can see each other.

1253
00:53:20,595 --> 00:53:21,562
I'd love to see you.

1254
00:53:21,663 --> 00:53:22,721
And her whispering eye.

1255
00:53:22,831 --> 00:53:24,799
And your whispering eye.

1256
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,024
All right. Bye.

1257
00:53:28,503 --> 00:53:30,027
Whispering eye?

1258
00:53:30,505 --> 00:53:32,302
It means vagina.

1259
00:53:33,608 --> 00:53:34,973
(SUPPRESSING LAUGHTER)

1260
00:53:35,076 --> 00:53:36,668
It means vagina.

1261
00:53:37,412 --> 00:53:38,936
That's a classy
move, man.

1262
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:40,241
It means vagina.

1263
00:53:40,348 --> 00:53:43,647
Yeah. Get your whispering
eye in the cab, Augie.

1264
00:53:44,152 --> 00:53:45,312
AUGIE: (LAUGHING)
Vagina!

1265
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:51,249
DANNY: Hey.

1266
00:53:52,994 --> 00:53:54,018
Hi.

1267
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:56,024
Thanks for meeting me.

1268
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,031
I got you a <i>venti</i> chai,

1269
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,594
which is what they call
a large here, which I love.

1270
00:54:02,704 --> 00:54:03,762
Wow.

1271
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:06,432
There's a transformation.

1272
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:09,704
Yes, well, you know,
I've been doing this community
service for almost a month,

1273
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:13,804
and I really feel as if
it's given me some
perspective on things.

1274
00:54:13,915 --> 00:54:15,849
Well, that's great.
I hope that's true, Danny.

1275
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,713
So let's get married.

1276
00:54:18,086 --> 00:54:20,077
Okay, I'm gonna leave now.
Wait.

1277
00:54:20,188 --> 00:54:22,520
Danny, you are not taking
this breakup seriously.

1278
00:54:22,624 --> 00:54:24,785
Yeah, because
I don't want it.

1279
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:28,695
Do you really think
I wanted this?

1280
00:54:28,796 --> 00:54:32,391
Look. Hey. This is us.

1281
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,195
This is not us.

1282
00:54:34,302 --> 00:54:37,499
We have not been us
in a while, because
you are not you.

1283
00:54:37,605 --> 00:54:39,334
Danny, you're not happy.

1284
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,568
I've been with you seven
years, and it's been
getting progressively worse.

1285
00:54:42,677 --> 00:54:47,546
And it makes me feel bad
about me that I can't
make you happier.

1286
00:54:47,649 --> 00:54:51,813
Where am I gonna find
a girl who hates all
the same things I do?

1287
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,285
You're so romantic.

1288
00:54:53,388 --> 00:54:54,787
Hey. Hey.

1289
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:57,918
"You complete me.' '

1290
00:55:00,628 --> 00:55:02,721
"You had me at 'hello.'"
Oh, God. Danny.

1291
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:03,854
Come on, Beth.
You're not...

1292
00:55:03,965 --> 00:55:05,296
You're not hearing
what I'm saying to you.

1293
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,097
"I am just a girl standing
in front of a boy, telling
her to love her.' '

1294
00:55:09,203 --> 00:55:10,295
You don't even
know that one.

1295
00:55:10,405 --> 00:55:11,599
Hey. Come on.

1296
00:55:11,706 --> 00:55:13,401
"Who you gonna call?"

1297
00:55:14,342 --> 00:55:15,639
"Ghost Busters.' '
Okay. You know what?

1298
00:55:15,743 --> 00:55:19,873
No. I am committing
to this breakup. This is
the best thing for us.

1299
00:55:23,184 --> 00:55:25,982
You can call me if you
need legal advice.

1300
00:55:34,629 --> 00:55:35,618
(SCREAMS)

1301
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:38,426
Come on! Let's kill
some Cacedonians!

1302
00:55:38,533 --> 00:55:41,866
And I got a little
something-something
for you to wear.

1303
00:55:44,172 --> 00:55:45,434
Yeah, I'm not
gonna wear this.

1304
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,666
No?

1305
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:50,708
Soon enough.
Soon enough you'll want it.

1306
00:55:50,812 --> 00:55:51,801
Yeah.

1307
00:55:52,513 --> 00:55:55,710
Yo, Wheeler. What up, dog?
You scoundrel.
What are you doing, man?

1308
00:55:55,817 --> 00:55:58,217
Yo, Hogan's having
another party tonight, man.
You gotta go.

1309
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,186
There's gonna be a lot of
sweet-ass pussy
there, girl pussy.

1310
00:56:01,289 --> 00:56:03,450
Ooh! Uh...

1311
00:56:04,659 --> 00:56:07,093
Thanks for the offer.
Maybe some other time.

1312
00:56:07,195 --> 00:56:09,288
You're the king, Wheeler.
You're the king.

1313
00:56:09,397 --> 00:56:12,423
Dude, don't give up that
sweet-ass pussy on my account.

1314
00:56:12,533 --> 00:56:13,659
I'll go with you.

1315
00:56:13,768 --> 00:56:15,133
Okay. If you say so.

1316
00:56:15,236 --> 00:56:16,931
All right.
You're my PIC, Wheeler.

1317
00:56:17,038 --> 00:56:18,938
What's a PIC?
Partner in crime.

1318
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,531
You're my PIC.
Just don't cock-block
me tonight.

1319
00:56:21,642 --> 00:56:23,405
Wouldn't dream of it.
We'll have a great time.

1320
00:56:23,511 --> 00:56:25,240
We'll go to the party,
we'll get some zah,

1321
00:56:25,346 --> 00:56:26,313
play some Xbox.

1322
00:56:26,414 --> 00:56:27,574

but your wits sharper.

delivered upon us today

1333

and in such strange
and frightful attire?

1334
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,706
Let us thank the gods

1335
00:57:00,815 --> 00:57:04,080
for sending us such
a brave and valiant
warrior to Xanthia.

How's it going?
Lunesta?

1339
00:57:08,389 --> 00:57:10,152
Isn't that a sleeping pill?

00:57:10,258 --> 00:57:13,318
Yeah. It's 'cause I send
my enemies to their

01:31:51,124 --> 01:31:53,217
What? Esplen is still alive?

1997
01:31:54,928 --> 01:31:55,917
Esplen!

1998
01:31:56,029 --> 01:31:58,122
I was hiding in the
bushes the whole time.

1999
01:31:58,232 --> 01:31:59,563
That's a pretty
smart strategy.

2000
01:31:59,666 --> 01:32:02,499
Thanks.
Sorry I killed you.

2001
01:32:02,603 --> 01:32:04,127
It's okay.

2002
01:32:04,238 --> 01:32:08,299
All hail Queen Esplen
of Navalore!

2003

You did good, Augie.

2009
01:32:31,265 --> 01:32:32,857
I mean, a girl did beat you,

2010
01:32:32,966 --> 01:32:35,526
but it's definitely
not as gay as I
thought it would be.

2011
01:32:35,636 --> 01:32:38,833
You were incredible.
Second place!

2012
01:32:38,939 --> 01:32:41,703
That's like a silver medal.
Kind of makes you
hungry for the gold, huh?

(LAUGHS)

2014
01:32:43,043 --> 01:32:46,638
No, but we...
Serious, we are very,
very proud of you.

2015
01:32:46,747 --> 01:32:49,409
Thanks for trying to
be nice, Mom. Jim.

2016

Hail, Esplen!

2017

Congratulations.

I can't believe I won.

2019

When I killed you,
I was, like, "No way.' '

2020
01:33:10,704 --> 01:33:13,673
Yeah, well, the crown
looks very good
on you, very regal.

2021
01:33:13,774 --> 01:33:16,072
Thanks.
I liked your whiskers.

2022
01:33:16,176 --> 01:33:17,609
Thanks.
Was that eyeliner?

2023
01:33:17,711 --> 01:33:19,838
Yeah, I just drew them on.

2024
01:33:19,947 --> 01:33:21,141
It looked good.

2025
01:33:21,248 --> 01:33:23,614
Thanks.
I have two cats, so...

2026
01:33:23,717 --> 01:33:26,413
Oh. Okay. Cool.

2027
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,044
So, Augie,

2028
01:33:29,122 --> 01:33:32,922
now that I'm queen,
I was wondering if maybe

2029
01:33:34,094 --> 01:33:35,721
you'd wanna be my king?

2030
01:33:35,829 --> 01:33:38,423
Yeah. I'd love that.

2031
01:33:39,866 --> 01:33:42,164
Should...
Should I kiss you now?

2032
01:33:50,477 --> 01:33:51,842
Fuck, yeah.

2033
01:33:54,181 --> 01:33:56,172
(CHATTERING)

2034
01:33:58,285 --> 01:34:01,186
Do you know the
song <i>Beth?</i> By Kiss?

2035
01:34:01,622 --> 01:34:03,852
You did a really good
thing tonight, Wheeler.

2036
01:34:03,957 --> 01:34:05,254
Yeah. They'll probably
double our sentence

2037
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:06,849
for not showing up
to the hearing
this afternoon.

2038
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,361
Well, listen. I got
a long-standing relationship
with this judge,

2039
01:34:10,464 --> 01:34:13,695
and I don't want to get too
graphic, but I used to
suck his dick for drugs.

2040
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,324
Oh.
He got me my junk.

2041
01:34:15,435 --> 01:34:18,700
Long story short,
you guys are
not going to jail.

2042
01:34:18,805 --> 01:34:21,205
Are you BSing me?
'Cause I know
you're the best BSer.

2043
01:34:21,308 --> 01:34:22,332
No, I'm being straight
with you, man.

2044
01:34:23,725 --> 01:34:24,657
Shit. Thank you.

2045
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:25,726
Whoa! Okay.

2046
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:26,849
Thank you so much.
All right.

(CHUCKLING)

2049
01:34:30,265 --> 01:34:32,790
So speaking of whatever
you guys were just
talking about,

2050
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:37,394
I happen to know a really
nice Italian restaurant
in Manhattan Beach,

2051
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:40,065
and I would love to take you
if you're interested.

2052
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:41,664
Sure, Martin.

2053
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:44,243
I just hope we're talking
pasta and not pussy.

2054
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:47,314
Well, I was talking about
two adults having some pasta,

2055
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:50,612
and, yes, I was kinda hoping
that it would lead
to some pussy.

2056
01:34:50,718 --> 01:34:52,583
Call it out there.

2057
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:54,245

we after here?
