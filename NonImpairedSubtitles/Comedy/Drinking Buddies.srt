1
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,584
- When it comes to weddings,

2
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,220
you want something that you know
most people are gonna like,

3
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,422
gets everyone
sufficiently drunk,

4
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,690
no fights between the families.

5
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:32,691
Can I see the ring?

6
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:33,759
- Yeah.

7
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,327
- Oh, my God.

8
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,196
What?

9
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:38,363
Wow, that's beautiful.

10
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,398
That's great.

11
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,266
What'd you do wrong?

12
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,260
- What's up, guys?

13
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,529
Stop working so hard.

14
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,297
I don't want you guys
to strain yourselves.

15
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,466
- Oh, okay, thank you, Kate.

16
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:18,170
- It crushed a can
like I've never seen.

17
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,471
It was--it was insane.

18
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,141
Yeah, come in!

19
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,709
If that thing is, like,
a piece of shit...

20
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:26,612
Hey, um,
how is the planning going

21
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:27,779
for the anniversary party?

22
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,780
- Good.
- Good?

23
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,082
- Yep. All set.

24
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,483
- Good or great?
- Really great.

25
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,652
- Oh, oh, okay.
And you're gonna hate this.

26
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,356
Will you call the distributors,
each one individually,

27
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,790
and speak to someone there

28
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,159
and make sure that they know
they're invited?

29
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,493
You're, like, you know,

30
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,494
the face and voice
of this brewery, so...

31
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,229
- Yeah.

32
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,230
- You know, they need
to make a connection with you,

33
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,099
and that way, you know--

34
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,300
I know it's a little political,
but if you did that for me,

35
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,668
it would make me
very, very, very happy.

36
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,537
- Sure thing. Yep, sure.
I'll get on that.

37
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,373
- All right.
Oh, oh, um...

38
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,542
Uh...

39
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,709
That's it. That's it.

40
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,578
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay, all right.

41
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,849
- Hey, what are you,
running through the warehouse?

42
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,617
- I have to go make
so many phone calls.

43
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,353
Can I make beer instead,
and you go make phone calls?

44
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,821
- Uh, no, no.

45
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,190
how are the eyes?

46
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,791
- They're--they're good,

47
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,627
despite boiling wort
being thrown into them.

48
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,362
- Well, look,
I apologize about that.

49
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,897
- It's good.
I've been baptized.

50
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,265
- See ya.
- Lunch?

51
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,266
- Yes, yes.

52
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,535
- Okay.

53
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,572
Okay, Tom, I have to go.

54
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:27,873
Yep, I'll see you there.

55
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,309
Okay, thank you.

56
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,146
- Hey.
- Hey!

57
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,714
- I've got some food for Kate.

58
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,449
- That is me.

59
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:41,520
- If you could
just sign this guy for me.

60
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,858
Awesome.

61
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,859
Thank you.

62
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,860
- Thanks.

63
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:49,861
- Enjoy.

64
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,263
- Hey, do you have a fridge?

65
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:52,564
- Do I have a fridge?

66
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,799
- 'Cause you can
have a magnet.

67
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,801
- A magnet, ooh.

68
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:56,802
- Yeah.

69
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:57,903
- I love Revolution Brewing.

70
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,171
I really do.

71
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,172
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

72
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:01,206
- We love you too.

73
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,774
I love you too.

74
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,583
Uh-oh.

75
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,584
Security!

76
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,585
- Hey!

77
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,720
- Security!

78
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,787
Ugh.

79
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,789
- Oh, we smell so bad!

80
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,592
- Look at this,
some Greek salad?

81
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,727
- Eat it.
I fucking hate it.

82
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:22,828
It's disgusting.

83
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,396
I'm trying not to get scurvy.

84
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:25,397
Boing!

85
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,633
- Come on, not my fucking beer!

86
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:30,902
- Oh, that's an expert
beer-tasting technique.

87
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,705
- Enjoy your fries.

88
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,407
- I'm still gonna eat.

89
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,942
That doesn't--
that doesn't do anything.

90
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,410
That doesn't do anything to me.

91
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:39,745
- Come out
drinking with us tonight.

92
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,380
- Okay, yeah.

93
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:42,648
- You're in?
- Sure.

94
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,416
- Awesome.
- Mm-hmm.

95
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,851
- They go,
"Oh, my name--my name is Jim.

96
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,519
This is my wife, Carol."

97
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,688
You went--"Oh, this is Carol.
that's my"--

98
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,923
- You don't need to know
their names.

99
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,425
- But so this guy comes up
to me,

100
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,993
and I know
he's gonna fuck with us.

101
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,296
And so in my head, I think
about what my mother said,

102
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,930
and I have the vision,

103
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,766
like from, you know,
the voice of God.

104
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:03,502
This guy's name is Chris Cook.

105
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,004
And so I go,
"Hey, man, you're Chris Cook."

106
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,606
- That's not a Korean name,
though.

107
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,941
- No, he's not--
this is not the Korean.

108
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,610
I thought
that it just didn't work.

109
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:12,744
- No, the guy's name was--

110
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,313
- Where did you get Chris Cook?

111
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,914
- It was a voice, the theory--
it was a voice--

112
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:19,451
- Hey!
- Hey!

113
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,452
You made it.

114
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:21,687
- Gentlemen.

115
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,288
- Everybody remembers Jill.
- Hi.

116
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,756
- Good seeing you.
- Good seeing you too.

117
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,558
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

118
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,694
- What do you want to drink?
You want something to drink?

119
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:29,961
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

120
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,396
Yeah, I will
have a Bell's Amber.

121
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,999
- Bell's Amber.
- Bell's Amber.

122
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,667
- Thank you.

123
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,409
There you are.

124
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,745
- Oh, thank you.

125
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,453
- If your party bus flips over,

126
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:57,622
how long before you think
you get to go party foul?

127
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:58,623
- What?

128
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,624
- Would you shut up?

129
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,959
- Well, I'm just saying.

130
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,728
- Would you please,
for once in your life...

131
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,429
- Party foul.

132
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,665
- Once in your life,
right before you talk, Frank,

133
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,400
just go,
"I'm not gonna talk."

134
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,571
- I'm thinking about
heading out.

135
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,739
- Let's do one more beer.

136
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,941
- Oh, no, no, no,
you should stay.

137
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,409
You should hang out with Frank.

138
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:18,677
- One more beer.
- Oh, no, I'm fine.

139
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,878
- We'll split one.

140
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,446
- No, baby, I got to go.
I got to go.

141
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,914
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm going for sure.

142
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,616
I'm going for sure.
- I'm gonna go with.

143
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:25,917
- Yeah?
- Yes.

144
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,686
- Okay.

145
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,754
- Gentlemen.

146
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,455
- You out?
- Good night.

147
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,957
- Good night, Kate.
We'll see you at work.

148
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,859
- Bye!

149
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:36,495
- So long, everybody.

150
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,330
- You guys seen <i>The Hustler?</i>

151
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,465
You're about to.

152
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,609
Mmm, that smells good.

153
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,711
- It is good.

154
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,480
You want some?

155
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:31,149
- Mm.

156
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,150
Hi.

157
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,386
- Hey.

158
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,787
- That's good.

159
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,022
Mmm.

160
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,924
- Wouldn't take me a second.

161
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,760
- No, I'm not hungry.

162
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,396
I just want beer.

163
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,997
- Yeah?

164
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,767
- You haven't drank
any of the beer I brought you.

165
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,969
- I've had a couple of them.

166
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,539
- How was your night?

167
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,774
- Good.

168
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,142
- Yeah?

169
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,912
- Yeah, we played pool
at the Empty Bottle.

170
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:01,913
- Oh, the Bottle.

171
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:02,948
- You know that place?

172
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,015
- I've heard of it, yeah.

173
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,752
No, I've been to the Bottle.

174
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,922
- What'd you do today?

175
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,658
- I met with a couple of kids
at the studio

176
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,627
that I think
are gonna do an album.

177
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,729
Yeah, they got a pretty decent
little sound.

178
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,531
They're kind of...

179
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:23,802
a little bit freak rock,
a little noisy.

180
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,737
But they have this girl
who plays the cello,

181
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,839
and I think
that's supposed to be ironic,

182
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,608
but I can't tell anymore.

183
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,611
But, uh, so we'll just
stick a mic on her and go.

184
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,948
You sure
you don't want a plate?

185
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,651
- Mm-mm.

186
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,820
- Here.

187
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,021
- Really?

188
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,022
- Yeah.

189
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,457
- Mmm, are you done?

190
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,458
- Yeah.

191
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,093
- Oh, my God.

192
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,929
Thank you.

193
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,058
- Oh, sorry.
- No, no.

194
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,526
- No. I always forget.

195
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,862
- I got it.

196
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:24,896
- I'm awful.

197
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:25,897
- You're not awful.

198
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,499
- Oh, okay.

199
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:28,967
- You're just really hard
on furniture.

200
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,637
- Mid-century,
classic 18th.

201
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,074
It's terrible.

202
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,577
Thanks for coming to see me.

203
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,912
- You're welcome.

204
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,119
- Oh, shit.

205
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,220
- What?

206
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,989
- Oh, I got something,
and I...

207
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,691
I forgot.

208
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:55,527
I bought you
something today.

209
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,295
I'll be right back.
One sec.

210
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,772
Uh, you might hate it.

211
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,240
You'll prob--
you'll probably hate it.

212
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,875
- I won't hate it.

213
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,644
- But you might come around
and then love it.

214
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,846
- Book!

215
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,949
What is it?

216
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,119
- That is back
when men wrote about God,

217
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,887
pussy, and themselves.

218
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,557
It's like, of all the sort of
fellow narcissists,

219
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,659
that's the one.

220
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,660
- Thank you.

221
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,128
- Sure.

222
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,930
You kind of remind me
a little bit of the hero.

223
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:32,931
- Really? Is she a--

224
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,165
- Yeah, in a weird way.

225
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,233
It's he, but...
- It's a he.

226
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,636
- It's thematic.

227
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,737
- Awesome.

228
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,138
- You're a kindred spirit.

229
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,573
- Thank you.

230
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,075
- You're a runner.

231
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,344
You're a rabbit.

232
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,846
- I am a little bit
like a rabbit.

233
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,681
- You are.

234
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,053
- Damn it.

235
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:58,123
I can't find my sock.

236
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,159
- You sure you don't want
to just spend the night?

237
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,894
- No, I have to be home
in the morning

238
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,697
'cause I'm having
something delivered.

239
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,032
But you should stay in bed.

240
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,099
Go to sleep.

241
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,205
- All right,
how about I call you a car?

242
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,674
- No, 'cause I have my bike.

243
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,208
I'm just gonna ride.

244
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,244
- Just throw it in the back
of the cab or something.

245
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:20,278
I'll give you some money.

246
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,147
- No, thank you.

247
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,281
- I feel bad.

248
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,251
- Don't feel bad.

249
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,786
- I feel bad.

250
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,387
- Don't feel bad.

251
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,348
No, really, really, really.

252
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,383
Really?

253
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,754
- No! No!
You're gonna get me fired!

254
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:03,755
Oh, gross!

255
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:04,889
- Sorry.

256
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,191
- Get out.
- I'm leaving.

257
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:08,793
- Ow!

258
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,095
- Please, please, please.

259
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,229
Stop it.

260
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,831
Now you're just being mean.

261
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,299
- Okay. All right.

262
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:17,836
- So you don't need me
to do anything.

263
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:21,139
- I mean, no, if everything
is all taken care of,

264
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,042
then I guess, you know,
we should be fine, I guess.

265
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,410
- Okay.
- Yeah.

266
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,978
- Are you gonna be all right?

267
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,448
- I'm--I'm fine.

268
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,449
- Okay.

269
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,684
- Yeah.

270
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:33,685
- I like both.

271
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,086
I like a short beard.

272
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,821
I like--I like your beard--
- Well, this--

273
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,323
- Like, if it was longer
than this,

274
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,125
then I'd be worried
it would be like a hipster

275
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,127
or homeless dot com
kind of situation.

276
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,762
- But this is an okay range.

277
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:44,996
- I like it.

278
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,231
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, how are you?

279
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,832
- Hi. Good.

280
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,167
You like nice.
- Oh, thank you very much.

281
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,935
This place is gorgeous.
Did you do most of this?

282
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,003
- Yeah, it looks awesome.
- Did you do most of this?

283
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,738
- Yeah, I didn't do much.

284
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,206
I just put some plants
in the growlers and the food--

285
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,875
- No, it looks amazing.

286
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,243
- Why are you so stressed?
It's going great.

287
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,244
- It's good, right?
- It's great.

288
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,779
- Okay, good.

289
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,413
- The chocolate pretzels
are a humongous hit.

290
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,382
- Good, good. Great.
It's hot, sorry.

291
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,917
- It's so hot.

292
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,919
- Just encourages more drinking.
- Yeah, exactly.

293
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,087
- I think
it's good party plan.

294
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,488
- Ah! Sorry.

295
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,323
Chris is here.
I'm gonna go get him.

296
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,992
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

297
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,393
- Bring him back over here,
all right?

298
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,895
- Okay.
- Chris is her boyfriend?

299
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,329
- Chris is the boyfriend, yes.

300
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,864
- Baby.

301
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,032
- Hey.
- Mwah.

302
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,367
Welcome!

303
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,068
- I was just looking for you.
Thank you.

304
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,069
- Come in. Jess.

305
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:28,039
Jessica, he's with me.

306
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,040
- Wow, this is great.

307
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,041
This looks great.

308
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,042
Did you do all of this?

309
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,944
- I did.
- Wow.

310
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,814
Wow, it's--
yeah, it's amazing.

311
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:36,815
It's a lot of work.

312
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,016
- Yeah.

313
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,317
Here, I want you
to meet some people.

314
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,451
You guys,
this is my boyfriend, Chris.

315
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,287
- Hey, how are you?

316
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,022
- Chris, this is Jim.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

317
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,256
- This is Dawn.
- Hey, Jim. How are you?

318
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,491
Pleasure.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

319
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,492
- And this is Frank's wife.

320
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,827
- Frank.
- Amy.

321
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,328
- Frank.
Hey, Frank's wife.

322
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,429
- I can't wait to meet him.

323
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,298
- Yeah, he's with Jim right now.

324
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,299
- You left him with Jim?

325
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,100
- Yeah.

326
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,203
But, um, if I introduce you,
will you not be a dickhead?

327
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,504
And don't call me names,

328
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,139
and don't say anything stupid
or mean,

329
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,141
and don't, like,
punch me in the face?

330
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,277
Get off.

331
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,380
- All our equipment came in
from Canada.

332
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,815
We had it shipped in,

333
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,450
and we had it all rigged
and set up,

334
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,519
and started brewing
about three months ago.

335
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,020
- Here you go. Good one.
- Thank you.

336
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,822
- Uh, we'll be back.

337
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,824
I'm just gonna introduce him
to some other people.

338
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:20,959
- Great to--great to meet you.

339
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,260
Yeah.

340
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,531
- Well,
then take the shoes off.

341
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,433
- No, no.
I'm--I'm such a shorty.

342
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,168
- Who cares?

343
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,070
- I don't want your friends
to know how short I am.

344
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,438
- Ha-ha!

345
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,006
You're the weirdest.
- It's a secret.

346
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,241
- It's a secret?

347
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:37,242
All right,
I won't tell anyone.

348
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,877
- Hey, guys.
- Hi!

349
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,111
- This is Chris. This is Jill.
- Hi, I'm Jill.

350
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,179
- Jill, how are you?
- This is Luke.

351
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,981
- Nice to meet you.
- Luke?

352
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,382
- Yes, Luke, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Luke.

353
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,383
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Callie.

354
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,818
- Hey, Callie.
- Hi.

355
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,952
- This is Mike.
- How are you? Chris.

356
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:48,953
- Hey. Mike.
- Mike? Chris.

357
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,121
- It's everybody!

358
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,489
- Pleasure, yeah.
Nice to see you.

359
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,957
- This is his first time here.
- Welcome, man.

360
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,359
Hey, all jokes aside,

361
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,127
we've heard
a lot of great things about you,

362
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,362
and we're excited to have you.

363
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,364
- Really? Good.
That's great.

364
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,065
- Well, what do you think
of the beer, man?

365
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,066
- Um, well...

366
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:05,169
- Have a sip.

367
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,537
- Pressure's on now.

368
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,872
Big reaction.

369
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:08,873
- What do you taste, sir?

370
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,241
Can you taste the hops?

371
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,910
- Uh, I have to go take care
of something.

372
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,378
- I taste skinned knees and...

373
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,113
- I'll be right back.
Will you be cool here?

374
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16,614
- I will. I will.
Jelly sandwiches and...

375
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,049
- Jelly sandwiches!

376
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,884
- Dark clouds of puberty
on the horizon.

377
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,419
No, I don't know.

378
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,196
Where do you--
where do you teach?

379
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:33,464
- I teach at Orr.

380
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,533
I teach Special Ed.

381
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,468
- Oh. Oh, wow.

382
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,203
- Yeah.

383
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,273
- Yeah, that's--so you really--
you really teach.

384
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,274
I guess, yeah.

385
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,342
- I mean--yeah.

386
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,110
You have--yeah.
- Yeah.

387
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,912
- You have a Master's?

388
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,982
- Uh, I was teaching
while I was getting my Master's.

389
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,917
There was a program,
and--yeah.

390
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,154
- That's, um--
I find that really impressive.

391
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,523
- Well, thank you. Yeah.

392
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,461
- Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

393
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,462
Sorry.
Oh, I apologize.

394
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,030
- Oh, pardon me.

395
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,465
- Oh, I didn't realize
that was you.

396
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,367
Oh, what a gross-looking plate.
- I am so hungry.

397
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,635
I have not eaten anything
all day.

398
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:11,669
- It's all hot mustard, Kate.

399
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,137
- That's all I need.

400
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,541
- You know, I read something,
ah...

401
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,543
I think Camus wrote about

402
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:22,046
Sisyphus pushing the boulder up,
you know, the hill?

403
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,649
And he always pictured him
smiling?

404
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,018
Um...

405
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,287
You know, as opposed
to a punishment thing,

406
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,090
and I feel that sometimes
things that are really hard

407
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,325
can be--
can be really rewarding

408
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,029
because they're hard,
you know?

409
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,298
- Chris is a great guy.

410
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,532
- He is, right?
- He's a great guy.

411
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,134
He told me about you guys,
though,

412
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,036
that weird thing
that happened the other night.

413
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,504
- You're a dick.
He didn't say anything.

414
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,972
- No, he said you're a--

415
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,440
- Have fun. Good-bye.
- All right.

416
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,679
- Thank you.
Thanks for showing me that.

417
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,314
- Yeah.
Hey, man, it was really fun.

418
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,648
- You get a tour?
- Yeah, I did. I did, yeah.

419
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,683
- I gave him a tour
of the whole place.

420
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,184
Yeah, it was kind of awesome.

421
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,386
- That's cool.
- He got into it.

422
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,655
- Yeah, um,
who cleans all this up?

423
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,557
- You're looking at
the cleaning crew right now.

424
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,159
- All right, can I help?

425
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,527
- We're gonna clean it up.
You guys go.

426
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,062
- Really?

427
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,697
- Yeah, I talked to Mike
and Frank and the guys.

428
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,065
We're gonna do it.

429
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,199
You set it up.
We'll clean it.

430
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,234
- We'll stick around if...

431
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,335
- No, you guys, honestly, go.

432
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,469
You've done enough.

433
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:19,570
- See what I just did?
- Yeah?

434
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:20,738
- See that?

435
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,173
- Thank you.

436
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,374
All right, okay.

437
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,542
I won't say no.
Good to see you.

438
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,743
- It was so good to see you.

439
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,545
- You too.
I'll see you soon.

440
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,547
- Hey, it was a real pleasure.
- Yeah, it's awesome.

441
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,315
- Congratulations on, you know,
the thing.

442
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,550
- All right,
I'll see you at work.

443
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,318
- Really great to meet you.

444
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,487
- I heard that we might stop by
your tasting this weekend.

445
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,322
- Oh, yeah.
No, I hope you do.

446
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,425
I'm there from noon to 2:00,
so whenever you guys want.

447
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:41,659
- Ice cream brunch.
- I love it.

448
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,660
- Good night, guys.
- Bye.

449
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,595
- Good night.

450
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,197
I'm not cleaning.

451
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,565
- You're cleaning.
I'm not cleaning.

452
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:51,335
- Oh, you're cleaning.

453
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,137
- I'm not lifting a finger.

454
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,307
- Yeah. No, absolutely.

455
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,276
It's--
we have one, two--

456
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:01,379
I have nine tastings
this month,

457
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,547
but I can put you in.

458
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,649
- Kate...

459
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,217
Jill's outside.

460
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,485
- I'm ready.
I just have to finish.

461
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,653
- Then let's go.
- I'm going.

462
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,756
But I can do this next week.

463
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,324
Not this weekend.

464
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,661
Nope,
I have a festival this weekend.

465
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,396
But I can do this next week,

466
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,498
and I'll bring whatever
year-ends we have available.

467
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,732
Okay?
Thank you.

468
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,101
I'll call you on Monday.

469
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,268
Okay, bye.

470
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,340
Have wallet...

471
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,585
- All right, I got it.

472
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,094
- All right.

473
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,395
Come on in.

474
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,064
Why don't you
put the groceries down,

475
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,166
and we'll just leave 'em,
and...

476
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,236
- Wow.

477
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,737
Big reveal.

478
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,606
- Oh, yeah, I can't
really take responsibility

479
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,307
for the decoration.

480
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,176
My cousin and her kids
kind of come up here a lot.

481
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,544
- No, I love it.
She likes patterns.

482
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,179
- Most of it
really hasn't been changed

483
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,715
probably in 40 years,
either.

484
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,517
Um...

485
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,856
All right.

486
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,792
Here's a bathroom
if anybody needs it.

487
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:25,163
Um, I expect you might.

488
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,865
It is--we're on a septic
line,

489
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,569
so try not to put any...
down that thing.

490
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,137
Great.

491
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,572
You guys are gonna be
in this room here.

492
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:35,840
- Where do I put my tampons?

493
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,408
- You keep them in a bag.

494
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,409
- Is this us?

495
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,777
- This is you.

496
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,213
- What? In a cabin,
you keep them in a bag?

497
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,781
- Why don't you two settle in,

498
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,650
clean up
if you want to clean up,

499
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,818
and we'll go
put the groceries away,

500
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,620
and then, you know,

501
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,722
if you want to crack a beer
or two or something.

502
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,157
- Oh, yes, please.

503
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,492
- Yeah, welcome,
but just, you know,

504
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:55,660
make yourself at home,
okay?

505
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,328
- Thank you, man.
- Great.

506
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,498
- What is that?

507
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,799
It's really cute.

508
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,434
- Yeah, it is.

509
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,236
I've got you alone in a cabin
with this thing.

510
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,337
How's the bed?

511
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,273
- Uh...

512
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,274
Oh, it's squishy.

513
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:11,375
- It is?

514
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,412
- It's really--oop.

515
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,515
I feel like
we're gonna break it.

516
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:18,950
We're good.

517
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,336
- Hi.

518
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:40,371
- Morning.

519
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,774
You think I could make eggs
or something?

520
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,844
- Yeah, sure.

521
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,380
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

522
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:56,621
For a man who has everything,
he's only got little bowls.

523
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:57,788
Sorry.

524
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,557
That was a terrible joke.

525
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,461
Eggs?

526
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,563
- Sure, yeah.

527
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,846
- You close with your parents?

528
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:24,949
- Sort of.
- Sort of.

529
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,983
- I mean, we talk.

530
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:26,984
I talk to them.

531
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:29,520
- Yeah.

532
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,989
- We don't hate each other.

533
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,958
- That's a positive.

534
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,893
- Are you?

535
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,430
Hey!

536
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,831
- Hey!

537
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,500
You're up.

538
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,673
- You look great.

539
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:49,974
- Oh, thank you.

540
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,442
- Here, let me help you up.

541
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,411
- Oh, <i>merci.</i>
<i>- How are ya?</i>

542
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,746
- Got a mouthful of hair
just then, sorry. Sorry.

543
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:58,316
- Good. I prefer it.
- Good.

544
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,483
- Hey. Morning.

545
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,484
- Thanks for having us.

546
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,320
- Sure. My pleasure.

547
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,388
Just coming to see if I can
interest you guys in a hike,

548
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,723
a little trail hike.

549
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,491
- Will it offend you at all
if I say no?

550
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,693
- Absolutely not.

551
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:09,827
- No way, then.
I'm not going.

552
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,862
If you don't mind.

553
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,431
- Doesn't offend me at all.
- Awesome.

554
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,933
- Yeah, maybe--how about you?
You want to go?

555
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,536
- I...

556
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:30,414
- Probably spent the first month
trying to figure out

557
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,851
what was in it for her,
you know.

558
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,554
But I guess you have to take
a person at their word

559
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,022
that...

560
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,960
They're actually into you,
you know?

561
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,695
I don't know.

562
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:48,032
It's hard to figure women out.

563
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,033
- Well...

564
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,501
- Still working on it.

565
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,570
- I mean,
you're an interesting...

566
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,539
- Polite gentleman.

567
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,511
I'm sure that's...

568
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,713
- That's a good way to put it.
- I'm sure that's a big factor.

569
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,749
- No, that's a lovely--
that's a lovely way to put it.

570
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,016
- Well,
I'll bet a lot of people...

571
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,017
- I'm probably a little--

572
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,652
- Interesting gentlemen

573
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,488
don't necessarily come in there
all the time.

574
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,590
- I'm probably somewhere
on the Asperger's spectrum.

575
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:15,326
That's probably
a little closer to it.

576
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:16,594
- All right, you ready?
- Yes.

577
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,095
- What's your first bet?

578
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,897
- What's a good first bet?
$5?

579
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,499
- We're gonna--
way more than that.

580
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,867
Let's say $100 minimum
at this table.

581
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:23,868
This is VIP.

582
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,069
- I don't have $100.

583
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,405
- Well,
the house will give you $1,000.

584
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,739
Not give you, but as a credit.

585
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,975
- Oh, I was like,
"I love gambling!"

586
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,576
- Yeah, you just went...

587
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,912
No, the house
will spot you $1,000,

588
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,414
because we know
you're good for it.

589
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,015
- Great.
- So $100.

590
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,750
- Okay, I shouldn't--
$100.

591
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,519
- Yeah, you don't want to go
$1,000 to start.

592
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:42,720
You want to go more?

593
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:43,921
- No, I'll start with $100.

594
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,490
- Okay.
Good luck to you.

595
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,559
A nine versus a face.

596
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,562
- Hit me.

597
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:52,830
- We got a nine and an eight.

598
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,566
That's a hard 17.

599
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,867
What do you say?

600
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,970
- Hit me.
- You want to hit with a 17?

601
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,472
- Yeah, hit me.
- That is a very bold--

602
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:02,907
And a bust, ma'am.
That is a 23.

603
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,475
We're really sorry.
You're down $100.

604
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:05,810
- That's okay.

605
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:09,113
- I was gonna say,
I wonder sometimes,

606
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:13,751
you know, if I'd have met
somebody like her or you

607
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:18,088
or, you know, somebody
that had that kind of...

608
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,492
thing going on
15 years ago...

609
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,862
Well, you know what?
I probably did.

610
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,798
I probably did meet somebody
like that.

611
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,701
And I probably
wasn't paying attention.

612
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,079
- You have lost every hand.

613
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,682
You are down $1,000.

614
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,150
I am yet to see my cards.

615
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:49,653
- Will the casino kindly give me
another $1,000?

616
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,055
- I'll tell you--
- I'm good for it.

617
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:52,490
- Kate, I--

618
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,491
- This is like college.

619
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,426
- I have never done this before,

620
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,561
but I'll talk to the pit boss.

621
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,996
We'll give you
another $1,000!

622
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,164
- Yes! Thank you.

623
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,465
- You better win it back, kid.

624
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,567
'Cause if you lose $2,000,

625
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,536
I personally
am gonna bust your legs.

626
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:06,670
- I'm all warmed up now.

627
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,771
- How much?

628
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,106
- $100.

629
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,641
- That low right now?

630
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:12,109
- You're right.
- Let's get weird.

631
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,777
- $300?

632
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,212
- Now we're talking.
Good luck, ma'am.

633
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,214
I really mean that.
I do work off tips.

634
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:19,049
- This thing's amazing.
Where'd you get that?

635
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:22,753
- It kind of came
with my--my pack.

636
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:23,754
- It's fantastic.

637
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:24,755
- It's a little--yeah.

638
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,056
It's a little dinky,

639
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,992
but it's got the tarp
underneath.

640
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:30,528
- Yeah, it's, like, waterproof.
- So it's, like, heavy-duty.

641
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,896
- It's perfect.
Absolutely perfect.

642
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,831
Yeah.

643
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:34,832
- Oh, wow.

644
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,734
Okay.

645
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:41,005
- I didn't think I brought--
was glasses for the wine.

646
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:42,873
But we can probably
just swig out of the bottle.

647
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,508
Are you cool
with that?

648
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,844
- No, no.
I'm happy to see this.

649
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,213
I've--I've been
kind of dreading this,

650
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,082
'cause I felt
like you were so impressed

651
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,251
by my outdoorsy-ness.

652
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:55,486
- Yeah?

653
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:56,554
- And, um...

654
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:57,788
Uh, this is actually...

655
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,723
- Are you fucking kidding me?

656
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,958
Are you kidding me with that?

657
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,092
- I know.
It's embarrassing.

658
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,260
- Who are you?

659
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,796
- It's--I'm a bourgeois pig.

660
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,831
- That is--that is gorgeous.

661
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,266
Look at that.
Oh, my God.

662
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,569
- I know. It's got,
like, silverware and--

663
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:12,603
- Nah, that's great.

664
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,071
- It has a cheese board.

665
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,906
- You saved the day.
No, you just saved the day.

666
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:16,907
That's fantastic.

667
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,842
- Now I'm fine.

668
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,578
- I love it.

669
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,280
- Yeah, I thought,
"I'll use this all the time."

670
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:26,650
- Jill, you're not
fucking around, are you?

671
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,086
- But this is actually the first
time I've gotten to use it,

672
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,854
so thank you.

673
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:33,524
- I'm honored.

674
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:34,625
All right.

675
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:36,060
Here's to not fucking around.

676
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:37,628
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

677
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,196
- Can I get rid of these onions?
Is that fair?

678
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:40,798
- No, that's part of it.

679
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,566
- All right, let's have
one humongous sandwich,

680
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,234
and we'll cut it in half.

681
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,203
We won't use mayo.
- That's a perfect compromise.

682
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,773
This is the best sandwich ever.

683
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,108
- Wait.

684
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,910
- Can we get this disgustingness
off the top?

685
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,245
- Yeah.

686
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,081
I don't know
if I put enough mustard on.

687
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,216
- You have to put
a lot of mustard on.

688
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,053
- I feel like I might--

689
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,321
may be
about to embarrass myself.

690
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,624
My heart's beating really fast.

691
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:09,159
Um...

692
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:12,229
- How come?

693
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,598
- Is that just me?

694
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,567
Maybe that's just me.

695
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:17,901
Sorry.

696
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,339
- How come?

697
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,641
What's going on?

698
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,042
- Um...

699
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,714
No, I just had, like,
a nervous feeling.

700
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:34,084
Um, but that just might be...

701
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,888
That just might be all me.

702
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,734
- Oh, no, don't do that.

703
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:52,169
Don't do that.

704
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,273
We're even.

705
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,307
- Yeah, all right.

706
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,043
- We're even.
- Okay.

707
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,712
- Allow the moment to be even.

708
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,013
You don't say soy cheese.

709
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,248
I don't say mayo.

710
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,350
We're adults.

711
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,851
Oh, you are the worst.

712
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,153
Luckily I caught it.

713
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:11,655
Look at you.

714
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:12,923
You're a pirate.

715
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,029
- That help?

716
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,275
- Okay, go!

717
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,479
- Oh!

718
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:16,854
- Ah, fuck.

719
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:17,855
- Here.
- Okay.

720
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,423
10:00.

721
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,791
Oh.

722
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,832
You broke my finger.

723
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,472
- Don't even think about it!

724
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,775
- Come on!

725
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,084
- Hey, doing okay?

726
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,886
- Mm-hmm. You?

727
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:50,521
- Good.

728
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,133
- Oh.
Let me give you this.

729
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:39,236
- Oh, thanks.

730
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,839
You don't--
I don't need it if...

731
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,841
- No, it's fine, I made a--

732
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:44,875
It's fine.

733
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,343
- Yeah.

734
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,287
- Are you gonna do that
the whole time?

735
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:58,989
- I might, yeah.

736
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,490
I might.

737
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,326
I want to see where you are.

738
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:03,327
- Good part.

739
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:04,328
- Do you like it?

740
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,263
- I do.

741
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,516
- Remember, jacks and jokers.

742
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:29,853
- Okay.

743
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,188
No!

744
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,456
- 'Cause if you hit
accidentally,

745
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:33,824
you have to get punished for it.

746
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:34,825
- No!

747
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:36,560
- Ah, damn it. Oh, fuck!

748
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,061
- That's a seven!

749
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,130
- All right,
so you get all those,

750
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,131
and I get punished.

751
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,966
- I decide.

752
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,134
- That's right.

753
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,903
- When we started,
you said seven.

754
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,604
- Faster, faster, faster.

755
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:51,174
Faster, faster. Faster!

756
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,609
Ah!

757
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,380
- Which one do you want to do?

758
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:58,081
You want to deal,
or you want to slap?

759
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,082
- I want you to deal.

760
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,083
No, I want you to deal.

761
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,418
- Okay.

762
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,287
- Five seconds on the deal.

763
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,454
I'll do the first three.

764
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:05,455
You do the last one.

765
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:06,456
- Okay, okay, okay.

766
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,557
- Okay, ready?

767
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,558
Do you feel good?

768
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,395
- Yeah, I'm ready.

769
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:12,896
- So is that what you choose
to do?

770
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,231
- Yes.
- Then do this for the cameras.

771
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,866
- Oh.

772
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:17,334
- There's a camera above us
at all times,

773
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,469
so you go like this,
and if you want to--okay.

774
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,471
If you want to hit,
you go like this.

775
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,240
And then you clear your hands

776
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,508
to make sure
you're not stealing chips.

777
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,510
- Shouldn't you hit
on the 14?

778
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:28,578
- No, 'cause you have
to think about what I'm playing.

779
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,113
- Not against a three.
Okay.

780
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,581
- So what would you like to do,
ma'am?

781
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,417
- I'll stay.
- That's a very smart stay.

782
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,985
That's a bad card for you.

783
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:36,286
Now I have an eight.

784
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,121
Now I have an 11.

785
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,456
Now I have an 18.

786
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,125
You lost that hand, that's--
hey!

787
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,126
Are we being...
- Sorry.

788
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,328
- Are we being way too loud?

789
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,630
- No, no.
No, you guys are fine.

790
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,298
I was just coming to hang out.

791
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,033
- Are you saying
we're totally fine,

792
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,368
but we're being
way too loud?

793
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,402
- No, no, he's asleep.

794
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:53,437
- He got me drunk...

795
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,438
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

796
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,139
- And I lost so badly.

797
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,941
- And she's a total lightweight.
Here, drink this.

798
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,343
- And then he was beating me up.

799
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,677
- Are you drinking or...
- I'll get my own.

800
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,412
- Deal.

801
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,281
Okay, you're up $100.
What would you like to do?

802
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,416
- Do you guys need anything?
- Yeah, let's have another.

803
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:07,951
Let's just get a couple
on the table.

804
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:09,019
- Okay.

805
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,153
- Okay, so you lost that hand.

806
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,154
You're down 100 bucks.

807
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,389
- She saw me lose.

808
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,024
- It's fine.
- Okay.

809
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:16,326
- She lost
a lot of money earlier.

810
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,067
All right.

811
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:27,004
- Why are you so good
at blackjack?

812
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:28,605
- 'Cause when I was younger,

813
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,641
I used to work on
the riverboats in the casinos.

814
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,276
- What?

815
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,278
- Yeah, my family,
we all played cards growing up.

816
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,015
So when I was, like,
19 or 20 or whatever,

817
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,716
my buddy got me a job,
or an interview,

818
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,351
with this Chinese guy

819
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,954
who ran a company
called "Network Management."

820
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,324
- Which is just, like,
a fake company.

821
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:48,325
And then I got the job.

822
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:49,993
It was an hourly wage.

823
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,995
And he sent me on the boats
with 10,000 bucks

824
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,730
for eight-hour shifts.

825
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,967
I just played, you know,
with the company's money.

826
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:59,202
So I was just a worker,

827
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,638
but my game was,
you know, cards.

828
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,674
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.

829
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,343
Should we go have a smoke?

830
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:08,445
You want to sit outside?
- Okay.

831
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:10,747
- You want to?
- Yeah.

832
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:13,116
- I don't want to wake her up.

833
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,294
Here, I'll grab that.

834
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,729
- That's the problem
with heartbreak,

835
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,664
is that to you,
it's like an atomic bomb,

836
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,267
and to the world,
it's just really clich,

837
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,335
because, in the end,
we all have the same experience.

838
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,771
- But it's just you and me.

839
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:38,308
- I was madly,
madly in love with him,

840
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,312
and we were total soul mates
and totally in love.

841
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:46,383
And then he said,

842
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:50,620
"I think maybe
we should just not."

843
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:54,157
I think he said something
along the lines of,

844
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,525
"I think we should, uh"--

845
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,160
and he's not, like,
a football player,

846
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,129
so this is a weird thing
for him to say--

847
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,698
"I think we should take a knee
on this romance stuff."

848
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,266
- What does that mean?
That's so lame.

849
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,768
- I actually
had to ask somebody.

850
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,104
I was like,
"Is 'take a knee' a good thing?"

851
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,105
- No.

852
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,439
- No.
- No.

853
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,441
- You've obviously
got a lot of love,

854
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,809
so that's there.

855
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,245
Some people don't.
Some people are snakes.

856
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,447
And you're fun.

857
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,649
And if Chris is lucky...

858
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:22,619
You know,
you have babies

859
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,354
and do all that good stuff

860
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:29,126
and live in this house
or a house equivalent to this.

861
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:32,262
- Yeah, you guys could come over
and play bridge.

862
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,263
- Fuckin' pass.

863
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:37,100
By the way, I'm not doing
more double dates, either.

864
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,401
This was fun.

865
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:39,536
- You love it.

866
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:42,539
- No, I'm having a good time.

867
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,708
You know what I want to do,
Kate?

868
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,809
- Mm?

869
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:46,843
- If you don't want to do it,

870
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:50,147
this is your chance to get out.

871
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,314
- Okay.

872
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,817
- I want to make a huge fire.

873
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,285
I'm good at making fires.

874
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:57,387
I can do it.

875
00:35:57,389 --> 00:36:00,690
And we'll sit by the fire
and relax on the beach.

876
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,793
And fall asleep
on the fucking sand.

877
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,729
And if we don't fall
asleep--

878
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,831
because there's a good chance
it's too uncomfortable

879
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,566
to fall asleep--

880
00:36:09,568 --> 00:36:10,800
we'll put the fire out,
and we'll go to bed.

881
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,202
- Okay.

882
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:13,270
- Do you want to do that?
- Yes.

883
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:14,538
- Does that sound fun to you?

884
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,306
- Yes.
- Are you just saying that?

885
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:17,574
Do you really think
it sounds fun?

886
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:18,708
- I think it sounds really fun.

887
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,177
- Are you just saying that,

888
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,845
or do you really think
it sounds fun?

889
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,314
- I think it sounds really fun.
- Okay, then we'll do that.

890
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,483
- What about
if we don't fall asleep

891
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:27,651
and we stay up all night?

892
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:29,819
Are you okay with that?

893
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:33,857
- Yeah, I think that's only,
like, four hours away anyway.

894
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:34,858
That's fine.

895
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,660
- That's pretty great.

896
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,562
- That's pretty great.
- That's pretty great.

897
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,907
- I have an idea.

898
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,276
Let's go swimming.

899
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,811
Why not?

900
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:57,547
- 'Cause it's 2:00 or 3:00
in the morning.

901
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,916
We got a great fire
and a six pack of beer.

902
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:04,154
- So we can go into the water
and come back and get warm.

903
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:05,155
Let's go.
I'm gonna go in.

904
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:06,323
- Don't.

905
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:07,724
- I'm gonna go in.
- Don't!

906
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,459
- Why not?
- Kate, just don't do this.

907
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,428
- Why not?
- No, don't go in the water.

908
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,296
- Why not?

909
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:14,297
Last chance.

910
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,532
- Kate, stop it.

911
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:17,234
- Last chance.

912
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,269
Come swimming with me.

913
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:22,772
Come on! Please?

914
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,913
- You're crazy!

915
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,244
- Got it?

916
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:35,345
- I just got one.

917
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,981
I could--this is us.

918
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,482
- I got it.

919
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,851
- Oh, jeez, it's a hassle.

920
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:42,852
You got it?

921
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,688
- Yeah, I got it.

922
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,257
- Hey, listen, if you guys ever
need anything, give me a call.

923
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,893
- Really fun.
- Yeah. So fun.

924
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:50,994
- Thank you.

925
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,696
- Thank you.
- So much.

926
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:53,697
So great.

927
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,265
- Sleep well, guys.

928
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:56,433
- See you later.

929
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:57,434
- You have keys?

930
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:58,635
- Yes.

931
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:02,772
- Hey.

932
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,040
Do you want me to drive?

933
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:07,677
- No,
I kind of need to talk to you.

934
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,446
Um...

935
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:12,615
Do you want to go--
is there some place--

936
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,050
Where do you want to go?

937
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:16,052
- Home.
Can we just go home?

938
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:19,522
I'm really tired. I'm...

939
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,991
- Yeah, okay. All right.

940
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,694
Maybe we'll just drive a bit.

941
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,769
- All right,
I hope you pussies

942
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:08,071
are up
for some drinking tonight!

943
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,839
- Look at this entrance.

944
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:13,543
- No one's going home
to their significant other,

945
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:15,512
because I no longer have one.

946
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:17,414
That's right!

947
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:20,583
The shackles are off.

948
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,785
I'm free.

949
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:22,786
Thank you.
Thank you.

950
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,623
Thank you.
Thank you.

951
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,392
So anyway,
get yourselves prepared.

952
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:30,393
Do what you need to do.

953
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:32,429
Cancel on your wives,

954
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,798
and, um,
I'll see you pussies tonight.

955
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,865
- Okay.

956
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:36,933
- All right?
- Yeah.

957
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,168
- Bye.

958
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,107
- Sorry.

959
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,409
Hey.

960
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:47,544
What?

961
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:48,545
- For you.
- Is that for me?

962
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:49,546
- Yes, the candle fell in.

963
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:50,547
- Thanks, Gene.

964
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:51,748
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

965
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,016
- Thanks, guys.
- To your new life.

966
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,050
- To your freedom.

967
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:55,585
- Yes.

968
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:56,986
- It's a personality thing.

969
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,522
I would advise someone
in a reverse situation

970
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:00,790
to give you more--

971
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,025
- Oh-oh, got 'em.
Got 'em.

972
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,026
Two shots of Malort.

973
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:04,427
- Uh, no.

974
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:05,662
- Right from the basement.
Go on.

975
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,464
- I'm not drinking the Malort.

976
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:08,998
- You're gonna have to.
- It's a Chicago tradition.

977
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,700
You're single.
This'll erase all past mistakes.

978
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:11,868
- I'm single!

979
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,136
It does?
- Makes room for new ones.

980
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,938
- Oh, my God!
- Here we go.

981
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,607
- It's like swallowing
a burnt condom full of gas.

982
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:20,009
- Ah!

983
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,611
Ugh.

984
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:25,048
- Look at that weird form.

985
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,716
- Well, it's this damn heater,
you know?

986
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,184
I don't know.

987
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,189
- Uh-oh.

988
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,190
- There she is.

989
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,191
- Up top.

990
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:37,494
- Hey!
- Aw.

991
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:39,762
Thanks.

992
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,030
- You okay?

993
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,132
- Yeah. Yeah.

994
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,133
Yeah.
- Crazy.

995
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:45,134
- No, it's good, though.

996
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,669
- You sure?

997
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,971
- Yeah. It's--I'm young,
you know?

998
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:49,472
- Of course you're young.

999
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:50,874
- Don't hold me down.
- No, yeah.

1000
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:51,941
- Can't hold me back.

1001
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,209
- Hey, come outside with me.

1002
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,677
Let's have a cigarette
and talk.

1003
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,745
- No.
I'm gonna see you inside.

1004
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:57,447
I'm gonna play games.

1005
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:58,848
- Hey, get out here.
Let's have one cigarette.

1006
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,149
- No!
- I want to hear what happened.

1007
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,085
- Come back soon.

1008
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,158
- You're the prettiest girl
at work.

1009
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,960
- I'm the only girl at work.

1010
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13,496
- Still.
You still are the prettiest.

1011
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,064
You could have been
the ugliest girl at work

1012
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,232
and still been the only one.

1013
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:17,934
You're not.
- True, true.

1014
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,168
- I've been ten minutes out
since I got here.

1015
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,637
I had one of these,
and then I said,

1016
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,771
"I'm gonna have one of those,"

1017
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,172
and then here I am.

1018
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:25,475
- Yeah, it's hard
once it starts going in.

1019
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:26,476
- I don't know what I am.

1020
00:42:26,478 --> 00:42:28,044
Four or five in?

1021
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,512
- You're five in?

1022
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:30,947
- I might've.
- Oh.

1023
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:33,249
- But I had a turkey burger
earlier, so...

1024
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,485
- You're really
keeping it together.

1025
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:38,221
- Yeah, I'm a quiet drunk.

1026
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,722
- You're right!

1027
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:40,723
Oh, my God!

1028
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,592
- I know.
- What?

1029
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:44,727
- Let it sink in, 'cause
I've been thinking about it for,

1030
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,262
like, an hour and a half.

1031
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:47,997
- It's really our bottom half.
- That's right.

1032
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,132
Top half, I win for sure.

1033
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:51,668
- Yeah. I'm gonna leave.

1034
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,870
- I like how wear--
we are, right?

1035
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:54,871
The same everything.

1036
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:56,205
- Guys? I'm gonna go.

1037
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:57,907
- Gene, good night.
Always a pleasure.

1038
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,742
- Hey, good night.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1039
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,743
See you tomorrow.

1040
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,879
- Bye, Gene.

1041
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:06,282
- And he wears it every time
we all get together.

1042
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:08,685
No, 'cause
it's a conversation starter!

1043
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:10,286
- We wouldn't have jobs
if it wasn't for Gene.

1044
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:11,988
I respect Gene.

1045
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,290
I respect Gene,
and I respect your jean choice.

1046
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,925
Because they're the same
as mine.

1047
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,827
- Yeah, because
they're the same as yours.

1048
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,262
- Yeah. It's cool.

1049
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,897
- Hey, I'm gonna take off.
Want a ride?

1050
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:22,966
- Luke. Luke. Luke.
Luke, look at our legs.

1051
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:24,834
Look at all how...

1052
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:25,969
It looks like the same person!

1053
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:27,203
- She's melted.

1054
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:28,605
She's melting in her shoes.

1055
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,073
- Yeah,
we wear the same clothes!

1056
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:31,641
- Would you like a ride home?
I'm gonna go.

1057
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:32,742
I'm happy
to put your bike in my car.

1058
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,177
- No, you can't go.

1059
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:35,778
- I'm gonna give you a ride.
Let's go.

1060
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,113
- Lock the doors.
- Come on. Let's go.

1061
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,748
- Why? No, come on.

1062
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,016
- She's good, man.
She's good.

1063
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:42,051
- I'm not talking to you,
dude.

1064
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,153
- But you know she's good.
She's fine. She'll get home.

1065
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:45,154
- Luke...

1066
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,690
Stay.

1067
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,759
Does he say that
in <i>Star Wars?</i>

1068
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,729
- Kate, you want a ride home?

1069
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:53,763
- Nah, I'm good.

1070
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:54,897
- Okay.

1071
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,268
- Boo.

1072
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:02,138
But wait,
I need to take a photo.

1073
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,740
- Instagram?
You gonna Instagram it?

1074
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:04,941
- I'm gonna mentally Instagram.

1075
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:06,042
- Okay.

1076
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:07,844
- In the future,
you can do that.

1077
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:10,113
- That's true.

1078
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:11,280
- You home?

1079
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:12,582
- Hey.

1080
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:13,783
- Hey, where are ya?

1081
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:15,018
- I'm in here.

1082
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,222
Hey, baby.

1083
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:20,990
- Hey.

1084
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,695
What are you doing?

1085
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,330
- Just working.

1086
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:30,733
Can you bring me home
a shipping crate from work?

1087
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:33,036
I was gonna put it on its side,

1088
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:35,104
then put this in,
and then, like, mount it...

1089
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,739
- Sure.
- On the wall.

1090
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:38,207
- That's easy enough.
How many you want?

1091
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,343
- Just one.

1092
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:41,878
- Okay.
I'm gonna get a beer.

1093
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,212
You want anything
from the kitchen?

1094
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:44,213
- No, thank you.

1095
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:45,214
- Nothing?

1096
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:46,215
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

1097
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:47,216
- Thank you, baby.

1098
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,818
- Okay.

1099
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,326
Hey, you want to hear
something crazy?

1100
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:59,395
- Yeah.

1101
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:03,800
- Um, Kate broke up with Chris.

1102
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:12,208
Yeah,
broke his heart or something.

1103
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,143
- What, today?

1104
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,678
- All--I don't know.

1105
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,747
I think last night
or early this morning.

1106
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:19,782
I mean, she literally
walked in this morning--

1107
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:21,317
you know,
you know how much I like Kate,

1108
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,152
but it's the thing about her
that's annoying,

1109
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:24,921
where you're like--

1110
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,657
You know, she came in, literally
going like, "I'm free!"

1111
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:30,126
That's why everybody
went out drinking tonight.

1112
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:32,795
She had, like,
a party tonight

1113
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:34,430
about being free from Chris.

1114
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:35,798
And I like Chris.

1115
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,367
- Yeah.

1116
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:39,368
- Who knows.

1117
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,770
- Um...

1118
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:41,804
- Do you mind if I go watch TV?

1119
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:43,206
I feel, like, emotionally--

1120
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,941
- No, that's fine.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1121
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:45,942
- Do you care?

1122
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:47,110
- No, I'm just gonna...

1123
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:48,711
- Keep doing this?
- Mm-hmm.

1124
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:51,414
- You want to go to bed
in, like, 45 minutes?

1125
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,415
- Okay.

1126
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,150
- Good.

1127
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:19,008
- Hey, babe?

1128
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,376
Did I tell you,

1129
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:22,445
I think I might actually go
to Costa Rica?

1130
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,947
- No, you didn't.

1131
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,282
- Yeah.

1132
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,717
- I thought
you didn't want to go.

1133
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,952
- No, I didn't.

1134
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,790
Yeah, I just thought it was
gonna be kind of like a bummer,

1135
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:35,925
like, trying
to re-create college,

1136
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:39,896
but I was, like,
texting with Kelly,

1137
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,931
and the more
I thought about it,

1138
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:44,433
I just, like--I think
I'll be sad if I don't go.

1139
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:46,402
- Fun.
How long are you gonna go?

1140
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:47,737
- Just, like, a week.

1141
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:50,039
- Wow.
- Is that okay?

1142
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,808
- Yeah, I just thought
you didn't want to go.

1143
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,776
- Okay.

1144
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:55,778
But I'm not, like,
putting you out?

1145
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,181
- No.
- Okay.

1146
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,019
Hey, babe, um...

1147
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,022
Can I bring something up?

1148
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,392
But you have to promise
not to get mad.

1149
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:12,261
- Jill, are you kidding me?

1150
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,464
- Uh...

1151
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:16,833
No, it's not--it's not bad.

1152
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:17,967
- Okay, what?
- It's not--no.

1153
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:19,001
I just feel like--

1154
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,938
- Please.

1155
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,272
- Okay.

1156
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:29,345
If we want to get married...

1157
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,913
- Which we do.

1158
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:35,084
- Uh, I think...

1159
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,552
it is in our best interest

1160
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:40,156
to reopen that--

1161
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:42,124
- Continue having
great relationship.

1162
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:44,293
- I just, uh...

1163
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:46,429
I would love to reopen the floor
for that conversation.

1164
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,964
- Absolutely.

1165
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,398
I think the last time
we talked about it

1166
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,500
is where we still kind of
stand--at least for me--

1167
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:52,935
that we are gonna get married.

1168
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:54,370
We just have to find
the right time

1169
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,205
when we're not
as slammed to figure it all out.

1170
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,007
- Yeah.

1171
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:00,009
- 'Cause figuring it out's
kind of the boring part.

1172
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:01,510
- Totally. Um...

1173
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:04,013
Yeah, figuring it out
is the boring part.

1174
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:06,182
Um...

1175
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:10,419
No, I just don't want to, like,
be that couple that's like,

1176
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:14,423
"Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we're getting married."

1177
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:16,092
Uh, yeah.

1178
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:20,129
I just would like to have
a conversation about it.

1179
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:21,464
- Okay.

1180
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:23,099
- We don't have to do it
right now.

1181
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,100
- Great. Great.

1182
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:25,501
- All right.

1183
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:27,336
- Can we not do--honestly,
I feel brain-dead.

1184
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:29,572
- No, no, no, it's--
- I'm tired.

1185
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,941
But I do feel the same way
that I feel.

1186
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:34,977
Like, you know where I'm at.

1187
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:36,579
- Okay.
- Do you know where I'm at?

1188
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,915
- Yeah, but I feel--
but what I'm saying is,

1189
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,149
that I think that...

1190
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,353
If it just feels like
it's gonna happen...

1191
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:45,621
- Right.

1192
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:47,123
- We're never gonna
actually do it.

1193
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,124
- Right.

1194
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:49,892
- Um, look at that.

1195
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:51,294
That was--
- Look at that.

1196
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:52,528
- That's it.
That's everything.

1197
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,629
That's the whole convo.

1198
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:54,931
- Are you upset with me at all?

1199
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,165
Be honest.

1200
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,333
- No.
- Okay.

1201
00:48:57,335 --> 00:48:58,601
- Are you upset with me?
Like, I...

1202
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,303
- No.
- I don't want to be the--

1203
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:02,972
- And I do want to get married,
and I do want to do it.

1204
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:05,074
It's just--I feel like
there's gonna be the right time

1205
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:06,876
to get into it,

1206
00:49:06,878 --> 00:49:08,377
'cause it's gonna be
so much planning and work.

1207
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:10,112
- It is.
You're right.

1208
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:14,383
- And I think the right moment
will present itself...

1209
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:16,452
if we continue to have these
talks to get us there.

1210
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,621
- Awesome. Awesome.

1211
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:19,889
- Good?

1212
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:21,490
- We're so connected.

1213
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:23,526
I feel like
you're reading my mind.

1214
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,027
- Really?
How connected are we?

1215
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:28,898
- She's not wasting any time.

1216
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,433
- Yeah, well...

1217
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:32,535
I'm kind of--I feel bad
that I know, to be honest.

1218
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:34,003
- Really?

1219
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:35,237
- What's up, boys?
- A little bit.

1220
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:36,238
Morning.

1221
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,239
- You guys get after it?

1222
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,407
- How you doing?

1223
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:39,642
- Good.
How late did you guys get?

1224
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,143
- Not late enough, apparently.

1225
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,411
- Yeah, yeah, right.

1226
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:44,080
You want to go in on a plaque?

1227
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:45,948
- Not particularly.
Do I have to?

1228
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,283
- Yeah,
we're getting Dave a plaque.

1229
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:48,517
- Yeah.

1230
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,619
- You know Ryan at the bar?
- Yeah.

1231
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,188
- Dave went home with Kate
last night.

1232
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,522
- They were making out
on the street.

1233
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,358
- That's bullshit.

1234
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,460
- Making out in the street.
- Before they got in the cab.

1235
00:49:57,462 --> 00:49:59,228
- You guys saw it?
- Not just splitting a cab.

1236
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,229
- Ryan saw it.
- Ryan.

1237
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:01,931
- Ryan saw it.

1238
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:04,000
If you can't trust him,
who can you trust, right?

1239
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:05,067
Kind of sucks.

1240
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:06,068
- Yeah.
- Here's Dave.

1241
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,403
We can find out from the source.

1242
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:08,971
- I kind of feel,
like, bad that I know,

1243
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:10,339
because
how's she gonna walk in here?

1244
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,674
- Yeah, totally.
That's crazy, man.

1245
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,175
I wouldn't put
those two together.

1246
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,176
- No, me neither.

1247
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,277
If I had to draw lines...

1248
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:16,645
- No, never.
Yeah, man.

1249
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:19,482
- Everybody knows.
The whole brewery knows.

1250
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,183
- I'm not getting into this
with you guys.

1251
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,518
- Hey, come on, man.

1252
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,553
Everybody--
Ryan told everybody.

1253
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:27,023
Ryan saw you.

1254
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:28,224
- So what?

1255
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:29,992
Yeah, I'm not getting into it.

1256
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:31,660
- Come on.

1257
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,036
- Hi.

1258
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:42,304
I can't do
any more phone calls.

1259
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:45,041
- Oh, yeah?
- They see through me.

1260
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:46,042
They see through this.

1261
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,443
- You should drink some coffee.

1262
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:49,145
- I had so much coffee,
but let's get food.

1263
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:50,479
I need some--
do you want to get some?

1264
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,048
- Can't.
I'm slammed actually, Kate.

1265
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,215
- You're not having lunch?

1266
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,493
- Yo!

1267
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:07,430
We have enough clean kegs for
the stuff in the bright tank?

1268
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,267
Luke.

1269
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:12,668
What's up?

1270
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,437
What's up with the bright tank?
Are we good?

1271
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,072
- I'm working, Dave.

1272
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:17,506
- I'm asking you
a work question.

1273
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:19,308
- What did you ask me, man?

1274
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,577
- I asked you if we have enough
clean kegs for the bright tank.

1275
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,045
- I'm not in the fucking mood,
man.

1276
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:25,147
Everything's off.

1277
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:39,161
- Yeah.

1278
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:40,429
You got to--
you got to revisit it.

1279
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,265
It's amazing.

1280
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,368
- And the next development
is a canning line,

1281
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,137
which is great,

1282
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:50,039
'cause as of now,
we can't sell the beer in cans.

1283
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,340
Will you excuse me one second,
Eli?

1284
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:52,641
- Absolutely.

1285
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:55,411
- I'm gonna be right--
right back.

1286
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:58,147
Yo.
- Yo.

1287
00:51:58,149 --> 00:51:59,148
- Where you going?

1288
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,649
- Going home, man.

1289
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,451
- Why don't you stay
and have one beer with me?

1290
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,286
- 'Cause I'm having a shit day,
and I'm ready--

1291
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:05,554
- What are you doing?
- Going home.

1292
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:06,555
- You owe me a beer.

1293
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:07,790
- I owe you a beer?

1294
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,825
- Yeah, we have to sit
and have a beer.

1295
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:12,394
- Hey, guys. Drinks?

1296
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:13,395
- Oh, we have plans.

1297
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:14,563
- Oh, we do?

1298
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:15,698
- All right.
- Have fun, guys.

1299
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,166
- You want to all get together,

1300
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:18,467
tip a few back
and see what happens?

1301
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,236
- Shut up. Dave.

1302
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:22,505
Please?

1303
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:24,106
One fucking beer.

1304
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:25,307
- All right.

1305
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,408
- Thank you.

1306
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,377
I'm gonna go finish up with Eli.

1307
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:29,378
I'll be right back.

1308
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,479
- Great. Close the deal.

1309
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,647
- I'll meet you over there.

1310
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,215
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

1311
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:35,451
- You're welcome.

1312
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,423
- I was full of shit yesterday.

1313
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:43,559
I don't know.

1314
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:44,860
Ugh, whatever.

1315
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:46,862
- Hey, here's the truth:

1316
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:49,098
I'm done giving you shit,
and I'm sorry.

1317
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,099
I have no place.

1318
00:52:50,101 --> 00:52:51,834
You are a grown woman,

1319
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:55,437
and if you want to have sex
with a disgusting, bad brewer

1320
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:58,841
with a terrible attitude...

1321
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:03,712
- I don't love Dave.

1322
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:05,247
- You smell good.

1323
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:06,248
- Really?

1324
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,583
- Yeah.

1325
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:10,686
Surprised you got all of Dave
off of ya.

1326
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,522
- Maybe you're smelling Dave.

1327
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:31,540
- Mine would be a futon,
and then all--you know...

1328
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,409
- It's just very--it's cool.

1329
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:35,444
It's, like, cozy,
but it's still all put together.

1330
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:36,612
Jill, this place is so great.

1331
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:38,514
- Oh, thank you so much.

1332
00:53:38,516 --> 00:53:39,882
- Yeah, she was
just complimenting it

1333
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:41,750
and how great your style is
and all of that.

1334
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:42,751
- Oh, my style?

1335
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:43,752
- Yeah, you got style.

1336
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:45,621
- You got style, woman.

1337
00:53:45,623 --> 00:53:48,224
- I've got a veggie lasagna,
but it's not done yet,

1338
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:51,427
so I thought I would feed us
something for now.

1339
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,494
- Thank you. Wow.

1340
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:53,495
- You are the best.

1341
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:54,697
- This is great.

1342
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,332
- Hey, cheers, everybody.
- Yes.

1343
00:53:56,334 --> 00:53:58,701
- To being in our house
and hanging out with us

1344
00:53:58,703 --> 00:53:59,735
and for making a great meal.

1345
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,170
- To our new kid.

1346
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:03,939
- Aw.
- Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Dad.

1347
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:05,241
Aw.
- Couldn't resist.

1348
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:06,675
- I got her when she young.

1349
00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:08,677
She was 21.
She didn't know any better.

1350
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,546
She hadn't seen the world yet.
I could really--

1351
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:12,348
- I have a feeling she knew
what she was doing.

1352
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,616
- I could really do
my C-plus material,

1353
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:14,817
and she was like, "Wow."

1354
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,854
- I could be half drunk
and still make it work.

1355
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,856
- And then to evolve.
I mean, 21's so young.

1356
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:22,691
And then you get older,
and so much happens.

1357
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:24,760
You change in those years
drastically.

1358
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,629
- Oh, yeah.

1359
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:29,298
No, I for sure thought that I
was gonna fuck a lot more dudes.

1360
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:31,800
- All right, Jill.

1361
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:33,669
I'm right here.

1362
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:35,237
- I mean, that's the thing.

1363
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,705
- Yeah, maybe, like,
almost fuck a chick

1364
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:38,474
and then chicken out.

1365
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:40,442
- Right, just dabble.
That's what college is for.

1366
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:41,677
- But at least
I could have tried!

1367
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:42,811
- Right.

1368
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:46,382
- You still can,
the last one.

1369
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:47,883
- I think that's great.

1370
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:50,452
I mean, it's overrated.

1371
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:51,854
That whole thing
is overrated.

1372
00:54:51,856 --> 00:54:56,725
It ends in pain
and lots of walking in shame.

1373
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:58,961
- No, I feel lucky
I got a good one.

1374
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:01,797
I didn't have to wade through
too many...

1375
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:02,831
- Yeah.

1376
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,366
- Bad ones.

1377
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:06,902
- Yeah.

1378
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:09,371
- Good thing.

1379
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:34,596
- Hey, baby.

1380
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:35,664
- Hey.

1381
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,736
Frank's an idiot.

1382
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:41,837
- What?

1383
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,639
- Nothing.

1384
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,378
You doing some packing?

1385
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,979
- Indeed.

1386
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,553
- <i>What Narcissism Means to Me?</i>

1387
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,558
When did you start reading
a book of poetry?

1388
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,692
- Do you know who gave me that?

1389
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,527
- No.

1390
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:08,330
- Uh, Chris.

1391
00:56:08,332 --> 00:56:09,898
Chris of Kate and Chris.

1392
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,600
- Why did Chris
give you a book called

1393
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:13,936
<i>What Narcissism Means to Me?</i>

1394
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:15,371
- Uh, I don't know.

1395
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,973
The title,
I can't actually say...

1396
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:21,410
Um, I don't want this.

1397
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:25,347
But he just came by
the farmer's market,

1398
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:28,951
and, like, gave me a...

1399
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:32,354
- He went
to the farmer's market?

1400
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:34,390
- Yeah, he came by
the farmer's market.

1401
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:37,993
He gave me, like, a...

1402
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:39,328
- What a sweet guy.

1403
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:40,529
- Yeah. Yeah.

1404
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:42,431
He seemed, like--
he seemed okay.

1405
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:44,933
He seemed, like...

1406
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:47,770
happy and healthy
and fine and...

1407
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,986
Just, uh...

1408
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:10,793
A reminder or a-a query.

1409
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:11,794
Um...

1410
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:13,028
- A query?

1411
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,665
- Have you been thinking
at all about

1412
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:19,067
the old marriage convo,

1413
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:20,068
the worst convo...

1414
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,103
- Yeah.

1415
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:24,139
- In the history of the world?

1416
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:25,140
- Absolutely.

1417
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:26,141
- Yeah?

1418
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:27,676
- Yes. I have.

1419
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,578
- What have--what have you been
thinking about?

1420
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,746
- All good stuff.

1421
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:32,581
- Yeah?

1422
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,516
Um...

1423
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,153
Yeah,
just maybe while I'm gone,

1424
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:41,557
like, if you have thoughts on

1425
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,425
just general timing and--

1426
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:45,828
- Okay.

1427
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,396
You got it.

1428
00:57:47,398 --> 00:57:48,464
- That would be great.

1429
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:49,765
- I'll give it a lot of thought.

1430
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,500
- That would make me feel
really good.

1431
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:52,734
- Oh, good.
- Okay.

1432
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:53,802
- You think about it too.

1433
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,171
- I'm gonna.

1434
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:57,739
- Good.

1435
00:57:57,741 --> 00:57:59,608
- Don't try to turn it around
on me.

1436
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:00,809
You know I'm gonna.

1437
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,511
- Okay.

1438
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,569
- Mm.

1439
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,912
What'd you do tonight?

1440
00:58:36,914 --> 00:58:40,048
- Um,
I had some work to do,

1441
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,750
and I did some reading.

1442
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,153
Here you go.

1443
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:49,625
- Thank you.

1444
00:58:49,627 --> 00:58:51,827
- So what's up?

1445
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:53,762
- I don't know.
I was just out.

1446
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:55,130
- Uh-huh.

1447
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:57,232
- It's so hot out.

1448
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:59,234
Just, like, sweating my...

1449
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:00,235
- Yeah.

1450
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:02,838
- Sweating my balls off.

1451
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,706
- Yeah. What's up?

1452
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:05,774
- Sit down.

1453
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:06,909
- No, I'm gonna stand.

1454
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:08,810
- Ugh, sit down.

1455
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:09,878
- I'm gonna stand here.

1456
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,879
Tell me what's up.

1457
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,014
Why'd you come over?

1458
00:59:12,016 --> 00:59:13,715
- 'Cause I miss you.

1459
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,050
- Okay.

1460
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:18,654
Um, here's the thing.

1461
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:19,788
- Yes?

1462
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,657
- All right?

1463
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:22,958
- Can you please--
it's hard--

1464
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,826
it's not nice
to be on another level.

1465
00:59:24,828 --> 00:59:26,962
You have to sit, because I can't
hear you all the way up--

1466
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:27,963
hello?

1467
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:29,531
- Here's the thing.

1468
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:30,966
I can't hear you up there.

1469
00:59:30,968 --> 00:59:31,967
- Okay. Kate?

1470
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:33,735
- Yes.

1471
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,605
- I was serious about
what I said the other day.

1472
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:39,041
- I know, and I heard you.

1473
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:42,077
- Yeah, well, what I said was,

1474
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,047
I don't think
that this is working.

1475
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:46,048
- I think...

1476
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,616
- Okay?

1477
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:48,951
And I don't think
this is gonna work.

1478
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:50,285
- I think you're wrong.

1479
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:51,954
- And I think eight months
is enough time

1480
00:59:51,956 --> 00:59:54,222
to know
whether something's gonna work.

1481
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:56,725
- You know...

1482
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:57,960
- All right?

1483
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,571
- What the fuck?

1484
01:00:09,573 --> 01:00:11,974
God damn it!

1485
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:14,910
You stupid fucker!

1486
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:17,746
Why didn't you take that one?

1487
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:19,615
Oh, my God!

1488
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,358
Fucking...

1489
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:38,033
No, I'm--I'm really excited
to see the space,

1490
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:41,169
and I've heard your food
is awesome.

1491
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:42,237
Okay, great.

1492
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,338
I'll see you guys Wednesday.

1493
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,906
Thank you.

1494
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,780
That's what I do.

1495
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:52,948
- Impressive.

1496
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:55,617
Hey, is your lady in Mexico?

1497
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:56,652
- Costa Rica.
- Costa Rica?

1498
01:00:56,654 --> 01:00:58,020
- Different.

1499
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:00,122
Is she--uh, same-same,
sort of interchangeable.

1500
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:01,623
- You want to get dinner
with me?

1501
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,225
- Dinner? Tonight?

1502
01:01:03,227 --> 01:01:05,093
Yes.
- No, in a week and a half.

1503
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:06,762
- Tonight, yes.
- You do?

1504
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:07,763
- Yeah.
Definitely.

1505
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:09,131
I'm starving.

1506
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:10,866
I just have to make
one more phone call.

1507
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,167
Do you--
do you want to watch?

1508
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,235
- Yes.

1509
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:14,336
- All right.

1510
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,704
Weirdo.

1511
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:23,745
- Sorry.

1512
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:24,846
Did you already pay?

1513
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:25,847
- I did.
Yeah, we're good.

1514
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:26,848
- How much do I owe you?

1515
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,083
- You owe me nothing, Kate.

1516
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:29,084
- Oh, come on.

1517
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:30,085
- You owe me nothing.

1518
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:31,319
- What a gentleman.

1519
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:32,854
Thanks, hubby.
- Oh, I like you a lot.

1520
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,123
- So sweet. So nice.

1521
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,925
- Are you ready?

1522
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:39,161
- Mm-hmm.

1523
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:40,328
- Here you go, my friend.

1524
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,329
- Mm.

1525
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:42,397
- Let me give you that.

1526
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:43,765
- Thank you.
- Give me this.

1527
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:45,100
- Thanks.

1528
01:01:45,102 --> 01:01:46,968
- Give me the pretzels.

1529
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,070
You got a hold of 'em?

1530
01:01:48,072 --> 01:01:49,671
- Okay.

1531
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,039
- Okay.

1532
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,008
This is you.

1533
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,042
- Oh, thanks.

1534
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,077
- Here you go, ma'am.

1535
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:56,778
Hey.

1536
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,813
Cheers to ya.

1537
01:01:57,815 --> 01:01:58,914
- Cheers. Thanks for dinner.

1538
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,916
- Yeah.
Thanks for coming over.

1539
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,087
- Yum, yum, yum.

1540
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,156
Mm.
- You want 'em?

1541
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:09,391
- Mm-hmm.

1542
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:13,361
It's so nice here.

1543
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:15,063
- So when we open up our bar...

1544
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,899
Yeah.

1545
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,101
- Brewing in the back.

1546
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:20,268
- Oh, yeah.

1547
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:23,905
- Cuba, Miami...

1548
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,373
New Orleans.

1549
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,677
- I still vote Cuba.
I think we could do it.

1550
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:30,011
- You do?

1551
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:31,713
- We just have to sneak in
through Mexico.

1552
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:33,248
- What do you think
the aesthetic is again?

1553
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,983
- The aesthetic is...

1554
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:37,052
- Walk me through it. You walk
in 'cause I like--

1555
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:38,787
-  <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>
<i>meets</i> <i>Casablanca.</i>

1556
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:40,722
How many times
do I have to tell you that?

1557
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:42,691
- 'Cause all I think about

1558
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:45,260
is fuckin' guys getting their
ears cut off in the back...

1559
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,928
- Word.
- And dudes--no.

1560
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:47,929
- What a nice apartment.

1561
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,331
I want a Jill.

1562
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,832
- Yeah, I'm glad I got her.

1563
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:52,434
- Can you find me one, please?

1564
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:56,304
Does she have a male clone?

1565
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:58,206
- She's got a brother,
but he's weird as fuck.

1566
01:02:58,208 --> 01:02:59,307
- I'll take it.

1567
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:30,105
- Right?

1568
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:31,506
Do you like it?

1569
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:32,507
- It's good.

1570
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:34,242
It's groovy.

1571
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:36,745
- That's how I'm described a lot
by my peers.

1572
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:38,046
- "He's a groovy fella."

1573
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:40,515
- Good and groovy.

1574
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,086
- That's a very important
pressure point.

1575
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:46,254
- What's this spot?

1576
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:47,455
- That's your heart.

1577
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:49,424
- Oh, wow.

1578
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,131
- Oh, Lord,
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1579
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:57,232
- Okay.

1580
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:00,268
All right, come here.

1581
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,269
I'm gonna give you
a massage.

1582
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:02,871
- Oh.

1583
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:04,906
- Be very careful
that you don't get hurt.

1584
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:09,110
Okay, ready?

1585
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:10,312
- I've never been more ready.

1586
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:12,080
Honestly, I've never been.

1587
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:13,381
Ohh!

1588
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,551
- Again with the fucking sounds!

1589
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:18,153
- I'm vocal about--

1590
01:04:18,155 --> 01:04:19,354
- You have to be more quiet.

1591
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,223
- I'm sorry, it's...

1592
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,393
- Oh.

1593
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,295
I have to pee so bad.

1594
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,233
Do you have food here?

1595
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,002
- No.

1596
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:17,545
- I'm not going far.

1597
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:19,314
I just need a smaller place,

1598
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:21,583
'cause my place
is meant for two,

1599
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:24,519
and I am meant for one.

1600
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:27,956
So I am moving
to a little place.

1601
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:29,024
It's good.

1602
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:30,025
It's got just enough room

1603
01:05:30,027 --> 01:05:33,194
for me and my imaginary cat.

1604
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:37,632
- Yeah,
if you want help moving,

1605
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:39,167
I'd be happy to do it.

1606
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:40,936
Especially if you got to be out
by tomorrow.

1607
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:42,137
- You don't want
to help me move.

1608
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:43,238
- No, I'm willing to help you.

1609
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,272
You're you. I'll do it.

1610
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,307
- It's an awful job.

1611
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:47,008
Moving is what happens in hell.

1612
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:51,880
Um...

1613
01:05:51,882 --> 01:05:53,548
- When was the party?

1614
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,549
- You were there.

1615
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:56,251
It was for my birthday.

1616
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:58,553
- This is from
your birthday party, Kate?

1617
01:05:58,555 --> 01:05:59,654
- Yeah.

1618
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:01,489
- Are you kidding me, man?

1619
01:06:01,491 --> 01:06:03,024
- Well, I knew I was moving,

1620
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:06,461
so I didn't bother, you know...

1621
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,997
Anyway,
I feel like we should start--

1622
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:11,299
- First of all, I think
we should clean everything.

1623
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,467
- Oh, I don't know
if there's--

1624
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:13,601
it's gonna get dirty
anyway.

1625
01:06:13,603 --> 01:06:15,203
- The cake is still here!

1626
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:16,538
- I know. I ate it all.

1627
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:21,076
It was, like,
the best breakfast food.

1628
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:22,677
Here, I got bags.

1629
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:25,547
- All right, great.

1630
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,494
Kitchen's done.
- Oh, my God.

1631
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,162
- Living room's done.
- What?

1632
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,263
- Dining room's done.

1633
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:43,498
- Oh, my God!

1634
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,966
- Yeah, we are groovin'.

1635
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:46,534
- That's such good news.

1636
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:48,303
- This is a little chaotic.
- Ooh, I'm so hot.

1637
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:49,504
- Just throwing it in
like that?

1638
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:51,272
- Yeah.

1639
01:06:51,274 --> 01:06:53,108
Yeah, 'cause I'm just gonna
take it right out.

1640
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,309
- Smart.
How about the towels?

1641
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:55,643
You want to just throw those
on top?

1642
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:56,644
- Oh, yeah.

1643
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:57,712
- For protection.

1644
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:02,117
I like your style, friend.

1645
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,487
- Thanks.

1646
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:06,688
Can I have a sip?

1647
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,590
- Yes, ma'am.

1648
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:17,332
Mm.

1649
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:18,400
- Mm-hmm.

1650
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:37,552
- I'm pretty impressed with us.

1651
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,688
This is so much better
than it would have been

1652
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:41,756
on my own.

1653
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,429
Do you want some water?

1654
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:54,502
Oh, it's weird
to see the bottom of my sink.

1655
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:03,311
How's it coming in there?

1656
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,268
- Your breakfast is served,
lady.

1657
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,337
Good morning.

1658
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:10,405
- Really?

1659
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:11,739
- Yes, really.

1660
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:13,308
- Wow.

1661
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:15,643
- How'd you sleep?

1662
01:10:15,645 --> 01:10:17,879
- Good.

1663
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:19,514
- So here's what I think
for today.

1664
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:21,282
Tell me what you think.

1665
01:10:21,284 --> 01:10:22,884
I'm gonna take off.
I'm gonna get the U-Haul.

1666
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:24,452
I already called it in.

1667
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:26,187
If you want to finish
doing this kitchen,

1668
01:10:26,189 --> 01:10:27,188
I'll get the U-haul.

1669
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:28,189
We'll get everything.

1670
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,490
When we're done--

1671
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:31,459
which I think we can be done
by 2:00--

1672
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:33,561
we shower, we dress up,

1673
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,363
and we go
to a nice dinner on me.

1674
01:10:35,365 --> 01:10:36,764
- Really?

1675
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:38,433
- Do the whole thing.
Feel good about it.

1676
01:10:38,435 --> 01:10:40,235
Celebrate these couple of days.

1677
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:42,670
Celebrate the move.
Get a nice bite to eat.

1678
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:43,671
- Okay.

1679
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:44,672
- Deal?
- Deal.

1680
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:46,541
- Sealed.

1681
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:48,443
Okay.

1682
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:16,971
You good?
- Yep.

1683
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:18,473
All right, let's do it.

1684
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:20,475
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1685
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:21,976
- Ah, fucking Christ!

1686
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,678
Fuck!

1687
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,847
- What happened?

1688
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:27,749
Did you drop it?

1689
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:30,251
- There's a nail
in the fucking couch.

1690
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:31,252
- Oh.

1691
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:32,520
- Ah, f...

1692
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:34,222
- Are you bleeding?

1693
01:11:34,224 --> 01:11:36,658
Did it get on the upholstery?

1694
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,959
I don't even know
how to clean this.

1695
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:40,662
- Ah, fucking A.

1696
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:42,330
- Let's--let's just get it out
the door.

1697
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:43,598
- All right, just stop, Kate.

1698
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,433
Wait.
Give me one fucking second.

1699
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:49,304
Ahh...

1700
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:50,538
Ah.

1701
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:51,806
Fucking cr...

1702
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,274
Ah-ha-ha.

1703
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:54,842
- I just left the couch
sitting on the--

1704
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:56,744
ah, fuck!

1705
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:58,813
- Yeah, I think
I'm gonna need stitches.

1706
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,581
- Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

1707
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:02,283
- Yeah, you got any peroxide
or anything?

1708
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:03,985
- Oh, my God,
I'm not good with--

1709
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,887
- Kate, get me some peroxide,
please.

1710
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:07,388
I'm sorry
you're not good with it.

1711
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,856
I'm fucking bleeding.

1712
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:11,025
Just get me a fucking
paper towel, please, then.

1713
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:12,360
- I have--I don't know--

1714
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:13,428
- Just do something!

1715
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:14,662
- Fuck!

1716
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,531
Okay, I found them.

1717
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:17,532
- Okay, great.

1718
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:18,533
- Oh, my God.

1719
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:19,534
- Okay, here.

1720
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:21,402
- Oh, my God.

1721
01:12:21,404 --> 01:12:22,437
That's--

1722
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:23,438
- Ahh.

1723
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,539
- That's really bad.

1724
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:25,873
It's really, really, really bad.

1725
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:27,742
- Yeah, it's okay.
It's okay.

1726
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:30,745
- Should I call--you know,
should I call an ambulance?

1727
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:31,913
- Ahh.

1728
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:35,483
Ah.

1729
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:36,751
Ah, ha-ha.

1730
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:37,752
Ha-ha-ha.

1731
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:40,321
Ah, f...

1732
01:12:40,323 --> 01:12:43,558
Ah, fucking piece of shit.

1733
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:49,630
- Hey, is this you?

1734
01:12:49,632 --> 01:12:50,732
- Yeah, that's me.

1735
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:52,500
- Move your fucking van,
buddy!

1736
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:53,935
- Wait, we just have to get
the couch in.

1737
01:12:53,937 --> 01:12:55,703
- Hey, pal.

1738
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,772
I don't care what
your fucking girlfriend says!

1739
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:59,407
Move the van, pal!
- Are you kidding?

1740
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:00,541
- Hang on one second.

1741
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:01,876
- Shut up, lady!

1742
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,544
It's fucking hot out here.

1743
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,346
I've been out here
for five fucking minutes!

1744
01:13:05,348 --> 01:13:06,881
- Fuck you.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1745
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,383
- I've tried being fucking cool!

1746
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:09,917
- Give me the fucking keys then,
shithead!

1747
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:10,918
- Luke! Luke! Luke!

1748
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,353
- Move the fucking van, asshole!

1749
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:13,621
- Jesus Christ!
I'll move the van.

1750
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:15,890
I will move it.

1751
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,492
- He's really--he's lucky.

1752
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:18,893
- You're lucky.

1753
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,595
You're lucky
that no one called the cops.

1754
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:22,463
You're lucky
he didn't press charges.

1755
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:24,565
- He's lucky I didn't continue
to kick his fucking ass.

1756
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:25,566
- Oh, my God.

1757
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:26,901
What is the point of that?

1758
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,636
That's so stupid.
This is so stupid.

1759
01:13:28,638 --> 01:13:30,605
Can I just call--
I'm just gonna call some people,

1760
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:32,807
and have them come and help me
move out of my fucking place.

1761
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:34,976
- Kate, give me one--give me one
fucking second, please.

1762
01:13:34,978 --> 01:13:36,677
- I made room!

1763
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:38,679
- This futuristic device,
I wasn't familiar with.

1764
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:40,548
- Please be careful with it.
It's my love life.

1765
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:42,750
- Is it? It's all you got?
- Do you think it needs a box?

1766
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,452
- No, I think--
I think it's fine.

1767
01:13:44,454 --> 01:13:45,987
I think if you have any luck,
it'll break.

1768
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:48,556
- Oh.

1769
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:50,525
Oh, wow.

1770
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:52,126
So manly. So strapping.

1771
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:53,961
- Yeah, I got everything.

1772
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,135
- Tell me more
about this beer you have.

1773
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:05,106
- Oh, ow, ow, ow.

1774
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:08,443
Ow, ow.

1775
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:12,447
Ow, ow, ow.

1776
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:27,061
Oh, fucking Christ.

1777
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,242
- How's your hand?

1778
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:48,683
- There used to be a cool
magic store around here.

1779
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,821
- Careful with my pussy.

1780
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,958
- How long have you been waiting
to say that?

1781
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,860
The whole U-haul ride,
you've been thinking...

1782
01:14:58,862 --> 01:15:00,194
- All day.

1783
01:15:00,196 --> 01:15:01,829
- "Oh, when he gets
to take that out"...

1784
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,197
Dude.

1785
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,212
Okay.

1786
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:19,981
I know I sound
like a broken record,

1787
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:22,016
but just to be honest,

1788
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,619
this place--it rules.

1789
01:15:24,621 --> 01:15:25,686
- Right?
- It's awesome.

1790
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:26,921
- I think it's awesome too.

1791
01:15:26,923 --> 01:15:28,456
- I think it smells like cats
in here.

1792
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:30,057
- It doesn't smell like cats.

1793
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:32,026
- I think it--I think it
honestly smells like a zoo.

1794
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,027
- No.
- I love wood paneling.

1795
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,495
- Wood paneling is amazing.

1796
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:36,864
You don't see that.
- "I love wood."

1797
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,766
- Honestly, Kate,
this place smells like rhinos.

1798
01:15:38,768 --> 01:15:39,834
- No.

1799
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,679
- It's great, like I said.
The wood paneling.

1800
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:53,247
- If you help me do the taps,
I'll do the taps.

1801
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:54,715
- Yeah, I'll help.

1802
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,083
- We just need stools
and the sign.

1803
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:57,218
- Yeah, we can pull
some stuff from work.

1804
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,986
Just let me know.

1805
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:00,621
- Is that everything?
- That's everything, yeah.

1806
01:16:00,623 --> 01:16:02,089
- Oh, my God, you're a hero.

1807
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:03,491
- Thank you guys so much.
- You're welcome.

1808
01:16:03,493 --> 01:16:04,792
- I really appreciate it.

1809
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:06,127
- We're gonna go out,
as per the uge,

1810
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:07,762
get some drinks,
so if you want to come,

1811
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:09,030
just shoot me a text
or something.

1812
01:16:09,032 --> 01:16:10,565
- Cool.
Yeah, sounds fun. Thank you.

1813
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:11,799
- All right,
enjoy the new place.

1814
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:12,800
- All right, bye.

1815
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:14,302
- Bye.

1816
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:28,649
- Is it okay?

1817
01:16:28,651 --> 01:16:30,284
- Yeah, it just hurts.

1818
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:34,956
- I might have--

1819
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:36,757
in one of the boxes,
there's, like, Tylenol.

1820
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:37,992
I don't know where it is,
though.

1821
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:39,727
- It's all right.
Thanks, man.

1822
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:46,534
- Mm.

1823
01:16:46,536 --> 01:16:48,069
- Well, we did it.

1824
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:49,637
- Yeah, thank you.

1825
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:51,138
- Thank you.

1826
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,710
Oh, sorry, my elbow
was pushing against your rib.

1827
01:16:55,712 --> 01:16:57,111
- Ugh.

1828
01:16:57,113 --> 01:17:01,148
- I seriously want to say
that I apologize.

1829
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,617
- For what?

1830
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:03,884
- For my elbow
going into your rib.

1831
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:07,154
- Oh. Ow!

1832
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:08,155
Don't.

1833
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:11,058
- So should we shower up?

1834
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,793
- You want to take a shower?

1835
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,562
- Yeah.

1836
01:17:14,564 --> 01:17:16,697
Take you out to that nice meal
I promised you.

1837
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:18,299
- Why don't we just go have beer
with the guys?

1838
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:19,300
- No. Pass.

1839
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:20,968
- Why not?

1840
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:23,170
- Because
I don't want to fucking see--

1841
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:26,140
I barely like Frank and Mike.

1842
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,643
I don't like Dave.

1843
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:30,077
We're gonna see them
tomorrow anyway.

1844
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:31,679
- I kind of feel like

1845
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:33,247
I'm gonna have a drink
with them, though.

1846
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:37,151
You should come, though.

1847
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,186
You should totally come.

1848
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:41,656
Have fun.

1849
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:43,658
- No, you should come.

1850
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:44,992
We'll, like, play pool.

1851
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:46,360
- Oh, right on, sweet.
- I feel like it.

1852
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:48,162
- That sounds really cool, man.
- Great.

1853
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:50,164
- Play some pool with the guys,
and then just see what happens.

1854
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,699
Play some--

1855
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:53,067
- Don't do that.
Don't be shitty, please.

1856
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:54,068
- We'll just goof around
with the guys.

1857
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,703
- Don't do that.

1858
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:57,038
- And we'll pretend like
there was nothing weird

1859
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,039
about just going
out with the guys.

1860
01:17:58,041 --> 01:17:59,707
- Why is there something weird?

1861
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:01,208
- Because we had plans.
That's what humans do.

1862
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,877
We make plans,
then we follow through.

1863
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:04,679
But if you want to go out
with the guys, then--

1864
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:05,980
- Stop. Stop it.

1865
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:07,815
- Then do
whatever the fuck you want.

1866
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:09,650
- Stop, you're not allowed
to make me feel bad about this.

1867
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:10,918
- I'm kind of allowed
to do whatever I want.

1868
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:11,952
- No, you're really not.

1869
01:18:11,954 --> 01:18:13,154
You're really not allowed

1870
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:14,689
to make me feel bad
about something.

1871
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,323
I haven't done anything wrong,
Luke.

1872
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:17,358
You realize that, right?

1873
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,393
I haven't betrayed you.

1874
01:18:19,395 --> 01:18:21,929
There's nothing that you can say
that I've done that's wrong.

1875
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:24,031
I am a single human being
hanging out with my friends.

1876
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:25,766
- I agree.

1877
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:27,668
- Okay, you may have
some other shit to deal with.

1878
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:28,736
- Don't--don't--

1879
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:30,404
- That has nothing to do
with me.

1880
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:32,139
- I don't want to have one
of these big things with you.

1881
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:33,908
- I'm just saying.

1882
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,876
- I know you like the--
- I'm not having a big thing.

1883
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,411
Don't--just--
you don't have to touch me.

1884
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:39,914
I think maybe
you should just go.

1885
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:42,917
- Oh, would you please
get a hold of this moment?

1886
01:18:42,919 --> 01:18:44,652
Would you please
get a hold of this moment?

1887
01:18:44,654 --> 01:18:46,287
- No, I refuse
to be made to feel bad.

1888
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:47,755
I don't have to be made
to feel bad.

1889
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:49,724
- Good for you.
- Stop it!

1890
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:52,259
Stop doing
the fucking face and voice!

1891
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:54,161
That's not what I sound like,
okay?

1892
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:56,764
I am not a bad person, okay?

1893
01:18:56,766 --> 01:18:58,432
You're my friend.
- I agree.

1894
01:18:58,434 --> 01:19:01,001
- And you're not allowed to make
me feel like a fucking slut

1895
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:02,670
for fucking who I want,

1896
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:04,672
because I'm allowed to,
because I am single.

1897
01:19:04,674 --> 01:19:07,408
You are not.

1898
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:08,442
- Don't do that.

1899
01:19:08,444 --> 01:19:09,877
- What?

1900
01:19:09,879 --> 01:19:11,045
I'm just
telling the truth, so...

1901
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:15,783
- Don't do that.

1902
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:17,351
- You made your own bed,
all right?

1903
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:18,853
- And you fucking slept in it.

1904
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:22,523
- Well, you didn't stop me.

1905
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:25,092
- All right, Kate.

1906
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:26,193
- All right.

1907
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:30,064
- Sorry it ended so bad tonight.

1908
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:32,199
It wasn't my intent.
- Have fun.

1909
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:34,068
Go home...

1910
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,236
to your girlfriend.

1911
01:20:32,094 --> 01:20:33,460
- Hello?

1912
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:34,461
- Jill?

1913
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:35,830
- Hey.

1914
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:37,264
- Hey,
what are you doing home?

1915
01:20:37,266 --> 01:20:38,265
- Hey. Sorry.

1916
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:39,533
- You okay?

1917
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:41,101
- Yeah.
No, I didn't mean to scare you.

1918
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:42,469
Hey. Hey.

1919
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:44,505
- Hey, what
are you doing home early?

1920
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,307
- Oh, it just sucked.
- Is everything okay?

1921
01:20:46,309 --> 01:20:47,508
- Yeah.
No, everything's okay.

1922
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,177
- What's going on?

1923
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:52,246
- What happened to your face?
What...

1924
01:20:52,248 --> 01:20:53,280
Jesus, baby.

1925
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:54,415
- Careful, careful, careful.

1926
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:56,183
- Um...

1927
01:20:58,386 --> 01:20:59,420
Come here.

1928
01:20:59,422 --> 01:21:00,788
- Hey.

1929
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:02,389
What are you doing home,
Jill?

1930
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:03,390
Are you okay?

1931
01:21:03,392 --> 01:21:04,458
- Yeah, just--

1932
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,860
- How come you're crying?

1933
01:21:05,862 --> 01:21:07,294
- The trip was just shitty.
Just...

1934
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:08,495
- It was?

1935
01:21:08,497 --> 01:21:10,064
- Needed to come home,
you know?

1936
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:11,899
- Did anything happen,
or was it just bad?

1937
01:21:11,901 --> 01:21:13,167
- It just...

1938
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:15,536
- It just sucked.
- It just sucked.

1939
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:18,205
- Were there, like, fights,
or did something...

1940
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,377
Careful.
Like, I ripped it with a nail.

1941
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:25,012
- Okay.

1942
01:21:25,014 --> 01:21:27,114
Oh, Jesus.

1943
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:32,119
- You okay, Jill?

1944
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:33,587
- Yeah.

1945
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:35,522
When we were in Michigan,
something happened.

1946
01:21:35,524 --> 01:21:40,127
And I needed to come home
and tell you, um...

1947
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:47,401
I went on that hike
with Chris,

1948
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,404
and, uh, we ended up kissing.

1949
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:53,274
And, um...

1950
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:59,480
And I just needed to come
home and tell you that--

1951
01:21:59,482 --> 01:22:01,215
I needed to tell you that

1952
01:22:01,217 --> 01:22:04,518
and that I'm really sorry,
and I really fucked up.

1953
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,519
I want to be with you.

1954
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:08,222
I want to--

1955
01:22:08,224 --> 01:22:10,424
I just couldn't not tell you.

1956
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:18,866
I-I didn't want to tell you,

1957
01:22:18,868 --> 01:22:20,100
but it just felt worse
and worse,

1958
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,602
and I had to just--

1959
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:24,571
I just had to come home
and tell you.

1960
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:33,681
- Is that it?

1961
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:41,555
- I don't know.

1962
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:44,124
I--yeah?

1963
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,062
- Are you in love with him
at all?

1964
01:22:48,064 --> 01:22:49,296
- No, no.

1965
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:51,198
No, not at all.
Not at all.

1966
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:55,569
It was just, like,
a really pathetic,

1967
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:59,006
gross thing to do.

1968
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:02,376
And...

1969
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:04,545
- You're okay, Jill.

1970
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:55,396
- So I say
we strike while the iron's hot.

1971
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:57,998
You know, maybe even as early
as next week, hopefully?

1972
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,234
We go out there
to Three Floyds,

1973
01:24:00,236 --> 01:24:01,702
and maybe, you know,
leave early,

1974
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:03,470
like around 3:00,
next Thursday or Friday,

1975
01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:05,139
whatever you think works--

1976
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:07,241
whatever works for,
you know, a lot of the guys.

1977
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:15,749
- Hey.
