1
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,800
Yellow black, yellow black ...

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Black and yellow, let us agree otherwise.

3
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,100
Barry, 't breakfast is ready. - I come out.

4
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,700
Stay even hang.

5
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,600
Hello? - Barry. - Breathe. - Can you believe this happened?

6
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I can 't even believe it. I come get you.

7
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,300
'T Do we cut off.

8
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,000
Barry, why do you use the stairs not, your father has a lot of money paid for.

9
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,400
Sorry, I am very excited.

10
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,600
That is the challenge, we are very proud of you. With a perfect cijferkaart. All B's.

11
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,100
We are very proud. - Ma, I just had them everywhere we go.

12
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,000
You have something. - That I am, yes.

13
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,700
Zwaai to us, we sit in a row 118,000. - Doeg.

14
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,300
Barry I said, "not in the house fly."

15
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,800
Hey Adam. - Hey Barry, is that Fush gel?

16
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,100
Only slightly. It is a special day, I finally studying.

17
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,600
I had never thought 't Goal.

18
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,400
Indeed. Three days and three days for primary school education.

19
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,600
Yes, what strange. - Three days at university ...

20
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,800
But when I have a free day, and I was liftend by the Hills.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,500
You are otherwise come back.

22
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,000
He Barry. - Hey Artie, you have a mustache? If your well.

23
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,200
Do you have 't heard of Frankie? Going to his funeral?

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,100
No, I do not go to his funeral.

25
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,500
Everyone knows that if you someone crosses that will kill you. That you are wasting not a squirrel.

26
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,900
He was so one heethoofd. - Yes, he had also just flying along.

27
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,600
What fun that they amusement park in our daily life have brought.

28
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,900
That is why we do not need holidays, they say.

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
If a large turnout.

30
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
In those circumstances.

31
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,300
Well Adam, as of today we are men, Beemannen. - Amen.

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,700
Students, teachers, valued bees, we welcome school Buzzwell.

33
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,100
My name is welcome, the successful New Highcity classroom number 915.

34
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,700
And that was' t end of the graduation ceremony.

35
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,700
And start your career with Honex Inc..

36
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,900
Are we now our job? - I have heard that 't only orientation day.

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
Belts, there we go.

38
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,300
Keep your hands at all times and inboard angels.

39
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,400
I wonder how 't will be. Best is a little scary.

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,100
Welcome to Honex. One element of Honesco, and part of the Hexogon group.

41
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,800
This is' t.

42
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,700
We know that you like ...

43
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,000
You worked your whole life, 't point that the rest of your life can work.

44
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,700
Honing begins, as our valuable stuifmeelrijders ...

45
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,500
The nectar to the factory.

46
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Our very secret formula will be automatically ...

47
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:52,400
On color corrected, this made perfect taste sweet syrup ...

48
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,300
With his amazing golden glow, which we all know as ...

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,900
Honey!

50
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,500
Brill That looks good. - That's my niece.

51
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,800
Is that so? - Yes, we are all family apart.

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,100
Correct. You are right.

53
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,600
And Honex we strive to co-ordinate 't bees life as easy as possible.

54
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,200
These bees are testing a new helmet technology.

55
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,800
Cool. What do you think he deserved? - Not enough.

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,500
And here we have our latest technology, opvanger.

57
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,000
What does that mean?

58
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,400
He catches the drops, which hang beside it if you have given him.

59
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,100
If we save millions.

60
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,700
Can you tell more about?

61
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,700
Of course. Most bees are small jobs ...

62
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,700
But each knows that in every small job, as' t well done, very much served.

63
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,400
But choose carefully your job, because you are there your whole life to.

64
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,800
The same work for the rest of your life? That was all I knew.

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,500
What does it matter.

66
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,300
And you will be glad to hear that bees as a dierensoort,

67
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,100
They do not have a free day have been in 27 million years.

68
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
So you let us dead?

69
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,100
That we certainly try.

70
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,600
That was crazy.

71
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,400
What makes' t? How can you say that now.

72
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,800
A job forever. That is a ridiculous choice that you have to make.

73
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,100
Well, I am relieved. Now I need only one choice in my life.

74
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,100
But Adam, why do they tell us that never before?

75
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,100
Barry, but why would you want somewhere to doubt.

76
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,300
We are bees. We operate the best of all.

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,600
But Adam, do you not think that everything they need is credit?

78
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,600
Like what? Give me an example.

79
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,200
I do not know. But you know where I 't talking about.

80
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,900
Please Make the gate Friday.

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,600
Royal Nectar Force coming ... - Hey, look there again.

82
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,900
These are stuifmeelrijders.

83
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I have them have not so close.

84
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,500
They know how it's outside to the basket.

85
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Correct. But some do not return.

86
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,300
He Jock.

87
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,500
You have 't great.

88
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,700
You samples, luchtgekken. I am crazy about you.

89
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,700
Where would that have been? - Can much.

90
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
Their day is not planned. They fly out of the basket anywhere ...

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,500
And who knows what they all do.

92
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,200
You can not just decide that you 'n stuifmeelrijder of ...

93
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,900
You must be born. - Exactly.

94
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,100
Look. That is more pollen, than we will ever see in our lives.

95
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,300
It's just a status symbol. I think bees' t blow up too much.

96
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,700
Perhaps. Unless you 't have to, and the ladies that.

97
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,300
Those girls? Is it not also nieces of us?

98
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,000
Distance, distance.

99
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,700
Do you see those two. - A couple of those real Johnies.

100
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,200
Come, let us go some fun stairs.

101
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,900
It will be dangerous for a stuifmeelvlieger too.

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,500
Yes. Once a bear has a paddenstoel printed against me ...

103
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,900
He had one leg on my throat, and the other that hit me in my face.

104
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,000
My god. - I had never thought that I knock him out would save.

105
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
And what were you to 't do when this happened?

106
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
I was the authorities' t warn.

107
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,800
I can do a signing, if you want?

108
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,400
It was a little stormy outside, were you not, comrades?

109
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes. Stormy.

110
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,400
We are going tomorrow to a zonnebloemperk, five miles from here.

111
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,900
Five kilometers, eh?

112
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,600
It is a small leap for us, but perhaps you can not.

113
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,700
Maybe it is. - That you are not.

114
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,000
We depart at 09.00 pm, from gate G.

115
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,200
What do you think of it, Buzziejongen. Are you enough?

116
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,900
Maybe. It depends on what 09.00 hours.

117
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,300
Dad, you had me scared.

118
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,000
Are you already have what you want, boy?

119
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,700
Well, there are many choices. But you can only go one time.

120
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,500
Pa, it's not boring at the same work to do?

121
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,900
Son, let me tell you something about stirring.

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,400
You stick those tackles, and running him around, and you roert but otherwise ...

123
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
And if you get in a rhythm. It is a beautiful thing.

124
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,600
Are your pa, the longer I thinking about maybe the honingbranche nothing for me.

125
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,700
And what do you want to do, ballondieren?

126
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,600
That is a mistake profession for someone with a sting.

127
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,400
Well no ... - Janet, your son knows not sure if that were in the honey will.

128
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,500
Barry, sometimes you are so funny. - I try not to be funny.

129
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
You are not funny. Takes you honey.

130
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,900
Our son the stirrer. - Are you a stirrer?

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,800
Nobody listens to me. - Wait until you see the poles that I have for you.

132
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,500
Now all I can say what I want.

133
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,500
I take a tattoo ants. - Let us fresh honey, and 't celebrate.

134
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Maybe I let my navel does piercen. Scheer my antennae.

135
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,100
I still go out with a locust. Or take me a gold tooth.

136
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,500
And I go all dog. - I am so proud.

137
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,300
I can not believe that we are going to start working. - Today is the day.

138
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,400
Come on, before all the good jobs away.

139
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,300
Yes. Of course.

140
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,700
Teller, stuntbij, donor, stirring, desk, hair remover.

141
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,900
Is it still available? - Wait a minute ...

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Two more free, and one is there for you.

143
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,900
Congratulations boy. Go to the side, please.

144
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,300
What have you taken? - Her. That is insane.

145
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,700
New bees? - Yes sir. Our first day. We are ready for it.

146
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,100
Well, make your choice then.

147
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,800
Do you first? - No, but you do.

148
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,800
Jemig, what's available?

149
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,500
Toiletmedewerker is always available. But not by the reason you might think.

150
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Is there a possibility that when opvangers to come? - Of course, please.

151
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Sorry, but 't is once again full. But there is still place in the wasaapjes.

152
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,700
And there is again held at the opvangers. - What happened?

153
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,700
Well every time there is a death, there is a vacancy.

154
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,900
See you, which is death, death, a death which is fatal ...

155
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,300
Two dead, death from the neck up, and one from the neck down.

156
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
But if it's life.

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
This is so difficult.

158
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,000
Heating, cooling, stuntbij, donating, stirring, zoom, inspection number seven ...

159
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Wire coordinator, bind deputy, glass poetser, masseur thought ...

160
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,000
Barry what you think that I would ...

161
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,700
Okay, we go to 't zonnebloemperk to nine hours.

162
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,600
What happened to you? Where are you?

163
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,900
I go outside. - Outside? Where to go outside?

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,500
Since outwards. - No anyway.

165
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,400
I must do. Before me the rest of my life to work.

166
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
You will die. You are crazy.

167
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,500
Hello? I get another call. - Crazy.

168
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,500
If someone is feeling brave today ...

169
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,900
There is a Korean delicacy case on 38 streets, which were given roses today.

170
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Hey, boys.

171
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,500
Look there again. - Is not that joch yesterday?

172
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,700
Halt boy, it's here just for pilots.

173
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,700
It is already well Lou, we will take him.

174
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
Is that so? Do you think this is your lucky day?

175
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,200
Sign here ... Here ... And the security here. Thank you.

176
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,900
Okay. There is rain predicted, and as you all know bees can not fly in the rain.

177
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,300
So do cautious.

178
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,300
As always, watch out for bezems, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.

179
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,400
I also received a couple of reports that we go about our lemonade throws.

180
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,100
We get it all the kluts lose, we shake as a fool.

181
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,600
That is disgusting.

182
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,400
And then a reminder for all broekies ...

183
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,100
Love you to rule one: Absolutely not talk to the people.

184
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,100
Okay then. All in launching positions.

185
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,700
Black and yellow! - Hello!

186
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,100
Are you ready for uitslover? - Yes. Bring it on.

187
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,600
Wind. Check.

188
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,600
Antenna. Check.

189
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,700
Necterpack. Check.

190
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Vleugels. Check.

191
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,100
Angel. Check.

192
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,100
I schijt in my pants. Check.

193
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,800
Okay ladies, let us continue.

194
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,600
For Kaleknikker, you stuifmeelvreters.

195
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,600
For you all. Bring us the nectar.

196
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,000
I am outside. I can not believe that I am outside.

197
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,700
It is so blue.

198
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,800
'T Do fast, and free.

199
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,500
A kite blocks.

200
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,000
Flowers.

201
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,900
This is blue leader, we have roses understanding ...

202
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,900
At 30 degrees, and wait.

203
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,800
Rozen. - 30 Degrees, understood. We go out.

204
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,900
Stay at a distance, guy. He has a small setback.

205
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
That is now a collector nectar.

206
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Do you ever sometimes pollination closely? - No, sir.

207
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,700
I pack some pollen from here, and throw 't there.

208
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,200
And perhaps a bit there, a dash of that there.

209
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,900
Can you see that. It is to little magic, is not you?

210
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,100
That is wonderful, why are we doing this?

211
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,700
That is "pollen power" guy.

212
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,300
The more pollen, the more flowers, more nectar, honey for us.

213
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,900
Cool.

214
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,000
I get a lot of yellow. Can madeliefjes, we need one?

215
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,800
Begrepen, I have them in sight. - Wait agree that flowers move apparently.

216
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,500
Another. Report you moving a flower? - Right.

217
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,700
This is so cool. What is' t? - I do not know, but that color is absurd.

218
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,700
It smells good. Not as a flower, but I think it is tasty.

219
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,700
Yes, fluffy. - Chemical.

220
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Caution boys, 'to paste a little.

221
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,700
Dear God, finally rest. - He smart, come on it.

222
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,500
Probleempje.

223
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,500
Boys! - This would still agree error can expire.

224
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,900
Begrepen.

225
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
That scheelde nothing.

226
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,800
That will hurt.

227
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,100
I am mommy's little boy. - You are out of position, broekie.

228
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,800
He comes back as a rocket.

229
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,300
Help me!

230
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,300
I do not believe that this flowers. - Should we tell him this?

231
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
I do believe that those that know.

232
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,900
What is this?

233
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
Matchpoint.

234
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,900
Pak but dear, as they go eat.

235
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,500
Gadver.

236
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
There is one in the car.

237
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,200
Do something! - I 't drive.

238
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,500
Hello bijtje. - He is here, he is stabbing me.

239
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,000
Do not move. If you remain silent sit cross not.

240
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,100
Halt.

241
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,600
He knipperde.

242
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,100
What do you do now?

243
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,400
The attention is unbelievable here.

244
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,500
I have to go home.

245
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,300
I can not fly in the rain.

246
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,300
I can not fly in the rain.

247
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,300
Mayday. I crashes.

248
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Ken want you to close the window, please?

249
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,400
Look at my new CV, I have a folder of pop.

250
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,200
See you, he flips out.

251
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,100
Not many more people, I have no sense.

252
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,900
What was that?

253
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,100
Maybe this time, this time ...

254
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
The curtains!

255
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,400
That's devils.

256
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,300
It is fantastic. - There are all my special skills.

257
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,300
Even with my top ten favorite movies. - What is there one? Star Wars?

258
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,900
I do not like that ...

259
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Sort things.

260
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,900
Logical that we are not allowed to speak with them. They are not quite tasty.

261
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,800
If I 'n candidature wegloop, they overpowers. They do not believe what I am saying.

262
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,200
There you have the sun. Perhaps this is a way out.

263
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,500
I can not remember that the sun had a big 75 out.

264
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,000
And if I can now say that I agree 't greenhouse effect have voorspeldt.

265
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,700
I feel 't be warmer. At first I thought that I just had.

266
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,100
Stop! Near!

267
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,600
Turn him dead. - Stay there, these are winterschoenen.

268
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,400
Now you can not ... - Wait!

269
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,200
Make him not dead. - You know I am allergic to them. It may cause my death.

270
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,000
Why is his life worth less, than that of yours?

271
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,600
Why his life would be worth less than that of me? Is that your position?

272
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,100
I am saying only that everything that lives a certain value.

273
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,600
You do not know what all can feel.

274
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,400
My brochure.

275
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,600
There you go, little guy.

276
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,400
I am not afraid but that allergy, eh.

277
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,700
Why you do not put on your CV brochure.

278
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,900
That is not funny, my whole face may swell.

279
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Create one of your special skills.

280
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,900
Someone knock-out store, has a special skill.

281
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Doeg Vanessa. - Vanessa, next week yogurt evening?

282
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,800
Of course, Ken, is a good thing. You can chip in, did you know that? - Doeg.

283
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,900
You have to think that calories ...

284
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,400
I have something to say.

285
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,600
She has saved my life. I have something to say.

286
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,300
Okay, here it comes.

287
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,400
What should I say?

288
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,100
I can really in trouble.

289
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,200
It is a bijenwet. You should not speak against a man.

290
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,200
I can not believe that I am.

291
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,400
I must do.

292
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,100
I can 't not. Come on.

293
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,600
No. Yes. No. Get 't now.

294
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,800
I can 't not. How should I start?

295
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,700
Keep you think of jazz? No, it's not.

296
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,000
Since she comes. Speak then, gekkie.

297
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,100
Hi.

298
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,600
'T Spijt me.

299
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,600
You talk. - Yes, I know 't sorry ...

300
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,400
You speak. - I know 't, excuse me.

301
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,100
No, it's all good. It's ok.

302
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,700
It is only ... I know I dream, but I do not remember that I am gone to bed.

303
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,600
Well, I know that this is very verwarend is ...

304
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,300
Yes, this comes as a complete surprise.

305
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,300
I mean, you are one.

306
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,300
Yes, I am 'n at, and I can not do this ...

307
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,500
But they tried to kill me. And if you have not been ...

308
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,400
I mean, I had to thank you.

309
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,800
If I happen to be raised.

310
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,000
That was a little crazy.

311
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,300
I talk to one. - Yes.

312
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,700
In any case ... - Die to talk to me.

313
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,800
I just wanted to let you know that I am grateful to you. And now I go back.

314
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,900
Wait. How did you learn that? - What? - That talk?

315
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,500
Same as you think I am. Mamma, dadda, honey, you take things over.

316
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,200
Very funny. - Yes, bees are funny.

317
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,200
We laugh but not crying, with what we all must pass.

318
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,200
In any case ... - Can I ...

319
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,700
Can I do something for you tackle? - Like what?

320
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,900
I know a lot ... I mean ... I do not know.

321
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,200
Coffee?

322
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,800
Well, I do not want to be a burden ... - No problem. - Unless you ... - 'T period but two minutes.

323
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,100
Really? - It is only coffee.

324
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,500
I would like not taken. - Do not mold.

325
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,000
I would be a bakkie lusts.

326
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,900
Do you what rumcake? Take a piece of cake. - No, thank you.

327
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,600
Come on. - No, I try to lose a few micrograms.

328
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Where? - Well, not really help these streaks.

329
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,000
It looks good. - Not if you know anything about fashion.

330
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,400
Are you okay? - No.

331
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,600
He binds his tie in the taxi while he Mendis flies.

332
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,500
He finally comes to rent the steps of the church up ...

333
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,100
The wedding has been busy, and says watermelon ...

334
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,600
I thought you Gautamalen said. Why would I marry a watermelon?

335
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,700
Is that 'n. .. Bijenmop? - Yes, these are the things that we are doing.

336
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,500
Yes. Anders.

337
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,700
Well ... What are you going to do now Barry? With my job? I know 't not.

338
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,900
I want to do my part for the colony, but not as they wish.

339
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,200
I know how you feel you. - Is that so?

340
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,300
Of course, my parents that I wanted a lawyer or doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

341
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,200
Really?

342
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,400
I am only interested in flowers.

343
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,200
Our new queen was chosen with the same slogan.

344
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,600
In any case ... If you look ... That is our beehive.

345
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,000
You can 't see. - You live in Sheapmadows.

346
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Yes. Know your schildpaddenplas? - Yes. - Direct to it.

347
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,000
You feel 't. I know that area. Did you know that I have ever been a teenring lost?

348
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,800
Really? - Yes. - Why do girls rings on their toes?

349
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,900
Why not? - That is the same as you have a hat on your knee.

350
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,200
Maybe I try that again.

351
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,300
All right, Madam? - Yes, everything is fine ...

352
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,700
I have only two cups of coffee.

353
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,800
In any case, thanks for the coffee. - Yes, no problem.

354
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Sorry that I did not get on. If I would do that, I sat here the rest of my life.

355
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,800
Can I get a piece of pregnant women? - Of course, take a kruimel.

356
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,700
Thanks.

357
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,100
Okay then, I see you still. Or not.

358
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,100
Okay Barry.

359
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
And thanks again for a moment.

360
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,600
Well, that was nothing. - Well not nothing, but in any event ...

361
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,400
This may not succeed. - Well he is ready, so we can 't even try.

362
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Ok Dave, full force.

363
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,100
It sounds great. - It was also great.

364
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,900
It was the engste and happiest night of my life.

365
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,800
People. I can not believe that you together with people.

366
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,400
Huge narrow people. How were they?

367
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,900
Gigantisch and crazy.

368
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,300
They talk crazy, and they eat gigantic mad things ...

369
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,500
And they drive around a bit strange. - And they tried to murder you like on TV?

370
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,100
Some. But others do not.

371
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,000
How did you come back? - Poodle.

372
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,700
You can 't done, and I am happy.

373
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,600
You saw what you wanted to see, you have your experience ...

374
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,700
And now you are back, you can choose your job and everything is normal.

375
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,500
Well ... - Well?

376
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,800
Well, I did meet someone. - You met someone?

377
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,300
Still no wasp, will you murder your parents. - No.

378
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,900
A spin? - I am not attracted to the spinning.

379
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,900
I know that everyone believes it is too crazy with eight legs and everything ...

380
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,700
But I can not at their faces.

381
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:30,000
Well, who is she? - She is ... A man.

382
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,700
Oh no, that has not happened. That you have not done.

383
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
This is a bijenwet. You still violates no bijenwet.

384
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,600
Her name is Vanessa. - Oh no.

385
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,500
She is so nice. And it is a bloemiste.

386
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,600
No, you verkering with a human bloemiste. - Well, I do not verkering.

387
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,500
You fly out of the basket.

388
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,000
You talk to people who attack our houses ...

389
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
With chains and long sticks.

390
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,200
That is even worse than dynamite.

391
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,500
She has saved my life. And she understands me.

392
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,200
This is over. - Eat this view.

393
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,300
This is not over. What was that?

394
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,000
They call them a kruimel. That was the super-luxury.

395
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,700
And that's not even what they eat, but what if they fall off 't eat.

396
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,400
Do you know what a sesamzaadbroodje? - No.

397
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,100
That is bread with sesame seeds sprinkled over gestrooid that heat ... - Sit.

398
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,300
Very tasty. - Listen to me. We are their not.

399
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,200
We are. You have us, and then you have them.

400
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,600
Yes but, whoever it may be heart to 't ignore desire?

401
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,500
There is no desire. Stop desire, listen to me.

402
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,400
You have to go back to thinking as one, my friend.

403
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:37,100
Thinking as one.

404
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,600
Since he is. He is in 't pool.

405
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,300
You know what your problem is, Barry?

406
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,000
I must begin to think as one.

407
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
Barry how long this goes even further so?

408
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,400
It has been three days, I do not understand why you have not 't work.

409
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,200
Well I am still highly levensbeslissingen to thinking.

410
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,000
What life? You have no life.

411
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,700
You have no job. You have just one.

412
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,400
Would you go out death to be a little honey to make?

413
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,200
Barry come up, your father is your 't speak.

414
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,700
Pa would you disagree with him speak? Barry - I speak against you.

415
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,700
This is great.

416
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,800
Can you? - Do you have everything?

417
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,200
I am ready. Ga - but at least, I get you.

418
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,100
Be not too long.

419
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,400
Check this out.

420
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,500
Come here Barry. - I said no to him to shout.

421
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,100
He does not respond when you against him screaming.

422
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,600
Why you cry against me? - Because you are not listening.

423
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,000
I do not listen to.

424
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,400
Ma Sorry, but I must go. - Where are you going to?

425
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,100
Nowhere around. I meet a friend. - A girl?

426
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,800
Is that why you can not decide? - Doeg.

427
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,200
I just hope she is in one.

428
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,700
So they have a big parade every year of just flowers in Passadena?

429
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,400
It is for each florist his dream, to participate in the tournament of roses.

430
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,800
On a cart, which is surrounded by flowers. 'T Public welcomes that.

431
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,700
'N Tournament? Do the roses really part of an athletic parts?

432
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,100
No. I have another. Why not fly anywhere you go?

433
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,700
That is exhaustive. Ren Why you not go? Is that not faster?

434
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,600
Okay, you have me. You are in line.

435
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,100
TIHO? You can just live broadcasts silent. That is absurd.

436
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,400
Have you not then? - We have HVO but it is a disease.

437
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,900
But this is a terrible disease. - My God.

438
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,200
Dumb bees.

439
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,400
You need someone like stabbing all those acorns?

440
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,600
We try not to stabbing. It is usually fatal for us.

441
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,700
So you have to really pay attention to your mood. - Yes, really.

442
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,600
You schopt against a wall. Whether you are a circle. You write an angry letter and throw that way again.

443
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,500
It makes it just as any other emotions ...

444
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Anger, jealousy, lust.

445
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,200
My God, are you okay? - Yes.

446
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,300
What do you know? - It is a.

447
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,100
He is still not difficult. Make it your way, engerd.

448
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,000
What was that? 'T Own house and garden magazine?

449
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,400
Yes, how did you know that?

450
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,000
'T Voelde as ten pages. 75 Is our limit.

451
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,400
That gives you a good investigation.

452
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,700
We must, however, I lost a cousin to the Italian Vogue.

453
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,000
You feel 't.

454
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,900
What in the name of the mighty Hercules is this?

455
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Why is this here?

456
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,800
Knappe. Golden Flower.

457
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,400
Ray Liotta private collection.

458
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,700
Is that not an actor? - I have never heard of him.

459
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,300
Why is that? - For people to eat.

460
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,000
Why? Have you not enough food for you?

461
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,100
Indeed. - How come you are indeed?

462
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,400
Well bees make it. - I know who 't.

463
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,100
And it is difficult and hard to sell 't it.

464
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,000
You must 't heating, cooling, stirring, you have a whole process.

465
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,300
It is organic. - It is our-ganisch.

466
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,700
It is honey, Barry.

467
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,800
It is ... What? Bees here know nothing of, this is steal.

468
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,300
A lot steal.

469
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,200
You have our homes, schools, hospitals take away from us. This is all we have.

470
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,800
And it's in the sales?

471
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,200
I go out at all this.

472
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,700
He Hector ...

473
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,300
Are you almost done? - Almost.

474
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,200
He is here. I can feel him.

475
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,600
I think I now but to go home, and this delicious honey let alone.

476
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,600
There is nobody in the neighborhood.

477
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,200
You are there, dozenjochie.

478
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,000
I knew that I heard something. So you can still talk.

479
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,800
Of course I can talk. And now you go talk.

480
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,700
How do I get all this sweet stuff?

481
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,300
Who is your supplier? - I do not know where you left.

482
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,800
I thought we were all friends.

483
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,600
'T Last thing we want is your bees upset.

484
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,200
You are too late, it's now us.

485
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,200
You sir, have challenged the wrong.

486
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,600
You sir, 't point to be launched.

487
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,300
Where does the honey come from?

488
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,000
Say!

489
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,900
Honingboerderijen. It comes from honingboerderijen.

490
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,000
Crazy vermin.

491
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,600
Jemig, what a terrible thing happened here?

492
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,300
Look at the faces. They have 't never see it coming.

493
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,000
And now they are on the road to nowhere go.

494
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,000
Keep quiet. - What? You are not dead?

495
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,100
See me death? They sweep away everything that moves.

496
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,100
Where are you going to? Towards the honingboerderijen.

497
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
I am something big 't track.

498
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,200
I go to Alaska, for the elandbloed.

499
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,700
Too crazy stuff. Are you completely wild.

500
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,600
I go to Dacoma.

501
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,700
And you then? - It is really dead.

502
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,200
Okay.

503
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,900
What's that?

504
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,700
Oh no, it's a wiper, driebladen. - Driebladen?

505
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,100
Pak, it's your only chance.

506
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,600
Why must everything so damned clean?

507
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,000
What you do not want to see?

508
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,000
Open your eyes. Insert your head off 't window.

509
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,100
For 't NVR news from Washington, I am Carl Hessel.

510
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,700
Vermoord Moosblood not.

511
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,300
Hear you something? - Like what?

512
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,500
As tiny geschreeuw. - Turn on the radio.

513
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,600
How does' t bijjongen? - He Blood.

514
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,600
And there was a very long row of honingpotten, where 't eye could see.

515
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,500
So I presume that this truck go, that they 't come there.

516
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,200
This honey is ours. Bee-keeping is always together.

517
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,000
We are all together, it's a strong colony.

518
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,200
We no man, we are all on our own.

519
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,200
Each mug for himself. - And if you are in trouble?

520
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,700
Problems? You are a mug. They are 't problem.

521
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,100
Nobody likes us believe, so save them to us. If they see a mug, save them.

522
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,100
You are at least in the free world. You will meet a lot of girls.

523
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
Girls mosquitoes try to improve ...

524
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,100
Try a mot, or a libel to strikken. They do not want another mug.

525
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,300
You take me in the leg. Moosblood state 't point' t building to leave.

526
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,900
Goodbye.

527
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,400
He boys.

528
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,300
I knew that I would find you here.

529
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,000
Do you have your straws with you?

530
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,000
Then we throw 't in pots do a label around it. That is pure profit.

531
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,900
What is this for a place?

532
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,400
One in the brain as big as a pin. - 'T His also speldenknopjes.

533
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,700
Hey check out the new bedwelmer. - So, cool.

534
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,400
That is you wanted. - The "Thomas 3000.

535
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,700
A bedwelmer? - Ninety pufs per minute, semiautomatisch.

536
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,100
That blows the nicotine forever.

537
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,100
A cloud of this verdooft them directly.

538
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,400
They make honey, and we deserve the money.

539
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,800
They make honey, and we deserve the money?

540
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,900
Jemig.

541
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,300
What happens? Are you okay?

542
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Yes, it does not take long.

543
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,100
How are you all here? Do you know that you are in a false beehive?

544
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,600
Our queen is here move. We had no choice.

545
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,400
Is that your queen? This is a man in vrouwenkleren.

546
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,100
This is a travestiet.

547
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,700
What is this?

548
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,300
Oh no, there are hundreds.

549
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,900
Bijenhoning. Our honey.

550
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,200
With large quantities of our stolen.

551
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,100
This is much worse than what these bears have affected us all.

552
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,100
And I intend to overcome going to do.

553
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,300
Barry stopper. - Who has told you that people steal our honey?

554
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,200
That is only a rumor. - Does that look like a rumor?

555
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,600
This is a samenzwerings theory, which pictures are clearly manipulated.

556
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,500
Barry, how are you this had affected?

557
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,500
Because he is with the people 't talk. - What? - People talk?

558
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,600
He has a human girlfriend, and they kiss with each other.

559
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,400
Cushion with each other, Barry? - We do not.

560
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,800
This would you ever want. - Which side you stand?

561
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,800
On the side of the bees.

562
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,900
I had ever verkering with a cricket from San Antonio ...

563
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,100
Man who kept me mad legs the whole night awake.

564
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,600
Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?

565
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,700
This does do for all of our lives.

566
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,600
No one is working harder than the bees.

567
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,700
Pa, I can remember that you sometimes at night came home ...

568
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,000
Overworked so that your hands still 't run, and you could not stop.

569
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,800
I know that very well.

570
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,300
What right have they to our hard obtained honey?

571
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,700
We must 't do with two cups per year ...

572
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,400
And they stop the big boxes, but without a reason.

573
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,200
If 't all true, what can one do in there?

574
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,000
I go where they stabbing 't they really hurts.

575
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,100
In 't face? - No.

576
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,500
In 't eye. That really does pain. - No.

577
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,600
In their nose, this is a giller. - There is only one place where you can really their stabbing.

578
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,100
There is only one area where "t really important.

579
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,600
High Five, the only active full news channel.

580
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,400
With Bob Bumble as newsreader.

581
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,000
Weerman George Linger.

582
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,800
With Sports Buzz LaBie.

583
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,700
And with Janet Chubet.

584
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,800
Goedenavond, I am Bob Bumble. - And I am Janet Chubet.

585
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,600
Our head. A Trycountie to Barry Benson ...

586
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,400
He says that the human race will denounce 't steal our honey.

587
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,500
They pack it, and take advantage of it illegally.

588
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,500
Forget 't not. Morgenavond by Larry King ... Near

589
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,100
We have three former queens, all three here in our studio ...

590
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,100
Al discuserend about their new book, "Classic ladies' suits this week to Hexecon.

591
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,100
Tonight we talk with Barry Benson.

592
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,900
Have you ever thought: I am but a joch from the basket, I can not?

593
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,400
Larry, we bees have never been afraid to change the world.

594
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,600
How about, Bijcolumbus, Bijahndi or Bijezus.

595
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,400
Well, where I come from, you would not think for people to complain.

596
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,600
We were more reminiscent of zuurstokken or snoepwinkels.

597
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
How old are you?

598
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,100
I want to let you know that the entire bijenbevolking your support in this matter ...

599
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,200
Certainly the trial of the bijeneeuw.

600
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,400
Thank you Larry. Did you know that in the human world also have a Larry King?

601
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,300
That name is increasingly common. Next week, Larry King ... Near

602
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,500
I mean he looks like you, and has a show and also has braces,

603
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,000
And different color dots behind him ...

604
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,700
Next week By Larry king ... - 'N Ouwe man with glasses, with notes on the ground ...

605
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
The guests you look, although he has just heard.

606
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,800
Next week, they are shocking and harig, and they are live.

607
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,800
Leunt always forward, pointed shoulders, clenched eyes, very Jewish.

608
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,400
In tennis you fall in the areas where they are weak.

609
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,100
But 't was my grandmother, Ken. She is 81.

610
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,500
Lieverd, her backhand is worthless, and that you do not abuse.

611
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,000
Quiet please, there is really here.

612
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,500
Is that the same here? - Yes, that is true.

613
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,600
I help him to 't human race to complain. - What?

614
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,500
Hello. - Hello.

615
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,700
This is Ken. - Yes, I remember you. Timberland, scoop 46 with ribbed soles believe me.

616
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,200
How come 't even again that she can talk?

617
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,500
You should go, because we are very busy 't work.

618
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,100
But it's our yoghurt evening. - Doegie.

619
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,700
Why is so difficult evening yoghurt?

620
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,100
Poor thing, you are already d'r hours doing.

621
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,800
Yes. And Adam helps great.

622
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,300
How much sugar do you want? One - but, I want quiet. "

623
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,900
Why you help me?

624
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,500
Bees have good qualities. - Yes, please.

625
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,700
And 't feels good to not even need to be done to thinking.

626
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,200
I do not know why, but people now give each other bouquets of ballonen.

627
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,500
Yes, those are super ... If you are three.

628
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,100
Of art flowers. - Here I am totally disturbed.

629
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,600
Yes, I do. Die-sharp leaves, the senseless pollination.

630
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,000
You bees should fake plastic things hated.

631
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,600
There is nothing worse than a daffodil, which is edited.

632
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,400
Well perhaps that this' t than a little good.

633
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,200
You know Barry, this lawsuit is something quite grand.

634
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,100
I think 't too. - Are you sure you want to do?

635
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,400
Whether I am sure?

636
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,000
If I am ready, the people no longer say:

637
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,700
"Honingbijtje I am at home", without having to pay for it.

638
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,900
It is an amazing scene here in Manhattem ...

639
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,500
Because all ears and eyes focused, because for the first time in the history

640
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,000
We will hear all of a honingbij really can talk.

641
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,100
What if you are not loud enough, Barry?

642
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,100
I do not. But it's very big, you think not?

643
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,200
I can not believe that so many people are free daytime.

644
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,400
Do you think that millions of multinational food, good lawyers?

645
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,400
Everyone must remain behind the fence.

646
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,600
What's going on? - I do not know, I just got a chill.

647
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,700
If we 'tB team do not have.

648
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,400
Have any of you participated in this?

649
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,800
All. High court Bumbleton leads this session.

650
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,200
Case Number 4475 't high courts of New York,

651
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,300
Barry B Benson against the Honey Industry, will now start.

652
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,700
Mr.. Montgomery you represented all five major food chains? "It is for me an honor.

653
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,100
Mr.. Benson ... You represented all bees of this world?

654
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,800
But I make a joke. Honorable Yes, we are ready to proceed.

655
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,200
Mr.. Montgomery let me your openingspleidooi hear?

656
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,400
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury ...

657
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,700
My grandmother was a simple man, who was born on a farm ...

658
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,300
They believed that 't was her human right,

659
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,600
To take advantage of the gifts that nature gives us.

660
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,800
If we could stay where Mr.. Benson's our sketch ...

661
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,600
Do you agree, how 't would be then.

662
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,200
Maybe I should negotiate with the caterpillars, on the side of my elastic.

663
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,500
A talking here?

664
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:22,400
How do we know whether 't not some kind of holographic film vastleggende tovenarij?

665
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,100
They were sometimes able to use laser beams.

666
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:32,500
Robots, poppenspelers, kleifiguren, "t he same money to the steroids.

667
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,600
Mr.. Benson.

668
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,900
Ladies and gentlemen, this has nothing to trucage to make, but I am an ordinary.

669
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,600
And as for, honey is very important for me.

670
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,600
It is important for all bees. We have 't invented. We make it.

671
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,500
And we protect 't with our lives.

672
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,100
Unfortunately, there are people in this room,

673
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,400
Who think that they all of us can afpakken because we are small.

674
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,500
What I hope is that if all of this is over ...

675
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,800
You realize that if you steal our honey, you not only diminish what we have everything ...

676
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,100
But everything we are.

677
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,800
I wish that he always did dress. He looks so beautiful.

678
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,600
Call your first witness.

679
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,300
Mr.. Claus Vanderheyden of honingboerderij. Best is a great company that you have.

680
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,700
I suppose so.

681
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,200
And I see that you Honeyburton and Honron possession.

682
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,600
Yes, supplying beekeepers for our farms.

683
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,100
Bijenhouders I find a great word to be honest ...

684
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,400
I presume that you do not bijbevrijders employed, or did you?

685
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,900
No. - Sorry, but I verstond you not.

686
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,500
No. - No, because you are not free bees.

687
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,900
You keep bees. But not only that ...

688
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,700
'T show that you thought that a jar in the shape of a bear was very appropriate.

689
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:57,200
Well 't been a nice animals, Yogibear, Fuzzy bear, and Bill the Bear.

690
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,300
Yes. You mean like this?

691
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,600
Bears murder bees.

692
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,000
How would you describe 't find this great haarbal your living room to walk?

693
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,900
That he bites into your bank, your cushions apart.

694
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,900
That is enough, but take him back.

695
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,200
Mr.. Sting, we thank you want to be here.

696
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,500
Your name, I find interesting, which I have already heard once before?

697
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,400
I was in a band, The Police.

698
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,300
But you have never been a policeman, either? - No, that is true.

699
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,800
No, that you have not.

700
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,100
And so we have yet another example ...

701
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,700
A man who knows anything from the bijencultuur steals for nothing less than a beautiful show business name.

702
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,000
Come on now, please.

703
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:47,600
Do you ever sometimes put, Mr.. Sting? Because I feel good fooled, Sting.

704
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,800
Or should I say, Mr.. M Gordon Sumner?

705
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,400
Is that his real name? Idioot.

706
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,700
Mr.. Liotta firstly, I would like to congratulate you on your Emmy Award,

707
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,700
You won your guest in ER, 2005. - Thank you.

708
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:13,400
I see on your resume that you are clever stunning, and you a brief lontje.

709
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,200
I have fun with what I do. Is that so bad?

710
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,400
Not no, but this is where you come are Mr.. Liotta ...

711
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:25,700
'T exploiting small helpless bees, so you do not have to rehearse for your role, sir?

712
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,600
Watch out Benson, I can just shoot from my sheet.

713
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,600
This is not a good guy, but a bad guy.

714
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,600
Why get there nobody on this small engerd, then we can all go home.

715
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,000
Order in the courtroom. - You guys are all crazy.

716
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:43,400
Order I had said. Please Ga.

717
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,300
I thought 't very nice of that beer, which just joined.

718
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,900
I tell you, the jury is on our side.

719
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,100
Are we doing everything okay, I mean legally?

720
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,600
I am a florist. - Yeah, ok.

721
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,300
Let us toosten on a super team. - On a super team.

722
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,500
Also hello.

723
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,900
Hello. - I thought that you would not come.

724
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,300
No, I am only too late. I tried to call, but the battery ...

725
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,300
I wanted this not throw away, so I called Barry.

726
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Fortunately, he was free. - Yes. - There you have it than luck.

727
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,700
There is still a little left. I 't be hot for you.

728
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,000
Yes heat it, what you want.

729
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,900
I hear that you can pretty tennis?

730
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,400
I have not so much with that game, I think the ball quite desirable.

731
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,400
That is my normal. Exactly there.

732
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,100
Barry looked at your CV ...

733
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,500
And he was' t agree with me that sticks not eat a real special skill.

734
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,400
Think you that I can not do?

735
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,200
Hey listen, I know how difficult it's suitable for the job.

736
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,100
That is something we definitely have in common.

737
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,600
Is that so?

738
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:12,000
Well, we bees have no unemployment, but we have jobs like her.

739
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,700
That I was just planning to do so.

740
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,500
Ken, I have Barry you scheermesje borrowed for his angel sharpen them.

741
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,500
I hope that was in order.

742
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,000
I go my angel hanging in the pot. - Yes, please do that again.

743
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:48,100
You know, I 't had with your hersenspinsels.

744
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,800
What's that? - The Italian Vogue.

745
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,000
These are many pages. - There are many ads.

746
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,500
Think of what Vanessa said, why is your life worth more than that of me.

747
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,600
That is funny, that I can no longer remember.

748
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,500
I believe that something stinks here.

749
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,500
I love the smell of flowers.

750
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,500
Yes? What do you think of the smell of flames?

751
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,900
Not so tasty.

752
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,400
I am but an insect, I am neutral.

753
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,600
Ken now look again, I wear a vingerhoed as a hat. This is ridiculous.

754
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,800
I have other problems.

755
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,100
Look, a Royal Flush. - You bluft.

756
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,300
Is that so?

757
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,800
Surf's Up, makker. - Gatver, poepwater.

758
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:07,300
That pot is intact. That dirty-yellow rings after.

759
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,000
Kenny, what are you doing?

760
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,500
You know, I do not even honey. I eat disagree.

761
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,400
We need to talk. He is just a little one.

762
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:22,400
And he has the best chance to that in a long time I have met before.

763
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,800
In a long time? Where did you 't about?

764
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,600
Are there more insects in your life?

765
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,500
No, but there are other things that stabbing me, and you are one of them.

766
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,100
Good. Speaking with bees, no more evenings yogurt ...

767
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,200
My brain touch of battle with this emotional roller coaster riding.

768
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,100
Goodbye, Ken.

769
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,800
And for you, I love artificial sweeteners made, which are made by people.

770
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,500
Excuse me.

771
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,200
I know that 't an after taste, but I find tasty.

772
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,700
I have always known that there is a kind of barrier between Ken and myself stood.

773
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,200
I can not ousting. Well yes.

774
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,700
Feel you can still be good for the lawsuit tomorrow?

775
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,700
I think that Mr.. Montgomery no longer has ideas.

776
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,300
We would like Mr.. Barry Benson B calls as a witness.

777
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,600
Look it is now even a good idea.

778
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,000
You can be here to see why he is considered as one of the best lawyers ...

779
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,700
Layton, you will have to use some magic with this jury, or else everything is over.

780
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,500
Do not worry, Mr.. Gamble ...

781
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,400
All I need to do to this jury for us to win is ...

782
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,800
To have them remember what they did not like it to bees.

783
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,700
Did you 't tweezers? - Are you allergic?

784
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,700
Only to lose, boy.

785
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,100
Mr.. Benson B, I ask you what we would all like to know ...

786
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:53,600
What is your relationship with that woman?

787
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,000
We are friends. - Good friends?

788
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:01,300
Yes. - How good? Living together you?

789
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,000
Wait a minute ... what - Are you her little bedmug?

790
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,500
This is not 't kind of relative ... - I already have a couple bijtje seen in my life ...

791
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:14,200
And what I have learned from this experience is that the queen all small bijtje concern in the basket.

792
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,300
Yes, but ... - So these are not even your real parents?

793
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,800
That they do. - Notify me against!

794
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,600
You are an unlawful bijtje or not Benson?

795
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,100
He kleineert the bees.

796
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,600
And do you 't not all with you nephews and nieces?

797
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,200
I protest. - I agree that vent stabbing.

798
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,800
Adam not do, this is what he wants.

799
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,800
I am concerned.

800
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,900
Dear God, I am hit. - Order!

801
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,900
The poison ... The poison causes that I go ijlen.

802
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,800
I am down by a beast of the destruction.

803
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,600
See you. You can not treat as an equal, 't be biting barbarians.

804
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,200
They use 't only thing they know, if they happen to be.

805
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,800
Adam hold on. - I no longer feel my legs.

806
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:13,400
Dear angel of mercy, come to me and suction 't poison from my beautiful kontje.

807
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,900
I want order in my courtroom.

808
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,700
Order! Order, please!

809
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,200
Thank you.

810
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,500
He friend. Do you have so much pain? - Yes.

811
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,100
I have ...

812
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,300
Everything verknalt, eh? - That gives nothing, 't most important thing is that you are still alive.

813
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,900
You had death can be. - That was perhaps better.

814
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,400
Take a look. They have 't out of the cafeteria.

815
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:10,300
They have 't start from the bottom. 'T Come out of a tuna sandwich. There are even some celery.

816
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,000
How felt 't to make a stabbing?

817
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:19,100
I can 't explain not. Adrenaline, a form of ecstasy.

818
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,900
Okay.

819
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:28,500
Do you think 't was a trap? - Of course. 'T Spijt me, I have let it run us.

820
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,200
What would I do not. See us again, we are only a couple of small insects in this world.

821
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,700
What do you think the people with us will do if they win?

822
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,000
I do not know.

823
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,900
I have heard that they kakkerlakken in a hotel have stopped. That does not sound bad.

824
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,500
Adam they check in, but they never check out.

825
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,300
Would you ask for a sister can 't be closed window? - Why?

826
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,000
They smoke. Bees smoking.

827
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,300
Correct. Bees smoking.

828
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:04,500
Bees not smoking, but some do. That is' t, that is our indictment.

829
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,200
Is that so? So it is not yet done?

830
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:11,600
No, you cloth. I have to go somewhere. Keep you clean up as much as possible.

831
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,500
And assuming that you step 22 well have ...

832
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,100
Are you ready for the bathtub.

833
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,200
Mr.. Flayman. - Yes, honorable.

834
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,200
Where is the rest of your team?

835
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:35,600
Well that is very interesting, bees are trained to wander around ...

836
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,900
And as a result we are not always on time.

837
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,700
I once heard a very nice story about ...

838
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:47,000
Hon, these insects are not ridiculous enough already wasted valuable time?

839
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:51,800
How long we continue this comedy still take?

840
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,400
They do not have a certificate issued in their indictment ...

841
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,900
Against my clients, who all lawful businesses.

842
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,800
I also ask about this matter completely close.

843
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,900
Mr.. Flayman I am afraid that I have 't Mr. proposal. Montgomery needs to reflect.

844
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,400
You can not do that. We have a great thing.

845
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:17,100
Where it's evidence, where are the Evidence? Where is' t smoking weapon?

846
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,400
Honorable Halt! You want a smoking weapon, now here is your smoking weapon.

847
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,500
What's that? - This is a bijenbedwelmer.

848
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,800
What this? This harmless little device?

849
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,100
This still does not hurt a fly, let alone one.

850
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:48,500
Members of the jury, look what happened to bees that have never been asked: Smoking or non-smoking.

851
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,200
Is this what nature for us?

852
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,700
That we forced became addicted to this rookmachines ...

853
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,500
In the man-made wooden labor camps.

854
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:01,500
That we must lead our lives as honingslaven of the white man?

855
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,200
What are we going to do? - It performs' t call races.

856
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,900
Ladies and gentlemen, please liberated these bees.

857
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:19,200
Free bees!

858
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:23,200
The court decided in 't advantage of the bees.

859
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,000
Vanessa we have won.

860
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,400
I knew that you could. High-Five.

861
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,900
Excuse me.

862
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,200
I am fine. Vanessa you know what this means?

863
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:38,100
All honey is now up to the bees, now we no longer have to work so hard all the time.

864
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,500
This is a onheilige schenderij of the balance of nature, Benson ...

865
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,100
Get still regret.

866
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,600
Barry, how much honey you think that is? - Wait, one person at a time.

867
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,800
Barry, who do you? - My sweater is Ralf Lauren, and I have no pants.

868
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,200
What if Montgomery is just right? - What do you mean?

869
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,800
We live our lives a long time. 27 Million years.

870
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,300
Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to require, as a settlement?

871
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,700
First, we demand that all labor camps to be closed.

872
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,500
Then we all honey back, all of us who actually was.

873
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,800
Each drop!

874
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,200
We demand that we stop the glorification of the bear.

875
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:28,200
He is nothing more than a dirty, smelly, rotten, fat stinkmachine.

876
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,500
And we all know what they are in 't forest.

877
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,800
Wait for my character!

878
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,900
Explain to him.

879
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,400
He will be tired a few hours. Then everything returned to normal.

880
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,800
And we accept no more negative afgeleidde by nickname.

881
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,100
It is just a name.

882
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,400
Needless abuse of honey in so-called health products.

883
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,200
And that excessive garnish hassle, during the tea.

884
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,600
I get no air.

885
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,600
But let bags, boys.

886
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,800
If that goes well. - Goedzo.

887
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,500
Mr.. Buzzwell, we have passed the three heads ...

888
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,700
And it continues to come. We must clean up close.

889
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,600
Quit? We never close.

890
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,400
Close honey production. Stop honey.

891
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,300
Turn your keys, sir.

892
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,400
And what are we doing now?

893
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,900
Bomblet!

894
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:02,600
We put honey production halt. Mission canceled.

895
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,800
End of bestuiven and nectar detail. We are returning to the base.

896
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,900
Adam, you can not believe how many there are out there honey.

897
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,800
Oh yes? - What happens here?

898
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,800
Where is everybody?

899
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,200
Are they out to celebrate? - They are just part and do not know what to do.

900
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,200
They include free, and sleeping.

901
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:10,300
I have heard that your uncle Carl was on to San Antonio, for a jar of cricket.

902
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,700
We have at least our honey.

903
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,100
Sometimes I think, well, and that the people were nice and our honey.

904
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,000
Who thought that's not.

905
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:19,700
It is' t best in the whole world. I was proud to a part of 't process.

906
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,800
This was my new desk. This was my new job.

907
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,800
I would very much like my utmost.

908
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,400
And now ...

909
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,300
Now I can no longer exists.

910
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,200
I do not think they are not happy.

911
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,800
They have so many now, I thought that their lives would be better now.

912
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,800
They do nothing. Honey really change people.

913
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,200
You really have no idea what is going on, eh?

914
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,800
What you wanted me to see? - This!

915
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,700
What's happened here? - That's not all.

916
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,400
My God, no.

917
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,500
They are all verdord.

918
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,800
It does not seem to be best off, eh?

919
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,900
No.

920
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,600
And who do you think are wrong that is?

921
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,100
I believe the bees. - Bees?

922
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,300
In particular me.

923
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,000
I did not know that if no honey bees would make all those other things would affect.

924
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,700
It is not only flowers but also vegetables and fruit. They have all the bees.

925
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,700
There you have talked about our entire Cito button.

926
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:43,900
You take all the green path, it dies the entire animal kingdom, and that affects the ...

927
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,900
The human race.

928
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,000
There is no pollination.

929
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,700
It may thus all piece.

930
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,100
And I know that 't even a part my fault.

931
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:05,000
How about a suicide treaty? - How would you like 't do?

932
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,900
I push you, you get me.

933
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,500
That kills you twice. - Is.

934
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:14,800
Listen Barry. 'T Spijt me, but I must.

935
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,400
I had also once again my big mouth open.

936
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,700
Vanessa why go your way? Where are you going to go?

937
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,900
In 't final tournament of the pink parade in Passadena.

938
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,600
They have 't shifted to this weekend, because all the flowers death on the go.

939
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,600
It is the last chance that I will ever get, because to be seen.

940
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,500
Vanessa, I would say that 't regret me. This was never my intention.

941
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,100
I know I do. Me too.

942
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,900
Tournament of roses. Roses do not sport.

943
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,600
Wait a minute. Roses?

944
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:07,900
Roses!

945
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,600
Roses are flowers. - Yes, that is true.

946
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,800
Flowers, bees, pollen.

947
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,200
That, I know, that is why this is the last parade.

948
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:23,400
Maybe not. Can you ask whether he wants to drive slower?

949
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,300
Can you drive slower?

950
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,800
Okay, I have a very big mistake.

951
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,100
This is a total fiasco and it's all my fault.

952
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,300
Yes, actually yes.

953
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:37,400
I have destroyed the planet, and I wanted to help you with your bloemenzaak ...

954
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,500
But instead I 't worse. - It is in fact completely closed.

955
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,600
I thought you 't grow.

956
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:48,100
But that aside, I have a different idea, and that is much better than all the ideas together.

957
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,800
I do not want it heard.

958
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:54,700
Okay, I have this thought. They have the roses, and roses have 't pollen ...

959
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:58,200
And I know any information, plant, and flower in the region.

960
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,700
All that we need to do, what they have here to bring what we have.

961
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,900
Bees. Section. - Pollen. - Flowers. Flower - pollination.

962
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,800
Because of the whole nation.

963
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,600
Okay. 'T Tournament of roses. Passadena California.

964
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,200
They have only flowers, cars and candy.

965
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,100
There will be a lot of security. - I have an idea.

966
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,900
Vanessa Bloom, FTD.

967
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,100
Official bloemenzaken. Yes, it's real.

968
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,100
Sorry Mrs.

969
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,400
That is a beautiful brooch. - Thank you, it was a gift.

970
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,900
And if we once inside, then we deal with the right car.

971
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,500
What do you think of the Princess of peas? - Yes.

972
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:36,600
I can be the princess and you can peas. - I snap it.

973
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,800
Sorry, I am too late. Where do I sit? - Who are you?

974
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,000
I think I am peas.

975
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,700
The pea? That should be placed under the mattresses.

976
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,500
Not in this tale, dear. - I 't against the official said.

977
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,500
Do that. This whole parade is a fiasco.

978
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,600
Let's see what this thing can.

979
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,000
What are you doing?

980
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,600
Then we mix in traffic.

981
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,700
Without falling down.

982
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,500
And once the 't airport, then nobody more against us.

983
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,600
Stop security.

984
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,700
Do you have this car parked itself? - Yes.

985
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,200
Is this car all the whole time in your possession? - Yes.

986
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,000
Would you like your shoes uitdoen, and everything from your pockets Halen? Can your angel?

987
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,900
That is to me. - Can, I was even a joke.

988
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,600
Happy flight.

989
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,900
And then if we have luck, we have enough pollen get the job done.

990
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:39,000
Notice how much happiness we have, we have just enough get the job done.

991
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,400
I think that 't will succeed, Vanessa. - It must succeed.

992
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,700
Attention passagieren, this is Captain Scott ...

993
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,000
I am afraid we have bad weather around New York ...

994
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:50,000
And it looks to be that we have a few hours delay.

995
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:54,100
Barry these are flowers without water, save, it's gone.

996
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,200
I have to go talk to those guys. - Get cautious.

997
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,500
Can I get some help with this pool magazine?

998
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,800
I would like the talking self zwembadfilter order.

999
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,900
Sorry captain, but I sit in a difficult package.

1000
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,500
What you said Halle? I said nothing.

1001
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Near! No-not flippen, there is a chance that my whole race ...

1002
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,900
What do you do?

1003
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:34,000
Are you crazy? I am a lawyer. - Who is a lawyer? - Do not move.

1004
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,100
Good afternoon passagieren here speaks your captain.

1005
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:49,800
Would Ms Vanessa Bloom Come to the cockpit? And shoots a little bit.

1006
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,600
What's happened here?

1007
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:55,900
I tried to talk with them but when ...

1008
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,400
There was a kruimeldief, a lifeboat revenged themselves ...

1009
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,000
Now there is a bald, one was already bald and they are both unconscious.

1010
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,400
Is that a joke bees? - No, nobody flies' t phone.

1011
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:09,200
This is the JFK control tower, flight 356 what is your status?

1012
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,800
You speak with Vanessa Bloom, a florist from New York.

1013
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,800
Where is the pilot? - That is unconscious, as the co-pilot.

1014
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:20,200
Not good. Is there anyone on board who flying?

1015
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,600
In fact, yes. - Who was that?

1016
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:26,200
Barry Benson. - Of those honingzaak? No. anyway.

1017
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,600
Vanessa this is nothing more than a metal with ...

1018
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:32,100
It has huge wings, and large engines. - I can not control plane.

1019
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,800
Is John Travolta is not even a pilot? - Yes.

1020
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,700
How difficult can it be?

1021
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,800
Wait again! Barry that we fly right to lightning.

1022
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,700
This is Bob Bumbble, we have important news of 't JFK airport ...

1023
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,600
Where a bizarre situation is developing.

1024
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:56,500
Barry Benson who just finished with his great lawsuit, will now try to load an aircraft.

1025
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,500
Filled with people, flowers, and a crew unconscious.

1026
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,600
Flowers?

1027
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,700
There is an electrical storm in the area ...

1028
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:08,300
And there are two people who have control of a jumbo jet without any flying.

1029
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,300
Wait a minute, there is a honingbij in that airplane.

1030
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,800
I am familiar with the work of Mr.. Benson ...

1031
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:17,300
Trivial and his comrades. Do they not have enough damage?

1032
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:21,800
But he is not your only hope? - Come on, which would technically not allowed to fly.

1033
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,100
Their wings are too small, in comparison to their body. - Wait a minute.

1034
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,200
Have we not heard often enough?

1035
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:30,300
That surface, the wings and lichaamsmassa stores nowhere.

1036
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,900
Make sure you do films. - Is for each other.

1037
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,600
Keep your ready. - We go live.

1038
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,100
The way we work, is perhaps a riddle for you ..

1039
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,400
Because honey to make, since you have a lot of bees.

1040
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,300
These are all small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job.

1041
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,300
If you do well, that makes a big difference.

1042
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,300
More than we realized. For ourselves and everyone.

1043
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,100
So let me also that bees are going to do what they 't best.

1044
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,700
Collaborate. That is the method of the.

1045
01:13:54,900 --> 01:14:00,900
We are not made of pudding, we are our male. Black and yellow!

1046
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,700
Left, right, down, up. - Up? Forget-up.

1047
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,900
You know what. This is not so difficult.

1048
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,700
Barry, what happened?

1049
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,600
Wait again, I think we flew all the time already on automatic pilot.

1050
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,700
That has helped me so. - And now no more.

1051
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,200
I can not control plane.

1052
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:32,000
Let's go help that guy. There on.

1053
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:46,100
Our only chance is if you do what I do, and you me nadoet with the wings of 't phone.

1054
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:49,900
You do not have to shout. - I do not cry. We just have a lot of problems here.

1055
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,200
I can concentrate hard, which paniektoon in your voice.

1056
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,800
It is no tone, but I am in panic.

1057
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,300
I can not. - Vanessa raap you together and listen to me.

1058
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,000
You must be quiet.

1059
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:18,900
Will you agree but quiet. - You must be quiet.

1060
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,900
You should do so quietly. - No, you should do so quietly.

1061
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Stop that. - Why? It's my turn.

1062
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:47,600
How can 't plane fly again? - I do not know.

1063
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,200
Hello? - He Benson, have you even flowers for a fine opportunity?

1064
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,600
Stuifmeelberijders. - They are really behind their male.

1065
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:57,500
Black and yellow.

1066
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,400
Hello! Okay you two, what would you say if we look at 't throw black asphalt?

1067
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,100
What black asphalt? I see nothing, do you?

1068
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,600
No nothing. It is so cloudy.

1069
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,200
Come on Barry, if you have a mind to.

1070
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:14,300
Think like 'n.

1071
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,700
Wait a minute, I think I feel something. - What?

1072
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,000
I do not know, but it's strong and 't attracts me.

1073
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:23,900
Like one 27 million years old instinct. Put the nose of the plane down.

1074
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,100
Think as a!

1075
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,800
What's going on hand on the runway? - Appearances the lights then!

1076
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,900
Vanessa mik that flower. - Okay.

1077
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,400
Turn the engine off. The engine-off?

1078
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,000
We load on bijenkracht. Ready, guys?

1079
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,100
Begrepen.

1080
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,600
Quietly. So yes.

1081
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,200
Land that flower. Ready guys?

1082
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,400
In the reverse. - We turn to us.

1083
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,900
Not the flour, but those other flower.

1084
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,600
What flower? - Die flower!

1085
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,700
I mik still on the flower. - That is Kaleknikker in his shirt flowers.

1086
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:10,600
I mean that flashing flour, which is made from millions of bees.

1087
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,900
Go forward, nose down. Run up the tail.

1088
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,700
Turn around it.

1089
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:20,900
This is gekkenwerk Barry. - This is the only way I know.

1090
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:24,900
Am I crazy 't be, or fly this unit like it was an insect?

1091
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,200
Put your nose in it. Do not be afraid. Ruik 't.

1092
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,500
In his backwards, and put it down quietly.

1093
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,500
Is there part of this.

1094
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,000
Mik 't middle.

1095
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,300
Bags!

1096
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,200
Shoot once.

1097
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,500
Barry 't is our successful. You have me learn to fly.

1098
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,300
Yes! No high-five. - Okay.

1099
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,000
Barry is successful, you saw that gigantic flower?

1100
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,900
What gigantic flower? Where? Of course I have seen.

1101
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,600
That was awesome man. - Thank you.

1102
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,300
But we are not there yet.

1103
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:25,300
Listen all, the runway is covered with flowers and the last 't last pollen.

1104
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,700
That means that this is our last chance.

1105
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,800
We are the only ones that make honey.

1106
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:33,100
Flowers bestuiven, so dress.

1107
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,200
If we want to survive as a race, this is our moment.

1108
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,400
So how do you think? Are we all bees ...

1109
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:43,100
Or keychain in 't museum of history.

1110
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,900
We are bees!

1111
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,100
Keychain.

1112
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,500
Then follow me, except those keychain there.

1113
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,100
Wait even Barry. Here you have earned this.

1114
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:08,200
I am a stuifmeelberijder. It fits like a glove.

1115
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,400
But what should I do with those sleeves?

1116
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,000
That's our Barry.

1117
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,900
Ma, the bees are back.

1118
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,900
If you see someone should call, it seems "to me that he should do that now.

1119
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,400
I believe that 't be late tonight.

1120
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:04,000
Here is your change. And another fine day.

1121
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,400
Do you have to have honey? It is approved by the bees.

1122
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,900
Forget it.

1123
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:15,600
Milk, cream, cheese, 't is all mine, but I see nothing in return.

1124
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,700
Sometimes I feel like a piece of meat.

1125
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,200
That was all I knew.

1126
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,900
Sorry, you have even?

1127
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,200
Excuseer me a while, my mug partner will provide further assistance.

1128
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,400
Sorry, I am too late. - Is he a lawyer?

1129
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:34,000
Madam, I was already a bloodsucker, I had only a aktekoffer needed.

1130
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,200
Another fine day ahead.

1131
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:39,100
Barry, I just have a very large tulip order within received for a wedding ...

1132
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,500
But I can not. - No problem, but leave that to me.

1133
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:46,000
You are a levensredder, Barry. Can I help the next?

1134
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,700
Okay stuifmeelberijders, 't is time to go.

1135
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,600
Thanks Barry.

1136
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
They live in my life.

1137
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,300
Let go, Kenny. - When will stop this nightmare now agree.

1138
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,200
It is a beautiful day to fly. - Certainly know.

1139
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,400
Between us, I am glad that I am out of that office.
