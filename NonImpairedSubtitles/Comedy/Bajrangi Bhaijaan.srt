1
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:40,202
Your boy is very impatient!

2
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:45,142
Have you thought of any name?

3
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:48,141
Shahid.

4
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:50,421
Why are you laughing?

5
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,441
If its a girl?

6
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:54,921
Girl!

7
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,341
What is your name dear?

8
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:40,981
Shahida.

9
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,101
Shahida.
Such a lovely name.

10
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:46,221
Where do you live?

11
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:54,241
So you'll only talk to your mom?

12
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:57,561
Nothing like that..

13
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:00,281
She doesn't talk to her mom either.

14
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:03,161
Why?

15
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,661
Shahida!

16
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,541
It's getting dark..

17
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,181
You go home..
I'll get your sheep home.

18
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:02,541
Rauf!

19
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,261
Rauf!

20
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:08,301
Where is Shahida?

21
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,621
Isn't she home yet?

22
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:10,981
She hasn't.

23
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:49,741
Stay here.

24
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:02,701
I have been telling you for days to
take her to Delhi.

25
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,461
Even mute people
can get cured there.

26
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,421
I was speechless at 5 years old.

27
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,121
I was taken there.

28
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:12,681
Did you get cured?

29
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,221
Do you wanna hear me talk?

30
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,621
But it's in India.

31
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:19,601
So what..

32
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:21,801
Its not in the US.

33
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:23,801
It is easier to go to the US..

34
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,981
Yes we were one nation
long time ago..

35
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:28,561
..did you forget that i
was in army for 5 years.

36
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,021
Indians will not give me visa.

37
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:35,901
I'll take her..

38
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:45,861
..so that she can talk again..
go to school again

39
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,121
I'll do anything for her.

40
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:52,601
I've decided.

41
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:58,241
I'll take Shahida to Delhi

42
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:36,361
no one returned empty
handed from the God's beloved .

43
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:43,281
She will talk again,
by the time you reach Pakistan.

44
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:56,321
Why has the train stopped?
-Slight delay due to construction madam.

45
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:59,381
It will be fixed soon.
Don't you worry.

46
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:03,931
I'll go to sleep then..

47
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:18,951
Shahida.

48
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:26,501
What happened?
-I can't find my daughter!

49
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,441
Indians are saying they
couldn't find your daughter

50
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:24,441
They'll search in the morning.

51
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:25,961
Sir..

52
00:15:26,221 --> 00:15:29,001
Please listen to me.

53
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,141
Let me go and find
her myself.

54
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:37,781
But its across the border,
..in a foreign land

55
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:41,421
So what.
I've to bring back my daughter.

56
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,761
But to go there
you'll need a visa.

57
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:48,341
Be patient, you'll get your daughter.
-How is that possible?

58
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:53,301
Don't you understand..
My daughter is mute..

59
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:56,461
She is alone in a foreign land.

60
00:15:57,241 --> 00:16:01,661
You people are hopeless..
I'll find Shahida by myself.

61
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:12,921
Trust in the Lord.

62
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:16,261
Stop crying my child..

63
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:23,161
Hope she'll be found
by a good person.

64
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:27,541
..Someone who will take
good care of her.

65
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:10,981
What is selfie?

66
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:16,261
Its that thing..we take ourselves..
photo..that's called selfie.

67
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:22,301
You danced like hero.!N-Yes I go crazy for Bajrangbali.

68
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:10,061
One paratha for this little girl please..
-OK sir.

69
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,541
But she is asking for 2..

70
00:22:20,181 --> 00:22:21,301
You must have some name.

71
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:25,001
Sita, Gita, Payal, Puja...

72
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:26,721
Seems that she's deaf.

73
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:28,861
She heard my order
for paratha.

74
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:30,381
You are right..

75
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:31,661
Let me try.

76
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:41,021
Name?

77
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:48,241
She's illiterate..
-Try writing in French.
She's 5 years old

78
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:53,001
Eat well.

79
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:13,181
Why are you following me?

80
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:20,161
Take this.

81
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:28,911
Did you get lost in a carnival?

82
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,321
Say something..?

83
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:37,661
What will I do?

84
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:47,561
Bajarangbali will protect.
This temple can work wonders.

85
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:52,401
Your parents might be
still looking for you..

86
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:57,821
They'll come here,
You just sit there..

87
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:09,121
See you..

88
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:15,021
If your parents take too long..

89
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:16,481
you..

90
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:18,441
..eat that apple..

91
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:20,151
don't stay hungry.

92
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:41,421
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus!

93
00:24:55,991 --> 00:24:57,781
You can't leave her here.

94
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:58,961
Why not?

95
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:01,821
Her parents will come
here to report..

96
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,031
What if they don't come.
-Then..

97
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:06,971
How come?
Why not?

98
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:08,521
Look at her.

99
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:21,841
Yes but you can't
leave her here.

100
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:23,001
Why?

101
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:24,681
Look at her.

102
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:29,051
Now have a look at them.

103
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:34,781
Its filled with thief,
drunkards, con-men..

104
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:37,421
By the way this is police station,
not an orphanage.

105
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,961
Write down your name, address,
phone no.

106
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:45,321
I'll call you when I have any information.

107
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:45,921
Until then?

108
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:49,861
Until then... God be with you.

109
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:02,101
Do you live here?

110
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:05,501
Where then?

111
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:08,121
Should be somewhere..

112
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:11,321
Lets do this..

113
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,001
I'll call out city names..

114
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:15,641
If its you city..

115
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,641
..raise you hand and
nod your head.

116
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:18,541
How?

117
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,261
Delhi..

118
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:26,821
Meerut..

119
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:29,981
Faridabad..

120
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:32,981
Gwalior..

121
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:42,581
Jhansi, Patiala, Amritsar, Jodhpur
Jaipur, Srinagar, Simla, Ambala?

122
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:44,461
Baroda?

123
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:46,461
Rampur?

124
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:48,461
Is it Dehradun?

125
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:49,201
Kasoli?

126
00:26:49,461 --> 00:26:51,111
Pratapgarh?..

127
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:53,681
Are you from Pratapgarh.
-Yes..

128
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:54,621
Me too.

129
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:56,521
Really?..
-Bajarangbali is my witness.

130
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:57,881
Lived near the station.

131
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:59,641
My in-laws live there.

132
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:01,501
Now you've become
my relative.

133
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:05,561
I now live in Delhi..
-Why Delhi?

134
00:27:05,561 --> 00:27:07,561
For girl or job.

135
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:11,001
its long story..

136
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:14,561
Tell us..we are not
waiting for any bus anyway.

137
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:16,561
Tell us bro..

138
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:19,971
You don't speak..
will you listen my story?

139
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,181
I'm Pawan..

140
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:25,041
Pawan Kumar Chatravedi

141
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:27,481
alias Bajarangi.

142
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:31,501
You call me brother...
How old are you?

143
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:33,501
six..

144
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:35,381
When you start talking..

145
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:37,701
..you call me uncle..

146
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:43,221
My father was a postmaster
in Pratapgarh

147
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:53,381
He was a master in Holy books.

148
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:56,421
I was just the opposite.

149
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:57,741
4 x 8?

150
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:04,261
no 25.. no 26
no 27..28...30

151
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:06,841
30?

152
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:13,961
For him health was as
important as education.

153
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:16,721
Good.. lets start.

154
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:23,095


155
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:27,001
I even failed in wrestling.

156
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:30,001
No laughing..

157
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,561
he won't reform

158
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:38,081
Nothing can be done..
wrestling tickles me..

159
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:41,481
Wrestling always tickled me..
I was helpless.

160
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:52,361
The honor he had was not enough for him
he also became a leader..

161
00:28:57,481 --> 00:29:00,941
Studies, wrestling, leadership...

162
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:04,781
I wasn't interested in any of it

163
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:06,821
He gave me a special nickname..

164
00:29:06,821 --> 00:29:07,121
What?

165
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:08,841
Zero.

166
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:16,951
What?
-I failed.

167
00:29:17,661 --> 00:29:20,341
I took 20 years to complete schooling.

168
00:29:20,501 --> 00:29:25,241
..from school to graduation,
I failed 10 times.

169
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:28,281
My father had given up on me.

170
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:31,161
What?
-I failed.

171
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:50,561
My friends advised me to cheat in exams.

172
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:53,021
But I am Bajarangbali's disciple..

173
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:56,081
I said I will fail but never cheat.

174
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,621
So I approached him the 11th time.

175
00:30:02,361 --> 00:30:03,761
Please come.

176
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:09,861
You must have broken
your own record in failing.

177
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:14,221
when you completed your schooling...

178
00:30:14,221 --> 00:30:19,141
Why did you have to honor
me anymore by failing 11 times.

179
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:26,301
I've accepted that
you're foolish.

180
00:30:26,481 --> 00:30:29,561
you're zero..
-But listen to me..

181
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:31,561
What should I listen? Tell me..

182
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:33,561
you've failed 10 times.

183
00:30:34,201 --> 00:30:36,101
..and failed me 20 times..

184
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,681
But listen to me..

185
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:41,161
What is left there to
listen, you tell me...

186
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,481
If you want to do
something for me..

187
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:48,821
Go away from here..

188
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:49,741
Delhi.

189
00:30:51,561 --> 00:30:54,161
I heard that there is scarcity of fools.

190
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:56,621
I've an old friend there
"Dayanand"

191
00:30:58,061 --> 00:30:59,261
He'll get you a job..

192
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:01,001
I passed the exams.

193
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,861
What did your father tell you?

194
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:06,861
He might have got shocked.

195
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:09,401
I knew he'll be in shock,

196
00:31:09,741 --> 00:31:12,941
but didn't know its intensity.

197
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:14,161
What happened?

198
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:25,341
Father I'm going to Delhi.

199
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:31,261
I went to Delhi to fulfill his last wish.

200
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,261
to Dayanad sir.

201
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:42,541
I don't have change.

202
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,541
Give 5/- from it, to that madam.

203
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:48,101
Madam he will pay you your 5/-

204
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:51,441
Greetings.

205
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:54,881
do you have 5/-,
so that I can give you 10/-

206
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:55,781
I don't.

207
00:31:58,741 --> 00:32:01,221
Now what?
-Its alright, you keep the money

208
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:03,921
How can I do that?
5/- belongs to you.

209
00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:07,261
Then give it to me.
-How can I?

210
00:32:07,381 --> 00:32:09,131

211
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:12,701
Look sir, you can keep the money.

212
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:15,241

213
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:16,341
Then give it to me.

214
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,831
It also belongs to me!

215
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:29,221

I don't want money.

219
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:35,541

Half belongs to me.

223
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:45,881
Ok..You see that vendor?

224
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,881
Go and get change from him.

225
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:51,321
Do you have change for 10?
-Yes

226
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:09,981
You?..

227
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:12,321
You..

228
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,041

229
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:16,051

230
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:18,681
Don't you understand..

231
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,091
You know him?

232
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,581
was in the bus..

233
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:23,881
This stalker followed me home..

234
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:26,421
No I'm not.
I didn't follow you..

235
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:29,861
I am from Pratapgarh to meet Dayanand sir.

236
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:34,181
Who are you..
-I'm Pawan  son Chataravedi.

237
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:35,501
Chatravedi's son?

238
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:36,821
Yes Bajarangi.

239
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:37,881
Get him down..

240
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:40,121
Have some more.
-No thanks..

241
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:43,361
Its nice and hot.. specialty of this area.

242
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:48,201
when we boil the potato.
we puts salt also.

243
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:51,641
That's why it tastes so good.
.you enjoy your food..

244
00:34:57,741 --> 00:34:58,961
Is someone cooking meat?

245
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:00,601
Neighbour next door.

246
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:01,841
They are Mohamaddan

247
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:03,101
starts early in the morning..

248
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,941
But in my house..

249
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:08,781
I have strictly decided..

250
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:12,401
not having tenants of other religions.

251
00:35:14,401 --> 00:35:17,441
What do you do for living?

252
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,421
I'm here to find job.

253
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,521
can't you employ him at your school..

254
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,201
You too..

255
00:35:24,991 --> 00:35:25,981
What?

256
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:28,241
Are you also still studying in school?

257
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:30,041
I don't study.
I teach.

258
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:32,561
Go tomorrow with Rasika..

259
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:34,181
You'll get some job.

260
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:48,781
Hail Bajaranbali.

261
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:01,021
Lots of monkeys here..

262
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:03,021
will you be bowing all day.

263
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:06,361
Take this..

264
00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:08,961
Place it under your bed
before sleep.

265
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:11,561
just like monkeys
we have lots of mosquitoes.

266
00:36:11,561 --> 00:36:12,481
One sec.

267
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:19,701
Give me your hand..
-Excuse me!

268
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:20,341
trust me.

269
00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:28,381
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

270
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:37,021
My name is not sister,
but Rasika.

271
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:30,701
Then?

272
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:37,141
Then one day Trivedi
and his son came.

273
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,601
Please come..

274
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:42,141
Be seated.

275
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:44,141
How are you  Proshotum?
-I am well.

276
00:40:47,241 --> 00:40:50,081
Pawan...Bring Rasika with you.

277
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:54,361
Rasika.

278
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,521
They are here.

279
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:08,301
If Bajarangbali appears unto you..

280
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:12,921
What will you ask him?

281
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:18,421
Do you know
what I will ask?

282
00:41:20,421 --> 00:41:22,161
Give me your hand.

283
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:25,161
Don't you trust me?

284
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:31,601
Where's Rasika?

285
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:32,781
She'll come.

286
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:36,561
I think she is too shy to come..

287
00:41:48,521 --> 00:41:50,121
You always used to say..

288
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:54,141
..that you see your dad in your bridegroom.

289
00:41:55,061 --> 00:41:58,071
i can't see it in anyone else but Pawan.

290
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:00,741
Rasika!

291
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:10,201
Forgive me..

292
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,681
We can't be relatives..

293
00:42:12,901 --> 00:42:14,381
Its my daughter's decision.

294
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:17,961
You should have told us before..

295
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:20,261
..instead of insulting us.

296
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:21,701
Let's go.

297
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:24,081
Who wants to stay here!

298
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:28,761
Sir..

299
00:42:31,861 --> 00:42:34,481
You can't be engaged with Rasika.

300
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:38,081
until you become
capable, for her.

301
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:43,621
To be capable, my
first condition is house.

302
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:47,501
which you'll buy
with your earned money

303
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:50,041
you got only 6 months,

304
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:52,681
or I'll find someone..

305
00:42:53,661 --> 00:42:54,681
..who is able.

306
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:07,441
I have not asked you this yet..

307
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:09,661
What's your age?

308
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:11,661
Wow Bajarangi bro.
.wow!

309
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:13,661
Congratulations...

310
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:21,481
In 2 or 3 months
I'll get new house..

311
00:43:21,481 --> 00:43:23,481
Absolutely..

312
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:34,221
Bombay......Agra?

313
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:15,481
How do you know
she's a Brahmin..

314
00:44:15,481 --> 00:44:17,701
..when she can't speak?

315
00:44:19,021 --> 00:44:20,401
she's fair..

316
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:22,401
..must be Brahmin.

317
00:44:23,781 --> 00:44:25,081
When will she leave?

318
00:44:26,941 --> 00:44:28,701
When we find her parents.

319
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:29,901
When will that be?

320
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,581
when Bajrangbali wills..

321
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,181
Have you ever
traveled by air?

322
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:41,141
I did once.

323
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,921
Do you know what
they say in plane?

324
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:55,801
First wear your oxygen mask,
and then help others.

325
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:02,421
When will you stop
your social work?

326
00:45:03,621 --> 00:45:05,361
Think about your life also.

327
00:45:06,341 --> 00:45:07,681
Work hard..

328
00:45:08,201 --> 00:45:09,441
Build a house..

329
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:12,111
If you can't..
..admit it now.

330
00:45:13,401 --> 00:45:14,901
So that you don't waste your time..

331
00:45:15,861 --> 00:45:16,901
..neither Rasika's.

332
00:45:51,941 --> 00:45:54,561
This will fit a 6 year old?

333
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:59,141
We couldn't find Munni's parents?

334
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:01,561
Will she live with us
after our marriage?

335
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:03,561
Why wouldn't we
find the parents?

336
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:04,701
What if not?

337
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:06,701
Who doesn't have parents?

338
00:46:07,421 --> 00:46:08,521
Orphans.

339
00:46:10,361 --> 00:46:12,201
Who is your favorite player?

340
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:13,221
Dhoni?

341
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:15,221
Virat Koli?

342
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:17,221
Yuvi?

343
00:46:18,561 --> 00:46:19,401
Shekar Dhavan?

344
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:21,401
Sewag?

345
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:24,241
Told you all the names!

346
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:27,101
You know nothing about cricket!

347
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:38,061
Munni's not an orphan.

348
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:41,541
Bajarangbali would
have told me if she was.

349
00:46:43,061 --> 00:46:43,801
Pawan..

350
00:46:44,861 --> 00:46:48,201
Did Bajarangbali tell you
that she has parents?

351
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:20,441
Munni!
Munni!

352
00:47:21,741 --> 00:47:26,761
What happened to Munni?
Where is she?

353
00:47:27,581 --> 00:47:29,601
I can't find her in the house.

354
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:30,541
Can't find her?

355
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:33,821
We were eating together..
did not see her after that.

356
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:35,421
I don't understand!

357
00:47:35,481 --> 00:47:39,081
Munni is not at here either.
-O God!

358
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:42,041
Munni!  Munni!

359
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:55,041
Pawan!

360
00:47:55,881 --> 00:47:56,601
Pawan!

361
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:45,561
Chicken barra, chicken mughlai,
chicken makhani, chicken hariyali..

362
00:48:45,561 --> 00:48:47,561
chicken lollipop, chicken kadai,
chicken tawa..

363
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:49,561
chicken tandoori, chicken masala,
chicken kolhapuri..

364
00:48:49,561 --> 00:48:51,841
chicken afghani, chicken kashmiri,
chicken hydrabadi..

365
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:54,101
chicken fried rice, chicken noodles,
chicken manchurian..

366
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:56,541
chicken 69, chicken kofta,
chicken korma..

367
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:58,861
chicken achari, chicken choudhary,
chicken biryani..
-Sir!

368
00:48:58,861 --> 00:49:00,861
chicken dry, chicken fry..
..Yes sir.

369
00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:02,781
Give that child
your best dish.

370
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:04,021
OK sir.

371
00:49:08,301 --> 00:49:10,911
She is white like milk,
iI thought she's Brahman.

372
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:16,741
She may be Kshatriya,

373
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:19,741
..they eat meat
and are fair..

374
00:49:21,181 --> 00:49:21,741
Yes!

375
00:49:22,061 --> 00:49:24,081
She's Kshatriya
like Lord Rama!

376
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,481
Why's Munni crying?

377
00:54:15,021 --> 00:54:16,951
Try these colorful bangles.

378
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:17,921
It's very nice.

379
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,741
Take it.

380
00:54:22,091 --> 00:54:23,501
My bangles?

381
00:54:23,501 --> 00:54:24,481
Excuse me sir..

382
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:26,481
Please pay for
my bangles.

383
00:54:26,921 --> 00:54:28,001
Please pay.

384
00:54:28,941 --> 00:54:29,741
Munni!

385
00:54:32,381 --> 00:54:33,901
Nn sir, we don't need it..

386
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:35,901
Forgive the child..
-Its alright.

387
00:54:36,071 --> 00:54:37,921
Stealing is bad..

388
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:40,161
Let's ask forgiveness from
Bajarangbali.

389
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:42,161
Bajarangbali..

390
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:44,161
You know that..

391
00:54:55,641 --> 00:54:59,621
You know that we went to
a non veg hotel..

392
00:54:59,621 --> 00:55:01,061
.because of Munni.

393
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:03,381
But i swear i didn't eat anything.

394
00:55:03,521 --> 00:55:04,601
Munni ate..

395
00:55:05,461 --> 00:55:05,861
Munni!

396
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:07,001
..pray.

397
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:09,101
Munni ate..

398
00:55:09,281 --> 00:55:10,781
Please forgive us..

399
00:55:10,781 --> 00:55:11,941
You know that..

400
00:55:12,561 --> 00:55:15,061
..I'm helpless for Munni.

401
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:15,881
What to do?

402
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:17,621
Bajarangbali..

403
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:19,541
..you gave me one hint..

404
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:21,721
..that she's a Kshatriya.

405
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:22,581
Isn't it?

406
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:23,721
Munni!

407
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:25,421
Munni!

408
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:28,181
Munni!
Munni!

409
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:33,081
Munni!..hey Munni!

410
00:55:34,121 --> 00:55:35,081
Oh no..

411
00:55:35,401 --> 00:55:36,781
no..no.. Munni!

412
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:38,801
Oh no..

413
00:55:41,261 --> 00:55:42,841
Please forgive Munni..

414
00:55:42,841 --> 00:55:43,601
She's just a child..

415
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:45,601
..she doesn't know
the difference..

416
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:52,921
Get in bro..

417
00:56:29,301 --> 00:56:30,341
Munni!

418
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:44,061
Are you crazy?

419
00:56:49,911 --> 00:56:50,931
What happened?

420
00:56:52,501 --> 00:56:53,701
Munni....She..

421
00:56:53,781 --> 00:56:54,321
Where's Munni?..

422
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:55,081
She..

423
00:56:55,561 --> 00:56:56,301
Who?

424
00:56:56,421 --> 00:56:57,841
She is that...
-She's what?

425
00:56:57,941 --> 00:56:59,401
Munni is Mohammedan.

426
00:56:59,601 --> 00:57:00,541
Munni?

427
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:02,661
Did you notice the way she
ate chicken last night?

428
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:04,221
..and here inside ..she..

429
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,721
..scarf around her..

430
00:57:05,721 --> 00:57:07,401
..and was reciting.

431
00:57:07,581 --> 00:57:08,321
Where is she now?

432
00:57:08,661 --> 00:57:09,991
What will your
dad say?

433
00:57:09,991 --> 00:57:11,221
Where is Munni?

434
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:12,341
She betrayed us.

435
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:13,621
She betrayed?!

436
00:57:13,941 --> 00:57:15,221
She's only 6 years old.

437
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:17,521
..Away from home
away from parents..

438
00:57:17,561 --> 00:57:18,861
..poor girl can't
even speak..

439
00:57:18,861 --> 00:57:19,881
What about your dad?

440
00:57:19,881 --> 00:57:21,061
She's Muslim.

441
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:22,721
Don't be stupid.

442
00:57:23,781 --> 00:57:25,201
Do you know why i love you,

443
00:57:25,201 --> 00:57:26,881
Because you have a
good heart.

444
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:29,461
all these caste, religion
are nonsense.

445
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:31,601
Don't waste your time
in trivial matters.

446
00:57:32,821 --> 00:57:36,061
I can't say this to father.
..but you can.

447
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:39,241
Lets go..
She's alone inside..

448
00:57:53,021 --> 00:57:54,141
Where is she?

449
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,141
He caught the ball!
He caught the ball!

450
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:14,101
C'mon India.
..Munni clap your hands..

451
00:59:14,101 --> 00:59:16,101
Awesome boys..
..awesome!

452
00:59:16,991 --> 00:59:21,341
Your father will kick
..Munni and me out of this house.

453
00:59:21,521 --> 00:59:23,361
Only if he finds out..

454
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:24,981
What?

455
00:59:25,621 --> 00:59:26,861
Who will tell him?

456
00:59:27,161 --> 00:59:27,881
I will.

457
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:30,061
Are you nuts?

458
00:59:34,481 --> 00:59:36,801
Oh no.. Afridi has come.

459
00:59:37,621 --> 00:59:38,901
Shit man!

460
00:59:41,801 --> 00:59:43,021
Have your read
Mahabharata?

461
00:59:45,761 --> 00:59:47,381
..you've watched it on TV..

462
00:59:50,641 --> 00:59:52,881
What does Lord Krishna
tell Arjun?

463
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:53,681
What?

464
00:59:54,101 --> 00:59:55,681
Your motive should be good.

465
00:59:55,681 --> 00:59:56,621
You have that..

466
00:59:56,881 --> 00:59:59,361
Your aim is to take
Munni to her home..

467
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:01,921
Tell father everything after that..

468
01:00:13,561 --> 01:00:16,081
Stop clapping for
the wrong team.

469
01:00:16,081 --> 01:00:18,421
Everybody shut up!
I am very tensed..

470
01:00:30,821 --> 01:00:33,001
What are you doinig?

471
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:35,041
This is enemy's team!

472
01:00:35,161 --> 01:00:36,991
What happened to her?

473
01:00:37,361 --> 01:00:38,721
I don't understand!

474
01:00:38,721 --> 01:00:40,421
What is Munni doing?

475
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:51,741
Why is she dancing?

476
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:53,581
What happened you?

477
01:01:02,061 --> 01:01:03,761
What is she doing?

478
01:01:08,741 --> 01:01:09,741
Pakistan?

479
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:20,681
You brought her saying
that she is Brahman..

480
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:25,241
You think you are the only..
one to take care of other people..

481
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:29,221
Why didn't others take
her from Kurukshetra..

482
01:01:29,221 --> 01:01:31,921
I didn't do anything..
she followed me..

483
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,741
You will hand her over to
Pakistani embassy tomorrow.

484
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:35,961
Father..

485
01:01:36,101 --> 01:01:40,401
Her country people have killed
our countrymen without mercy..

486
01:01:40,481 --> 01:01:42,041
She's not responsible for that.

487
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:42,621
I know.

488
01:01:42,921 --> 01:01:44,701
..but doesn't she belong there?

489
01:01:45,421 --> 01:01:46,621
I am not hard hearted..

490
01:01:46,961 --> 01:01:48,861
..but I cannot keep her..

491
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:50,861
..in this house anymore.

492
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:55,701
Make necessary
arrangements to send her.

493
01:01:56,341 --> 01:01:56,861
Soon.

494
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:42,621
Next..

495
01:02:46,981 --> 01:02:48,121
Visa application.
Passport.

496
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:49,601
I'm not going to
your country.

497
01:02:49,601 --> 01:02:50,981
I came to leave her.

498
01:02:50,981 --> 01:02:52,981
She's Pakistani.
send her home.

499
01:02:53,381 --> 01:02:54,641
What is your name?

500
01:02:56,821 --> 01:02:58,001
She can't speak..

501
01:02:58,701 --> 01:02:59,821
Where is her passport?

502
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,071
How'd I know.

503
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:04,201
The how do you know
she's Pakistani,

504
01:03:04,221 --> 01:03:05,821
When Pakistan won
the game yesterday..

505
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:07,361
..she started dancing.

506
01:03:08,301 --> 01:03:10,321
She also kissed your
flag on TV.

507
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:12,681
She became Pakistani
when she kissed the flag?

508
01:03:12,681 --> 01:03:13,641
How do you know her?

509
01:03:13,641 --> 01:03:14,991
Found her at Kurukshetra.

510
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:16,601
What she was doing there?

511
01:03:16,601 --> 01:03:17,991
How'd I know?

512
01:03:18,501 --> 01:03:20,321
Sorry can't help
without passport.

513
01:03:20,321 --> 01:03:21,481
Why not?

514
01:03:21,681 --> 01:03:23,881
I'm telling you she's Pakistani
send her home..

515
01:03:24,641 --> 01:03:25,941
Are you crazy?

516
01:03:25,941 --> 01:03:27,621
Do you have
any commonsense?!

517
01:03:27,621 --> 01:03:28,861
Now leave..

518
01:03:28,861 --> 01:03:30,661
I'm leaving her here.

519
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:32,161
I'm warning you..

520
01:03:32,161 --> 01:03:34,901
leave now or
I'll call security..

521
01:03:34,901 --> 01:03:36,521
And I'll call my people and..

522
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,081
..kick you out of India.

523
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:42,041
I'm an Indian,
just working for embassy.

524
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:44,041
Security!
Security!

525
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:44,861
Take em out.

526
01:04:43,701 --> 01:04:45,721
14 people were injured

527
01:04:45,721 --> 01:04:47,721
High Commissioner
Abdul Basheer.

528
01:04:47,721 --> 01:04:49,721
..said in his official statement..

529
01:04:49,721 --> 01:04:53,261
..that for security reasons..

530
01:04:53,261 --> 01:04:57,161
..all visa services will be
suspended for..

531
01:04:57,161 --> 01:04:58,961
one month.

532
01:04:59,361 --> 01:05:01,001
Bravo Bajrangi

533
01:05:02,201 --> 01:05:04,581
I just asked you to send girl home..

534
01:05:05,141 --> 01:05:07,021
..you shut down the embassy.

535
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:10,261
So Munni will be with us for a month?

536
01:05:10,521 --> 01:05:11,941
It will not happen.

537
01:05:14,741 --> 01:05:18,301
Govind has told me
about a travel agent..

538
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:20,921
They'll take care of it.

539
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:21,951
No sir..

540
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,321
We don't make Pakistani passport.

541
01:05:24,401 --> 01:05:25,051
Why?

542
01:05:25,861 --> 01:05:26,341
Why!

543
01:05:26,641 --> 01:05:28,061
Nobody ever needed.

544
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:30,061
People come for
American Passport.

545
01:05:30,081 --> 01:05:31,121
Canada's..

546
01:05:31,521 --> 01:05:33,281
..England,Germany
..Japan too

547
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:35,241
But when she's
from Pakistan..

548
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:37,241
..what will she
do in Germany?

549
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:41,341
You're right..

550
01:05:41,841 --> 01:05:44,941
Sorry we cannot make
Pakistani passport.

551
01:05:47,501 --> 01:05:48,421
Weird!

552
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:50,141
Let's go.

553
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:54,921
Sir..

554
01:05:58,641 --> 01:06:00,641
There's a way without passport.

555
01:06:00,901 --> 01:06:01,281
What?

556
01:06:02,361 --> 01:06:03,961
I know some people..

557
01:06:04,261 --> 01:06:05,541
who can help
cross border.

558
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:06,301
Really!

559
01:06:06,561 --> 01:06:07,161
Yes.

560
01:06:07,161 --> 01:06:09,161
I can request them..

561
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:13,941
Please ask them..

562
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:16,681
I'm in big trouble.

563
01:06:17,701 --> 01:06:17,981
OK.

564
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:21,001
I'll talk to them by evening..

565
01:06:21,001 --> 01:06:22,001

566
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:24,461
1.5 lakhs!

567
01:06:26,021 --> 01:06:28,441
4....4...4.....4

568
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:32,861
5...5...5...5...5....

569
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:35,601
25,000...25,000

570
01:06:35,601 --> 01:06:37,601
26...

571
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:39,601
27...28...

572
01:06:44,621 --> 01:06:45,881
What is this?

573
01:06:46,281 --> 01:06:47,881
Withdrew from bank..

574
01:06:47,881 --> 01:06:49,401
What have you done!

575
01:06:49,401 --> 01:06:50,901
this money..
-I know

576
01:06:51,141 --> 01:06:53,181
This money was for
our house deposit.

577
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:58,401
But right it is more
important to.

578
01:06:58,401 --> 01:07:00,041
..send Munni home.

579
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:01,201
No Rasika..

580
01:07:01,501 --> 01:07:04,081
You'll end up marrying someone else.

581
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:08,541
O simpleton..

582
01:07:09,891 --> 01:07:11,401
..don't you get it?

583
01:07:12,401 --> 01:07:19,361
No one can stop us from getting married.

584
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:25,841
Its my word.

585
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:33,921
How will you find her parents?

586
01:07:34,021 --> 01:07:36,321
Those agents have
many contacts.

587
01:07:40,381 --> 01:07:42,701
Don't you worry.

588
01:07:42,921 --> 01:07:44,701
I'll ask them to call you later.

589
01:07:46,161 --> 01:07:48,541
This is our phone no.

590
01:07:49,381 --> 01:07:51,301
When you find her parents..

591
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:53,141
Please ask them to call us.

592
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:53,781
Sure.

593
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:55,781
We need to leave..

594
01:07:57,301 --> 01:07:58,441
Let's go.

595
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:04,121
Why are you crying?

596
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:06,421
He'll take you to Pakistan.

597
01:08:07,701 --> 01:08:09,641
He'll take you to your mom.

598
01:08:10,621 --> 01:08:11,201
Let's go.

599
01:08:11,301 --> 01:08:12,801
You can't stay here.

600
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:14,801
..neither can I go there.

601
01:08:15,061 --> 01:08:15,801
Let's go dear.

602
01:08:15,981 --> 01:08:18,521
I've been having problems
since I met you.

603
01:08:19,141 --> 01:08:21,281
You finally got a
chance to go home..

604
01:08:21,661 --> 01:08:23,201
Please leave us.

605
01:08:23,201 --> 01:08:25,801
I beg you..
..leave us..

606
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:28,581
Go back home..
..I beg of you..

607
01:09:32,741 --> 01:09:33,321

608
01:09:34,141 --> 01:09:35,321
25/-  Sir.

609
01:11:05,281 --> 01:11:06,661
Hey hero..

610
01:11:07,661 --> 01:11:10,321
Have you seen a little girl
..her name is Munni.

611
01:11:10,321 --> 01:11:11,861
She just came here.
-Yes..here.

612
01:11:13,481 --> 01:11:14,501
I can be your...

613
01:11:14,501 --> 01:11:15,301
No Sister!

614
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,461
Sister!
How did I become your sister?!

615
01:11:18,461 --> 01:11:19,321
Munni!

616
01:11:20,981 --> 01:11:21,861
Are you crazy?

617
01:11:25,241 --> 01:11:27,701
Hey!  Not now..
..close the door.

618
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:33,501
Where are you going?
Somebody stop him.

619
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:42,761
Who's he?

620
01:12:41,401 --> 01:12:42,821
Get that girl!

621
01:13:55,281 --> 01:13:56,341
Let's talk in peace.

622
01:15:14,961 --> 01:15:15,421
What now?

623
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:19,581
I'll take Munni to her home.

624
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:23,141
Stop talking crazy..

625
01:15:23,741 --> 01:15:24,851
No Passport
nor Visa..

626
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:26,701
You are a stranger there..

627
01:15:27,161 --> 01:15:28,521
We'll find a way.

628
01:15:44,861 --> 01:15:46,101
I don't have a passport..

629
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,101
..nor visa..

630
01:15:48,381 --> 01:15:49,521
..a stranger.

631
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:51,381
but just like Bajarangbali..

632
01:15:52,201 --> 01:15:54,141
Lord Rama dwells
in my heart.

633
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:56,441
..and if Rama dwells
in your heart.

634
01:15:56,981 --> 01:15:59,381
..everything becomes possible.

635
01:17:30,401 --> 01:17:31,441
Stop right there.

636
01:17:32,761 --> 01:17:33,661
Who are you?

637
01:17:35,721 --> 01:17:36,421
-Who are you?

638
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:37,821
This is my area.

639
01:17:38,141 --> 01:17:39,821
I never said it
was mine.

640
01:17:40,851 --> 01:17:42,461
Are you gonna
cross the border.

641
01:17:46,841 --> 01:17:48,801
I charge 25,000..

642
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:50,221
You have..
you come..

643
01:17:50,261 --> 01:17:50,901
You don't..

644
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:52,661
Get lost.

645
01:17:52,841 --> 01:17:53,801
Let's go.

646
01:17:54,481 --> 01:17:55,141
Hey..

647
01:17:55,681 --> 01:17:57,601
Those fences are electrocuted.

648
01:17:58,261 --> 01:17:59,961
440 Volts!

649
01:18:00,281 --> 01:18:01,021
You touch..

650
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:03,101
..it will suck your blood dry.

651
01:18:04,481 --> 01:18:05,101
Listen..

652
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:07,361
Have a good look..

653
01:18:07,561 --> 01:18:08,801
Muhammad Ali Jinnah..

654
01:18:09,641 --> 01:18:10,801
Seen it before?

655
01:18:11,501 --> 01:18:12,741
Its Pakistani money..

656
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:15,681
Your money won't work.

657
01:18:16,161 --> 01:18:16,801
Let's go..

658
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:17,681
Listen..

659
01:18:18,701 --> 01:18:19,881
Don't you
understand..

660
01:18:20,641 --> 01:18:21,881
If you go this route..

661
01:18:22,321 --> 01:18:24,681
BSF will spot you within 2 km.

662
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:26,101
Hey..

663
01:18:27,281 --> 01:18:30,761
They will shoot first..
and then ask your dead self..

664
01:18:30,941 --> 01:18:32,501
.if are Indian or Pakistani.

665
01:18:32,501 --> 01:18:33,641
Hey listen.

666
01:18:33,871 --> 01:18:36,181
Crossing border is not like
a walk in the park.

667
01:18:36,221 --> 01:18:38,001
I can make it easy..

668
01:18:41,641 --> 01:18:42,841
Come with us..

669
01:18:43,301 --> 01:18:44,841
Its for her good.

670
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:46,601
It will only cost you
50,000/-

671
01:18:46,601 --> 01:18:47,951
Wasn't it
25,000/-?

672
01:18:48,221 --> 01:18:50,441
That's for one person.

673
01:18:50,941 --> 01:18:52,241
Why should she pay?

674
01:18:52,301 --> 01:18:53,601
She is going home.

675
01:18:53,961 --> 01:18:54,641
Going home?

676
01:18:56,421 --> 01:19:00,681
..and then I decided that
I'll take Munni to Pakistan

677
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:03,461
Amazing bro..
I knew that you are..

678
01:19:03,461 --> 01:19:05,461
..a very good man.

679
01:19:20,681 --> 01:19:21,261
Listen

680
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:24,221
..every 10 min, you will find..

681
01:19:24,221 --> 01:19:26,761
..Pakistani army across that fence..

682
01:19:26,891 --> 01:19:29,481
there are 4 tunnels
going under the fence.

683
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:31,201
..you have 10 min.

684
01:19:31,261 --> 01:19:34,221
..to get across it.

685
01:19:34,221 --> 01:19:36,221
..we have to get
behind..

686
01:19:36,221 --> 01:19:38,221
..that sand dune.

687
01:19:38,521 --> 01:19:39,181
that's it.

688
01:19:39,661 --> 01:19:40,781
you are in Pakistan.

689
01:20:10,561 --> 01:20:11,141
Come..

690
01:20:11,361 --> 01:20:12,581
I need permission.

691
01:20:13,961 --> 01:20:14,581
What?

692
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:15,961
What was that?

693
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:18,501
I'll take the soldiers'
permission and proceed.

694
01:20:18,741 --> 01:20:21,321
Now is not the
time for any pranks..

695
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:22,261
Lets go.

696
01:20:22,301 --> 01:20:23,661
I'm a disciple of
Bajarangbali.

697
01:20:23,661 --> 01:20:25,121
I'm an honest man.

698
01:20:25,121 --> 01:20:26,701
Are you nuts..

699
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:28,301
..they will shoot at us.

700
01:20:28,441 --> 01:20:30,011
I beg you to leave.

701
01:20:32,601 --> 01:20:34,321
Munni.. permission..

702
01:20:34,321 --> 01:20:36,161
We need permission.

703
01:20:36,161 --> 01:20:39,101
I knew you were crazy!

704
01:20:39,121 --> 01:20:40,381
you make
him understand.

705
01:20:40,381 --> 01:20:42,981
O jackass, the camels are near.

706
01:20:43,401 --> 01:20:44,981
Hurry..

707
01:20:45,381 --> 01:20:47,161
You will get killed.

708
01:20:48,521 --> 01:20:50,341
Munni we will get permission.

709
01:21:02,181 --> 01:21:02,881
Who's that?

710
01:21:04,281 --> 01:21:04,881
Hello!

711
01:21:06,281 --> 01:21:06,881
Hello!

712
01:21:16,521 --> 01:21:17,461
Are you an Indian?

713
01:21:18,701 --> 01:21:19,071
-Yes.

714
01:21:19,661 --> 01:21:20,841
..but Munni is Pakistani

715
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:22,861
She got lost..

716
01:21:23,701 --> 01:21:25,481
I'm here to take
her home.

717
01:21:26,921 --> 01:21:27,361
Sir..

718
01:21:28,381 --> 01:21:29,721
Never heard this
excuse before.

719
01:21:35,361 --> 01:21:36,501
Why didn't you leave?

720
01:21:36,501 --> 01:21:38,501
I'm a disciple of
Bajrangbali..

721
01:21:38,501 --> 01:21:40,091
I'm an honest man.

722
01:21:40,781 --> 01:21:42,581
I waited for your permission.

723
01:21:42,861 --> 01:21:44,031
This is Pakistani border..

724
01:21:44,641 --> 01:21:45,841
If you needed permission..

725
01:21:46,261 --> 01:21:47,561
why didn't you
get it from embassy.

726
01:21:47,681 --> 01:21:49,281
I went there..

727
01:21:49,281 --> 01:21:51,281
..at Delhi..
right Munni!

728
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:56,901
..but they kicked me out.

729
01:21:57,201 --> 01:21:58,181
How did you get here?

730
01:21:58,181 --> 01:21:59,261
Bu Ali brought us here.

731
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:00,241
Bu Ali!

732
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:01,481
He's an agent.

733
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:04,021
He says he has contacts
on both sides.

734
01:22:04,021 --> 01:22:05,321
What nonsense!

735
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:06,991
How did you
cross the fence?

736
01:22:06,991 --> 01:22:07,861
Through tunnel.

737
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:09,381
By crawling.

738
01:22:09,381 --> 01:22:10,891
Its a straight tunnel.

739
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:11,261
Tunnel!

740
01:22:12,021 --> 01:22:12,661
Where is it?

741
01:22:13,521 --> 01:22:14,661
You are standing on it.

742
01:22:15,981 --> 01:22:16,661
There!

743
01:22:22,981 --> 01:22:23,481
Sir!

744
01:22:24,321 --> 01:22:25,481
He's a spy.

745
01:22:26,361 --> 01:22:27,481
Shall I arrest him?

746
01:22:29,341 --> 01:22:29,621
No.

747
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:33,221
Listen.

748
01:22:33,911 --> 01:22:36,111
..send them back
through the tunnel.

749
01:22:37,641 --> 01:22:38,681
..fill it with sand.

750
01:22:43,521 --> 01:22:44,521
Go away from here..

751
01:22:44,941 --> 01:22:46,521
..or you will be shot.

752
01:23:09,161 --> 01:23:09,761
Hello!

753
01:23:23,101 --> 01:23:23,801
Hit him harder!

754
01:23:35,141 --> 01:23:35,741
Munni!

755
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:37,121
..don't worry.

756
01:23:37,441 --> 01:23:39,581
we are just having fun..

757
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:40,861
Having fun?

758
01:23:42,021 --> 01:23:42,861
No fun..

759
01:23:43,521 --> 01:23:44,541
I said it for her.

760
01:23:49,401 --> 01:23:50,101
Enough.

761
01:23:51,541 --> 01:23:51,941
Enough.

762
01:23:56,901 --> 01:23:58,181
How did you get
here again?

763
01:23:59,421 --> 01:24:00,521
There's a tunnel there.

764
01:24:02,441 --> 01:24:04,141
Who told you about
this tunnel?

765
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:05,201
Bu Ali.

766
01:24:05,201 --> 01:24:06,381
Bu Ali!

767
01:24:08,941 --> 01:24:10,521
i promised Bajarangbali..

768
01:24:10,521 --> 01:24:15,461
..that I will take no rest
until I find her parents.

769
01:24:15,581 --> 01:24:17,341
I'll give you rest.

770
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:17,841
Rafique!

771
01:24:19,481 --> 01:24:20,041
Stand back.

772
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:21,961
Listen..

773
01:24:23,821 --> 01:24:25,901
..even if you had
a passport or visa..

774
01:24:26,341 --> 01:24:28,841
..I still wouldn't not
let you to go.

775
01:24:32,261 --> 01:24:34,221
Go back,
right now.

776
01:24:35,681 --> 01:24:37,341
It's for your own good.

777
01:24:37,561 --> 01:24:38,161
Sir..

778
01:24:38,871 --> 01:24:40,461
I promise you that..

779
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:42,821
as soon as I find her parents..

780
01:24:43,441 --> 01:24:45,001
I'll return home.

781
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:51,841
Listen..

782
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:54,601
We will be here again..

783
01:24:55,581 --> 01:24:56,601
..in exactly 10 min.

784
01:24:57,401 --> 01:24:58,421
..and within 10 min..

785
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:00,221
you go this way..

786
01:25:00,741 --> 01:25:02,221
or that way..

787
01:25:02,601 --> 01:25:03,381
..we won't know.

788
01:25:03,381 --> 01:25:04,341
Sir but..

789
01:25:04,581 --> 01:25:05,101
But..

790
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:07,261
..but if you are seen again..

791
01:25:08,421 --> 01:25:10,001
..you will be shot.

792
01:25:12,421 --> 01:25:12,861
Lets go.

793
01:25:16,221 --> 01:25:18,501
And find out who Bhu Ali is!

794
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:49,581
Hello!

795
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:50,661
Sir..

796
01:25:51,141 --> 01:25:52,341
he is definitely crazy.

797
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:57,161
You don't care for yourself.

798
01:25:57,421 --> 01:25:58,961
but at least think of her..

799
01:25:58,961 --> 01:25:59,501
Sir..

800
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:03,921
I could have gone before you were back.

801
01:26:03,921 --> 01:26:05,741
..but I'm Bajarangbali's disciple...

802
01:26:05,741 --> 01:26:07,021
We know...
we know..

803
01:26:07,421 --> 01:26:09,121
..that you are honest..

804
01:26:09,221 --> 01:26:10,181
..and you've promised.

805
01:26:10,761 --> 01:26:12,041
..but you are stuck here.

806
01:26:13,161 --> 01:26:14,421
I also make you a promise.

807
01:26:15,201 --> 01:26:17,041
I'll return home...

808
01:26:17,041 --> 01:26:19,041
..when I find Munni's parents.

809
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:19,721
But sir..

810
01:26:20,561 --> 01:26:21,721
Please give me
permission.

811
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:23,761
I told you to go..
why didn't you?

812
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:26,141
That was no permission Sir.

813
01:26:27,201 --> 01:26:29,161
Its more like sneaking..

814
01:26:29,161 --> 01:26:30,441
Sir he is nuts.

815
01:26:39,101 --> 01:26:39,521
OK..

816
01:26:40,601 --> 01:26:41,081
Go..

817
01:26:42,721 --> 01:26:43,081
Sir!

818
01:26:48,121 --> 01:26:48,801
Shaii I?

819
01:26:49,801 --> 01:26:50,481
You can.

820
01:26:53,301 --> 01:26:54,101
Let's go.

821
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,901
If you are Bajrangbali's disciple...

822
01:27:02,761 --> 01:27:04,181
..you should definitely go back.

823
01:27:04,601 --> 01:27:06,321
Its my word.

824
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:13,519


825
01:27:23,561 --> 01:27:24,521
You're right..

826
01:27:25,901 --> 01:27:27,321
..he's crazy.

827
01:28:38,861 --> 01:28:39,401
Sir..

828
01:28:41,701 --> 01:28:42,341
Yes bro...

829
01:28:43,801 --> 01:28:44,881
Do you have Vegetarian?

830
01:28:44,881 --> 01:28:45,481
What?

831
01:28:46,861 --> 01:28:47,741
Vegetables.

832
01:28:49,481 --> 01:28:50,341
There are vegetables..

833
01:28:50,781 --> 01:28:52,481
there's capsicum, radish..

834
01:28:52,481 --> 01:28:54,181
...tomatoes, peas, even spinach..

835
01:28:54,341 --> 01:28:55,241
..filled with vegetables.

836
01:28:55,241 --> 01:28:56,001
Not that...

837
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:57,321
Only vegetables.

838
01:28:57,661 --> 01:28:58,221
What happened?

839
01:28:59,001 --> 01:29:00,101
Is she alright?

840
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:01,761
What happened dear?

841
01:29:02,281 --> 01:29:03,561
She's fine.

842
01:29:03,561 --> 01:29:04,661
Then are you sick?

843
01:29:04,921 --> 01:29:05,741
Not at all.

844
01:29:05,901 --> 01:29:07,161
Then why just vegetables?

845
01:29:11,621 --> 01:29:12,421
OK then..

846
01:29:12,421 --> 01:29:14,421
let her eat...
take mine away..

847
01:29:16,981 --> 01:29:18,011
I'll have tea and paratha.

848
01:29:22,281 --> 01:29:23,061
Hey Bilal..

849
01:29:23,421 --> 01:29:25,481
.. parathas were cold yesterday...

850
01:29:25,481 --> 01:29:27,481
..better don't do it again.

851
01:29:28,581 --> 01:29:29,481
Understood?

852
01:29:30,181 --> 01:29:32,541
Make it quick Munni..
we need to hurry...

853
01:29:43,721 --> 01:29:45,141
Are you full?

854
01:29:45,621 --> 01:29:48,301
We'll find your parents very soon.

855
01:29:48,701 --> 01:29:49,681
Stop right there!

856
01:29:53,141 --> 01:29:53,701
Stop.

857
01:29:55,081 --> 01:29:57,401
Why did the fatso follow us?

858
01:29:59,931 --> 01:30:00,581
My handcuffs?

859
01:30:00,721 --> 01:30:01,441
Handcuffs!

860
01:30:02,121 --> 01:30:03,441
What handcuffs?

861
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:05,421
You stole it from me

862
01:30:05,421 --> 01:30:07,071
Who'll steal handcuffs?

863
01:30:07,071 --> 01:30:09,001
Search his bag.

864
01:30:09,361 --> 01:30:09,971
Here..

865
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:12,361
Have a good look..

866
01:30:12,361 --> 01:30:13,761
Did you find any?

867
01:30:15,561 --> 01:30:17,061
Sir he doesn't have it.

868
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:18,141
Check her bag.

869
01:30:18,141 --> 01:30:20,261
Why would she need it?

870
01:30:21,821 --> 01:30:22,581
Show them.

871
01:30:23,281 --> 01:30:24,041
Give it dear..

872
01:30:26,041 --> 01:30:28,321
Here, have a good look.

873
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:30,321
Do a thorough search.

874
01:30:42,061 --> 01:30:43,161
What is your name?

875
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:44,361
Pawan.

876
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,361
Pawan!
Pawan what?

877
01:30:46,361 --> 01:30:47,721
Pawan Kumar Chatravedi.

878
01:30:48,061 --> 01:30:49,721
People call be Bajarangi.

879
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:51,721
I won't call you that.

880
01:30:51,721 --> 01:30:52,901
Are you an Indian?

881
01:30:53,801 --> 01:30:54,361
Yes.

882
01:30:54,821 --> 01:30:55,881
Your passport?

883
01:30:57,821 --> 01:30:59,001
I don't have passport.

884
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:18,181
Are you a spy?

885
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:19,401
No I'm not.

886
01:31:19,441 --> 01:31:21,361
.. and Munni is a Pakistani

887
01:31:21,821 --> 01:31:22,621
Pakistani..

888
01:31:22,621 --> 01:31:23,461
Is it?

889
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:25,781
She's Pakistani..

890
01:31:27,661 --> 01:31:28,961
What is that?

891
01:31:31,561 --> 01:31:34,321
So she's Pakistani!

892
01:31:36,501 --> 01:31:38,121
..And I'm Sachin Tendulkar.

893
01:31:38,741 --> 01:31:39,821
Arrest him.

894
01:31:40,101 --> 01:31:41,341
Take this scoundrel.

895
01:32:29,621 --> 01:32:31,681
Ahmad, you're wasting
you time..

896
01:32:31,681 --> 01:32:33,881
An Indian spy was caught.

897
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:34,801
Indian spy?

898
01:32:35,221 --> 01:32:35,801
Where?

899
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:36,961
At the Bilal's hotel.

900
01:32:36,961 --> 01:32:38,201
He's taken to
police station.

901
01:32:38,201 --> 01:32:40,051
Let's go..

902
01:32:40,381 --> 01:32:42,461
Pawan sudah menghubungimu?
- Belum.

903
01:32:43,681 --> 01:32:44,181
Dia pasti telpon.

904
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:47,761
Pasti dia sedang naik kereta.

905
01:32:48,341 --> 01:32:50,961
Kau tak menyuruhnya telpon setelah sampai Wagah?

906
01:32:51,181 --> 01:32:51,841
Aku sudah menyuruhnya.

907
01:32:52,801 --> 01:32:53,741
Pasti dia lupa.

908
01:32:54,101 --> 01:32:55,501
Kalau begitu kau saja yang telpon.

909
01:33:05,361 --> 01:33:08,701
I've reached to police station,
you come here soon.

910
01:33:14,141 --> 01:33:16,081
Tell us about your mission.

911
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:17,561
Mission?

912
01:33:17,881 --> 01:33:19,821
Yes I got the
permission.

913
01:33:19,821 --> 01:33:21,621
Tell us from the beginning.

914
01:33:21,621 --> 01:33:24,081
How did you enter Pakistan?

915
01:33:24,901 --> 01:33:26,141
From under the fence.

916
01:33:26,361 --> 01:33:29,001
You are paid how much
for this dangerous mission?

917
01:33:29,901 --> 01:33:30,241
Paid?

918
01:33:31,241 --> 01:33:32,241
Paid for what?

919
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:34,081
It was my choice.

920
01:33:34,081 --> 01:33:35,901
So you are a Patriot.

921
01:33:35,901 --> 01:33:36,421
What?

922
01:33:37,001 --> 01:33:39,201
Are you a Patriot?

923
01:33:39,501 --> 01:33:40,741
Without a doubt.

924
01:33:42,361 --> 01:33:45,011
What is the little girl's role
in this mission?

925
01:33:46,101 --> 01:33:47,011
She's the reason.

926
01:33:47,161 --> 01:33:49,011
That's enough..
..now leave..

927
01:33:50,821 --> 01:33:51,541
Come in the front.

928
01:33:53,821 --> 01:33:55,041
Hurry up.

929
01:33:55,481 --> 01:33:58,381
As you've seen in our exclusive footage..

930
01:33:59,361 --> 01:34:03,241
..an Indian spy and his partner in crime,
a 6 year old girl.

931
01:34:03,441 --> 01:34:05,881
They've just been arrested at Chawla.

932
01:34:05,881 --> 01:34:07,161
The girl's training..

933
01:34:07,261 --> 01:34:10,621
has kept her from saying anything.

934
01:34:10,621 --> 01:34:13,641
..sighing off with cameraman Kamil Yousef,
Chand Nawab Chawada..

935
01:34:13,961 --> 01:34:15,561
Once more..

936
01:34:15,641 --> 01:34:16,281
No, it was OK.

937
01:34:19,561 --> 01:34:20,261
Turn it off.

938
01:34:26,801 --> 01:34:28,541
Indian SIM card.

939
01:34:32,841 --> 01:34:33,521
What happened?

940
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:35,071
Phone's switched off.

941
01:34:35,261 --> 01:34:37,681
Sir I've taken a jaw dropping interview.

942
01:34:38,341 --> 01:34:39,701
About an Indian spy.

943
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:43,741
This news can make your channel
No. 1

944
01:34:45,661 --> 01:34:46,621
Sir its Chand Nawab.

945
01:34:46,661 --> 01:34:49,301
says he has interviewed
an Indian spy.

946
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:50,801
What nonsense..

947
01:34:50,801 --> 01:34:52,121
Tell him I'm not here.

948
01:34:53,141 --> 01:34:55,981
Samsher sir is not here.
-Oh no!

949
01:34:56,961 --> 01:34:58,221
Its a problem.

950
01:34:59,091 --> 01:35:02,421
Ok then can you please
ask him to call me urgently.

951
01:35:02,721 --> 01:35:04,381
I'll have the finished
report by then.

952
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:07,101
Hello!
Hello!

953
01:35:09,401 --> 01:35:11,061
What is your mission?

954
01:35:11,061 --> 01:35:12,661
I've told you many times..

955
01:35:12,661 --> 01:35:15,081
I'm here to take Munni
to her parents.

956
01:35:15,241 --> 01:35:17,821
Tell us the truth..

957
01:35:17,981 --> 01:35:19,161
i don't lie.

958
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:21,161
Where are you going?

959
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:22,541
What happened Munni?\

960
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:24,161
You know that place?

961
01:35:26,021 --> 01:35:26,961
You live there.

962
01:35:31,801 --> 01:35:33,021
This is her place..

963
01:35:33,021 --> 01:35:34,041
What's going on?

964
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:35,091
We found it..

965
01:35:35,341 --> 01:35:36,561
Munni's home.

966
01:35:36,561 --> 01:35:37,761
What is this drama?

967
01:35:37,961 --> 01:35:38,701
What is your name?

968
01:35:38,701 --> 01:35:40,001
She can't speak.

969
01:35:40,001 --> 01:35:40,841
Can't speak?

970
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:42,021
Why?

971
01:35:42,241 --> 01:35:43,761
Did she loose her tongue?

972
01:35:43,761 --> 01:35:44,641
Let me see.

973
01:35:45,781 --> 01:35:46,301
Show me.

974
01:35:47,081 --> 01:35:47,841
Open your mouth.

975
01:36:14,361 --> 01:36:15,981
According to our sources..

976
01:36:15,981 --> 01:36:19,481
..the Indian spy is under strict security.

977
01:36:19,481 --> 01:36:22,741
..its been said that he'll be
shifted to Islamabad.

978
01:36:22,741 --> 01:36:24,301
Why are you shifting?

979
01:36:24,421 --> 01:36:25,321
Look behind you.

980
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:26,481
Hurry up.

981
01:36:30,861 --> 01:36:33,301
Camera's with me..
..how will you shoot?

982
01:36:42,881 --> 01:36:43,861
He's taking the bus..

983
01:36:43,861 --> 01:36:45,861
Move faster..

984
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:51,461
I'll spy on this spy.

985
01:36:52,121 --> 01:36:54,641
My bike is faster..

986
01:36:58,541 --> 01:36:58,901
Ticket?

987
01:36:58,901 --> 01:37:00,901
That was a narrow escape.

988
01:37:05,021 --> 01:37:05,541
Hello.

989
01:37:05,541 --> 01:37:07,541
This is Chand Nawab
from Chawla.

990
01:37:08,601 --> 01:37:10,201
That Indian spy
is in the bus.

991
01:37:10,441 --> 01:37:11,501
Which bus?

992
01:37:11,501 --> 01:37:13,801
In this bus..
..he's right in front of me

993
01:37:13,801 --> 01:37:14,681
Hurry up sir.

994
01:37:14,681 --> 01:37:16,401
What bus is it idiot?

995
01:37:16,401 --> 01:37:17,941
Its on Alipur road.

996
01:37:20,461 --> 01:37:20,761
Ticket?

997
01:37:23,101 --> 01:37:24,641
Do you know this place?

998
01:37:24,641 --> 01:37:26,341
Is that a joke?

999
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,341
Where do you
want to go?

1000
01:37:28,341 --> 01:37:30,341
She's from Pakistan.

1001
01:37:30,341 --> 01:37:32,081
Don't know how
she reached India.

1002
01:37:32,081 --> 01:37:33,101
..all alone..

1003
01:37:33,101 --> 01:37:35,101
..her parents might
have lost her.

1004
01:37:35,101 --> 01:37:36,121
She can't speak.

1005
01:37:36,121 --> 01:37:38,121
..but recognizes this place.

1006
01:37:38,121 --> 01:37:41,041
I believe she is from
somewhere here.

1007
01:37:41,041 --> 01:37:42,641
Are you from India?

1008
01:37:49,121 --> 01:37:49,661
Yes.

1009
01:37:50,021 --> 01:37:50,521
How?

1010
01:37:58,041 --> 01:37:59,581
You know that border..

1011
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:02,131
..that fence.. crawled under it.

1012
01:38:02,131 --> 01:38:03,481
..but with permission.

1013
01:38:03,901 --> 01:38:06,741
You came a long way from India..

1014
01:38:07,541 --> 01:38:09,321
..just to look for her parents?!

1015
01:38:09,381 --> 01:38:10,701
Yes.. Why?

1016
01:38:11,241 --> 01:38:12,141
That's amazing..

1017
01:38:12,761 --> 01:38:15,041
If only we had more like you in
both our countries..

1018
01:38:15,041 --> 01:38:16,341
..would have been great.

1019
01:38:16,601 --> 01:38:17,981
Show me the picture.

1020
01:38:19,301 --> 01:38:20,901
Sir that..

1021
01:38:20,941 --> 01:38:22,901
Stop stammering..

1022
01:38:23,121 --> 01:38:24,101
They ran away..

1023
01:38:24,221 --> 01:38:24,921
What!

1024
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:28,661
Anybody recognize this place?

1025
01:38:29,081 --> 01:38:30,181
Have a good look..

1026
01:38:31,001 --> 01:38:31,681
Brother..

1027
01:38:32,521 --> 01:38:33,001
No.

1028
01:38:48,001 --> 01:38:48,581
There!

1029
01:38:48,961 --> 01:38:50,581
That should be it.. Hurry.

1030
01:38:51,501 --> 01:38:52,581
Over there..

1031
01:39:10,401 --> 01:39:11,341
What is it sir?

1032
01:39:11,341 --> 01:39:12,141
A man..

1033
01:39:12,141 --> 01:39:15,141
..they boarded this
bus with a little girl.

1034
01:39:15,221 --> 01:39:17,681
No sir..
there was none like that.

1035
01:39:17,741 --> 01:39:19,601
Has anyone of you..

1036
01:39:19,601 --> 01:39:21,421
seen a man
and a little girl.

1037
01:39:21,561 --> 01:39:24,201
No sir, we haven't seen them.

1038
01:39:24,201 --> 01:39:27,721
Sir that Chand Nawab told
me that its this bus.

1039
01:39:30,261 --> 01:39:30,741
Sir..

1040
01:39:30,941 --> 01:39:32,741
.she was doing this gesture..

1041
01:39:32,741 --> 01:39:34,741
showing that her home..

1042
01:39:34,741 --> 01:39:35,641
was in one of those pictures.

1043
01:39:35,641 --> 01:39:36,541
Where's that photo?

1044
01:39:37,441 --> 01:39:38,701
Its with them.

1045
01:39:40,221 --> 01:39:41,901
Check all the buses on highway.

1046
01:39:41,901 --> 01:39:42,961
Quick!

1047
01:40:11,961 --> 01:40:14,021
Either you are
very brave..

1048
01:40:15,241 --> 01:40:16,621
..or a big fool.

1049
01:40:17,941 --> 01:40:20,281
You entered Pakistan just like that..
no fear?

1050
01:40:21,021 --> 01:40:23,401
I was left with no choice.

1051
01:40:24,281 --> 01:40:27,721
Ok.. but how will you
find her parents?

1052
01:40:29,161 --> 01:40:30,641
Bajarangbali will help..

1053
01:40:30,641 --> 01:40:31,621
In Pakistan?

1054
01:40:42,801 --> 01:40:44,801
Tonight you'll be safer here.

1055
01:40:45,261 --> 01:40:45,901
..but..

1056
01:40:46,341 --> 01:40:48,401
..leave early in the morning.

1057
01:41:08,401 --> 01:41:09,581
What is this place?

1058
01:41:09,581 --> 01:41:10,221
Mosque.

1059
01:41:13,741 --> 01:41:16,401
Forgive me Bajarangbali.

1060
01:41:34,381 --> 01:41:35,501
What happened fellow?

1061
01:41:36,121 --> 01:41:37,201
Are you alright?

1062
01:41:37,381 --> 01:41:38,341
You look troubled.

1063
01:41:39,181 --> 01:41:40,101
What happened to me.

1064
01:41:41,661 --> 01:41:42,801
I'm perfectly alright.

1065
01:41:42,801 --> 01:41:44,801
Why stand here?
lets get inside.

1066
01:41:45,101 --> 01:41:46,481
Hey..listen..

1067
01:41:46,821 --> 01:41:48,921
Why were you absent?
Sorry sir..

1068
01:41:49,721 --> 01:41:51,281
Go.. I'll be there soon.

1069
01:41:51,881 --> 01:41:53,481
I can't go inside.

1070
01:41:53,481 --> 01:41:53,881
Why?

1071
01:41:54,781 --> 01:41:55,881
I'm not Mohammedan.

1072
01:41:59,441 --> 01:42:00,821
So what brother...

1073
01:42:01,321 --> 01:42:03,241
This place is open
for everyone.

1074
01:42:03,521 --> 01:42:06,541
..this is why we never
lock our mosque..

1075
01:42:07,001 --> 01:42:08,041
Come on..

1076
01:42:34,441 --> 01:42:36,401
So that's your problem.

1077
01:42:37,161 --> 01:42:39,401
I've never been to these places..

1078
01:42:39,981 --> 01:42:40,761
..but yes..

1079
01:42:40,761 --> 01:42:42,761
..we have some students who..

1080
01:42:43,121 --> 01:42:44,221
.may be from there.

1081
01:42:44,601 --> 01:42:45,941
Let me ask them.

1082
01:42:46,741 --> 01:42:47,941
Dear students..

1083
01:42:51,161 --> 01:42:52,681
Yes sir..

1084
01:42:55,541 --> 01:42:58,161
Have a good look
at this picture.

1085
01:42:58,701 --> 01:43:00,241
..and tell me where it is.

1086
01:43:00,601 --> 01:43:02,341
..and correct answer..

1087
01:43:02,341 --> 01:43:04,081
..will win you a price.

1088
01:43:04,081 --> 01:43:05,461
..a big one.

1089
01:43:09,161 --> 01:43:10,061
Stop!  Stop!

1090
01:43:11,841 --> 01:43:13,701
Take it back..
take it back.

1091
01:43:14,861 --> 01:43:16,421
He was with Chand Nawab.

1092
01:43:20,821 --> 01:43:21,721
You come here.

1093
01:43:35,261 --> 01:43:37,541
Sir this is Switzerland.

1094
01:43:40,481 --> 01:43:42,961
If you don't know then let others answer.

1095
01:43:42,961 --> 01:43:44,961
I'm telling you the truth.

1096
01:43:45,441 --> 01:43:46,721
This is Switzerland.

1097
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:48,721
Here its written in English.

1098
01:43:48,721 --> 01:43:49,981
Switzerland.

1099
01:43:54,201 --> 01:43:55,821
Munni?!

1100
01:43:56,641 --> 01:43:58,341
Are you from Switzerland.?

1101
01:44:08,721 --> 01:44:09,821
Stop!

1102
01:44:33,061 --> 01:44:36,261
You can find such
locations in Kashmir.

1103
01:44:36,381 --> 01:44:37,221
Kashmir?

1104
01:44:39,361 --> 01:44:40,521
Go back to India?

1105
01:44:42,221 --> 01:44:43,521
No Sir..

1106
01:44:43,801 --> 01:44:45,701
..we also have a small part.

1107
01:44:45,801 --> 01:44:46,261
What?

1108
01:44:46,701 --> 01:44:47,421
Kashmir.

1109
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:03,421
Stop there sir.

1110
01:45:03,421 --> 01:45:05,601
Please put your guns away.

1111
01:45:05,601 --> 01:45:08,441
Have you seen any strangers
Maulana Sahab?

1112
01:45:08,801 --> 01:45:11,581
There are no strangers
in God's house.

1113
01:45:11,581 --> 01:45:13,581
This stranger is dangerous...

1114
01:45:13,581 --> 01:45:15,141
An Indian spy.

1115
01:45:17,761 --> 01:45:19,821
Did you think that
he'll come here..

1116
01:45:19,821 --> 01:45:23,541
..to steal some
atom bomb formula?

1117
01:45:23,541 --> 01:45:27,541
Kindly inform us if you
see any strangers around.

1118
01:45:27,981 --> 01:45:28,641
-OK.

1119
01:45:36,261 --> 01:45:37,701
Its difficult to escape.

1120
01:45:39,381 --> 01:45:40,581
Is there a way?

1121
01:45:45,561 --> 01:45:46,301
There's a way.

1122
01:45:56,081 --> 01:45:59,281
What else will you make
me do Bajarangbali?

1123
01:45:59,281 --> 01:46:01,841
slept in Mosque, wore burqa..

1124
01:46:01,841 --> 01:46:03,301
and before
my circumcision..

1125
01:46:03,301 --> 01:46:05,941
..I beg you to find
her parents.

1126
01:46:16,701 --> 01:46:17,241
What!

1127
01:46:19,061 --> 01:46:20,121
He's in Pakistan!

1128
01:46:20,821 --> 01:46:21,741
You said..

1129
01:46:21,741 --> 01:46:24,081
..he'll leave her at Atari..

1130
01:46:24,701 --> 01:46:26,081
How can he go to Pakistan?

1131
01:46:26,221 --> 01:46:27,821
Who gave him passport, visa?

1132
01:46:27,961 --> 01:46:29,641
He went without that.

1133
01:46:30,381 --> 01:46:33,241
He went there without
Passport and Visa?!

1134
01:46:33,481 --> 01:46:35,821
You'll ruin your health...
..calm down.

1135
01:46:35,821 --> 01:46:39,141
You have no idea what
they will do to him.

1136
01:46:43,701 --> 01:46:45,281
One is hard enough..

1137
01:46:45,761 --> 01:46:48,761
..but Maulana Sahab has
two of them.

1138
01:47:03,161 --> 01:47:04,161
There will be police on road...

1139
01:47:04,481 --> 01:47:06,461
..you go through
those fields..

1140
01:47:06,461 --> 01:47:07,981
..you'll reach Khanewal.

1141
01:47:09,721 --> 01:47:10,301
Thank you.

1142
01:47:24,561 --> 01:47:26,181
You doing a
noble task.

1143
01:47:28,461 --> 01:47:32,261
I'll pray to Allah that
you find her parents.

1144
01:47:47,861 --> 01:47:49,021
How is it that you say?

1145
01:47:49,761 --> 01:47:50,761
Jai Sri Ram?

1146
01:47:52,261 --> 01:47:53,941
Jai Sri Ram.
-Yes Jai Sri Ram.

1147
01:47:55,161 --> 01:47:55,941
Jai Sri Ram.

1148
01:48:10,021 --> 01:48:11,201
Let's keep moving.

1149
01:48:12,961 --> 01:48:14,441
You are responsible for this.

1150
01:48:14,961 --> 01:48:16,991
..neither you had to send
Munni away..

1151
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:17,921
nor Pawan had
to go.

1152
01:48:18,261 --> 01:48:20,361
..you are the reason
he's in trouble.

1153
01:48:20,931 --> 01:48:22,041
Do something.

1154
01:48:22,501 --> 01:48:23,681
What can I do?

1155
01:48:24,621 --> 01:48:25,961
If you don't do
anything..

1156
01:48:26,181 --> 01:48:28,281
..i'll also go to Pakistan.

1157
01:48:28,421 --> 01:48:28,921
What!

1158
01:48:30,581 --> 01:48:31,301
O Lord!

1159
01:48:32,321 --> 01:48:33,461
Without any visa.

1160
01:48:37,781 --> 01:48:38,861
Can't do this anymore.

1161
01:48:38,861 --> 01:48:40,861
I can't breath nor walk.

1162
01:48:40,861 --> 01:48:43,941
One of us have to
dress like a wife.

1163
01:48:43,941 --> 01:48:45,941
Police are looking for
two men and a child.

1164
01:48:45,941 --> 01:48:46,541
You do it.

1165
01:48:47,661 --> 01:48:48,541
Really.

1166
01:48:48,661 --> 01:48:51,081
If someone asks your name..
you'll say..

1167
01:48:51,081 --> 01:48:53,081
"My name's Pawan Chatravedi.."

1168
01:48:53,081 --> 01:48:55,081
"..I'm from Delhi,
I worship Bajarangbali.."

1169
01:48:55,081 --> 01:48:57,081
"..I got permission to crawl
under the border fences."

1170
01:48:57,081 --> 01:48:58,521
Am I right Munni?

1171
01:48:59,381 --> 01:49:00,521
There are people..

1172
01:49:00,521 --> 01:49:02,521
..put down your veil.

1173
01:49:04,381 --> 01:49:05,881
..walk like a woman.

1174
01:49:19,121 --> 01:49:19,501
Munni..

1175
01:49:20,861 --> 01:49:21,701
Do me a favor..

1176
01:49:23,881 --> 01:49:24,981
She'll get caught!

1177
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:00,841
This is wrong.

1178
01:50:01,281 --> 01:50:03,161
Dishonesty is never rewarded.

1179
01:50:03,161 --> 01:50:03,881
Mark my words.

1180
01:50:04,341 --> 01:50:05,821
You spoke again woman!

1181
01:50:06,441 --> 01:50:07,421
Now shut it.

1182
01:50:14,961 --> 01:50:17,561
O this vehicle..

1183
01:50:18,981 --> 01:50:21,261
Sir, can I give you a hand?

1184
01:50:22,401 --> 01:50:23,041
Sure.

1185
01:50:28,181 --> 01:50:29,161
Kindly be seated..

1186
01:50:29,161 --> 01:50:31,161
Start it when I tell you.
-OK.

1187
01:50:41,481 --> 01:50:43,061
Did you find the fault?

1188
01:50:43,321 --> 01:50:45,621
It takes time to
find the illness.

1189
01:50:45,941 --> 01:50:48,001
Are you a mechanic
or a doctor?

1190
01:50:59,741 --> 01:51:00,561
Try it now.

1191
01:51:04,321 --> 01:51:05,481
What did you do?

1192
01:51:05,761 --> 01:51:06,701
Try it again.

1193
01:51:08,481 --> 01:51:09,461
That's what I did.

1194
01:51:10,121 --> 01:51:13,061
Wow you fixed it in a minute.

1195
01:51:13,221 --> 01:51:15,921
Its my duty to help travelers.

1196
01:51:15,921 --> 01:51:17,521
Thanks a lot.

1197
01:51:19,581 --> 01:51:22,141
Shall I drop you someplace?

1198
01:51:26,281 --> 01:51:28,541
What's your name dear?

1199
01:51:29,421 --> 01:51:31,581
She has been speechless
since birth.

1200
01:51:33,481 --> 01:51:35,961
Wonder how her mother feels!

1201
01:51:37,891 --> 01:51:39,541
What do doctors say
madam?

1202
01:51:39,541 --> 01:51:41,541
She is also speechless.

1203
01:51:41,741 --> 01:51:43,031
..same condition.

1204
01:51:43,031 --> 01:51:44,841
..its hereditary.

1205
01:51:46,501 --> 01:51:47,681
Its all fate.

1206
01:51:48,701 --> 01:51:50,141
True.

1207
01:51:53,021 --> 01:51:54,441
Are you going to Khanewal?

1208
01:51:54,901 --> 01:51:55,381
No.

1209
01:51:56,821 --> 01:52:00,361
But don't you worry..
..I'll leave you home..

1210
01:52:00,361 --> 01:52:02,981
You don't really have to
do that sir..

1211
01:52:03,781 --> 01:52:05,041
Just drop us at highway.

1212
01:52:05,041 --> 01:52:06,951
I will ask one of my..

1213
01:52:06,951 --> 01:52:09,161
..officers to drive you..

1214
01:52:09,161 --> 01:52:12,021
..to your home.

1215
01:52:12,021 --> 01:52:13,991
Officers!
what do you mean?

1216
01:52:14,201 --> 01:52:16,361
I'm the Superintend
of that area.

1217
01:52:17,401 --> 01:52:18,881
I was on leave today..

1218
01:52:19,681 --> 01:52:22,341
..going back to work because
of an emergency.

1219
01:52:22,341 --> 01:52:24,041
Emergency?

1220
01:52:24,321 --> 01:52:27,061
There's an Indian spy
around here..

1221
01:52:36,401 --> 01:52:38,141
He won't escape.

1222
01:52:38,661 --> 01:52:39,901
Where is Chand Nawab?

1223
01:52:40,861 --> 01:52:41,901
I don't know.

1224
01:52:41,901 --> 01:52:43,861
You don't!
-Please don't beat anymore

1225
01:52:43,861 --> 01:52:47,481
..I swear that I saw him last time..

1226
01:52:47,481 --> 01:52:50,081
..entering into bus.

1227
01:52:50,081 --> 01:52:52,321
I tried ... calling him.

1228
01:52:52,521 --> 01:52:54,441
..phone's switched off.

1229
01:52:58,461 --> 01:52:58,881
Now..

1230
01:52:59,301 --> 01:53:02,541
..try calling him before me.
..hurry up!

1231
01:53:10,781 --> 01:53:11,781
Switched off.

1232
01:53:21,061 --> 01:53:21,981
Come with me..

1233
01:53:21,981 --> 01:53:23,981
..this is my stop.

1234
01:53:24,641 --> 01:53:27,901
..my men will leave you home.

1235
01:53:31,021 --> 01:53:31,721
Please come.

1236
01:53:31,961 --> 01:53:34,041
Hey Hassan.
-Yes sir.

1237
01:53:34,041 --> 01:53:35,281
Come here..

1238
01:53:35,281 --> 01:53:37,561
..they are my special guest.

1239
01:53:37,881 --> 01:53:39,761
..an amazing mechanic too.

1240
01:53:39,961 --> 01:53:43,141
Leave them at their doorstep
at Khanewal.
-Yes sir

1241
01:53:43,141 --> 01:53:44,181
Please come.

1242
01:53:44,181 --> 01:53:44,981
Thank you sir.

1243
01:53:44,981 --> 01:53:48,021
Thank you..
..you did me a big favor.

1244
01:53:48,021 --> 01:53:49,721
You may have breakfast here.

1245
01:53:49,741 --> 01:53:51,241
No thank you..
..we'll leave.

1246
01:53:51,241 --> 01:53:52,541
Let's go.

1247
01:53:55,981 --> 01:53:57,041
Please sit.

1248
01:54:02,241 --> 01:54:02,861
Careful.

1249
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:12,361
See you.

1250
01:54:15,261 --> 01:54:17,401
Call him every hour.

1251
01:54:18,661 --> 01:54:20,261
He'll answer sometime.

1252
01:54:34,761 --> 01:54:36,001
Where's your house?

1253
01:54:36,001 --> 01:54:37,961
A little further.

1254
01:54:40,121 --> 01:54:41,201
Are you lost?

1255
01:54:43,221 --> 01:54:45,861
I haven't been here for
a long time..

1256
01:54:47,021 --> 01:54:49,801
..I eloped with her,
so her father is angry.

1257
01:54:52,321 --> 01:54:53,461
This is it.

1258
01:54:53,461 --> 01:54:54,301
Here?
-Yes.

1259
01:54:55,421 --> 01:54:57,741
Thank God we found your house.

1260
01:54:57,821 --> 01:54:59,381
You almost forgot your home..

1261
01:54:59,381 --> 01:55:01,141
It happens sometimes.

1262
01:55:01,141 --> 01:55:02,001
That's alright.

1263
01:55:02,381 --> 01:55:03,461
Get me Waqar.

1264
01:55:07,181 --> 01:55:07,601
Yes sir.

1265
01:55:08,101 --> 01:55:10,201
Any info about that spy?

1266
01:55:10,441 --> 01:55:12,361
His name is Pawan
alias Bajarangi.

1267
01:55:12,981 --> 01:55:14,581
He's with a local journalist..

1268
01:55:14,581 --> 01:55:15,481
Chand Nawab.

1269
01:55:15,961 --> 01:55:17,681
Let me leave you inside.

1270
01:55:17,681 --> 01:55:18,761
-Won't be necessary sir.

1271
01:55:18,761 --> 01:55:21,581
..thanks a lot for leaving us here.

1272
01:55:21,581 --> 01:55:23,581
Bye
-Take care.

1273
01:55:37,981 --> 01:55:39,681
Father-in-law..
How are you?

1274
01:55:39,681 --> 01:55:40,541
Who are you?

1275
01:55:40,541 --> 01:55:41,881
Forgive us..

1276
01:55:41,881 --> 01:55:43,881
..there's you daughter
and grand child.

1277
01:55:43,881 --> 01:55:45,681
Come here dear.

1278
01:55:46,441 --> 01:55:47,931
Who is she?

1279
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:48,861
What's she doing?

1280
01:55:48,861 --> 01:55:50,841
I don't have any daughter.

1281
01:55:50,901 --> 01:55:53,601
What's the use of getting
angry here..

1282
01:55:53,601 --> 01:55:55,681
..lets go inside.

1283
01:55:55,681 --> 01:55:58,321
Getting me involved
without any reason.

1284
01:55:58,321 --> 01:56:00,501
I know you are angry with me..

1285
01:56:00,501 --> 01:56:01,581
But!
-Hit me.

1286
01:56:01,581 --> 01:56:02,841
But I...

1287
01:56:02,841 --> 01:56:04,481
Sir.. Sir..

1288
01:56:04,481 --> 01:56:07,881
Let him go sir..
Sir...sir.

1289
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:14,401
Let's go inside.

1290
01:56:14,401 --> 01:56:15,361
Take it easy..

1291
01:56:24,261 --> 01:56:26,481
Good bye sir.
-Good bye.

1292
01:56:29,881 --> 01:56:31,111
..They also have
a little girl.

1293
01:56:31,481 --> 01:56:32,051
Girl?

1294
01:56:32,521 --> 01:56:33,261
How old?

1295
01:56:33,501 --> 01:56:34,961
Around 5 or 6 years old.

1296
01:56:35,361 --> 01:56:36,921
5 to 6 years old?

1297
01:56:36,921 --> 01:56:38,201
And she can't speak.

1298
01:56:38,201 --> 01:56:39,601
Speechless?

1299
01:56:39,601 --> 01:56:40,201
Yes sir.

1300
01:56:40,261 --> 01:56:42,961
Then why are you still
standing there?!

1301
01:56:43,541 --> 01:56:45,421
..Radio the message to Hassan
immediately.

1302
01:56:49,121 --> 01:56:49,661
Sir.

1303
01:56:49,781 --> 01:56:50,621
Who is that?

1304
01:56:50,621 --> 01:56:51,621
Open the door.

1305
01:56:51,741 --> 01:56:53,621
Are you gonna
break my door?

1306
01:56:54,321 --> 01:56:55,121
Huh!

1307
01:56:55,961 --> 01:56:56,541
You!

1308
01:56:56,601 --> 01:56:57,141
Where are they?

1309
01:56:57,561 --> 01:56:58,041
Who?

1310
01:56:58,041 --> 01:56:59,401
Your daughter and
son-in-law.

1311
01:56:59,521 --> 01:57:01,281
I've said this many times..

1312
01:57:01,281 --> 01:57:02,841
.have no daughter
or son-in-law.

1313
01:57:03,321 --> 01:57:06,701
Then where are they who claimed
to be your daughter and son-in-law?

1314
01:57:06,701 --> 01:57:07,681
How will I know?

1315
01:57:07,821 --> 01:57:10,441
They vanished as soon
as you left.

1316
02:00:38,781 --> 02:00:41,281
I was thinking of surrendering
to police.

1317
02:00:42,141 --> 02:00:43,461
..then the police will ..

1318
02:00:43,461 --> 02:00:44,881
..somehow find..

1319
02:00:44,881 --> 02:00:46,881
Munni's parents.

1320
02:00:46,971 --> 02:00:48,141
Don't even think about it.

1321
02:00:48,941 --> 02:00:52,641
You'll rot in jail and nobody
will know your whereabouts.

1322
02:00:52,911 --> 02:00:56,541
And do you think the police
will have your kind of passion?

1323
02:00:56,881 --> 02:00:59,221
..They might try for 2 or 3 days
..and then..

1324
02:00:59,221 --> 02:01:01,221
..Munni will be sent
to orphanage.

1325
02:01:01,851 --> 02:01:03,401
I will never allow this..

1326
02:01:03,401 --> 02:01:05,401
I've promised Bajarangbali..

1327
02:01:05,891 --> 02:01:07,821
..that I'll find her home.

1328
02:01:08,341 --> 02:01:09,841
..I am determined.

1329
02:01:17,501 --> 02:01:19,281
There might be a way..

1330
02:01:21,981 --> 02:01:22,581
Television.

1331
02:01:23,481 --> 02:01:24,021
TV?

1332
02:01:24,521 --> 02:01:25,681
Story has no punch.

1333
02:01:25,681 --> 02:01:26,801
It has sir..

1334
02:01:27,021 --> 02:01:28,261
An Indian..

1335
02:01:28,561 --> 02:01:31,061
..the way he helps a speechless
Pakistani child..

1336
02:01:31,361 --> 02:01:33,061
..its an awesome story sir.

1337
02:01:33,261 --> 02:01:35,561
Your spy's story...

1338
02:01:35,561 --> 02:01:37,561
had more punch..
..what happened to that..

1339
02:01:37,561 --> 02:01:39,021
..but he's not a spy.

1340
02:01:39,721 --> 02:01:41,161
..then there's nothing left.

1341
02:01:41,161 --> 02:01:42,221
Bye.

1342
02:01:42,741 --> 02:01:43,761
Hello!

1343
02:01:44,181 --> 02:01:44,761
Sir but...

1344
02:01:50,101 --> 02:01:52,261
What good is that
story to us?

1345
02:01:52,261 --> 02:01:52,841
Sir..

1346
02:01:53,041 --> 02:01:55,341
..a child will get her parents..

1347
02:01:55,341 --> 02:01:56,501
Get her parents!

1348
02:01:56,861 --> 02:01:57,301
Bro..

1349
02:01:57,801 --> 02:01:59,301
We sell news..alright..

1350
02:01:59,301 --> 02:02:01,301
..We are not
Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah.

1351
02:02:01,501 --> 02:02:03,301
..who unites separated people.

1352
02:02:04,181 --> 02:02:04,761
Bye.

1353
02:02:12,141 --> 02:02:14,281
Hate is easy to sell.

1354
02:02:15,461 --> 02:02:16,341
..but love..

1355
02:02:18,841 --> 02:02:20,921
What is
Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah.?

1356
02:02:22,541 --> 02:02:23,561
Its a famous shrine.

1357
02:02:24,381 --> 02:02:26,161
It is said that
wishes can come true.

1358
02:02:26,921 --> 02:02:28,281
Why didn't we go there yet?

1359
02:02:28,761 --> 02:02:29,241
Really..

1360
02:02:30,021 --> 02:02:32,301
..you get sick of
mosques and shrines..

1361
02:02:32,661 --> 02:02:34,301
Remember that mosque..

1362
02:02:34,301 --> 02:02:36,981
..you were running away
as if seen a ghost..

1363
02:02:45,701 --> 02:02:47,781
I can go to any shrine
for Munni's sake.

1364
02:02:49,221 --> 02:02:50,601
Lets travel tonight.

1365
02:02:53,181 --> 02:02:54,601
Its ringing!

1366
02:03:00,801 --> 02:03:01,161
Kamil!

1367
02:03:02,861 --> 02:03:04,981
I was worried.. thank God..
Where are you?

1368
02:03:05,561 --> 02:03:06,741
Is someone near you?

1369
02:03:07,621 --> 02:03:09,181
Nobody is around me.

1370
02:03:09,221 --> 02:03:10,481
Are you with the spy?

1371
02:03:11,161 --> 02:03:13,381
He's not a spy.
He's a noble man.

1372
02:03:13,641 --> 02:03:14,721
What do you mean?

1373
02:03:15,401 --> 02:03:17,901
He's here to unite the lost girl.

1374
02:03:18,901 --> 02:03:20,361
Where are you now?

1375
02:03:20,701 --> 02:03:22,361
We are leaving for
Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah.

1376
02:03:24,081 --> 02:03:26,121
Its said that it unites
separated people.

1377
02:03:26,781 --> 02:03:29,031
Take care of yourself.

1378
02:04:05,861 --> 02:04:07,721
I'll see you later..

1379
02:04:08,681 --> 02:04:10,101
Where are you going?

1380
02:05:17,101 --> 02:05:18,681
I'm Chand Nawab..

1381
02:05:18,681 --> 02:05:23,061
Today I am going to tell you about
a man who came here without any visa..

1382
02:05:23,061 --> 02:05:26,501
..but entered our land at night by crawling
under the border fences.

1383
02:05:26,501 --> 02:05:27,681
..His name is Bajarangi.

1384
02:05:47,141 --> 02:05:51,021
Just like the police, I too believed..
that he's a spy..

1385
02:05:51,021 --> 02:05:53,021
..but now I know..

1386
02:05:53,021 --> 02:05:55,021
..that he's no spy..

1387
02:05:55,841 --> 02:05:56,961
..then what is he?

1388
02:05:56,961 --> 02:05:59,301
Why is he in our land?
What does he want?

1389
02:05:59,661 --> 02:06:02,301
He's a common man just
like you and me..

1390
02:06:02,301 --> 02:06:05,221
And he's here because of love.

1391
02:06:06,301 --> 02:06:09,241
Compassion for a 6 year old speechless girl.

1392
02:06:09,701 --> 02:06:12,421
..who lost her parents in India.

1393
02:06:12,421 --> 02:06:14,421
When all the door
were closed...

1394
02:06:14,421 --> 02:06:18,921
..he had to take this route
to find her parents.

1395
02:06:38,461 --> 02:06:40,981
All the TV channels refused
to air this story..

1396
02:06:40,981 --> 02:06:43,381
..calling is bogus and
waste of time.

1397
02:06:43,381 --> 02:06:46,281
..and that nobody
will be interested.

1398
02:06:47,281 --> 02:06:51,201
So I plead you to help Bajarangi
..find her parents..

1399
02:06:51,581 --> 02:06:54,321
..and also for his
safe journey back home.

1400
02:09:53,921 --> 02:09:54,781
Ring him.

1401
02:09:55,941 --> 02:09:57,681
He's here with the police...

1402
02:10:03,241 --> 02:10:04,241
They are near.

1403
02:10:05,541 --> 02:10:06,281
He's not answering.

1404
02:10:06,861 --> 02:10:08,081
Answer the phone.

1405
02:10:08,981 --> 02:10:09,341
What!

1406
02:10:09,341 --> 02:10:11,141
Answer the phone.
-Why?

1407
02:10:11,141 --> 02:10:12,081
There's a plan.

1408
02:10:12,971 --> 02:10:14,861
Hello brother
Chand Nawab!

1409
02:10:14,911 --> 02:10:15,901
Is everything alright?

1410
02:10:16,261 --> 02:10:17,361
Everything is fine.

1411
02:10:17,361 --> 02:10:19,361
Did you go to the shrine?

1412
02:10:19,401 --> 02:10:21,981
Yes we went there last night.

1413
02:10:22,301 --> 02:10:24,461
Where are you now?

1414
02:10:24,461 --> 02:10:25,081
Now?

1415
02:10:26,021 --> 02:10:28,341
We are going to Gojra.

1416
02:10:30,021 --> 02:10:31,661
You are going to Gojra.

1417
02:10:31,741 --> 02:10:32,781
OK..

1418
02:10:32,921 --> 02:10:34,721
OK I'll call you later.

1419
02:10:35,741 --> 02:10:36,721
Take care.

1420
02:10:37,761 --> 02:10:38,401
Wow bro..

1421
02:10:38,781 --> 02:10:40,041
You finally lied..

1422
02:10:40,501 --> 02:10:41,341
When did I lie?

1423
02:10:41,701 --> 02:10:42,641
You made me lie!

1424
02:10:43,401 --> 02:10:44,031
So what..

1425
02:10:44,461 --> 02:10:46,741
Haven't you watched Mahabharata on TV?

1426
02:10:47,481 --> 02:10:48,221
Is it a movie?

1427
02:10:52,941 --> 02:10:53,861
Action movie?

1428
02:10:55,121 --> 02:10:58,421
If you recognize this
child or know anything..

1429
02:10:59,241 --> 02:11:01,841
..then kindly enter your phone no.
in this website..

1430
02:11:01,841 --> 02:11:03,241
..we'll contact you.

1431
02:11:03,241 --> 02:11:05,561
I've added your clips
in this video.

1432
02:11:06,621 --> 02:11:08,481
Internet is very powerful.

1433
02:11:08,921 --> 02:11:10,481
Any numbers yet?

1434
02:11:11,681 --> 02:11:13,001
Only fewer views yet..

1435
02:11:13,001 --> 02:11:14,321
will increase over time.

1436
02:11:16,801 --> 02:11:18,081
Do you wanna watch?

1437
02:11:18,581 --> 02:11:18,981
Come.

1438
02:11:18,981 --> 02:11:20,981
I'll rewind it.

1439
02:11:36,001 --> 02:11:36,801
What is it Munni?

1440
02:11:36,801 --> 02:11:38,121
What did you see?

1441
02:11:38,541 --> 02:11:39,561
Rewind it.

1442
02:11:39,561 --> 02:11:40,761
What is it Munni?

1443
02:11:48,221 --> 02:11:48,881
Pause.

1444
02:11:50,881 --> 02:11:52,141
Do you know her?

1445
02:11:53,881 --> 02:11:54,961
Your mom?

1446
02:11:57,321 --> 02:11:58,161
Rewind it.

1447
02:12:01,581 --> 02:12:02,941
She got down from that bus.

1448
02:12:03,581 --> 02:12:04,701
What would be the time?

1449
02:12:05,281 --> 02:12:06,701
Around 8:30.

1450
02:12:07,501 --> 02:12:09,981
Find out where this
8:30 bus comes from.

1451
02:12:17,781 --> 02:12:18,401
Its here.

1452
02:12:26,521 --> 02:12:26,941
Sir..

1453
02:12:27,201 --> 02:12:28,561
Where's this bus coming from?

1454
02:12:28,561 --> 02:12:29,841
Where do you wanna go?

1455
02:12:29,841 --> 02:12:31,441
I wanna know where's its from.

1456
02:12:31,441 --> 02:12:32,841
You're strange.

1457
02:12:32,841 --> 02:12:35,321
Just tell us where its c
oming from.

1458
02:12:36,541 --> 02:12:37,821
From Jahanabad..

1459
02:12:38,201 --> 02:12:40,221
Is that your village Munni?

1460
02:12:44,891 --> 02:12:46,701
Usain comes before that.

1461
02:12:47,501 --> 02:12:48,221
Usain?

1462
02:12:49,991 --> 02:12:52,961
Karimabad comes before that.

1463
02:12:53,661 --> 02:12:54,361
Karimabad?

1464
02:12:56,081 --> 02:12:57,261
..and then?

1465
02:12:57,601 --> 02:12:59,261
Sultanpur.

1466
02:13:01,161 --> 02:13:02,381
Sultanpur?

1467
02:13:04,941 --> 02:13:06,021
Munni!

1468
02:13:06,201 --> 02:13:08,911
..so you are from Sultanpur.

1469
02:13:34,881 --> 02:13:35,281
Sir!

1470
02:13:38,961 --> 02:13:40,001
Check out this video.

1471
02:13:41,121 --> 02:13:43,741
Chand Nawab uploaded
this yesterday.

1472
02:13:46,241 --> 02:13:47,481
Its outside the shrine.

1473
02:13:47,481 --> 02:13:48,781
They were never at Gojra.

1474
02:13:48,781 --> 02:13:51,201
..we've searched everywhere.

1475
02:13:51,401 --> 02:13:52,401
..no sign of them.

1476
02:13:53,361 --> 02:13:53,761
Listen..

1477
02:13:54,121 --> 02:13:56,961
Send pictures to all
the police stations...

1478
02:13:56,991 --> 02:14:00,581
..and check every trucks, buses and
other vehicles immediately.

1479
02:14:08,981 --> 02:14:10,541
Did you see your village?

1480
02:14:16,961 --> 02:14:17,481
Bro!

1481
02:14:24,781 --> 02:14:26,081
Listen to me
very carefully.

1482
02:14:34,701 --> 02:14:35,161
Come forward.

1483
02:14:42,401 --> 02:14:43,241
Show me your face.

1484
02:14:44,081 --> 02:14:45,841
Take it off.

1485
02:14:53,101 --> 02:14:54,281
He's the one..

1486
02:18:52,361 --> 02:18:53,921
I'm Chand Nawab..

1487

1494
02:19:10,981 --> 02:19:13,601
Why is he in our land?
What does he want?

1495

02:19:57,321 --> 02:19:57,961
Kashmir.

1510
02:20:20,861 --> 02:20:25,701
I don't care what the media thinks..

1511
02:20:26,321 --> 02:20:28,381
For us, he is an
Indian spy.

1512
02:20:28,721 --> 02:20:29,401
But sir..

1513
02:20:29,601 --> 02:20:31,661
..we've confirmed from her parents..

1514
02:20:31,661 --> 02:20:32,721
..that she was lost in India.

1515
02:20:32,981 --> 02:20:36,441
Pakistani people has
sympathy for him.

1516
02:20:38,221 --> 02:20:39,041
Then..

1517
02:20:40,041 --> 02:20:42,281
..tell the media..

1518
02:20:42,921 --> 02:20:44,541
..the he has confessed ..

1519
02:20:44,541 --> 02:20:46,541
..he's a spy.

1520
02:20:47,401 --> 02:20:48,541
..then there won't be..

1521
02:20:48,541 --> 02:20:50,541
..any sympathy.

1522
02:20:56,441 --> 02:21:00,781
Ask your men to get
information from India.

1523
02:21:04,001 --> 02:21:06,521
Yes she couldn't speak.

1524
02:21:07,101 --> 02:21:08,521
I remember it well.

1525
02:21:08,801 --> 02:21:11,181
He brought her here.

1526
02:21:11,181 --> 02:21:12,261
..said she was lost.

1527
02:21:19,341 --> 02:21:20,261
Stop it!

1528
02:21:22,021 --> 02:21:22,521
Hello.

1529
02:21:22,521 --> 02:21:25,481
Sir we have verified
his story from..

1530
02:21:25,481 --> 02:21:27,481
..Kurukshetra police station
and Delhi High Commission.

1531
02:21:27,481 --> 02:21:29,321
He has taken
that child there..

1532
02:21:29,861 --> 02:21:31,321
He is no spy.

1533
02:21:31,561 --> 02:21:32,861
Mr. Hamid Khan..

1534
02:21:32,941 --> 02:21:35,441
You cannot decide
who's what...

1535
02:21:35,441 --> 02:21:36,581
..that's my job.

1536
02:21:36,581 --> 02:21:38,581
..your job is to make
him confess..

1537
02:21:38,581 --> 02:21:39,761
..that he's a spy.

1538
02:21:39,761 --> 02:21:40,461
But sir..

1539
02:21:40,461 --> 02:21:41,021
And yes..

1540
02:21:41,621 --> 02:21:44,481
..if you can't follow orders..

1541
02:21:44,481 --> 02:21:46,821
..then I can send someone
more able..

1542
02:21:46,821 --> 02:21:49,401
..and then you'll be
on long leave.

1543
02:22:01,141 --> 02:22:04,361
He wants his confession
at any cost.

1544
02:22:07,801 --> 02:22:12,921
I've worked all my life
protecting and honoring this country

1545
02:22:14,921 --> 02:22:15,481
..but..

1546
02:22:16,261 --> 02:22:16,981
..if..

1547
02:22:18,101 --> 02:22:18,981
..this man..

1548
02:22:22,721 --> 02:22:28,041
..spends all his life behind
bars in Pakistan..

1549
02:22:29,241 --> 02:22:31,681
..it will be against our
country's honor.

1550
02:22:37,801 --> 02:22:39,381
I'll not let that happen.

1551
02:22:46,401 --> 02:22:47,121
Hello.

1552
02:22:47,721 --> 02:22:48,441
Who is this?

1553
02:22:50,181 --> 02:22:50,881
Hamid sir!

1554
02:22:52,861 --> 02:22:53,261
Yes sir?

1555
02:22:54,541 --> 02:22:54,921
Yes

1556
02:23:01,621 --> 02:23:02,581
Thank you.

1557
02:23:03,181 --> 02:23:04,261
That's good sir.

1558
02:23:06,561 --> 02:23:07,241
Thanks a lot.

1559
02:23:07,841 --> 02:23:10,171
Get the camera..

1560
02:23:16,341 --> 02:23:18,581
Sir there's a new video
on the Bajarangi story.

1561
02:23:22,021 --> 02:23:24,201
It will go in the bulletin.

1562
02:23:24,681 --> 02:23:26,201
Rasika sister!

1563
02:23:27,581 --> 02:23:29,881
Look Bajrangi is on TV.

1564
02:23:30,061 --> 02:23:33,051
Tody Pakistani reporter
Chand Nawab has..

1565
02:23:33,051 --> 02:23:34,721
..posted a new video today

1566
02:23:34,721 --> 02:23:36,201
..on Bajarangi Bhaijan.

1567
02:23:36,381 --> 02:23:38,281
..who is locked
in Pakistani jail.

1568
02:23:44,111 --> 02:23:47,941
Pawan Chatravedi.
aka Bajrangi Bhaijan..

1569
02:23:48,111 --> 02:23:54,921
is an Indian who risked his life to
find a Pakistani girl's parents.

1570
02:23:55,521 --> 02:23:57,681
Run this story
immediately.

1571
02:23:57,681 --> 02:23:59,141
..why did he do this?

1572
02:23:59,141 --> 02:24:01,141
...for money?
for fame?

1573
02:24:01,141 --> 02:24:02,191
..for riches?

1574
02:24:02,321 --> 02:24:05,561
..No.
He did this out of good heart.

1575
02:24:06,121 --> 02:24:13,101
..he did this for a Pakistani girl
in the name of love.

1576
02:24:14,741 --> 02:24:15,441
..unfortunately..

1577
02:24:15,441 --> 02:24:19,161
..he got trapped because of
countries hatred towards each other.

1578
02:24:19,761 --> 02:24:24,661
..this hatred has caused Bajangi
to hide in Pakistan.

1579
02:24:25,581 --> 02:24:27,261
..Please end this hatred.

1580
02:24:28,091 --> 02:24:31,541
..and we have to do this..
..the millions of both the nations.

1581
02:24:32,091 --> 02:24:34,921
..who wants to raise their
children in love and not hate.

1582
02:24:35,191 --> 02:24:38,721
So lets us all end this
hatred together.

1583
02:24:39,621 --> 02:24:43,201
Let us all go to
Narowar check post..

1584
02:24:43,201 --> 02:24:44,141
What nonsense!

1585
02:24:44,201 --> 02:24:45,501

..nobody stops our Bajarangi Bhaijan from
crossing the border..

1588
02:24:53,661 --> 02:24:55,321
..or going back home.

1592
02:26:40,341 --> 02:26:43,141
I have fulfilled my promise.

1593
02:26:43,861 --> 02:26:44,661
Munni is..

1594
02:26:44,921 --> 02:26:45,881
Shahida..

1595
02:26:46,121 --> 02:26:48,021
Shahida is with her parents.

1596
02:26:48,941 --> 02:26:50,241
Shahida!

1597

Come back soon.

1600
02:27:13,121 --> 02:27:14,721
..not under the fence..

1601
02:27:14,721 --> 02:27:16,721
..but with a visa.

1602
02:27:17,921 --> 02:27:18,721
I promise.

1603
02:27:49,901 --> 02:27:50,621
Please stop.

1604
02:27:51,881 --> 02:27:52,701
Open the gate.

1605
02:27:52,921 --> 02:27:55,541
Sir we are given
orders to arrest you.

1606
02:27:55,681 --> 02:27:58,501
If this man risks his life..

1607
02:27:58,501 --> 02:28:00,501
..to find your lost daughter..

1608
02:28:01,131 --> 02:28:02,931
..would you still not open the gate?

1609
02:28:02,931 --> 02:28:04,201
You know that..

1610
02:28:04,201 --> 02:28:05,441
I can't open this gate..

1611
02:28:11,141 --> 02:28:12,281
Can you hear them!

1612
02:28:13,561 --> 02:28:15,581
..voice of the common people
of Pakistan.

1613
02:28:15,641 --> 02:28:18,521
If they can tell the difference
between right and wrong...

1614
02:28:18,521 --> 02:28:20,521
..then why can't you?
You're a soldier!

1615
02:28:21,321 --> 02:28:23,261
You should know better.

1616
02:28:23,581 --> 02:28:25,001
Just following orders
sir.

1617
02:28:26,021 --> 02:28:28,081
..to stop him from
crossing our borders.

1618
02:28:29,841 --> 02:28:30,481
..but..

1619
02:28:34,421 --> 02:28:36,101
..we are few in number..

1620
02:28:38,541 --> 02:28:40,021
...and thousands of people present.

1621
02:28:44,621 --> 02:28:45,221
Did you get it?

1622
02:30:13,621 --> 02:30:14,221
Shahida!
