1
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you want to have a beer
while you're waiting?

2
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,510
BARTENDER:
Can you hear me, mister?.

3
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,480
l'll take the bottle.

4
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,870
Howdy, boys. What can l do you for?.

5
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,200
- Brewskies.
- You got it.

6
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,340
There you go.

7
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,960
50 now, 50 more when you're done.

8
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,840
- How many?.
- Just one.

9
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,810
- Another cop?
- No, he's a friend of yours.

10
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,770
You're gonna like this job.

11
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,820
He was in my brother's gang.
First he dropped a dime on him...

12
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,080
..then he ratted him to the cop
that blew him away.

13
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,840
- l'll go in. You want a coke?
- Yeah, diet.

14
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,190
We're on Simmons Road
off Route 14.

15
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,160
l need wants and warrants
on motorcycle registrations.

16
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:32,250
First: California. 6D84S9.
Second plate...

17
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:41,880
- Tom.
- How're you doing? Nice to see you.

18
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,730
Willie Hickock, right here.

19
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,820
Cherry Ganz, officer.

20
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,160
Do l know you guys?

21
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,640
- Who are you calling, friend?
- l wasn't calling anybody.

22
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,360
- Somehow l don't believe you.
- Oh, God, no!

23
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,850
$100,000. 50,000 now.
lceman is a generous guy.

24
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,190
l don't like hundreds.
What kind of shit is this?

25
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,200
This is the guy. The balance is due
when he's dusted. We want him dead.

26
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,290
Yeah, whatever. No problem.

27
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,470
Police! Freeze!

28
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,060
Move apart. l don't want anybody
to get hurt here, so move slow.

29
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,970
Shit!

30
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,060
Here come the cops,
get the hell out of here!

31
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:16,640
- You really toasted that guy.
- l just shot him. l didn't toast him!

32
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,180
Calm down. We'll find the gun.
We've got to do this together.

33
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,270
l checked the guy's locker.
He works at the track.

34
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,110
50 bucks in his wallet,
sunglasses and some keys.

35
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,320
- We still haven't found his gun.
- Shit!

36
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,160
Cates took down one of the locals.
A slug hit one of the gas pumps.

37
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,580
He burned the bad guy to a crisp.
Jack claims it was a righteous shoot.

38
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,300
Man, l hate these lAD scumbags.

39
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:01,390
Blake Wilson, lnternal Affairs.
l'm always running into you, Jack.

40
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,270
Give us a minute, fellas.

41
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,650
- What did you do now?.
- l was on a stakeout.

42
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,950
- l was real close to nailing...
- Close? The lceman, right?

43
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,280
l'm getting real close.
l'll nail these guys.

44
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,290
Every case you can't solve
you pin on the lceman.

45
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,000
The biggest dealer in the Bay Area.
No prints, no description.

46
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,540
You're the only cop
who believes he exists.

47
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,670
l'll let you in on a secret.
There is no lceman.

48
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,720
Let's get back to the cold facts.
What the hell happened here?

49
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:44,810
l saw an exchange. l moved in.
He had a piece. He shot. l shot back.

50
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,610
- You got the bad guy's gun?
- lt's got to be in the ashes.

51
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,740
- Cruise, what have you got?
- Some burnt metal off the pump.

52
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,790
- No gun?
- No, no gun.

53
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,880
A cop is a guy, and a guy
sometimes steps on his dick.

54
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,500
Do you think maybe
you were pushing too hard?

55
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,760
Did you step on your dick?.

56
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,890
He had a piece.
He shot. l shot back.

57
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:29,020
Have the lab boys go over every inch
of this place. lf there's a gun, l want it.

58
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,070
- See you around, Jack.
- Yeah.

59
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,480
Reggie Hammond.

60
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,290
You must be
a real dangerous convict.

61
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,140
- You made me miss, cop.
- You're looking good, Reggie.

62
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,810
l ain't seen you in years.
We were friends.

63
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,900
- l'm sorry. l've been busy.
- Me, too.

64
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,110
What are you doing here?
You even got a new haircut.

65
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,110
Times change.

66
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,410
- You lost a couple of pounds.
- l quit drinking.

67
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,910
Have you come to tell me
my sentence got increased?

68
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,420
No, you're still getting out tomorrow,
and we've got a little job to do.

69
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:20,340
When l get out of here,
give me my money and walk away.

70
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,180
l played that cop shit once,
and it don't work.

71
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:30,810
lf you don't help me, l'm not ever
gonna give you your money back.

72
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,650
- You're fucking with me?
- No.

73
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,730
l gave you that money in good faith.
l trusted you.

74
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,660
- Now you're telling me l can't have it?
- Now you've got the picture, convict.

75
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,290
- You screwed up, Hammond.
- lt was self-defence.

76
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,760
l served two years for a crime l did.
l never denied that.

77
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,140
But l've just done five years
for a robbery l didn't do.

78
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,680
Murderers do less time than me.

79
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,940
You can spend your remaining time
in isolation. Open up.

80
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,510
Roxanne

81
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,930
You don'thave to
put on the red light

82
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,600
Those days are over, you don't
have to sell yourbody to the night

83
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,980
Roxanne

84
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,540
(SLOW ROCK MUSlC)

85
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,190
Tequila. The bottle.

86
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,280
- Do you guys want anything?
- Whisky. Put it in a glass.

87
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,460
Mr Price, the man is distressed.

88
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:05,050
That mess in the desert makes him
wonder if your boys can finish the job.

89
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,010
Not to worry.

90
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,720
Real pros? Not from where l'm sitting.

91
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,480
Don't get the heat all jacked up
when you're doing a job.

92
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,900
lf you want to be an outlaw,
there ain't no rules.

93
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,190
- ls that your philosophy?.
- We're the only real Americans left.

94
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,610
We believe in freedom.
We live the way folks used to.

95
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:38,040
Before big cities, lawyers, computers
with your names in them. Free!

96
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,330
The rest of you
are just a bunch of fucking slaves.

97
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,340
That's real interesting, Mr Price.
Maybe you should run for office.

98
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,010
l'm supposed to tell you
to take precautions.

99
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,390
Your backup
got barbecued at a racetrack.

100
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,140
- You know what to do with that?
- No problem here, friend.

101
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,690
- l used to be a Marine.
- l guess that figures.

102
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,230
lf you have any trouble, come to me.
You know the number.

103
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,700
Hey, come here.

104
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,790
You got the wrong girl.
l don't do that.

105
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,830
Come on.
My friend and l just came into town.

106
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,260
We're looking for a whore that works
here. Her name's Angel.

107
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,880
She's dancing up in North Beach.

108
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:37,720
- How about you?
- l'm getting tired of this. Let go!

109
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,560
- l'll call the cops.
- Go ahead, call them.

110
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,610
Let's hit the road, boys.
Come on, Cherry.

111
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,410
ln the matter of the shooting
at Hunter's Point Raceway

112
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,580
of the suspect Arthur Brock,
resident of San Francisco,

113
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,840
the review board has carefully
examined evidence and testimony

114
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,590
and determined that the officer
in question, lnspector Jack Cates,

115
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,090
had insufficient probable cause.

116
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:24,770
ln view of the on going investigation
by the lnternal Affairs Division,

117
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,070
this review board's ruling is that
the shooting was a wrongful action.

118
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,410
l never thought
they'd land on you so hard.

119
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:49,090
You'll be prosecuted for manslaughter.
l wish they'd found that gun.

120
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,050
- Sorry, Jack. l'm just doing my job.
- Right(!)

121
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:01,970
Your profile says: "obsessed cop with
a record of stepping over the line."

122
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,690
lt's quite likely the DA will choose
to prosecute you on third degree.

123
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,770
- ln other words, you're screwed.
- Unless l find the lceman.

124
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,860
Give it up, Jack.
That's what got you into this.

125
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,660
Jesus Christ, you sound like Wilson.

126
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,990
We're talking facts here. You've got
no leads, the department's got no leads.

127
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,540
This is manslaughter.
Protect yourself.

128
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,610
Hammond, let's go.
lt's a big day for you today.

129
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,030
- Just get me out of here.
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

130
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,750
Reggie.

131
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,920
- Come here.
- Excuse me.

132
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,720
You will keep your promise, right?

133
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,140
Don't worry, everything is cool.

134
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,520
That white cop that was here,
is he a problem?

135
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,400
No!
l promise you, everything is cool.

136
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,860
But it might take
a little longer than l said it would.

137
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:46,200
Don't bullshit me.
Get that money and keep your word.

138
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:52,330
l kept you alive in this rat hole
for five years.

139
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,800
l can get you out there.
l can pull your fucking heart out.

140
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,020
- What was all that about?
- An old football bet.

141
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,730
That's a crock.
Hammond, Reggie A.

142
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,820
$100 cash and a free bus ride
to San Francisco.

143
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,240
All compliments
of the State of California.

144
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,030
- That's it?
- Yes.

145
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,450
Thank you for sparing me
the other crap.

146
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,920
Don't slam my shit down like that.

147
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:41,920
Where's my James Brown tape?
The shit ain't in here.

148
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,760
Nobody keeps me
and James in prison.

149
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:57,520
- We didn't finish our conversation.
- Get me my fucking money.

150
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,990
You're not getting your money
unless you help me.

151
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:05,990
l trusted you with my money
and my car, and you fucked me.

152
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,370
l've been chasing a drug dealer
called the lceman for four years.

153
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,420
Last week l found out
that he wants you dead.

154
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,550
l got this off some guy being paid to
make a hit on you. Recognise him?

155
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,760
ln four years,
you're the best lead l ever had.

156
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,510
Yeah? l ain't helping you
while you got my money.

157
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,480
You let me rot in prison for five years
and then show up wanting help?

158
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,770
- That's dumb, man!
- This time it's gonna be different.

159
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,150
l'm going to lose my badge.
They're gonna put me in jail.

160
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,240
You're in trouble with the law?. Good!

161
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:52,290
As bad as l feel about losing
my money, that makes me feel better.

162
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,870
Wait a minute. l don't beg!

163
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,340
What are you gonna do, shoot me?
l'm the best lead you ever had.

164
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,840
l'll come and visit you
in about five or six years.

165
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,940
- Let's go.
- We got a schedule.

166
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,150
- l'm not on the State's time no more.
- Write a letter.

167
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,510
The big fucker in the blue Caddy,
that's the pig who wasted my brother.

168
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,510
This is great, man. l get them both.

169
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,900
HAMMOND: You don't know
whatyou do to me

170
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:11,360
Letme down
in misery

171
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,700
Oh, yes, sir! Well!
Oh, yes, sir!

172
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:23,210

173
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,630
Aooooooh!
Heh! Heh! Heh!Aoooooh!

174
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,000
Wanna kiss myself!
Good God! Well!

175
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,920
And l got to feelit!
Heeeey!

176
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,970
Well! Oh!

177
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,850
Baby, baby, baby!
Baby, baby, baby!

178
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,480
Baby, baby, baby!
Baby, baby, whooooo!

179
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,360
Want to get on the...
on the good foot! Oh, good God!

180
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,990
Hey!Aaaooow! Justsometimes l...
When l go to church...

181
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,910
Yeeeaaaah!

182
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,960
Baby, baby, baby!
Baby, baby, baby! Baby, baby...

183
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,340
Get down!

184
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,270
l'm going west on Highway 50.

185
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,440
Get some help here, right now!
l need help now!

186
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,590
Let's go.

187
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,810
(POLlCE SlRENS)
Come on.

188
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,570
Come on!

189
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,680
You've fractured your left clavicle.

190
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,550
Blood trauma broke the skin.

191
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,270
- You always wear a bullet-proof vest?
- Only when l see my friends.

192
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,860
l want you to change the bandage
on your chest every hour.

193
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,240
l have to immobilise this arm.
Wear this sling.

194
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:28,120
- Where are you going?
- l've got police business.

195
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,710
l was minding my own business,
and those bikers started shooting.

196
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,580
- The x-rays are fine.
- But my head is still hurting.

197
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,460
You had a bus roll over on you.

198
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,880
You might have a slight concussion.
But you're one lucky man.

199
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,640
- We're going to hold you overnight.
- You ain't holding me overnight.

200
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,720
l'm going home. l ain't spending
my first day out in no hospital.

201
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:54,730
You'll be here to answer questions.
You never saw those bikers before?

202
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,610
All you rednecks look the same to me.

203
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,990
- Keep on him, Art.
- Great, Art the goddamn redneck.

204
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,780
l was coming out of the kitchen
with this guy's breakfast.

205
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:12,830
He looked funny. Not just hungry,
but like he's mad at something.

206
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,040
The next thing there's gunshots
and the window's breaking...

207
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:23,630
- Hammond, when can l see him?
- l've got to keep him overnight.

208
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,220
That's one lucky guy. l'd like to
follow him around a racetrack.

209
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:34,060
You know what he was in jail for?.
That son of a bitch is a child molester.

210
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,810
He's involved in kiddie porn. l've got
to get him to San Francisco tonight.

211
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:44,820
He'll identify the kingpin. lf l don't get
him there tonight, the kingpin walks.

212
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,200
You want a ride in a Cadillac?

213
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,620
l've been having a fucked-up day.
The last thing l want to see is you.

214
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:00,000
l'm just trying to help you out.

215
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,300
You could always catch a bus.
You had a lot of luck on the last one.

216
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,430
Do me a favour. Stay away from me.

217
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,720
l'm sorry, Reg.
They released you in my custody.

218
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:23,190
- Have you seen those bikers before?
- Where's my money?.

219
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,200
You tell me why the lceman wants
you dead, you'll get your money.

220
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,830
- Ask the guy you got my picture off.
- He can't talk. l killed him.

221
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,580
- Do they pay you by the pound?
- He shot at me first.

222
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,830
- Only we can't find his gun.
- Are you looking for sympathy?.

223
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,840
l'm supposed to be in Florida running
my uncle's used-car business.

224
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,510
lnstead l'm broke, l was shot at, l was
in a bus that flipped over 20 times,

225
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,930
l broke my walkman and l was hit
by a big truck. So leave me alone.

226
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,480
Life's tough. l ran into your friends.
They shot me in the chest six times.

227
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:05,440
- You don't look bad for a dead man.
- l was wearing one of these.

228
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,610
- Why?.
- l knew l was going to see you.

229
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,830
l wouldn't want to get killed by
a stray bullet that was meant for you.

230
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,620
You think l should get one?

231
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:24,040
They're about $750. That's more than
they gave you when they let you out.

232
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:30,300
- l hope you got my Porsche.
- l said l'd take real good care of it.

233
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,140
That don't mean nothing. You said
we had a deal and you fucked me.

234
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,180
You fucked yourself.
You stole the prison payroll.

235
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,690
- l checked into it.
- l was framed.

236
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:48,530
Yeah, some convict got a guard
to put the money in your cell.

237
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,070
- Sure you got framed.
- What about you?

238
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,280
They never found that guy's gun
out at the racetrack.

239
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:03,920
- l'm a cop. You're a crook.
- So everything l say is a goddam lie?

240
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,040
Just take me to my car.
l'm through with you.

241
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,920
What's wrong, does your arm hurt?
Does it hurt bad? Good.

242
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:16,220
We've got a problem here, slick.

243
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:22,270
l didn't hire these hillbillies,
so don't come complaining to me.

244
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,270
Yes, plan B.
We've got an ex-Marine on the case.

245
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,320
The only problem is,
he's a hillbilly, too.

246
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,950
Right, later.

247
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:46,250
- How much money did you spend?
- About 25 grand.

248
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,210
- You said l could buy a new car.
- Where is it?

249
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:55,090
- This is a new car.
- This is the same old piece of shit.

250
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,260
l bought the same model, year, colour.
That's the way l like it.

251
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,480
You got the same car, same clothes.

252
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,690
- You got the same girl, too?
- Elaine?

253
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,230
- Hell, l don't want to talk about this.
- Keep it all balled up like a knot.

254
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,990
She married me about
five years ago in City Hall.

255
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,830
She figured she'd settle me down.

256
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:23,410
This was where we lived
till we split up.

257
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:29,170
l want to sell it. Twelve grand
of yours went for the down payment.

258
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:35,340
How could you leave my car outside?
What if somebody stole it?

259
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:39,720
l had a lock put on it.
Just push this blue button.

260
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:44,600
You have no appreciation
whatsoever of what's hype.

261
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,980
You know how much pussy
l got because of that car?.

262
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,860
They blew up my car!

263
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:04,160
- They blew up my car!
- That's a damn shame.

264
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:11,090
- That's all you've got to say?.
- You're having a bad day.

265
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:14,630
l'm through with you.
l'm calling some of my homies.

266
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,720
l'm getting a loan. l'm stepping off!

267
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,730
Buster, what's up? Reggie Hammond.

268
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,650
Yes, my brother!
l'm out. l'm on the street again.

269
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,030
Yeah, cool. Listen...

270
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:43,530
Yeah, l know. l'm gonna do that.
That's why l'm calling. l need a loan.

271
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,250
l know l owe you some shit,
but l just got out ofjail.

272
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,790
Listen... l don't have collateral.
l just got out ofjail.

273
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,760
l don't need collateral,
this is Reggie Hammond. Hey...

274
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,220
Hey, Buster?. Buster..?

275
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,570
- We heard your house blew up.
- Not my house. A car.

276
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:23,950
- Your car blew up?
- No, some guy who parked out front.

277
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,120
- Anything come in on those bikers?
- No, l'll check again.

278
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:35,170
You've got to see Wilson. lf you don't,
he'll send someone to get you.

279
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,380
Jack, are you okay?.

280
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,940
You giving him a ticket?
Good, he hates cops.

281
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,400
- He does?
- Yeah. l rode here with him.

282
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:04,490
He said cops are pussies
who hide behind their badges.

283
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,790
He said he didn't care
if it was a no-parking zone.

284
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,870
He said
that any cop could kiss his ass.

285
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,710
Your friend's not too smart.

286
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,300
He's a big dumb-ass cop
named Jack Cates.

287
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,970
Tell Cates to stop parking here.

288
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,150
Hello, Jack.

289
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:41,110
The motorcycle track, then the diner,
and now a bomb at your house.

290
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,650
The lceman has been busy.

291
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,780
l'm not here to argue with you.
l'm here to support you.

292
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:53,920
However, as supervisor of
lnternal Affairs, l have to tell you

293
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,880
that you're on suspension
until the hearing tomorrow.

294
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:02,880
So give me that gun
and badge and police lD.

295
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,590
Yeah, right.

296
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,560
l'll bet you think l enjoy this.

297
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:15,600
Jack, do me a favour,
go home and get some sleep.

298
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:24,700
l've got to go
and make out some reports.

299
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:30,530
l don't mind people checking up
on cops. We're not above the law.

300
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,330
But making cops do it is bad
for morale. lt's bad for cops.

301
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:41,170
Civilians ought to do it.
You're a real chickenshit, Wilson.

302
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:48,220
Maybe it's not your fault.
Maybe it's yourjob.

303
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,190
All right.

304
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,470
Yo, Marvin, what's up?
Reggie Hammond... Hammond.

305
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:31,100
Yeah, yeah. How are you doing?
l just got out. Yeah, brother.

306
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,140
What? You're a born-again Christian.
Get the fuck out of here!

307
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,270
l can't picture you
as a born-again Christian.

308
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,730
l saw you beat the bitch up.

309
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,070
No, everybody can find Jesus.
l love Jesus.

310
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,990
l love Jesus. l love Jesus.
Hello? Hello..?

311
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,700
Willie Biggs! Reggie Hammond.
Hello..? Black motherfucker!

312
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,840
13 complaints involving biker types
in the last four days.

313
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:11,180
- 2 traffics. One D&D in North-Beach.
- Run these guys through NClC.

314
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,470
l'll have Cruise do it.
He don't look much like a biker to me.

315
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,140
Nice talking to you.

316
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:29,200
- Are you still here?
- l ain't happy about it.

317
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:35,240
l'm supposed to be free, get on with
my life, not tied to your dumb ass.

318
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,620
- Welcome back.
- Get off me. l ain't no convict.

319
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:45,290
l'm free. You're close to where l was
yesterday. You ain't running shit.

320
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,970
l ain't working for you,
and l don't like you.

321
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,140
Cut the bullshit.
Give me something l can use.

322
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,220
The lceman bought your house.

323
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:03,060
- Cut the bullshit!
- You still ain't put this shit together.

324
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:08,940
Ganz and l took half a million dollars
from the lceman. He's still pissed off.

325
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,410
lt's amazing how money
affects some people.

326
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,990
Yes, the man you've been looking for
all this time

327
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:23,580
bought your fucked up car and put
a down payment on your house.

328
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,500
That makes you the dumbest
motherfucker in law enforcement.

329
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:33,760
l'm driving. Your arm's fucked up.
l, unlike you, have a lot to live for.

330
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,350
l always wanted a chauffeur.

331
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:48,360
l recognised one of those bikers
who attacked the bus. Cherry Ganz.

332
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:52,490
He's Ganz' brother.
He makes Ganz look like Gandhi.

333
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:58,950
- Why would the lceman hire him?
- l helped you kill his brother.

334
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,460
Ganz said his brother
used to fuck this bitch named Angel.

335
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:10,880
- She worked at Barnstormers.
- We got a complaint from there.

336
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:14,380
Are the cops actually contributing
to this investigation?

337
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:18,550
How do you remember all this
after seven years in prison?

338
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,520
ln prison you remember every
story about pussy you ever heard.

339
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,240
Wait, l got to get something.

340
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,200
Jack, this shit is fake.

341
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,240
l'll flash it fast.

342
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:46,460
lf somebody spooks that fake badge,
you'll get your ass whipped.

343
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,710
You just watch your own ass, Reggie.

344
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:11,020
We were true lovers
One ofa kind

345
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,490
We shared a love
thatyou are lucky to find

346
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,200
l'll go question the barmaid
who called in the complaint.

347
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:24,950
You do your cop shit.
l'll check out these whores.

348
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,430
Hey! Are you the one who called
to complain about some bikers?

349
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,810
You finally responded.
lt's only been a day and a half.

350
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:50,940
- Are you gonna keep bitching?
- You're not here when we need you.

351
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:56,860
Can l have a shot of Stoli?
How are you doing?

352
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,660
- Hi, buy me a drink?.
- l just got out ofjail. l'm broke.

353
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,080
- But you can buy my drink.
- Fuck off.

354
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:15,300
l know you, right?
You broke my heart once.

355
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,470
- l won't let you get away this time.
- l'll be right back.

356
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,640
l just have to powder my nose.

357
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:42,450
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Pretty good. How are you?

358
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,870
Did you ever see those commercials
on TV with the tourists?

359
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,710
- Karl Malden.
- Yes, big-ass nose.

360
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:55,210
Did you see them show people getting
their pockets picked in slow-motion?

361
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,930
- Shit!
- Shit is a good word to say there.

362
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,430
- l can get your money back.
- For how much?

363
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,430
- l figure about half your money.
- Half? Give me a break.

364
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,270
l'm giving you a break.
You ain't got nothing now.

365
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,230
She'll use your credit cards.
Your credit will be all fucked up.

366
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,030
- lf you don't want it, fuck you.
- Deal.

367
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:26,870
He starts asking me about a girl
that worked here. He gets real rough.

368
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,660
- Then the blonde one pulls out a gun.
- What about this girl?

369
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:35,840
Angel. She dances at
The Bird Cage up in North Beach.

370
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:41,130
- Why aren't you writing this down?
- Good memory. Know the address?

371
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:03,320
- This is the ladies' room.
- Mind your own business.

372
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,330
Hey...

373
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:13,160
l thought we should get to know
each other. You're very smooth.

374
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:16,290
l've seen a lot of pickpockets,
but none as smooth.

375
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:23,510
That guy is so upset. l told him
l could get him half his money back.

376
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:29,470
lf you offer me a bribe, l could
tell him you were too fast for me.

377
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,480
l am too fast for you.

378
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,780
Oh, hi. Almost finished.

379
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,830
- Anybody else with them?
- No, just the three of them.

380
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:54,910
There was this skinny black guy.
The oldest was talking to him.

381
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,670
Black guy?.
Was he something like this?

382
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,590
Yeah, that's him.
He was okay, he didn't bother me.

383
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:11,390
lf they come in again, call the police
and ask for lnspector Kehoe.

384
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:16,560
- Here's half your money.
- Where are my credit cards?

385
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,360
The deal was for the money.
Your cards are in the bathroom.

386
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,450
You gotta give it all you've got

387
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:48,380
- Jack Cates. Remember me?
- l don't think so.

388
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:51,680
You busted me in the back seat
of a Camaro with a girl.

389
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:56,020
- That doesn't sound like me.
- lt turns out she was under age.

390
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:00,270
- Shit happens.
- l didn't steal that car, my buddy did.

391
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,280
- You ought to pick better buddies.
- l got two years.

392
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,320
l don't wanna get into a bar fight.

393
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:12,330
People always get into bar fights,
it's a cliché.

394
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:15,750
You see it in the motion pictures.

395
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:21,790
People get kicked in the head,
beer bottles and furniture...

396
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:18,720
l'm kicking two years out of your ass!

397
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:21,980
Have you got a gun?
ln case they stick the place up.

398
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:37,790
All right, knock this shit off.

399
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:42,870
l have been having a bad day.
l just got out ofjail.

400
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,340
Already l've been shot at. l was
on a bus that flipped over 17 times.

401
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:55,340
A bitch tried to stab me,
and somebody blew up my Porsche.

402
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,350
l usually don't jump in
when somebody's getting beat down,

403
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:01,640
but Jack Cates
is helping me straighten things out.

404
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:07,400
- Now let us go about our business.
- Because you've got a gun?

405
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:13,320
- Because l'll pop a cap in your ass.
- You don't have the guts to use it.

406
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,370
Anybody else want a limp?

407
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:30,550
Sorry about the kneecap.
l got a little excited.

408
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,720
- You blew that investigation.
- You disappeared on me.

409
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:40,890
- Didn't know l had to save your ass.
- l didn't need your help.

410
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:45,480
l should've had my spare gun.

411
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:50,110
Then l get in a bar fight.
Jesus, Jack, what are you doing?

412
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,360
- Hey!
- What was that for?.

413
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:57,990
That was for the basketball.
Now we're even, we can start fresh.

414
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,200
l got to get out of here.
The deal is off.

415
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,710
- Fuck this!
- Bullshit. Get in the car.

416
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,420
Were you born a shithead
or did you take lessons?

417
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:13,510
Don't take it so damn personal.
Come on, let's go.

418
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:19,140
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- Don't be stupid.

419
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:24,390
- Where are you going?
- Away from you.

420
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:29,480
Your tip turned out okay. Ganz' lady
lives down at the King Mei Hotel.

421
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:35,070
Bye, Jack. Fuck you, Jack.

422
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,450
Shit!

423
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,970
Here's the story on one of the bikers.

424
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:00,720
Ganz, Richard. Member of
the Western Brotherhood bike gang.

425
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:05,220
Seven outstanding warrants.
72 outstanding traffic violations.

426
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:10,770
- L.A. bike gangs?
- Yeah. LAPD has more coming in.

427
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:14,730
- l'llbe right over.
- The man is on suspension!

428
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,450
That ain't a good idea.
Wilson's looking for you.

429
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,700
Christ! He heard about the bar.

430
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,450
Be outfront with everythingyou got.

431
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,000
ln 15 minutes.

432
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,460
Kehoe, get in.

433
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:46,430
- Give me that. You steer.
- Jesus Christ!

434
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,310
- Hickcock. Ganz.
- That's Albert Ganz' brother.

435
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,940
They're cop killers.
They capped two cops, five days ago.

436
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:02,910
Special lnvestigations says

01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:47,870
When an officer takes it upon himself
to violate department regulations,

585
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:51,290
it makes it hard
for a good cop to do his job.

586
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:56,290
Objection. These remarks have
nothing to do with the incident.

587
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:59,920
l'm trying to show
a pattern of behaviour

588
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:04,170
that will illuminate the events
at Hunter's Point Raceway.

589
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:07,050
l'll let the testimony stand.

590
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:32,030
JUDGE: After the preliminary
evidence provided by the State,

591
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:38,710
and in adherence to laws specified
by the State of California...

592
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:44,130
- There he is!
- Order! This is a judicial hearing.

593
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:47,840
- No, it's some other guy.
- No, right there!

594
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:50,720
That's not him.

595
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:54,350
- Who are these men?
- Your Honour, that's lnspector Cates.

596
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,230
- That's definitely not him.
- That's got to be the lceman.

597
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:00,860
He's not the one
l took the money from.

598
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:05,900
- That's got to be the lceman.
- This is too much!

599
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:14,540
The State may proceed with a
criminal trial against lnspector Cates.

600
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:20,920
The trial date will be the earliest
opening on the court calendar.

601
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:47,030
- lceman whacked out Price.
- You want to talk about it?

602
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:49,320
The man had no choice.
Your girl ratted him out to the cops.

603
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:56,450
That's no bullshit. You both know her.
She lives at the King Mei Hotel.

604
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:00,670
You should be more careful
about who you hang out with.

605
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:05,800
- Who pulled the trigger?.
- What's the fucking difference?

606
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:10,300
The cops were getting too close.
lt's business, not personal.

607
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:13,430
You should learn the difference.

608
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:16,430
Business... Yeah.

609
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:24,770
That's business, too.

610
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:29,650
(LAUGHlNG)

611
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,120
You happy now, asshole?

612
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:40,080
That still doesn't change the job.

613
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:44,000
- You've got to kill Hammond.
- How do we do that?

614
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:49,460
Kirkland Smith is the dude
who kept Reggie alive in the joint.

615
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:52,760
Reggie owes him.
He's going to pay back.

616
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:58,220
The dude has a daughter who works
in the Haight Goodwill Store.

617
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:03,900
We're gonna get Hammond,
and the cop and the lceman.

618
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:09,110
- We'll kill them all.
- Just stick to Hammond, Joe Bob.

619
01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:19,490
l keep forgetting the combination.

620
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:25,120
l don't want to see you clear out
your locker. We can get this guy.

621
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:38,050
l've been a cop for 20 years.

622
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:41,810
All l've ever been around
are pimps, murderers and robbers.

623
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:47,940
Between you and me, l've always
been straight. You did your best...

624
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,900
..so here's your 475,000 dollars.

625
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:09,340
You kept my money in your locker?.
ln a police locker, Jack?. !

626
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:15,010
Yeah! Hey, we've got no more ties.
You're a free man, Reg.

627
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:20,810
My advice to you is,
take this money and disappear.

628
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:39,160
- Are you sure, man?
- Yeah.

629
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,790
All right.

630
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,290
All right.

631
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:08,310
Thank you. Have a nice day.

632
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:20,240
Reggie Hammond. This is $75,000,
courtesy of your father.

633
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:25,370
- This money has got to be dirty.
- We both know your dad is no angel.

634
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:29,210
This money is not stolen.
He helped me when l was in jail.

635
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,500
l owed him.
He thought it would benefit you.

636
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:37,720
A lot of fathers wouldn't even do this.
Accept it. Bye-bye.

637
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:44,510
Mr Hammond. How is he?

638
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:47,430
He's good. You should go see him.

639
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:52,770
- Maybe.
- No, you should go see him.

640
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,140
- Hey.
- Hi, Ben.

641
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:38,570
- Sorry l couldn't help more.
- You did what you could.

642
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:42,490
lt's gonna be pretty fucking dull
without you around here.

643
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:45,700
l can't believe
you're not coming to work tomorrow.

644
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:51,120
- Get a beer?.
- Maybe later.

645
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:08,470
- Got a bunch of messages, Frank.
- Thanks, Joe.

646
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:22,650
- Yeah?
- We gotHammond.

647
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:26,620
- Good. ls he dead yet?
- There's a change in plans.

648
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:30,540
- Killing one of us wasn't in the deal.
- What is this shit?

649
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:33,500
You wanthim dead,
we want 500 G's.

650
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:37,500
For doing one of the Brotherhood.

651
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:43,380
500,000 orHammond fingers you.
There's a place in Modesto...

652
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:47,390
You want more money, pick
a place indoors, with lots of people.

653
01:21:54,890 --> 01:22:00,520
Some guy named Burroughs,
looks just like the guy you were after.

654
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:03,530
They found him dead in the Mission.

655
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:07,030
Here's his sheet. lt's a mile long.

656
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:15,160
l circulated this guy's picture here
and got nothing.

657
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,630
That's funny,
Cruise busted him last July.

658
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:48,870
Cates, even though there's
no love lost between us, it hurts me

659
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:52,240
to see a man throw away his career.
Let's let bygones be bygones.

660
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:36,120
l'm looking for the Cage Club,
the upstairs part.

661
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:39,500
Fifth floor.
You've got to join. 50 bucks.

662
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,150
You don't look too happy, Reg.

663
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,540
Sorry. Look me up later
and l'll buy you a drink.

664
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:29,420
Where's Hammond?

665
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:35,260
- Who's the girl?
- Just somebody he was with.

666
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:45,190
500 G's, right?
Now, let's check the merchandise.

667
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:57,830
Take him out behind the building and
blow him away. Shoot both of them.

668
01:24:57,990 --> 01:25:03,170
What's this guy doing here?
That guy ain't the lceman.

669
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:08,300
- You're just trying to save your ass.
- That guy is a cop. lt's a set-up.

670
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:13,800
They got the wrong guy,
don't they, Cruise?

671
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:19,640
Hello, Jack.

672
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:24,190
lt's Christmas here, Willie.
We can take them all.

673
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:26,940
That's the lceman!

674
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:31,690
Pretty good, Jack.
You always were a smart cop.

675
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:36,990
- l really didn't want to believe it.
- Sorry to let you down, Jack.

676
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:41,290
All l want is the lceman.
You two, take the money and leave.

677
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:45,420
- Nobody is leaving with my money.
- Money?. l want the fucking lceman.

678
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:07,440
Get the fuck out of the way.

679
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:06,910
Fuck!

680
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:31,190
- Somebody help me!
- Shut up!

681
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,270
Let go of me.

682
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:39,860
You fucking bitch!

683
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:16,400
You set me up, Ben.
You never ran that shit through NClC.

684
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:19,700
You had Cruise
pick up the gun at the track.

685
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:22,410
l needed leverage on you.
You were getting close.

686
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:45,280
Jack, we can work this out,
just let me out of here.

687
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:54,080
You're a disgrace, Ben.
There's nothing worse than a bad cop.

688
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:57,040
Thank you for a very pleasant day!

689
01:29:57,210 --> 01:29:59,170
l've got no car, no money

690
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:03,880
and now l've got this
dope man's Uzi by my temple.

691
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:08,600
This is Jack's day. Why don't you
let Jack shoot me? Shoot me, Jack!

692
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:36,420
Coming through.

693
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:45,800
Oh, Jack, l can't believe
you shot me. This shit hurts.

694
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:50,390
l told you to buy a bullet-proof vest.

695
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:54,930
You did real good, Reggie.

696
01:30:55,100 --> 01:31:00,980
The doc says you'll be fine.
l guess l'm a pretty good shot.

697
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:05,530
- You're gonna have to take it easy.
- l'm sorry he was your friend.

698
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:09,740
He wasn't my friend. You're my friend.

699
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:12,540
Besides, l had to save my partner.

700
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:22,090
l got this off the lceman.

701
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:28,800
lt's 500 grand. l'll meet you
at the hospital, and we'll talk about it.

702
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:38,520
Here, hold this for me.

703
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:55,240
