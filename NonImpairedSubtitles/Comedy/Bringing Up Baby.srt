1
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,577
Good morning, Miss Swallow.

2
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,250
- Why, what's the matter?
- Dr. Huxley is thinking.

3
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,193
Alice, I think this one
must belong in the tail.

4
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,330
Nonsense. You tried it in the tail yesterday
and it didn't fit.

5
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,375
Yes, that's right. I did, didn't I?

6
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,344
David, it's a telegram for you from Utah.
It's from the expedition.

7
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,314
The expedition! Open it. I'll be right down.

8
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,789
David, they found it! They found it, David!

9
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,484
Not the intercostal clavicle?

10
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,356
It's on its way. It'll be here tomorrow.

11
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,225
Just think of it, Professor.

12
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,527
The very last bone we needed
to complete the brontosaurus.

13
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,161
The intercostal clavicle is arriving
tomorrow after four years' hard work.

14
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,866
- Congratulations, my boy.
- Isn't it great? I can hardly believe it!

15
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,103
Stop it. Really, David, there's a time
and place for everything.

16
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,644
What will Prof. LaTouche think?

17
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,737
After all, you're getting married tomorrow.

18
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,250
- Yes, I know we are...
- Right, we're getting married tomorrow.

19
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,286
Isn't that odd? Two important things
happening on the same day.

20
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,481
I think the occasion calls for a celebration.

21
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,887
Don't worry, we'll celebrate.

22
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,118
We're going away
directly after we're married.

23
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,890
Going away? What are you thinking of,
David? After receiving this telegram?

24
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,864
As soon as we're married,
we're coming directly back here...

25
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,231
- and you're going on with your work.
- Alice.

26
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:53,136
Now, once and for all, David,
nothing must interfere with your work.

27
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,972
Our marriage must entail
no domestic entanglements of any kind.

28
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,807
- You mean...
- I mean of any kind, David.

29
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,543
Alice, I was sort of hoping...
You mean children, all that sort of thing?

30
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,552
Exactly. This will be our child.

31
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:13,024
Yes, David, I see our marriage
purely as a dedication to your work.

32
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,152
Alice, everybody has to have
a honeymoon and...

33
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,821
We haven't time.

34
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,162
You have an appointment this afternoon.

35
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,465
- Have I? What for?
- To play golf with Mr. Peabody.

36
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,329
What Peabody?

37
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,204
The Alexander Peabody
who represents Mrs. Carleton Random.

38
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,264
Now let me think.

39
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,540
Who may donate $1 million
to the museum to complete all this.

40
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,513
Oh, sure! That Mr. Peabody.

41
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,643
$1 million.
That's pretty white of Mr. Peabody.

42
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,015
You haven't got it yet.

43
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,681
Let me remind you that a lot depends
on the impression you make on him.

44
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:47,556
Don't worry. After I've received this,
I feel good for anything.

45
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,527
I'll wow him, I'll knock him for a loop.

46
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,087
David, no slang.
Remember who and what you are.

47
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,497
- That's right.
- Go on. You mustn't keep him waiting.

48
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,798
- Goodbye, Alice. I mean, Professor.
- Don't forget your golf clubs.

49
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,737
Remember, let Mr. Peabody win.

50
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,567
Yes, Alice. I will.

51
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,904
Oh, dear. Excuse me.

52
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,445
I can't tell you, Mr. Peabody...

53
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,778
how much this endowment
would mean to the museum...

54
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,181
and to me personally.

55
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,618
If you could just give me
some assurance...

56
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,985
If you could give me some assurance
that you'd...

57
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:21,083
consider us first before you donate that
million to anyone else, I'd appreciate it.

58
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,822
Dr. Huxley, you seem to be
under some misapprehension.

59
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,591
I haven't got $1 million.

60
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,225
I represent the possible donor,
Mrs. Carleton Random...

61
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,166
whose legal advisor I happen to be.

62
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,636
Yes, of course. I forgot.

63
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,939
Mr. Peabody, then I wonder...

64
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,775
if you could use your influence
with Mrs. Random, that would be nice.

65
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,873
Dr. Huxley, when I play golf,
I only talk golf...

66
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,612
- and then only between shots.
- Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

67
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:51,282
Couldn't we continue this discussion
over a whisky and soda after our game?

68
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,680
Yes, we could.

69
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,557
Meantime, I believe you hooked your ball.

70
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,759
Yes, I did.
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody.

71
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,357
Yes. All right.

72
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,835
Look! You can't...

73
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,576
That's my ball. Just a minute!

74
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,205
Here's hoping.

75
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,680
I say, just a minute. I beg your pardon.

76
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,409
Oh, dear.

77
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,544
- You shouldn't do that, you know.
- What shouldn't I do?

78
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,918
Talk while someone's shooting.

79
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,287
Anyway, I forgive you
because I got a good shot.

80
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,622
- You don't understand.
- It's right next to the pin.

81
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,059
That has nothing to do with it.

82
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,426
- You playing through?
- I've just teed off.

83
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,931
You must be a stranger here.
You should be over there.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,596
This is the 18th fairway and I'm on
the green. If I sink this, I'll beat my record.

85
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,538
Be there in a minute!
What kind of ball are you playing?

86
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,700
- PGA.
- I'm playing a CrowFlight.

87
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,471
I like a PGA better.

88
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,638
I'm trying to prove
that you're playing my ball.

89
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,206
A PGA has two black dots,
and a CrowFlight has a circle.

90
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,309
I'm not superstitious.

91
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,083
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Stop talking and take out the pin.

92
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,585
Oh, my, this is so silly.

93
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,792
See? It's a circle.

94
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,423
Of course. Do you think
it would roll if it were square?

95
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:10,492
I have reference to a mark on the ball.
That proves it's a CrowFlight. That's mine.

96
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,595
What does it matter?
It's only a game, anyway.

97
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,503
Young lady, you don't seem to realize...

98
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,099
you've placed me
in a very embarrassing position.

99
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,200
Really? I'm sorry.

100
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,974
The most important lawyer in New York
is waiting for me on the first fairway.

101
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,949
Then it's silly of you
to be fooling around on the 18th green.

102
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,178
You don't mind if I take this with me?

103
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,277
Not at all.

104
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,812
Tell the caddy master to put it in my bag
when you're finished.

105
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,351
Huxley, come on!

106
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,526
Yes, I'll be with you in a minute,
Mr. Peabody!

107
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,668
Hey, mister, I think that's your car.

108
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,012
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!

109
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,159
What do you think you're doing?

110
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,891
I'm trying to un-park my car.

111
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,058
- Oh, hello.
- This is my car!

112
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,261
Good. Would you mind
moving it out of the way?

113
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,305
- No. This is my car.
- Yes, I understand that.

114
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,898
If you move it back four feet,
I'll be able to get out.

115
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,877
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
Maybe this is yours. What did you say?

116
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,404
I said if you move it back about four feet,
I'll be able to get out.

117
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,747
I'm in a terrible hurry, and I can't budge.

118
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,617
- You want me to move your car?
- Would you mind terribly?

119
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,054
- Yes, I will, but...
- That would be awfully kind.

120
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,854
- Take it very easy.
- Yes, I'll go slowly.

121
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,430
What are you doing?

122
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,432
I have to get into position.

123
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,895
Please be careful.

124
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,027
I will. Now, you say when.

125
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,832
- Yes, all right.
- Am I clear?

126
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,497
Yes, you're clear now.

127
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,845
- Now look what you've done.
- That's all right. I'm insured.

128
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,678
I don't care whether you're insured or not!

129
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,650
Let me drive this car.

130
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,654
It's all right. It's an old wreck, anyway.
It doesn't matter.

131
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,486
You don't understand. This is my car!

132
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,392
- You mean this is your car?
- Of course.

133
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,224
Your golf ball, your car?

134
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,992
Is there anything in the world
that doesn't belong to you?

135
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,499
Yes, thank heaven. You!

136
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,432
Now, don't lose your temper.

137
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,906
Young lady, I'm not losing my temper.
I'm merely trying to play some golf.

138
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,636
You choose the funniest places.
This is a parking lot.

139
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,109
Will you get out of my car?

140
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,840
- Get off my running board.
- This is my running board!

141
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,007
All right, honey, stay there.

142
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,711
Help me!

143
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,843
Don't think everything
in the world is yours.

144
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,945
This is my car, I'll handle it.

145
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,189
If you want to come with me, go ahead.

146
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,327
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!

147
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,438
Good evening, sir.

148
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,208
I'm looking for Mr. Alexander Peabody.
I believe he's dining here.

149
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,079
Mr. Peabody has not arrived yet.

150
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,414
Is that so? Well, I'll just wait.

151
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,386
- Yes, sir.
- Good evening, Louis.

152
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,423
- Good evening, Mr. Brown. Right this way.
- Thank you.

153
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,456
May I check your hat, sir?

154
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,255
- Excuse me?
- Check your hat?

155
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,762
No, I better... Maybe you'd...

156
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,296
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,962
Look at that. I dropped my hat.
I'd better hang on to it.

158
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,933
- Now, watch very carefully.
- I'm watching.

159
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:40,342
I take an olive, I throw it in that glass,
but there it is.

160
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,739
- Now I throw it in that one.
- Wait. Now, without the... Go on.

161
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,976
Watch.

162
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,550
I know what happens. That's wonderful.
You take three, don't you?

163
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,715
Only you cheated.
You can see me take three.

164
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,453
You throw it in the glass.
Take another one, throw it.

165
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,018
- Good!
- And then you do this.

166
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,628
I'm so sorry. Oh, hello.

167
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,367
You're sitting on your hat.

168
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,998
- I know it.
- That's silly. Get up. I'm awfully sorry.

169
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,974
I couldn't be more apologetic, really.

170
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,476
Well, I might have known you were here.

171
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,809
I had a feeling just as I hit the floor.

172
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,541
That was your hat.

173
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,150
Look at it. Look.

174
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,443
Yes, it's too bad, isn't it?

175
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,546
Joe here was showing me a trick,
and the olive got away.

176
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,151
First you drop an olive,
then I sit on my hat. It all fits perfectly.

177
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,957
You can't do that trick
without dropping some of the olives.

178
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,019
It takes practice.

179
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,622
What, to sit on my hat?

180
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,496
No, to drop an olive.

181
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,730
Now, if you're going to be angry with me,
what can I do?

182
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,067
Go away.

183
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,937
No. I was here first.

184
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:47,177
- Then I'll go away.
- What, you...

185
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,394
Won't you just take the olive dish?

186
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,130
No, it's all right.
I'll sit here. You don't mind, do you?

187
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,104
- Not at all.
- This is rather difficult.

188
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,606
- I guess it is.
- Goodness.

189
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,439
Your face is familiar.
Haven't we met somewhere?

190
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,535
Not to my knowledge.

191
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,739
You're wrong. My name's Susan Vance.

192
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,304
I'm Dr. Fritz Lehman.

193
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,210
That's all right. You can sit down.
I don't mind at all.

194
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,345
- You may have heard me lecture.
- What do you lecture about?

195
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:33,381
I usually talk about nervous disorders.
I am a psychiatrist.

196
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,017
Oh, crazy people.

197
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,789
We dislike the use of that word.

198
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,956
All people who behave strangely
are not insane.

199
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,165
Is that so?

200
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,067
Would you mind if I asked your
professional opinion about something?

201
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,504
Not at all.

202
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,304
What would you say about a man
who follows a girl around...

203
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,902
and then when she talks to him,
he fights with her?

204
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,539
Fights with her?
Is the young man your fiancé?

205
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,413
No. I don't know,
I never even saw him before today.

206
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,283
No, he just follows me around
and fights with me.

207
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:07,251
The love impulse in man very frequently
reveals itself in terms of conflict.

208
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,255
The love impulse?

209
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,558
Without my knowing anything about it...

210
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,929
my rough guess would be
that he has a fixation on you. A fixation...

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,231
Wait a minute, I can't remember
more than that. A fixation?

212
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:23,207
"The love impulse in man frequently
reveals itself in terms of conflict."

213
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,970
- That's right.
- I'm eternally grateful to you.

214
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,208
You're absolutely wonderful.
Thank you very much.

215
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,749
Do you know why you're following me?
You're a fixation.

216
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,877
I'm not following you.
I haven't moved from this spot.

217
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,285
Please, you're following me.

218
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,755
Don't be absurd.
Who's always behind whom?

219
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,691
My dear young lady,
I haven't been behind anything...

220
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,628
but what they call the eight ball.
I haven't been all day.

221
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,995
- You're angry, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

222
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,433
The love impulse in man frequently
reveals itself in terms of conflict.

223
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,664
- Excuse me. The what impulse?
- Love impulse.

224
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,638
The trouble with you is that you have a...

225
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,334
Look, all I'm trying to do...

226
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,603
is find the gentleman whom,
thanks to you...

227
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,874
I abandoned on the golf course today.
That's all. Now please go...

228
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,108
Say, this isn't...
Where do you suppose I...

229
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,947
- Hold this a minute. I'll be right back.
- Yes.

230
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,083
Missed.

231
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,985
- I'm sorry I was so long.
- It's quite all right.

232
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,826
I had a very entertaining conversation
with a young lady who does tricks...

233
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,389
with olives when she gets it right.

234
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,196
Fritz, where's my purse?

235
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,861
I thought you had it with you.

236
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,235
No, I left it right here on the table.

237
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,366
- My diamond pin was in it.
- Your diamond pin?

238
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,577
You just lost a diamond pin.
We're going to find it, all right?

239
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,746
- Don't worry about it.
- Excuse me.

240
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,755
Why, there it is. Thank you very much.
It's very kind of you.

241
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,122
- Thank you.
- Why, no.

242
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,990
This is my purse. My diamond pin is in it.

243
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,052
- Will you please...
- No, I'm afraid...

244
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,223
- Give me that.
- Will you please hand it over?

245
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,564
- Do something about it.
- Keep out of it, darling.

246
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,035
- I did the trick.
- You did? Good.

247
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,907
It is madness for you
to say it's not my wife's.

248
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,968
You've made a slight blunder.
This belongs...

249
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,378
There is the young lady.
Isn't this your purse?

250
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,246
- No, this is my purse.
- There you are. Hand it over.

251
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,786
Just a minute.
Didn't you give me this purse to hold?

252
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,482
Yes, that's right, I did.
I gave him the purse to hold.

253
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,820
There's been a mistake. I lost my purse.

254
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,156
I must've picked up your wife's purse
by mistake.

255
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,696
I wanted him to stay here,
so I gave him this purse...

256
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,731
while I went to find mine.
I was coming back.

257
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,859
- Now, that's all perfectly clear, isn't it?
- No, it isn't.

258
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,699
- She's going to give me an explanation.
- No!

259
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,104
My dear sir, it never will be clear
as long as she's explaining it.

260
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,938
- Now please let me go.
- Just a minute.

261
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,170
He's innocent.

262
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,180
Now you have your wife's purse,
I have my purse...

263
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,308
and Louie will explain it all to you
and everything will be all right.

264
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,911
Please listen.
You can't think I did that intentionally.

265
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,650
If I could think,
I'd have run when I saw you.

266
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,989
If you'd only let me explain.
I just gave you my purse to...

267
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,294
You've torn your coat.

268
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,799
Now, I didn't do it on purpose.
That's not right. It's not my fault.

269
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,670
I did it, but I didn't mean to do it.
I just caught hold of your coat.

270
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,141
Will you do something for me?

271
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,267
A needle?

272
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,336
No, it's simpler than that.
Let's play a game.

273
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,910
What?

274
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,443
Watch. I'll put my hand over my eyes,
and then you go away. See?

275
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,988
Then I'll count to 10,
and when I take my hand down...

276
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,217
you will be gone. One...

277
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,261
I like that. I was only trying to be nice.

278
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,859
Thank you.

279
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,021
Just a minute!

280
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,430
You can't talk to me that way
then crawl out of it.

281
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,470
- When I'm mad, I'm mad.
- Something horrible has happened.

282
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,301
Don't tell me about it.
Just get out of it as best you can.

283
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,241
Please stop following me around,
fixation or no fixation. I've had enough.

284
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,280
- Stop talking, so I can tell you...
- Will you stop crowding me?

285
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,475
- I'm just trying to tell you, you've torn...
- No, I didn't.

286
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,417
- Lf you'd waited for my explanation...
- Not my coat...

287
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,011
...your coat would still be very all right.

288
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,926
- What is the matter with you?
- You see, I...

289
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,119
Do you realize you're making
a fool out of yourself?

290
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,758
You can't tell me I tore your coat.
There's such a thing as being fair.

291
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,132
Will you please stop doing that
with your hat?

292
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,262
Just stand there, will you?

293
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,034
What in the world is going on?

294
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,371
- No! Please don't move!
- I've had enough of this.

295
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,344
Listen to me. Let's get out of here.
Just start walking.

296
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,811
So now you want to walk.

297
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,474
Well, I'm quite sure
that I don't want to walk with you.

298
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,747
I hope you realize that you've made
a perfect spectacle of yourself.

299
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,117
Have you finished?

300
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,985
- Yes.
- Thank you.

301
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,492
Don't just stand there. Do something.

302
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,999
Oh, my goodness. Get behind me.

303
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,295
- I am behind you.
- Get closer.

304
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:47,328
I can't get any closer. Are you ready?
Be calm. Left foot first.

305
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,575
- Go straight out the door.
- I have to meet someone here. There he is.

306
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,875
Don't you dare leave me.

307
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,077
I'll be with you in a minute, sir.

308
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:09,253
It's very important that I meet this man
to explain to him what happened...

309
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,888
although if I saw him,
I wouldn't know what to say.

310
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,124
It's perfectly simple.

311
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,224
Tell him you met someone you knew
and were detained.

312
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:20,897
I can picture myself explaining our exit
from the Ritz Plaza to Mr. Peabody.

313
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,064
It's not Boopie that you're trying to see?

314
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,575
No. His name's Peabody.

315
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,441
Alexander Peabody.
But that's Boopie, and I know him well.

316
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,074
I was going to have supper
with him tonight. He'll do anything I ask.

317
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,916
- Let's go to the Ritz and catch him.
- I'd better go there alone.

318
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:39,048
If we miss him there,
we'll go out to Riverdale. There you are.

319
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:43,117
- I couldn't spend that much time.
- Riverdale's only half an hour away.

320
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,926
Yes, but I have to go to Carnegie Hall
to meet Miss Swallow.

321
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,162
- Miss Swallow?
- Yes. I'm engaged to Miss Swallow.

322
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,003
Engaged to be married?

323
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,566
- That's right.
- That's nice.

324
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,904
- Then she won't mind waiting, will she?
- I wouldn't like to...

325
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,502
If I were engaged to you,
I wouldn't mind waiting at all.

326
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,208
- I'd wait for ever.
- But it wouldn't be right.

327
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,621
- I finally got you here, didn't I?
- Yes.

328
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,658
Susan, do they build all the houses
in Riverdale alike?

329
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,165
I don't think so. Why?

330
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:26,637
Because if they don't, we've passed
this one six times in the last hour.

331
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,172
But it was such a lovely night
for a drive. Come on.

332
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,539
Oh, dear.

333
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,444
There aren't any lights.
Mr. Peabody must have gone to bed.

334
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,005
No, he couldn't have gone
to bed this soon. It's early.

335
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,848
If they expected you, they could,
with the covers over their heads.

336
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,481
If you don't stop nagging, I won't help you
arrange matters with Boopie.

337
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,718
I've a feeling it might be better
if you didn't.

338
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,284
- Why?
- I don't think we ought to do this, Susan.

339
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,626
If we wake him up, he'll be irritable.

340
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,099
I don't think it's gonna work,
but I know where Boopie sleeps.

341
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,531
You can't climb
in a man's bedroom window.

342
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,698
I know. It's on the second floor.

343
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,441
Please, it's too late now.
You can't wake him up.

344
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,740
Can't I?

345
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:09,905
What are you doing?

346
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,950
- Pebbles.
- What for?

347
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:15,316
If you throw pebbles against a window,
people think it's hail...

348
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,787
and then they come and close the window.

349
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,730
I know we ought to go now,
but somehow I can't move.

350
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,061
I guess they weren't big enough.

351
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,498
Why not...

352
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,425
What?

353
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,072
- Here's a pip.
- Just a minute!

354
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,975
Jeepers! Let's get out of here.

355
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,651
Don't worry,
everything's going to be all right.

356
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,053
Tomorrow, when Boopie's calmed down,
we'll go and see him together.

357
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,787
Now, just a moment. Don't think
that I don't appreciate all you've done...

358
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,089
It was nothing, David...

359
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,290
Just a moment. But there are limits
to what a man can bear.

360
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,698
Besides, tomorrow afternoon
I'm going to get married.

361
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,037
What for?

362
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:12,509
Because... Anyway, I'm going
to get married, and don't interrupt.

363
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,509
Now, my future wife has always
regarded me as a man of some dignity.

364
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,449
Privately, I'm convinced
that I have some dignity.

365
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,547
Now, it isn't that I don't like you, Susan...

366
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:29,492
because after all, in moments of quiet,
I'm strangely drawn towards you...

367
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,756
but there haven't been
any quiet moments.

368
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,856
Our relationship has been
a series of misadventures...

369
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,457
from beginning to end.

370
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:40,904
So if you don't mind,
I'll see Mr. Peabody alone and unarmed.

371
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:41,962
Without me?

372
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,770
Yes, without you,
and definitely without you.

373
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,004
Now, Susan, I'm going to say goodnight.

374
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,345
And I hope that I never set eyes
on you again. Goodnight.

375
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,361
Yes, I did see Mr. Peabody,
but I didn't see him.

376
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,268
That is, I didn't see him really.

377
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,635
Yes, I spoke to him twice,
but I didn't talk to him.

378
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,836
But I don't understand.
Did you see him or didn't you?

379
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,643
No, I don't know.

380
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,714
How do I know? Because...

381
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,319
There's someone at the door.

382
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,722
You see, there are some things
that are very hard to explain, Alice...

383
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,555
and as soon as I...

384
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,194
Yes, Alice.

385
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,825
Now, Alice,
before we're married this afternoon...

386
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,835
there's one thing we must have clear.

387
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:48,839
I don't want any woman interfering
with my affairs. It's fatal.

388
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,272
That's the stuff, buddy.

389
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,071
- What do you want?
- Dr. Huxley?

390
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,304
Sign here.

391
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,347
Just a minute, Alice.
I have to sign something.

392
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,574
Alice, it's arrived!

393
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,450
The intercostal clavicle.
Yes, isn't that wonderful?

394
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,218
Isn't that a marvelous wedding present?
Thank you.

395
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,486
You see, I'm going to be married
this afternoon.

396
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,687
Don't let it throw you, buddy.

397
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:14,459
Yes, Alice. Yes, isn't it great?

398
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,262
Alice, I'm so excited.

399
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,133
I'll tell you what you do.
You go on down to the museum...

400
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:22,196
and I'll meet you there right away.
Goodbye.

401
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,481
Hello. Oh, it's you.

402
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:38,085
I can't hear very well.
Come closer to the telephone.

403
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,216
I said, "Good morning, David."
Do you want a leopard?

404
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,591
Why should I want a leopard?

405
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,994
For that matter, why should I?
But I've got one.

406
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,261
- Where would you get a leopard?
- I wouldn't get a leopard.

407
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,895
My brother Mark got him.
He's hunting in Brazil and he caught him.

408
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,132
Of course. It's a stuffed leopard.

409
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,701
Of course. Why should my brother
be hunting stuffed leopards in Brazil...

410
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,080
when he can find them right here
in New York?

411
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:11,787
David, it's lucky I met you yesterday,
because you're the only zoologist I know.

412
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,093
Of course I know what a zoologist is.

413
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,595
Get out of here. No, not you, David.

414
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:23,066
Baby, get back into that bathroom.
You're making a nuisance of yourself.

415
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,671
No, not you, David.
No, I want you to come right over.

416
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,206
David, don't be irrelevant.
The point is, I have a leopard.

417
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,402
The question is,
what am I going to do with it?

418
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,742
Susan, I regret to say
the leopard is your problem.

419
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,849
You mean you refuse to help me?
David, you can't do that.

420
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,876
You can't leave me alone with a leopard.
I'll come and get you in my...

421
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,519
Susan! What happened?

422
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,148
Is it the leopard?

423
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,127
No. Nothing happened to me, David,
I just...

424
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,129
I mean, the leopard!

425
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,292
David, the leopard!

426
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,729
Can you hear me, Susan?

427
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,705
Susan, be brave! I'll be right there!

428
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,649
Hold on there, Susan!
Susan! Can you hear me?

429
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,709
I'll be there, Susan!

430
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,338
- You're all right.
- Yes, I'm all right.

431
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,040
- You lied to me!
- No. Just a little.

432
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,140
Telling me a ridiculous story
about a leopard.

433
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,311
- I have a leopard. Right in there.
- Where is it?

434
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,752
- I don't believe you.
- But you have to believe me.

435
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,689
I've been the victim
of your unbridled imagination once more.

436
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,658
Chasing all the way...

437
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,155
That'll teach you to go around
saying things about people.

438
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,133
You've got to get out of this apartment.

439
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,793
But I can't. I have a lease.

440
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,804
You've got to get that thing out of here.

441
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,204
Don't worry, he's all right.
What are you gonna do?

442
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,468
- Call the zoo.
- You can't!

443
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:14,342
That's the meanest thing I ever heard.
He's a pet, he'd be miserable in a zoo.

444
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,845
Listen. From my brother Mark:

445
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,144
"Dear Susan, I'm sending you Baby."
That's Baby.

446
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,081
"Guard him with your life.

447
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,018
"He's three years old, gentle,
and he likes dogs."

448
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:26,922
I don't know whether that means he eats
dogs or is fond of them. Mark's so vague.

449
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:30,393
"He also likes that song, <i>I Can't Give You</i>
<i>Anything but Love, Baby. "</i>

450
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,488
- That's absurd!
- No, it isn't, really. Listen.

451
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,430
This is probably the silliest thing
that ever happened to me.

452
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,265
It's silly but true.
He absolutely adores the tune.

453
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,827
What's the difference?

454
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:44,899
It's silly that he likes such an old tune.
I imagine that down in Brazil...

455
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,145
- Stop this, Susan.
- Let me show him to you.

456
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,671
Don't go near the door! Dear, dear.

457
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,777
Watch, David.
He'll go right toward the music.

458
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,346
Look at that. Isn't this remarkable?

459
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,091
It loves it, David.

460
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,492
If we put the Victrola in the bathroom,
will it go back in?

461
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,522
Yes, but the music sounds better out here.
Besides, he likes it.

462
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,264
Here it comes.

463
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,769
Now go away! Please go away!

464
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,467
I'm gonna get out of here.

465
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,032
Susan, I don't like leopards.

466
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,011
- Just think of him as a house cat.
- I don't like cats either.

467
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,072
- Stand still. Don't be nervous.
- Make him stand still!

468
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,210
Don't be silly.
You can't make a leopard stand still.

469
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,150
Do something. Turn off that Victrola.

470
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:34,350
I don't think it's the music. I think it's you.

471
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,556
I think you've found a real friend.
Isn't it affectionate, like a baby kitten?

472
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,396
I never saw anything take such a liking
to anyone. It'd follow you anywhere.

473
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,594
We'll have no trouble
taking it to Connecticut.

474
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,500
My farm in Westlake, Connecticut.

475
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,869
I'm not going to Westlake, Connecticut.

476
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,670
I will not be involved
in any more harebrained schemes.

477
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,906
Imagine Aunt Elizabeth coming here
and running smack into a leopard.

478
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,880
That would be an end to my $1 million.

479
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,884
If you had an aunt who was going to give
you $1 million and she found a leopard...

480
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,318
- in your apartment, what would you do?
- I don't know.

481
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,514
You have to help me.

482
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:09,356
There are only two things I have to do,
finish my brontosaurus and get married.

483
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,585
Go on, quitter.

484
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,823
It's no good calling me names,
because I won't argue with you anymore.

485
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,368
I don't want anything to do with a leopard.

486
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,068
Go on, Baby, down the stairs.

487
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,193
Good morning.

488
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,836
- Good morning, Professor.
- Good morning.

489
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,937
You'd better change your mind
about coming to Connecticut.

490
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,176
Susan, we settled that question
once and for all.

491
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,818
But what about my leopard?

492
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,643
That's your problem.

493
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,518
It's not all my problem.

494
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,648
Susan, will you please go away?

495
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:17,684
All right. Since he likes you so much,
I've decided to give him to you.

496
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,389
I won't take him.

497
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,029
You've got him.

498
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,633
Don't go away! I've got the leopard!

499
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,171
Oh, dear, look at that.

500
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,211
No, David,
all I was doing was driving along.

501
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,578
You were standing on the sidewalk yelling,
and looking very silly.

502
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,413
You know very well
you tricked me into this trip.

503
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,620
Look. Eating your car.

504
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,249
Look at the road!

505
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,288
I have a feeling
something horrible is going to happen.

506
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,852
Everything's going to be all right.

507
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,831
I don't care anymore.

508
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,435
Hello. What's the matter,
did you get lonely?

509
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,338
Susan, if you know any shortcuts,
please take them.

510
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,342
We'll be there in no time.

511
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,902
I just want to deliver this leopard,
take the first train back to town...

512
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,073
and forget
the last 24 hours ever happened.

513
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:15,017
Now, what's wrong with the last 24 hours?
I've had a wonderful time.

514
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,453
Susan, I don't know.
You look at everything upside down.

515
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,457
I've never known anyone quite like you.

516
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,390
You've just had a bad day, that's all.

517
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,758
That's a masterpiece of understatement.

518
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,957
Look, I can't discuss anything with you...

519
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,592
with Baby breathing
down the back of my neck.

520
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:35,097
Get down. Go on. Now lie down.

521
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,940
Susan, duck!

522
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,153
Never hang on to a leopard's tail!

523
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,387
Sing, David!

524
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,902
Anyway, I still insist that he was
right in the middle of the road.

525
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,570
I've never hit anything
that was in the right place.

526
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,705
That wagon was on the side of the road.

527
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,113
It was straight ahead of me.
That's why I hit it.

528
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,119
- What time is it?
- We'll be there in no time.

529
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,951
We just have to stop at Westlake
and get some meat for Baby.

530
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,655
Why, he's already had an assortment
of ducks and chickens.

531
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,456
Not to mention a couple of swans.

532
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,996
All feathers.

533
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,656
Yeah, very expensive feathers.

534
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:38,190
I don't see how any pair of swans
could cost $150. That was a gyp.

535
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:42,000
If you'd run, as I told you to,
we shouldn't have had to pay for them.

536
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:45,338
Susan, when a man is wrestling a leopard
in the middle of a pond...

537
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,537
he's in no position to run.

538
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,014
There it is, David. Please hurry up.

539
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,289
Why, of all places,
when you have a leopard in the car...

540
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,423
did you stop in a town
where there's a circus?

541
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:12,299
I didn't stop because there's a circus,
but Baby's going to be hungry.

542
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,237
Please hurry.
If Baby wakes up, we'll be in trouble.

543
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:19,470
I don't suppose it will make any difference,
but you're parked in front of a fireplug.

544
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,674
I know it. Don't worry.
I'll take care of everything. You go ahead.

545
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,716
50c, $1.00. Thank you.

546
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,153
Yes. What can I do for you?

547
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,056
I want 30 pounds of sirloin steak, please.

548
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,821
Did you say 30 pounds?

549
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,228
- Yes, that's right, 30 pounds.
- How will you have it cut?

550
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,028
- Just in one piece.
- You going to roast it or broil it?

551
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,763
- It's going to be eaten raw.
- Yeah.

552
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,345
Hey, lady. That's a fireplug.

553
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,445
I know it.

554
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,046
- It's against the law to park alongside one.
- I know it.

555
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,183
- Come here.
- Who, me? Why?

556
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,125
I am Constable Slocum.

557
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,462
Is that so?

558
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,801
- How do you do? I'm Susan Vance.
- How do you do?

559
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:22,101
I don't care who you are, I just want you
to know you can't park beside a fireplug.

560
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:25,267
- I was just watching the parade.
- You were?

561
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,208
I suppose you get free seats to the circus.

562
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,441
Elmer and I usually get a...
That has nothing to do with it.

563
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,176
I'm just going to give you a ticket.

564
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,810
Thank you very much.
I'd love to go to the circus...

565
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,616
but you better keep your tickets
because I'm busy tonight.

566
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,590
Yeah? Well, it ain't that kind of a ticket.

567
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:43,816
Jeepers.

568
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,092
Young lady, it might interest you
to know that you're under arrest.

569
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,065
Oh, well. I mean, why?

570
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,599
For parking alongside of a fireplug.

571
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,467
I'm not parked next to a fireplug.

572
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,700
Yeah? What do you call that?

573
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,339
You mean that you think
that this is my car?

574
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,400
Ain't it?

575
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,447
No. That's my car.

576
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,846
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

577
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,578
You didn't ask me.

578
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,783
Say, do you grind this up
before you eat it?

579
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,453
This isn't for me. It's for Baby.

580
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,790
For who?

581
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,561
Hurry up, Baby. Get in!

582
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:24,931
- But...
- Jump on!

583
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,493
That isn't your car!

584
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,300
No, but it's my leopard!

585
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,801
- Wait a minute! That's my car!
- What are you yelling about?

586
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:36,438
They stole my car. Last night,
she tried to steal my wife's purse.

587
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,244
Don't stand there.
Do something! Catch them!

588
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,842
Well, Elmer, bless me. Bring back that car!

589
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:47,790
<i>- I'm glad we finally got here</i>
<i>- Isn't it wonderful?</i>

590
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:50,759
<i>We could put him in that box</i>
<i>Wait, don't open the door</i>

591
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:54,456
<i>- until you close those</i>
<i>- I think that is a good idea, too</i>

592
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:56,556
<i>I hope he won't get out</i>

593
00:33:57,901 --> 00:34:00,165
<i>Stand by that door, and I'll open this one</i>

594
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:02,797
<i>He'll just walk along, I hope</i>

595
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,736
<i>Come on, Baby. Go on</i>

596
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:08,243
<i>In the stall, Baby</i>

597
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:11,144
<i>Come on, baby,</i>
<i>right in there, right in there</i>

598
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:13,382
<i>Right in there</i>

599
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,613
<i>Now everything is quite all right</i>

600
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:18,586
<i>No, everything is not all</i>

601
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:23,650
Everything is not all right, Susan. Maybe
for you, but I've got to get to New York.

602
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:27,493
Now one thing's settled,
you start worrying about something else.

603
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:31,295
One of us should worry!
On top of all this, we've stolen a car!

604
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:34,166
That's all right.
I'll send it back. I don't like it, anyway.

605
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:37,673
I suppose you'd like me to leave it
with the constable on my way back.

606
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:40,335
No, you might be arrested.
Besides, it's a hot car.

607
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,742
You're going to file
the numbers off the engine.

608
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:45,941
No, I'll have the gardener take it back
after it's dark.

609
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:47,912
- Stop it!
- You're shedding.

610
00:34:47,984 --> 00:34:49,576
Now, where's the telephone?

611
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:51,848
- Out that door.
- That's all I want to know.

612
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,412
What I want to suggest is...

613
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:57,051
I don't want any more suggestions
from you. My fiancée is waiting for me.

614
00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:59,561
In order to get married,
I have to get to New York.

615
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:02,359
I want you to be married,
I think you should be married.

616
00:35:02,432 --> 00:35:06,232
I think every man should be.
But I don't think any girl will marry you...

617
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:08,294
- Iooking the way you do.
- Where's the phone?

618
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:11,204
- In there, but look at yourself.
- What's the matter with me?

619
00:35:11,274 --> 00:35:12,434
I am dirty, aren't I?

620
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:14,739
You see? What I want to suggest is...

621
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:17,279
The only way I'll follow
another of your suggestions...

622
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:20,441
is if you hold a bright object
in front of my eyes and twirl it.

623
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:22,678
I understand. I simply wanted to suggest...

624
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,482
I don't want any suggestions.
I just want to clean up.

625
00:35:25,555 --> 00:35:26,886
Where is there a shower?

626
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:29,482
That's what I was going to suggest,
a shower.

627
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:54,876
- Hannah.
- Yes, Miss Susan?

628
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:57,579
Send these into town
and have them cleaned and pressed.

629
00:35:57,654 --> 00:36:00,680
- Why? I can do them here.
- Don't argue with me, Hannah.

630
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,622
Into town.
Have them cleaned and pressed.

631
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:04,660
It'll take a lot longer.

632
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:07,363
There's no hurry, no hurry at all.

633
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:18,037
- Hurry up, David.
- I am hurrying.

634
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:23,272
- David.
- What?

635
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:25,940
- What's in the box?
- What did you say?

636
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:29,844
That's the intercostal clavicle
of a brontosaurus.

637
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:31,381
Really?

638
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:33,589
It's just an old bone.

639
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:35,682
Yes, it's just an old bone.

640
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:37,693
Put it down gently and go away.

641
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:41,026
All right.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

642
00:36:41,164 --> 00:36:43,257
Hand me my clothes, will you?

643
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,301
They aren't here. They're being pressed.

644
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:48,394
- What?
- The gardener's taken them into town.

645
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:51,406
For what? Stop him. I can't wait.
I must leave immediately.

646
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:52,941
You can't leave without clothes.

647
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,807
I know that. Where are you going?

648
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:57,676
I'm going to take a shower.

649
00:36:57,847 --> 00:36:59,940
Susan! Don't leave me here like this!

650
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:01,847
Don't be impatient, David.

651
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:05,479
We'll talk it over after I've finished.
Everything's going to be all right.

652
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:07,648
"Everything's going to be all right."

653
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:09,817
Certainly, everything's going
to be all right.

654
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:13,659
Everything's going to be...
I'm losing my mind, that's all.

655
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,392
Roaming around Connecticut
without any clothes on.

656
00:37:16,466 --> 00:37:19,833
I don't believe it. How can all these things
happen to just one person?

657
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:23,031
Susan, where are you?

658
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,471
Will you come out and help me find some
clothes or must I come in and get you?

659
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:28,704
You wouldn't.

660
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:30,336
Yes, I would!

661
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,541
Maybe I wouldn't.

662
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,608
- Susan, where's the gardener's room?
- Why?

663
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:39,121
- Because he must have some clothes.
- What? I can't hear you.

664
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:42,317
- You can hear what you want to hear!
- What did you say?

665
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:45,657
I just said... Never mind.
I'll find the place myself.

666
00:37:46,196 --> 00:37:48,494
The gardener must have clothes.
Clothes are clothes.

667
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:49,827
The gardener's in town.

668
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:52,094
He couldn't have taken all his clothes
with him!

669
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:53,157
Yes, he could.

670
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:56,069
Of all the conceited,
spoiled little scatterbrains.

671
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:58,130
My goodness, the man who gets...

672
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:02,277
The man who gets you
is gonna have a lifetime of misery!

673
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:04,813
"Everything's going to be all right."

674
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:06,212
What do you want?

675
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:08,274
Who are you?

676
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:10,285
- Who are you?
- What do you want?

677
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:12,048
Who are you?

678
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:14,454
I don't know. I'm not quite myself today.

679
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:17,084
You look perfectly idiotic in those clothes.

680
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,957
These aren't my clothes.

681
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,963
Where are your clothes?

682
00:38:21,398 --> 00:38:22,831
I've lost my clothes.

683
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:25,197
But why are you wearing these clothes?

684
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:29,432
Because I just went gay all of a sudden!
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

685
00:38:29,506 --> 00:38:33,203
Now, young man. Stop this nonsense.
What are you doing?

686
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:38,077
I'm sitting in the middle of 42nd Street
waiting for a bus.

687
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,114
Go away!

688
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:48,987
- Who is this man?
- I don't know.

689
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:52,495
- Stop it, George! What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

690
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:56,359
Susan, come back here. Stop it, George!

691
00:38:57,734 --> 00:39:02,364
Aunt Elizabeth, it's you!
I've never been so thrilled in my life.

692
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:05,966
This is amazing to see you here,
and George dear.

693
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:09,239
- What made you come out here?
- Quiet, George!

694
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,440
Now, stop gushing
and tell me, who is this man?

695
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:16,877
- Where'd you get him?
- He's a friend of Mark's.

696
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:18,716
- What's he doing here?
- Susan brought me.

697
00:39:18,788 --> 00:39:20,255
I don't doubt it, but why?

698
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:21,312
I got a letter from Mark.

699
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:25,691
He said David was an old friend of his.
He'd been working very hard in town...

700
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:28,822
and was on the point
of having a nervous breakdown.

701
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:29,887
I'm a nut from Brazil.

702
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:32,434
He's very excitable.
We let him do whatever he wants.

703
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:35,130
- Where are his clothes?
- Susan took them.

704
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:38,299
- What's he doing in that thing?
- Mark said he should be allowed...

705
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:41,708
to wear a negligee. No telling what'll
happen if he's not allowed to.

706
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:43,268
Does he want to wear those clothes?

707
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:47,305
No, I don't want to wear this thing.
I just want to get married!

708
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:50,945
Susan, I forbid it!
I absolutely put my foot down. The idea!

709
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:05,625
- Quiet!
- Please listen to me!

710
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:07,761
- Quiet!
- Don't talk so much.

711
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,769
Perhaps you could help me.

712
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:18,946
Perhaps you could help me
find some clothes.

713
00:40:19,616 --> 00:40:20,947
Why, yes.

714
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:24,778
There must be some of Mark's things
around somewhere.

715
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:27,416
- Aren't there some...
- Are there?

716
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,549
Well...

717
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,320
Yes. There are some
in Mr. Mark's room, sir.

718
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:36,194
- Yes, sir.
- Which is Mr. Mark's room?

719
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,432
It's the end, sir. Yes, sir.

720
00:40:39,502 --> 00:40:41,299
Thank you.

721
00:40:44,908 --> 00:40:46,739
Go away.

722
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:58,285
He loves me. He loves me not.

723
00:40:58,621 --> 00:41:00,646
David! Where'd he go?

724
00:41:00,723 --> 00:41:02,156
He went to get some clothes.

725
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:06,321
If he gets clothes, he'll go away.
He's the only man I've ever loved.

726
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:08,864
David! What will I do without David?

727
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:11,366
Stop. Get away from me.

728
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:18,464
George, please be quiet.

729
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,159
- David?
- What?

730
00:41:39,229 --> 00:41:41,663
- Can I come in?
- I don't care what you do!

731
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:44,700
- Thanks. Where are you?
- Here I am. What do you want?

732
00:41:45,802 --> 00:41:46,791
Go on and laugh.

733
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,304
I know it looks ridiculous,
but I'm past caring.

734
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:51,033
What are you going to do?

735
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:53,598
What I've been trying to do,
get back to New York!

736
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:55,667
You can't go dressed that way.

737
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:58,771
They're all I could find,
and clothes are clothes. I'm going.

738
00:41:58,848 --> 00:42:00,076
I'm going back to New York...

739
00:42:00,149 --> 00:42:03,676
if only to repair the damage
that's been done since I've known you.

740
00:42:03,753 --> 00:42:07,280
The damage to Miss Swallow,
the museum, Mr. Peabody and everybody...

741
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:09,484
Mr. Peabody? But, David...

742
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:12,585
the one way to get to Mr. Peabody
is through Aunt Elizabeth.

743
00:42:12,662 --> 00:42:15,893
Please listen for one second.
He'll do anything she tells him to.

744
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:18,763
He'll even like you.
He's Aunt Elizabeth's lawyer.

745
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:21,030
He's her lawyer. Mr. Peabody.

746
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:24,533
- What's your aunt's name?
- Elizabeth.

747
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:26,404
- But she has another name.
- Of course.

748
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:27,909
Never mind. Don't tell me.

749
00:42:27,977 --> 00:42:30,810
Why not? It's Random.
Mrs. Carleton Random.

750
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,940
- Yes, I know. I knew that was coming.
- What's the matter?

751
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:38,454
Out of seven million people,
why did I have to run into you yesterday?

752
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:40,847
What have I done?

753
00:42:40,924 --> 00:42:44,792
Susan, Mrs. Random is going
to give away $1 million.

754
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:46,123
I know.

755
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:48,763
I wanted it for the museum.

756
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:55,801
I'm afraid you've made a rather
unfavorable impression on Aunt Elizabeth.

757
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:57,669
I quite realize that.

758
00:42:59,509 --> 00:43:01,409
- Susan, listen to me.
- What?

759
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:05,345
A lot of things have happened but
we'll forget them because this is serious.

760
00:43:05,415 --> 00:43:06,848
What, David?

761
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:11,443
Can you concentrate for just a moment?
There's only one thing to be done.

762
00:43:11,654 --> 00:43:14,589
And this is important to me
and to my work.

763
00:43:14,657 --> 00:43:15,681
What?

764
00:43:15,758 --> 00:43:18,591
You're so good-looking
without your glasses.

765
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:22,495
- Listen to me. Try and remember.
- What?

766
00:43:22,565 --> 00:43:25,329
I've made a horrible mess of things.

767
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:29,462
Your aunt must never find out who I am.
You do understand, don't you?

768
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:31,166
Yes, David.

769
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,676
You can tell her that I'm Mark's friend
and I have bats in the belfry...

770
00:43:34,744 --> 00:43:38,043
but don't ever tell her my name.
Can you remember that?

771
00:43:38,114 --> 00:43:39,911
- Yes, David.
- You're sure?

772
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:43,646
Yes, David. But you are good-looking
without your glasses.

773
00:43:44,687 --> 00:43:46,086
Never mind, Susan.

774
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:48,180
What did I say?

775
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:50,657
What did I do? What did I say?

776
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:54,459
- What did I do?
- I just asked you to remember...

777
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,021
- I swear I'll remember...
- Where is it?

778
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,625
- I know exactly what you told me to say.
- Where is it?

779
00:43:59,702 --> 00:44:00,691
Where's what?

780
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,931
- My intercostal clavicle.
- Your what?

781
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:06,169
My bone. It's rare. It's precious.
What did you do with it?

782
00:44:06,242 --> 00:44:07,470
Your bone?

783
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:10,011
- You had it. Give it to me.
- I haven't got it.

784
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,742
- Did you carry it somewhere?
- Why would I carry a bone around?

785
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:16,842
I wouldn't dare give a reason
for anything you do.

786
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:19,649
I guess you'll have to find another one.

787
00:44:19,722 --> 00:44:22,691
It took three expeditions
and five years to find that one!

788
00:44:22,759 --> 00:44:26,661
Now that they know where to find one,
couldn't you send them back for another?

789
00:44:26,729 --> 00:44:29,425
Susan, you had it.
You took it out of the box.

790
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:32,400
- Where did you put it?
- I put it back in the box.

791
00:44:32,468 --> 00:44:36,370
- Was there somebody else in the room?
- There was nobody else, but...

792
00:44:37,073 --> 00:44:38,506
- George.
- Who's George?

793
00:44:38,574 --> 00:44:42,169
The dog. Don't you see? Dog, bone.

794
00:44:44,747 --> 00:44:46,112
- George!
- George!

795
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:50,946
Stop it! You sound like an echo.

796
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,544
- George!
- Nice George.

797
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:57,617
Did you see him?

798
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,854
- See who?
- George.

799
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:00,896
Are those the only clothes you could find?

800
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:03,932
Come back here this minute.
What are you doing?

801
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,092
- Hunting for George.
- Why?

802
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:07,693
David wants him.
David thinks he's such a nice dog.

803
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,431
George? He's a fiend, and you know it.

804
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:11,769
- But David doesn't.
- Come here!

805
00:45:17,947 --> 00:45:21,144
He's definitely not in the house.
That's settled.

806
00:45:22,952 --> 00:45:26,251
Don't do that. He knows you want him.
He'll hide.

807
00:45:26,322 --> 00:45:28,222
Susan, where's he apt to go?

808
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:31,783
- George is apt to go anywhere.
- No. Where does he hide things?

809
00:45:31,928 --> 00:45:34,419
- How can I tell?
- You ought to know.

810
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,427
There he is! George!

811
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:41,093
My goodness, look at his nose.
He's been digging. He's buried it.

812
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,365
There are 26 acres in this garden.

813
00:45:43,439 --> 00:45:46,875
That's awful.
George, where did you hide that bone?

814
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:50,845
No, David, not that way.
Now, George, we're not angry.

815
00:45:50,913 --> 00:45:52,881
David and Susan need that bone.

816
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:55,713
It's a nasty old bone,
it's hundreds of years old.

817
00:45:55,785 --> 00:45:57,878
That's David's bone.

818
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:02,388
Susan will get you a nice, fresh bone
if you'll show us where it is.

819
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:05,689
- Look at the nasty little cur!
- You'll ruin everything. Spell it.

820
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:08,890
George, don't be stubborn.
Susan loves you.

821
00:46:08,965 --> 00:46:12,298
Where'd you put it? Don't you remember?
Where'd you dig?

822
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:14,962
He's not paying attention... George!

823
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,800
It's easy if you know how to handle him.

824
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:22,276
Everything's going to be all right.
This must be the spot.

825
00:46:22,345 --> 00:46:26,714
He's going to start digging in a minute.
That's right, George.

826
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:31,243
- It's very simple if you keep your head.
- I do hope he doesn't hurt that bone.

827
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,652
Isn't he a strong little man, David?

828
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,452
He's got something! Come on, dig.

829
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:38,619
- Dig.
- I'm digging.

830
00:46:38,694 --> 00:46:40,628
I feel something!

831
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:42,493
I hope it isn't hurt.

832
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:45,096
Look, David, a boot.

833
00:46:45,434 --> 00:46:47,800
- A boot.
- Don't hit George, David.

834
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,462
I wasn't going to hit George.

835
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:52,440
George, that was fine,
but you've got to concentrate again.

836
00:46:52,508 --> 00:46:55,443
David has to find his bone.
No. Not in there.

837
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,343
- Isn't this fun? Just like a game.
- Yes.

838
00:47:00,983 --> 00:47:04,146
George, if you get tired of digging
you just tell David and Susan...

839
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,654
where you hid it, and they'll dig.

840
00:47:08,624 --> 00:47:11,889
Susan, do you think
George is really trying?

841
00:47:12,094 --> 00:47:15,427
Almost every place he's taken us,
we've found something.

842
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:18,228
- There's nothing here.
- Look, David, another boot.

843
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:20,735
Another boot. That makes three pairs.

844
00:47:20,803 --> 00:47:22,896
Come on, George, quit stalling.
Where is it?

845
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:24,963
Don't be discouraged.

846
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:27,566
George, concentrate. Bones, not boots.

847
00:47:27,643 --> 00:47:29,474
- There he goes.
- See? He's got the idea.

848
00:47:29,545 --> 00:47:33,276
- I'm getting tired of all this digging.
- Yes, what we need is a plow.

849
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,319
- Susan?
- Jeepers, it's Aunt Elizabeth.

850
00:47:37,386 --> 00:47:39,581
Follow him, David, don't let him get away!

851
00:47:41,123 --> 00:47:42,852
Yes, Aunty, I'm coming.

852
00:47:42,925 --> 00:47:47,123
Susan, what on earth are you doing?
What are all these?

853
00:47:47,196 --> 00:47:48,754
Those? They're holes.

854
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:51,857
I can see they're holes.
How did they get here?

855
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:54,869
David and George and I were digging.

856
00:47:54,937 --> 00:47:57,667
- Who is this David?
- He's a friend of Mark's.

857
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,834
- Is that all you know about him?
- I know I'm going to marry him.

858
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,275
He doesn't know it, but I am.

859
00:48:02,345 --> 00:48:05,280
If you're planning to marry him
on my money, you're mistaken.

860
00:48:05,348 --> 00:48:08,044
I don't want another lunatic in my family,
I've got enough.

861
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:10,347
When are you going to marry him?
What's his name?

862
00:48:10,419 --> 00:48:12,887
It's Bone.

863
00:48:12,955 --> 00:48:14,650
- Bones?
- One Bone.

864
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:18,387
One bone or two, it's a ridiculous name.
What does he do?

865
00:48:19,395 --> 00:48:20,384
He hunts.

866
00:48:20,463 --> 00:48:22,192
Hunts? Hunts what?
