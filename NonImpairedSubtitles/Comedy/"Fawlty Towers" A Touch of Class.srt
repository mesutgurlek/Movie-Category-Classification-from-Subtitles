00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:17,518
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it!:D

3
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,068
One double room without bath
for the 16th, 17th and 18th.

4
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,362
Yes, and if you'd be so good
as to confirm by letter?

5
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,322
Thank you so much,
goodbye.

6
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,282
Have you made up the bill
for room 12, Basil?

7
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,367
No, I haven't
yet, no.

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,660
Well, they're
in a hurry,

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,454
Polly says they didn't
get their alarm call.

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,914
And Basil, please get
that picture up,

11
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:39,998
it's been there
for a week.

12
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,708
It's been there
since Monday, Sybil.

13
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,086
Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday,

14
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:48,173
Good morning.
Friday, Sat...

15
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,095
Manuel!

16
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,890
There is too much butter
on those trays.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,933
Que?

18
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,395
There is too much butter
on those trays.

19
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,272
- No, no, no, Senor!
- What?

20
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,941
Not "on those trays. "

21
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,153
No Sir, "Uno dos tres. "
Uno, dos, tres.

22
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,448
No, no.
Hay mucho burro alli!

23
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:14,700
Que?

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,743
Hay mucho
burro alli!

25
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,537
Ah, mantequilla!

26
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,621
What? Que?

27
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,750
Mantequilla.
Burro is... is hee-haw.

28
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,586
What?

29
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,046
Burro... burro is
hee-haw, hee-haw.

30
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,840
Manuel, por favor.
Uno momento.

31
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,049
Si, si, si.

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,092
What's the
matter, Basil?

33
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,135
Nothing, dear,
I'm just dealing with it.

34
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,345
He speak good...
how do you say...?

35
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,388
English!

36
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,975
Mantequilla,
solamente, dos.

37
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,519
Dos?

38
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,105
Well, don't look at me,
you're supposed to be able to speak it.

39
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,565
Two pieces!

40
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:51,570
Two each!
Arriba, arriba!

41
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,989
I don't know why you
wanted to hire him, Basil.

42
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,991
Because he's cheap
and keen to learn, dear.

43
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,951
And in this day
and age such...

44
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,786
But why did you say you
could speak the language?

45
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,288
I learned
classical Spanish,

46
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,416
not the strange dialect he
seems to have picked up.

47
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,918
It'd be quicker to
train a monkey.

48
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,253
Good morning, Miss Gatsby.
Morning, Miss Tibbs.

49
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:12,007
Good morning,
good morning.

50
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,802
- Basil!
- Yes, dear?

51
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:16,929
Are you going to
hang the picture?

52
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,847
- Yes I am, dear.
- When?

53
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,224
When I've-
when I've...

54
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,725
Well, why don't
you do it now?

55
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,185
Well, I'm doing this, dear,
I'm doing the menu.

56
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,478
You've got all morning
to do the menu.

57
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,356
Why don't you hang
the picture now?

58
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,441
- Well?
- Yes, all right,

59
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,527
I don't think you realize
how long it takes to do the menu,

60
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:32,819
it doesn't matter,
I'll hang the picture now.

61
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,655
If the menus are late for lunch,
it doesn't matter,

62
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,075
the guests can look at the picture
till they are ready, right?

63
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,786
Lower.

64
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,454
Lower.

65
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,039
Up a bit.

66
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,458
- There!
- Thank you, dear.

67
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,460
I don't know where
I'd be without you.

68
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,131
In the land of
the living, probably.

69
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,176
Yes?

70
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,637
Uh, could we have
our bill please?

71
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,847
Well, can you
wait a minute?

72
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,266
Right, I'm afraid we're
a bit late for our train,

73
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,142
we didn't get
our alarm call.

74
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,645
Right.

75
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,021
I was up at 5:00,
you know,

76
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,107
we do have
staff problems,

77
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,775
I'm so sorry,
it's not all done by magic.

78
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,235
Basil, are you
doing the menu?

79
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,361
No, I'm not doing
the menu, dear.

80
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,406
I am doing the bill for these
charming people who are in a hurry.

81
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,449
I'm sorry to cause
all this trouble,

82
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,827
but the reason we're late
is we didn't get our alarm call.

83
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,495
Oh, dear, I am sorry.

84
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,205
Basil, why didn't they
get their alarm call?

85
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,415
Because I forgot.

86
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,127
I am so sorry
I am not perfect!

87
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,503
There you are,
there's the bill.

88
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,546
Perhaps you'd
pay my wife,

89
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,839
I have to put
the picture up...

90
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,133
If there aren't any dustbins
to be cleaned out...

91
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,053
Newspapers!

92
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:49,062
Goodbye.
See you again!

93
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,815
Don't forget
the picture, Basil.

94
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,025
I won't, dear,
leave it to me.

95
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,193
I'm going out now.

96
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:57,029
I expect it to up
when I come back.

97
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,406
Drive carefully, dear.

98
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,658
Good morning, Major.

99
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:02,826
Morning, Fawlty.

100
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,494
I do apologize for the
tardiness of the arrival

101
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,079
of your newspaper
this morning, Major.

102
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,247
I will speak to them again,

103
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,290
see if something
can be done.

104
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,000
Ah, more strikes.

105
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,752
Dustmen, post office...

106
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,212
It makes you want to cry,
doesn't it?

107
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,505
What's happened to
the old idea

108
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,840
of doing something for your
fellow man, of service?

109
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,926
- I mean, today...
- Mr. Fawlty?

110
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,637
Yes, I'm coming!
Wait a moment!

111
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,472
They treat you like dirt,
you know?

112
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:24,932
Of course it's
pure ignorance,

113
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,267
but with the class of
guests one gets nowadays...

114
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,310
Ah! D'olivera
made a hundred!

115
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,937
Did he?
Did he really?

116
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,772
Good for him,
good old dolly.

117
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,357
Well, well, well...

118
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,566
Thank you, Polly.

119
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,778
We're only staying
till Sunday!

120
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,990
Right, thank you.

121
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,182
Ah, I thought you were
going out, dear.

122
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,685
What's this?

123
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,062
I decided, Sybil,
to advertise.

124
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,313
How much
did it cost?

125
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,274
Oh, I haven't... 15?

126
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,610
- Forty.
- Forty.

127
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,821
I have told you
where we advertise.

128
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,531
Sybil, I know
the hotel business.

129
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,657
No you don't, Basil.

130
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,534
Sybil, we've got to
try and attract

131
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,910
a better class of person.

132
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,953
Why?

133
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,788
We're losing tone.

134
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:30,831
We're making money.

135
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,041
- Yes, yes.
- Just.

136
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,960
Yes, but now we can
try and build up

137
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,004
a higher class of clientele!

138
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,964
Turn away some
of the riffraff.

139
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,883
So long as they pay
their bills, Basil.

140
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,385
Is that all that matters to you?
Money?

141
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,637
This advertisement
is a waste of £-40.

142
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:50,392
One moment!
One moment, please!

143
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,019
- Well?
- Well?

144
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,313
My dear woman, Sir Richard
and Lady Morris,

145
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,772
arriving this evening.
For two nights.

146
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,983
You see, they saw our
advertisement in country life.

147
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,276
I wish they were
staying a week.

148
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,153
- Well, so do I.
- Might pay for the ad then.

149
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,738
Sybil, look!

150
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,282
If we can attract
this class of customer,

151
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,867
I mean, the sky's
the limit!

152
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,411
Basil, 22 rooms
is the limit!

153
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,914
I mean, have you seen
the people in room six?

154
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,625
They've never even
sat on chairs before.

155
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:19,755
They are the commonest,
vulgarest, most...

156
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,392
Allo!

157
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,771
Got a room?

158
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,814
I beg your pardon?

159
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,817
Got a room
for tonight, mate?

160
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:41,985
I shall have
to see, sir...

161
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,029
- A single?
- Yeah.

162
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,950
No, make it a double,
I feel lucky today!

163
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,871
- Hello.
- Good morning.

164
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,083
Only joking.

165
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,251
- No, we haven't.
- What?

166
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,669
Haven't any rooms.
Good day.

167
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,546
Number seven is
free, Basil.

168
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,881
Mr. Tone is in
number seven, dear.

169
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,592
No, he left while you were
putting the picture up, Basil.

170
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,302
You have
luggage, Sir?

171
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:08,345
Just one case.

172
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:13,058
In the car...
The white sports.

173
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,560
Fill this in,
would you, Sir?

174
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,938
If you can.

175
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,234
Hope you enjoy
your stay, Mr. Brown.

176
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,361
Uh, Manuel,
would you fetch

177
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,364
this gentleman's case
from the car outside?

178
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,450
Take it to room seven?

179
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,369
- Is not easy for me.
- What?

180
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,204
Is not easy for me...
entender

181
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,998
It's not easy for
you to understand.

182
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,500
Manuel... we're
training him.

183
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,503
He's from Barcelona.

184
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,504
In Spain.

185
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,798
Obtener la valisa...

186
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,467
- Que?
- La valisa en el,

187
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:51,388
er, auto
bianco sportiv.

188
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,015
Y... a la sala...

189
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,768
Siete... por favor.

190
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:58,937
Pronto.

191
00:07:59,188 --> 00:07:59,980
Is impossible.

192
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,398
- What?
- Is impossible.

193
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,858
Look, it's
perfectly simple!

194
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:06,570
Manuel-sirvase buscar mi
equipaje que esta en el

195
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,407
automovil blanco y lo traer
a la sala numero siete.

196
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,492
Senor
habla espanol!

197
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,536
Solo un poco,
lo siento.

198
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,663
Pero he
olvidado mucho.

199
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:17,789
No, no,
habla muy bien.

200
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,875
Muy muy bien.
Formidable!

201
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:20,959
Gracias, gracias.

202
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,921
Lo voy a
coger ahora.

203
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,550
Well, if there's
anything else,

204
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,260
I'm sure Manuel will
be able to tell you,

205
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,347
as you seem to get on
so well together.

206
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,183
Key?

207
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:02,251
Hello, dear, just
doing the picture.

208
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,129
Don't forget
the menu.

209
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,798
I beg your pardon?

210
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,550
Don't forget the menu.

211
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,634
I thought you
said you wanted...

212
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,470
Right!
I'll do the menu.

213
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,098
You could have had
them both done by now

214
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,182
if you hadn't spent
the whole morning

215
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,309
skulking in there
listening to that racket.

216
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,936
Racket?

217
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:28,318
That's Brahms!
Brahms's Third racket!

218
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,281
The whole morning?

219
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,534
I had two bars.

220
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,660
Ready to order?

221
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,496
Uh, yeah.
What's a gralefrit?

222
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,622
Grapefruit.

223
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:44,668
And creme pot...
Pot rouge?

224
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,128
Portugaise.
Tomato soup.

225
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,379
I'll have the gralefrit.

226
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:52,593
Now balm carousel... Lamb?

227
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:53,635
Casserole.

228
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:54,845
Sounds good.
Does it come with a smile?

229
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,597
It comes with
sprouts or carrots.

230
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:57,806
Oh, smile's extra, is it?

231
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,351
You'll get one if you
eat up all your sprouts.

232
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,813
Waiter!

233
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,363
I beg your pardon?

234
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,489
Oh, hello.

235
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,782
Can I have
some wine, please?

236
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,618
The waiter
is busy, Sir,

237
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,912
but I will bring you
the carte des vins

238
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,788
when I have finished
attending to this Gentleman.

239
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,874
Oh, fine.
No hurry.

240
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,959
Oh, good, how nice,
how very thoughtful.

241
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,420
I trust the beer is to
your satisfaction, Sir?

242
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,173
Yes, fine.

243
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,675
Ah, good.
May I wish you bon apetit.

244
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,636
Thank you.

245
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,430
Manuel!

246
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,473
Senor.

247
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:40,557
Would you fetch
the wine list please?

248
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,393
Si, Senor.

249
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,479
- The wine list.
- Si?

250
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,065
- The wine... vino.
- Senor.

251
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,360
No, no. The list!

252
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,321
There, there, the list!

253
00:10:54,571 --> 00:11:00,035
The list, there!
The red... there!

254
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,830
There!

255
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,297
Have you got a half
bottle of the beaujolais?

256
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,632
Yes.

257
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,342
Oh, fine.

258
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,052
Right! Never mind!
Never mind!

259
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,054
Manuel, another grapefruit
for table 12.

260
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,180
Please... Manuel!

261
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,685
I do beg your pardon.
I'm so sorry.

262
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,527
- Throw it away.
- Que?

263
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:34,945
Throw... it... away!

264
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,196
Throw... it...
away?

265
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,949
Throw it away!

266
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,952
Now!

267
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,999
Sorry!

268
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,419
Sorry, sorry!
Sorry about that.

269
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,132
Sorry about that.

270
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,967
No, I like a bit
of cabaret.

271
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,845
You left
your sketch.

272
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,221
Oh! Sorry.

273
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,472
It's very good.
Do you sell any?

274
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,767
Enough to keep me
in waitressing.

275
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:10,189
One half bottle
of beaujolais.

276
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,273
Sybil!

277
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,568
Someone at
reception, dear.

278
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,781
Yes, yes,
well, yes?

279
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,075
Well, I was wondering if
you could offer me

280
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,285
accommodation for
a few nights?

281
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,328
Well, have
you booked?

282
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,412
- I'm sorry?
- Have you booked?

283
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,081
- No.
- Oh, dear!

284
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,166
Why, are you full?

285
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,002
Oh, we're not full,

286
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,506
we're not full.
Of course we're not full!

287
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,843
- I'd like, ah...
- One moment, please.

288
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,136
- Yes?
- A single room with a...

289
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,222
Could I have your name?

290
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,515
- Melbury.
- One second, please.

291
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,225
Hello?

292
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,310
Ah, yes, Mr. O'reilly,
well, it's perfectly simple.

293
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,562
When I asked you
to build me a wall,

294
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,649
I was hoping that instead of just dumping
the bricks in a pile,

295
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,276
you might have found time
to cement them together,

296
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:57,694
you know, one on top
of the other,

297
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,530
in the traditional fashion.

298
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,822
Could you fill it in, please?

299
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,825
Oh, splendid!

300
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:07,037
Ah, yes, but when,
Mr. O'reilly?

301
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,832
There, there!

302
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,292
Yes, yes, yes,
but when?

303
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:16,672
Yes, yes, ah,
the flu, yes.

304
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,257
Both names, please.

305
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,509
Yes, I should have
guessed, Mr. O'reilly,

306
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,219
that and the potato
famine I suppose.

307
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,846
I beg your pardon?

308
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,348
Would you put both
your names, please?

309
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,724
Well, will you
give me a date?

310
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:28,976
Yeah, I only use one.

311
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,686
You don't have
a first name?

312
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:35,190
No, I am Lord Melbury,
so I simply sign "Melbury".

313
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,403
Go away.

314
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,322
I'm so sorry to have kept
you waiting, your Lordship.

315
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,867
I do apologize,
please forgive me.

316
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:48,453
Is there something,
anything, I can do for you?

317
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:49,496
Anything at all?

318
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,039
Well, I have
filled this in...

319
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,082
Oh, please don't
bother with that.

320
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,043
- Now, a room?
- A special room, a single?

321
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:56,086
A double?
A suite?

322
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,171
Well, we don't
have any suites,

323
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,213
but we do have some
beautiful doubles...

324
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,423
No, no, just a single.

325
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,175
Just a single.
Absolutely!

326
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,051
How very wise if I may
say so, your honor.

327
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,219
With a bath?

328
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:09,808
Naturally, naturally!
Naturellement!

329
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,187
I shall be staying for
one or two nights...

330
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,648
Manuel!

331
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,112
It's rather grey
today, isn't it?

332
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,197
Oh, yes,
it is, rather.

333
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,990
Of course usually down here
it's quite beautiful,

334
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,828
but today is a real
old, uh, rotter.

335
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,915
Manuel!

336
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,374
Still, it's good
for the wheat.

337
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,709
Yes, I suppose so.

338
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,629
I hear it's coming along
wonderfully at the moment!

339
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,339
Thank God!
I love the wheat.

340
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,965
There's no sight like

341
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,551
a field of wheat waving
in the... waving

342
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,930
in... Manuel!

343
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,183
Well, how are you?

344
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,392
I mean if it's not
a personal question.

345
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:53,435
Well, it is
a personal...

346
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:54,811
Let me take your
cases for you.

347
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:55,938
Oh, thank you
very much.

348
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,147
- They're just outside.
- Splendid.

349
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,025
Thank you so much.
I won't be one moment.

350
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:10,577
Ah, Lord Melbury.
May I introduce my wife?

351
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,079
Yes, we have met.

352
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,622
My wife, may I
introduce his Lordship.

353
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,332
Thank you, Basil,
we've sorted it out.

354
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,417
Splendid, splendid.

355
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,045
I wonder, could I deposit this
case with you?

356
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,630
It's just a few valuables?

357
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,756
Valuables, of course.

358
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,216
Please let me take it now.

359
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,509
I'll put it in the safe
straightaway.

360
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,761
Sybil, would you put this
in the safe, please?

361
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,179
I'm just off to
the kitchen, Basil.

362
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,222
Yes, well, if
you're too busy...

363
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:31,682
Nice to have met you,
Lord Melbury.

364
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,475
- Hope you enjoy your stay.
- Thank you so much.

365
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,352
I'll do it then,
then I'll do the picture...

366
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,520
I'll put this away in
one moment, your Lord.

367
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,816
Manuel, will you take
these cases to room 21.

368
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,359
Que?

369
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,405
Take...
to room... 21.

370
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,031
No entender.

371
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:51,827
Prenda las casos en...
Oh, doesn't matter.

372
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,371
I'll do it.
Thank you manuel.

373
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,499
- I take them.
- No, no, go away!

374
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,126
Go and wait!

375
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,335
- Wait?
- Wait.

376
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,046
In there!
Go and wait In there!

377
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:06,341
Go and be a
waiter in there!

378
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,929
I do apologize,
your Lordship.

379
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,640
I'm afraid he's only
just joined us.

380
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:18,645
It'd be quicker to train
a monkey, ha ha ha!

381
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,364
Do please follow me...

382
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,867
I mean, if you're ready.
There's no hurry.

383
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:35,204
Oh, yes, yes, fine.

384
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,585
Excuse me, I'm sorry
to bother you.

385
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,128
Would you mind
moving to that table?

386
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,171
What?

387
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,089
Could I askyou please,
to move to that table over there?

388
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,132
But...

389
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,175
I'm so sorry
to trouble you.

390
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,927
- We're halfway through!
- Thank you so much.

391
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,386
This is Lord Melbury's
table, you see?

392
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:52,930
- What?
- Lord Melbury.

393
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,265
When he stays with us,
he always sits at this table.

394
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,308
Well, why did
they put us here?

395
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,185
Uh, an oversight
on my wife's part.

396
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,895
I'm so sorry.
He's only just arrived, you see.

397
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,146
Would you mind?
Polly!

398
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,940
Would you help these
people to that table?

399
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,900
Thank you,
thank you so much.

400
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,070
Come on!
Come on!

401
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,906
Thank you.

402
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,539
Ah, Lord Melbury!

403
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,457
Do please come this way,
your Lordship,

404
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,668
I have your table over
here by the window.

405
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:26,171
As usual...
just here.

406
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:30,509
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much.

407
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,012
Oh, my God!

408
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:35,180
I think he's
killed him!

409
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,768
Get on with your meals!
Thank you so much.

410
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,488
Lord Melbury, I really
must apologize again...

411
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,448
Please, please,
think nothing of it.

412
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,867
- But it was so...
- No, no, no.

413
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,451
It was the
smallest of accidents.

414
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:57,744
It could have
occurred anywhere.

415
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,830
- Yes, but...
- I've forgotten all about it.

416
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,666
That's most... You're really...
Ah, your Lordship,

417
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,544
would you allow me
to offer you

418
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,379
dinner here tonight,
as our guest?

419
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:08,964
That's extremely
kind of you.

420
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,841
Unfortunately, I have
an engagement tonight.

421
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,384
- Oh.
- Oh, actually...

422
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,553
- Yes?
- There is one thing.

423
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:15,721
Good! Good!

424
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:18,849
I was wondering...
can you cash me a small check?

425
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,143
I'm playing golf
this afternoon...

426
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:22,269
Oh, delighted!

427
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,812
And I'd rather not
go into the town.

428
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,148
Absolutely... I mean,
uh, how much?

429
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,274
Uh, if it's not
a rude question?

430
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:31,653
Could you manage
50... oh! 100?

431
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:37,159
A hundred?
Oh, absolutely.

432
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,870
Oh, yes, I mean,
will 100 be enough?

433
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,622
I mean 150,

434
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:42,873
two, 160?

435
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,293
Let's see, that's uh,
dinner tonight, few tips...

436
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,961
Oh, and it's the
weekend, isn't it?

437
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:51,006
Would 200
be all right?

438
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:55,344
Please! Yes! Oh, ha, ha!
Oh, tremendous!

439
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,846
Oh, I'm so happy!

440
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,806
I'll send someone to
the town straightaway

441
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,100
and have it for you here
when you get back.

442
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:03,519
Yes, well,
that would be splendid.

443
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:04,895
Thank you, thank you,
your Lordship.

444
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:05,938
Thank you so much.

445
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,774
Oh, not at all,
my privilege.

446
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:13,779
Breeding...
I mean... oh!

447
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,822
Hello, dear.

448
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,866
- What are you doing?
- I'm kissing you, dear.

449
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,368
Well, don't.

450
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:22,454
Just thought it might
be nice to...

451
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:23,789
I heard
about lunch.

452
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,333
What? Oh, that!
Think nothing of it.

453
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,417
What?

454
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,710
It was the smallest
of accidents.

455
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,337
- Could have happened anywhere.
- Anywhere?

456
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,464
First you move that nice family
in the middle of their meal,

457
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:36,009
and then you attack
Lord Melbury with a chair!

458
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,135
Look, Sybil,

459
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,054
I've had a word with
Lord Melbury about it.

460
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,430
He was quite
charming...

461
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,349
Oh, it's delightful to have
people like that staying here.

462
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,854
Sheer class, golf,
baths, engagements,

463
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:50,858
a couple of
hundr... h... h... horses.

464
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,651
Well, I've never seen
such tatty cases.

465
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:53,735
Of course
you haven't.

466
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,112
It's only the
true upper class

467
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,697
that would have
tat like that.

468
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:57,906
It's the whole point!

469
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,992
Oh, you don't know what
I'm talking about.

470
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:01,827
No, I don't.
But don't ever move guests

471
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:02,953
in the middle
of a meal again.

472
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,331
And get that
picture up.

473
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,418
Sour old rat.

474
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:11,753
Ah! Polly.

475
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,505
Would you do
me a favor?

476
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,924
When you're down in
the town this afternoon,

477
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,760
would you
just pop...

478
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:19,803
just between
ourselves,

479
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:20,846
don't mention this
to my wife,

480
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:24,516
pop into the bank
and just...

481
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,922
Could somebody
answer that, please?

482
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,926
Hello!

483
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,303
Is there nobody
who can answer that?

484
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:46,139
There must
be someone.

485
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,268
Not you.

486
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:50,769
I'll never get it up.

487
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,271
I'll cancel my holiday,
do it then.

488
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:56,358
Hello, Fawlty Towers?

489
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,651
Hello, Fawlty Towers.

490
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,444
Oh, hello, Brenda.

491
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,989
Basil, it's 6:00.

492
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,283
Ah, Polly...
did you cash it?

493
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,243
- Yes, Mr. Fawlty?
- Good, good.

494
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,452
- Could I have a word with you?
- What?

495
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:09,746
- Could I speak to you for just a minute?
- Not now, polly!

496
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,206
- It's very important.
- Later! Later!

497
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,624
- Basil!
- I'm just going, dear.

498
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,170
Thank you, thank you
so much, Polly.

499
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:22,384
Ah, good evening, Major.

500
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:23,427
Evening, Fawlty.

501
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,012
The usual?

502
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:29,016
Oh, why not?
Indeed, yes.

503
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,226
Why not?
I've just been watching

504
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,812
one of those nature
films on television.

505
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:34,855
Oh, yes?

506
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,857
Did you know
the female gibbon

507
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,318
gestates for
seven months?

508
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:40,944
Seven months?

509
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:43,238
Well I never...
Here you are, Major.

510
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,782
Seven... my word.

511
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,743
Ah, Good Evening,
Mr. Wareing.

512
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:51,246
A gin and orange, a lemon squash
and a scotch and water, please.

513
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:53,123
Certainly.

514
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,709
Is there any part
of the room

515
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,252
you'd like us to
keep away from?

516
00:22:57,503 --> 00:23:00,088
What?

517
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:02,925
We'll be over there, then.

518
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:04,801
Seven!
Well, well...

519
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:05,844
Evening, Fawlty.

520
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,262
Ah, Good Evening,
Lord Melbury.

521
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:09,515
- Anywhere?
- Yes, anywhere, anywhere.

522
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:13,310
Lord Melbury, may I offer you
a little apertif as our guest?

523
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,021
That's very kind of you.
Dry sherry, if you please.

524
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:19,358
What else?

525
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:22,110
Such...
Oh, I don't know what.

526
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,320
Je ne sais quoi?

527
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,822
Exactly! Exactly!

528
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,115
Ah, there you are, Sybil.

529
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:28,492
Good evening, Major.

530
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,577
Evening,
Mrs. Fawlty.

531
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:32,830
- There you are, your Lordship.
- Ah, thank you very much.

532
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,164
I see my little
collection of

533
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,666
coins tickles
your interest.

534
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,043
What?
Oh, yes, yes.

535
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,128
All British Empire
of course.

536
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:42,089
Used to be quite
a hobby of mine.

537
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,298
Little investment too.

538
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:45,175
Quite.
Talking about, um,

539
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:49,096
- Did you manage to...
- Oh yes.

540
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:53,141
- There you are, your Lordship.
- Oh, Thank you, yes.

541
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,943
Yes, you know,
these sorts of things,

542
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,196
their value's soared this
last couple of years.

543
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,281
Have they really?

544
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:08,448
Oh, yes.
You take my advice.

545
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:09,783
Get them revalued,

546
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,285
and insure them for
the full amount.

547
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,996
Yes, yes, I will.

548
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,123
You can't take any risks
nowadays, I'm afraid.

549
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,541
- No, no, quite.
- Well, I must be off.

550
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,959
Thank you very much,
your Lordship.

551
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,419
Basil!

552
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,045
Yes, yes, I was just talking
to Lord Melbury, dear.

553
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:25,883
A gin and orange, a lemon squash
and a scotch and water, please!

554
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,467
I do apologize, I was just
talking to Lord...

555
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:29,219
Fawlty!

556
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,221
I was thinking...

557
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:34,224
You see, I am having
dinner tonight

558
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,227
with the duke of Buckleigh,
do you know him?

559
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,438
Not personally, no.

560
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:42,024
He's a great expert,

561
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:43,233
you know, Sotheby's
and all that.

562
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,276
Is he?

563
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,737
Now if you like,
I could take them with me,

564
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:48,405
ask him to have
a quick look at them,

565
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,073
and find their
current value.

566
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:52,493
- Would you really?
- Yes, yes, certainly.

567
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,328
Well, I'll be off
in a few moments.

568
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:55,537
- Well, that's really so...
- Basil!

569
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,207
I'm talking to Lord Melbury!

570
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:02,878
A gin and orange, a lemon squash
and a scotch and water, please!

571
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:06,256
All right!
All right!

572
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,385
Oh, Mr. Fawlty...

573
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:11,637
Was that Lord Melbury?
Has he gone?

574
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,096
I rang, Mr. Fawlty,
I must speak with you.

575
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,933
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- It's very important.

576
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:16,975
- Can we talk in there?
- I can't.

577
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:18,810
- Basil!
- It's very important!

578
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:22,606
I'm dealing with something
important out here, Sybil.

579
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:27,152
Yes? Yes, right, well,
yes, yes, what is it?

580
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:28,195
- It's about Lord Melbury.
- Yes?

581
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:29,780
He's not
Lord Melbury,

582
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,406
he's a confidence
trickster.

583
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:32,950
I beg your pardon?

584
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,076
Mr. Brown told me.

585
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:35,327
Oh!

586
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:36,787
Mr. Brown's
from the C.I.D.

587
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,413
They've been
watching Melbury

588
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:40,249
because he's pulling some
big con trick in the town.

589
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:42,084
They're going to arrest
him when he leaves here,

590
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:43,544
so as not to cause
you embarrassment.

591
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:44,795
But he asked me
to tell you...

592
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,171
Oh, how nice of him!

593
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,422
Please, Mr. Fawlty...

594
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:48,799
Oh, I don't know
what other tales

595
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,759
Mr. Brown of M.I.5 has been
impressing you with.

596
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,970
- He's a con man!
- Oh, yes, of course,

597
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,012
it stands out
a mile, doesn't it?

598
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:55,556
He's so common.

599
00:25:55,806 --> 00:26:00,602
Unlike that cockney git
whose ulterior motive

600
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,772
poor, innocent,
misguided child that you are.

601
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:04,857
Basil, what's
going on?

602
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:06,358
Nothing, my dear,
nothing at all.

603
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,193
- Mrs. Fawlty...
- Yes, Polly?

604
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,153
- I don't know what she's...
- Basil!

605
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:11,947
Mr. Brown is
from the C.I.D.

606
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,199
He showed me
identification.

607
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,577
They're watching Melbury.
He's a confidence trickster.

608
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:17,911
I see.

609
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:19,538
What do you mean,
you see?

610
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:21,165
Let's have a look
at these valuables.

611
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,207
What are you
doing, Sybil?

612
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:23,542
Sybil, I forbid you
to open that safe!

613
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,919
Sybil, I forbid you
to take that case out!

614
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:30,299
Sybil, do not open
that case, I forbid it!

615
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:31,925
I never thought I would
live to see the day

616
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,720
when a peer
of the realm,

617
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,097
entrusts to us,
a case of valuables...

618
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:40,100
In trust...

619
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,459
I'll call the police.

620
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:09,213
They're already here,
Mr. Brown's outside.

621
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,841
Someone at
reception, Basil?

622
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:25,229
Ah! All right.

623
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:29,149
Ah... Good evening.

624
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,442
I believe you
were expecting us.

625
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:31,652
No, I was expecting
somebody else.

626
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,570
Sir Richard
and Lady Morris.

627
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,738
Yes, yes, them as well.

628
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:35,781
I'm sorry?

629
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,199
- How did you know?
- What?

630
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,909
Oh... You're Sir Richard
and Lady Morris,

631
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,244
I do beg
your pardon.

632
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:43,664
I was just think...

633
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,544
Would you mind filling
this out, please?

634
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:51,129
We've given you room...
aha!

635
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,339
Ah, Fawlty!

636
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,467
Mr. Fawlty to you,
Lord Melbury.

637
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:56,552
I beg your pardon?

638
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:58,428
Oh, nothing,
please forget all about it.

639
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,557
Here's the check
for £-200.

640
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:04,476
Ah, thank you
so much.

641
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:07,813
Now, about my priceless
collection of coins?

642
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:08,856
Oh, yes, ah,
do you still...

643
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:10,023
Do I still want
you to take them

644
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:11,817
to be valued by the Duke
of Buckleigh, my Lord?

645
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:12,860
- Ah, yes.
- No, I don't.

646
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,986
Because we've
just heard

647
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:15,946
that the duke
of Buckleigh is dead!

648
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,699
Yes, got his head knocked off
by a golf ball.

649
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,492
Tragic! Tragic!

650
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,744
Well, how are you,
Lord Melbury?

651
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:25,706
'ow are yer then?
All right, mate?

652
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:29,585
'ow's me
old mucker?

653
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,003
Any valuables to deposit,
Sir Richard?

654
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,839
Any bricks?

655
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:38,218
I do apologize...
You bastard!

656
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:39,761
We've given
you room 12

657
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:41,054
with the view
overlooking the park...

658
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:42,097
I'm sure you'll
like it...

659
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:43,182
We'll have your
bags brought up...

660
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:44,850
And may I
introduce your wife?

661
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,353
Hello, Lord Melbury!

662
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:52,107
- Bastard!
- Basil!

663
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:55,402
Please think
nothing of it.

664
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:03,911
Do please excuse me
one moment.

665
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,421
Basil, the morrises
are leaving.

666
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:22,179
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

667
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,472
We're leaving!

668
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:25,432
Oh, don't, please stay,
you'll like it here.

669
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:29,019
I've never been in such
a place in my life.

670
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,653
You snobs!

671
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:42,074
You stupid, stuck-up,
toffee-nosed, half-witted...

672
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:49,289
upper-class
piles of... pus!

673
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:59,091
- Sorry, Mr. Fawlty.
- Just one, please.

674
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:10,519
Sorry, Mr. Fawlty.

675
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:21,238
Well, I'd better put
the picture up.

676
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:26,201
Oh, thank You, Polly,
for the...

677
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,706
- Well done, Manuel.
- Que?

678
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:33,917
Oh... Ole.

679
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:35,002
Sorry about that,
Mr. Fawlty.

680
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:36,336
Can I buy you
a drink?

681
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,422
No, no, I'd better put
this up, I suppose.

682
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:41,258
Basil!

683
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,303
A gin and orange,

684
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:48,640
a lemon squash and a
scotch and water, please!

685
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,976
Right!

686
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:54,271
Come on.
