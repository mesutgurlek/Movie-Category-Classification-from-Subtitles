1
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:47,984
- 950 grams. Nice and juicy.
- That's a shoulder piece, isn't it?

2
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:52,542
The Kube brothers get what they
always get. Tell me about it!

3
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:56,021
- How much do we owe you?
- Two sacks.

4
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:09,179
Oh, it's Mr Interligator.
How's the wife?

5
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:11,376
She's doing poorly.

6
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:15,895
- Roger, your shawl.
- But I've got my shawl.

7
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:18,983
So she tried to commit suicide again?

8
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:26,783
By some miracle, she's alive.

9
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:30,534
Butcher, I think...

10
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:33,543
- you're getting a customer.
- Who's next?

11
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:35,224
I am.

12
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:45,061
- That for me?
- At your service.

13
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:47,301
Put it on my bill.

14
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:50,224
We all know where she keeps her bill.

15
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:53,374
OK, you're next.

16
00:05:57,545 --> 00:06:01,220
That damn carburettor.
This has happened before.

17
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:13,540
That'll cost you... Iet's see...
the ride plus the luggage...

18
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:15,622
How are you paying?

19
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,815
- In lentils?
- That's all I have left.

20
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:29,222
Listen, I'd settle for those shoes.

21
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:38,821
- We're closed for the day.
- I didn't come about that.

22
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,539
I don't eat meat anyway.

23
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,975
- I came about the ad.
- What ad?

24
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:46,699
- The ad in the paper.
- What paper?

25
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:48,623
Hard Times.

26
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:51,504
Hold on...

27
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:58,781
"Light maintenance jobs.
Odd jobs. Room and board."

28
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:01,220
"Room facing south."

29
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:04,781
I do have the right address, don't I?
Number 129a?

30
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:07,579
Whether here or there,
this is nowhere.

31
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:10,936
That way we don't get
hassled by the neighbours.

32
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:15,222
Nor by any visitors.

33
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:18,576
Well...

34
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:20,935
I must have made a mistake.

35
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:43,617
Not so fast.
You're looking for a job, right?

36
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:45,304
Come over here.

37
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:48,417
- Turn around.
- Pardon me?

38
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,820
Turn around.

39
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:52,981
How much do you weigh?

40
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:56,097
63 or 64 kilos. Why?

41
00:07:56,305 --> 00:08:00,184
You're not exactly hefty.
The job I've got takes muscle.

42
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:03,183
- Don't worry about that.
- I'm a butcher.

43
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:08,982
I'm straight with people. So I'd
say you haven't got what it takes.

44
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:13,542
You don't have the body structure,
the right breadth.

45
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:16,100
Nonetheless I'll give you a try.

46
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:19,502
But you'll have to bust your ass.

47
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:21,980
I'd call that a stroke of luck.

48
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:25,095
- Thanks.
- Come on, let's go.

49
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,944
So what exactly does the job entail?

50
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:34,539
Light maintenance jobs. Odd jobs.
Room and board. Room facing south.

51
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:38,704
- Just like in the ad?
- What do you know? Like in the ad.

52
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:46,421
Hey, watch it. One of the steps
is loose. You'll have to fix that.

53
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:52,734
And do all the painting, cleaning,
the electricity. The whole shebang.

54
00:08:57,265 --> 00:09:00,701
You'll like it here, you'll see.

55
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:06,457
And there aren't any neighbours
opposite. The key is on this nail.

56
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:09,225
Well, I'll let you get settled in.

57
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:14,584
Thanks.

58
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:42,179
- How are things in town?
- Terrible. Really terrible.

59
00:09:42,385 --> 00:09:46,583
It's the rationing. They'd eat
their shoes. Kind of touch and go.

60
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:51,620
- They haven't got any street smarts.
- It's a mess. Till things grow back.

61
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,385
Nothing will ever grow back. Ever.

62
00:09:54,585 --> 00:10:00,455
- You're quite the optimist.
- Get that through your thick skull.

63
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:03,463
- Well, is your hair growing back?
- No.

64
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:05,895
You see? It's the same thing.

65
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:18,023
Couldn't we open
that window for five minutes?

66
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:26,617
I like the smell of glue. It smells
like fish. It brings back memories.

67
00:11:34,585 --> 00:11:37,338
What do you think of the new guy?

68
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:40,819
Are you deaf or something?

69
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:44,784
He's skinny.

70
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:52,020
Still thinking of her, huh?

71
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:56,822
Apparently she's hearing voices now.

72
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:23,820
Would it be too much of an effort
to put that a bit closer?

73
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,944
Hello.

74
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:46,301
Ma'am...

75
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:51,497
She's deaf as a post. This way
we always know where she is.

76
00:16:51,705 --> 00:16:57,223
Granny, go back upstairs to your
room. There's nothing left. Now go.

77
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:06,220
You finished? Then don't hang around.
Fix the bulb on the 2nd floor.

78
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:15,375
- Hi, butcher.
- Hi, postman.

79
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,338
- Got a parcel for your daughter.
- Upstairs.

80
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:31,853
- Watch the step.
- Mind your business.

81
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,980
Grab it, Marcel.

82
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:45,815
- I've got it.
- Throw it over here. Throw it.

83
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:50,096
You shit.

84
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:03,336
Postal Administration. Article 12.

85
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:07,743
You've got exactly 20 seconds
to get back to your flats.

86
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:11,415
- Move.
- You don't have kids to feed.

87
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,975
That applies to kids as well.

88
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:32,576
Can't you read, moron?

89
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:35,458
- "Julie Clapet."
- He's a friend.

90
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:38,384
A friend?

91
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:42,417
Here, Julie.

92
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,663
Sign here, Julie.

93
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:51,143
I call you Julie because I like you.
But I don't want to rush you.

94
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:57,021
See you, Julie.

95
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:09,017
- Here. For the ad.
- Always at your service.

96
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:13,423
- That new guy is kind of weird.
- He used to be a circus man.

97
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:23,621
I'm sure this contains some tidbits
to eat. That's why they're...

98
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:31,895
- Would you like to taste them?
- Yes. I'd love to.

99
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:36,098
Shall we say at 7? That'll
give me time to get things ready.

100
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:45,896
- Is he after her?
- After who?

101
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:50,303
Your daughter. She's a cute slip
of a thing. She needs someone.

102
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:54,384
- That someone is me. Is that clear?
- Hey, I've got news.

103
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:58,373
They shot one down two days ago.
A superb 30-metre target.

104
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:00,974
- No bodies?
- They cart them away.

105
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:04,655
Bloody vermin.
They even say they eat money.

106
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:10,144
We've got to get rid of them for
good, those vegetable-eating queers.

107
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:13,018
They'll get what's coming to them.

108
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:15,822
THE ENEMY PLOTS AGAINST US

109
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:18,540
- Bye, butcher.
- Bye, postman.

110
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:29,979
- Do you think that's it for tonight?
- I hope so.

111
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:34,938
That goddamn butcher,
I'm sure he won't do it tonight.

112
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,943
He's taking his time
just to make me mad.

113
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:43,218
- He's obviously succeeded.
- What's he waiting for anyway?

114
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:46,974
Till the new guy tries to escape
in a garbage can, too?

115
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:53,021
- How long did the other guy last us?
- A week.

116
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,814
Not counting the broth, that is.

117
00:21:11,785 --> 00:21:15,937
One week. We polished off
the last chunk two days ago.

118
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:23,181
I'm hungry. I'm bloody starving.

119
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:25,421
I'm fucking starving.

120
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:31,418
My little Hercule... Every man
for himself, and God for all.

121
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:15,018
- Hi there. It's me.
- Hello.

122
00:24:16,985 --> 00:24:18,464
Come in.

123
00:24:19,665 --> 00:24:22,225
Please, do come in.

124
00:24:24,225 --> 00:24:26,864
- For you.
- Thank you.

125
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,623
Sit down.

126
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:38,616
- Did you paint that?
- Yes, it's nothing much.

127
00:24:40,265 --> 00:24:43,814
- No, no...
- No problem.

128
00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:55,663
I've made a pot of tea.

129
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:59,221
- Shall I pour you a cup?
- Yes, please.

130
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:08,415
- I hope you don't find me too bold.
- Oh, no. Not at all.

131
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:11,742
- Why should I?
- A girl invites you to her flat.

132
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:15,381
Some would consider that
a bit brazen.

133
00:25:15,585 --> 00:25:19,624
- Well, actually...
- And thank you for this morning.

134
00:25:19,825 --> 00:25:25,422
- Why thank you?
- You rescued my parcel on the steps.

135
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,822
I was very moved by your concern.

136
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:32,415
That goes without saying.

137
00:25:34,345 --> 00:25:40,295
No, on the contrary. People usually
only think of themselves nowadays.

138
00:25:52,265 --> 00:25:57,419
Only because they have nothing.
Deep down, they're still good people.

139
00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:02,096
I'm glad to hear they like me.
They're very kind.

140
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:09,335
I'm getting along with your father,
too. He thinks I'm a nice guy, right?

141
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:13,702
- Why not try Kraft cheese spread?
- That's new.

142
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,102
- And handy.
- They talk to me about you.

143
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:20,943
- Who?
- The voices in my head.

144
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:26,014
Oh, right. The voices.
And what do they say?

145
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:32,259
Hold on, let me try to remember...

146
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:38,574
- It's more the language they use.
- Do they talk about love?

147
00:26:38,785 --> 00:26:40,264
Oh, no.

148
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:45,977
"Robert's a pervert, an arse wipe,
a panty eater." You see?

149
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:47,777
But that's not true.

150
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:53,495
Aurore, you're missing
something really funny.

151
00:26:53,705 --> 00:26:57,380
At any rate, I have no choice.
Here. Tomorrow at 11 sharp.

152
00:26:57,585 --> 00:27:01,294
- Ring me. I'm counting on you.
- But...

153
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:04,937
"Arse wipe"?

154
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:09,616
Move out? What for?
I've just moved in.

155
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:13,943
Because it's pretty awful here.
The building is unsanitary.

156
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:16,659
The walls are falling apart,
and it leaks.

157
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:20,378
- Perhaps you don't like me?
- Me?

158
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:25,420
- You act as if you want me to leave.
- No, on the contrary. Not at all...

159
00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:31,540
It does that once in a while.

160
00:27:42,705 --> 00:27:44,138
Did I hurt you?

161
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:48,814
- I'll be all right.
- Then it must be the shock.

162
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:51,858
I'm such a klutz.

163
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:53,544
Don't move.

164
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:13,816
I'm blind as a bat.
Everything's all foggy.

165
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:17,813
I could get lost in that fog.

166
00:28:28,025 --> 00:28:31,700
Leave it. I buy two of everything
because I break things.

167
00:28:40,305 --> 00:28:42,865
- So you play the cello?
- Yes.

168
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:45,625
I play an instrument as well.

169
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:48,743
Will you wait for me?

170
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:56,175
- Oh, shit. Not again.
- What are you doing?

171
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:58,694
- I wanted to draw a bath.
- Again?

172
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:02,420
Well, you sharpen your knives
often enough, too.

173
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:10,700
A musical saw...

174
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:14,022
- It has a nice sound.
- Sit down.

175
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:19,456
- The doctor and I had an act once.
- Doctor?

176
00:29:19,665 --> 00:29:23,419
Livingstone. "Dr Livingstone".

177
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,377
He was my partner.

178
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:29,622
- But now he's gone.
- Where did he go?

179
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:35,017
He disappeared after a show.
We only found his remains.

180
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:38,295
They'd eaten him.

181
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:42,020
Can you imagine that? They ate him.

182
00:29:43,785 --> 00:29:48,575
I lost everything that night.
So, the first ad I ran across...

183
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:53,142
- And here I am.
- I need to tell you something.

184
00:29:54,345 --> 00:29:56,017
Listen.

185
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:11,019
Do you know that tune?

186
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:13,181
It was his favourite.

187
00:31:01,345 --> 00:31:05,179
Have you noticed
how clear the nights have been?

188
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:09,424
That's normal. We're entering
the Virgo age. That's my sign.

189
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:14,014
- No kidding?
- I swear it. My ascendant is Leo.

190
00:31:16,225 --> 00:31:20,423
Cut it out. Not everyone's Gorilla,
ascendant Bulldozer.

191
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:25,904
I'm in luck, there's more in store.
"Get ready, the wind's shifting."

192
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:28,778
You'd like to pack up
and leave, right?

193
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:33,342
You wouldn't get far. It's worse
out there, they draw straws.

194
00:31:33,545 --> 00:31:38,824
And it'd be a shame to lose these
juicy hams. These little sucklings...

195
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:42,425
Stop joking around. I don't like it.

196
00:31:45,985 --> 00:31:48,977
You're better off here.
At least we have a system.

197
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:53,224
My ass! Your helpers are drawing
straws, too. What about that ad?

198
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:54,904
That's fate.

199
00:31:56,825 --> 00:31:59,419
You can't change fate.

200
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:11,016
It's like you said:
the wind is shifting.

201
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:13,976
Everyone's going to get it.

202
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:44,456
Mr Louison,
I shouldn't tell you this, but ..

203
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:50,138
What happened to your friend...
the same thing goes on here.

204
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:53,735
It takes place at night
in the stairwell.

205
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:56,413
That's why no one ever goes out.

206
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:00,821
And my father...

207
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,456
SOPORIFIC HERBAL TEA

208
00:36:06,585 --> 00:36:08,974
Hi. I'm here to fix
the box springs.

209
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:11,016
Come in.

210
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:21,903
This is an antique.
It's seen a lot of use.

211
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:24,380
- Yes.
- What seems to be the problem?

212
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:26,974
It squeaks. I find it bothersome.

213
00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:33,420
Could you bounce around on it a bit?
Just so I can hear?

214
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:44,302
- I can't see what's wrong.
- It squeaks most when there are two.

215
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:49,017
Let's give it a try.

216
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:57,014
Just as I thought,
it's the 2nd spring to the right.

217
00:37:58,065 --> 00:38:02,343
Come, Aurore...

218
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:11,015
We are here, Aurore...

219
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:15,582
to help you.

220
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:21,462
Come...

221
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:24,816
Freed from life...

222
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:29,974
come with us, Aurore.

223
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:33,416
Tranquil and at peace...

224
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:39,621
Aurore, come...

225
00:38:40,345 --> 00:38:42,813
COME AT 11 SHARP.
RING HARD.

226
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:56,464
Rotten world ...

227
00:39:48,665 --> 00:39:50,417
That should do it.

228
00:39:52,385 --> 00:39:54,455
- Here.
- Thanks.

229
00:39:56,345 --> 00:39:58,984
- What are "Troglodists"?
- Outlaws.

230
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:03,781
- But no one ever sees them.
- Just tales to distract the people.

231
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,660
- A typical Capricorn attitude.
- Wrong. I'm Aquarius.

232
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,662
- Oh?
- A sign of the future.

233
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,333
Oh, the future...

234
00:40:12,545 --> 00:40:15,343
It soon becomes history around here.

235
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:19,094
- It's very easy to miss a step.
- Don't worry about me.

236
00:40:19,305 --> 00:40:22,138
You brats, give that
back this instant.

237
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:25,735
Rémi, stop sniggering
or I'll give you a whacking.

238
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:30,700
I'll beat the one with the other,
do you hear? Give that back.

239
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:36,137
Oh, great! How will we get
that back now, you guttersnipes?

240
00:40:36,345 --> 00:40:39,337
This is a job for the Australian.

241
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:41,024
The Australian?

242
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:45,064
The Australian.

243
00:40:48,225 --> 00:40:50,181
Stand back.

244
00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:02,223
That's quite a tool.

245
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:06,420
The Australian is nothing
without its master.

246
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:07,978
Wow, did you see that?

247
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:13,456
- Tapioca, did you find a job yet?
- No. Nothing yet.

248
00:41:13,665 --> 00:41:18,216
Bad news. You're running up quite
a bill. Not to mention the rent.

249
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:23,135
I'm in a fix at the moment. But I've
got something here. Want a look?

250
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:26,542
Black market? In these times?
You make me sick.

251
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,815
Just take a look.

252
00:41:30,985 --> 00:41:34,136
A rat-call. The female cry.
It attract males.

253
00:41:34,345 --> 00:41:37,303
So? There aren't any rats left.
What's that?

254
00:41:37,505 --> 00:41:41,896
- This? A bullshit detector.
- Oh, yeah?

255
00:41:42,105 --> 00:41:45,256
- Come on, give it a try.
- Give what a try?

256
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:48,662
Start bullshitting. Come on.

257
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:51,504
- Come on...
- I can't do it on command.

258
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:54,542
Life is wonderful.

259
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:59,136
Your bullshit detector is shit.
Turn that thing off. It's too loud.

260
00:41:59,345 --> 00:42:05,580
If you don't settle your bill soon,
you'll find yourself on my hook.

261
00:42:05,785 --> 00:42:10,176
Very funny. What about that clown?
Isn't that taking a tad too long?

262
00:42:10,385 --> 00:42:15,061
- Everyone in the building is edgy.
- Not before he's redone the ceiling.

263
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:20,942
And in the meantime, to hell with us,
right? I've got mouths to feed.

264
00:42:21,145 --> 00:42:26,299
- Yeah, the granny's, for instance.
- For instance... Why bring her up?

265
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:30,180
- I've got my reasons.
- What do you mean by that?

266
00:42:30,385 --> 00:42:33,457
Want to pay up?
Give me the granny tonight.

267
00:42:33,665 --> 00:42:36,304
She's one of us.
It's against the rules.

268
00:42:36,505 --> 00:42:40,214
The rules, the rules...
The age limit is a rule, too.

269
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:44,020
- She's only good for pâté.
- She's my mother-in-law.

270
00:42:44,225 --> 00:42:48,662
- Why not take Mrs Interligator?
- Stop yelling.

271
00:42:48,865 --> 00:42:51,220
- It'd be an act of charity.
- Please.

272
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:57,017
Interligator is fond of his wife.
He's a good tenant. He pays.

273
00:42:57,225 --> 00:42:59,864
The bloody rich.
They always manage.

274
00:43:00,065 --> 00:43:03,774
You haven't got much choice
in view of your debts.

275
00:43:26,865 --> 00:43:29,982
Oh, it's you, Julie.

276
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:33,575
- You gave me a fright.
- Counting your money again?

277
00:43:33,785 --> 00:43:36,902
Well, yes. Tell me...

278
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:41,735
You don't come to see me very often.
It's nice of you to come.

279
00:43:41,945 --> 00:43:47,338
- Well, did you like your gift?
- It must have cost you a bundle.

280
00:43:47,545 --> 00:43:51,220
Well, yes.
Anything to make you happy.

281
00:43:51,425 --> 00:43:55,816
- You've loved sweets since you...
- But I don't any more.

282
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:09,184
- Let him go.
- You always ask the same thing.

283
00:44:09,385 --> 00:44:13,139
- It's the same old story every time.
- No, this time...

284
00:44:13,345 --> 00:44:17,816
This time it's different? True. Just
look at you. I know what he's up to.

285
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:22,098
With his puppy eyes. Making
your head spin with his dreams...

286
00:44:22,305 --> 00:44:24,819
- There's no room for dreams.
- Stop that.

287
00:44:25,025 --> 00:44:29,018
It's a tough world out there.
I didn't make the world.

288
00:44:30,465 --> 00:44:34,344
I know you hate my trade,
but it's an art like any other.

289
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:39,494
- Let him leave this place.
- With you? You won't last two weeks.

290
00:44:39,705 --> 00:44:43,778
- I don't want to lose you.
- You lost me long ago.

291
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:45,464
Julie...

292
00:45:19,025 --> 00:45:22,734
TROGLODISM: AN UNDERGROUND
ORGANISATION?

293
00:48:26,185 --> 00:48:32,420
Good evening, old girl. Guess what?
Let's play a little game, OK?

294
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:35,503
I'll scare you, and you'll scream.

295
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:39,254
That little clown upstairs
will rush to your rescue.

296
00:48:39,465 --> 00:48:41,103
Let's begin, OK?

297
00:48:52,385 --> 00:48:56,060
Go for it!
Planning to take my picture or what?

298
00:48:56,265 --> 00:48:58,825
Scream, goddamn it.

299
00:50:19,865 --> 00:50:24,381
You came from the N.E. sector to
annoy us with your beau's troubles?

300
00:50:24,585 --> 00:50:28,863
- Mr Louison.
- I don't know him. No names. No I.D.

301
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:32,421
- We're at war, girlie.
- We're outlaws. He's Rolls.

302
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,775
- Voltange.
- Rolan. Tourneur. Milan.

303
00:50:34,985 --> 00:50:38,022
- Trap.
- Pank. Fox. Paumeau.

304
00:50:38,225 --> 00:50:42,104
- We watch out for moles.
- You could be one.

305
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:46,617
- I'm not a liar. It's the truth.
- You, a surfacer? Talk about truth?

306
00:50:46,825 --> 00:50:49,862
Do you know what this is?
Take a close look.

307
00:50:50,065 --> 00:50:54,775
- Your brother Matt's shirt.
- Shot down like a rabbit.

308
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:59,103
- Now that's the truth.
- Common game. That's all we are.

309
00:50:59,305 --> 00:51:02,058
- And you're predators.
- Not me. I swear.

310
00:51:02,265 --> 00:51:05,462
- You're one of them. A carnivore.
- What?

311
00:51:05,665 --> 00:51:08,463
Is that the way
you rats treat ladies?

312
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:18,455
- Hey, watch it!
- For God's sake!

313
00:51:20,145 --> 00:51:22,215
Oh, my God.

314
00:51:23,745 --> 00:51:28,023
Tell Calamity Jane to smarten up,
or all hell will break loose.

315
00:51:28,225 --> 00:51:31,979
- Got it.
- A month's harvest is on the floor.

316
00:51:32,185 --> 00:51:34,301
- Plus the risks.
- Matt died for that.

317
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:36,973
Right. Tell her.

318
00:51:37,185 --> 00:51:40,063
Corn...

319
00:51:41,905 --> 00:51:47,423
There's plenty more in my building.
30 large bags in my dad's cellar.

320
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:52,334
- What's this guy of yours look like?
- Louison, Rolls...

321
00:51:52,545 --> 00:51:56,299
Yeah, the guy you want us to pick up.

322
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:07,454
- Can I help you, miss?
- No, just an old coffee grinder.

323
00:52:07,665 --> 00:52:10,384
Coffee? Some people have it made.

324
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:13,975
So you went for a walk last night?
A long one at that.

325
00:52:14,185 --> 00:52:18,736
First ruckus, then screams.
This building is a madhouse.

326
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:22,620
Your father may work at night,
but this is going too far.

327
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:33,820
There you are, Julie.

328
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,104
You OK?

329
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:47,460
Sorry, I was just
rehearsing a new number.

330
00:52:48,825 --> 00:52:50,304
Hold on...

331
00:52:56,585 --> 00:52:58,064
Here.

332
00:53:03,705 --> 00:53:06,219
Didn't you hear anything last night?

333
00:53:06,425 --> 00:53:09,064
No, your tea made sure ofthat.

334
00:53:09,265 --> 00:53:12,018
A pot of tea a night,
just as you prescribed.

335
00:53:12,225 --> 00:53:15,217
I'll get you some more,
you're almost all out.

336
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:19,020
You should drink some, too.
You look exhausted.

337
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:30,158
- Cheer up, she died a natural death.
- Come on, let's go.

338
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:34,318
But still, I'd have
liked to say goodbye.

339
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:37,079
Why don't we do that right now?

340
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:50,276
Poor Robert.

341
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:55,955
What made you rush out
into the stairwell at night anyway?

342
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:01,109
I did it for Aurore.
I wanted to save her.

343
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:04,709
I'm telling you, she wasn't
the one who screamed.

344
00:54:04,919 --> 00:54:07,797
Anyway, here you go.

345
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:09,796
Still, I did it for her.

346
00:54:09,999 --> 00:54:13,389
The butcher was very decent.
He apologised.

347
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,909
Invite you to dinner?
I haven't got much.

348
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,555
That's fine. That way
we won't feel weighed down.

349
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:23,637
- At 9 p.m.?
- Sharp. I'm always on time.

350
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:29,197
- Rather unusual for a girl, right?
- For a girl, you're rather unusual.

351
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,435
I owe you a lot, you know?

352
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:35,516
- Did you forgive them...
- For Livingstone?

353
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:41,715
- One must always forgive.
- Depends. It's not always possible.

354
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:45,036
Don't say that.
No one is completely evil.

355
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:50,677
It depends on circumstance. Or they
don't realise they've done wrong.

356
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:21,870
36th sector, 5th division.
Squirmer's Avenue.

357
00:55:23,479 --> 00:55:26,471
What did that girl say? The girl!

358
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,078
Sector 3/4, 69° north-east.

359
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:38,548
Albumin Square. Here.
All right, let's go.

360
00:55:39,479 --> 00:55:45,315
Scout to Sauce Master. Heading
towards target, 69° north-east.

361
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:51,071
Sauce Master to Scout.
Read you, over and out.

362
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:55,668
Watch your backsides, guys!

363
00:56:14,999 --> 00:56:19,356
Come, Aurore...

364
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:22,710
They are the worm...

365
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:27,470
you are the fruit.

366
00:56:39,759 --> 00:56:41,556
Not again! Darn it!

367
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:02,596
It seems rather quiet.

368
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:16,514
Not Father's golf clubs.

369
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:20,997
Yes, Father's clubs...

370
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,875
- Know who's on TV tonight?
- I don't have a TV.

371
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:36,469
Look, isn't that your customer?

372
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:46,039
- Shit.
- I'm a bit pressed for time.

373
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:51,154
No offence, but would you permit me
to come back later tonight...

374
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,271
to pay my respects to your daughter?

375
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:28,597
- Danger, we know not.
- Audacious, that's us.

376
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,915
Courageous, give me three.

377
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,872
Generous, you, you, you and me.

378
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:47,435
Scout to Sauce Master.
Corn located at site.

379
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:50,551
I repeat: corn located at site.

380
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:54,274
Proceeding with reconnaissance
mission. Target: Louison.

381
00:58:54,479 --> 00:58:57,277
I repeat: target, Louison.

382
00:59:34,999 --> 00:59:37,149
An ambush.

383
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,274
- Aurore, what's the matter now?
- Georges...

384
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:08,915
Throw in your apron?
Now I've heard it all.

385
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,351
I've been thinking about it
for a while now. I'm getting older.

386
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:17,108
I'm losing my touch.
And so many victims...

387
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:21,107
- I feel sorry for them.
- Sorry? That's not like you.

388
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:24,277
No one's entirely evil.
It's circumstance.

389
01:00:24,479 --> 01:00:27,073
Or they don't realise
they've done wrong.

390
01:00:27,279 --> 01:00:31,511
Some say you have to be able
to forgive. Do you forgive me?

391
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:34,358
An old bastard like you?

392
01:00:35,479 --> 01:00:37,709
- Maybe I could.
- You're sweet.

393
01:00:37,919 --> 01:00:41,753
The guys you finished off
wouldn't forgive you, though.

394
01:00:41,959 --> 01:00:46,475
- You'd really have to insist on it.
- If only Julie could forgive me.

395
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:50,274
- Have you asked her?
- She wouldn't ever.

396
01:00:50,479 --> 01:00:54,154
- But you're her father.
- She won't even speak to me.

397
01:00:56,679 --> 01:01:00,433
Want me to go see her?
I could explain it all to her.

398
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:06,475
All she cares about is that Louison.
But then, he's not such a bad guy.

399
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:12,356
By the way, he's on TV tonight.
Why don't you go tell him?

400
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,029
I bet he doesn't know.
He has his head in the clouds.

401
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:29,275
- You should really eat something.
- Not hungry.

402
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:31,798
Not hungry.

403
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,598
Fox...

404
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:49,035
You've been hiding things.
You're on TV tonight.

405
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:52,754
What do you know about that!
Livingstone.

406
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,075
The Criekville Casino.

407
01:01:56,119 --> 01:01:59,031
Our Tica Tica Walk
was a big hit back then.

408
01:01:59,239 --> 01:02:00,877
Tica Tica what?

409
01:02:38,399 --> 01:02:39,878
Oh, shit.

410
01:02:41,319 --> 01:02:45,517
- So that's your new number?
- I can explain, Julie.

411
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:48,677
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.

412
01:02:54,439 --> 01:02:56,475
I messed things up again.

413
01:03:04,439 --> 01:03:07,988
- He's got clown shoes.
- Mission accomplished.

414
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:10,474
We'll wait for the others.

415
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,152
Julie?

416
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:11,035
Recipe 8: Cordon Bleu to Sniper.
Artichoke Heart Soufflé.

417
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:13,992
- Quiet down.
- Artichoke Heart Soufflé.

418
01:04:14,199 --> 01:04:19,876
Preparation: H minus 35 minutes.
Then the onions. Simmer the snipers.

419
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,914
Cover them for about 15 minutes.
I repeat: for about 15 minutes.

420
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:30,876
H minus 20 minutes: stir the sauce.
I repeat: H minus 20 minutes.

421
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:43,629
THE STARS OF THE CIRCUS

422
01:04:49,279 --> 01:04:52,316
Julie, I didn't think you'd come.

423
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:57,274
- Good evening...
- I'll have a cup of tea.

424
01:04:57,479 --> 01:05:00,516
- Pardon?
- I'll have a cup of tea.

425
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:02,277
A cup of tea?

426
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,232
You have...

427
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:10,518
I'll have one as well.

428
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:13,279
Yes, a nice cup of tea.

429
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:21,275
Aurore, come and watch.
It's spellbinding.

430
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,872
Come, Aurore...

431
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,197
Come...

432
01:05:57,319 --> 01:06:00,675
- You're wearing...
- I found some contact lenses.

433
01:06:00,879 --> 01:06:04,872
...they'll titillate us.
Here's Stan and Livingstone.

434
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:19,557
- You never told me about this.
- Julie...

435
01:06:19,759 --> 01:06:23,274
that's Livingstone.
Livingstone, Julie.

436
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:57,308
- I don't believe this.
- It's the antenna, Dad.

437
01:06:57,519 --> 01:06:59,987
- What a drag.
- It's the antenna.

438
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:04,192
- Go and fix the wire.
- In this storm? No way.

439
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:12,272
That bastard.

440
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:17,157
It's the antenna.
Because of the wind.

441
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:29,038
Louison.

442
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:39,748
Aurore...

443
01:07:39,959 --> 01:07:42,314
come...

444
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:49,271
It's so much better here, near us...

445
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:09,757
Come...

446
01:08:23,919 --> 01:08:27,229
Louison...

447
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,509
- What?
- Come back.

448
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:31,277
I can't hear you.

449
01:08:33,599 --> 01:08:35,317
Come back.

450
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:38,270
Go back inside, Julie.

451
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:42,077
Watch out.

452
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:00,872
Mr Louison?

453
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,318
No...

454
01:09:49,879 --> 01:09:52,268
To the right.

455
01:09:53,799 --> 01:09:55,198
A bit more.

456
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:06,516
Yes. OK. Perfect. Perfect!

457
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,028
Leave it the way is. Perfect.

458
01:10:12,879 --> 01:10:15,234
Georges...

459
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:19,238
Aurore?

460
01:10:45,799 --> 01:10:48,916
- No more Robert...
- I fell.

461
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:55,831
That pervert who just wants
to drag you down into the mire...

462
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:00,157
down into the sewer, into the sew...

463
01:11:02,559 --> 01:11:05,710
- So it was you all along.
- No.

464
01:11:05,919 --> 01:11:08,479
Since when have you been doing this?

465
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:11,751
- No, I can explain.
- You bastard.

466
01:11:11,959 --> 01:11:16,350
It comes from downstairs.
You'll hurt your leg, Robert.

467
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:20,037
Stop.

468
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:34,078
Help, help!

469
01:11:39,839 --> 01:11:42,478
You shit. Son of a bitch.

470
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:45,068
- I fell.
- Yes, Aurore.

471
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:48,237
I wanted to get up on the chair.
I fell.

472
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:49,918
Yes, Aurore.

473
01:12:03,879 --> 01:12:07,633
The Troglos. The Troglos
are kidnapping someone.

474
01:12:07,839 --> 01:12:09,875
Les Troglos...

475
01:12:24,839 --> 01:12:29,549
How nice of you to make coffee,
Julie. Expecting company?

476
01:12:34,839 --> 01:12:36,795
Take your clothes off.

477
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:57,952
- Julie, hurry.
- That Interligator woman...

478
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:01,754
blew herself up sky high.
Took her husband with her.

479
01:13:01,959 --> 01:13:06,510
Where are you going?
Stop them, Robert.

480
01:13:10,959 --> 01:13:15,669
Julie, what are you doing here?
Wipe that muck off your face.

481
01:13:15,879 --> 01:13:20,191
Do you hear me? Go home this instant.
And wipe off that lipstick.

482
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:25,519
And you, I'll skin you alive.
Just you wait. I'll get you yet.

483
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:27,516
I'll get you.

484
01:13:28,999 --> 01:13:31,467
Just you wait.

485
01:13:36,519 --> 01:13:39,875
- Who goes there?
- Snipers.

486
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:47,314
How did it go? Everything all right?
Everybody OK?

487
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:50,477
Hey, Tourneur, look what I found.

488
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:56,674
- Yes, but how about the others?
- Here they are.

489
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:06,876
- How did it go?
- Easy. Virtually fell into our arms.

490
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:10,469
And we're all here.

491
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:12,715
Shit.

492
01:14:13,919 --> 01:14:16,752
- Where did she come from?
- What the hell...

493
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:20,235
- Shit.
- Pank...

494
01:14:20,439 --> 01:14:25,718
Is that the guy we were supposed
to grab? The target you located?

495
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:30,549
- Pank, can you explain this to us?
- Wasn't that the plan?

496
01:14:30,759 --> 01:14:34,798
"Albumin Square. Name: Louison."
That's what it says.

497
01:14:34,999 --> 01:14:39,675
But it also says: "Sex: male.
Shoes: that of a clown's."

498
01:14:39,879 --> 01:14:45,636
- Then we'd better check it out.
- Sex: male. Male!

499
01:14:45,839 --> 01:14:50,071
- So? What of it?
- OK, so tell me, is the sex male?

500
01:14:50,279 --> 01:14:54,158
Not my problem.
Our mission was Louison. You got it.

501
01:14:54,359 --> 01:15:00,275
Louison...is the package here male?
Yes or no?

502
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:06,268
I guess we should check it out.

503
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:14,477
Sorry, Louison, just part of the job.

504
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:18,469
I must have landed in a loony bin.

505
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:23,434
I'm sick and tired of this bullshit.
There's been a mistake, so let me go.

506
01:15:23,639 --> 01:15:26,472
See, guys?
Female through and through.

507
01:15:28,799 --> 01:15:33,589
Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers.
Artichoke Heart here.

508
01:15:33,799 --> 01:15:39,271
I repeat: Artichoke Heart.
In immediate danger.

509
01:15:39,479 --> 01:15:43,438
Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers.

510
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:49,191
- Artichoke Heart is in danger.
- We'll knock them off like flies.

511
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:55,114
- Must be cooking up there.
- You can count on those weirdos.

512
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:58,675
- They'll fix your buddy for good.
- Should we go?

513
01:15:58,879 --> 01:16:01,393
Of course you're going. All of you.

514
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:04,671
- Doesn't she ever shut up?
- They play rough.

515
01:16:04,879 --> 01:16:07,677
But an agreement is an agreement.

516
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:15,476
Who's not in? Rap, you're coming
with me. Milan, Fox, Tourneur...

517
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:20,309
- You take the others. Move it.
- But what about me?

518
01:16:20,519 --> 01:16:22,908
What about me?

519
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:28,512
Don't forget about me. What about me?

520
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:30,471
You assholes.

521
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:50,678
In case I don't come back.

522
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:54,991
Open up.

523
01:16:57,159 --> 01:17:03,394
Give it up, you dimwit.
We'll let you go. I swear.

524
01:17:03,599 --> 01:17:09,276
We won't touch you.
We'll forget the whole thing, OK?

525
01:17:12,519 --> 01:17:17,513
- My cleavers. All of them.
- Right, the cleavers. Kill them off.

526
01:17:17,719 --> 01:17:21,029
- Think you're on a safari, bitch?
- That's my wife.

527
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:26,871
- No men or women, only volunteers.
- You got it. Obedient volunteers.

528
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:34,751
Harm one hair of my daughter's head,
and I'll carve you up into pieces.

529
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:42,035
- So, go get my cleavers. Move it.
- On the double.

530
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:53,595
Where are you?

531
01:17:58,999 --> 01:18:01,149
Where are you?

532
01:18:02,839 --> 01:18:04,830
I don't like this one bit.

533
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:13,348
It won't be long now.
Julie, get out of here.

534
01:18:13,559 --> 01:18:17,950
Yes. It's me they're after.

535
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:22,311
Don't cry. I'll be all right.

536
01:18:22,519 --> 01:18:24,714
- Don't cry.
- It's my contacts.

537
01:18:24,919 --> 01:18:26,398
What?

538
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:52,876
Julie, there's only
one thing left to do.

539
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:08,918
Go on, push. Push.

540
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:28,672
- What are you doing? Move your butt.
- Can't. I've gained too much weight.

541
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:36,869
Wait, turn back. Tourneur, wait.

542
01:20:42,279 --> 01:20:46,158
- Shit, Tourneur's been hit.
- Tourneur's been hit.

543
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:05,671
- Hey, postman. Everything OK?
- I got one. Come and see.

544
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:19,515
- These monsters are everywhere.
- They've lost one.

545
01:21:19,719 --> 01:21:21,675
They won't be back.

546
01:21:32,799 --> 01:21:36,075
Good ol' Tourneur. Hang in there.

547
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:41,679
That lead really weighs you down.

548
01:21:42,919 --> 01:21:47,515
- No other damage?
- Don't worry. We'll get you out.

549
01:21:47,719 --> 01:21:51,075
You all right?

550
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,116
Come on, push.

551
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:11,869
Let me through.

552
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:27,875
- I don't believe this.
- Water's running.

553
01:23:28,919 --> 01:23:32,468
What the hell are they doing?
Stand back.

554
01:23:35,399 --> 01:23:37,549
What the hell are they up to?

555
01:24:01,879 --> 01:24:05,076
Marcel...

556
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:41,871
You OK, Marcel?
Come on, get up. Get up.

557
01:25:04,559 --> 01:25:09,110
Go on! Go! Go!

558
01:25:13,639 --> 01:25:16,676
Julie, follow me.

559
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:25,475
Be careful!

560
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:54,147
Not a minute too soon.

561
01:25:54,359 --> 01:26:00,195
Miss Plusse, you're a dragonfly in
mating season. So a toad like me...

562
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:05,393
Get lost, jerk. I'm in a rush.
Let the lady by, will you?

563
01:26:05,599 --> 01:26:08,397
I go from one footbath
to another. Shit.

564
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:16,833
I despise you. I hate you.

565
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:34,277
This time you're done for, clown.

566
01:26:37,999 --> 01:26:41,355
- Cut the bullshit.
- Right. Cut the bullshit.

567
01:26:41,559 --> 01:26:44,027
Now you're going to start singing.

568
01:26:48,559 --> 01:26:51,471
My cleaver, damn it. Hand it over.

569
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:53,988
- Here, butcher.
- You, here?

570
01:26:54,199 --> 01:26:56,667
This is a job for the Australian.

571
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:05,278
At any rate, you came
at the right time.

572
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,158
No...

573
01:27:20,599 --> 01:27:24,274
- Oh, my God...
- Goddamn Troglos.

574
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:34,867
Bastards. My Julie...

575
01:27:35,079 --> 01:27:38,037
It's all your fault.
You'll pay for this.

576
01:27:56,239 --> 01:28:00,073
I've got something
stuck in my head, right?

577
01:28:01,519 --> 01:28:04,158
Answer me, sausage head.

578
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:12,871
You, tell me. I'm not dreaming, am I?
I've got something stuck...

579
01:30:54,279 --> 01:30:58,875
