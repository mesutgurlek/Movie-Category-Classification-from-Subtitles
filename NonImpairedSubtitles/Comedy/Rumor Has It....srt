1
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,536
And they buried him in the hole.

2
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:18,440
Worked tão hard in benefit
Of the baseball for boys.

3
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,748
- I Will Speak with the Committee.
- We Will Go amanhã?

4
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,155
It based in a Very Real Rumor.

5
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,470
1963 already is arriving!

6
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,376
Everything began in the end of year
of 1962, in my people of...

7
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,282
Pasadena, Califórnia.

8
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,308
When this man and
This woman puied to bed.

9
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,179
He had only 21 and she 42.

10
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,726
Happy New Year!

11
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,125
'They SAY FOR THERE'
'It translated by Ivoglo'

12
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,098
6 Months afterwards finished that
ventures, when the youth...

13
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,793
If puied to bed with another one person.

14
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,928
Não was an anyone.
The unique daughter of that woman.

15
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,169
And for that the things were complicated
maís, three days afterwards...

16
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,634
The daughter be married another man.

17
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,236
Nobody knew to
Ventures of the fiancée.

18
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,273
Nobody, clear, except its mãe.

19
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,844
That could have been the end
Of the story, but não was him.

20
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:32,381
In the following spring
It published a book.

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,122
The author was a colleague
Of studies of the youth.

22
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,029
Não of the that married, of another.
Already know...

23
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,363
What puied to bed with the mãe and the daughter.

24
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,835
The names were changed,
but that não avoided that...

25
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,430
Pasadena did what
Better it knows to do.

26
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,031
Intrigue.

27
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:52,067
- Puied to bed with the son of its friend.
- They Say that was Mary Beth.

28
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,780
- With the boy Bianchi.
- Mary Beth não has a daughter.

29
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,352
Não, but his son is a homosexual.

30
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,780
But by não have
suspicion...

31
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,087
the interest in the scandal
Early it was dispelled.

32
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,323
Guess who came drunken
To the club the past week?

33
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,703
After everything, alone era a book.

34
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,535
Again, be able to have
It been the end of the story.

35
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,974
But afterwards, in 1967,
Inaugurated itself a film.

36
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,970
By God, lady Robinson!

37
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,908
Here we are, brought me to its
marries, gave me a cup...

38
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,545
therefore music and now count me
its personal life and that...

39
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,221
His husband não will arrive at home early.

40
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,249
- AND?
- You try seduce me, Ms. Robinson.

41
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,488
Não is like this?

42
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:52,259
And was as well as the secrets
more hidden of a family...

43
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,697
Of Pasadena come back immortal.

44
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,176
And since então the people in Pasadena
if it asked...

45
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,975
who was the true one
Benjamín Braddock...

46
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,006
And who is to true Ms. Robinson.

47
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,209
Everything this occurred there is
More or less 30 years.

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,587
And what that is going to have with me?

49
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,615
For it answer that, have
That know who I was.

50
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,318
Which, in the winter of 1997,
Was something that I não knew still.

51
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,457
For it be sincere, I have state
Dealing with that all my life.

52
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,364
Sarah. Hello, Sarah.

53
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,503

57
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,717
- That was that?
- Turbulence.

58
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,453
Não was turbulence.
It looked somewhat mechanical.

59
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:51,259
- It is a classical turbulence.
- OK. Não was pilot.

60
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,297
That you não knows.

61
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,631
Since when you have fear of fly?

62
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,830
Não I have fear. Charm-me fly.

63
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,362
That hatefulness by me hurt. I abhor you.

64
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,103
Nena. Where is yours
Ring of commitment?

65
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,135

66
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,707
And what does there?

67
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,346
Already knows... us aviões

68
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,813

69
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,292
Yes. Swell.

70
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,386
And... they stayed fat.

71
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,421
And deincham when lands?

72
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,698

00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,297
- Não had finished.
- OK.

74
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,331
Also be thinking, that is the
End of week of the marriage of Annie.

75
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,403
Não I believe that we should announce
our commitment...

76
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,606
because não I am going to steal to atenção.

77
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,640
- By that continues doing that?
- Because we are in an avião.

78
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:48,076
It is necessary itself calm, truth.

79
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:52,388
- Want to deal in the toilet?
- I Believe that is better a cup of tea.

Times. It will be fantastic.

84
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,422

- That was?
- Fell the shoe. Não imports...

89
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,121
It caught afterwards.

90
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,093

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,992
Não.

93
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,429
Better like this?

94
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,687

I feel very.

100
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,713
Não is tão bad.

101
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,307
See I tarnished me
With the blue water.

102
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,511
And not even I know that kind.

103
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,487
- That kind?
- THE fiancé of Annie!

104
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,855
That kind of bridesmaid I am?

105
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,951
That kind of irmã older I am?

106
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,986
Não we have a mãe. And não
It I helped to choose the dress!

107
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,196
And necessary somewhat old, and
somewhat new, and somewhat blue...

108
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,494
Não I believe that Annie expects that
occupy the place of our mãe.

109
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,098
Não I know. Não I know.

110
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,777
It listens, I hate to say this...

111
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,804
but always it stayed like this
Before of go to see to your family.

112
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,785

113
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,482
It stayed.

114
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,286
Because não I insert there.

115
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,418
Não I insert with nobody.

116
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,453
It inserts with me.

117
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,457
Come here.

118
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,634
Is well?

119
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,664
Because I am able to say to the pilot
That turn around and come back.

120
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,444
And então... we be able to...

121
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,677

122
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,550
- Yes.
- I Have a plan.

123
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,556
When you will go I will expect
here some seconds...

124
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,353
I will tidy myself a little...

125
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,951

126
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,963
And I will do as itself never had seen you.

127
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,989
- Is well?
- Yes.

128
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,447

130
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,919
- I am going to leave... now...
- Yes.

131
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,465
- Contain of the tunnels?
- Tunnels?

132
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,492
There are some tunnels next month the
stadium of the Dodgers...

133
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,698
and since we were small
we held to respiração...

134
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,366
When we passed by car by them.

135
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,069
My father still believes that
that is a lot amused...

136
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,102
and with certainty will try
It convince you to fazêr that.

137
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,847
- Yes.
- But não should do.

138
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,577
By me não do. Of fact,
I plead for that não do...

139
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,381
because my father treats as a
infant, and when leave...

140
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,445
Of the tunnel will be unconscious.

141
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,889
- I Have.
- OK. Now, the tennis.

142
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,917
Always it is a good one
Fear. The wines also.

143
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,986
Episodes of journeys, especially
The Europe. Good subject.

144
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,690
Não fails of firearm
Neither of hardly of death.

145
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,768
And it do what will do,
não fails of Vietnã.

146
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,501
- By that I would do that?
- He worships to speak of the civil war.

147
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,343
- Relaxes, everything will leave well.
- Already I know. Already I know. It is by chance.

148
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,608
Não will pass nothing. I am a lawyer,
It earned the life speaking.

149
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:51,414
I know but itself lock, fails about
That the rams itself vão of Los Angeles.

150
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,824
- A lot obliged.
- There estão!

151
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,851

152
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,827

- Well.

153
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,799

00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,529
- What concealed me?
- Yes.

155
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,594
- It is a pleasure, Jeff.
- Equally.

156
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,436
Which são your intenções with my daughter?

157
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,739
Therefore I will cause to a game of the
Rams that estão in Los Angeles.

158
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,903
Neither fails me of that.

159
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,415
As it can be a league
professional and cause to team...

160
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,850
Of the biggest second market of the country?

161
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,979
- The Rams of San Luis. That is that?
- Não I am able to neither pronounce-him.

Speed limit.

00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,762

164
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,425
- Already knew.

165
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,764

00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,793

- It is its first time in Pasadena?
- Yes, mister.

171
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,352
There is an old one dictated: "Nobody is born in Them
Angeles, all of vão to Los Angeles".

172
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,152
But it was been born in Angeles,
With certainty was born in Pasadena.

173
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,286
By example, I even, and
My wife. And clear, Sarah.

174
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,556
There Sarah learned how to floor
Of bicycle.

175
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,660
And in that alley Bobby
Miller said me that I was ugly.

176
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,470
- Jeff... Jeff...

It is like this that is said.

183
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,986
Fled for live in a bush?

184
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,017
Was 12 old years. Never
It had gone more distant.

185
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,523
If it convinced of that to be adopted.

186
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,556
They say that the trout in the river
São big as cars.

187
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,636
We arrive, we Arrive, we Arrive!

00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,867
Centers of the table. We brought
Roses or white.

The decoration, definitely the decoration.

212
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,251

00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,489
Outside. Now.

276
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,496
I was in Pasadena before.
They left me here in the war...

277
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,522
and my camp was
In the another one block.

278
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,399
God! Não interpret me evil,

279
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,238
But when it asked me

280
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,072

281
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,102

- AND by that said that yes?
- Não I know by that said that yes!

284

285
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,085
And it is the best fiancé that had until today.

286
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,752
That sounds horrible. Não
The enough one you are terrified.

287
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,819
I am I, I am I. The fault is mine.

288
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,386
And... and...

289
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,423
That.

290
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,733
It is Pasadena, nena. It is what
happens when you give the persons...

291
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,603
everything what want and the
They ignore during 100 years.

292
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,632
I want that my life is
Full. I want adventures.

293
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,745
As felt before the
Grandmother asked you in marriage?

294
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,245

295
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,716

296
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,719

And não loved your father, that God
Rests its soul in peace.

301
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,796
But we had something.

302
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,860
And I am able to you this say:
If loves someone...

303

Week before of the marriage.

If não want marry, não
Marries. If want, marries.

336
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,202
If the couple
Quarrel, if divorces.

the personage of Dustin
Hoffman in '' THE Graduate''...

472
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,592

00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,462

00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,194
it stayed pregnant and
Come back for marry with dad.

477
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,205
Perhaps it stayed pregnant.

478
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,835
She loved him? And itself was
Like this: by that returned?

479
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,505
And by that nobody never counted him me?

480
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,539
Especially it should conceal
Of the boys, loquinha.

481
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,781
Of that devils you two
Estão speaking here inside?

482
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,815
- THE marriage is going to begin.

483
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,919

487
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,133
To mamãe liked Beau
Burroughs. It seduced itself and she...

488
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,143
fled with him a
Week before of the marriage.

489
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,169
- Não was like this?
- Não believes in what do you see in the movies.

490
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,573
That is a yes?

491
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,951
I want that know that always
I thought that You Robinson...

492
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,982
was the personage more
Interesting of the film.

493
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,163
The scene of the sedução
Was like this really?

494
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:29,189
- In The real life. Was?...
- You não speaks.

495
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:34,632
We came here, in presence
of God, and before these friends...

496
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:40,000
for it be witnesses and bless it I unitedão...

497
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:43,408
Of Annie and Scott in sacred marriage.

498
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:49,312
It I unitedão of husband and wife
in body, lie and spirit...

499
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:53,715
it was created by God for
happiness of both...

500
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,584
for it help, comfort and
it deliver itself a to another...

501
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,621
In the adversity and in the prosperity.

502
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:04,633
And with sense of responsibility,
In this fragile Land.

503
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,829
Our home.

504
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,209
In Pasadena, the number
Of Beau Burroughs.

505
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,238
Nena, someone like this
Não would live still in Pasadena.

506
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,242
Não, Beau Burroughs, with two R.

507
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,379

Many purchases here!

00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,659

Scott will lead me for have lunch
In the club, I came good-bye say you.

513
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,823
Mamãe always had mãos very smooth.

514
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,927
Yes, beautiful era.

515
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,433

00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:30,077
I also não I am able to
Believe. Não even.

518
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,051
It is very strange. I woke up this manhã and...

519
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,549
I looked at Scott, and I felt...
That looked another one person.

520
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,889
And as felt?

521
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,364
I gave to count that now
I am you of someone.

522
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,932
Não is incredible?

523
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,373
Right away I go!

524
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,139

00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,873

00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,906
I am married, I am married!

527
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,719
Even if return,
Already não são the Rams.

528
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,747
Beyond the more, it will take three
Competitive years.

529
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,453
Second estão the things today in day...

550
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,248

551
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,552

00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,960
Even if não believes, Chase
Manhattan will survive without me.

554
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,628
Não. Knows what? If I go
It do him, I should do him alone.

555
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,932
Never this it said you, but there is
A film based in my family.

556
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,938
It is grave. '' Titanic''.

557
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,503
A little bit one changed, não
Had no boat neither nothing.

558
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,539
But a time I posed
Nude for a chart.

559
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,719
OK. Takes this.

560
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,746
It uses him since São Francisco.

00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,222
Is correctly of that não want that I?...

562
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,251
It obliged.

563
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,654
It finds him and leaves of stayed confused

564
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,597
It is my fiancée, and não imports
Who you light to the altar.

565
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,742
Jeff, I have your telephone!

566
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,915
OK. Good. ''Oi, mister Burroughs.

567
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,192
I believe that you can be my father.''

568
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,221
We hear to speak very
Today about ''Revoluções''.

569
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,358
To revolução informative
That approaches.

570
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,661
To revolução of Internet
That approaches.

571
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,637
And Ché Guevara used to describe...

572
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,139
it used to describe to revolução
as a change in the coração.

573
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:49,583
Excuse, this confêrencia is alone
For participants that itself inscribed.

574
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,119
And for the press.

575
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,148
I am of the press! I am!

576
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,461
As know, Ché studied Medicine.

577
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,431
And when a man of science
it speaks in these we will have...

578
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,491
an itself question that is
Exactly what has in lie.

579
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:07,828
As I am a biographer or enthusiast
Of the Ché, I have my theories.

580
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,805
I believe that spoke of something that perhaps
Saw many times in its life.

581
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,370
The mystery of the recuperação.

582
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,407
The moment in that sick,
Despite of everything, is going to live.

583
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:26,020
It forget the suffering
And it oblige to be cured.

584
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,816
That era a revolução for Ché.

585
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:33,353
It do that the inimaginável
Appear for pure will.

586
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,033
Ladies and riders, to
revolução of the Internet...

587
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,503
Não is going to come.

588
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,530
Already arrived.

589
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,841
They are going to assure the
Domain ''lagosta.net''.

590
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,245
If they organize the market,
They are able to be done both you sew.

591
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:02,287
It knew this about good spring,
Team and Warner vão melt.

592
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,458
That will change to the world.

593
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,192
This is to third company
multimilionária that was created and sold...

594
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,691
In less of ten years. Has
Problems with the commitments?

595
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,596
There are two theories with regard to that
By example...

596
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,000
the people believes that my caste of concentração
it is demasiada short...

597
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,745
for the details of the day by day,
that alone interests me in the ação.

598
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,607
And to another one theory is...

599
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,885
Which was the question?

600
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,914
And now that is going to happen?

601
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,950
Miss Huttinger, as estão
The things in new york?

602
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,220

Of that city. You ask?

This is immense. It is the proxy...

608
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,438
Better of everybody. I treated
straightly with Ken Patterson...

609
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,846
And it believes, I am impressed.

610

Umaa public company.

00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,941
It is one of the most powerful men in this converses
That finishes finishing.

621
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,345
Roger, não.

622
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,815

623
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,187
It obliged.

624
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,256
Miss Huttinger, this is an official or não?

625
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,694
Não is official nothing.

00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,331
Não! Não, não.

628
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,379
My mãe was Jocelyn Richeliu.

629
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:12,078

630
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,282

00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,187

632
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,760
I lament very by your mãe.

633
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,795
It should have been... very small.

634
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,932
Yes, was 9 old years.

635
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,002
She was a good woman.

636
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,144
Like this now it is a journalist?

637
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:50,020
Of certain form. But yes I have
You ask that I want yourself you.

638
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,420
- About?
- About what passed in that time.

639
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,626
Between your mãe and I?

640
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:03,072
And between you and my grandmother.

641
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,167
And also I know about the book.

642
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,670
And the film.

643
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,008
There is some place where
Should be right now?

644
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,888

Read the book. will see the film.

646
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,858
Barely everything passed in any case.

647
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,663
But there are some things that não são.

648
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:35,194
I não I graduated of the University
but I suppose that...

649
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:38,431
'' What abandoned the School''
Was a very bad title.

650
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,503
And in the end, obviously,
I não I fled with your mãe.

651
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,211
Your wallet is touching.

652
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,915

668
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,725
In the Mexico or End, to a
Week before of the marriage.

669
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,555

00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,737
Ah, não.

674
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,544

675
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:32,722

678
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:43,656
Sarah, forgives. Não occurred me
before yourself thought that...

679
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,660
It is possible, even if
It have used, is possible.

680
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,170

- Clear that yes!

681
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,436

682
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,467
- Slip, especially itself a...
- It is impossible.

683
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,471
That I have sons.

684
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,651
- It is sterile?
- Big talk, Beau!

685
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,818
Yes.

686
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,954
But perhaps não was there is 30 years.

687
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,229
39 years, exactly.

688
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,261
As, as the knowledge?

689
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:25,235
- By my trauma testicular blunt.

690
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:30,238
In mine first year of studies, era
The doorman of the team of soccer.

691
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:34,142
In the semifinals, hindered,
a vein running, alone...

692
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:38,987
I left it stop the playing
and its leg was played behind...

693
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,849
and I threw myself to the chão.
And alone we say that...

694
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,554
He gave a kick in the wrong ball.

695
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,725
Trauma...

696
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,760
Testicular blunt?

697
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,498
And that left you sterile.

698
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,573
Have that yes.

699
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:04,604

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,912
OK.

702
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:16,549
It obliged.

703
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,454
Was a pleasure know him,
Mister Burroughs.

704
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:25,001
Was a pleasure know her,
Miss Huttinger.

705
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:28,027
Good-bye.

706
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:35,043
Trauma testicular blunt.

707
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,267
- Is well?
- Yes.

708
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,106
Yes, I am well. Everything...

709
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,136
Everything now is very clear, for me.

710
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:13,239
I came finding answers and I obtained them.

711
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,909
Não I have nothing in common with
my family, but são.

712
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,647
Which is marvelous. It is good.

713
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,351
My mamãe fled for End and had a
Ventures a week before of marry.

714
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:28,357
And returned for a marriage without
Love, which she chose.

715
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:32,225
Well, well.

716
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:36,973
And I should admit that mine
Career não goes to no part.

00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,924
Everything is very well.

722
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,897
Perfect.

00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:24,744
- A lot... Lament
- Não, não, não.

725
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,717

728
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,958
Everything will leave well.

729
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,331

You want itself cheer?

733
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,758
That is a canino of real elephant?

734
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,886
Itself, is.

735
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,953
- Sees those marks?
- Yes.

736
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,363
Heard that a
Elephant never forgets?

737
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:12,391
- Truth.
- Não is truth. There they take notes.

738
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:15,334

- It Expect!

739
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,566
Sarah, I have an idea.
It follows me to current?

740
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,600
- OK.
- A little more...

741
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,946
Não is first person that
Feels anxiety about the future.

742
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,417
Literally, it is the most common one.

743
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:33,617
- As it learns how to knowledge what want?
- Mistaking Me a lot.

744
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,723
I lived a time outside of the country.

745
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,320
I consumed huge quantities of drugs.

746
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,695
Was member of a worship Indian.

747
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,724
Puied to bed with my grandmother.

748
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:52,234
And someone said me the two words
Deeper than I listened.

749
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:59,141
Be present. Like this that now
alone I worry about my universe...

750
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:04,411
immediate, that in the present is
you, I, and the deafening... silence

751
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:07,680
That leave of that machine of disks.

752
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:21,701
- Knows HIM?
- Não I believe that nobody know him well.

753
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,998
I passed time with him.

754
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,237
Where do we go?

755
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,021
I am able to you ask a question?

756
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,859
What happened that
end of week with mamãe?

757
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:57,234
Without clear, intimate details. That
That end of week in End happened?

758
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:04,003
My parents had a house there.

759
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,676
I was stayed there alone,
leaving see himão run and Jocelyn...

760
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,779
Your mãe, simply appeared.

761
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,984
I had had something in the preparatória.

762
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:23,523
For three alone days
we swim, we laugh...

763
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,670
I taught she to surfar.

764
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,696
A manhã I woke up and already não was.

765
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,902
Returned to Pasadena for marry.

766
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,907
Not even knew that
Was committed.

767
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:47,813
Those were the three days
Happier of my life.

768
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:53,619
It is the only moment that recollect
have me sense truly...

769
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,398
In peace.

770

By that believes that she come back?

771
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,464
Security, perhaps. Não I know.

772
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:06,499
Never it said me.

773
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,373
I can see very of her in you.

774
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:18,077
Was a very beautiful woman.

775
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,916
And you also.

776
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,491
I should pass.

777
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,222
That?

778
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:12,137
I lament.

779
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,167
OK.

780
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:18,537

783
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,685
It is very incorrect, I...

784
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,803
Good morning.

785
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:25,831
- Good.
- It is the best medicine for the hangover.

786
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:30,213
5 minutes with the feet about the
head, afterwards run three miles...

787

01:05:05,674 --> 01:05:08,973
- Não is my biological son.
- Necessary of a lot therapy.

947
01:05:10,312 --> 01:05:11,745
That? That said?

948
01:05:11,781 --> 01:05:14,773
That neither is my son
Biological neither it is adopted.

949
01:05:15,918 --> 01:05:19,183
Mine first wife, Cintia,
Will want to have sons. And I não...

950
01:05:19,388 --> 01:05:22,380
It could do that by her.
We use an alternative approach.

951
01:05:23,592 --> 01:05:25,184
- A giver.
- A giver?

952
01:05:25,227 --> 01:05:27,559
The giver, like this that tecnicamente
não is my son, but...

953
01:05:27,596 --> 01:05:30,360
its mãe and I choose não
It say. And it would stay grateful itself...

954
01:05:30,399 --> 01:05:31,957
It did the even.

955
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:34,993
Correctly.

956
01:05:35,738 --> 01:05:38,730
- But it is sterile?
- Não, I lay.

957
01:05:39,942 --> 01:05:43,605
I invented everything for be able to
Put to bed me with my daughter.

958
01:05:43,846 --> 01:05:46,838
That kind of man believes that I am?

959
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:52,485
Excuse.

960
01:05:52,521 --> 01:05:55,547

01:06:06,235 --> 01:06:08,999
And charming.

963
01:06:09,038 --> 01:06:12,030
And generous.

964
01:06:13,476 --> 01:06:16,343
And intelligent.

965
01:06:16,378 --> 01:06:19,370
And consummate.

966
01:06:24,587 --> 01:06:27,579
And it is a good pilot.

967
01:06:31,193 --> 01:06:34,185
Very attractive.

968
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:39,691
It accepted your excuses.

969
01:06:50,012 --> 01:06:53,004
Hopefully não be your father.

970
01:06:55,518 --> 01:06:58,316

971
01:06:58,354 --> 01:07:02,154

976
01:07:10,633 --> 01:07:12,828
Não was... that não was...

977
01:07:12,868 --> 01:07:15,860
- Não I kissed him, he kissed me.
- It Slept with him?

978
01:07:16,372 --> 01:07:19,273
I não will want.

979
01:07:19,308 --> 01:07:21,742
Was very drunken. Não I remember of nothing.

980
01:07:21,777 --> 01:07:24,143
Não is an excuse, but but or less yes.

981
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:26,740
- Jeff, I love you.
- Não say that.

982
01:07:26,782 --> 01:07:29,342
Não say that.

983
01:07:29,385 --> 01:07:32,377
Não I know that happened, but
obviously the commitment...

984
01:07:32,421 --> 01:07:35,879
that you and I we have não
It signifies nothing for you.

985
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:40,862
Jeff, I have a lot fear.

986
01:07:40,896 --> 01:07:43,888
I am tired of the fear.

987
01:07:45,201 --> 01:07:48,193
Jeff, please. Please, listens me!

988
01:07:48,404 --> 01:07:50,804
I know that myself odeia right now. I hate myself.

989
01:07:50,839 --> 01:07:53,933
I am lunatic, as had
it been possessed by another one person...

990
01:07:54,243 --> 01:07:57,235

It has fear, and is mistaken.

By a model more new.

It understands that when did that I
It was 13 years more young than you are now?

Of someone in its life.

1125
01:17:29,317 --> 01:17:32,309
For that you remember
That the youth was finished.

Preparatória of Pasadena.

01:18:12,961 --> 01:18:16,260
I obtained to pass the defense, and
Was for mark a gol.

1139
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:19,264

But I admit that did
Tremendous it confused.

01:18:28,076 --> 01:18:30,442
If it injured in that game, truth?

1149
01:18:49,331 --> 01:18:52,323

01:18:55,804 --> 01:18:58,796
Tremendous it confused.

1152
01:19:16,358 --> 01:19:19,350
For that came, Beau?

1153
01:19:19,761 --> 01:19:22,753
In the first place, if was without good-bye say.

01:19:28,803 --> 01:19:31,795
It is more complicated that that.

Não I know... não I know that acontesse
In your relação, Sarah.

1158

Not even I will ask.

1159
01:19:39,314 --> 01:19:42,306
Alone I came to say a thing.

1160
01:19:44,986 --> 01:19:47,750
When I saw moving away itself of myself last night...

1161
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:50,781
I looked you...

1162

Van with panels of wood.

Was a year more new than I when died.

01:20:34,402 --> 01:20:37,394
Não has idea of as that is strange.

1170
01:20:38,373 --> 01:20:42,104

Perhaps the two we are
Pursuing ghosts.

01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:16,572
It goes ask this is been me the
I begin of a beautiful friendship?

1176
01:21:17,445 --> 01:21:20,437
Não is the same film.

1177
01:21:23,852 --> 01:21:26,446
Good...

1178
01:21:26,488 --> 01:21:29,480

Miss Huttinger.

Binoculos? Perhaps have graceful.

Estão in the suitcase, with his shoes.

For a second moon of honey.

Are going to arrive to Belice this time?

but knew that was able to
It build a life with me.

1211
01:24:08,016 --> 01:24:11,179
It apologized me. If it Offered
To count me everything what passed.

1212
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,618
And...

1213

Luckily, we marry a week
Afterwards and nobody gave to count.

By that we are tão different?

1222
01:25:12,714 --> 01:25:15,581
Não pleases me the tennis.

1223
01:25:15,617 --> 01:25:17,881

1224

- Therefore não try.

1233
01:28:38,186 --> 01:28:40,518
Never that contain, but of boy
I was in an accident...

1234
01:28:40,588 --> 01:28:42,556
Automobilístico. Was 10 old years.

And panel hit the forehead
and tore from here up to here...

1236
01:28:48,329 --> 01:28:52,095
17 sutures, and never I thought that
Would find strange that day, so far.

1237
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:58,335
- Não signified nothing.
- It Signified something for me.

1238
01:29:00,508 --> 01:29:02,772
The words signify something for me.

1239
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:05,779
'' Committed'' it signifies something for me.

1240
01:29:05,813 --> 01:29:08,281
Não signifies '' perhaps marries me''.

1241
01:29:08,316 --> 01:29:11,308
Não signifies '' I will see as I feel''.
''Não I know''. ''Não I am sure''...

1242
01:29:11,519 --> 01:29:16,047
and definitely não signifies '' I go
It leave and try another is pleased me more''.

1243
01:29:18,493 --> 01:29:21,223
It signifies that itself became passionate
by the person with who want...
