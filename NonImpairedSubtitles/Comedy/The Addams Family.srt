854
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:10,619
I'm Wednesday's teacher.

855
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:12,018
Oh, of course.

856
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:14,921
Wednesday's told us
so much about you.

857
00:50:23,266 --> 00:50:25,200
Wednesday is
an excellent student,

858
00:50:25,268 --> 00:50:27,702
but, frankly, I'm concerned.

859
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:30,638
You see, this is
our class bulletin board.

860
00:50:30,707 --> 00:50:32,607
This month our theme
is our heroes--

861
00:50:32,676 --> 00:50:35,144
people we love and admire.

862
00:50:35,212 --> 00:50:38,147
You see, Susan Ringo
has chosen the president.

863
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:39,807
Isn't that sweet?

864
00:50:41,051 --> 00:50:45,215
And Harmony Feld
has picked Jane Pauley.

865
00:50:45,288 --> 00:50:48,155
Have you spoken to her parents?

866
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:52,261
But Wednesday
brought in this picture--

867
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:55,264
Calpurnia Addams.

868
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:57,960
Wednesday's
Great-aunt Calpurnia.

869
00:50:58,034 --> 00:51:00,935
She was burned
as a witch in 1706.

870
00:51:01,004 --> 00:51:04,440
They say she danced naked
in the town square

871
00:51:04,508 --> 00:51:07,068
and enslaved a minister.

872
00:51:07,143 --> 00:51:08,269
Really?

873
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:09,607
Oh, yes.

874
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:11,112
But don't worry.

875
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:12,944
We've told Wednesday

876
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:14,608
college first.

877
00:51:16,152 --> 00:51:19,087
Isn't he adorable?

878
00:51:19,155 --> 00:51:20,952
I made this myself.

879
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:22,082
It's charming.

880
00:51:22,158 --> 00:51:24,626
What is he, a lizard?

881
00:51:24,694 --> 00:51:25,718
An elf.

882
00:51:27,197 --> 00:51:28,892
Look at you.

883
00:51:35,405 --> 00:51:37,100
That's better.

884
00:51:37,173 --> 00:51:39,641
You are too precious for words.

885
00:51:39,709 --> 00:51:43,270
Why, I could just eat you alive.

886
00:51:43,346 --> 00:51:45,246
Oh, no, Margaret. Too young.

Wednesday, Pugsley.

00:52:19,115 --> 00:52:21,015
I changed my mind.

899
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:22,449

It's Mother.

904
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,634
Damn it, where is he?

905
00:52:39,803 --> 00:52:42,237
I never should have used him.

00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:24,111
Gordon.

Oh, good--Oh! Aah!

Oh, my!

Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Ah-ha ha!

924
00:53:36,826 --> 00:53:38,760
How all occasions
do inform against me

925
00:53:38,828 --> 00:53:40,625
and spur my dull revenge.

926
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:42,688
Oh, from this time forth,

927
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:45,257

or nothing worth.

A hit!

930
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:53,872
A very palpable hit.

There were sailors, pirates,

00:54:50,433 --> 00:54:54,369
and a plane full of tourists
from Miami Beach,

943

all lost in the Triangle.

will you take me there someday?

It's a promise.

It's like a dream.

An open grave.

958

It was my first funeral.

959
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:54,619
You were so beautiful.

960
00:55:54,697 --> 00:55:56,824
Pale and mysterious.

961
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,801
No one even looked at the corpse.
