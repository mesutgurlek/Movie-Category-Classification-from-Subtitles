Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,037
Well, congratulate me.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,432
I just managed to finagle reservations
for two at Emilio's.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,310
- How does that sound, honey?
- Sounds good to me, sweetie.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,355
That is wonderful, Willie.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,151
What, is she coming too?
I thought this was gonna be our night.

00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,797
Oh, for heaven's sake, ALF,
it's Valentine's Day.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,271
Kate and I are looking forward
to spending an evening alone together.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,956
It's what keeps us from becoming bitter.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,914
I'll just spend Valentine's Day alone...

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,676
...without romance, without love...

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,113

Oh, please, Willie? Stay home.
We'll order out. It'll be my treat.

By the way, can I borrow
a couple of hundred till payday?

- Oh, my hands.

Look at them.
They're shaking like a schoolboy's.

One of my favorite movie stars
just moved into this neighborhood.

"Louise Beaumont."
Why does that name sound so familiar?

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,030
Oh, she was the aging vamp
in <i>Footlight Fancies...</i>

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,876
...and she was the tap-dancing bag lady
in <i>Broadway and 74th...</i>

37
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,160
...and she played the Swedish bombshell
in <i>Stage Door Yohnny.</i>

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,950
"I love you, Yohnny, you big yerk."

Oh, I remember Louise Beaumont.

She was a minor movie star in her day.

Willie, Louise is a queen...

42

...and her castle's just a few blocks
from here.

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,433
"Sunset Villa"? ALF, it's not a castle.

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,239
It's a retirement home.

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,236
It's not unlike the place
I'll be staying in long before my time.

46
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,238
Let's do something mad, Willie.

47
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,194
Grab your Polaroid.
We'll swing by the home.

- No, no, no. You see...

Good night, ALF. We'll bring you
what's left off of our plates.

Oh, boy, oh, boy.
I'm "yumping" for "yoy."

60
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,880
Willie doesn't understand.
He has his woman.

Oh. But I'll need a clever disguise.

Maybe Kate's wedding dress.
Haven't worn that in a while.

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,914
No. White always makes me look
too busty.

Oh, wow.

68

For those of you
who remember back that far.

Do you eat and drink
like normal humans?

I think he's here to make us young.

that Opie directed, remember?

Oh, yes.

119
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,716

unless you're a family member.

There's such a thing as rules,
you know.

126
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,557
Well, I'm her ex-husband, okay?

127
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,679
I just wanna get a quick snapshot
for old times' sake.

Who does she think she is?
Roseanne Barr?

141
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,880
Gee, she seemed so much friendlier
in <i>Cellblock Serenade.</i>

142
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,398
- She treat all her fans this way?
- Forget about her. Let's talk about you.

143
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,199
You've been all over the universe.

What an incredible amount of knowledge
you must have.

Tell us, what's it like in outer space?

Well, it's empty.

It's big. It's cold.

148
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,829
It's like <i>Star Trek V</i> without the toupees.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,559
Well, ciao.

150

Oh, where are you going?
Where's he going?

Sorry. My mission's accomplished here

Can we mess with him first?

Uh....

What?

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,997
Dance with her!

317
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,991
She's already dancing.
She didn't want me, the witch.

318
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,640
No, no, Louise.

319
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,360
Look, just dance with her, will you?
Do it for me.

320
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,637
Do it as a favor, huh?

321
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,433
Uh-oh.

Would you like to dance?

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,318
I hope she asked me to dance.

Well, Tonto,
I think our work here is done.

325

Jack, watch the hands.

326
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,239
I run a clean dance hall here.

Willie, I see you got my message.
Come on over.

Oh, look. We have a visitor.

Who died?

00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,032
What were you thinking? I can't believe
you'd expose yourself like this.

338
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,558
- What? I'm wearing a sweatshirt.
- You know what I mean.

Hey, lighten up. I'll fill you in later.

...and, of course, Louise Beaumont.

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,877
- How do you do?
- This is my best friend, Willie.

Hello. It's nice to meet you.
I'll pay for the damages.

- Come on. We should be going.
- Just a second.

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,639
I have to say goodbye now.

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,554
I'll always remember you guys.

I only wish you could say
the same about me.

Goodbye, ALF.

I want you to have this.

It's the scarf I wore in

Oh, thank you.

Wow. I wish I had something
to return the favor.
