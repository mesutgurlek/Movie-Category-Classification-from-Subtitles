00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,675
AND A WEEK LATER A LADY
ON THE BLOCK GAVE BIRTH
TO TRIPLETS.

567
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,178
I THOUGHT SHE WAS BITTEN
BY A GREAT DANE.
[ Laughs ]

568
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:01,188
THAT'S PERFECT.
WE'LL DUMP IT IN THE WATER.
THEY'LL NEVER FIND IT.

569
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,693
WHAT'S IT FEEL LIKE
TO BE DEAD FOR 200 YEARS ?

570
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,697
IT'S LIKE SPENDING A WEEKEND
IN BEVERLY HILLS.

571
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:14,201
HEY, DON'T BOTHER TO HELP.
IT'S A LIGHT CAR.

572
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:18,205
WERE YOU SCARED ?
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD ?

573
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,707
DO I BELIEVE IN GOD ?

574
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:25,212
[ Panting ]  I'M WHAT
YOU CALL A TELE-OLOGICAL
EXISTENTIAL ATHEIST.

575
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,714
I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S AN
INTELLIGENCE TO THE UNIVERSE...

576
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,217
WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF CERTAIN PARTS OF NEW JERSEY.

577
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,220
WHY IS IT I NEVER UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ?

578
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,224
WHY ?  DO YOU BELIEVE
IN GOD ?

579
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:41,228
WELL, I BELIEVE THAT
THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE
WHO WATCHES OVER US.

580
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,730
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S THE GOVERNMENT.

581
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,234
MILES.  MILES,
DID YOU EVER REALIZE...

582
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,737
THAT "GOD" SPELLED BACKWARDS
IS "DOG" ?

583
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,743
- YEAH.  SO ?
- MAKES YOU THINK.

584
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:02,249
YEAH.  YOU WANNA
PUSH THE CAR, PLEASE ?

585
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,251
COME, COME PUSH THE CAR,
WILL YA ?

586
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,755
READY ?
YEAH.

587
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,757
ALL RIGHT.  LET'S GO !

588
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:25,272
NICE WORK.
JUST MY LUCK.  IT LANDED
ON THE BACK OF A TURTLE.

589
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,776
[ Miles ]
HEY, THIS IS WHERE
THEY FIRST BROUGHT ME.

590
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:34,281
IT LOOKS DESERTED.
OH, WE REALLY
HAVE GONE WRONG.

591
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,784
[ Luna ]
HEY.  HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

592
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,287
YEAH, I WONDER
WHO THEIR DECORATOR IS.

593
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,789
SHH !
I HEARD SOMETHING.
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

594
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,792
IT'S NOTHING. 
 IT'S PROBABLY FUTURISTIC MICE.
MILES, I'M SCARED.

595
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:49,296
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE
SCARED OF.  YOU'RE WITH ME.
[ Objects Clattering ]

596
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,298
[ Gasps ]
I DID THAT.

597
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,800
[ Continues
  Gasping ]

598
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:59,306
FOR GOD SAKES,
GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF.
YOU NEED A DRINK.

599
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,809
COME ON.  A DRINK.

600
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,367
WHO ARE YOU ?
ME ?

601
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,369
GET OFF MY CHANNEL.

602
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,876
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

603
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,379
WHO IS
THAT GUY ?

604
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,382
SEE, I COULDN'T MAKE ENOUGH
MONEY, UH, PLAYING JAZZ,

605
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,385
SO I HAD TO OPEN UP
THE HEALTH FOOD PLACE.

606
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,887
[ Luna ]
WEREN'T YOU ANY GOOD ?
YEAH, I WAS ALL RIGHT.

607
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,889
BUT I ALWAYS
FELT THAT IN ORDER
TO REALLY PLAY JAZZ,

608
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,891
YOU HAD TO BE BLACK.

609
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,894
I'M JUST A MULATTO.
YOU ?

610
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,897
YEAH.  YOU KNEW THAT
ABOUT ME, DIDN'T YOU ?
NO.

611
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,899
YEAH, I AM.
COME ON.
YOU'RE JOKING.

612
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,901
NO, I WOULDN'T KID
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

613
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,904
MY FATHER WAS BLACK
AND MY MOTHER WAS WHITE
AND VICE VERSA.

614
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,907
OH, COME ON, MILES.
YOU ARE JOKING.

615
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:44,911
YEAH, I'M ALWAYS JOKING.
YOU KNOW THAT.
IT'S A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

616
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,914
DO YOU WANT
TO PERFORM SEX WITH ME ?

617
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:52,419
PERFORM SEX ?
I-I-I DON'T THINK
I'M UP TO A PERFORMANCE.

618
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,921
BUT I'LL REHEARSE WITH YOU
IF YOU LIKE.
OKAY.

619
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,924
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANNA.
THEY HAVE A MACHINE HERE.

620
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,926
MACHINE ?  I'M NOT GETTING
INTO THAT THING.

621
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,429
I'M STRICTLY A HAND OPERATOR.

622
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,932
I DON'T LIKE ANYTHING
WITH MOVING PARTS
THAT ARE NOT MY OWN.

623
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,936
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU HAVEN'T HAD
SEX FOR 200 YEARS.

624
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,439
TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR
IF YOU COUNT MY MARRIAGE.

625
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,441
WHAT DID
YOUR WIFE DO ?

626
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,943
SHE WAS A HIT MAN
FOR THE MAFIA.

627
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,947
WAS--
 WAS SHE BEAUTIFUL ?
YEAH, SHE WAS GREAT.

628

YOU KNOW, BLONDE HAIR,
 YOU KNOW ?

629
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,453
GREAT UPTURNED NOSE.
YOU KNOW, IT WAS
REALLY DYNAMITE.

00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,956
TWO BLUE EYES.
ONE ON EITHER SIDE,
OF COURSE.

631
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,459
I LIKED THE ARRANGEMENT.
THAT'S WHY I MARRIED HER.

632
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,461
SEE, YOU ARE.
YOU'RE TEASING ME AGAIN.

633
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,463
OH, NO.
YES.

634
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:40,967
YOU THINK I'M STUPID.
NO.  HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT ?

635
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,971
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
BRIGHT AND SENSITIVE AND--

636
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,973
BEAUTIFUL.
BEAUTIFUL.

637
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,476
YEAH, WELL THEN
HOW COME YOU'RE
NOT ATTRACTED TO ME ?

638
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,978
MEN GO CRAZY
OVER ME.

639
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:55,482
I'M GREAT PHYSICALLY.
I GOT A PHD IN ORAL SEX.

640
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,485
DID THEY MAKE YOU TAKE
ANY SPANISH WITH THAT ?
WHAT ?

641
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,988
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS AN ENGLISH MAJOR MYSELF.
YOU KNOW, CHAUCER, POPE.

642
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:05,992
I MINORED IN FOREPLAY.
IT'S A TWO-CREDIT COURSE
AT N.Y.U.

643
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,495
MILES !  YOU'RE NOT
TAKING ME SERIOUSLY.

644
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,998
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY
WHEN YOU SAY, "DO YOU WANT
TO PERFORM SEX WITH ME ?"

645
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:17,504
I--  IT'S SO COLD.
I NEED TO BE WARMED UP
AND SENT FLOWERS, ROMANCED.

646
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,006
SEX IS DIFFERENT
TODAY, YOU SEE ?

647
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:23,009
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEMS.
EVERYBODY'S FRIGID.

648
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,512
OH, THAT'S--
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

649
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:29,015
ARE THE MEN IMPOTENT ?
YEAH, YEAH,
MOST OF THEM.

650
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:32,018
EXCEPT FOR THE ONES
WHOSE ANCESTORS
ARE ITALIAN.

651
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:36,022
RIGHT.  I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING IN THAT PASTA.

652
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,035
YOU WANNA GET
IN THE MACHINE NOW ?

653
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:53,039
OH, YOU KNOW,
WE DON'T NEED THAT.
YOU KNOW, REALLY, I--

654
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,042
REALLY, I THINK IT'D BE
GREAT IF WE DID, MILES,
AND I WOULDN'T BE FRIGID.

655
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,545
YOU WON'T BE FRIGID WITH ME.
I--  BELIEVE ME.
NOBODY EVER IS.

656
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,548
I GOT THE MAGIC FINGERS.
YOU'RE GONNA BE--  I SWEAR.

657
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:05,051
I'VE CURED MORE WOMEN
OF FRIGIDITY.
THAT'S MY SPECIALTY.
OH.

658
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,555
TWO MINUTES IN BED WITH ME,
AND YOU'LL SELL THAT THING
FOR SCRAP IRON.

659
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,057
REALLY.  I GOT
A LOT OF FAST MOVES.

660
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:14,060
REALLY.  THE ONLY THING
IS I HAVE A LITTLE ASTHMA.

661
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,563
SO IF YOU HEAR SOME WHEEZING
WHILE WE'RE DOING IT,
YOU KNOW IT'S ME.

662
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,566
BUT, YOU KNOW, JUST GIVE ME
A DECENT BURIAL AND--

LISTEN, HIDE IN THIS ROOM.
I'M GONNA LEAD THEM AWAY.

01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,390
MILES, I WROTE A SONG
ABOUT THE REVOLUTION.

848
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:08,394
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
ANY REVOLUTION UNLESS
WE STOP THE AIRES PROJECT.

849
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:11,397
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT.
YOU JUST RELAX.  NOW, LISTEN.

?? REBELS ARE WE ??

01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,404
?? BORN TO BE FREE ??

01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:22,908
?? JUST LIKE THE FISH
  IN THE SEA ????

853
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:39,425
OOH, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU WERE KISSING.

854
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:42,928
OH, MILES, I WAS
JUST TELLING ERNO
ABOUT AIRES DAY.

855
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,930
HE HAS A PLAN,
MILES.

856
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,433
YOU TELL HIM, ERNO.

857
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,935
RIGHT, DARLING.

858
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:53,439
MILES, THIS IS
A ONE-CHANNEL RADIO.
WHA-WHAT, DARLING ?

859
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:57,443
NOW, THIS-- THIS
IS A PHONY THUMBPRINT.

860
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:00,946
IT'LL ALLOW HER
TO PASS THROUGH
THE SECURITY SCANNING DEVICE.

[ Luna ]
WE'RE GONNA STEAL OPERATING
GOWNS AND POSE AS DOCTORS.

862
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:07,453
AND THAT'S HOW
WE'RE GONNA GET INSIDE.

863
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:19,965
OKAY, TRY NOT
TO APPEAR NERVOUS.

SHAKING LIKE A LEAF.
HOW DO YOU WANT ME TO SHAKE ?

866
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:29,475
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.
SO HOW COME YOU'RE SHAKING ?

867
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,978
'CAUSE YOU'RE--
YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.
DON'T BLAME ME.

868

[ Nervous Chuckling ]
HELLO.

869
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,483
WOULD YOU GET
A GRIP ON YOURSELF ?

870
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:40,486
YOU'D PROBABLY FEEL
A LOT SAFER WITH
MR. WHITE-TEETH BACK THERE.

871

THE REBEL CHIEFTAIN
WITH THE WALL-TO-WALL
MUSCLES ON HIS CHEST.

872
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,492
YOU MEAN ERNO ?

873
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:49,995
ERNO.  IT'S A GREAT NAME
IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE THE STAR
OF A VAMPIRE MOVIE.

874
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:51,997
HE'S BRILLIANT.
YEAH, I KNOW.

875
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:54,500
HE COULDN'T BE WITH US TODAY.
HE'S GOTTA GO TAKE
HIS HANDSOME LESSON.

876
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,503
OH, YOU'RE JEALOUS.
JEALOUS ?  ARE YOU KIDDING ?

877
01:10:57,503 --> 01:11:00,005
WITH A BODY LIKE MINE,
YOU DON'T GET JEALOUS.

878
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,508
CERTAINLY YOU DON'T
EXPECT ME TO TIE
MYSELF DOWN TO ONE MAN.

879
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,010
MY LOVE IS A FREE GIFT TO
ALL THE BOLSHEVIK BROTHERS.

I CREATED A BOHEMIAN MONSTER.

GROUP SEX WITH THE ROBOTS.

YOU'RE ATTRACTING ATTENTION.

IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU.

"IF IT GETS SCREWED UP,
 IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU."

NO, YOU GET YOUR PART RIGHT.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL I'M DOING HERE.
I'M 237 YEARS OLD.

894
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:43,549
I SHOULD BE COLLECTING
SOCIAL SECURITY.

895
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,058
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE DIAGRAM ?

896
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,561
HERE'S THE FAST FORWARD.
THAT'S THE DUAL CONTROL.
THAT'S THE MANUAL.

897
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:58,063
THAT'S THE OVERHEAT.
 THAT'S THE REWIND.
WE'VE BEEN OVER ALL THIS.

898
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,065
YES, I KNOW, BUT I WANNA
MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT.

899
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:03,068
I'M THE GUY THAT'S
GOING OUT THE WINDOW.  IT'S
A LONG DROP TO THE PAVEMENT.

900
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,070
I'M LIABLE
TO BRUISE MY SMOCK.

901
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:09,575
ALL RIGHT, MILES,
DON'T WORRY.  I GOT IT.
THIS IS THE MANUAL.

902
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:13,078
- NO, THAT'S THE REWIND.
- THEN THIS IS THE MANUAL.

903
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:16,081
NO, THAT'S THE DUAL CONTROL.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HAD IT.

904
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:19,084
I DO.
 I HAVE IT.  I HAVE IT.

905
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:21,587
DO YOU LOVE ERNO ?

906
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:25,591
OH, MILES, I DON'T KNOW.
UH--

907
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:40,105
ALL RIGHT,
THE COAST IS CLEAR.
START LOWERING ME.

908
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:44,610
- THIS IS... MANUAL.
- NO, THAT'S FAST FORWARD !

909
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,654
OH !  OH, MILES.

OH !  OH, LOOK,
I-- I, UH--

911

I GOT SOME
OF THE TAPE AROUND.

912
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,160
FOR A MINUTE
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO WORK THE MACHINE.

913
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,664
ERNO SAID TO TAKE
THE NORTH ESCALATOR.

914
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,166
I'M RUNNING THIS, NOT ERNO.
WE'RE GOING MY WAY.

915
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,669
IT'S ERNO'S PLAN.
HE KNOWS WHAT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

916
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:47,172
WHY ?  'CAUSE HE'S HANDSOME,
SO HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ?

917
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:49,174
HE'S GOT CAPPED TEETH.
DID YOU KNOW THAT
ABOUT ERNO ?

918
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:51,677
HE'S GOT CAPPED TEETH.
EVERY ONE.  HE'S
GOT CAPPED GUMS.

919
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:54,179
ERNO IS AN ARCHITECT
AND A MATHEMATICIAN.

920
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,682
YEAH, BUT
CAN HE DO THIS ?

921
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:01,687
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
FINE.
WE'RE GOING MY WAY.

922
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:08,193
OH, DR. TEMKIN,
THERE YOU ARE.

923
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:11,196
WILL YOU COME WITH US ?
THE MEETING IS THIS WAY.

924
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:13,198
DOCTOR.

925
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,207
WE'RE DOCTORS.
WE'RE TWO BIG DOCTORS.
WE'RE NOT IMPOSTORS.

926
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:25,210
DR. TEMKIN,
COULD WE PLEASE ?
BIG DOCTOR.

927
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,713
EYES, EAR, NOSE
AND THROAT.
PLEASE, MAY WE ?

928
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,716
MAY WE, DOCTOR, PLEASE ?

929
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:35,721
NICE WORK.
THAT'S A BAD BREAK.  THEY
THINK WE'RE SOMEONE ELSE.

930
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:39,224
I KNOW.  IF WE'D FOLLOWED
ERNO'S INSTRUCTIONS,
EVERYTHING'D BE OKAY.

931
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,727
I DON'T WANNA HEAR
ABOUT ERNO ANYMORE.

932
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,730
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES ME S-STUTTER.

933
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,733
IT'S ALWAYS ERNO.
I'M TIRED OF HEARING
ABOUT HIM.

934
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:50,235
NO MORE ERNO.
SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP !

935
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,738
ALL RIGHT.

936
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,746
[ Man's Voice ]
GENTLEMEN, NONE OF YOU HAVE
EVER MET BEFORE...

937
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,749
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS
OF SECURITY.

938
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,251
BUT NOW
AIRES DAY IS HERE.

939
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:10,756
I REALIZE
THAT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY
WILL COME AS A GREAT SHOCK.

940
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:14,259
HOWEVER, I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY.

941
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:18,263
TEN MONTHS AGO,
OUR LEADER SUFFERED
A HORRIBLE ACCIDENT...

942
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:22,768
WHEN A BOMB, PLANTED
IN HIS HOME BY MEMBERS
OF THE UNDERGROUND, EXPLODED.

943
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,270
NATURALLY,
IT WAS KEPT QUIET.

944
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,774
BUT SINCE THEN,
WE HAVE VIRTUALLY BEEN
A LEADERLESS SOCIETY.

945
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:32,277
UNFORTUNATELY,
PREPARATIONS FOR A SUCCESSOR...

946
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,279
HAVE NEVER BEEN
ADEQUATELY CLEAR.

947
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:38,283
IN SHORT, WE HAVE
BEEN IN THE THROES
OF A MAJOR CRISIS.

948
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,786
AS FOR OUR LEADER,

949
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:46,291
THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
RUSHED TO THE SCENE
OF THE ACCIDENT IMMEDIATELY,

950
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:49,795
BUT ALL THAT REMAINED
OF HIM WAS THIS.

951
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,297
THIS IS OUR LEADER'S NOSE.

952
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:55,801
USING GREAT PRESENCE OF MIND,

953
01:15:55,801 --> 01:16:00,305
WE RUSHED THE NOSE
TO OUR CLOSEST DELTA LABORATORY
WHICH IS HERE...

954
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:03,809
WHERE, THROUGH MASSIVE
BIOCHEMICAL EFFORT,

955
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:07,312
IT HAS BEEN KEPT ALIVE
FOR NEARLY A YEAR.

956
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:11,316
OUR DREAM HAS BEEN
THAT BY CLONING,

957
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:15,821
WE WOULD REDUPLICATE
THE ENTIRE LEADER AGAIN.

958
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:19,825
CLONING, FOR THOSE OF YOU
UNFAMILIAR WITH BIOLOGY,

959
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,829
IS A PROCESS BY WHICH
USING ONE SINGLE CELL,

960
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:27,332
A DUPLICATE OF THE PERSON
IT CAME FROM COULD BE FORMED.

961
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:32,838
TILL NOW WE'VE ONLY HAD
LIMITED EXPERIMENTAL SUCCESS.

962
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:37,342
BUT ALL EFFORTS
HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO CLONING
OVER THE PAST TEN MONTHS.

963
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:40,846
AND NOW WE FEEL CONFIDENT
WE CAN REPRODUCE OUR LEADER...

964
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,348
IN PERFECT TACT
FROM HIS NOSE.

965
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:48,353
GENTLEMEN, WITH GOD'S HELP,
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS,

966
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:50,355
WE WILL HAVE
OUR LEADER BACK.

967
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:53,859
AND WE WILL THEN COORDINATE
AIRES PHASE TWO...

968
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:57,863
WHICH WILL EXTERMINATE
ALL DISSIDENT FACTIONS
ON SIGNAL...

969
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:00,365
FROM OUR REBORN LEADER.

970
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:08,373
MILES, IT'S A NOSE.
YES, I KNOW.
I WAS RIGHT HERE.

971
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:11,877
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ?
RADIO ERNO IMMEDIATELY.
NOW IS THE TIME TO STRIKE.

972
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:15,380
THE LEADER IS SUFFERING
FROM A TERRIFIC HANDICAP.
HE HAS NO HEAD OR BODY.

973
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,883
WE'RE NOT FULLY PREPARED.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY'RE IN A STATE OF CHAOS.

974
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,386
IF WE STRIKE QUICK,
WE GOT 'EM.
OKAY, GIVE ME THE RADIO.

975
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:23,388
I DROPPED THE RADIO.
YOU DROPPED THE RADIO ?

976
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,891
IT FELL OUT OF MY POCKET
WHEN I WAS HANGING OUTSIDE.
FELL OUT OF YOUR POCKET--

977
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:27,893
WILL YOU STOP REPEATING
EVERYTHING I SAY ?

978
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,895
WILL YOU STOP REPEATING
EVERYTHING I SAY ?
GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF.

979
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,398
WE GOTTA STOP 'EM.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY.
WE GOTTA STEAL THE NOSE.

980
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:36,401
HOW ?
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
I NEVER STOLE AN ORGAN BEFORE.

981
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,404
WAIT A MINUTE !
I GOT AN IDEA.

982
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:41,907
THE NOSE IS IN
 THE OPERATING CHAMBER.
RIGHT.

983
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:45,410
WE GO TO THE FLOOR BELOW,
CUT A HOLE IN THE CEILING...

COME UP UNDER THE NOSE
AND HIDE IT UNDER MY COAT.

01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:51,536

WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO PERHAPS
IS POSTPONE THE CLONING.

SEE, I THINK WHAT
THE COMPUTER IS FAILING
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT...

1023
01:19:58,543 --> 01:20:00,545
IS WHAT I CALL
THE PINOCCHIO FACTOR,

THAT THE SQUARE ROOT

YOUR OPINION, DOCTOR ?

01:20:08,553 --> 01:20:11,556
SHOULD WE PROCEED
WITH THE CLONING

YOU KNOW, SCIENCE IS
AN INTELLECTUAL DEAD END.

1121
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:05,910
YOU KNOW, IT'S A LOT
OF GUYS IN TWEED SUITS
CUTTING UP FROGS...

1122
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:07,912
ON FOUNDATION GRANTS AND--

1123
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:10,415
OH, I SEE.  YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IN SCIENCE.

1124
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:13,918
AND YOU ALSO DON'T BELIEVE
THAT THE POLITICAL
SYSTEMS WORK.

1125
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:16,421
AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN GOD, HUH ?
RIGHT.

1126
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:19,424
SO THEN,
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IN ?

1127
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,927
SEX AND DEATH.

1128
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:25,930
TWO THINGS THAT COME
ONCE IN MY LIFETIME.

1129
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:29,434
BUT AT LEAST AFTER DEATH
YOU'RE NOT NAUSEOUS.
