Leslie Chow stale $21 million from me...

319
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,084
an a Tuesday.

320
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,049
On, Gad.

321
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,118
I lacked everywhere for him.

322
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,191
But he's gone, no one can find him.

323
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:27,797
Until the little cockroach got
himself pinched in Bangkok.

324
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,831
Sal pay him a visit.

325
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,137
<i>MARSHALL: I offer him a truce.</i>

326
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,969
<i>I won't touch a hair on his head.</i>

327
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,601
<i>I just want him to tell
me where my gold is.</i>

328
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,472
<i>He refuses to talk.</i>

329
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,483
Nat only does he refuse to talk to me...

330
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,562
he has no communication with anyone
from the outside...

331
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,027
except you!

332
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,530
<i>He'!-</i>

333
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,100
It's unfair!

334
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,895
Alan, you been talking to Chow?

335
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,630
- They've been writing letters.
- Hey, those are private!

336
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:15,171
"Dear Leslie, OMG, the McRib is back!
Why was it ever gone?"

337
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,506
Exactly!

338
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,581
"Dear Alan,
I threw urine an prison guard today.

339
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,877
Blamed it an cellmate. Wish you were here."

340
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,644
Yeah, I wish I could've seen that.

341
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,916
Letter after letter of total nonsense...

342
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,082
except for one common thread:

343
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,727
You guys!

344
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,823
The wolf pack.

345
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,396
Jesus Christ, Alan.

346
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,169
Five weeks ago, Chow escaped
from maximum security detention.

347
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,068
Oh, fuck.

348
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,230
He stowed aboard a shipping freighter
bound for the West Coast.

349
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,640
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

350
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,942
Alan, if you know where he is,
you tell this man right now.

351
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,185
Phil, I don't know, I swear.
I haven't talked to him in months.

352
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,955
We gotta do it the hard way.

353
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,761
STU: Oh, no!
DOUG: What the fuck? Hey!

354
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,127
MARSHALL: Let's go.
DOUG: Hey! Na! Na! What the fuck?

355
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,461
Whoa, what are you doing?

356
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,772
Doug is my insurance. He stays with me.

357
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,533
You don't give me Chow,
I blow his brains out.

358
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,971
You go to the caps...

359
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:21,671
I blow his brains out.

360
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,439
That's insane! We don't even know
where the fuck he is!

361
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,446
Na one dues.

362
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:30,052
But I figure the wolf pack
has the best chance cf finding him.

363
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,278
You have three days.

364
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,454
Get to work.

365
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,986
Can you take Stu instead?

366
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,490
Fuck you, Alan.

367
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,088
Shit.

368
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,836
Shit!

369
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,933
PHIL: Alan. ALAN: Yeah, Phil?

370
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,011
PHIL: I need you to roll aver here
and chew off these hand-ties.

371
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,408
ALAN: Okay.

372
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,907
Oh. ALAN: Damn it!

373
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,245
Ow. Oh, fuck!

374
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,748
ALAN: Gut a little tan much steam.
PHIL: Get off me.

375
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,948
ALAN:
All right, let me just shimmy dawn.

376
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,422
- Would you just hold still? Hold still!
PHIL: Ow.

377
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:11,890
STU: Help!

378
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,287
Help!

379
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,428
PHIL: Holy shit.

380
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,136
What are we gonna do, Stu?

381
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,972
STU: We're gonna go to the police.
- Oh, no, we're fucking not.

382
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,176
Did you hear that guy?

383
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,815
He will kill Doug, period.

384
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,983
Chow is a cancer.

385
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,484
He's been a cancer
since the first day we met him.

386
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,384
We're gonna hand him aver to Marshall
and then it's dune.

387
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,785
- Hey, Phil.
- Alan, not now.

388
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,052
But I need you, Stu. I can't do this alone.

389
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,060
Dc what alone?
We have no idea where he even is.

390
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,357
- Phil.
- What, Alan?

391
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,091
I was gonna say I gut this strange e-mail
the other day.

392
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,703
I wasn't sure what it meant,
but new I think it might be from Chow.

393
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,133
"Fatty, it feels good to be out."

394
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,334
I'm close by. Tell no one.
I'll be in touch.

395
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,706
"Chow."

396
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,076
<i>This says "Chow."
How did you not know this was from Chow?</i>

397
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,652
At the time, I thought it was "Chow"
like "goodbye."

398
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,482
You know, like, "Chow, arrivederci."

399
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,181
- You know, Sbarro, Papa John's.
- I'm writing him back.

400
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,122
Whoa, wait, wait. Just hold an.

401
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,762
Gonna tell him you're happy he's out
and you'd love to see him.

402
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,091
Och, I would lave to see him.

403
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,596
Dc you even know what's going an?

404
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:28,636
Yes, Ida. Phil's doing all the work,
I'm his assistant...

405
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:32,536
you're standing there looking like an idiot.
I'm gonna arrange a meeting...

406
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,610
- ...and we're gonna take him out.
- "Take him out"?

407
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,906
Who says that?
Haw do we take someone out?

408
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,279
We'll use drugs.

409
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,180
Prescription drugs.

410
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,787
You know, the kind a dentist has access to.

411
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:49,289
Goad luck finding a dentist
who will write fake prescriptions.

412
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,723
Oh, I know one. His name is Stuart Price.

413
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,692
New let's go find a fucking pharmacy.

414
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,058
Whoo! You just got schooled, son.

415
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,797
Are you coming or not?

416
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,403
I don't like this plan.

417
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,131
Okay, then. Ciao.

418
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,267
[ALAN LAUGHS]

419
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,747
I gut a pretty dope sense of humor, bra!

420
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,818
[ALAN CONTINUES LAUGHING]

421
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,816
MAN: This amount with syringes is just weird.
Ga check it out.

422
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,552
Everything okay?

423
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,888
Well, it's just a strange request.

424
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,258
This drug in this amount
and a pack of syringes.

425
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,491
- It's just a little weird.
- Yeah.

426
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,568
It's just kind of an emergency, so...

427
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:37,434
See, that right there, and you're acting
all fidgety, plus you lack like shit...

428
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,837
in our business, these
are all red flags.

429
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,239
I need to call the doctor,
make sure everything's okay.

430
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,473
Aha. You're in luck, because I actually am
the prescribing doctor.

431
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,948
Oh, bay. Another red flag.

432
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,847
It says here you're a dentist.

433
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,153
Yeah. Doctor of Dental Science.

434
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,927
This is fucked up.

435
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,929
Hey, Dad?

436
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,062
I think we gut a live one.

437
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,499
How'd we do'?

438
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,541
We did good.
I got Demerol, a pack of syringes...

439
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,702
and almost last my dental license.

440
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,814
- What about Chow? Anything?
- Na.

441
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,678
Oh, lack at this.
He e-mailed me like 20 minutes ago.

442
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,050
Alan, we've been sit...

443
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,654
Give me the phone, please.

444
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,846
- What does it say?
- Oh, wow.

445
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,185
He wants ta meet Alan tonight at 8.
It says came alone.

446
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,090
- Came alone where?
- A bus stop.

447
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,491
In Tijuana.

448
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,133
Tijuana's the bomb.

449
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,631
Oh, fuck.

450
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,169
Na, that's perfect.
Na, it's like a three-hour drive from here.

451
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,665
Yeah, Stu, try reading a map.

452
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,234
Yeah, Alan, try reading anything ever.

453
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,074
Yeah, Stu, try not having
such big horse teeth.

454
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,479
PHIL:
All right, we need a plan.

455
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,087
They're meeting an a bus bench
in a public place...

456
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,316
so Alan needs to convince Chow
to go someplace more private.

457
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,087
Someplace where we can sneak up on him
and drug him.

458
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:07,686
Like where?

459
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,388
I don't know, like an alley.

460
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,897
What about a movie theater?

461
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,330
Fuck, that's actually a great idea.

462
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,798
The lights go dawn...

463
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,032
we take the seats behind him,
we jab him and it's fucking done.

464
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,038
I'll jab him if you want.
I've drugged people before.

465
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,879
Yeah, us.

466
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,539
No offense, but we're not letting you
handle any drugs. You'll kill someone.

467
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,276
Oh, please, I'm an expert.

468
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,250
Remember the marshmallows in Thailand?

469
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,544
Yeah?

470
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,158
I made it so you could eat at least three
before hitting a fatal dose.

471
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,917
Wait.

472
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,793
Sc you're saying I would've died
if I had had four?

473
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,361
Nobody eats four marshmallows, Stu.

474
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,163
That insane theory is the only reason
