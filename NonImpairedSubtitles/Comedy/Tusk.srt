1
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,833
<i>I'm gonna... I'm
gonna fucking piss my pants.</i>

2
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,239
<i>Hey,
if you wanna watch this video,</i>

3
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:43,142
<i>please go to our website
NotSeeParty.com.</i>

4
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,243
N-O-T...

5
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,344
S-E-E...

6
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:46,645
And not "Nazi" with a "Z."

7
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,380
That'd be like cross-dressing

8
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,416
Adolf Eichmann-Liza Minnelli
impersonator.

9
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:53,085
If I... If I die of laughter
during this segment,

10
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,420
I don't want you to feel bad.

11
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:55,888
I want you all to know
that I died happy,

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,224
because this video is
the greatest thing that's ever
happened to me.

13
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,659
It's up to like
30 something million.

14
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,161
Here we... Here we go.

15
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,737
Shit!

16
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,440
I'm gonna talk to this kid
about everything.

17
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,076
I wanna know...
I wanna know
what he masturbates to,

18
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,979
I wanna know
if he kept the leg.
Did he keep the leg?

19
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,481
I gotta say though, man.
I've watched
this video enough.

20
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,082
I'm starting to feel bad
for the kid.

21
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,451
I'm not laughed out yet
but I'm feeling bad for him.

22
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,788
Feeling bad?
The kid's got tons of hits
'cause he's famous.

23
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,957
Right? I mean what more
do you want? He's got
more hits than I do.

24
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,226
I'm kinda in a
weird way, jealous.

25
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,927
I don't need both legs.
What am I?
I'm not running marathons.

26
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,295
So look out,
you crazy Canucks.

27
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,431
Something weird-ass
this way comes.

28
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,766
Next week, Wanderin' Wallace
takes a raunchy road trip

29
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,503
up to the Great White North
to meet with a star.

30
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,605
My only hope is that
he doesn't cry too much.

31
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,907
Join us next week while
Wallace sits down

32
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:25,844
with the one-legged wonder,
the master of self-mutilation

33
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,480
of Internet humiliation,
the Kill Bill Kid.

34
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,149
Which is about all you can do
if you're the Kill Bill Kid.

35
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,351
You just sit your
one-legged ass down,

36
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,485
- forever.
- Aw.

37
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,020
Oh, it's too easy.
It was right there!

38
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,589
-You're going to hell, man.
-They're like plums,
like low-hanging plums.

39
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,657
I had to grab it.

40
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,159
Until next time,
I'm Teddy Craft.

41
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,494
And this is Wallace Bryton
reminding you to...

42
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,797
Join ze Not-See Party!

43
00:02:58,846 --> 00:02:59,945
Welcome to Canada.

44
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,413
Oh!

45
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,683
Hey, there.

46
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,619
Hey there, yourself,
fellow facial hair aficionado.

47
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,855
Yeah, not as good as you.
My God!

48
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:14,526
- Yeah, years back. Now it's...
- Los Angeles.

49
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,496
A man torn betwixt
Devils and Kings.

50
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,967
Oh! Hockey.

51
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,669
You're damn right, hockey.

52
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,004
Hmm. I don't really
follow hockey.

53
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,640
Okay.

54
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,309
Hands off the counter, please.

55
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,577
Really?

56
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,811
Yeah, really. Thank you.

57
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,346
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

58
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,514
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

59
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,182
Sorry.

60
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,585
When you're visiting the Great
White North of Canada,

61
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,821
you got your Cana-Do's and
you got your Cana-Don'ts.

62
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,723
Top shelf, right there.
Number one.

63
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,825
Don't go tell any Canadian
you don't follow hockey.

64
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,493
Of course!

65
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,928
I should've known that.
It makes 'em sad, right?

66
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,863
A Canadian doesn't get sad.

67
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,699
Sadness was made by the USA.

68
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,167
Oh, come on.
What does that mean?

69
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,270
Take off, it's true.
Right there on our flag.

70
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,538
It's right there
when you look at it.

71
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,373
When you see past that
sacred Maple Leaf,

72
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,507
you know what you see?

73
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,575
A white wall.

74
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,711
You see that in America,

75
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,713
you may be red,
white and blue.

76
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:12,217
But in Canada, you're red,
white but never blue, eh?

77
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,118
Ever.

78
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,020
Got you.
That's actually...

79
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,421
You know, I've never thought
of it that way before.

80
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,523
I always think of Canadians
as just nice.

81
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,626
Well, that right there
is another Cana-Don't.

82
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,427
We're not nice,
we're optimistic.
There is a difference.

83
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,196
- Right.
- And we're tolerant.

84
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,865
- Hmm.
- And we're hung like moose.

85
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,200
Oh!

86
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,505
That's great.

87
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,310
Back to business, then.
What're you doing in Manitoba?

88
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,812
Um,
I'm recording a podcast.

89
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,115
So what I do is, I, uh...

90
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:47,552
I travel around and
I interview weird
or interesting people

91
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,221
and I describe it
to my best friend

92
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:51,990
who does not see it first-hand

93
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,792
since he won't fly anywhere.

94
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,227
It's called The Not-See Party.

95
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,229
Whoa, whoa! Nazi Party?

96
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:00,399
Oh, no.
It's spelled N-O-T-S-E-E,

97
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:03,068
not the other... Hatey one.

98
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,670
You know, that Hitler.

99
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,632
You don't say Hitler
in an airport.

100
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,850
All right.

101
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,371
What the fuck is this?

102
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,431
Hey!

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Oh, shit!

104
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,012
Oh, fuck!

105
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,023
Hey, fucker.
Are you ready for this?

106
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:36,728
Fucking Kill Bill Kid fucking
killed himself, sir!

107
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,331
With his own fucking sword!
Can you believe that shit?

108
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,933
I'm not fucking kidding you.

109
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,435
He couldn't hold out
for two more days,

110
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:46,037
the selfish little peg-legged
piece of shit.

111
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,573
I'm so pissed off right now.
I gotta find a flight
back tonight.

112
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,442
But I'm thinking I don't
wanna come all the way
back with nothing.

113
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,544
We need a show
this week, so...

114
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:56,882
I'm in fucking Winnipeg
in a bar called, uh...

115
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,217
Bar "H."

116
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,253
I don't know what the fuck
I'm gonna do. I'm gonna...

117
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:05,090
Try to find some other
Canadian weirdo up here
I can talk to, but...

118
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,625
I gotta be honest, man.

119
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,294
There is nothing weird
about Canada.

120
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,697
It is painfully
boring up here.

121
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,868
But shit! $550 for
a fucking plane ticket.

122
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,937
Selfish little prick.

123
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,138
I know it's fucked up
to say, but...

124
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,707
God damn it!
It was killing me.

125
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,342
All right.

126
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,379
Signing off from
the Great White North.

127
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,915
<i>¶ Coo loo coo coo,
coo coo coo</i>

128
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,583
<i>¶ Coo loo coo coo</i>

129
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,118
Oh, shit. Beep.

130
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,801
Hey, man,
where is your bathroom?

131
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,512
<i>Hello, I am an old man</i>

132
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,815
<i>who has enjoyed a long
and storied life at sea.</i>

133
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,818
<i>I am a proud Canadian who has
traveled a peculiar path</i>

134
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,954
<i>lo these many years.</i>

135
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,490
<i>And after eons of
oceanic adventure,</i>

136
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,192
<i>I find myself a landlubber,</i>

137
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,095
<i>with Manitoba as
my final port.</i>

138
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,465
<i>I know I do not wish to spend
my remaining years alone</i>

139
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,267
<i>in a giant house.</i>

140
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,309
<i>Not when I have
such stories to share.</i>

141
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,009
No, it's not the room
I'm interested in

142
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,844
as much as you, Mr. Howe.

143
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,479
Yeah, tonight would be...

144
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,381
That'd be amazing, sir.
Yes, thank you.

145
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,450
All right, where am I going?

146
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:42,287
Bifrost? Sounds erotic.

147
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,122
Okay, let me just ask
somebody how far I am.

148
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,825
Excuse me, hey!

149
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,460
Uh, how far is
Bifrost from here?

150
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,829
Bifrost?
Shit! That's far.

151
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,464
Yeah, it's about two hours
from here.

152
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,466
Yeah, the kids here at
the convenience store

153
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,668
are telling me that
it's "aboot"
two hours away.

154
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,703
I hate American guys.

155
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,171
<i>Yeah,
what's your address?</i>

156
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,908
<i>So to this end,
I'm offering a room for rent</i>

157
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,910
<i>in my stately woodland home.</i>

158
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:07,345
<i>This arrangement will be
free of charge,</i>

159
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,981
<i>providing you perform
the simple household chores</i>

160
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,917
<i>I can no longer tend to</i>

161
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,719
<i>from the confines of
this cursed wheelchair.</i>

162
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:18,690
<i>But though I may be old,
I have lived.</i>

163
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,026
<i>And I will tell you all about
my many adventures,</i>

164
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,728
<i>in vivid detail.</i>

165
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,265
<i>Please feel free to call me
at the number below.</i>

166
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,769
<i>Respectfully, Howard Howe.</i>

167
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,010
All right. This better be
fucking worth it.

168
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:50,121
<i>You have arrived
at your destination.</i>

169
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,320
Hello? Hello?

170
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,822
Hello!
Up here, please.

171
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,596
Hello?

172
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,366
Good evening!

173
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,634
Mr. Howe?

174
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,236
Well actually, it's Howard.

175
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,606
Mr. Howard, hey!

176
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:18,109
You know, when people first
become entangled with my name,

177
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,979
it's much like a
French bedroom farce.

178
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,683
Now, Mr. Howe would be
appropriate,

179
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,686
but I prefer the intimacy
of Howard.

180
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,120
Howard.

181
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,290
Now that we have that
unpleasantness out of the way,

182
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,026
may I welcome you
to Pippy Hill, my home.

183
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,328
Oh, yes. It's great.

184
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,365
- It's nice to meet you.
- Pleasure. Pleasure.

185
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,500
Could I interest you
in some tea?

186
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,969
You can. But first, uh...

187
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,504
Can I use your bathroom?

188
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:47,939
Smashing.

189
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,150
Phew!

190
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,920
Hoo-ah!

191
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,028
Oh, Jesus!

192
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,378
Whoo!

193
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,854
Well, did everything
come out all right?

194
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,123
Oh, yeah. Great.

195
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,858
Thank you.

196
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,526
You're welcome,
there's your tea.

197
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,261
All right. Thank you.

198
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,197
You know, my second wife...

199
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,966
I presume my last...

200
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,870
Used to say,
bless her heart.

201
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:55,039
"Rather saint than sin,
Better out than in."

202
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,810
She was referring to gas,
of course! Her own, mind you.

203
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,981
That's great.

204
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,916
This... Thank you.

205
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:05,984
You bet.

206
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,423
God damn,
this is good.

207
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,429
So did you find
the water closet satisfactory?

208
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,098
Oh, yes. Thank you so much.

209
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,600
That was great!

210
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,570
I was holding it in
for half the ride.

211
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,072
It's a little embarrassing
but, um...

212
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,642
I was kinda spooked
to get out of the car
in the middle of nowhere.

213
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,011
...You know.

214
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,413
I must say

215
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,349
your phone call
intrigued me.

216
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:41,419
Well, I'm telling you,
your handbill intrigued me.

217
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,426
Did I understand you
correctly on the phone

218
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,261
when you said
you weren't looking for
a living arrangement?

219
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,362
Mmm-mmm.

220
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,298
No, I live in Los Angeles.

221
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,833
- Oh?
- Yeah.

222
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,168
City of Angels.

223
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,537
Well, I've never seen
any myself.

224
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,673
More the opposite, really.

225
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,008
My grandma, Mimsy,
used to tell us,

226
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,245
"You needn't go very far to
find hell in a hand basket."

227
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,883
I like that. I like Mimsy.

228
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:14,118
Oh, my grandma...
My grandma used to say...

229
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,288
She'd say,
"Hell is your children."

230
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,824
Chain smoker,
"Hell is your children."
She was the worst.

231
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,326
How droll.

232
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,494
She must've been
an interesting woman.

233
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,029
Oh, now, she was flatulent.

234
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,332
Oh, let me tell you,
it was cra...

235
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:30,068
I've never seen
anything like it or
smelled anything like it.

236
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,637
She would hang stuff on
her walls, too. Just like you.

237
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,840
My life lines these walls,
Mr. Bryton.

238
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,877
And though I cannot
boast of legs,

239
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,912
that are functioning...

240
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,147
That keep me ambulatory.

241
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,351
I still thank the Lord for
leaving me with a memory,

242
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:50,054
a living memory of
my many adventures.

243
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,824
Yeah, those adventures are
what I'm here about, Mr. Howe.

244
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:55,226
You said that on the phone
that you were much more

245
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,228
interested in me personally
than you were the room.

246
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,732
Yes, because I saw this.

247
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,267
- Oh!
- Yeah.

248
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,602
And you have no idea, I'm up
here in this frozen shithole.

249
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,704
I think my trip is a bust.

250
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,707
And I feel like I just
stumbled into a goldmine,
with this thing.

251
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,176
And you talk about
sharing stories.
That's what I do.

252
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,945
I'm a storyteller by trade.

253
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,247
Oh, I see. You're a...
You're a writer?

254
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,082
Well, mmm-mmm.

255
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,751
I'm a podcaster.

256
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,219
What on earth is that?

257
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,187
Oh...

258
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,723
I'm sorry.
I'm not laughing at you.
You just...

259
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,026
You just reminded me
of my mom.

260
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,560
"Wally, what're you doing?"

261
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,763
Ugh, she's the worst.
You're fantastic.

262
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,865
Um, a podcast
is kinda like a...

263
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,567
It's like a radio show
that's not on the radio.

264
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,202
It's on...
It's on the Internet.

265
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,604
Does that make sense?

266
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,705
Uh-huh.

267
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,274
Yeah.
That's also like my mom.

268
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,976
It makes this sound
more confusing, doesn't it?

269
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,145
Uh, it sounds like this.

270
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,480
- Listen...
Now you listen to me.

271
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,282
I just came in my pants.

272
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,553
That's my McConaughey,
prematurely ejaculating.

273
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,664
I pissed my pants.

274
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:10,568
So you can actually
say those things
without any repercussion?

275
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,837
Yeah, the audience likes it,
real and raunchy.

276
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,238
So I try to keep it
real and raunchy.

277
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
And real raunchy.

278
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,278
You know the freedoms
your generation enjoys...

279
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,613
- Hmm.
- Oh, I tell you...

280
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,849
Libertines the lot of you.

281
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,585
Can I just tell you something?

282
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:28,786
This is gonna sound
really weird but...

283
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,421
I've never had tea like this.

284
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,789
It's blowing my mind.

285
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,591
I feel like I've never
had tea in my life.

286
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,693
Um, I'm like popping
my cherry.

287
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,796
I'm not even a tea person.

288
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,199
I believe we're all
tea people.

289
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,600
There's a trick to it.

290
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:46,270
You see,
you soak the leaves in
brandy before steeping.

291
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,705
Of course.

292
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,775
You can't lose with booze.

293
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,111
"Well, always do sober
what you'd do drunk.

294
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,346
"It will teach you to keep
your mouth shut."

295
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,815
Okay, okay.
Now, this one, I know. Uh...

296
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,283
Hemingway said that.

297
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,019
Yes, he did.

298
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,354
He said it to me.

299
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,125
You knew Ernest Hemingway?

300
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,260
Well, we met on
the waters of Normandy.

301
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,997
You were there for D-Day?

302
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,699
No, I was there before D-Day.

303
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,235
I was there when it was
called Operation Neptune.

304
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,170
Holy... Hold on.

305
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,838
You were on the beach?

306
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,707
No, no. I was on a boat
as was Ernie.

307
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,342
Ernie?

308
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,245
Ernie was deemed
"precious cargo"
by the powers that be,

309
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,248
so he was prohibited
from joining the incursion.

310
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,650
They ordered Hemingway
to stay on the boat?
Are you kidding?

311
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,385
Yes, they did.

312
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,055
Which vexed Mr. Hemingway,
to say the least.

313
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,090
You know how he loved
to hunt the big game.

314
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,392
Yeah.

315
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,396
Big and the deadly.
Well, there was nothing bigger
or deadlier than a Nazi.

316
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,566
Except perhaps a Nazi's
nagging wife.

317
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,737
Nazi bitches. Of course.

318
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:57,942
And so,
prohibited from joining
the incursion,

319
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:01,746
Hemingway went to the galley
in search of alcohol.

320
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,881
And the only one to oblige
him, of course,

321
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:07,185
was a 16-year-old potato
peeler on KP duty.

322
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,888
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

323
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,691
<i>Holy shit, no kidding.</i>

324
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:18,429
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>so I proffered for Hemingway</i>
<i>a bottle of Wiser.</i>

325
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,632
<i>And I'll never forget
what he did next.</i>

326
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,369
There was a smile crawled
across the man's face.

327
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,806
It was so slow as if it
were a caterpillar.

328
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:32,076
<i>Then he turned to me and</i>
<i>slapped me on the back</i>
<i>and he said,</i>

329
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:36,581
"You are a kitchen witch
of only good fortune."

330
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,282
Kitchen witch?

331
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,619
God.

332
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:47,125
So we drank Wiser and
when the reports
came back of how many...

333
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,163
boys had
fallen at Omaha.

334
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,631
That's when he said to me,

335
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,235
"Only do sober what
you'd do drunk.

336
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,537
"It will teach you to keep
your mouth shut."

337
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,410
Oh, God, that's...
That's nuts, man!

338
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,746
It's incredible.

339
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,115
Well, actually, if you look
to the right of the fireplace,

340
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,037
you'll see
the incredible aspect.

341
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,724
This is the bottle?

342
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,194
Holy shit!

343
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,030
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

344
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,665
Well, it's just an old bottle.

345
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,267
But if you combine it
with a story,

346
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,702
then it becomes,
if I may say so,

347
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,037
a powerful talisman,

348
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,673
a doorway to another
time and place.

349
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,555
Perhaps, a drawbridge
to history.

350
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,211
Yeah.

351
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,612
So fucking cool.

352
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,883
What's this?

353
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,490
Ah!

354
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:56,494
I see, you have an eye
for the unfamiliar and
the curiosity of a cat.

355
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,163
That should take you very far.

356
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,666
That is the baculum
of a walrus.

357
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,468
The Alaskans call it an<i> oosik.</i>

358
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,971
Oosik.

359
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:10,408
Oh! So it's like a...
Like a walrus spine?

360
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,330
No. It's more like
a walrus cock.

361
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,580
Shut up!

362
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,481
I am a dirty boy, aren't I?

363
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:18,983
This is a walrus dick?

364
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,719
No, no. That's the baculum.

365
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,755
That's the bones found
in the penis of most
placental mammals

366
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,591
excluding man, of course.

367
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:27,858
Ah, that's not fair.

368
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,227
You know,

369
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:33,264
it is in aid of
sexual intercourse.

370
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:36,567
It maintains the stiffness
of the animal
during coital penetration.

371
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,236
Hey, if you got something
like this between your legs,

372
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,037
you don't need any help
with coital penetration.

373
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,707
Jesus Christ!

374
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,509
You are a rapscallion of the
highest order, Mr. Bryton.

375
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,178
- Can I get my hands on it?
- Yes, of course.

376
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,913
Wow!

377
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:53,284
No, what?
This is crazy.

378
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,286
You'd be right to admire
the walrus.

379
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,756
It is probably God's
most noble creature

380
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,592
far more evolved than
any man I've ever known.

381
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,529
Present company included.

382
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:06,931
Thank you.

383
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,766
You're welcome.

384
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,568
I appreciate that.

385
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,237
So where did you buy something
like this? A head shop?

386
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,542
Well, I became acquainted
with a walrus

387
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,411
when I was lost at sea.

388
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,114
Shut the front door!
You were lost at sea?

389
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,482
Yes.

390
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,651
Who are you,
Rudyard fucking Kipling?

391
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,620
In 1959,

392
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,889
I was back on a boat.

393
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,624
Around the Gulf of Anadyr

394
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,459
which is the southern coast
of Siberia.

395
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,762
In Chukchi Peninsula.

396
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:40,264
Perhaps, the best years
of my life.

397
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:43,434
My culinary capabilities
in small, sea-faring vessels

398
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,169
earned me my passport
to the world.

399
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:47,271
As a matter of fact,

400
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:50,107
it was my magic with
a halibut that landed me
the chef's position

401
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:52,076
on the<i> Anastasia</i>

402
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:55,513
as we traversed into
Soviet waters exploring.

403
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:58,516
Wait. So this is like...
What is this, like,
Cold War stuff?

404
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,184
No, no, no.

405
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:04,155
We were in search of
the Siberian Great White.

406
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,456
The Great White Shark?

407
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,291
No way.

408
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,027
Yes. And the Russians
called the hungry god

409
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,529
"The Whale Eater."

410
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,264
Oh!

411
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:15,299
It's reported to be
25 feet in length,

412
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,168
with some 3 tons on him.

413
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,869
What?

414
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,106
Holy shit! Did you find him?

415
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,975
No, no. No, no.
We only found...

416
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,845
Death off
the Chukchi Peninsula.

417
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,182
In the inky heart
of night,

418
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,784
the<i> Anastasia</i> collided
with an iceberg.

419
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,621
<i>I watched a ship disappear
in minutes</i>

420
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:40,624
<i>- into the black
Russian sea.</i>

421
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,360
<i>Then I heard the screams</i>

422
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:46,731
<i>of the crew silenced
in the Siberian brine.</i>

423
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,733
So what happened
after the boat sank?

424
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:50,968
I was alone.

425
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,742
"Alone, alone, all alone,
on a white wide sea!

426
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:02,246
"And never a saint took pity
on my soul in agony."

427
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,168
<i>The Rime of the
Ancient Mariner.</i>

428
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,417
Well remembered, Mr. Bryton.

429
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,686
- Hmm.
- Well remembered.

430
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,221
But you know,
when the screaming stopped,

431
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,857
I thought I was alone
until something

432
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:16,494
very swift and frightening
moved by me.

433
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:22,066
"The many men, so beautiful!

434
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,502
"And they all dead did lie

435
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:27,772
"And a thousand,
thousand slimy things
lived on

436
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,073
"And so did I."

437
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,943
God! How scared were you?

438
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,746
Oh!

439
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,749
I don't mind admitting
I was terrified.

440
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,186
I know you've probably
been scared a few times
in your life, Mr. Bryton.

441
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:46,557
But I'd wager to say
you've never known
true terror.

442
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,362
I became intimately familiar
with terror that night,
as I swam.

443
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:53,697
I kicked at the water
and stroked for

444
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,739
I know not where.
It was so pitch black.

445
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,371
So I swam deeper and deeper
into the ebony void

446
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:02,973
and I prayed that
whatever brushed by me

447
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:06,977
was now feasting upon
the expedition crew instead.

448
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,647
Sweet whistling Christ!

449
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,885
I awoke on the shores
of a very small island,

450
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,654
<i>regurgitating sea water,</i>

451
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:19,990
<i>and discombobulated
beyond belief.</i>

452
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:23,794
<i>And then as I
stood to my feet,</i>

453
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,664
<i>I saw the sweetest sight
my orbs have ever taken in.</i>

454
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,632
<i>I saw my savior.</i>

455
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,635
I saw a walrus.

456
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,171
A walrus?

457
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,940
A walrus saved your life?

458
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:38,342
- Yes.
- - What?

459
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,678
This curious fellow
loomed over me,

460
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,448
with tusks as tall as
Scylla and Charibdys.

461
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,183
But it was...

462
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,085
It was as gentle as
a milking cow

463
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,588
and it took me into its
blubbery body to keep me warm,

464
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,691
as if I were a newborn chick,
you see.

465
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,659
Unbelievable!

466
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,528
Yes.

467
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,030
And though I couldn't know
what he was called

468
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,666
by his marine brethren,

469
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:06,270
I named him after
the only authority
figure I'd ever known,

470
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,706
I ever trusted
in my entire life.

471
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:12,843
The janitor at a boys' home
I had attended

472
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,212
whose name was
Mr. Tuskegee.

473
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:18,182
So I called my companion,
Mr. Tusk.

474
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,652
Mr. Tusk? That's cute.

475
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:22,686
Cute.

476
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,289
Well,

477
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:28,792
cute is for Chinese babies,
Mr. Bryton.

478
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:32,229
But my walrus companion
was beautiful.

479
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:35,699
I have never known such
a fulfilling friendship

480
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,602
with anyone, human
or otherwise.

481
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,339
And for six glorious months,

482
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,508
I was at utter peace

483
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,211
and I knew the only bliss

484
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,314
this wretched life has
ever afforded me.

485
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,118
What did you...

486
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,954
What'd you...

487
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,157
What'd you...

488
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,964
There, there.

489
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,233
It'll be all right.

490
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,837
It'll be all right, Mr. Tusk.

491
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,245
Oh, shit!

492
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,481
Oh, fuck!

493
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,117
Oh, shit!

494
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,252
Ha!

495
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,687
Why... Why're you stopping?

496
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,422
I don't want you to go
to Canada tomorrow.

497
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,557
Okay, I won't go to Canada!
Just finish...

498
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,759
Oh, you're so full of shit,
your eyes are brown.

499
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,127
I know. I know,
I'm full of shit.

500
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:38,862
I'm bad. So spank me.
Spank me right there...

501
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,264
- Nope. I'm not gonna do it.
- What?

502
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,398
All right.

503
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,300
Seriously? No, no.

504
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,369
- It's gonna get on you, then.
- No! No!

505
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:46,537
You don't even deserve
a selfie.

506
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:48,706
Why not? Come on.
We talked about this.

507
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,040
I'm gonna take a quick
Cana-deuce tomorrow.

508
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,408
I'll be back in the morning.

509
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,978
Hmm?

510
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,146
Making fun of this kid on
the podcast is one thing,

511
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,215
but to go over there
to his house...

512
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,484
It's... It's horrible, okay?

513
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:01,619
This just feels gamey.

514
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:02,987
Gamey?

515
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:05,155
Ally, the kid reached
out to me! Okay?

516
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,791
He turned down Oprah fucking
Winfrey to talk to me.

517
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:08,926
Me!

518
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,261
Come on, this is huge
for the show.

519
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,163
I don't wanna do it.
I don't wanna make of him.

520
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,966
But, it's for the show.
It's for the podcast.

521
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,801
You know you're a real
fucking asshole.

522
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,404
And this, this does not
work for you at all.

523
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:25,175
Doing your dopey comedy
sketches is bad enough.

524
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,745
...But to exploit him
to his face...

525
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:30,080
It's vicious.

526
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,448
- The Wallace I fell in...
- No, that's vicious.

527
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,617
To do what you did,
that's vicious.

528
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,419
That's mean,
that's exploitative.

529
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:37,354
To take a little taste
and walk away.

530
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,956
- Are you serious?
- Mmm-hmm.

531
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:41,659
The Wallace I fell in love
with would not do that.

532
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:43,994
The Wallace I fell in love
with would never say
this stupid-ass shit.

533
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,864
The Wallace you fell in love
with was an un-funny
little dick-hole

534
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,365
who used to make
bad<i> Star Wars</i> puns

535
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,300
and couldn't pay his bills.

536
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:53,203
I... I'm sorry
but I kinda prefer
the new Wallace.

537
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,674
New Wallace made 100 grand
in ads alone last year.

538
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,709
That's before the T-shirt
sales and all the live shows.

539
00:27:58,711 --> 00:27:59,777
So...

540
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,349
AMC is coming to see
the new Wallace's
showcase next week.

541
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,684
Why do you think that is?

542
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,318
'Cause of agents?

543
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,187
'Cause he played the clubs
every fucking night

544
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,789
like ol' unfunny Wallace
used to?

545
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,158
No. It's 'cause he's a
juggernaut of a podcast,

546
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,893
hosted by new Wallace.

547
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,461
Old Wallace!

548
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,797
Old Wallace was
a fucking loser

549
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,131
who never popped
a piss in our window

550
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:22,433
to throw it out.

551
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,403
Old Wallace had me.

552
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,241
Oh!

553
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,216
- He'd like to have you again.
- So take me with you.

554
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,218
If I bring you, you know this.

555
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,687
Teddy gets weird and jealous
and then the show sucks.

556
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,723
You know, he's got this thing.
Like if you're around,

557
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,991
I'm not as funny as
I usually am

558
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:49,493
'cause you're a distraction.
Blah, blah, blah.
I don't know.

559
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,061
I can't figure out what's
going on in that kid's head.

560
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,329
All I know is that
if it were up to me,

561
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,064
of course, I would bring you.

562
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,166
Old Wallace wouldn't give
a shit, he'd just take me.

563
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:57,401
He'd just take me anyway.

564
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,169
Ah, well!

565
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:03,173
Old Wallace also
used to wear a fucking
stethoscope on stage.

566
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,709
Oh, speaking of...

567
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,412
We saw my first stand-up
set on the show today.

568
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,180
Whoo! It was fucking brutal.

569
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,082
It was even worse than
I remembered.

570
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,685
It's really embarrassing,
actually.

571
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:17,454
Teddy was dying.
Little shit.

572
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:21,792
News flash. Cringe humor
attack shit is lame.

573
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:24,561
Sorry, I didn't hear
what you're saying.
I just love that accent.

574
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:28,065
It's lame,
this cringe humor...

575
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:30,067
- Love your accent.
- I don't talk like that!

576
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,435
I don't talk like that!

577
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,804
...Listen, 'stache!

578
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:36,607
That's the worst Latino accent
I have ever heard in my life.

579
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,408
That's the worst
Latino accent
I've ever heard...

580
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,778
Can you... Can you
just turn down
the funny right now, stache.

581
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,146
The podcast's not on.

582
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:44,047
- I know.
- It's just me and you.

583
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,816
I'm trying to be lovey-dovey.
You're fucking it up.

584
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:48,218
Fuck, it's... Because I have

585
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,621
a raging hard-on!

586
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,157
I wanna be lovey-dovey too.
I love lovey-dovey.

587
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,092
But we can be lovey-dovey on
the phone when I'm in Canada.

588
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,927
You know what we can't do
on the phone? Fuck.

589
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:58,962
Why don't we that right now?
Come on.

590
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,465
See? Come on.

591
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,300
New Wallace is kinda funny.

592
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,903
Yeah, he can be kinda funny.

593
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:08,739
I just... I miss old Wallace.

594
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:11,341
I miss you.
I miss the real you.
Is he in there?

595
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:14,278
- Ugh!
- You know, that geeky kid.

596
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,746
- Who even thanked me on stage.
- Geeky?

597
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:18,348
Yeah, geeky.

598
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,685
I miss the guy who told me,
he loved me
the first time we had sex.

599
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:24,727
The guy who gets baked and
cries watching
<i>Winnie the Pooh.</i>

600
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,425
You're so sweet.
Such a softy.

601
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,061
Nothing soft about me now.

602
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,498
Yeah, I know and it sucks.

603
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,967
- Relax.
- Okay.

604
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,006
What?

605
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:51,541
Well...

606
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,144
Look who's back.

607
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,488
I must say you scared
the bejesus out of me.

608
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,091
Oh, what kind of nurse am I?

609
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,262
Here you go, here's your cup.

610
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,269
Wet your whistle,
my dry little thistle.

611
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,575
What...

612
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,877
Wha...

613
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:28,599
- What happened?
- Mmm-hmm.

614
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,280
Oh, my dear boy.

615
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,282
Well, you passed out
right in front of me.

616
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,784
Yeah.

617
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,919
So tired.

618
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,622
I mean, one moment,
I'm waxing lyrically

619
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,991
about my many ocean voyages,
and the next thing I know,

620
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,393
you fell out of your chair
and collapsed.

621
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,495
I didn't know what it was
until I looked down,

622
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:48,065
and I saw this rather
intimidating spider

623
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,566
crawling down your pant leg.

624
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,169
Spider?

625
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,639
Yes, a brown recluse.

626
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,075
A rather toxic little insect.
These woods are full of them.

627
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,945
Yeah, some of them
are poisonous.

628
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,080
Hmm.

629
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,351
Oh, shit! A spider bit me?

630
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,454
Yes, well, I'm so sorry.

631
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,756
Where's my phone?

632
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,257
- Phone?
- Mmm-hmm.

633
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,793
I got to make a call.

634
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:20,464
Well, I'm afraid
the doctor stepped on it
and broke it.

635
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,032
I'm afraid it lies in pieces.

636
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,136
Mmm. There was a doctor here?

637
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:28,805
Yes, Doctor Moseeay.

638
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:31,508
He lives just up the road
around 8 miles.

639
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,343
- Moseeay?
- Yeah.

640
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,778
- Kind of
a funny name.
-Yeah.

641
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,514
He was here within
a half an hour of your...

642
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,849
Incident.

643
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,285
I forget your name.

644
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,855
My name?
Howard Howe.

645
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:48,892
Mmm, Howard, I can't
feel my legs.

646
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:51,294
Well, that would be the spinal
injection you see. They...

647
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,332
The Recluse sank her
fangs into you

648
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:57,494
and filled you with
so much poison that your...

649
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,304
Your ankle was the size
of an elephant's leg.

650
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,573
Oh, shit.

651
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,142
What kind of an elephant?

652
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:06,710
A very fat one.

653
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:07,712
Mmm-hmm.

654
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,314
- Shit!
- Yeah.

655
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:15,018
So, with the venom traveling
to your heart

656
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,587
it forced the doctor,
to save your life,

657
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,791
to take, as we say...
Drastic measures.

658
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,168
Oh, my God!

659
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,271
Oh, my God.

660
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:35,672
Holy shit!

661
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,908
There's no leg there.

662
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,744
Doesn't appear to be.

663
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,412
Just let it out, dear boy.
Let it all out.

664
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,481
My leg is off.

665
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,783
Oh, my God.

666
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:49,219
Nature can be very red in
tooth and claw.

667
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,554
What?

668
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,355
Tennyson.

669
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,758
What the fuck are
you talking about?

670
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,861
Why am I still here?
Why aren't I in the hospital?

671
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:59,763
Well, hospitals...

672
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,865
Carry diseases.

673
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,868
So, Dr. Moseeay thought it
would be best if you...

674
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,939
Well, just stay here since
the room is sanitized
all day.

675
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,740
It would be best
if you recuperate here.

676
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:12,809
It doesn't make any sense.

677
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,479
Spider. The spider bit you.

678
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,247
All right,
I wanna walk to this guy.

679
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,082
Where's the doctor?
I wanna talk to him.

680
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:24,488
Well, uh... The doctor's
making his rounds.

681
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,124
Rounds? What rounds?
We're in the middle
of nowhere!

682
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,392
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

683
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:30,460
No, we're not.

684
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,729
No, we're not, Mr. Bryton.

685
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:36,466
I've been to the
middle of nowhere.
And it is a ghastly place.

686
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,802
I don't want to hear your
fucking stories.

687
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,837
What the fuck is this?

688
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:43,974
...Why are you laughing?

689
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:46,243
You're funny.

690
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:48,078
Well, that's a belt
to keep you from falling
out of your chair, you see.

691
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,813
Why?

692
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:53,150
The belt is to keep you
from falling over until
the spinal wears off...

693
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:56,286
Spinal wears off and you get
full control of your
faculties again.

694
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,855
That is, most of
your faculties.

695
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:04,327
I... I need a phone.
I gotta call my family.

696
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,796
Doctor Moseeay removed
all the phones from the house.

697
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,298
He didn't want you disturbed.

698
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,366
What the fuck?

699
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:11,668
So, I'll talk to him

700
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,704
and I can ask him if you can
call home after supper.

701
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,473
I gotta call.

702
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:17,774
So it would be best
if you take a nap.

703
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:19,643
You're heavily,
heavily tranquilized.

704
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:22,379
I got to tell my family.

705
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:25,282
I gotta use a phone...
I gotta talk to a doctor.

706
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:27,717
- Moseeay, Dr. Moseeay.
- I wanna talk to him.

707
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,120
Well, you can't.
You see, he is on his rounds.

708
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,956
You give me a phone.

709
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,458
Don't have a phone.

710
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,061
The doctor removed them all.

711
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,864
That's... Insane.

712
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,799
Possibly so, but it's true.

713
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:51,041
We sup at 6:00 sharp.

714
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,277
Wait, wait.

715
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,913
Wait, wait, wait.

716
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,616
All right, wait.

717
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,757
I am...

718
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,263
...truly sorry for your loss.

719
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,451
You're not eating?

720
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,797
I can't move my arms.

721
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,333
Well...

722
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,530
That would be the morphine.

723
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:03,113
It is capital
for the leg pain,

724
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:07,917
and perhaps the only thing
keeps you from
howling in agony.

725
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,520
But it does tend to
leave one a bit sleepy.

726
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,293
I'm not sleepy.

727
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,995
At all.

728
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,997
- I'm immobilized.
- Hmm.

729
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,900
Well...

730
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,036
You know...

731
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,039
I was thinking...

732
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,908
The melancholy

733
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,577
of losing a limb

734
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,180
must be akin to

735
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,416
mourning a close friend
that you

736
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,351
too often took for granted.

737
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,587
Hmm...

738
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,378
There was no spider,
was there?

739
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,970
Yes, there was.
A brown recluse.

740
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,342
Colloquially called
the hobo spider.

741
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,676
Ah, that's interesting.

742
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,213
And you saw it?

743
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,083
Yeah.

744
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,453
You saw the spider?

745
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,058
I... I just wish that I had
spied the little creature

746
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,761
before it so
viciously attacked you.

747
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:29,773
What'd it look like?

748
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,871
The Arachnid Assailant?

749
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,806
- Yeah.
- Well...

750
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,044
A typical spider...

751
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:44,247
A legion of legs, you know,
etc, etc. It was
very small though.

752
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:50,553
So small you might even
call it Itsy Bitsy.

753
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:55,325
<i>¶ The Itsy, Bitsy Spider
went up the water spout</i>

754
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:56,926
Holy shit...

755
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:01,364
<i>¶ Down came the rain
and washed the spider out</i>

756
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:04,367
Let me out of this chair,
you fucking psycho!

757
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:08,304
Let me out! Let me out,
you old fucking nutbag!

758
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,480
Help! Somebody help!

759
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:42,739
Now, shall we dispense with
the chuffa, Mr. Bryton?

760
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:47,310
Perhaps it would be best,
in this, our
burgeoning relationship,

761
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:50,814
to reveal our hearts
with absolute candor.

762
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:56,119
See, for some time now

763
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,023
I've been constructing

764
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,327
a very realistic walrus suit.

765
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,565
What?

766
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:13,503
And I believe with just a few
minor modifications
it will fit you perfectly.

767
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:17,674
Jesus. What the fuck, man?

768
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:19,275
But,

769
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:24,414
whilst in the walrus suit
you must be a walrus.

770
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,816
There will be no sound
of a human voice.

771
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,952
You must communicate

772
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:30,086
everything you do

773
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,321
as a walrus.

774
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,122
Do you understand?

775
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,659
Please... Please...

776
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,261
No, no, no.

777
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:41,998
Be not vexed or
heavy of heart, Mr. Bryton.

778
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,471
We two are embarking on
an expedition not unlike that
of the doomed<i> Anastasia.</i>

779
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:51,975
Their mistake was
they look for the monsters
out there.

780
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:53,476
They shouldn't
have left the dock.

781
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:56,112
The beast has always
lied within.

782
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,218
Why?

783
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,621
Why are you doing this?

784
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:06,623
Why?

785
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:07,924
Why?

786
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:13,530
To solve a riddle older
than the Sphinx.

787
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:16,399
To answer the question
which has plagued us

788
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:19,002
since we first crawled
from this Earth

789
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:21,437
and stood erect in the sun.

790
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:27,844
Is man, indeed,

791
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:30,246
a walrus at heart?

792
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,289
Help!

793
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,081
I almost told him,
before he left.

794
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,285
Sometimes I forget,

795
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,456
that my life is...

796
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:19,495
An intricate, delicate
web of lies.

797
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,967
And I feel so normal...

798
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,302
So banal.

799
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,874
It feels so amazing
to be boring.

800
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,211
And faithful.

801
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:36,512
And sinless.

802
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,418
I even forget what
we're doing to him.

803
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,124
Till I remember what he
does to me...

804
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,829
With all those empty women.

805
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,934
And it... Crushes me.

806
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,471
And I hate him.

807
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,075
I hate him.

808
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:08,711
But I hate myself so much more

809
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,367
for letting any man
do this to me.

810
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,988
I'm happy my dad's not
alive to see this.

811
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,293
To see his only little girl

812
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:29,265
put her life on hold for some
cheating fucking asshole.

813
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,509
And I just
wanna fucking die.

814
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:46,149
But every time
he destroys me, you...

815
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:48,184
You bring me back.

816
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,189
You make me feel
beautiful again.

817
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,726
Cherished...

818
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,130
You give me my humanity.

819
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:07,904
Even though we're stripping
it down every time we're doing
this, I...

820
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:09,205
Honestly...

821
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,307
I don't know
how to live without you.

822
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,545
So look out,
you crazy Canucks.

823
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,914
Something weird-ass
this way comes!

824
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:20,249
Next week,
Wanderin' Wallace takes
a raunchy road trip

825
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:23,052
up to the Great White North
to meet with a star.

826
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,188
I will be staying at home.
Per usual.

827
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,156
Doing what, Teddy?
Why don't you film it?

828
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:29,092
Let's have a real
laugh after that tape.

829
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:32,729
I... I will be taking your
significant other
to the Getty

830
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:36,165
because in her words,
"You don't get art."

831
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,101
I get art too.
Why do you keep
saying that? I get art.

832
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:40,236
I get it when it's got my
face on it.

833
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,071
It's all over the wall.
Look at it. Look at all this.
This is art.

834
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,406
Do you think this is art?

835
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,607
It's like a me-seum.

836
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:47,343
It's not wrong... All over
the walls of this, uh...

837
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:48,745
Studio.

838
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:52,448
We sort of created a
man cave/masturbation chamber,

839
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,851
uh, to while away
the hours in.

840
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:57,353
I got to say, I've never
jerked off in here,
which is surprising,

841
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,187
'cause I jerk off
all the time.

842
00:45:58,189 --> 00:45:59,922
I don't believe you.

843
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,124
Okay, you're right
to not to believe me.

844
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:02,525
Teddy, you are
my fucking hero.

845
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:03,860
You're taking my girlfriend
to the Getty.

846
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,595
Ally and Teddy go to the Getty.

847
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:06,863
-Aw.
-It's adorable.
It's like a children's book.

848
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:09,232
Yeah. Until next time,
I'm Teddy Craft.

849
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:11,601
And this is Wallace Bryton
reminding you to...

850
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:14,103
Join ze Not-See Party!

851
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,874
Clear! Nice!

852
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:19,876
That was amazing!

853
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:21,110
I don't know where
you were going with
that video

854
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,078
but I'm glad you did it.
It was embarrassing,

855
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,579
but shit,
that was fucking funny.

856
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,882
All fucking hail
the Not-See Party!

857
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:27,617
Yeah, everyone except Ally.

858
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,752
Ah... Dude, she just wants
to go with you.

859
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:31,254
I know. I know!

860
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:33,322
Teddy, why are you always
defending her? It's so weird.

861
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:35,892
And I know she wants to come.
But you know, her whole thing
is like,

862
00:46:35,894 --> 00:46:38,294
"Wally, why do you have to do
such mean comedy?"

863
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:39,896
That doesn't even
sound like her.

864
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,898
I can't have her around if I'm
gonna get real with this kid.

865
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,833
And I got to get
real with him.
This is way too important.

866
00:46:43,835 --> 00:46:46,169
I can't be me if she is there.

867
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,838
I also can't get road-head
if she's there either.

868
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,340
You're a fucking numbskull to
cheat on someone that hot.

869
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:54,343
Teddy, it has nothing to do
with how hot she is.
I know she's hot.

870
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:56,946
But there's some top shelf
ass out there
who listen to us.

871
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,681
I'm not kidding.

872
00:46:58,683 --> 00:46:59,982
Plus you haven't seen
these other girls.

873
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,418
I mean don't short change
them, okay?

874
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,821
These fan girls, they may be
pasty and a little chunky,
but they're...

875
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:07,323
-They're really sexual.
-You bring shame
to the Not-See Party.

876
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,858
I know Ally's hot.

877
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,626
It doesn't take away
from how hot she is.

878
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:12,628
I'm not married to her.
I know I sound shitty
right now.

879
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,030
I can see you judging me.

880
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:15,364
You going to Ally's now?

881
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:17,133
Fuck, yeah, I'm going
over there now.

882
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:18,701
I wanna try to break one off
before I fly tomorrow.

883
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:21,170
So I can get all
quiet and peaceful
in the plane,

884
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,372
and I don't cause any
disturbances at the airport.

885
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:25,308
- It... It's like my Xanax.
- Mmm.

886
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,430
I got to get the white out
and I go to bed,
like a little baby.

887
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,884
Fuck.

888
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,350
He hasn't called me
in three days.

889
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,605
I have this pain in my
stomach. I...

890
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:32,508
I'm worried.

891
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,915
Ally. Ally,
you got to help me.

892
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,350
I swear to God I'm not joking,
okay?

893
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,888
I was abducted.
I'm in Manitoba.

894
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,258
This guy wants to turn me
into an animal or something!

895
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,693
He's fucking nuts!

896
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:53,195
You gotta please come!
Please! Please! Please!

897
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,233
I don't know where he is.

898
00:48:57,235 --> 00:49:00,036
But I'm somewhere in his
weird fucking house.

899
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,273
I'm like two hours
from Winnipeg.

900
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,611
I'm so fucking scared.

901
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,893
I'm so scared I'm not gonna
see you again.

902
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,518
I'm sorry
I was such an asshole.

903
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,220
I'm so sorry.

904
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,726
He cut off my
fucking leg, Ally.

905
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:27,897
Okay? Please. Okay.
Okay, just get here, okay?

906
00:49:27,899 --> 00:49:30,733
Call the cops.

907
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:33,703
Ally...
Ally, I don't wanna
die in Canada.

908
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:36,906
I don't wanna die at all.

909
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,742
Oh, fuck.

910
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,378
Fuck.

911
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,317
Okay.

912
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,252
Oh, Teddy, pick up.

913
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:54,790
<i>I... honestly...</i>

914
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:57,193
<i>I don't know how to live
without you.</i>

915
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:03,065
So go brush your teeth and
come back to bed, because...

916
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,936
I don't want to sit here
crying all night.

917
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:30,126
Teddy, it's me! I swear to God
this is no fucking joke.

918
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:31,560
I'm being held captive.

919
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,164
I'm not kidding,
I'm being held captive

920
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:38,467
by some crazy motherfucker.
He cut off my fucking leg!

921
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,703
Listen to me,
you gotta call the cops.

922
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:44,006
I'm, like... I'm, like,
two hours north of Winnipeg.

923
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:48,644
I'm somewhere... I'm somewhere
in, like, bumfuck Manitoba.

924
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:52,815
This guy's name
is Howard Howe, okay?
It's Howard Howe.

925
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:55,184
You gotta call the cops.

926
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:57,253
Call the cops.

927
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:58,587
I don't know exactly
what happened.

928
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:00,189
I'm scared shitless, man.

929
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:02,658
I think he wants to turn me
into, like, a...

930
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,496
What the fuck was that?

931
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,667
Your life as you knew it
is over, Mr. Bryton.

932
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:14,236
So if you wish to
continue living,

933
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:18,641
you will be a walrus,
or you'll be nothing at all.

934
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,828
This'll fucking help.

935
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,930
<i>Ally. Ally,
you've got to help me.</i>

936
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:18,567
<i>I swear to God
I'm not joking, okay?</i>

937
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:21,470
<i>I was abducted.
I'm in Manitoba.</i>

938
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:24,607
<i>This guy wants to turn me into
an animal or something.</i>

939
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,376
Teddy.

940
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,111
Ted.

941
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:30,679
Hey.

942
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:33,816
Wake up.
Wallace. It's Wallace.

943
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:35,451
- What?
- He's in trouble.

944
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:36,752
He's in trouble.

945
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,854
What?

946
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,764
Oh, my God,
he called you too.

947
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:44,960
Oh, my God.

948
00:52:44,962 --> 00:52:46,362
Check it.

949
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:03,045
Well, someone's looking
for Wallace!

950
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,316
It must be nice to know
that somebody
cares about you that much.

951
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:10,953
Just what I felt on the island
with Mr. Tusk.

952
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:15,491
He was the only living thing
that ever had
my best interests at heart.

953
00:53:15,493 --> 00:53:18,727
As a child,
I was not cared for
so much as I was...

954
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:21,730
Filed away,
like a document.

955
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,333
A document fed into
a shredding machine

956
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:26,869
and fueled by the blood
of the innocent.

957
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:31,006
You see, I am a
Duplessis Orphan.

958
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:38,080
Now, Maurice Duplessis
was the Premier of Quebec
in those days.

959
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,516
He was the head
of the Conservative Party

960
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:43,519
and with strong ties
to the Catholic Church.

961
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:45,487
As a matter of fact,

962
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:48,991
it was in collusion with
these charlatans of the Lord

963
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:54,697
that Duplessis brought upon
Quebec<i> La Grande Noirceur...</i>

964
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,932
"The Great Darkness."

965
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,835
As a boy of 10,

966
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:02,671
my mother and father
took me to Montreal.

967
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:04,673
I had never seen anything
so beautiful and bright

968
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,609
and big and wonderful
in my life.

969
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:08,944
But...

970
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:12,248
When night falls
in Montreal,

971
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:16,585
the monsters come out to play.

972
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,421
We were walking to dinner,
and were accosted by
brigands in a back alley.

973
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:22,124
My father was stabbed
several times
with the mugger's knife.

974
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:26,895
And my mother's throat
was slashed,
as if she were cattle.

975
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:30,933
I was placed
in an abandoned boys' home
in Quebec.

976
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:33,736
Boys whose lives
had been destroyed.

977
00:54:33,738 --> 00:54:37,606
Provinces were responsible
financially for all
of the orphanages.

978
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:43,312
The government
was responsible for
the mental institutions.

979
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:49,618
So Duplessis and the Church,
they came up with a scheme
to obtain more money

980
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,757
by reclassifying
the orphanages as
mental health-care facilities.

981
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:57,559
And when nobody
raised their voice in protest,

982
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,561
why, they just shut down
the orphanages

983
00:54:59,563 --> 00:55:05,234
and sent all the children,
including me,
to insane asylums.

984
00:55:05,236 --> 00:55:08,304
And so for the next
five years,

985
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:09,905
I was beaten,

986
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:11,573
I was tortured,

987
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,576
I was raped.

988
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:19,148
I have had things in my mouth
that no human being
should ever taste.

989
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:22,084
They never thought
of me as a person.
They just thought to use me.

990
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:23,519
And use me they did.

991
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:29,625
Priests, politicians...

992
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:31,360
All pederasts.

993
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:36,332
Even the nurses
and nuns and night watchmen.

994
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:39,034
All of them witches,
all there to satisfy

995
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:42,971
their most base physical
and financial desires...

996
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:46,175
Through the rectum
and lips of a child.

997
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:50,946
So with no one to answer to
for their horrid crimes,

998
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,483
these devils ran amuck
with my innocence.

999
00:55:55,985 --> 00:56:02,224
But at age 15,
I escaped Canada.

1000
00:56:02,226 --> 00:56:08,030
I went to the United States,
got on a boat,
and never looked back.

1001
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,132
Until now.

1002
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,901
Yes...

1003
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:16,038
Man is a savage animal,
Mr. Bryton.

1004
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,880
Better to be a walrus.

1005
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:37,426
Yes, Officer,
it's B-R-Y-T-O-N...

1006
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:40,562
We know he rented a car,
but we don't know
exactly where from,

1007
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,364
so as soon as we land
in Winnipeg,

1008
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:44,666
we're just gonna go
to every rental desk
at the airport

1009
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:46,068
and see if anyone
recognizes him.

1010
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,336
Tell 'em if can't find
the agency,

1011
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:49,571
we can find the car
using its GPS system.

1012
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:53,175
Recent pictures? Yes,
there are some recent pictures
up on the website.

1013
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:55,077
- It's NotSeeParty.com...
- Spell it, spell it!

1014
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,613
Hello? Hello?

1015
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:58,947
They fucking hung up.

1016
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:39,221
"The sun was shining
on the sea

1017
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:41,790
"Shining with all his might

1018
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,625
"He did his very best to make

1020
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:52,134
"And this was odd,
because it was

1021
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,803
"The middle of the night."

1022
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:09,585
Oh, now, now, Mr. Tusk.
There, there, there,
I understand.

1023
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:12,621
- It's so very hard to be...

1024
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:15,090
...the elephant
of the deep blue sea.

1025
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:17,626
...Stop, stop. Stop it.

1026
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:21,563
Stop it. Walruses never cry!

1027
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,278
Oh, I've missed you,
Mr. Tusk.

1028
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:45,053
How I've missed
our merry times together
on Ponder Rock.

1029
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:58,133
<i>I've regretted</i>

<i>my return to this wretched...</i>

1030
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,502

<i>with all the banality

1033

<i>The worst of man</i>
<i>has long been fetid</i>
<i>with greed and indifference.</i>

1034
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:15,918

1038

<i>This writhing nest

1039
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:32,935

<i>Each devouring

1041

1047
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,392
<i>I don't know exactly

1048
00:59:57,394 --> 00:59:59,795
<i>I'm scared shitless, man.</i>

1049
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:03,398
<i>- I think he wants to turn me
into, like, a... Like, a...</i>

1050
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,635
- That's it?
- It just ends.

1051
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:08,637
Are you sure he is not
pulling your legs?

1052
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,206
Getting up to some good old
American monkeyshines?

1053
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:12,741
That doesn't sound like
monkeyshines.

1054
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,776
But you say you do
these comedy podcasts.

1055
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,111
Could this just be
for grins and giggles?

1056
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,846
We do...
We do a podcast.

1057
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:20,816
But he wouldn't take
something this far.
He's not that kind of guy.

1058
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:22,217
Okay, now stick with me here.

1059
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:24,119
I don't mean to be indelicate,

1060
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,722
but could there be some
sort of sexual angle?

1061
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:29,858
A romantic entanglement?
An affair or something?

1062
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:34,896
No. He's not that kind of guy.

1063
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,168
Okay.
Well, I did some checking,

1064
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:44,339
and we don't have
a Howard Howe
anywhere in Manitoba.

1065
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:45,641
Shit!

1066
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:48,076
With regard to your friend,
I asked Border Patrol

1067
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:50,312
if they got a report of him
leaving the country yet.

1068
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:53,081
They say he come
into Winnipeg, and that's it.

1069
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,950
Don't you two worry.

1070
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:56,918
I'm gonna issue
a Missing Persons on him,

1071
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,787
same as they do in the States.

1072
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:00,589
Thank you.

1073
01:01:00,591 --> 01:01:02,824
But I'll tell you,
that leg bit...

1074
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:06,995
It sure puts the BM
in the PM's coffee, eh?

1075
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,363
That is something.

1076
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:10,265
It's creepy, right?

1077
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:12,934
No, no, it's something.

1078
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:16,538
I had a fella come in here
from Quebec two days ago,

1079
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:19,808
asking about any
legless bodies that
might've turned up.

1080
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,510
Used to be a cop.

1081
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:25,380
Said he is hunting
some kinda serial killer.

1082
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:27,783
I told him, "Canada doesn't
have any serial killers.

1083
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:30,285
"Unless you count the pothead

1084
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:33,455
"who took out all
the Cap'n Crunch last night
at the Eh-2-Zed."

1085
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:35,290
Anyway...

1086
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:38,894
He gave me his number
and he left it.

1087
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:40,696
I'll take it.

1088
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,043
Ahoy, matey!

1089
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:06,421
You know, it occurs to me...

1090
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:11,526
...that if you are to fulfill
your destiny...

1091
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:14,262
If you are to be
a true walrus...

1092
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:18,133
Well, Mr. Tusk...

1093
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:22,771
A walrus must learn to swim.

1094
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:39,688
Whoa, good!

1095
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:44,359
Now, that's it.
Show me how the fishies swim.

1096
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:47,529
Swim. Now, come on.

1097
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,033
Come on, damn you. Swim!

1098
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:08,216
Yes, come on. Swim!

1099
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:46,621
I am Guy Lapointe.
That is my name.

1100
01:03:46,623 --> 01:03:47,856
Guy Lapointe.

1101
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:50,859
And I spend 20 years
as the inspector

1102
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:53,628
of the Surete du Quebec.

1103
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:56,798
And but for the last
10 years of my life,

1104
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,334
I have been hunting an animal

1105
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:03,338
who is doing the masquerade
as the man.

1106
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,842
I have been hunting
this Howard Howe.

1107
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:09,511
Howard Howe,

1108
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:14,115
this elusive, uh...
Devil made of the flesh,

1109
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:18,053
this serial killer
who makes the bringing

1110
01:04:18,055 --> 01:04:22,190
of the blood and terror
to the true north.

1111
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,525
I...

1112
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,394
Am very dedicated man

1113
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:29,965
and I have sacrificed
my life...

1114
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:32,868
Too many marriages,
any chance at happiness,

1115
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:37,372
and very likely,
some may say, my, uh...

1116
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,907
sanity.

1117
01:04:38,909 --> 01:04:43,178
All in the pursuit of
this butcher of the men.

1118
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,680
And because of this...

1119
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:53,555
The solace of the sleep
most of the time eludes me.

1120
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:57,158
But last night,
after you call me,

1121
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,495
I sleep like
the breast-fed baby.

1122
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:04,432
And I wake up this morning,
in the morning,

1123
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:10,372
and I know that, in my bones,
my quarry is close.

1124
01:05:10,374 --> 01:05:12,507
And he is so close

1125
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:16,244
that I can almost
smell his shit.

1126
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,579
Pardon my French.

1127
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,750
Who has
the Blue Skies with fries?

1128
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:24,185
- Oh, that would be me.
- There you go.

1129
01:05:24,187 --> 01:05:26,288
How about
the Gimli Slider, no onions?

1130
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,956
That would also be me.

1131
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:29,958
And a Mon-Sewer
Maurice Milkshake.

1132
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,793
That would also be me.

1133
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:34,562
Okay, here are some napkins.
You're gonna need those.

1134
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:35,964
All right. Have a nice flight.

1135
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,098
Thank you so much.

1136
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,536
Now, I'll tell you something.

1137
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,574
They don't have these
back home, you know.

1138
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:49,444
You throw a rock
in Quebec City,

1139
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,446
and it'll land in
a Chez Ashton. But...

1140
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:56,418
Not a single goddamn
Gimli Slider.

1141
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,253
And that, in my opinion,

1142
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:02,424
is the only failure of
the mighty people of Quebec.

1143
01:06:02,426 --> 01:06:04,893
How many people has he killed?

1144
01:06:04,895 --> 01:06:06,728
Twenty-three.

1145
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,396
And if your friend
has been abducted

1146
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:11,466
by the same monster
that I am hunting,

1147
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,836
it is probably going to be
24 pretty soon.

1148
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,240
His MO is always the same.

1149
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:21,977
A month after
the disappearance,

1150
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:25,814
we find pieces
of the skinned body.

1151
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:29,918
And the legs are always
amputated at the knees.

1152
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,922
Arms are always
fused to the body,

1153
01:06:33,924 --> 01:06:37,425
like a kind of
a crucified T-Rex.

1154
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:40,595
You know, like that.
That's what it looks like.

1155
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:45,633
And always the mouth
and the teeth
have been disturbed.

1156
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:46,635
How?

1157
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,403
Mmm.

1158
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:53,575
With a very thick, um...

1159
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,545
Ah!

1160
01:06:58,547 --> 01:06:59,881
What was I saying?

1161
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:03,518
How have they been disturbed?

1162
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,888
In every case,
the tongues have been
ripped out.

1163
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:07,890
Jesus!

1164
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:10,125
Oh, yes.

1165
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:13,167
It is one fuck
of a bummer to look at,
I can tell you that.

1166
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,631
Were any of them...

1167
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,634
Sexually...

1168
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:22,670
Oh, no, no.
He doesn't touch them
like that.

1169
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:24,072
He butchers them.

1170
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:27,409
Amputates limbs,
cuts out tongues.

1171
01:07:27,411 --> 01:07:31,646
But he don't do nothing
sexy with them, you know.

1172
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:33,214
Never.

1173
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:38,686
The boys on the force
nicknamed this killer
"The First Wife,"

1174
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:42,157
because the first wife
doesn't let you talk,

1175
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:46,494
she doesn't let you
go anywhere,
and she does not fuck you.

1176
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,331
See it's...

1177
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:54,335
And she don't fuck you.

1178
01:07:54,337 --> 01:07:57,205
It's... It's funnier
if you've been married
a few times.

1179
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:59,207
Maybe we should be talking
to someone else.

1180
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:00,608
Mmm...

1181
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,679
I think that
that's a very good idea

1182
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:06,881
for you to go
and talk to someone else,

1183
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:09,551
Mr. Big Bear
Riding a Bulldozer.

1184
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:13,888
Or maybe you could just<i> ferme</i>
your fucking<i> bouche</i>

1185
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,590
for one second

1186
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,625
and listen to Guy Lapointe.

1187
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,061
Hmm?

1188
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:23,264
- Let me tell a story.
- Okay.

1189
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,632
I believe that two...

1190
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,502
Can you come closer?

1191
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:31,239
Can you come closer?

1192
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:34,809
Closer, you... Can you come...
Can you come closer?

1193
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:40,148
I believe
that two years back,

1194
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:43,618
I met this son of a bitch.

1195
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,435
Ah, well!

1196
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:03,304
Good afternoon to you, sir.
I am Guy Lapointe.

1197
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,974
Surete du Quebec.

1198
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:10,078
Oh! Did you come here
about the spider?

1199
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,413
Hmm?

1200
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:15,016
I called the police
two days ago

1201
01:09:15,018 --> 01:09:19,320
because there's
a big ol' spider
in my potty hole.

1202
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:20,922
Your "potty hole"?

1203
01:09:20,924 --> 01:09:23,458
The shitter!

1204
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:27,162
...Oh, I see.

1205
01:09:27,164 --> 01:09:31,866
So you have some sort
of creepy crawler thing
in your toilet box?

1206
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:35,870
Yes, he's a big ol'
brown recluse.

1207
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:38,873
-Yeah. They call it
the hobo spider.
-Oh.

1208
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,975
And it's mean.
I called the police.

1209
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:43,178
And the lady
on the phone said to me,

1210
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:47,382
"Oh, we'll send somebody
out in a few days."

1211
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:49,617
Well, I have to regret...

1212
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:53,221
Regretfully inform you
that I'm not the man.

1213
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:56,658
I'm not that man who was sent
by the lady who said
she was sending someone.

1214
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,293
I'm not him.

1215
01:09:58,295 --> 01:09:59,994
You're not gonna
shoot the spider?

1216
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:04,365
As an inspector
of the Surete du Quebec,
er...

1217
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:09,337
I'm actually not authorized
to discharge a weapon...

1218
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:12,040
- ...at a bug.
- Oh.

1219
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:14,576
One of the downsides
of the job.

1220
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:17,812
But I come today
because I'm investigating...

1221
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,483
Well, a disappearance.

1222
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:25,019
- Oh?
- Yes, sir.

1223
01:10:25,021 --> 01:10:28,489
The hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree,
from Quebec City.

1224
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:30,592
A lot of people
have heard of him.

1225
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:34,896
I have even heard of him
once or twice
before all of this happened.

1226
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:37,031
So, many people
have heard of him.

1227
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:39,334
Have you heard of him perhaps?

1228
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:42,070
- No.
- No.

1229
01:10:42,072 --> 01:10:44,906
No. Well, last month,

1230
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:48,543
he was drafted
by the New Nordiques.

1231
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:51,279
Oh, well...
Piss on the New Nordiques!

1232
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:54,249
Give me back my old Nordiques.

1233
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:55,917
I...

1234
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,518
Do you know something, sir,

1235
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,922
I truly respect
your, er, passion

1236
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:03,558
for the game of the hockey.

1237
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,126
Huh?

1238
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:08,596
So anyway, this hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree...

1239
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:12,467
I guess he'd seen some
sort of advertisement

1240
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:16,471
in a bar bathroom
that said, "We can give you
a place to live

1241
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:20,441
"in a living situation
that's not far from here."

1242
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:23,645
But somewhere between
here and Quebec City,

1243
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:26,881
the hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree...

1244
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:30,451
- Well, he went missing.
- Oh.

1245
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:34,956
And so I stopped by to see
if maybe you might have heard

1246
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:39,060
or seen something
that was a little
out of the ordinary

1247
01:11:39,062 --> 01:11:42,597
the other night
on that Monday...
Monday night.

1248
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:45,733
Oh, no, not Monday night,
because I'm down at the rink.

1249
01:11:45,735 --> 01:11:48,770
I'm down at the ice rink
Monday nights,
with the little mites.

1250
01:11:48,772 --> 01:11:51,572
Oh, do you coach
the hockey mites?

1251
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:56,577
No, no, I'm not the coach.
No, no, I'm just the coach's
helper monkey, you know.

1252
01:11:56,579 --> 01:11:59,647
On Monday nights,
I come and I pick up
the sticks,

1253
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:03,985
and I bring the little ones
water, you know,
during the drills,

1254
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,353
- and all that.
- Uh-huh.

1255
01:12:05,355 --> 01:12:08,356
And then on Monday nights
we go out for poutine.

1256
01:12:08,358 --> 01:12:11,359
Have you ever been
to Poutine-ee Weeny,
on Rue de Jour?

1257
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:15,463
Poutine really does not
agree with me.

1258
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:17,598
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- My innards...

1259
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,335
It creates such a, er...

1260
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:24,472
Poutine gives me
just the worst shits.

1261
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:29,277
I'm sorry to be
so crass about it
and everything.

1262
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:32,046
By the way, you know,
I didn't even get your name.

1263
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:34,682
Bartholomew Moseeay.

1264
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:38,052
You sure you don't have time
to come in and kill a spider?

1265
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:40,855
You know, I would...
I swear to you
that I would help

1266
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:43,458
- in any way that I could...
- Yeah.

1267
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:47,061
I would help,
but I'm really just a lowly
homicide detective

1268
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:49,997
and I'm really not
paid enough to, er...

1269
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:53,968
To deal with
the savage animals, you know.

1270
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:56,904
You know what I think,
Mr. Lapointe?

1271
01:12:56,906 --> 01:12:59,841
I think that the real
savage animals

1272
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:02,577
are the human beings.

1273
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,314
Oh.

1274
01:13:06,316 --> 01:13:08,850
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you so much.

1275
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:12,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1276
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:14,355
- Thank you.
- Have a wonderful day, sir.

1277
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:15,923
Thank you very much.

1278
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:20,762
In all of the Canada,

1279
01:13:20,764 --> 01:13:23,831
there is no record...

1280
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:28,035
Of a man named
Bartholomew Moseeay.

1281
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:32,774
There is no local rink,
there is no hockey mites.

1282
01:13:32,776 --> 01:13:38,112
And I would also assume
that there is no
Poutine-ee Weeny.

1283
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:40,014
But ever since that day,

1284
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:44,452
I've stopped
making the assumptions,
you know.

1285
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:50,124
The hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree...

1286
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:53,094
He was probably
in that house, you know.

1287
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:57,031
And I was standing
on the porch,

1288
01:13:57,033 --> 01:14:00,568
assuming that I was talking
to some harmless simpleton

1289
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:02,703
who spoke funny.

1290
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:04,705
But, um...

1291
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:09,110
But one month later,
we find what is left

1292
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:14,015
of the hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree.

1293
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:20,955
His torso was blocking up
a sewer pipe
outside of Gatineau.

1294
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:25,960
So...

1295
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:33,134
The man-child,
Bartholomew Moseeay...

1296
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:38,840
Or Howard Howe,
went poof!

1297
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,909
Poof! Disappear.

1298
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:43,811
He disappeared.

1299
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,582
Do you want to know
what my theory is?

1300
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:52,854
The theory that got me excused
from the Surete du Quebec?

1301
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,757
Please.

1302
01:14:56,759 --> 01:15:02,630
All of the victims
have holes in the mouth.

1303
01:15:02,632 --> 01:15:07,502
He cuts off the legs,
he sews the arms...

1304
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:13,274
But he puts something
in their mouths
that we don't get to see.

1305
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:15,176
Some of the cops were saying
that the holes

1306
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:17,338
are from the meat hooks,
you know, if they...

1307
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:22,350
They hang up the body,
while you use to rip it up,
the flesh and all that.

1308
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:24,285
You know what I mean?

1309
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,189
I beg to differ.

1310
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:32,226
- Well, what do you say?
- Ah, well...

1311
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:35,162
The hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree,

1312
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:38,633
the boy that I failed to save.

1313
01:15:38,635 --> 01:15:41,636
Just like all the rest,
he had missing legs,

1314
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:44,005
missing tongue, missing teeth,

1315
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:47,174
the hole in the roof
of the mouth.

1316
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:50,711
But the medical examiner,
he found something...

1317
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:56,083
Inside the hole
of his mouth.

1318
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:06,027
It was a tiny piece of
the victim's own tibia bone.
No bigger than this.

1319
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:08,663
So why would a piece
of his leg bone
be in his mouth?

1320
01:16:08,665 --> 01:16:11,399
Oh, I don't know.

1321
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:17,204
So I go to see this mama
of the hockey player,
Gregory Gumtree.

1322
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:19,607
And I say to her,
"You are the mama

1323
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:22,777
"and you know the things
about the child.

1324
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:27,748
"You feel things that
no police or nobody can feel.

1325
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:31,485
"So, how do you think
your boy was killed?"

1326
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,791
And the mama, she's...
She is crying, you know.

1327
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:41,195
And now it is as if she is
like my own mama, you know.

1328
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:47,401
And then the mama,
she say to me...

1329
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:50,037
She say to me...

1330
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:57,945
"This man is making
a monster.

1331
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:01,616
<i>- "This man
is making a monster."</i>

1332
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:04,051
Mr. Tusk...

1333
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:06,854
Why do you blubber so?

1334
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:11,726
Are you really mourning
your loss of humanity?

1335
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:14,295
I don't understand.

1336
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:16,831
Who in the hell
would want to be human?

1337
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:19,834
God almighty!

1338
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:22,403
In all my travels,

1339
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:30,344
I've only ever known a human
to be an ocean of shit.

1340
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,949
And my vessel lifts...

1341
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:36,917
And is leaking.

1342
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:45,326
I am so very tired,
Mr. Tusk.

1343
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:53,968
Battered by a life
of cruel fate...

1344
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:57,505
And poor decisions.

1345
01:17:57,507 --> 01:18:01,242
And the terrible
consequences of both.

1346
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:10,651
<i>¶ The water is wide</i>

1347
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:17,425
<i>¶ And I dare not cross over</i>

1348
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:22,363
<i>¶ Nor have I wings...</i>

1349
01:18:25,568 --> 01:18:27,802
<i>¶ Wings to fly</i>

1350
01:18:30,907 --> 01:18:34,909
<i>¶ Build me a boat</i>

1351
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:40,047
<i>¶ That can carry two</i>

1352
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:49,156
<i>¶ And both shall row</i>

1353
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:53,194
<i>¶ My love and I</i>

1354
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:58,032
Oh.

1355
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,102
You must be
terribly hungry by now.

1356
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:12,546
That is a mackerel.

1357
01:19:17,019 --> 01:19:19,587
Bon appetit, Monsieur Tusk.

1358
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:45,746
Yes...

1359
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:53,587
Now go to the fish, Mr. Tusk.

1360
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,193
Take the mackerel.

1361
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:12,873
Feed.

1362
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,856
So this is nice
and very roomy for an economy.

1363
01:20:28,858 --> 01:20:31,926
I should have rented
this model, I knew it.

1364
01:20:31,928 --> 01:20:34,962
-Did you pre-pay
for the gasoline?
-Uh, yeah.

1365
01:20:34,964 --> 01:20:37,932
- So where do we go first?
- Now, where?

1366
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:39,767
Where is for wolf.

1367
01:20:39,769 --> 01:20:42,770
We look for the which.

1368
01:20:42,772 --> 01:20:46,807
As in, which one of you
knows this missing podcaster
the best.

1369
01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:48,108
I do.

1370
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:50,678
- You do.
- Yeah.

1371
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:54,815
Okay, so on the phone message,
it said he was driving for,
like, two hours or something.

1372
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:58,986
So you know him best,
you know what he likes
to do when he drives,

1373
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:02,356
because nobody
does nothing in a car.

1374
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:04,992
Does he smoke
the cigarettes,
does he chew the tobaccos

1375
01:21:04,994 --> 01:21:07,895
or toothpicks,
does he drink the coffee?

1376
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:09,697
Does he have some other thing?
I don't know.

1377
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:11,866
Me, for example, all I do...

1378
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:17,371
I cannot start the car without
having the double-double

1379
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:21,141
with eight sugars
and just a dash of cream.

1380
01:21:21,143 --> 01:21:23,544
So what we really need to do

1381
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:28,249
is discern this podcaster's
ritual while he is driving.

1382
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:34,855
He likes big, goofy
convenience store drinks.

1383
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:42,563
Oh, my God!
It's Mr. Mustache.

1384
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:46,834
- Colleen! Hurry up!
- I'm coming.

1385
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:50,971
Oh, my God, what?

1386
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:54,508
No way! It's Mr. Mustache.

1387
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:57,544
"Mr. Mustache"?

1388
01:21:57,546 --> 01:22:01,348
No, it's not the room
I'm interested in as much
as you, Mr. Howe.

1389
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:04,785
Yeah, tonight would be...
That would be amazing, sir.
Yes. Thank you.

1390
01:22:04,787 --> 01:22:06,620
All right, where am I going?

1391
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:10,524
Bifrost? Sounds erotic.

1392
01:22:10,526 --> 01:22:12,459
Okay, let me just ask
somebody how far I am.

1393
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:15,262
Excuse me, hey!

1394
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,964
How's everything
over at Degrassi, huh?

1395
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:19,133
You kids still getting
knocked up and shot at?

1396
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:21,435
...What?

1397
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:22,870
Degrassi!

1398
01:22:22,872 --> 01:22:25,873
Never mind. Uh, how far
is Bifrost from here?

1399
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:27,875
Bifrost?
Shit! That's far.

1400
01:22:27,877 --> 01:22:29,476
Yeah, it's about two hours
from here.

1401
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:31,712
Oh, God bless you,
generous angels.

1402
01:22:31,714 --> 01:22:33,814
Yeah, the kids here at
the convenience store

1403
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:35,883
are telling me that it's
about two hours away.

1404
01:22:35,885 --> 01:22:37,551
I hate American guys.

1405
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:39,119
You sure that's not gonna be
too late for you, Mr. Howe?

1406
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:42,489
Okay, awesome. Yeah.
What's your address?

1407
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,758
Hang on one second, sir.
Hang on.

1408
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,260
- Hey, hey, hey!

1409
01:22:46,262 --> 01:22:48,429
Can you get off those
for one second
and give me a pen?

1410
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:50,331
Sorry, sir.

1411
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,799
Thank you. God bless you.

1412
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:53,233
You guys have pads here,
in Canada?

1413
01:22:53,235 --> 01:22:55,169
Anything to write on,
or you just write in the air?

1414
01:22:55,171 --> 01:22:57,438
Hashtag thanks.

1415
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,506
Hey, I'm just gonna go ahead
and write on ya.

1416
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:02,142
Okay, shoot, Mr. Howe. Yeah.

1417
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:05,612
Great. Got it.

1418
01:23:05,614 --> 01:23:08,115
And I'm gonna leave
right now, so I'll see you
in about two hours.

1419
01:23:08,117 --> 01:23:11,418
Good. Okay, bye now.

1420
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,655
- How much do I owe you?

1421
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:20,861
That's me?
That's my mustache?

1422
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:24,498
"Yep! I'm American.
How are things over
at Degrassi High?"

1423
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:28,068
"Do you ladies know
where Bifrost is? Uh, duh!"

1424
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:30,838
You guys suck.

1425
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:35,776
So this pad of paper
that he borrowed
to write down the address,

1426
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:38,818
I would like for you
to give it to me, please,
if you would.

1427
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:41,315
Give him the pad.

1428
01:23:41,317 --> 01:23:42,950
You give him the pad.

1429
01:23:42,952 --> 01:23:44,485
Give him the pad!

1430
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:46,987
One of you
must give me the pad now.

1431
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:51,992
I thank you very much.
Do you have a pencil?

1432
01:23:51,994 --> 01:23:53,560
Thank you very much.

1433
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:01,802
You see that?

1434
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:04,705
Wow...

1435
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,174
That's amazing.

1436
01:24:07,176 --> 01:24:09,576
They did it in
<i>The Big Lebowski.</i>

1437
01:24:09,578 --> 01:24:13,313
Do you know, that's exactly
where I learned it from.
Isn't that weird?

1438
01:24:13,315 --> 01:24:14,548
Okay.

1439
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:27,528
Yeah. Isn't this soothing
to the soul?

1440
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,434
You know,
if I close my eyes,

1441
01:24:33,436 --> 01:24:36,870
I can almost imagine me
back on Ponder Rock,

1442
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:40,874
I knew peace in this
twisted, hateful world.

1443
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:45,779
I miss our little paradise,
Mr. Tusk.

1444
01:24:45,781 --> 01:24:50,084
This is just a poor facsimile
of that magical enclave

1445
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:52,286
where we first became
good friends.

1446
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:54,755
Remember?

1447
01:24:57,959 --> 01:24:59,593
Until that...

1448
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:02,529
Terrible day.

1449
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:09,436
<i>Man feeds on the meat
and sinew of the helpless.</i>

1450
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:14,408
<i>-Until we are all...</i>

1451
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:15,542
<i>...alone.</i>

1452
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,880
<i>We survive at all costs.</i>

1453
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:22,816
<i>Only to butcher again.</i>

1454
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:25,586
<i>And again.</i>

1455
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:31,125
<i>Until we ourselves</i>
<i>are at last butchered</i>
<i>in turn.</i>

1456
01:25:32,928 --> 01:25:36,563
You were not prepared
for me last time, Mr. Tusk.

1457
01:25:36,565 --> 01:25:38,832
You were not ready
for the fight.

1458
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:40,801
This time
it will be different.

1459
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,804
Because I have hardened you...

1460
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,373
Just to show you...

1461
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:50,644
How cruel man can be.

1462
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:20,340
And if I truly brought out
the walrus in you...

1463
01:26:22,378 --> 01:26:27,247
...this time,
you just might prevail.

1464
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:32,719
Less than a kilometer
from Mile Marker 9...

1465
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:35,055
- Yeah, the plates match.
- I'm going...

1466
01:26:35,057 --> 01:26:37,491
No, no, he's not there.
I promise you he's not there.

1467
01:26:37,493 --> 01:26:40,360
But he is close.

1468
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:45,832
So...

1469
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:48,969
We are about
to find your friend.

1470
01:26:48,971 --> 01:26:51,371
And the dangerous man
who took him.

1471
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:56,009
These are guns.

1472
01:26:56,011 --> 01:26:57,110
I don't want one.

1473
01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:59,846
You don't want a gun?

1474
01:26:59,848 --> 01:27:01,682
You take 'em.

1475
01:27:01,684 --> 01:27:04,484
What...
What kind of American are you?

1476
01:27:04,486 --> 01:27:05,652
The kind that has never
used a gun before.

1477
01:27:05,654 --> 01:27:07,321
Take the fuckin' gun!

1478
01:27:07,323 --> 01:27:09,590
Yes, take the fuckin' gun,
please.

1479
01:27:09,592 --> 01:27:12,125
I'll take the big one.

1480
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:14,928
Yeah.

1481
01:27:17,099 --> 01:27:21,034
Some years back,
I was rescued from the island
of Ponder Rock

1482
01:27:21,036 --> 01:27:24,905
a mere hour
after I had butchered
my sweet savior walrus

1483
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:27,608
in order to live.

1484
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:31,111
I've marked this occasion
for 15 years now

1485
01:27:31,113 --> 01:27:33,947
by allowing
my flippered friend

1486
01:27:33,949 --> 01:27:36,183
the fighting chance
he never had.

1487
01:27:36,185 --> 01:27:37,718
So...

1488
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:41,355
You will fight me, Mr. Walrus!

1489
01:27:41,357 --> 01:27:44,124
Or you will die!

1490
01:28:02,044 --> 01:28:03,377
Wallace!

1491
01:28:03,379 --> 01:28:05,112
Wallace!

1492
01:28:21,163 --> 01:28:24,231
- Wallace!
- Wallace!

1493
01:28:24,233 --> 01:28:27,167
So just as I had to kill you
on the rock,

1494
01:28:27,169 --> 01:28:30,170
you have a terrible
choice to make here.

1495
01:28:30,172 --> 01:28:34,574
You have to kill me
if you want to live.

1496
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:37,577
And if you live,

1497
01:28:37,579 --> 01:28:41,982
you will be as a walrus
that you almost are.

1498
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,283
So...

1499
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:46,119
Either you go full walrus...

1500
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:48,922
...Or this!

1501
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,933
Oh, what the fuck?

1502
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:03,203
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Wallace!

1503
01:29:03,205 --> 01:29:05,672
- Wallace!
- Wallace!

1504
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,810
You have lasted
longer than the rest.

1505
01:29:09,812 --> 01:29:11,378
You'd kill me if you could.

1506
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:15,148
You want to.

1507
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:18,819
Your survival instincts
have kicked in.

1508
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:32,999
But so have mine!

1509
01:29:46,415 --> 01:29:49,316
Where is it coming from?

1510
01:29:49,318 --> 01:29:50,917
- Behind the wall!
- Wallace!

1511
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:52,352
- He's behind the wall!
- Wallace!

1512
01:29:52,354 --> 01:29:55,355
- Ally, there's give.
- Stand back!

1513
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:13,206
It is accomplished.

1514
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:17,077
You are my...

1515
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:21,448
Mr. Tusk.

1516
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,630
Wallace...

1517
01:30:42,303 --> 01:30:44,604
No!

1518
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:57,651
Wallace!

1519
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:33,086
No! No!

1520
01:31:35,624 --> 01:31:38,191
No, don't murder him. Please.
Leave him alone.

1521
01:31:38,193 --> 01:31:39,960
Stop!

1522
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:38,084
Wallace!

1523
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:43,056
We're here.

1524
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:51,064
It's Ally.

1525
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:54,200
And Teddy.

1526
01:33:02,043 --> 01:33:03,109
The treat.

1527
01:33:28,302 --> 01:33:30,342
You don't have to hide
from us, Wallace.

1528
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:35,809
Wallace!

1529
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:49,623
<i>I can't even remember</i>
<i>the last time you cried while</i>
<i>watching</i> Winnie the Pooh.

1530
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:51,491
So I don't cry,
I mean, big deal!

1531
01:33:51,493 --> 01:33:53,760
I'm also a lot older,
remember?

1532
01:33:53,762 --> 01:33:55,228
Crying's kind of for babies.

1533
01:33:56,764 --> 01:34:00,066
I remember when
my grandma died and...

1534
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:04,237
My grandpa was destroyed.

1535
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:07,107
He had tears
streaming down his face,

1536
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:09,643
he was holding her picture,
and I was so worried.

1537
01:34:11,013 --> 01:34:14,948
I used to say...

1538
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:16,850
What's that?

1539
01:34:16,852 --> 01:34:19,252
Don't cry.

1540
01:34:19,254 --> 01:34:21,354
And he would say,
"No, Juanita."

1541
01:34:24,525 --> 01:34:26,526
"It's good to cry.

1542
01:34:28,429 --> 01:34:30,397
"It separates us
from the animals.

1543
01:34:32,299 --> 01:34:33,600
"It shows you have a soul."

1544
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:47,013
I love you, Wallace.

1545
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:50,750
Don't ever forget that.

1546
01:35:06,467 --> 01:35:09,069
It's all right.

1547
01:35:09,071 --> 01:35:10,403
Come on.

1548
01:38:59,366 --> 01:39:01,534
<i>Welcome to Smodcast.
I'm Kevin Smith.</i>

1549
01:39:01,536 --> 01:39:03,236
<i>- I'm Scott Mosier.
- Oh, shit!</i>

1550
01:39:03,238 --> 01:39:05,038
<i>All right,
so here's the third act.</i>

1551
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,440
<i>He then goes
and puts on his suit,</i>

1552
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:09,475
<i>you know, made of human skins.</i>

1553
01:39:09,477 --> 01:39:11,978
<i>And so you realize
he's done this before.</i>

1554
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:14,647
<i>-Like, I'm not the first</i>
<i>lodger and shit like that.</i>
<i>Gotcha.</i>

1555
01:39:14,649 --> 01:39:16,983
<i>So he's in it,
you're in yours,</i>

1556
01:39:16,985 --> 01:39:21,321
<i>and you guys have to have</i>
<i>one of them walrus fights,</i>
<i>like on the beach.</i>

1557
01:39:21,323 --> 01:39:24,624
<i>Where you slam each other,
going...</i>

1558
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:31,297
<i>And we started saying,</i>
<i>"Is man indeed</i>
<i>a walrus at heart?"</i>

1559
01:39:34,735 --> 01:39:38,237
<i>You ultimately get him
and...</i>

1560
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:41,441
<i>But then what has to</i>
<i>happen at the end is that</i>
<i>once he makes that switch...</i>

1561
01:39:41,443 --> 01:39:43,343
<i>- Yeah.
- ...he can't go back.</i>

1562
01:39:43,345 --> 01:39:45,645
<i>Like the clinic</i>
<i>for the criminally insane</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

1563
01:39:45,647 --> 01:39:47,280
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1564
01:39:47,282 --> 01:39:49,415
<i>And you see,
you know, like, his buddy...</i>

1565
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:51,284
<i>He's got something
wrapped in a newspaper</i>

1566
01:39:51,286 --> 01:39:53,486
<i>-and you don't know</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

1567
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:57,623
<i>It's a fish.
Oh, that's awesome.</i>

1568
01:39:57,625 --> 01:40:01,594
<i>And it is... It's like
another walrus enclave.</i>

1569
01:40:01,596 --> 01:40:03,997
<i>A better version
of where he was.</i>

1570
01:40:03,999 --> 01:40:07,266
<i>-Because he realized they</i>
<i>can't reverse the process.</i>
<i>No, they can't.</i>

1571
01:40:07,268 --> 01:40:10,436
<i>He's gone.</i>
<i>Even in his head,</i>
<i>he's gone full walrus.</i>

1572
01:40:10,438 --> 01:40:12,338
<i>You're right.</i>

1573
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:17,844
<i>And he</i>
<i>throws him the fish,</i>
<i>and then, fuckin'...</i>

1574
01:40:17,846 --> 01:40:23,349
<i>The walrus-man</i>
<i>scurries over to it</i>
<i>all gross and shit,</i>

1575
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:25,685
<i>and starts biting at it
on the ground.</i>

1576
01:40:25,687 --> 01:40:28,287
<i>They play, like,
some sad piano music.</i>

1577
01:40:28,289 --> 01:40:30,556
<i>Roll credits as we pull back
in this overhead,</i>

1578
01:40:30,558 --> 01:40:33,726
<i>watching him fuckin' eating
this fish off the ground.</i>

1579
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:38,364
<i>And there's a song
that's just like...</i>

1580
01:40:38,366 --> 01:40:41,868
<i>¶ Being tender
in your heart!</i>

1581
01:40:46,907 --> 01:40:50,076
<i>- Is that a real song?
- No!</i>

1582
01:40:50,078 --> 01:40:51,411
<i>Like, we need
a hashtag for this.</i>

1583
01:40:51,413 --> 01:40:53,246
<i>The conversation
needs to grow.</i>

1584
01:40:53,248 --> 01:40:55,014
<i>Two hashtags.</i>

1585
01:40:55,016 --> 01:40:58,317
<i>Walrus yes, walrus no.</i>

1586
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:00,053
<i>Oh, for people</i>
<i>who don't want it?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

1587
01:41:00,055 --> 01:41:01,854
<i>Your vote is crucial.</i>

1588
01:41:23,444 --> 01:41:28,581
You just had
to have the second slider.

1589
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:32,085
