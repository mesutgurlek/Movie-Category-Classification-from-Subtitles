I don't care about my bike.
I'm killing myself.

a lot of money on

take you off the meds?

No, I just stopped
on my own.

00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,708
So, what I'm
gonna suggest is that
we contact your parents,

74
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,770
let them know
what's going on,

75

and then we refer you
to one of our

the people that we admit
into this facility,

I am, too.

82
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,926
Well, can't you just, like,
give me something?

parents' consent.

Look, this is
serious business.

85
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:21,473
Maybe I'm not explaining right
how serious this is.

86
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,977
It feels like everything
is just building up,

back out there.

to stay here for a couple

they can help you in
ways that we can't.

I guess
I thought I was better.
Like I didn't need it.

if you want to keep
your feelings private,

459
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,742
but you should know that
there's nothing wrong
with being nervous

460
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,304
about your
interview tomorrow.

461
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,248
I'm not nervous
about my interview.

462
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,845
Then what is it, Bob?

463
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,045
PROFESSOR:
Maybe he's hungry.

464
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,247
HUMBLE: He doesn't
look hungry.

465
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,380
He looks tired.

466
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,548
JOHNNY: Did you
sleep last night?

467
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,716
PROFESSOR:
He didn't eat today.

468
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,781
HUMBLE: Yes, he did.

469
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,056
PROFESSOR:
Did you see him eat?

470
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,426
HUMBLE: I'm pretty
sure he ate.

471
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,555
JOHNNY: I didn't see him eat.

472
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:47,757
BECCA: I get anxious
when I'm tired.

473
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,231
Okay, listen.

474
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,262
I'm not hungry
and I'm not tired.
It's just the sweater.

475
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,397
It's all I have for
my interview tomorrow.

476
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,034
I told you it
was the interview.

477
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,100
It's a nice sweater, Bob.

478
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,204
No, it's not.
It smells like
a hobo's Band-Aid.

479
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,507
JOHNNY: But it looks
good on you.

480
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,341
About as good as
your hair looks on you.

481
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,511
Bobby, no insults, please.

482
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,789
I can loan you a shirt.

483
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,756
MINERVA: What was
that, Craig?

484
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,693
I'll just call my mom
and have her bring one
of my dad's shirts over.

485
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:20,328
It's not a problem.
I live like two blocks away.

486
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,456
No, thanks.

487
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,160
Bobby! Take the shirt.

488
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,229
Yeah, he's trying
to help, Bob.

489
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,834
MINERVA: It's a very
nice offer, Craig.

490
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,738
Bobby, why are you
reluctant to accept it?

491
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,972
(SIGHING) 'Cause I don't
want any handouts.

492
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,674
It wouldn't exactly
be a handout.

493
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,238
He'd just be
loaning it to you.

494
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,477
Okay, I'll take it.
As long as you'll
get off my back.

495
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,077
Do you want
the shirt, Bobby?

496
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,211
I would...

497
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,116
I would like the shirt.

498
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,589
MINERVA: Craig?

499
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,588
Is it okay if it has
yellow armpit stains?

500
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,697
(EXCLAIMS) Sorry,
it was a dumb joke.

501
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,063
BOBBY: When are you
going to let me get
to see her again?

502
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,103
Because I'm her father.
You don't think that I have...

503
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,336
BOBBY: What's that?
I do have...
I will have a place.

504
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:10,271
(STUTTERS) I have a...
I'm gonna have a place
on Thursday. It's true.

505
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,242
Listen, I never asked
you for anything.

506
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,586
Could you just, for once,
maybe do what I say.
Hello? Hello!

You were acting
a little weird earlier,

514
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,446
so I just
wanted to make sure
everything's okay.

All right, that's it.

Hey, Nia. What's up?

00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:31,219
Hey! Just finishing

I'll freak if I don't get in.

Um. Just feeling
kind of, you know...

527
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,872
Yeah, I noticed.
Is that why you weren't
in school today?

528
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,472
Yeah, I was
feeling pretty shitty,
so I just stayed home.

<i>Yeah. I get like that</i>

Depressed or whatever.

Do you take
anything for it?

You know,
your dad really wanted
to be here today,

560
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,185
he just had a client crisis.

Client crisis?

562
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,317
Yeah, but he said,
he's for sure
coming tomorrow.

Not really.

Did you talk to my school?

569

Because I really
can't have them finding
I'm in a place like this.

It could really
damage my future.

No, no. I just said
you were in the hospital.

I didn't say
anything specific.

I need is for them

mind me asking?

of here on Thursday.

Let me know if you
need somebody to practice
with or something.

What do you mean?

You want to try now?

If you're not
doing anything.

599
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,614
Okay, great.
Uh... Hold on.

the official shirt on.

Okay. You're ready?

602
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,268
Hold on one second.
I don't know if
I'll do it like...

603
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,971
Which is better, like...

00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:03,965
Yeah. That looks natural.

606
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,168
Okay.

607
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,670
You can relax.

(SIGHING) I'm nervous.

609
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:17,677
Okay, why is it that you
think you qualify to live
in this group home?

610
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:22,419
Because if you
don't accept me,
I'll be homeless.

611
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,129
Okay, good.

612
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,301
Yeah, I think you're ready.

00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,496
Really? I didn't
sound too desperate?

614
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,801
No. But, uh...

615
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,408
You might want to focus
on the positive things

616
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,002
that you get from
this experience

617
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,207
as opposed to, you know...

618
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,077
The negative.

619
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,410
Exactly. Like what
is it that you could
bring to the home?

620
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,717
Something special that
only you could offer.

621
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,955
It could be anything.
Maybe you have
a great attitude?

622
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,087
No.

623
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,131
You always clean up
after yourself?

624
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,166
Not really.

625
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,931
You know, I think
in these situations

626
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,031
it's okay to bend the truth
just a little bit.

627
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,976
Yeah. I just
don't want to get
people's expectations up

628
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,309
and then
disappoint them later.

629
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,481
That's it. You're pragmatic.
That's what you tell them.

630
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,452
Okay, yeah. Right?

631
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,318
Yeah, I know
you're gonna do great.

632
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,151
Thanks.

633
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,860
You want to play
some table tennis?

634
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,354
I'm pretty terrible
at table tennis.

635
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,729
It's all right.
It's just for fun.
Come on.

636
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,799
BOBBY: We play
a lot around here.
The problem is,

637
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,634
most people are
too zonked out on
their meds to compete.

638
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:43,765
One, zip.

639
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,302
She's a liar.

640
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:50,877
Please, baby. Baby.
Please listen. Listen.

641
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,815
I love you.

642
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,674
(CHUCKLES)

643
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,012
Don't worry about it.

644
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,090
Of course,
I forgive you, baby.

645

646
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,770
You came.

647
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:26,180
Yeah. I mean,
I had other plans,
but I canceled them.

648
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,943
Good. I thought
I might have scared
you off yesterday.

649
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,355
Oh, yeah,
celebrity suicide.

650
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,355
It's kind of weird.

651
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,795
Okay, so check it out.
We're gonna play
a different game today.

652
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,062
Okay.

653
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,969
I ask you a question
and you ask me a question.

654
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,332
Do we answer them?

655
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,174
It's up to you,
but no matter what,

656
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,476
you have to finish
with a question.

657
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,072
Here we go. You ready?
Yeah.

658
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,346
(CHUCKLES) I said
finish with a question.

659
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,881
Are you stupid?

660
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:09,220
Uh, no... Are you?

661
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,387
There you go.
Do you think
I'm gross looking?

662
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,993
No. You look awesome.

663
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,098
What's your question?

664
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,909
Why'd you invite me here?

665
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,541
I thought it was nice
that you loaned
Bobby your shirt.

666
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,549
Don't you think
this is a good way
to get to know someone?

667
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:33,743
Sure.

668
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,809
Have you played this before?

669
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,285
Not in here.

670
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,314
Are you a virgin?

671
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,450
(CHUCKLES) So...

672
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,795
How long have
you been here?

673
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,297
Nice transition, Craig.

674
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,058
Twenty-one days.
Who dragged you here?

675
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,105
I checked myself in,
I guess.

676
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,770
Kind of, by accident.

677
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,077
The suicide hotline
said to come.

678
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,140
Why are you here so long?

679
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,976
They think I might
cut myself again.

680
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,615
Why'd you call
the suicide hotline?

681
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,219
I guess...

682
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,084
Maybe I didn't really
want to kill myself.

683
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,527
But I kind of did.

684
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,627
Does that make sense?

685
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,733
So, where do you go?

686
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,668
Executive Pre-Professional.
You?

687
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:31,867
Delfin.

688

You're not some sort of
school uniform perv,
are you?

689
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,511
You guys wear uniforms?

690
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:38,842
I knew it.

691
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:44,048
Okay, sorry, I'm gonna
invade your personal
space for one second.

00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,179
Why?

00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,252
What are you doing?
I'm just...

Ow, you shocked me.
Make a wish.

695
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,166
What do we do now?

696
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,037
Are you still playing?

697
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,411
No. Are you?

698
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,575
I'll race you
to arts and crafts.

703
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,939
Still working on it,
Cool Craig?

704
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,804
(SOFTLY) It's not
what you think.

705
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,844
I think the two of you
were playing the
question game outside.

706
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,276
That's what I think.

707
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,315
Well, I guess it is
what you think then.

708
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,372
I thought so.

This is free period

I'm Joanie,

I'm Craig.

712
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,659
Well, materials
are on the table, Craig.
So just go for it.

713
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,455
That's okay.
I don't really draw.

714
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,997
Sure you do.
It doesn't have to
be representative,

715
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,037
it can be abstract,
whatever you want.

716
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,265
Well, I'll just hang out,
if that's okay.

is having what we call

what to draw.

How about beavers?

721
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,911

draw the sort of beavers
you're talking about.

Oh, really?

Five years old and
I'm already a failure.

What can't you do?

I can't even trace Manhattan
on tracing paper.

Tracing paper!
Are you kidding me?

Craig, you can't
trace freehand and
expect it to be perfect.

Why not?

00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:54,074
Because, honey,
you're five years old.

That's no excuse.

Instead of trying to
trace maps of Manhattan,

why don't you just
make up your own maps?

Dollar.

926
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,352
For the pizza party.

927
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,284

Don't worry about it.

(LAUGHING)

929
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,600
Yeah, it's a true story.

930
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,437
He was one of
the Black Panthers.

931
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,067
And you never
heard from him again?

932
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:09,505
Mmm-mmm.

933
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,078
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

934
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,843
Don't touch me.
See that lady right there?

935
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,612
She was a radical
academic up at Columbia,

936
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,118
and then they
passed the Patriot Act.

937
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,950
You know what
the Patriot Act is?

938
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,148
Yeah.
Okay.

939
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,852
When they passed
the Patriot Act,
then she went bonkers.

940
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,230
She thought that Bush
put bugs in all the phones.

941
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,466
<i>Pretty crazy, right?</i>

942
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,578
And that guy,
Solomon, over there?

943
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,246
He's nuts, too.

944
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:48,944
He's part of this
Hasidic acid-head scene
in Williamsburg.

(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

946
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,432
He did 100 tabs of acid.

947
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,735
Don't look, don't look.
In one night.

948
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,875
And hasn't been
the same since.

949
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:18,905

Wow!

Kinda cool.

952
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,110
Some cool people in here.

953
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,882
Yeah, uh...

954
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,447
What about you?

955
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,483
What about me?

956
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,629
I just...

957
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,291
You know, um,
your daughter, Veronica.

958
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:38,891
When are you
gonna see her again?

959
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:44,135
You know, I think
my daughter is just
better off without me.

960
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,742
Come on.
No, really.

961
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,711
I mean, I'm not really
a role model in this place,

962
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,610
and I think she's just...

963
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,444
She's better off.

964
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,949
Look, I know that
it's none of my business,

965
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,559
and you can
tell me to get lost
whenever you want,

966
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,597
but I think that she's just
gonna want her dad around,

967
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,861
and I don't think
she's gonna care about...

968
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,698
You should get lost.

969
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,633
Okay.

970
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,877

that bad," you know.

Oh, sorry, I'm just...

1087
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,230
Relax. It's okay, babe.

1088
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:38,301
But you shouldn't
worry about rejection.

1089
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,500
You shouldn't.
You can practice with me.

1090

Practice what?

1092
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,214
No, that's okay.
Yeah, I'll be Noelle.

1093
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:48,216
I'll be Noelle. I'm Noelle.

Hey, Craig.
How's it going?

1096
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,949
Hey, Noelle.
I'm well. How are you?

1097
01:04:58,461 --> 01:04:59,519
Oh, good.

1098
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:01,889
I get out of here soon,

1099
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:03,625
which is pretty cool.

Do you like music?

1101
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:08,134
Yeah, sure.

Uh, you just gonna
sit there the whole time
you're asking her out?

1104

Stand up. I'm a lady.

1105
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:21,812
No, look man.
You gotta loosen
up a little bit.

1106

Come on, loosen up.

1107
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,280

No. Say that again.
You gotta use
more energy, man.

You gotta be excited.

(SIGHS) What'd you hear?

1152

I heard you tried to rape
a penguin at the zoo.

1153

Actually, I...

I heard your accountant say
that you tried
to kill yourself.

Well, this may come
as a surprise to you,
Cool Craig, but,

1159
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,776
she ain't my accountant.

01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,606
Gee, really?

1161
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:09,345
And I've tried to
kill myself six times.

but I couldn't
make it to the bridge.

1164

I just came straight here.

1165
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:24,697
What stopped you?

1166
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:29,598

You know, my parents
and my sister.

it would mess them up.

I don't get, Craig.

do just to be you,
for just a day?

I would do so much.

I would...

1174
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,462
I don't know.
I would just...

1175
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:07,832
I'd just live.

around somewhere.

please keep it down.

1238
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:24,556
Sex!

1239
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,028
Sex in my bed!

1240
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:27,090
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

1241
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:28,898
NIA: God, that's disgusting.

1242
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,996
MUQTADA: Children make
sex in my bed!

1243
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,665
Craig, who is this?

1244
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,299
Um, this is my
roommate, Muqtada.

1245
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,843
Don't talk to her!

1246
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,071
She try and
make sex in my bed!

1247
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,080
Calm down. No one
was having sex, okay?

1248
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:40,945
Woman is temptress! I know.

1249
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:42,444
What's wrong with you?
MUQTADA: Get out.

1250
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,918
Uh, he's going
through a hard time.

1251
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:47,148
No, you!
What's wrong with you?

1252
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:48,951
I'm also going
through a hard time.

1253
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,219
Um, you know what?
You should get some rest,

1254
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:52,521
and I'll call you
tomorrow or something.

1255
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,118
Nia. Nia, wait.

1256
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:57,358
(MUTTERING)

1257
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:00,459
Wait. Nia.

1258
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:05,803
I love you.

1259
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,135
Just get better, Craig.

1260
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:17,543
No, I mean...

1261
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:51,413
Noelle.

1262
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:53,778
Noelle, please.

1263
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,088
I'm sorry I messed up.

1264
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,926
I love your portrait.
It's amazing.

1265
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,493
I wish you'd open the door.

1266
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:06,032
Are you okay?

1267
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:16,639
Oh. Uh...

1268
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:20,707
This is pretty cool, too.

1269
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,220
So, our meeting tonight.

1270
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,185
Is it safe to assume
that's not happening?

1271
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,204
You've had it figured
out all along, Muqtada.

1272
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,665
Never get out of the bed.

1273
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:58,744
BOBBY: I got in.

1274
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,118
In what?

1275
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:04,648
In your mama.

1276
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:05,693
Oh.

1277
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:09,857
I got in the home.

1278
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,594
That's great.

1279
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,202
We missed you at breakfast.

1280
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,500
(GROANING)

1281
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,741
Is this about this
whole Nia<i>l</i>Noelle fiasco?

1282
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:24,771
How do you
know about that?

1283
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:27,314
Solomon. That dude's
got sensitive hearing.

1284
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,482
Look, it's not
just women, okay?

1285
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:33,681
I can't do anything right.
My life's a mess.

1286
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,455
No, my life is a mess.

1287
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,490
Muqtada's life is a mess.
No offense, babe.

1288
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,189
All good, papa.

1289
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:46,326
Look, I happen
to like you, Craig.

1290
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:50,496
You remind me of me
when I was your age.

1291
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:54,037
I was much better looking,
and I didn't have as much
trouble with women...

1292
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,270
Get back on track, man.

1293
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:58,939
The point is, in 20 years,

1294
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,939
if you're celebrating
your daughter's
eighth birthday

1295
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:03,041
in a place like this,

1296
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:06,649
I swear to God,

1297
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,380
Muqtada and I are going
to kick your ass.

1298
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,989
He not busy being born,

1299
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:16,820
is busy dying.

1300
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:22,227
You need to believe that.

1301
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,009
This Bobby,

1302
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:32,811
I think, very wise man.

1303
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,080
By the way, I was just
coming in to tell you that

1304
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,415
I'm not gonna be
homeless tomorrow.

1305
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:41,714
I'm just saying.

1306
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:45,926
(DOOR CLOSES)

1307
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,009
BOBBY: And guess what?

1308
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,840
It's right next door
to the YMCA.

1309
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,279
Yeah. So we can go swimming
in the swimming pool,

1310
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,444
and maybe play
table tennis.

1311
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:13,743
(CHUCKLES)

1312
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,551
Ping-pong, yes.

1313
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:18,583
It's the same thing.

1314
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,185
So listen, your mom will
bring you by on Saturday,

1315
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:22,924
and we could have a feast.

1316
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:59,733
There are so many people,
you know, not just
in this hospital,

1317
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:03,498
but in the whole world,
who are struggling
so hard just to live.

1318
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:09,001
And, it's like,
self-indulgent for me to
not appreciate what I have.

1319
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,602
Like what?

1320
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:17,317
Well, there's my family,
my home, and my friends.

1321
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,780
And you know,
there's this.

1322
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:26,719
I used to think art was just
bourgeois decadence, but...

1323
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,563
It's really wonderful, Craig.

1324
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,230
Thanks. Um...

1325
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,139
Yeah, I've done
about 20 of them

1326
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:41,038
and it's something
that I really enjoy.

1327
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:43,134
What do you enjoy about it?

1328
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,036
It's fun.

1329
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,846
And it takes my mind
off the things
that stress me out.

1330
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,814
You gonna continue it
when you leave?

1331
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:53,880
Yeah.

1332
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:57,753
Or, I think.
But my dad might freak.

1333
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,958
Have you told him
how you feel?

1334
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,222
Not yet.

1335
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,691
But you will?

1336
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:05,861
I think so.

1337
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,132
Thank you.

1338
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,642
It's my last
night tonight, Smitty.

1339
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,646
It is your
last night, Craig.

1340
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:23,673
I hate to break it to you,
Craig, but I think
I'm really gonna miss you.

1341
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:28,251
Well, it's Bobby's
last night, too,

1342
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:31,121
so I was wondering if we
could have a pizza party.

1343
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:35,229
Yes, we can.
Yeah. Do you have the money?
If you can get the money.

1344
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,629
Yeah, no, I'll have
the money. Yeah, I...

1345
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,326
You have records
you could bring?

1346
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:40,968
(VOCALIZING)

1347
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:56,011
Hey, um, thanks for coming.

1348
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,087
I just wanted to say,
I'm really sorry about
what happened yesterday.

1349
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:05,816
That girl I was with,
she's my best
friend's girlfriend.

1350
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,555
I've been obsessed
with her forever and...

1351
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:09,187
And you're
in love with her?

1352
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:10,889
No.

1353
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:13,434
Well, of course not.
But you think she's hot,

1354
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:15,526
so you told her what you
thought she'd want to hear.

1355
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,939
And now you're going to
do the same thing to me.

1356
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:21,540
No, I'm not.

1357
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,141
You're not?

1358
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,981
Look, um,
I do think you're hot.

1359
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,248
And I do want to say
the right thing,

1360
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,756
but that's only
because I really like you.

1361
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:41,457
I like how you don't
hide your problems
like everyone else.

1362
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:45,758
And I feel like I don't
have to hide mine
when I'm around you.

1363
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:51,371
You know, I've been thinking
about it a lot recently,

1364
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,168
and I've realized that

1365
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:58,034
if you're not busy being born,
you're busy dying.

1366
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:02,178
And I, for one,
think that we could
both benefit from

1367
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,242
being born, again.

1368
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:09,654
Not being born again,
but you know what I mean?

1369
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:11,887
Gee, thanks for
the wisdom, Bob.

1370
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:14,327
What? He told you that, too?

1371
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,130
Who?
Bobby.

1372
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:19,894
Yeah, me and about
a billion other people.

1373
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,701
Bob Dylan.

1374
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,973
It's the song
you just quoted.

1375
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,104
What? No.
Yes.

1376
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:31,936
Oh.

1377
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,417
Anyway, my point is

1378
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,287
I want to play
doctor with you.

1379
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:03,664
This is awesome.

1380
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:14,136
So, how come you
never asked me why?

1381
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:17,179
Why what?

1382
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:29,626
I guess I just
assumed you'd tell me
when you wanted me to know.

1383
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:35,093
Thanks.

1384
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:44,606
Do you like music?

1385
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,113
Do you like breathing?

1386
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:50,077
That's right.
It was a dumb question.

1387
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:57,924
I like... I like
Radiohead a lot,
the Pixies, T. Rex.

1388
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,317
Oh, what else?

1389
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,854
Have you seen them live?

1390
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,594
I saw Radiohead
and the Pixies once.

1391
01:25:07,168 --> 01:25:08,260
Cool.

1392
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,738
So, uh...

1393
