1
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,750
Lunchtime!

2
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,210
The longer you animals bark,
the colder your lunch gets.

3
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,090
Come on, move it out.
You too, down there!

4
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,340
Hey, turkey!

5
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,400
"You schmuck.

6
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,440
Do you think I'd be stupid enough
to kill myself?" Kill myself?

7
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,470
Come on!

8
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,940
Here he comes.

9
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,280
Francis, the lock.

10
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,610
Let go of the handle.

11
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,780
I don't have the handle! Open it!

12
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,160
Jake, up!

13
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,620
Come on, move! Get on!

14
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,160
Thanks, Mama.

15
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,840
Okay, you guys.
Let's try the victory pyramid.

16
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,010
Okay, let's go.

17
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,350
Come on. Put your arms up.

18
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,430
Smile. Good, we got it!

19
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,910
Turn that TV off.
I can't hear myself think.

20
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,580
Yeah, right, Dad.

21
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,130
Is the water going down, son?

22
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,050
- Nope.
- Is it going down now?

23
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,460
Wow, a police chase!

24
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,010
Oh, shit!

25
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,810
What are we doing here?

26
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,770
Trust in your mother, boys.

27
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,320
Throw her into four-wheel drive
and hold on to your hats.

28
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,990
Bummer!

29
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,240
Nothing exciting ever happens
around here anyway.

30
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,870
Who needs the Goon Docks?

31
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,330
Who needs this house?
I can't wait to get out of here.

32
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,000
Really?

33
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,220
No, I was just trying to delate
myself. No, no...

34
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,010
Dictate myself.

35
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,430
That's delude yourself, dummy.

36
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,220
That's what I said.

37
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,820
Thanks, Brand.

38
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,110
I know how you feel, wimp.

39
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm sure gonna miss this place too.

40
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,040
Adopted wuss.

41
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,660
I'm no adopted wuss!

42
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,790
I'll kill you, Brand!

43
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,710
It's Mouth.

44
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,050
Hey, Mikey.

45
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,470
Yo, Mikey.

46
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,890
Hey, Mikey, seen Adrienne?

47
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,890
- What's going down?
- Get your foot off the table.

48
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,480
You got it. What's going down, guys?

49
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,060
What's the matter with you guys?

50
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,980
What's the matter? What is this?
A nuclear Saturday?

51
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,570
Come on, guys.

52
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,900
This is our last weekend together.

53
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,910
Last Goonie weekend.

54
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,570
We gotta be going out in style.

55
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,580
Cruising the coast,
sniffing some lace...

56
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,750
...downing the brews, but no!

57
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,170
The one older brother had to go
and screw it up.

58
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,760
Flunking your driver's test?
I don't know what to do with you.

59
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,090
You guys, let me in!

60
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,430
Jerk alert.

61
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,600
It's Chunk.

62
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,680
I just saw the most amazing thing
in my entire life!

63
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,640
First, do the Truffle Shuffle.

64
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,480
Come on!

65
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,150
Do it.

66
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,650
Come on!

67
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,030
Do it!

68
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,200
Cut it out, Mouth.

69
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,330
Get out.

70
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,230
Thanks a lot.
You, guys, you won't believe me.

71
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,150
I'm telling the truth.

72
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,240
You turd!

73
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,110
- Flunked your driver's test.
- Shut up.

74
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,370
Listen, you'll never believe me.
There was two cop cars, okay?

75
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,580
They were chasing this four-wheel
deal, a real neat ORV.

76
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,830
Bullets flying everywhere. It was
the most amazing thing I ever saw!

77
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,670
More amazing than when
Michael Jackson used your bathroom?

78
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,470
More amazing than when you saved
those old people from that fire?

79
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,430
More amazing than when you ate your
weight in Godfather's pizza?

80
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,180
Okay, Michael Jackson didn't come to
my house to use the bathroom.

81
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,520
But his sister did.

82
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,070
Okay, Data, don't mess this one up.

83
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,530
Prepare for the Wings of Flight.

84
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,450
- Open the door!
- Mikey!

85
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,540
The screen door!

86
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,130
Hey! I bet you guys thought I
was gonna drop it, huh?

87
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,590
I know you'd expect that from Chunk.

88
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,010
- You idiot!
- Oh, my God!

89
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,640
Look, it's not broken.
It's perfect.

90
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,600
- Oh, my God!
- What?

91
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,060
- That's my mom's most favorite piece!
- What?

92
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,400
Oh, my God.

93
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,730
- You wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
- Shut up!

94
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,780
Shut up, Mouth.

95
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,610
- Any of you guys ever hear of Detroit?
- No.

96
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,870
Certainly. It's where Motown started.

97
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,120
Also got the country's
highest murder rate.

98
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,410
That's where we move to when we
lose our house tomorrow.

99
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,670
Shut up. It'll never
happen. My dad'll fix it.

100
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,670
Yeah, sure he will.

101
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,670
If he gets his next 400 paychecks
by tomorrow.

102
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,420
That's wrong, Brand.
It won't happen!

103
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,680
- Oh, hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

104
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,720
Hi, hi!

105
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,930
I see Data dropped by.

106
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,520
Hi, Mrs. Walsh. How are you?

107
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,650
Boys, this is Rosalita.

108
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,400
She'll help with the packing until
my arm's better.

109
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,450
Boys, Rosalita doesn't speak a word
of English...

110
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,120
...and I know some of you took
Spanish in school.

111
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,910
Well, Mrs. Walsh, I speak
perfect Spanish.

112
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,210
If it's any help to you, I'd be glad
to communicate with Rosalita.

113
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,170
You're a lifesaver, Clark.
Come with us, will you?

114
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,050
Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.

115
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,090
Mikey, no more potato chips.
Hello, Mikey.

116
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,220
It's Brand, Ma.

117
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,970
What?

118
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,980
I wonder if she'll notice.

119
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,400
That's what I said!

120
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,650
Of course. She notices everything.

121
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,150
Pants and shirts are in the second.

122
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,370
Just throw them all into boxes.
Forget the suitcases.

123
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,120
Can you translate that?

124
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,700
- Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.
- That's wonderful.

125
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,010
Look. How's that?

126
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,220
You idiot!
You glued it on upside down!

127
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,470
If God meant it that way,
you'd be pissing in your faces.

128
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,850
Looks fine to me.

129
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,060
Rosalita, this is the attic.
Mr. Walsh doesn't like anyone up here.

130
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,820
That's why it's always open.

131
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,040
This is my supply closet. You'll
find brooms, dustpans, insect spray.

132
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,210
I'd like the house clean
when they tear it down.

133
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,260
Clark, can you translate?

134
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,390
Okay, Rosie? You're gonna be
very happy here.

135
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,690
Come on, Clark, we've got more to do.
You're so fluent in languages.

136
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,610
You're so fluent in Spanish.
That was so nice of you.

137
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,740
"Nice" is my middle name.

138
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,660
I'm taking Rosalita
to the supermarket.

139
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,790
I'll be back in about an hour.

140
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,250
Mikey, stay inside. Brand, if he has
asthma, I don't want him in the rain.

141
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,300
He should be in a plastic bubble.

142
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm serious. That's not funny.

143
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,470
He takes one step outside, and you
are in absolutely the deepest...

144
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,720
Shit, Ma.

145
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,720
I don't like that language,
but that's what you'll be in.

146
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,890
- And you, Data...
- "Data".

147
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,850
- Use the back door from now on.
- All right.

148
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,440
What is that?

149
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,360
Oh, shit. What?

150
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,070
What is that?

151
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,450
That is a mess.
I want it cleaned up, boys.

152
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,330
- Oh, yeah. Sure!
- You got it.

153
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,660
One hour and I'll be back.
Bye, baby. Rosie?

154
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,870
- Bye, Mrs. Walsh.
- Bye.

155
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,550
You want a breathing problem?
You got one.

156
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,260
What'll happen to the stuff
in the attic?

157
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,300
My dad's giving it back
to the museum...

158
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,060
...or the new assistant curly...
Curney...

159
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,520
- Curator.
- Wait, guys.

160
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,480
Maybe there's stuff up there for us
that we can keep from the oldsiders.

161
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,860
Maybe there's some rich stuff!

162
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,150
No! It's my dad's responsibility,
you guys.

163
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,200
The museum's probably got a list.

164
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,490
Listen to me! That's his stuff!

165
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,250
Look at this. I didn't know Dad
had all this stuff up here.

166
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,670
- Great! Look at that! Neat!
- I love it.

167
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,470
Come on, guys!

168
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,010
My dad doesn't want you up here.

169
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,100
You heard what my mom said
about not wanting anybody up here.

170
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,690
I cannot believe you actually have
something this cool in your house.

171
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,230
You guys, my mom said...

172
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,650
Guys, stop. Put down
the outfit, okay?

173
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,440
This is great. We only have Hanukkah
decorations in our attic.

174
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,820
I don't care what you have in your...

175
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,040
Okay, you saw it, now let's go.

176
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,790
Come on, Mikey. It's cool!

177
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,670
I got you right where I want you!

178
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,170
It's dusty, my hay fever's acting up
and you always break something.

179
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,300
Mikey!

180
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,340
Come here and make me feel
like a woman.

181
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,010
Come on, give me a nice, wet,
lickery kiss.

182
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,020
I gotcha! Get out from there,
you're ruining the painting!

183
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,060
You're ruining my joke.
The painting's already cracked.

184
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,320
- Hey, Mikey?
- What?

185
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,110
What is all this stuff?

186
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,150
The museum did some...
Where'd you get this?

187
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,030
- Right there.
- They did a show. A retropactum.

188
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,830
- Retrospective.
- I said that. Don't contradict me.

189
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,370
It was about the history of Astoria,
and these are the rejects.

190
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,340
Kind of like us, the Goonies.

191
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,840
I'm not a reject.

192
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,760
Take that off.
You'll get me in trouble.

193
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,760
- You know how this works?
- What?

194
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,800
Laser beams!

195
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,100
Mouth, when you drop something,
put it back up...

196
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,190
What's this?

197
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,230
Wait a second.

198
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,040
Chunk!

199
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,620
I didn't touch it.

200
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,210
I know. Get over here.

201
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,050
Hold this.

202
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,800
Why me, Mike?

203
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,720
Thanks for taking us up here.
There's a real big ball...

204
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,350
...and it's got this thing...

205
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,060
What are you doing?

206
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,150
Mike found a map.

207
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,610
And look. That says "1632".

208
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,070
Is that a year?

209
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
No. It's your top score
on Pole Position.

210
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,490
Yes, it's a year.
It's a map of our coastline.

211
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,580
What's all that Spanish junk
right there?

212
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,500
Mouth, you said you can translate.
Translate.

213
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,790
Yeah, translate it.

214
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,170
"Ye intruders beware.

215
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,920
Crushing death and grief...

216
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,640
...soaked with blood
of the trespassing thief".

217
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,890
This map is old news.

218
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,560
Everybody went looking for that
when our parents were our age.

219
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,690
Haven't you heard of him?
What's his name?

220
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,310
The pirate guy. One-Eyed Willy.

221
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,900
One-Eyed Willy!

222
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,410
The most famous pirate in his time.
My dad told me all about him.

223
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,950
Dad'll do anything
to put you to sleep.

224
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,830
No! See, One-Eyed Willy
stole a treasure once.

225
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,870
And it was full of rubies
and emeralds...

226
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,040
And diamonds?

227
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,250
And diamonds. Then he loaded it
onto his ship...

228
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,590
...and sailed away into the sunset.

229
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,260
Until the British king found out
about it...

230
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,970
...and sent out his whole armada
to go after him.

231
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,850
It took them a couple of weeks
to catch up with Willy.

232
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,850
Then there was a whole big war...

233
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,400
...between the armada
and Willy's ship, the Inferno.

234
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,480
During the firefight, there were...

235
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,490
...guns and cannons bursting
here and there.

236
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,120
Then Willy fled, because he knew
he'd get killed if he stayed around.

237
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,580
And then he got into this cave...

238
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,620
...and the British blew up
the walls around him.

239
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,500
He got caved in,
and he's been there ever since.

240
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,710
- Forever?
- Forever.

241
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
And ever?

242
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,750
Trapped.

243
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,010
You sound as corny as Dad does.

244
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,140
My dad tells the truth.
Know what he said?

245
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,310
He said One-Eyed Willy and his bunch
were down there for years.

246
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,520
They were digging tunnels and caves.

247
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,650
- Setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

248
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,360
Setting booby traps so anybody who
tried to get in would die.

249
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,320
Then he killed all his men.

250
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,280
- Why?
- Why kill all of them?

251
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
So they wouldn't get his treasure.

252
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,120
Wait a minute.

253
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,660
If he killed all his men,
how did the map get out?

254
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,170
My dad said one of the guys must
have gotten out with the map.

255
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,460
- Hey, Mikey, I believe you.
- I don't believe you at all.

256
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
What did you break this time, Chunk?

257
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,390
Hey, you guys, look at this.

258
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,800
You ever hear of this guy?

259
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,600
Chester Copperpot.
Look what it says.

260
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,810
"Chester Copperpot, missing while
in pursuit of local legend.

261
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,480
Reclusive scavenger claims,
"I have the key...

262
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,070
...to One-Eyed Willy".

263
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,160
Wow, do you guys realize
what we could do?

264
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,700
Nobody ever found nothing.
Why would this map be in this attic...

265
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,670
...when it could be in some
safe-deposit box, right?

266
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,670
Right. If Chester Copperpot didn't
find it, how would we find it?

267
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,510
But what if? You guys...

268
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,260
...what if this map can lead
to One-Eyed Willy's rich stuff?

269
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,930
We wouldn't have to leave
the Goon Docks.

270
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,260
Come on, Mike.

271
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,930
I don't want to go on any more
of your Goonie adventures.

272
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,900
Where are you going?
You don't want to do this?

273
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,530
1632.

274
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,870
Jerk alert.

275
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,910
Can I help you?

276
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,370
Hello, little guys.
I'm Mr. Perkins, Troy's father.

277
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,960
We know Troy, he's a cheap guy.

278
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,710
My dad's not home, Mr. Perkins.

279
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,840
Is your mommy here?

280
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,220
No, she's down at the market buying
Pampers for all us kids.

281
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,680
Papers.

282
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,390
Well, you can give these papers to
your father to read through and sign.

283
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,270
We'll be by to pick them up
in the morning.

284
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

285
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,740
- What is that?
- It's Dad's business.

286
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,070
But what is it?

287
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,620
I told you it was Dad's business.

288
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,160
Look at them smiling.

289
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,210
They can't wait till tomorrow
to foreclose on whatever it's called.

290
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,880
Trash the Goon Docks.

291
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,130
I hope they make our house
a sand trap.

292
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,380
And never get their balls out.

293
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,430
You know, I think they made me
lose my appetite.

294
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,630
Come on, before you catch a real cold.

295
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,260
You're sure of yourself.

296
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,340
The foreclosure is a definite.

297
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,680
Oh, God, am I depressed.

298
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:57,600
If I found One-Eyed Willy's rich
stuff, I'd pay all my dad's bills.

299
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,940
Then he could sleep at night...

300
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,610
...instead of sitting up
figuring how we can stay.

301
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,400
- Me too.
- Me three.

302
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,110
Forget any adventures, limp lungs.

303
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,030
If I let you out, Mom will ground
me, and I've got a date with Andy.

304
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,000
You're dreaming, dude. No way.

305
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,250
Her mom has to drive, and then you
gotta make it with her and her mom.

306
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,130
- Shut up, Mouth.
- Yeah, Mouth.

307
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,000
Shut up, Data.

308
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,670
Jesus!

309
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,180
What'll we do about that country club?
It's killing our parents.

310
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,890
If we don't do something...

311
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,900
...there'll be a golf course
where we're standing.

312
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,020
Brand, how far can you stretch that?

313
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,100
It's not that hard.

314
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,730
Get off me, Chunk.

315
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,490
- Get off me!
- I got you.

316
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,580
What are you doing?

317
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,080
It took his 376 lawn mowing jobs
to pay for it.

318
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,840
It's his favorite thing in the world.

319
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,050
Now it's his flattest.
Let's go!

320
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,260
I'll hit you so hard, when you wake
your clothes will be out of style!

321
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,450
Mom. You've got to let me
out of here.

322
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,410
Can't you learn how to exercise
like a normal kid?

323
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,330
Look! You're hyperventrilicating.
Where's your brother?

324
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,170
Mom!

325
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,000
What's wrong with you people?

326
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,460
Rosalita, come here.

327
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,050
You gotta let me out of here.
Rosalita!

328
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,640
Rosalita, come here.
You gotta let me out of this.

329
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,810
- Hi, Mikey.
- Hi, Dad!

330
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,060
Hey, wait for me!

331
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:55,280
If you don't bring your brother home,
I'll commit Hare Krishna!

332
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,910
That's hara-kiri, Ma.

333
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,290
- That's exactly what I said.
- What?

334
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,750
My new tires!
They popped my new tires, the son of...

335
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,290
I'm gonna kill...

336
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,420
- My bike! My bike!
- I owe you one.

337
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,510
He's got my bike! I want my bike!

338
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,680
Gold Rock Beach is around
this next curve.

339
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,060
I have a feeling about this.

340
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,520
Every time you have feeling,
we get in trouble.

341
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,190
You're the one who always gets us
in trouble, 00-Negative.

342
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,440
I'm James Bond, 007, not 00-Negative.

343
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,280
I'm hungry. When my stomach growls,
there's trouble.

344
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,570
Shut up, Chunk!

345
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:43,500
You made me go up this big
hill and said give me a Twinkie.

346
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,420
I'll be late for dinner,
and my mom'll yell at me.

347
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,670
She's not gonna let me eat dinner,
and she's gonna punish me!

348
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,550
Anybody got a candy bar?
A Baby Ruth?

349
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,390
I can't believe it. That's it.

350
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,390
Those three rocks out there.
One, two, three.

351
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:21,490
Troy! You touch that mirror again,
and I'll smack you in the face.

352
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,250
There's Brand.

353
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,250
Like the bike.

354
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,920
What is he doing?

355
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,090
No wonder he can't get a license.

356
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,590
Oh, no.

357
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,760
Brand, can we give you
a ride somewhere?

358
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,520
No. Thanks anyway.

359
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,100
Walsh, let us give you a little ride.

360
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,820
Hold on. Here we go!

361
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,360
- Troy!
- Let go of my arm!

362
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,610
Oh, no.

363
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,000
Let go of my hand!

364
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,870
Oh, my God!

365
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,670
So long, sucker!

366
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,480
- Forget it!
- Come on!

367
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,520
- This better be it, Mikey.
- Shut up, Chunk.

368
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,400
Guys?

369
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,700
I think I have a match.
I'm sure of it.

370
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:47,120
The lighthouse, the rock and
the restaurant all fit the doubloon.

371
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,380
That must mean the rich stuff
is near the restaurant.

372
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,290
Wait a second.

373
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,630
Mouth, I need you to translate.
I don't understand Spanish.

374
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,300
- Right here.
- All right, all right.

375
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,850
- What's that?
- 10 times 10.

376
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,010
A hundred.

377
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,390
"Stretching feet...

378
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,350
...to nearest northern point".

379
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,360
- Which way is north?
- "That's where you'll find the treat".

380
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,360
That's it!

381
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,650
- That's north.
- Near the restaurant.

382
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,080
One, two, three, four,
five...

383
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,660
...six, seven, eight, nine...

384
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,760
Wait a minute. Somebody's there.

385
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,850
Sixty and another 40 is an even 100.

386
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,890
Right to the restaurant.
The rich stuff is there.

387
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,600
I don't know about it, Mikey.

388
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,440
It's getting late.

389
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,860
That's a summer place.
Why is it open in the fall?

390
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,990
There's nothing to be scared of.
Two customers went inside the place.

391
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,450
What if they're not customers?
What if they're drug dealers?

392
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,580
Drug dealers?

393
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,920
Did you see their clothes? Drug
dealers don't wear polyester rags.

394
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,800
Mikey, Mikey!
That sounded like gunshots.

395
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,430
Not the kind you hear in movies,
but real ones. They're gonna kill us.

396
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,730
Turn off your brain.
Somebody dropped a pot.

397
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,940
Yeah, a pot!

398
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,110
Are you sure, Mikey?
Because if you're sure, I'm sure.

399
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,780
If it's not the pots,
they might try to kill us.

400
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,740
They're gonna kill us!

401
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,370
Chunk, shut up!

402
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,590
Soda pop! Boy, am I thirsty!

403
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,170
Damn it!

404
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,800
What's that?

405
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,800
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!

406
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,390
The cook is carrying something
to the kitchen.

407
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,270
Yeah, food.

408
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,770
Don't let them see us.

409
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,240
ORV.

410
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,530
Bullet holes.

411
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,700
Bullet holes?!

412
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,670
Shut up, Chunk.

413
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,300
This is a summer restaurant? I bet
it hasn't been open in 10 summers.

414
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,310
How long you boys been at that window?

415
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,980
Long enough to see you need about
400 roach motels in this place.

416
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,020
How am I supposed to create
with that Smithsonian piece of shit?!

417
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,580
Jake, these boys are customers.

418
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,430
Boys...

419
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,470
...make yourselves comfortable, huh?

420
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,180
She's gonna cook you something.

421
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,310
What do you want?

422
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,690
- Lots of water.
- Water, water, water.

423
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,530
Four waters. Is that all?

424
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,150
No.

425
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,660
I want veal scallopini.

426
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,570
I want a good fettucini Alfredo.

427
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:57,000
A bottle of fettucine, 1981.

428
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,210
The only thing we serve is tongue.

429
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,670
You boys like tongue?

430
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,760
That's all?

431
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,430
Sit down!

432
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,520
Are you all right, Chunk?

433
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,690
Hey, guys.

434
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,200
What happened to the two guys
in the polyester who came before us?

435
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,240
- What happened to them?
- What is it? Spit it out.

436
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,740
You guys, if we don't
get out of here soon...

437
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,170
...there's gonna be
some kind of hostage crisis.

438
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,880
Out in the garage, ORV,
four-wheel drive...

439
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,210
...bullet holes the size of matzo ba...

440
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,550
Chunk, I'm starting to O.D.
On all your bullshit stories.

441
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
Here's your water.

442
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,680
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, ma'am.

443
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,980
I mean "ma'am".

444
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,890
This is supposed to be water?

445
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,980
It's wet, isn't it? Drink it!

446
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,900
Where's the men's room, please?

447
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,730
- Can't you hold it?
- No.

448
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,990
Mikey, this ain't the kind of place
you want to go to the bathroom in.

449
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,990
Why not?

450
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,910
Because they might have
daddy longlegs in them.

451
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,120
- But I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Like dead things, Mikey.

452
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,370
Hey, Mikey, gotta go to the bathroom?

453
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,460
- Killer dead things. Big. Please.
- Lady, please!

454
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,340
- Downstairs, first door on the right.
- Thank you.

455
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,470
- Stay to the right!
- Please, Mikey, dead things.

456
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,180
Stay to the right!

457
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,850
I know it's to the right, thank you.

458
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,190
I know you're down here,
One-Eyed Willy. You've gotta be.

459
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,360
I can feel it, One-Eyed Willy.
I know you're down here.

460
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,160
Oh, man, that stinks.

461
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,410
What the hell is that?

462
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,680
You're ruining it!
Look at the feast I made you.

463
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,390
Look at the feast I made you.
Want to eat it?

464
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,900
Have some. You'll get something.
You don't leave me any choice.

465
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,820
You don't leave me any choice!

466
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,700
You're just like Mom and Francis.
You never let me finish.

467
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,710
Why can't you stay at home?
I'm taking you out of here right now.

468
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,340
Let's get out of here!

469
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,010
Get out of here!

470
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,380
And stay out!

471
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,980
Kids suck.

472
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,980
I swear on my life, they've got it.

473
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,320
An It! A giant It!
They got it chained to the wall!

474
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,240
- The parts were all mixed around.
- Like your brain?

475
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,950
Say goodbye to your pals.

476
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,580
Hey, look at that.

477
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,540
- Ma, why'd you have to shoot him?
- He's a fed.

478
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,630
We could've taken him to the side
of a road and shot him in the brain.

479
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,260
- Bring him over here, Francis.
- Don't give me "over here".

480
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,010
I'm wondering, what is in the bag?

481
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,840
Restaurant trash. Yeah.

482
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,720
You sure? That big? That much?

483
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,100
There were bullet holes
in the car this big.

484
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,020
Mikey, come on,
our parents are worried.

485
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,070
- It's dinnertime. Let's go home.
- Home? What home?

486
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,320
In a couple more hours
it ain't gonna be home anymore.

487
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,320
Come on, guys, this is our time.

488
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,700
Our last chance to see
if there really is any rich stuff.

489
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,370
We've got to.

490
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,000
Get down, guys. Get down.

491
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,300
Oh, shit!

492
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,840
You guys scared me!
Almost gave me a heart attack!

493
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:06,180
- You look better from behind, Mouth.
- Want to see something really scary?

494
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,310
How did you get here?

495
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,100
We followed you guys.
We were out driving with Troy.

496
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,940
- Sorry about your face.
- It's okay, I was born with it.

497
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,280
- I'm kidding.
- Anyway, he was being a jerk.

498
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,610
Tilting the mirror
so he could look down my shirt.

499
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:26,200
- So I elbowed his lip.
- You elbowed his lip?

500
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,540
- It's locked.
- Thank God!

501
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,750
Wait a minute!

502
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,630
You know, I got some naked pictures
of your mom, taking a bath.

503
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,790
- Want to buy them?
- What?!

504
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,630
Real cheap.

505
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,510
Thanks, Chunk.

506
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,260
- Wait here. I'll get my brother.
- You'll get in trouble.

507
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,640
- Just don't leave, all right?
- No way I'm staying here.

508
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,900
Shut up! We got to get
to the lowest point of the floor.

509
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,490
Lowest point, nothing.
Let's go. Now!

510
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,990
Oh, my God!

511
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,200
- No, Brandon.
- Mikey!

512
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,840
- Oh, my God.
- It was disgusting.

513
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,260
It jumped out from the bushes.
I swear it almost killed us.

514
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:28,140
Please? What if we find something?
A few more minutes won't hurt.

515
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,350
Come on, Mikey, we're going now.

516
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,350
- Brand, give them a few minutes.
- Listen to your big brother.

517
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,150
As long as you stay here with me.

518
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,690
- She knows what she's talking about.
- She's a dame!

519
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,960
Chunk, I hope that was your stomach.

520
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,210
That's the It.

521
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,670
Sounds like Kong.

522
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,840
Part of it's human.

523
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,680
Come on. Want to see it?

524
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,760
Don't worry.
It's chained to the wall.

525
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,780
- I don't want to go.
- Why not? It's chained.

526
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,490
- Why not? It's chained.
- You wanted to go.

527
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,830
- Yeah, I wanted to go.
- So let's go.

528
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,540
I don't want to see it.

529
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,560
- Shame, shame!
- I know your name.

530
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,980
Come on, Brand, slip her the tongue.

531
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,980
That's disgusting.
No, I can't even look.

532
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,900
Get me up, guys!

533
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,870
One, two, three.

534
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,660
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

535
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,870
Can't you smell it, guys?
One-Eyed Willy really is down here.

536
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,750
We're walking right above...

537
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,590
I'm gonna build one like this one.

538
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,170
Water.

539
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,630
- Come on, we can do it.
- No, wait a minute.

540
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:34,010
Right about here must've been when we
said we gotta get to the lowest spot.

541
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,140
What are you two talking
to each other about, Mikey?

542
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,690
What the hell are you doing?
You're going to lose your fist!

543
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,190
What are you doing? Give me that.

544
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,570
There's nothing buried there.
This is the 20th century!

545
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,740
- The map says there is.
- Get off it! There's nothing...

546
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,870
Look it! I got an idea.

547
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:56,870
Let's put chocolate all over the floor
and let Chunk eat through it.

548
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,540
Okay, Mouth, that's all I can stand.

549
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,330
And I can't stand no more!
I got it! I got it! I got it!

550
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,510
- I don't got it.
- You klutz.

551
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,720
Hope it's not a deposit bottle.

552
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,510
This is ridiculous.

553
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,050
I feel like I'm babysitting,
except I'm not getting paid.

554
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,310
- Listen to that.
- What?

555
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,900
Sounds like my grandfather
taking a leak. Thrillsville.

556
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,320
No, it's deep.

557
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,740
Like there's a hole
or a passageway. Real deep.

558
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,570
Get out of the way.

559
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,120
- Brand is being so sweet to me.
- Oh, come on!

560
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,460
You're in the clouds,
and we are in a basement!

561
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,920
I told you!

562
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,710
Told you! I told you!

563
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,720
I can feel the air.
There's something down there.

564
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,890
It might be a treasure or something.

565
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,890
Hey, this is working, guys.

566
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,980
- Brand, careful!
- Are you okay?

567
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,320
I told you there was a passageway.

568
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:13,490
- It's the start of the tunnel.
- Look.

569
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,580
Fifty-dollar bill.

570
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,090
Fifty-dollar bill. Fifty-dollar bill?

571
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,090
Did he say, "Fifty-dollar bill"?

572
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,170
Fifty-dollar bills!

573
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,140
Hundreds of them!
We have money to save the Goon Docks!

574
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,900
Quiet!

575
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,860
They're fake. They're bogus.
They're phony.

576
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,780
I knew these people
were from the ozone.

577
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:56,030
You get 25 years for counterfeiting!

578
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,450
- I recognize these people.
- Look, it's the Fratellis.

579
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,290
- He was upstairs!
- The guy who tried to sing.

580
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,330
You guys never listen to me.

581
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,670
I said there would be trouble,
but you didn't listen.

582
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,130
You guys are crazy.
You guys are self-destructive.

583
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,460
There's a funny farm
with your names written all over it.

584
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,880
But I'm getting out of here. But...

585
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,300
I smell ice cream.

586
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,810
They got Swenson's.

587
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,730
They got Pralines and Cream.
And they got Mississippi Mud.

588
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,980
And they got Chocolate Eruption!

589
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,820
And they got apple!

590
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,650
And they got grape!

591
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,700
They got grape and Super-Duper
Chocolate Eruption and...

592
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,120
What, what?

593
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,800
It's a stiff!

594
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,180
The door!

595
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,030
- Somebody's been here. Door's open.
- Shut it.

596
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,860
- I'm gonna leave the lights on.
- Calm down.

597
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,370
Pizza.

598
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,370
Pepperoni.

599
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:33,130
- Ma, he's eating my pepperoni again.
- You want your pepperoni?

600
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,300
Let's kill each other
over the pepperoni.

601
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,300
Put that gun away now!

602
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,550
You always take his side.

603
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,970
That's right.

604
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,690
Put him back.

605
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,690
- Okay, close the door.
- We can go, guys.

606
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,910
Mikey? Mikey, come on.

607
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,290
The fireplace is the only way out.

608
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:10,460
- You guys will never get out that way.
- What?

609
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,590
It all starts here.

610
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,430
Guys, I'm stuck with the stiff!

611
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,270
Stay. Stay.

612
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,350
Guys, come here!
He's in here! Oh, shit.

613
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,940
- Come on, let's go.
- Faster, guys.

614
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,400
- Half the pepperoni was mine.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

615
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,780
Help! Help! Help! Guys!

616
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,950
- Come on, you idiots!
- Okay, Ma.

617
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,790
- I'll make sure it's safe.
- Shut up.

618
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,420
- Safe.
- Shut up and go.

619
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,040
Hurry up!

620
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,970
I'm not kidding! Look in the window!

621
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,730
I'll show you that piece that...

622
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,600
He says that all the time.
Watch your head, Ma.

623
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,900
- I can't find Chunk.
- Where's Chunk?

624
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,440
- Where's Chunk?
- Chunk's up there.

625
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,320
- Look at this piece over here.
- Leave it alone, Jake.

626
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,160
Ma, I don't want him to touch it.
I worked two hours on it...

627
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,500
- You worked one.
- Shut up!

628
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:37,540
Someone's been here. The cooler's
broken. Go check your brother.

629
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,920
- It could've been a tremor, Ma.
- I'll show you a tremor.

630
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:44,130
I'll go check the brother.

631
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,890
If he broke his chains,
I'm not getting any more from the zoo.

632
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,350
- Ma, just don't upset yourself.
- Hurry up!

633
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,310
Gesundheit.

634
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,190
I'm cold.

635
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,070
Chunk. Chunk, come here.

636
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,870
What are you doing down there?

637
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:13,700
Go get the police.

638
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,120
We're in serious shit here.
You gotta get the police.

639
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,790
Don't worry, I can do it.

640
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:21,250
Go, get out of here.

641
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,880
Watch it... Oh, the window.

642
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,390
- Did you see him, guys?
- Where's Chunk?

643
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,690
- He went to get the police.
- Go, the Fratellis are there.

644
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,770
He's getting the police. Move!

645
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,360
See, Ma?
There was nothing to worry about.

646
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:44,690
I knew he couldn't break them chains.

647
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,860
Get the body.

648
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,030
We've been walking forever.
How much further is it?

649
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,950
Mouth, you stepped on my foot.

650
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,750
Now I dropped my glasses.
I can't see a thing.

651
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,410
Oh, my God.

652
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,080
- I found your glasses. Sorry.
- You broke them.

653
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,170
You broke my glasses!

654
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,170
Listen, I'm the oldest,
so I'm in charge. First, we'll...

655
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,470
Data, do you have a light?

656
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,010
I said I was in charge.
Data, do you have a light?

657
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,430
Sure, guys. Back up, back up.

658
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,850
Bully Blinders!

659
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,270
- All right, Data... Ow!
- Isn't that neat?

660
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,240
One day I was walking home with it,
and two big guys stopped me...

661
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:31,370
Who is that? Oh, Stef, that's you.
Watch out. Data!

662
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:32,870
Come on, turn it off.

663
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:38,040
Oh, Data. The only problem is
the batteries don't last so long.

664
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:43,130
There's a light up ahead. Maybe we
can get out that way. Let's go.

665
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,260
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I like the dark. I love it.

666
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,630
But I hate nature. I hate nature!

667
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,640
Wait a sec! Hold it!

668
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,520
Stop! I'm just a kid!

669
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,270
- What seems to be the problem?
- Mister, I need a ride.

670
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,440
My friends and I had
a run-in with disgusting people.

671
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:09,400
You might've heard of them, the
Fratellis. We found their hideout.

672
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:14,620
Could you take me to the sheriff?
I can describe all three of them.

673
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,350
Will you...

674
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,190
What the hell? He's only a kid.
Can't you handle a kid, even?

675
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,900
- Does it work, guys?
- Yeah!

676
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:56,780
I can't see. Mouth, your father's
a plumber. What are these pipes?

677
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,870
These look like water pipes, guys.

678
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,750
Gas pipes.

679
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,590
Drainage. Maybe... Wait a minute.
Shut up for a minute!

680
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:11,260
These pipes must lead to a building
or something. A foundation.

681
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,470
So maybe if we bang on them hard
enough, if we make enough noise...

682
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,590
How are you, Duke?

683
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,760
- Hey, Gene, how are you?
- Great.

684
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,790
Reverse pressure!

685
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,470
Daddy!

686
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,630
- Let's...
- Get out of...

687
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,720
- Here!
- Like now!

688
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,930
Go, go, go!

689
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:04,490
First, we start with
the pudgy little fingers.

690
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,210
Then the plump little hands.

691
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:09,830
Then the fleshy arms.

692
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,920
Now, tell me where your friends are.

693
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,130
In the fireplace.

694
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,470
Don't lie to me!

695
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,340
Honestly. We found a map
over at Mikey's dad's place...

696
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,680
...that said there was
buried treasure under here.

697
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,640
Don't give us none of
your bullshit stories, huh?

698
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,150
Spill your guts. Tell us everything.

699
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,650
Everything?

700
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:33,190
Everything.

701
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,190
Okay, I'll talk.

702
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,860
In 3rd grade,
I cheated on my history exam.

703
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:44,700
In 4th grade, I stole my uncle's
toupee and glued it on my face...

704
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,290
...when I played Moses
in my Hebrew school play.

705
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:52,330
In 5th grade, I knocked my sister
down the stairs, and I blamed our dog.

706
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,800
Wait, I can't see a thing.
What am I stepping on?

707
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,010
Oh, brother.

708
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,050
Look, a lantern. Somebody must
have been here before us.

709
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,300
- Maybe they're still here.
- I hope not.

710
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,010
Look at these cigarettes.

711
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:16,070
Ten minutes ago, Troy was looking down
my shirt. Who cares? It's not wrong.

712
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,570
If I'd been smart,
he'd still be looking.

713
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,950
- Listen to her.
- What's wrong with her?

714
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,570
- Andy, it's okay.
- Is she all right?

715
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:32,370
I should've let him look at my body.
Don't I have a beautiful body?

716
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,130
You've got a great body.

717
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:38,170
How many years do I have before I
get fat? Before my hair falls out?

718
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,300
Before I look like him?

719
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:48,970
Then my mom sent me
to a summer camp for fat kids.

720
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:52,520
Then, once during lunch, I got nuts
and I pigged out...

721
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,060
...and they kicked me out!

722
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,280
- Look at him.
- Don't touch it, guys.

723
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,910
This is one of your tricks,
right, One-Eyed Willy?

724
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:11,580
You must be really hiding something
to go through all this trouble.

725
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:15,080
- There's nothing to worry about.
- You don't understand!

726
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,590
Don't be afraid.

727
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:23,430
He's dead for sure.
I think he's Chester Copperpot.

728
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,970
- Chester who?
- Who?

729
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,430
Don't you remember from the attic?
The news article?

730
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,140
The last guy to look
for the rich stuff...

731
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,310
...he went in,
but he never came back out.

732
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,560
That was back in 1935.

733
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:41,240
Oh, God. If he didn't make it out
and he was an expert, what about us?

734
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,950
How will we get out?

735
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,570
- Don't worry about it. Calm down.
- You sure?

736
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,280
- I'm positive.
- How will we get out?

737
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,490
We can't be sure it's him.

738
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,750
I know it's him.

739
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:55,040
I bet his I.D. Is in his wallet.
Mouth, get his wallet.

740
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,090
Lou Gehrig?

741
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,840
- You get it, Mikey!
- Mikey, get it.

742
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,310
It is Chester Copperpot.

743
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,940
- Oh, God. Come on.
- You see? I told you.

744
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,310
We're gonna get killed too.

745
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,310
Hey, look at this.

746
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,860
Candles.

747
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:27,030
- They're gonna kill us. We're dead.
- Where are you going?

748
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,740
- I'm setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

749
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:33,790
That's what I said. I'll set booby
traps in case anyone follows us...

750
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,290
...like the Fratellis.
We'll hear them coming.

751
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,170
- Okay, hurry up.
- Good idea.

752
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,630
- Where you going?
- To set booty traps.

753
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,590
- You mean booby traps.
- That's what I said. Booby traps!

754
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,680
God, these guys...

755
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,560
Guys, look. It looks like a skeleton
of One-Eyed Willy or something.

756
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,690
Give me that. Give me this thing.

757
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,030
Oh, God! There's no way out of here.

758
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,280
No, don't, don't, don't, Brandon.

759
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,660
Hey, guys, now that we've got...

760
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:19,000
Look at this. See what I found?

761
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,100
Guys, freeze. Don't move.

762
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,890
Don't move. You guys,
don't move back there! Don't move!

763
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,640
- What?
- Freeze!

764
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,270
Run, you guys, run!

765
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,780
Holy shit!

766
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,140
Man, that was close.

767
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,140
Wait, listen. Sounds like
somebody's down there.

768
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,200
Shut up and listen.

769
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,700
- Maybe it's a way out.
- Or the Fratellis.

770
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:36,700
- Or Chunk got the police.
- Or one of Willy's booby traps.

771
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,250
God put that rock there for a purpose.

772
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,750
I'm not so sure you should
move it or anything.

773
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:50,920
Hello?

774
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,010
Bats!

775
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,380
Save me! They're in my hair.

776
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,920
Help! Rabies! Rabies!

777
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,720
Rabies! We're gonna get rabies!

778
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:17,810
But the worst thing I ever done,
I mixed up fake puke at home...

779
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:22,600
...and I went to this movie theater,
hid the puke in my jacket...

780
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,440
...climbed up to the balcony...

781
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:28,530
...and then I made a noise like this...

782
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:40,370
And then I dumped it over the side...

783
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,710
...on all the people
in the audience. Then...

784
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,000
Then this was horrible.

785
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:50,760
All the people started getting sick
and throwing up on each other.

786
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:54,010
I never felt so bad in my entire life.

787
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,890
I'm beginning to like him, Ma.

788
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,600
Hit puree.

789
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,640
No, I'm too young!

790
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,100
No! I want to play the violin!

791
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,600
- Not my hand!
- Do I get the truth?

792
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:09,110
Do I get the truth,
or do you get juiced?

793
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:13,450
- What was that noise?
- Fireplace blew.

794
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:17,200
The kid's not kidding, Ma.
There's a tunnel down there.

795
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:21,870
Watch your hair!
They're going for the hair!

796
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,370
Watch your veins, Ma!

797
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:28,420
Hey, Mikey, if you can hear me, run!

798
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:29,800
Run! They're coming after you!

799
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:35,260
Hey, If we keep going this
far down, we'll reach China.

800
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:38,100
Maybe I can go see
my auntie or something.

801
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,470
This could get dangerous, Andy.

802
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,020
- You might want to hold my hand.
- Thank you.

803
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,480
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, neat!

804
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,400
- That's beautiful.
- Guys, look!

805
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:53,570
It's a beautiful waterfall!
