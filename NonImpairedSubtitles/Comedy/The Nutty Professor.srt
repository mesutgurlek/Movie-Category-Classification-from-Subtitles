They say everyone
should have one.

and going down and getting my
colon cleansed thoroughly.

You the one that brought up colon
cleansing and all that mess.

303
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,638
I did not say
anything about breaking gas!

304
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,973
I said that I was
gonna get my colon cleaned.

305
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,349
You can talk about putting
a tube in somebody's ass,

but I can't break wind.

I didn't say nothing about putting
a hose up nobody's ass...

I'll get down on my knees. I'll beg
you in front of all these people.

782

Think I care if these
people are watching?

783
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:25,478
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I want the
world to know that I was late!

784
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,648
And I'm sorry!
My car ran out of gas.

785
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,484
I needed fresh drawers.
My mother's sick.

786
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,860
The car broke down,
down the street.

I'm so sorry.
Hear me out. I am sorry!

789

I don't know why this
is happening tonight.

790
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,743
Of all nights, this has got
to happen to me tonight.

791
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,205
Why? Why?
Okay.

792
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,165
Okay!

793
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,209

Okay. Good. Let's eat.

and two servings
of creamed spinach.

I have never seen
anyone eat so much.

You are so lucky
to stay so thin.

802

Luck has
nothing to do with it.

I don't know. I'm trying to
sound extra intelligent.

What's UP, nigger?

817
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,979
I said, "What's up?"

Didn't you hear me
when I say, "Hey"?

Boy, women be shopping.

Oh, now, look at this white guy right here.
Look at him.

824
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:12,168
You cannot tell me
he ain't got a small jimmie.

825
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,588
Man, it's so small he needs
tweezers to take a piss.

826
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,673
He needs tweezers
to take a piss!

I had to give
myself the Heimlich.

You mind waiting for the
punch line first, brother?

839
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,250
I'm sorry, man. It's
just that you're so funny.

840
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,918
You're so funny
the way you take a person's

841

personal defects
and flip it around.

842
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,798

and say, "Look at your foot,"

and everybody look at
it and start laughing.

I'm glad you
appreciate Reggie's show.

That'd even work with me
doing it to you, Reggie.

849

Yes, it would. If I would say,
look at Reggie's gums and teeth.

850
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,900
Looks like his mother
had an affair with Mister Ed.

That was pretty.

942

Ladies and gentlemen,
Reggie has left the building.

thank you so much. Thank you.

please, come on now.

Hey, who pinched my ass? Cut it out.
That's good.

All right. Thank you.
Can you get the bill for me?

949
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,455
Thanks, man. Too much!

950
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,541
That was amazing.
I can't believe you did that.

Believe it, 'cause amazing
is my middle name.

was here to have seen it.

Listen.

This is our moment. I don't wanna
ruin it with talks of Sherman.

955
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:59,014
You know, your eyes, there's
something very familiar about them,

956
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,642
as if I already know you.

957
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,814
You know, I feel the exact same
way about you, Miss Purty.

Your lip.
What?

964
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,755
Your lip is swollen.
My lip?

965
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,549
Yes.

kind of lipstick do you have on?

Chanel Oh, yeah, that
happens every time

You caught me in the middle
of an experiment I was doing.

1004
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,600
I was trying to see how the
students would respond

1005
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,686
to a teacher-less
environment.

1006

Teacher-less environment?
New field of research for you?

1007
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,525
Yes, sir. Interesting.
Always thinking.

00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,026
That's good, Klump.
Let me know your results.

By the way, would you
mind explaining this?

Oh! Yeah, well,
my car's in the shop, so...

gonna get angry,

gonna start screaming

You remember him.

could save your entire research program.

Oh, yes.
Absolutely, yes, yes.

with him.

He wants to hear your grant
proposal personally.

Friday, the Ritz,
dinner, 8:00 sharp.

wonderful idea, sir. Absolutely.

I will not let you down.

You won't.
I know you won't.

and you're going to be great.

you're going to be perfect.

How's that?

1038
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,392
I know them because
if you're not perfect,

never mind the yelling and the
screaming and the firing.

reason, I'm going to kill you.

that as a euphemism.

literally kill you.

It's a complete
metabolic transformation.

1051
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,766
How did it happen?
Was it an accident?

1052
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,435
No, I did it
to myself, Jason.

1053
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,646
You did? Why?

1054
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:01,692
If it was for the grant, the data with
Shelley was already so compelling.

1055
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,404
Well, I have compelling
reasons of my own, Jason.

1056
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,532
I have a case of infatuation
of sorts with Miss Purty.

Professor, if you feel this way about
Carla, why don't you just tell her?

1058
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,830
It'd be a lot simpler
than transforming into...

are right off the charts.

Sir, you can't
control him.

Jason, you have no idea what it
feels like to be Buddy Love.

It's indescribable.
It's just wonderful!

him, and the way she looks at him.

But he's dangerous. He
almost killed us last night.

be concentrating on

have behaved like this before.

were going with you and Buddy.

I wish I knew.

1080

We had such a wonderful time.

And then all of a sudden,
he runs out of the club.

1082
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,287
He has some
allergic reaction.

1083

And I don't even
know if he's all right.

1084
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,832
He's fine. I spoke
to him this morning.

1085
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,084
He told me that his
lip swelled up,

1086
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,794
he put a little ice on it
and the swelling came down.

Kind of strange, huh?

1088
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,339
Well, did he even
ask about me?

1089
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,882
Did he say why
he didn't call me

1090
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,842
and let me know
he was all right?

1091
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,511
Carla, Buddy's kind of
unreliable.

1092
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:56,473
He's kind of what you call a "here
today, gone tomorrow" kind of fellow.

1093
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,225
Oh, I see.
Mmm-hmm.

1094
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:02,354
So he had you talk to me because
he's not interested anymore.

1095
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,439
No, it's nothing quite like that.
Look.

1096
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:05,732
Sherman,
I know what it feels like

1097
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,693
to be brushed off,
and it's okay.

1098
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,987
Carla, I feel like
this is all my fault.

1099
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,656
I feel like I should've never
encouraged you to go out with Buddy.

1100
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,117
Sherman,
you have been so sweet.

1101
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:19,287
I'll just have to forget about him.
I'll see you later.

1102

1103
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,419
I was wondering if

1104
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,380
I could talk to you about
you and I, for a second.

1105
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,424
I was...

1106
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,219
I was wondering what
you were doing later,

1107
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,222
'cause the family
gonna get together.

1108
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,307
She made a meal

1109
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,144
and we gonna be eating,
so I figured if

1110

you not doing
anything for dinner,

1111
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:47,649
I know we'd love to have you, if
you want to come over for dinner.

1112
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,485
We'd love to have
you over for dinner.

1113
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,405

1114
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,823
Would you, now?

1115
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,033
Yes, I would.

1116
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:58,160
Should we call and make sure
there's going to be enough food?

1117
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,496
I don't think that's
going to be a problem.

1121
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,504
So,Carla, where are you from?
Chicago.

That's a good question.

will you hush up?

He's never
brought a girl home.

1142
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,876
The least you can do
is let us talk to her.

1143
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,420
Yeah, I'd like to get to know
her a little better myself.

1144

Ain't nothing wrong with having relations.
Don't be ashamed of that.

Relations is beautiful.

1146
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,344
When I was young, I used
to always have relations.

1147
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:01,973
Every night, if a nice gentleman
bring me flowers and candy,

take me to a movie,
show me a lovely evening,

1149

then I would take him home and
give him hot, lovely relations.

1150
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,984
Relations is a beautiful thing.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:38,594
Here's an idea.

1537
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:39,637
Find him!

1538
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,930
Yes, sir.

1539
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,556
Harlan.
Well, Richmond.

1540
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,766
Where's your
Professor Buddy Love?

1541
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:45,017
With you,
it's always business.

1542
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:48,020
Let's get to know each other man-to-man.
Now, if our files are correct,

1543
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:50,397
you and your fabulous wife
have a terrific daughter.

1544
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,650
I'm divorced, and my
daughter is in rehab.

1545
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,819
So you're saying our
files are not correct.

1546
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:56,987
Listen,
you pompous butt-kisser.

1547
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:59,156
I have a check in my
pocket for $10 million.

1548
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,076
And your Buddy Love has till midnight
to prove that formula works.

1549
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,620
He'll be here, the formula
works and you have the check.

1550
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:07,039
Really? On you now? Because on behalf of...
Which pocket?

1551
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,667
No, don't tell me.
Let me smell it. Punch?

1552
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:12,169
Oh, come on, now.
Look at this.

1553
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,380
I can't eat this.
This stuff is too tiny.

1554
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,756
I can't get
full off this mess!

1555
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:18,551
I think it's wonderful, all the
precious little finger foods.

1556
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,094
Finger food?
I got a finger for them.

1557
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:21,971
I ain't paid no $100
ticket for no finger food.

1558
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,431
I could go down to Subway,
get me a sandwich for $3.

1559
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,976
I gotta pay a $100 ticket for
some finger food? Hungry as I am?

1560
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,644
You must be crazy
to think I'm gonna eat this...

1561
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:29,895
Please. You're getting
on my damn nerves!

rm hungry! u up!

she's seen Sherman. Carla!

01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:35,609

1567
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,117
Thank you, Mrs. Klump.

1568
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:45,202
Have you seen Sherman? PAPA:
Yeah, where's Sherman at?

1569
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:47,663
I ain't come to pay no $100 ticket
to have to suffer this alone.

1570
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:48,914
Cletus, shut up, please!

1571
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,333
Hey! That's strike two.

1572
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,170
I don't think Sherman
will be coming tonight.

1573
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,380
Yes, he is. Sherman called me and
told me to make sure we was here,

1574
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:57,923
'cause he got a big announcement
to make or something.

1575
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,551
Something about getting
it all off his chest.

1576
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:01,886
Have you noticed
that Sherman's

1577
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:03,220
been acting kind
of strange lately?

1578
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:05,806
Sherman has definitely
been acting strange lately.

1579
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:08,100
I knew it!
See, Cletus? I told you.

1580
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:10,978
You really think I be listening to you.
I ain't listening to you!

1581
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,647
Well, Mrs. Klump, I hope you
have a wonderful evening.

1582
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:17,234
Oh, you do the same. Thank you so much.
So precious.

1583
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:19,320

1585
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:22,907
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1586
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,950
Fabulous.

1587
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,202
You know, Cletus,
I think something's

1588
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,828
going on between
her and Sherman.

1589
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:30,206
You don't go get up in Sherman's business.
That's Sherman's business.

1590
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:32,875
Sherman's business? That's my business.
Sherman is my baby.

1591
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,085
Sherman's 35 years old! What you
talking about he's your baby?

1592
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:36,879
Cletus, I don't wanna hear it.
Shut up, please!

1593
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,547
Carla! That's strike
three, damn it!

1594
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,633
Don't you walk away
from me, God damn it!

(MUTTERING)

1596
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:43,719
Hey, this is
the last of it, Professor.

1597
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,387
I'll tell you this,
Jason,

1598
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:48,432
if I'm gonna change my life, it's not
gonna come from some magic: drink.

1599
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,559
Gotta come from
a lot of hard work,

1600
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,770
and exercise and
plenty of these.

1601
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:55,522
Good bye, Buddy Love.
Hello, Megashake.

in 30 seconds!

Thanks, Megashake!

1608
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,126
You tricked him!

1609
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:18,837
You damn right, hamster boy. I knew
Sherman was gonna go soft on me.

1610
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:21,215
That can wreak havoc
on a man's sex life.

1611
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,800
(LAUGHING)

1612
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,426
See, I've done some
calculations of my own.

1613
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:26,136
If I drink 500
milliliters of formula,

1614
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,388
I'll have enough
cellular stability

1615
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:28,639
to be rid of
Sherman's ass forever!

1616
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,141
No, you drink that much formula at
one time, and it will kill you!

1617
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:32,893
If I drink it all at once,
yes. If I drink half now

1618
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,687
and half later,
that's completely safe.

1619
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,771
At midnight,
I don't have to worry

1620
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:36,855
about turning
into no Klumpkin.

1621
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,191
Now if you don't mind, I have
a date at the alumni ball,

1622
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:40,317
and you have
a date with linoleum.

1623

(MAMA KLUMP LAUGHS)

1625
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:50,786
No, no, no, child. Not a wild party.
Not Sherman.

1626
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,871
He's too shy for something like that.
He hates parties.

1627
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:56,125
In fact, we tried to have a party for
Sherman when he was 18 years old,

1628
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,419
and he's so shy,
he didn't even show up.

1629
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,047
Well, I must admit, it didn't
seem like the Sherman I know.

1630
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,215
Oh, no, not my baby.

1631
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,800
Maybe he loaned his house
out to somebody or something,

1632
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,176
or one of his buddies
was throwing a party.

that as a euphemism.

literally kill you.
