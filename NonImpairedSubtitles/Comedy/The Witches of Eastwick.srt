1
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:52,165
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

2
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:56,129
I want to,
but I have a million things to do first.

3
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:04,766
Mom, what's this?

4
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:08,122
-Peanut butter.
-Peanut butter and what?

5
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:09,932
Peanut butter and jelly.

6
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:12,208
What kind of jelly?

7
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:13,881
Zucchini jelly.

8
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:08,162
How we doing?

9
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:10,448
We're doing fine, Walter. Just fine.

10
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,893
I wish we could afford
to keep you full time.

11
00:03:14,213 --> 00:03:16,283
So do l, especially now.

12
00:03:17,373 --> 00:03:19,568
Is the divorce final yet?

13
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:22,363
Yes, today. Thank you.

14
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:27,644
Let's put our heads together and
maybe we can work something out.

15
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:40,287
Horns up.

16
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:43,492
One, two, three, four....

17
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:45,802
We appreciate your taking the time
to be here with us today.

18
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:49,607
A big hand for our most
prominent selectman...

19
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:53,846
...or selectwoman or selectperson,
Felicia Alden.

20
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:58,723
Thank you, children and Miss Spofford.

21
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:01,771
I can see we have our work cut out for us?

22
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,885
In these days of disintegrating values...

23
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,285
...and lost mores...

24
00:05:15,653 --> 00:05:18,292
...when our children are exposed daily...

25
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:23,242
...to the hazards of divorce,
separation and families torn asunder...

26
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:26,766
...it's comforting to think back
to the days...

27
00:05:26,813 --> 00:05:30,010
...when a family like the Lenox family
strove together.

28
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:33,762
The values of that time,
embodied in a man like Major Lenox....

29
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:37,688
They were men
who labored all their lives...

30
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:42,125
...so their children would be well-fed,
clothed and educated.

31
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,401
The families went through
great hardship...

32
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,004
...yet kept their honor...

33
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,052
...their dignity and their faith in God.

34
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:58,006
We are the same people;
the same body, the soul...

35
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,962
...the hands and the feet of our fathers...

36
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:06,330
...fighting the wars of modern vice.

37
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:09,691
What was it that tied
these people together?

38
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:12,083
What was it that made them...

39
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,122
...not a loose gathering of individuals,
but a single bond?

40
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:17,402
That bond...

41
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:21,566
...that held them together,
as it holds us together today.

42
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:24,533
That bond that has stood every test...

43
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:27,443
...is found deep in our consciousness.

44
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:30,173
An abiding love of liberty.

45
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:34,365
For love of liberty, our forbears...

46
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:38,168
...colonists few in number
and with little to defend themselves...

47
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:41,087
...fought the war for independence...

48
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:45,122
...what was then the world's
most powerful empire.

49
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:47,406
For love of liberty...

50
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:50,485
...those who came before us
tamed a vast wilderness...

51
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:52,404
...and braved hardships...

52
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,405
...tamed a vast wilderness
and braved hardships...

53
00:06:57,493 --> 00:07:00,246
...which at times were beyond the limit--

54
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:08,889
Braved hardships, which at times were
beyond the limit of human endurance.

55
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:22,692
Come on. Go with your mom. Go on.

56
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:30,329
Liberty must not be taken for granted.
We thank God for our blessings....

57
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,364
Do you believe it's raining?

58
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,602
Duh!

59
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,371
I mean, since this morning.

60
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:11,681
At least it shut Walter up.

61
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:14,492
The same boring, sanctimonious speech.

62
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:19,808
I thought he'd go on forever.
I was praying for something to happen.

63
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:22,612
-I was thinking the exact same thing.
-You were?

64
00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:27,444
I was thinking we're all wet and
how nice it would be to just leave.

65
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:31,332
And then it rained.

66
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:35,406
-He's a liar and a lech and he deserved it.
-I'm not talking about Walter.

67
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:38,244
Don't you think it's strange that we were--

68
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,484
We're thinking the same thing
at the same time? So what?

69
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:43,809
It won't get us on David Letterman.

70
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:45,526
Let's have a drink.

71
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:48,412
Good idea, Janey, party-baby!

72
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,483
He made a pass at me last week, too.

73
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:08,005
I can't stand to think about it.

74
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,527
Be prepared. He does not give up easily.

75
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:14,447
It was broad daylight and his wife
was standing ten feet away!

76
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:15,682
Poor woman.

77
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:20,045
Poor woman, my ass. Why does she
put up with it? The man is a Nazi.

78
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:24,202
Do you think they still...you know?

79
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:25,647
-Yes.
-Really.

80
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:28,923
I hope his dick is bigger than his l.Q.

81
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:31,607
-Once a week. He told me.
-He told you.

82
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:34,447
Otherwise she starts throwing things.

83
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:37,081
At least someone's getting
something once a week.

84
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:38,526
Yes, heartburn.

85
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:42,766
I keep forgetting
how many calories are in these.

86
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,082
Two minutes on the lips...

87
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:46,129
...forever on the love handles.

88
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:52,970
And congratulations.

89
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:55,048
Thank you.

90
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:57,522
Oh, God, I forgot. Your divorce.

91
00:09:57,653 --> 00:09:59,928
As of today, I'm a free woman.

92
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,971
-Join the club.
-Thanks.

93
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:06,287
Here I go again.

94
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:09,882
It's over, honey. You'll be okay.

95
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:13,212
It's a beginning, not an ending.
Right, Alex?

96
00:10:13,573 --> 00:10:16,041
Besides, we still have each other.

97
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,169
Have some more martooni.

98
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:20,650
-Did you bring the cards?
-Was I supposed to?

99
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:23,930
-I have them.
-Okay, come on ladies, let's do it!

100
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,961
I feel like I'm being unfaithful...

101
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:32,083
...even if I just...think about it.

102
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:37,171
Monty deserted you
and left you with five kids.

103
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,251
-Six.
-Don't start, Alex.

104
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:42,291
Her husband left
'cause she has too many kids.

105
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:43,328
That's his problem.

106
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:44,641
You're oversimplifying.

107
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:46,325
Yours left 'cause you can't have any.

108
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,483
You are definitely oversimplifying.

109
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:50,172
That's not the point.

110
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:52,523
What I'm saying is that it's not your fault.

111
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:55,764
That doesn't matter.
It's just not that easy.

112
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:58,606
We're too young to lock it up
and throw away the key.

113
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,126
It's not natural.

114
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,809
What are we doing with ourselves?

115
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:05,846
Look, Ozzie's dead. I loved him.
He's dead.

116
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:09,961
So I spend Thursday nights
with you two the rest of my life?

117
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:13,562
I like our Thursday nights.
It's the only time I can relax.

118
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:17,363
Sure: quilting, macramé.
What did we do last Thursday night?

119
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,364
Chinese aphrodisiac cooking.

120
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:22,367
Stimulating.
We're not relaxing, we're hiding.

121
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:24,450
-What from?
-Walter Neff.

122
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:27,570
Fuck Walter Neff.
I'm not talking about him.

123
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:33,045
All right, who should we be looking for?

124
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,526
Somebody nice. Somebody you could like.

125
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:39,003
Somebody with a brain.
Somebody you could talk to.

126
00:11:39,093 --> 00:11:41,527
Somebody you could
really be yourself with.

127
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:44,207
Someone to watch

128
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:47,130
Over me.

129
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:50,247
All right, I've had it with you two.

130
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,332
He would definitely have to be
from out of town.

131
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,888
Especially considering what's in town.

132
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:02,812
A stranger. That would be interesting.

133
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:06,645
A tall, dark prince traveling under a curse.

134
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:08,446
In Eastwick?

135
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,366
Romantic.

136
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:13,525
A foreign prince on a big, black horse.

137
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:20,443
If we're going to have it...

138
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,925
...let's have it all.

139
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:35,843
Handsome.
He should be really handsome.

140
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,332
Not too handsome.

141
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:38,807
Nice eyes.

142
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,048
Nice ass.

143
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,166
Huge.

144
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:56,972
I prefer small.

145
00:12:58,213 --> 00:12:59,805
Aesthetically, I prefer small.

146
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:03,647
Sam was huge and there were times
when I could not face it.

147
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:06,122
I'm in the middle myself.

148
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:08,807
But who cares? As long as it works, it's in.

149
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:38,726
It's a nice thought,
but wishing for it won't make it happen.

150
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,967
Men are not the answer to everything.

151
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:50,004
So why do we always end up
talking about them?

152
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:21,206
I said, some man bought
the Lenox mansion.

153
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:25,045
Did you hear me?

154
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:26,971
Yeah. Who is he?

155
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:30,046
He's from New York, no wife, no family.

156
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:34,008
He told the realtors he needed
all that room for his pianos.

157
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,489
Apparently, he had a lot of pianos.

158
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:39,161
How many pianos can one guy have?

159
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:42,968
Don't you think it's kind of...
strange and funny?

160
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:44,812
What's his name?

161
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,922
You know, that's strange, too.

162
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:51,444
What's strange about his name?

163
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:54,764
They told me his name
for the column and I forgot it.

164
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:57,731
So I called back and it's gone again.

165
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,408
It's not like me to forget a name.

166
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,410
It's the big news of the day...

167
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:07,372
...considering the history of the place.
I wonder if he knows.

168
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:08,721
I don't know.

169
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,924
Is that Clyde and Felicia?

170
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,329
I have the culinary piece.

171
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:26,209
"Cheeseburger pie"?
ls your column finished?

172
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:31,130
Here's the track meet, births and
deaths, the senior citizens' news.

173
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:35,805
The toxic waste article
should be done this afternoon.

174
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:37,452
This pie looks good.

175
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:40,127
Did you hear someone bought
the Lenox mansion.

176
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:56,968
The house is landmark building.
They have no right to sell it.

177
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:59,602
I can't do anything about that.

178
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,686
You're too busy...

179
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:06,048
...reporting on the horse trough...

180
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:08,607
...and Herbie Prescott's trip to Bermuda.

181
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:13,811
What's going to happen
to those birds now? Tell me that.

182
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,964
-What birds?
-The snowy egrets.

183
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:19,086
Where will they nest?

184
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:20,401
I don't know.

185
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:23,042
Exactly.

186
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:26,330
Felicia, what's the matter?

187
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,448
It's only a house. Why are you so upset?

188
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,046
I have a feeling.

189
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,324
The most terrible feeling.

190
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:38,811
Something is happening. Something evil.

191
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:49,212
I'm just glad they're selling.
I was starting to think--

192
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:51,932
They're not selling, they sold.
Just like that.

193
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:53,527
I don't understand.

194
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:57,925
You know I adore the little creatures.
So unreal, and yet the detail.

195
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:02,883
Little fingers and toes, little pudenda
making a bump. So sweet.

196
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:06,569
But nobody's even looked
at them sideways in months.

197
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,451
Then this morning...

198
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:12,328
...this man appeared
out of absolutely nowhere.

199
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:16,571
So charming.
Not really handsome, but...riveting.

200
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:20,329
That's it. I was riveted.
I looked into his eyes...

201
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,204
...and had thoughts I hadn't entertained
since World War ll.

202
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,329
I actually...blushed.

203
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:27,523
Can you imagine?

204
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,843
No, I mean, yeah. So he bought one?

205
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:32,802
He bought all of them. Every single one.

206
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:34,612
So who was he? A tourist?

207
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:38,083
No, he just bought the Lenox house.
He's moving in.

208
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:40,645
Do you remember his name?

209
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,531
Of course. His name is....

210
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,166
He told me.

211
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,565
I wrote it down.

212
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:52,728
It was...

213
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:54,521
...foreign.

214
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:57,286
It sounded, uh....

215
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,968
It's right on the tip of my tongue,
but I can't....

216
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,005
Isn't that diabolical?

217
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:00,805
What is that noise?

218
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,651
I don't know.

219
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:05,570
Bravis!

220
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:16,284
He bought all of them?

221
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,131
-And now he's here.
-Making goo-goo eyes at Jane.

222
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:21,562
And the interview, too. How weird.

223
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:25,527
Didn't I tell you?
Oh, it was after we talked.

224
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:28,810
The paper called him
and asked to interview him--

225
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:32,163
About the house renovation and all.

226
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:35,250
He said he'd love to be interviewed
and asked for me.

227
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,086
I don't know why he wants me
to do the interview.

228
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,841
-Who is he?
-He must have a name.

229
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:43,685
I just can't remember it.

230
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,605
Why would he ask for you?

231
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:50,045
Because I'm good at it.
You act like I'm so stupid.

232
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,325
He was in my shop.

233
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:55,810
You're not stupid. But how does he know
who Sukie Ridgemont is?

234
00:20:55,893 --> 00:20:57,042
I don't know.

235
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,052
He bought the Lenox estate just like that.

236
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:03,173
He has some kind of a foreign name.

237
00:21:03,573 --> 00:21:05,643
Van something or other.

238
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:12,325
How sweet.

239
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:15,372
They're from him. With a personal note.

240
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:17,168
Just "D."

241
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:18,971
Yeah, it starts with a "D."

242
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:19,963
David?

243
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:23,131
No. It has an "R" in it.

244
00:21:23,253 --> 00:21:24,288
Doberman?

245
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:26,001
-Drake?
-Darren.

246
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:29,563
It's "D" something, "R" something, "L."
Daryl!

247
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:33,521
Van Horne.

248
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:35,366
Daryl Van Horne.

249
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:37,604
What kind of a name is that?

250
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:01,725
Oh, Clyde, honey.

251
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:04,964
I think I broke my leg.

252
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:57,125
Looking for me?

253
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:03,845
Are you looking for me?
Or is this just a happy coincidence?

254
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,562
-Actually, I was--
-Just looking.

255
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:08,963
Well, too bad.

256
00:23:09,293 --> 00:23:12,569
Have you seen any snowy egrets out here?

257
00:23:13,773 --> 00:23:15,047
Neither have l.

258
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:19,969
Not that I'd know a snowy egret if I was
pissing on one. You want some lunch?

259
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,522
I think it's a little late in the season.

260
00:23:25,293 --> 00:23:26,203
For lunch?

261
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:27,806
For pissing on birds.

262
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:39,407
The local sculptress. The one who makes...

263
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,285
...the booby dolls.

264
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:43,126
They're just little--

265
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:45,967
But...potent. Full of juice.

266
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:51,209
Potent. You can feel it
when you pick them up.

267
00:23:51,373 --> 00:23:53,329
I sent a couple to New York.

268
00:23:53,413 --> 00:23:56,883
I have a friend down there. Terrific fellow.

269
00:23:57,133 --> 00:24:00,330
He has a gallery.
I wanted to hear his opinion.

270
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:03,531
Of course the scale is wrong. Get bigger.

271
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:06,332
Let yourself go. Get some size into it.

272
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:11,448
Do you like fish?
We're having fish for lunch.

273
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:31,846
Interesting, huh?

274
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:35,364
Fidel, that's his name.

275
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:38,452
Women love him. They're crazy about him.

276
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:41,283
He has a big schlong.

277
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:42,569
Huge.

278
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:45,850
Well, there you are. Scale again. Size.

279
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:49,133
Who knows, maybe it's a masculine thing.

280
00:24:49,173 --> 00:24:53,883
They say women don't care.
I'm in the middle myself. How about you?

281
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:56,565
How about me, what?

282
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:59,850
See, women are in touch
with different things.

283
00:25:00,093 --> 00:25:04,723
That's my opinion. It's not
a fashionable one right now, but fuck it!

284
00:25:06,653 --> 00:25:09,531
I see men running around,
putting their dicks...

285
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,486
...into everything,
trying to make something happen.

286
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:16,407
But it's women who are the source,
the only power.

287
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:19,123
Nature. Birth. Rebirth.

288
00:25:19,493 --> 00:25:21,404
Cliché. Cliché.

289
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:23,804
Sure. But true.

290
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:26,484
Why are you telling me this?

291
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:30,650
You're an honest woman.
I'm being honest with you.

292
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:33,373
I like women. I admire them.

293
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:38,405
But if you want me to treat you
like a dumb twit, I will.

294
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:40,883
But what for? You have brains.

295
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:45,528
More than brains. But you don't know it.
Most women don't.

296
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:47,772
Are you married?

297
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:49,047
Good question!

298
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:51,163
You see? Brains.

299
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:54,731
The answer is no. I don't believe in it.

300
00:25:54,893 --> 00:25:57,453
Good for the man. Lousy for the woman.

301
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:01,687
She dies. She suffocates. I've seen it.

302
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:05,687
Then the husband complains to everyone
that he's fucking a dead person.

303
00:26:06,053 --> 00:26:08,089
And he's the one who killed her.

304
00:26:10,573 --> 00:26:12,484
-Where is your husband?
-Dead.

305
00:26:12,813 --> 00:26:15,850
Sorry, but you're one of the lucky ones.

306
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:20,166
When a woman unloads a husband
or a husband unloads a woman...

307
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:24,008
...however it happens:
death, desertion, divorce....

308
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:28,886
When that happens, a woman blooms.
She blossoms.

309
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:32,372
Like flowers. Like fruit.

310
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:34,287
She is ripe.

311
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:37,483
That's the woman for me.

312
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:47,203
Would you like to see my house?

313
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:53,123
In case anybody ever...

314
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:55,363
...needed any exercise...

315
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:59,528
...the pool is right over there,
past the piano...

316
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:01,962
...where the ballroom used to be.

317
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,643
Interesting word..."ballroom."

318
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,327
It's one of my favorites.

319
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:08,324
Over there is, uh...

320
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,725
...my study.

321
00:27:15,853 --> 00:27:18,413
-This is my bedroom.
-Yes, it is.

322
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:21,042
The Borgias once owned the bed.

323
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:26,405
Of course, you have to pay for it
with your soul, but...

324
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:29,606
...what the hell, I deserve a little luxury.

325
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:32,163
You have to take care of yourself.

326
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:34,852
No one will do that for you, will they?

327
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,409
What do you think you're doing?

328
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:50,245
Being as direct with you as I know how.
I thought you'd appreciate it.

329
00:27:52,413 --> 00:27:55,928
I always like a little pussy after lunch.
What do you say?

330
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,924
Are you trying to seduce me?

331
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:03,688
I wouldn't dream of seducing you,
Alexandra.

332
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:06,083
I wouldn't insult your intelligence...

333
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:09,290
...with anything as trivial as seduction.

334
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:12,811
But, I would love to fuck you.

335
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:21,082
I have to admit that I appreciate
your directness, Daryl.

336
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:23,132
I will try to be as direct...

337
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:25,568
...and honest with you as I possibly can be.

338
00:28:25,653 --> 00:28:26,768
I think....

339
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:32,563
No, I am positive that you are the most
unattractive man I have ever met...

340
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,292
...in my entire life.

341
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:39,367
This afternoon, you have demonstrated
every loathsome characteristic...

342
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:42,365
...of the male personality
and even discovered some new ones.

343
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:45,570
You are physically repulsive,
intellectually retarded...

344
00:28:45,853 --> 00:28:50,483
...morally reprehensible, vulgar,
insensitive, selfish, stupid.

345
00:28:50,773 --> 00:28:53,810
You have no taste,
no sense of humor and you smell.

346
00:28:54,253 --> 00:28:57,131
You're not even interesting enough
to make me sick.

347
00:28:59,853 --> 00:29:02,731
Would you like to be
on top or the bottom?

348
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,690
Good-bye Daryl,
and thank you for a lovely lunch.

349
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:10,732
If that's the way you feel about it...

350
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:13,328
...that's the way you feel about it.

351
00:29:13,613 --> 00:29:15,683
Is that the way you feel about it?

352
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:23,081
Who are you?

353
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:26,172
Just your...

354
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:28,643
...average horny little devil.

355
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:31,732
I have to get home.

356
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,722
What have you got to go home to?

357
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:37,202
There isn't anybody there, is there?

358
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:39,843
The kid will take care of herself.

359
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:44,167
She'll eat and fall asleep
on the bed doing homework.

360
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:46,085
I promise.

361
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:48,645
And house cleaning.

362
00:29:48,973 --> 00:29:52,488
You clean up the dirt,
there's just more dirt tomorrow.

363
00:29:52,813 --> 00:29:56,010
Make the beds,
they just have to be made tomorrow.

364
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:59,130
Wash the dishes.
There's more to wash tomorrow.

365
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:01,484
-I have to make--
-Make dinner?

366
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:03,365
It just gets eaten.

367
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:05,524
You've done your best, Alex.

368
00:30:05,773 --> 00:30:09,448
You've done the wife bit,
the motherhood bit.

369
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:12,530
The car pools, the vegetable garden...

370
00:30:12,973 --> 00:30:16,010
...needlepoint, the macramé potholders...

371
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:19,285
...a cup of coffee with a neighbor
in the morning...

372
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:23,368
...a couple of drinks, a couple of pills...

373
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:26,163
...a little psychoanalysis....

374
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:28,965
Where are you now, Alex?

375
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:31,853
Exactly where I want to be
and I'm doing fine.

376
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:36,603
Pretending to be somebody else...
to be half of what you are.

377
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:39,522
How long can you last like that?

378
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,131
The world keeps growing, and you feed it.

379
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:45,849
But it doesn't feed you, does it?

380
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:49,323
It washes through you,
down the drain, wasted.

381
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:52,373
A woman is a hole,
isn't that what they say?

382
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:56,009
All the futility of the world
pouring into her.

383
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:03,046
How much can you take, Alex?
How much can you take...

384
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:05,125
...before you snap?

385
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:10,409
Lying on your bed, looking at the ceiling...

386
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:12,490
...waiting for something to happen.

387
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:17,044
And knowing all the time you
were meant for something better.

388
00:31:17,613 --> 00:31:19,205
Feeling it.

389
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:20,885
Wanting it.

390
00:31:22,133 --> 00:31:23,771
Use me, Alex.

391
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:26,087
Use me.

392
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:28,803
Fill me up. I can take it.

393
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:31,402
Make it happen. Don't wait.

394
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:34,085
Time is the killer.

395
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:36,491
Make it happen.

396
00:31:37,453 --> 00:31:39,205
Do it, Alex.

397
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:41,126
Do it now.

398
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:39,204
You sit there in that...

399
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:42,642
...pathetic excuse of an office...

400
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:46,085
...reporting gossip...

401
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:51,963
...while under your very nose...

402
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:54,087
...evil...

403
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:57,124
...is doing its worst.

404
00:33:01,453 --> 00:33:03,205
You have no spine, Clyde.

405
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:07,123
Not one ounce...

406
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:08,961
...of morality.

407
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:11,367
Christ!

408
00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:13,764
Even common sense.

409
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:17,651
Nuclear holocaust.

410
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:19,207
Murder.

411
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,568
Rape. Apartheid!

412
00:33:22,893 --> 00:33:25,453
Why, these words mean nothing to you.

413
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:29,284
It's just a local newspaper.

414
00:33:29,613 --> 00:33:31,365
It is local turpitude.

415
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:35,446
You are a failure, Clyde!
You should be strung up...

416
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:38,565
...along with that son of a bitch
who bought that house!

417
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:43,203
Call the nurse!

418
00:33:51,653 --> 00:33:52,972
I am in pain!

419
00:33:53,453 --> 00:33:56,172
-Then take the pill.
-I don't want to.

420
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,722
I'm not going to force it on you.

421
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:01,804
Is it Alzheimer's?

422
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:06,252
It's the bone marrow.
When a bone breaks...

423
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:10,885
...bits of fat get in the bloodstream
and the blood vessels of the brain.

424
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:12,851
It affects the behavior.

425
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:17,131
She's hysterical. She says things that
I don't know where they're coming from.

426
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,402
It's the bone marrow?

427
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:22,532
Yes. She'll be very upset.
She'll say terrible things.

428
00:34:23,053 --> 00:34:25,203
She may even be paranoid.

429
00:34:25,293 --> 00:34:28,012
It is perfectly normal. It will pass.

430
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:47,844
What's happening to me, Clyde?

431
00:34:48,013 --> 00:34:49,765
It's all right, sweetheart.

432
00:34:52,973 --> 00:34:56,010
I open my mouth
and the strangest things come out.

433
00:34:57,853 --> 00:35:02,165
You've had a hard time and you're tired.
Try to sleep.

434
00:35:16,453 --> 00:35:18,683
Something is inside me, Clyde.

435
00:35:21,173 --> 00:35:23,562
Something is crawling inside me.

436
00:35:25,013 --> 00:35:26,207
I can feel it.

437
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:27,647
Something evil.

438
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:30,525
It's almost here.

439
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:35,291
You!

440
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:37,086
In there!

441
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:34,845
At last we meet.

442
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:37,245
Daryl Van Horne.

443
00:36:49,253 --> 00:36:50,527
Cream and sugar?

444
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:51,961
Sugar.

445
00:36:52,653 --> 00:36:54,883
-One lump or two?
-Four.

446
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,923
-Sweet tooth.
-Sweet everything.

447
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:02,046
I'm a sugar junkie.
Sugar, chocolate, Coca-Cola....

448
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:06,408
Uncontrollable appetite...
in every department.

449
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:10,371
That's not good for you.

450
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:16,485
It doesn't bother me.

451
00:37:16,813 --> 00:37:20,169
I have a supernatural constitution.
It's genetic.

452
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:23,492
I don't hold on
this health consciousness shit.

453
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:25,286
Pardon the language.

454
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:27,125
I see guys, 60...

455
00:37:27,493 --> 00:37:29,563
...70, breaking their balls...

456
00:37:30,253 --> 00:37:32,483
...to stay fit. What for?

457
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:35,646
When I die, I want to be sick, not healthy.

458
00:37:36,493 --> 00:37:39,212
I suppose that's one way of looking at it.

459
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:43,481
Do I make you nervous?

460
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:44,847
Yes, you do!

461
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:47,682
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.

462
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:50,565
Truth is best.

463
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:53,125
Yes, that's so true.

464
00:38:04,813 --> 00:38:06,724
So what brings you to Eastwick?

465
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:11,761
We're going to have a polite conversation.

466
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:13,088
I'm sorry.

467
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,885
No, I don't mind.

468
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:18,528
I came to Eastwick
because I was drawn here.

469
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:22,093
I needed a place to settle down and...

470
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:24,931
...l liked the house.

471
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:27,332
It has a history.

472
00:38:28,293 --> 00:38:29,248
Rubbish.

473
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:31,365
No, it's true.

474
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:35,052
They say they used to burn witches there.

475
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:38,085
Hocus pocus.

476
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:40,484
The entire witchcraft scare...

477
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:45,569
...as far back as the 14th century,
was started by the medical profession.

478
00:38:47,453 --> 00:38:48,966
They were trying to get the midwives...

479
00:38:49,053 --> 00:38:51,283
...out of the childbirthing business.

480
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:55,685
That's what most of the women
they burned were. Midwives.

481
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:57,487
Is that true?

482
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:00,005
You better believe it.

483
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:04,325
Just another example of male-dominated
professional society...

484
00:39:04,613 --> 00:39:08,606
...exploiting females
for their own selfish purposes.

485
00:39:09,453 --> 00:39:11,967
Men are such cocksuckers, aren't they?

486
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:17,771
You don't have to answer that. It's true.

487
00:39:18,373 --> 00:39:20,603
Their dicks get limp...

488
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:23,645
...when confronted by a powerful woman,
so what do they do?

489
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:26,531
Call them witches.
Burn them, torture them...

490
00:39:26,893 --> 00:39:30,249
...until every woman is afraid.
Afraid of herself...

491
00:39:31,373 --> 00:39:33,125
...afraid of men.

492
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:35,205
And all for what?

493
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:38,683
Fear of losing their hard-on.

494
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,731
Let's play some music.

495
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:22,564
You play beautifully.

496
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:25,443
Nothing compared to you.

497
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:27,525
You're an artist.

498
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:28,967
Intonation.

499
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:31,489
Vibrato. Stretch.

500
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,891
You think I'm crazy, but I know music.

501
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:38,011
It's the one thing that makes me humble.

502
00:40:38,573 --> 00:40:41,610
Not prissy?
Our leader says my intonation is prissy.

503
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:43,604
You have precision.

504
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:49,244
Precision is not prissy.
Precision is the foundation of passion.

505
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:52,611
Passion without precision...chaos.

506
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:56,888
Look at your thumb.
Your sublime thumb position.

507
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:59,363
You really keep the pressure on.

508
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:01,763
Most men can't, but you....

509
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:05,052
You have the most beautiful callus.

510
00:41:06,093 --> 00:41:07,685
This hand....

511
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:12,649
This is your failure. Your bowing sucks.

512
00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:16,005
My bowing? Why?

513
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:22,647
Your spiccato sounds like marcato.
Your legato like détaché.

514
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:27,205
You kill the passion. Let it go.
Why are you holding back?

515
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:29,967
These aren't just notes you're playing...

516
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:32,812
...they're phrases. Human outcries.

517
00:41:32,973 --> 00:41:35,362
I understand that! And I practice!

518
00:41:35,853 --> 00:41:38,162
I practice until my fingers bleed!

519
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:40,726
I know.

520
00:41:40,973 --> 00:41:44,010
It's the sixteenth notes in the allegro.
I can't do it!

521
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:45,766
Yes, you can.

522
00:41:46,893 --> 00:41:48,406
It's no good.

523
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,446
I don't have it.

524
00:41:53,693 --> 00:41:54,887
I can't do it.

525
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,646
Yes, you can.

526
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,327
Trust me.

527
00:42:05,213 --> 00:42:06,487
Trust me.

528
00:42:18,253 --> 00:42:19,686
Try it.

529
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:22,406
Try it.

530
00:42:23,213 --> 00:42:24,805
Let it go. What are you afraid of?

531
00:42:24,893 --> 00:42:27,771
You have great passion in you. Let it out!

532
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:30,085
I can take it.

533
00:42:30,413 --> 00:42:31,846
I want it!

534
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:48,609
Yes, that's it.

535
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:53,925
Breathe into it.

536
00:42:54,253 --> 00:42:56,164
Don't tighten up.

537
00:42:57,853 --> 00:42:59,923
Feel it. Hold it. Love it!

538
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,607
That's it.

539
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:03,446
That's right. Now!

540
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:14,003
That's right. Do you feel that?

541
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:16,853
Let it wash over you. Let it tickle you.

542
00:44:31,373 --> 00:44:32,806
Did you miss me?

543
00:44:36,493 --> 00:44:38,882
Do you want to listen to some tapes?

544
00:44:43,373 --> 00:44:44,965
I'm out here!

545
00:44:47,213 --> 00:44:48,726
-Let's go.
-What is that?

546
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:52,806
We're going to be late.
Carol, the number is on the fridge!

547
00:44:53,613 --> 00:44:56,491
-But you're not dressed.
-I'm not naked.

548
00:44:58,653 --> 00:45:00,723
-I don't believe it!
-Neither do l!

549
00:45:00,893 --> 00:45:03,771
But I swear to God,
I couldn't walk for two days.

550
00:45:05,613 --> 00:45:08,332
His penis is amazing.
It bends the wrong way.

551
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,443
The wrong...? Wait a minute!

552
00:45:10,893 --> 00:45:12,485
It bends like that!

553
00:45:12,733 --> 00:45:14,963
-You're terrible.
-No, I'm fabulous!

554
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:18,328
But just because you went
to bed with him--

555
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:21,450
No, it's not just that!
It's like he knows me.

556
00:45:21,693 --> 00:45:25,527
He knows everything!
I can't wait for you to meet him.

557
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:30,085
And I can't wait for Jane to meet him!
Jane will love him!

558
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,808
Is that you?

559
00:45:42,413 --> 00:45:44,483
Did you come to fix the plumbing?

560
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:47,930
I didn't have time to change.
What's your excuse?

561
00:45:48,013 --> 00:45:50,004
I don't need one. I was invited.

562
00:45:50,093 --> 00:45:51,208
So was l.

563
00:45:53,453 --> 00:45:54,727
Darling!

564
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,605
-Are we late?
-Not at all.

565
00:45:57,773 --> 00:45:59,252
Weren't we playing singles?

566
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,642
-You don't play tennis.
-I do now.

567
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,485
At last we meet.

568
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:08,965
Let me...

569
00:46:09,573 --> 00:46:12,133
...look at those eyes of yours.

570
00:46:13,453 --> 00:46:16,013
You are a fertile creature, aren't you?

571
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:17,482
Thank you, I think.

572
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:21,009
I'm reading that rag of a newspaper.
You are a genius.

573
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,491
Wasted. Pearls before swine.

574
00:46:25,453 --> 00:46:29,287
When are we going to do our interview?
I love interviews.

575
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,643
-They're so intimate.
-Anytime you say.

576
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:36,049
Just the two of us,
banging away, head to head.

577
00:46:39,373 --> 00:46:40,567
But not today.

578
00:46:40,693 --> 00:46:43,526
Today is for tennis. Are you ready, ladies?

579
00:46:48,493 --> 00:46:50,085
What a day!

580
00:46:51,213 --> 00:46:52,965
What a day!

581
00:46:55,373 --> 00:46:57,284
Is that your perfume?

582
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:12,246
Double fault!

583
00:47:12,493 --> 00:47:14,245
I'm not blind or deaf!

584
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:16,165
You don't have to shout!

585
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:18,972
We're all good friends. Let's play fair.

586
00:47:19,453 --> 00:47:22,650
I always play fair, okay? Love-forty, Jane.

587
00:47:24,813 --> 00:47:27,281
-What do you mean?
-Don't let them rattle you.

588
00:47:27,373 --> 00:47:29,933
They're just trying to get you. Let's go.

589
00:47:41,613 --> 00:47:43,524
Sorry, darling. Lost my head.

590
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,046
Fault.

591
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:17,765
I've got it!

592
00:48:22,173 --> 00:48:23,686
It's not coming down.

593
00:48:39,613 --> 00:48:40,807
Come on.

594
00:48:41,093 --> 00:48:43,163
Our game. Sukie serves.

595
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:18,648
Stop!

596
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:57,285
Good going, Daryl.

597
00:50:38,133 --> 00:50:39,725
Maleficio!

598
00:50:42,493 --> 00:50:43,926
This drink is strong. What is it?

599
00:50:44,013 --> 00:50:46,083
Rum...vodka...

600
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:48,645
...brandy...

601
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:50,087
...acid.

602
00:50:50,813 --> 00:50:52,326
I'm only kidding.

603
00:50:52,653 --> 00:50:55,531
I don't mind. Drugs have no effect on me.

604
00:50:56,013 --> 00:50:57,605
Neither does alcohol.

605
00:50:57,933 --> 00:51:00,652
It's true. It's boring, but it's true.

606
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:07,923
Are you going to seduce me, too?

607
00:51:09,613 --> 00:51:10,728
Yes.

608
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:13,847
How?

609
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,686
I don't know.

610
00:51:19,973 --> 00:51:22,362
I should warn you. I get pregnant.

611
00:51:23,693 --> 00:51:26,571
I get pregnant all the time.
At the drop of a hat.

612
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:28,883
From borrowing your toothbrush.

613
00:51:29,773 --> 00:51:31,684
I'll keep that in mind.

614
00:51:33,893 --> 00:51:35,531
That doesn't bother you?

615
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:42,449
You're not like other men, are you?

616
00:51:43,053 --> 00:51:44,168
I'm not.

617
00:51:44,653 --> 00:51:48,965
Most men, well, my husband,
try to keep everything under control...

618
00:51:49,253 --> 00:51:51,483
...pretend everything is normal.

619
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:55,686
Always rational,
always an explanation for everything.

620
00:51:56,333 --> 00:52:00,485
Men need that, don't they?
To feel...everything is solid.

621
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:03,293
And the world just isn't like that.

622
00:52:04,013 --> 00:52:06,573
Certainly not with you three around.

623
00:52:23,453 --> 00:52:26,331
We're not so different from other women.

624
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,603
Women are more natural, right?

625
00:52:28,933 --> 00:52:32,289
And nature is crazy,
no matter what science says.

626
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,968
-So I don't mind.
-You don't mind what?

627
00:52:38,213 --> 00:52:42,365
I don't mind when peculiar things happen.
It's natural...

628
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:45,127
...because the world is a peculiar place.

629
00:52:45,573 --> 00:52:47,803
And you're a very peculiar person.

630
00:52:49,053 --> 00:52:50,122
Thank you.

631
00:52:52,453 --> 00:52:54,648
I would love to be a woman.

632
00:52:55,933 --> 00:52:57,207
Really? Why?

633
00:52:57,573 --> 00:53:00,929
Just look what you can do
with your bodies.

634
00:53:01,413 --> 00:53:03,483
Make babies and...

635
00:53:04,453 --> 00:53:07,013
...make milk to feed the babies.

636
00:53:09,893 --> 00:53:11,804
If I could do that....

637
00:53:13,573 --> 00:53:15,484
Who are you, really?

638
00:53:18,053 --> 00:53:20,283
Anybody you want me to be.

639
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:51,643
Look at what they can do.

640
00:55:53,093 --> 00:55:55,004
These are human beings.

641
00:56:05,253 --> 00:56:08,768
When you're a kid
and don't understand anything...

642
00:56:09,093 --> 00:56:12,130
...you think when you grow up
it will all make sense.

643
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:15,490
Then when you grow up,
you keep waiting for the day.

644
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:17,325
You think it ever happens?

645
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:22,046
It starts when you open your eyes
and realize what the future...

646
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:23,725
...has in store for you.

647
00:56:24,773 --> 00:56:28,129
And what do you see
when you open your eyes?

648
00:56:32,813 --> 00:56:35,043
It's a short life, isn't it?

649
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:39,484
Sometimes I look in the mirror
and I see everything...

650
00:56:39,533 --> 00:56:41,683
...disintegrating faster and faster.

651
00:56:46,893 --> 00:56:48,804
I always see snakes.

652
00:56:49,133 --> 00:56:51,044
Hundreds of them.

653
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,922
They crawl all over me and I disappear.

654
00:56:54,253 --> 00:56:56,483
Then I'm just not there anymore.

655
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:06,726
I don't mind that it's a short life
or growing old or disappearing.

656
00:57:07,373 --> 00:57:11,207
It's the pain that scares me.
I don't know why there has to be...

657
00:57:11,853 --> 00:57:13,605
...so much pain.

658
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:21,770
We don't deal the deck down here,
we just...

659
00:57:22,093 --> 00:57:24,163
...play the percentages.

660
00:58:08,973 --> 00:58:10,088
Whores.

661
00:58:15,213 --> 00:58:16,487
Whores!

662
00:58:19,213 --> 00:58:20,487
Whores!

663
00:58:26,733 --> 00:58:28,325
Look around you.

664
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:31,852
Look around you.
Do you see what's happening?

665
00:58:32,653 --> 00:58:34,086
In our town.

666
00:58:34,413 --> 00:58:36,324
In our very homes!

667
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:43,052
You know who I'm talking about.
You know!

668
00:58:43,693 --> 00:58:47,049
You know what's going on in that house!
There is vice!

669
00:58:47,293 --> 00:58:48,772
There's perversions!

670
00:58:48,973 --> 00:58:50,565
Shamelessness!

671
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:52,566
Cavorting...

672
00:58:52,973 --> 00:58:54,884
...with that...devil!

673
00:58:55,013 --> 00:58:56,924
She's fine. She's sick.

674
00:58:58,653 --> 00:59:01,451
No! Drugs! Drugs are next.

675
00:59:01,933 --> 00:59:03,048
Murder!

676
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:04,807
Rape!

677
00:59:06,253 --> 00:59:07,447
Incest!

678
00:59:07,853 --> 00:59:09,445
Spanish flies!

679
00:59:09,853 --> 00:59:12,162
Dildos! Anal intercourse!

680
00:59:15,373 --> 00:59:17,125
Listen to me!

681
00:59:18,253 --> 00:59:19,208
Sorry!

682
00:59:37,133 --> 00:59:39,044
Let's go home, Felicia.

683
00:59:39,373 --> 00:59:41,443
You employ one of them, Clyde.

684
00:59:41,693 --> 00:59:43,445
That's nobody's business.

685
00:59:44,653 --> 00:59:47,042
It is everybody's business!

686
00:59:49,133 --> 00:59:51,852
You know, once...there was a paradise.

687
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:55,691
Then a serpent came into that garden.

688
00:59:55,933 --> 00:59:58,731
For Christ's sake, Felicia, would you stop?

689
01:00:04,013 --> 01:00:06,402
I have nothing against a good fuck.

690
01:00:08,013 --> 01:00:10,163
But there is danger here.

691
01:00:12,173 --> 01:00:15,051
Somebody has to do something about it.

692
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,447
Okay, stop.

693
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,525
Stop! Stop.

694
01:00:52,493 --> 01:00:54,245
Let's get rid of the music.

695
01:00:55,213 --> 01:00:59,684
Throw it away! Get rid of it.
Let's get rid of the music.

696
01:01:02,093 --> 01:01:04,653
I want you all to close your eyes.

697
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:08,010
Take a deep breath.

698
01:01:09,613 --> 01:01:11,205
Let it all out.

699
01:01:13,613 --> 01:01:15,763
Now we'll pick up our instruments...

700
01:01:17,013 --> 01:01:19,083
...and when I count to four...

701
01:01:19,653 --> 01:01:22,167
...we'll play the shit out of this thing.

702
01:01:32,973 --> 01:01:35,043
That's it, just relax.

703
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:38,563
Take it easy. Good.

704
01:01:39,853 --> 01:01:41,127
Nice!

705
01:01:42,093 --> 01:01:43,367
Smile.

706
01:01:43,693 --> 01:01:45,923
Come on, smile, Martha.

707
01:01:57,933 --> 01:02:00,970
Just let it flow over you. Good.

708
01:02:04,653 --> 01:02:06,405
Let it tickle you now.

709
01:02:11,053 --> 01:02:13,442
You've got it now. Come on!

710
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:14,927
It's yours!

711
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:31,530
These aren't phrases,
these are human outcries!

712
01:02:56,813 --> 01:02:59,691
Double, double chocolate.
These are fabulous.

713
01:03:33,293 --> 01:03:35,409
Are you buying the paper or not?

714
01:03:37,133 --> 01:03:38,407
Slut.

715
01:03:40,373 --> 01:03:41,726
What did you say?

716
01:03:41,933 --> 01:03:43,207
You heard her.

717
01:03:58,253 --> 01:04:00,483
She's not wearing a bra.

718
01:04:01,813 --> 01:04:03,451
How could you do this?

719
01:04:03,533 --> 01:04:06,093
We didn't use any names
except for Van Horne.

720
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,203
You don't know what goes on there.

721
01:04:08,533 --> 01:04:10,922
The whole town is talking about it.

722
01:04:11,053 --> 01:04:13,772
This is so unfair. It's also untrue.

723
01:04:15,413 --> 01:04:18,769
He filled in the wetlands
and ruined it for the birds.

724
01:04:19,053 --> 01:04:21,613
He altered the landmark building...

725
01:04:22,293 --> 01:04:24,807
...and the town is suing him for $2 million.

726
01:04:24,853 --> 01:04:26,923
How can you do this to me?

727
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:30,410
I work very hard
and you know I'm a good writer.

728
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:37,602
I don't own the newspaper, you know.

729
01:04:41,453 --> 01:04:43,364
It's Felicia, isn't it?

730
01:04:43,893 --> 01:04:45,008
She's a...

731
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:47,452
...very sick woman.

732
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:51,845
She's having a very bad time.
And I don't know what to do.

733
01:04:52,813 --> 01:04:54,724
I want her to see a doctor.

734
01:04:55,053 --> 01:04:58,568
Well, not a doctor, you know,
but a...doctor.

735
01:05:09,613 --> 01:05:12,002
We went to high school together.

736
01:05:13,773 --> 01:05:15,252
She was a catch.

737
01:05:17,293 --> 01:05:21,650
Ever since the accident,
she just hasn't been the same. And now....

738
01:05:26,733 --> 01:05:28,485
I'm so sorry, Clyde.

739
01:05:38,093 --> 01:05:39,572
What am I doing?

740
01:05:40,013 --> 01:05:41,332
Firing me.

741
01:05:46,733 --> 01:05:49,293
All these terrible things she says...

742
01:05:51,373 --> 01:05:53,284
...they're not true, are they?

743
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,803
We should stop seeing each other.

744
01:05:58,893 --> 01:06:00,645
Let's not overreact.

745
01:06:01,453 --> 01:06:04,365
-I think we should.
-It's a small town, Daryl.

746
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:07,486
We haven't done anything wrong.
Why stop seeing each other?

747
01:06:07,573 --> 01:06:09,450
Clyde says that Felicia has visions.

748
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:10,852
Why women always have visions?

749
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:13,083
She sees the devil here in Eastwick.

750
01:06:13,293 --> 01:06:16,330
If you were the devil,
would you come to Eastwick?

751
01:06:16,653 --> 01:06:18,769
Oh, I don't know.

752
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,082
Poor Felicia.

753
01:06:20,173 --> 01:06:23,688
Poor Felicia?
She talked to all of my students' mothers.

754
01:06:23,733 --> 01:06:25,530
I had 12 cancellations this week.

755
01:06:25,613 --> 01:06:28,081
People tell Carol her mother is a dyke.

756
01:06:28,173 --> 01:06:30,004
You're being sued for millions.

757
01:06:30,093 --> 01:06:31,685
That is inconvenient.

758
01:06:31,893 --> 01:06:34,453
She's not kidding
with her medieval morality.

759
01:06:34,893 --> 01:06:37,771
I think Sukie is right.
Maybe we should stop.

760
01:06:38,253 --> 01:06:39,288
Maybe she should stop.

761
01:06:39,373 --> 01:06:41,648
You can't be serious. We're a family.

762
01:06:41,933 --> 01:06:44,652
Just for a while until things settle down.

763
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:49,124
Don't let her get to you.

764
01:06:49,453 --> 01:06:50,886
Have a cherry.

765
01:07:01,293 --> 01:07:04,968
They are selling pornography
at Schyler's News Shop.

766
01:07:06,093 --> 01:07:08,482
In the open. On the shelves.

767
01:07:08,813 --> 01:07:11,043
Children are looking at this....

768
01:07:13,933 --> 01:07:15,685
It's in broad daylight.

769
01:07:16,493 --> 01:07:19,212
I can't understand one word you're saying!

770
01:07:19,413 --> 01:07:21,608
They're standing in line....

771
01:07:28,653 --> 01:07:30,564
Filth in broad daylight.

772
01:07:40,813 --> 01:07:42,644
She made a scene at Schyler's.

773
01:07:42,733 --> 01:07:45,930
Grabbing magazines from kids
and chasing them.

774
01:07:46,573 --> 01:07:50,122
She's in pain. Clyde, too.
He started drinking again.

775
01:07:50,413 --> 01:07:53,371
She's twisted.
Getting to me through my kid is sick.

776
01:07:53,453 --> 01:07:56,411
-We could help.
-By putting her out of her misery.

777
01:07:56,493 --> 01:07:59,053
Please. They're lucky to have each other.

778
01:07:59,093 --> 01:08:02,403
If they don't appreciate that,
I have no sympathy.

779
01:08:02,893 --> 01:08:05,851
Easy for you to say.
You don't have kids or a family.

780
01:08:06,453 --> 01:08:09,923
You're my family. I don't want to lose it.

781
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:13,772
I just can't stand to see you upset.

782
01:08:15,093 --> 01:08:17,288
You don't know what it does to me.

783
01:08:18,573 --> 01:08:20,484
I wish she would just go away.

784
01:08:22,573 --> 01:08:24,325
Have another cherry.

785
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:45,123
He's trying to get inside me.

786
01:08:46,253 --> 01:08:47,811
He's trying to use me.

787
01:08:49,133 --> 01:08:51,363
And he's using these women, too.

788
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:55,363
He wants to take our goodness.

789
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:02,449
He wants to get inside me.

790
01:09:04,493 --> 01:09:06,085
Just like a man.

791
01:09:06,933 --> 01:09:08,525
Tickle, diddle.

792
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:17,926
God made us in the image of goodness.
Look what we've become.

793
01:09:21,773 --> 01:09:23,525
Animals gone mad...

794
01:09:24,213 --> 01:09:27,091
...devouring the earth and each other.

795
01:09:28,853 --> 01:09:31,083
Eat, eat, eat, eat!

796
01:09:34,733 --> 01:09:36,849
Felicia, calm down.

797
01:09:46,053 --> 01:09:47,805
I know who he is, Clyde.

798
01:09:49,253 --> 01:09:50,845
Have another cherry.

799
01:10:03,613 --> 01:10:05,729
What have you been eating?

800
01:10:06,533 --> 01:10:08,285
Those poor women.

801
01:10:08,773 --> 01:10:10,365
I have to warn them.

802
01:10:16,933 --> 01:10:18,844
He'll propagate, Clyde.

803
01:10:20,773 --> 01:10:22,843
He will increase his number.

804
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:28,445
Those women are going to bear him sons.

805
01:10:29,733 --> 01:10:33,646
He's going to take their love
and destroy the Earth with it.

806
01:10:53,573 --> 01:10:55,325
Let's call it a day.

807
01:12:13,253 --> 01:12:14,686
I don't believe it.

808
01:12:17,573 --> 01:12:19,643
I know him. He couldn't do this.

809
01:12:20,293 --> 01:12:22,853
Alex, don't you get it? God!

810
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,242
Us!

811
01:12:26,373 --> 01:12:28,284
Last night, all that talk.

812
01:12:28,533 --> 01:12:30,285
Those were just words.

813
01:12:30,533 --> 01:12:33,411
They make things happen.
We make things happen.

814
01:12:33,653 --> 01:12:35,962
-We had nothing to do with this.
-Yes, we do!

815
01:12:36,053 --> 01:12:37,566
We should talk to Daryl.

816
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:40,372
Why? Why do we have to do
everything Daryl says?

817
01:12:40,613 --> 01:12:41,841
She's right.

818
01:12:41,893 --> 01:12:44,612
Some man comes along
and nothing else matters!

819
01:12:44,933 --> 01:12:46,685
You are so dumb, Jane.

820
01:12:47,013 --> 01:12:50,164
-This is about us, not Daryl.
-Let's call him.

821
01:12:50,293 --> 01:12:52,932
Can't you stop thinking
from between your legs?

822
01:12:53,053 --> 01:12:54,281
You bitch!

823
01:12:55,893 --> 01:12:57,246
Shut up, Sukie!

824
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:41,565
Anybody called?

825
01:14:28,773 --> 01:14:30,365
Remember me?

826
01:14:31,573 --> 01:14:32,722
How are you?

827
01:14:34,373 --> 01:14:36,409
I'm hanging in there.

828
01:14:36,493 --> 01:14:37,846
What do you want?

829
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:41,410
Nothing. I just called to see how you are.

830
01:14:43,173 --> 01:14:45,403
See how things were going.

831
01:14:46,213 --> 01:14:47,487
I'm fine.

832
01:14:51,493 --> 01:14:54,690
I wanted to...see how you were.

833
01:14:56,293 --> 01:14:58,363
Make sure you were okay.

834
01:14:59,013 --> 01:15:02,847
Make sure you didn't have
any uncontrollable desire to see me.

835
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:08,484
In case you were missing me
and you were too embarrassed to call...

836
01:15:08,693 --> 01:15:10,206
...l called first.

837
01:15:10,253 --> 01:15:13,848
Then you could feel superior
and see me at the same time.

838
01:15:15,573 --> 01:15:17,006
What do you say?

839
01:15:17,973 --> 01:15:21,170
I don't feel superior. I feel terrible.

840
01:15:22,813 --> 01:15:24,724
I feel terrible, too.

841
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:28,250
If we both feel terrible,
can't we do something about it?

842
01:15:28,373 --> 01:15:29,852
What's going on here?

843
01:15:29,933 --> 01:15:33,005
Nobody's calling me.
Nobody's coming to see me.

844
01:15:34,653 --> 01:15:36,484
We need a little time, okay?

845
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:39,929
No, it's not okay, Alex. I don't understand.

846
01:15:40,253 --> 01:15:42,892
Somebody died, Daryl. Felicia is dead!

847
01:15:46,493 --> 01:15:49,883
People die all the time.
She was in a bad way.

848
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:52,083
What does that have to do with us?

849
01:15:53,213 --> 01:15:56,649
I can't talk to you.
Don't call me, because l--

850
01:15:56,893 --> 01:15:58,087
Don't hang up!

851
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:01,609
Alex, don't do this! This is not fair!

852
01:16:40,253 --> 01:16:42,323
Happy birthday!

853
01:16:43,693 --> 01:16:45,206
It's not my birthday.

854
01:16:46,013 --> 01:16:47,002
It isn't?

855
01:16:48,093 --> 01:16:49,287
You sure?

856
01:16:52,893 --> 01:16:54,485
Well, what the hell.

857
01:16:55,453 --> 01:16:57,364
Happy whatever day.

858
01:16:57,693 --> 01:16:59,763
These are my favorite fruits.

859
01:17:00,253 --> 01:17:02,244
I can't accept those, Daryl.

860
01:17:08,893 --> 01:17:11,123
I'm freezing my nuts off out here.

861
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:13,841
I can't ask you in, I'm sorry.

862
01:17:15,613 --> 01:17:18,650
Not even for a little while? Just to dry off.

863
01:17:20,253 --> 01:17:22,403
Talk to the kids maybe.

864
01:17:23,293 --> 01:17:25,523
No. You have to go away.

865
01:17:26,173 --> 01:17:29,688
You have to go away now!
I can't see you or talk to you.

866
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:32,243
I'm sorry, Daryl, but I can't!

867
01:18:09,533 --> 01:18:10,648
Jane?

868
01:18:49,013 --> 01:18:50,446
What's wrong with me?

869
01:18:50,533 --> 01:18:52,842
Nothing. You're pregnant.

870
01:18:57,493 --> 01:18:59,085
Three or four weeks.

871
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:03,092
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

872
01:19:05,813 --> 01:19:09,488
I thought something was really wrong.
Are you sure?

873
01:19:09,813 --> 01:19:11,724
Do you need a doctor?

874
01:19:13,493 --> 01:19:15,085
Thank you so much.

875
01:19:16,053 --> 01:19:18,123
Ms. Spofford, your clothes.

876
01:19:45,813 --> 01:19:47,405
I want to surprise him.

877
01:19:59,573 --> 01:20:01,803
It's a short life, isn't it?

878
01:20:03,053 --> 01:20:05,806
I look in the mirror and see everything...

879
01:20:06,453 --> 01:20:08,842
...disintegrating faster and faster.

880
01:20:10,733 --> 01:20:13,167
It's a short life, isn't it?

881
01:20:14,253 --> 01:20:17,325
I look in the mirror and see everything...

882
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:19,729
...disintegrating faster and faster.

883
01:20:54,773 --> 01:20:57,333
They crawl all over me and I disappear.

884
01:20:57,653 --> 01:20:59,644
Then I'mjust not there anymore.

885
01:20:59,893 --> 01:21:01,008
Alex!

886
01:21:02,853 --> 01:21:04,764
I always see snakes.

887
01:21:05,973 --> 01:21:07,884
Hundreds of them.

888
01:21:08,373 --> 01:21:12,491
They crawl all over me and I disappear.
Then I'mjust not there.

889
01:21:55,253 --> 01:21:56,686
Alex, it's me.

890
01:21:58,453 --> 01:22:02,128
It's me. Just let it go. Let it go!
Look at me!

891
01:22:07,373 --> 01:22:10,604
Pain scares me.
I don't know why there has to be...

892
01:22:11,733 --> 01:22:13,166
...so much pain.

893
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:27,248
I don't know why there has to be...

894
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,285
...so much pain.

895
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:38,925
Can we talk?

896
01:23:41,653 --> 01:23:45,282
She's still hemorrhaging.
We slowed it down, but....

897
01:23:45,493 --> 01:23:46,642
Will she be okay?

898
01:23:46,733 --> 01:23:49,770
If we knew what was wrong,
we'd have a chance.

899
01:23:50,013 --> 01:23:51,207
Can we see her?

900
01:23:51,733 --> 01:23:54,884
She's still in a lot of pain.
I can't give her anything...

901
01:23:54,933 --> 01:23:57,322
...until we know what we're dealing with.

902
01:23:57,573 --> 01:23:59,484
Okay. Go ahead.

903
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:07,892
Sweetheart, the doctor says you'll be fine.

904
01:24:09,493 --> 01:24:11,723
He doesn't know what's going on.

905
01:24:20,373 --> 01:24:21,931
I'm pregnant.

906
01:24:25,133 --> 01:24:26,612
So am l.

907
01:24:34,613 --> 01:24:36,524
That son of a bitch.

908
01:24:40,813 --> 01:24:43,281
Make him stop, please. Make him stop.

909
01:24:43,493 --> 01:24:45,131
I will, honey. I will.

910
01:25:00,213 --> 01:25:02,283
Back off, Fidel!

911
01:25:17,853 --> 01:25:19,081
Alex?

912
01:25:20,013 --> 01:25:22,402
-Don't "Alex" me!
-What a nice surprise.

913
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:24,404
What the hell do you think you're doing?

914
01:25:24,493 --> 01:25:27,291
I said: "What the hell
do you think you're doing?"

915
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:28,965
A little housework.

916
01:25:30,133 --> 01:25:34,126
I send these shirts out
and they come back in pieces.

917
01:25:34,533 --> 01:25:36,091
Small town.

918
01:25:36,693 --> 01:25:38,285
Not enough Orientals.

919
01:25:38,453 --> 01:25:41,490
Fidel's all thumbs with this kind of thing.

920
01:25:41,973 --> 01:25:43,645
That just leaves me.

921
01:25:43,733 --> 01:25:46,964
I'm not talking about your damn laundry,
I'm talking about...

922
01:25:47,053 --> 01:25:49,044
...Sukie and Jane and me.

923
01:25:50,253 --> 01:25:54,849
Golly. You girls sure are
having a hard time, aren't you?

924
01:25:56,493 --> 01:25:58,085
Sukie is very ill.

925
01:26:00,813 --> 01:26:02,724
Well, I'm sorry to hear it.

926
01:26:02,933 --> 01:26:04,651
Then do something about it!

927
01:26:05,133 --> 01:26:08,045
Me? What can I do about it?

928
01:26:08,533 --> 01:26:10,763
It has nothing to do with me anymore.

929
01:26:11,053 --> 01:26:12,964
It does, and you know it does!

930
01:26:13,133 --> 01:26:14,566
No, I don't.

931
01:26:15,693 --> 01:26:19,652
All I know is we were friends
and the next day I was shut out.

932
01:26:20,013 --> 01:26:21,446
That's all I know.

933
01:26:22,213 --> 01:26:24,727
One minute I was
the answer to your prayers.

934
01:26:24,813 --> 01:26:28,328
Five minutes later,
no one would give me the time of day.

935
01:26:28,373 --> 01:26:31,445
Sukie could die!
Don't you understand that?

936
01:26:31,893 --> 01:26:35,249
-I can't help it.
-Yes, you can. Don't lie to me.

937
01:26:36,853 --> 01:26:38,605
You deserted me.

938
01:26:39,693 --> 01:26:40,842
We had a deal.

939
01:26:41,253 --> 01:26:43,209
-That's no reason--
-Yes, it is!

940
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:45,086
You pissed me off!

941
01:26:45,453 --> 01:26:47,284
Was I supposed to take it like a man?

942
01:26:47,373 --> 01:26:48,726
I gave you everything I got!

943
01:26:48,813 --> 01:26:51,930
I gave you more than anybody ever has,
and what do I get in exchange?

944
01:26:52,013 --> 01:26:54,368
A little thank you? A little gratitude?

945
01:26:54,453 --> 01:26:55,647
I get screwed!

946
01:26:56,653 --> 01:26:59,121
Oh, cut the crap!
What do you want from us?

947
01:26:59,733 --> 01:27:02,645
I want somebody to do these shirts!

948
01:27:03,253 --> 01:27:07,132
I want somebody to pay attention to me!
I want some respect!

949
01:27:07,373 --> 01:27:10,729
I want somebody
to take care of me for a change!

950
01:27:10,973 --> 01:27:12,292
How about that?

951
01:27:13,053 --> 01:27:15,965
What do I want? Christ!

952
01:27:16,213 --> 01:27:18,932
What does any man want?

953
01:27:19,893 --> 01:27:21,485
A little affection.

954
01:27:22,213 --> 01:27:24,090
A little trust.

955
01:27:25,653 --> 01:27:27,006
Goddamn it.

956
01:27:27,493 --> 01:27:30,485
Everything I did...l did for you.

957
01:27:35,973 --> 01:27:37,565
I was wrong.

958
01:27:38,053 --> 01:27:39,327
Go ahead.

959
01:27:39,653 --> 01:27:43,931
Go back to your miserable little life.
Fuck me if I care!

960
01:27:44,293 --> 01:27:47,569
If that's what you want...
that's what you'll get.

961
01:27:48,453 --> 01:27:51,013
You are not the only three women
in the world.

962
01:27:53,333 --> 01:27:55,244
You're hurting people, Daryl.

963
01:27:56,773 --> 01:27:58,525
What you did for us was great.

964
01:27:58,613 --> 01:28:01,081
But you can't use your power
to hurt people.

965
01:28:02,773 --> 01:28:04,491
Don't you understand that?

966
01:28:07,413 --> 01:28:10,610
I want my family back together, that's all.

967
01:28:11,773 --> 01:28:12,842
You...

968
01:28:13,253 --> 01:28:14,766
...and Sukie...

969
01:28:14,973 --> 01:28:16,531
...and Jane.

970
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,085
I couldn't hurt Sukie.

971
01:28:19,253 --> 01:28:21,687
I couldn't hurt any of you. How could l?

972
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:24,247
I love you.

973
01:28:24,373 --> 01:28:26,170
You don't know what love is.

974
01:28:26,253 --> 01:28:28,289
I can learn. You could teach me.

975
01:28:28,973 --> 01:28:30,691
How hard can it be?

976
01:28:33,573 --> 01:28:34,688
Let's not fight.

977
01:28:34,773 --> 01:28:37,970
You can't win.
There's no way you can win.

978
01:28:38,493 --> 01:28:41,530
There's nothing to go back to,
even if you could win.

979
01:28:41,573 --> 01:28:42,892
Can't we just...

980
01:28:43,573 --> 01:28:46,133
...put this behind us and be friends?

981
01:28:56,853 --> 01:28:58,206
See?

982
01:28:58,453 --> 01:29:00,205
Isn't that nice?

983
01:29:02,533 --> 01:29:03,966
Tell the truth.

984
01:29:04,853 --> 01:29:07,890
You missed me a little bit, didn't you?

985
01:29:14,053 --> 01:29:16,203
Let's kiss and make it better.

986
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:19,966
What do you say?

987
01:29:22,453 --> 01:29:24,523
What are we going to do with you?

988
01:29:31,213 --> 01:29:32,771
It stopped.

989
01:30:28,013 --> 01:30:29,810
Darling, you look perfect.

990
01:30:43,893 --> 01:30:45,485
You look gorgeous.

991
01:30:46,853 --> 01:30:48,127
Feeling better?

992
01:30:48,213 --> 01:30:51,728
Much better.
Everything's going to be much better.

993
01:31:37,493 --> 01:31:39,165
We're going to town.

994
01:31:39,733 --> 01:31:43,885
The ladies have a craving
for bagels and ice cream.

995
01:33:03,213 --> 01:33:05,124
Three pinches.

996
01:33:12,773 --> 01:33:14,286
I'd like, uh...

997
01:33:14,533 --> 01:33:18,685
...dozen bagels, a pound of gravlax and
what kind of ice cream do you have?

998
01:33:18,933 --> 01:33:21,083
No ice cream. The freezer's broken.

999
01:33:24,973 --> 01:33:27,567
I'll take the bread and the fish.

1000
01:33:34,533 --> 01:33:35,852
It doesn't look like him.

1001
01:33:35,933 --> 01:33:38,493
It doesn't have to. We know who it is.

1002
01:33:38,573 --> 01:33:41,371
He looks funny with no hair.

1003
01:33:42,053 --> 01:33:43,327
It won't hurt him, will it?

1004
01:33:43,413 --> 01:33:45,643
No. We just want to send him away.

1005
01:33:51,253 --> 01:33:53,562
No ice cream. Imagine that.

1006
01:33:54,133 --> 01:33:57,648
I'll go see if I can't get some.
You go shopping.

1007
01:34:01,973 --> 01:34:05,807
I said, "A tall, dark prince
traveling under a curse.

1008
01:34:06,133 --> 01:34:07,725
"Somebody nice.

1009
01:34:08,053 --> 01:34:10,123
"Somebody you could talk to."

1010
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:18,930
I'd like some pistachio. That is pistachio?

1011
01:34:25,013 --> 01:34:27,083
And chocolate chocolate chip.

1012
01:34:30,293 --> 01:34:32,409
-Are you okay?
-No, my leg!

1013
01:34:35,413 --> 01:34:36,892
What is it?

1014
01:34:40,853 --> 01:34:42,252
What's the matter?

1015
01:34:44,373 --> 01:34:46,284
Are you having a heart attack?

1016
01:35:14,933 --> 01:35:16,525
Girls!

1017
01:35:17,853 --> 01:35:19,571
What are you doing?

1018
01:35:22,293 --> 01:35:24,409
Girls! Girls! Please, don't!

1019
01:35:58,813 --> 01:36:01,043
"Elijah fled to the mount of God.

1020
01:36:01,333 --> 01:36:04,769
"The Lord passed by and a great,
strong wind rent the mountains...

1021
01:36:04,853 --> 01:36:07,925
"...and breaked in pieces
the rocks before the Lord...."

1022
01:36:36,213 --> 01:36:37,487
Sorry.

1023
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:40,204
Just having a little trouble.

1024
01:36:42,373 --> 01:36:45,092
A little...trouble at home.

1025
01:36:45,173 --> 01:36:47,243
A little domestic problem.

1026
01:36:55,573 --> 01:36:57,803
Nothing...to be alarmed at.

1027
01:37:01,493 --> 01:37:04,212
Just a little...female problem.

1028
01:37:19,413 --> 01:37:21,165
Don't pay any attention.

1029
01:37:21,693 --> 01:37:23,604
It's a cheap trick.

1030
01:37:23,893 --> 01:37:27,090
Anybody can do it.
I taught it to them myself.

1031
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:30,448
Ungrateful little bitches, aren't they?

1032
01:37:31,093 --> 01:37:34,290
I want to ask you something.
You all go to church.

1033
01:37:34,613 --> 01:37:39,243
Do you think God knew what He
was doing when He created woman?

1034
01:37:40,733 --> 01:37:43,122
No shit! I really want to know.

1035
01:37:43,453 --> 01:37:46,445
Or do you think it was
one of His minor mistakes?

1036
01:37:46,653 --> 01:37:49,963
Like tidal waves! Earthquakes! Floods!

1037
01:37:51,453 --> 01:37:53,683
Do you think women are like that?

1038
01:38:09,973 --> 01:38:11,372
What's the matter?

1039
01:38:14,453 --> 01:38:17,013
You don't think God makes mistakes?

1040
01:38:19,093 --> 01:38:20,845
Of course He does.

1041
01:38:21,333 --> 01:38:23,403
We all make mistakes.

1042
01:38:25,973 --> 01:38:29,010
Of course, we make mistakes,
they call it evil.

1043
01:38:29,693 --> 01:38:33,686
When God makes mistakes,
they call it...nature.

1044
01:38:37,173 --> 01:38:38,765
So what do you think?

1045
01:38:38,973 --> 01:38:41,043
Women...a mistake?

1046
01:38:42,493 --> 01:38:45,849
Or did He do it to us on purpose?

1047
01:38:46,773 --> 01:38:48,365
I really want to know!

1048
01:38:48,853 --> 01:38:52,243
If it's a mistake,
maybe we can do something about it!

1049
01:38:52,533 --> 01:38:54,285
Find a cure!

1050
01:38:55,573 --> 01:38:57,325
Invent a vaccine.

1051
01:39:00,213 --> 01:39:02,488
Build up our immune systems.

1052
01:39:06,293 --> 01:39:08,853
Get a little exercise.

1053
01:39:12,533 --> 01:39:14,125
Twenty push-ups a day...

1054
01:39:14,293 --> 01:39:18,764
...and you never have to be afflicted
with women, ever again!

1055
01:39:49,493 --> 01:39:50,926
Okay, that's it.

1056
01:39:52,053 --> 01:39:53,725
How do we know it worked?

1057
01:39:53,973 --> 01:39:56,203
I guess we just wait and see.

1058
01:39:57,653 --> 01:39:59,883
My God, look at this place.

1059
01:40:01,613 --> 01:40:03,205
Just in case.

1060
01:43:35,053 --> 01:43:36,327
The doll.

1061
01:44:04,333 --> 01:44:06,085
Jane, laugh!

1062
01:47:00,893 --> 01:47:02,326
Come here.

1063
01:47:25,653 --> 01:47:28,690
Look at Fidel. What does he have for you?

1064
01:47:49,133 --> 01:47:50,407
Janey, stop it.

1065
01:47:52,653 --> 01:47:53,847
Just stop it.

1066
01:47:54,733 --> 01:47:56,803
I can think about him if I want to.

1067
01:47:56,893 --> 01:47:58,645
Not when we're all together.

1068
01:47:58,733 --> 01:48:00,610
I can't help it. I miss him.

1069
01:48:00,813 --> 01:48:02,724
I do, and so do you. Admit it.

1070
01:48:02,813 --> 01:48:04,326
Okay, we admit it.

1071
01:48:04,573 --> 01:48:06,165
Do you want him back?

1072
01:48:59,053 --> 01:49:00,566
Take it easy.

1073
01:49:00,653 --> 01:49:04,009
We don't want the whole household
in here, do we?

1074
01:49:04,493 --> 01:49:06,404
That's it. Good boys.

1075
01:49:06,653 --> 01:49:08,883
We're going to dojust fine.

1076
01:49:10,653 --> 01:49:13,850
Come to Daddy and give me a big kiss.

1077
01:49:18,253 --> 01:49:19,447
Come to Daddy.

1078
01:49:32,413 --> 01:49:34,563
Oh, ladies, come on.

1079
01:49:35,453 --> 01:49:37,409
