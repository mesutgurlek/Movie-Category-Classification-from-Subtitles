00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:06,001
* = Music or songs

3
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:50,191
Daily Sentinel, one moment please.

4
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:56,198
The mayor doesn't want the article on gas
prices go to print.

5
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:00,499
Tell the Mayor, I'm insulted.

6
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:04,488
I would never jeopardize the journalistic integrity
of this newspaper,

7
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,014
for some rent-a-mayor's political agenda.

8
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:08,321
Very well Mr. ...

9
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:13,320
So, Britt.

10
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:16,589
Here we are again.

11
00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:20,170
Sent home after another school yard fight.

12
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,834
I know you miss your mother.

13
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,532
So do I.

14
00:01:26,343 --> 00:01:30,068
But I have to take care of 750 employees,

15
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:32,063
and you have to take care of yourself.

16
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:37,231
Still that seems to be asking....to much.

17
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:39,678
I was trying to stop some bullies...

18
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,575
Trying doesn't matter when you always fail.

19
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:46,373
No, Dad!

20
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:53,431
Do you think it makes me happy to do this?

21
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:55,425
-YES!
-No it doesn't.

22
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,950
There's not a week goes by when you find
yourself in some kind of trouble.

23
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,809
But if you're doing this for attention,

24
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,875
you have all that I can afford to give you.

25
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,125
And you're wasting my time.

26
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:15,400
20 years later...

27
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,051
No, no, not you.

28
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Have a seat.

29
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:01,896
Either one, they're both very comfortable.

30
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:09,976
So what can I do for you?

31
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:14,475
As you know, I have worked my entire
life, very hard...

32
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:15,936
to achieve one goal.

33
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:20,258
-Well.
-And that goal, which I have in fact, achieved.

34
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:25,008
Was to be in charge of all the crime,
in the city of Los Angeles.

35
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,308
Therefore, the fact that you assume that
you can open this establishment,

36
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:32,843
without my permission.

37
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:35,254
without payment, and sell narcotics out of it.

38
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:36,871
Is completely unacceptable.

39
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,216
Really?

40
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:41,186
And to be honest.
Quite insulting.

41
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:46,127
Therefore, you must sign up ownership of this
establishment to me.

42
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:48,848
For which time you become my employees.

43
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,395
What, we're...we're your employees?

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,066
Yeah, or close down permanently.

45
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:55,065
The choice is yours.

46
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:56,917
Okay, uh, how do I pronounce your name?

47
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,453
Ch...Tchaikovsky.

48
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:00,619
Chudnofsky.

49
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,816
Char...chadost...chod dosky.

50
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:10,940
Chud...nof...sky.

51
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:12,561
Chudnofsky.

52
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:14,979
All right, Chudnofsky.

53
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:16,037
Kiss my ass.

54
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:19,423
Put your lips to my ass,

55
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:20,913
and kiss it.

56
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:21,952
French kiss it.

57
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,854
Tickle it with your grey whiskers.

58
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:26,746
I got bitter sweet news for you.

59
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,378
You're washed up.

60
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:31,416
You're old, you're boring, you're not scary.

61
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,152
You dress like shit.

62
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:36,332
It's over for you, okay.
That's the bitter news.

63
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:38,440
Now the sweet news is,

64
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:39,772
you can retire.

65
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:41,816
You can go play golf.

66
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,442
Eat your dinners at 3 O'clock in the afternoon.

67
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:48,613
Play with your grandkids, drink Metamucil.

68
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:50,336
Old people shit.

69
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:52,639
Okay, look at me.

70
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,966
I got a name people can say.

71
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,499
My name is Danny Clear.

72
00:04:58,277 --> 00:04:59,573
I deal crystal meth.

73
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,185
People call me, crystal-clear.

74
00:05:02,186 --> 00:05:03,299
It's easy.

75
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:06,015
Check out my kick-ass hangout here.

76
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:08,488
I got pillars of glass everywhere.

77
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:10,349
I got a see-through piano.

78
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:12,338
Look at my boys.

79
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:14,370
They're pimped out.

80
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:18,215
We got Gucci, Armani, another Gucci.

81
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:19,829
Tailor made.

82
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:24,350
This is what you need to get to the top, today.

83
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,299
Not hard work.

84
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:28,569
Not dressing like disco-Santa-Claus.

85
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:30,472
You need charisma.

86
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,473
You look like my Uncle Gregg.

87
00:05:33,237 --> 00:05:36,244
Very nice guy, but, he's a dentist.

88
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,821
Now consider this your retirement letter.

89
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:42,086
Boom!

90
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,820
It's over.

91
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:46,701
See your way out.

92
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:52,732
Well you truly don't think I'm scary?

93
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:55,775
Nah, no.

94
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,321
Okay, o...kay, you're scary!

95
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:04,017
Yeah, you're scary.

96
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:05,053
You just said I'm not.

97
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:06,519
No, no you are. You are.

98
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,412
What's a Disco-Santa?

99
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:11,643
Disco-Santa, I don't know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

100
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:13,179
It was just something stupid to say.

101
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,504
You said I'm boring too.
My gun has two barrels.

102
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:17,793
That's not boring.

103
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,641
But is was very difficult to make.

104
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:23,582
-Answer me!
-What?

105
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,367
Well what can I do to be more scary?

106
00:06:27,368 --> 00:06:29,944
A better name?
A cooler name?

107
00:06:29,945 --> 00:06:31,420
A little more color, or something.

108
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,153
Ah, um....

109
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:36,855
May...maybe, maybe you could say something
to people before you kill them.

110
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:40,749
But not now. It's hard to think with
this double barrel in my face.

111
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,848
Sorry.

112
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,913
You've given me a lot to think about.

113
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,375
You're not going to kill me?

114
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:59,501
Okay I get it. You keep me alive so I
can, I can spread your legend.

115
00:06:59,832 --> 00:07:01,481
Okay, I'll do that, man.

116
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,294
I'll spread your legend.

117
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,681
And you forgot your briefcase.

118
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
(High pitched beep)

119
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,587
Let's get this party crazy.

120
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:41,601
<i>*Rolling Stones: Live with me*</i>

121
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:44,322
<i>*I got nasty habits, *</i>

137

138
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:18,378
Mmmmm.

139
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,431
That's the good stuff.

140
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:30,508
Good morning.

141
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,107
-Alll..real
-Ana Lee.

142
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,090
Ana Lee, that's what I meant.

143
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:39,247
Oh shit.

144
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:45,618
Son, this what you want from your life?

145
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:52,507
This, uh. This gives you a sense of fulfillment?

146
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:55,340
Dad, I told you tomorrow,

147
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:58,137
I'm enrolling in I.T.T. Technical Institute.

148
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:00,881
I am going to fix computers for a living, so...

149
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:07,678
I spend all night writing an editorial about
the nausea this town has come to inspirer.

150
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,484
About the corruption, the violence,
and the decadence

151
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,719
that we've come to expect as part
of our daily life.

152
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:17,335
Then I have to turn the page...

153
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:22,130
and see my own son's
contribution to this mayhem.

154
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:27,208
Sweet, I'm on the paper.

155
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:29,720
Now you may think you're humiliating me.

156
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:32,204
-Oy.
-You're humiliating yourself.

157
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:35,253
Okay, I'm sorry. Look, if you don't like it, why
don't you ask them not to print it.

158
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:36,543
It's your newspaper.

159
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,709
I can't because unfortunately it's news.

160
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:43,781
I've kept myself out the papers for years,
now do me a favor and do the same.

161
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:48,720
And I told you, stop taking girls into my garage.

162
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:52,531
You do it again, I'll change the lock.

163
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:58,402
-Okay, but can you sign this for me?
-Yeah.

164
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:04,874
Never...stop...the party.

00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:53,537
Hello.
Get it, get the shot, get it.

172
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:56,176
How are you coping with your father's death?

173
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:00,022
If you're just joining us,

174
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:03,839
James Reid has been found dead from
an allergic reaction to a bee sting.

175
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,784
Leaving his son, his empire.

176

-Running for district attorney
when I first met James Reid.

182
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:42,436
It was immediately clear to me that he was a
man of infallible integrity.

183
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:45,179
He dedicated himself to this city,

184
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,057
though his philanthropic endeavors and his newspaper,
The Daily Sentinel.

185
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:51,745
A shinning beacon of truth.

186
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,057
He was our north star.

187
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,283
He showed us the way.

188
00:12:58,148 --> 00:12:59,397
Thank you James.

189
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,603
Britt, your father was truly a great man.

190
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:19,111
-When I first started campaigning...
-Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

191
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:21,443
-He was the best business man I've ever known.
-Yep.

192
00:13:21,444 --> 00:13:23,276
-He always came out on top.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

193
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
Britt?

194
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:29,490
Britt, hey.

195
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,222
I'm so sorry for your loss.

196
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,832
I just want to say that,

197
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:37,123
my father was a federal court judge.
So I think I kinda know how it feels.

198
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:39,567
When he passed away, I uh,

199
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,547
had some pretty big shoes to fill.

200
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:42,671
Just like you.

201
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,056
So if you ever need somebody to talk to.

202
00:13:46,461 --> 00:13:48,909
I mean, if you ever just want
to grab a drink.

203
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,050
Want to get cheered up.

204
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,097
I'm around.

205
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:56,635
Okay, thanks man I really appreciate it.

206
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,506
-Yeah, lock it up....keep it tight.
-Yeah, okay.... Cool.

207
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:13,200
This is your newspaper.

208
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:18,282
Look, the burden doesn't have to
fall on you alone.

209
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:28,492
I've been with your father since I was just
in college for the past forty five years.

210
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:33,075
I'm going to make sure the Daily Sentinel
stays on the path.

211
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:34,402
It would make him proud.

212
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,487
So what do you think of all this?

213
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:47,053
I don't think anything, man.

214
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:50,051
I don't know a thing about this newspaper.

215
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:53,711
I've never really read a full edition of it.

216
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,472
You can do whatever the hell you want with it.

217
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,255
I'm not the guy to run The Sentinel.

218
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:13,861
Trying means a man will always fail.

219
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:23,336
Oh.

220
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:25,725
Where's my leaf?

221
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:36,885
Stupid bush!

222
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:43,146
Hello!

223
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,025
Who makes my coffee?

224
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,749
WHO makes my coffee?

225
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,913
Will someone explain to me,

226
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,680
why the worst day in my life?

227
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:52,479
My coffee tastes like shit.

228
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,207
You...your coffee is normally made by, Kato.

229
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:57,147
Who the hell is that?

230
00:15:57,384 --> 00:16:00,575
He works on your father's cars,
and makes his coffee.

231
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:03,621
You fired him, and everyone else who works
for your father yesterday.

232
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:05,270
I want Kato here, NOW!

233
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:22,357
You're, Kato.

234
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:26,301
Man I thought your name was Henry.
I thought the pool guy was, Kato.

235
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:27,309
I'm Kato.

236
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,197
I'm sorry to hear about your father.

237
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:32,735
He was a...

238
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:34,466
complex man.

239
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:38,509
Yep.

240
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,106
I've two questions for you, Kato.

241
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:42,491
Then you can go home.

242
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:45,703
Why is it my dad's mechanic makes the coffee?

243
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,852
And why is it that without you,
the coffee tastes like crap?

244
00:16:49,181 --> 00:16:51,267
I think it's easier if I show you.

245
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:56,604
Holy cow. Where did you get that thing?

246
00:16:56,605 --> 00:16:57,644
I made it.

247
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:00,556
-Watch this.
-Unbelievable.

248
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,891
You sit with me, Kato.

249
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:45,484
Tell me your tale.

250
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,145
I was born in Shanghai.

251
00:17:47,426 --> 00:17:48,425
You know, Shanghai?

252
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:49,867
Mmm, loved Japan.

253
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,743
My parents died when I was four.

254
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:54,411
And Auntie when I was twelve.

255
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:56,729
I lived in an orphanage.

256
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,825
Sorry, my mom died when I was young, too.

257
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,097
What uh, what happened after that?

258
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,650
I made a few friends, ran away.

259
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:07,821
I lived on the street.

260
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:09,672
How did you start working for my Dad.
Tell me that.

261
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:10,842
I was working in a garage.

262
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:14,266
-Okay.
-And one day your father came in with a six-five Chrysler.

263
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,547
I know the car well.

264
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,201
He was so happy with my work.

265
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,769
Then  he offered me a job.

266
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:23,430
-I said, yes.
-The coffee, how did that come about?

267
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,677
He used to always say,

268
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:29,048
"No one could ever make me,
a good cup of coffee".

269
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,113
Good impression.

270
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:32,067
So I build him the coffee machine.

271
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:36,117
Well you make one damn fine cup
of coffee, sir.

272
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:37,867
Want to see something cool?

273
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:40,247
Yeah.

274
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,674
Not bad, man.

275
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,718
-You did this?
-Yeah.

276
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,359
Industrial polycarbonate.

277
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,941
What the hell is "Industrial polycarbonate"?

278
00:18:54,728 --> 00:18:57,700
It's the stuff they use to make shark tanks.

279
00:18:57,982 --> 00:19:00,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing man?

280
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:01,481
Put that thing away, are you crazy?

281
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,823
Come on, don't be a pussy.

282
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,769
What are  you going to do?

283
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:14,561
Oh, dude!

284
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:17,405
That was awesome. What is that stuff?

285
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,269
How does that wor...oh, what
are you going to do now?

286
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:23,297
-And...
-Whoa!

287
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,197
That is some bad hard shit, dude.

288
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:30,557
Yep. Your dad made me do this kind of
stuff over the last few years.

289
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:35,010
That is the balls.

290
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:41,008
The old man was getting paranoid, huh?

291
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:42,648
-You like that?
-Yeah.

292
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:43,904
Check this out.

293
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,781
You drew all these?

294
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,610
This is awesome.

295
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,793
Kato, you a really good drawer.

296
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:00,042
This is really impressive.

297
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:02,896
Thanks. That's the stuff I would
really like to do.

298
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:04,235
Holy!

299
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,749
Kato, are you a pervert?

300
00:20:07,294 --> 00:20:09,570
'Course I could draw stuff like that sexy.

301
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,462
-Beer?
-Yeah, I'd love a beer, sure.

302
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:29,364
Thank you.

303
00:20:37,564 --> 00:20:38,913
Hey, Kato.

304
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:41,837
What did you think of my father?

305
00:20:42,352 --> 00:20:43,680
Was fine.

306
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:47,045
Come on, just tell me.

307
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,335
He was my boss.

308
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:50,044
Nobody loves their boss.

309
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:53,001
Don't sugar coat this, Kato.
You're not going to offend me.

310
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,305
Just tell me.

311
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:55,562
Man to man.

312
00:20:56,815 --> 00:20:58,322
He was a bit of a dick.

313
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:02,329
Yep.

314
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:09,334
You are...look at that.

315
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,952
I am, a genius.

316
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:13,076
You are a genius.

317
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:15,059
You're a mad genius.

318
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,127
I like classical music.

319
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:19,054
You're a genius who likes classical music.

320
00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:21,844
You know what you are? You're a
human Swiss army knife.

321
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:23,720
I don't know what that mean.

322
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:25,615
It's a little thing that you keep pulling out things.

323
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:27,677
And just when you think there couldn't be anymore...

324
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:31,893
cool things, a new cool things come out. And
that's you. You even are dressed like one.

325
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,518
You could put a little plus on your chest.

326
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,460
-Let's drink more.
-Yeah, let's drink.

327
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:39,026
-Gam Bei. (Cheers)
-Gam Bei, yeah.

328
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:41,092
(Speaking Chinese)

329
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,317
You're speaking Chinese right now.

330
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:44,213
Oh, shit sorry.

331
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:48,360
I spend three weeks making new bumper
for his Rolls Royce.

332
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:52,048
And the day after I finished, he crashed it.

333
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,570
He actually saying it was my fault.

334
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:56,528
He swing at me.

335
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:58,511
That sounds like him.

336
00:21:58,857 --> 00:22:01,779
Let's investigate another story
of the ten million I have.

337
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,740
I'm young.

338
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:08,250
Guys are picking on a girl at school, I try to stop it.

339
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:09,255
I get in trouble.

340
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:12,354
What does my dad do? He takes my favorite toy.

341
00:22:12,355 --> 00:22:14,903
And he rips the head off of it, right
in front of me.

342
00:22:14,904 --> 00:22:16,302
And he throws it in the garbage.

343
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:18,818
I was trying to help. That's
all I was trying to do.

344
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:21,155
You know, it's unbelievable.

345
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:22,155
He...

346
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:25,700
He's an ass his entire life. And you know, they...

347
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:28,319
they built him a statue. I just don't think...

348
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:32,320
people are going to look at it and
think he's great but he's not.

349
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:34,758
It's, it's totally unfair.

350
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:37,018
There's no justice.

351
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,731
-Well, Kato.
-Hmm.

352
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:46,573
What do you say we get ourselves
some godamn justice, huh?

353
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,345
-You serious?
-Totally serious.

354
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:50,752
Let's do something crazy man.

355
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:51,933
Let's just do something nuts!

356
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:53,343
-Okay.
-Lets just do it.

357
00:22:53,344 --> 00:22:54,693
-Okay.
-Yeah.

358
00:23:03,988 --> 00:23:05,361
Let's roll, Kato.

359
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:21,804
You think it makes me happy to do this, Dad?

360
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:36,544
Come here.

361
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:48,519
Oh, this looks ominous.

362
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,739
Ah shit, oh no.

363
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:11,579
What will I do? What will I do?

364
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:12,944
Okay.

365
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:16,807
HEY! Leave them alone.

366
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,850
Let's get him.

367
00:24:19,017 --> 00:24:20,333
Oh shit!

368
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,473
I made a mistake.

369
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:27,786
Shit!

370
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:31,946
Hey, ha' .. was a set up.

371
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:41,201
Okay, okay, no!

372
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:42,810
I'm going to give him a root canal.

373
00:24:42,811 --> 00:24:44,069
-I don't want one.
-Just cut him.

374
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:48,712
Open wi...

375
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:53,051
-You're a dead man.
-Come on, lets go.

376
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:35,294
Britt, behind you.

377
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:43,804
Eat shit.

378
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:49,133
Get rid of it.

379
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,190
Wait. Wait for me, wait.

380
00:25:58,509 --> 00:25:59,994
Go, go, go, go.
I'm in, I'm in.

381
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,105
Kato, that was crazy.

382
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:05,303
That's unbelievable.

383
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:06,800
Holy shit.

384
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:08,440
Oh my god, Kato.

385
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:17,997
Shit, Britt.

386
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:19,926
Oh no, oh no.

387
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:20,946
Are you a good driver?

388
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,086
Are you kidding me.

389
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:24,983
When I was a kid, we had some...

390
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,389
-Kato, not now, just drive.
-Okay, okay.

391
00:26:32,803 --> 00:26:34,677
-Just stay cool.
-What will I do?

392
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:35,749
Just act casual.

393
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,050
Pull it over, now!

394
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:40,085
What you doing?

395
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:41,595
I'm trying to loose him.

396
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,862
Aw man there he comes.

397
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:46,112
Here he comes.

398
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:52,067
Show me your hands.

399
00:26:59,523 --> 00:27:00,955
He tried to kill us.

400
00:27:01,306 --> 00:27:02,788
We're the bad guys, shit.

401
00:27:04,027 --> 00:27:05,547
We're really in a fix.

402
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:17,758
Oh, no.

403
00:27:25,418 --> 00:27:27,460
Oh, damn it.

404
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:30,561
Kato,...

405
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:33,878
I think this is the greatest moment of my entire life.

406
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:36,434
I know. Mine too.

407
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:58,381
We are good.

408
00:27:58,382 --> 00:28:00,816
That was crazy. How did you do that dude?

409
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:02,892
You beat the crap out of those guys.

410
00:28:02,893 --> 00:28:05,018
Where I grew up, it was very dangerous.

411
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:08,283
I got to learn to fight when I was just a kid.

412
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:10,911
That was like, you knew where people were
without even looking.

413
00:28:10,912 --> 00:28:13,408
-You were so fast.
-My heart starts pumping.

414
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:16,308
It's almost like time...slows...down.

415
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:18,316
It's unbelievable, you truly are.

416
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,741
You hear me, Dad?

417
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:20,903
We did it.

418
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:22,559
That was amazing.

419
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:24,224
Kato, I'm serious.

420
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,479
I would get real with you.

421
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:29,156
So just go with this.

422
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:30,938
It might get weird and intimate,

423
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:33,517
but just accept me, okay?

424
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:34,930
What we did tonight?

425
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:37,231
Was fantastic.

426
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:38,358
It was amazing.

427
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,989
We saved those people, man.

428
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,213
We saved their lives.

429
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:43,680
So here's what I'm saying.

430
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:45,353
We keep doing this.

431
00:28:45,354 --> 00:28:47,727
You can beat the crap out of
a million dudes at once.

432
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:50,307
'Cause you can freeze time or something,
when your heart starts pumping.

433
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:52,354
We do that every night, I'm saying.

434
00:28:52,837 --> 00:28:54,150
Kato.
Kato?

435
00:28:56,603 --> 00:29:00,584
*(Sings) We could be heroes.*

436
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:02,180
Hey, hey, hey. Look, look.

437
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:04,749
We're on television.

438
00:29:05,886 --> 00:29:07,128
We're on T.V.

439
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:10,341
-Was captured in this surveillance tape.
-Look at me.

440
00:29:10,342 --> 00:29:14,021
-Where am I?
-I don't know.
-That was confronted by, but managed to escape.

441
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:16,548
I'm to fast for T.V.

442
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:18,094
Yes, exactly.

443
00:29:18,095 --> 00:29:20,700
Desecrated and this within days..

444
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:23,542
We saved those people, and they just
talk about his stupid head.

445
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:27,118
How can we be heroes if
they think we're criminals?

446
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,751
Are considered armed, and dangerous.

447
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:37,896
Okay, think about this, Kato.

448
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:43,595
What is the one insanely stupid thing
every super hero has in common?

449
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,599
Tights.

450
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
No.

451
00:29:46,873 --> 00:29:47,873
Cape.

452
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:49,254
No, Kato.

453
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:52,892
It's that every one knows
that they're the good guy.

454
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:54,368
The hero, you know.

455
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:57,303
All the bad guy has to do is
start capping some innocent people.

456
00:29:57,304 --> 00:29:59,962
And he's got the good guy by the nuts.
He's got to do whatever he says.

457
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:02,370
It's in every movie. It's in every comic book.

458
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:04,477
It's in everything. It's so stupid.

459
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:07,397
But, if the bad guy thought the good guy,

460
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:08,756
was also a bad guy.

461
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:11,516
He wouldn't be able to do that.
That's what we'll do differently.

462
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:14,091
We will pose as villains.

463
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:16,092
But we'll act like heroes.

464
00:30:16,093 --> 00:30:18,608
But then the police, and the bad guys,

465
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,276
will both try to kill us.

466
00:30:20,627 --> 00:30:22,223
We're dead already, Kato.

467
00:30:22,794 --> 00:30:24,942
I mean, seriously you wouldn't...

468
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:28,345
Look at us. We've both been completely
wasting our potential.

469
00:30:28,643 --> 00:30:30,463
You a little bit more than me.

470
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,128
I mean, what do you want your
autobiography to be called?

471
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:35,748
Oil changes, and cappuccino’s?

472
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:40,421
Because I think, "Balls deep, in shit kicking dudes".

473
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:44,022
By Kato. Is a much cooler sounding book.

474
00:30:44,023 --> 00:30:46,246
I would read that book, and
I don't read shit.

475
00:30:46,247 --> 00:30:48,198
But when they've adapted it into a movie.

476
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,826
I would see the shit out of it.

477
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:51,198
Kato.

478
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:53,240
You should never make coffee for anyone again.

479
00:30:53,241 --> 00:30:54,246
It's a waste of your talent.

480
00:30:54,247 --> 00:30:56,755
It's not dying that you need to be afraid of.

481
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:59,354
It's never having lived in the first place.

482
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:06,249
It did feel good. Saving those people.

483
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,780
Well technically I saved them,
but you helped, I guess. Yeah.

484
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:11,222
-Whatever.
-Whatever. Let's not get technical.

485
00:31:11,223 --> 00:31:13,368
But why would people take us serious?

486
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:15,386
We're just two guys who stole a head.

487
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:19,986
Hmm?

488
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:24,039
I know how to make them take us seriously.

489
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:33,557
All right, gentlemen.
Here ye, here ye.

490
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,650
The court is in session.

491
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,484
Let's talk shop, okay.

492
00:31:36,823 --> 00:31:38,192
Shall we?

493
00:31:39,417 --> 00:31:40,621
Who is this guy?

494
00:31:41,623 --> 00:31:42,763
Who is your friend?

495
00:31:42,764 --> 00:31:43,959
He's my man.

496
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,977
I'm not your man.

497
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,722
He's not my man, no.

498
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:48,701
He's uh, he's not my man.

499
00:31:48,702 --> 00:31:49,859
He's like, uh...

500
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,055
He's like, "My man".
He's...my...uh...

501
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:53,791
Not your...it's platonic...we're just...

502
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:56,370
Platonic friends. We're platonic male friends.

503
00:31:56,371 --> 00:31:58,792
He's my, Executive associate.

504
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:03,289
Yes, that's who he is, and that doesn't matter.

505
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,331
What does matter,

506
00:32:04,332 --> 00:32:07,346
is how we tackle this horrible incident.

507
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:10,055
It's clear to me that whoever did
this means business.

508
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:11,286
And this is just the beginning.

509
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:12,745
Talking about business.

510
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:15,585
This vandalizing business, oh I get it.

511
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:19,111
Listen, let's not blow this thing
out of proportion.

512
00:32:19,112 --> 00:32:21,600
I will blow this guy in any
proportion I like.

513
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:26,247
This is my newspaper, Axford, and I
want this man on the front page of it.

514
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:28,089
I want him on the web page.

515
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,820
I want you to blog about him.

516
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:32,255
I want him on every news outlet we have.

517
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,054
I want the whole city to know,

518
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:35,761
how dangerous this man is.

519
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,296
The man that cut the head off
of my father's statue.

520
00:32:39,297 --> 00:32:40,465
Not yours.

521
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:42,926
All right.

522
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:47,326
Um, since there isn't real
info on the guys identity.

523
00:32:47,327 --> 00:32:49,748
Um, what do we call him?

524
00:33:00,842 --> 00:33:02,117
That's easy.

525
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:03,599
I got it.

526
00:33:04,813 --> 00:33:05,912
This man,

527
00:33:06,187 --> 00:33:10,484
is called,
"The Green Bee".

528
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:17,224
It's kinda lame.

529
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:19,197
Yeah, it sounds like a knitting store, or something.

530
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,793
Sounds like an energy bar.

531
00:33:20,794 --> 00:33:23,056
No, I...I...it came out wrong.

532
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:26,122
(all talking at once)

533
00:33:27,377 --> 00:33:28,364
Make it like the green decimal.

534
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:33,112
The Green Hornet.

535
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:34,880
Naw, it's more like, uh.

536
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:36,403
-What?
-What did?

537
00:33:36,404 --> 00:33:37,636
The Green Hornet.

538
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:41,149
Well that's pretty awesome.

539
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,340
Much better.

540
00:33:42,341 --> 00:33:44,216
-You guys like that?
-Yeah.

541
00:33:44,217 --> 00:33:45,824
Green Hornet it is.

542
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:48,773
-The Green Hornet.
-Okay, okay, fine.

543
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:50,745
-Fine, it's decided then.
-Yeah.

544
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:53,708
The front page of tomorrow's newspaper
will feature,

545
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:55,585
"The Green Hornet".

546
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:59,029
-Unless you like "Green Bee" better, anyone?
-Nah, no. Oh that's much worse.

547
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:00,994
Okay fine. Okay.

548
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:02,533
Let's roll, Kato.

549
00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:08,650
It's going to be a long night.

550
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,172
I am.

551
00:34:30,421 --> 00:34:32,205
We need to think of a cool name for you.

552
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:33,486
The little stinger.

553
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:34,529
I'm the Green Hornet.

554
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,582
You're my little stinger.

555
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:36,583
No way.

556
00:34:37,437 --> 00:34:38,888
The Honey Pot.

557
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,303
Get it. Bee's make honey.
You're my honey pot.

558
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:44,361
It's my homes.

559
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:50,396
Decapitated statues?

560
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:52,287
I've decapitated real people.

561
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,002
You know, I wouldn't worry about it.

562
00:34:54,565 --> 00:34:56,770
You don't need their fucking business.

563
00:34:58,024 --> 00:34:59,236
I'm not worried.

564
00:35:00,502 --> 00:35:01,880
Who told you I'm worried?

565
00:35:02,575 --> 00:35:07,044
D.A. Scanlon, D.A. Scanlon. With the nightclub bombing
last week, and now this Green Hornet guy.

566
00:35:07,044 --> 00:35:09,700
I understand the streets might not be as safe
as you're make them out to be.

567
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:13,914
Guys, guys. Stop, stop connecting
separate dots with invisible lines.

568
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:16,272
This Green Hornet thing, is just a prank.

569
00:35:16,602 --> 00:35:18,474
Now what you guys should be reporting on is,

570
00:35:18,475 --> 00:35:21,787
that with this public office, crime is down significantly
in the city of Los Angeles.

571
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:23,697
Thank you.

572
00:35:52,748 --> 00:35:53,748
-Hi.
-Hi.

573
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,837
I'm Lenore Case.

574
00:35:55,997 --> 00:35:58,658
I'm the temp for Mr. Reid's secretarial position.

575
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,432
Today's my first day.

576
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:03,060
Oh, nice to meet you.

577
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,084
I'm Kato.

578
00:36:04,656 --> 00:36:06,090
It's my first day, too.

579
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:08,019
Really, well nice to meet you.

580
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,899
Do you work for Mr. Reid?

581
00:36:10,164 --> 00:36:12,405
I'm his, Executive Associate.

582
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:14,506
Wow, that must be great.

583
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:15,762
Yeah, it is.

584
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:17,193
So far.

585
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:19,938
Kato, I've a really important question for you.

586
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:24,569
Uh, who is the Hottie-Boom-Body who's
standing right behind me, right now?

587
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,351
I'm kidding, hi I'm Britt Reid.

588
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:29,067
-I own this newspaper, what's going on?
-It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

589
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:30,739
-I'm Lenore Case.
-Thanks...Oh.

590
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,625
I've been sent to you to be your temp
until you find a secretary.

591
00:36:34,216 --> 00:36:35,216
Aaah.

592
00:36:36,938 --> 00:36:37,938
Jackpot.

593
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,191
Right this way.

594
00:36:39,317 --> 00:36:40,321
So.

595
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:44,208
Got one, why don't you tell me.

596
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:48,837
How do you feel about the state of this newspaper?

597
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:51,783
As it stands, today.

598
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:52,857
Give.

599
00:36:53,054 --> 00:36:56,787
To be honest, this paper has taken
a dip in the last few years.

600
00:36:56,788 --> 00:36:59,175
-In quality and ambition.
-Really?

601
00:36:59,305 --> 00:37:02,704
Well, of course the entire industry has
taken a hit because of the internet.

602
00:37:02,705 --> 00:37:06,684
So there's a lot of pressure to
print easy to digest articles.

603
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:09,121
And it is THE last family owned paper in the city.

604
00:37:09,122 --> 00:37:12,424
And one of the only ones not attached to
a conglomerate in the entire country.

605
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:13,525
So it's understandable.

606
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:16,715
-Conglomerate?
-But the Sentinel used to really use its independence,

607
00:37:16,716 --> 00:37:18,482
to be brazen at the very least.

608
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:21,366
Like that article that your father wrote,
just after the night club bombing.

609
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:25,152
That was real reporting. That is the kind
of article that can really make a difference.

610
00:37:26,212 --> 00:37:29,050
Wow. That was good. You know a
lot about this shit.

611
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,836
I, I studied journalism. I have a minor in criminology.

612
00:37:32,837 --> 00:37:34,103
-Really?
-Yeah.

613
00:37:34,306 --> 00:37:35,747
Criminology.

614
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,438
Study the criminal mind.

615
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:39,656
What are your thoughts on this
Green Hornet character?

616
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:41,196
Give.

617
00:37:41,855 --> 00:37:45,079
-Um, well first off, there's two kinds of criminals.
-Okay.

618
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,467
There's the psycho ego-maniac and the power maniac.

619
00:37:48,468 --> 00:37:50,029
He uh, he seems to be the second,

620
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,244
-Because he defies the media.
-Excuse me, what do you think he'll do next?

621
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:57,011
Yeah, that's. Uh, what is his next move,
is what I was going to ask.

622
00:37:58,403 --> 00:37:59,403
(mouths) Write it down.

623
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:02,621
Well, he'll probably try to appropriate more power.

624
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:05,370
You know, he'll hit somebody on their own turf.

625
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:07,435
Basically he'll start out small.

626
00:38:07,436 --> 00:38:08,977
And then he'll work his way up to the top.

627
00:38:08,978 --> 00:38:11,615
That's what John Gotti did to Paul Costellano in '85.

628
00:38:12,214 --> 00:38:13,680
-And it worked?
-Yes.

629
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:16,246
Wow, look at you.

630
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:18,497
You really know a lot about this stuff.

631
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:20,430
And you're lovely and beautiful.

632
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,844
I was just sitting here, thinking.

633
00:38:21,845 --> 00:38:24,323
Why are you only pursuing this in your, uh...

634
00:38:25,654 --> 00:38:27,594
Kato, help me out here, uh....

635
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,086
Twilight.

636
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:33,904
-Twilight?
-Yeah.

637
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,271
I, I saw the movie but I don't see how...

638
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:38,965
Oh no, no, not like that.

639
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:39,988
Not, not like the movie.

640
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,350
I guess if we were doing movies, it would be more like...

641
00:38:42,663 --> 00:38:44,253
Uh, Cocoon.

642
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,116
Or, something like that.

643
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:48,969
Later in ones years.

644
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,555
What, I'm only 36.

645
00:38:50,556 --> 00:38:51,841
(Whispers) Thirty six?

646
00:38:51,842 --> 00:38:53,918
Holy shit, that's crazy.

647
00:38:53,918 --> 00:38:57,721
I thought you were like 31 tops.
I didn't know we can hire 36 year olds.

648
00:38:57,725 --> 00:38:59,452
We'll have to build a ramp, huh?

649
00:38:59,935 --> 00:39:01,361
Why, why now?

650
00:39:01,362 --> 00:39:02,681
She doesn't want to tell you.

651
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:04,420
I don't think you know what you're
talking about, Kato.

652
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:05,901
No, Mr. Kato is right.

653
00:39:05,902 --> 00:39:07,934
I do not feel comfortable discussing this.

654
00:39:07,935 --> 00:39:10,329
And if this means I am not going
to be your temp any longer?

655
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,897
Then I'm sorry, it's...

656
00:39:11,898 --> 00:39:13,251
That's exactly what it means.

657
00:39:14,843 --> 00:39:16,775
-Yep.
-Okay, thank you.

658
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:20,051
'Cause you are now my permanent secretary.

659
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:23,288
Here is what has gone down, Lenore.

660
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:25,115
You've displayed two things.

661
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:26,586
Balls.

662
00:39:26,768 --> 00:39:28,707
And there's one thing I like on my women.

663
00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:31,323
(Whispers) It's balls.

664
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,156
Please me my permanent secretary.

665
00:39:33,157 --> 00:39:34,184
Are you kidding me?

666
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:36,761
I'm not kidding. This is how I do it,
this is how I roll.

667
00:39:36,762 --> 00:39:38,222
Every day, all day.

668
00:39:38,223 --> 00:39:39,975
I make it rain like this, okay.

669
00:39:39,976 --> 00:39:41,535
I want you to come work for me.

670
00:39:41,611 --> 00:39:42,868
Just say yes. Just say yes.

671
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:44,202
-Really?
-Don't think, just say yes.

672
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:46,256
-Okay, I'll do it, yes.
-Thank you, yes!

673
00:39:46,257 --> 00:39:47,792
-This is so exciting.
-It is exciting.

674
00:39:47,793 --> 00:39:49,540
-Mr. Kato thank you so much.
-Don't thank him.

675
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:52,779
-He did nothing.
-Thank you, I promise I will not disappoint you.

676
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,820
-I don't think you will.
-I will definitely do research.

677
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:56,605
-Good, good.
-I will do fact checking, spell checking.

678
00:39:56,606 --> 00:39:58,192
-Anything that you need.
-Perfect, well...

679
00:39:58,193 --> 00:40:01,719
why don't you get started on more
Green Hornet research. Actually that's perfect.

680
00:40:02,105 --> 00:40:04,161
Bam! She is hot!

681
00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:05,482
It's crazy how hot she is.

682
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,098
-She's listening.
-Did you write down
everything that she said?

683
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:08,115
-I think.
-Let me see.

684
00:40:09,738 --> 00:40:10,738
Pervert.

685
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:12,956
Let's get to work, Kato.

686
00:40:14,509 --> 00:40:15,873
All right, we got a plan.

687
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:17,907
We start small, work our way up to the top.

688
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:18,911
Okay.

689
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:21,218
We'll need a car.

690
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,651
Hell's yes, we'll need a car.

691
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:24,080
With internal weapons.

692
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:27,389
-Armor.
-Cool rims, spinning rims.

693
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,623
Slurpee machine.

694
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:30,193
A horn that plays La Cucaracha.

695
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,123
It'll be loaded up the ass with cool shit.

696
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,140
-I can do that.
-Kato, I want you to take my hand.

697
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,639
And I want you to come
with me on this adventure.

698
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:39,024
I'll go with you.

699
00:40:39,025 --> 00:40:40,962
But I don't want to touch you.

700
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:42,250
Okay, you don't have to take my hand.

701
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:43,724
But will you come with me on this adventure?

702
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:46,561
* The White Stripes: Blue Orchid*

703
00:40:56,748 --> 00:41:02,136
*Something better than nothing, is giving up.
You needed the something. *

704
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:06,205
*So I gave you the truth from showing up*

705
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:08,166
*How dare you*

706
00:41:09,892 --> 00:41:12,824
*How old are you now anyway?*

707
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,563
*How dare you*

708
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:18,918
*How old are you now anyway?*

709
00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:22,682
This one.

710
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:26,012
This will kill a bad girl.

711
00:41:26,013 --> 00:41:27,013
*How dare you*

712
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:31,225
*How old are you now anyway?*
-Kato!

713
00:41:31,226 --> 00:41:33,235
Come closer.

714
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:34,581
I have an idea for the car.

715
00:41:35,302 --> 00:41:36,573
Ejector seats.

716
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:38,255
Ejector seats?

717
00:41:38,305 --> 00:41:40,061
You don't think it's a good idea?

718
00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:44,432
-Hello.
-Hello.

719
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:52,495
*You got a reaction.*

720
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:56,087
*You got a reaction, didn't you?*

721
00:41:56,088 --> 00:41:58,447
*You took a white orchid,*

722
00:41:59,174 --> 00:42:02,688
*You took a white orchid, turned it blue*

723
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:04,417
*Something better than nothing.*

724
00:42:05,613 --> 00:42:08,879
*Something better than nothing
Is giving up*

725
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,189
*You needed the something*

726
00:42:12,093 --> 00:42:15,253
*You got a reaction, didn't you?*

727
00:42:15,254 --> 00:42:17,237
*You took a white orchid,*

728
00:42:18,337 --> 00:42:21,528
*You took a white orchid, turned it blue.*

729
00:42:21,529 --> 00:42:23,167
I'm so excited right now.

730
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,347
I can't wait.

731
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,932
Aw, man. What the hell?

732
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:33,161
Watch your feet.

733
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:36,026
The glory of the Black Beauty.

734
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:40,787
Damn. It's beautiful.

735
00:42:41,945 --> 00:42:43,205
It's black.

736
00:42:43,717 --> 00:42:44,717
Wow.

737
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,025
Incredible.

738
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:57,235
Oh, dude. We're forgetting something very important.

739
00:42:58,682 --> 00:42:59,933
Watch this.

740
00:43:04,645 --> 00:43:06,276
That is so wicked.

741
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,933
*Coolio: Gangsta's Paradise*

742
00:43:10,237 --> 00:43:13,266
*As I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death,*

743
00:43:13,267 --> 00:43:14,795
*I take a look at my life,*

744
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:16,667
*And realize there's nothing left,*

745
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:19,237
*'Cause I've been blasting and laughing so long*

746
00:43:19,238 --> 00:43:22,431
*That even my momma thinks that my mind has gone.*

747
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:27,903
*Tell me why are we, so blind to see *

748
00:43:27,904 --> 00:43:34,063
*That the ones we hurt, are you and me*

749
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:38,944
*Been spending most our lives living in the Gangs.....*

750
00:43:39,307 --> 00:43:40,308
Where are we going?

751
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:42,056
I have no idea, I thought you knew.

752
00:43:42,308 --> 00:43:44,266
Oh, Okay. I got an idea.

753
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:45,403
Okay.

754
00:43:48,305 --> 00:43:49,438
Mr. Reids' office.

755
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,927
(Lecherous voice)
I'm looking at you.

756
00:43:51,928 --> 00:43:53,665
-What?
-I'm totally joking.

757
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:54,785
Britt Reid, calling.

758
00:43:55,123 --> 00:43:57,670
Burning the candle at both ends, I see.

759
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:01,296
Wouldn't Mr. Case be upset with that?

760
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,106
There is no Mr. Case.

761
00:44:04,638 --> 00:44:06,256
Well that's not why I'm calling.

762
00:44:06,564 --> 00:44:08,272
I'm actually calling because, uh.

763
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,327
Remember seeing all that Green Hornet research?

764
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:12,112
You know, predicting what he might do next.

765
00:44:12,113 --> 00:44:14,431
If you could just send us that. Those crime maps.

766
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:15,970
-Oh, yeah.
-That would be really helpful.

767
00:44:15,971 --> 00:44:18,272
-Just fax it on over.
-Yes, hold on a second, please.

768
00:44:18,273 --> 00:44:19,759
And it's coming right at you.

769
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,884
-If you need anything else.
-Okay.

770
00:44:23,885 --> 00:44:24,949
-You just let me know.
-Perfect.

771
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,463
-Thank you, bye, bye.

772
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:30,654
She wants me so bad, it's crazy.

773
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:37,548
-Oh.
-South Central.

774
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,465
Yeah. Okay, we got 14 homicides.

775
00:44:40,466 --> 00:44:41,827
34 assaults.

776
00:44:41,828 --> 00:44:43,435
116 and sixteen drug arrests.

777
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:44,872
This month.

778
00:44:45,156 --> 00:44:47,945
Sounds like a good place for the
Green Hornet to make his debut.

779
00:44:48,557 --> 00:44:49,561
Let's roll, Kato.

780
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:50,930
Let's roll.

781
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:55,918
This is really far east.

782
00:44:56,522 --> 00:44:58,082
Never been in this part of town.

783
00:45:00,374 --> 00:45:02,138
I think we're in the hood, Kato.

784
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:06,964
Wait, wait. Do you think we start there?

785
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:09,075
Yeah. Just like Lenore said.

786
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:10,924
Start small, work our way up.

787
00:45:11,286 --> 00:45:12,746
This is really, really intense.

788
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:16,997
-So, you don't want to do it?
-I do, I do. We should just do it fast
before we chicken out, okay?

789
00:45:16,998 --> 00:45:18,850
-I not going to chicken out.
-Who knows you might chicken out.

790
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:20,368
I know, just...just pull up to them.

791
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:21,505
I don't want to talk.

792
00:45:21,506 --> 00:45:23,026
What, they're on your side.

793
00:45:23,027 --> 00:45:24,747
-Stop yelling at me.
-Just pull it over and...

794
00:45:24,748 --> 00:45:27,249
-I barely speak English.
-You speak English right now.

795
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,771
-Okay, fine.
-This is so stupid.

796
00:45:30,046 --> 00:45:31,616
Oh, okay.

797
00:45:31,617 --> 00:45:32,616
-Calm down.
-I am calm.

798
00:45:32,616 --> 00:45:35,003
-Just shut up, this is scary....you shut up!!
-Scary, you shut up!

799
00:45:35,003 --> 00:45:37,190
-I'm just trying to be cool.
-I am cool.

800
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,057
Yo, you looking for that good stuff, man?

801
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:43,241
Hola.

802
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,967
I am The Green Hornet.

803
00:45:45,062 --> 00:45:47,197
And I would like to sit down with your boss.

804
00:45:47,198 --> 00:45:48,512
Sit on this, bitch.

805
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:52,785
Oh, God!

806
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,085
Move on!

807
00:46:04,593 --> 00:46:06,665
Bean bags.
Where the hell are the bean bags?

808
00:46:10,805 --> 00:46:11,809
Yeah!

809
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,860
YEAAAAHH!

810
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:15,542
Let me show you how it's done, Kato.

811
00:46:16,994 --> 00:46:20,598
Green...Hornet...said...hello.

812
00:46:42,621 --> 00:46:44,220
Eat my foot.

813
00:46:44,894 --> 00:46:45,894
Bitch.

814
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,175
My nuts!

815
00:46:56,007 --> 00:46:57,516
What the hell was that?

816
00:47:00,344 --> 00:47:02,461
Who do you work fo..oh god.

817
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:07,547
Who do you work for?

818
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:08,870
Shit.

819
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:11,506
Hey! You come, come here, come here.

820
00:47:11,507 --> 00:47:12,807
Hey, who do you work for?

821
00:47:12,845 --> 00:47:15,395
Chudnofsky
Same guy everybody works for.

822
00:47:15,396 --> 00:47:17,192
-Chud-what-ski?
-Chudnofsky

823
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:19,270
What kind of dumb name is that?

824
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:21,423
-Chudnofsky
-Where do you get the shit you sell for him, huh, where?

825
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:22,704
I'll never tell you that.

826
00:47:22,827 --> 00:47:24,289
Oh really, never.

827
00:47:27,141 --> 00:47:30,308
Chudnofsky's on our ass guys.
We've got to get the shit done tonight.

828
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,495
You've just been stung.

829
00:47:40,693 --> 00:47:41,693
Yeah.

830
00:47:41,694 --> 00:47:42,952
You.

831
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:45,501
This is my town, now.

832
00:47:45,502 --> 00:47:47,373
My name is 'The Green Hornet'.

833
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:50,273
Hello there, nice to meet you.

834
00:47:50,274 --> 00:47:51,642
Hello, how's it going?

835
00:47:51,927 --> 00:47:53,369
Uh, anyway.

836
00:47:53,449 --> 00:47:57,398
Tell your boss, The Green Hornet
sends his regards.

837
00:47:57,735 --> 00:47:58,735
Dude.

838
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,902
You broke my lab, man.

839
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,959
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

840
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:10,909
Let's burn this mother down, Kato.

841
00:48:28,893 --> 00:48:30,707
Explain yourself, Mr. Tupper.

842
00:48:30,903 --> 00:48:32,676
The guy was crazy, man.

843
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:35,002
I mean he drove a car through a wall.

844
00:48:35,156 --> 00:48:38,970
The thing was like a half-tank or something.
There was fire coming out of the thing.

845
00:48:39,312 --> 00:48:40,312
And?

846
00:48:41,395 --> 00:48:43,075
Oh yeah, he gave me this.

847
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:46,742
He said that this is his town now.

848
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:52,470
A man comes in, in a rented costume
and you shit your pants?

849
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,465
Look, trust me.

850
00:48:54,466 --> 00:48:57,378
A guy...grown man wearing a mask.

851
00:48:57,379 --> 00:49:00,182
Is a little bit scarier than a guy wearing a suit.

852
00:49:06,399 --> 00:49:08,308
You're not pleased with my suit?

853
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,560
Does it fail to fill you with fear?

854
00:49:13,058 --> 00:49:16,210
I'm sorry, I didn't mean any disrespect.

855
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:20,197
Do you have any idea how many great
people I've killed in my suit?

856
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:24,169
-I like your suit.
-Me too.

857
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,596
Now this is exactly what I was talking about.

858
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,686
I'm not as scary as some idiot in a green mask.

859
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:31,056
Come on!

860
00:49:31,689 --> 00:49:33,872
You say they want to take business.

861
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:37,496
Now this guy ran six of the biggest meth labs in L.A.

862
00:49:37,497 --> 00:49:39,389
Now because of that Hornet, he's dead.

863
00:49:39,975 --> 00:49:41,467
Business affected.

864
00:49:41,952 --> 00:49:45,937
Well I've got three reports of the Green Hornet
shooting on a red light here.

865
00:49:45,938 --> 00:49:50,781
I have an elderly couple that claims that the Green Hornet
gave them the finger.

866
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:55,382
The Green Hornet and his Chauffeur in a fist
fight with gang members in south central.

867
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:57,754
The Green Hornet raises a lot of questions.

868
00:49:57,755 --> 00:50:00,747
We all know that gang proliferation
has been rising in the last few years.

869
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:04,876
Okay, that'll be homework. I got a Yoga class.

870
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:10,683
Anywho, bottom line. Headlines people.
Get this story out there.

871
00:50:10,684 --> 00:50:13,645
Will the violence continue to spill out onto the streets?

872
00:50:13,646 --> 00:50:16,279
What are the police doing about him?

873
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:22,481
Is anyone safe at the mercy of
dot-dot-dot, The Green Hornet.

874
00:50:22,482 --> 00:50:24,752
And I want those dots,
I want dots in the paper.

875
00:50:24,753 --> 00:50:27,503
Mr. Reid, do you understand
that's kind of hitting it delicately?

876
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:30,174
-No.
-That D.A. Scanlon's entire reelection,

877
00:50:30,175 --> 00:50:32,431
platform is based on him cleaning up the streets.

878
00:50:32,432 --> 00:50:34,541
I know you guys are acquaintances.
So if you want to...

879
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:37,644
Oh, actually that's a great idea.
You should use that.

880
00:50:37,645 --> 00:50:39,294
Write an article about that.

881
00:50:39,295 --> 00:50:43,125
Even D.A. Scanlon is quivering at the
feet of this scourge.

882
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:44,424
Use the word, 'scourge'.

883
00:50:44,425 --> 00:50:45,868
Write an article about that.

884
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:48,341
-Britt, can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah.

885
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:50,260
Look, I know what you're tying to do here.

886
00:50:50,261 --> 00:50:53,732
Turn this newspaper into some kind of discothèque.
But it's not going to work.

887
00:50:53,733 --> 00:50:56,380
That's now what I'm doing. She's a brainy broad, dude.

888
00:50:56,381 --> 00:50:57,654
This is a serious matter.

889
00:50:57,655 --> 00:51:00,215
For every line that we print, there's repercussions.

890
00:51:00,216 --> 00:51:01,770
Somebody has to take responsibilities.

891
00:51:01,771 --> 00:51:04,208
-That's me!
-Well, I'm not afraid of these bastards.

892
00:51:04,209 --> 00:51:05,518
And you shouldn't be either.

893
00:51:06,642 --> 00:51:09,020
Their leader was Daniel, he made it to the wall.

894
00:51:09,286 --> 00:51:12,468
They killed for wanting and speculating on the drug war.

895
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,163
That's exactly what you and your
little girlfriend are doing.

896
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,403
I know that you think my
experience ain't a worth shit.

897
00:51:18,404 --> 00:51:20,659
But your father used to listen to me.
So should you.

898
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,882
This is the story I want to run.

899
00:51:22,883 --> 00:51:26,117
I'm going with it, and if you are fortunate
enough to be still with us.

900
00:51:26,118 --> 00:51:32,977
It's what, Daniel Ver...vertila, Vertila...Ver-te-lie?

901
00:51:32,978 --> 00:51:34,644
Ver-tel-lie, it's what he would have wanted, too.

902
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:35,645
Okay.

903
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,725
That's the story, team.

904
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:38,725
Run it!

905
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,305
Britt Reid, out true.

906
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:43,625
*Van Halen: Feel Your Love Tonight*

907
00:51:47,011 --> 00:51:48,011
*Alright!*

908
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:50,715
Zzzzzp, zzzp.

909
00:51:55,975 --> 00:51:59,020
*We're gettin' funny in the back of my car*

910
00:51:59,643 --> 00:52:04,517
*I'm sorry honey if I took
you just a little too far, yes*

911
00:52:04,518 --> 00:52:05,596
I want this Hornet guy!

912
00:52:05,597 --> 00:52:07,589
*Uh too, too far*

913
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:13,000
*So I, I told the fellas out behind the bar*

914
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:19,235
*So let me tell you honey just how fine you are, yes*

915
00:52:19,649 --> 00:52:21,711
*I guess you are*

916
00:52:23,008 --> 00:52:26,000
*You see I'm beggin' you pleeease*

917
00:52:26,275 --> 00:52:30,117
*beggin' on, beggin' on my knees*

918
00:52:30,601 --> 00:52:34,631
*Sayin' I can't wait to feel your love....*
-Wait, don't, don't, don't!

919
00:52:34,632 --> 00:52:35,966
Camera got us.

920
00:52:41,632 --> 00:52:42,985
What camera?

921
00:52:46,073 --> 00:52:50,853
The Green Hornet and his masked accomplish
started major trouble in the southland today.

922
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:58,299
-Kato, is in the house.
-Yes.

923
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,667
I just checked the Hornet mail.

924
00:52:59,668 --> 00:53:02,226
Nothing new, but they'll be a knocking.

925
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:03,988
-Sounds great.
-Yeah.

926
00:53:05,428 --> 00:53:07,261
-I have something for you.
-Really?

927
00:53:07,262 --> 00:53:08,269
Awesome.

928
00:53:12,353 --> 00:53:13,608
Dear Britt,

929
00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:16,668
You are my, xiongdì .
What's xiongdì ?

930
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,490
Brother.

931
00:53:18,491 --> 00:53:20,173
That's awfully nice.

932
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,356
I've never had a brother, man.
I've always wanted one.

933
00:53:27,623 --> 00:53:29,388
Whoa!

934
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:31,281
What the hell is this?

935
00:53:31,282 --> 00:53:32,392
It's a gas gun.

936
00:53:32,393 --> 00:53:33,736
Your Hornet gun!

937
00:53:34,142 --> 00:53:35,628
-A gas gun?
-Yeah.

938
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,550
Why not a gun, gun?

939
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:39,391
Our enemies have gun, guns.

940
00:53:39,392 --> 00:53:42,564
What, I don't understand, why, what are these?

941
00:53:42,565 --> 00:53:44,587
What is this? What are these?
These paint balls?

942
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,086
No, these are filled with knock-out gas.

943
00:53:47,088 --> 00:53:49,174
That is insane. Where's yours?

944
00:53:49,175 --> 00:53:51,584
Do you have one? Do have a black
version or something?

945
00:53:51,585 --> 00:53:52,787
No, just you.

946
00:53:53,033 --> 00:53:54,775
-No?
-No.

947
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,434
Well why not? Why just me?

948
00:53:56,614 --> 00:53:58,876
You, you're so special.

949
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:01,721
I know I'm special, but how come
I'm the only one with a gun?

950
00:54:01,782 --> 00:54:04,083
Because you don't have much fighting experience.

951
00:54:04,084 --> 00:54:05,853
So I thought you needed a gun.

952
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,467
Well, I'll be honest, that's a little insulting, man.

953
00:54:09,468 --> 00:54:11,360
I mean I thought we were both
bad asses the other night.

954
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:14,650
I kicked that guy in the face like three times,
remember? I kicked him in the face.

955
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,653
-Yeah, I...I remember.
-Yeah.

956
00:54:17,345 --> 00:54:18,654
It makes you look cool.

957
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,077
I need to look cool now?

958
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,443
What the hell?
You said my outfit was pimp.

959
00:54:22,445 --> 00:54:24,496
I remember thinking, that's a weird
word for him to use, pimp.

960
00:54:24,497 --> 00:54:26,126
But you said it, you said it was pimp.

961
00:54:26,127 --> 00:54:26,906
-It is pimp.
-Yeah.

962
00:54:27,044 --> 00:54:29,374
The Hornet gun is just an accessory.

963
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,380
-An accessory.
-Yeah.

964
00:54:30,381 --> 00:54:33,079
Well then, you need...you need nun chucks then.

965
00:54:33,828 --> 00:54:35,642
If you don't like it, don't use it.

966
00:54:35,643 --> 00:54:37,086
No, let me...how does it work?

967
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,960
Shit!

968
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:43,845
It works.

969
00:54:55,302 --> 00:54:57,867
KATO!
Kato!

970
00:54:57,868 --> 00:54:58,904
Over here.

971
00:55:01,751 --> 00:55:03,493
Hey, you're awake.

972
00:55:03,494 --> 00:55:04,774
What the hell, what happened to me?

973
00:55:04,775 --> 00:55:06,874
What's happening?
What happened?

974
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:08,733
You shot yourself in the face, by mistake.

975
00:55:09,334 --> 00:55:12,112
Ho...ho..how long was I out? What time is it?

976
00:55:12,615 --> 00:55:13,615
Two o'clock.

977
00:55:14,357 --> 00:55:16,313
Oh, that's not so bad, I guess.

978
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,079
On Thursday.

979
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:21,453
It's Thursday, are you kid...it's not Monday right now?

980
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:22,719
No, I'm sorry.

981
00:55:30,006 --> 00:55:31,703
Did you put this diaper on me?

982
00:55:37,272 --> 00:55:38,272
Well what did I miss?

983
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:39,798
Nothing, really.

984
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:41,853
I did some work on the Black Beauties.

985
00:55:41,854 --> 00:55:42,853
Beau-tie's?

986
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:45,991
Holy crap.

987
00:55:45,992 --> 00:55:47,335
Back-ups.

988
00:55:47,976 --> 00:55:50,172
How the hell did you do this in four days?

989
00:55:50,437 --> 00:55:52,139
It's been eleven days.

990
00:55:54,189 --> 00:55:56,136
Whoa, eleven days?

991
00:55:56,137 --> 00:55:57,545
What, are you kidding me?

992
00:55:57,546 --> 00:55:59,803
I wasn't sleeping. I was in a coma, dick.

993
00:56:00,308 --> 00:56:03,114
But it's okay now. I fixed the Hornet gas.

994
00:56:03,115 --> 00:56:04,876
The gas only lasts one hour.

995
00:56:04,877 --> 00:56:05,838
Can I see it?

996
00:56:06,182 --> 00:56:09,589
-Okay, but be careful this time.
-I'll be careful, I just want to look at it.

997
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:11,831
Just give to me for one second and I'll just...

998
00:56:15,852 --> 00:56:16,986
See you in a hour.

999
00:56:16,987 --> 00:56:19,011
-Mr. Reid.
-Hey.

1000
00:56:19,012 --> 00:56:20,085
Welcome back.

1001
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:21,762
I'm so glad you're feeling better.

1002
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,135
I heard that Mono is the worst.

1003
00:56:24,136 --> 00:56:25,139
Mono?

1004
00:56:27,182 --> 00:56:30,442
Yeah, well it's uh, better than herpes, right?

1005
00:56:30,443 --> 00:56:32,184
-Here are you messages.
-Thank you.

1006
00:56:32,185 --> 00:56:33,819
I have some meeting's I'd like to set up with you.

1007
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,639
Okay, cool, great.

1008
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,729
Here is the research that you asked for.

1009
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,927
Oooo, Green Hornet, me likee.

1010
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,232
D.A. Scanlon called, he said
that he really needs to speak to you.

1011
00:56:45,233 --> 00:56:46,362
Boring.

1012
00:56:46,363 --> 00:56:47,703
Let me look at this stuff.

1013
00:57:02,347 --> 00:57:06,112
Thought maybe we could go to dinner,
or get a drink. Blow off some steam.

1014
00:57:06,365 --> 00:57:08,896
Yeah, I would love to.

1015
00:57:13,753 --> 00:57:14,753
So.

1016
00:57:17,793 --> 00:57:19,679
Perfect, I'll be there.

1017
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:25,325
That was awesome.

1018
00:57:25,326 --> 00:57:26,673
Hey, Kato!

1019
00:57:26,674 --> 00:57:28,428
Can you make me some coffee.

1020
00:57:31,696 --> 00:57:35,972
I know you don't have your whole operations set up.
Whatever you can whip up will be great.

1021
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:40,562
Lenore have you had this little
bastards coffee?

1022
00:57:40,562 --> 00:57:42,366
'Cause it is,
scrumdiddlyumptious.

1023
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:44,128
The only way to describe it. You want a cup?

1024
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:45,080
I'm fine, thank you.

1025
00:57:45,081 --> 00:57:47,326
So that's just one cup of coffee, Kato.

1026
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,112
So, there's this restaurant.

1027
00:57:50,113 --> 00:57:52,353
That just opened in the San Fernando valley,

1028
00:57:52,354 --> 00:57:56,163
and it's called,
La Maison de lavuad.

1029
00:57:56,164 --> 00:57:59,343
And the whole thing, you eat
your meal in total darkness.

1030
00:57:59,344 --> 00:58:03,666
So with your deprived sight, each bite
is like a orgasm in your mouth.

1031
00:58:03,808 --> 00:58:06,929
-And I was thinking maybe it would be.
-Mr. Reid's office.

1032
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:09,860
This is D.A. Scanlon calling for Britt Reid, please.

1033
00:58:10,031 --> 00:58:12,746
Hello sir, yes I'm aware you've been calling.

1034
00:58:12,747 --> 00:58:14,425
He's, he's had Mono.

1035
00:58:14,426 --> 00:58:17,792
Well let me take a look. Maybe there's a
good chance we can work that out later.

1036
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,645
-Ow!
-If you ever tell me to get you coffee again.

1037
00:58:24,624 --> 00:58:25,636
I'll beat the shit out of you.

1038
00:58:25,637 --> 00:58:28,264
What are you?
What is wrong with you, are you crazy?

1039
00:58:28,265 --> 00:58:30,886
This is our plan. You're suppose to work for me.

1040
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:33,157
You got me a java juice.

1041
00:58:33,158 --> 00:58:36,587
We're suppose to be bothers, man.
We're suppose to be Shon-dee.

1042
00:58:36,587 --> 00:58:38,180
What happened with that?

1043
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,947
-Huh?
-I'm sorry.

1044
00:58:40,496 --> 00:58:41,840
You should be sorry.

1045
00:58:41,841 --> 00:58:43,674
I know it's complicated being super heroes,

1046
00:58:43,675 --> 00:58:45,258
and there's a lot of stress involved with that.

1047
00:58:45,259 --> 00:58:47,665
But you don't got to freak out about it,
do you, okay?

1048
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:49,738
I'll have the coffee au lait.

1049
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:51,667
I'm joking. I'm totally joking.

1050
00:58:52,364 --> 00:58:53,708
You're still mad at me, Kato?

1051
00:58:54,162 --> 00:58:55,984
-No.
-Good.

1052
00:58:55,985 --> 00:58:57,797
'Cause you shouldn't be, anyway.

1053
00:58:58,362 --> 00:59:01,472
What's up with Lenore. Is she acting weird around me?

1054
00:59:01,767 --> 00:59:02,767
No, why?

1055
00:59:02,768 --> 00:59:03,885
I like, like her.

1056
00:59:03,886 --> 00:59:06,795
And I can't nail her. She's completely unnailable.

1057
00:59:06,796 --> 00:59:09,318
It's I mean, it's a terrible fact.
I don't know what to do.

1058
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:10,366
She doesn't like you.

1059
00:59:10,367 --> 00:59:11,905
Why would you even want her?

1060
00:59:11,906 --> 00:59:15,080
I do, maybe it's because she doesn’t like me.
Isn't that sick.

1061
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:16,439
That could be it.

1062
00:59:17,282 --> 00:59:19,182
Girls are such a drag, Kato.

1063
00:59:19,183 --> 00:59:20,611
Thank god we have each other.

1064
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:23,584
Hey, I'm calling a boys night.

1065
00:59:23,585 --> 00:59:24,938
What do you say, huh?

1066
00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:26,084
What are you doing?

1067
00:59:26,085 --> 00:59:29,966
I didn't know you wanted to hang out.
I'm going for a drink with a friend.

1068
00:59:30,505 --> 00:59:32,535
Friend, who, come on?

1069
00:59:33,414 --> 00:59:34,414
Tony.

1070
00:59:35,194 --> 00:59:36,194
Tony?

1071
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:38,703
Well have fun.

1072
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:48,408
-You want to try?
-No.

1073
00:59:49,177 --> 00:59:50,260
Hit the black key.

1074
00:59:50,846 --> 00:59:52,077
-Really?
-Yeah.

1075
00:59:52,831 --> 00:59:54,315
Okay, I'll give it a try. Which one?

1076
01:00:04,483 --> 01:00:09,038
You know this uh, Green Hornet thing
is just crazy, isn't it?

1077
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:11,200
I mean it's all I can think about sometimes.

1078
01:00:12,096 --> 01:00:14,175
I feel really in tuned with it.

1079
01:00:14,176 --> 01:00:15,955
Kind of like that guy with the Zodiac killer.

1080
01:00:15,956 --> 01:00:18,216
What about the man dressed in black?

1081
01:00:19,362 --> 01:00:20,362
Johnny Cash?

1082
01:00:21,006 --> 01:00:22,675
No. His partner.

1083
01:00:22,676 --> 01:00:26,133
His partner? No I don't think that, that's his partner.

1084
01:00:26,294 --> 01:00:28,430
It's probably just some thug that he hired.

1085
01:00:28,431 --> 01:00:30,338
Anyhow they'll both be dead in no time.

1086
01:00:30,657 --> 01:00:31,828
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

1087
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,025
-Why?
-Because.

1088
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,545
The Green Hornet's been attracting way to much attention.

1089
01:00:37,724 --> 01:00:40,344
Whoever is in charge is going to get tired of it.

1090
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,967
Call him in to try and make a deal with him.

1091
01:00:41,968 --> 01:00:44,787
Then kill him. It's what Gotti did to Mengala in '87.

1092
01:00:45,616 --> 01:00:48,460
Two weeks, two weeks tops.
That's what I give them.

1093
01:00:48,461 --> 01:00:49,763
-Two weeks.
-Dead.

1094
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,380
You're not going to like this.

1095
01:00:52,632 --> 01:00:53,940
But we got nothing.

1096
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,812
It's like the Green Hornet didn't exist.

1097
01:00:56,905 --> 01:00:59,736
Nobody's done a deal with him.
Nobody's done time with him.

1098
01:00:59,737 --> 01:01:01,097
Nobody's ever heard of him.

1099
01:01:01,098 --> 01:01:02,628
It's like he came out of thin air.

1100
01:01:03,069 --> 01:01:05,395
Yeah, and I gotta say.

1101
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:07,817
He's setting a bad example for the other gangs.

1102
01:01:08,307 --> 01:01:11,132
I met with the Armenians early today, they told me....

1103
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:14,986
if the Hornet is independent.
They want to be independent too.

1104
01:01:15,994 --> 01:01:17,964
The Armenians truly said that?

1105
01:01:18,543 --> 01:01:21,208
And I heard rumors the Koreans are talking the same.

1106
01:01:21,575 --> 01:01:22,921
Which Korean?

1107
01:01:23,149 --> 01:01:24,149
Kim.

1108
01:01:27,026 --> 01:01:28,026
Kim?

1109
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:31,424
No, Kim never said that.

1110
01:01:31,879 --> 01:01:34,919
We've been doing business for
twenty five years. We're friends.

1111
01:01:35,551 --> 01:01:37,158
I'm sorry boss.

1112
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:38,798
That's just shocking.

1113
01:01:39,188 --> 01:01:43,325
Maybe we should go down there and
teach them to keep their mouths shut.

1114
01:01:43,637 --> 01:01:45,129
No, no, no.

1115
01:01:45,864 --> 01:01:48,742
I should kill Kim myself. He's a friend.

1116
01:01:49,893 --> 01:01:53,066
And I'll kill the Armenians, too.
It would make me feel better.

1117
01:01:53,067 --> 01:01:54,620
Wait, wait! AAAAH!

1118
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:57,646
Great, what about, The Hornet?

1119
01:02:04,918 --> 01:02:05,918
Reid.

1120
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:08,645
What you doing here?

1121
01:02:09,114 --> 01:02:11,312
Guess what, you son of a bitch?

1122
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:15,292
We got mail.

1123
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:17,041
We got Hornet mail!

1124
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:19,188
He emailed, it happened.

1125
01:02:19,189 --> 01:02:20,709
Come here, look, come here.

1126
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,540
Look, look, look.

1127
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:24,958
Green Hornet.
(Whispers) Me.

1128
01:02:25,017 --> 01:02:27,556
Good job on the Meth lab.
Uhh!

1129
01:02:27,906 --> 01:02:30,578
The place was costing me money and I
wanted to shut it down anyway.

1130
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:34,790
That's B.S. Lets talk about another business
venture that could be mutually beneficial.

1131
01:02:34,935 --> 01:02:36,267
Please meet tomorrow.

1132
01:02:36,268 --> 01:02:39,194
At the lot on 5th and Union in downtown.

1133
01:02:39,194 --> 01:02:40,578
At 4 p.m.

1134
01:02:40,783 --> 01:02:43,556
Another adventure for, The Green Hornet,

1135
01:02:43,557 --> 01:02:45,362
and his nameless side kick.

1136
01:02:48,826 --> 01:02:50,965
Looks like we got some planning to do.

1137
01:02:51,445 --> 01:02:52,656
It could be a trap.

1138
01:02:53,028 --> 01:02:56,025
I heard Gotti killed Mangala in '87.

1139
01:02:56,931 --> 01:02:58,513
Where did you hear that from?

1140
01:02:59,945 --> 01:03:01,512
The History channel.

1141
01:03:02,423 --> 01:03:03,423
Oh yeah.

1142
01:03:03,424 --> 01:03:05,850
Should we go downtown now
and check it out?

1143
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:08,396
Uh, no. That's cool, I got that covered.

1144
01:03:08,397 --> 01:03:10,563
You just fill up the car with
weapons and stuff like that, okay.

1145
01:03:10,836 --> 01:03:14,586
So, you're just going to come
up with the plan by yourself?

1146
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:16,337
Bingo.

1147
01:03:16,881 --> 01:03:19,074
I don't know if that's the best idea.

1148
01:03:19,075 --> 01:03:21,000
-'Course you don't, Kato.
-What's that mean?

1149
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:22,714
Oh, it means that you, uh

1150
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,402
think your an awesome karate dude
that can do anything,

1151
01:03:25,403 --> 01:03:27,478
and I'm an incompetent schmuck.

1152
01:03:27,479 --> 01:03:29,954
Who needs a gun that shoots farts at people.
That's what that means.

1153
01:03:30,128 --> 01:03:32,267
I'm just saying, we should do this together.

1154
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:33,791
I'm just saying, you should go home.

1155
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:36,425
You should go to sleep, so tomorrow you could process...

1156
01:03:36,426 --> 01:03:38,470
MY incredible plan.

1157
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,491
Fine.

1158
01:03:43,996 --> 01:03:45,538
This is so stupid.

1159
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,597
We've pissed this guy off.

1160
01:03:47,598 --> 01:03:49,980
Now we are walking into a meeting on his turf.

1161
01:03:49,981 --> 01:03:51,696
We walked into their turf last time.

1162
01:03:51,697 --> 01:03:54,244
And guess what?
We kicked the living crap out of them.

1163
01:03:54,245 --> 01:03:57,270
And, everyone knows what happens
when you fool with a Hornet.

1164
01:03:57,429 --> 01:03:58,912
You get stung.

1165
01:03:58,913 --> 01:04:00,541
You get stung, what does that mean?

1166
01:04:00,783 --> 01:04:02,308
It's not a game, Britt.

1167
01:04:02,545 --> 01:04:04,563
And you are going to get us killed.

1168
01:04:04,564 --> 01:04:07,997
If you don't like my plan,
you do not have to be a part of it.

1169
01:04:07,998 --> 01:04:09,446
I don't even think you have a plan.

1170
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:11,683
I do have a plan, I just haven't told it to you yet.

1171
01:04:11,684 --> 01:04:12,710
And it's amazing.

1172
01:04:12,711 --> 01:04:16,921
Okay? So are you in?
Or are you chickening out like a, bitch?

1173
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:18,192
You are a bitch.

1174
01:04:18,193 --> 01:04:20,088
Not now, Kato. Not now, turn in here.

1175
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,119
To there, game faces Kato, game faces.

1176
01:04:30,345 --> 01:04:33,169
Here's the plan. You take this thing, you put it in your ear.

1177
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,794
You listen in on my phone,
which I've taped on my chest.

1178
01:04:35,795 --> 01:04:37,758
See, when I say the secret word,

1179
01:04:37,759 --> 01:04:39,732
which is 'Constantinople'.

1180
01:04:39,733 --> 01:04:42,724
I'll kick Yoda in the nuts,
you blow them up with the missiles.

1181
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:47,268
Whoa! Turn, get back, go, go. Okay.

1182
01:04:49,982 --> 01:04:51,487
This is not part of the plan.

1183
01:04:51,515 --> 01:04:52,632
We're sandwiched.

1184
01:05:04,256 --> 01:05:07,648
And so, thunder strikes lightly.

1185
01:05:11,778 --> 01:05:13,008
Don't get all panicky.

1186
01:05:14,832 --> 01:05:17,272
The worst thing we can do right now is panic.

1187
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:18,725
Just let me think.

1188
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:27,814
Okay, don't worry. I'll get us out of here, okay.

1189
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,722
Not to worry, we'll get it done, asswipe.

1190
01:05:30,723 --> 01:05:33,395
Well with that attitude we will come out, man.

1191
01:05:38,498 --> 01:05:39,561
I'm getting claustiphobic, Kato.

1192
01:05:39,562 --> 01:05:40,807
Okay, let me think.

1193
01:05:40,808 --> 01:05:43,058
-Oh, no. I can't breath.
-Listen, listen.

1194
01:05:47,473 --> 01:05:49,463
We're buried, we are totally buried.

1195
01:05:49,464 --> 01:05:51,020
Okay, okay.

1196
01:05:51,355 --> 01:05:52,355
What are you doing?

1197
01:05:53,038 --> 01:05:55,146
I am killing us, or saving us.

1198
01:05:55,951 --> 01:05:58,480
Whoa, whoa, missiles armed.
That's your plan?

1199
01:05:58,481 --> 01:05:59,896
You're going to blow us up, Kato.

1200
01:05:59,897 --> 01:06:02,269
That's not a good plan, disarm them, man.

1201
01:06:02,682 --> 01:06:03,826
Shall we part?

1202
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:06,857
Would you save those bombs for me.

1203
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:19,369
Chili!

1204
01:06:20,694 --> 01:06:22,856
They killed him. They killed Chili.

1205
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:28,483
Lets fly.

1206
01:06:32,261 --> 01:06:33,261
Let's run.

1207
01:06:42,487 --> 01:06:43,487
There's thorns in these bushes. Stop.

1208
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:50,485
This thing has no aim.

1209
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:52,726
-That sucks.
-You have no aim.

1210
01:06:56,196 --> 01:06:57,196
Watch!

1211
01:07:04,835 --> 01:07:05,835
What?

1212
01:07:15,283 --> 01:07:17,774
I smash window, you shoot in.

1213
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,452
Every man for himself.

1214
01:07:28,207 --> 01:07:29,207
No way.

1215
01:07:30,837 --> 01:07:31,837
DIE!

1216
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:33,132
Shit!

1217
01:07:56,845 --> 01:07:59,024
So you're just going to ignore me now?
Is that it?

1218
01:07:59,587 --> 01:08:00,854
Like a baby.

1219
01:08:01,486 --> 01:08:03,592
Go home and eat some baby food, maybe.

1220
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:05,560
Drink some milk.

1221
01:08:05,697 --> 01:08:08,093
Why don't you talk like a baby. Mama, goo goo.

1222
01:08:08,094 --> 01:08:09,094
You baby.

1223
01:08:14,128 --> 01:08:17,505
Wahhh, wahhh.

1224
01:08:17,506 --> 01:08:18,509
Baby!

1225
01:08:20,953 --> 01:08:24,298
Somehow explosions was triggered from that vehicle.

1226
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:27,209
-Destroying it but ...
-Dick weed.

1227
01:08:28,223 --> 01:08:29,846
Okay, you're calling me that too, now.

1228
01:08:29,847 --> 01:08:33,191
I know people call me that. That's not a
surprise to me, that's not a mystery, okay.

1229
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:37,040
Well, you say the real thing to me
all day, every day.

1230
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:38,620
It's not a partners word.

1231
01:08:38,621 --> 01:08:39,758
We are not partners.

1232
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:42,122
I'm the hero, you're my sidekick.

1233
01:08:42,406 --> 01:08:43,836
That's what this is.

1234
01:08:43,926 --> 01:08:46,017
I'm Indie, you're Short Round.

1235
01:08:46,056 --> 01:08:48,470
Simon...Garfunkle.

1236
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:50,978
Scooby...Do.

1237
01:08:50,979 --> 01:08:53,914
Stop fooling yourself. The Green Hornet
is nothing without me.

1238
01:08:53,915 --> 01:08:55,720
I made the knock out gas.

1239
01:08:55,721 --> 01:08:57,816
I alone designed and build the Black Beauty.

1240
01:08:57,889 --> 01:08:59,890
And I didn't help, at all?

1241
01:08:59,891 --> 01:09:02,776
-How, ejector seats?
-Exactly.

1242
01:09:03,115 --> 01:09:04,391
What a great idea.

1243
01:09:04,831 --> 01:09:07,277
You may have started this Green Hornet thing.

1244
01:09:07,505 --> 01:09:09,913
Because of how much you hated your father.

1245
01:09:10,504 --> 01:09:12,195
-You're an egomaniac.
-I know.

1246
01:09:13,339 --> 01:09:14,926
Exactly like your father.

1247
01:09:15,222 --> 01:09:19,658
You are a jealous, pathetic little man.

1248
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:21,162
-Fine.
-Yeah.

1249
01:09:21,163 --> 01:09:22,569
You're doing great with Lenore.

1250
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:24,042
What the hell does that mean?

1251
01:09:24,045 --> 01:09:26,551
Ah, don't you walk away on that.

1252
01:09:26,706 --> 01:09:29,849
What? You're charming her pants off?
That's what I'm suppose to believe.

1253
01:09:31,794 --> 01:09:34,060
No, that is a filthy gesture.

1254
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:37,117
You know I like her.
I confided in you, Kato.

1255
01:09:37,118 --> 01:09:38,803
I, I trusted you.

1256
01:09:38,804 --> 01:09:40,266
I told you I liked her.

1257
01:09:40,267 --> 01:09:42,215
You hit on everything that moves.

1258
01:09:42,216 --> 01:09:44,877
I'm amazed, you haven't hit on me yet.

1259
01:09:47,597 --> 01:09:49,746
If you keep talking like this, Kato.

1260
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:51,801
I'm going to beat the living shit out of you.

1261
01:09:51,802 --> 01:09:52,801
Just so you know.

1262
01:09:52,802 --> 01:09:54,606
I like to see you try.

1263
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:56,279
You're a yuppie whimp,

1264
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,846
and I'm a martial arts expert who
grew up penniless on the streets.

1265
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,931
You grew up penis-less on the streets.

1266
01:10:02,548 --> 01:10:03,548
Funny.

1267
01:10:03,549 --> 01:10:05,554
Heroes beat sidekicks.

1268
01:10:05,555 --> 01:10:06,960
-Period.
-Don't do that.

1269
01:10:06,961 --> 01:10:08,415
-Don't do what? Don't poke you.
-I'm warning you.

1270
01:10:13,546 --> 01:10:16,878
Okay. I'm done, forget that stuff,
so we can fix this.

1271
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,693
Okay, okay you're right.

1272
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:20,578
You're right.
Let's talk.

1273
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:21,587
I'm sorry.

1274
01:10:23,772 --> 01:10:26,266
Sacked you like a bitch, Kato.

1275
01:10:31,466 --> 01:10:32,466
Come here.

1276
01:10:36,583 --> 01:10:38,653
You like that, Kato. You like that.

1277
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:41,752
You get stung when playing with a Hornet.

1278
01:10:43,318 --> 01:10:44,318
Oh, god.

1279
01:10:51,408 --> 01:10:52,635
Now I'm the guy that hurt you.

1280
01:10:52,636 --> 01:10:54,280
I'd like to see you try.

1281
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:01,135
I can't see with this thing on.

1282
01:11:07,067 --> 01:11:08,821
You barely touched her.

1283
01:11:22,957 --> 01:11:25,039
I'll give you a touch.

1284
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,060
Okay, let's...

1285
01:11:28,514 --> 01:11:29,921
You end this?

1286
01:11:36,343 --> 01:11:37,862
You are so stubborn.

1287
01:11:53,707 --> 01:11:57,179
-How it feel, you don't like it?
-No I don't like it.

1288
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,870
-You like it.
-No, I don't like it, get off.

1289
01:12:07,005 --> 01:12:09,991
Okay, now we can end this.

1290
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:16,028
Stop, just stop. Just stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1291
01:12:24,156 --> 01:12:25,156
Reid!

1292
01:12:25,896 --> 01:12:26,896
Wait.

1293
01:12:29,067 --> 01:12:30,067
Help.

1294
01:12:32,115 --> 01:12:33,115
Help.

1295
01:12:41,917 --> 01:12:43,469
Get out of the pool.

1296
01:12:45,037 --> 01:12:46,694
Get off my property.

1297
01:12:48,306 --> 01:12:50,032
Never come back.

1298
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:51,037
Help.

1299
01:12:52,174 --> 01:12:54,227
I, can't swim.

1300
01:13:01,364 --> 01:13:03,265
Please....Reid.

1301
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:28,737
Lenore, it's me.

1302
01:13:29,512 --> 01:13:30,512
It's me, Kato.

1303
01:13:31,812 --> 01:13:34,715
-What the hell?
-That's for whatever lie you told Britt.

1304
01:13:35,405 --> 01:13:37,942
He called me a skank and was mean to me,
and then he fired me.

1305
01:13:41,145 --> 01:13:43,164
Chili was a fine warrior.

1306
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,140
He was a man of honor and dignity.

1307
01:13:48,448 --> 01:13:50,352
We must show our respect.

1308
01:13:51,376 --> 01:13:53,445
I'm will assure him blood.

1309
01:13:54,285 --> 01:13:56,249
Popeye, go forth.

1310
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,706
Take these words and spread them.

1311
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:02,158
The bounty of one million dollars.

1312
01:14:02,575 --> 01:14:05,241
The prey, The Green Hornet.

1313
01:14:05,469 --> 01:14:07,218
Dead, if possible.

1314
01:14:07,613 --> 01:14:10,066
Alive, if necessary.

1315
01:14:10,068 --> 01:14:13,818
I don't care where they have to
go, or who they have to do.

1316
01:14:13,992 --> 01:14:16,020
I want the head of The Green Hornet,

1317
01:14:16,021 --> 01:14:17,537
and I want it tonight.

1318
01:14:19,292 --> 01:14:20,292
Yes.

1319
01:14:29,785 --> 01:14:32,485
Everybody, chase the Hornet.

1320
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,879
-We want him dead.
-Right.

1321
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,695
I want to ... on your own life.

1322
01:14:43,927 --> 01:14:44,927
The Masked one.

1323
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:46,914
-Kill green, yeah.
-Go.

1324
01:14:49,949 --> 01:14:52,643
-Kill the masked one.
-Get on the horn.

1325
01:14:52,643 --> 01:14:55,954
-Alright I'll do it.

1326
01:14:58,344 --> 01:15:01,161
-This Green Hornet, got a mask on.
-One million dollars.

1327
01:15:02,389 --> 01:15:04,437
-Got it.
-Right.

1328
01:15:09,857 --> 01:15:13,499
(All talking on getting The Green Hornet.)

1329
01:15:33,836 --> 01:15:37,240
You failed to kill me the Hornet, Popeye.

1330
01:15:44,489 --> 01:15:46,274
I warned you about this.

1331
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:50,853
You heightened this thing to a point where
it had to reach some kind of climax.

1332
01:15:51,302 --> 01:15:53,267
Well, here it is.

1333
01:15:55,959 --> 01:15:59,092
I hope you realize now,
you should stay out of my way.

1334
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:01,214
Never run this paper.

1335
01:16:07,232 --> 01:16:12,786
A gruesome scene last night as bodies were found all
across the city. Everyone of them wearing green clothing.

1336
01:16:16,509 --> 01:16:19,152
D. A. Scanlon's office, please.

1337
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:24,748
The victims were unfamiliar, and it seems their only connection
was in fact their choice of attire.

1338
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,614
As a safety precaution, police are advising citizens...

1339
01:16:27,615 --> 01:16:32,224
to avoid wearing the color green.
So as not to be unwittingly targeted.

1340
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:37,131
This is my fault.
This is what I did with this newspaper.

1341
01:16:37,132 --> 01:16:40,643
So what. At least you tried.
Your Dad would have understood that.

1342
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,745
Look, running a newspaper must be difficult.

1343
01:16:43,746 --> 01:16:49,083
I mean, if it's anything like running a re-election
campaign. It's got to be a pain in the ass.

1344
01:16:50,287 --> 01:16:52,056
Fortunately I think, uh...

1345
01:16:52,688 --> 01:16:54,510
think we make each other's life easier.

1346
01:16:55,266 --> 01:16:57,869
-How?
-Well there are two sides to every story.

1347
01:16:57,870 --> 01:17:01,044
Right.
I mean, there's some people, they see an event.

1348
01:17:01,045 --> 01:17:04,484
And they interpret it as this crime war, you know.

1349
01:17:04,485 --> 01:17:09,093
Other people see the same incident
and the interpreter it as a small isolated event.

1350
01:17:09,094 --> 01:17:11,889
-Yeah.
-I guess, I could...

1351
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:14,492
help you decide.

1352
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:16,561
How these incidents are exposed.

1353
01:17:16,721 --> 01:17:18,456
In the public interest, of course.

1354
01:17:18,457 --> 01:17:22,943
Now if this collaboration leads
to ascertain my position.

1355
01:17:22,944 --> 01:17:28,667
Well I will insure that you
enjoy compensation in return.

1356
01:17:30,084 --> 01:17:32,016
What kind of compensation?

1357
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:35,229
Frank, are you...

1358
01:17:35,808 --> 01:17:39,041
are you like saying you want me
to slight up the news for you?

1359
01:17:39,142 --> 01:17:41,021
For your re-election. Is that what this is?

1360
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:42,244
I thought you needed my help.

1361
01:17:42,346 --> 01:17:44,997
We, help each other out.

1362
01:17:45,064 --> 01:17:47,073
So that we can both get ahead.

1363
01:17:47,728 --> 01:17:50,002
This is mutually beneficial.

1364
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,921
Okay, I get it now.

1365
01:17:53,731 --> 01:17:57,727
You went to my Dad, he rejected your offer.
And you feel you can just push me around.

1366
01:17:58,514 --> 01:18:00,540
That's what this is? That's what you think?

1367
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:05,418
No, what I think is that you
over value your Dad's integrity.

1368
01:18:07,539 --> 01:18:10,459
You get out of my office right this second.

1369
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,572
This might be what you're looking for.

1370
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:18,578
Thank you.

1371
01:18:48,906 --> 01:18:49,906
Boss.

1372
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:53,584
What are you doing up here? All
the guys were waiting for you.

1373
01:18:53,585 --> 01:18:55,447
Come here.

1374
01:18:56,542 --> 01:18:58,006
I've been doing some thinking.

1375
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,664
And I had a revelation.

1376
01:19:01,099 --> 01:19:03,213
What, I'm obsolete.

1377
01:19:03,214 --> 01:19:04,331
I'm a dinosaur.

1378
01:19:04,802 --> 01:19:07,363
Not in the scary way, in the extinct way.

1379
01:19:07,393 --> 01:19:09,246
And it's time for changes.

1380
01:19:09,342 --> 01:19:13,966
You know, it's time for me to
gain some.....charisma.

1381
01:19:14,642 --> 01:19:16,958
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1382
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:20,882
-What?
-Ha, ha. I'm talking about a motif.

1383
01:19:20,883 --> 01:19:21,963
A theme.

1384
01:19:21,964 --> 01:19:23,132
A  mask.

1385
01:19:23,172 --> 01:19:24,932
Perhaps a stylish cape.

1386
01:19:25,247 --> 01:19:30,439
I'm talking about the death of 'Chudnofsky'
and the rebirth of 'Bloodnofsky'.

1387
01:19:31,846 --> 01:19:32,846
What do you say?

1388
01:19:35,097 --> 01:19:37,366
-Honestly?
-Yeah.

1389
01:19:38,422 --> 01:19:42,813
I think that is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard.

1390
01:19:43,061 --> 01:19:44,989
Why is that stupid?

1391
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:46,583
That's not stupid.

1392
01:19:46,584 --> 01:19:49,384
-Yes it is.
-Blood-nof-sky.

1393
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:52,603
I...I was going to wear red.

1394
01:19:52,836 --> 01:19:54,351
For blood, get it?

1395
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:56,470
That's scary.

1396
01:19:56,928 --> 01:19:58,145
And cool.

1397
01:19:58,745 --> 01:19:59,745
Get this.

1398
01:20:00,698 --> 01:20:04,593
"Be it my mask or blood,
red will be the last color you'll ever see".

1399
01:20:06,898 --> 01:20:08,813
I say that to people when I kill them.

1400
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:11,562
The Green Hornet killed Chili.

1401
01:20:11,656 --> 01:20:14,149
I am minus an eyeball, here.

1402
01:20:14,335 --> 01:20:18,422
You can't go and tell these guys that.
They'll think you lost your bloody mind.

1403
01:20:18,852 --> 01:20:21,115
I think you're having a midlife crisis here.

1404
01:20:21,435 --> 01:20:23,265
Seriously, you're starting to scare me.

1405
01:20:25,699 --> 01:20:26,991
Want to know a secret?

1406
01:20:27,867 --> 01:20:29,864
I'm starting to scare myself.

1407
01:20:36,895 --> 01:20:37,895
Gentlemen.

1408
01:20:38,421 --> 01:20:41,198
The reign of Bloodnofsky starts tonight.

1409
01:20:48,086 --> 01:20:49,086
Hey.

1410
01:20:49,087 --> 01:20:50,772
-Get out of here!
-I'm sorry,

1411
01:20:50,773 --> 01:20:52,714
What are you doing, seriously.

1412
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:54,467
Look, please. Just listen to me.

1413
01:20:54,468 --> 01:20:56,432
Kato lied about us, okay.

1414
01:20:56,433 --> 01:20:58,821
You should have found that out
before you just go and fire me.

1415
01:20:58,822 --> 01:20:59,822
-Nothing happened?
-No.

1416
01:21:00,282 --> 01:21:03,549
Oh thank god. I knew it,
I knew nothing happened.

1417
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:04,718
That ass.

1418
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:05,934
He said you did this.

1419
01:21:05,935 --> 01:21:06,969
What, what is that?

1420
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,393
-I don't know, but I knew it was a lie.
-That's disgusting.

1421
01:21:08,394 --> 01:21:11,752
It's gross. That's not why I'm here, look.
I need you to come back and work for me.

1422
01:21:11,753 --> 01:21:13,491
I'll do whatever you want, I'll double your salary.

1423
01:21:13,492 --> 01:21:15,595
Please, things at the Sentinel?

1424
01:21:15,596 --> 01:21:16,999
Not what they seem.

1425
01:21:17,087 --> 01:21:22,037
As soon as Scanlon started running for election,
my father stopped printing news about hard crime.

1426
01:21:22,037 --> 01:21:23,787
He was making Scanlon look good.

1427
01:21:23,788 --> 01:21:26,463
And I, I have to make it right.

1428
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:29,775
And I realized that if I want to do what's best.

1429
01:21:29,776 --> 01:21:34,296
For this world, that the Daily Sentinel
is the most responsible way to do that.

1430
01:21:34,297 --> 01:21:35,488
Now here's the problem.

1431
01:21:36,021 --> 01:21:39,423
I don't know anything about journalism

1432
01:21:39,424 --> 01:21:40,423
That's the truth.

1433
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:43,135
I need somebody that does.

1434
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:46,554
I need someone that I can trust with my life.

1435
01:21:46,556 --> 01:21:50,769
Just...okay? I need someone who is you.
I need you.

1436
01:21:51,746 --> 01:21:53,943
Will you please help me?

1437
01:21:57,011 --> 01:21:58,783
Britt, I..uh.

1438
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:00,904
I know, I know.

1439
01:22:01,593 --> 01:22:03,316
Oh my god!

1440
01:22:06,194 --> 01:22:07,567
What is your problem?

1441
01:22:07,708 --> 01:22:09,809
-God!
-Why did you do that to me?

1442
01:22:09,946 --> 01:22:11,581
Because you tried to kiss me.

1443
01:22:11,582 --> 01:22:12,918
Yeah, we were going to make out.

1444
01:22:12,919 --> 01:22:14,133
No we weren't.

1445
01:22:14,134 --> 01:22:15,925
Well then I guess I owe you an apology.

1446
01:22:15,926 --> 01:22:18,258
-'Cause I misread that.
-As usual.

1447
01:22:18,259 --> 01:22:19,357
Okay, look.

1448
01:22:19,623 --> 01:22:21,500
I'm sorry, I didn't plan on kissing you.

1449
01:22:21,501 --> 01:22:24,089
When I said all that I mean it.
Will you come back and work for me, please?

1450
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:26,525
-Pretty please.
-Double my salary.

1451
01:22:26,923 --> 01:22:28,847
And I want a parking spot.

1452
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:30,084
You don't have a parking spot?

1453
01:22:30,085 --> 01:22:31,422
-No.
-Wow, that sucks.

1454
01:22:31,423 --> 01:22:34,863
And if you ever so much
as look at my ass again.

1455
01:22:34,864 --> 01:22:36,126
I can't even see your ass.

1456
01:22:36,478 --> 01:22:39,658
I will sue you for sexual harassment.
Do you understand?

1457
01:22:40,301 --> 01:22:41,301
Hugs?

1458
01:22:41,305 --> 01:22:43,114
Where's the hugs at, ya all?

1459
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:14,897
-Britt Reid's office.
-Frank Scanlon.

1460
01:23:14,898 --> 01:23:16,304
Oh, please hold.

1461
01:23:16,888 --> 01:23:18,235
D.A. Scanlon

1462
01:23:18,236 --> 01:23:20,087
-Really?
-Yes.

1463
01:23:21,502 --> 01:23:24,161
-Hello.
-Hey Britt, it's Scanlon.

1464
01:23:24,162 --> 01:23:25,691
Uh, listen.

1465
01:23:25,692 --> 01:23:27,422
I think I owe you an apology.

1466
01:23:38,092 --> 01:23:40,028
Too much blood in the gutter.

1467
01:23:40,029 --> 01:23:42,002
You win. Let's split L.A.

1468
01:23:42,003 --> 01:23:43,860
You get the L. I get the A.

1469
01:23:43,861 --> 01:23:46,203
That means we share the gold and the work.

1470
01:23:52,072 --> 01:23:54,546
One million dollars for today.

1471
01:23:55,048 --> 01:23:58,620
Um, I think you misunderstood
where I was coming from, there.

1472
01:23:58,621 --> 01:24:00,426
I'd just like a chance to clarify some things.

1473
01:24:00,427 --> 01:24:01,897
Things are pretty clear, Scanlon.

1474
01:24:01,899 --> 01:24:04,986
I got three words for you.
Suck it you dick face.

1475
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:08,009
You're gonna tell him you want to meet him.
This is journalism, okay.

1476
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:11,430
You want to be an investigative report, what
you have to do is investigate.

1477
01:24:11,431 --> 01:24:13,040
-Tell him that you want to meet him,
-Hello?

1478
01:24:13,041 --> 01:24:15,189
Okay, your right, okay.

1479
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:16,194
Watch this.

1480
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:25,296
I was joking. Uh, yeah, uh why don't we get
together and just talk about things.

1481
01:24:25,297 --> 01:24:26,621
That's probably a good idea, okay?

1482
01:24:26,622 --> 01:24:29,611
Why don't we meet up for dinner,
a little place called 'Gonpachi'.

1483
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:32,599
Hibachi, a nice little place on
La Cienega drive, around 8:30.

1484
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:39,741
La Cienega, 8:30.

1485
01:25:19,277 --> 01:25:20,277
Britt!

1486
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:33,831
-Hey, Frank.
-Hi, Britt.

1487
01:25:33,832 --> 01:25:36,233
-Good to see you.
-I'm having a sake, what are you having?

1488
01:25:36,503 --> 01:25:38,451
Yeah, I'll have some sake, sure.

1489
01:25:40,546 --> 01:25:42,167
Well, thanks for coming, Britt.

1490
01:25:42,492 --> 01:25:43,492
No problem.

1491
01:26:15,417 --> 01:26:17,089
Mr. Chudnofsky.

1492
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:19,580
Bloodnofsky.
Blood-nofsky.

1493
01:26:19,798 --> 01:26:21,726
I commissioned The Green Hornet.

1494
01:26:21,727 --> 01:26:22,728
You're the chauffeur.

1495
01:26:23,842 --> 01:26:26,269
-Partner.
-Where's the Hornet?

1496
01:26:27,202 --> 01:26:28,212
Right there.

1497
01:26:30,839 --> 01:26:32,838
Whoa, we only get half of the team?

1498
01:26:32,839 --> 01:26:34,217
Who says you're the good half?

1499
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:40,561
Where's Reid?

1500
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:41,693
Guess.

1501
01:26:43,450 --> 01:26:44,450
Oh.

1502
01:26:44,573 --> 01:26:46,108
Any of you move.

1503
01:26:46,359 --> 01:26:47,446
You're dead.

1504
01:26:48,886 --> 01:26:50,724
I'm not actually here for forgiveness, Britt.

1505
01:26:50,945 --> 01:26:52,543
What the hell. I don't understand.

1506
01:26:52,544 --> 01:26:55,522
Yeah, you understand nothing.
So I'm going to explain it you very simply.

1507
01:26:56,119 --> 01:26:59,739
If you ever come across any
article regarding a major crime?

1508
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,584
A man named Benjamin Chudnofsky.

1509
01:27:01,585 --> 01:27:03,924
Or anything that makes this city think,

1510
01:27:03,925 --> 01:27:07,219
that I'm not the fine line protecting the light from the darkness.

1511
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:08,633
You're going to bring it to me.

1512
01:27:08,634 --> 01:27:10,289
You're going to bring it to me,

1513
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:14,290
and I'm going to tell you whether it's okay
for you to print in your stupid little newspaper.

1514
01:27:16,452 --> 01:27:18,062
That's how I did it with your dad.

1515
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:21,026
And that's how you and I are going to do it.

1516
01:27:23,559 --> 01:27:26,929
Scanlon, you're saying you want
me to let you write the news?

1517
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:30,978
Finally.

1518
01:27:31,484 --> 01:27:32,971
You understand.

1519
01:27:34,774 --> 01:27:37,252
Yep, I understand all right.

1520
01:27:38,201 --> 01:27:39,744
Here's one I understand.

1521
01:27:39,745 --> 01:27:42,581
That you son, just got played.

1522
01:27:43,044 --> 01:27:44,866
By a player.

1523
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:47,100
Recording device, USB.

1524
01:27:47,101 --> 01:27:48,970
No, you can't have it. It's mine.

1525
01:27:48,971 --> 01:27:50,419
You stupid schmuck.

1526
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,396
I got you by the balls, Scanlon.

1527
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:54,387
I run a newspaper, genius.

1528
01:27:54,388 --> 01:27:56,242
This is going on the front page tomorrow.

1529
01:27:56,243 --> 01:27:58,367
-Oh yeah. I got to say that's kind of impressed with this.
-You should say it was impressive.

1530
01:27:58,368 --> 01:27:59,746
But it's not going to do you any good.

1531
01:27:59,747 --> 01:28:02,713
How could it not do me any good?
Are you going to kill me in the middle of this restaurant?

1532
01:28:02,714 --> 01:28:05,521
-Yes.
-What, you're going to murder me?

1533
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:08,372
Yeah.
Like I murdered your father.

1534
01:28:09,012 --> 01:28:10,378
What's that, my Dad was not murdered.

1535
01:28:10,379 --> 01:28:12,421
He, he died from a bee sting.

1536
01:28:12,422 --> 01:28:15,503
No, no. Your father died from an overdose of epitoxin.

1537
01:28:15,504 --> 01:28:16,836
Most commonly found in a bee sting.

1538
01:28:16,837 --> 01:28:18,187
In which he also happened to be allergic to.

1539
01:28:18,188 --> 01:28:19,932
Britt, that epitoxin,...

1540
01:28:21,245 --> 01:28:22,916
was administered by me.

1541
01:28:25,336 --> 01:28:26,752
Shit!

1542
01:28:26,753 --> 01:28:27,753
Think Britt.

1543
01:28:27,921 --> 01:28:29,933
You can figure this out, my son.

1544
01:28:30,151 --> 01:28:31,300
You're brilliant.

1545
01:28:31,301 --> 01:28:33,131
I am so stunned.

1546
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:35,667
That's right, think.

1547
01:28:36,022 --> 01:28:37,346
-Slowly..
-Okay.

1548
01:28:37,347 --> 01:28:39,850
Two years ago Scanlon decides to run for D.A.

1549
01:28:39,911 --> 01:28:42,422
He goes on the platform that
he's cleaning up the street of L.A.

1550
01:28:42,723 --> 01:28:43,845
Which is impossible.

1551
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:46,209
So, he asks the media to slight the news.

1552
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:48,836
-And you go along with it, like everyone else?
-No.

1553
01:28:48,881 --> 01:28:50,793
I, I refused.

1554
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,617
So he...shit what does he do?

1555
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:56,523
So Scanlon decides to go really dirty,
he makes a pact with a criminal.

1556
01:28:56,608 --> 01:28:59,010
Chudnofsky kills the reporter Verbi,...Vertolli?

1557
01:28:59,011 --> 01:29:02,244
I didn't want anymore bloodshed.
So I stopped reporting on crime.

1558
01:29:02,245 --> 01:29:06,167
To be honest in the last few years, this
paper has dipped in quality and ambition.

1559
01:29:06,643 --> 01:29:09,063
Now, Scanlon can hold up his part of the deal,

1560
01:29:09,064 --> 01:29:10,469
of keeping the media under control and...

1561
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,293
Chudnofsky can do whatever he wants.

1562
01:29:14,275 --> 01:29:16,055
But Chudnofsky had a different plan.

1563
01:29:16,568 --> 01:29:19,428
He wanted to take over all the gangs of L.A.

1564
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:21,847
So that's when you decided to cut the strings.

1565
01:29:22,412 --> 01:29:24,286
I couldn't look myself in the mirror.

1566
01:29:24,653 --> 01:29:27,185
I hated every word I said
to you that morning, Britt.

1567
01:29:27,985 --> 01:29:30,121
So you start reporting on crime again.

1568
01:29:30,122 --> 01:29:33,604
And now Scanlon is a dead man unless he
proves he's still under control.

1569
01:29:33,973 --> 01:29:36,905
He has no choice but to organize
a secret meeting with you.

1570
01:29:37,855 --> 01:29:39,306
And he kills you himself.

1571
01:29:41,264 --> 01:29:44,455
In the end, you stood up for what's right, Dad.

1572
01:29:45,424 --> 01:29:47,127
Now I have to do the same.

1573
01:29:51,067 --> 01:29:55,092
I can see by that stupid expression you've
got on your face for the past five minutes,

1574
01:29:55,093 --> 01:29:56,377
That you're trying to piece this together.

1575
01:29:56,378 --> 01:29:57,496
But it's no good.

1576
01:29:57,782 --> 01:29:59,897
You're about to killed by the, Green Hornet.

1577
01:30:00,712 --> 01:30:01,712
What?

1578
01:30:06,346 --> 01:30:07,567
It's the Green Hornet's sidekick.

1579
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:08,806
He's got a gun.

1580
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:14,733
Bluff! Bluff! Eradicate.

1581
01:30:18,135 --> 01:30:20,460
Before you do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.

1582
01:30:21,226 --> 01:30:22,655
I'm sorry for everything.

1583
01:30:23,797 --> 01:30:25,223
I forgive you.

1584
01:30:30,106 --> 01:30:31,873
Hey, not me. Him stupid.

1585
01:30:31,965 --> 01:30:34,078
Confused, you should be.

1586
01:30:35,247 --> 01:30:37,010
-Go, go.
-Let's go..

1587
01:30:47,762 --> 01:30:49,114
We're goners.

1588
01:30:49,725 --> 01:30:51,877
You know what happen when you fool with a hornet?

1589
01:30:51,878 --> 01:30:53,478
-No.
-You get stung.

1590
01:30:55,903 --> 01:30:56,903
Oh, shit.

1591
01:31:04,555 --> 01:31:06,140
See, the bad guys.

1592
01:31:08,389 --> 01:31:09,389
Go, go!

1593
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,533
-What the hell happened?
-Get in the car.

1594
01:31:16,534 --> 01:31:19,521
-He was suppose to kill Britt Reid, he’s shooting at me.
-Get in the vehicle.

1595
01:31:31,259 --> 01:31:32,259
Are you okay?

1596
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:34,134
-Britt?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1597
01:31:34,398 --> 01:31:35,822
My outfit's back here.

1598
01:31:38,778 --> 01:31:40,892
Britt Reid is the Green Hornet.

1599
01:31:40,893 --> 01:31:43,295
Yeah I know. You hired a guy to kill himself.

1600
01:31:46,358 --> 01:31:50,457
Britt Reid recorded the whole
conversation on some Sushi drive USB.

1601
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:53,598
-We can't loose him.
-We're not loosing him, we're following him.

1602
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,041
Kato, thank you buddy.
You were so good, thank you.

1603
01:31:57,042 --> 01:31:58,770
-Really?
-Yes..

1604
01:31:58,771 --> 01:32:00,070
-Your house?
-No.

1605
01:32:00,071 --> 01:32:01,097
Here's the deal, Kato.

1606
01:32:01,185 --> 01:32:04,828
We've got to get this flash drive to the Sentinel.
It's got Scanlon spilling-the-beans on it.

1607
01:32:04,829 --> 01:32:06,623
We're going to put it on the net.

1608
01:32:06,625 --> 01:32:08,105
It's what my father would have wanted.

1609
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:09,195
You like your father, now?

1610
01:32:09,547 --> 01:32:12,378
Yes, you see he wasn't a dick after all.

1611
01:32:12,534 --> 01:32:14,362
Well, he was a dick.

1612
01:32:14,363 --> 01:32:16,166
Just not really how we thought he was.

1613
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,895
At the end he wasn't a dick...it's called gay.
I'll explain later, okay.

1614
01:32:20,304 --> 01:32:22,377
It's a lot of conflicting emotions, Kato.

1615
01:32:22,378 --> 01:32:23,746
Let's roll, Reid.

1616
01:32:32,893 --> 01:32:36,556
Here’s' the thing, Kato. Honestly, I've
been jealous of you the entire time.

1617
01:32:36,643 --> 01:32:37,831
-You're awesome.
-I know.

1618
01:32:37,832 --> 01:32:39,188
-You built this whole car.
-I know.

1619
01:32:39,189 --> 01:32:40,189
You know karate.

1620
01:32:40,190 --> 01:32:41,902
-You're charming.
-Thank you.

1621
01:32:41,903 --> 01:32:43,659
These guys are amazingly well organized.

1622
01:32:58,255 --> 01:32:59,678
Backups on the side.

1623
01:33:00,527 --> 01:33:02,926
-Orders.
-Put your guard on, here.

1624
01:33:08,773 --> 01:33:10,062
The other side.

1625
01:33:11,655 --> 01:33:12,655
Your turn!

1626
01:33:27,254 --> 01:33:28,254
Oh shit.

1627
01:33:31,217 --> 01:33:32,217
We lost them.

1628
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:33,232
-He's gone. ...He's gone.
-Yeah.

1629
01:33:35,674 --> 01:33:37,103
Damn, he's back.

1630
01:33:37,105 --> 01:33:38,310
You gotta be kidding me.

1631
01:33:38,633 --> 01:33:40,133
These guys are good.

1632
01:33:41,257 --> 01:33:42,907
Over there.
Over there, over there.

1633
01:33:43,179 --> 01:33:44,375
I got moment.

1634
01:33:44,376 --> 01:33:45,588
Moment to this.

1635
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:47,146
We're not going to make it.

1636
01:33:47,348 --> 01:33:48,872
Waa...yeah we're going to make it.

1637
01:34:02,671 --> 01:34:04,259
That's a very big gun.

1638
01:34:16,565 --> 01:34:18,502
Kato, be careful.

1639
01:34:19,848 --> 01:34:21,734
-Take the wheel.
-What?

1640
01:34:21,735 --> 01:34:23,327
-Take the wheel.
-I can't drive this thing.

1641
01:34:23,328 --> 01:34:24,327
Yes you can.

1642
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:26,804
Nun chucks, that was my idea.

1643
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:28,324
Hey, hey where you going?

1644
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:37,234
What are you doing now?
What are you doing up there?

1645
01:34:50,875 --> 01:34:51,875
Shit, shit!

1646
01:34:52,292 --> 01:34:55,348
Kato, Jesus.
I don't know what anything does.

1647
01:34:55,693 --> 01:34:57,437
Why didn't you do this in English?

1648
01:35:05,237 --> 01:35:07,492
-(Speaks Chinese)
-Why don't you say it in English.

1649
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:09,181
-No, sir.
-It's out there.

1650
01:35:09,413 --> 01:35:11,992
-Hang one left.
-I'm just ready to ...

1651
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,264
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1652
01:35:14,265 --> 01:35:15,264
Turn it off.

1653
01:35:15,265 --> 01:35:16,789
-I don't know what to do.
-Turn off.

1654
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:17,880
I'll just stop it.

1655
01:35:17,881 --> 01:35:19,663
Ah, I stopped it.

1656
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:22,518
I'm sorry.

1657
01:35:27,811 --> 01:35:30,939
-Shoot foam
-Hey, it's okay.

1658
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:32,385
Next time, don't touch anything.

1659
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:36,933
Kato, look.

1660
01:35:37,045 --> 01:35:38,045
We made it.

1661
01:35:38,193 --> 01:35:39,467
Kato, we made it.

1662
01:35:39,468 --> 01:35:40,656
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

1663
01:35:40,909 --> 01:35:42,701
-I can't.
-Yeah, that's cool.

1664
01:35:50,313 --> 01:35:51,417
Oh, we're screwed.

1665
01:36:13,238 --> 01:36:15,041
Come on! Hurry up.

1666
01:36:18,302 --> 01:36:19,302
Ah,  whoops.

1667
01:36:23,221 --> 01:36:25,574
-Did you drop it?... Shit!
-Yes.

1668
01:36:30,283 --> 01:36:31,283
You get it. I'll cover you.

1669
01:36:32,846 --> 01:36:34,219
Wish me luck.

1670
01:36:35,086 --> 01:36:36,258
Good luck.

1671
01:36:59,607 --> 01:37:03,540
Dear Hornet, Be it my mask, or your blood.

1672
01:37:03,541 --> 01:37:06,034
Red will be the last...

1673
01:37:07,402 --> 01:37:10,150
Britt Reid, fire.

1674
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:16,458
Go!
Get him.

1675
01:37:19,088 --> 01:37:20,566
Let me shoot him.

1676
01:37:22,385 --> 01:37:23,505
Oh, no.

1677
01:37:25,453 --> 01:37:26,801
Shoot to kill.

1678
01:37:28,574 --> 01:37:30,004
You brought a gas mask.

1679
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:33,214
-Of course I brought a gas mask.
-Just for yourself.

1680
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,171
There!

1681
01:38:05,456 --> 01:38:07,045
Are you hitting the paper?

1682
01:38:13,725 --> 01:38:14,820
Over here.

1683
01:38:19,866 --> 01:38:21,645
This fog's up.

1684
01:38:30,788 --> 01:38:31,788
There.

1685
01:38:39,254 --> 01:38:40,254
Kato!

1686
01:38:42,143 --> 01:38:43,583
Get us out of here.

1687
01:38:51,448 --> 01:38:53,449
Hah, I'm ungassable.

1688
01:39:09,149 --> 01:39:10,700
That was incredibly dangerous.

1689
01:39:12,417 --> 01:39:14,982
Drop me off at the elevators.
I'll take it from here.

1690
01:39:20,066 --> 01:39:21,518
No, we stay together.

1691
01:39:28,353 --> 01:39:29,756
Hey, get in the front seat.

1692
01:39:29,757 --> 01:39:30,763
Quick, quick.

1693
01:39:40,877 --> 01:39:42,658
Tenth floor, tenth floor.

1694
01:39:42,883 --> 01:39:44,182
What's the worse, what's the worse, missiles?

1695
01:39:44,183 --> 01:39:46,360
Four missiles left. Hornet gun?

1696
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,566
-Check.
-Machine guns, check.

1697
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:49,751
Does it drive?

1698
01:39:49,752 --> 01:39:51,049
Front wheel drive.

1699
01:39:57,879 --> 01:39:59,081
Hey, get out of here.

1700
01:40:04,846 --> 01:40:06,501
Okay, you can let me out of here.

1701
01:40:12,203 --> 01:40:14,198
Bazooka. Guy with a bazooka.

1702
01:40:16,888 --> 01:40:17,888
Missile.

1703
01:40:18,117 --> 01:40:19,117
Fire.

1704
01:40:28,938 --> 01:40:29,938
Reload.

1705
01:40:34,562 --> 01:40:35,685
Kato, they're here.

1706
01:40:35,958 --> 01:40:38,274
Go be a journalist, I'll kick ass.

1707
01:40:38,571 --> 01:40:40,324
There, there!

1708
01:40:40,393 --> 01:40:41,393
Aw, shit!

1709
01:40:49,015 --> 01:40:50,015
Come on.

1710
01:40:56,439 --> 01:40:57,698
Okay, I'm there.

1711
01:40:57,700 --> 01:41:00,110
One minute and this baby is going to all over the wo...

1712
01:41:04,552 --> 01:41:06,452
Star...star...start up!

1713
01:41:16,246 --> 01:41:17,246
Yeah!

1714
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,320
Do you see him?

1715
01:41:56,321 --> 01:41:57,977
I can't see anything.

1716
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:26,015
Oh, I'm so stupid!

1717
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:38,204
All right, Reid.

1718
01:42:38,564 --> 01:42:40,235
Hand over the thing.

1719
01:42:40,490 --> 01:42:42,691
You want it?
Go get it.

1720
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:49,582
Where is it?
Where is it!

1721
01:42:49,763 --> 01:42:50,990
I am Bloodnofsky.

1722
01:42:51,342 --> 01:42:53,773
I've killed a thousand before,
and I'll kill a thousand more.

1723
01:43:02,885 --> 01:43:04,654
Now tremble before your death.

1724
01:43:04,898 --> 01:43:10,321
For be it my mask, or be it your blood. Red
will be the last color you ever see.

1725
01:44:00,593 --> 01:44:01,593
Britt.

1726
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:02,830
Britt!

1727
01:44:15,014 --> 01:44:17,160
Hey! End of the road, Scanlon.

1728
01:44:17,324 --> 01:44:18,770
Okay, okay.

1729
01:44:18,986 --> 01:44:19,986
Let's just calm down.

1730
01:44:19,987 --> 01:44:21,739
Hand over the sushi.

1731
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:24,206
Um, yeah, hand it over.

1732
01:44:24,207 --> 01:44:25,716
We can talk about this.

1733
01:44:25,717 --> 01:44:27,299
On the ground now.

1734
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:28,854
-It's the Green Hornet. Shoot him.
-Get on the ground.

1735
01:44:28,854 --> 01:44:29,856
Shoot him!

1736
01:44:34,885 --> 01:44:36,411
Quick, quick.

1737
01:44:36,629 --> 01:44:39,295
I'm District Attorney Mike Scanlon.

1738
01:44:39,296 --> 01:44:41,414
That is the Green Hornet.

1739
01:44:47,310 --> 01:44:49,065
Kato, I screwed up.

1740
01:44:49,066 --> 01:44:51,013
Scanlon's going to get away, scott free.

1741
01:44:51,306 --> 01:44:52,821
No he's not.

1742
01:45:26,939 --> 01:45:28,986
Ow! Whoa!

1743
01:45:32,589 --> 01:45:33,589
Holy shit.

1744
01:45:34,276 --> 01:45:35,276
Ejector seats.

1745
01:45:36,474 --> 01:45:37,567
You actually built them.

1746
01:45:37,568 --> 01:45:39,221
It was a good idea.

1747
01:45:43,197 --> 01:45:44,197
Wow.

1748
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:47,737
This is really scary

1749
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:51,770
A brutal high speed chase between the Green Hornet,

1750
01:45:51,771 --> 01:45:55,994
and rival gang members has led to the Daily Sentinel

1751
01:45:54,995 --> 01:45:57,655
-I called it.
-leaving a trail of demolished cars,

1752
01:45:57,656 --> 01:45:58,989
and trucks in their path.

1753
01:45:58,990 --> 01:46:01,285
Here's the story. We're on our way to a costume party.

1754
01:46:01,608 --> 01:46:02,608
Okay.

1755
01:46:03,376 --> 01:46:05,122
We gotta get out of our suits.

1756
01:46:05,256 --> 01:46:06,969
Where the hell are we going to go?

1757
01:46:08,975 --> 01:46:10,788
No one knows why the District Attorney..

1758
01:46:14,921 --> 01:46:17,443
No, stop!
Stop, stop!

1759
01:46:17,444 --> 01:46:18,444
Lenore!

1760
01:46:18,445 --> 01:46:19,787
How do you guys know my name?

1761
01:46:19,788 --> 01:46:20,787
-It's us.
-Kato.

1762
01:46:20,945 --> 01:46:22,950
It's me, huh?

1763
01:46:23,079 --> 01:46:24,732
You assholes!

1764
01:46:25,271 --> 01:46:26,271
You assholes.

1765
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:29,116
What the hell are you doing dressed as criminals?

1766
01:46:29,117 --> 01:46:31,488
-You're criminals my god.
-No we're not.

1767
01:46:31,489 --> 01:46:32,655
We're helping people.

1768
01:46:32,957 --> 01:46:37,108
Why did you ask me to do research on the
Green Hornet, when you are the Green Hornet?

1769
01:46:37,181 --> 01:46:38,247
We don't know what we're doing.

1770
01:46:38,248 --> 01:46:40,964
We need you to help us, don't you see.
You're the mastermind.

1771
01:46:40,965 --> 01:46:41,964
What?

1772
01:46:42,403 --> 01:46:44,613
This is the police.
Please open up.

1773
01:46:44,614 --> 01:46:47,204
Please don't tell on us. We were trying
to be good people. Don't do this.

1774
01:46:47,205 --> 01:46:48,574
-Think about it.
-Shut up!

1775
01:46:49,519 --> 01:46:51,204
Hello officer, can I help you?

1776
01:46:51,205 --> 01:46:52,978
We're looking for two masked men.

1777
01:46:52,979 --> 01:46:54,934
-You seen anything?
-Yeah, of course.

1778
01:46:55,598 --> 01:46:57,469
-Really?
-Yeah, they're all over the news.

1779
01:46:57,470 --> 01:46:59,522
- All the time.
-All right.

1780
01:47:00,361 --> 01:47:02,396
Well please report anything suspicious.

1781
01:47:02,397 --> 01:47:03,396
Absolutely.

1782
01:47:04,346 --> 01:47:07,190
You heartless stupid assholes.

1783
01:47:07,191 --> 01:47:09,366
You kiss him.

1784
01:47:09,525 --> 01:47:10,515
You kiss me.

1785
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:12,803
We'll figure this out later, come on.

1786
01:47:09,523 --> 01:47:10,677
Don't kiss me.

1787
01:47:12,771 --> 01:47:12,771
)All talking at once

1788
01:47:12,823 --> 01:47:14,115
I don't kissed him.

1789
01:47:14,116 --> 01:47:15,320
-We don't kiss.
-I have a bullet in me.

1790
01:47:15,321 --> 01:47:18,270
You know I didn't kiss. You guys like kissing.
I don't see why.

1791
01:47:19,329 --> 01:47:21,376
I've been shot in the shoulder.

1792
01:47:21,664 --> 01:47:23,317
Well then go to the hospital.

1793
01:47:23,357 --> 01:47:25,198
No! Don't you see.

1794
01:47:25,315 --> 01:47:27,807
The police knows the Green Hornet was shot in the shoulder.

1795
01:47:27,808 --> 01:47:30,437
If I go to the hospital they'll know I'm the Green Hornet.

1796
01:47:30,731 --> 01:47:32,368
Yeah you've been shot, eww.

1797
01:47:32,748 --> 01:47:35,974
Here's what I need. I need a spatula
to bite down on and a knife.

1798
01:47:35,975 --> 01:47:38,226
You gotta dig this bullet out of my meat.

1799
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:39,639
Do it!

1800
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:40,649
I'm cold.

1801
01:47:42,903 --> 01:47:44,322
It's deep inside me.

1802
01:47:44,517 --> 01:47:45,500
Oh, God.

1803
01:47:45,501 --> 01:47:48,412
-Spatula.
-Ah, okay, okay.

1804
01:47:48,492 --> 01:47:50,362
-Make sure it's sterilized.
-What?

1805
01:47:50,718 --> 01:47:53,382
Sterilize it. Please I don't want to get gangrene.

1806
01:47:53,385 --> 01:47:56,864
-Play it safe, xiongdì.
-Xiongdì, xiongdì forever.

1807
01:47:58,189 --> 01:47:58,189
-Okay, okay ready.
-God, let me see.

1808
01:47:58,190 --> 01:48:00,531
Okay just wait, just hurry, just start there.

1809
01:48:02,168 --> 01:48:04,354
It hurts, okay I can't do it.

1810
01:48:04,468 --> 01:48:05,379
Take me to the hospital.

1811
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:06,586
Shut up!

1812
01:48:06,932 --> 01:48:11,826
Hey look, if I'm the mastermind of all this,
just let me have a second of silence.

1813
01:48:11,827 --> 01:48:13,904
So I can figure this out, okay?

1814
01:48:14,793 --> 01:48:19,282
Mere hours ago the Green Hornet
and a group of his criminal underlings,

1815
01:48:19,283 --> 01:48:22,334
launched a horrendous attack on this building.

1816
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:25,424
That claimed the life of District Attorney Frank Scanlon.

1817
01:48:26,186 --> 01:48:29,652
It's unfortunate but,
you know, that's what happens.

1818
01:48:30,608 --> 01:48:32,726
The Daily Sentinel will be rebuilt.

1819
01:48:33,172 --> 01:48:38,619
And to start that off, I am naming
Mike Axford the new Editor in chief.

1820
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,490
Mike's a great guy he's comfortable telling me off.

1821
01:48:42,495 --> 01:48:44,304
So, he's the perfect man for the job.

1822
01:48:45,338 --> 01:48:50,891
Weeee, have to get this paper back
to the ideals that my father started it on.

1823
01:48:52,847 --> 01:48:54,634
I want to make him proud.

1824
01:48:55,286 --> 01:48:58,472
And I hope to make this city proud of the Daily Sentinel.

1825
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:00,168
Like never before.

1826
01:49:04,839 --> 01:49:07,004
The Green Hornet sends his regards.

1827
01:49:14,072 --> 01:49:15,826
Direct hit, he got my shoulder.

1828
01:49:16,379 --> 01:49:17,692
Hey, The Green Hornet.

1829
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:23,599
-Get him to the hospital.
-He's shot in the shoulder. We have to
get him to the hospital right away.

1830
01:49:26,244 --> 01:49:27,244
It worked.

1831
01:49:27,436 --> 01:49:28,430
Ow.
