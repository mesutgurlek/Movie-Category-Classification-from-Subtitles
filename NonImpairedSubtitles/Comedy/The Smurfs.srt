00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:00,274
but over to the sides,
it'd be a bit more visible.
Hey, look, product.

322
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,471
Also, don't forget to smile.

323
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,714
Remember, you're working
for a cosmetics company.
That's it.

324
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,942
Smile, relax, everyone
will have a good time.
GROUCHY: Let's go!

325
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,280
Thanks. Thank you so much.

326
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,684
PAPA: Hurry!

327
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,277
Hello, Henri.

328
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,119
On top of everything
with the campaign, Patrick?

329
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,283
Well, as much as l can be.

330
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,858
We certainly did our homework.
We tested the results.

331
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,485
ODILE: Patrick!

332
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,390
She's pointing at me.

333
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,967
That can't be good.

334
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,333
FEMALE REPORTER:
Odile, it looks fantastic
for Thursday's launch.

335
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,371
ODILE: It's gonna
be quite the gala.

336
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:35,173
Oh, there he is.
My new vice president
of marketing.

337
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,673
So, wait, you fired Ralph?

338
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:37,872
His campaign was rubbish.

339
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,315
He gave me what I asked for,
not what I want.

340
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,551
Can you give me
what I want?

341
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,145
Is that what
you're asking for?

342
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,588
How would I know
what I'm asking for

343
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,488
when I don't even
know what I want?

344
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,586
Well said, Odile. Well said.
That's why you need me.

345
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:55,359
Exacto! I need you to create
a new campaign for Jouvenel.

346
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:59,197
All digital, of course,
so it can be ready
on time for the launch.

347
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:01,995
Odile, that's two days.

348
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,166
Si, mi corazÃ³n,
and it mustn't be delayed.

349
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,709
Is that going
to be a problem?

350
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,437
No. No, I mean for
a whole new campaign,
it's kind of tight.

351
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,411
But... No,
two days is perfect.

352
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,210
God only needed six days
for the whole world, right?

353
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,714
Fail me, and maybe you can
go and work for him. Hmm?

354
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,520
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

355
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,053

00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,595
What manner of
freakish realm is this?

358
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,936
Okay, one more
box of research.

359
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,061
Hey, would you get
a cab for me, please?

360
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,901
WOMAN:
Yes, yes, of course.

361

GROUCHY: This day just keeps
getting better and better.

362
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,944
CLUMSY: So we're just
gonna jump in the portal,
get back to our village

363
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,377
and everybody's happy,
right?

364
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,643
SMURFETTE: Yeah, guys.
Let's stay smurftimistic.

365

You know what?
I choose to
be pessismurfstic.

366
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,314
We're all gonna die.

367
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,787
Papa Smurf, how do we get home
with the portal closed?

368
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,484
I'm sure when
the blue moon rises tonight,

369
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,390
the portal will open again.

370
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,396
Now, let's take
shelter till dark.

371
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,225
All right,
let's get smurfing.

372
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,789

the mechanical wagon.

GUTSY: Up the tree, Smurfs.

389
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,133
Why don't we just go
around the tree?

390
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,095
There you are.
By all means,

391
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,002
relax here in the fresh
air and the sunshine

could be anywhere.

with me, Smurfs.

too old for this.

like these heights.

00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,695
There are little blue people
singing in our kitchen!

636
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,102
(SCREAMING)
Oh!

637
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,499
(GRACE LAUGHS)

638
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,771
So you're sticking with
your "this is actually
happening" theory?

639
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,504
Sorry. (CHUCKLES)

640
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:07,516
Okay. It says
here Smurfs are mythical
creatures from Belgium,

641
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:10,018
also known as Schtroumpfs...
PAPA: Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

642
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,577
Documented by Peyo.

643
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:16,019
Also says
that they bring good luck.
Like leprechauns to the Irish.

644
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:18,527
It says
they're mythical, Grace.
(SCREAMING)

645
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,595
I'm so sorry, Master Winslow.
That was great.

646
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,187
GRACE: Well, they look
pretty real to me.

647
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,698
Come on.

648
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:25,958
GRACE: Aw!

649
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,869
Excuse me.
Okay, to review.

650
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:34,434
You guys come
from a magic forest where you
live in oversized mushrooms.

651
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,568
Yes.
You're being chased
by an evil wizard.

652
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,112
Yeah.
And you're trapped
in New York

653
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,807
until there's a blue moon...
Very good.

654
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:42,784
And you like to use
the extremely
imprecise term "smurf"

655
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,047
for just about everything.
Smurfxactly.

656
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:50,121
And you're all named
after your personalities?

657
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,091
Do you get your names
when you're born,

658
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,754
or after you've exhibited
certain traits?

659
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:54,991
Yeah.
Yep.

660
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,326
Yeah, whatever.

661
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,595
Master Winslow, there must be
something about the blue moon

662
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:01,296
on your magic window machine.

663
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,167
Whoa! Just what is this
magic searching device?

664
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,999
Right now,
I'm using Google.

665
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,508
ALL: Ooh!

666
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,979
ALL: Google.

667
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:17,409
Okay. "Blue moon.
A full moon that occurs
twice in one month.

668
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,149
"A figurative construct..."

669
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,148
Much like yourselves.
Hey!

670
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:24,022
"But the moon itself
doesn't appear to be blue."

671
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,456
What?
(GASPS) Not blue?

672
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,258
Perfect!
Now we'll never get home!

673
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,595
No cause for alarm,
my little Smurfs.

674
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,361
If we're to open
the portal home,

675
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,299
I'll just have to
smurf us a potion

676
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,769
to invoke the blue moon.

677
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,169
You hear that, honey?

678
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,673
They're only staying till
an actual blue moon rises.

679
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:42,309
Which could happen if
the little blue Santa man
makes a magic potion,

680
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,109
which, at this point,
seems completely plausible.

681
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,843
Want a bite?
No, thank you.

682
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,647
Of course, the stars will
need to be perfectly aligned.

683
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:55,124
And when that might be
is hard to determine
without the proper instrument.

684
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,127
Mmm. Master Winslow,
might I borrow
your stargazer?

685
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,287
My what-whatzer?

686
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,188
Uh-oh. He doesn't have
a stargazer. Do you?

687
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,698
This is all my fault.

688
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,062
We're all gonna die.

689
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,966
We're all gonna die!
Smurf out of it,
scaredy-brains!

690
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,505
One Panicky Smurf is enough!
Hey!

691
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:13,672
Besides, Papa had a vision,
and everything
turns out smurfy.

692
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:15,173
Right, Papa?

693
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:21,516
(STAMMERS) Yes, yes.
It all turns out just fine.

694
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:29,920
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.

695
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:32,017
If I were a Smurf,
where would I go?

696
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,990
You there, you there.
Fancy pants.

697
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,531
Have you seen any
little blue men?

698
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:36,895
Absolutely. What price
are we talking about?

699
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,092
You're selling them?

700
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,328
Have you looked
in the drawer, sweetie?
Wait, what drawer?

701
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,895
In the kitchen, Lilly.
Who is this Lilly?

702
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,406
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl
in my department.

703
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,704
Please, please.
Please, young woodsman.

704
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:52,215
What does the temperature
of this Lilly have to do
with the finding of Smurfs?

705
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,876
Take your meds, man.
What?

706
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,881
Is everyone in this realm
completely insane?

707
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,883
Thank the gods,
a local wizard.
Excellent.

708
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,126
Pardon me, wise sir?

709
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,458
By any chance, have you seen
any little blue men?

710
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,761
They're everywhere!
(LAUGHS)

711
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,934
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you
we were close, AzraeI.

712
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,598
I know.

713
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,135
Now, just take one, everybody.

714
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,642
We have to make sure
our smurfberries last.

715
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,077
Great. We're gonna
be here how long?

716
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,638
Not long. First,
we have to get a stargazer.

717
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,980
Next, find a book of spells
and then smurf a portal

718
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:33,488
and we're home.
Very simple,
my little Smurfs.

719
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,216
Bye, Elway.

720
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,590
Someone looks smurfalish!

721
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,822
Why you wearing a leash?
It's a tie.

722
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:42,159
Does it keep your neck warm?
No.

723
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,960
Clearly, it functions
as an aid in his craft,
like a blacksmith's apron.

724
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,264
I wear it because it's what
everyone wears at work.

725
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,462
What are you,
you pasty giant?

726
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:54,738
I try to get people
to buy things by analyzing
market trend predictions.

727
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,576
Predictions! A-ha!
He's a fortune teller.

728
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:01,174
Look, I would love
to explain but I am
super late. I gotta go.

729
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,343
I really don't have
time for this.
(GASPS) What?

730
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,153
You had one outfit on,

731
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:08,247
and now
you're wearing something
completely different.

732
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:09,621
Yeah. It...
Now, Smurfette,

733
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,820
she probably got
the other one dirty.

734
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,759
Let's not embarrass her.
Sorry.

735
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,196
Thanks for letting us stay
in your mushroom, Miss Grace.

736
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,527
It's really nice.

737
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,193
Aw! Well, thank you.
I'm glad you like it.

738
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,703
I like our little
mushroom, too.

739
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,001
(WHISPERS)
But you know, somebody
wants a bigger mushroom.

740
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,936
But, then you'd be
further apart.

741
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,205
You said it, sister.
Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.

742
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,975
I've got a baby
on the way, so...

743
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:36,383
Wait, wait. We can't just
leave them here alone,
without an adult.

744
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,717
(LAUGHS) I'm 546 years old.

745
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,313
Of course you are.

746
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,982
They'll be fine.
They'll be fine.
All right.

747
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:45,221
Love you.
Okay.

748
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,193
Bye. Bye.
SMURFETTE:
Bye, Grace! Goodbye.

749
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,629
By the way, I wouldn't go
anywhere if I were you.

750
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,026
Why not?

751
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:55,561
Our world doesn't do well
with visitors from other
places.

752
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,367
I mean, look what
happened to E.T.

753
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,866
It's a movie.
A moving picture.

754
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,371
Book. Just stay, okay?

755
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,647
Great. He's gone
and we still don't
have a stargazer.

756
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:11,882
Wait a smurf.
If he's a fortune teller,
he reads stars all the time.

757
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:15,253
Ergo, it's at his
place of business.

758
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,083
Excellent work, Brainy.

759
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,162
What are we waiting for?
Let's ride.

760
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,060
CLUMSY: Yeah, come on, guys.
Hey, stop it.

761
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,223
Come on, Smurfs!
Let's go get that stargazer.

762
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,356
Whoo-hoo!

763
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,395
GUTSY: Surprise, surprise.
GROUCHY: Oh, no.

764
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:31,167
Clumsy, I think
it might be best

765
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,334
if you stay here.
You know?

766
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,271
Smurf an eye
on the mushroom.

767
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,401
Oh.

768
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:38,403
(WHISTLING)

769
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,708
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

770
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,346
This way, Smurfs!
Let's follow Mr. Winslow.

771
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,016
Well, I can smurf an eye
on the mushroom.

772
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,285
Smurf away!

773
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,054
Whoo! Let's smurf this joint.
BRAINY: Is he down there?

774
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:53,357
Taxi!
Can you see him?

775
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:55,864
GUTSY: Look, he's getting
into the mechanical wagon.

776
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,422
Oh, no.
Clearly that distance
is too great...

777
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,196
Off you go!
No! Gutsy!

778
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,204
Come on, Smurfs!
Smurfabunga!

779
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,068
Goodbye, blue world.

780
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,870
Use your hat, you ninny!

781
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:09,044
GROUCHY: Couldn't we just
have taken the stairs?

782
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,307
There we go.
Not funny, Gutsy.

783
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,472
Oh!

784
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,607
It was a little funny.
PAPA: Shh! Smurfs.

785
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,744
PAPA: We're stopping.

Nervous energy's what's
going on up in here.

I like it.
Yep.

a fabulous motivator.

You're gonna get me fired.

breathe in there.
