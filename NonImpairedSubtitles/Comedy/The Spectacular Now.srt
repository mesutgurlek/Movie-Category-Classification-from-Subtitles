else equals B,

00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,684
(CHUCKLING)
Nice to meet you too.

156
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,152
What time is it, Aimee?

157
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,054
Uh, it's like 6:00 a.m.

158
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,060
Are you just getting back
from a party or somethin'?

159
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:45,497
No. No.
I'm just on my paper route.

160
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,631
I mean it's not really mine.

161
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,733
It's my mom's, but,

162
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,036
(INHALING DEEPLY) she was out with
my step-dad last night at a casino

163
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,572
so, um, they didn't
get back till late.

164
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,140
- Do you need help?
- So, I just...

165
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,541
- With my route?
- Yeah.

166
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,643
No, no, no.
I'm okay. Thank you, though.

167
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,978
I can help you.

168
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,013
I'm good. Thank you.

169
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,050
Aimee, you know,

170
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,251
you're driving around
the neighborhood,

171
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,920
and I don't know
where my car is,

172
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,256
so, I think that
we can help each other out.

173
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,893
What do you say?

174
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,594
Try aiming ahead
of the driveway.

175
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:22,968
Okay.

176
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,105
I didn't realize newspaper
throwing was such big business.

177
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,808
- You must make a lot of money.
- Yeah. I mean, my mom does.

178
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,943
- And you get nothing?
- No, I get a little.

179
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,713
Um, most of it goes towards
paying the bills, though, so...

180
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,082
That doesn't sound fair. You
do all the work, don't you?

181
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,117
Some of it. Most of it.

182
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,152
Aimee, she's your mom! She
should be paying all your bills.

183
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,022
- (LAUGHING) -I'm serious. That
doesn't sound fair to me.

184
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,892
I think you're getting the raw end
of this newspaper throwing deal.

185
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,560
It's fine.

186
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,028
I think I'm getting
the hang of it.

187
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,997
You should have seen me
back in the day.

188
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,199
- When I was in Little League I
had a pretty good arm. -Yeah?

189
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,268
Yeah. My dad said...

190
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,270
He said I could have
went pro if I stuck with it.

191
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,207
Yeah, dude, you're a natural.
Good job.

192
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,710
Whoo!

193
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,549
- Ah, shit, I hit a dog!
- (DOG YELPING)

194
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,716
(AIMEE LAUGHING)

195
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,085
- I'm serious!
- Sutter!

196
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,220
It's still walkin'.

197
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,926
- Whoa! Went way downtown!
- (LAUGHING)

198
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,095
You know, Aimee Finicky?

199
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,232
I was having a really rotten night
last night until you came along.

200
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,234
I think that we should
get lunch sometime.

201
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,902
Okay.

202
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,972
- How about Monday?
- Okay. Monday it is.

203
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,780
You're up early.

204
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:42,847
Yep.

205
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,149
Hmm...

206
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,184
They have me
on a double shift. Again.

207
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,689
Oh, damn it, Sutter.

208
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,860
Didn't I ask you
to hang this for me?

209
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,096
Look!
Look how wrinkled this is.

210
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,734
It would have taken you two
seconds to hang this up for me.

211
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,002
Is that too much to ask?

212
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,805
I forgot. I'm sorry.

213
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,673
You know, it's not like
you do so much around here.

214
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,976
- Hey! I do a lot around here.
- Hey!

215
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:15,814
Oh, I'm sorry. I hate to interrupt
your, uh, cheerio eating.

216
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:16,948
I'm sorry, Mom.

217
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,141
(SIGHING)

218
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,623
Sometimes you remind me
so much of your dad.

219
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,829
All right, there's
leftovers in the fridge.

220
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:34,132
I won't be home for dinner,
or, you can call your sister.

221
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,035
(SIGHING)

222
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,838
- And Sutter...
- Mmm-hmm?

223
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,308
Next time I ask you
to do something...

224
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,810
(CLICKING TONGUE)

225
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,713
I love you so much it hurts.

226
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,115
It hurts me
how much I love you.

227
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,983
You know what's
gonna really hurt?

228
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,986
Who knew dinner and a movie
would cost 30 bucks?

229
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,855
Pretty much anybody
who's ever been on a date.

230
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,957
Oh, but the best part
is, dude, she didn't care.

231
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,226
She paid for the popcorn
and everything.

232
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,662
She's just...

233
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,998
- What?
- (SIGHING)

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,066
(BOTH LAUGHING)

235
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,734
- Did you kiss her?
- Check.

236
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,936
- Yeah? Did you get a little tongue action?
- Double check.

237
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,673
- Nice. Nice. Yeah.
- (CHUCKLING)

238
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,408
Thanks, man.

239
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,276
So, what you wanna eat for lunch, man?
I'm starving.

240
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,358
Uh, aren't you eating
with what's her name?

241
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,015
Oh, shit. Yeah. I forgot.

242
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,152
You know, I gotta tell you, Sutter.
Aimee Finicky?

243
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,854
It's just a strange choice
for a rebound.

244
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,189
Dude, she's not a rebound.

245
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,825
Dude, she's not! Look.

246
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,895
Do I look like I have any
interest in dating Aimee Finicky?

247
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,930
I think she's a nice girl, man.

248
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,733
Whose mom makes her deliver newspapers
at 5 o'clock in the morning

249
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,735
six days a week,
pays half the bills...

250
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,204
- Aimee doesn't say shit about it.
- That sucks.

251
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,306
It's bullshit is what it is.

252
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,775
All right, so where
do you come in?

253
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,778
Um, I mean, I think
I can help her out.

254
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,147
So, if two planes intersect,

255
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,316
they intersect in exactly,
give it to me,

256
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,404
A one plane, B one
point, C one line...

257
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,186
(BELL RINGING)

258
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:05,356
Oh, that's lunch.
You lucky sons of guns.

259
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,493
Don't forget to do the homework.
Sutter, a word?

260
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,096
- Huh? -Please, Mr. Keely, sit
down, I have to have a word.

261
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,431
- I have somewhere to go.
- Good bye. Good bye, Hannah.

262
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,400
Don't be late tomorrow please.
Thank you.

263
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,469
You button up.

264
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,304
- What's up?
- What's up?

265
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,473
I noticed you didn't turn in
the homework.

266
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,841
Which is... That's fine man.

267
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:23,942
Cause I...

268
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,077
I did it last night and I...

269
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,446
Yeah. Stop talking.
Do me a favor. Stop talking.

270
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,815
All right. What's up?

271
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,517
You tell me, Sutter. I only
want to see you succeed.

272
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,053
- You know that, right?
- I know. I know.

273
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,021
If you fail,
that means I failed.

274
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,190
I like my job, I like you.
I don't wanna fail.

275
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,092
I know. I don't want you to... I
don't want you to fail either.

276
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,894
That's why
I'm not gonna let us fail.

277
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,896
- Uh-huh. -And I'm gonna
get it together.

278
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,364
- And I'm turning that corner, I can feel myself...
- Make me believe you.

279
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,299
Make me... I wanna believe you.

280
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,350
- I'm feelin' smarter already.
-All right.

281
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:50,301
Let me see you answer this.
All right.

282
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:55,306
If one acute angle is two
times larger than the other,

283
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,323
what's the measure
of the two angles?

284
00:12:57,349 --> 00:12:58,543
That's what I thought.

285
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:01,913
- That was not in the homework.
- That was the homework.

286
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,081
- No, it wasn't man! -Stay right
there, I'm gonna show you.

287
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,415
- We gonna do it together.
- (SIGHING)

288
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,138
We gonna do your homework together.
I love it.

289
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,874
That's crazy!
How fast were you going?

290
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,110
Like 20, 25 miles
an hour or something.

291
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,179
- And you just jumped out of the car?
- Yeah.

292
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,480
(LAUGHING) What?

293
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,416
It was snowing so
I didn't think it would hurt.

294
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,484
But it did.

295
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,252
That's amazing.

296
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,021
That's awesome.

297
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,489
You're such a good listener.

298
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,092
- No...
- Um, all right, you go.

299
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,965
Um, I remember, um,
I think it was sophomore year.

300
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,033
You came to gym class

301
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,435
and you were wearing
the mascot head

302
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,569
and you refused to take it off.

303
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,504
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah. (LAUGHING)

304
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:03,408
- Yeah, that was funny.
- Yeah, it was really funny.

305
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,450
Yeah. No, I mean, like
what's a story about you.

306
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,180
- About me?
- Yeah.

307
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,415
Um...

308
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:13,051
I don't really
have any stories.

309
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,973
What do you mean?
Everyone's got a story.

310
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,924
(CHUCKLING) Not me, I guess.

311
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:23,595
Um, all right, so, like, what's,
I don't know, what's your thing?

312
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:27,632
- My thing? -Yeah, you know,
everybody's got a thing.

313
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,467
Larry Rourke, stoner.

314
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,402
Uh, Greg Jacoby
is the rich kid.

315
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,405
What's, what's your thing?

316
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,075
I don't know,
I'd like to think that there's

317
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:40,198
more to a person than just one thing.
You know?

318
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,948
- Yeah.
- GIRL: Hello, Aimee.

319
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,118
- So, he, uh, finally got here, did he?
- Hey. This is Krystal.

320
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,922
- Hey, Krystal. Sutter Keely. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. I know who you are.

321
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,625
Uh, Aimee, come on,
French Club.

322
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,927
They're waiting for us.
Chop-chop!

323
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,328
I'm so sorry.

324
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,030
Oh, my God, I totally forgot
about French Club.

325
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,466
- I'm sorry.
- No. It's all good.

326
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:05,003
Um, hey, did you have, uh,
Mr. Aster for geometry class?

327
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,971
Yeah. Freshman year.

328
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,853
Probably thought
it was pretty easy?

329
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,010
Kind of. I don't know.

330
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,311
Yeah. I bet you did.

331
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,281
Uh, would you mind
like tutoring me?

332
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,515
'Cause he's talking
all the time,

333
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,550
I have no idea
what he's saying.

334
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,153
Yeah. Sure, totally. Um...

335
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,656
Yeah. Just, uh...

336
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,591
You can just like,
call me and...

337
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,559
Yeah.

338
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,329
Just call me.

339
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,266
Awesome.

340
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,938
Nice meeting you too. Pleasure.

341
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,340
- See you later.
- All right. Bye.

342
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,146
- You have great taste in bow ties.
- Thank you.

343
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:51,389
That was my favorite. I would
have bought it if you didn't.

344
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,325
MAN: See you at home.

345
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,969
Hmm...

346
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,104
- What do you think of that?
- You're getting better.

347
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,573
- That's really good. That's the
best I've seen yet. -All right.

348
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,108
When you gonna adopt me?

349
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,143
(CHUCKLING) I'm sorry, uh,

350
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,579
- two's my limit on mouths to feed.
- Okay.

351
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,147
Offer's still there.

352
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,416
- What were we talking about?
- Um, Cassidy.

353
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,684
Ah!

354
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,486
- Yeah.
- (EXHALING) Pfft...

355
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,050
I liked her.

356
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:30,455
Yeah. Me too. (SCOFFING)

357
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:35,259
Kinda thought she'd be the one
to yank you out of neutral.

358
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,462
Neutral? What are you talking about, Dan?
I'm in overdrive.

359
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,330
- (CHUCKLING)
- What?

360
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,681
- Aimee!
- Shane, shut up!

361
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,521
- Hey!
- Hey.

362
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,223
- How are you?
- Good.

363
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,591
- Good.
- All right.

364
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,159
Come on in.

365
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,596
Hey.

366
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,332
- This is my brother Shane.
- Hey, Shane.

367
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,772
- He just learned that. Yeah.
- Charming.

368
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,808
- We can study in my room.
- Lead the way.

369
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,584
Wow! This is...

370
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,087
It's really nice.

371
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,456
Thank you.
I try to keep it clean.

372
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,525
There's a lot of stuff everywhere.
(LAUGHING)

373
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,260
SUTTER: You read a lot?
You like books?

374
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,462
AIMEE: I do, actually,
I love books.

375
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,464
They're mostly
just science fiction.

376
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,166
A few mysteries

377
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,468
and other things.

378
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,804
- That one is really weird.
- This is the weird one?

379
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,106
- You picked a really weird one.
- Weird is good.

380
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,175
Let's embrace the weird.

381
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,410
It's really weird.

382
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,713
- Is this backwards? Why... -Yeah.
It's just the way that you read them.

383
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,715
Let me see. You start...

384
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,386
Back here. It's the beginning.

385
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,321
- Yep.
- Cool.

386

387
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,126

<i>- Gleaming Planet.</i> (LAUGHING)

388
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:19,497
- Is this... Is that you
flying through space? -No.

389
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,133
No. She's just a character
from those books.

390
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,835
It's, like, really stupid.

391
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,837
No, it's not stupid. If you
like it, it's not stupid.

392
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,505
Yeah. Well...

393
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,674
What makes her so special?

394
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:34,312
Um, she's in charge of this
thing called the Neexo Ark.

395
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:37,582
And it's up to her to
escape the Dark Galaxy,

396
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,518
and save the Gleaming
Planet's star system.

397
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:47,291
Yeah. I don't know, like, I
know it's odd and stuff, but...

398
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,596
She's actually really awesome.
She's kind of my hero.

399
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:57,468
Well, you will be my hero if you can
help me out with this geometry business.

400
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,139
I have no idea what I'm doing.

401
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,509
- Is this the right book?
- Yes.

402
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:07,478
How much of
it have you studied?

403
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,348
- Studied's a strong word.
- (LAUGHING)

Got it. Got it.

406
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:21,225
Man, you're a wonderful
teacher, Miss Finicky.

407
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,362
- So, you understand it?
- Yeah.

408
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,731
Well, what I don't understand is
why I need to know this stuff.

409
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,300
Because, I mean seriously,
like, who, like,

410
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:32,236
cal... Coplanar lines
and angles and stuff,

411
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,373
like, who calculates slopes at their job?
Who needs this shit?

412
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:39,644
MRS. FINICKY: Aimee! Come on
out here right now, will you!

413
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,313
I thought you were going
to get us some milk.

414
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,449
- I will!
- Do it now, for crissakes!

415
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,654
- I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

416
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,455
- I should probably...
- Yeah...

417
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:55,593
Um, hey, there is
a party on Saturday

418
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,862
and I think that
you should go with me.

419
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,630
- Me?
- Yeah.

420
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,599
- What? -Yeah. I'll come
by and pick you up.

421
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,435
- How's that sound?
- Um...

422
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,405
Okay?

423
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,807
- Is that an answer or a question?
- No, no, it's an answer.

424
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,910
- If you don't wanna go...
- No, I do, I do.

425
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,279
I would like that. Thank you.

reading one last night.

- Yeah, it's really cool.

where Shirei Migoto uh...

- You know that I can't help myself.
- Sutter! Please.

459
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,655
Maybe just a little...
That's good.

460
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:13,023
- Cassidy.
- Hey!

461
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,458
- Hey.
- Sutter.

462
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,693
Marcus.

463
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,898
I gotta get going.
You riding with me?

464
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,867
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Let's go.

465
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,738
- It was good to see you.
- Next time.

466
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,462
Just a flick of the wrist.
Works every time. Really.

467
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:54,498
- Hey, What's up, man? Everything cool?
- What's up, Sutter?

468
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,501
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

469
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:01,205
- I'm just gonna go for a walk. You wanna come with me?
- Yeah. I would love to.

470
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:02,873
- All right, cool.
- Cool.

471
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,675
- All right.
- Cheers.

472
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,177
- Nice to meet you. -It was,
it was good to meet you.

473
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:07,845
Motherfucker.

474
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,120
- Hey, I'm sorry if that guy was bugging you.
- No, he's fine, really fine.

475
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,055
Yeah? Okay. Done?

476
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,793
- Ooh, can I try that?
- What, this?

477
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,095
- Yeah. -I don't know. This is
some pretty serious stuff.

478
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,931
- Just a taste.
- You sure?

479
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:29,934
- Yes. -All right. Here you go.
Go for it.

480
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,003
It's pretty strong.

481
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,473
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

482
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,208
- Eww!
- Yeah. Yeah. I know.

483
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,609
- Whoa! - I know. - I told you.
- How do you drink that?

484
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:44,615
I don't know, I guess I've just been
doin' it for a while. I don't know.

485
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:46,750
- (LAUGHING) -You know who
gave me my first beer?

486
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:47,952
- Who?
- My dad.

487
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:51,489
- Really? -Yeah. I was
probably six years old.

488
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:55,559
He used to take me to baseball games every
Saturday and then let me have little sips of it.

489
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:58,929
- Did you get drunk? -No, I
didn't get drunk, but I mean,

490
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:01,966
it tasted really nice
and felt warm.

491
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:04,034
Where is he now, your dad?

492
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,103
- He's an airline pilot.
- Really?

493
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,572
- Yeah, he flies all across the country.
- Sutter, that's awesome!

494
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:13,577
Dude, he is awesome. I don't know what
he was doing with my mom for that long.

495
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:17,882
- Are they, like, divorced? -Yeah. She
made him leave us a long time ago.

496
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,720
- Want some more? Try it. Yeah?
Why not? -Um, sure.

497
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:26,957
- Kind of sounds like we have the same mom.
- Yeah? How so?

498
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,126
Um... Well, for example,

499
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:32,930
I got into college today, but there's no
way that my mom will let me go, so...

500
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,565
- You got into college today?
- Mmm-hmm.

501
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:37,301
- That's awesome!
- Yeah. Thank you.

502
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,270
- Congratulations.
- In Philadelphia.

503
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,239
Which is really cool, 'cause that's
where my sister lives, but...

504
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:45,075
Aimee, I don't know what to say. That's...
Dude, that's awesome.

505
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,877
- Congratulations! Very cool.
- Thanks.

506
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,146
Doesn't matter, I mean, It's
not that big of a deal.

507
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:52,149
- There's no way that I'll go, so it's not.
- What are you talking about?

508
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,151
Well, I mean my mom, I have
to help her with the route.

509
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,020
What does your mom have to do with this?
The route?

510
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,922
- She has the route, she's alone.
- The paper route?

511
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:00,024
- Yeah, she's alone, she needs...
- Aimee, your mom

512
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:03,561
is a grown woman. She can take
care of the paper route herself.

513
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:06,163
You are definitely
going to Philly.

514
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,677
Yeah, 100% you're
going to Philly.

515
00:26:07,703 --> 00:26:09,233
- Yeah, no, but...
- Yeah, you are.

516
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:13,337
No, dude, there's no buts about it.
Aimee, don't you understand?

517
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,774
You are this, like, incredibly
gifted genius person,

518
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:19,643
and you've got all these people around
you telling you that you can't do shit.

519
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,980
And that's gotta stop. You need to
start standing up for yourself.

520
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,949
- How?
- How? I'll teach you.

521
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:27,818
Take another swig
of that stuff.

522
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,921
Get that, get that down there.
Down the hatch!

523
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,058
Okay. Now repeat after me.

524
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,827
"Mom, get off
my motherfucking back!"

525
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,330
- What!
- Yes!

526
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:40,698
- No!
- Yeah.

527
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,266
- I can't!
- Say it.

528
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,370
- Mom... Get off of my back.
- No.

529
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,072
- You gotta do the motherfucking.
- I can't.

530
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,274
Yes, you can. Do it. Say it.

531
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:53,844
- Mom, get off of my fucking back.
- Motherfucking!

532
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:54,551
Fuck! Motherfuck! - Go!

533
00:26:54,577 --> 00:26:55,746
Motherfucking!
- Motherfuck, yes!

534
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:59,717
- Get off my motherfucking back, Mom!
- Yes!

535
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,127
God! Yeah!
- God! Motherfucking!

536
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,620
That's good. - That's awesome!

537
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:06,023
Good. Who else?
Who else? I like this.

538
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,959
I don't know. Stay out of my
motherfucking business, Krystal.

539
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,329
- Fuck you, Krystal.
- Yeah, fuck you Krys...

540
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,065
What about...
What about like ex-boyfriends?

541
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,134
- Um... -We need an
ex-boyfriend in there.

542
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,771
- No, I don't have any. -Who's like an
ex-boyfriend that really pissed you off.

543
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:26,110
- That you just, like, hate him and they're just, like...
- I don't have an ex-boyfriend.

544
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:28,212
- What?
- Yeah.

545
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:30,247
You don't have a single, you're 17 years
old and you don't have an ex-boyfriend?

546
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,556
No! - Really?
- Guys don't look at me like that.

547
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:31,689
That's shocking.

548
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:32,116
- I mean, guys... -Yeah, absolutely
guys look at you like that.

549
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:37,354
- No, no, no... -I just saw two
guys look at you like that.

550
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,090
Uh, Erik Wolff and Cody Dennis
were 100% hitting on you.

551
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,992
- No, we were just talking.
- A hundred percent.

552
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,994
- No, no, there was absolutely no way...
- Yes, they were.

553
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,964
- Why don't you think they were hitting on you?
- Because I'm just...

554
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,699
- They weren't.
- Because you're what?

555
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:51,669
- Aimee, you're absolutely beautiful.
- Oh, my God! No.

556
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,087
(GROANING)

557
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,826
(GRUNTING)

558
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,424
SUTTER: <i>Of course</i>
<i>you're going to the prom!</i>

559
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,318
<i>I'll take you.</i>

560
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,387
Please go to
the prom with me, Aimee!

561
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:47,858
Yes.

562
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:54,364
- So, you're taking her to prom?
- Yeah. It's no big deal.

563
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:57,267
It's you making plans, Sutter.
It's kind of a big deal.

564
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:01,772
Relax! I'm just trying
to help this girl out.

565
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:04,854
- Right, I forgot. Sutter to the rescue.
- Exactly.

566
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,945
(SUTTER HUMMING A TUNE)

567
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,948
And if she falls for you?
What happens then?

568
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,252
Shut up.

569
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,955
Are you kidding me?

570
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,195
VOICEMAIL: <i>Hey, Sutter, it's Aime.
Um...</i>

571
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:27,331
<i>I didn't know if we were
gonna study today or not,</i>

572
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,501
<i>but I hadn't heard</i>
<i>from you, so...</i>

573
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:35,038
<i>Yeah, yesterday was...</i>
<i>I had a really great tim.</i>

574
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,877

<i>you later. Bye.</i>

576
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,977
- Or the lightning storm.
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)

577
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,946
On the roof.

578
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,149
That was amazing.

579
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,519
I've never felt like
that with anyone.

580
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:25,289
- It's not very often.
- Except with you.

581
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,451
Actually, I think I'm feeling it right now.
I'm feeling a moment.

582
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:31,361
- Stop it. - What?

583
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:37,501
Cass, look, seriously, when we're together
it's like we're invincible or somethin'.

584
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:41,305
All the shit of the world, like the
responsibilities, all the problems, that stuff,

585
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:44,308
man, that just disappears
when I'm with you.

586
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,245
Well, you can't just have fun all the time.
You have to be serious.

587
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:51,215
- Hey, I'm 100% serious.
- Yeah? About what?

588
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:53,250
About not being serious.

589
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,022
Did you even
apply to college yet?

590
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,591
I don't need college.
Who needs that shit?

591
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:03,861
Look, I got everything
I need right here.

592
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:08,031
I've got a job, I've got a car, I've got
a beautiful girl sittin' next to me.

593
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,101
You think beauty's in some classroom or
some text book or something and it's not.

594
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:15,172
That's not what it's about. This,
right here, this is beautiful.

595
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:16,273
All of this...

596
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,376
That's all you need.

597
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,081
You're drunk.

598
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:28,252
I'm drunk. You, whatever, you're drunk.
It doesn't matter.

599
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:31,188
Okay, whatever,
I'm right, you're right.

600
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,223
I'm just saying
you gotta live in the moment.

601
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,158
The moment? I want...

602
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,363
I want...

603
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,431
I want more than a moment.

604
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,067
- I want...
- What?

605
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,905
I want a future.

606
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,550
And you can't do that.

607
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,922
Wow.

608
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,593
Wow.

609
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,196
(SIGHING) Uh...

610
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,265
Okay.

611
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,262
- (SOBBING) Please just go, Sutter.
- Don't...

612
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,005
Please just go.

613
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,541
All right.

614
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,596
What's up with you and Cassidy?

615
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:50,367
- Look, man, I don't want any trouble.
- Tell me the truth.

616
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:53,737
Nothing's up, man. She's moved on.
I've moved on...

617
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:56,440
- You've moved on? -We just
hang out and we have...

618
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,241
Oh! Okay, wow.
Come on, come on.

619
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:01,645
We have fun but there's nothing going on.
I promise you.

620
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:16,059
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

621
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:19,062
Why can't it be me
she has fun with?

622
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:22,232
- What? -Why can't it be
me that she has fun with?

623
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:25,002
I'm not like you, Sutter. I don't
know how to make her laugh and stuff.

624
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,070
Dude! You are Marcus West, man.

625
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:29,539
You are the star athlete,
you're the class president.

626
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:34,478
Like, you are awesome. What's the name
of that charity that you started?

627
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,215
- The Hope Squadron. -The fucking
Hope Squadron, man! That is awesome!

628
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:41,752
- Seriously, you do not need my help. You're the man!
- No, no. It's not the same,

629
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:44,554
okay? Look, the way
she talks about you, man.

630
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,656
I want her to like
me like that. And she doesn't.

631
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:50,260
Dude, Marcus, trust me.
You don't wanna be like me.

632
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:54,431
I make jokes, yeah. But, I
mean, you get shit done.

633
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:58,602
You're gonna change the world, man. You
and Cass are perfect together. Trust me.

634
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:02,372
You're just too tense, man. A little tense.
You gotta loosen up, you know?

635
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,241
Yeah. Maybe, maybe.

636
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,476
- Hey, not everything has
to be so serious. -Yeah.

637
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,346
Man, I'm just saying like,
you can relax, you know?

638
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:13,250
You're awesome, man. Enjoy being who you are.
Live in the now.

639
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,485
- Embrace that shit.
- Yeah.

640
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,223
Hey, uh, thanks for, uh,

641
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,259
thanks for talking to me like this, Sutter.
I appreciate it.

642
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,828
- Hey, absolutely, man. Pleasure.
- I appreciate it, I really do.

643
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,797
- Any time.
- Sorry about the...

644
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:29,066
It's cool. Good.

645
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,474
- Hey, Sutter?
- Hmm?

646
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,243
They're wrong about you.

647
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,145
What's that?

648
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,381
You're not the joke
everyone thinks, man.

649
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,732
GIRL: <i>Just who do</i>
<i>you think you are?</i>

650
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,301
The King of Mexico.

651
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,269
You're not gonna joke
your way out of this, Sutter.

652
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,172
Aimee told me about
your little party by the lake.

653
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:10,540
And?

654
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,642
- And now you're avoiding her.
- I'm not avoiding her.

655
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:15,612
Really? Have you seen her since the party?
Have you even called?

656
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:19,282
Okay, look, why don't you get off my
back a little bit? Give me some space?

657
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:23,286
- I knew she got that from you. She said
the exact same thing. -Good. Good for her.

658
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,856
No, it's not good for her.
Aimee isn't like you, Sutter.

659
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:28,692
She's a sweet girl. She doesn't need
you causing problems in her life.

660
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:33,597
Okay, what Aimee doesn't need is you bossing
her around like she's your personal assistant.

661
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,800
- You shouldn't treat her this way.
- Thank you. Good talk.

662
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,438
(EXHALING)

663
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,291
- Hi!
- Hey.

664
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:02,859
- Hi.
- What's up?

665
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,728
(LAUGHING) Nothing. What are
you, what are you doing?

666
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,763
I didn't know you were
coming over today.

667
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:09,833
Yeah, I wasn't planning on coming
over, but I was driving around

668
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:13,370
and I thought, "I don't care how busy I am.
I should see what Aimee is doing"

669
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:16,406
- so, what... How are you doing, Aimee?
- (GIGGLING)

670
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,294
I'm good. I'm really good.
How are you, Sutter?

671
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,276
- I'm, I'm good. - Good.

672
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:25,482
Yeah, listen, my sister, she's having
this, fancy dinner party for her friends

673
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,571
and she's making me go. I

674
00:36:26,597 --> 00:36:27,918
didn't know you had a sister?

675
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,288
Yeah, well,
we're not really that close.

676
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,424
Yeah. But, would
you wanna go with me?

677
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,259
- To your... To dinner?
- Yeah.

678
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,495
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- Okay. Cool.

679
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,666
- Yeah. What time?
- 10 minutes?

680
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:43,934
- Oh, 10 minutes from now. -Yeah.

681
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:45,202
Okay.

682
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,378
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

683
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,415
So, then I go back up
to the table and I say,

684
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,951
you know, "Can I get you
boys anything else?"

685
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:02,137
And then he says...
Okay, I'm gonna let

686
00:37:02,163 --> 00:37:03,320
you say it, what did,
what did you say?

687
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:08,291
Well, I leaned back in my chair,
puffed my chest out and I said,

688
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:10,260
"You can give me
your number, gorgeous."

689
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:11,962
- (PEOPLE TITTERING)
- That's right.

690
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:14,564
(CHUCKLING) And I didn't even know
that he was a big fancy lawyer.

691
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,333
You know,
I just gave it to him anyway.

692
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,569
And I am so glad that I did.

693
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,638
And she hasn't worked
a day in her life since.

694
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,873
He's right. That's true.

695
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,842
(CHUCKLING) That's...

696
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,924
Wow. You guys sure are
a breath of fresh air.

697
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,014
Oh, thank you, Sutter.

698
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:33,450
It's rare to see such
a happy couple nowadays.

699
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:35,572
I feel like everyone's
getting divorced.

700
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,721
Well, that's not true.

701
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:43,560
Isn't it? Well, our parents, Aimee's
parents, most of my friend's parents...

702
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,629
- Kid's got a point.
- SUTTER: Thank you, Joe.

703
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,665
- Mine didn't. -I thought you
said your parents were divorced.

704
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,767
- No.
- There you go, Sutter. See?

705
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,569
Not everything is doomed.

706
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,406
- My dad died.
- What?

707
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,444
I am so sorry...

708
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,480
- (EXHALING)
- AIMEE: No.

709
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:05,448
- It's okay, it's not your fault.
- I'm so... What happened?

710
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,650
AIMEE: Um...

711
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:08,818
Well, I mean, he was
a really great guy.

712
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,656
He just kind of had like a slight
problem with painkillers, mostly.

713
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,692
Yeah.

714
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,495
It was really crazy. I mean, he
tried to stop a bunch of times,

715
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:20,430
but my sister came home one day

716
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,632
and he was just lying there
on the kitchen floor.

717
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,035
And she had to, like,
close his eyes and everything.

718
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:28,538
- Wow.
- It was pretty, yeah, intense.

719
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:34,511
(CHUCKLING)
Sorry. That was really dark.

720
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,513
Um, anyways, I just...

721
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:38,615
I know that
my marriage will work.

722
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,650
- Oh yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

723
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,519
I've thought it all out.

724
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:46,389
My husband and I will both
live on a horse ranch and

725
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,958
I will work for NASA

726
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,428
and he'll do something
completely different.

727
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,716
Just so that we offset
each other, you know.

728
00:38:52,742 --> 00:38:53,830
Like, we'll have some
things in common

729
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:58,668
but then we'll also bring all these
different dimensions to the table.

730
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,671
So that, you know,
life doesn't get boring.

731
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,774
I know it's gonna work.

732
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,043
Sounds like a dream.

733
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,514
I think it's good
to have dreams. Don't you?

734
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,623
- To dreams.
- HOLLY: To dreams.

735
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,065
- I wanna ask you somethin'.
- Okay.

736
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,634
- Okay.
- Okay.

737
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,803
Did you mean
what you said at the party?

738
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,639
What? What?

739
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,975
(CHUCKLING) What?

740
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,977
- You know.
- No, I don't.

741
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:46,883
Yes. Like the kidding about,
like the prom, or whatever.

742
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,586
Yeah, of course I remember that.
Are you kidding me?

743
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:51,554
How could I forget
something like that?

744
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,690
No, I just mean like, if
you changed your mind

745
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:58,461
or you didn't wanna go,
or anything, I totally get it.

746
00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:01,097
- What are you talking about?
- No, I just...

747
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,134
I wouldn't have asked you to go
if I didn't wanna go with you.

748
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:08,071
- Look, I know...
- I wouldn't. I wouldn't have.

749
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,672
- Okay.
- Okay.

750
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:14,043
I'm just saying that I know
people change their minds,

751
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:15,712
- and it's not that big of a deal.

00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:42,731
Mmm...

911
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,202
- Ah... Oh, my gosh.
- What?

912
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:47,703
- What? What?
- Sutter.

913
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:50,239
- Sutter. Guess what?
Guess what? -What?

914
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:51,841
- My sister called me today.
- Uh-huh...

915
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:54,477
And she said
that she could probably

916
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:58,447
almost 100% likely, get me
a job at the book store.

917
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,748
- In Philadelphia?
- Yes!

918
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,183
That's awesome. You love books!

919
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:02,551
I know! I know. It's perfect.

920
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:04,520
That's the perfect job for you.

921
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:06,188
It really is.

922
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,657
It'll help pay for college
and... Yeah.

923
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,793
Yeah.

924
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,561
Did you talk to your mom yet?

925
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:15,498
No, but, I will.

926
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:17,800
Eventually.

927
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,138
(SIGHING)

928
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,607
It's pretty.

929
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,877
- Okay.
- Hmm?

930
00:52:27,879 --> 00:52:29,919
- (LAUGHING) I'm sorry.
- (LAUGHING)

931
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,714
Come here. I'm sorry.

932
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,854
- So abusive.
- So sorry.

933
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:43,726
Back to what I was saying.

934
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:48,564
I have been thinking
a lot recently.

935
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,767
A lot more than normal.

936
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:54,703
And I think that
you should come with me.

937
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,640
To...

938
00:52:57,642 --> 00:52:58,774
- Philly.
- Philadelphia?

939
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:01,210
- Yes. Yes.
- Uh-huh.

940
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:03,212
I've been, like,
looking all into it

941
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:06,315
and you can go
to a junior college,

942
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:09,752
and we could both
get jobs downtown.

943
00:53:09,754 --> 00:53:12,254
I mean it could be,
like, really awesome.

944
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:13,923
- Have you ever seen, or been, to Philly?
- (LAUGHING)

945
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:15,791
- Have you seen the Liberty Bell?
- No.

946
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:17,526
(STAMMERING) I haven't either,

947
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:21,330
(LAUGHING) but, but, the pictures
of it are really beautiful.

948
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:23,432
It's awesome.

949
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:25,868
You've been thinking about
this for a while, haven't you?

950
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,571
I have. I have, yeah.

951
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:30,209
And, like, the coolest
thing ever, also...

952
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:31,540
When I was talking
to my sister...

953
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:36,345
- Besides the Liberty Bell? -Yes.
There's just so many cool things!

954
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:40,416
She said that there's, like,
tons of vacancies available.

955
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:42,618
- Listen to me. I'm talking!
- I'm listening, I'm listening.

956
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:47,223
Um, she said that there's tons of
vacancies available in her building,

957
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,558
- because of, like, the economy
and stuff, so... -Mmm-hmm.

958
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:54,530
Um, we could totally just move there
at the end of June, together.

959
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:57,900
And it would be really
inexpensive and awesome and...

960
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:01,904
What do you think?

961
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,340
Uh...

962
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:05,941
I think that's great.

963
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,911
- Really?
- Yeah.

964
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:17,453
- I, uh... I did it.
- What?

965
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:20,656
I talked to my mom.

966
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:22,725
I just walked in and I said

967
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:24,960
"It's my life and I'm not gonna
let you stand in the way of it."

968
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:28,364
- How'd that go?
- It was pretty ugly at first.

969
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:30,532
She said all these things and
tried to guilt me into staying.

970
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:31,967
But, I just said,

971
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:34,870
"Look, like if I can afford it
then I'm leaving,"

972
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:37,840
"and there's really nothing
that you can do about it."

973
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:40,643
- That's awesome. I'm proud of you!
- Yeah. Thank you.

974
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:41,910
I'm proud of me!

975
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:45,414
It wasn't that bad. You'll see.

976
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:46,849
- What?
- When you do it.

977
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:48,017
What are you talkin' about?

978
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:50,519
Sutter! We had a deal!

979
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:52,421
Ah, yeah. I don't know.

980
00:54:52,574 --> 00:54:53,023
What?

981
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:57,293
- You can totally do it.
Trust me. -Different.

982
00:54:57,295 --> 00:54:59,928
No. Okay. Look.
Repeat after me.

983
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,864
Say "I wanna call my dad, Mom."

984
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:03,866
"I wanna motherfucking
call him!"

985
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:06,568
That's not fair.

986
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,042
What's wrong?

987
00:55:13,044 --> 00:55:15,444
Nothing. I just wanted
to ask you something.

988
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:17,746
- Okay. What is it?
- It's about Dad.

989
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,618
- Oh, Sutter...
- I wanna talk to him.

990
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,861
- Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?

991
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,958
- He's my dad. -And I'm your mom
and you live under my roof.

992
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:32,995
Okay.
Well, I just wanna call him.

993
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,365
Sutter, this is my job.

994
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,634
We can have
this conversation later, okay?

995
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,338
No wonder he left you.

996
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,656
How do you like the
landscaping we did back here?

997
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:03,559
Joe and I planted some day lilies back
there, I don't know if you saw them.

998
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:06,628
- Yeah, it looks really good. It
looks really good. -Really pretty.

999
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:11,100
So, like I was talking on the phone,
I wanted to ask you about Dad.

1000
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:13,435
You want to
dredge that up, huh?

1001
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:16,505
Dredge? What are you talking about?
Dad's not somebody that you dredge.

1002
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:18,674
He's awesome.

1003
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:21,877
Hey, do you remember he used to tell
stories in the tent in the backyard?

1004
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,146
- Remember that?
- I think that was mostly you.

1005
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:27,516
Well, do you remember when we
made that trip down to Mexico?

1006
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:30,119
And he had us going up to people asking
where the belt buckle museum was?

1007
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:33,922
And, "Why is there
no artichoke ice cream?"

1008
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,991
That was hilarious!

1009
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:38,861
- Don't, look... It was funny!
- It was embarrassing.

1010
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:42,164
No, it wasn't. It was funny.
People loved us.

1011
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:45,534
They loved you because
you were little and cute.

1012
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,104
The guys liked you.
They loved you.

1013
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:52,741
Thought you were a hot little <i>muchacha.
Mmm-hmm, you liked it.</i>

1014
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:53,976
(SIGHING) Well...

1015
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:55,611
Yeah, uh-huh.

1016
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:58,080
He did know how
to make friends, at least.

1017
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,882
Damn right he did.

1018
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,586
So...

1019
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,688
Do you know what happened
between him and mom?

1020
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,524
He cheated on her.

1021
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:11,627
Yeah. Well,
that's her version of it.

1022
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:13,629
And you think it's a lie.

1023
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:16,598
I don't think she's lying, but I think
there's two sides to every story.

1024
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,767
- Think about it.
- Sutter...

1025
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,869
Okay look, she won't let us see him. She
won't even let us know where he is.

1026
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:24,006
Let's talk about something else.
How is your friend Aimee?

1027
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:26,041
Okay, no, you gotta admit,
it's a little suspicious.

1028
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:28,177
I mean, I don't even... She won't
even give me his phone number.

1029
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:30,212
I can't talk to the guy.

1030
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:36,685
Every time that I ask her for his
number, she refuses to give it to me.

1031
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:40,087
Can you please ask her
for his number for me?

1032
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:43,959
Please?

1033
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,229
I don't have to ask her.

1034
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,102
I know where he is.

1035
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:55,471
What?

1036
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,884
(DOOR SHUTTING)

1037
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,970
Thank you. Thanks.

1038
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:33,642
Thanks.

1039
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,515
- Hey, Sutter?
- Hmm?

1040
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:43,519
Come by for lunch sometime.
Okay?

1041
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,755
Okay. I will. Promise!

1042
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,045
(CLEARING THROAT)

1043
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,116
- MAN: <i>Hello?</i>
<i>- Uh...</i>

1044
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:17,019
- Dad? <i>-No, you got
the wrong number.</i>

1045
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,223
- No, it's, it's me, Sutter.
<i>- Sutter?</i>

1046
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:29,965
<i>- Sutter, how, how you do?</i>
<i>- Uh, yeah, I'm all right.</i>

1047
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:34,303
<i>You sound like a... You sound
like a man from here now.</i>

1048

<i>Well, yeah, you, uh...
Well, hey,

1049
00:59:36,262 --> 00:59:37,940
you still playing ball?</i> What?

1050
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:44,646
<i>I mean, you know, your arm, you were
small for your age, but, you...</i>

1051
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:47,816
<i>You were a hell of a pitch.</i>
<i>You still playing ball?</i>

1052
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:52,321
Wow. Yeah. I'm surprised
that you remember that, Dad.

1053
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:56,191
<i>What are you talkin' about "do I remember that"?
Of course I remember that.</i>

1054
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:58,961
<i>- Are you still throw?</i>
<i>- Naw, not really.</i>

1055
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:03,699
- Haven't thrown much lately. <i>-Well, it's a shame.
You were a hell of a pitcher.</i>

1056
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:06,101
<i>You had a great . So how...</i>

1057
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:11,707
(COUGHING) <i>How's your, how's
your mom and, and Holly doin'?</i>

1058
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:14,743
They're, they're good.
Yeah. Real good.

1059
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:18,947
<i>Oh, good, good. That's, that's tremendous, son.
That's good. That's good.</i>

1060
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,050
Listen, Dad...

1061
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,416
I was thinking, could I come

1062
01:00:25,442 --> 01:00:27,089
see you sometime? <i>Come see me.</i>

1063
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:32,227
<i>Well, yeah, of course. What do
you mean "can you come see me?"</i>

1064
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:35,897
<i>- You can come see me any damn
time you wanna see . -Really?</i>

1065
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:38,834
<i>What do you mean "really?"</i>
<i>Of course you can come see me.</i>

1066
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:41,837
<i>Yeah, you come over, like, Friday,
like around 3:00 or somethin'</i>

1067
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,939
<i>maybe we go</i>
<i>see a game or somethin'.</i>

1068
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:45,774
Yeah, uh, wow, really?

1069
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:49,711
Dad, that would be so great.
I'd really like that.

1070
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:53,382
AIMEE: <i>How much further is it?</i>

1071
01:00:53,384 --> 01:00:55,784
Uh, it's about three hours.

1072
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:02,257
- Hey, Aim, thank you.
- For what?

1073
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:05,027
I wouldn't have done
this without you.

1074
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,070
All right. Here we are.

1075
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,709
- I think I need that shot of whiskey now.
- (LAUGHING)

1076
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:30,471
- Knock again?
- Yeah.

1077
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,424
Yeah?

1078
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:38,026
SUTTER: Hey!

1079
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,063
Dad! Uh...

1080
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:43,198
It's Sutter.

1081
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,867
Oh, shit, of course! You, uh...

1082
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,070
Oh, man, I...

1083
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,808
Look at you. Of course, you...

1084
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:56,812
- You're taller than I am! -Yeah.
I grew a lot last summer.

1085
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:58,280
Yeah, you...

1086
01:01:58,282 --> 01:02:00,982
I was, no, I was just, um...

1087
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:02,451
I was...

1088
01:02:02,453 --> 01:02:05,453
- How are you? Come...
come here! -Hey!

1089
01:02:07,706 --> 01:02:08,991
And, who...

1090
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:13,028
- Oh, sorry. This is Aimee.
This is my girlfriend. -Hi.

1091
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,296
This is my...
Aimee, this is my dad.

1092
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:16,098
- Aimee, how you doin'?
- Nice to meet you.

1093
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,167
It's very nice to meet you.

1094
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:23,472
It's very nice to see that Sutter's
got immaculate taste in the ladies.

1095
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:27,008
He, uh... He gets that from
his old man, you know.

1096
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:30,212
He gets that from his old man.
Look at you, man!

1097
01:02:30,214 --> 01:02:33,381
Uh, you caught me
at just a bad time right now.

1098
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:36,351
I was gonna head out to catch
up with some friends of mine,

1099
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:39,009
but since you're here now, if you wanna
come along, that would be great.

1100
01:02:39,035 --> 01:02:40,355
- Yeah.
- Would you like to do that?

1101
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:42,878
Yeah. I'd love to, right?
We'd love to come with you.

1102
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:45,026
Yeah, absolutely.
- Is that right? - Yeah.

1103
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:48,897
Well, listen, take your car and
you can follow me up there.

1104
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:52,367
It's just up the street and we'll
go get a drink. Sound good?

1105
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:55,237
Yeah. Cool. Yeah, let's do it.

1106
01:02:55,239 --> 01:03:00,509
Hey, guys. Hey, this is my son Sutter.
Sutter, this is the guys.

1107
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:04,379
And this, this is the most beautiful
woman in the entire state.

1108
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,548
- This is Roberta.
- Hey. How you doin'?

1109
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,517
Last week you said the country.

1110
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:10,252
And I meant the entire country.

1111
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:13,255
And this, again,
is the amazing Sutter Keely.

1112
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:17,559
Roberta, and this is his
amazing uh, lady friend um...

1113
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:19,081
- Aimee.
- Aimee.

1114
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:23,799
Get your good looks
from your mother, did ya?

1115
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,066
(GIGGLING)

1116
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,208
She can be touchy sometimes.

1117
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,010
Listen... Hey, let's sit down
over there.

1118
01:03:35,012 --> 01:03:36,411
Sit down, I'll get us
some drinks, all right?

1119
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:38,146
- Mmm-hmm.
- Go on.

1120
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:45,420
Hey, Sal. Give me two pitchers.

1121
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,563
You've never been to Key West?

1122
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:57,032
- No.
- Key West is the place to be.

1123
01:03:57,034 --> 01:04:00,168
Key West has got sunsets...

1124
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,104
That are like
butterscotch sundaes

1125
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:07,576
with strawberry swirl mixed in and
it just melts right into the ocean.

1126
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:10,312
And everybody has got
a drink in their hand

1127
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:13,515
and a smile on their face.
That's Key West.

1128
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:17,085
- Wow. That sounds perfect.
- Yeah.

1129
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:20,388
It was perfect. And I wish you
could have been there with me.

1130
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:23,291
So how come you left?

1131
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:25,327
What do you mean,
how come I left?

1132
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:28,463
Uh, Key West.
How come you left Key West?

1133
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:31,600
'Cause I ran out of money,
that's why I left Key West.

1134
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:35,270
If I could have stayed down
there I would have, believe me.

1135
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,115
Hey, I'm gonna play
a song on the jukebox.

1136
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:50,185
- Good. You do that, I'll get us a refill.
- Sound good?

1137
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:51,553
All right, yeah.

1138
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:56,625
Good.

1139
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:05,100
- Yes. That's it. That's the song.
- Um...

1140
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:17,045
(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)

1141
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,992
- (CLEARING THROAT)
- Fresh pitcher.

1142
01:05:30,994 --> 01:05:32,327
Here we go.

1143
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:39,000
- Here you go, buddy.
- Thanks, Dad.

1144
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:42,938
- What do you say, Aimee?
- Thank you.

1145
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:46,074
- It's pretty good, huh?
- Thank you. What's that?

1146
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:48,043
The song. You like the song?

1147
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,011
This?

1148
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,648
Yeah, it's all right.

1149
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:56,017
This was always
your mother's kinda thing.

1150
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:58,653
Mom? What?

1151
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:03,224
This is fun. I can't imagine mom
listening to fun music like this.

1152
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:05,994
What the hell you talkin' about?
When I married your mother,

1153
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:08,296
your mother was more fun than anyone I knew.
Your mother was

1154
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,998
the definition of fun.

1155
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,067
There was nobody more
fun than that.

1156
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:15,170
You know what, don't say anything
bad about your mother either, huh?

1157
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,110
So, uh, what happened?

1158
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,981
What do you mean what happened?

1159
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:30,719
Between you and Mom.
What happened?

1160
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:33,388
Things didn't work out.
That's what happened.

1161
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:39,361
Yeah. Well, you know
she blames you for everything.

1162
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:42,163
- I defend you. I always defend you.
- Well, I appreciate that

1163
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,300
'cause, you know what?
It wasn't all my fault.

1164
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:48,069
- Yeah, exactly. There's two sides
to every story. -That's right.

1165
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:49,371
Yeah.

1166
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:51,306
And no matter what happened
between you guys,

1167
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:55,276
I mean she shouldn't have kicked
you out of the house like that.

1168
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:59,647
Your mother didn't kick
me out of the house.

1169
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,486
What do you mean?

1170
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:08,289
I mean your mother didn't kick
me out of the house. I left.

1171
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,558
What?

1172
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,095
Let me tell you somethin'.

1173
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:19,267
I had to leave. I wanted to be
there for you. I really did.

1174
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:22,070
More than anything in the world, I wanted.
You guys meant more to me than anything.

1175
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:25,440
But the fact of the matter is that
things between your mother and I,

1176
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:27,475
they were very uncool.

1177
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:32,213
I guess you could say I wasn't
cut out to be a family man,

1178
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:36,584
not in the traditional sense. I did
some things that I'm not proud of.

1179
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:39,120
But I'll tell you something. I don't
live in the past, I live in the now

1180
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:42,190
because that's what it's all about.
Do you understand that?

1181
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,461
Yeah. Yeah.

1182
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,705
- Hey. Uh...
- Yeah?

1183
01:07:57,707 --> 01:08:01,107
Do me a favor, will you? Pick up this tab
real quick, all right? I'll be right back.

1184
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,414
Dad.

1185
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,149
Calm down. The boy found me.

1186
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:11,086
Well, I didn't know that you had a son.
Thanks for that info.

1187
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:13,488
What? I didn't give him
the damned address!

1188
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:21,463
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1189
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:24,766
Well, I gotta pay the tab
and he doesn't have any money.

1190
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,840
- Do you have some money?
- Yeah.

1191
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:33,641
This isn't enough.

1192
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:40,748
- That's all you got?
- Listen, um...

1193
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:44,519
Roberta's had too much to drink so
I'm gonna give her a ride home,

1194
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:46,454
if you know what I mean.
All right?

1195
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:49,190
- Do you want us to follow you? -No, no, no.
There's no need for that.

1196
01:08:49,192 --> 01:08:51,559
I won't be more than an hour.

1197
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,661
Yeah, dad, we're not doing anything.
We can totally come...

1198
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:55,797
- Yeah...
- No, that's not necessary.

1199
01:08:55,799 --> 01:09:00,335
You know what'd be best? Why don't you
guys just meet me back at my place, good?

1200
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:04,339
- Yeah, Dad, we came all this way to see you.
- I know you did.

1201
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:07,542
And I'm glad you did, but I'll meet you
back at my place in about an hour.

1202
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:09,277
Is that good?

1203
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,480
- Uh, yeah. We can do that. Yeah.
- Yeah, that's fine.

1204
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:17,418
- All right. I'll see you then.
- Yep.

1205
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:40,875
- We should head back. -Let's keep waiting.
It's only been... Sutter!

1206
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:23,718
- I'm sure that he wanted to come back.
- Aimee...

1207
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,222
No, if it wasn't for her, I'm sure
he would have come right back.

1208
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:29,624
Yeah. And if he didn't cheat on my
mom then we'd still be a family

1209
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:32,760
and I'd be president of
my Sunday school class.

1210
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,497
Sutter.

1211
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:38,800
What?

1212
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,472
I love you.

1213
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,976
It's just...

1214
01:10:47,978 --> 01:10:49,944
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah.

1215
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:53,448
- Sutter, I love you.
- No, you don't.

1216
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:56,317
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't, you're wrong.

1217
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,020
Sutter, I'm not wrong.

1218
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:00,922
- You don't love me.
- Yes, I do!

1219
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:02,790
You're wrong.
You don't love me,

1220
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:04,592
okay, you're just drunk and
you're grateful that somebody

1221
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:07,328
- came along and showed interest in you.
- Okay, stop.

1222
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,464
Stop. Do not try
and mess this up!

1223
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:11,332
Mess what up? What do you
think that this is, Aimee?

1224
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:12,400
What are you talk... Sutter!

1225
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:13,468
(YELLING)

1226
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:23,778
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

1227
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,447
- What?
- Are you all right?

1228
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:27,915
- No... -Are you hurt? Is
there anything that...

1229
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:31,352
Aimee, stop. No, I'm not.
I'm far from okay.

1230
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:33,321
- Jesus!
- Are you hurt?

1231
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:35,490
Aimee, what is the matter with you?
I almost just killed you

1232
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:36,891
and you wanna know if I'm okay?

1233
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:38,026
Yeah, I wanna make sure
that you're okay.

1234
01:11:38,028 --> 01:11:40,361
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1235
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:43,998
Do you not see that I am bad for you?
You need to get away from me!

1236
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,467
- What are you talking about? -You
need to get the fuck away from me!

1237
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,970
Aimee, just...
Get out of my car.

1238
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:50,805
No, I'm not gonna
get out of your car!

1239
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:54,309
Get out of my car! Get the
fuck out of my car! Get out!

1240
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:57,512
- Get the fuck out of my car!
- Oh, my God, Sutter!

1241
01:11:58,614 --> 01:11:59,714
Jesus Christ!

1242
01:11:59,716 --> 01:12:01,749
I'm sorry, Sutter. (SCREAMING)

1243
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:04,319
What are you...
Holy fuck! Aimee!

1244
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:28,609
DOCTOR: I'll give you a choice, kid.
The cops or your parents.

1245
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:30,705
(MUFFLED VOICES)

1246
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:36,711
Sutter!

1247
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:39,447
Now.

1248
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:45,920
It's not an F.

1249
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:51,092
- I thought you were getting help.
- I am.

1250
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,162
I am.

1251
01:13:54,164 --> 01:13:58,099
All right. Well, you need a C on
the final or you fail my class.

1252
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:01,002
I'll try harder.

1253
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:03,871
No, you won't.

1254
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:08,843
I don't get you, Sutter. I mean
you're a smart kid. Thoughtful.

1255
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:13,514
- I mean, do you even want to graduate?
- I don't know.

1256
01:14:13,516 --> 01:14:17,185
- Excuse me? -I'm just being honest with you.
I... I don't know.

1257
01:14:17,187 --> 01:14:19,720
Everyone's telling me I gotta move
on, I don't see what's so great

1258
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:21,656
about being an adult.

1259
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,126
Are you happy?

1260
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,049
Hi.

1261
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,889
Hey. How you feelin'?

1262
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:56,591
I'm good. How are you?

1263
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,728
It's good to see you.

1264
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,166
Should we talk about it?

1265
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,504
I agree.

1266
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,573
I'm so sorry, Aimee.

1267
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:14,675
- Sutter, stop.
- Okay.

1268
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:17,612
It's okay. I know. It's okay.

1269
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,122
We can just pretend that it,
like, never happened.

1270
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:31,526
We don't ever have to talk
about it again, okay?

1271
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:33,995
I don't want anything
to get in the way of Philly.

1272
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:41,068
(SIGHING)

1273
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:44,205
You're all that matters to me.

1274
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:08,095
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

1275
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:10,831
- Hey!
- Hey.

1276
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,513
- Hold this.
- Mmm-hmm.

1277
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,660
- You want some?
- No, I'm good.

1278
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:41,182
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm good.

1279
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,164
Okay.

1280
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,067
Is your family here?

1281
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:47,969
Naw, I told them
it was next week.

1282
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:52,640
- Yep. Yeah.
- Really. Okay.

1283
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,780
- Oh, hey, I should probably
go say hi to her. -Okay.

1284
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,286
(CHUCKLING) Well, we made it.

1285
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:40,721
Yeah, I guess we did.

1286
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,671
- I'm really glad.
- Yeah.

1287
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:49,783
I'm really proud of you, Sutter.
Congratulations.

1288
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:52,439
Uh, so, when are you
going to Texas?

1289
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,904
I thought that you heard.
I'm not going to Texas.

1290
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,808
I'm going with Marcus.

1291
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,710
California?

1292
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:07,281
- That's right.
- (CHUCKLING) What? Cass...

1293
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:10,918
- Sutter? -Come on, man.
Are you serious?

1294
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,454
I mean, I don't know, don't you
think that's like a little...

1295
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:16,090
- What? -I don't know,
it seems a little...

1296
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,093
You're really going?

1297
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,162
Yes, I'm really going.

1298
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,768
Well, maybe I'll, you know...

1299
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,171
I could come visit you guys or something.
Never been to California.

1300
01:18:30,173 --> 01:18:32,173
It'd be cool.

1301
01:18:32,175 --> 01:18:34,215
I don't think that's
a very good idea, Sutter.

1302
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:35,944
Yeah.

1303
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:40,748
Yeah, I mean, yeah,
it's not, probably not cool.

1304
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:42,193
Sorry, it's just I'm, I'm...

1305
01:18:42,219 --> 01:18:43,017
Hey. I get it.

1306
01:18:43,019 --> 01:18:45,820
- I'm trying to do things...
- It's fine. It's cool.

1307
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:48,289
...right now that
aren't bad for me.

1308
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:50,858
I get it.

1309
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,128
Good.

1310
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:55,496
It's cool. It's cool.

1311
01:18:58,233 --> 01:18:59,333
Sutter.

1312
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:03,270
(SIGHING)

1313
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:09,176
I'm not mad at you.

1314
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:10,311
I know.

1315
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,985
You'll always be
my favorite ex-boyfriend.

1316
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:37,004
- DAN: Sutter!
- Yeah?

1317
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:38,239
Pop upstairs, would ya?

1318
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,546
You've probably noticed, uh,

1319
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:47,448
we haven't been
too busy these days,

1320
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:51,185
and, uh, because of that,
I can only keep one clerk.

1321
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:55,055
Now, I like you, Sutter,

1322
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:56,791
but, more importantly,

1323
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:58,559
the customers like you.

1324
01:19:58,561 --> 01:20:01,896
(CLEARING THROAT) So I think
you should be the one I keep.

1325
01:20:01,898 --> 01:20:05,332
- That's excellent.
- Oh, no, one second. I...

1326
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:06,567
I've given this
some hard thought,

1327
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:10,004
and, uh, the only way
I can let you stay,

1328
01:20:10,006 --> 01:20:12,840
is if you promise me, 100%,

1329
01:20:12,842 --> 01:20:16,477
that you will never
come in here loaded again.

1330
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:20,247
And I'm serious.
Not even a light buzz.

1331
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,283
Because if you do,

1332
01:20:22,285 --> 01:20:24,218
then I have to let you go.

1333
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,352
You understand?

1334
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:28,088
I do.

1335
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,991
So, can you promise?

1336
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:35,830
You've got me there, Dan.

1337
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:41,035
You know
I can't promise you that.

1338
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,409
Well, I appreciate
your honesty.

1339
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:50,311
(CLEARING THROAT)

1340
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:52,213
I've always been
up front with you.

1341
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:00,588
Thanks for the opportunity.

1342
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:02,189
- (CLEARING THROAT) Yeah.
- Thank you.

1343
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:04,592
I suppose if
I was your father, I...

1344
01:21:04,594 --> 01:21:07,194
This is where I might give you
a lecture or something.

1345
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:10,965
You know, about what
you're doing to yourself.

1346
01:21:10,967 --> 01:21:14,007
Well, you know, Dan, if you were
my dad, you wouldn't have to.

1347
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:38,158
MAN OVER INTERCOM: <i>...now boarding for
Washington DC, Baltimore and Philadelphia.</i>

1348
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:22,603
WOMAN: Miss.
I need to keep going.

1349
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:25,005
Just two more minutes, please.
I promise.

1350
01:22:25,007 --> 01:22:27,374
WOMAN: I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to go.

1351
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:28,642
Okay. Thanks.

1352
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:58,739
So, yeah, do you think
I did the right thing?

1353
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:01,642
For you or for her?

1354
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:04,745
You had to let her go.

1355
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:06,981
You had to save that girl.

1356
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:09,823
That's what I'm saying. I saved her.
I saved her.

1357
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:12,753
You're not wrong.

1358
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:17,224
You're a hero. You're a king!

1359
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:19,593
I'm a king!

1360
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:23,464
I'm a king!

1361
01:23:23,466 --> 01:23:28,602
Look at you, Sutter.
What are you 22, 23?

1362
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:31,739
- Yeah.
- Beautiful!

1363
01:23:31,741 --> 01:23:34,742
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

1364
01:23:34,744 --> 01:23:37,511
- Hey, so do you, man.
- You think so?

1365
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:39,680
Absolutely.

1366
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:42,649
Look at you,
hey, you're a young man.

1367
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:45,719
- You're, you're a kid.
- I'm a kid?

1368
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:48,555
You got... You got plenty
of life left in you.

1369
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:50,524
Hey,

1370
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:55,195
how 'bout we get
a round of shots for us kids?

1371
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,434
(CRASHING)

1372
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:39,673
Ah, shit! Ah, shit!

1373
01:24:41,276 --> 01:24:43,343
Ah, shit! Shit!

1374
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:48,215
What the hell? Sutter?

1375
01:24:48,217 --> 01:24:51,852
Jesus Christ! We just went through this.
What the hell is wrong with you?

1376
01:24:51,854 --> 01:24:54,088
- What do you care?
- Excuse me?

1377
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:57,324
- You don't care about me. You've
never cared about me! -Sutter?

1378
01:24:57,326 --> 01:25:00,394
Is it 'cause I remind you of him?
Is that why you hate me, Mom?

1379
01:25:00,396 --> 01:25:02,563
That's why you can't even
stand to look at me? Can you?

1380
01:25:02,565 --> 01:25:04,631
What are you talking about?
You're my son!

1381
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:07,505
You know what I'm talking about.
I'm his son too.

1382
01:25:07,531 --> 01:25:08,769
I'm exactly like him.

1383
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,838
You are nothing like him.

1384
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,708
Sutter?

1385
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:17,511
I'll give you your dad's number
and you can go to him and see.

1386
01:25:17,513 --> 01:25:20,647
- See how different you are. -I thought
that you didn't want me to see him.

1387
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:24,418
I was... I was trying
to protect you from...

1388
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:28,522
- I was wrong, okay, so, I want you
to go now and... -I already went.

1389
01:25:32,427 --> 01:25:37,231
Holly gave me his number, I drove
up there last week and I saw him.

1390
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:40,400
- You were right, Mom.
- Sutter...

1391
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:43,904
- You were right the whole time.
- You are not your father.

1392
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:49,576
Sutter, listen to me.

1393
01:25:49,578 --> 01:25:53,680
Listen to me. That man... That
man has never loved anyone

1394
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:56,283
but himself.
His heart is this big.

1395
01:25:57,418 --> 01:26:00,420
But you, you love everybody.

1396
01:26:00,422 --> 01:26:04,158
You have the biggest heart
of anyone I know.

1397
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,180
When you were in 3rd grade
and Ricky was on crutches,

1398
01:26:07,206 --> 01:26:09,696
do you remember that?
You carried his books.

1399
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:12,666
Carried that back pack
every day.

1400
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:16,203
Or when you were nine and
Rosemary Clark lost her mother,

1401
01:26:16,205 --> 01:26:18,639
you invited her
to come live with us.

1402
01:26:18,641 --> 01:26:21,575
You told her that
I would be her new mom.

1403
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:27,381
You've always been
so special, Sutter.

1404
01:26:27,383 --> 01:26:29,950
That's why everyone
loves you so much.

1405
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:32,686
Nobody loves me.

1406
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:40,394
Sutter, you are so wrong. Do you hear me?
You are so wrong.

1407
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,466

<i>Compared to other kids, I haven't
had that many hardships.</i>

1410
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:35,482
<i>Not really.</i>
<i>You know. Shit's happened.</i>

01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,889

1416
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:54,501

1417
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:57,738
<i>Of letting people down.</i>

1418
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:01,341
<i>Hurting people.</i>

1419

<i>Getting hurt.</i>

1420
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:08,482

01:28:08,484 --> 01:28:14,354
<i>If I couldn't even feel, well,
then no harm would come to me.</i>

1422
01:28:14,356 --> 01:28:17,024
<i>I screwed up. Not only
did I shut out the pain,</i>

1423
01:28:17,026 --> 01:28:20,394
<i>I shut out everything.</i>

1424

1430
01:28:56,632 --> 01:28:59,666
