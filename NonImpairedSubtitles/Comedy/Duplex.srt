<i>and are ready to dive into</i>
<i>the real estate market.</i>

00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,726
<i>Let's do a little</i>

00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,194
<i>The American dream home.</i>

<i>Two bedrooms, two bathrooms,</i>

<i>one doghouse, one garage,</i>
<i>two garbage cans.</i>

8
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,058
<i>lt's cozy, safe,</i>

9
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,265
<i>and just barely within</i>
<i>your overstretched budget.</i>

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,671
<i>Not for you?</i>

11
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:45,074
<i>For the same price,</i>
<i>you can buy 200, 000 acres</i>

When l told you

35
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,480
l had a particular building
in mind for you ,

Oh , the kitchen's
a little small .

42
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:16,628
Well , rip out this
awful room divider,

43
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:19,136
and you've got
an eat-in kitchen .

you have your library.

Wow.

Oh , my God .

So, this staircase.
This leads to where?

53
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:57,475
l thought you realized .
This is a duplex.

54
00:02:57,543 --> 00:03:00,341
As in two floors
for the price of one?

55
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:03,575
l believe it's right there
in the listing sheet.

56
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:05,116
So, why was it sealed off?

57
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:08,584
Were there, like, a slew of
murders up there or something?

58
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:12,112
No, there's just a sweet, little
old lady that lives upstairs.

A tenant?

Mm-hmm .

61
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,658
So, rent control means
we can't kick her out, right?

Alex!

63
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,591
That's a legitimate question .
You cannot evict her.

64
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,101
She has to decide to leave
or, God forbid . . .

Poor thing hasn't been
feeling well lately.

You have a Mommy-and-Me

You got shopping that way.

lt is ideal .

Here's my card
if you want to make an offer.

92
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:45,540
There's a lot of heat
on this place.

93
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:48,415
l'd say it'll be
off the market by Monday.

Adios.

Guys, the place sounds
incredible.

97
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,757
And surprisingly affordable.

98
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:03,892
lt's kind of affordable.

99
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:06,529
lt's really at the high end
of our price range.

that it's a duplex.

lt's gonna be worth
a bazillion times that.

Really? A bazillion?
That's an incredible return .

Come on , Alex, what better way
to finish your novel

141
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,989
than in your own 1 9th-century
oak writer's nook?

00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,035
lt would be nice
not to write at Starbucks

144

651
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:26,952
But it might seem cozy
'cause of the fireplaces.

652
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,691
There are 3 fireplaces.

What if we tried
being nice to her?

806
00:42:40,823 --> 00:42:43,485
Maybe we could get her a gift.

-A gift?
-Yeah .

she wouldn't mind leaving .

a little begging , but nicely.
