Lewis Thayer's
"untitled #2."

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,094
It's worth $4 million.

15
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:40,929
You'd think
for that kind of money

16
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:43,199
he'd have bothered
to come up with a title.

17
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,265
It is one
of his seminal pieces.

18
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,933
Is it a fad or talent
that drives up the price?

19

Both.
Neither.

00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,383
Well, as you can see,

29
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:07,952
the "untitled #2"
was simply cut out of its frame.

30
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,287
How does someone pull
a down-and-dirty slash and grab

31
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:12,123
from a major gallery?

32
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:14,125
It's one of the few options left
if you want to knock over

I was talking to her.

35
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:17,594
Mr. Caffrey's right.

36
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:19,396
We have sensors in the frame,

37
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:21,231
but nothing attached
to the canvas.

38
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,099
Cutting it out of the frame
circumvents the alarms.

39
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,233
Got it.

40
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,534
Security cameras?

41
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:26,735
The theft occurred

42
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:28,537
during our daily
security-tape swap.

43
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:30,839
So we're not dealing
with complete amateurs.

44
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:33,674
No. Actually, it sounds
like a pretty good plan.

What are the odds you'll be able
to recover the painting?

46
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:37,878
Well, it would have made
my job a lot easier

47
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:39,179
if you had kept it
from the press.

48
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:41,581

Do we think our thieves
called it in?

51
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:52,857
Good chance. Headlines attract
black-market buyers.

52

00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:37,071
Was this painting ever hanging
below that skylight?

163
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,274
Yes. In late April.
We had a pop-art show.

164
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:42,042
We wanted to display the Thayer
prominently.

165
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,912
Then we should check
the registration log for April.

Probably looking
for a student...

with technique.

168
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:52,417
Someone like Justin Magary
from East Side University.

169
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:55,585
He stopped by
on the 21st of April at 1:45.

170
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:56,920
That would be afternoon light.

171
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:05,495
What's that on your face?

172
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:07,196
I haven't seen you this happy
in a while.

You know, it's a beautiful day.

174
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:11,332
You're excited
someone's copycatting you.

175
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,135
Imitation, flattery...
you know what they say.

176
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:16,337
Mm-hmm.
You ever been on a campus?

177
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:17,671
Not as a student.

178
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,974
And yet you have three MBAs
and two doctorates.

179
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,876
Clearly something wrong
with the system.

180
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:23,510
Too bad you faked it.

181
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:26,613
They could have made copies of
you and filled up a frat house.

182

Oh, are we bitter we weren't
invited to the party?

183
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,051
Oh, it's just with
my father's construction salary,

184
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,919
I had to stick
to the grindstone.

185
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,288
Four years of advanced math
on scholarship,

186
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,990
then two years of accounting.

187

I still can't imagine you
hunched over a desk

with a little visor,
doing my taxes.

189

You're lucky the FBI

<i>I was not a mathlete.</i>

and go to New York?

Sorry, but we're here
to interrogate someone else.

195

See what you missed out on?

196

Yes?

202

We need to talk to you.
Why?

203
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:54,081
What do you know about
Lewis Thayer's "untitled #2"?

204
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:56,683
Uh...Nothing.

205
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:58,747
I-I mean,
I know it, of course.

206
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:01,111
You ever painted one?
It's a good question.

207
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:02,679
I probably shouldn't say
anything.

208

We've got you on a camera

209

sketching it
at the Lamson gallery in April.

210
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:09,050
That's legal, right?

211
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:12,420
Not when three of your copies
are fenced as the real thing.

212
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:14,589
That turns them
into forgeries...

213
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:15,790
Which is illegal.

214
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:17,359
I can vouch for that.

It's looking pretty bad
for you, kid.

If you talk to me,
I can help you.

A while ago, I answered an ad
on the school's list server

00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,334
for reproductions.

219
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,536
I get an e-mail back
commissioning seven copies

220
00:09:29,604 --> 00:09:31,005
of "untitled #2."
Seven?

221
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:33,441
Did you wonder why somebody
would want seven copies?

222
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:35,976
You know how hard it is to make
money as an art student doing art?

223
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,044
Who hired you?
I didn't meet them.

224
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,980
They dropped the materials off
in my mailbox.

225
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:41,282
And once I'd finished,

226
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:42,550
they said to leave the paintings
in the rec center

227
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:44,152
and that the money would be left
in my box again.

228
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,453
I thought it was weird
that they didn't want to meet,

229

so I... so you stayed and
watched the pick-up?

230
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,956
Yeah. I wanted to make sure
it was legit.

231
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,325
And she seemed normal,
so I let it go.

232
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,260
All right, if you sat down
with a sketch artist,

233
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:56,761
do you think you could remember
what she looked like?

234
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,129
May I?
Yeah.

235
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,170

318
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,151
People have been known
to fall for a pretty face.

<i>If Veronica had help,</i>

320
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:47,925
I don't want to scare them away
by my talking to her just yet.

321
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,092
<i>Well, I can talk to her.</i>

322
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,326
Now you're reading my mind.

323
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:52,762
Anklet?
I'll pull it for this one.

324
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,630
You ready to go back to school?

325
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:56,532
I think I can handle that.
Good.

326
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:58,333
'Cause I'm
a technological virtuoso.

327
00:13:58,401 --> 00:13:59,601
Okay.

328
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:01,569
With a classical artistic
foundation.

329
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,538
Okay, okay.
Read it to yourself.

330
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:05,206
Quiet now.

331
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:06,373
Did you guys see this syllabus?

332
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:08,108
Oh, we don't need to share.

333
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:10,077
I'm in it.
Yep. Go, team!

334
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:15,649
The Koechert diamond pearl

335
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:18,250
was stolen by Gerald Blanchard
in 1998.

336
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:19,918
It took them a full two weeks

337
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:21,987
to realize
that the jewel was missing

338
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:23,622
because Blanchard replaced it

339
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:27,224
with a pretty darn good
costume replica.

340
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,092
He circumvented the alarms...

341
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,193
[ Beeping ]
...At the Viennese castle

342
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:34,495
by parachuting onto the roof,
if you can believe it or not.

343
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:36,997
Some people have called this
the perfect crime.

344
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:38,464
I wouldn't say he was perfect.

345
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,833
And Blanchard
overshot his landing.

346
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:43,134
He, uh, slipped on the tiles

347
00:14:43,202 --> 00:14:44,569
but saved himself
by grabbing a railing

348
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:45,870
on the castle's roof.

349
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:47,671
So I'd say
he loses marks for style.

350
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:48,873
Oswald:
Excuse me...

351
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,376
I believe we have a celebrity
in our midst.

352

This is
Mr. Neal Caffrey.

To what do we owe
the honor, sir?

354
00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:01,549
I understand
you study the best criminals.

355
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:03,084
I share that interest.

You... you seem like
a very capable teacher.

[ Applause ] Come on.

We would love to have
some of your expertise.

Pleasure to have you.
Pleasure to be here.

Please...

369
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:32,874
All right, well,
we'll stick to the hypotheticals

370
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:35,275
and anything covered
by the statute of limitations.

371

[ Light laughter ] Who's first?

Oh, wow.
All right.

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,784
How about you?

374
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,550
In theory, the carrier pigeons only carried

375

The vault combination... they
didn't carry the manuscripts.

376
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:54,580
Next question?

377
00:15:57,281 --> 00:15:59,951
When executing a heist,
Mr. Caffrey,

378
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:02,220
do you prefer boxers or briefs?
[ light laughter ]

379
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:05,431
I think some things are
better left to the imagination.

380
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:10,760
Eric: There's not much written
about your arrest.

381
00:16:10,828 --> 00:16:11,966
How'd you get caught?

382
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:15,231
Momentary lapse
in concentration.

383
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:17,199
So the FBI
had nothing to with it?

384
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,067
Oh, they'd like
to take credit for it,

385
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:20,902
but essentially,
I turned myself in.

386
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:24,672
Recently, you were suspected
in the la Joyau diamond heist...

387
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,874
suspected and then cleared.

388
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,241
I served my four years,

389
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:29,676
and I decided
I didn't want to go back.

390
00:16:29,744 --> 00:16:31,945
Been living like all you
ever since then.

391
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:34,280
Or trying to.

392
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:38,417
Okay. Let's thank
Mr. Neal Caffrey.

393
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:40,685
Thank you.
[ applause ]

Remember, everybody,

00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:46,057
read chapters 12 through 15
of Lovell for next week.

396
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:52,463
Thank you so much,
Mr. Caffrey. Fascinating.

397
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:53,698
It's the least I could do.

398
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:55,333
You know, I thought

399
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,501
I should participate in
my own copyright infringement.

400

Excuse me?

401
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:01,705
It's a little green

00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:03,974
to rip off someone's con
unless you improve it.

403
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:05,742
You and your kids
could use a little tutoring.

404
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,879
I'm sorry. I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

405
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:10,080
The Thayer theft.

Hey, don't get me wrong, man.
I'm flattered.

407

But, uh...
I'd like to be cut in.

408
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:18,555
You know,
I did lay the groundwork.

409
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:20,257
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you,

410
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:22,059
but I'm a Professor
who teaches crime.

411

I don't go out there
and commit them.

Okay.

413
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:29,065
Mr. Caffrey...

414
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:34,003
Um, I get together with a group
of students after class.

415
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:35,538
Yeah, you got
some bright kids in here.

416
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:36,906
Yeah, there's a few of them.

417
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:40,042
We go to a bar called the globe,
around the corner.

Be thrilled
if you would join us.

The globe?
Yeah.

420
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,580
I'll think about that.

<i>Seems those who can

432

We cross-checked
all of the crimes

433
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,840
on Professor Oswald's syllabi

434
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:14,975
since he started teaching
10 years ago.

435
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:17,244
We suspect he counterfeited
a bank note last year,

436
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:19,846
forged an Emerson letter,
and smuggled Egyptian artifacts.

437

He copied Tokley-Perry?

Well, felony by proxy...
you got to give him credit.

439
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,351
We also think
that he might have stolen

Matisse's
"view of saint-Tropez."

Unfortunately,
this is all speculation.

443
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,758
Oswald is taking advantage
of his students,

and Justin

unless we can prove
it wasn't him.

Well, we have one card left.

447
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:44,333
We know about the Thayer.
Oswald's hiding it somewhere.

448
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:46,068
He's not gonna give it up soon.

449
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:48,837
Interpol found the fences
who sold the forgeries abroad.

450

They know they're being watched.
They're out of play.

451

You have something in mind?
Maybe.

Always make your lifts
with two fingers.

477
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:55,493
That way your thumb doesn't
bump up against the mark.

<i>Tell me something
I don't know.</i>

you're the smartest guy
in the room.

481

Unless you're the smartest guy
in the room.

482
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,572
Oh, uh, you want to keep
your place in that deck?

483
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,674
Keep the tip of your little
finger in the brief.

484
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:09,709
I think I know what I'm doing.

Want to put some money on that?

Sure.
Hey.

Who's the mark?

488
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:15,579
That's my $5

how about her?

490
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:34,058

Nice to meet you.

Alex, pick a card.

This looks like fun.
[ chuckles ]

So, put it back on top
and cut it for me, would you?

495
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:53,037
Okay.

496
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:03,514
Okay, now, the card I stop at
is gonna be yours.

497

He doesn't think it will be.

No. [ chuckles ]
I can't take your money.

<i>And, no, it's not.</i>

505
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:47,848
Well, that was supposed to be
your card.

[ Smacks lips ]
Now, I guess he was right.

507
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,587
Sorry.

<i>I believe
this is her card, Eric.</i>

She and Caffrey played you.

She's his, uh, "inside man,"
if you will.

511
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:04,860
Nice catch.

512

Look, we weren't gonna take
your money.

513
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:08,830
Yeah, right.
Check your pocket.

[ Oswald laughs ]

00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:17,505
I guess the lesson here
is never con a con man.

516
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:20,173
I think we all know what the lesson
is for today, don't we, Eric?

517
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:23,242
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I'm not

Congratulations.
You humbled him.

That's not easy to do.

Hi.

What do you do besides card tricks?
Oh...

Well, nice to meet you.

If you want to join us
for a drink,

Nice to meet you.
Be right there.

Thank you for backing me up
in there.

532

Mozzie tells me to come to
the bar because you have a plan

533

and now I'm out 200 bucks
and you're dropping my name.

Do you trust me?

No.

00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,079
Okay, I assume we're doing more

537
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:13,715
than baiting frat boys
with bar tricks.

What's with
the dead poets society in there?

You know, it's my current case

to your problem.

[ Sighs ]
Russell wants to meet on Sunday

542

to fence the rest
of the Krugerrands,

543
00:23:24,557 --> 00:23:25,790
but it's a setup.

544
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:27,024
He's gonna sell me out

545
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:28,859
to whoever put the price
on my head,

546
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:32,396
and your plan
is to bring the feds into it?

547
00:23:32,463 --> 00:23:34,098
I tell the FBI
that Oswald and his kids

548
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,567
are gonna steal
the Krugerrands.

549
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:37,270
They'll pull Russell in
and talk to him.

550
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:38,805
It will kill his reputation.

551
00:23:38,873 --> 00:23:40,374
No one will be buying
information off him

552
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:41,909
if they think he's in bed
with the bureau.

You're crazy.
It'll work.

Neal:
The kids do the legwork.

558
00:24:08,652 --> 00:24:09,885
Oswald fences the goods

and kicks them back
a share of the profit.

560
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:13,153
If the kids get caught...

561
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:14,521
Oswald can sell them out.

562
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:16,156
Yeah, he'll say
he was teaching a class,

563
00:24:16,224 --> 00:24:17,592
and they took it too far.

reveal the painting? I don't know.

about the next best heist.

Which way are they leaning?

Everything from diamond heists
to stealing boats.

we can choose for them.

How so?

00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,074

We intercept Russell

send Jones down the street
with the coins,

and I get the kids to steal them
from him instead.
