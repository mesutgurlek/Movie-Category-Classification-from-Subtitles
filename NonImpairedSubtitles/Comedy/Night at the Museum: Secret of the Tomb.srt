who are financing the plan...

about the tablet?

Kind of an interest of mine.

talk to these guys.

frame us again?

to the slammer?

you out of jail, so...

We've moved on.

I don't think
this guy's moved on.

tablet stuff behind us, Larry.

465
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,281
It's old news.

466
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,245
Besides, we really never knew
anything about that old tablet.

467

468

Something's up with it.

I can't help you.

Maybe this kid can.

471

is a pretty amazing thing...

I tried to move on...

475
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,251
but there was something
about that tablet.

476
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,007
It's turning green,
like some sort of corrosion.

477
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,407
And something's happening
to Teddy and Dexter...

478
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,647
Jed and Octavius.

479
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,404
They're all acting weird.

480
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,961
It's like the green rust
is affecting them.

481
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,809
"The end will come."

482
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,041
What?

483
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,485
The locals, they warned us.

484
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,291
They begged us to
leave that tomb alone.

485
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,523
I thought it meant
the end of the world.

But maybe it meant
the end...

488

the tablet off to New York...

491
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,569

to England.

are in England?

Some of the artifacts
stayed in Egypt.

496

The rest was divided up between
New York and the British Museum.

497
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,326
Ahk said that his father knew
the secrets of the tablet.

to go talk to him.

and stops with me.

No, I think
we got it from here.

1134
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,408
Really?
Yeah. No, we're good.

1135
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,686
Right. Well...

clown-faced keeper
of the magic tablet...

1139
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,204
I shall never
forget your bravery.

1140
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,328
Nor your jests.

1141
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,851
Bye.

1142
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,609
I shall not say goodbye.

1143

I am.
What?

1144
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,167
I'm gonna say goodbye.
I have to go, I'm sorry.

1145
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,441
I'll see you.

1146
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,130
Really, man, thank you.

1147
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,520
For everything.

1148

Welcome home, my son.

1155
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,328
I want you
to meet my friends.

1156
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,444
I am Merenkahre...

Pharaoh of the Nile and
Father to the Son of the Sun.

And I am Shepseheret...

Guardian of Brooklyn.

1162
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,487
Yes.

1163
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,290
I actually live
in Manhattan now.

1164
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,249
I know, but it doesn't
sound as cool.

1165
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,527
Yeah.

1166
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,451
We would be very honored if you
could take a look at the tablet.

1167
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,721
There's something
happening with it.

1168
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,086
We don't understand
what it is.

1169
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,720
You are speaking
with a pharaoh.

1170
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,484
Kiss my staff.

1171
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,286
Is it okay if I don't?

1172
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,851
You will show respect.

1173
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,567
I am the descendant
of Ra, the sun god.

1174
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,802
I understand that
and I totally respect you.

1175
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,247
I just don't pray
to Ra, so--

1176
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,006
The Egyptian gods
are the only true gods.

1177

Well, we try to stay
a little more open-minded.

1178
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,801
I mean, Sacajawea, she honors
her spiritual ancestors...

1179
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,486
and you pray to some sort
of goat god, Attila?

1180
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,324
I'm half-Irish,
half-Jewish--

1181
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,289
You are? I love Jews!

1182
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,364
We owned 40,000 of them!

1183
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,727
Such lovely people.
Here we go.

1184
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,441
They were very happy, always
singing with the candles.

1185
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,806
Yeah. They really
weren't happy.

1186
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,850
Really?
No. They left.

1187
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,684
They spent about 40 years in
the desert trying to escape.

1189
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,609
Yeah. We have dinner once
a year and talk about it.

1190
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,410
It's a big deal for us.

1191
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,721
Listen, could you take
a look at that tablet?

1192
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,763
There's something
wrong with it.

1193
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,806
It's losing its power.

1194
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,362
Do you think
you could fix it?

1195
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,644
To do that, I would have to
divulge the secret of the tablet.

1196
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,608
I promise
we won't tell anybody.

1197
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,721
No.

1198
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,726
I'll kiss your staff.

1199
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,801
Too late.

1200
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,808
Father, why do you insist
on keeping this to yourself?

1201
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,328
The secret was to be passed
down to you at the proper time.

1202
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,364
Well, it has been
4,000 years.

1203
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,329
Now seems like a good time.

1204
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,529

you were instantly
more precious to me...

00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,407
than all the wonders
of the ancient world.

1210
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,726
I knew I could never bear
to say goodbye.

Wait, listen to me.
That thing is dying.

get moonlight...

At long last!

1449
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,327
Guinevere, my love.
Hi.

1450
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,847
Can I help you, mate?

1451
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,161
Itisl...

1452
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,721
Sir Lancelot.

1453
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,564
I have fulfilled my quest.

1454
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,210
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1455
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,407
I'm not
actually Guinevere.

1456
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,847
I'm Alice Eve, and I think
you got a bit confused.

1457
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,843
Maybe you saw me on stage--
Your voice is like music...

1458
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,764
but I have no idea
what you're saying.

1459
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,331
Okay. Hey.

1460
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,891
Hey, man.
(SNAPS FINGERS)

1461
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,246
Hey, buddy. Um...

1462
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:30,685
What she's saying is she's not
Guinevere because she's an actor.

1463
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,604
Okay? So am I.

1464
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,921
An actor?

1465
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,081
Yeah.
Yeah.

1466
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,446
You know?

1467
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,601
Do the crown.

1468
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,728
Oh, sorry, of course.

1473
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,285
Uh...
That's a ridiculous name!

1474
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,601
It doesn't even sound real!

1475
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,127
Only a coward would conceal
his true identity, Arthur.

1476
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,611
No, it's Hugh Jackman.

1477
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,841
I, on the other hand...

you sought...

1479
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,046
but could never find.

Okay, I love the costume...

I love the enthusiasm...

1483
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,444
but you're gonna have to
get off stage now.

1484

Sir Lancelot, ladies and gentlemen.
Sir Lancelot.

1485

Yes!

1486
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,207
Very good.

1487
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,089
Shame on you, Arthur!

1488
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,050
You don't deserve
your crown,

1489
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,770
and you don't
deserve your queen!

Hey, buddy,
this is all pretend.

See, just--

1495
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,411
Well, that's not real.

1496

None of it is.

It's not real.

It was a good performance.

We were right in there.
You were tonight.

But it's not real-real.

It's not real.

to do great things.

it be not to look at my nose?

bury you with many riches.

01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:18,203
And I know young Nick
will do great things.

1773
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,085
Yeah, he's, uh...

1774
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,125
ready to take on the world
all by himself.

1775
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,203
Then you've done your job.

1776
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,963
You've done your job.

1777
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,488
It's time for
your next adventure.

1778
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,283
I have no idea what
I'm gonna do tomorrow.

1779
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,882
How exciting.

1780
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,925
Bye, Teddy.

1781
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,249
Farewell, Lawrence.

1782
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,480
Bully!
(SCREAMS)

1783
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,409
(LAUGHING)
Got you!

1784
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,763
Smile, my boy.

1785
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,089
It's sunrise.

1786
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,328
Hey.
Hey. You good?

1787
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,847
Yeah, I am.
Good.

1788
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,761
So, Ibiza?

1789
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,841
Yeah. Uh...

1790
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,210
The whole DJ thing, Dad...

1791
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,442
I don't know if that's
the thing for me...

1792
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,648
I just know that
it's the next thing.

1793
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,564
After that,
maybe college.

1794
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:55,281
I'm figuring it
all out, you know?

1795
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,961
Sounds like a plan.

1796
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,484
I should get back to Mom's,
or something.

1797
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,971
Okay-

1798
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,521
I love you.

1799
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,810
I love you, too.

1800
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,481
All right.

1801
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,491
I'm not gonna let you go.

1802
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,802
(CHUCKLES) Okay.
I'll see you later.

1803
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,520
<i>DR. MCPHEE: Three years,
no Larry Daley.</i>

1804
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,207
<i>He was the one that took the
fall for me, got me my job back.</i>

1805
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,124
I heard he went
back to school,

1806
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,202
got his degree,
became a teacher.

1807
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,441
I'm very glad.

1808
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,444
Well, when he heard about
this traveling exhibition...

1809
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,723
Larry insisted that I deliver
this to you personally.

1810
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:22,965
Ah! The infamous, supposedly
magic, glowing tablet.

1811
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,407
Larry Daley and
his fanciful tales.

1812
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,324
Larry said
you could be trusted.

1813
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,405
What do you mean?

1814
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,565
(WHISPERING) With the top
secret knowledge.

1815
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,721
What are you doing?

1816
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,924
I'm winking.
You're blinking.

1817
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,043
No, I wink with both eyes.

1818
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,201
That's blinking.

1819
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,328
It doesn't matter,
because right now...

1820
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,925
you better get ready!

1821
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,286
For what?

1822
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,401
For this.

1823
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,161
It does glow.

1824
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,601
Uh-huh.

1825
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,841
(CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

1826
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,604
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1827
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,327
Come on.

1828
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:14,321
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

1829
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:59,401
Sorry.

1830
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:01,085
Go ahead.

1831
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,685
Have fun-fun, Dum Dum.

1832
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,765
(CHATTERING)

1833
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,205
Ah!

1834
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,041
Stay!

1835
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,690
I'm not going anywhere.

1836
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,286
Stay!

1837
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:48,885
I'm not going anywhere!

1838
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,885
