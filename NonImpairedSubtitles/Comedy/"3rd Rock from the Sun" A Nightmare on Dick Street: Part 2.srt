1
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:21,987
Tommy:
<i>information officer's log.</i>

2
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,322
<i>Last time on</i>
3rd rock from the sun,

3
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:27,592
<i>Dick was upset when Mary
decided to go to Borneo for a year.</i>

4
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:29,928
What's so great
about Borneo?

5
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,432
<i>He later had a horrible nightmare about
telling Mary the truth that he's an alien.</i>

6
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,366
<i>And, having never
dreamt before,</i>

7
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:38,770
<i>- Dick thought he was</i>
losing his mind. <i>-</i> Mary!

8
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:41,939
<i>To calm him down, a doctor
prescribed tranquilizers.</i>

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,643
<i>Dick quickly became addicted
and lost touch with reality.</i>

10
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,579
<i>Not knowing
what to do,</i>

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,847
<i>we tried to contact the big
, giant head for permission</i>

12
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:52,083
<i>to return to the home planet
for maintenance.</i>

13
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:54,385
<i>Sally also dreamt
for the first time</i>

14
00:00:54,386 --> 00:00:57,689
<i>and became convinced
that she had killed Don.</i>

15
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:32,923
- Don? Don? Where's Don?
- Sally.

16
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:35,460
Oh, Don!
I didn't kill you?

17
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:37,628
I didn't kill you!

18
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:40,398
No, you just
emasculated me.

19
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,833
- I've got to see something.
- Sally!

20
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:46,304
No feathers.

21
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,275
Oh-- oh, my god.

22
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,243
Sally, uh, you're gonna
have to calm down.

23
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:56,247
Oh, don't you see, Don? You're
alive, which means it's my brain,

24
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:59,284
my sick, twisted brain.

25
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,120
I could be capable of
anything. Anything at all!

26
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:05,156
There's only one hope, Don.
I've got to get on the pill.

27
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:09,093
Um, this isn't how
I expected this to happen,

28
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:11,596
but hey.

29
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:14,933
Dick's on the pill, and it
seems to be working for him.

30
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,335
Okay, you lost me
again.

31
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:21,105
Uh, I'll call you when
I'm not myself anymore.

32
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,779
Okay, so she's crazy,

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,148
but she's got legs
up to her face!

34
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:38,256
- I love Tv.
- Mmm, me too.

35
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:40,558
What do you say
we turn it on?

36
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:45,997
It's even better on.

37
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,901
Oh, man.

38
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:52,437
The high commander and the
lieutenant are incapacitated.

39
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,439
You know what that means?

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,275
The information officer
takes over, and that's me.

41
00:02:57,276 --> 00:03:00,144
Permission to speak,
high commander.

42
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,847
- Permission granted.
- Well, we might as well

43
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:06,083
just take this mission,
roll it up and stick it--

44
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,786
incoming message

45
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:11,422
from the big,
giant head.

46
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:15,259
"Your request to return home for
emergency maintenance has been authorized."

47
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,729
- Yes!
- "The time-space portal will open tomorrow evening

48
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,731
between 8:51

49
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:23,267
and 8:53 P.M.
Earth time.

50
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:26,705
On your journey home,
we will be showing <i>tin cup,</i>

51
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,475
starring Kevin Costner
and Rene Russo."

52
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,176
Well, that settles it.
We're going.

53
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:35,180
"The big, giant head looks forward
to reading your comprehensive report

54
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,481
on the history
of human civilization."

55
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:39,217
Oh, no.

56
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:47,325
- Tommy.
- Miss frost.

57
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:51,295
- You missed class today.
- I-- yeah, I did.

58
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:54,666
That's so unlike you. You're usually
the first to come and the last to leave.

59
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,567
Yeah.

60
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,039
Miss frost,
I'm gonna be transferring

61
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,574
to another, uh,
district soon,

62
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:06,044
but, um, before I do,
I was just wondering

63
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,113
if you wanted
to take me up on my offer.

64
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,816
You mean, your offer to let me be
the one to usher you into manhood?

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,155
- The offer still stands.
- Thank you, no.

66
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,927
I'm wearin' her down.

67
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,164
Tommy, how's
the report coming?

68
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,433
I'm just putting the
finishing touches on it now.

69
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,735
Man, am I gonna be glad to
get this thing off my shoes.

70
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:08,439
Sally's voice, echoing:
<i>Tommy!</i>

71
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:12,643
- Dicks's voice: <i>help!
-</i> Sally's voice: help me, Tommy!

72
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:15,747
How can I help you?
I'm supposed to be studying.

73
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:20,418
Sally:
<i>Tommy, help us!</i>

74
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:07,264
Sally's voice:
<i>over here and help us!</i>

75
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:09,801

- Harry's voice: help us!

00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,606
Dick, Sally together:
<i>jump, Tommy! Jump!</i>

77

Dick's voice:

Dick:

- Harry: <i>Tommy!</i>

104
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,047
Oh, Dick, Sally!

105
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,916
It's happening to me too!
I'm falling apart at the seams!

106
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,786
Oh, this chair feels all soft on my bottom.

107
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:45,022
Will you listen to me?
This is serious!

108
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:47,625
You know what's good for
serious things? One of those.

109
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,660
Oh, no, no, no, Tommy.
Don't do it.

110
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:52,296
Look, Tommy.
Look how pretty they are.

111
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:55,900
And they have a line down the
middle where you can break them in half.

112
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:59,470
- So you can take half?
- No, so you can take one and a half.

113
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:02,840
No, Tommy,
you got to be strong.

114
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:06,476
You're right. As acting high
commander, I order you to turn over the pills.

115
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:08,579
Oh, he thinks
he's high commander.

116
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,682
That's so cute.
Let's give him a salute.

117
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:13,918
Harry,
get rid of 'em!

118
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,920
No, not that way!

119
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:24,461
Tommy, Harry,

120
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:26,831
I want to thank you for
getting us off that pill.

121
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,034
- Oh, you feel better?
- Oh, I feel horrible.

122
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:32,302
But at least I feel.

123
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:34,304
Well, we just have to keep it
together for a few more hours.

124
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:37,241
- What do you mean?
- While we were "out,"

125
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,410
Tommy got a hold
of the big, giant head.

126
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:42,713
- We leave tonight at 8:53.
- Last chance for ice cream.

127
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:45,416
- When are we coming back?
- I don't know, I didn't ask.

128
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,785
Who knows? The service
department's always backed up.

129
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:50,054
Yep. They'll probably
have to send out for parts.

130
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:52,389
Could be a week, could be
a year, could be 200 years.

131
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,492
- What about Mary?
- Oh, she'll be dead.

132
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,096
I can't leave her
without saying good-bye.

133
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,398
- Wait! Dick, there isn't time.
- Sure, there is.

134
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,599
No, listen, I know you,
Dick. You're gonna go there,

135
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,169
you're gonna get all ooey-gooey
, and you'll miss the transport.

136
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,705
That is such
a lie!

137
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:09,874
Well, remember one thing:
Harry is the transmitter,

138
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,876
and he's coming
with us, okay?

139
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,945
So without him, you'd
be stranded here forever.

140
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,347
Don't worry. I'm gonna steel myself up,

141
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,416
march in there, and just do the headlines--

142
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,785
"love ya, miss ya,
good-Bye."

143
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,087
And maybe a little second-
base action, but that's it.

144
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:32,530
Hello, Mary.
I came by to say

145
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,532
I will miss you
terribly.

146
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,601
Really? Is there anything else I should know?

147
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,536
Yes. I care about you deeply and I love you.

148
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:42,907
Of course.
Do you mind if I pack?

149
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:47,111
- What?
- Nothing.

150
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:49,046
I bit my fist.

151
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,417
In conclusion, I'll always
carry a locket of your Dna,

152
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:55,953
and you'll be glad to know
that the vision of your naked body

153
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:57,588
will be with me
for all time.

154
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,159
Well, I guess there's
nothing else to say but good bye.

155
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,994
- Good bye, Dick.
- Good bye, Mary.

156
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:06,030
I'm walking away now.

157
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,401
No.

158
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:14,672
No, this is not
how it ends.

159
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:18,308
This has been a long and difficult
journey, and it will not end this way.

160
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:21,546
There will be no tepid farewells for us.

161
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,581
I need you, Mary--

162
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,950
your eyes, your face,

163
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,587
your every nook and cranny--
especially your cranny.

164
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:35,459
You are Mary world,
and I love Mary world.

165
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,229
It's the happiest
place on earth.

166
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,066
Oh, come on, Mary! Let's
take a spin on those teacups!

167
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:49,707
- I don't want to go!
- I don't want to go either!

168
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,943
- Where are you going?
- Uh, nowhere.

169
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,945
Maybe I am
losing my mind,

170
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,214
but while there's a little
left, I want to marry you.

171
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,250
- Marry me?
- Sure, I'll marry you. We'll be so happy.

172
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:02,386
This is so great!

173
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:04,554
I know!

174
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:13,431
- He's late.
- We're gonna have to leave him behind.

175
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,966
Nobody gets left behind.
Not on my watch.

176
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:20,203
- Then what do you suggest?
- Well, 20 feet of rope and a blunt object.

177
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:22,739
There's rope in the basement. Let's
go get it. Harry, you keep packing,

178
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,808
and don't fall asleep
on the job.

179
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,180
"I'm miss bossy.

180
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:33,117
I get to tell everybody

181
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:35,286

232
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,318
Thanks, Mrs. Dubcek. I
wouldn't ask you to let me in

233
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:56,186
if I didn't think
Sally really needed help.

234
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:59,055
You know, I used to date
a police officer.

235
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:01,658
Maybe you know him--
teddy rubino.

236
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:06,096
He's the guy whose wife put a
slug in him for fooling around.

237
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,138
Dear god!
Stand back.

238
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:21,345
- I'm afraid he's dead.

239
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:24,681
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure. I'm a cop.

240
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:26,717
- Hi, Don.

241
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,523
Damn it, I got to learn
how to take a pulse.

242
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,393
- Don.
- Sally, where have you been? I've been looking for you.

243
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,395
Hold that thought.
Listen, Harry, get a hammer.

244
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,030
- Tommy, get the sack. I'll get the string cheese.
- "String cheese"?

245
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:42,099
Oh, god, I'm starving!

246
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,471
I'd like to propose
a toast.

247
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:51,275
To Dick and Mary. May you
both be as happy as I am.

248
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:54,845
Uh...

249
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,714
Dick, could I speak to you
for a minute?

250
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,916
Sally, uh, sure.

251
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:02,319
Excuse me. Uh, don't get married without me.

252
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:07,824
Oh, I'm glad you came.
I was-- I was gonna call.

253
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:10,261
Oh, cut the crap, Dick. Listen,
you're a mess. You're coming with us.

254
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,262
- We're going home.
- This is my home.

255
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:14,598
- What?
- Mary and I are getting married.

256
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,500
What you talkin' about,
Willis?

257
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,372
I've made my decision.

258
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,307
I'd rather die here with Mary
than risk losing her forever.

259
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,410
Oh, okay, all right.
You're the high commander,

260
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:28,612
and we respect
your decision.

261
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:31,047
- Get him!

262
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:34,484
- What the hell?
- Oh, uh, hello, Mary.

263
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:38,088
Don't worry. The "besacking" of the
groom is a time-honored tradition.

264
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:40,623
What kind of tradition?

265
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,859
I'm gonna go
with "Jewish."

266
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:47,131
Okay. Dick, we have to go. We have guests.

267
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,700
- All right.
- Dick, are you sure,

268
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,336
absolutely sure you want
to go back to the party?

269
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,637
Absolutely.

270
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:57,507
Well, this is
good bye, then.

271
00:17:57,508 --> 00:18:01,278
It's just cake and champagne.
He'll be home in half an hour.

272
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,146
Oh, yeah. True.

273
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:07,150
- So I'll see you in a half an hour.
- Sounds good.

274
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:09,386
Pick up some milk
on the way home, hmm?

275
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:11,855
I will.
I promise.

276
00:18:11,856 --> 00:18:15,359
- I'll be at the mall if you need me.
- Don't stay long.

277
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,162
It's a school night,
and I worry.

278
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,297
Come to the store,
Dick.

279
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,035
Our coupons are
in your car.

280
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:28,772
They've always been
in your car!

281
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:32,742
For crying out loud,
he's just getting married.

282
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:34,711
Oh, yeah.

283
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,950
Well, we got to go.
The store closes at 8:53.

284
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:49,025
Good bye!

285
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:51,895
Will they be
living with us?

286
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,100
I never dreamed I'd see the
day Dr. Albright settled down.

287
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,169
Mary hasn't
settled down.

288
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:03,039
She's just settled.

289
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,442
I know this sounds
strange,

290
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:08,812
but I had a dream you asked me to marry you.

291
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:11,147
- You had a what?
- A dream.

292
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,151
I was drowning
in a swimming pool,

293
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:17,888
and my father was
the lifeguard,

294
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,457
and he was saving me,
and I looked up

295
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,425
and it wasn't him,
it was you.

296
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:24,528
And you were wearing
flippers

297
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:27,031
and black socks,

298
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,332
and you offered me
a ring.

299
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,502
Mary, it's contagious!
You're as crazy as I am!

300
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:36,506
I know it's crazy. It woke
me up out of a sound sleep.

301
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:39,843
Yes! That's when it
strikes-- When you're asleep!

302
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:42,613
Well, yeah, Dick. That's
when most people dream.

303
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,816
"Most people dream"?

304
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,485
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

305
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:50,754
Nothing's the matter
with me.

306
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:53,923
And there's nothing the matter
with Tommy and Sally.

307
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:58,061
Oh, my god! There's nothing
the matter with any of us!

308
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:01,731
- Where are you going?
- Home! Before it's too late!

309
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:07,504
Hello? Sally?

310
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:10,173
Harry? Tommy?

311
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:14,711
"Dear Dick, of all the
people we've worked for,

312
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:18,581
you were the best,
you stupid, stupid man."

313
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,023
And they're gone.

314
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,158
I miss them.

315
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,428
"P.S.: We got you a
wedding gift. Hope you like it."

316
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:34,865
A toaster.

317
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,335
The toaster
from the kitchen.

318
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:41,471
- <i>Dick?</i>
- <i>In here.</i>

319
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:44,141
You left the party so
suddenly. Is everything all right?

320
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,576
Oh, Mary.

321
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:49,045
I chose to stay with you
until death do us part,

322
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:51,981
which, as it turns out, is a
hell of a lot longer than I thought.

323
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:54,584
- What?
- Which is fine. It's just fine.

324
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:57,121
- Where is your family?
- They took off.

325
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,356
And it's all
my fault.

326
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:02,292
But I'm gonna find them.
No matter how long it takes,

327
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,895
no matter what I have to do,
I'm going to find them

328
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,331
and get them back--
this I vow!

329
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:10,100
Where'd they go?

330
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:12,035
Pizza.
