1
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:35,066
- Did you make a wish?
- Yeah.

2
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:02,764
No lunch. I got speech class.

3
00:03:02,853 --> 00:03:06,802
What do you need speech class for?
You talk fine.

4
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:09,899
I'll pick you up at five,
we'll ride back together.

5
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:13,567
I can't. I got Emerging Markets
seminar at 5.30.

6
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:18,317
Jeez, it's your birthday. Can't they
emerge without you just this once?

7
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,983
- What time is my surprise party?
- What?

8
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,573
Come on.

9
00:03:22,664 --> 00:03:25,582
I'm supposed to have you home at seven.

10
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,668
I'll cut out early and be home at 7.15, OK?

11
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:31,505
- All right.
- Thank you very much.

12
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:58,152
- Morning, Tess.
- Morning.

13
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:01,902
- Hi, Tess.
- Hi.

14
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:13,043
Mr Turkel's line.

15
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:16,500
Who's calling, please?

16
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:19,880
Hold on a moment.

17
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:22,047
Mr Lutz?

18
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:27,675
Hold on a second, all right?

19
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,146
Mr Turkel?

20
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:43,361
Mr Alagash... Hi.

21
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:48,115
- Mr Alagash is real anxious to talk to you.
- You couldn't maybe get him to hold?

22
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,913
You got him in Dentitech -
the one I said go short on.

23
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:53,873
It's fine, but he don't wanna
hear it from a secretary.

24
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:57,048
- There's no paper.
- What?

25
00:04:57,134 --> 00:05:01,879
There is no goddamned paper
in this stall. Get me some?

26
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:12,561
Thanks. You're very kind.

27
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,238
You're short on Dentitech at 18.
He'll be right here.

28
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:45,676
See Dentitech closing? 17. Come Monday,
I bet it's 16 and still sittin' there.

29
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:49,846
- How you figure?
- They went public at 23 with one product.

30
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:52,262
Plaque-removing mouthwash?

31
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:55,559
You rinse, you get this glob of plaque
you gotta spit out.

32
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,320
Maybe it'll be big, but no one ever got rich

33
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:02,567
overestimating what
the American public wants to taste.

34
00:06:02,657 --> 00:06:04,531
Maybe.

35
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,287
Before I run, Tess, I have
some good news and some bad news.

36
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:16,663
The straight shot is they turned you down
for the entrée programme again.

37
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:19,080
- Why?
- We did all we could, Tessy.

38
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:22,210
You're up against
Harvard and Wharton graduates.

39
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:26,003
You've got some night school,
some secretarial time on your sheet.

40
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:29,301
- Christians and lions, Tess.
- That's right.

41
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:32,559
- And the good news?
- Dave has a friend.

42
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:37,888
Bob in Arbitrage. You're so hungry,
they're looking for hungry down there.

43
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:41,270
- Really?
- Hungry's the name of the game down there.

44
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:44,946
Bob's looking for an assistant
and wants to meet you for a drink.

45
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,820
This isn't another setup?

46
00:06:49,412 --> 00:06:52,117
Do I look like a pimp?

47
00:06:56,336 --> 00:07:01,378
Bob says he's looking for hungry,
I think to myself "Tess". The rest is up to you.

48
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:04,467
- Bob in Arbitrage.
- Bob Speck.

49
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:07,507
Extension 256. Expecting your call.

50
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:09,756
Go get 'em, Tessy.

51
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:16,729
You should have told us.
Congratulations, Tessy.

52
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:27,147
Thanks.

53
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:39,411
Mick?

54
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:58,180
Surprise.

55
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,736
Happy birthday.

56
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:15,952
You look great.

57
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:28,256
Come here.

58
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:34,424
You know, Mick, just once I could go for,
like, a sweater or some earrings.

59
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:39,512
You know? A present that I can
actually wear outside of this apartment.

60
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,117
So...

61
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:56,742
Is this where you usually meet for drinks?

62
00:08:56,832 --> 00:09:00,781
This is a big week.
A super week. We are celebrating.

63
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:05,005
So, Arbitrage. Talk about adrenaline, huh?

64
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,957
What do you think is the most
important quality for a great arbitrager?

65
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:13,002
- Well, we'll go through all that at the hotel.
- The hotel?

66
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:18,685
The company has a suite at the Ritz Carlton.
They give it to us boys on a bonus basis.

67
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,178
We're gonna party.

68
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:23,942
I'm sorry. Allow me. I'm so sorry.

69
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:28,189
- Hey, Bob. Please.
- Sorry, I just... I get a little carried away.

70
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:34,572
Arbitrage has put out this "Introduction to..."
tape for the business schools.

71
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:39,489
- Let's put it in. If you have any questions...
- That would be great. Thanks.

72
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:52,840
It's the wrong tape. Unless of course you...

73
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:56,761
Bob, you're not seriously looking
for a new assistant, are you?

74
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,433
Not at this moment. But I'm always
on the lookout for new blood.

75
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,762
I am hungry, but I am not that hungry.

76
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:04,979
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- I would.

77
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:09,645
- Would you pull over here, please?
- What are you doing?

78
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:14,778
Party, Bob.

79
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:44,555
Hello, Tess.

80
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:49,689
You're late, Tess.

81
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:11,624
Yo, David.

82
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:19,969
Little bitch.

83
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:22,549
You gotta see this to believe it.

84
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,181
Take it easy.

85
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:27,145
Bastard.

86
00:11:28,316 --> 00:11:32,100
- Tess...
- I know.

87
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:36,323
You don't get ahead in this world
by calling your boss a pimp.

88
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:38,780
Well, he is.

89
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:44,373
Been lookin' at your file here. This is the third
time in six months I've had to place you.

90
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:48,206
- It wasn't my fault.
- Where have I heard that before?

91
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:50,371
Ruth, I'm 30 years old.

92
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:54,295
It took me five years of night school,
but I got my degree with honours.

93
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:56,460
I know I could do ajob.

94
00:11:56,553 --> 00:12:01,298
Ask any of my bosses, even Lutz,
if Tess McGill hasn't called a few.

95
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:05,685
You ask 'em. I don't think
they're gonna sing your praises, Tess.

96
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:14,902
Here's something for you.
Transferring down from Boston.

97
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:20,493
Mergers and Acquisitions.
Name of Parker. Starts Monday.

98
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:22,902
- You go home and cool off.
- OK.

99
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:25,321
Tess...

100
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:30,706
This is the last time I can help you.
Four strikes, you're out.

101
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:42,597
- Tess McGill for Katharine Parker's office.
- It's the last desk. At the end of the aisle.

102
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:41,775
Hi. I'm Katharine Parker. You must be Tess.

103
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:43,693
Hi.

104
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:46,819
Great bunny.

105
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:52,664
I don't usually have a bunny on my desk.
It was my birthday a few days ago.

106
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:56,335
- No kidding. Mine's next Tuesday. How old?
- 30.

107
00:13:56,423 --> 00:14:00,634
Really? Well, I'll be 30 next Tuesday.
We're practically twins.

108
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,673
- Except I'm older.
- Just barely.

109
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:10,304
I've never worked for somebody who was
younger than me before. Or for a woman.

110
00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:15,022
Well, there's a first time for evertyhing.
It's not going to be a problem, is it?

111
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:17,315
- No.
- Good.

112
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:23,072
Why don't you pour us a couple of coffees
and come on inside? I'm light, no sugar.

113
00:14:28,163 --> 00:14:30,868
The stock is at 38, the tender's at 56.

114
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,701
Come in.

115
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, what do we do about that?

116
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:39,503
Well, I just checked my three.
What are yours?

117
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,041
Yeah, I have that one.

118
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:45,806
I think he's in an underwater position.

119
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:50,136
All right. That's our first and second call,
and then we'll see where we are.

120
00:14:50,227 --> 00:14:53,346
I'll count the minutes. Bye.

121
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:55,312
Thanks.

122
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:59,146
So, Tess, a few ground rules.

123
00:14:59,236 --> 00:15:02,439
The way I look at it,
you are my link with the outside world.

124
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:04,986
People's impression of me starts with you.

125
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:08,658
You're tough when it's warranted,
accommodating when you can be.

126
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:12,494
You're accurate, punctual.
You never make a promise you can't keep.

127
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:15,500
I'm never on another line, I'm in a meeting.

128
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:19,037
I consider us a team,
and as such we have a uniform.

129
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,419
Simple, elegant, impeccable.

130
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:26,253
"Dress shabbily, they notice the dress.
Dress impeccably, they notice the woman."

131
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:28,422
Coco Chanel.

132
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:32,970
How do I look?

133
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:37,474
You look terrific.
You might wanna rethink the jewellery.

134
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:44,526
I want your input, Tess. I welcome your ideas
and I like to see hard work rewarded.

135
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:48,944
It's a two-way street on my team.
Am I making myself clear?

136
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,408
Yes, Katharine.

137
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:56,709
- And call me Katharine.
- OK.

138
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:00,456
So, let's get to work, shall we?

139
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:06,751
This department's profile last year was pitiful.
Our team's got its work cut out for it.

140
00:16:07,512 --> 00:16:09,588
OK. Thanks.

141
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:15,851
Damn. I forgot my pills again.
It's the third time this month.

142
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:18,475
Did you hear about that shot
they got in Europe?

143
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:22,894
They're giving it to women, in their arm.
It's good for five years.

144
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:25,192
Damn pills. I'm always forgetting 'em.

145
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:31,279
- I thought you might like this.
- Thank you.

146
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,998
Tess, would you come in here
and bring a notebook?

147
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:39,872
They've sold the paper and printing divisions.

148
00:16:39,961 --> 00:16:44,041
They sell Distribution too,
we're talking real scorched earth.

149
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:46,339
Come on in.

150
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:49,676
Tess, this is Ginny. Ginny, Tess.

151
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:54,761
I thought I'd throw a cocktail thing
to introduce myself to the department.

152
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:59,145
Ginny here has some great ideas.
Will you jot them down?

153
00:16:59,231 --> 00:17:03,228
The caterer is called Acme Eats.
You can get the number from Information.

154
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:05,607
They do the usual hors d'oeuvres.

155
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:09,195
The Raging Bull has a bartender service.

156
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:12,568
And the liquor store
on Broadway and Liberty delivers.

157
00:17:12,661 --> 00:17:15,911
- Got that, Bess?
- Tess, yeah.

158
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:20,458
- If that's the way that you wanna go.
- You have another idea?

159
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:25,206
Well, I was just reading in Wabout dim sum -
these little Chinese dumplings.

160
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:28,881
A restaurant on Mott Street
does them for cocktail parties.

161
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:32,966
- I love those little dumplings.
- It might be more fun than the usual tidbits.

162
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:37,054
- I have it on my desk. I could get it.
- You read W?

163
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:42,304
I read a lot of things. You never know
where the big ideas could come from.

164
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,977
I guess you're right. If dumplings
can be considered a big idea.

165
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,483
- Well, that oughta get you started...
- Ginny, thank you so much.

166
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:54,113
- Back to the gold mines.
- Right.

167
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:56,325
- You'll set those up?
- Right away.

168
00:17:56,413 --> 00:17:59,746
Dim sum, Tess. I like it, contribution-wise.

169
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,075
Keep it up.

170
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:08,540
The chief says "We will give
you an honourable death."

171
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:10,709
"But first, keke."

172
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:14,473
Excuse me. Excuse me.

173
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:18,131
- Dim sum?
- Yes, yes.

174
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,858
Come on, Katharine. What do you say?

175
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,605
Jim, the man who spends
every weekend in August glued to his desk,

176
00:18:31,698 --> 00:18:35,114
that man knows that I can't
just sneak out of my own party.

177
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:40,821
I'll tell you what, though. You get me
in on the Southeast Air divestiture plan,

178
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:45,163
I'll buy you a drink.
Bottle of Cristal, two straws.

179
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:49,499
- Deal?
- Okey-dokey.

180
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:52,667
- Dim sum?
- Hi.

181
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,676
Thank you. What a slob.

182
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:58,385
You were so smooth with him.
I would have...

183
00:18:58,475 --> 00:19:03,386
Never burn bridges. Today's junior prick,
tomorrow's senior partner.

184
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,525
- So, how do you think the party's going?
- Pretty well, I think.

185
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:10,527
Should I stop serving now?

186
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:13,103
- Better make one more round.
- Right.

187
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:17,196
I'd help, but we can't busy the quarterback
with passing out the Gatorade.

188
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:19,658
Arnie, my hero. You've come.

189
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:34,920
Yeah?

190
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:40,552
I have an idea
and you said I could come to you.

191
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:42,718
Shoot.

192
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:50,439
Well, you know how Trask Industries has
been looking to buy into broadcasting?

193
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:53,148
- The department is...
- Working on it, yeah.

194
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:58,066
I've been following it myself,
and all of a sudden I thought "radio."

195
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,489
- Trask is looking for television stations.
- So is every Tom, Dick and Harry.

196
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:06,199
My idea is that they get their feet wet in radio
and build from there.

197
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:08,997
It's not as glamorous
as jumping right into TV,

198
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,037
but it's a solid place to start
and there's a lot more of them for sale.

199
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:17,510
Plus it would solve Trask's problem with
the Japanese trying to take him over,

200
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:21,463
because FCC forbids foreign ownership
of radio as well as TV.

201
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:30,816
Interesting. You've been
following this, you say?

202
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:32,609
Yeah.

203
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:36,906
No chance you overheard it,
say on the elevator?

204
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:40,741
- No, no way.
- Somewhere.

205
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:42,986
It's my idea.

206
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,653
Good, good.

207
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:53,253
- Discuss it with anyone else?
- Nope. You think there's something there?

208
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,634
Well, I can think it through for you.
Leave me your notes. I'll have a look-see.

209
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,759
OK.

210
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:03,974
I've been trying to get into the entrée
programme and this would be a big push.

211
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:07,759
- If anything happens, you'll...
- Absolutely, Tess.

212
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:10,606
Two-way street, remember?

213
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,766
Yeah, thank you.

214
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:38,297
It's just... It's so exciting.
I mean, she takes me seriously.

215
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:43,545
I know you hate when I say this,
but I think it's because she's a woman.

216
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,724
There's none of that
chasing-around-the-desk crap.

217
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,057
And it's like she wants to be my mentor,
which is exactly what I needed.

218
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:53,769
I feel like I'm finally gettin' somewhere.

219
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:58,686
That's great, but let's step on it
or the pizza's gonna freeze, honey.

220
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,822
Maybe we could all go out sometime.
Dinner in the city.

221
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,448
You would like her, I think.

222
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:09,992
God. Remember when all you had to do
was a few buckles?

223
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,752
Yeah. Those were the days.

224
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:18,079
I called the inn. All they can give you
is a ground-floor single in the new wing.

225
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:21,797
Did you tell them it was me?

226
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:24,128
Well, I said Parker.

227
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:07,925
It's this tower room with a canopy bed
and a fireplace big enough to stand in.

228
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:11,765
Perfect. Evertyhing's in place.

229
00:23:12,562 --> 00:23:17,023
- For what?
- The man I've been seeing for a while.

230
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:21,936
I think he's it. And I think
this could be the weekend we decide.

231
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,277
He said there was something very important
he wanted to discuss with me.

232
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:28,444
I think he's gonna pop the question.

233
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,410
- You do?
- I think so.

234
00:23:30,497 --> 00:23:34,874
We're in the same city now.
I've indicated that I'm receptive to an offer.

235
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,744
I've cleared the month of June.
And I am, after all, me.

236
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:43,165
What if he doesn't pop the question?

237
00:23:45,303 --> 00:23:48,091
I really don't think that's a variable.

238
00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:54,184
Tess, you don't get anywhere in this world
by waiting for what you want to come to you.

239
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:57,022
You make it happen.

240
00:23:57,107 --> 00:24:00,392
Watch me, Tess. Learn from me.

241
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:07,448
By the way, I ran your Trask radio idea
by some of our people.

242
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:11,409
It seems Trask is dead set on television.

243
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:15,031
But it wasn't out in left field either.
I really liked the idea.

244
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:20,332
You just keep plugging and bring me
your ideas, and we'll see what we can do.

245
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:23,627
- Thank you, Katharine.
- Tess...

246
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:29,007
Look at me. Who makes it happen?

247
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:33,723
I do.

248
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,645
Who does?

249
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,055
I do. I make it happen.

250
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:43,016
That's right. Only then
do we get what we deserve.

251
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:10,468
Miss Parker's office.

252
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:12,595
Hi, Katharine.

253
00:25:12,682 --> 00:25:15,600
- You what?
- Broke it skiing.

254
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:20,893
They won't be able to move me for
two weeks, so this is what I need you to do.

255
00:25:20,982 --> 00:25:23,271
Water plants. OK.

256
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,858
Cable comes on Friday.

257
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:29,319
Easy with the leg, will you?

258
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:31,614
Quit staring up my gown.

259
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:36,447
Now, I'm staying at my parents' house
and the housekeeper is in Barbados.

260
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,288
What a mess. You need to let in
the flower man and the cleaning lady.

261
00:25:40,377 --> 00:25:44,505
Sort through the mail.
The entrance code for the front door is...

262
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:49,339
It's 754-3-2000.

263
00:25:50,095 --> 00:25:52,253
I know there's more, but I can't think of what.

264
00:25:52,347 --> 00:25:57,305
Go through the calendar on my desk.
There's a bunch of invitations to be RSVP'd.

265
00:25:57,394 --> 00:26:02,471
I know I'm asking an awful lot, Tess,
but I don't know what else to do.

266
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:06,398
- I need you to take over.
- OK. Bye.

267
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:28,647
Regarding those horrid little
knick-knacks from the Alberts...

268
00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:32,603
Dear Eleanor and Gary.
Thank you for the salt and pepper shakers.

269
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:38,736
Not only are they the perfect house-warming
gift, but it was so dear of you to think of me.

270
00:27:39,996 --> 00:27:44,991
Dear Sister. It's hard to believe it's been eight
years since we said goodbye to Wellesley,

271
00:27:45,085 --> 00:27:47,920
but of course we never really say goodbye.

272
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:52,251
On behalf of the Alumni Giving Fund,
I am writing to you to ask...

273
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:02,935
Dear Sister. It's hard to believe it's been eight
years since we said goodbye to Wellesley,

274
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:05,689
but of course we never really say goodbye.

275

I am writing to you to ask...

276
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:16,732
To ask... To a... To ask... To... ask...

277
00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:20,786
I am writing to you to ask...

278
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:24,114
Dear Momo and Baa.

279
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:26,615
Here I am living in Mummy's house

280
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,838
while I brave the New York real-estate market
looking for a place of my own.

281
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:36,261
I miss you all terribly, but it will be so lovely
to see you when you return from Barbados.

282
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:40,294
Till then, have fun. Much love to you
and, of course, to Claudette.

283
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,466
Love, Kiki.

"Two-way street."

00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,808
And "You make it happen."

292
00:30:15,694 --> 00:30:18,860
- What? No class?
- No class.

293
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:22,980
Tess, this is not what it looks like.

294
00:30:23,076 --> 00:30:26,160
I mean, it is what it looks like,
but I can explain.

295
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:30,113
- Well, not exactly explain.
- You snake.

296
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:33,617
Shit.

297
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:44,137
Come on, Tess. I'm sorry, I really am.

298
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:47,725
I love you. Come on.

299
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:50,596
Come back and hit me.

300
00:30:50,687 --> 00:30:52,229
Please.

Hello. Mr Trainer's office, please?

302
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,908
Hello. Tess McGill calling from Petty Marsh.
May I put her through?

303
00:31:45,992 --> 00:31:48,068
Thank you.

304
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:53,163
Mr Trainer?

305
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:59,086
Hi, this is Tess McGill. I work with Katharine
Parker over here in Mergers and Acquisitions.

306
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:02,956
I have a proposal that
I'd like to discuss with you.

307
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:05,589
Not over the phone, though.

308
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:09,924
I have an opening
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.

309
00:32:10,934 --> 00:32:12,808
OK.

310
00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:16,726
I'll messenger an outline
over to you right now.

311
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:18,772
Bye.

312
00:32:38,211 --> 00:32:42,339
Yes, I'm calling for Katharine Parker
in regard to your invitation.

313
00:32:42,424 --> 00:32:46,837
Miss Parker is out of town, but Miss Tess
McGill will be attending in her place.

314
00:32:46,928 --> 00:32:48,387
Yes. Thank you.

315
00:33:01,318 --> 00:33:03,856
Why does it do that?

316
00:33:03,945 --> 00:33:07,445
- For cleaning.
- Are you kiddin' me?

317
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:09,608
No.

318
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,321
What is this thing you're going to anyway?

319
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:20,663
The closing party for the Minidyne-Dalton
merger. Dewey Stone is throwing it.

320
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:24,004
That's where Trainer works.
It's the perfect time to meet him.

321
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,874
Mix business with pleasure.
Fringe times are crucial.

322
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:30,460
What'd you do, snatch her invite?

323
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:32,631
Well, she can't use it.

324
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:37,137
It's important for me to start interacting
with people, not as a secretary...

325
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:39,898
But as a total impostor. Right.

326
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:45,517
This is it.

327
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,446
It needs some bows or somethin'.

328
00:33:50,534 --> 00:33:54,827
No. It's simple, elegant,
yet makes a statement.

329
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:59,622
Says to people: confident, a risk-taker,
not afraid to be noticed.

330
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:04,371
Then you hit 'em with your smarts.
Here. Shoes. I need shoes.

331
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:09,877
$6,000? It's not even leather.

332
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,256
$6,000?

333
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:19,640
$6,000.

334
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:24,391
- Cyn, I can't breathe so good.
- Oh, God. Come here.

335
00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:28,434
Sit down. Let's see
if she's got anything soothing.

336
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:45,832
Valium. In the convenient economy size.

337
00:34:45,922 --> 00:34:48,413
- You sure?
- Just chills you ever so slightly.

338
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:50,999
You won't even notice it.

339
00:34:56,475 --> 00:34:59,392
Are you sure about this?

340
00:34:59,478 --> 00:35:03,427
You wanna be taken seriously,
you need serious hair.

341
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:43,059
Go for the jugular.
There are 19 million shares outstanding.

342
00:35:43,146 --> 00:35:46,646
We got 25. We get another 5,
we've got 'em by the throat.

343
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:49,485
Trainer, let's grab 'em by the balls.

344
00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:55,156
Cut 'em off at the knees. They'll be
eating out of our hands. What do you say?

345
00:35:55,242 --> 00:35:58,408
- Anybody thirsty?
- We need this one, Trainer.

346
00:35:58,495 --> 00:36:01,615
- You need this one.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:18,597
- I've been looking for you.
- Why? Do you know me?

348
00:36:18,682 --> 00:36:23,723
No, but I promised myself that,
when I saw you, I would get to know you.

349
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:27,599
You're the first woman here
that dresses like a woman,

350
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:31,391
not like a woman thinks
a man would dress if he was a woman.

351
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:35,235
- Thank you, I guess.
- What are you doing here?

352
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:39,784
I'm looking for someone myself. His name
is Jack Trainer. He works at Dewey Stone.

353
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,491
Do you know if he's here?

354
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:44,906
Why are you looking for him?

355
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,407
Well, I have a meeting with him tomorrow.

356
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:51,714
I thought it might be nice
to say hello and get a head start.

357
00:36:52,841 --> 00:36:56,376
Well, he just left.

358
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:04,842
- I should be going myself.
- Have a drink with me.

359
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:08,056
I can't. What's your name?

360
00:37:08,148 --> 00:37:11,315
No. No names. No business cards.

361
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:13,857
- No "You must know so and so".
- What is this?

362
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:17,813
No résumés. Let's just meet
like human beings for once.

363
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:23,987
It's nice to meet you, whatever your name is,
but I do have to go.

364
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:27,497
Please. Please. One drink.

365
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:33,498
OK, one drink. But I'm buying.

366
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,666
OK, but it's an open bar.

367
00:37:35,759 --> 00:37:38,760
I knew that. I meant that
if it wasn't, I would be buying.

368
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:40,304
Yeah.

369
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:44,137
- Tequila Gold. Doubles.
- Tequila?

370
00:37:44,434 --> 00:37:48,895
Yeah. I promised myself that
when we met we'd drink tequila.

371
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,563
No Chardonnay, no frog water.

372
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:54,939
Real drinks.

373
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:11,084
These things are usually so boring.

374
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:16,457
I wouldn't know.

375
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:20,838
Power to the people.

376
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:23,254
The little people.

377
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:32,096
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

378
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,812
Oh boy, oh boy...

379
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:38,187
- You OK?
- I'm fine. I'm just fine.

380
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:45,658
I took an antihistamine before,
and itjust makes for a nice little buzz.

381
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:51,452
I didn't know they let
bad girls into these things.

382
00:38:51,543 --> 00:38:54,793
- Do I look like I don't belong here?
- No.

383
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,132
No, no. I'm sure you're a real ace
at whatever it is that you do do.

384
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:05,549
- Damn straight.
- But how you look...

385
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:12,560
I have a head for business and a bod for sin.

386
00:39:12,647 --> 00:39:16,099
Is there anything wrong with that?

387
00:39:16,193 --> 00:39:18,269
No... No.

388
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:25,151
Hello. Hi.

389
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:27,485
I have to go now.

390
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:30,248
- I'll come with you.
- No.

391
00:39:30,957 --> 00:39:33,246
Hey, Tess.

392
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:48,182
I need some air. Meet me outside. Thank you.

393
00:39:56,566 --> 00:39:57,729
Excuse me.

394
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:17,538
Hello?

395
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:19,705
- Hi.
- Hi.

396
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:30,014
Where do you live?

397
00:40:31,184 --> 00:40:33,806
Where do you live?

398
00:40:33,895 --> 00:40:39,234
Park, trees, tall building.

399
00:40:41,153 --> 00:40:44,568
- 166 Morton. Near Hudson.
- 166 Morton.

400
00:40:57,502 --> 00:41:00,207
Might be kind of a mess.

401
00:41:00,297 --> 00:41:05,208
The cleaning lady
keeps changing days on me.

402
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:07,460
Anybody's guess.

403
00:41:07,554 --> 00:41:13,473
I'm just warning you cos,
if it's the day before, it could be pretty bad.

404
00:41:18,398 --> 00:41:23,226
I don't notice so much myself,
but some of the people I've had over have,

405
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,941
you know, remarked on it.

406
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:41,457
It's not so bad.

407
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:29,670
Would you...

408
00:42:29,761 --> 00:42:32,513
Would you like a nightcap?

409
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,176
I guess not.

410
00:42:39,229 --> 00:42:42,349
I guess it's too late for coffee.

411
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:47,270
Herb tea? Herb tea...?

412
00:42:49,072 --> 00:42:51,361
I don't have any.

413
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:56,242
It always sounds good when people
offer it to me when I'm in your shape.

414
00:42:57,664 --> 00:43:00,784
I might have a little brandy myself.

415
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:07,376
Boy...

416
00:43:07,466 --> 00:43:09,957
You sure are pretty.

417
00:44:46,314 --> 00:44:49,648
Don't fuck up. Don't fuck up.

418
00:44:57,826 --> 00:45:00,696
Hi. Tess McGill to see Jack Trainer.

419
00:45:00,787 --> 00:45:03,705
- May I take your coat?
- Yes, please.

420
00:45:19,556 --> 00:45:22,343
Gentlemen, Tess McGill.

421
00:45:24,978 --> 00:45:28,181
Miss McGill, I'm Jack Trainer.

422
00:45:30,484 --> 00:45:32,772
How are you?

423
00:45:32,861 --> 00:45:35,269
This is John Romano and Bernie Kotar.

424
00:45:35,572 --> 00:45:38,063
Sit down, please.

425
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:45,072
- Coffee?
- Sure.

426
00:45:45,165 --> 00:45:49,163
- Milk or sugar?
- Both, thank you.

427
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,251
I suppose we should just get right down to it.

428
00:45:55,342 --> 00:45:57,418
Sure.

429
00:45:59,387 --> 00:46:01,961
I've lost my briefcase.

430
00:46:04,351 --> 00:46:08,479
In each of the last three quarters,
Trask Industries has announced plans

431
00:46:08,563 --> 00:46:13,854
to acquire a major market television station,
each time unsuccessfully.

432
00:46:13,944 --> 00:46:18,356
At the same time they've expended time
and money fighting off a takeover attempt

433
00:46:18,448 --> 00:46:22,280
by one of their Japanese competitors.

434
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:26,912
Buying into radio would, in one fell swoop
accomplish two important tasks.

435
00:46:27,249 --> 00:46:30,452
It would give Trask
a solid base in broadcasting,

436
00:46:30,544 --> 00:46:35,004
and, because of FCC regulations forbidding
foreign ownership of radio stations,

437
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:39,253
it would wipe out the threat
of a Japanese takeover.

438
00:46:42,597 --> 00:46:45,267
Interesting idea.

439
00:46:46,184 --> 00:46:48,426
But I don't like it.

440
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,556
Trask has got a lot of cash
on their balance sheet.

441
00:46:51,648 --> 00:46:57,069
That's why they're a takeover target.
A radio station is small potatoes.

442
00:46:57,154 --> 00:46:59,479
I can't see him biting.

443
00:46:59,573 --> 00:47:02,194
I've already thought of that.

444
00:47:02,284 --> 00:47:06,862
I figure that we look for a radio network -
one with a real high profile.

445
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:12,625
And with the surplus cash,
we implement a major stock repurchase.

446
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:17,503
So Trask is protected and their stock goes up,
and everybody's happy.

447
00:47:23,597 --> 00:47:25,506
Or not.

448
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:29,018
Shoot me. Just shoot me.

449
00:47:29,102 --> 00:47:33,016
Would you cut that out?
They didn't throw you out, did they?

450
00:47:33,106 --> 00:47:39,987
Well, they don't exactly have bouncers.
They're a little more subtle than that, Cyn.

451
00:47:40,071 --> 00:47:42,989
Oh, God. And last night.

452
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:47,405
Yeah. I should've checked the milligrams.
Live and learn.

453
00:47:48,663 --> 00:47:53,372
Maybe he'll feel sorry for you, and make it
up to you doing your deal or whatever it is.

454
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,916
I'm not looking for sympathy.
You know, I had a shot at...

455
00:48:01,802 --> 00:48:03,841
It's him. He's here.

456
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:07,713
Do me a favour. Be me. Be my secretary.

457
00:48:08,308 --> 00:48:10,764
- Tess.
- Cyn, please, do it for me.

458
00:48:10,852 --> 00:48:12,928
OK...

459
00:48:13,897 --> 00:48:14,928
Tess.

460
00:48:23,698 --> 00:48:26,984
- May I help you?
- Jack Trainer to see Miss McGill.

461
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:33,873
Let's give her a shout, shall we?

462
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:38,337
You decent?

463
00:48:40,215 --> 00:48:43,050
A Mr Jack Trainer to see you, Miss McGill.

464
00:48:43,135 --> 00:48:44,463
Thank you, Cynthia.

465
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:47,672
- Hold all calls, Miss McGill?
- Yes, Cynthia. Thank you.

466
00:48:47,764 --> 00:48:51,548
Can I get you anything, Mr Trainer?
Coffee? Tea? Me?

467
00:48:52,936 --> 00:48:57,064
Isn't she a riot? That'll be all, Cynthia.

468
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:00,600
Why did you say you weren't you last night?

469
00:49:00,694 --> 00:49:05,023
Because I knew what would happen.
All mergers and acquisitions.

470
00:49:05,115 --> 00:49:08,365
No lust and tequila.

471
00:49:09,828 --> 00:49:15,700
That was... Thatjust happened, OK?
I wanna make it clear...

472
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:20,206
What did happen exactly?

473
00:49:20,297 --> 00:49:23,463
The earth moved. The angels wept.

474
00:49:24,468 --> 00:49:27,005
The Polaroids are...

475
00:49:27,846 --> 00:49:30,301
are in my other coat.

476
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,186
Nothing happened. Nothing happened.

477
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:38,271
I woke up in my underwear.

478
00:49:38,356 --> 00:49:40,978
I'll bet you looked nice.

479
00:49:42,444 --> 00:49:45,196
Did you get me that way?

480
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:50,201
I... I took off your shoes and dress,
I put you on the bed.

481
00:49:50,285 --> 00:49:53,535
I kept my eyes closed the whole time.

482
00:49:53,622 --> 00:49:55,910
And that was it?

483
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:59,083
I might have peeked. I don't remember.

484
00:49:59,169 --> 00:50:02,917
Look, I don't have all day to hang out here
and discuss your sex life.

485
00:50:03,006 --> 00:50:05,497
Here.

486
00:50:05,592 --> 00:50:08,344
- What's this?
- Open it.

487
00:50:19,231 --> 00:50:21,270
What's this for?

488
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:26,981
I thought you could use a better briefcase
if we're gonna put this deal together.

489
00:50:27,072 --> 00:50:30,488
- You liked it.
- It has possibilities.

490
00:50:31,451 --> 00:50:33,527
I wanna go to Metro Radio Systems.

491
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,906
They're a family-owned,
mid-sized network in the South.

492
00:50:36,998 --> 00:50:39,703
They had offers before and rejected 'em, but

493
00:50:39,793 --> 00:50:43,411
the father's about to retire,
and the son's just been forced out.

494
00:50:43,505 --> 00:50:46,672
A lot of squabbling. A good time to go in.

495
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:48,171
OK.

496
00:50:48,426 --> 00:50:52,341
Why didn't you just put it together
with your people here? Why come to us?

497
00:50:54,766 --> 00:50:57,767
Will you excuse me for one second?

498
00:50:57,853 --> 00:50:59,929
Sure.

499
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:03,890
You're not helping. No.

500
00:51:03,984 --> 00:51:07,483
Bess, my computer's down.
I need Katharine's office right away.

501
00:51:07,571 --> 00:51:10,240
No problem. I'll be with you in five minutes.

502
00:51:10,532 --> 00:51:13,652
- I need it five minutes ago.
- I'll be right with you.

503
00:51:13,743 --> 00:51:16,863
- What's going on in there?
- She's dusting.

504
00:51:17,205 --> 00:51:23,575
Jack, listen. My one o'clock is getting a little
antsy, so can I walk you to the elevator?

505
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:26,541
Sure, but first answer my question.

506
00:51:27,382 --> 00:51:29,671
Right.

507
00:51:29,759 --> 00:51:32,429
I came to you because

508
00:51:33,221 --> 00:51:36,804
I wanted an ace on this. The best.

509
00:51:38,185 --> 00:51:40,426
Good thinking.

510
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,767
Well, I'll fly down to Memphis
in the morning and feel them out.

511
00:51:45,776 --> 00:51:48,397
Absolutely. Fine.

512
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:57,659
...you'll just have to wait.
- Ginny, go on in. I'll be with you in a minute.

513
00:51:57,746 --> 00:52:00,118
What are you talking about?

514
00:52:05,045 --> 00:52:08,295
Can I get you anything? Coffee? Tea?

515
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:12,000
- Are you free for dinner tonight?
- No, sorry.

516
00:52:13,261 --> 00:52:15,337
How about tomorrow?

517
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:18,514
- I can't.
- When, then?

518
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,265
I don't think we should
get involved that way.

519
00:52:22,354 --> 00:52:25,271
What are you talking about?
What about last night?

520
00:52:25,357 --> 00:52:29,141
Look, I'm not that girl.
Last night was special.

521
00:52:29,236 --> 00:52:32,936
It wasn't so special. I had to
carry you up three flights of stairs.

522
00:52:33,031 --> 00:52:35,569
I meant unusual special.

523
00:52:35,659 --> 00:52:39,028
Look, we're in a business deal
together now,

524
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:42,121
and I don't think we should
get involved that way.

525
00:52:42,207 --> 00:52:44,663
My life is real complicated as it is.

526
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:48,701
I don't wanna complicate it either.
I just thought dinner, a movie.

527
00:52:48,797 --> 00:52:52,925
- We both know what we're talking about.
- I certainly hope so.

528
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:55,927
You know, maybe I just don't like you.

529
00:52:56,263 --> 00:52:58,339
Me? Nah.

530
00:53:24,499 --> 00:53:27,370
- You sure she's gonna show?
- It's my engagement party.

531
00:53:27,461 --> 00:53:30,711
She knows she's dead meat if she doesn't.

532
00:53:34,384 --> 00:53:36,460
Hi, Tess.

533
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:43,340
I'm real sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

534
00:53:43,435 --> 00:53:47,018
You're gonna be outta work,
you keep scamming like you are.

535
00:53:47,105 --> 00:53:51,933
Look, I'm nervous as hell and I think Mick's
about to drown himself in a Scotch bottle.

536
00:53:52,027 --> 00:53:54,648
- He's bad, huh?
- Throw him a bone, will ya?

537
00:53:54,738 --> 00:53:57,858
I want happy humans here tonight.

538
00:54:12,964 --> 00:54:14,838
Tess.

539
00:54:14,925 --> 00:54:17,001
Snake.

540
00:54:19,763 --> 00:54:22,764
You look different.

541
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:26,847
I'm not the same pathetic, trusting fool
that I was a couple of days ago.

542
00:54:26,937 --> 00:54:29,891
- It shows, huh?
- Hey, Tess. What are you havin'?

543
00:54:29,981 --> 00:54:32,733
Stow this behind the bar for me,
will you, Tony?

544
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:36,483
And I'll have a Chivas,
and buy Mick one of whatever.

545
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:38,647
You got it.

546
00:54:40,075 --> 00:54:44,452
No, I just meant the hair, the duds,
and the briefcase. What's goin' on?

547
00:54:44,538 --> 00:54:48,120
- Make fun if you want.
- No, no. You look good.

548
00:54:49,126 --> 00:54:51,202
Classy.

549
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:55,543
Did you have to go
to traffic court or somethin'?

550
00:54:55,632 --> 00:54:59,416
No, I just got off work.
I sort of got a promotion.

551
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:03,256
Well...

552
00:55:03,348 --> 00:55:06,302
To Cyn and Tim.

553
00:55:06,393 --> 00:55:08,682
To you and me.

554
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,977
To you and your promotion.

555
00:55:11,064 --> 00:55:15,014
- To me getting a boat loan.
- You what? You did?

556
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:19,938
It was approved this morning. Put a
down payment on Jimmy Noonan's old boat.

557
00:55:20,031 --> 00:55:22,320
That's so great.

558
00:56:13,752 --> 00:56:18,248
"Hours of fun for the entire family.
Love, Tess and Mick."

559
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,419
Thank you.

560
00:56:22,093 --> 00:56:26,222
I put from both of us. I didn't know
if you'd gotten something or what.

561
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:29,307
OK, toast. We need a toast.

562
00:56:30,811 --> 00:56:31,842
Thank you. Thank you.

563
00:56:31,937 --> 00:56:34,641
From me and Tess and everybody here,

564
00:56:34,731 --> 00:56:40,152
may your life together be long and happy,
and may the road always rise up to meet you.

565
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,691
When are we gonna toast
the two of you, Mick?

566
00:56:49,412 --> 00:56:53,244
- We haven't really discussed it. Not recently.
- No.

567
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:56,204
You don't discuss it, boy. You just ask.

568
00:56:57,462 --> 00:56:59,087
Here?

569
00:56:59,589 --> 00:57:02,839
- Now?
- On your knees, man.

570
00:57:04,261 --> 00:57:08,210
Mick.

571
00:57:22,237 --> 00:57:24,526
Tess, will you marry me?

572
00:57:26,616 --> 00:57:28,692
Maybe.

573
00:57:29,953 --> 00:57:32,444
That's an answer?

574
00:57:33,206 --> 00:57:36,907
You want another answer, ask another girl.

575
00:57:51,808 --> 00:57:56,186
- You fuckin' humiliated us in there.
- You set us up, doing it like that.

576
00:57:56,271 --> 00:58:00,185
What did you expect me to do?
Lie in front of all of those people?

577
00:58:00,275 --> 00:58:03,311
Didn't know you'd have to lie.
I thought you'd want me to ask.

578
00:58:03,403 --> 00:58:06,190
Three nights ago,
I find you in bed with Doreen.

579
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:10,409
We have a drink, a dance, and boom -
you want an answer about the rest of my life.

580
00:58:10,494 --> 00:58:12,154
All right. OK.

581
00:58:12,245 --> 00:58:15,412
Here we are, just the two of us.
Will you marry me or what?

582
00:58:15,499 --> 00:58:18,120
Jesus, Mick.
Do we have to decide this right now?

583
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:21,080
I want to get things solidified.
Things in my life.

584
00:58:21,171 --> 00:58:23,958
You're not the only one
who's got plans, you know.

585
00:58:24,049 --> 00:58:26,207
- I said maybe.
- Maybe means dick.

586
00:58:26,301 --> 00:58:28,507
Fuck maybe. I want an answer now.

587
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,054
Please don't yell at me.
You treat me like I'm...

588
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,596
Why do we always talk about
how you get treated?

589
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:38,136
Who the fuck died
and made you Grace Kelly?

590
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:41,895
I am not steak. You can'tjust order me.

591
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:45,317
You get your priorities straight,
maybe we'll talk.

592
00:58:45,403 --> 00:58:47,941
Right now, we're history.

593
00:59:15,892 --> 00:59:18,846
Katharine Parker's office.

594
00:59:20,647 --> 00:59:22,770
I'll switch you over.

595
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:26,190
Tess, it's me.

596
00:59:30,031 --> 00:59:32,867
I couldn't find the red shoes...

597
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:38,155
Tess McGill's office. Who's calling?

598
00:59:38,832 --> 00:59:41,121
One moment, please.

599
00:59:43,587 --> 00:59:44,618
Jack.

600
00:59:44,713 --> 00:59:47,548
It went well in Memphis. Yeah...

601
00:59:47,632 --> 00:59:51,844
Really well, I think. But we're gonna
have to move fast and hit 'em high.

602
00:59:51,928 --> 00:59:56,970
Armbrister thinks that Metro is family,
and you know how that can be.

603
00:59:57,058 --> 01:00:01,934
He's willing to listen,
but you gotta get Trask to talk sweet.

604
01:00:02,022 --> 01:00:04,691
He's thinking about 70 mil.

605
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:08,108
I've been up here all night,
working the numbers.

606
01:00:08,195 --> 01:00:11,065
I'd like to go over it with you.
Can we meet for lunch?

607
01:00:11,156 --> 01:00:14,988
Lunch is all right, isn't it?
Daylight, a lot of people around.

608
01:00:15,076 --> 01:00:20,035
There's that real romantic souvlaki stand,
out in front of your place.

609
01:00:20,123 --> 01:00:23,041
You're in no particular danger, I think.

610
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,669
Yeah. Meet you there around one.

611
01:00:30,008 --> 01:00:32,879
OK, I'll see you then. Bye.

612
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:38,049
Mick's really raw.

613
01:00:38,141 --> 01:00:41,973
He says he's gonna throw
the rest of your stuff out.

614
01:00:42,896 --> 01:00:46,431
He kept me there talkin' at me
till five this morning.

615
01:00:46,525 --> 01:00:49,016
Oh, God, Cyn. I'm sorry.

616
01:00:51,571 --> 01:00:55,355
- How hard would it be to crash a wedding?
- What are you talkin' about?

617
01:00:55,450 --> 01:01:00,278
Oren Trask's daughter is getting married
tomorrow. The reception is at the Union Club.

618
01:01:00,372 --> 01:01:03,907
So I figure I blend in. I get to Trask.

619
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,788
I mean, how hard could that be?

620
01:01:06,878 --> 01:01:10,828
The wedding party's not gonna admit
that they've never seen you before.

621
01:01:10,924 --> 01:01:13,130
Nobody knows everybody at those things.

622
01:01:13,218 --> 01:01:16,053
- Tess...
- All I need is five minutes with Trask.

623
01:01:16,138 --> 01:01:18,675
Tess, I'm talkin' to you.

624
01:01:18,765 --> 01:01:20,509
What?

625
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,723
First of all, look me in the eye

626
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:26,511
and tell me you're not thinking,
even in your wildest dreams,

627
01:01:26,606 --> 01:01:31,980
Mr Briefcase "Let's have lunch" there
is gonna take you away from all of this.

628
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:34,692
We're doing a deal together, that's all.

629
01:01:34,781 --> 01:01:39,075
Cos you know you'll get your heart stomped,
just like you're stompin' Mick's.

630
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:43,454
Hey, it wasn't me poppin'
Doreen DiMucci in our bed, OK?

631
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:47,372
- How come you're all on his side?
- I'm not.

632
01:01:47,461 --> 01:01:52,917
But you're not even giving him the chance
to make it up to you, and that's not like you.

633
01:01:53,008 --> 01:01:58,429
Look, if you're so smart, why don't you act
smart and save your ass while you still can?

634
01:01:58,513 --> 01:02:02,926
Else they're gonna find out,
you're not gonna have yourjob, or any job.

635
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:05,094
You lost your man and your home already.

636
01:02:05,187 --> 01:02:10,643
I'm gonna come clean as soon as
I get my end set up. I swear.

637
01:02:10,734 --> 01:02:14,019
- I know what I'm doing.
- So do I. Screwin' up your life.

638
01:02:14,112 --> 01:02:16,319
No, I'm trying to make it better.

639
01:02:16,406 --> 01:02:20,356
I'm not gonna spend my life
working my ass off and getting nowhere

640
01:02:20,452 --> 01:02:25,078
just because I followed rules that
I had nothing to do with setting up, OK?

641
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:31,077
Tess McGill's office.

642
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:33,294
Katharine... No.

643
01:02:33,381 --> 01:02:35,955
Of course it's still your office. I was just...

644
01:02:36,051 --> 01:02:38,542
I'll see you, Tess.

645
01:02:40,347 --> 01:02:42,423
Cyn.

646
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:48,802
Sometimes I sing and dance
around the house in my underwear.

647
01:02:48,897 --> 01:02:52,313
Doesn't make me Madonna. Never will.

648
01:02:54,861 --> 01:02:58,230
- Are you there?
- Yes, Katharine.

649
01:02:58,657 --> 01:03:02,701
Don't get too used to those long lunches.
I'm coming back a week from today.

650
01:03:02,786 --> 01:03:06,155
A week from today?
Isn't that faster than you thought?

651
01:03:06,248 --> 01:03:09,118
Well, the doctor says I've got great bones.

652
01:03:09,209 --> 01:03:13,289
Of course, his aren't too bad either.

653
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:16,998
Anyway, I need you to summarise
the Baron Oil prospectus...

654
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:18,503
Hi, Schatz.

655
01:03:18,593 --> 01:03:22,673
And send that to me along with
the last two quarterly reports.

656
01:03:22,764 --> 01:03:26,133
- You are a sport.
- Yes, I'm a sport.

657
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:31,178
OK. Bye.

658
01:03:34,568 --> 01:03:37,771
So what kind of figures
have you been throwing at 'em?

659
01:03:37,863 --> 01:03:40,235
Well, no exact figures yet.

660
01:03:40,323 --> 01:03:42,779
What's their ballpark?

661
01:03:42,868 --> 01:03:47,862
I want to get them excited about the concept
before I start throwing actual figures at them.

662
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:51,455
- Are they excited?
- They're going to be.

663
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:54,913
Wait a minute.

664
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:58,125
I've been working on this thing
for 36 hours straight.

665
01:03:58,216 --> 01:04:02,261
I got a progress meeting with
the head of my department at 2 o'clock.

666
01:04:02,345 --> 01:04:05,928
- Where the hell exactly are we?
- Don't yell at me.

667
01:04:06,016 --> 01:04:08,554
Answer me.

668
01:04:08,643 --> 01:04:12,688
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna see
Trask himself tomorrow.

669
01:04:12,773 --> 01:04:15,809
I feel that we're strong enough
to go right to him.

670
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:18,771
Where are we meeting him? What time?

671
01:04:18,862 --> 01:04:21,567
He's not expecting both of us.

672
01:04:24,242 --> 01:04:26,912
Are you trying to fly this thing without me?

673
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:31,740
- No. I wouldn't do that.
- You go and set up this meeting without me.

674
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:35,249
What the hell kind of a way
to do business is this?

675
01:04:35,337 --> 01:04:39,037
- Would you calm down?
- How am I supposed to calm down?

676
01:04:39,132 --> 01:04:42,133
One lost deal is all it takes
to get canned these days.

677
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:46,430
The line buttons on my phone all have
an inch of little pieces of tape piled on.

678
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,756
The names of new guys over old guys.

679
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:54,474
Good men who aren't at the other end of
the line any more, all cos of one lost deal.

680
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:59,810
I don't wanna get buried
under a little piece of tape.

681
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,476
No one's trying to do that.

682
01:05:02,572 --> 01:05:05,242
OK, so I've been in a little bit of a slump.

683
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:09,654
I'm not afraid to admit it. Give me
a break here. Don't go leading me on.

684
01:05:09,746 --> 01:05:13,245
If you got doubts about me,
say 'em to my face. Give me that much.

685
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,705
I don't have any doubts about you.

686
01:05:17,587 --> 01:05:19,663
OK.

687
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:22,755
You need me, you know.

688
01:05:22,843 --> 01:05:27,090
- I mean any doubts about your ability.
- You need me at that meeting.

689
01:05:30,183 --> 01:05:32,853
Is he jet-lagged, or he just lunches late?

690
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,270
Three o'clock's a late lunch.

691
01:05:35,355 --> 01:05:39,305
Well, it's not exactly lunch,
but there will be food there.

692
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:44,193
- What's the story, Tess?
- It's his daughter's wedding.

693
01:05:44,281 --> 01:05:46,736
- That's the meeting?
- It's perfect.

694
01:05:46,825 --> 01:05:50,905
He's happy, he's had a little champagne.
We look for an opening. Trust me.

695
01:05:50,996 --> 01:05:53,950
What are we supposed to do?
Jump out of the wedding cake?

696
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,531
Don't be silly.

697
01:06:20,317 --> 01:06:22,393
Welcome to our party. Come in.

698
01:06:26,907 --> 01:06:30,358
Hello. Nice to see you.
Do you know which table you're at?

699
01:06:31,036 --> 01:06:33,527
- No...
- Yes. I do, darling.

700
01:06:34,122 --> 01:06:36,613
I see Phyllis. Come on.

701
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:46,382
Glad you could make it.
Oren and Barbara Trask.

702
01:06:46,843 --> 01:06:49,548
- Tess McGill. What a great idea.
- Jack Trainer.

703
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:53,766
- It's so nice to see you again.
- Well, the kids thought it would be fun.

704
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:57,978
- You must be friends of Mark's.
- Well, let's get you over there.

705
01:06:58,063 --> 01:07:02,808
Actually, I should go powder my bathroom...
nose. Darling, will you wait here?

706
01:07:02,901 --> 01:07:05,688
It's so nice... See you later.

707
01:07:05,904 --> 01:07:08,525
I think I'll get a drink.

708
01:07:08,615 --> 01:07:09,445
Bunny.

709
01:07:20,794 --> 01:07:22,952
Isn't he gorgeous?

710
01:07:34,558 --> 01:07:37,262
Get a grip. Get a grip, Tess. Get a grip.

711
01:07:47,821 --> 01:07:50,738
We're not even invited to this thing, are we?

712
01:07:50,824 --> 01:07:55,616
OK, so we're not exactly invited. But he's here
and we're here. So that makes us...

713
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:59,404
- Total idiots.
...in the right place at the right time.

714
01:07:59,499 --> 01:08:01,824
You're like one of those crazed cops.

715
01:08:01,918 --> 01:08:06,746
The kind nobody wants to ride with,
whose partners all end up dead or crazy.

716
01:08:07,424 --> 01:08:09,713
Just act like you belong.

717
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:20,677
Do you love it or do you hate it?

718
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:23,892
- Love it.
- So do I.

719
01:08:23,982 --> 01:08:28,727
But Mark says it looks like Nicaragua and
that we're making some kind of statement.

720
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:31,905
Oh, no. It's just like paradise.

721
01:08:32,491 --> 01:08:35,860
It's like a paradise with little gold palm trees.

722
01:08:37,537 --> 01:08:40,028
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

723
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:46,958
I hope I'm not being rude, but who are you?

724
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,922
I'm Tess. I'm... I'm a friend of Mark's.

725
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:57,420
I'm just so happy that
I could be here for you today.

726
01:08:58,266 --> 01:09:01,931
Glorious. Fabulous. Stunning, really.

727
01:09:02,354 --> 01:09:04,975
Super. Elegant. Perfect.

728
01:09:26,378 --> 01:09:29,332
You're right. This is crazy, so let's just go.

729
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:33,379
Excuse me.

730
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:36,553
The woman that's dancing with Oren -
what's her name?

731
01:09:36,638 --> 01:09:39,592
- Elizabeth Stubblefield?
- That's right.

732
01:09:40,642 --> 01:09:43,892
- Liz? Beth?
- Bitsy.

733
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,055
Bitsy. That's right.

734
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:48,433
Jack...

735
01:09:48,525 --> 01:09:51,016
You wanna do it, do it.

736
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:57,649
Excuse us. Bitsy, don't break my heart
and tell me you don't remember me.

737
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:01,613
- Of course I do.
- Excuse us.

738
01:10:05,959 --> 01:10:08,450
Talk about a small world, huh?

739
01:10:08,545 --> 01:10:14,049
I mean, here we've just met and yet I feel
I've spent so much time working with you.

740
01:10:14,134 --> 01:10:17,503
In a way. I'm in Mergers and Acquisitions
at Petty Marsh.

741
01:10:18,346 --> 01:10:21,217
I really wish we were having more luck
with your team.

742
01:10:21,308 --> 01:10:23,846
So do I. So do I.

743
01:10:23,935 --> 01:10:26,853
I've been trying to set you up
with a radio network,

744
01:10:26,938 --> 01:10:31,185
but my bosses think you're stuck on
acquiring television and won't listen.

745
01:10:31,276 --> 01:10:34,360
- Well, that's not true.
- That's what I said.

746
01:10:34,446 --> 01:10:37,566
I said that the man who in 1971
looked into the future

747
01:10:37,657 --> 01:10:40,575
and saw that it was named
microwave technology,

748
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:46,081
the man who applied Japanese management
ideas while others kowtowed to the unions,

749
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:49,784
the man who saw the Ma Bell break-up
coming from miles away,

750
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:53,792
this man did not get to be
this man-you, I mean -

751
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:58,425
by shutting himself off to new ideas.
Am I right or am I right?

752
01:10:58,512 --> 01:11:01,216
- I think you're right.
- Damn straight I'm right.

753
01:11:01,306 --> 01:11:03,512
If you have a property, I'd love to hear.

754
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,806
- You would?
- Well, absolutely.

755
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,970
- What looks good now?
- There she is.

756
01:11:08,313 --> 01:11:12,525
I just realised that I...
I'm hogging the father of the bride.

757
01:11:12,609 --> 01:11:16,938
And I see Phyllis coming... What do you say
that I give you a call on Monday?

758
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:21,692
- Our media consultant is Tim Draper.
- Tim. Right.

759
01:11:21,785 --> 01:11:24,572
- Honey, I'm starved.
- So am I.

760
01:11:24,663 --> 01:11:26,869
- Bye.
- Bye.

761
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:33,082
Go ahead and laugh. He wants us to meet
with his people first thing Monday.

762
01:11:33,171 --> 01:11:36,955
Oren Trask? The man who said "What if
we sliced the bread before we sold it?"

763
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:38,544
All right...

764
01:11:38,635 --> 01:11:43,012
No, no, no. I loved it.
I had fun. And you were amazing.

765
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:46,256
- You think so?
- Amazing.

766
01:11:51,773 --> 01:11:58,143
The Fort Worth station-projected revenues
should read up 8, not 6.

767
01:11:58,697 --> 01:12:05,945
And where it says the FCC ruling on
Metro's Memphis transmitter is pending,

768
01:12:06,037 --> 01:12:09,323
that's outdated. FCC approved it Friday.

769
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:12,658
Doubles the signal reach.

770
01:12:13,253 --> 01:12:15,744
Ups the station's value by 30.

771
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:26,672
And now back to our regularly
scheduled programming.

772
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,976
I guess we're ready.

773
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:47,326
- Trainer and McGill.
- Yes. Top of the stairs.

774
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:05,877
Are we waiting for Mr Trask?

775
01:13:05,972 --> 01:13:08,807
Mr Trask doesn't sit in at this level.

776
01:13:09,684 --> 01:13:12,638
Of course he doesn't.

777
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:17,640
Here's the way we see it. Trask Industries
has two important needs to meet at this time.

778
01:13:17,734 --> 01:13:22,941
By acquiring Metro Radio Network,
you nail two birds with one stone...

779
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:27,195
Excuse me. Do you have any
other proposals besides Metro?

780
01:13:28,411 --> 01:13:31,412
- No. Why?
- Metro's a terrific opportunity.

781
01:13:31,706 --> 01:13:37,211
I'm sure it is, but a Chicago group
just put a bear hug on Metro this morning

782
01:13:37,295 --> 01:13:40,083
and the company's in play.

783
01:13:40,173 --> 01:13:42,795
- Just this morning?
- Who?

784
01:13:43,301 --> 01:13:45,590
The Slade brothers.

785
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,755
Trask isn't aiming at radio anyway.

786
01:13:47,848 --> 01:13:51,715
We certainly don't want
to get into a bidding war.

787
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:54,182
A moment, please.

788
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:59,146
Armbrister looks at Metro as if it were part
of his family. He cares who he's selling to.

789
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:02,354
Yes. And he holds the majority of the stock.

790
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:09,401
Look. If the Slades are uninvited,
and I'm sure they are,

791
01:14:09,494 --> 01:14:14,322
and Armbrister and Trask can agree
on a deal, then we won't have a war.

792
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:17,701
If I get Armbrister up here,
will Trask take the meeting?

793
01:14:17,794 --> 01:14:20,748
A lot of ifs. We really
don't want to get involved.

794
01:14:20,964 --> 01:14:24,547
- 24 hours.
- Sorry. Not interested.

795
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:35,306
Yes, sir.

796
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,893
All right, sir.

797
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:46,114
Yes, he'll take the meeting.

798
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:50,074
- That was Mr Trask?
- Yes, it was.

799
01:14:51,244 --> 01:14:54,162
How did he know?

800
01:14:54,247 --> 01:14:56,240
He knows evertyhing.

801
01:16:32,053 --> 01:16:34,129
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

802
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:08,161
How'd you get this scar?

803
01:17:10,467 --> 01:17:12,839
Some guy pulled a knife in Detroit.

804
01:17:14,012 --> 01:17:16,088
Really?

805
01:17:17,724 --> 01:17:19,800
No. No.

806
01:17:20,644 --> 01:17:23,514
I was 19 and I thought
it'd be cool to have a pierced ear.

807
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:28,600
My girlfriend stuck the needle through
and I fainted and hit my chin on the toilet.

808
01:17:32,197 --> 01:17:36,195
Have you been telling that story ever since?

809
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:39,867
You're the only one
who knows the true story.

810
01:17:41,331 --> 01:17:43,822
Except the girlfriend.

811
01:17:45,544 --> 01:17:48,379
I had her disappear.

812
01:17:49,673 --> 01:17:54,216
It's too bad. Nice girl. Real shame.

813
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:08,645
Jack, there's something that I have to tell you.

814
01:18:19,286 --> 01:18:21,362
Hello.

815
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,156
Hi.

816
01:18:29,713 --> 01:18:31,871
I know. No...

817
01:18:31,965 --> 01:18:34,373
Can't wait.

818
01:18:38,472 --> 01:18:41,176
Yeah, OK. Well, call me when you get in.

819
01:18:43,226 --> 01:18:45,302
OK.

820
01:18:47,397 --> 01:18:49,604
Me too.

821
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:51,980
OK. Bye.

822
01:18:52,569 --> 01:18:54,645
Bye.

823
01:19:10,962 --> 01:19:13,714
OK... There's this woman.

824
01:19:13,799 --> 01:19:16,171
It's over.

825
01:19:16,259 --> 01:19:21,254
But technically it's not. I just haven't
had a chance to break it off yet.

826
01:19:21,348 --> 01:19:24,099
It's OK. You don't have to explain.

827
01:19:24,184 --> 01:19:28,929
No, really. We were supposed to go away
together a couple of weeks ago

828
01:19:29,022 --> 01:19:31,145
and I was gonna tell her then.

829
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:34,150
But I had to work through the weekend
and never got there.

830
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:37,984
It's just a... a timing thing.

831
01:19:38,448 --> 01:19:41,200
It's just she broke her leg skiing
and was laid up

832
01:19:41,284 --> 01:19:45,781
and I couldn't see doing it
over the phone, you know.

833
01:19:45,872 --> 01:19:48,707
Kicking somebody when they're down.

834
01:19:51,795 --> 01:19:55,495
I wouldn't mention it, except
she's in your department at Petty.

835
01:19:55,590 --> 01:20:00,003
- You mentioned her the first time you called.
- Katharine.

836
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:03,718
Parker. Yeah.

837
01:20:06,184 --> 01:20:08,889
Now what did you wanna tell me?

838
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,016
It's not important.

839
01:20:15,569 --> 01:20:17,645
120, even.

840
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,961
Miss. Miss, you forget your book.

841
01:21:19,257 --> 01:21:21,748
Tess. It's me. I'm back.

842
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:24,336
Thanks.

843
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:29,889
She took a muscle relaxant for the flight.

844
01:21:29,976 --> 01:21:32,728
- Let's all have one.
- I don't think so.

845
01:21:32,813 --> 01:21:34,852
Telephone. I need a telephone.

846
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:37,976
Tess, take care of the bags.
I'll meet you at the car.

847
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:42,771
I love these pills.

848
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:46,199
Just for a minute, Jack. Please?

849
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,236
I must see you, darling.

850
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:53,495
My apartment in one hour
and I won't take no for an answer.

851
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:55,955
No, I won't take no for an answer.

852
01:21:58,255 --> 01:22:00,876
Oh, I'm home. I'm home, I'm home.

853
01:22:03,301 --> 01:22:05,377
Oh, God...

854
01:22:10,976 --> 01:22:13,597
- Did you happen to see this?
- What is it?

855
01:22:13,687 --> 01:22:17,471
It's an outline of your idea
for a Trask radio acquisition.

856
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:22,940
I was planning to send it over to Jack Trainer.
I thought I'd give your idea one last go-round.

857
01:22:23,029 --> 01:22:27,941
Itjust occurs to me, looking at it,
that it reads as though it were my idea.

858
01:22:28,034 --> 01:22:33,242
Jack got burned once. He was accused of
stealing a plan for taking a company private.

859
01:22:33,331 --> 01:22:37,661
He's very sticky about the ethics of
reviewing other people's strategies.

860
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:42,960
He wouldn't do it if it was from a colleague,
and I couldn't say it was a secretary's notion.

861
01:22:43,049 --> 01:22:47,379
Anyway, the point is, Tess,
that I'm still trying to get you heard.

862
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:53,722
What am I saying? If you had seen it,
you simply would have asked me about it.

863
01:22:54,478 --> 01:22:56,766
Trust.

864
01:22:59,232 --> 01:23:01,854
I'll need help bathing and changing.

865
01:23:04,821 --> 01:23:07,608
I need something to cover this cast.

866
01:23:08,241 --> 01:23:10,530
There's an afghan on the chair.

867
01:23:13,497 --> 01:23:16,367
- Perfect.
- If that'll be all...

868
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:20,752
And some perfume.
Shalimar, on the dresser.

869
01:23:23,089 --> 01:23:25,581
He loves Shalimar.

870
01:23:27,093 --> 01:23:29,466
- He, who?
- Jack Trainer, who.

871
01:23:29,846 --> 01:23:31,922
He's on his way over.

872
01:23:32,015 --> 01:23:34,720
I have to go. Doctor's appointment.

873
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:38,558
One last thing? Run down
to the drugstore and get me my pills?

874
01:23:38,647 --> 01:23:42,098
- I really have to go.
- The doctor will understand.

875
01:23:43,777 --> 01:23:45,853
Thanks.

876
01:24:10,887 --> 01:24:13,378
- Who is it?
- Jack.

877
01:24:23,233 --> 01:24:25,724
- Katharine?
- In the bedroom.

878
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:32,783
Jack.

879
01:24:32,868 --> 01:24:34,944
Katharine.

880
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:38,528
Boy, did I ever miss you.

881
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:42,534
- Does it hurt?
- Look at you.

882
01:24:42,627 --> 01:24:46,957
- You said it was urgent, Kath.
- I'd forgotten how handsome you are.

883
01:24:47,632 --> 01:24:50,005
Thanks. Look...

884
01:24:50,093 --> 01:24:52,465
I meant what I said. I really am swamped...

885
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:56,172
Boy, some welcome home.
I haven't even gotten a kiss.

886
01:25:03,732 --> 01:25:08,061
There's some champagne in
the little fridge. You wanna get it for us?

887
01:25:08,153 --> 01:25:11,985
Sure. And then, I really do have to go.

888
01:25:28,882 --> 01:25:32,085
- Where are the glasses?
- Try the dishwasher.

889
01:25:42,687 --> 01:25:45,178
Here you are.

890
01:25:50,362 --> 01:25:53,316
You know I love you, Jack. You know that.

891
01:25:55,325 --> 01:25:57,068
I have to get going.

892
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:02,499
These past few weeks, I've heard this
funny little sound, way deep down inside.

893
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:06,079
Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.

894
01:26:06,837 --> 01:26:11,249
- My biological clock.
- Big deal going. Principals are all meeting...

895
01:26:11,341 --> 01:26:15,042
And I've been thinking "Let's merge."

896
01:26:15,512 --> 01:26:17,505
You and I.

897
01:26:17,597 --> 01:26:21,429
Think of it, darling.
Mr and Mrs Fabulously Happy.

898
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:27,012
Katharine, it's really not a good time to talk.

899
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:30,267
You're right.

900
01:26:30,902 --> 01:26:33,476
Can Big Jack come out to play?

901
01:26:33,572 --> 01:26:37,984
- Little Jack really has to get going.
- Little Katie's been so lonely...

902
01:26:38,076 --> 01:26:40,484
No. No. No.

903
01:26:40,579 --> 01:26:42,655
Jack. What is it?

904
01:26:44,082 --> 01:26:47,747
There's something I have to tell you.
There's someone else and I...

905
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:50,327
There's someone else?

906
01:26:51,173 --> 01:26:54,707
Someone else that I have to be meeting
right now. Big deal going.

907
01:26:54,801 --> 01:26:57,672
Can't be in two places at the same time.

908
01:26:57,762 --> 01:27:00,135
Talk to you later. Bye.

909
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:16,856
Here we are.

910
01:27:23,455 --> 01:27:26,124
OK, I've gotta run. Sorry. Bye.

911
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:38,961
Tess, you forgot your notebook.

912
01:27:59,324 --> 01:28:02,076
That little slut.

913
01:28:02,869 --> 01:28:05,906
Goddamn little bitch secretary.

914
01:28:09,209 --> 01:28:11,332
Hi. I have a meeting with Mr Trask.

915
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:13,496
- Your name, please?
- Tess McGill.

916
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:16,126
All right. It's at the top of the stairs.

917
01:28:26,143 --> 01:28:27,685
Miss McGill.

918
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:30,260
Good afternoon. Let me take your coat.

919
01:28:32,065 --> 01:28:34,556
- Thank you.
- This way, please.

920
01:28:37,028 --> 01:28:39,104
Thank you.

921
01:28:48,748 --> 01:28:51,286
- Hi.
- Hi. Is evertyhing OK?

922
01:28:51,376 --> 01:28:56,003
Yeah, yeah. You're the only one
from Petty here so far. What's going on?

923
01:28:56,089 --> 01:28:59,043
- Flying solo on this.
- Good.

924
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:02,965
Old Armbrister and Trask are over there.

925
01:29:03,054 --> 01:29:06,388
We're waiting to see what colour smoke
comes out of the chimney.

926
01:29:06,475 --> 01:29:10,971
Tell me something. If a colleague of mine
had a strategy they needed help with,

927
01:29:11,062 --> 01:29:14,811
- Would you look at it if I asked you to?
- Yeah, sure.

928
01:29:15,066 --> 01:29:19,645
No ethics problem? You know,
open to accusations about stealing?

929
01:29:19,738 --> 01:29:23,237
I look at stuff all the time.
Nobody's ever accused me of stealing.

930
01:29:23,325 --> 01:29:25,946
What's it about?

931
01:29:27,037 --> 01:29:31,615
I don't know. I'm so nervous,
I can't stand still.

932
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:36,326
You'll be fine.

933
01:29:39,758 --> 01:29:42,249
I love you.

934
01:29:44,554 --> 01:29:46,880
I love you too.

935
01:29:48,767 --> 01:29:51,388
Gentlemen?

936
01:30:09,746 --> 01:30:12,747
There was a story on the news last night

937
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:16,248
showing life imitating
an old children's riddle.

938
01:30:17,212 --> 01:30:22,882
A truck got stuck at the entrance to the
Holland Tunnel. Too high for the clearance.

939
01:30:22,968 --> 01:30:28,887
For hours, the experts tried to find some way
to unwedge the vehicle, but to no avail.

940
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:33,343
Finally, a 10-year-old girl in a passing car

941
01:30:33,437 --> 01:30:38,182
suggested simply letting
the air out of the truck's tyres,

942
01:30:38,275 --> 01:30:42,569
thus lowering it to the clearance level,
which they did.

943
01:30:42,654 --> 01:30:45,145
And it worked.

944
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:51,533
Well, by letting some of the air out of
our strategy to expand into broadcasting,

945
01:30:51,621 --> 01:30:56,995
Miss McGill and Mr Trainer have effectively
shown all of us here at Trask

946
01:30:57,085 --> 01:30:59,790
the light at the end of our tunnel.

947
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,418
Gentlemen and ladies.

948
01:31:08,096 --> 01:31:11,928
I've decided to sell Mr Trask
the Metro Radio System

949
01:31:12,017 --> 01:31:15,801
for $68.5 million in cash and securities.

950
01:31:15,896 --> 01:31:19,099
Now, of course, this is
an agreement in principle.

951
01:31:19,191 --> 01:31:23,899
As to what constitutes principles
in this day and age,

952
01:31:23,987 --> 01:31:28,316
I'm gonna leave that
up to you barracudas to squabble over.

953
01:31:28,408 --> 01:31:31,077
I'm certain they'll want to hear this.

954
01:31:32,704 --> 01:31:35,575
Miss, this is a closed meeting and you can't...

955
01:31:35,665 --> 01:31:37,208
Thank God I'm here.

956
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:40,626
- What the hell is going on?
- You're being tricked.

957
01:31:40,712 --> 01:31:44,840
- Katharine, what...
- Jack, just trust me and sit down.

958
01:31:45,717 --> 01:31:50,379
I'm Katharine Parker. I'm an associate partner
in Mergers and Acquisitions at Petty Marsh.

959
01:31:50,472 --> 01:31:53,177
And this woman is my secretary.

960
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:58,059
- She's not.
- Oh, no? Ask her.

961
01:31:58,355 --> 01:32:02,483
- You're not her secretary.
- I can explain, Jack.

962
01:32:03,944 --> 01:32:06,435
Oh, Jesus. You are her secretary.

963
01:32:06,905 --> 01:32:09,147
While I was laid up with broken bones,

964
01:32:09,241 --> 01:32:13,737
she rifled through my desk, found my memo
outlining a Trask radio acquisition

965
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:16,201
and has been passing it off as her idea.

966
01:32:16,289 --> 01:32:20,417
It was my idea. She stole it from me, I swear.

967
01:32:20,502 --> 01:32:23,787
Good God, Tess.
Don't you know when to stop?

968
01:32:23,964 --> 01:32:26,502
But you're lying.

969
01:32:36,101 --> 01:32:38,177
Thank you.

970
01:32:39,104 --> 01:32:41,346
Thank you.

971
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:48,646
Thank you all so much.

972
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:54,694
The upside is that I have found out
in time to control the damage.

973
01:32:54,786 --> 01:32:58,618
We have containment
and we have a deal on the table.

974
01:32:58,707 --> 01:33:03,784
I say pass me a set of papers
and let's get on with it.

975
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:08,001
Who's running this thing?

976
01:33:08,091 --> 01:33:10,380
Just a second, please.

977
01:33:13,221 --> 01:33:15,510
I know you don't believe me, but...

978
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:19,971
It doesn't matter. I'm sorry.

979
01:33:20,937 --> 01:33:22,645
I'm sorry.

980
01:33:22,856 --> 01:33:25,181
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

981
01:33:49,174 --> 01:33:51,250
Well, gentlemen.

982
01:33:52,344 --> 01:33:55,214
The players may have changed,
but the game is the same.

983
01:33:55,305 --> 01:33:58,223
The name of the game is "Let's make a deal".

984
01:33:59,184 --> 01:34:05,139
If you turn to page 22 in your prospectus,
I'll take you through the terms of transferral.

985
01:35:34,821 --> 01:35:37,359
Well, they did it.

986
01:35:37,449 --> 01:35:39,940
Yeah. They sure did.

987
01:35:41,203 --> 01:35:43,694
You really look great.

988
01:35:44,748 --> 01:35:47,749
- How are you?
- Good, good.

989
01:35:49,085 --> 01:35:52,003
- Business is great and...
- Mick, did you see me?

990
01:35:52,088 --> 01:35:54,580
I caught it one-handed.

991
01:35:55,801 --> 01:35:58,671
- Hi.
- Hey, Doreen.

992
01:36:01,223 --> 01:36:07,059
And my boat's booked through three weeks
from now. Doreen's workin' the lines for me.

993
01:36:07,145 --> 01:36:09,601
That's great. Really.

994
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:13,890
So how's life in the fast lane?

995
01:36:14,569 --> 01:36:17,239
Well, it's fast.

996
01:36:18,073 --> 01:36:20,362
It's real fast and busy and...

997
01:36:21,785 --> 01:36:25,533
It's good to see you, Mick.
I guess I'd better get.

998
01:36:26,414 --> 01:36:29,119
Yeah, it's good to see you too.

999
01:37:12,544 --> 01:37:17,372
Cyn told us about what happened.
It really bites the big one, Tess. Really.

1000
01:37:18,091 --> 01:37:21,045
- We took up a little collection.
- Thanks.

1001
01:37:21,136 --> 01:37:26,925
It's not much. Just enough to go out and get
toasted some night when you really need it.

1002
01:37:27,017 --> 01:37:29,722
Don't say no. We really wanted to.

1003
01:37:29,811 --> 01:37:32,516
And no paying the Con Ed with it.

1004
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:35,766
OK. Thanks.

1005
01:37:36,318 --> 01:37:39,023
So what are you gonna do now, huh?

1006
01:37:39,112 --> 01:37:43,359
You know... Play some golf,
redecorate the country house.

1007
01:37:45,452 --> 01:37:50,280
I don't know. Start all over.
Find ajob, a place to live.

1008
01:37:51,374 --> 01:37:55,704
And just wise up and not take
the whole thing so seriously.

1009
01:37:55,796 --> 01:37:57,872
I'll be OK.

1010
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:05,295
- Bye.
- Bye, sweetie.

1011
01:38:05,388 --> 01:38:07,464
- Thank you.
- Miss you.

1012
01:38:08,809 --> 01:38:11,097
- Good luck.
- Bye, Tess.

1013
01:38:12,145 --> 01:38:14,517
- Don't work too hard.
- Bye, Tess.

1014
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:28,986
Sorry.

1015
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:39,625
- I've been trying to find you.
- Just leave me alone.

1016
01:38:39,714 --> 01:38:44,709
Just one thing. Was you and me
just part of the scheme too?

1017
01:38:45,137 --> 01:38:46,417
No.

1018
01:38:46,513 --> 01:38:50,724
If I'd told you I was just some secretary,
you never would've taken the meeting.

1019
01:38:50,809 --> 01:38:52,220
Think about it.

1020
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:56,355
Maybe you'd have fed me a few drinks and
tried to get me into the sack. End of story.

1021
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:59,013
- That's not true.
- Are you sure about that?

1022
01:38:59,109 --> 01:39:04,150
Can you honestly tell me it wouldn't have
made a difference? Who's fooling who here?

1023
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:07,110
What's this? More stolen files?

1024
01:39:07,909 --> 01:39:10,151
No, it's my stuff from the desk.

1025
01:39:10,245 --> 01:39:14,325
- Your stuff? Now there's a broad term.
- No, it's my stuff.

1026
01:39:14,416 --> 01:39:17,417
Maybe you can fool these guys
with this saint act,

1027
01:39:17,502 --> 01:39:21,796
but do not ever speak to me again
like we don't know what really happened.

1028
01:39:21,882 --> 01:39:26,793
Tess, this is business.
Let's just bury the hatchet, OK?

1029
01:39:27,179 --> 01:39:31,924
You know where you can bury your hatchet?
Now get your bony ass out of my sight.

1030
01:39:32,017 --> 01:39:37,355
And if you really think that I said I loved you
as part of some scheme, then that is pathetic.

1031
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:41,437
- My God. She'll stop at nothing.
- What kind of show are you people running?

1032
01:39:41,526 --> 01:39:45,738
Oren, I'm sorry you've had to see this,
but it means nothing to us.

1033
01:39:47,532 --> 01:39:49,821
Jack, let's get upstairs.

1034
01:39:50,827 --> 01:39:53,069
- Not without her.
- Jack.

1035
01:39:53,163 --> 01:39:55,915
Trainer, are you trying to blow this deal?

1036
01:39:56,583 --> 01:39:59,786
No, sir. I'm trying to make sure
that it gets done right.

1037
01:39:59,878 --> 01:40:03,958
Tess put this deal together.
We shouldn't proceed without her.

1038
01:40:04,049 --> 01:40:08,627
And you shouldn't go letting yourjohnson
make business decisions for you.

1039
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:11,804
I'm not, sir. I'm telling you, she's your man.

1040
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:15,638
- What brings you to that conclusion?
- She said so and I believe her.

1041
01:40:15,727 --> 01:40:19,677
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Now, are you with us or not?

1042
01:40:22,484 --> 01:40:24,891
No.

1043
01:40:24,986 --> 01:40:28,770
Jack, I forgive you. Now get on this elevator.

1044
01:40:30,408 --> 01:40:33,742
- Sorry, Katharine.
- You will be sorry, Jack.

1045
01:40:36,998 --> 01:40:39,952
Ask her to tell you about
the hole in your deal.

1046
01:40:41,169 --> 01:40:44,040
- What hole?
- She's playing games. Let's get going.

1047
01:40:44,131 --> 01:40:46,622
- Fine. Go.
- No. What hole?

1048
01:40:46,842 --> 01:40:48,918
Look.

1049
01:40:49,594 --> 01:40:53,295
The People Page? Now, this is ridiculous.

1050
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:56,640
"Former Miss America Dawn Bixby
has been house-hunting."

1051
01:40:56,726 --> 01:41:00,427
"Seems Dawn and hot, hot, hot
DJ hubby Slim Slicker

1052
01:41:00,522 --> 01:41:03,606
are getting ready to take
a bite out of the Big Apple."

1053
01:41:03,692 --> 01:41:08,069
- So?
- Slim Slicker's one of Metro's major assets.

1054
01:41:08,155 --> 01:41:12,532
Syndicated to all their stations.
The cornerstone of their programming.

1055
01:41:12,617 --> 01:41:15,821
Lose him and Metro's just
real estate with falling ratings.

1056
01:41:15,912 --> 01:41:18,201
And you're not buying it for a write-off.

1057
01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:20,697
Better make sure he's locked in
before they sign.

1058
01:41:20,792 --> 01:41:24,078
Oren, I have this covered. Upstairs. Shall we?

1059
01:41:24,171 --> 01:41:26,128
- Yes.
- Yes.

1060
01:41:26,214 --> 01:41:29,548
Hear the lady out, sir.
There's another elevator.

1061
01:41:37,058 --> 01:41:39,134
You're on.

1062
01:41:42,939 --> 01:41:44,315
OK.

1063
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:50,437
This is Forbes. It's the basic article about how
you were looking to get into broadcasting.

1064
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:55,773
OK, the same day, I'm reading the Post
and there's this item on Bobby Stein,

1065
01:41:55,869 --> 01:42:00,447
the radio guy who does those gross jokes
about Ethiopia and the Betty Ford Center.

1066
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:05,202
Anyway, he's hosting this charity auction -
real blue bloods, and won't that be funny?

1067
01:42:05,295 --> 01:42:09,375
Now I turn the page to the society stuff
and there's a picture of your daughter.

1068
01:42:09,466 --> 01:42:13,084
Nice picture. And she's helping
to organise the charity ball.

1069
01:42:13,178 --> 01:42:17,507
So I started to think Trask, radio. Trask, radio.

1070
01:42:18,016 --> 01:42:21,883
And then I hooked up with Jack,
and he came on board with Metro,

1071
01:42:21,978 --> 01:42:25,264
and... and so now here we are.

1072
01:42:38,411 --> 01:42:41,745
Oren, we really don't have
any more time for fairy tales.

1073
01:42:41,832 --> 01:42:45,117
Miss Parker, let me ask you a question.

1074
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:49,160
How did you come up the idea
for Trask to buy up Metro?

1075
01:42:49,256 --> 01:42:51,544
How did I...?

1076
01:42:52,259 --> 01:42:55,213
Well, let's see. The...

1077
01:42:56,429 --> 01:42:59,929
The impulse. What led you
to put the two together?

1078
01:43:01,977 --> 01:43:06,520
Well, I would have to check my files.
I can't recall exactly the...

1079
01:43:06,606 --> 01:43:10,058
Generally. It's not as if
it was in the mainstream.

1080
01:43:11,736 --> 01:43:14,441
You know, it would have to be the...

1081
01:43:17,325 --> 01:43:20,077
Jack, help me out here.

1082
01:43:24,499 --> 01:43:28,248
Oren, I beg your pardon,
but if you are insinuating...

1083
01:43:28,336 --> 01:43:33,960
Miss Parker, if I were you, I'd go to your office
and take a long last look around.

1084
01:43:34,509 --> 01:43:40,049
Because in about five minutes, I'm going
to see to it that you get the boot but good.

1085
01:43:40,724 --> 01:43:44,342
Oren, this is a simple misunderstanding.
I... You cannot...

1086
01:43:44,436 --> 01:43:46,642
I can and I will.

1087
01:43:46,730 --> 01:43:49,517
Now get your... What did you call it?

1088
01:43:50,192 --> 01:43:52,896
- Bony ass.
- Right.

1089
01:43:52,986 --> 01:43:55,773
...bony ass out of my sight.

1090
01:43:56,114 --> 01:44:01,701
I'm sorry, but I simply
won't stand for that kind of talk.

1091
01:44:03,997 --> 01:44:06,286
Will you excuse me, please?

1092
01:44:17,219 --> 01:44:20,173
Why didn't you tell us all this
in the boardroom that day?

1093
01:44:20,263 --> 01:44:22,968
No one was gonna listen, sir. Not to me.

1094
01:44:23,308 --> 01:44:27,057
You can bend the rules upstairs,
but not while you're trying to get there.

1095
01:44:27,145 --> 01:44:30,810
And someone like me
can't get there without bending the rules.

1096
01:44:30,899 --> 01:44:36,688
You've got a real fire in your belly. Or was
this just a one-time stunt that you pulled?

1097
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:40,943
I have something in my belly,
but I think it's nervous knots.

1098
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:44,910
Are you willing to go out on that limb
every day, working for me?

1099
01:44:44,996 --> 01:44:47,534
- Legitimately?
- Yes, sir.

1100
01:44:47,624 --> 01:44:51,242
- Have to be at the entry level. Any problem?
- No, sir.

1101
01:44:52,003 --> 01:44:55,207
- Gumption, Miss McGill.
- Yes, sir.

1102
01:44:55,298 --> 01:44:57,421
- See you tomorrow.
- OK.

1103
01:44:57,926 --> 01:45:02,469
Trainer, Dwayne. Let's go to my office
and see about Slim whatshisname's contract.

1104
01:45:02,556 --> 01:45:05,047
Be right with you, sir.

1105
01:45:10,689 --> 01:45:13,809
- Way to go, Tess. Way to go.
- Beauty.

1106
01:45:40,427 --> 01:45:43,132
For you. You like it?

1107
01:45:46,766 --> 01:45:50,598
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Milk money.

1108
01:45:52,481 --> 01:45:54,769
Twinkies.

1109
01:45:54,858 --> 01:45:57,645
Pen, pencil, ruler. Apple for the teacher.

1110
01:45:58,403 --> 01:46:04,655
Remember. Play nice with the other kids
and make sure you're home before dark.

1111
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:19,585
Hi. Tess McGill.

1112
01:46:19,674 --> 01:46:21,714
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1113
01:46:21,802 --> 01:46:26,796
The director is out sick today, so she'll
want to see you first thing tomorrow.

1114
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:31,137
Miss Baxter's already up there.
She'll show you the layout.

1115
01:46:31,645 --> 01:46:35,429
- It's all the way at the end of the hall.
- All right. Thank you.

1116
01:46:35,524 --> 01:46:37,600
You're welcome.

1117
01:46:46,910 --> 01:46:49,662
Anybody'll be an improvement
over that terrorist.

1118
01:46:49,746 --> 01:46:52,664
I mean, something semi-human.

1119
01:47:04,553 --> 01:47:07,126
I didn't hear you come in.

1120
01:47:07,222 --> 01:47:09,594
- I'm Alice Baxter.
- Tess McGill.

1121
01:47:10,434 --> 01:47:13,138
I was just using the phone.

1122
01:47:13,937 --> 01:47:16,428
Yes, well, that happens.

1123
01:47:17,524 --> 01:47:20,644
- How about some coffee?
- Sure. Just tell me where.

1124
01:47:20,735 --> 01:47:23,772
No, I'll get it. How?

1125
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,481
Milk and sugar, please.

1126
01:47:26,575 --> 01:47:28,651
Thank you.

1127
01:47:49,931 --> 01:47:52,007
- Miss McGill.
- Yes?

1128
01:47:52,809 --> 01:47:55,680
That's your desk, in there.

1129
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,721
I don't think so.

1130
01:47:58,815 --> 01:48:01,306
Oh, yes. I sit out here.

1131
01:48:02,569 --> 01:48:05,903
I'm sorry. I thought
the secretary would sit out here.

1132
01:48:05,989 --> 01:48:08,694
That's right. I'm the secretary.

1133
01:48:10,452 --> 01:48:13,025
If it's OK, I prefer "assistant".

1134
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:32,135
You've got a 10 o'clock meeting
with Slater from Development-here.

1135
01:48:32,224 --> 01:48:36,435
11 o'clock with Donohue
from Logistics-his office on 23.

1136
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:40,304
And lunch with Mr Trask -
his office downtown, one o'clock.

1137
01:48:41,358 --> 01:48:46,103
It's all right there on the computer.
Just hit shift-S for your schedule.

1138
01:48:53,995 --> 01:48:59,072
When I saw you in here
on the phone with your feet up,

1139
01:48:59,668 --> 01:49:02,159
I figured this was your office.

1140
01:49:03,755 --> 01:49:07,883
I'm sorry about that, Miss McGill.
It won't happen again ever.

1141
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:09,759
It's OK.

1142
01:49:10,929 --> 01:49:15,057
Maybe now would be a good time
to go over what you expect of me.

1143
01:49:20,147 --> 01:49:23,147
I... I expect you to call me Tess.

1144
01:49:24,109 --> 01:49:28,272
I don't expect you to fetch me coffee
unless you're getting some for yourself.

1145
01:49:28,363 --> 01:49:34,484
And the rest we'll just make up
as we go along.

1146
01:49:35,579 --> 01:49:37,655
OK?

1147
01:49:39,958 --> 01:49:42,034
OK.

1148
01:49:43,545 --> 01:49:47,673
- I'll be right outside if you need anything.
- Fine.

1149
01:50:00,061 --> 01:50:01,888
Cyn.

1150
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:04,269
Guess where I am?
