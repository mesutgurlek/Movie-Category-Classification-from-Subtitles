That's the last bottle, OK?
I'm saving it.

How's my hot date for tonight?

00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:51,279
Hmm? Heather?

15
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:53,158
Yeah, I think I remember.

16
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:55,004
Double date? Yeah, why not?

17
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,925
 Yeah, I think I've got
just the guy.

18
00:00:57,967 --> 00:01:00,003
Hang on.
Mark, double date tonight?

19
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:01,924
N... no.

20
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,083
What's she like? Is she sexy?

21
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:07,085
Mark, beggars can't be choosers.
She's an actual woman.

22
00:01:07,127 --> 00:01:09,038
It's too early. I'm not into it.

23
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:10,918
No, I'm still technically married.

24
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:14,164
I'm not safe to be reintroduced
into society yet.

25
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,640
OK, I've got someone.

26
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:19,726
Tell her not to get her hopes up,
but he's a safe pair of hands.

27
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:22,361
Yeah, see you there.
Bye-bye, bye, bye.

28
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:24,204
You're back in the game!

29
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,800
God, no.
No, it's too early, cancel!

30
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:31,441
Call back and cancel.
Tell her the whole story.

31
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:33,478
Although... 

32
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,405
Tell me more about her.
What's she like? Is she sexy?

33
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:38,403
She's not too sexy, is she?

34
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:41,041
She's Paula's friend.
Remember Paula? Tony's sister?

35
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:43,157
Are you sure this isn't going
to be a nightmare encounter?

36
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:44,879
No, Paula's cool.

37
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:47,043
She's cultural.
We're going to see a play tonight.

38
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:48,315
A play

39
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:51,598
I know, but relax. It's all
different now. They've moved on.

40
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:54,719
They use proper actors.
Americans and people off the telly.

41
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:57,884
And they're all based on films,
so it's fine.

42
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:59,599
We might need to tidy up a bit...

43
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:06,803
...and we might have to untape the DVD
and video and TV and Sky remotes.

44
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:10,123
The Megatron? But...

45
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,395
No.

46
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:13,085
It smells wrong.

47
00:02:13,127 --> 00:02:16,836
The Megatron doesn't say
urban free-wheelers.

48
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,355
It says sofa masturbators,

49
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,556
 you know.

50
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:24,121
Here we are.

51
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:27,437
What are you doing?

52
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,955
Friends of the British Museum Magazine.

53
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:33,204
Clearly, I'm not a Johnny Depp,
Tony Parsons hunk of the month.

54
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:35,397
I need my props. I have my rituals.

55

There they are. Heather's the blonde.

00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:47,006
Oh, my God, look at her!

59
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:50,437
She's perfect! I love her, Jez.

60
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:52,523
I don't know if I can do this.

61
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:55,684
You stay, I'm going to go home.
Tell her I love her.

62
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:58,639
Will you keep it together!
Just play it cool.

63
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:03,641
'Maybe she's the one? My marriage
was just a warm-up for the one. '

64
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:05,245
Heather, this is Mark.

65
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:06,276
Um... hi.

66
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:10,366
Hi. 'Jeremy was right -
she is an actual woman. '

67

Shall we get a drink?

68
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:16,242
Um... listen, thanks for
stepping in at short notice.

69
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:20,246
Oh, wow, the Samurai exhibition.
Doesn't it look amazing?

70
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:23,199
Well, I'm no expert but
if it's old and it involves swords,

71
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:25,602
I'm basically interested.

72
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:29,003
I could get us tickets if
that wasn't incredibly forward.

73
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:33,677
I'd love to cos I did a whole
course on it in college,

74
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,002
but I checked, it's all sold out
for the next few weeks.

75
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:38,117
Well, it is to the shit-munchers,

76
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,840
but I'm actually a friend
of the British Museum.

77
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,481
Oh, right, well...
Yeah, that would be great.

78

81
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:55,482
Listen, Jez, there's something I need
to tell you. It's a bit difficult.

82
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,926
Oh, OK...

83
00:03:56,967 --> 00:04:00,084
The other day, I found out...
Well, I was in the clinic and...

84
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:02,960
Basically, I've got a
sexually-transmitted disease.

85
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:05,521
- It wasn't me.
- I didn't say it was.

86
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:09,640
It's chlamydia. I was just telling you
in case you wanted to get tested.

156
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:34,157
'Still, got the phone.
You're never alone with a phone.

157
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:35,435
'Look at that.

158
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:39,116
'No calls. Everyone I know
doesn't want to talk to me.

159
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,442
'Why isn't she texting?

160
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,318
'Maybe she's dead?

161
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:46,120
'Bereaved is better than stood up. '

162
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:50,122
It's actually quite nice to see you,
Jeremy.

163
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:53,079
Yeah. So, I've been getting
in touch with all my exes

164
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,721
because there's something
I need to tell them.

165
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:58,440
But I just thought,
why not turn it into a bit of a date?

166
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:00,842
Yeah? Well, I've got some news, too.

167
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:02,400
Me and Johnson are over.

168
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:06,122
He's looking for someone
more subservient on the internet.

169
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,839
Is he?

170
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:09,366
What a shit!

171
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:11,966
So, what's your news?

172
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:14,396
My news?

173
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:16,756
What is my news?

174
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,275
My news... is that...

175
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:21,238
I've just got this hunch

176
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:24,404
that everything's gonna
turn out OK in Iraq.

177
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:25,641
Iraq?

178
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:29,236
Yeah, everyone seems to have this
massive downer on the whole thing

179
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:32,279
but I say,
"It ain't over till it's over, baby. "

180
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:35,717
So, what shall we have to drink
to celebrate?

181
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,359
Well, a Barolo is always nice.

182
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:38,886
'Shit.

183
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:42,522
'Can't ask how much. Restaurant.

184
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:46,480
'You have to pretend you're
infinitely wealthy, for some reason. OK.

185
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:53,000
'Flicking, looking. If only I knew the
name of any other wine. What's a wine?

186
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:56,403
'Ls the one Hannibal Lecter drinks
real or a joke? '

187
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:58,677
A bottle of Barolo it is.

188
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:00,046
Lovely!

189
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:06,878
'There it is!
Oh, shit. No! 45 quid!

190
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:10,476
'I've just spent 45 quid on wine. '

191
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,960
I'm paying, I assume.

192
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:14,237
<i>Well, you did invite me.</i>

193
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:16,847
Of course.

194
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:21,124
'There's a fiver's worth
right there. '

195
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:25,036
Oh, that is fantastic!

196
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:28,124
This... this is wine.

197
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,635
Yeah, look at what these idiots
are drinking.

198
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:33,281
Look at these dicks. Huh!

199
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:36,797
Obviously, it's not really delicious,
like hot chocolate or Coke,

200
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:38,041
but for wine...

201
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:39,964
Mwah! Brilliant.

202
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:44,205
'Oh, everyone in that restaurant
knew I'd been stood up.

203
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:46,715
<i>'I'd feel better if she had
had an accident.</i>

204
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:50,316
'I could go to the hospital.
I might get to switch off the machine.

205
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:51,959
'Would that be good?

206
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:53,679
'Married one, killed one.

207
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,604
'I'd be a pint-sized Henry Vlll.

00:10:55,647 --> 00:10:56,921
'That's her!

209
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:59,640
'Maybe I should hide.
Actually, fuck it! '

210
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:01,643
Heather! Hello, Heather.

211
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:02,881
Mark?

212
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,076
Mark!

213
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:07,483
Oh, it is so good to see you.

214
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:08,596
Uh-huh?

215
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:12,083
'Oh, yeah, course it is.
I'm just the man you wanted to see. '

216
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:16,279
I'm so sorry. What a day! I lost
my phone and it had your number

217
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:19,558
and also the address of the restaurant,
and I didn't know where...

218
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:21,359
'Almost plausible. '

219
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:25,366
I cycled back this way cos I thought...
Your place is somewhere near here?

220
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:26,886
Oh, right.

221
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:29,202
So what do you think?
A bit late or?

222
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:31,442
'I'm going to have
my pound of date. '

223
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:33,443
No, it's not too late.

224
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:37,116
Let's go for a drink. We were
going to have a date, let's have a date.

225
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:40,842
Great! Is there anywhere nice
around... here?

226
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:44,402
- No.
- Well, it's a bit late to go into town.

227
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:47,086
Look, we're right by my place.

228
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:51,359
We could always have a drink up there
if you didn't think it too weird.

229
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:53,762
It'd be nice to see your place.

230
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:55,365
'She's coming back to my place.

231
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:58,319
'She trusts me. It's still possible
she stood me up,

232
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:01,916
'but she almost definitely doesn't
consider me a physical threat. '

233
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:06,320
I'm really glad
that we did manage to meet up,

234
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,723
cos I don't know what
I'd have done with this, otherwise.

235
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,281
Samurai, The World Of The Warrior!

236
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:15,717
It really is the only book you need
on Samurai culture...

237
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,201
'... that I could find
for under 15 quid. '

238
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:19,760
Oh, Mark, that is thoughtful.

239
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:23,925
'Oh, yeah,
getting kissed by the one! '

240
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:28,802
Oh, look at this,
Jeremy left the bloody door on the...

241
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:30,917
Jeremy!

242
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,036
Hello.

243
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:33,122
Hi.

244
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,885
What are you?

245
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:38,840
- I'm... I'm looking for... Kenny?
- Kenny's not here.

246
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:40,957
Oh. OK, then, I'll just...

247
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:44,556
- No. 'Oh, my God, what am I doing? '
- Can I?

248
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:47,201
I've got asthma!
What the fuck are you doing?!

249
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:50,717
'I'm wrestling with the white
working class. Morse never did this. '

250
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:52,359
Just shut up!

251
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:55,479
'I'm better than Morse! '

252
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:58,325
- Wow, Mark! You totally took him out!
- 'Oh, yeah, baby! '

253
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,244
Yeah, well, my home is my castle.

254
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,357
Look... Get off, I was just...

255
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,399
You were coming back
for what you didn't get last week!

256
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:08,166
That's my bloody watch!
You've got my watch on!

257
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,798
Police, please.
Yes, I've apprehended a burglar.

258
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:16,919
Flat 5, Apollo House,
London Road, Croydon.

259
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:19,959
45 minutes?! But...

260
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:24,239
I'm sitting on him - is that legal?

261
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:25,515
OK.

262
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:29,355
Who needs a Samurai exhibition
when you get a Samurai display?

263
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:31,875
Look, if you want,
we can do this another time.

264
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,964
No, I can't leave you now.
You might need...

265
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:37,646
That's great.
I think I'm OK with him,

266
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:40,759
but it would be good to have
someone else there with a bottle

267
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:43,844
or a spanner to bonk him
on the head with if he tries anything.

268
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:45,400
This is a nice place.

269
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:47,165
Thank you.

270
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:49,437
If she spanners me I'll kick off.

271
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:51,478
It's good to get a foot on the ladder.

272
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:54,439
Plus, I've got pension provision
coming out of my arse.

273
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:55,886
There's wine in the fridge.

274
00:13:55,927 --> 00:14:00,523
'This is turning out pretty well.
This could be a funny family story.

275
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,922
'We met when he sat on a burglar. '

276
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,435
Mark, what are you doing?
Who are you sitting on?

277
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:06,761
It's a burglar!

278
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:08,001
Oh, my God!

279
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,720
I'm not! I got the wrong flat,
I'm looking for Kenny.

280
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,839
I'm asthmatic.
We need money for our meter.

281
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,765
- Oh, the plot thickens.
- He might've got the wrong flat.

282
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:18,559
That's right! Take his side.

283
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,963
You've only known me for 15 years,
whereas he's a pillar of society

284
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:25,795
- Stop sitting on him. You look a dick.
- You didn't see him take him down.

285
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:27,360
- Hi, I'm Heather.
- Hi.

286
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:29,523
Look, Heather, can you watch him?

287
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:32,320
I'll double-lock the door

288
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:37,202
and then we can all go
through into the living room and just

289
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:39,920
all keep an eye on him there, OK?

290
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,797
Oh, guard duty, great vibe.
Just put him in the kitchen

291
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:48,317
with a couple of Garfield's.
What you think he's going to do?

292
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:52,918
I think, Jeremy, that he's going to
try and nick our stuff, all right?

293
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,725
So...

294
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,678
What's going on for you, man?

295
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,922
For God's sake, Jeremy,
don't try to bond.

296
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:04,085
Did you run away from home?
Are you a rent boy and everything?

297
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:06,436
Fuck off, I'm looking for Kenny.

298
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:11,356
Look, let's just try to continue
our evening as if he wasn't here and

299
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:14,956
if he tries to escape,
I'll just have to... take him down.

300
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:17,077
'I've got balls like baked potatoes. '

301
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:20,039
And how would you "take him down",
just out of interest?

302
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,477
With extreme prejudice
or On Her Majesty's Secret Service?

303
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:26,917
Has anyone seen the new
Tom Hanks film with him in the?

304
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,719
Saw it on pirate. It's shit.

305
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,123
Look, shut up!
You are not part of this conversation!

306
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:36,076
Oh, look, this is too weird.

307
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:38,960
Let's lock him away somewhere
until the police arrive.

308
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,397
Good. We're trying to relax.
He's your guest - put him in your room.

309
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:44,881
- He might do a shit in there.
- I'm not gonna shit!

310
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:49,842
Mark, everyone in London is not trying
to do a shit on your possessions. Relax.

311
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:51,525
What's this?

312
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:54,081
'Oh, the Megatron is shrinking
my massive balls. '

313
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:56,595
That... What is?

314
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,478
Did you do that? You're sick!

315
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:00,085
What?

316
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,004
Why don't we tie him up in the bath?

317
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,436
I guess we could
tie him up in the bath but

318
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:06,921
it might feel like
we'd crossed a bit of a line.

319
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,482
Why don't we burn him with cigarettes?
He might tell you where your stuff is.

320
00:16:10,527 --> 00:16:11,960
We are not going to burn him.

321
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:14,760
- Suze, that's horrible!
- She's only brainstorming.

322
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,925
I think the best thing for you is if
we just stick you out on the balcony.

323
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:22,243
Oh, the balcony, you serious?
It's fucking raining.

324
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,243
What about my human rights?

325
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:27,996
There's no human right to be dry.
You have a look for Kenny out there.

326
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:31,244
'That felt good. Maybe I should
join the prison service. '

327
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:35,405
This is quite a weird date, Jeremy. Even
weirder than when we went to Laser Quest

328
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:38,484
- and you tried to hump me in the dark.
- Jeremy.

329
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:41,997
Since when are you on a date
with Big Suze?

330
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:45,005
What about the chlamydia,
didn't she mind?

331
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,844
Er, no. Not really.

332
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:50,038
Oh, my God, you haven't told her!
You're disgusting!

333
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:53,363
According to Johnson,
they're not even definitely broken up.

334
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:55,045
I won't let you do this, Jeremy!

335
00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:57,681
If necessary,
I'll stand physically between you.

336
00:16:57,727 --> 00:16:59,285
Mark...

337
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:02,478
If I have to fuck you to fuck her,
then I will.

338
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:07,163
So you be careful where you stand, OK?

339
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:11,520
- Is he on the phone?
- Oh, God...

340
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:14,081
'Guantanamo is compromised! '

341
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:17,039
Give me that. Who are you phoning?

342
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:21,160
<i>Just calling my mates...
All my mates. They're coming over.</i>

343
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,765
Oh, fucking hell!

344
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:24,399
Let's just get him out of here.

345
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:27,041
No, the police
will be here soon, Jeremy.

346
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,317
Any minute now our door will get
kicked down

347
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,597
by 100 maniacs
with no stake in society.

348
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,842
Is that your idea of a relaxing date?

349
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,526
- We've got to tough it out.
- Fine, you're a knob.

350
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:40,401
Good luck with your civilisation.
I'm barricading myself in my room.

351
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:42,642
Suze!

352
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:47,283
'Great, it's me protecting civilisation
again while Jeremy has sex.

353
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:50,319
'Lf this was the war,
I'd be getting shot by Rommel

354
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:53,245
'while he was in Paris
getting a blow-job from a Nazi. '

355
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:58,202
Sorry it's been such a weird evening.

356
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,282
Memorable, though.

357
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,887
'Maybe I can
raise the temperature a bit? '

358
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:05,761
<i>So... here we are, on bed together.</i>

359
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,320
'Bit too much? '

360
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:11,326
Look at that...

361
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,404
Look how much bigger
my feet are than yours.

362
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:17,285
I'm not boasting, they just are.

363
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,443
'Oh, yeah, now she's getting hot'

364
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:20,715
BANGING ON DOOR

365
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:24,316
Oi! Come on, Mark - hurry up
and open up! Let's have you! 

366
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:28,440
Mark, the barbarians are
at the gate! It's your responsibility!

367
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:31,206
Ignore the banging
and the threats, Heather.

368
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:34,364
Relax and have some cheese.
'Ls cheese relaxing? '

369
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:38,639
They're going to get in and have
us all, Mark. Just let him go, OK?

370
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:43,477
No, Jeremy, that's not
how I roll... You know that.

371
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:46,325
We know he's fuckin' in there.
Let him out, you mug! 

372
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,927
'That little dick!
If they come in here and kill me

373
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:52,118
'before I get to have sex,
I'm going to be so annoyed.

374
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:53,839
'Oh, fuck it! '

375
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,560
I'll let you go,
cos I'm a really nice guy like that,

376
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,246
but promise you won't burgle us again.
We've got a bond.

377
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:05,039
'I think he likes me. '

378
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,842
I'm going to let you go now,
but if you ever come back,

379
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:15,598
then me and my mate
will go mental. OK?

380
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:21,198
'OK, this is good.

381
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:24,398
'He'll probably write a rap
about how amazing I am. '

382
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:27,245
- 'Shit! '
- Hattie's got a massive TV.

383
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:30,518
Give us your TV
or we'll fucking rush you.

384
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,159
'Don't hurt my lovely face! '

385
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:35,961
'God, she's lovely. But
how do I take it to the next level?

386
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,919
'Boast about the size of my hands?

387
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:42,880
'Tell her she might be the one?
What have I got to lose? '

388
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:47,443
Well, it's been fun.
I'm really glad we did meet up, but...

389
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:48,476
Maybe I should...

390
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,483
Yeah, I guess you probably should.

391
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:52,085
But there is the mob,

392
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:57,281
so the mob probably means
you can't actually go just yet.

393
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:58,999
Shall I top you up? 'Thanks, mob. '

394
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:00,036
THUMP

395
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:01,725
 Fuck! Shit! Careful!

396
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,995
 Quick, let's go, boys.

397
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:07,202
What the?!
What's going on, Jeremy?!

398
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,283
He escaped, he overpowered me.
They got in.

399
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:11,283
Stop! Stop, thieves!

400
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:12,680
Fuck off, clean shirt!

401
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:15,878
THEY LAUGH

402
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:22,322
The front door was locked!
You let them in, didn't you, Jeremy?

403
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,006
- No.
- Then how did he open the door?!

404
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,720
Well, maybe you should
chase them down, Mark.

405
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,918
Maybe if your date saw you beating
up a whole gang of children,

406
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:32,286
that would get her hot.

407
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:35,717
'Right, you shit.
It's mutually-assured destruction! '

408
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,600
Suze, I'm afraid
I have to inform you

409
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:42,560
that Jeremy has or may have
a sexually transmitted disease.

410
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:44,882
- I'm sorry I had to tell you...
- Shut up!

411
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,280
Is it AIDS?

412
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:49,478
Of course it's not AIDS.
This isn't the '80s.

413
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:54,555
It's the best STD. Just cute, old,
mostly symptomless chlamydia.

414
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:56,518
And I haven't even definitely...

415
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:59,843
Chlamydia?! When were you
going to tell me, Jeremy?

416
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:05,200
I don't know. Probably...
I was going to tell you, sensitively,

417
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:07,124
during the next little bit of time,

418
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,727
until he just blurted it all out.

419
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,725
Look, Suze, no...! Suze!

420
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,359
Don't go!

421
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,726
You can't go.

422
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:17,246
Mark, I need to go.

423
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:18,766
The police will be here any minute,

424
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:21,605
<i>and I'm not telling them
I let the burglar go. That's your job.</i>

425
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,717
- You're an accessory to the crime.
- Bollocks!

426
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:27,521
Jeremy, if you try anything,
I will take you down. I'm not afraid.

427
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:30,877
Ooh! I can't wait to see this.
What are you going to do?

428
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,639
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

429
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:37,405
Are you putting your hand on me?

430
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:40,166
Are you having a fight with me?
Are you fighting me?

431
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:42,004
I'm doing what I've got to do.

432
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:46,077
- I'm going to go, Mark.
- No, Jeremy.

433
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:48,357
My God, you are!

434
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,126
You are fighting me! This is incredible!

435
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:53,203
You are putting your foot behind me

436
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:55,636
and you're pushing me
down towards the floor!

437
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,996
Finally, you're restraining me!

438
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:02,279
OK, I'm not going to hurt you. I'm just
keeping you here till the police arrive.

439
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:04,636
This is...
Why hasn't this happened before?

440
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:06,917
This is what it's all been
leading towards!

441
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,719
I'm confiscating your keys.

442
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:12,043
Have a good rootle around -
you never know what you might find.

443
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:13,076
Mark, Mark...

444
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:16,597
I'm not sure how much more there is
I can do here, so I might head off.

445
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:18,877
No, no, no, we're having a date.

446
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:20,758
We can still date.
You owe me a date.

447
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,162
We've had our date, Mark.
We've had half an hour date.

448
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:26,040
20 minutes, it's too soon.

449
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:28,840
You can't go yet.
I won't let you go.

450
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:31,526
I think it might take the edge off
the evening if I'm being held hostage!

451
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,957
Look, I wanted to tell you something.

452
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:39,125
Nothing's going to happen. We're not
a good fit. You're a weird guy.

453
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:40,361
<i>He is a weird guy.</i>

454
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:41,999
I tried to let you down gently with
the phone story but

455
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:45,278
now I'm tired and I'm going home.

456
00:22:45,327 --> 00:22:47,318
What did you want to tell me?

457
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,962
I thought that... you might be...
