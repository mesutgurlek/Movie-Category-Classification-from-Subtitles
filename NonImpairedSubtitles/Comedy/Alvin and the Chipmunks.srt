Thats it. I can't take it anymore
I can't. I give up.

00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:14,529
You know, a guys always fooling around.
He can't handle the serious relationship.

24
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:18,562
That's the old Dave. How about we

00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:22,191
Where are the nuts go?

32
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:25,753

We are in the building, Theodore.

33
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:37,436
Hey, did you see

38
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,903
Omestation.. huh?

39
00:05:57,976 --> 00:06:02,281

41
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:35,460
Lets talk about your song, Dave.

42
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:38,915
Well, it's crazy as is sound,
the original inspiration came to me..

43
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:40,913
The song is suck, Dave.

44
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:44,100
What?
- Your song, it's awful.

45
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:45,462
I hate it.

46
00:06:45,536 --> 00:06:47,709
I mean,
whose gonna sing it?

47
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,319
Justin, Fergie.
Not a chance.

48
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:55,581
I need something new, i need something fresh.
- That is new. For next big thing.

49
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:59,345
Dave, we go late back,
alright...

50
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:03,069
We both come along ways since college.
You.. not so much...

51
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:08,982
I want to like that song.
But, you heard it. Not that good.

52
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:10,980
If i wasn't your friend, i said...

53
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:17,700
Dave you go right back out of this office,
and you keep writting music. You will get there someday..

54
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:20,081
but i am your friend,
so i am gonna tell you that...

55
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:27,598
There is no sense in writting song.
That no one is ever.. ever going to sing

56
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,498
Ever?

57
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,034
Excuse me.

58
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:47,153
Can i get some of water?

59
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:49,448
We ran out.

60
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,240
Maybe that way.

61
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:31,497
Dont step on my tail.

62
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:36,690
The last one is the door.

63
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:39,953
I'm in.
- What is this shinning things?

64
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:43,286

Squrrel can't talk.

103
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:15,652
Chipmunks can't talk either.

105
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:22,985
This is not happening.

00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,321

00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:02,702
Alright, here the pitch

We open the group with kids

251
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:08,155
Close up on a little gurl face.
She sad

252
00:27:08,228 --> 00:27:11,994
Ze is verdrietig
- Zo zien onze klanten hun kinderen liever niet.

253
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:15,451
She is be flying a kite.
- I like kite.

254
00:27:15,524 --> 00:27:16,948
Good

255
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:19,291
Ok great
She's flying a kite

256
00:27:19,363 --> 00:27:23,246
She's running with a kite.
She's running out of speed..

257
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:25,588
She is tired.
and lets go of a kite

258
00:27:25,662 --> 00:27:29,467
Oh no. See her face.
Her sad.

259
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,310
But not to sad.

260
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:36,025
Right. So she pull out some energy bar...

261
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,790
My mom.
 Sorry.

262
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:46,709
Hai, mom.
- We have a situation, Dave.

263
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:48,168
Theodore  got inside vacum.

264
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:51,451
Alvin! - Dave help!
- What?

265
00:27:51,525 --> 00:27:56,232
Het was tenminste niet de vuilnisvernietiger.
- Stay calm  - And there go theodore

266
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:58,075
En daar gaat de andere ook.

267
00:27:58,148 --> 00:28:00,188
I can't do this right now . 
Ok?

268
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:05,094
Ik begrijp het volkomen.
Maar even een snelle vraag.

269
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:08,559
Wat vind je van 'n zwembad in huis?

270
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:10,901
Als je mijn huis hebt overspoeld
ben je dood.

271
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:13,158
Staan jullie op straat, begrepen?

272
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:16,615
Moeders.

273
00:28:18,923 --> 00:28:23,190
Waarom kijken we niet samen
even naar de verkoop projecties?

274
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:27,471
Toen ik deze cijfers zag
dacht ik bij mezelf, dit kan nooit.

275
00:28:27,544 --> 00:28:29,909
Maar toen keek ik nog eens.

276
00:28:29,982 --> 00:28:32,436
DE OMVANG VAN THEODORE ZIJN KONT

277
00:28:34,552 --> 00:28:36,822
Dit is Theodores kont?

278
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:39,836
Laten we hier later op terug komen.

279
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:43,696
Tien jaar geleden waren de marktaandelen
voor gezonde voedselrepen...

280
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:46,672
ondenkbaar voor kinderen
tussen de zes en twaalf jaar.

281
00:28:46,744 --> 00:28:51,894
Hoe slim denkt Simon dat die is.
- In tegenstelling hoe slim die echt is.

282
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:54,323
Wie is Simon?

283
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:56,713
Ik deed dit.
- Ga maar verder.

284
00:28:56,786 --> 00:29:00,275
HOE ERG ALVIN STINKT.

285
00:29:03,237 --> 00:29:07,542
Weet je wat,
ik zal mijn kantoor wel ontruimen.

286
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:09,645
Dat klinkt perfect.

287
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,750
Jongens, waar gaat dit over?

288
00:29:21,823 --> 00:29:25,859
Schijnbaar over Theodores kont.
- We hebben gezegd dat we getekend hadden.

289
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:29,806
Op mijn presentatieborden?
Door jullie ben ik ontslagen.

290
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,532
Dat wisten wij niet.

291
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:36,765
Het spijt ons, Dave.
- 't Spijt jullie, geweldig.

292
00:29:36,837 --> 00:29:40,519
Maar met; 't spijt me,
krijg ik mijn baan niet terug, of wel Theodore?

293
00:29:41,177 --> 00:29:44,829
Waarom liggen mijn kleren overal?
- Daar hebben we 't water mee opgedweild.

294
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:46,798
Goed idee, hè?

295
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:50,205
Mijn God Theodore, heb jij daar net...

296
00:29:50,277 --> 00:29:53,959
Het is 'n rozijn, Dave.
- Bewijs het dan maar.

297
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:02,139
Oké, je had me daar.
Ik wil met jullie praten. Waar is Alvin?

298
00:30:02,873 --> 00:30:05,711
Je staat diep bij mij in de schuld.

299
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:19,696
Er is iets nieuws op de markt
en 't heet kloppen.

300
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,500
Kom eruit.
- Ik wacht op de blazers.

301
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:25,534
Eruit!
- Hé, ik ben me aan het douchen.

302
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:29,911
Als ik een lijst zou maken met slechte dagen
dan zou deze bovenaan staan.

303
00:30:29,984 --> 00:30:32,061
En het is nog steeds vroeg.

304
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:34,357
Hou je mondje, Kaleknikker.

305
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,511
Laat ik het jullie zo vertellen, oké.

306
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:41,815
Ik heb geen baan, geen carrière...

307
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:44,887
mijn huis is steeds een beestenboel
Hartelijk dank daarvoor.

308
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:52,021
Hoi Dave, met Claire Wilsonn.
Waarom zei ik net mijn achternaam? Vreemd..

309
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:55,102
Ik ben schijnbaar nerveus
voor het dineetje.

310
00:30:55,174 --> 00:31:01,438
Etentje.
- Ik ga hangen nu. Ik ben er om zeven uur. Doei.

311
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:03,350
Dat is over een half uur.

312
00:31:05,427 --> 00:31:08,879
Wie is Claire?
- Claire is Dave zijn vriendin.

313
00:31:09,153 --> 00:31:13,756
Ze is niet mijn vriendin.
Ze is mijn ex vriendin.

314
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:18,027
Dit is geweldig.

315
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,020
Dave doe rustig. Ga jij nu maar
't eten halen. Wij doen de rest wel.

316
00:31:22,094 --> 00:31:24,056
Waarom geloof ik jullie niet?

317
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:26,859
Bedankt voor je vertrouwen.
Dit doet echt pijn.

318
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:30,575
We zitten in 't zelfde schuitje.
- Ja, als een grote familie.

319
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:34,539
Nee, niet als 'n familie.
- De kok tikt door. Ik zou maar snel zijn.

320
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:36,604
Goed dan.

321
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:57,763
We doen ook kantoren, en toeringbussen.

322
00:31:58,074 --> 00:31:59,615
Wat is dat voor een geur?

323
00:31:59,687 --> 00:32:02,917
Dat is je aftershave.
Voel je je al mannelijk?

324
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,567
Hebben jullie de hele fles
op het tapijt gegooid?

325
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:08,331
Wij noemen het, onze plek markeren.

326
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:11,750
Ik moet toegeven, ik ben verrast
Het ziet er goed uit.

327
00:32:11,822 --> 00:32:15,167
Nou, wij Chipmunks zijn van nature netjes.

328
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,626
Ja, dat kan ik zien.

329
00:32:16,699 --> 00:32:21,080
Wat ruiken die broodstengels toch lekker.
- Ja, hoe laat eten we?

330
00:32:21,153 --> 00:32:26,725
Jongens... hoe moet ik dit vertellen?
Maar het is alleen Claire en mezelf vanavond.

331
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,876
Wacht even Dave, dus we mogen...
- Nee.

332
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:30,489
Zelfs niet als we...
- Nee.

333
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:32,255
Maar wij dachten dat 't...
- En nog eens nee.

334
00:32:32,328 --> 00:32:34,367
Ga naar de andere kamer.
- Alsjeblieft.

335
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,237
Wat een tegenvaller, zeg.

336
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:43,238
Ik wist niet dat je zo goed kon koken
- Het ligt allemaal aan langzaam grillen.

337
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:47,991
Het duurt wat langer
maar de smaak is daardoor wel beter.

338
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,448
Nou, ik ben onder de indruk.

339
00:32:52,411 --> 00:32:55,756
Ik heb je foto’s in de krant gezien.
- Ja, het gaat heel goed.

340
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:57,975
En jij dan, hoe gaat het met jouw baan?

341
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:02,622
Geweldig, doe 't met plezier.

342
00:33:07,004 --> 00:33:09,369
Hoe denk je dat 't gaat?
- Slecht.

343
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:11,693
Ze kussen niet eens met elkaar.

344
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:16,377
Dave heeft een beetje hulp nodig
van de LoveDoctor

345
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:19,671
En zijn assistent.
- Kom terug jij.

346
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:21,753
Weet je, dit is leuk.

347
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:24,864
Twee vrienden, die samen eten
en gezellig samen zijn.

348
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:27,428
Geen druk, niks raars.

349
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:38,765
Dat doet mijn stereo nu altijd,
alsof hij een eigen gedachte heeft.

350
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:40,791
Wat zei je?

351
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:44,640
Niks. Ik was alleen een beetje nerveus
om hierheen te komen.

352
00:33:44,714 --> 00:33:47,866
Niet dat jij zou denken dat dit
een soort van afspraakje was.

353
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:51,006
Een afspraakje?
Nee, hoor.

354
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,346
De bedrading in de meterkast is verouderd.

355
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,726
Je zou dat moeten laten repareren.

356
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,750
Ik heb niemand voor niks nodig.

357
00:34:09,904 --> 00:34:11,934
Oké.

358
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:20,152
Wil je me even excuseren?
Ik ga even in de meterkast kijken.

359
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,411
Ik weet waar jullie mee bezig zijn.
Alvin?

360
00:34:32,483 --> 00:34:34,974
Adem test!
- Waar is...

361
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:38,746
Dave, is alles in orde?

362
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:40,743
Alles is in orde hier.

363
00:34:40,816 --> 00:34:43,969
Waar deed je dat voor?
- Ik probeerde alleen maar te helpen.

364
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,273
Je adem stinkt naar knoflook.

365
00:34:46,346 --> 00:34:49,912
Stop er dan mee.
Jullie verpesten alles.

366
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:54,414
Ik denk dat ik iets in mijn oog heb.

367
00:34:54,486 --> 00:34:56,564
Kom hier, laat me eens kijken.

368
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,675
Ja, dat ziet er geïrriteerd uit.

369
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:02,873
Helemaal rood.
Wat is er gebeurd?

370
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:06,011
Wat was dat?
- Ik dacht dat ik 'n rat zag.

371
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:10,342
'n Rat? - 't Is waarschijnlijk niks.
Laten we verder gaan met eten.

372
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:14,066
Morgen bel ik de verdelger.

373
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:23,003
Nu zijn jullie bij elkaar.
- Wat ben je aan 't doen?

374
00:35:23,076 --> 00:35:25,279
t Is je gelukt, Dave.

375
00:35:25,361 --> 00:35:27,852
Dave laat los.

376
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:30,771
Sorry Claire, alleen...

377
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:34,457
ik ben ontslagen.

378
00:35:34,807 --> 00:35:36,155
Ik had denkelijk
alleen een knuffel nodig.

379
00:35:36,228 --> 00:35:39,112
Waarom heb je dat niet gezegd?
Vertel me wat er gebeurd is.

380
00:35:39,185 --> 00:35:43,336
Dit gaat heel raar klinken.

381
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,679
Geen spelletjes, geen flauwekul.

382
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:50,086
De waarheid?
- Alsjeblieft, ik smeek 't je.

383
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:57,037
Mijn leven wordt gesaboteerd
door pratende Chipmunks.

384
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:05,147
Weet je wat.
- Ik ben echt niet gek.

385
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,750
Je bent niks veranderd.

386
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:14,278
Wacht Claire, ga niet.
Ik kan het uitleggen.

387
00:36:22,577 --> 00:36:25,461
Je hebt niet goed gehandeld, Dave.
Ze wilde je.

388
00:36:25,534 --> 00:36:27,190
Alvin, je helpt zo niet.

389
00:36:27,262 --> 00:36:30,070
Niet zitten mokken, Dave
- Ga weg, laat me met rust.

390
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:34,592
Dave, mag ik 'n koekje?
- Ik zei, laat me met rust.

391
00:36:38,168 --> 00:36:41,129
Lag 't aan mij
of was hij een beetje boos?

392
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:43,394
Even denken?
Ja!

393
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,889
Zijn adem stonk echt naar knoflook.
- Goed gedaan, jongens.

394
00:36:46,962 --> 00:36:48,310
Ideetje!

395
00:36:48,383 --> 00:36:54,100
Wie heeft er geld voor de taxi?
- Geld voor 'n taxi? We hebben niet eens zakken.

396
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:16,841
Lieve jongens,

397
00:37:16,914 --> 00:37:21,326
het spijt me,
maar dit gaat niet zo goed.?

398
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:24,176
Ik wist niet wat ik dacht
toen ik voor jullie wilde zorgen,

399
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:27,402
terwijl ik niet eens
voor mezelf kan zorgen.

400
00:37:27,474 --> 00:37:30,657
Jullie moeten terug
naar jullie echte huis, in het bos.

401
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,123
Dat is het beste voor ons allemaal.

402
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:36,379
Het spijt me dat 't zo moet, maar...

403
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,269
Jongens.

404
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,832
Jongens.

405
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:50,914
Hallo!

406
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,526
Hallo!
- Snel.

407
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,983
Kinderen.

408
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:21,442
Welkom bij Jet Records.

409
00:39:34,196 --> 00:39:38,770
Nieuwe regel: Niet naar buiten na negen
en zeker niet als ik niet weet waarheen.

410
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,420
Was je bezorgd om ons?

411
00:39:41,493 --> 00:39:43,262
Nee, ik wil 't alleen weten.
Meer niet.

412
00:39:43,335 --> 00:39:46,604
Wacht! Als je niet bezorgt was
waarom wil je 't dan weten?

413
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:48,592
Ik moet het weten. Oké?

414
00:40:04,456 --> 00:40:07,293
Sorry, daarvoor.

415
00:40:08,066 --> 00:40:10,028
Sorry.
- Kinderen, hè.

416
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:12,178
Ja, die houden je scherp.
Heb jij ze ook?

417
00:40:12,252 --> 00:40:13,637
Drie jongens.

418
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,596
Sommige dagen zijn weer beter dan andere.

419
00:40:15,669 --> 00:40:21,692
En soms wil je ze in een doos stoppen en die
in het park achterlaten, en snel wegrennen.

420
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,331
Verstop je.

421
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:35,871
Wat moet dit voorstellen, jongens?

422
00:40:35,945 --> 00:40:37,446
Stroopwafels!

423
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,509
Ik kan me dat niet veroorloven.

424
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:42,073
Wat?

425
00:40:42,146 --> 00:40:45,040
Voor 't geval je het nog niet wist,
ik heb geen baan...

426
00:40:53,224 --> 00:40:55,408
Mijn nummer.

427
00:40:55,643 --> 00:40:58,673
Super.
- Ja!

428
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:06,430
Hallo.
- Hé, Dave.

429
00:41:07,087 --> 00:41:09,318
Hoe gaat het
met mijn favoriete tekstschrijver?

430
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:11,545
Ian?
- Heb je het liedje al gehoord?

431
00:41:11,618 --> 00:41:15,117
Ja, daar luister ik nu naar,
maar hoe... en wanneer...

432
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,382
De snelheid van de zaken, lieverd
Zo doe je dat.

433
00:41:17,456 --> 00:41:19,379
Zo gaan we hier te werk.

434
00:41:19,452 --> 00:41:21,952
'n Vriend van mij bij de satellietradio,
heeft 't direct verspreid.

435
00:41:22,024 --> 00:41:27,243
En die videoclip van je kleine mannetjes,
is al 10 miljoen keer aangeklikt op You Tube.

436
00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:31,053
Het is gewoon te gek.
Ik moet er vandoor.

437
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:35,153
Doe de jongens wat kleren aan.
Ze lopen er een beetje raar bij zo.

438
00:41:39,804 --> 00:41:41,873
Je had nog wat te goed, Dave.

439
00:41:42,223 --> 00:41:45,568
Dus dat met die stroopwafels
zit toch snor.

440
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:47,557
Dave?

441
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:22,002
De soep is klaar.

442
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:35,297
Jongens, dat was geweldig
Simon, super.

443
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,908
Dank je wel.
- Theodore, goed gedaan.

444
00:42:37,982 --> 00:42:41,317
Alvin, je was een beetje flauw.
Let daarop.

445
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:43,928
Alvin!

446
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:54,574
Wat vinden jullie ervan?

447
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:56,562
Cool!

448
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:27,206
Oké.

449
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:35,424
Een tandenborstel, hè?
- Oké.

450
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,991
Nee.

451
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,932
Ben je wakker?

452
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,353
Nu wel.

453
00:44:01,426 --> 00:44:03,119
Ik had een nachtmerrie.

454
00:44:03,191 --> 00:44:05,952
Mag ik bij jou slapen?

455
00:44:08,068 --> 00:44:10,300
Je zult het niet eens merken
dat ik er ben.

456
00:44:10,373 --> 00:44:12,796
Oké, maar blijf aan die zijde
van het bed

457
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:14,937
Oké.

458
00:44:29,112 --> 00:44:32,256
Theodore, dat is niet jouw kant
van het bed.

459
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:54,249
Theodore, wordt wakker.

460
00:44:54,322 --> 00:44:57,859
Het is kerstmis.
Alvin, 't is kerstmis.

461
00:44:57,932 --> 00:44:59,702
De dag van kerstmis
werd Dave wakker.

462
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,853
Kom op man, 't is kerstmis.

463
00:45:01,926 --> 00:45:03,388
Wakker worden, slaapkop.

464
00:45:03,462 --> 00:45:07,325
Oh ja, kerstmis.
- Kom nou

465
00:45:07,397 --> 00:45:08,976
Je kunt slapen als je dood bent
- Ik kom eraan.

466
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:11,875
Schiet toch op, pa.
- Pa?

467
00:45:11,948 --> 00:45:14,659
Dave. Ik zei Dave.

468
00:45:14,732 --> 00:45:18,441
Dit wordt vast mijn beste kermis ooit.
- Je moet die van mij als eerste openen, Dave.

469
00:45:18,514 --> 00:45:20,554
Open die van mij eerst.
- Nee, die van mij.

470
00:45:20,626 --> 00:45:24,219
Hebben jullie mij cadeautjes gekocht?
- Natuurlijk.

471
00:45:26,848 --> 00:45:29,089
Oké dan, Simon.

472
00:45:33,471 --> 00:45:37,181
Dit is een...
- Paperclipkompas.

473
00:45:37,254 --> 00:45:39,907
Een paperclipkompas.
Nu zal ik nooit verdwalen.

474
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:42,165
Nu de mijne.

475
00:45:47,891 --> 00:45:49,834
Mijn portemonnee.
- Bevalt het?

476
00:45:49,906 --> 00:45:53,281
Ik wilde je iets geven
watje elke dag kon gebruiken.

477
00:45:53,363 --> 00:45:56,439
En ik gebruik deze nu al tien jaar.

478
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:58,666
Erg slim, Alvin.
Dank je wel.

479
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:01,729
Je gezichtsuitdrukking zegt alles, Dave.

480
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:06,922
Mooi gedaan, Theodore.
Aan Dave.

481
00:46:06,995 --> 00:46:11,684
Eens kijken, er staat:
Prettig kerstfeest, veel liefs, Theodore.

482
00:46:11,757 --> 00:46:15,294
Met daarbij een mooie tekening
van een paar ananassen?

483
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:18,780
Dat zijn geen ananassen
maar onze familie.

484
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:24,962
Luister jongens,
laten we elkaar goed begrijpen...

485
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:27,419
ik ben niet jullie...

486
00:46:27,655 --> 00:46:30,999
je weet wel...
je vader of zo. Oké?

487
00:46:31,072 --> 00:46:34,293
Maar je bent een soort van vader.

488
00:46:35,949 --> 00:46:38,334
Well, not really.

489
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:40,907
I mean, we are friend.
For sure.

490
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,247
I write your musics,
you know, manage yor career...

491
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,590
Make a sweaters.
- Feed us.

492
00:46:46,663 --> 00:46:49,815
Laat ons in je bed slapen
als we nachtmerries hebben.

493
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:52,879
That's what friends do.

494
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:56,421
So.. who want's to open their presents?

495
00:46:56,493 --> 00:46:59,416
Is that kind of question?
- We do

496
00:46:59,488 --> 00:47:02,249
Me.Me.Me.
- Present. Present. Present

497
00:47:02,484 --> 00:47:06,703
I can't wait to open
my first ... envelope.

498
00:47:08,878 --> 00:47:11,896
That's saving bond.
- Cool.

499
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:16,081
You know, In 7 years
you gonna get to  buy something really nice.

500
00:47:16,155 --> 00:47:19,989
You... maybe have any
that you bought 7 years ago?

501
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,418
Alvin, manners.

502
00:47:22,491 --> 00:47:26,633
Thank you, Dave
- Yeah.Thanks, Dave.

503
00:47:29,864 --> 00:47:32,239
Who want presents?
--- Wow

504
00:47:33,973 --> 00:47:36,894
Cool.
Hey. There is plent more will came from.

505
00:47:36,968 --> 00:47:39,459
Bring them all in, Fellas.
-- Oh, Yeah

506
00:47:39,618 --> 00:47:41,886
Jackpot.
- What are you doing?

507
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,554
Take care my boys Dave.
- Oh yeah, that's what i'm talking about.

508
00:47:45,627 --> 00:47:47,494
Raar, waar zijn
jullie cadeautjes gebleven?

509
00:47:47,566 --> 00:47:50,681
Welke is voor mij?
- Die grote zal voor mij zijn, denk ik.

510
00:47:50,753 --> 00:47:52,024
What you get for them?

511
00:47:52,098 --> 00:47:55,903
Saving bond.
- Great, daar droomt elk kind van.

512
00:47:55,976 --> 00:47:58,323
Jullie hebben geluk,
want jullie oom Ian heeft ervoor gezorgd.

513
00:47:58,395 --> 00:48:00,694
Cool.
- Oom Ian?

514
00:48:02,158 --> 00:48:03,890
Is deze voor mij?

515
00:48:03,963 --> 00:48:07,453
Nee voor Simon. Voor Theodore.

516
00:48:08,687 --> 00:48:10,725
En voor Alvin.

517
00:48:10,799 --> 00:48:14,182
Dank je wel kerstman.
- Dit is voor jou.

518
00:48:14,255 --> 00:48:16,045
Je houdt toch van Frans Bauer, hè?

519
00:48:16,117 --> 00:48:17,254
Graag gedaan.

520
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:22,131
Come on guys. Uncle Ian is
gonna have big launch party for the new CD

521
00:48:22,203 --> 00:48:25,778
That right. Friends, paparazzi,
Hollywood hot shoot...

522
00:48:25,851 --> 00:48:29,158
alles erop en eraan,
- Super cool.

523
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:32,499
Dave, you got 1 week
to write a new hit single.

524
00:48:32,572 --> 00:48:35,686
Some fucking fresh, ok?
Peace, i gonna out.

525
00:48:35,759 --> 00:48:37,030
Bye Uncle Ian.
- Merry Christmas.

526
00:48:37,103 --> 00:48:39,872
Al, het is echt kerstmis.

527
00:48:39,945 --> 00:48:42,320
Mayday!
Mayday!

528
00:48:46,088 --> 00:48:50,240
Alright, Settle in. Settle in.
Thank you for coming.

529
00:48:50,313 --> 00:48:52,583
This is very special night.
Tonight

530
00:48:52,655 --> 00:48:58,611
Here are Jet Records. We pride of ourselves.
So. We are gonna bring tomorrow music, today

531
00:48:58,684 --> 00:49:02,105
Oh.. Guess what?
I did it again.

532
00:49:02,178 --> 00:49:05,792
Ladies and gentleman.
Here to sing a new hit single...

533
00:49:05,865 --> 00:49:12,235
Give it up
For Alvin, Simon and Theodore.

534
00:51:49,912 --> 00:51:51,904
Thank you.

535
00:51:51,986 --> 00:51:57,059
Mine if i grab a few pic.
Claire. Not at all. Fire away.

536
00:51:57,131 --> 00:52:02,157
Great. I got a new assignment.
I covering you arrise to temp .

537
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:08,156
This is Alvin, Simon and Theodore.
- Hello, Hai Claire.

538
00:52:08,229 --> 00:52:12,909
You... hot.
- Forget yourself you're actually officially met.

539
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:22,805
I'm sorry about that night,
i really tough, you... - I was insane?.

540
00:52:22,879 --> 00:52:27,874
I totally understand it. Talking Chipmunks
is a lot to take care over dinner.

541
00:52:27,948 --> 00:52:32,310
But, look at you now.
you got your career, promising future..

542
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:36,227
Kids, you like a famiiy.
- Zeg niet waar hij bij is familie...

543
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,491
daar gaat hij van winden.
Hele erge winden.

544
00:52:39,564 --> 00:52:42,832
Dat is niet waar.
- Hij wil geen familie.

545
00:52:42,904 --> 00:52:46,095
Waarom gaan jullie niet spelen
of 't ijsbuffet leegroven. Of zoiets.

546
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:48,114
Vat 't niet persoonlijk op, jongens.

547
00:52:48,186 --> 00:52:50,742
Sommigen weten niet wanneer ze
iets goeds gedaan hebben.

548
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,903
Toch, Dave?

549
00:52:55,577 --> 00:53:00,065
Niet boos worden
maar jij bent hier niet erg goed in.

550
00:53:07,136 --> 00:53:09,320
Wat denk je hiervan?

551
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,977
Wat is dat?
- Het is Alvin.

552
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:15,664
Die lijkt er helemaal niet op.
- Het is een prototype.

553
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:19,803
We gaan er miljoenen van verkopen.
Hij kan ook praten, zeg maar eens iets.

554
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,256
Hallo lelijke kleine Alvin pop
die helemaal niet op Alvin lijkt.

555
00:53:27,257 --> 00:53:28,874
Zie je. Het is helemaal te gek.
Dat was Spaans.

556
00:53:28,947 --> 00:53:30,486
Weet je dat was gewoon raar.

557
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,135
Kom op Dave. We moeten de fanartikelen
van de Chipmunks uitbreiden.

558
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:40,547
Ik bedoel, vergeet de muziek. De muziek
is niks vergeleken tot 't grote geld.

559
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:47,287
Ik heb 't over 'n eigen kledinglijn,
parfum, Chipmunks wijnkoelers...

560
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,263
Ian, het zijn maar kinderen.
- Nee, het zijn ratten.

561
00:53:50,336 --> 00:53:54,718
En ze kunnen ons beiden zo rijk maken.
Laat mij nu gewoon met ze werken.

562
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:58,212
Ik hoor je niet.
De muziek staat te hard.

563
00:53:58,285 --> 00:54:03,349
Wordt niet mijn tegenspeler hierin, Dave.
Ik verlies nooit.

564
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:14,148
Hebben ze hier ook gevulde gehaktballetjes?

565
00:54:14,222 --> 00:54:16,490
Dit zal vast en zeker een suiker
shock worden, maar dat is het waard.

566
00:54:16,563 --> 00:54:21,513
Wat een overheerlijk lekker Turks fruit.

567
00:54:21,594 --> 00:54:24,823
Hè Alster, 't lied was geweldig.

568
00:54:24,897 --> 00:54:27,465
High Five!
- Wat is er gozer?

569
00:54:28,007 --> 00:54:31,947
Ik zie dat jullie ervan genieten.

570
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:35,095
Waar heb ik 't over?
Jullie eten waarschijnlijk altijd zo.

571
00:54:35,169 --> 00:54:37,150
Nou, Dave zegt dat hij
ons niet wil verwennen.

572
00:54:37,223 --> 00:54:41,566
Man, je bent een popster.
't Is de bedoeling dat je verwend wordt.

573
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:44,600
Jullie zouden in limos moeten rijden.
Vliegen in privé-jets.

574
00:54:44,673 --> 00:54:47,979
En jullie zouden elke avond
naar zulke feesten moeten gaan.

575
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:51,128
Echt? Want Dave zegt
dat we onze slaap nodig hebben.

576
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:54,085
Luister Alvin,
dit is moeilijk om te zeggen, maar...

577
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:56,158
ik bedoel, ik moet hier eerlijk over zijn.

578
00:54:56,232 --> 00:55:00,267
Dave houdt me tegen. Ik zou twintig ruggen
per dag voor jullie kunnen verdienen.

579
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,331
Is dat veel?
- Ja.

580
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,832
En dan nog iets. Nee, laat maar.
Nee wacht. Achter jullie rug...

581
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:13,199
noemt Dave jullie... ratten.

582
00:55:14,817 --> 00:55:16,050
Ratten?

583
00:55:16,122 --> 00:55:18,392
Ja, niet normaal, hè?
Maar zit er niet over in.

584
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:27,216
Ik, ik beschouw jullie als familie.
Als je ook maar iets wil, bel je oom Ian maar. Oké?

585
00:55:28,756 --> 00:55:30,748
Goed.
- Doeg.

586
00:55:34,439 --> 00:55:37,611
Kom op man, je rijdt als mijn oma.

587
00:55:37,685 --> 00:55:40,280
Haal je een rolstoel.
Ga aan de kant.

588
00:55:40,354 --> 00:55:43,083
Hè jongens, kijk eens naar mij.

589
00:55:43,157 --> 00:55:45,495
Omhoog en vliegen.

590
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,761
Ik kan je niet helpen, Simon.
Ik heb bijna de leiding.

591
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:55,748
Hè jongens, ik heb een idee
voor een nieuw nummer.

592
00:55:56,290 --> 00:56:01,623
Hallo Dave. - Wat is er hier aan de hand?
Ik had toch gevraagd of jullie wilden schoonmaken.

593
00:56:06,236 --> 00:56:10,118
Wie is dat?
- Oom Ian heeft een huishoudster ingehuurd.

594
00:56:10,191 --> 00:56:12,643
Ze kan ook nog masseren.

595
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:19,661
Kom op man, ga aan de kant lamstraal.
Rijden of parkeren, vriend.

596
00:56:19,733 --> 00:56:22,291
Je houdt me tegen.
- Hoe kom je aan dat spel?

597
00:56:22,364 --> 00:56:26,975
Van oom Ian. Ga aan de kant.
Koop je wat zijwieltjes, vriend.

598
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:30,317
Weet je wat.
Nu is het genoeg geweest.

599
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:33,216
Wat doe je nu?
Ik had bijna mijn hoogste score verbeterd.

600
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,530
Jammer dan.
Waar is Theodore?

601
00:56:39,298 --> 00:56:43,364
Spuug 't uit.
- Echt niet.

602
00:56:44,712 --> 00:56:46,781
Jet Records.

603
00:56:46,863 --> 00:56:50,515
Zo is 't genoeg. Verzamelen.
Allemaal op de bank.

604
00:56:50,588 --> 00:56:53,118
Mogen wij even alleen zijn?

605
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:59,347
Jongens luister,
ik weet dat het moeilijk is...

606
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:04,186
drie maanden geleden zaten jullie nog
ergens in een boom en nu zijn jullie...

607
00:57:04,259 --> 00:57:06,951
belangrijke popsterren.

608
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:12,817
Oké, 't zal wel. Maar ik bedoel, omdat jullie...
- Belangrijke popsterren zijn.

609
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,045
Maar oom Ian zegt dat we altijd
plezier moeten maken.

610
00:57:20,118 --> 00:57:24,069
Weet je wat?
Hij is jullie oom niet.

611
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:29,684
Hij zei ook dat we twintig dollar
per dag zouden moeten verdienen.

612
00:57:29,757 --> 00:57:31,911
Nou jullie verdienen veel meer dan dat...

613
00:57:31,984 --> 00:57:34,829
en omdat ik om jullie geef
spaar ik dat allemaal voor jullie...

614
00:57:34,903 --> 00:57:36,864
net zoals noten sparen voor de winter.

615
00:57:36,937 --> 00:57:38,746
Winters zijn voor losers.

616
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:42,663
En hebben wij hier in dit alles
niks in te brengen?

617
00:57:42,736 --> 00:57:46,426
Waar komt dit allemaal vandaan?
Jullie zijn nog maar kinderen.

618
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:48,769
Kinderen of ratten?

619
00:57:48,842 --> 00:57:50,151
Wat?

620
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:52,724
Oom Ian zegt dat we een soort
van familie voor hem zijn.

621
00:57:52,797 --> 00:57:57,793
Nou als jullie zoveel van oom Ian houden,
en ik niet goed genoeg voor jullie zorg...

622
00:57:57,866 --> 00:58:00,549
ga dan bij oom Ian wonen.

623
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,564
Ben je nog boos op ons?

624
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,695
Lieve jongens.
Het spijt me dat...

625
00:58:30,122 --> 00:58:33,112
jullie zouden terug moeten gaan
naar jullie echte huis in het bos.

626
00:58:47,518 --> 00:58:51,737
Ik zei al Dave, ik verlies nooit.

627
00:59:17,048 --> 00:59:21,574
Jongens welkom in jullie nieuwe huis.

628
00:59:27,186 --> 00:59:30,176
Super. Papa is thuis.

629
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:34,716
Kunnen we hier allemaal mee spelen?
- Natuurlijk, waarom niet?

630
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:38,855
Het is jullie huis.
- Wat zijn de regels hier in huis?

631
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:43,625
Ik heb maar één regel.
Er zijn geen regels.

632
00:59:43,697 --> 00:59:45,881
Cool!

633
00:59:56,178 --> 01:00:00,819
Vier graden naar links.
Zes graden naar rechts.

634
01:00:01,554 --> 01:00:03,584
Vuur!

635
01:00:14,648 --> 01:00:17,601
Ben bereidt om de vuist
van mijn wraak te voelen.

636
01:00:17,682 --> 01:00:19,866
Laat me niet lachen.

637
01:00:32,735 --> 01:00:36,187
Jullie kungfu is geen partij
voor mijn pijlen.

638
01:00:41,913 --> 01:00:46,171
Oké, Simon, kom maar op.
Ik win dit toch.

639
01:00:46,482 --> 01:00:48,598
Hé, geef hier!
- Laat los, Alvin.

640
01:00:48,671 --> 01:00:50,510
Kom op, nu.

641
01:00:52,089 --> 01:00:54,435
Jij bent al geweest.
- Wie zegt dat jij überhaupt mag?

642
01:00:54,508 --> 01:00:56,501
Geef hier.

643
01:01:00,288 --> 01:01:03,777
Jij bent al geweest.
- Dit is van mij.

644
01:01:05,472 --> 01:01:07,963
Ga weg.
- Ik wil nu!

645
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:25,474
Hoe hebben de airbags 't gedaan?
- Theodore, blijf bij het licht weg.

646
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,707
Nog een keer.
- Super!

647
01:01:28,781 --> 01:01:31,203
Zijn jullie hard aan 't spelen?
- Zeker weten.

648
01:01:31,277 --> 01:01:35,158
Goed. Want vanaf morgen
beginnen jullie met hard te werken.

649
01:01:35,231 --> 01:01:37,463
Van kust naar kust,
in vijf dagen tijd.

650
01:01:37,536 --> 01:01:40,938
Volgens Dave is toeren
niks voor een kind.

651
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:44,510
Voor een normaal kind niet, nee,
maar jullie zijn supersterren.

652
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:49,002
Trouwens, Simon doe
deze flauwe bril eens af..

653
01:01:49,075 --> 01:01:54,493
en zet deze moderne bril eens op.

654
01:01:54,567 --> 01:02:00,139
Jemig zeg... - Ze zouden perfect
zijn, als ik er wat mee kon zien.

655
01:02:00,212 --> 01:02:01,636
Je ogen passen zich wel aan.

656
01:02:01,709 --> 01:02:04,354
Kom op, laten we gaan.

657
01:02:59,925 --> 01:03:02,001
Kom op.
Speel met de camera.

658
01:03:02,075 --> 01:03:03,952
Alvin, brede glimlach.

659
01:03:04,302 --> 01:03:06,111
Theodore, kin omhoog.

660
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:09,175
Zo, ja. Goed zo.

661
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:15,088
Laat je kontje zien.
Zo, ja. Goed zo.

662
01:03:21,793 --> 01:03:26,339
Als de Chipmunks van Crunchy Nibbles houden,
dan houden jullie huisdieren daar ook van.

663
01:03:26,747 --> 01:03:28,595
Cut!

664
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:30,860
Daar gaat ie.

665
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:17,259
Stop maar.

666
01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:27,171
Houdt ze lang genoeg wakker tot de goede noot.
- Ben je gek, er zijn 5000 knoppen hier.

667
01:04:30,327 --> 01:04:33,615
Goed jongens, kijk eens
wat oom Ian jullie brengt.

668
01:04:33,688 --> 01:04:35,816
Koffie.

669
01:04:36,032 --> 01:04:39,397
Ik vind toffee heerlijk.
- Nee koffie, Theodore, koffie...

670
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:43,163
't is 'n super cool
nieuw gezond energiedrankje.

671
01:04:43,235 --> 01:04:50,039
Met slagroom en karamel en chocolade.

672
01:04:50,112 --> 01:04:52,105
Geniet ervan.

673
01:04:54,492 --> 01:04:56,793
Dat zou ze wakker moeten houden.

674
01:05:54,615 --> 01:05:58,269
Stop maar! Kom op nou.
We hebben meer power nodig.

675
01:05:58,342 --> 01:06:02,880
We hebben meer gedroogd ijs nodig.
We hebben meer... oké.

676
01:06:02,953 --> 01:06:05,991
We zijn de Chipmunks, verdomme.
- Dit is belachelijk.

677
01:06:06,064 --> 01:06:11,178
Ik voel me een verklede aap. - En om eerlijk te
zijn, die nieuwe nummers klinken niet naar ons.

678
01:06:11,252 --> 01:06:17,133
Weet je wat ik denk, dat de nieuwe richting
perfect is, het gaat allemaal over 't heden.

679
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,851
Dave zei altijd, dat 't om de muziek ging.

680
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:24,587
Nee weet je wat,
Dave is nu niet hier.

681
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:29,033
Maar ik wel.
Geestige oom Ian.

682
01:06:31,268 --> 01:06:34,681
Wat? Wat wilde je zeggen?
Hoe heet je?

683
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:39,088
Taffy? Wat is dat voor een naam?
Wat doe je hier?

684
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:43,238
De choreografie.
- Ik weet niet wat dat is.

685
01:06:43,311 --> 01:06:45,850
Ik dans
- Is dat dansen?

686
01:06:45,923 --> 01:06:49,992
Zeg volgende keer gewoon ik ben de dans.
Ja, hallo?

687
01:06:50,955 --> 01:06:54,523
Wie? Dave Ceville.

688
01:06:54,779 --> 01:06:58,010
Die naam zegt me wel wat
maar wat, weet ik niet meer.

689
01:06:58,083 --> 01:07:01,660
Laat me even met de jongens spreken.
- Ik weet niet of dat 'n goed idee is, Dave.

690
01:07:01,733 --> 01:07:05,078
De jongens zijn nog humeurig
omdat jij hun eruit getrapt hebt.

691
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:08,536
Zo is het niet gegaan
- Ontkenning.

692
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:13,262
Hoe zit dat met die Europese toer?
Neem je ze voor zes maanden mee?

693
01:07:13,334 --> 01:07:16,527
Nee, twaalf als we China
ook aan 't Chipmunken krijgen.

694
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,516
Twaalf?

695
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,903
Ik wilde alleen hallo zeggen en vragen hoe 't ging.
- Het gaat geweldig.

696
01:07:22,976 --> 01:07:28,513
Ze houden van 't leven, ze leven groots.
Zie 't onder ogen Dave, ze zijn verder gegaan.

697
01:07:28,585 --> 01:07:31,318
Ze zijn nu gelukkig.
- Ian, ik wil met ze praten.

698
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:34,969
Geef ze aan de telefoon.
- Ik denk niet dat dat zal gebeuren, Dave...

699
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:39,597
want we beginnen met 'n wereldtournee morgen,
en ze hebben geen extra druk nodig.

700
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,921
We sturen je wel een kaartje.
- Ian, dit kun je niet maken.

701
01:07:41,994 --> 01:07:45,263
Ze zijn er niet klaar voor.
't Zijn nog maar kinderen.

702
01:07:45,337 --> 01:07:48,126
Ik kom naar ze toe.
- Wacht, Dave... ik...

703
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:55,339
Ian?
- Ik kan... je..

704
01:07:58,265 --> 01:08:01,909
Ian, was dat Dave?

705
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:09,621
Ja. En ik moest zeggen
dat 't goed gaat en hij gelukkig is.

706
01:08:09,693 --> 01:08:11,878
Hij is heel erg gelukkig.

707
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:15,912
Komt hij naar de show?

708
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:19,379
Weet je, ik heb hem kaartjes gestuurd...

709
01:08:19,451 --> 01:08:21,722
en hij heeft ze terug gestuurd.

710
01:08:21,796 --> 01:08:26,689
Ja. Ik denk dat die druk is.
Hij zal wel wat beters te doen hebben.

711
01:08:26,829 --> 01:08:29,329
Kom op, waarom die lange harige gezichten?

712
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:32,671
We gaan plezier maken we hebben
een grote show. Weet je wat...

713
01:08:32,745 --> 01:08:36,245
houden jullie van 'n lekkere massage?
Ik weet wel iemand.

714
01:08:36,318 --> 01:08:38,434
Ik bel hem wel even.
Ik ga direct aan de slag.

715
01:08:38,507 --> 01:08:40,884
Hè, kapitein, kom hier.

716
01:08:41,005 --> 01:08:43,889
Luister, Dave Ceville...

717
01:08:43,963 --> 01:08:45,925
onthoud de naam, leer zijn gezicht.

718
01:08:45,998 --> 01:08:51,103
Als hij morgen opdaagt, mag die niet
in de beurt van hun komen. Begrepen?

719
01:09:05,438 --> 01:09:09,544
Oom Ian?
- Wat!

720
01:09:11,893 --> 01:09:14,240
Wat doe jij hier?

721
01:09:14,314 --> 01:09:18,341
Mag ik bij je slapen?
Ik had een nachtmerrie.

722
01:09:19,192 --> 01:09:23,114
Had jij 'n nachtmerrie?
Ik had er ook één.

723
01:09:23,187 --> 01:09:28,339
In mijn nachtmerrie
moest ik 37 dates doen in 42 dagen...

724
01:09:28,412 --> 01:09:31,980
in zestien verschillende landen en...

725
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:38,289
ik moest 121 verschillende radio-interviews doen
in vijf verschillende talen.

726
01:09:38,362 --> 01:09:47,010
Maar weet je wat Theo, als ik mijn ogen
open doe, stopt de nachtmerrie niet.

727
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:51,112
Betekent dat nee?

728
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:22,739
Jongens, ik wil naar huis.

729
01:10:22,812 --> 01:10:24,891
Hoe bedoel je?
Je bent thuis.

730
01:10:24,963 --> 01:10:29,770
Nee, ik bedoel ons echte huis.
Bij Dave.

731
01:10:29,842 --> 01:10:33,803
Maar Theodore, wordt eens wakker...

732
01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:39,328
hij geeft niet meer om ons.
Hij komt niet eens naar de show.

733
01:10:44,556 --> 01:10:47,173
Te moe om te rocken? Nou de Chipmunks
zouden dat wel eens kunnen zijn.

734
01:10:47,246 --> 01:10:51,130
De geruchten van uitputting en stem problemen
gaan de ronde over deze zing giganten.

735
01:10:51,204 --> 01:10:53,549
Komt dit door een teveel
aan stroopwafels?

736
01:10:53,623 --> 01:10:55,357
Of komt 't door hun drukke programma?

737
01:10:55,429 --> 01:10:57,968
Het is moeilijk te zeggen
maar hun manager Ian Hawk...

738
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:03,732
heeft Fox verzekerd dat 't trio hun eerste optreden
zal doen van hun lang verwachte wereldtournee...

739
01:11:03,804 --> 01:11:06,950
in 't Orpheum Theater in Los Angels.

740
01:11:08,683 --> 01:11:10,792
Zo is het genoeg geweest.

741
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:38,990
Jullie drie klinken
alsof jullie met nagels hebben gegorgeld.

742
01:11:45,949 --> 01:11:47,144
En?

743
01:11:47,217 --> 01:11:51,024
Ik kan je allemaal dure benamingen geven
maar het komt erop neer...

744
01:11:51,097 --> 01:11:54,290
dat ze zijn uitgeput.
- Oké, geef ze een spuit of zo...

745
01:11:54,362 --> 01:11:55,942
een zalfje of pil of zoiets.

746
01:11:56,015 --> 01:11:58,814
Ik heb al mijn geld in hun geïnvesteerd.

747
01:11:59,164 --> 01:12:01,819
Ze moeten eens goed uitrusten.

748
01:12:01,892 --> 01:12:06,699
Lang uitrusten?
Oké, prima.

749
01:12:06,772 --> 01:12:09,772
Goed dan, ik ben geen dokter
dus ze krijgen die rust.

750
01:12:09,845 --> 01:12:13,038
Dank je wel, dokter.
Ik zal ervoor zorgen.

751
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:17,369
Ik waardeer 't echt.
Hè dokter, hier Chipmunkmania.

752
01:12:18,757 --> 01:12:20,904
Klop, klop.

753
01:12:21,178 --> 01:12:24,256
Luister jongens,
ik heb net met de dokter gesproken...

754
01:12:24,328 --> 01:12:27,752
en ik vind 't niet goed om jullie in
deze toestand te laten optreden.

755
01:12:27,824 --> 01:12:30,326
Dus je zegt 't optreden af?

756
01:12:30,398 --> 01:12:33,475
Nee, want dan moet ik
het geld teruggeven.

757
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:37,577
Nee, ik heb 't over playbacken.

758
01:12:37,852 --> 01:12:39,892
Is dat niet vals spelen?

759
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:42,985
Nee, dat is geen vals spelen.
Vals spelen mag niet.

760
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:46,059
Nee, dit is gezond.
Alle supersterren doen 't.

761
01:12:46,131 --> 01:12:50,054
Je moet er alleen voor zorgen dat je lippen precies
zo bewegen als we de woorden hebben opgenomen.

762
01:12:50,127 --> 01:12:51,590
Anders zullen de mensen 't zien.

763
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:54,309
Dat we vals spelen.

764
01:12:54,563 --> 01:12:56,065
Nee!

765
01:12:56,139 --> 01:13:01,828
Welke andere keuze hebben we?
- Precies. Daarom heeft hij 'n letter.

766
01:13:01,901 --> 01:13:03,577
Oké, jongens, maak jullie klaar.

767
01:13:03,649 --> 01:13:09,012
En denk eraan, doe 't goed met je
lippen en niemand zal het merken.

768
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:11,385
Ik hou van jullie.

769
01:14:07,288 --> 01:14:11,279
Je hebt toch zeker nog wel één kaartje?
- Sorry.

770
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,995
Neem maar over, Simon.

771
01:14:29,071 --> 01:14:31,342
Geweldig!
- Ja, Chipmunkmania.

772
01:14:31,415 --> 01:14:33,331
Ze zijn super.

773
01:14:39,406 --> 01:14:41,792
Nee, er staat geen Dave Ceville op de lijst.

774
01:14:41,865 --> 01:14:45,327
Geeft niet, ik ben de redacteur
van LA Musicjournal.

775
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,237
Ik dacht 't dus niet.
- Het is oké, hij hoort bij mij.

776
01:14:48,933 --> 01:14:51,311
Hij is mijn assistent.

777
01:14:53,966 --> 01:14:57,458
Dank je, Claire.
- Wat is er aan de hand?

778
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:02,490
Ik probeer de jongens terug te halen maar
Ian probeert me bij hun vandaan te houden.

779
01:15:02,802 --> 01:15:08,023
Je jongens?
- Ik weet dat het raar klinkt.

780
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:09,626
Het klinkt wel goed.

781
01:15:09,699 --> 01:15:15,408
Want na alles wat ik fout gedaan heb,
inclusief met jou... - Dave, je jongens.

782
01:15:15,481 --> 01:15:18,357
We moeten gaan.
- Goed.

783
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:33,196
Je moet iets doen.
Hier is 't pasje.

784
01:15:33,268 --> 01:15:35,808
Hier. Je bent van de pers, weet je nog.

785
01:15:35,881 --> 01:15:37,834
Dank je wel.

786
01:15:42,067 --> 01:15:46,133
Wat is de bedoeling?
- Ik ben 'n fotograaf. Ik heb een perskaart.

787
01:15:55,205 --> 01:15:58,197
Hij is er.
- 't Is Dave.

788
01:16:07,114 --> 01:16:11,114
Wat doe je?
- Ik stuur een berichtje aan onze lieve oom Ian.

789
01:16:11,186 --> 01:16:15,101
Dit lijkt me een goed plan.
- Mij ook!

790
01:16:20,369 --> 01:16:22,745
Kom op, jongens.

791
01:16:23,443 --> 01:16:25,328
Hè, Ian...

792
01:16:25,401 --> 01:16:29,084
kus mijn harige wangen.

793
01:16:29,474 --> 01:16:31,777
Hou maar.

794
01:16:33,014 --> 01:16:35,124
Ga aan de kant, lekker ding.

795
01:16:40,132 --> 01:16:43,252
Ga van mijn drumstel af.

796
01:16:43,326 --> 01:16:46,014
Zijn jullie klaar om te rocken?

797
01:16:46,211 --> 01:16:48,168
Harder, meid.

798
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:02,070
Kom op jongens, we gaan naar huis.

799
01:17:02,143 --> 01:17:04,040
Ga aan de kant.

800
01:17:05,105 --> 01:17:07,291
Laten we gaan.

801
01:17:09,069 --> 01:17:12,025
Pak ze.
- Kijk uit!

802
01:17:15,032 --> 01:17:16,806
Hallo.

803
01:17:16,879 --> 01:17:18,576
Doeg.

804
01:17:18,649 --> 01:17:22,001
Iene, miene, mutte...

805
01:17:22,073 --> 01:17:24,810
jij bent een kluns, omdat je dat bent.

806
01:17:24,883 --> 01:17:27,042
Joepiedepoepie, moeders mooiste.

807
01:17:27,115 --> 01:17:29,148
Pas op voor je knieën.

808
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:31,159
Sorry.
- Kom op, grote knul.

809
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:34,584
Kom dan nog een stukje

810
01:17:34,657 --> 01:17:37,189
Kom op.
Ja, daar.

811
01:17:39,312 --> 01:17:41,500
Dat zal lekker voelen morgenvroeg.

812
01:17:43,466 --> 01:17:46,425
Jongens.
- Dave!

813
01:17:47,046 --> 01:17:49,695
Jij gaat nergens heen.

814
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:52,399
Wat doe je?
- Zet ons neer.

815
01:17:52,472 --> 01:17:56,998
Laat me los. Jullie kunnen beter je frans ophalen,
want jullie gaan vanavond nog naar Parijs.

816
01:17:57,071 --> 01:17:58,593
Ik heb net mijn staart laten doen.

817
01:17:58,667 --> 01:18:00,326
Nee, wacht.
- Hier, zet maar bij mijn spullen neer.

818
01:18:00,398 --> 01:18:02,788
Laat ons hier uit.

819
01:18:02,861 --> 01:18:06,444
Ian, ze willen niet meer.
Laat ze gewoon gaan.

820
01:18:06,517 --> 01:18:10,792
Maar die vent is net weg.
Had dat vijf seconden eerder gezegd.

821
01:18:10,865 --> 01:18:12,705
Kom terug.

822
01:18:12,943 --> 01:18:17,334
Ian, ze hebben 'n echt leven nodig.
Niet dit.

823
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:19,527
Trouwens, ze hebben net
't concert verpest...

824
01:18:19,599 --> 01:18:23,171
als 't bekend wordt
komt niemand kijken.

825
01:18:23,793 --> 01:18:29,599
Dave, 't zijn Chipmunks die praten.
De mensen komen wel.

826
01:18:29,796 --> 01:18:32,176
Jongens, kom mee.

827
01:18:43,763 --> 01:18:48,577
Niemand krijgt ons levend te pakken.
- Dat hebben ze net gedaan, Alvin.

828
01:18:48,651 --> 01:18:50,616
Het is bij wijze van spreken, Simon.

829
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:54,954
In plaats van mij te bekritiseren, probeer een
plan te bedenken om ons hieruit te krijgen.

830
01:19:06,929 --> 01:19:09,211
Ga.

831
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:19,889
Sneller.

832
01:19:26,244 --> 01:19:29,355
Sneller Dave, je raakt hem kwijt.

833
01:19:38,981 --> 01:19:42,408
Hoe komen jullie...
- We zijn pratende Chipmunks, Dave.

834
01:19:42,482 --> 01:19:46,785
We kunnen makkelijk uit 'n kattenbench komen.
Heel gemakkelijk zelfs.

835
01:19:46,946 --> 01:19:49,556
Je kwam ons halen.

836
01:19:49,909 --> 01:19:54,030
Natuurlijk kwam ik terug.
We zijn familie.

837
01:19:54,103 --> 01:19:56,761
Heilige Noten.
- Wat?

838
01:19:56,835 --> 01:20:00,560
Begin ik door te draaien
of zei hij net familie?

839
01:20:01,221 --> 01:20:07,766
Ik weet 't.
Maar ik heb jullie echt gemist.

840
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,527
Ik heb jou ook gemist, Dave

841
01:20:11,687 --> 01:20:16,886
Ik ook. En Alvin ook.
Hij is alleen te cool om 't toe te geven.

842
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:19,993
Ja, te macho.

843
01:20:21,076 --> 01:20:23,812
Ik heb je ook gemist.

844
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,737
Sorry, ik had wat in mijn keel zitten.

845
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:30,546
Ik zei, ik heb je ook gemist.

846
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:32,584
Hoe dan ook. Wie zijn jullie
om mij te veroordelen.

847
01:20:32,658 --> 01:20:36,241
Weet je wat.
Ik heb mijn vriend Dave gemist.

848
01:20:36,315 --> 01:20:38,011
Ik zal 't van de daken schreeuwen.

849
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:43,233
Ik ben niet bang, en schaam me er niet voor.
Ik hou van je, Dave.

850
01:20:45,817 --> 01:20:47,659
Kom hier.

851
01:20:50,088 --> 01:20:52,633
Dave?
- Ja, Alvin?

852
01:20:52,705 --> 01:20:55,327
Mag ik nu sturen?
Alsjeblieft.

853
01:20:55,399 --> 01:20:58,751
Ik heb altijd al eens de ruitenwisser
willen bedienen. - En ik de claxon.

854
01:20:58,824 --> 01:21:01,164
Ga jullie gang, jongens.

855
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,177
Ik ben een goede toeteraar.
- Bewaar ook wat voor ons, man.

856
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:08,100
Kom op Dave, sneller.
- Niet met jou achter 't stuur.

857
01:21:08,174 --> 01:21:11,371
Dave, je rijdt als een oud vrouwtje.
- Zo is 't wel genoeg, Alvin.

858
01:21:11,444 --> 01:21:14,681
Guess what..are being awesome?
-- Alvin, enough is enough

859
01:21:14,754 --> 01:21:17,478
Hello Dave,
your boys.

860
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:24,493
Hey, If you guys behave,
maybe i will let you call me uncle Ian again

861
01:21:24,565 --> 01:21:26,676
Deal?

862
01:21:45,498 --> 01:21:48,378
Nooooooooooooo!

863
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:02,461
Hei.
- Come on in.

864
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,549
Hello Claire.
- Hello Balerinna.

865
01:22:05,623 --> 01:22:08,165
Hai guys.
- I hope you like toaster waffles.

866
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:12,311
And for the traditional ,
A add a little bubbles.

867
01:22:22,129 --> 01:22:24,239
Not gonna say it.

868
01:22:25,477 --> 01:22:27,511
Goeie God.

869
01:22:28,095 --> 01:22:31,743
Still not gonna say it?
- Nop.

870
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:41,171
I'm gonna say it.
Alvin!!!!
