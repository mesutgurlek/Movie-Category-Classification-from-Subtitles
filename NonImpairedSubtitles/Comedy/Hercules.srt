1
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:21,446
Long ago, in the far away land
of ancient Greece...

2
00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:24,081
there was a golden age
of powerful gods...

3
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:26,846
and extraordinary heroes.

4
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:29,879
And the greatest and strongest
of all these heroes...

5
00:00:29,927 --> 00:00:32,395
was the mighty Hercules.

6
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:35,166
But what is the measure
of a true hero?

7
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:37,596
That is what our story is...

8
00:00:37,647 --> 00:00:39,126
Will you listen to him?

9
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:41,886
He's makin' the story sound
like some Greek tragedy.

10
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:43,155
Lighten up, dude.

11
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:45,482
We'll take it
from here, darling.

12
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:48,439
You go, girl.

13
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:51,206
We are the Muses...

14
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:54,364
goddesses of the arts
and proclaimers of heroes.

15
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:56,079
Heroes like Hercules.

16
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:58,038
Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules."

17
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:00,317
I'd like to make some sweet
music with him...

18
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:03,086
Our story actually begins...

19
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:07,200
long before Hercules,
many eons ago

20
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,806
Back when the world was new

21
00:01:11,847 --> 00:01:14,520
The planet Earth was
down on its luck

22
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:19,482
And everywhere gigantic brutes
called Titans ran amok

23
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:23,316
It was a nasty place

24
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:26,200
There was a mess
wherever you stepped

25
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:27,680
Where chaos reigned

26
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:30,844
and the earthquakes and
volcanos never slept

27
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:32,525
Say it, girlfriend!

28
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:33,966
And then along came Zeus

29
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:36,760
- He hurled his thunderbolt
- He zapped

30
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:38,559
Locked those suckers in a vault

31
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:40,165
They're trapped

32
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:43,802
And on his own,
stopped chaos in its tracks

33
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:45,405
And that's the gospel truth

34
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:49,838
The guy was too "Type A"
to just relax

35
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:51,081
And that's
the world's first dish

36
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:52,685
Yeah, baby.

37
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:55,639
Zeus tamed the globe
while still in his youth

38
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:58,281
Though, honey,
it may seem impossible

39
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,558
That's the gospel truth

40
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:03,802
On Mount Olympus, life was neat

41
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:06,122
And smooth as sweet vermouth

42
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:10,046
Although, honey,
it may seem impossible

43
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:16,196
That's the gospel truth

44
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,037
Hercules!

45
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,357
Behave yourself.

46
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:04,603
Oh, look at this.

47
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:06,319
Look how cute he is.

48
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:15,485
He's strong like his dad, hmm?

49
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:17,324
Excuse me!
Hot stuff coming through!

50
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:20,165
Excuse me. One side, Ares.

51
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:23,165
Why, Hermes, they're lovely.

52
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:25,516
Yeah, you know, I had Orpheus
do the arrangement.

53
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,558
Isn't that too nutty?

54
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,199
Fabulous party.
You know, I haven't seen...

55
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:32,398
this much love in a room since
Narcissus discovered himself.

56
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,720
Dear, keep those away
from the baby.

57
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,997
He won't hurt himself.

58
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:41,765
Let the kid have a little fun.

59
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:54,164
On behalf of my son,
I want to thank you all...

60
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:57,085
for your wonderful gifts!

61
00:03:57,127 --> 00:03:58,799
What about our gift, dear?

62
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,326
Well, let's see here.

63
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:03,325
We'll take... yes.
A little cirrus...

64
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:06,359
and a touch of nimbostratus...

65
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:09,797
and a dash of cumulus.

66
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:19,443
His name is Pegasus,
and he's all yours, son.

67
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,082
Mind his head.

68
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,322
He's so tiny.

69
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,283
My boy.

70
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:44,603
My little Hercules.

71
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:46,717
How sentimental.

72
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,197
You know, I haven't
been this choked up...

73
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:53,125
since I got a hunk of moussaka
caught in my throat!

74
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:57,204
So is this an audience
or a mosaic?

75
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:59,636
Hey, how you doin'?
Lookin' good. Nice dress.

76
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:02,042
So, Hades, you finally made it.

77
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:03,964
How are things
in the underworld?

78
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:05,486
Well, they're just fine.

79
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:06,755
You know... a little dark,
a little gloomy.

80
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,037
And, as always,
full of dead people.

81
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:12,124
What are you gonna do?
There's the little sunspot.

82
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,239
Little snootchie.
And here is a sucker...

83
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:17,801
for the little sucker, eh?
Here you go. Ya just...

84
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:24,037
Powerful little tyke.

85
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:25,805
Come on, Hades.
Don't be such a stiff.

86
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,678
Join the celebration!

87
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,001
Love to, babe...

88
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:32,561
but unlike you gods
lounging about up here...

89
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:35,075
I regrettably have
a full-time gig...

90
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,563
that you, by the way, so
charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.

91
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:41,724
So... can't.
Love to, but can't.

92
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:44,679
You ought to slow down.
You'll work yourself to death.

93
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:48,443
Work yourself to death!

94
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,118
I kill myself!

95
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:55,637
If only. If only.

96
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,006
If there's one god...

97
00:05:57,047 --> 00:05:59,925
you don't want to get
steamed up, it's Hades.

98
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:02,561
'Cause he had an evil plan.

99
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:07,078
He ran the underworld

100
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:10,676
But thought the dead were
dull and uncouth

101
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:14,117
He was as mean
as he was ruthless

102
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,919
And that's the gospel truth

103
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:22,637
He had a plan
to shake things up

104
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:31,482
And that's the gospel truth

105
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:38,282
Pain!

106
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:40,887
Coming, your most
lugubriousness.

107
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:46,878
Panic!

108
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:48,485
I'm sorry. I can handle it!

109
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:58,520
- Pain!
- And Panic!

110
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,603
Reporting for duty!

111
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:01,921
Fine, fine, fine.

112
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:04,162
Just let me know the instant
the Fates arrive.

113
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:05,686
They're here.

114
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,639
What? The Fates are here,
and you didn't tell me?

115
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:14,957
We are worms!
Worthless worms!

116
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:18,556
Memo to me, memo to me.
Maim you after my meeting.

117
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:26,562
Darling, hold that
mortal's thread of life...

118
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:28,996
good and tight.

119
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:34,799
Incoming!

120
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,717
Ladies! I am so sorry that I'm...

121
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:47,758
- Late!
- We knew you would be.

122
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:49,957
We know everything.

123
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:51,998
- Past...
- Present...

124
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:53,878
And future.

125
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:56,964
Indoor plumbing...
it's gonna be big.

126
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:58,201
Great, great.
Anyway, see, ladies...

127
00:07:58,247 --> 00:07:59,521
I was at this party,
and I lost track of...

128
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:02,877
- We know!
- Yeah. I know... you know.

129
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:07,205
So here's the deal:
Zeus, Mr High And Mighty...

130
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:10,239
Mr "Hey, You, Get Off
of My Cloud," now he has...

131
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:13,484
- A bouncing baby brat.
- We know!

132
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:16,200
I know... you know.
I know. I got it.

133
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,636
I got the concept.
So let me just ask:

134
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,166
Is this kid gonna mess up

135
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:22,437
my hostile takeover bid,
or what? What do you think?

136
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:24,364
Oh, no, you don't.

137
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:27,558
We're not supposed to reveal
the future.

138
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,121
Wait. I'm sorry.
Time out. Can l...

139
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,919
Can I ask you a question,
by the way? Are you...

140
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:33,002
Did you cut your hair
or something?

141
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,400
You look fabulous.

142
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,039
I mean, you look like a Fate
worse than death.

143
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:42,363
- Oh, gross!
- It's blinkin'!

144
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:48,002
Ladies, please. My fate...

145
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:50,163
is in your lovely hands.

146
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:52,806
All right.

147
00:08:55,607 --> 00:09:02,479
In 18 years precisely,
the planets will align...

148
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:06,759
- ever so nicely.
- Ay, verse. Oy.

149
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:09,401
The time to act
will be at hand.

150
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:13,565
Unleash the Titans,
your monstrous band.

151
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,165
Good, good.

152
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:19,997
Then the once-proud Zeus
will finally fall...

153
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:26,236
and you, Hades, will rule all!

154
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:28,847
Yes! Hades rules!

155
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:33,005
- A word of caution to this tale.
- Excuse me?

156
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:38,167
Should Hercules fight,
you will fail.

157
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:44,277
What?

158
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:47,046
OK, fine, fine.
I'm cool. I'm fine.

159
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,444
Pain? Panic?

160
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,125
Got a little riddle for ya.

161
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,284
How do you kill a god?

162
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:56,885
I do not know!

163
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:58,679
You can't.
They're immortal?

164
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:00,922
Bingo! They're immortal.

165
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:05,085
So, first you got to turn
the little sunspot...

166
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:06,924
mortal.

167
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:35,843
- What?
- What is it?

168
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,241
The baby!

169
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:55,640
No!

170
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:59,441
Now we did it! Zeus is gonna
use us for target practice!

171
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:01,603
Just hang onto the kid, Panic.

172
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:08,405
Hurry! Let's just kill the kid
and get it over with, OK?

173
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:12,963
Here you go, kid. A little
Grecian formula.

174
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,726
Look at that! He's... changing.

175
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,086
Can we do it now?

176
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:19,766
No, no, no. He has to drink
the whole potion.

177
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:20,762
Every last drop.

178
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:23,037
Who's there?

179
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,676
Alcmene, over here.

180
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:34,561
Oh, you poor thing.

181
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,484
- Oh, don't cry.
- Is anybody there?

182
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:37,596
Now?

183
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,040
Oh. Well, he must have
been abandoned.

184
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:45,726
Amphitryon, for so many years...

185
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:48,884
we've prayed to the gods
to bless us with a child.

186
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:50,997
Perhaps they've answered
our prayers

187
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,799
Perhaps they have.

188
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:55,964
"Hercules"?

189
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:15,518
Help, help, help!

190
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,001
Hades is gonna kill us when
he finds out what happened.

191
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,607
You mean, if he finds out.

192
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:23,081
Of course he's gonna f...

193
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:25,516
lf. If is good.

194
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,639
It was tragic.

195
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:31,360
Zeus led all the gods
on a frantic search.

196
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:33,477
But by the time
they found the baby...

197
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:35,404
it was too late.

198
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:39,998
Young Herc was mortal now

199
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:44,120
But since he did not
drink the last drop

200
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,727
He still retained
his godlike strength

201
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,327
So thank his lucky stars

202
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,164
Tell it, girl.

203
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:54,438
But Zeus and Hera wept

204
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:59,483
Because their son could
never come home

205
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,280
They'd have to watch
their precious baby

206
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:06,718
Grow up from afar

207
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:11,079
Though Hades' horrid plan

208
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:14,881
Was hatched before Herc
cut his first tooth

209
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,476
The boy grew stronger
every day

210
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:22,406
And that's the gospel truth

211
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:30,206
The gospel truth

212
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:42,240
Hercules, slow down!

213
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,156
Look out!

214
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:49,006
Sorry, guys.

215
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,277
- Hey, watch where you're goin'.
- Sunday driver!

216
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:57,637
Thanks, son.

217
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:59,518
When old Penelope twisted
her ankle back there...

218
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:00,795
I thought we were done for.

219
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:01,962
No problem, Pop.

220
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,838
Don't unload just yet.

221
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:06,003
First, I have to finagle
with Phideas.

222
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:10,555
Sorry, Penelope.

223
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:13,804
Now, Hercules, this time,
please just...

224
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:15,724
I know.

225
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,644
Stay by the cart.

226
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:20,679
That's my boy.

227
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:26,078
Oh, my goodness. Whoa!

228
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:28,561
Careful!

229
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,996
- Why, thank you.
- No problem.

230
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:32,446
Why, Hercules!

231
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:34,602
It's you!

232
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:35,796
Let me help you with that.

233
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:37,519
No, no, I got it!

234
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,842
I'm fine.
You just run along.

235
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:41,764
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

236
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:43,718
Absolutely.

237
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,958
Give it here!

238
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,486
Hey, you need an extra guy?

239
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:54,762
Sorry, Herc.

240
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:57,321
We already got five...

241
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,358
and we want to keep it
an even number.

242
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:00,965
Wait a second.
Five isn't an even...

243
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:02,918
- See ya, Herc.
- What a geek!

244
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,366
Destructo Boy.

245
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:06,045
Maybe we should
call him "Jerkules."

246
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,005
Heads up!

247
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,241
I got it!

248
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:17,720
No! Stop!

249
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,395
It's OK.

250
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:42,879
- Son!
- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!

251
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,645
Oh, no!

252
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:55,165
Watch out!

253
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,925
Nice catch, Jerkules.

254
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:15,401
Son...

255
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:20,316
This is the last straw,
Amphitryon!

256
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:22,403
That boy is a menace!

257
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:25,325
He's too dangerous
to be around normal people!

258
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:29,036
He didn't mean any harm.
He's just a kid.

259
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:32,966
He just can't control
his strength.

260
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:37,398
I'm warning you.
You keep that...

261
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,324
freak away from here!

262
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,119
Freak! Yeah, go away!

263
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:56,041
Son, you shouldn't let...

264
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:58,203
those things they said back
there get to you.

265
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:00,807
But Pop, they're right.
I am a freak.

266
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:03,441
I try to fit in.
I really do.

267
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,603
I just can't.

268
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:10,038
Sometimes... I feel like...

269
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:13,397
like I really don't
belong here...

270
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:17,838
like I'm supposed to be...
someplace else.

271
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,798
Hercules, son...

272
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:22,407
I know it doesn't
make any sense.

273
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:34,795
I have often dreamed

274
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,122
Of a far off place

275
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:42,605
Where a great, warm welcome
will be waiting for me

276
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:44,842
Where the crowds will cheer

277
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:47,447
When they see my face

278
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:53,881
And a voice keeps sayin'
this is where I'm meant to be

279
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:56,646
I will find my way

280
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:58,803
I can go the distance

281
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:01,566
I'll be there someday

282
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:04,041
If I can be strong

283
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:06,476
I know every mile

284
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:10,486
Will be worth my while

285
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:17,126
I would go most anywhere
to feel like I

286
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:21,126
Belong

287
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:27,283
Hercules, there's something
your mother and I...

288
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:30,558
have been meaning to tell ya.

289
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:34,964
But if you found me,
then where did I come from?

290
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:37,646
Why was I left here?

291
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:41,999
This was around your neck
when we found you.

292
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:46,086
It's the symbol of the gods.

293
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:48,083
This is it!
Don't you see?

294
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,560
Maybe they have the answers!

295
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:51,996
I'll go to the temple
of Zeus and...

296
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:58,844
Ma, Pop, you're
the greatest parents...

297
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,003
anyone could have, but...

298
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:04,039
I gotta know.

299
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:24,605
I am on my way

300
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:26,638
I can go the distance

301
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:29,406
I don't care how far

302
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:31,642
Somehow, I'll be strong

303
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:34,485
I know every mile

304
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,200
Will be worth my while

305
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:40,364
I would go most anywhere

306
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:46,516
To find where I belong

307
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:10,682
Oh, mighty Zeus, please,
hear me and answer my prayer.

308
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:13,844
I need to know: Who am I?

309
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,321
Where do I belong?

310
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:30,682
My boy.

311
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:33,366
My little Hercules.

312
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:38,235
Hold on, kiddo!

313
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:40,278
What's your hurry?
After all these years...

314
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:43,524
is this the kind of hello
you give your father?

315
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:45,683
Father?

316
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:48,924
Didn't know you had
a famous father, did you?

317
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:51,561
Surprise!

318
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:53,677
Look how you've grown.

319
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:56,446
Why, you've got your mother's
beautiful eyes...

320
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,557
and my strong chin.

321
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,326
I don't understand.

322
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:05,280
If you're my father,
that would make me a...

323
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:09,878
A god.

324
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:11,997
Hey, you wanted answers,
and by thunder...

325
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:14,481
you're old enough now
to know the truth.

326
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:16,040
But why did you
leave me on earth?

327
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:18,078
Didn't you want me?

328
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:19,480
Of course we did.

329
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:22,644
Your mother and I loved you
with all our hearts.

330
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:25,838
Someone stole you from us
and turned you mortal...

331
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:29,118
and only gods can live
on Mount Olympus.

332
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,044
And you can't do a thing?

333
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:33,078
I can't, Hercules, but you can.

334
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:36,119
Really? What?
I'll do anything.

335
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:37,998
Hercules, if you can
prove yourself...

336
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,366
a true hero on earth...

337
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:41,523
your godhood will be restored!

338
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,035
A true hero. Great!

339
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:47,716
Exactly how do you
become a true hero?

340
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:50,122
First, you must seek out
Philoctetes...

341
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,078
the trainer of heroes.

342
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:54,846
Seek out Philoctetes.
Right. I'll...

343
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:57,082
Hold your horses!

344
00:21:57,127 --> 00:22:00,483
Which reminds me.

345
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,837
You probably don't
remember Pegasus...

346
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:10,560
but you two go way back, son.

347
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:20,004
Pegasus!

348
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,003
He's a magnificent horse...

349
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:24,686
with the brain of a bird.

350
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,196
I'll find Philoctetes
and become a true hero.

351
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,158
That's the spirit!

352
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:32,686
I won't let you down, Father!

353
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,762
Good luck, son.

354
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:42,602
I will beat the odds

355
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:44,558
I can go the distance

356
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:46,916
I will face the world

357
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:49,356
Fearless, proud and strong

358
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:51,238
I will please the gods

359
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,198
I can go the distance

360
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,841
Till I find my hero's welcome

361
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:59,277
Right where I

362
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:11,364
Belong

363
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:37,919
You sure this is
the right place?

364
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:51,117
What's the matter, little guy?
You stuck?

365
00:23:52,487 --> 00:23:53,681
Butt out, buddy!

366
00:23:55,287 --> 00:23:57,164
Girls! Stop! Come back!

367
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:00,796
Geez!

368
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:02,326
Wait!

369
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,437
Oh, nymphs!

370
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:07,160
They can't keep
their hands off me.

371
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,244
What's the matter?
You never seen a satyr before?

372
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:15,846
Can you help us?

373
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,277
We're looking for someone
called Philoctetes.

374
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,204
Call me Phil.

375
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,727
Boy, am I glad to meet you!
I'm Hercules.

376
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,564
And this is Pegasus.

377
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:31,358
Animals! Disgusting!

378
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,284
I need your help.

379
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:35,443
I want to become a hero,
a true hero.

380
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:38,686
Sorry, kid. Can't help ya.

381
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,763
Wait!

382
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:42,035
Sorry.

383
00:24:42,087 --> 00:24:46,524
- Why not?
- Two words: I am retired.

384
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:49,445
Look, I gotta do this.

385
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,239
Haven't you ever had a dream...

386
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:54,882
something you wanted so bad
you'd do anything?

387
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:58,118
Kid, come inside.

388
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,283
I want to show you something.

389
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:10,520
Watch it! That was part
of the mast of the Argo.

390
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,444
The Argo?

391
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:15,957
Who do you think taught Jason
how to sail? Cleopatra?

392
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:18,396
I trained all those
would-be heroes.

393
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:23,123
Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.
A lot of "yeuseus."

394
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:25,806
And every single one
of those bums let me down...

395
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:27,724
flatter than a discus.

396
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:29,883
None of 'em could
go the distance.

397
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:33,317
And then there was Achilles.

398
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,278
Now, there was a guy
who had it all...

399
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,204
the build, the foot speed.

400
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:41,604
He could jab, he could take
a hit, he could keep on comin'.

401
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:44,241
But that furshlugginer heel
of his!

402
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:47,404
He barely gets nicked there
once and... kaboom!

403
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:48,960
He's history.

404
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:52,924
Yeah, I had a dream once.

405
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:54,036
I dreamed I was gonna train...

406
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:56,203
the greatest hero
there ever was.

407
00:25:56,247 --> 00:26:00,286
So great, the gods would hang
a picture of him in the stars...

408
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:01,840
all across the sky...

409
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:05,436
and people would say,
"That's Phil's boy."

410
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:07,478
That's right.

411
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:09,438
But dreams are for rookies.

412
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,443
A guy can only take
so much disappointment.

413
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,557
But I'm different
than those other guys, Phil!

414
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:14,881
I can go the distance.

415
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:16,997
Come on. I'll show you.

416
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:19,242
Geez! You don't give up, do ya?

417
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,800
Watch this.

418
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:27,163
Holy Hera.

419
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:30,438
You know, maybe if l... No!
Snap out of it!

420
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:32,398
I'm too old to get mixed up
in this stuff again.

421
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:34,324
But if I don't become
a true hero...

422
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,801
I'll never be able to rejoin
my father, Zeus.

423
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:40,317
Hold it!
Zeus is your father, right?

424
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:45,797
Zeus. The big guy.
He's your daddy.

425
00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:48,839
Mr Lightning Bolts! Read me
a book, would ya, Da-da?

426
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:52,320
"Once upon a time"!

427
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:53,641
It's the truth!

428
00:26:53,687 --> 00:26:54,836
Please!

429
00:26:57,687 --> 00:27:00,121
So you wanna be a hero, kid

430
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:02,761
Well, whoop-de-do

431
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:04,843
I have been
around the block before

432
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:07,196
With blockheads just like you

433
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:09,238
Each and every one
a disappointment

434
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:12,962
Pain for which
there ain't no ointment

435
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,645
So much for excuses

436
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:16,439
Though a kid of Zeus is

437
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:19,763
Askin' me to jump into the fray

438
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:22,526
My answer is two words

439
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:26,804
OK.

440
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,963
- You mean you'll do it?
- You win.

441
00:27:29,007 --> 00:27:31,441
- You won't be sorry, Phil.
- Oh, gods.

442
00:27:31,487 --> 00:27:32,681
So when do we start?
Can we start now?

443
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:35,525
Oy, vay.

444
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,206
I'd given up hope
that someone would come

445
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,124
Along

446
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:42,635
A fella who'd ring the bell
for once

447
00:27:42,687 --> 00:27:44,643
Not the gong

448
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:46,882
The kind who wins trophies

449
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:49,316
Won't settle for low fees

450
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,756
At least semipro fees

451
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:54,082
But, no
I get the greenhorn

452
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:55,526
I've been out to pasture, pal

453
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:58,365
My ambition gone

454
00:27:58,407 --> 00:28:03,003
Content to spend lazy days
and to graze my lawn

455
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:05,402
But you need an advisor

456
00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:07,722
A satyr, but wiser

457
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:10,839
A good merchandiser and... whoa!

458
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:12,479
There goes my ulcer

459
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:17,043
I'm down to one last hope
and I hope it's you

460
00:28:17,087 --> 00:28:21,603
Though, kid, you're not exactly
a dream come true

461
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:23,842
I trained enough turkeys

462
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:25,957
Who never came through

463
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:29,716
You're my one last hope
So you'll have to do

464
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:33,601
Rule #6: When rescuing
a damsel...

465
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:35,638
always handle with care.

466
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:43,162
Rule #95, kid: Concentrate!

467
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:48,919
Rule #96: Aim!

468
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:51,800
Demigods have faced the odds

469
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:54,077
And ended up a mockery

470
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:55,958
Don't believe the stories

471
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:58,919
That you read
on all the crockery

472
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:03,404
To be a true hero, kid,
is a dying art

473
00:29:03,447 --> 00:29:05,961
Like paintin' a masterpiece

474
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:08,043
It's a work of heart

475
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:10,317
It takes more than sinew

476
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,676
Comes down to what's in you

477
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:16,322
You have to continue to grow

478
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:18,517
Now, that's more like it!

479
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:20,956
I'm down to one last shot

480
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:24,522
And my last high note

481
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:29,687
Before that blasted underworld
gets my goat

482
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:31,638
My dreams are on you, kid

483
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,598
Go make 'em come true

484
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,603
Climb that uphill slope

485
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:37,763
Keep pushin' that envelope

486
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,684
You're my one last hope

487
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:46,644
And, kid, it's up to you

488
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:52,922
Did you see that?

489
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,686
Next stop, Olympus.

490
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,082
All right,
just take it easy, champ.

491
00:29:58,127 --> 00:30:00,163
I am ready. I want to
get off this island.

492
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:02,357
I want to see battles
and monsters.

493
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:04,602
Rescue some damsels.

494
00:30:04,647 --> 00:30:06,717
You know, heroic stuff.

495
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:10,077
- Well...
- Aw, come on! Phil!

496
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:13,437
Well, OK. You want a road test?
Saddle up, kid.

497
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:15,921
We're going to Thebes!

498
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:19,516
- So what's in Thebes?
- A lot of problems.

499
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,525
It's a big, tough town. Good
place to start buildin' a rep.

500
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:28,761
Sounds like your basic D.I. D...
damsel in distress.

501
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:37,681
Not so fast, sweetheart.

502
00:30:37,727 --> 00:30:40,605
I swear, Nessus.
Put me down or I'll...

503
00:30:41,647 --> 00:30:43,558
I like 'em fiery!

504
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:45,757
Now, remember, kid.

505
00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:47,160
First, analyse the situation.

506
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,437
Don't just barrel in there
without thinking.

507
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:53,805
He's losin' points for this!

508
00:30:53,847 --> 00:30:55,963
- You don't know what you're...
- Halt!

509
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:01,286
Step aside, two legs.

510
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:04,558
Pardon me, my good sir.

511
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:05,756
I'll have to ask you...

512
00:31:05,807 --> 00:31:06,842
to release that young...

513
00:31:06,887 --> 00:31:09,685
- Keep movin', junior.
- Lady.

514
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:13,197
But you... aren't you
a damsel in distress?

515
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,284
I'm a damsel.
I'm in distress.

516
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:19,239
I can handle this.
Have a nice day.

517
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:22,396
Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be...

518
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,199
too close to the situation
to realize...

519
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:29,203
What are you doin'?
Get your sword!

520
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:30,600
Sword. Right.

521
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:33,798
Rule #15: A hero is only
as good as his weapon!

522
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:44,323
Hold it! Hold on!
He's gotta do it on his own.

523
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:47,359
Come on, kid! Concentrate!

524
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:48,965
Use your head!

525
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,840
All right! Not bad, kid!

526
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:01,640
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but not bad.

527
00:32:04,847 --> 00:32:07,361
Gee, miss.
I'm really sorry.

528
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:08,635
That was dumb.

529
00:32:11,607 --> 00:32:13,086
Excuse me.

530
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:21,478
Nice work! Excelente!

531
00:32:21,527 --> 00:32:23,438
Is Wonderboy here for real?

532
00:32:23,487 --> 00:32:25,557
What are you talkin' about?
Of course he's real.

533
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:32,396
And by the way, sweet cheeks,
I'm real too.

534
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:12,439
- How was that, Phil?
- Rein it in, rookie.

535
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:14,364
You can get away with mistakes
like those...

536
00:33:14,407 --> 00:33:17,365
in the minor decathlons,
but this is the big leagues!

537
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:19,762
At least I beat him,
didn't I?

538
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:21,638
Next time, don't let
your guard down...

539
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:23,245
because of a pair
of big goo-goo eyes!

540
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:25,926
D-oh! It's like
I keep tellin' ya.

541
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:28,765
You gotta stay focused,
and... you...

542
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:40,646
Are you all right, Miss...

543
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,837
Megara. My friends call me Meg.

544
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,764
At least, they would
if I had any friends.

545
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:46,604
So did they give you a name...

546
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:49,207
along with all those
rippling pectorals?

547
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:55,601
Are you always this articulate?

548
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:58,559
Hercules. My name is Hercules.

549
00:33:58,607 --> 00:34:02,725
I think I prefer Wonderboy.

550
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:04,280
So...

551
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:06,887
how'd you get mixed up
with the...

552
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:09,122
Pinhead with hooves?
Well, you know how men are.

553
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:10,566
They think that
"no" means "yes"...

554
00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:11,960
and "get lost" means
"take me. I'm yours."

555
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:17,686
Don't worry. Shorty here can
explain it to ya later.

556
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:21,276
Well, thanks for everything,
Herc.

557
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,921
It's been a real slice.

558
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:26,720
Wait! Can we give you a ride?

559
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:33,606
I don't think your pinto
likes me very much.

560
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:36,480
Pegasus? Don't be silly.

561
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:37,721
He'd be more than happy to...

562
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:43,360
I'll be all right.
I'm a big, tough girl.

563
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:47,036
I tie my own sandals
and everything.

564
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,157
Bye-bye, Wonderboy.

565
00:34:52,647 --> 00:34:55,878
She's something.
Isn't she, Phil?

566
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:58,236
She's really something.

567
00:34:58,287 --> 00:35:00,164
A real pain in the patella!

568
00:35:00,207 --> 00:35:02,926
Earth to Herc! Come in, Herc!
Come in, Herc!

569
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,719
We got a job to do, remember?

570
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:07,599
Thebes is still waitin'.

571
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,684
Yeah. I know.

572
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:22,761
How cute.

573
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:25,401
A couple of rodents
looking for a theme park.

574
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:27,403
Who you callin' a rodent,
sister?

575
00:35:27,447 --> 00:35:30,280
- I'm a bunny!
- And I'm his gopher.

576
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:33,997
I thought I smelled a rat.

577
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,685
Speak of the devil.

578
00:35:37,727 --> 00:35:39,126
Meg, my little flower,
my little bird...

579
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,635
my little nut, Meg.

580
00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:43,564
What exactly happened here?

581
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:45,404
I thought you were gonna
persuade the river guardian...

582
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:46,960
to join my team
for the uprising...

583
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:49,885
and here I am, kind of
river guardian-less.

584
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:51,406
I gave it my best shot...

585
00:35:51,447 --> 00:35:53,881
but he made me an offer
I had to refuse.

586
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:56,157
Fine. So, instead of subtracting
two years from your sentence...

587
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:58,357
hey, I'm gonna add two on, OK?

588
00:35:58,407 --> 00:35:59,522
Give that your best shot.

589
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:00,602
Look, it wasn't my fault.

590
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:03,161
It was this wonderboy, Hercules.

591
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:06,677
Hercules? Why does that name
ring a bell?

592
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:09,480
I don't know.
Maybe we owe him money?

593
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:12,599
What was that name again?

594
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:16,084
He comes on with this big,
innocent farm boy routine...

595
00:36:16,127 --> 00:36:17,958
but I could see through that
in a Peloponnesian minute.

596
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:19,804
Wait a minute.
Wasn't Hercules...

597
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,678
the name of that kid
we were supposed to...

598
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:23,957
Oh, my gods!

599
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:25,804
Run for it!

600
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:28,486
So you took care of him, huh?

601
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:30,483
"Dead as a door nail."

602
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:33,360
Weren't those your exact words?

603
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:35,284
This might be
a different Hercules.

604
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:38,842
I mean, Hercules is
a very popular name nowadays!

605
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:40,286
Remember, like,
a few years ago...

606
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:42,204
every other boy was named
Jason...

607
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:45,125
and the girls were all
named Brittany?

608
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:47,920
I'm about to rearrange
the cosmos...

609
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:51,676
and the one schlemiel
who can louse it up...

610
00:36:51,727 --> 00:36:55,925
is waltzing around in the woods!

611
00:36:57,527 --> 00:37:01,042
Wait, big guy.

612
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:02,679
We can still cut in
on his waltzing.

613
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:04,922
That's right! And at least
we made him mortal.

614
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:06,559
That's a good thing.

615
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:07,960
Didn't we?

616
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,365
Fortunately
for the three of you...

617
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:14,922
we still have time to correct
this rather egregious oversight.

618
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:18,562
And this time, no foul-ups.

619
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:25,526
Is that all one town?

620
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,478
One town, a million troubles.

621
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:29,483
The one and only Thebes.

622
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:31,722
The Big Olive itself.

623
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:35,077
If you can make it there,
you can make it anywhere.

624
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:42,645
Stick with me, kid.

625
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:46,043
This city is a dangerous place.

626
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:47,486
Look where you're goin',
numbskull!

627
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:49,404
Hey, I'm walkin' here!

628
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:52,280
You see what I mean?
I'm tellin' you... wackos.

629
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:55,558
Pita bread. Pita bread.
Get your pita bread here.

630
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,201
- Hey, Mack.
- Whoa!

631
00:37:58,247 --> 00:38:00,203
You wanna buy a sundial?

632
00:38:00,247 --> 00:38:02,522
He's not interested, all right?
Come on, kid.

633
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:05,445
The end is coming!
Can't you feel it?

634
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:08,001
Yes. Thank you for the info.

635
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:10,117
We'll ponder that for awhile.
Just stare at the sidewalk.

636
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,044
Come on. Don't make eye contact.

637
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:13,679
People here are nuts.

638
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:15,604
That's because they live
in a city of turmoil.

639
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:19,879
Trust me, kid. You're gonna be
just what the doctor ordered.

640
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:24,205
It was tragic! We lost
everything in the fire.

641
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:26,920
Everything... except
old Snowball here.

642
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:31,046
Now, were the fires before
or after the earthquake?

643
00:38:31,087 --> 00:38:33,043
They were after the earthquake.
I remember.

644
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:34,805
But before the flood.

645
00:38:34,847 --> 00:38:37,964
Don't even get me started
on the crime rate.

646
00:38:38,007 --> 00:38:40,282
Thebes has certainly
gone downhill

647
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:43,239
- in a hurry.
- Tell me about it.

648
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,164
It seems like every time
I turn around...

649
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,323
there's some new monster
wreaking havoc and l...

650
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,404
All we need now is
a plague of locusts.

651
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:55,480
That's it! I'm movin' to Sparta!

652
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:56,960
Excuse me.

653
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,844
It...

654
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:03,482
seems to me that what
you folks need is a hero.

655
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:06,564
Yeah, and who are you?

656
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:10,717
I'm Hercules, and...

657
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,122
I happen to be a hero.

658
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:15,442
Is that so?

659
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:16,636
Some hero!

660
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,678
Have you ever saved
a town before?

661
00:39:18,727 --> 00:39:20,877
No, not exactly, but l...

662
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:23,361
Have you ever reversed
a natural disaster?

663
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:25,284
Well, no.

664
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:28,603
Listen to this. He's just
another chariot chaser.

665
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:30,877
- This we need.
- That's a laugh.

666
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:32,360
Don't you pea brains get it?

667
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:35,558
This kid is the genuine article.

668
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:39,566
Isn't that the goat-man
who trained Achilles?

669
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:41,962
Watch it, pal.

670
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:45,841
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, nice job on those heels!

671
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:48,765
Ya missed a spot!

672
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:50,559
I got your heel right here!

673
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:52,837
I'll wipe that stupid grin off
your face! You...

674
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:54,764
Hey, Phil! Take it easy.

675
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:58,526
What are you, crazy?

676
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:02,003
Young man, we need
a professional hero...

677
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:04,641
not an amateur.

678
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:07,406
Well, wait. Stop!

679
00:40:11,047 --> 00:40:13,766
How am I supposed
to prove myself a hero...

680
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:15,843
if nobody will give me a chance?

681
00:40:15,887 --> 00:40:17,878
You'll get your chance.
You just need some kind...

682
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:19,758
of catastrophe or disaster.

683
00:40:19,807 --> 00:40:21,718
Please.

684
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:24,839
Help! Please! There's been
a terrible accident!

685
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:27,200
Speakin' of disasters.

686
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:29,807
Wonderboy! Hercules!

687
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:31,803
- Thank goodness!
- What's wrong?

688
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,077
Outside of town,
two little boys.

689
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:35,560
They were playing in the gorge.

690
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:37,996
There was this rock slide,
a terrible rock slide.

691
00:40:38,047 --> 00:40:40,766
- They're trapped!
- Kids? Trapped?

692
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:42,399
Phil, this is great!

693
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:44,039
You're really choked up
about this, aren't ya?

694
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:46,647
- Come on!
- No, l... You don't under...

695
00:40:46,687 --> 00:40:49,645
I have this terrible fear
of heights!

696
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:56,040
I'm right behind ya, kid!

697
00:40:57,447 --> 00:40:59,358
I'm way behind ya, kid.

698
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:01,477
I got a fur wedgie.

699
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,878
- Are you OK?
- I'll be fine.

700
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:12,043
Just get me down
before I ruin the upholstery.

701
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:13,759
Help! I can't breathe!

702
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,126
Hurry!

703
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:17,158
- Get us out!
- We're suffocating!

704
00:41:19,007 --> 00:41:21,567
Somebody call IX-l-I!

705
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:23,279
Easy, fellas.
You'll be all right.

706
00:41:23,327 --> 00:41:24,965
We can't last much longer!

707
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:28,397
Get us out
before we get crushed!

708
00:41:45,247 --> 00:41:47,841
- How you boys doin'?
- We're OK now.

709
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:51,436
Jeepers, mister.
You're really strong.

710
00:41:51,487 --> 00:41:54,638
Well, try to be a little more
careful next time, OK, kids?

711
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:57,076
We sure will.

712
00:42:01,807 --> 00:42:03,684
A stirring performance, boys.

713
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:05,160
I was really moved.

714
00:42:06,687 --> 00:42:08,996
"Jeepers, mister"?

715
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:12,244
I was going for innocence.

716
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:16,166
And, hey, two thumbs way, way up
for our leading lady.

717
00:42:16,207 --> 00:42:18,277
What a dish. What a doll.

718
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,204
Get outta there, you big lug,
while you still can.

719
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:23,163
Phil, I did great.

720
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,641
They even applauded... sort of.

721
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:29,162
I hate to burst
your bubble, kid...

722
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:30,799
but that ain't applause.

723
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:40,757
Phil? What do you call
that thing?

724
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:45,597
Two words: Am-scray!

725
00:42:47,727 --> 00:42:52,517
Let's get ready to rumble!

726
00:42:58,087 --> 00:43:00,362
That's it. Dance around!

727
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:02,125
Watch the teeth.

728
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:03,646
Keep movin'. Come on.

729
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:05,086
Lead with your left!

730
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:06,560
Your other left!

731
00:43:58,647 --> 00:44:00,126
All right!

732
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:02,044
You're bad! OK!

733
00:44:02,087 --> 00:44:05,875
See, Phil?
That wasn't so hard.

734
00:44:05,927 --> 00:44:08,600
Kid. How many horns do ya see?

735
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:10,365
Six?

736
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:13,126
Close enough.
Let's get you cleaned up.

737
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:20,005
Guys, relax.

738
00:44:20,047 --> 00:44:21,924
It's only half-time.

739
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:26,758
That doesn't sound good.

740
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,680
Definitely not good!

741
00:45:03,487 --> 00:45:06,445
Will you forget
the head-slicing thing?

742
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:16,520
Phil, I don't think we covered
this one in basic training!

743
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,565
My favourite part of the game:

744
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:34,965
Sudden death.

745
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:58,963
There goes another one.

746
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:01,237
Just like Achilles.

747
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:05,118
Game...

748
00:46:05,167 --> 00:46:08,716
set... match.

749
00:46:30,807 --> 00:46:33,560
Phil, you gotta admit.

750
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:35,677
That was pretty heroic.

751
00:46:35,727 --> 00:46:40,243
Ya did it, kid!
You won by a landslide!

752
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:46,398
Hades mad.

753
00:46:47,527 --> 00:46:50,564
Well, what do ya know?

754
00:46:53,487 --> 00:46:57,685
From that day forward, our boy
Hercules could do no wrong.

755
00:46:57,727 --> 00:47:01,322
He was so hot,
steam looked cool.

756
00:47:04,607 --> 00:47:07,167
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll

757
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:10,005
Person of the week
in every Greek opinion poll

758
00:47:10,047 --> 00:47:12,800
- What a pro
- Herc could stop a show

759
00:47:12,847 --> 00:47:15,600
Point him at a monster
and you're talkin' S.R.O.

760
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:18,400
- He was a no one
- A zero, zero

761
00:47:18,447 --> 00:47:21,325
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero

762
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:24,040
Here was a kid
with his act down pat

763
00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:26,885
Zero to hero in no time flat

764
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,155
Zero to hero

765
00:47:28,207 --> 00:47:29,560
Just like that

766
00:47:29,607 --> 00:47:32,440
When he smiled
the girls went wild

767
00:47:32,487 --> 00:47:34,955
With oohs and aahs

768
00:47:35,007 --> 00:47:37,567
And they slapped his face
on every vase

769
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:40,644
On every "vahse"

770
00:47:40,687 --> 00:47:43,247
From appearance fees
and royalties

771
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:45,847
Our Herc had cash to burn

772
00:47:45,887 --> 00:47:49,277
Now nouveau riche and famous

773
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:52,080
He could tell you what's
a Grecian urn

774
00:47:52,127 --> 00:47:54,846
Say amen
There he goes again

775
00:47:54,887 --> 00:47:57,526
- Sweet and undefeated
- And an awesome ten for ten

776
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:00,035
Folks lined up
just to watch him flex

777
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:03,284
And this perfect package
packed a pair of pretty pecs

778
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,080
Hercie, he comes, he sees,
he conquers

779
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:08,721
Honey, the crowds were
goin' bonkers

780
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:11,361
He showed the moxie
Brains and spunk

781
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:14,444
From zero to hero
A major hunk

782
00:48:14,487 --> 00:48:16,876
Zero to hero
And who'd have thunk

783
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:22,278
Who put the glad in gladiator?

784
00:48:22,327 --> 00:48:23,965
Hercules

785
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:26,441
Who's darin' deeds are
great theatre

786
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:27,966
Hercules

787
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:29,884
- Isn't he bold
- No one braver

788
00:48:29,927 --> 00:48:31,997
- Is he sweet
- Our favourite flavour

789
00:48:32,047 --> 00:48:34,117
- Hercules
- My man.

790
00:48:38,287 --> 00:48:41,438
Look at my Hercules

791
00:48:41,487 --> 00:48:43,443
Yeah, yeah, yeah

792
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,717
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll

793
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:48,235
Undefeated
Riding high

794
00:48:48,287 --> 00:48:51,279
- And the nicest guy.
- Not conceited

795
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:53,318
- He was a nothing
- Zero, zero

796
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:55,198
- Now he's a honcho
- He's our hero

797
00:48:55,247 --> 00:48:58,205
He hit the heights
at breakneck speed

798
00:48:58,247 --> 00:48:59,441
From zero to hero

799
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:02,404
Herc is a hero

800
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:07,316
Now he's a hero

801
00:49:07,367 --> 00:49:09,085
Yes, indeed

802
00:49:12,127 --> 00:49:13,321
Pull!

803
00:49:16,447 --> 00:49:19,200
Nice shootin', Rex.

804
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,726
I can't believe this guy.

805
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:22,120
I throw everything
I've got at him...

806
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,635
and it doesn't even...

807
00:49:24,687 --> 00:49:28,123
What are those?

808
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:30,044
I don't know.

809
00:49:30,087 --> 00:49:32,317
I thought they looked
kinda dashing.

810
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:35,484
I've got 24 hours
to get rid of this bozo...

811
00:49:35,527 --> 00:49:37,722
or the entire scheme
I've been setting up...

812
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:41,316
for eighteen years
goes up in smoke...

813
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:46,441
and you are wearing
his merchandise!

814
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:54,521
Thirsty?

815
00:50:05,287 --> 00:50:07,243
Looks like your game's over.

816
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:09,517
Wonderboy is hitting
every curve you throw at him.

817
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:16,759
I wonder if maybe
I haven't been throwing...

818
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:22,040
the right curves at him,
Meg, my sweet.

819
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:24,726
Don't even go there.

820
00:50:24,767 --> 00:50:26,598
See, he's gotta have
a weakness...

821
00:50:26,647 --> 00:50:28,524
because everybody's
got a weakness.

822
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,842
I mean, for what? Pandora,
it was the box thing.

823
00:50:30,887 --> 00:50:33,481
For the Trojans, hey.
They bet on the wrong horse, OK?

824
00:50:33,527 --> 00:50:36,246
We simply need to find out
Wonderboy's.

825
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:38,596
I've done my part.
Get your little imps...

826
00:50:38,647 --> 00:50:40,365
They couldn't
handle him as a baby.

827
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:43,046
I need somebody who can...
handle him as a man.

828
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:44,839
Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.

829
00:50:44,887 --> 00:50:47,003
Well, you know, that's good
because that's what got you...

830
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:49,720
into this jam in the first
place, isn't it?

831
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:52,361
You sold your soul to me
to save your boyfriend's life.

832
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:54,841
And how does
this creep thank you?

833
00:50:54,887 --> 00:50:58,004
By running off with some babe.

834
00:50:58,047 --> 00:50:59,958
He hurt you real bad,
didn't he, Meg? Huh?

835
00:51:00,007 --> 00:51:02,043
Look, I learned my lesson, OK?

836
00:51:02,087 --> 00:51:04,647
Which is exactly why
I got a feelin'...

837
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,405
you're gonna leap
at my new offer.

838
00:51:06,447 --> 00:51:09,007
You give me the key to bringing
down Wonder Breath...

839
00:51:09,047 --> 00:51:12,756
and I give you the thing
that you crave most...

840
00:51:12,807 --> 00:51:15,162
in the entire cosmos:

841
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:18,438
Your freedom.

842
00:51:22,087 --> 00:51:23,315
You should have
been there, Father.

843
00:51:23,367 --> 00:51:25,085
I mangled the Minotaur...

844
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:27,925
grappled with the Gorgon.

845
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:30,481
Just like Phil told me.
I analysed the situation...

846
00:51:30,527 --> 00:51:32,563
controlled my strength,
and kicked.

847
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:36,876
The crowds went wild!

848
00:51:39,287 --> 00:51:40,720
Thank you.

849
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:45,677
You're doin' great, son.
You're doing your old man proud.

850
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:48,116
I'm glad to hear you
say that, Father.

851
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:50,476
I've been waiting for this day
a long time.

852
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,677
What day is that, son?

853
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:55,639
The day I rejoin the gods.

854
00:51:55,687 --> 00:51:57,723
You've done wonderfully.

855
00:51:57,767 --> 00:51:59,644
You really have, my boy.

856
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:01,564
You're just not there yet.

857
00:52:01,607 --> 00:52:05,361
You haven't proven yourself
a true hero.

858
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:08,001
But, Father, I've beaten
every single monster...

859
00:52:08,047 --> 00:52:11,278
I've come up against.
I'm the most famous person...

860
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:14,444
in all of Greece.
I'm an action figure!

861
00:52:15,727 --> 00:52:18,195
I'm afraid being famous
isn't the same...

862
00:52:18,247 --> 00:52:21,125
as being a true hero.

863
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:23,203
What more can I do?

864
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:26,205
It's something you have to
discover for yourself.

865
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:31,924
- But how can l...
- Look inside your heart.

866
00:52:31,967 --> 00:52:34,242
Father, wait!

867
00:52:48,988 --> 00:52:51,138
On your left is Hercules' villa.

868
00:52:51,188 --> 00:52:53,463
Our next stop is the Pecs
and Flex Gift Shop...

869
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:55,100
where you can pick up
the great hero's...

870
00:52:55,148 --> 00:52:56,467
30-minute work-out scroll...

871
00:52:56,508 --> 00:52:58,499
"Buns of Bronze."

872
00:52:58,548 --> 00:53:00,778
At 1:00, you got a meeting
with King Augeas.

873
00:53:00,828 --> 00:53:02,261
He's got a problem
with his stables.

874
00:53:02,308 --> 00:53:03,741
I'd advise you not to wear
your new sandals.

875
00:53:03,788 --> 00:53:06,541
I told you, don't move!

876
00:53:06,588 --> 00:53:08,624
...D.G. R, the Daughters
of the Greek Revolution.

877
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:11,228
At 3:00, you gotta get a girdle
from some Amazons.

878
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:14,783
Phil, what's the point?

879
00:53:14,828 --> 00:53:17,547
That's it!

880
00:53:17,588 --> 00:53:19,499
Keep your toga on, pal.

881
00:53:22,868 --> 00:53:24,824
What d'you mean,
"What's the point?"

882
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,904
You wanna go to Olympus,
don't ya?

883
00:53:26,948 --> 00:53:30,463
Yeah, but this stuff doesn't
seem to be getting me anywhere.

884
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:33,181
You can't give up now.
I'm countin' on ya.

885
00:53:33,228 --> 00:53:35,184
I gave this everything I had.

886
00:53:37,228 --> 00:53:40,300
Listen to me, kid.
I seen 'em all.

887
00:53:40,348 --> 00:53:44,387
And I am tellin' you... and this
is the honest-to-Zeus truth...

888
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:46,419
you got somethin'
I never seen before.

889
00:53:46,468 --> 00:53:48,299
- Really?
- I can feel it...

890
00:53:48,348 --> 00:53:50,942
right down to these
stubby bowlegs of mine.

891
00:53:50,988 --> 00:53:53,821
There is nothin'
you can't do, kid.

892
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:58,427
- It's him!
- Hey, watch it!

893
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:01,904
- I touched his elbow!
- I got his sweatband!

894
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:04,223
Phil, help!

895
00:54:04,268 --> 00:54:06,657
- OK. Escape plan beta.
- Gotcha.

896
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:09,063
Where is he?

897
00:54:09,108 --> 00:54:11,303
There he goes! On the veranda!

898
00:54:26,788 --> 00:54:30,337
Let's see. What could be
behind curtain number one?

899
00:54:31,388 --> 00:54:32,980
It's all right.

900
00:54:33,028 --> 00:54:35,064
The sea of raging hormones
has ebbed.

901
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:37,668
Gee, it's great to see you.

902
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,664
I missed you.

903
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:42,097
So this is what heroes do
on their days off.

904
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:44,298
I'm no hero.

905
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:46,498
Sure ya are.
Everybody in Greece...

906
00:54:46,548 --> 00:54:47,583
thinks you're
the greatest thing...

907
00:54:47,628 --> 00:54:49,061
since they put the pocket
in pita.

908
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:51,827
I know. It's crazy.

909
00:54:51,868 --> 00:54:53,938
You know, I can't go anywhere
without being mobbed. I mean...

910
00:54:53,988 --> 00:54:55,740
You sound like
you could use a break.

911
00:54:55,788 --> 00:54:58,097
Think your nanny goat
would go...

912
00:54:58,148 --> 00:55:00,218
berserk if you played hooky
this afternoon?

913
00:55:00,268 --> 00:55:01,860
Oh, gee. I don't know.

914
00:55:01,908 --> 00:55:03,785
Phil's got the rest
of the day pretty much booked.

915
00:55:03,828 --> 00:55:06,626
Phil, schmill.
Just follow me.

916
00:55:06,668 --> 00:55:08,545
Out the window,
round the dumbbells...

917
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:10,658
you lift up the back wall
and we're gone.

918
00:55:16,148 --> 00:55:18,218
Wow. What a day.

919
00:55:18,268 --> 00:55:20,828
First, that restaurant
by the bay...

920
00:55:20,868 --> 00:55:23,587
and then that, that play,
that, that Oedipus thing.

921
00:55:23,628 --> 00:55:26,142
Man! I thought I had problems.

922
00:55:30,388 --> 00:55:33,585
- Stop foolin' around!
- Get the goods, sister.

923
00:55:33,628 --> 00:55:36,540
I didn't know that playing hooky
could be so much fun.

924
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:38,624
Neither did I.

925
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,545
Thanks, Meg.

926
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:44,786
Don't thank me just yet.

927
00:55:46,308 --> 00:55:47,263
Careful.

928
00:55:47,308 --> 00:55:49,378
Sorry. Weak ankles.

929
00:55:49,428 --> 00:55:53,546
Yeah? Well, maybe you
better sit down for a while.

930
00:55:53,588 --> 00:55:57,103
So, do you have any problems...

931
00:55:57,148 --> 00:56:00,697
with things like this?

932
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:02,500
Weak ankles, I mean.

933
00:56:02,548 --> 00:56:05,346
No. Not really.

934
00:56:05,388 --> 00:56:09,063
No weaknesses... whatsoever?

935
00:56:09,108 --> 00:56:11,827
No trick knee?

936
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,507
Ruptured... disks?

937
00:56:16,468 --> 00:56:20,427
No. I'm afraid I'm fit
as a fiddle.

938
00:56:20,468 --> 00:56:22,982
Wonderboy, you are perfect.

939
00:56:23,028 --> 00:56:24,666
Thanks.

940
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,458
It looks better that way.

941
00:56:32,508 --> 00:56:34,863
No, it really does.

942
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:43,305
You know, when I was a kid...

943
00:56:43,348 --> 00:56:45,225
I would have given anything...

944
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:46,940
to be exactly like
everybody else.

945
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:50,139
You wanted to be
petty and dishonest?

946
00:56:50,188 --> 00:56:52,065
Everybody's not like that.

947
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:55,623
- Yes, they are.
- You're not like that.

948
00:56:55,668 --> 00:56:59,058
- How do you know what I'm like?
- All I know is...

949
00:56:59,108 --> 00:57:02,339
you're the most amazing person
with...

950
00:57:02,388 --> 00:57:05,061
weak ankles I've ever met.

951
00:57:09,148 --> 00:57:11,616
Meg, when I'm with you...

952
00:57:11,668 --> 00:57:15,946
I don't feel so... alone.

953
00:57:15,988 --> 00:57:17,979
Sometimes it's better
to be alone.

954
00:57:18,028 --> 00:57:19,586
What do you mean?

955
00:57:19,628 --> 00:57:21,823
Nobody can hurt you.

956
00:57:25,468 --> 00:57:30,667
Meg? I would never,
ever hurt you.

957
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,858
And I don't wanna hurt you,
so

958
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:35,422
let's both do ourselves
a favour and...

959
00:57:35,468 --> 00:57:40,178
stop this before... we...

960
00:57:40,228 --> 00:57:44,016
All right! Break it up!
Break it up! Party's over!

961
00:57:44,068 --> 00:57:45,467
I been lookin' all over
this town!

962
00:57:45,508 --> 00:57:46,782
Calm down, mutton man.

963
00:57:46,828 --> 00:57:48,181
It was all my fault.

964
00:57:48,228 --> 00:57:49,343
You're already on my list,
sister...

965
00:57:49,388 --> 00:57:50,946
so don't make it worse!

966
00:57:54,148 --> 00:57:56,343
And as for you, ya bum, you're
gonna go to the stadium...

967
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:58,618
and you're gonna be put through
the work-out of your life!

968
00:57:58,668 --> 00:58:02,820
Now get on the horse.

969
00:58:02,868 --> 00:58:05,507
- I'm sorry.
- He'll get over it.

970
00:58:11,148 --> 00:58:13,821
Move!

971
00:58:19,188 --> 00:58:21,543
Hey, watch it!

972
00:58:21,588 --> 00:58:23,146
Keep your goo-goo eyes on the...

973
00:58:26,188 --> 00:58:29,942
That's it. Next time, I drive.

974
00:58:37,028 --> 00:58:39,940
What's the matter with me?

975
00:58:39,988 --> 00:58:42,058
You'd think a girl would learn.

976
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:47,906
If there's a prize
for rotten judgement

977
00:58:47,948 --> 00:58:51,736
I guess I've already won that

978
00:58:51,788 --> 00:58:55,701
No man is worth the aggravation

979
00:58:55,748 --> 00:58:59,184
That's ancient history
Been there, done that

980
00:58:59,228 --> 00:59:01,139
Who d'ya think you're kidding

981
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:03,497
He's the earth and heaven
to you

982
00:59:03,548 --> 00:59:05,061
Try to keep it hidden

983
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,303
Honey, we can see
right through you

984
00:59:07,348 --> 00:59:08,940
- Oh, no
- Girl, you can't conceal it

985
00:59:08,988 --> 00:59:13,584
We know how you feel
and who you're thinkin' of

986
00:59:13,628 --> 00:59:17,064
Oh-ho
No chance, no way

987
00:59:17,108 --> 00:59:19,178
I won't say it, no, no

988
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:22,823
You swoon, you sigh
Why deny it, uh-oh

989
00:59:22,868 --> 00:59:26,622
It's too cliche
I won't say I'm in love

990
00:59:26,668 --> 00:59:30,377
Shoo-doo, shoo-doo
Oo-oo-oo

991
00:59:30,428 --> 00:59:33,784
I thought my heart had
learned its lesson

992
00:59:33,828 --> 00:59:37,343
It feels so good
when you start out

993
00:59:37,388 --> 00:59:39,026
- Ah
- My head is screaming

994
00:59:39,068 --> 00:59:41,184
Get a grip, girl

995
00:59:41,228 --> 00:59:43,105
Unless you're dyin'

996
00:59:43,148 --> 00:59:45,059
To cry your heart out

997
00:59:45,108 --> 00:59:46,780
- Oh
- You keep on denying

998
00:59:46,828 --> 00:59:49,103
Who you are
and how you're feelin'

999
00:59:49,148 --> 00:59:50,581
Baby, we're not buyin'

1000
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:53,096
Hon, we saw you
hit the ceilin'

1001
00:59:53,148 --> 00:59:54,786
Face it like a grownup

1002
00:59:54,828 --> 00:59:56,580
When you gonna own up that you

1003
00:59:56,628 --> 00:59:57,743
- Got
- Got

1004
00:59:57,788 --> 00:59:59,506
Got it bad

1005
00:59:59,548 --> 01:00:04,747
Oh, no chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no

1006
01:00:04,788 --> 01:00:06,380
Give up, but give in

1007
01:00:06,428 --> 01:00:08,419
Check the grin
You're in love

1008
01:00:08,468 --> 01:00:12,177
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love

1009
01:00:12,228 --> 01:00:14,503
You're doing flips
Read our lips

1010
01:00:14,548 --> 01:00:16,027
You're in love

1011
01:00:16,068 --> 01:00:17,581
- Shoo-doo, shoo-doo
- You're way off base

1012
01:00:17,628 --> 01:00:19,778
- I won't say I'm it
- She won't say in love

1013
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:23,616
Get off my case
I won't say it

1014
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:28,788
Girl, don't be proud
It's OK, you're in love

1015
01:00:28,828 --> 01:00:31,501
Oh

1016
01:00:31,548 --> 01:00:34,779
At least out loud

1017
01:00:34,828 --> 01:00:37,706
I won't say I'm in

1018
01:00:37,748 --> 01:00:39,943
- Love
- Shoo-doo, shoo-doo

1019
01:00:39,988 --> 01:00:41,785
Shoo-doo, shoo-doo

1020
01:00:41,828 --> 01:00:44,422
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la

1021
01:00:56,148 --> 01:00:58,616
Hey, what's the buzz, Meg?

1022
01:00:58,668 --> 01:01:01,978
What is the weak link
in Wonderboy's chain?

1023
01:01:02,028 --> 01:01:04,223
Get yourself another girl.
I'm through.

1024
01:01:04,268 --> 01:01:06,179
I'm sorry. Do you mind
runnin' that by me again?

1025
01:01:06,228 --> 01:01:08,617
I must have had a chunk of
brimstone wedged in my ear...

1026
01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:12,786
- or something.
- Then read my lips! Forget it.

1027
01:01:12,828 --> 01:01:17,106
Meg, my sweet deluded
little minion.

1028
01:01:17,148 --> 01:01:19,104
Aren't we forgetting one
teensy-weensy...

1029
01:01:19,148 --> 01:01:21,708
but ever so crucial
little, tiny detail?

1030
01:01:21,748 --> 01:01:23,739
I own you!

1031
01:01:23,788 --> 01:01:27,178
I got another horn here.

1032
01:01:27,228 --> 01:01:28,547
You work for me.

1033
01:01:28,588 --> 01:01:30,863
That kid's gonna be doin' laps
for a month.

1034
01:01:30,908 --> 01:01:33,900
If I say "sing," you say,
"Hey, name that tune."

1035
01:01:33,948 --> 01:01:38,146
If I say, "I want Wonderboy's
head on a platter," you say...

1036
01:01:38,188 --> 01:01:40,144
"Medium or well-done?"

1037
01:01:40,188 --> 01:01:42,941
I knew that dame was trouble.

1038
01:01:42,988 --> 01:01:44,785
This is gonna break
the kid's heart.

1039
01:01:44,828 --> 01:01:46,261
I'll work on that.

1040
01:01:46,308 --> 01:01:47,821
I'm sorry. You hear that sound?

1041
01:01:47,868 --> 01:01:49,381
That's the sound
of your freedom...

1042
01:01:49,428 --> 01:01:52,545
fluttering out the window
forever.

1043
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:55,739
I don't care. I'm not gonna
help you hurt him.

1044
01:01:55,788 --> 01:01:58,427
I can't believe you're
getting so worked up...

1045
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:00,220
about some guy.

1046
01:02:00,268 --> 01:02:01,860
This one is different.
He's honest...

1047
01:02:01,908 --> 01:02:03,341
- and he's sweet...
- Please!

1048
01:02:03,388 --> 01:02:04,582
He would never do anything
to hurt me.

1049
01:02:04,628 --> 01:02:06,027
He's a guy!

1050
01:02:06,068 --> 01:02:09,060
Besides, oh, oneness,
you can't beat him.

1051
01:02:09,108 --> 01:02:13,624
He has no weaknesses.
He's gonna...

1052
01:02:13,668 --> 01:02:16,501
I think he does, Meg.

1053
01:02:17,508 --> 01:02:20,625
I truly think he does.

1054
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:44,823
Hey, Phil! What happened to you?

1055
01:02:44,868 --> 01:02:46,187
Kid, we gotta talk.

1056
01:02:47,548 --> 01:02:49,857
Phil, I just had the
greatest day of my life!

1057
01:02:49,908 --> 01:02:52,138
I can't stop thinking about Meg.

1058
01:02:52,188 --> 01:02:54,463
She's something else.

1059
01:02:54,508 --> 01:02:56,021
Kid, I'm tryin' to talk to ya!

1060
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:57,740
Will you come down here
and listen?

1061
01:02:57,788 --> 01:03:02,464
How can I come down there
when I'm feeling so up?

1062
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,899
Gotcha!

1063
01:03:27,948 --> 01:03:30,746
Very nice!
What I'm tryin' to say is...

1064
01:03:30,788 --> 01:03:32,665
That if it wasn't for you,
I never would have met her.

1065
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,586
I owe ya big time,
little guy, I do.

1066
01:03:35,628 --> 01:03:36,743
Will you just knock it off
for a couple of seconds?

1067
01:03:36,788 --> 01:03:38,062
Rule #38. Come on, Phil.

1068
01:03:38,108 --> 01:03:39,302
Keep them up there, huh?

1069
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,498
Phil, I got two words
for ya: Duck!

1070
01:03:41,548 --> 01:03:43,061
- Listen to me! She's...
- A dream come true?

1071
01:03:43,108 --> 01:03:45,383
- Not exactly.
- More beautiful than Aphrodite?

1072
01:03:45,428 --> 01:03:46,861
- Aside from that!
- The most wonderful...

1073
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:49,900
She's a fraud!

1074
01:03:49,948 --> 01:03:52,416
She's been playin' ya for a sap!

1075
01:03:52,468 --> 01:03:54,186
Come on.
Stop kiddin' around.

1076
01:03:54,228 --> 01:03:55,343
I'm not kiddin' around.

1077
01:03:55,388 --> 01:03:56,946
I know you're upset
about today...

1078
01:03:56,988 --> 01:03:58,262
- but that's no reason to...
- Kid, you're missin' the point.

1079
01:03:58,308 --> 01:03:59,423
The point is I love her.

1080
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:01,299
- She don't love you.
- You're crazy.

1081
01:04:01,348 --> 01:04:02,747
She's nothin'
but a two-timin'...

1082
01:04:02,788 --> 01:04:05,063
- Stop it!
- No-good, lyin', schemin'...

1083
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:06,700
Shut up!

1084
01:04:09,748 --> 01:04:13,138
Phil. L... I'm sorry.

1085
01:04:13,188 --> 01:04:17,067
OK, that's it. You won't
face the truth? Fine.

1086
01:04:17,108 --> 01:04:19,497
Phil, wait. Where you going?

1087
01:04:19,548 --> 01:04:23,143
I'm hoppin' the first barge out
of here. I'm goin' home.

1088
01:04:23,188 --> 01:04:26,703
Fine! Go!

1089
01:04:26,748 --> 01:04:28,818
I don't need you.

1090
01:04:31,108 --> 01:04:33,941
I thought you were gonna be
the all-time champ...

1091
01:04:33,988 --> 01:04:36,422
not the all-time chump.

1092
01:04:39,188 --> 01:04:41,577
Geez Louise!
What got his goat, huh?

1093
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:46,704
Baboom. Name is Hades,
Lord of the Dead.

1094
01:04:46,748 --> 01:04:48,739
- Hi. How ya doin'?
- Not now, OK?

1095
01:04:48,788 --> 01:04:49,937
I only need a few seconds...

1096
01:04:49,988 --> 01:04:51,216
and I'm a fast talker,
all right?

1097
01:04:51,268 --> 01:04:52,747
See, I've got the major deal
in the works.

1098
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:54,221
A real estate venture,
if you will.

1099
01:04:54,268 --> 01:04:56,259
And Herc, you little devil you.
May I call you Herc?

1100
01:04:56,308 --> 01:04:58,583
You seem to be constantly
getting in the way of it.

1101
01:04:58,628 --> 01:04:59,743
You've got the wrong guy.

1102
01:04:59,788 --> 01:05:01,016
Hear me out, ya little...

1103
01:05:01,068 --> 01:05:03,184
Just... hear me out, OK?

1104
01:05:03,228 --> 01:05:05,696
So I would be eternally grateful
if you would just...

1105
01:05:05,748 --> 01:05:08,262
take a day off from this
hero business of yours.

1106
01:05:08,308 --> 01:05:10,105
Geez, I mean, monsters,
natural disasters.

1107
01:05:10,148 --> 01:05:12,264
- Phew. You wait a day, OK?
- You're out of your mind.

1108
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:15,027
Not so fast, because, ya see,
I do have a little leverage...

1109
01:05:15,068 --> 01:05:16,786
you might wanna know about.

1110
01:05:18,028 --> 01:05:19,746
- Meg!
- Don't listen, Herc...

1111
01:05:21,908 --> 01:05:23,978
- Let her go!
- Here's the trade-off.

1112
01:05:24,028 --> 01:05:26,622
You give up your strength
for about 24 hours, OK?

1113
01:05:26,668 --> 01:05:28,898
Say the next 24 hours.

1114
01:05:28,948 --> 01:05:31,018
And Meg here is free as a bird
and safe from harm.

1115
01:05:31,068 --> 01:05:32,057
We dance, we kiss,
we schmooze...

1116
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:33,097
we carry on, we go home happy.

1117
01:05:33,148 --> 01:05:34,422
What d'ya say? Come on.

1118
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:37,619
People are gonna get hurt,
aren't they?

1119
01:05:37,668 --> 01:05:39,738
Nah! I mean, it's, you know,
it's a possibility.

1120
01:05:39,788 --> 01:05:40,903
It happens 'cause, you know,
it's war.

1121
01:05:40,948 --> 01:05:42,142
But what can I tell ya? Anyway.

1122
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,587
What do you owe these people?

1123
01:05:43,628 --> 01:05:45,346
Isn't Meg... little smoochy face...

1124
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:46,423
isn't she more important
than they are?

1125
01:05:46,468 --> 01:05:47,981
- Stop it!
- Isn't she?

1126
01:05:48,068 --> 01:05:51,105
You've gotta swear she'll be
safe from any harm.

1127
01:05:51,188 --> 01:05:53,065
Fine, OK.
I'll give you that one.

1128
01:05:53,108 --> 01:05:55,178
Meg is safe, otherwise you get
your strength right back.

1129
01:05:55,228 --> 01:05:57,059
Yadda, yadda. Fine print.
Boilerplate. Baboom. OK?

1130
01:05:57,108 --> 01:05:59,019
We're done. What d'ya say
we shake on it?

1131
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:01,457
Hey, I really don't have, like,
time to bat this around.

1132
01:06:01,508 --> 01:06:03,100
I'm kind of on a schedule here.
I got plans for August.

1133
01:06:03,148 --> 01:06:04,342
I need an answer, like, now.

1134
01:06:04,388 --> 01:06:06,379
Going once, going twice...

1135
01:06:06,428 --> 01:06:10,103
- All right!
- Yes, we're there! Bam!

1136
01:06:17,108 --> 01:06:19,941
You may feel just a little
queasy. It's kinda natural.

1137
01:06:19,988 --> 01:06:22,821
Maybe you should sit down!

1138
01:06:22,868 --> 01:06:25,143
Now you know how it feels...

1139
01:06:25,188 --> 01:06:27,782
to be just like everybody else.

1140
01:06:27,828 --> 01:06:31,264
Isn't it just peachy?

1141
01:06:31,308 --> 01:06:33,583
You'll love this.
One more thing.

1142
01:06:33,668 --> 01:06:36,228
Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.

1143
01:06:36,308 --> 01:06:37,900
You're off the hook.

1144
01:06:37,948 --> 01:06:40,098
And by the way, Herc,
is she not, like...

1145
01:06:40,148 --> 01:06:42,457
- a fabulous little actress?
- Stop it.

1146
01:06:42,508 --> 01:06:43,702
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

1147
01:06:43,748 --> 01:06:44,942
your little chickie-poo here...

1148
01:06:44,988 --> 01:06:47,218
was working for me all the time.

1149
01:06:47,268 --> 01:06:50,021
You're lying!

1150
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:52,905
Help!

1151
01:06:52,948 --> 01:06:55,781
Jeepers, mister,
you're really strong.

1152
01:06:55,828 --> 01:06:58,262
Couldn't have done it without
you, sugar, sweetheart, babe.

1153
01:06:58,308 --> 01:06:59,707
No! It's not like that.

1154
01:06:59,748 --> 01:07:02,660
I didn't mean to...
I couldn't... l...

1155
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:04,585
I'm so sorry.

1156
01:07:04,628 --> 01:07:08,507
Our hero's a zero!

1157
01:07:10,788 --> 01:07:12,141
Well, gotta blaze.

1158
01:07:12,188 --> 01:07:14,577
There's a whole cosmos up there
waiting for me...

1159
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:16,220
with, hey, my name on it.

1160
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:22,183
So much for the preliminaries,
and now on to the main event!

1161
01:07:34,588 --> 01:07:37,785
Brothers! Titans!

1162
01:07:37,828 --> 01:07:40,103
Look at you
in your squalid prison!

1163
01:07:41,388 --> 01:07:43,948
Who put you down there?

1164
01:07:43,988 --> 01:07:46,297
Zeus!

1165
01:07:46,348 --> 01:07:48,464
And now that I set you free...

1166
01:07:48,508 --> 01:07:52,296
what is the first thing
you are going to do?

1167
01:07:52,348 --> 01:07:55,977
- Destroy him!
- Good answer.

1168
01:07:58,388 --> 01:08:02,745
Crush Zeus!

1169
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:08,024
Freeze him!

1170
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:15,424
Melt Zeus!

1171
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:17,936
Blow... him...

1172
01:08:17,988 --> 01:08:20,422
away!

1173
01:08:22,428 --> 01:08:25,226
Zeus!

1174
01:08:26,588 --> 01:08:28,499
Guys?

1175
01:08:28,548 --> 01:08:30,459
Olympus would be that way.

1176
01:08:30,508 --> 01:08:35,582
- Zeus!
- Freeze him!

1177
01:08:35,628 --> 01:08:37,425
Hold it, bright eye.

1178
01:08:37,468 --> 01:08:40,426
I have a special job for you,
my optic friend.

1179
01:08:49,028 --> 01:08:51,064
Destroy Zeus!

1180
01:08:51,108 --> 01:08:54,225
Oh, we're in trouble!
Oh, big trouble! I gotta...

1181
01:08:54,268 --> 01:08:57,226
My lord and lady,
the Titans have escaped...

1182
01:08:57,268 --> 01:08:59,179
and they're practically
at our gates!

1183
01:08:59,228 --> 01:09:03,107
Sound the alarm! Launch
an immediate counterattack!

1184
01:09:03,148 --> 01:09:05,821
- Go! Go!
- Gone, babe.

1185
01:09:14,308 --> 01:09:16,902
Charge!

1186
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:19,860
On to battle!

1187
01:09:29,308 --> 01:09:33,347
You windbag!

1188
01:09:33,388 --> 01:09:36,061
Boom, badda-boom,
boom, boom!

1189
01:09:43,588 --> 01:09:48,025
Where are you?

1190
01:09:48,068 --> 01:09:49,979
What can we do?

1191
01:09:50,028 --> 01:09:50,983
Where is Hercules?

1192
01:09:51,028 --> 01:09:53,337
Yeah, Hercules'll save us.

1193
01:09:54,988 --> 01:09:58,776
Hercules! Come out!

1194
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:02,741
Face me!

1195
01:10:02,788 --> 01:10:03,982
What are you doing?

1196
01:10:04,028 --> 01:10:06,098
Without your strength,
you'll be killed.

1197
01:10:06,148 --> 01:10:09,936
- There are worse things.
- Run!

1198
01:10:09,988 --> 01:10:12,786
Wait! Stop!

1199
01:10:12,828 --> 01:10:16,025
- Hey, look! It's Hercules.
- Thank the gods!

1200
01:10:16,068 --> 01:10:17,979
We're saved!

1201
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:21,782
So, you mighty Hercules.

1202
01:10:34,108 --> 01:10:37,020
Easy, horsefeathers.

1203
01:10:37,068 --> 01:10:38,626
Stop twitching.

1204
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:41,819
Listen.
Hercules is in trouble.

1205
01:10:41,868 --> 01:10:43,745
We've gotta find Phil.

1206
01:10:43,788 --> 01:10:45,665
He's the only one who can
talk some sense into him.

1207
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:53,176
Get back, blast you!

1208
01:10:56,788 --> 01:11:00,906
- Ooh, chihuahua.
- Zeus!

1209
01:11:02,148 --> 01:11:04,901
Come on! Hurry up!
We're shovin' off here!

1210
01:11:07,228 --> 01:11:08,707
Phil, Hercules needs your help!

1211
01:11:08,748 --> 01:11:11,262
What does he need me for when
he's got friends like you?

1212
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,060
He won't listen to me.

1213
01:11:13,108 --> 01:11:15,258
Good! He's finally
learned something.

1214
01:11:15,308 --> 01:11:18,744
Look, I know what I did was
wrong, but this isn't about me.

1215
01:11:18,788 --> 01:11:20,062
It's about him.

1216
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:23,418
If you don't help him now,
Phil, he'll die.

1217
01:11:23,468 --> 01:11:26,107
I need more thunderbolts!

1218
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:28,104
Hephaestus has been
captured, my lord.

1219
01:11:28,148 --> 01:11:30,378
Everyone's been captured.
I've been captured!

1220
01:11:30,428 --> 01:11:32,623
Watch the glasses.

1221
01:11:38,468 --> 01:11:40,857
Zeusy, I'm home!

1222
01:11:40,908 --> 01:11:45,060
Hades. You're behind this!

1223
01:11:45,108 --> 01:11:46,746
You are correct, sir!

1224
01:11:51,068 --> 01:11:52,706
Flea.

1225
01:12:00,228 --> 01:12:02,105
Come on, kid. Come on.
Fight back.

1226
01:12:02,148 --> 01:12:03,263
Come on. You can take this bum.

1227
01:12:03,308 --> 01:12:05,264
This guy's a pushover.
Look at him.

1228
01:12:05,308 --> 01:12:08,345
You were right all along, Phil.

1229
01:12:08,388 --> 01:12:11,778
- Dreams are for rookies.
- No, no, kid.

1230
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,546
Givin' up is for rookies.

1231
01:12:13,588 --> 01:12:15,658
I came back 'cause I'm not
quittin' on ya.

1232
01:12:15,708 --> 01:12:18,620
I'm willing to go the distance.
How 'bout you?

1233
01:12:22,108 --> 01:12:26,579
Me bite off head!

1234
01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:31,780
Whoa, baby!

1235
01:12:43,468 --> 01:12:46,141
Hercules! Look out!

1236
01:12:46,188 --> 01:12:49,225
Meg! No!

1237
01:12:57,388 --> 01:12:59,060
What's happening?

1238
01:13:00,868 --> 01:13:03,701
Hades' deal is broken.

1239
01:13:03,748 --> 01:13:06,740
He promised I wouldn't get hurt.

1240
01:13:09,028 --> 01:13:12,737
Why did you...
You didn't have to...

1241
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:16,337
People always do crazy things...

1242
01:13:16,388 --> 01:13:18,697
when they're in love.

1243
01:13:18,748 --> 01:13:21,262
Oh, Meg.

1244
01:13:21,308 --> 01:13:23,219
Meg, l...

1245
01:13:23,268 --> 01:13:27,944
Are you always this
articulate?

1246
01:13:29,908 --> 01:13:34,982
You haven't got much time.
You can still stop Hades.

1247
01:13:35,028 --> 01:13:36,507
I'll watch over her, kid.

1248
01:13:38,428 --> 01:13:40,419
You're gonna be all right.

1249
01:13:40,468 --> 01:13:42,026
I promise.

1250
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:46,706
Let's go, Pegasus!

1251
01:13:49,188 --> 01:13:51,543
Hup, two, three, four.
Come on, everybody!

1252
01:13:51,588 --> 01:13:54,261
I can't hear you!

1253
01:13:54,308 --> 01:13:58,824
I swear to you, Hades,
when I get out of this...

1254
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:01,018
I'm the one giving orders now,
bolt boy.

1255
01:14:01,068 --> 01:14:03,138
And I think I'm gonna
like it here.

1256
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,748
Don't get too
comfortable, Hades!

1257
01:14:09,108 --> 01:14:11,258
This oughta even the odds!

1258
01:14:14,108 --> 01:14:16,906
Yeah, Hercules!
Thank you, man.

1259
01:14:16,948 --> 01:14:18,620
Get them!

1260
01:14:22,988 --> 01:14:26,219
No! Get him, not me! Him!

1261
01:14:28,348 --> 01:14:32,944
Follow the fingers! Him!
The yutz with the horse.

1262
01:14:39,348 --> 01:14:40,986
Thank you, my boy.

1263
01:14:41,028 --> 01:14:43,417
Nice horsey!
My intentions were pure!

1264
01:14:43,468 --> 01:14:45,698
I really was attracted to you.

1265
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:50,343
Throw!

1266
01:14:50,388 --> 01:14:53,903
Now watch your old man work!

1267
01:14:58,628 --> 01:15:01,222
Guys, get your titanic rears
in gear...

1268
01:15:01,268 --> 01:15:03,828
and kick some Olympian butt!

1269
01:15:03,868 --> 01:15:05,779
Whoa, is my hair out?

1270
01:15:32,308 --> 01:15:34,026
Thanks a ton, Wonderboy.

1271
01:15:34,068 --> 01:15:36,582
But at least I've got one swell
consolation prize...

1272
01:15:36,628 --> 01:15:39,984
a friend of yours
who's dying to see me.

1273
01:16:40,188 --> 01:16:41,985
I'm sorry, kid.

1274
01:16:44,068 --> 01:16:46,946
There's some things
you just can't change.

1275
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:51,945
Yes, I can.

1276
01:16:55,468 --> 01:16:58,107
We were so close!

1277
01:16:58,148 --> 01:17:01,106
So close. We tripped
at the finish line. Why?

1278
01:17:01,148 --> 01:17:04,424
Because our little nut, Meg,
has to go all noble.

1279
01:17:08,628 --> 01:17:11,506
- Where's Meg?
- Look who's here.

1280
01:17:11,548 --> 01:17:13,698
Wonderboy, you are too much.

1281
01:17:13,748 --> 01:17:17,661
- Let her go.
- Get a grip.

1282
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:19,744
Come here, come here.
Let me show you around.

1283
01:17:20,188 --> 01:17:23,863
Well, well. It's a small
underworld after all.

1284
01:17:26,988 --> 01:17:29,104
No, no, no. Mustn't touch.

1285
01:17:29,148 --> 01:17:31,184
You see, Meg's running
with a new crowd these days.

1286
01:17:31,228 --> 01:17:33,583
And not a very lively one,
at that.

1287
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:38,378
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.

1288
01:17:38,428 --> 01:17:41,500
Oh, well.
The son of my hated rival...

1289
01:17:41,548 --> 01:17:43,425
trapped forever
in a river of death.

1290
01:17:43,468 --> 01:17:44,821
Going once.

1291
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:46,859
- Is there a downside to this?
- Going twice!

1292
01:17:46,908 --> 01:17:48,864
OK.

1293
01:17:48,908 --> 01:17:52,264
You get her out.
She goes; you stay.

1294
01:17:55,788 --> 01:17:57,016
You know what slipped my mind?

1295
01:17:57,068 --> 01:17:58,547
You'll be dead
before you can get to her.

1296
01:17:58,588 --> 01:18:00,579
That's not a problem, is it?

1297
01:18:27,308 --> 01:18:29,868
What's the matter
with these scissors?

1298
01:18:29,908 --> 01:18:32,342
The thread won't cut.

1299
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:42,097
This is impossible!

1300
01:18:42,148 --> 01:18:45,106
You can't be alive!
You'd have to be a...

1301
01:18:45,148 --> 01:18:46,342
A god?

1302
01:18:50,868 --> 01:18:54,656
Hercules, stop! You can't
do this to me. You can't...

1303
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:56,585
Fine. OK. Listen.

1304
01:18:56,628 --> 01:18:58,937
Well, I deserved that. Herc.

1305
01:18:58,988 --> 01:19:01,707
Can we talk? Your dad,
he's a fun guy, right?

1306
01:19:01,748 --> 01:19:03,659
So maybe you could put in a word
with him...

1307
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:06,017
and he'd kinda blow this
whole thing off, you know?

1308
01:19:06,068 --> 01:19:09,185
Meg, talk to him.
A little schmooze...

1309
01:19:11,028 --> 01:19:13,417
Get away from me!
Don't touch me!

1310
01:19:13,468 --> 01:19:15,902
Get your slimy souls off me!

1311
01:19:17,388 --> 01:19:19,583
He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.

1312
01:19:19,628 --> 01:19:22,381
You mean,
if he gets outta there.

1313
01:19:22,428 --> 01:19:24,942
Lf. If is good.

1314
01:19:24,988 --> 01:19:28,344
I don't feel so good.
I feel a little flushed!

1315
01:19:49,308 --> 01:19:53,745
Wonderboy, what... why did you...

1316
01:19:53,788 --> 01:19:57,576
People always do crazy things...

1317
01:19:57,628 --> 01:19:59,937
when they're in love.

1318
01:20:21,668 --> 01:20:23,818
Three cheers
for the mighty Hercules!

1319
01:20:23,868 --> 01:20:26,701
Flowers for everybody!

1320
01:20:39,508 --> 01:20:44,059
Hercules, we're so proud of you.

1321
01:20:44,108 --> 01:20:47,225
Mother.

1322
01:20:47,268 --> 01:20:49,862
Fine work, my boy!

1323
01:20:49,908 --> 01:20:53,662
You've done it!
You're a true hero.

1324
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:57,496
You were willing to give your
life to rescue this young woman.

1325
01:20:57,548 --> 01:21:01,461
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength...

1326
01:21:01,508 --> 01:21:05,183
but by the strength
of his heart.

1327
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:12,145
Now, at last, my son,
you can come home.

1328
01:21:25,468 --> 01:21:27,140
Congratulations, Wonderboy.

1329
01:21:27,188 --> 01:21:29,497
You'll make one heck of a god.

1330
01:21:37,588 --> 01:21:42,059
Father, this is the moment
I've always dreamed of.

1331
01:21:42,108 --> 01:21:44,258
But...

1332
01:21:45,628 --> 01:21:49,177
a life without Meg,
even an immortal life...

1333
01:21:49,228 --> 01:21:53,107
would be empty.

1334
01:21:54,788 --> 01:21:57,222
L...

1335
01:21:57,268 --> 01:21:59,702
I wish to stay on Earth
with her.

1336
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:02,342
I finally know where I belong.

1337
01:22:15,508 --> 01:22:17,260
Hit it, ladies!

1338
01:22:17,308 --> 01:22:20,903
Oh, gonna shout it
from the mountaintops

1339
01:22:20,948 --> 01:22:22,461
A star is born

1340
01:22:22,508 --> 01:22:25,022
It's the time
for pulling out the stops

1341
01:22:25,068 --> 01:22:26,467
A star is born

1342
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,260
Honey, hit us with a hallelu

1343
01:22:28,308 --> 01:22:30,185
That kid came shining through

1344
01:22:30,228 --> 01:22:31,946
Girl, sing the song

1345
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:34,343
Come blow your horn

1346
01:22:34,388 --> 01:22:37,903
A star is born

1347
01:22:37,948 --> 01:22:40,303
He's a hero who can please
the crowd

1348
01:22:40,348 --> 01:22:42,145
A star is born

1349
01:22:42,188 --> 01:22:44,258
Come on,
everybody shout out loud

1350
01:22:44,308 --> 01:22:45,866
A star is born

1351
01:22:45,908 --> 01:22:47,864
Just remember
in the darkest hour

1352
01:22:47,908 --> 01:22:49,705
Within your heart's the power

1353
01:22:49,748 --> 01:22:53,536
For makin' you a hero too

1354
01:22:53,588 --> 01:22:56,785
So don't lose hope
when you're forlorn

1355
01:22:56,828 --> 01:22:58,181
That's Phil's boy!

1356
01:22:58,228 --> 01:23:02,301
Just keep your eyes
upon the skies

1357
01:23:02,348 --> 01:23:03,906
Every night, a star is

1358
01:23:03,948 --> 01:23:05,825
Right in sight, a star is

1359
01:23:05,868 --> 01:23:11,340
Burning bright, a star is born

1360
01:23:13,268 --> 01:23:15,543
Like a beacon
in the cold dark night

1361
01:23:15,588 --> 01:23:17,021
A star is born

1362
01:23:17,068 --> 01:23:19,582
Told ya everything would
turn out right

1363
01:23:19,628 --> 01:23:21,220
A star is born

1364
01:23:21,268 --> 01:23:23,020
Just when everything was
all at sea

1365
01:23:23,068 --> 01:23:24,899
The boy made history

1366
01:23:24,948 --> 01:23:26,904
- The bottom line
- Bottom line

1367
01:23:26,948 --> 01:23:29,018
- He sure can shine
- He can shine

1368
01:23:29,068 --> 01:23:32,663
His rising sign is Capricorn

1369
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:34,664
He knew how to

1370
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:37,268
He had a clue

1371
01:23:37,308 --> 01:23:40,698
Telling you a star is born

1372
01:23:40,748 --> 01:23:43,023
Here's a hero
who can please a crowd

1373
01:23:43,068 --> 01:23:44,626
A star is born

1374
01:23:44,668 --> 01:23:46,943
Come on,
everybody shout out loud

1375
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:48,421
A star is born

1376
01:23:48,468 --> 01:23:50,538
Just remember
in the darkest hour

1377
01:23:50,588 --> 01:23:52,340
Within your heart's the power

1378
01:23:52,388 --> 01:23:56,267
- For makin' you a hero too
- A hero too

1379
01:23:56,308 --> 01:23:57,536
So don't lose hope

1380
01:23:57,588 --> 01:24:00,102
- When you're forlorn
- No, no

1381
01:24:00,148 --> 01:24:04,619
Just keep your eyes
upon the skies

1382
01:24:04,668 --> 01:24:06,545
Every night, a star is

1383
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:08,465
Right in sight, a star is

1384
01:24:08,508 --> 01:24:14,299
Burning bright, a star is born

1385
01:28:43,628 --> 01:28:45,619
HADES: What d'ya say?
It's happy ending time!

1386
01:28:45,668 --> 01:28:47,738
Everybody's got a little taste
of somethin' but me.

1387
01:28:47,788 --> 01:28:49,540
I got nothin'.
I'm here with nothin'.

1388
01:28:49,588 --> 01:28:51,306
Anybody listenin'?

1389
01:28:51,348 --> 01:28:53,737
It's like I'm... what am I,
an echo or something?

1390
01:28:53,788 --> 01:28:56,746
Hello? Hello?
Am I talking to, what?

1391
01:28:56,788 --> 01:29:00,383
Hyperspace? Hello, it's me.
Nobody listens.
