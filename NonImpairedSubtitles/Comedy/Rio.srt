It's okay. It's okay.

24
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,900
I'll take care of you.

25
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,900
Stupid clock.

26
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,300
Good morning, Blu.

27
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,200
Tyler Blu Gunderson!

28
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,300
You know these vitamins
are good for you.

29
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,500
What's this?

30
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,200
Gotcha!

31
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,300
Enjoy the new book!

32
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,600
Thanks, Linda!

33
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,100
Bye, now.

34
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,200
Yes, Mom, I'd love to visit,
but who would take care of Blu?

35
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,100
Mom! They don't have
kennels for parrots.

36
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,800
Here's your hot chocolate, Blu!

37
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,700
Just how you like it.

38
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,700
Plus, I don't trust
leaving Blu with just anyone.

39
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
No, I don't have a bird-sitter.

40
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,200
This is the life.

41
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,100
The perfect marshmallow-to-cocoa ratio.

42
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,400
One, two, three, four, five, six.

43
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Well, well, if it isn't
my favorite nerd bird.

44
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Very funny. Real mature.

45
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Hey, pet!
Where you migrating to this year?

46
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,900
The breakfast nook?

47
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,700
Throw all the snowballs you want.

48
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,500
I'm protected by this magical force-field
called glass.

49
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,700
It's what keeps us so toasty and warm
in here

50
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,500
while you guys are out there
freezing your...

51
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,200
Classy.

52
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,700
Are you all right?

53
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,100
I'm not really built for this weather.

54
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,400
Are you looking for some books?

55
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,200
Books? No. No.

56
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I have come 6,000 miles looking for him.

57
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Doctor of Ornithology?

58
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,100
He's magnificent.

59
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,900
Linda? Little help here. Linda!

60
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,200
Wow!

61
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,000
You're actually communicating.

62
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,900
Yes! I introduced myself and shook
my tail feathers counter-clockwise

63
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,200
thus deferring to his dominance.

64
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,800
I did not get that at all.

65
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,300
So, Dr. Monteiro...

66
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,400
No "Doctor," please, just call me Tulio.

67
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,300
You know,
your macaw is a very special bird.

68
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,200
In fact, as far as we know,
Blu is the last male of his kind!

69
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
Really?

70
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,200
Yes,

71
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,900
and recently, we found a female

72
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,100
and our hope is to bring the two of them
together to save their species.

73
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,500
Well, yeah, sure, when
can she come over?

74
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,600
No, no. She is in Brazil.

75
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,100
Blu must come to Rio de Janeiro.

76
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Rio? Brazil?

77
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,500
No. No, no, no.

78
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,900
I never let Blu out of my sight.
He needs me.

79
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,100
No. You misunderstand.

80
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,400
It's all arranged.

81
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,200
You will be with him
every step of the way.

82
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,600
And I will be with you.

83
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,300
Look, I know you're doing your job,
but I can't...

84
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,800
Well, Blu is very particular.

85
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,700
And we have our little routine here
and we're not big on travel.

86
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,200
Heck, he doesn't even fly!

87
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,700
But of course he can fly!

88
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,200
He's a perfect specimen.

89
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,300
What are you doing?

90
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Don't worry, their natural instincts
always take over.

91
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,700
Wait, wait, wait! No, no!

92
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,300
Well, almost always.

93
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,500
Blu!

94
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,100
What kind of doctor are you?

95
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,600
Are you okay?

96
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,300
Perhaps, he's too domesticated.

97
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,900
It was very nice of you to stop in
and squawk around

98
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,400
and throw my bird.

99
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,900
But now it's time for you to go.

100
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,200
I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry, but...

101
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
Wait, wait, Linda. Linda!

102
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,800
This could be our last chance.

103
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,400
Have a safe flight.

104
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,900
Linda, please, listen to me.

105
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:28,100
If we don't do this,
his whole species will be gone!

106
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,300
Just think about it.

107
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Natural instincts!

108
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,600
There is nothing natural about being
thrown halfway across the room.

109
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,900
Well, I'll show him.

110
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,200
I can do this.

111
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,800
I just have to work out the physics.

112
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,500
I have quadrated my vector angles.

113
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,100
I've adjusted for wind shear.

114
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,900
Positive reinforcement.

115
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,800
Good.

116
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,100
Okay, let's see.

117
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,000
Flaps open. Perfect.

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,700
Landing gear. Check.

119
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,100
Tail flaps. Operational.

120
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,600
And, actually, not bad.

121
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,500
This is it.

122
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Let's fly.

123
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,000
Just keep it simple.

124
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,900
Thrust, lift, drag and weight.

125
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,900
Thrust, lift, drag, weight.

126
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,400
Thrust, lift, drag, weight.

127
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,100
Thrust, lift, drag... Wait!

128
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,500
Blu?

129
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,900
I promised I would always look out for you,
didn't I?

130
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,700
And have I ever broken a promise?

131
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,100
I'm scared, too

132
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,700
but I wouldn't make you do this
if it wasn't the right thing to do.

133
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,800
What do you say, Blu?

134
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,400
That's my big, brave boy.

135
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:18,000
And we'll be back home
before we even know it.

136
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,900
Your turn, Blu!

137
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,100
You don't want to get beak-burn.

138
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,100
Whoa! What is going on here?

139
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,900
- You arrived in time for Carnaval!
- Carnaval?

140
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,500
Yes, it's the biggest
party in the world.

141
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,200
You know,
a time to have fun and dance!

142
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,300
Oh, my!

143
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,900
Is she a performer?

144
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,300
No, in fact, she's my dentist.

145
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,800
Dr. Barbosa!

146
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
Don't forget to floss, Tulio!

147
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,500
You got it!

148
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Come tomorrow night,
everyone will be dressed like that.

149
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,200
Not me.

150
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,500
Oh, right yeah.

151
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,500
I am not from here.

152
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,400
Hey, Nico, he's a tourist!

153
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,800
Funny, you don't look like one.

154
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,600
Really? I don't?

155
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,300
Except you got pigeon doo-doo
on your nose.

156
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,800
Oh, no, this is just SPF 3000.

157
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,500
So, are you here for Carnaval?

158
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,000
Actually, I'm just here to meet a girl.

159
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,300
- A girl!
- Yes!

160
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,000
Little word of advice,
you make the first move.

161
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Brazilian ladies respond to confidence.

162
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,100
Right.

163
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,200
Yeah, it's all about swagger.
You got to puff out that chest!

164
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,000
Swing that tail!

165
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,700
Eyes narrow,
like some kind of crazy love-hawk!

166
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
- But first we got to bust you out.
- What?

167
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,600
Yeah! I'm gonna pop that cage open
like a soda can!

168
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,900
No, no. Wait!

169
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,300
No, no, no, that's okay.

170
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,400
You call that popping?

171
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,000
This thing is robust.

172
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,100
No, no, guys, really, I'm fine.
The cage is great.

173
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,800
Love the cage!

174
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,900
Suit yourself!

175
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,800
Don't forget, love-hawk!

176
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Yes, yes,/Bem...

177
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,800
And to you, as well.

178
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,100
This is the heart and
soul of our aviary.

179
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,200
Our treatment room.

180
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,600
They really like you.

181
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,700
A lot.

182
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,300
Yes. I'm their great, big mama bird.

183
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,800
Wow!

184
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,400
Want some?

185
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,700
I'm good.

186
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,600
Many of the birds here
were rescued from smugglers.

187
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,000
Smugglers?

188
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,900
Yes! And unfortunately,
the poor birds are often hurt

189
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,700
or even killed in the process.

190
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,100
But with proper care, they can be saved.

191
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,500
Look here.
This poor guy was found last night.

192
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,900
Hey, buddy! You're looking great today.

193
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,000
Much better, much better!

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,400
Get well soon!

195
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,000
So, where is Jewel?

196
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,300
We have a special place for Jewel.

197
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,600
She's a very spirited bird.

198
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,100
I'll say.

199
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,800
She did that?

200
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,100
Charming. Okay, I want to go home now.

201
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,600
No, no. Don't worry.

202
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm going to make you look irresistible.

203
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,800
Help! Help! Let me out of here!

204
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,900
Linda!

205
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:33,600
- Maybe I should...
- No, no. Give it a chance.

206
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,100
Hello?

207
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,600
Hello?

208
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,400
I come in peace.

209
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,500
/Whoa. She's beautiful.

210
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:06,700
/What were they talking about?
/She's like an angel.

211
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:12,600
/An angel who's getting really close...

212
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,100
You're standing on my throat.

213
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,700
You're an American.

214
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,000
Thanks. I need my throat for talking.
So, thank you.

215
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,300
You look like me.

216
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,500
Hi.

217
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,400
Hi, my name is Blu.

218
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,200
Like the cheese with the mold on it.
You know, that smells really bad.

219
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,600
That's stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

220
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,300
Come on. We don't have much time.

221
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,000
Wait, wait, wait.

222
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,400
- Are you ready?
- For what?

223
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,600
Wow. Okay.

224
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Confidence. Crazy love-hawk.

225
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,600
All right.

226
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,200
Whoa, what are you doing?

227
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,900
What? What you wanted me to.

228
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,000
But just for argument's sake,
what are you doing?

229
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,300
I am trying to escape.

230
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,900
Yeah, escape, that's where I was going
with that thing I just did.

231
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,200
Wait, wait. Did you actually think
we were going to kiss?

232
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,800
- No! It's not what you think.
- We just met.

233
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh, my.

234
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,800
I think they need a little help.

235
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,600
I know how my feathers look,
but I am not that kind of bird.

236
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,400
Okay, I had nothing to do with that.

237
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,700
But, you have to admit
it's actually a pretty good song.

238
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,600
/Naturally

239
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,800
Yeah, sing it, Lionel.

240
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Wow. That was fast.

241
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,500
Lionel Richie works every time.

242
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,700
We should probably give them
some privacy.

243
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,600
I'm not so sure
I should leave Blu here alone.

244
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,100
No, don't worry.

245
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,300
Sylvio will keep an
eye on them all night.

246
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,100
Besides, he's got Jewel.

247
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,800
/Help me!

248
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,500
/This is the final
/countdown to Carnaval!

249
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,800
/Let's samba!

250
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Come here, poor little birdie.

251
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,100
It's okay, I got you.

252
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I got you.

253
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,300
Excuse me.

254
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Please, I am trying to sleep.

255
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm sorry, sleepy-head,
I'm trying to escape.

256
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,700
Escape? Why?
This cage is awesome.

257
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,500
This...

258
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,300
What was I thinking?

259
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,700
I wouldn't expect a pet to understand.

260
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,100
Pet? Did you just call me a pet?

261
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,200
For the record, I am not a pet.

262
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,700
I am a companion.

263
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,200
And you know what?
Do whatever you want

264
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,300
'cause tomorrow morning,
Linda will come for me

265
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,100
and this whole nightmare
will be over.

266
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,400
Incredible!

267
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,000
You would rather be with a human
than with your own kind.

268
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Well, that human has given me love
and affection for the past 15 years

269
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,400
whereas my own kind try to strangle me
after 15 seconds.

270
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,200
Yeah, well, because of them,
I've lost everything.

271
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,000
You can't trust them.

272
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,200
Of course...

273
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,000
you can trust humans.

274
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,100
Jewel? Jewel?

275
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Hi, there.

276
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It was nice of you to
join me for dinner.

277
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I often eat alone.

278
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,900
Because, of course, my work.

279
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,700
I thought I was the
bird nut until I met you.

280
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,100
Yes, right.

281
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,700
Do you have a favorite bird?

282
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,800
Well, obviously,
I'm a blue macaw kind of gal.

283
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,600
That makes sense.
They are very handsome birds.

284
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,300
Actually, it's the brains
I'm more attracted to.

285
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm not so impressed
by fancy feathers.

286
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,700
I know exactly what you mean.

287
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,800
My favorite bird is the spotted owl.

288
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,700
I've always been mesmerized

289
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,400
by those big...

290
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,800
round, intelligent eyes.

291
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,000
Chicken hearts?

292
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,600
Chicken hearts! Oh, gosh.

293
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,500
Hello?

294
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh, Blu.

295
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,500
We should have never left Moose Lake.

296
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
This is all my fault.

297
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:07,100
No, no, Linda, Linda, please.
This is not your fault.

298
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,100
You're right.

299
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,400
It's not my fault.

300
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,900
- It's your fault!
- What?

301
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,800
With your little bird talk.

302
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,500
And that whole "save the species."

303
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,700
Well, you know what?

304
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,800
Squawk, squawkity, squawk, squawk!

305
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,200
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to curse.

306
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,400
I don't understand.

307
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,700
Sylvio is the best
guard in the business.

308
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,000
So, let me get this straight.

309
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,400
You were attacked by
a little white bird?

310
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,600
Yes, with this rag.

311
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,900
He held it to my mouth like this.

312
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,600
We're doomed.

313
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Okay. There's no place like home,
there's no place like home.

314
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,800
How I wish I was back in my own cage

315
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,100
with my mirror and my swing,
and my little bell.

316
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,000
How I miss my little bell.

317
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Play dead.

318
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What? I don't need to play dead,
I'm about to have a heart attack.

319
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,900
Just do it!

320
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,400
Fine.

321
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,900
Stop twitching.

322
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:24,100
Come on, it's the
twitching that sells it.

323
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,100
Come on in, kid.

324
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,600
Well, what do you know?

325
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Good work, Fernando.

326
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,800
You see, boys?

327
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,600
What did I tell you about this one?

328
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,100
That you were going to pay him
half as much as you said?

329
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,600
No, you idiot.

330
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,700
That he reminds me of myself
when I was that age.

331
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,100
Smart, resourceful.

332
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,500
Here you go, kid.

333
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,400
Hey. This is only half
of what you promised me.

334
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,900
Shut up, kid.

335
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,000
What the...

336
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,500
I thought I told you
I needed these birds alive.

337
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,900
Tell me, Fernando...

338
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,700
does this look alive to you?

339
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,800
Get her!

340
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Come over here!

341
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,100
Jewel!

342
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Come here!

343
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,900
Hello...

344
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,600
pretty bird.

345
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,900
What's the matter?

346
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,300
Cockatoo got your throat?

347
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,900
Nigel!

348
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,300
Alive.

349
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,900
To be continued.

350
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,000
That was your plan?
To take off and leave me? Gee, thanks.

351
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,100
Well, why didn't you follow me?

352
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,800
Nice work, Nigel.

353
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,500
Yeah, nice work, Nigel.

354
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,100
The last blue macaws on earth.

355
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,000
These are worth a fortune.

356
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,700
Hey, Fernando,
hang these up in the other room.

357
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,300
Hey, birdie!

358
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,000
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out of here!

359
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,500
Who's a pretty bird? I'm a pretty bird.

360
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,900
Pretty bird, I'm a pretty bird.
I'm a pretty bird.

361
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,600
I was framed. They got the wrong guy.

362
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Sorry, guys. Nothing personal.

363
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,500
So, what's going to happen to them?

364
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,000
Don't worry, we're going to find
good homes for them.

365
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,100
Now go home to your mama.

366
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,400
But I don't have a mama.

367
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,500
Father?

368
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,400
- Brother?
- Goldfish?

369
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,200
Can we keep him, boss?

370
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,500
No.

371
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,900
So, Marcel, what's really going to happen
to those birds?

372
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,200
Plucked, stuffed, eaten, who cares?

373
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,800
All I know is we're going to be rich.

374
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,800
We're gonna be rich!

375
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,600
Come on, come on! The game is starting!

376
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,300
Yes, you were very clear.
Tomorrow or the deal is off.

377
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,600
Of course I have both the macaws.

378
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Yes, I will deliver them myself.

379
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,300
All right, you two...

380
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,600
you load the truck tonight.

381
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,600
And first thing in the morning,
we bring those birds to the airport.

382
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
You got it?

383
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
- Yeah, sure.
- All right. Heard you.

384
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,500
And one of you, feed Nigel.

385
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,000
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

386
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,900
Yes!

387
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,500
Nuh-uh, scissors cuts rock.

388
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,800
Oh, man. How come you always win?

389
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,800
Nice birdie.

390
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,300
Here you go.

391
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,800
Cannibal.

392
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,900
Okay, pull it together.
The key is not to panic.

393
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,100
I'm not panicking.

394
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,100
I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to me.

395
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,200
But it's okay, because any minute now,
Linda will find us.

396
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,500
Great. And then she'll stick us behind
another set of bars, right?

397
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,800
Yeah. I mean, no.

398
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:21,200
Look, pet, cages might work for you,
but I don't want to belong to anyone.

399
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,600
Something seems to be lodged in my beak.

400
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,100
Would you mind?

401
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,300
I know I'm not a pretty birdie...

402
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,100
but I used to be quite a looker.

403
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,800
A star.

404
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,500
Lights, camera, action.

405
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,900
/I was striking,
/suave, ambitious.

406
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,300
/Feet to beak...

407
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,700
/so birdie-licious

408
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,300
/Now I'm vile, I am villainous,
/and vicious

409
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,200
/Oh, and malicious

410
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,800
/I had it all
/A TVshow, women, too

411
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,600
/I was tall
/Over one-foot-two

412
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,400
/Then they got a
/pretty parakeet to fill my shoes

413
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,600
/That's why I am so evil,
/why I do what I do.

414
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,800
/He was a super star

415
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,200
/So young and vital

416
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,400
/He's nasty

417
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,900
/A South American Idol

418
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,200
/He's a suspicious bird

419
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,400
/Who said that about me?

420
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,000
- /A very vicious bird
- /I'll have you rotisseried

421
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,700
/I'm a feathery freak
/With a beak

422
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,000
/A bird murderer

423
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,700
/You think you're badder than me?
/I never heard of ya

424
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,300
/I'm evil,
/I'll fill your cheese balls with weevils

425
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,800
/I poop on people
/and I blame it on seagulls

426
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,300
It was him.

427
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,700
- /He's a nasty bird
- /I'm invincible

428
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,100
- /He's ghastly
- /I'm un-mince-able

429
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,600
/I'm unwashable, unrinseable

430
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,300
/Like an abandoned school
/I have no principle

431
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,700
/All of you Brazilian birds

432
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,100
/All 80 million birds

433
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,600
/I'll tell you what I'm going to do

434
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,400
/I'm going to make you

435
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,200
Shut up, now. Shut up!

436
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,500
It's just me.

437
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,900
/I will make you ugly...

438
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,500
/...too.

439
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,600
Hey!

440
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,300
Sweet nightmares.

441
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,900
Not cool, man!

442
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,500
Scary, but not cool!

443
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,700
Hey, are you okay?

444
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,500
No, I am definitely not okay!

445
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,900
Wait. What are you doing?

446
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,600
Getting out of here.

447
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,100
Are you going to help me or what?

448
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,900
Actually, all the survival guides say
to sit and wait, and help will come.

449
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,400
No one is coming!

450
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,800
We are on our own and if we just sit here,
we're going to die!

451
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,000
Yes! Yes!

452
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,200
Yes!

453
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,500
No!

454
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,600
Nigel! Get out of the way!

455
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,100
Hold on!

456
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,800
Stop! Stop!
Why don't you just open the door?

457
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,000
Are you kidding me?

458
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,800
What? It's just a
standard flip slide bolt.

459
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,700
Come on! Let's fly!

460
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,800
What are you doing?

461
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:03,200
- I can't.
- What? You can't what?

462
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,700
I can't fly!

463
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,300
You couldn't tell me this before now?

464
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,100
It didn't matter before now!

465
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,700
I hate you.

466
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,700
Is there anything else I need to know?

467
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,700
Yes, I can't fly, I pick my beak,
and once in a while I pee in the bird-bath.

468
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,800
Happy?

469
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,900
There they are!

470
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,200
We got to get out of here!

471
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,700
Just move! Move!

472
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,400
Wait, wait. Listen to me.

473
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,500
Flying may not be my thing,
but walking is.

474
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,400
Follow my lead. Inside leg, outside leg.

475
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,500
Yeah, okay, I got it.

476
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,200
Inside, outside, inside, outside!

477
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,600
Yes! Yes! Yes!

478
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,900
- Yes. Yes!
- Come on!

479
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,800
See? I'm bilingual, too!

480
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,300
This is great!

481
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,500
I'm chained to the only bird in the world
who can't fly!

482
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,000
Actually, there are about 40 species
of flightless birds.

483
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,500
- Duck!
- No, ducks can fly.

484
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,400
No! Duck!

485
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,600
Yes!

486
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,900
Yes!

487
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,300
Yes!

488
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,700
Yes!

489
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,600
Yes!

490
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,700
Hold on!

491
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,500
No!

492
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,700
No!

493
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,000
No!

494
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,600
Get out of here, you putrid poultry!

495
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
What was that?

496
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,800
A stick.

497
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,900
And that?

498
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,200
It's just a rock.

499
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,400
Right. Yeah.

500
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,300
Is that a spider on my back?

501
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,900
Will you quit it?

502
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,900
It's just a leaf. Turn around.

503
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,500
Leaf. Told you.

504
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Now, come on, we need to find
a safe place to spend the night.

505
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,800
Safe? Safe?

506
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,100
We are in the jungle.

507
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,200
You know when people say,
"It's a jungle out there"?

508
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,100
Well, I'm pretty sure
they don't mean it as a good thing.

509
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,200
Look, I hate to break it to you,
but this is where our kind naturally lives.

510
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,700
Hey, don't talk to me about nature.
I watch /Animal Planet.

511
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,900
I know all about the food chain.

512
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,600
You see?
Out here, I'm just an hors d'oeuvre.

513
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,700
Nothing more than a
feathery spring roll.

514
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,000
That is why we stay in the trees
and not on the ground.

515
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
After you.

516
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,700
No, I don't think so.

517
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:24,100
No. I would feel much more comfortable
in something man-made.

518
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,500
Hey, how about up there?

519
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,800
I can't believe
I have to drag your clumsy butt up there.

520
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,900
Drag me?

521
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,500
Watch and learn.

522
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,600
Blu! Just wait one...

523
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,400
Blu?

524
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,100
Who's dragging whose butt now?

525
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,200
Very funny.

526
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,800
You see? Who needs flying?

527
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,500
Birds. Birds need flying.

528
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,000
Flying is...

529
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,700
It's freedom
and not having to rely on anyone.

530
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,900
Don't you want that?

531
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,900
I don't know.
It sounds a little lonely.

532
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,500
Let's get some sleep.

533
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,300
I'm probably going to be up
for a little while.

534
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,800
Because I'm still on Minnesota time.

535
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,100
Good night.

536
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,900
Good night, Jewel.

537
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,900
Good night, Linda.

538
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,800
Excuse me, sir?

539
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,200
Have you seen my bird?

540
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,400
Have you seen my bird?

541
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:51,200
Excuse me?
Have you seen my bird?

542
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,300
Have you seen my bird? Blue feather.

543
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,300
Lady! American lady!

544
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,800
- Blu?
- Where?

545
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,600
Wow. I know where your birds are.

546
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,700
You found Blu? Are you sure?

547
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,800
It's his!

548
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,400
Let me see that.

549
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,300
You're right.

550
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,100
Okay. Where is he?

551
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,400
Come on, let's go! I'll take you to him.

552
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,500
No, no. Linda, wait.

553
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:02,400
We don't know this boy.
We can't trust him.

554
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,300
I have to trust him.

555
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,500
I don't have a choice.

556
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,400
Do you think I'm an idiot?

557
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,400
They were two birds
chained together in a cage.

558
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,800
How could you lose them?

559
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,800
They outsmarted us, boss.
But don't worry, we'll get them back.

560
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,600
I have a plan.

561
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,500
Great. What are you going to do?

562
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,400
Wander the city calling
"Here birdie, birdie. Here birdie"?

563
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,700
Well, anything sounds dumb
when you say it like that.

564
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,700
Okay. We have to get the birds
to the airport tonight.

565
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,900
But it's Carnaval.
All the roads will be blocked by the parade.

566
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,000
And that's why
I wanted to go this morning.

567
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,700
Nigel.

568
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,300
This bird is 10 times smarter
than the two of you combined.

569
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,100
Yeah, well, if he's so smart,
then why don't you put him in charge?

570
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,600
I am putting him in charge.

571
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,800
Stop suggesting things.

572
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,800
Go find them, Nigel.

573
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:29,800
If we can't get through the parade,
we'll have to be in the parade.

574
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,600
Are you sure
this is going to work?

575
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,500
Positive. Check out my math.

576
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,800
Yeah, that's comforting. Thank you.

577
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,400
Look, let's just get this chain broken.

578
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,700
Right. Then we can go and find Linda.

579
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,000
No, you can go find Linda.

580
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,800
Once this chain is off, I'm going to go
back to being free in the jungle. Deal?

581
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,900
Fine. Deal.

582
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,400
Nice try, brainiac.

583
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,300
I think something is watching us.

584
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:16,800
Be careful, Blu.
They might snuggle you to death.

585
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Come here.

586
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,400
Intruders!

587
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,500
Cut it out!

588
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,900
Now stop...

589
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,300
No! Don't!

590
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,400
Attack!

591
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,200
Help!

592
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,700
What's going on down there?

593
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,200
Go, go. Off with you.

594
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,400
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

595
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,100
I've told you a thousand times.

596
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,900
Manoela, Sofia, come
on now, listen to me.

597
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,900
Oh, yeah, right in the eye.

598
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,600
Precious, aren't they?

599
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,200
Kids? Seventeen of them
and one on the way.

600
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,600
Hey! He's not a maraca,
stop shaking him!

601
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,200
They're giving me gray feathers.

602
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,600
This papa needs a break.

603
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,900
So, you two lovebirds
headed for Carnaval?

604
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,800
- Lovebirds?
- We're more like acquaintance-birds.

605
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,500
Not even that, we're more like
chained-to-each-other birds.

606
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,600
Yeah. I mean, if...

607
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,100
What is it with this
kid and the feathers?

608
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,900
We have no idea. We're
having him tested.

609
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:28,400
So, do you think you could help us
get this thing off?

610
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,800
Lucky for you, you know Rafael,
and Rafael knows everyone.

611
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,100
Again with the eye.
Okay, want me to call your mother?

612
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,500
No!

613
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,700
Works every time.
They're scared to death of her.

614
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,800
Call me for what?

615
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,400
Eva, my love...

616
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,700
I must take this young
couple to see Luiz.

617
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,000
Luiz!

618
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,400
You don't fool me for a second.

619
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,500
You and your /amigo
just want to sneak off to Carnaval.

620
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,000
Carnaval.

621
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,800
That magical time when I met
the most beautiful bird in the world.

622
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,600
I still remember the song that was playing
when I first laid eyes on you.

623
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,100
/Tall and tan and
/young and lovely

624
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,000
/The girl from Ipanema
/goes walking

625
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,200
Come on, baby, sing it!

626
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:22,100
/And when she passes,
/each one she passes goes, ah!

627
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,400
Like a river of the sweetest honey.

628
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,300
I guess love is deaf, too.

629
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,300
Come here.

630
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,300
Okay. Take them to Luiz, but hurry back.

631
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,000
You are an angel.

632
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,100
I'll miss you my juicy little mango.

633
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,500
I'll miss you my pudgy papaya.

634
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:47,000
Hey! Marco! Carlos!
Put your brother down, now!

635
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I can't believe she actually let me go.

636
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,300
So, how far is this Luiz?

637
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,800
Not far. Thirty minutes
as the crow flies.

638
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,900
And how long as the macaw walks?

639
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,600
- Bobo here can't fly.
- But he's a bird.

640
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,500
Not all birds fly.

641
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,600
There are ostriches...

642
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,700
You're not an ostrich.

643
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,300
- Not technically, but...
- Wait.

644
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,900
My friends, I want to help,
but to walk the whole way...

645
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,000
It can't be done!

646
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,100
Where's Daddy?

647
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,100
- Daddy? Daddy?
- Come over here. Go back to your room.

648
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,200
But, hey.

649
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,300
We might as well give it a shot.
Let's go quickly.

650
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:20,000
No, don't look back. They sense fear.

651
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:47,100
What an adorable monkey.

652
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,000
Hey! My watch!

653
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,500
Hello, boys.

654
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,100
Seems like you've had a busy day.

655
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,400
What? This?

656
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,300
This is just some stuff we found.
Right, boys?

657
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

658
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,100
I'm not interested
in your nicked knick-knacks.

659
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,100
Your burgled baubles bore me.

660
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,700
There are two blue macaws out there

661
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,600
and I need your multitude of eyes
to help me find them.

662
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,900
Yeah? What's in it for us?

663
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,800
Well, that's a fair question.

664
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,500
Let's discuss it.

665
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,000
I certainly see your point, but what
could I possibly do for you in return?

666
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,300
Save me! Save me!

667
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,300
Well, that's a thought. Yeah.

668
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,000
But is it enough? I don't want
to feel like I'm cheating you.

669
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,600
Help me! Help me! No, no!

670
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,100
We'll do it, we'll do
it. Save me, please.

671
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,900
Save me!

672
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,200
All right, you've twisted my wing.

673
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,800
Deal.

674
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,900
Now then? Any more questions?

675
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,500
No? Good.

676
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,600
You will spread out and you will find
these macaws by the end of the day

677
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,900
or it's flying lessons for everyone!

678
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,200
Go!

679
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,400
Go do your monkey business.

680
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,900
I've changed my mind, yeah.

681
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,400
Maybe we can find a bus schedule
or something.

682
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,600
Come on, you're not
going to back out now.

683
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,500
Not in front of the lady.

684
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,400
Okay, yeah. Yeah, sure.

685
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,200
All right, that's the spirit.

686
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,700
You're sure you're up for this?

687
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,100
Yeah, yeah. I mean,

688
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,800
it's not like we're just hurling
ourselves off a mountain or something.

689
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,900
Right?

690
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,000
Actually that was
pretty much my entire plan.

691
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
What?

692
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,700
Don't worry, Blu, it's in your DNA.

693
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,200
And if our featherless friends can do it,
how hard can it be?

694
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,300
Wait, wait!

695
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
Mommy!

696
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,800
Fun, right?

697
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,200
Yeah. Fun.

698
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,700
Okay. I need you two to get closer.

699
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,400
Closer.

700
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,700
Closer.

701
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,700
Nice.

702
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,400
Now put your wings around each other.

703
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,100
- What?
- Come on,/amigo!

704
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,000
It's not like she's going to bite!

705
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,200
Will you?

706
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,600
We'll see.

707
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,300
Now,

708
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,500
you flap your right wing,

709
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,700
you flap your left wing,
and together you fly.

710
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,000
But this doesn't seem
aerodynamically possible.

711
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,500
You think too much.

712
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,000
Flying is not what you think up here,
it's what you feel in here.

713
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,500
And when you feel the rhythm
of your heart, it's like samba.

714
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,300
You fly!

715
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,800
See? It's easy!

716
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,900
Easy?

717
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,700
Easy for you to say, because from here

718
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,200
it looks really, really hard.

719
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,400
Hey, if you want to see Linda again,
this is the only way.

720
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,000
Okay. You're right.

721
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,500
- Yes, I am.
- This is for Linda.

722
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,700
- Right.
- Keep it simple.

723
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,200
- Easy breezy.
- Thrust, lift, drag...

724
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,400
- Come on! Let's go!
- Wait!

725
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,700
- Inside, outside, inside, outside.
- Inside, outside, inside, outside.

726
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,900
Come on, Blu! You can do it!

727
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,100
I can do it. I can do it.

728
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:52,700
I can do it.

729
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,100
I can't do it!

730
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,100
Not again!

731
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,600
- Am I dead?
- No!

732
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,400
We're still alive!

733
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,500
Wow! This is incredible.

734
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,500
Wow.

735
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,700
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

736
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,500
See what you've been missing?

737
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah.

738
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,200
All right, Blu, you're flying!

739
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,400
Sort of. Not really, but do you feel it?

740
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,300
Yes!

741
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,600
I do feel it.

742
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,000
No, no, Blu! Wait!

743
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,300
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

744
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,900
We're gonna die!

745
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,700
You did not feel it in here.

746
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,700
You think?

747
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:08,000
Let's catch a ride to Luiz.

748
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,300
Hurry, you two!

749
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,800
Okay.

750
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,100
Last of the species here.

751
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,200
Move it!

752
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,800
Hey. Wait up.

753
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,600
Come on, lovebirds!

754
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,100
You made it.

755
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,900
I would love to go five minutes
without almost getting killed.

756
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,100
Is that too much to ask?

757
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:31,200
For a bird who can't fly, yeah.

758
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,000
They're starting to close off the streets
for Carnaval.

759
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:45,000
You better be right, kid.
Because we're running out of time.

760
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,800
I'll never be able to get my car
through this crowd.

761
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,100
Don't worry, I'm on it.

762
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,100
Watch it!

763
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,800
Hey, kid, how did you get this bike?

764
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,100
- I traded it for your Jeep.
- What?

765
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,600
Yeah, it's in great condition.

766
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,500
Well, good condition!

767
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,200
Hey! Out of the way!

768
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,100
Look out!

769
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,100
Hold on!

770
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm going to chew through my own leg
if this doesn't come off soon.

771
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,800
Relax. If I know Luiz,
we're right where we want to be.

772
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,400
Hey! Rafi!

773
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,900
If it isn't the king of Carnaval!

774
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,300
Nico! Pedro! What up, family?

775
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,000
Where you been hiding yourself, bird?

776
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,400
Man, I thought you were dead.

777
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,900
Hold up! Rewind.

778
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,700
Ain't that the bird from the cage?

779
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,300
I think our love lessons
went down smooth.

780
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,500
You work fast.

781
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,800
Baby got beak.

782
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,600
You was locked up
and now you're rolling with a hot-wing.

783
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,000
I want to be like you.

784
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,500
No, it's not what you think.
We're just chained together.

785
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,000
Hey, I'm not judging you.

786
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,400
- Keep it spicy.
- Oh, yeah.

787
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
Hey, guys, we're looking for Luiz.
Have you seen him?

788
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,700
Yeah, I seen him, but you didn't,
because you just missed him.

789
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,800
He took the trolley back to the garage.

790
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,000
Great.

791
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,300
Relax, baby bird.
You could catch the next one.

792
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,800
Yeah, it's time to take
it to the next level.

793
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,100
What's wrong with this level?

794
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,900
Come on! This ain't the level.
The next level's the level.

795
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,400
You got to shake your tail feathers.

796
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,200
We got to get this chain off first.

797
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,600
Come on, lovebirds! You're in Rio!
You should enjoy it!

798
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Yeah! Live a little.

799
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,000
We got them.

800
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,500
Hey!

801
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,000
Welcome to paradise!

802
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,500
Some party, huh?

803
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,400
This is the coolest
place I've ever seen.

804
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,900
Despite all the obvious
health code violations.

805
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:19,100
I like you!
Nothing you say makes any sense.

806
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,600
All right, everyone, listen up!

807
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,400
Rafi has some special guests
from out of town

808
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,200
and let's show them some love,
because I don't think they get out much.

809
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,900
Everybody put their wings together
and clap them as loud as you can.

810
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:36,400
Flap them. Clap them.
I don't care, slap them.

811
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,200
/Party in the Ipanema, baby.

812
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,800
/I wanna party
/I wanna samba

813
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,600
/I wanna party
/I wanna samba

814
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,400
/I wanna party

815
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,400
- /And live my life
- /My life

816
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
- /I wanna party
- /Party

817
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,700
/And fly

818
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,700
/High! I'm gonna fly
/Fly just like a bird

819
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,900
/But you are a bird

820
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,900
/Oh, yeah, you're right
/So let me fly just like a rocket then

821
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,500
- /Okay
- /Fly so high

822
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,100
/Where I need to come down for oxygen

823
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:12,200
/'Cause once we start it
/Baby, ain't no, ain't no stopping then

824
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,700
/'Cause I just want to live my life
/and party

825
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,500
/All I want is to be free
/And rock my body

826
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,700
/Okay

827
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,100
/I've been around the world

828
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,300
/And I want to live my life in Rio

829
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,800
/'Cause I Rio,'cause I Rio realize

830
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,300
What are you doing?

831
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,900
I don't know.

832
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,300
All right, Blu!

833
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,600
/And fly!

834
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,300
/I'm that samba, samba master
/Master, master, master, master

835
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,700
/Push out sound from a ghetto blaster
/Blaster, blaster, blaster, blaster

836
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,300
Hey. She likes you.

837
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,200
What are you talking about?
Haven't you been listening?

838
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,000
No, but I've been watching.

839
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,900
Just be yourself. Go on.

840
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,500
- /I wanna samba
- /Party

841
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,200
- /I wanna party
- /Party

842

- /I want to party
- /Party

846
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,900
/And fly

847
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,600
You two are coming with me.

848
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,000
In your little monkey dreams.

849
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,500
Yeah.

850
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,000
That was meant for you.

851
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,800
Come on. Can we all just get along?

852
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,200
This isn't your fight, big-nose.

853
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,100
You mess with my friends,
you mess with me!

854
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,500
And us!

855
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,800
Yeah, little King Kong.

856
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,900
I don't know what's going on here.

857
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,000
Birds versus monkeys!

858
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,900
Get them!

859
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:33,200
Yippee-kai-yay, monkey man!

860
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,500
Yee-haw! Giddy-up!

861
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,900
Missed!

862
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,500
We got to go!

863
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,700
Need a lift?

864
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:14,400
Take that, you funky monkey!

865
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,000
- Thank you!
- Anytime!

866
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,300
That's what I'm talking about!

867
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,900
Man, we threw down!

868
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,900
Yeah, we threw down.

869
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,000
You guys were like fire and ice.

870
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,700
- Thunder and lightning!
- Hip and hop!

871
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,700
Cheese and sprinkles!

872
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,800
It's a Minnesota thing.

873
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:38,900
You see?
Nothing you say makes any sense.

874
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,100
Come on, follow me.

875
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,700
What?

876
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,600
But the birds were here.

877
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,900
Yeah, sure they were, kid.

878
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,100
I swear, the birds were right here.

879
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,000
- Well, how do you know?
- Because

880
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,400
I'm... I'm the one who took them.

881
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,700
You!

882
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,200
I didn't want to hurt anybody,
I needed the money.

883
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,500
But Fernando, I trusted you!

884
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,600
I know, but...

885
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,200
Man, that's good.

886
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,700
Hey, guys.

887
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,200
What are you doing here?

888
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,700
I just wanted to see
if you had any work for me.

889
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:25,700
Well, if you were here two hours ago,
you could've helped us load the...

890
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,300
- What?
- Shut up.

891
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,100
So, why are you guys
dressed for Carnaval?

892
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,100
So no one will notice us
when we smuggle these...

893
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,900
Shut up!

894
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,900
We made a float.

895
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,500
A float!

896
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,900
So you guys are going to the parade.
Can I come?

897
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,700
I'm a great dancer.

898
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:49,900
Can he come? Come on, please.
Three is better than two.

899
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,700
Fine. We got to hurry though.

900
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,700
I almost forgot.

901
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:59,600
Where did I put it?
I thought it was right here.

902
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,000
There it is.

903
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,500
Got it.

904
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,500
Let's go.

905
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,800
Hurry up, kid.

906
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,200
Can he ride on the plane with us, too?

907
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,400
Shut up!

908
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:14,300
No. We can't let them get on that plane.

909
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,100
You can drive a motorcycle, right?

910
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,500
You insult me.

911
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,100
No, I can't drive a motorcycle.

912
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,700
It's just like riding a snowmobile.

913
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,200
What happened?

914
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,300
Papa?

915
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,700
What happened?

916
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,900
Oh, no! Let me go.

917
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,700
Stop your chirping and talk to me!

918
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,000
No, no. I don't know anything. Help!

919
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,600
When I bite down on your head,
will it go "pop," or will it go "crack"?

920
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,700
Where are the cerulean birds?

921
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,900
That means blue, by the way.

922
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,000
They escaped. Went to Luiz.

923
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,400
Anything else?

924
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,500
They said you were very nice.

925
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,800
Did they?

926
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,000
Liar.

927
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,800
And handsome, too.

928
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:49,400
Never send a monkey to do a bird's job.

929
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,700
Don't worry. I got it.

930
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:21,400
There he goes. That's my boy.

931
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,100
Is it hot? I think I'm sweating.

932
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,200
I didn't even think that
was biologically possible, and yet, look.

933
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,400
Wow.

934
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,100
Yeah, that's your boy, all right.

935
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,100
Okay, so he needs a little help.

936
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,600
Come on, let's give him some.

937
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,600
Set the mood.

938
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:41,500
All right, look, I'm on it.
I know how to set the mood. Check it out.

939
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,100
/Get a, Get a, Get a
/Get a girl

940
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,600
/Get, Get, Get
/Get a girl

941
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,900
/Take her, take her to the floor
/Show her, show her how you roll

942
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,200
/Drop it, drop it, drop it low
/Drop it low, drop-drop it low

943
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,600
What kind of mood is that?

944
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,400
Pedro, Pedro, a little too aggressive.

945
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,400
I'm not hating on your creativity,
but I think I got this one.

946
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,900
Follow my lead.

947
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,500
Now, that's more like it.

948
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,200
/Wasn't really thinking
/Wasn't looking

949
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:23,200
/Wasn't searching for an answer

950
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,900
/In the moonlight

951
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,300
/When I saw your face

952
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,300
Wow! What a beautiful sunset.

953
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,800
Yeah.

954
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,500
Blu.

955
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,300
Down here. Just tell her,
"You have beautiful eyes."

956
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,900
That's good. Great idea.

957
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,500
I have beautiful eyes.

958
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,300
Yeah, okay. Sure, they're nice.

959
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:55,500
No, her eyes. Her eyes.

960
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,600
Right, yeah. Your eyes,
your eyes are great, not mine.

961
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,900
I mean, mine are okay.

962
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:04,000
But yours, I bet
you can see right through them.

963
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,400
Blu!

964
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,600
Just tell her how you feel.

965
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,600
- Jewel.
- Yeah.

966
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,000
I've been wanting to tell you that I...

967
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,300
That I...

968
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,100
How sweet. You're getting choked up.

969
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:25,300
You're choking! Okay! All right!

970
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,900
Come on, Blu, move with me.
Stay with me, Blu.

971
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:33,000
One more, come on. One more time!

972
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,900
Yep, that's my boy.

973
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:55,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Luiz's garage.

974
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,000
- After you.
- No, no, you first.

975
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,200
Please, I insist.

976
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,700
Okay.

977
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,900
Guess this is it.

978
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,400
Yeah. Quite an adventure.

979
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,900
End of the line.

980
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,000
Yes.

981
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,600
Guess things like this
don't happen in Tiny-soda.

982
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,000
Tiny-soda?

983
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,700
- Wait, Minnesota.
- Yeah.

984
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,100
That's very good.
That's very funny actually.

985
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,600
Luiz! Are you here, Luiz? Hey, buddy!

986
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:30,100
I got some friends I want you to meet.

987
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,600
Go!

988
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:36,900
Inside, outside, inside, outside!

989
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,000
I got you's good.

990
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,100
What?

991
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:51,300
I could've ripped your throats out,
but I didn't.

992
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,600
But I could've.

993
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,000
Hey, Luiz! Stop scaring my friends.

994
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,500
Hey, Rafi, come here!

995
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,500
Where you've been?

996
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,900
You look good.

997
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,200
Wait. Luiz is a bulldog?

998
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,200
You got something against dogs?

999
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,700
I do when they're drooling on me.

1000
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,500
It's a medical condition.

1001
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,300
No, hey,/amigo, we really need you.

1002
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,800
- She's mean, bro.
- Luiz, come on, please, please.

1003
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,600
We need your help.

1004
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,600
I think I know what to do.

1005
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,300
Are you sure this is safe?

1006
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,900
Sure. There's nothing to it.

1007
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,100
Now, if something goes wrong,
scream really loud!

1008
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,900
Because I can't hear too good
with this thing on.

1009
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,800
Hey, Rafi! Get the switch, please.

1010
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:51,100
Don't worry. He's a professional.

1011
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,800
Now, try not to move!

1012
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:02,300
I can't really see out
of this thing, either!

1013
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:26,300
Hey! Where did you go?

1014
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,500
Gross.

1015
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,200
But I'm free.

1016
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,200
Jewel! Jewel! We're free!

1017
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,800
Slimy, but free.

1018
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,000
Contaminated probably, but free.

1019
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,100
Can you believe it's finally...

1020
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,600
...over.

1021
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,100
Yeah!

1022
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,500
Come on, guys, let's go!

1023
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:09,200
What are we standing around for?
It's Carnaval!

1024
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,900
Oh, yeah!

1025
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,100
Yep.

1026
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,900
I know just how you feel.

1027
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,100
Watching them up there

1028
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:27,500
makes you want to chase them
and grab them in your mouth

1029
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:32,500
and bite their heads off, huh?

1030
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,900
I'm just kidding, bro.

1031
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:39,800
Yeah, chasing them is plenty.

1032
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,500
/I'm flying, flying just like a bird!

1033
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:56,100
Jewel, but you are a bird!

1034
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,900
Hey! Where you going?

1035
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,500
Blu?

1036
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,000
Blu, what's wrong?

1037
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,300
Nothing. Everything is perfect.

1038
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:14,600
You'll be off to the rainforest, I'll be
back with Linda, just like we planned.

1039
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,500
Hey, birds!
Stop yapping and start flapping!

1040
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,600
Let's go!

1041
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,500
I guess, I thought, maybe...

1042
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,600
What? That you'd come to Minnesota?

1043
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,400
Great, I guess I'll knit you a scarf.

1044
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,900
No, that's not what I meant.

1045
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,000
Look, Jewel,
I can't spend my life

1046
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,500
walking around following you
wherever you're going.

1047
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:37,400
Hey, it's not my
fault you can't fly.

1048
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,800
Awkward.

1049
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,200
Okay, okay.

1050
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,300
You know what? This is good.
Just clear the air.

1051
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,300
Just be completely honest
with each other.

1052
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:48,100
You want honesty?
Fine, I can be honest.

1053
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,300
I don't belong here.

1054
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:52,200
In fact, I never wanted to come here
in the first place.

1055
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,300
And... And...

1056
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,200
And you know what?

1057
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,500
I hate samba.

1058
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,700
Hey! That's a little too far.

1059
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,600
Make the mean bird take it back.

1060
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,200
Yeah, I said it.

1061
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,600
Every song sounds exactly the same.

1062
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,900
/Tico, taco, ya, ya, ya
/Tico, taco, ya, ya, ya

1063
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,000
I'm tico, taco out of here.

1064
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,400
Fine! See you around, pet!

1065
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,000
No, wait, wait. Come back!

1066
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,300
You belong together!
You are Juliet to his Romeo!

1067
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:28,000
Sure, they both die in the end,
but you get my point!

1068
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,700
Young love. Always so melodramatic.

1069
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,100
All right, boys, go after her.

1070
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,600
Blu! Come back here. Come on!

1071
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,800
Yeah! I'm ready for Carnaval!

1072
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,400
Who wants to ride in my

1073
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,400
fruit.

1074
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,100
You left without me.

1075
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,800
That's messed up.

1076
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,700
Jewels! Jewels!

1077
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,500
Wait up!

1078
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,000
Going somewhere, pretty bird?

1079
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,400
Yeah. I was just on my way
to claw your eyes out!

1080
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:12,000
Jewel!

1081
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,100
Temper, temper.

1082
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,600
Now come along, my dear.

1083
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,700
We're going to a parade.

1084
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:22,200
Everybody loves a parade.

1085
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,300
Let go of me!

1086
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,900
Hey! Get back here!

1087
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,200
Ain't nobody messing with a friend
of Pedro, I ain't having it!

1088
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,400
It's on!

1089
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,200
Did you see the talons on that guy?

1090
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,300
Talons?

1091
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,800
Maybe it's on next time.

1092
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,600
- Help!
- Help! Little help!

1093
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,300
Rafael, quit following me.

1094
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,800
You're going in the wrong direction.
Isn't Carnaval that way?

1095
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,400
I'm not going to Carnaval.

1096
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,000
No, I'm going home.

1097
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,700
But I thought you loved Carnaval.

1098
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,800
I do. But I love my family much more.

1099
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,100
And that's a choice I made with this.

1100
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,800
Not with this.

1101
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,600
- Blu!
- Hey, Blu! Blu!

1102
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,700
I was flying
and then I saw this big cockatoo!

1103
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,100
With big ninja talons!

1104
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,200
This cockatoo was ugly!
Anyway, that's not the point.

1105
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,600
And then Jewel was there,
and he snatched Jewel up.

1106
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,100
Like, he snatched her up.
And then he was like,

1107
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,900
"You're coming with me,
you little princess."

1108
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,600
And Jewel was like,

1109
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,000
"I ain't your princess, leave me alone."

1110
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,700
- And I was like, "What?"
- Then he was like, "What?"

1111
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,400
Stop! Just tell me what happened.

1112
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,700
He got Jewel, man!

1113
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,100
And he's taking her to the parade.

1114
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,400
This is all my fault.

1115
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,400
Let's fly.

1116
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,800
Carnaval, here we come!

1117
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,100
Hey, dog, I'm drowning back here!

1118
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:46,100
You will get wet on this ride!

1119
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,000
Come on, come on, come on.

1120
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,100
Where are these guys?

1121
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,600
Yes. Nice.

1122
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,000
Very nice.

1123
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,200
Marcel!

1124
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,900
Marcel!

1125
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,200
Oh, boy.

1126
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,500
We're a chicken!

1127
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,900
Come on, Fernando! Dance!

1128
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,600
Idiots.

1129
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,600
Excuse me.

1130
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,100
Coming through!

1131
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,300
Watch your feet.

1132
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,600
Whoops! Sorry.

1133
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,000
Go ahead. Come in.

1134
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,900
Wait. Stop, please.

1135
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:38,500
Performers only.

1136
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,200
Wow.

1137
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,200
/Cyanopsitta spixii.

1138
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,700
Tulio?

1139
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:11,700
Linda. I was just...

1140
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:24,200
I look ridiculous, don't I?

1141
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,200
Sorry.

1142
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,300
The parade. It's about to start.

1143
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,000
Okay.

1144
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,200
Go ahead.

1145
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,900
Okay, just follow my lead.

1146
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:50,300
Act naturally.

1147
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,200
Are you okay?

1148
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,400
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1149
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,500
- Blu?
- Blu!

1150
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,400
Blu! Blu!

1151
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,800
What? Wait, wait! No, no.

1152
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,700
I am looking for a bluebird. Birdo?

1153
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,500
Birdo! Yes!

1154
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,000
Okay.

1155
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,600
Wait! What are you doing?

1156
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,800
Tulio!

1157
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,400
Hey! Let me out!

1158
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,900
Tulio!

1159
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:48,000
This is not good. This
is not good. This is...

1160
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,100
Cheese and sprinkles.

1161
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,800
Okay, you can bring me down now!

1162
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,200
I think we're done here!

1163
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,600
I think they like my moves.

1164
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,300
Hey. Keep dancing, egg-boy.

1165
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,600
One down and one to go.

1166
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,600
You'll never find him.

1167
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,300
He's already gone.

1168
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,200
I don't need to find him.

1169
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,700
He'll find you.

1170
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,000
This is the spit!

1171
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,300
Yeah, baby!

1172
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,000
Now, I could get my freak on!

1173
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,100
Luiz, please!

1174
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:44,200
Rescue first. Freak later.

1175
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:49,700
- Come on!
- Out of my way, people!

1176
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,600
All right, guys!

1177
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,400
I'll fly ahead and look for Jewel.

1178
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,400
Hello, ladies.

1179
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,600
Mr. Big-nose! Hold up!

1180
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,900
What?

1181
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,700
Linda? Excuse me. Excuse me.

1182
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,300
Linda!

1183
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,500
Linda!

1184
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,700
In English!

1185
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,900
Linda! Linda!
You've got to shake your tushy!

1186
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:29,100
No! We don't shake our tushies
in Minnesota!

1187
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:33,500
Hot dog! Coming through!

1188
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,200
Blu!

1189
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,600
Tulio! Tulio! I saw Blu!

1190
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,100
What?

1191
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:47,400
Hold on, Blu! I'm coming for you!

1192
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,500
Blu!

1193
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,900
Blu!

1194
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,300
Linda!

1195
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,500
Linda?

1196
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,000
Wait!

1197
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,800
Blu, we found them!

1198
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,900
She's on some weird chicken float!

1199
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,700
Come on!

1200
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,900
Let's go get Jewel.

1201
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:23,000
Wait, Blu! Where are you going?

1202
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:28,000
Okay.

1203
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,700
I saw Blu! He's riding on a bulldog!

1204
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,200
What?

1205
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,500
There they are! That's the float!

1206
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:50,700
That float is a crime in itself!

1207
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,400
There he is!

1208
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,500
- Hey, Jewel.
- Blu!

1209
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,900
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- No.

1210
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:25,600
No, Blu, you can't be here.
You have to go. Nigel...

1211
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,200
Hello, pretty bird.

1212
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,900
So kind of you to join
our little soire.

1213
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,500
Come on. You really think I came alone?

1214
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,800
I got three of the roughest, meanest

1215
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,300
craziest birds in all of Rio
right behind me.

1216
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,800
You heard that, guys? We're saved!

1217
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,900
- That's right. That's right.
- I think he means us.

1218
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:51,300
Love. It's such a powerful
and stupid thing.

1219
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:01,700
Yes. Well done, Nigel.

1220
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,500
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1221
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,300
Out of the way.

1222
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:12,000
Sorry. Wait! Wait!

1223
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,500
We actually made it! Hey, Marcel!

1224
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,900
Can we do this again next year?
Please? Please?

1225
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:20,100
Could I drive next year, too?

1226
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:23,700
Wait! Come back!

1227
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,600
Get in!

1228
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:40,200
I don't know how I got up here,
but I ain't never coming down!

1229
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,800
Come on, kid.

1230
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:00,200
I'm gonna get you guys out of here.

1231
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,900
- What do you think you're doing?
- Nothing.

1232
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:07,700
You shouldn't have done that.
Come on.

1233
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,000
Just forget him!

1234
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,400
Get the birds!

1235
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,200
They're getting away.

1236
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:27,300
We'll see about that.

1237
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,100
Watch out!

1238
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,300
We did it, boys.

1239
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,500
- Yes! We did it.
- We're the best!

1240
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,300
Is that a float?

1241
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,900
Wow! Look at the detail on that thing.

1242
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:49,700
Pull up you, idiot! Pull up!

1243
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,800
Blu! Blu!

1244
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,000
Oh, Blu.

1245
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:30,300
Sorry, Eva,
I'm not gonna be home for dinner.

1246
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,600
What are you doing?

1247
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:42,100
I'm gonna pop this cage open
like a soda can.

1248
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,200
Now, that's popping!

1249
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,300
Hurry. We got to help the others.

1250
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,200
I'm a pretty bird, I'm a pretty bird.
Who's a pretty bird? I'm a pretty bird.

1251
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,000
Pretty bird, I'm a pretty bird.

1252
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,800
Come on!

1253
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:04,700
I'm out!

1254
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,400
The light!

1255
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,300
Go! Go! Go!

1256
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,000
Freedom!

1257
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,900
Geronimo!

1258
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,700
Come on! Come on!
We need to get out!

1259
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:41,400
Wait, wait, wait!

1260
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:47,100
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

1261
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:52,900
We'll figure this out together. Right?

1262
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,800
Let him go!

1263
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:59,700
Jewel!

1264
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,600
My wing.

1265
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,700
Pity.

1266
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:08,900
Now we have two useless,
flightless birds.

1267
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,400
Not cool, man. Not cool!

1268
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:29,800
We're going down!

1269
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,800
- Okay, okay.
- Rock, paper, scissors...

1270
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,600
Chute!

1271
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,700
/Hasta la vista, losers!

1272
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,900
Hey! Wait for us!

1273
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:42,000
Cannonball!

1274
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,600
Blu!

1275
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,900
No!

1276
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:05,300
Blu, you're crazy! What are you doing?

1277
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:07,000
I'm not gonna let you go!

1278
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:13,400
We're chained-to-each-other birds,
remember?

1279
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,000
Wow.

1280
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,200
Blu! You're flying!

1281
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,900
Yeah!

1282
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,400
I'm flying! I'm really flying.

1283
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:45,700
You're right, I'm not an ostrich.
I'm not an ostrich!

1284
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,800
What?

1285
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,200
Dad! Look!

1286
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:06,400
Idiots.

1287
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,000
Linda!

1288
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,200
Blu?

1289
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,800
It's Blu! Look, Tulio, it's Blu!

1290
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,500
And he's flying.

1291
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,300
My Blu is flying!

1292
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:26,500
He's flying.

1293
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,700
Here, let me see.

1294
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,300
Don't worry.

1295
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:52,500
I'll take care of you.

1296
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:25,600
That's my big, brave boy.

1297
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:41,600
/All the birds of a feather

1298
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,900
/Do what we love most of all

1299
