1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,951
Whoa, Wilbur! Here I go!

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,476
I'm running pretty good now.
I'm gonna jump.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,553
Oh, I got wings and I'm flying!

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,951
TriStar Pictures,
where anything can happen.

5
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,552
Is your diaphragm in?

6
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,550
Okay, now let me see
if I got this straight.

7
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,555
Santa Claus is real,
but ghosts aren't real.

8
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,393
Cowboys are real,
but witches aren't real.

9
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,195
Dinosaurs aren't real,
and monsters used to be real.

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,198
Or was it the other way around?
I gotta listen more.

11
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,155
Because it's dark doesn't mean monsters
are coming out. These are my toys.

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,789
The same toys that...

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,993
I don't remember it having batteries,
but I'm sure that it's fine.

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,714
I'm sure that there's a...
Oh, oh.

15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,392
Oh, my God!

16
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,789
Monsters!

17
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,758
There's monsters in my room!

18
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,231
Maybe I should get
under the covers now.

19
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,119
- I have to get that.
- He'll stop.

20
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,594
- No, he won't stop.
- All right.

21
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,358
- Help! Monsters!
- I'll do it.

22
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,995
No, don't read
your accounting magazines.

23
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,196
- Why not?
- It gets you out of the mood.

24
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,000
Monsters! Monsters!

25
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,553
You behave.

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,754
Okay, Mike, I'm coming.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,752
- Monsters!
- Monsters?

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,992
There's no monsters.
See? Do you see any monsters?

29
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,872
Well, yeah.

30
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,275
It was Popeye.
Yeah, he was the one.

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,275
I'll take that Gumby and I'll knock
him from here to kingdom come.

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,757
I think my daddy likes these toys
more than I do.

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,749
Who else? Pee-wee? No.

34
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,434
I wonder if he'll do
the flying turd gag now.

35
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,756
Watch out, Mikey, it's a flying turd!

36
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,193
- Go to bed.
- You're crazy.

37
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,398
- Good night, honey.
- Good night. I'll tuck myself in.

38
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,313
- Is that good?
- Why did I call you in here?

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,951
Oh, come on, Mollie!

40
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,871
I told you not to read this.
Now get up. Get up, honey.

41
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,350
- Oh, I can't.
- Why?

42
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,388
I got him to go to sleep. We never
get to do it anymore. Please?

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,551
Please get up, honey.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,756
- I'm sleeping.
- I know.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,798
You wouldn't have any fun doing it
while I'm sleeping.

46
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,349
Well, it's never stopped us before.

47
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,669
Hey, what's going on out there?
Am I hearing things?

48
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,478
Is somebody there?

49
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,799
- I know where to go, stick with me.
- Yeah, bright idea. Now we're lost.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,230
- Let's go where they're going.
- I been there.

51
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,996
Who is it? Who is it?
What do you want? Go away!

52
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,551
Tail, don't fail me now.

53
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,752
- We're the guys. We're the winners.
- I think I can.

54
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,635
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

55
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,400
We're in. We're making it.
We're doing it!

56
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,469
Come on, let's go. Keep going.
Keep moving, guys. Please.

57
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,148
- I don't think I can.
- As long as one of us do.

58
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,958
Come on, buddy, help me out.

59
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,955
Oh, no! It's the tadpole squad.

60
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,549
You can't bully me.
You can't get through this diaphragm!

61
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,596
Guys, I found a way through!
Over here by the rim.

62
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,796
Come on, follow me!

63
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,996
Yes!

64
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,953
Hey, buster, how'd you get in here?
This is my womb.

65
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,798
- Get out of here!
- Here we go.

66
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,951
- You know why I'm here.
- Stop that!

67
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,077
- Give it up.
- Stop doing that!

68
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,271
Let me in, baby. Let me in.

69
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,988
Come on, mama. Come on, hot mama.

70
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,434
You're a hot mama!

71
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,429
Hot mama!

72
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,551
Yes! Yes!

73
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,551
Well, here I am.
All conceived and nowhere to go.

74
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,149
You missed. Go wide!

75
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,478
Look out! Missed him.

76
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,759
Hi, honey.

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,149
Hi, babe.

78
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,989
Hi, honey.

79
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,356
- What'd you get for me?
- This isn't for you.

80
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,990
This is for you. It is a...

81
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,552
- Don't you think he's a little young?
- That hat's never gonna fit me.

82
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,320
- You tell him.
- I'm not telling him about it.

83
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,714
- You're the guy.
- Forget it.

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,832
No. When we have a girl,
I will explain it to her.

85
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,470
Oh, brother!
All right. Here goes.

86
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,157
Mike, this is a potty, okay? When
you want to take a piss you do it...

87
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,998
Don't say piss.

88
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,390
When you want to take
a whiz, you do...

89
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,393
See a man about a horse?
Drain the snake? What do I say?

90
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,874
Pee pee.

91
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,556
- Pee pee's a wimp word.
- No, pee pee is easy for him to say.

92
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,593
When you want to take a pee pee,
you do it in here.

93
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,990
And you do this.
You take it out, okay?

94
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,679
- Oh, come on.
- What?

95
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,117
Dad, who's kidding who?

96
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,709
In the same token,
when you take a dump...

97
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,796
Poo poo.

98
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,429
This is a joke, right?

99
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,191
I know it sounds disgusting,
but you gotta trust me on this, okay?

100
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,432
You want me to take a dump
outside my diaper?

101
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,392
- He doesn't like it.
- He does too.

102
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,950
- He doesn't like it.
- We just have to make it fun for him.

103
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,752
Come along and be my potty boy

104
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,520
Come along and be my potty boy

105
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,234
Is this an appropriate subject
for a musical?

106
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,195
And you can potty too
Yes, you

107
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,198
My girl likes to potty all the time

108
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,352
Potty all the time

109
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,552
You got to fight for your right

110
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,559
To potty

111
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,792
You got to fight for your right

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,349
To potty

113
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,111
- He doesn't like it.
- He likes it.

114
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,632
I don't care. I ain't pooping
in that thing. I got my standards.

115
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,558
- Your keys!
- Toss them.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,956
Yo, thanks, babe.

117
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,750
- Do you believe?
- You were lucky with the keys.

118
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,755
I was starting to think
I could really love Brad.

119
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,838
Then I noticed this face he made.
Kind of like...

120
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,838
If I said, "What do you want
to do?", there'd be this face.

121
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,191
Or, "How'd you like that movie?"
It's just this face that says:

122
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,998
"I don't know. What do you want?"

123
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,909
Then I had this flash of having kids
and the kids making that face.

124
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,838
And then I knew it was over.

125
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,549
You are deranged.
You know that, don't you?

126
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,356
You know what? If you want a boy,
you eat more sodium-rich food.

127
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,712
- Lf you want a girl, eat more dairy.
- Really? Who says?

128
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,912
- I read it.
- In the The National Enquirer?

129
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,599
I think The Star.

130
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,988
If you have a preference, act now.
Those sex organs are forming soon.

131
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,877
Let's see, two arms, two legs
and two mouths?

132
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,152
D and what comes up? Dog.

133
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,796
Yeah, yeah. I know all about
computers. Scoot over, girls.

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,551
I got a lot of work to do here.
Let's see. I'll just try this one.

135
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,911
And let's see.
What do we get? A jar.

136
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,157
Beautiful. I'm good at this.
I ought to get a job here.

137
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,312
- What are you girls up to?
- Nothing!

138
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,078
What's going on in here?

139
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,279
- I'm getting a funny feeling.
- So this is how grownups get so tall.

140
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,994
We were just finishing up
the Margolis account here.

141
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,117
The Margolis account, huh?

142
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,517
You're gonna send Margolis
a spreadsheet with pictures?

143
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,030
- Tickle, tickle, tickle.
- Something funny is going on here.

144
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,229
What's that?

145
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,755
What's up, my man?

146
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,952
- It looks like a kid.
- It looks like a kid.

147
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,197
I can see that! What is he
doing here? This is not a nursery!

148
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,358
This is the first time I've done this.
It was an emergency.

149
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,597
It was an emergency.
I see what you're up to.

150
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,998
You have a son and you're pregnant,
so you get special consideration.

151
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,998
No, I would never ask
for special consideration.

152
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,795
Let me tell you something.
Accountancy is filled with hardship.

153
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,800
It's sacrifice.
If you wanted something easy...

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,798
...why didn't you become a dental
hygienist or a car rental person?

155
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,749
When I had a bleeding ulcer
and I came out of the anaesthetic...

156
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,354
Somebody's loud and opinionated.
Boy!

157
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,352
No. The first thing I said was:

158
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,872
"Where's my adding machine? Where's
my calculator?" That's what I said!

159
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,877
And let me tell you something else.

160
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,956
Here, shoes, have a drink.

161
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,199
You mess with my mother,
you mess with me.

162
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,758
So how did you arrive
at this figure for your tips?

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,353
I guessed.

164
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,879
You kept track for a period of time
and did a projected estimate.

165
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,348
I made it up.

166
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,953
You made it up?

167
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,597
Now, as a flight instructor
you earned...

168
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,473
...$9212?

169
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,716
Really? Hey, that's pretty good.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,309
- You realize that that's only...
- 177.

171
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,239
177 dollars a week.

172
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,750
- It's not my main job.
- You spend most of your time doing it.

173
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,758
He just said it's not his main job.
Cut him some slack.

174
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,236
Since I married, I haven't flown.
I'll never work for an airline.

175
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,952
At this rate there are a lot
of things you won't be doing.

176
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,630
Unlike your son, Stuart,
who's got a plethora of opportunities.

177
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,515
What about Stuart? It's about you,
Mollie and your income tax.

178
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,796
Every two weeks
he calls Mollie for money.

179
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,919
Don't worry. He'll be all right
as soon as he settles down.

180
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,238
He has a degree in accounting, which is
like money in the bank. Unlike you.

181
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,908
What do you say we go out
and get some Carvel?

182
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,310
I got the time if you got the diapers.

183
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,751
Come on, Mike. Come on. Come on.

184
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,195
- I can't believe you did that.
- What did I say?

185
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,630
Ma, you are forever on his case.

186
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,353
He's a slob, he's belligerent.

187
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,552
He has the earning capacity
of an illiterate immigrant.

188
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,399
But I won't say anything
if that's what you want.

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,718
That's what I want.

190
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,556
That's your baby sister, Julie,
in there. She's kicking.

191
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,150
Now, wait a minute.
My little sister is in my juice cup?

192
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,954
You want to feel it? Here.

193
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,150
- Give me your hand.
- Oh, in there.

194
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,952
Don't you hate it when your head
is caught in your placenta?

195
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,948
I know. Let's play her
a little song, Mom.

196
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,151
This was always good for me.

197
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,155
Oh, now I'll never get
that tune out of my head.

198
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,079
When I have this new baby girl,
I'm gonna need your help, okay?

199
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,992
- And you know why?
- Tell me.

200
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,959
Because you're gonna
be Julie's big brother.

201
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,589
All right! Lay one on me.

202
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,592
- Night-night, honey.
- Night-night.

203
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,354
Remember, you're gonna
be her big brother.

204
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,151
I'm gonna be a big brother.

205
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,155
I'm gonna be a big brother.

206
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,398
Okay, that feels pretty good.

207
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,756
Here we go. In the...

208
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,428
Not in the nose!
Okay, bottoms up.

209
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,556
Do you believe what they're asking
for teddy bears? It's a crime.

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,991
Well, I think we got everything.

211
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,596
Teddy bear, teething rings,
P.J. Sparkles.

212
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,558
Yes, I'll kiss you.

213
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,556
Here you go, Ace. Keep the change.

214
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,319
All right, baby, here we go. Gum
this down. No, there's no salt on it.

215
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,557
Hey, punk! Get your own toy.
All right, that's it.

216
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,469
I'll rip your lungs out! Give it
to me! What are you smiling at?

217
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,678
I guess you never messed with
anybody's big brother before.

218
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,915
Give it!

219
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,394
There you go. Take that.

220
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,157
Here you go, baby. Yeah, you can
put it back in your mouth.

221
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,558
I love you so much.
I'll never let anybody hurt you.

222
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,155
It looks like I got
my work cut out for me.

223
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,079
What did I tell you?
Look at this mess you got us into.

224
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,959
I told you to take 48th.
You should have taken 48th!

225
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,593
48th is just as bad.

226
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,189
Take a quick left.
We'll shoot over to 46th.

227
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,238
Poor Daddy, hanging out
with buttholes all day long.

228
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,556
You didn't take the left!

229
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,751
Want to think about
getting toys in here?

230
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,276
I mean, it's lonely in the front seat.

231
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,556
I'll just push this.
That doesn't work.

232
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,593
There we go. There's something.
I think I broke it.

233
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,718
There it goes, right back on.
He didn't even see me.

234
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,996
Pull over.
I can walk faster than this.

235
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,395
All right, fine. Walk.
That's...

236
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,914
Two dollars. Here you go.

237
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,230
Wait. My kid must have
pushed the button!

238
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,431
Too bad. Don't bring him to work.

239
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,358
Oh, man!

240
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,474
Did you push the button?

241
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,353
Yeah. I think I did.

242
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,313
Want some cookie?
It's a little moist but take a bite.

243
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,797
- Did you bring the shoebox?
- What shoebox?

244
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,230
- Stop fighting.
- Did you look in the closet?

245
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,357
You know what I'm talking about.

246
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,548
All right. Okay. All right.
Come on. All right, all right!

247
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,550
Now, let's discuss
this bad business loan.

248
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,959
Basically, their Uncle Ernie...

249
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,153
...convinced them that it'd be a great
idea to call their restaurant...

250
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,349
...Eat Me Raw.

251
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,399
It was a great idea. It was gonna
have sushi, steak tartar...

252
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,192
...and raw vegetables.

253
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,755
- Crudities.
- Exactly. You know.

254
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,393
It had a quixotic quality.

255
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,672
People thought
it was an X-rated movie house.

256
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,758
- But they still wanted to eat there.
- Everybody was offended.

257
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,951
Yes, but they still
wanted to eat there.

258
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,550
- Are you okay?
- I think I'm just going into labour.

259
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,749
That's it. It's time
to blow this pop stand.

260
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,595
Jeez, I'm all cramped.
And this thing!

261
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,950
- Do you want us to reschedule?
- No, no.

262
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,390
You know, these things take hours,
believe me.

263
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,639
All right, let's discuss
this $1200 loss.

264
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,354
- I believe that was the salmon.
- Salmon?

265
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,755
The whole idea of sushi
is that it's fresh.

266
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,670
I ate at a five-star restaurant last
week. And they gave me frozen sushi.

267
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,711
- I don't think so.
- I believe so. Cold.

268
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,356
You're so naive
when it comes to frozen sushi.

269
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,876
This'll teach me to accessorize.

270
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,595
Did Uncle Ernie have any experience
in the restaurant business?

271
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,549
No.

272
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,639
Ernie was more of an idea man.

273
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,158
That's giving him a lot of credit.

274
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,554
Do you have the books?

275
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,115
- The books. Yeah, books.
- What do you mean?

276
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,039
Papers with numbers on them!
Debits and credits!

277
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,629
- We don't have any of that!
- Do not yell at him!

278
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,430
Ernie was an idiot! It was a stupid
idea and they lost their shirts!

279
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,319
So just allow the fucking deduction!

280
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,955
I heard life is short,
but this is ridiculous.

281
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,877
Don't be alarmed.
Now, your baby is in distress.

282
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,635
- What?! What's wrong?
- We're going to do a cesarean.

283
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,877
- Rona! Where is she?
- She's right through there.

284
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,999
Hey, Mikey. You're gonna
be a big brother, doll!

285
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,275
You know what, Rona?

286
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,876
I'm just the right kid for the job.

287
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,756
- Did my husband get here yet?
- We called him. He's coming.

288
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,949
Clamp.

289
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,195
- Honey?
- James, the baby's in trouble.

290
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,635
She's okay. She's coming right out.

291
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,718
Well, at least I've achieved
most of my goals.

292
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,314
Sponge. Get that.

293
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,516
Honey, everything's good.

294
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,516
Scissors.

295
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,276
It's okay.

296
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,436
Look at that. Interesting.

297
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,358
Almost there. Just a bit longer.

298
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,194
- Bladder retractor.
- Educational.

299
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,954
- Hold this bladder, please.
- It's kind of...

300
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,509
Let's get this bladder.

301
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,151
I'm fine. It's...

302
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,758
I guess this is the end.

303
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,353
Here she comes.

304
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,992
No! My neck! My neck!
Hey, you with the scissors!

305
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,992
Cut me some slack here!

306
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,189
There you go.

307
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,350
Jeez! For crying out loud!

308
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,153
Is she really okay?

309
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,475
She's fine.

310
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,758
How about him?

311
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,718
He'll be all right.

312
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,148
There you go.

313
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,751
Oh, my poor, sweet baby.

314
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm gonna take
extra special care of you.

315
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,152
Hey, you look a lot better
from the outside.

316
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,392
I'll take her now.

317
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,955
- Where am I going?
- Where're they taking her?

318
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,673
In observation.

319
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,438
What happened to my quality time?

320
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,757
Bye, honey. Bye, honey.

321
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,549
I don't want to go anyplace!

322
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,795
Bye-bye, honey. Bye-bye.

323
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,554
First a lousy birth and now this.

324
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,955
Jeez, life sucks!

325
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,958
- You're next.
- Oh, I hope so.

326
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,558
- Bye, doll.
- Bye, Daddy.

327
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,995
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

328
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,355
Hey, Pop!

329
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,556
Hi, honey. How's your head?

330
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,916
Mikey, this is your sister, Julie.

331
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,396
Hi, Julie. Welcome to the outside.
I'm your big brother, Mikey.

332
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,074
I'll be in charge of you
for the next few years.

333
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,153
Smacking you around, getting you
in shape, teaching you things.

334
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,873
Anything you need, ask.

335
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,879
Who's this asshole?

336
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,152
Say no more.
You're tired after all that travelling.

337
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,191
That long trip down the birth canal.

338
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,198
Stop. You're killing me.

339
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,630
I got you something
for coming into the world.

340
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,114
Here. Have a cow, honey.

341
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,549
Get away!

342
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,353
Fine. Don't have a cow.

343
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,628
- Eddie, let's get a apple juice.
- No, I'm into my training thing.

344
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,268
What training thing?

345
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,431
I'm wearing the training pants, man.

346
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,752
Don't tell me you're going along
with this potty business.

347
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,190
We have to,
because the Toilet Man says so.

348
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,629
Who?

349
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,593
Mr. Toilet Man eats
your doo doo and your pee pee.

350
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,398
So I say, give it to him.

351
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,870
Eat your doo doo and pee pee?
Who said that?!

352
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,355
- My mother. You calling her a liar?
- No.

353
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,149
She told me that
diapers are for babies.

354
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,275
But eat your doo doo and your pee pee?
The thought is too hideous!

355
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,959
- Oh, yeah?
- Tell you what.

356
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,157
Let's take my sister for a walk.

357
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,389
All right.

358
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,673
Quick, while the moms aren't looking.

359
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,878
Let's take her to the zoo
and leave her there.

360
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,559
He would have a friend.

361
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,399
She won't like the lions.

362
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,155
And they're both schmucks.

363
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,990
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Wait, wait.

364
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,798
Uh-oh. Busted.

365
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,998
- Oh, honey, you okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

366
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,988
Don't take your sister away.
Mommy's heart jumped into her throat.

367
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,551
Do you have to be so graphic?

368
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,872
I was taking her for a walk.
I thought she'd have a good time.

369
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,069
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,796
Are you okay, sweetheart?

371
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,354
Here, let me give you a present.
Here. What's this?

372
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,717
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

373
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,550
Well, it's hospital garbage.
They make crack pipes out of these.

374
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,396
- Let me see your hands.
- My hands are okay, Ma.

375
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,392
- Don't.
- Give Mommy your hands.

376
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,750
No, please. They're okay.
They're clean.

377
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,396
That is it.
I have had it with this park!

378
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,596
Sorry. She didn't mean
to throw that on you.

379
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,792
Mikey, time to go to bed.

380
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,917
I told him he could watch a video.

381
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,513
He needs to go to bed.

382
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,678
But I promised
he could finish watching the video.

383
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,638
He can finish it tomorrow.
He's tired.

384
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,394
- Don't undermine me.
- You don't undermine me!

385
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,160
- Let's take it outside.
- Okay.

386
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,155
Because she's a baby
I have to go to bed early.

387
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,159
What're you looking at?

388
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,558
If I say Mikey can do something
and you say he can't...

389
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,598
...then you cut my nuts off.
How can I be a good dad?

390
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,950
You're the man
so you make the decisions?

391
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,955
I don't get to make all the decisions
because I'm the man!

392
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,792
Look, if I promise him something,
don't make me look like an asshole.

393
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,549
- You're doing a good job yourself!
- Keep it down out there, please?

394
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,988
I am his mother.

395
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,119
I see my tired baby sitting there,
and I know he's got to get up early.

396
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,200
- For what?
- Because I'm taking him to baby gym.

397
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,112
Oh, no. Not baby gym.

398
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,993
- He needs to socialize with kids.
- Go to the park.

399
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,350
I'm not taking him
to the park anymore!

400
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,909
You know what he did?
He picked up a crack pipe.

401
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,594
- Throw it out.
- He could get diseases from that!

402
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,753
You're so scared! You're gonna
bring him up to be a real crybaby.

403
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,958
I am going to baby gym.
I don't see why you care anyway.

404
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,109
- What's that mean?
- What do you mean, what's it mean?

405
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,670
It means that it's your money
so I'm not supposed to care.

406
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,552
- I didn't say that.
- It's what you think.

407
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,399
You earn more money
so you can make the decisions...

408
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,437
...and I'm out of here.
- I do not!

409
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,870
I have never, ever
brought up money before!

410
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,997
Why does everything
have to be your way?

411
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,189
It doesn't!

412
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,679
- Shut up!
- Shut up, you!

413
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,356
Let's take stock here.

414
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,754
My brother is 27 pounds of stupid.

415
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,752
My parents are okay separately
but as a couple, they stink.

416
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,958
Why don't you just put me
in a fucking dress, okay?

417
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,872
I guess you're my only friend, Herbie.

418
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,550
Intellectually it takes at least
three dates to know somebody.

419
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,389
But emotionally, I'll just look at the
way he'll eat something disgusting.

420
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,789
Like chili dogs.

421
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,794
This voice inside me says you can't
spend the next 60 years with him.

422
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,798
- You're planning on living a long time.
- You know what I mean.

423
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,951
You and James have been
together forever.

424
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,673
Yeah, a year and a half.

425
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,150
For a non-obsessive relationship,
that's pretty good.

426
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,197
- You know what I hate?
- What?

427
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,672
I hate the way James is always
telling me how to take care of Mikey.

428
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,480
I carried the kid for nine months.

429
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,756
I went through labour and the pain.

430
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,555
I know what I'm doing. I should
be lord and emperor of that child.

431
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,792
I think maybe he just
gets frustrated, you know?

432
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,759
Because he doesn't have a job
that he loves. Like we do.

433
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,752
We're really lucky.

434
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,959
- I don't know what to do.
- I don't know what to say.

435
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,398
You know what you have to do? You
have to take control of the situation.

436
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,394
You can't wait for this schmendrick
to get his act together.

437
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,949
He is not a schmendrick.
He is a good father.

438
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,151
For your information,
he works real hard.

439
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,358
That's the trouble.
He works his ass off for nothing.

440
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,194
Now Daddy has an account
with Corporate Pilots.

441
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,876
They earn between 30
and 50,000 dollars a year.

442
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,190
I wish James could get
a job like that.

443
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,635
I'm way ahead of you.
We already asked.

444
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,555
James has to call Freddie.
Tell him how many hours, what planes.

445
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,349
No. Ma, you know, if James
had a job that he really loved...

446
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,755
...and he could make money,
that would be great for us.

447
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,111
And you have Daddy to thank.

448
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,358
- Six. Six.
- A dollar.

449
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,716
Six dollar. Yeah. Seven?

450
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,388
A card's a card.
Why do you have to name them all?

451
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,757
What kind of equipment do they fly?

452
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,991
I don't know. You'll find out.

453
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,676
At least with my job I can fly
different types of aeroplanes.

454
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,150
Jimmy, what does it matter?
A jet's a jet.

455
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,750
Well, you don't love flying,
so it wouldn't matter to you.

456
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,150
This isn't about what aeroplanes
they have to fly. What is it?

457
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,238
You want to know what it is?
It's your mother, okay?

458
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,351
- They're controlling your life.
- They do not control my life.

459
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,272
Why are you and your brother
accountants?

460
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,756
Because we dearly love it.

461
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,558
Oh, come on!

462
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,200
You dearly love being accountants?

463
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,273
I do. It deals with my favourite
things, numbers and people.

464
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,519
And they check our tax return every
year just to make me look stupid.

465
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,990
That isn't true!
You said it was okay.

466
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,519
Maybe it's not.

467
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,678
Look, don't take the job.
I don't care.

468
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,148
Fine. I won't.

469
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,550
Oh, honey. I'm sorry.

470
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,593
Oh, sweetheart.

471
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,552
- I was just trying to help.
- I know you were helping me.

472
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,796
I thought that if you did something
you loved, you'd be happier.

473
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,598
I shouldn't have said anything.

474
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,958
My mom and dad were trying to help
so they talked to their friends.

475
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,997
- Now you hate them.
- I don't hate them.

476
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,800
I have always been really
nice to your mother.

477
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,476
Honey, look, I'll call Freddie
tomorrow, okay?

478
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,950
Don't call him just
because I'm bawling.

479
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,517
I'll find out what it's all about,
and I won't promise you anything.

480
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,392
It won't be because you're crying.

481
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,359
Okay. All right, give me a kiss.

482
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,148
Who the hell is that?

483
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,149
Who is it? Damn it.
It must be some kind of nut!

484
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,237
Here, let me open it. What?

485
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,072
- Do you know who I hate?
- Stuart!

486
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,192
How you doing? You're back!
This is my brother. This is James.

487
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,752
I hate these Orientals! They're
buying up this country. You know why?

488
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,394
- He's the accountant for Mitsubishi.
- Not anymore.

489
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,751
Americans have turned themselves
into fat-assed lazy slobs...

490
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,952
...who'd rather sell their toes
than get up and walk a block.

491
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,551
- Could I stay here for a while?
- As long as you want.

492
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,154
I'll make up the couch! Yes!

493
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,954
Oh, what a dilemma.
Do I stay or do I pee?

494
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,990
What if Eddie said was true?

495
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,152
Mr. Toilet Man eating your pee pee?

496
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,559
Oh, well, I guess
I really don't believe that.

497
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,748
But then, on the other hand,
what if there is a Mr. Toilet Man?

498
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,949
Well, I think I better just turn
the light on just to make sure.

499
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,032
Just as I thought.

500
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,356
Just a regular old toilet, huh?

501
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,750
Wait till I tell Eddie about this.

502
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,951
Eddie and his bonehead ideas.

503
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,193
Hey, you! You little pisser!
I'm talking to you!

504
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,958
You're supposed to give me pee pee!

505
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,634
Where's that pee pee?
We're talking about pee pee!

506
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,354
- I need that pee pee!
- Oh, no! Mr. Toilet Man!

507
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,757
Listen, I've had it with you!
You'd better give me that pee pee.

508
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,312
Give it to me or the next time you
sit on me, I'll bite off your tushy!

509
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,950
It's okay, honey. Mommy's here.

510
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,879
- Mommy's here. Oh, sweetheart.
- Mommy. Daddy. Potty.

511
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,395
- It's just a dream.
- The Toilet Man.

512
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,835
It was scary.

513
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,349
- You know what it is?
- Get a load of those eyebrows.

514
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,075
- It's a country of showoffs.
- What's the deal with eyebrows?

515
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,313
Eyes I understand.

516
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,956
Mouths I understand. But eyebrows?

517
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,995
I wonder if I'll have a set like his.

518
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,349
Daddy doesn't have a set like his.

519
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,319
- Good luck with your job interview.
- It's confusing.

520
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,152
I guess I'll learn some day.

521
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,593
- I want him out of the house.
- We're going out!

522
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,276
We're getting ready to go out!
I'm so ex cited!

523
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,600
- Daddy, don't take my nose!
- I got your nose.

524
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,995
- Goodbye, Mommy's honey bunny.
- Hi, Mommy.

525
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,753
Let's take the Play-Doh.

526
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,152
There's something I saw earlier
that I'd like to build and if you...

527
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,554
Mom?

528
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,959
Daddy.

529
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,956
Where'd everybody go?

530
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,079
What have I done to deserve this?

531
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,393
Julie, don't worry.
I'll take care of you.

532
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,551
You're too little!

533
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,913
You should have seen my brother
as a kid. He was so cute and sweet!

534
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,714
But no matter what he did,
he'd get in trouble.

535
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,514
Everyone was always screaming at him.

536
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,079
Daddy was screaming.

537
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,276
He looks just like Leon!

538
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,909
- Everybody looks like Leon.
- You think so?

539
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,118
I think if he was in a loving
environment, like my house...

540
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,590
...that he would really
straighten out.

541
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,273
Yeah, right and shutting down.

542
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,349
Thanks, Bill.

543
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,678
Okay, here we are.

544
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,797
- Excuse me. Here we go.
- Where's the briefcase?

545
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,917
- Did you leave it on the plane?
- No.

546
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,309
One minute.

547
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,712
- I'll lock up.
- You bet.

548
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,673
All right, here we are. Thank you.

549
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,074
Good night.

550
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,713
Dickface.

551
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,273
Jeez.

552
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,912
- Hi, Elvis.
- Hey, Priscilla.

553
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,314
How'd it go?

554
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,876
Which part? Blaming me for
turbulence spilling wine on them...

555
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,911
...or bawling me out for weak coffee?

556
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,315
You just got a couple of creeps.

557
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,711
Didrt it feel great not worrying
about driving the cab?

558
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,717
Didrt that make it won'thwhile?

559
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,674
I love flying a Lear jet.
It's just this beeper lifestyle.

560
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,717
You're on call anytime.

561
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,111
That means we can't plan vacations.
What about the kids?

562
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,271
Am I a waiter or a pilot?

563
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,080
Other than that, how did you like it?

564
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,514
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

565
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,716
You liked it! I knew you would.

566
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,954
All right, I think I'm gonna try it.
Yeah, yeah, it's solid.

567
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,270
I gotta be honest with myself here.

568
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,434
I'm a failure as a big brother.
Look at her.

569
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,471
And I'm going, I'm going, I'm...

570
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,874
...kidding myself.

571
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,237
I try and teach her to crawl,
she's bouncing like a spaniel.

572
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,679
Here I go.

573
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,669
- Yeah, I'm going.
- Wait a minute. She's up.

574
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,390
She's mobile. She's moving.

575
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,076
She's heading right for my toys.

576
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,713
Maybe I better show her
about toys right away...

577
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,191
...before she does something drastic
to one of my toys.

578
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,919
Let me show you something.

579
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,909
These are all toys, right?
Some are mine, some are yours.

580
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,118
- The difference is I have great toys.
- Let me see.

581
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,791
- You have all these stupid, baby toys.
- Can I see that? I like it.

582
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,111
Of course you do.
It's a big-boy toy.

583
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,998
Can't I see it for a little?

584
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,516
You can't have it. You think
you can jump into a toy like this?

585
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,150
- Grow up, kid.
- Jeez, he's always so mean to me.

586
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,279
- Here's a toy you can play with.
- I don't like balls!

587
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,550
Don't cry again.

588
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,678
Freeze!

589
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,831
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

590
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,913
Why do you have a gun in my house?
There are kids here!

591
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,155
It's not loaded.

592
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,312
People say that when
they accidentally kill someone.

593
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,112
"I didn't think it was loaded."

594
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,272
You guys make me laugh.
You're really funny.

595
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,199
You stock up your cabinets
with bottled water and flashlights.

596
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,671
But what do you think'll happen
when the shit hits the fan?

597
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,276
Like earthquakes or flash floods
or mud slides.

598
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,711
Or just chaos and horror,
people dying in the streets.

599
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,349
And you're sitting pretty
with your bottled water.

600
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,315
Now the guy next door,
he's got one of these.

601
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,118
Who's gonna go thirsty?

602
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,476
Him or you?

603
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,034
I mean...

604
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,708
...think about it.

605
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,278
You're nuts.

606
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,318
Mollie, I don't want that maniac
around the kids.

607
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,074
- He's their uncle.
- He sleeps with a gun.

608
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,198
- He does not.
- He tried to shoot me when I came in.

609
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,318
Stewball?

610
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,718
- Do you have a gun in there?
- It's not loaded.

611
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,473
It's not loaded.

612
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,509
I need some cover.

613
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,599
If I drink out of a Styrofoam cup,
you give me a two-hour lecture.

614
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,879
But Travis Bickle moves in with a
semiautomatic weapon and it's okay?

615
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,231
This is New York.
Women carry guns in their purses.

616
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,670
Most people have them
in their nightstands.

617
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,276
Jimmy, if a little unloaded gun
makes him feel better...

618
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,754
Makes him feel better?

619
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,278
Maybe climbing a tower and shooting
students would make him feel better.

620
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,879
Jeez.

621
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,757
Okay now, this might sound
like a stupid question...

622
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,712
...but where is Julie's penis?

623
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,633
Is it in the tub, maybe?
Did she break it off?

624
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,912
- No penis.
- Oh, it's okay.

625
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,873
He wants to know why
Julie doesn't have a penis.

626
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,238
- What?
- Tell him about boys and girls.

627
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,069
- Not at this age, honey.
- Just tell him why we're different.

628
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,953
You do it. I told him
about the potty bit.

629
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,312
All right, take Julie.
Go see Daddy. Go see Daddy.

630
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,675
Mikey...

631
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,873
...Julie is a girl
and you are a boy, okay?

632
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,710
Little boys have penises, but girls
don't because they don't need them.

633
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,555
It's like Mommy. Mommy is a girl,
so I don't have a penis.

634
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,075
But she's got some set of balls.

635
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,432
- But Daddy is a big...?
- Penis.

636
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,036
That's right.

637
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,111
Here we go. What's that?

638
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,074
A penis.

639
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,555
- This one?
- No penis.

640
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,672
That's good! He understands.
What's this?

641
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,759
Tough call.

642
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,075
Oh, boy, was that stupid or what?
It was very stupid.

643
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,316
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack.

644
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,394
You see, at this age people have
the tendency to have a heart attack.

645
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,710
You can do that.
You just go up and down.

646
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,078
But eventually you have a heart attack.
Jump up and down like that.

647
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,072
And don't forget to breathe!

648
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,113
A lot of times people just
drop dead here, and you say:

649
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,920
"Ed, what happened?"
"I forgot to breathe."

650
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,991
Just jump. Jump up and down.

651
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,712
Yes, like that. Fine.

652
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,269
You like this house?
It's a very good house.

653
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,277
Is it me or is this guy weird?

654
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,277
Just rip my whole face off.

655
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,988
She rips my face off and you punch me.

656
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,470
I've never had so much fun
in my life!

657
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,912
Check out the blond on the monkey
bars. You can see up her dress!

658
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,917
That's Sheila. We played doctor.

659
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,593
Played... Where?

660
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,910
Over there,
behind that bean bag thing.

661
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,394
You dog!

662
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,159
Got another house call.

663
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,991
Eddie gets all the girls.

664
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,276
He's not wearing a diaper.

665
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,636
Maybe I ought to try
this potty thing.

666
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,110
When you have to pee,
you jump up and down.

667
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,432
But sometimes nothing has to come out.

668
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,394
So you try to jump up and down
a little more.

669
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,593
And I don't have to pee.

670
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,308
I don't have to pee.

671
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,310
I do have to pee,
and I better go somewhere.

672
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,677
Here I go. Okay.
Now's the time. I just...

673
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,270
That stuff really sneaks up on you.

674
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,479
I want a bowl of Kraft caramel pieces.

675
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,119
WWF Wrestling Buddies, the
rough-and-ready wrestlers from Tonka!

676
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,517
Wrestling Buddies by Tonka?
I want one of those!

677
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,671
Here comes the new Cobra Hammerhead.

678
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,916
The Cobra Hammerhead'll
sink those Joes!

679
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,469
I need a Cobra Hammerhead!

680
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,511
Hey, I want a Cobra Camerahead.

681
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,035
It's for boys. Jeez.

682
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,875
- Hey, Priscilla.
- Hi, Elvis.

683
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,316
- Mikey, guess what I got you?
- A Cobra Hammerhead?

684
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,471
- An aeroplane!
- Oh, man.

685
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,875
It's a Lear 24,
just like your dad flies.

686
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,112
One day I'll take you to the airport.
You can sit with me.

687
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,595
- Want to do that?
- No.

688
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,276
Man, I have never been more insulted.

689
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,917
I get up for this job interview
today. Everything's great.

690
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,071
It's for this liberal organization.

691
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,389
Which one?

692
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,999
I don't know. The American Foundation
of Crybabies or some shit.

693
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,272
He tells me the salary,
and I wanted to kick his ass.

694
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,273
- Who does he think he's talking to?
- Are you hungry?

695
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,796
I'm checking out
the Faster Pussycats.

696
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,519
That'll be fun for you.

697
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,274
- You think I could borrow $20?
- Sure.

698
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,789
Hey, Stuart? Nice jacket.

699
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,349
Do you mind? I got a date.

700
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,595
I guess not.

701
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,116
Here. And I want you to take this.
This is mad money.

702
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,275
And don't take the subway.
There's a lot of weirdos. Take a cab.

703
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,677
- There's a lot of weirdos there?
- Yeah. You take a cab. Bye.

704
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,278
I don't mind that every job interview
he goes up on, he gets upset.

705
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,392
It doesn't really bother me
that he takes my clothes.

706
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,108
I can even put up with
his Fascist views.

707
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,477
But you know what bothers me?
What really ticks me off?

708
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,591
Is this and this!

709
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,274
He drinks everything but a drop,
then puts it back.

710
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,914
He takes bites of everything,
then puts it back.

711
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,470
He reads our magazines, hides them
before we get to read them!

712
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,399
- I'll have a talk with him.
- No, I want him out.

713
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,676
- He doesn't have a place.
- Your mother's.

714
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,199
They'd kill each other.

715
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,311
Why do you put him ahead of me?

716
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,959
- I don't.
- You do.

717
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,474
Decide, him or me.

718
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,869
You can't ask me to choose
between you and my family!

719
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,071
He's still family at your mother's.

720
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,795
I won't kick him out. And I hate you
for asking me to do this.

721
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,918
- You hate me?
- You're being mean and selfish.

722
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,628
- You're inconsiderate and stubborn.
- Oh, yeah?

723
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,876
I think you are a big, stupid slob!

724
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,712
I think you're big and stupid!

725
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,270
I may be big, but I am not stupid!
So you just get out of here!

726
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,512
- I pay half the rent!
- I pay all the utilities!

727
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,273
Fine!

728
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,358
Elvis is leaving the building!

729
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,271
Hey, I don't want him to go.

730
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,749
What happened?

731
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,389
Oh, yeah? Chase my daddy away,
I'll show you.

732
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,473
Here, here. Go ahead.

733
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,269
Hey, that's mine!

734
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,711
All the yelling. Here's what
I think of your little friend!

735
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,476
Oh, no!

736
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,555
Bye-bye, birdie!
Think you're a bird?

737
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,870
Let's see if you can fly now.

738
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,317
Oh, my friend!

739
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,074
You hurt my friend.

740
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,593
You creep!

741
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,272
- Who is it?
- It's me, Rona.

742
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,393
- Hi, hon.
- You mind if I stay the night?

743
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,313
I'm too scared to go to
my apartment. I was robbed.

744
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,120
Of course you can. What happened?

745
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,069
I went to put the key in the door
and I saw it was a little open.

746
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,475
I peeked in and the place was wrecked.

747
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,312
- What'd they get?
- Everything.

748
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,120
They got my telephone,
my stereo, my camera.

749
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,670
They got my grandfather's gold watch,
that pocket watch?

750
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,714
They got all my costume jewellery.
And some was really expensive.

751
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,872
The worst thing's the mess!
Everything was thrown around.

752
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,799
- Just when I was getting organized.
- Freeze!

753
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,077
Stuart, put the gun down.

754
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,715
Rona, this is my brother, Stuart.

755
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,556
Hi. What a surprise.
Mollie never said she had a brother.

756
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,358
Sorry for aiming this at you.

757
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,673
That's okay. No one was killed.

758
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,870
Come on. You can stay
in my room tonight.

759
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,198
It's nice meeting you.

760
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,079
Mollie said some wonderful things
about you.

761
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,470
- I'm not gonna tell you again.
- Move.

762
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,190
- You shove over. This is my side.
- Get your arm away.

763
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,351
You afraid you'll get recognized?

764
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,518
- Bitchir wheels.
- Ex cept I gotta ride beside her.

765
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,274
- Buzz off.
- Get your finger out of my eye.

766
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,232
You got a sister?

767
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,959
Better for you.

768
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,873
Mom tells them to be good,
they poke you in the eye.

769
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,992
Worse... Try and stay with me
when I'm talking to you.

770
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,953
What I'm saying is
your parents forget about you.

771
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,430
No, dude. Don't say that.

772
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,477
Well, the way it's going...

773
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,671
- See you later.
- I gotta bail, dude.

774
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,313
Mommy is so funny. She's always
doing something so inventive.

775
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,872
She's the greatest.
She's so clever.

776
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,829
Imagine using your hand
and turning it into a duck.

777
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,957
Sure, sure, laugh now.

778
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,034
Wait'll they take that big sharp
thing and stick you with it.

779
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,350
I hope they don't stick me today.

780
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,955
She'll be knocked out from the shot...

781
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,270
...so no operating heavy machinery.

782
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,631
I'm only 1,
and I know that's not funny.

783
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,875
What's that?

784
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,072
I can't watch this part.

785
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,636
Oh, my God!

786
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,190
Smarts, does it?
Hurts just a little?

787
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,279
Will this pain ever go away?!

788
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,632
Maybe it will. Maybe it won't.

789
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,429
Hey, look at this.
Look what I'm doing.

790
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,198
I'm walking.

791
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,190
Oh, my tush hurts.

792
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,437
Hey! My friend's back.

793
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,232
Now I remember.

794
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,236
He killed my friend.

795
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,639
As God is my witness,
I'm going to learn to walk...

796
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,950
...and get the hell out of here!

797
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,511
Mike, what do you say we see a movie?

798
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,188
What do you say you carry me
around for once?

799
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,197
Yeah, bite my teething ring.

800
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,836
All right, we got Schwarzenegger,
and we got Betty Boop.

801
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,868
Tough call. They're both really built.
They both talk funny.

802
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,274
What would Arnold say?

803
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,752
He'd say, " Do it. Why don't you do it?
You are here. See my movie."

804
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,275
I think they're a little young,
don't you?

805
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,476
Yeah, he says we're too young.

806
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,352
You're not gonna pull...

807
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,832
...the "Sir, my kid left her shoe
inside. Can I go get it?" gag?

808
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,038
He won't go for it.

809
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,834
Sir, my kid left her shoe inside.
Can we get it?

810
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,315
- Thanks.
- Okay, I guess he went for it.

811
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,878
Mike, here. Remember
your obnoxious routine, okay?

812
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,032
- Remember it? I live for it.
- Say popcorn.

813
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,468
Popcorn! Popcorn!

814
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,795
Can I help you?

815
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,310
Yeah, the kids knocked over
the popcorn in the theatre.

816
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,794
Popcorn, popcorn!

817
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,594
All right, calm down.
Just a minute.

818
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,916
Hey, I can be obnoxious too!

819
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,915
Just go.

820
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,675
Oh, no, really? You're great.
Thanks.

821
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,757
Yeah. It's all right.

822
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,875
Always works.

823
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,038
Now look, you guys,
you know I'll be home soon.

824
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,239
If your mother doesn't stop bossing
me around, I'll never be a good dad.

825
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,075
I know that ice cream doesn't
make up for me not being home.

826
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,754
Yeah, well, it's a good start.

827
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,435
I miss you kids so much.

828
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,830
Please don't be mad at me
whatever she says, okay?

829
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,037
Remember, this has nothing
to do with you guys, all right?

830
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,470
It's not your fault,
and it's not your fault.

831
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,877
- I think it is his fault.
- I think it's your fault.

832
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,000
Me? You're the bad one.

833
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,238
I miss you so much.

834
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,634
Pop.

835
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,833
- You miss me?
- Yeah.

836
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,272
Ick. Male bonding makes me sick.

837
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,833
She needs to be changed.

838
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,069
Hi.

839
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,759
There you go, Mike.

840
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,834
Jimmy, have you given any more thought
to what we talked about?

841
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,191
What? You mean my being
a big stupid slob?

842
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,994
We gotta boom-a-boom, a-boom-boom.

843
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,873
Or my being selfish
and you wanting me out?

844
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,669
I got upset. I didn't think
you appreciated me getting that job.

845
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,998
- Mikey, stop it!
- All right, I'll do it soft.

846
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,431
I'm not one of the kids.
I can do things for myself.

847
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,757
Like becoming a pilot
when you fly two hours a week?

848
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,555
- It'll take until you're 50.
- For your information, I got a job.

849
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,795
- We got a boom, baby, boom...
- Knock it off!

850
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,313
Why'd they do that?
He was just working his plate.

851
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,631
I'm sorry, Julie.

852
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,879
Night, baby.

853
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,916
I said to this guy,
"What are you, some kind of idiot?"

854
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,710
I did!
I said, "File a schedule C."

855
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,239
That's right!

856
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,153
You would, huh?

857
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,039
- Would what?
- File a schedule C?

858
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,832
Yeah, I would.

859
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,673
Okay, I can do it holding on.

860
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,676
But I wonder if I can make it
all the way to the couch.

861
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,480
All right, here goes nothing.

862
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,836
Yeah, I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

863
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,429
I'm getting there. Yes!

864
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,835
I did it!

865
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,838
I made it! I walked!

866
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,431
Honey, you walked! You walked!

867
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,432
Stuart! You walked!

868
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,035
James! Julie...

869
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,471
Jimmy called. He'll pick up the kids.

870
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,359
Did he ask to talk to me at all?

871
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,272
It's only been a couple days.

872
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,750
Okay, fine, fine. Let's work.

873
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,310
I got a spouse who wants to
contribute into an IRA account.

874
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,232
Her husband's covered by a pension.

875
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,034
You'd lose a $2000 deduction.

876
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,472
I think you're being lazy.

877
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,314
You need to do a separate
and a joint return.

878
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,959
- I know.
- I know you know.

879
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,077
I know you know I know.

880
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,039
Get a load of this asshole here.
He's a teacher.

881
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,555
He figures that
his chair and his desk...

882
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,475
...are 1 l4 of his six-room apartment.

883
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,837
So he deducts
1 l24 of his residence as work space.

884
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,476
- Stuart, you can't do that.
- It's only 1 l24. Who will care?

885
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,757
He has a classroom
and a teacher's lounge.

886
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,230
And that's employer-provided
work space.

887
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,715
- You're strict.
- You could get away with it.

888
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,036
You want to be a criminal? Good.

889
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,668
What is wrong?

890
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,955
Well, look at us!

891
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,351
It's Saturday at 10:00,
and we're here with our 10-40s.

892
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,675
It's tax season!

893
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,519
I don't care.
We should be out having fun.

894
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,039
Hey, this is fun.

895
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,229
I know what's wrong.

896
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,871
- I know what you're thinking.
- What?

897
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,793
"What's Jimmy doing?
He's out having a ball."

898
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,470
Yeah, "ball" being the operative word.

899
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,392
Mollie, come on.

900
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,955
He's probably on his sister's couch,
watching TV.

901
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,872
No, he's probably getting laid.

902
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,036
Thank you very much, Stuart!

903
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,593
Mr. Wonderful, my brother.

904
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,234
- It's just a physical thing.
- Just work.

905
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,429
- Rona, let's go get something to eat.
- Okay, let's go.

906
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,159
My wife would never let me
drive with the top down.

907
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,038
She'd say it causes skin cancer.

908
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,631
And she'd say these cause emphysema.
And this causes liver disease.

909
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,312
Oh, man!

910
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,075
What a rush! Oh, man!
My wife would have hated that.

911
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,829
How dull!
You have to have some fun in life.

912
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,235
You know what her idea
of living dangerously is?

913
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,436
Forgetting one of her vitamins.

914
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,435
What a snail!
Hey, let's go get some pork.

915
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,989
You okay?

916
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:53,069
Yeah, I'm fine. I just wish James
would get here, so I can go to work.

917
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,470
Okay, you little brat,
let go of her head.

918
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,678
Let go! Just, just...
Hey! Everybody in the circle.

919
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,072
Everybody in the circle.
Just get in the circle!

920
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,039
Everybody together.
Who am I talking to here?

921
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,114
Now, Eddie, run this potty thing
by me once more.

922
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,914
You gotta take control
of the situation.

923
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,549
How do you do that?

924
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,832
You gotta say, "Hey, yo, pee pee,
I know you're in there.

925
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,110
But you're not coming out
till I say so!"

926
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,878
And the pee pees listen to you?

927
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,877
Sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

928
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,758
That's what grownups are for.

929
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,873
- Hey, buster, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

930
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,270
Hey, Joey. Need some help?

931
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,035
Get in a circle!
Indians dance in a circle! Help me!

932
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,236
Jews and Italians dance in circles.

933
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,471
- They like it.
- Let's help Joey out.

934
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,432
Do that step we do.

935
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,239
Do this, kids.

936
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,355
Good! All right!

937
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,955
- Elvis! Elvis!
- Elvis, my man!

938
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,830
Come on! Dance! Dance!
Come on, damn it, I'll slap you!

939
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,230
- Hey, twist. Twist!
- Turn, turn.

940
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,239
Come on, twist.

941
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,479
Follow me. That's it.

942
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,633
Follow him.
Here, I'll give you a dollar.

943
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,039
- Hey, showoff. Get out of here.
- Hey, Mike.

944
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,594
Oh, I'm having a stroke!
Oh, boy!

945
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,270
Come here, E lvis.
I'm your kid, not them.

946
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,596
You hit me. You hit me.

947
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,439
Hey, Mollie. See you later.

948
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,830
What's with him?
He acts like I don't even exist.

949
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,431
I don't get it. Am I losing it?

950
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,238
Oh, man, Julie, if we're gonna
get your daddy back...

951
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,631
...we're gonna have
to do some serious packaging.

952
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,189
- Are you with me, kid?
- Yeah, let's dress up for Daddy!

953
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,075
- Jimmy, hi.
- Hey, Rona. You look good.

954
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,033
- Thanks, doll.
- All right, big boy. I'll see you.

955
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,474
No, no. Don't go.

956
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,636
- I gotta go.
- Mollie wants to talk.

957
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,792
- For what?
- Jimmy, talk to her. Be nice.

958
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,033
Oh, hi.

959
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,279
You seen my sunglasses?

960
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,274
Don't you think we should try
and work out some of your problems?

961
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,478
The biggest problem I got
is squinting my eyes all day.

962
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,472
Don't you even miss us?

963
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,035
Calling out the heavy artillery, huh?

964
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,152
- Do you always have to be a putz?
- Oh, pipe down!

965
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,191
Maybe I should try what Eddie said.

966
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,831
I'll have a talk with my pee pee.

967
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,032
I'm getting ready to go to the potty,
so don't come out.

968
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,233
I can feel them in there,
but maybe it's working.

969
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,072
Maybe Eddie was right.

970
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,436
Okay, let's see if I can make it.

971
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,116
Still feel them.
Maybe they're listening to me.

972
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,874
Okay, don't come out.
Don't come out.

973
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,231
It's getting a little tougher now.

974
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,310
Don't come out. I'm almost there.

975
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,433
I might make it.
Don't come out.

976
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,031
I had to pinch that one back.

977
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,112
Don't come out.

978
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,558
I might make it if I could just
get these doggone pants down.

979
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,199
Wait a minute, hold it.

980
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,715
Mommy! Daddy!

981
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,109
Mommy! Daddy!

982
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,833
Mommy! Daddy!

983
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,428
- What's wrong with him?
- What? What?

984
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,119
- Honey! What a good boy!
- Mike, you did it!

985
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,309
I'm not done.

986
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,433
Rona! Stuart!
Mikey went pee pee in the potty!

987
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,875
Pee pee in the potty

988
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:43,432
Pee pee in the potty
Pee pee in the potty

989
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,114
Isn't it great, sweetie?
Your brother went pee pee.

990
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,238
Big deal. I made a doodie.

991
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,476
I can't believe this!
What a big boy! Good boy.

992
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,836
I haven't felt this good
since he was born.

993
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,674
It's better than money.
It's better than aeroplanes.

994
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,512
It's better than sex!

995
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,634
Well, I don't know about that, but...

996
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,036
You hungry?

997
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,149
I gotta go.

998
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,670
- I could fix anything you want.
- I got a 9:00 flight.

999
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,074
But it's pouring!

1000
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,829
It's better to be up
in the air pouring...

1001
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,758
...than it is on a highway in cars.

1002
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,752
Who said the highway was safe?

1003
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,834
Every year there's 200,000
fatalities related to the rain.

1004
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,429
Rona! You want some chicken?

1005
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,074
It depends on how it turns out.

1006
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,835
Okay, so what do you need?
Paprika, vegetables?

1007
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,314
Hey, Mollie.
Do you want some chicken?

1008
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,274
- Hurricane Jonathan spreading damage.
- I don't eat meat.

1009
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,516
Forecast calls for increased winds.

1010
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,239
That's it.

1011
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,632
I have to talk to Jimmy.
This is crazy.

1012
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,274
This is Mollie Ubriacco.
Can I speak to my husband?

1013
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,393
- He's on the field.
- He is? Has he taxied out yet?

1014
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,398
- Not yet.
- Can somebody get him?

1015
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,636
- It's an emergency.
- No.

1016
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,836
- Could you reach him on his phone?
- No.

1017
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:20,072
Damn! All right, all right.
What terminal is he in?

1018
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,231
Airborne Express terminal.

1019
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,590
- What ramp?
- You'll have to come in and ask.

1020
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,438
Okay, thank you very much.

1021
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,797
Stuart, I've gotta go get James.

1022
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,638
You feed the kids their dinner.

1023
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,838
Do not give them any diet Coke
like last time.

1024
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,233
Excuse me.

1025
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,592
Where's Jimmy?

1026
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,439
- Where's he going?
- Reno or something like that.

1027
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,028
Wait! Hold it!

1028
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,395
Wait a minute!

1029
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:17,071
- New York Centre, 135.9.
47, Poppa.

1030
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,639
What're you doing here?

1031
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,115
- It was an emergency.
- You shouldn't be here.

1032
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,834
No, you shouldn't be here.
It's too dangerous.

1033
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,429
I've told you,
we fly around the weather.

1034
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,278
You can't fly around it.

1035
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,512
It's wall-to-wall storms.
Didrt you listen to the news?

1036
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,593
- The news always upsets you.
- Forget the news.

1037
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,554
- I have a gut feeling you shouldn't fly!
- We don't need your gut feeling.

1038
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,878
We got sophisticated instruments
that tell me exactly where I can go.

1039
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,190
I got clearance
and I'm leaving, so go.

1040
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,277
- I'm not leaving without you.
- Get out.

1041
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,833
- I'm not leaving.
- Get out!

1042
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:53,238
47 Poppa, due to adverse weather
we're cancelling all flights.

1043
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,436
Do you read me, 47 Poppa?

1044
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,237
Okay, that's 47 Poppa.
You can cancel our flight plan.

1045
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,839
Roger, 47 Poppa.

1046
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,237
So I guess this time
your feeling was right, huh?

1047
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,158
Does that make you happy?

1048
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,037
Jimmy, I love you.

1049
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,919
I don't care anymore
if I'm right or wrong.

1050
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,236
You do too, you liar.

1051
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,234
Well, I sort of like being right.

1052
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,238
But I do love you.

1053
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,639
I love you too.

1054
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,518
I got you! Attack!
It's coming through!

1055
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,278
Bombs away!

1056
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,637
A little napalm ought
to slow you down, colonel.

1057
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,632
Thank God they left me
with a responsible adult.

1058
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,839
I got you! I got you!

1059
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,231
Charge! I got you!

1060
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,472
Yes, you are my prisoner!

1061
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:14,632
Okay, I give up.
I surrender. I surrender.

1062
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,229
How about a little squirt
in the nostril?

1063
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,235
Let me get the chicken.
This ain't over. This ain't over.

1064
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,710
I'll get my troops together.
We'll be back.

1065
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,039
Mikey, watch Julie, okay?

1066
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,435
Why? Is she gonna do something
besides slobber?

1067
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,953
Freeze! Okay, put the bag down.

1068
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,469
Slow. Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Come on.

1069
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,874
Put the bag down.

1070
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,029
Shit.

1071
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,069
Stop!

1072
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,835
The kids are gonna be so excited.

1073
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,672
- Who's watching them?
- Stuart.

1074
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,480
Stuart! Oh, no.
What are you, nuts?

1075
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,438
Everything'll be all right.

1076
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,879
Holy cow!

1077
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,475
Okay, stay calm.
Just get Uncle Stuart.

1078
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,478
Uncle Stuart! Uncle Stuart!
Uncle Stuart!

1079
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,069
Oh, great!

1080
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,953
Stop that guy!

1081
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,632
Hey, where's Mommy?

1082
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,673
I don't know where Uncle Stuart is,
but we gotta get out.

1083
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,512
This is too much hot stuff.

1084
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,309
Mikey, this stuff is scary!

1085
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,232
- It's okay, Julie.
- I'm afraid.

1086
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:28,479
I'll take care of you. I don't know
where that bonehead Uncle Stuart is.

1087
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,592
Now keep your hands in, Julie.
Don't touch anything.

1088
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,635
What did you do that for?
I had him whipped.

1089
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:51,877
- Did you want me to let him kill you?
- What?!

1090
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,355
- Where are the kids?
- They're upstairs.

1091
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,634
Oh, my God!

1092
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,438
I'll take the stairs.

1093
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,835
Okay, here we go.
I think we're safe.

1094
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,790
- That was close.
- How did you get down here?

1095
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,390
- We just walked.
- Technically, I was pushed.

1096
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,195
- Call the fire department.
- Okay. Come on, baby.

1097
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,636
"Turn, open and press."

1098
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,438
Yes! Yes!

1099
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:55,239
I chased him down here.
We were going down some fire escape.

1100
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,831
I chased him down. I jumped
on the guy and I sucker-punched him.

1101
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,999
He is amazing, isn't he?
Stuart, let's get married!

1102
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,434
Yeah!

1103
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,280
You're lucky the fire didn't spread.

1104
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:11,876
- Thank God I got that extinguisher.
- I got the fire extinguisher.

1105
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,433
- I got the fire exting...
- No, I bought it.

1106
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:19,838
Who left the kids with Stuart?
That was a pretty bonehead idea, huh?

1107
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,638
Good answer.

1108
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,873
I'm worried about you
barbecuing all the time.

1109
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,157
- Will you relax?
- It's not good for the environment.

1110
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:41,269
We just got one of these
brand-new outdoor electric stoves.

1111
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,438
They don't do anything bad.
You're such a nudge.

1112
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,069
I don't know how you put up with her.

1113
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:50,437
Tune her out. Tune her out.

1114
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,076
- I'm trying to educate you people!
- We're getting along fine.

1115
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,750
Rona, how do you like
living with Stuart?

1116
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,835
Mikey, okay.
You got me out of the hot stuff.

1117
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,594
I don't get it.

1118
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,872
Listen. You know,
hot stuff can be very bad for you.

1119
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,190
It's especially not good for kids.

1120
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,508
But I thought you hated me.
You're always mean to me and stuff.

1121
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,439
Yeah, well, I do hate you
a lot of the time.

1122
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,031
You drive me crazy, you bug me...

1123
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,840
...you poke me in the eye,
but you're my sister.

1124
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,516
It's my job to love you.
We gotta stick together.

1125
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,590
The way I see it,
there's us and there's them.

1126
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,274
Yeah, big ones don't make any sense.

1127
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,034
You never know what
big ones are gonna do.

1128
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,830
That's for sure.
That's why we have to stick together.

1129
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,433
You and me.

1130
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,948
You and me?

1131
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:48,273
That's right. You and me.
We're the kids!

1132
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:49,834
Yeah.

1133
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:54,949


1134
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,477
Oh, my tush hurts.
