1
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,678
Boo-boo.

2
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:56,555
Couldn't we read another book?

3
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:00,955
We've read this one a hundred times.

4
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:04,223
Please?

5
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:09,458
Nanny Gilbertine is so tired of
the Boo-boo book, she could just gag.

6
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:11,628
Boo-boo.

7
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:15,634
All right. All right.

8
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:24,508
''One fine and sunny day,
Baby Boo's nanny Henrietta said

9
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:30,386
'Baby Boo, today you shall go
on a wonderful adventure.'''

10
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:33,722
'''You will see the many,
many sights of the Big City.'''

11
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:42,631
''After a lovely breakfast
they walked down the lane to the corner,

12
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:45,569
where they boarded a big, blue bus.''

13
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,308
''They were on their way to the Big City.''

14
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:52,309
''Baby Boo felt very grown-up indeed,

15
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:56,041
for this was his first trip
away from Mother and Father.''

16
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:00,012
Did l tell you?

17
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:04,580
- Baby's having his picture taken today.
- Oh. Say hello to old Willy for me.

18
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:10,220
Old Willy isn't doing it.
l've hired Downtown Baby Photographers.

19
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:15,028
He's photographed Cotwell babies
since the Depression.

20
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:18,434
Old Willy hasn't had a picture
in the paper in over 20 years.

21
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:21,599
Everyone we know has had
their baby's picture in the paper.

22
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:25,042
Baby Bink is almost a year old
and virtually unknown.

23
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:31,050
l can't count the number of times l've been
asked why we're keeping our baby a secret.

24
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:34,877
You're right.

25
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:40,517
The only way to quiet such talk is to have our
small-minded friends open up their papers

26
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:44,393
and see a photograph of
the prettiest baby in the city.

27
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:52,427
- Get out! Come on!
- Come on, let's go. l said move it!

28
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:54,405
Move it!

29
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,675
Off with the fuzzy pink and blue sweaters,
nice and slow.

30
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:06,946
- Ed, does it matter who wears pink or blue?
- No!

31
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:11,046
Cotwell... Cotwell... Where is that little...

32
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:15,290
Dinner with the Westfalls tonight.

33
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:19,559
Don't forget to do your breathing exercises
Dr Phillips suggested.

34
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:23,592
- l have a breathing scheduled at 11.
- Bless your soul.

35
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:26,436
Have a wonderful day.

36
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:32,841
Bing?

37
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,038
What did you forget?

38
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:39,451
Oh, my pen! Thank you, Andrews.

39
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:42,379
What else?

40
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:46,221
Darling, you know how
l hate games in the morning.

41
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:51,992
Of course. Goodness, how could l forget?

42
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:54,528
Don't you get...

43
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:58,798
Don't you get into any mischief
while Dada's gone. Burble, burble.

44
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:03,070
Won't it be exciting when he can understand
the wonderful things we say to him?

45
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,871
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

46
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:39,402
He can't look too butch,
but he can't look too feminine.

47
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,277
He has to look angelic, like a little prince.

48
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:45,283
That would suggest blue.

49
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:49,719
Blue? Won't that look like we're trying to
match his eyes? Won't it be too obvious?

50
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:53,088
l see lots of babies with
blue eyes and blue outfits.

51
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:56,185
What kind of babies?
Rich babies? Pretty babies?

52
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:59,493
- Regular babies? lmportant babies?
- Regular babies.

53
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:02,593
Baby Bink is not a regular baby.

54
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,344
Buff, buff, buff, buff, buff.

55
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:14,846
Oh, but how shiny they're getting.

56
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,650
Now, now. Hold still.

57
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:33,429
Ready? Very, very handsome. Let me see.

58
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:05,428
Hello.

59
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,966
Get the gear.

60
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,570
Get the gear.

61
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,666
- He didn't say ''Get the gear, Veeko.''
- l'm the supervisor. You get it.

62
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:19,939
You got the blue sweater.
You help me get the gear.

63
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:33,983
A most pleasant and
charming good day to you, sir.

64
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,793
l am Mr Charlie,

65
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:44,194
photographer de babe,
entirely at your service.

66
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:51,505
You were expecting us?

67
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:57,641
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

68
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:00,242
Whoa, look at this place!

69
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:04,654
Eddie.

70
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:18,629
We ain't here to nick no bric-a-brac.
We're here for the hit of a lifetime.

71
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:21,673
You wanna be a shoplifter, go to JC Penney.

72
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:32,275
You think we can get away with this?

73
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:36,287
No. l'm here because l've got
a wild curiosity about the electric chair.

74
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:38,887
Sorry.

75
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:05,107
What a gorgeous baby.

76
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:07,584
You must be so proud.

77
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:10,389
l'm Mrs Cotwell.

78
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,185
l am Mr Charlie.

79
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:15,393
Shall we begin?

80
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:33,411
Mr Francis, if you will go to the vehicle
and retrieve my light meter.

81
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:45,083
l'm going to be rich.

82
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:48,054
l want individual photos of Baby Bink.

83
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:51,722
Baby Bink? What
an absolutely delightful name.

84
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:54,698
- lt's a pet name for Bennington.
- Certainly.

85
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:58,897
l want individual photos of Baby Bink,
and then a portrait of the two of us.

86
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:01,702
Whatever you wish, however you wish.

87
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:04,766
You photographed
the children of many of my friends.

88
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:09,109
Those pictures are forever appearing
in newspapers and magazines.

89
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:11,274
lt is true.

90
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:16,213
- His picture's never been published.
- That cannot be.

91
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:17,984
lt's true.

92
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:24,724
l am sure in the not-so-distant future
this little fellow will be very well known.

93
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:29,126
l want your very best. l want art.

94
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:32,830
l want you to set a new standard
for beauty in baby photography.

95
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,866
l so welcome the challenge, madame.

96
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:40,675
And, to that end, may l ask one small favor?

97
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:44,274
May l have some time alone with the child?

98
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:52,019
Oh, l need his complete attention.

99
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:58,121
The great bond between you and your son,
his love for you, will distract him.

100
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:05,103
l need to study his marvelous little features,
to learn how best to photograph him.

101
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:11,109
He does well with persons
he is not intimate with?

102
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:17,007
Does he?

103
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,284
He's a friendly boy, but he may not like...

104
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,183
Excellent!

105
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:25,284
Madame, if l might make a suggestion.

106
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:32,456
Your garment du jour, while
extremely magnificent, is so colorful,

107
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:35,467
l am afraid it will dominate the photograph

108
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:39,096
and detract from your natural beauty.

109
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,601
l knew this outfit was wrong.
l'll be back in 15 minutes.

110
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:48,644
Take all the time you need.

111
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:55,510
lf he gets cranky,

112
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:57,816
read him his book.

113
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,949
How invaluable.

114
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:03,685
Thank you.

115
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:22,212
Mr Andrews, get the winter wardrobe.

116
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:24,806
- But, madam...
- Hurry, Gilbertine.

117
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:40,261
There you go.

118
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,458
Take the book.

119
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:57,007
Bink really deserves this moment
in the spotlight.

120
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,712
lt's too bad the baby pictures
don't go on the front page.

121
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:02,986
- Ma'am?
- Yeah?

122
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,826
We gotta make this fast.

123
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,681
l'm sorry it took so long.

124
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,625
Where's Bink?

125
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:40,615
Eddie?

126
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:45,020
You're a smart guy. How do you tell
the front from the back on these diapers?

127
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:47,616
Are there pockets in the front?

128
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:55,791
- Very funny. The front and back are the same.
- Then it probably don't make no difference.

129
00:15:56,202 --> 00:16:01,731
Put him in them regular baby clothes. That
fruit suit's a dead giveaway he's a rich kid.

130
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:05,803
Come on. Good boy.

131
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,073
Ed?

132
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:41,476
How do l know this milk
won't burn the kid's throat?

133
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,571
lf that matters.

134
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,311
Try it on some skin first.

135
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:56,888
What's the matter with you?

136
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,925
l better let it cool down.

137
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:05,934
You like that?

138
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:07,370
Eddie?

139
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,533
Watch the baby.

140
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:19,180
Very good. Now see if it works the other way.

141
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:28,026
lt works.

142
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,233
Put him in the bedroom.

143
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:41,637
The more he sleeps, the less attention
he draws from the neighbors.

144
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:44,505
- And keep an eye on him.
- Here you go, kid.

145
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,841
That little doo-doo machine
is my retirement money.

146
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:50,914
All right.

147
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:53,177
Nappy-nap time, little jerk.

148
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,518
Go to sleep real nice

149
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,526
cos Mr Teddy Bear over here,

150
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:06,656
he's been up all night drinking with
the Barbie dolls and he needs his rest.

151
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:09,592
All right. Drink your milk.

152
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,431
Take your nap.

153
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:14,937
Drink your milk! Take your nap!

154
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:20,170
- Eddie!
- What?

155
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:24,444
You got any suggestions how you
get these things to eat and sleep?

156
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,076
Sing him a song.

157
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:49,999
~ Mary had a little lamb

158
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:54,205
~ Little lamb

159
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:57,073
~ Little lamb

160
00:18:57,883 --> 00:19:02,343
~ Mary had a little lamb

161
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:05,754
~ Her hair was white as snow

162
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,458
~ And every which way that Mary went

163
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:14,055
~ The lamb was right behind her

164
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:17,468
~ lt followed her to work one day

165
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,539
~ Work one day, work one day

166
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:24,542
~ lt followed her to work one day

167
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,636
~ And Mary lost herjob

168
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,844
Eddie! What else did Mary's little lamb do?

169
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:38,014
Didn't he put Humpty Dumpty
back together again?

170
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,758
That was Nat King Cole.

171
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:47,424
Nat King Cole stuck his finger in the pie
and yanked out the bird.

172
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:52,560
How can a lamb put a Humpty
together again? He ain't got fingers.

173
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:56,002
~ And then she went to unemployment...

174
00:19:56,075 --> 00:20:00,273
Norby! Knock off the singin'
and read him his storybook.

175
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:03,877
lf you can.

176
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,447
Wanna hear a story?

177
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,122
Let's see here. What do we got here?

178
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:27,535
''Nanny...

179
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:29,664
and Baby Boo...

180
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,869
strolled...

181
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:36,039
through...

182
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:38,675
the great big...

183
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:43,221
de...

184
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:47,083
de...

185
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:51,524
- department.
- ..department store.''

186
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,464
''How many, many things there were to buy.''

187
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,228
Or steal, if l was writin' that book.

188
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:02,198
Or steal, if l was writin' this book.

189
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:40,910
Mrs Cotwell? Dale Grissom, FBl.

190
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:43,072
l'd like to ask you a few questions.

191
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:45,446
You'll have to ask me later.

192
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:50,147
- l'm going to look for my baby.
- l'd rather you didn't. l need you here.

193
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:54,014
- Don't coddle me, Mr Grissom.
- Mrs Cotwell,

194
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:58,894
there are five million people in this city
and many places where your boy could be.

195
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:03,697
lt would be pointless and dangerous
for you to go out searching for your baby.

196
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:08,398
l've been through a number of these cases.
l understand how you feel.

197
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:12,766
Have you ever lost a child?

198
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:15,113
No, ma'am.

199
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:18,041
Then you can't possibly know how l feel.

200
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:24,188
l apologize. But would you stay here, please?

201
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,022
For your baby's sake.

202
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:11,453
Do you gotta do that?

203
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:16,492
l like to look nice.

204
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:19,228
You gotta spit?

205
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:25,204
l don't know about you,
but l don't eat pieces of my body.

206
00:24:58,143 --> 00:25:00,043
What?

207
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:03,370
- What did l do?
- You spit on me.

208
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:05,609
- l did not!
- Somebody did,

209
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:07,982
and you're the only one in the room.

210
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:26,161
You jerk!

211
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:29,366
What? No, no. Quiet.

212
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:32,443
- You're gonna wake up the baby.
- The baby's on the roof!

213
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:48,525
Hurry. Come on, hurry.

214
00:26:10,148 --> 00:26:12,013
Eddie!

215
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:17,544
Ed. Hey, Ed, what happened?

216
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,385
Eddie, are you OK?

217
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:27,962
- People shouldn't leave this lying around.
- What are you doing, dope?

218
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:30,261
lt was in the way.

219
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,003
- What happened?
- Right, pick him up.

220
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:35,164
Eddie. Ed, you're drooling.

221
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,303
- Eddie, come on. Come on, Ed. Come on.
- Eddie, what happened? Eddie?

222
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:42,905
What? This way?

223
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:47,813
Oh, great. lt's gotta be at least 1,000 feet.

224
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:50,878
- Ed, we're gonna have to jump.
- We're gonnajump?

225
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:54,447
- Yes. On three. Ready?
- OK.

226
00:26:54,593 --> 00:26:55,651
One.

227
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:57,386
Two.

228
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:58,496
Three.

229
00:27:06,738 --> 00:27:09,138
Eddie!

230
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,264
Ed, look...

231
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:36,266
out!

232
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:04,393
- What?
- Package.

233
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:09,324
- Where do you want me to sign?
- Anywhere's fine.

234
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:18,932
Have a nice... day.

235
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:21,070
You old bat.

236
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:27,218
- Which way?
- This way.

237
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:43,161
Ed!

238
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:46,033
Are you all right?

239
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:49,562
How can he be all right?
The guy fell off a building.

240
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:54,634
Probably got contusions, concussions,
contractions. What's the matter with you?

241
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:18,125
- Just take it easy. How you feelin'?
- Eddie, how many fingers l got up?

242
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:21,195
- Two.
- Not you! Hey, Eddie, say somethin'.

243
00:29:21,273 --> 00:29:24,538
- Here, put him here.
- Sit down on the bench. Sit down.

244
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:26,844
You OK?

245
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:28,572
Eddie.

246
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:30,512
When we first seen you fall,

247
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:35,485
our first thoughts were with you
and your family, should you not survive.

248
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,020
- l prayed, Eddie.
- Shut up!

249
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:03,503
All right, take it easy.
You wanna maybe get to the right of him.

250
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:12,252
Wait, Eddie. We don't wanna get a ticket.

251
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:19,994
- Get to the right. Eddie, get to the right.
- Shut up!

252
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:25,235
Move in front of him. l'll jump on the back.

253
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:27,897
- You're makin' me nuts!
- OK. Don't get crazy.

254
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,238
- Just drive. l'll tell you.
- See that lady over there?

255
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:38,248
There he is! l see him! There he is!

256
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,109
We got him.

257
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:44,847
He's gone! We lost him!

258
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:55,259
Look both ways!

259
00:30:57,035 --> 00:30:58,468
l think you hit a cat.

260
00:30:58,537 --> 00:31:02,871
Here's the bus. Eddie, you see it?
He's gettin' ahead of us, Eddie.

261
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:05,272
There's the bus again.

262
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:12,606
Driver, next stop, please.

263
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,361
Wait, l don't see him.

264
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:39,009
- There's the bus.
- l see the bus!

265
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:41,136
l'll get him!

266
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:44,481
Wait! Wait! Stop the bus.

267
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,718
l forgot somethin'! Stop the bus!

268
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:51,255
Wait, wait, wait! Hello! Stop the bus!

269
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:55,726
Halt! Stop the bus! Wait! Stop the bus!

270
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:04,666
Did a baby get off this bus?
A little guy, about two feet tall.

271
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:08,227
- lt's an emergency!
- l didn't have nobody today with a baby.

272
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,670
He was by himself!

273
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:16,637
- What?
- He must have got off.

274
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:19,781
Oh, great. We're through.

275
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:26,591
lf you didn't park your van on the sidewalk,

276
00:32:26,658 --> 00:32:29,684
people could get by a lot easier.

277
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:37,728
lf you'd limit yourself to a couple of pork
roasts a day, you wouldn't need to worry.

278
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:39,769
You heard me.

279
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:48,804
Some people.

280
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:54,611
- Eddie, how could he get off?
- l seen him.

281
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:57,416
- What?
- He's in the big broad's purse.

282
00:32:58,356 --> 00:33:03,760
Yeah, this is Carl in 157.
You know anything about a missing baby?

283
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:07,596
l see her. How could you miss her?
She's as big as a building.

284
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:11,033
- Eddie, let me do this.
- Will you stop it?

285
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:15,402
- How do we do it?
- Nonchalant. We'll give her a sandwich.

286
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:19,432
- She don't need a sandwich. Look at her.
- That's my whole point.

287
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:21,843
Wait.

288
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:40,296
Eddie.

289
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:42,457
Get her, Veeko! You get her, Veeko!

290
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:50,673
Get her, Veeko. You got her, Veek.
Hang in there, Veek. You got her! Come on!

291
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:52,035
Who's next?

292
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:58,073
How about you, Mr Comedy?
''We'll give her a sandwich,'' huh?

293
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:01,016
''As big as a building,'' huh?

294
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:04,681
Not so easy making jokes
with my fist in your mouth, is it?

295
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:07,690
- l'm not afraid of you.
- Come on. She's crazy.

296
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:10,590
Anybody else wanna take a shot?

297
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:17,626
Chicken!

298
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:05,379
How did you get out of
Mother Goose Corner?

299
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:23,057
So, you got a nasty little surprise for me?

300
00:35:29,607 --> 00:35:31,837
You guys are worthless!

301
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,242
Yeah, right, Eddie. Blame us.

302
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:39,375
- You know, l'm gettin' sick of your insults.
- Then why don't you quit?

303
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:44,218
- Oh, yeah? Let you two have all the money?
- What money? The kid is gone!

304
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:47,291
There you go, my little escape artist.

305
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:56,330
Now, if you were a baby
lost in the big city, where would you go?

306
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:24,490
,,speculation, but a ransom figure
in the millions of dollars was mentioned,

307
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:29,863
Security is tight around the Cotwell mansion
and at Cotwell lndustry Towers downtown,

308
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:32,562
Ronnie Lee has more on the story, Ronnie?

309
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,662
There's no word from police,
but our sources tell us

310
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:40,403
that a nine-month-old baby boy was abducted
at approximately ten o'clock this morning,

311
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:43,675
We have confirmed that
a photographer and two assistants

312
00:36:43,781 --> 00:36:46,409
from the Downtown
Baby Photographers studio

313
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:50,477
were scheduled to photograph
the missing child today,

314
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:53,819
A spokesman for the photography
studio declined to comment,

315
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:27,189
,,extremely tight, ln fact, police
and FBl units have sealed off the area,

316
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:31,885
Earlier l attempted to reach millionaire
Bennington Cotwell at his office.

317
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:37,826
Though reporters were turned away,
a reliable source informed us that Cotwell...

318
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:44,873
A spokesman for the company said
that Mr Cotwell was unavailable.

319
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:54,451
Hang on a second. Keep rolling. OK.

320
00:38:14,672 --> 00:38:17,004
Where'd he go?

321
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:39,689
We're always, like, this close.

322
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:57,776
- Hello.
- Hello, ls this Mr Cotwell?

323
00:38:57,882 --> 00:39:02,114
- Yes. Who is this?
- My name's Depke, Joe, Joe Depke,

324
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,886
Yeah, Listen, l might have some information
on the whereabouts of that child,

325
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:20,429
- l seen the baby.
- Where?

326
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:22,631
Right across the street on the curb.

327
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:24,732
Where'd he go?

328
00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:30,744
lt's the craziest thing. l don't remember.

329
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:33,749
Maybe we'll take a ride.
See if you remember then.

330
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:37,309
- You want money? How much?
- Don't embarrass me. Don't insult me.

331
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:40,823
- Your money's no good here. Put it away.
- Where's the baby?

332
00:39:40,892 --> 00:39:43,019
House across the street.

333
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,221
Second floor.

334
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:51,565
McCrays. No guarantee.
Listen, mister, l didn't know your kid.

335
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:53,762
l just saw his picture on TV.

336
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:57,430
l called because l care.

337
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:09,248
- Your name's McCray?
- Yeah. What did l do?

338
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,153
We're looking for a missing child.

339
00:40:12,256 --> 00:40:15,589
- These are my kids.
- Mind if we take a look?

340
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:22,157
Hello, ma'am.

341
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:30,171
Hi.

342
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,169
Sir, in here.

343
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,317
Baby.

344
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:15,944
You have a beautiful little boy.

345
00:41:18,923 --> 00:41:20,982
Thank you, ma'am.

346
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,453
l'll pray he comes back to you.

347
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:30,998
These kids are all l've got, so l know
how l'd feel if l was in your place.

348
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:34,162
l hope you never are.

349
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:38,472
For your children's sake.

350
00:41:48,186 --> 00:41:50,279
Sorry we inconvenienced you.

351
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:53,548
Be there in a second.

352
00:41:56,894 --> 00:41:59,988
- l'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sir?

353
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:07,093
l believe in my heart that someone
somewhere watches over the babies.

354
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:12,337
Yes, l hope so.

355
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:20,116
You have everything? Are you sure?

356
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:46,302
l can't believe this. You know,
it ain't the wisest strategy to kidnap a baby

357
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:49,210
and then let the damn thing
loose on the streets.

358
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:53,716
Babies crawling in traffic tend
to draw attention, don't you think?

359
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:06,956
To the left, l think. You see? The cab.

360
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:20,035
Got you now, you little...

361
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:30,510
- Eddie!
- My money!

362
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,601
Come on! Come on! Go! Go!

363
00:43:49,607 --> 00:43:51,598
Go! No, wait!

364
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:55,409
Stay! Stay there!

365
00:43:55,513 --> 00:43:57,572
Stay there!

366
00:43:58,516 --> 00:43:59,983
Don't go!

367
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:03,349
Go! Now! Watch your feet.

368
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:08,224
Stay there!

369
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:11,819
OK, hang on. One, two, three - go.

370
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:33,581
l worked at Burger King three years.
This is worse than that.

371
00:44:33,684 --> 00:44:37,848
Don't blame me. We'd be restin' easy
if Butterfingers here hadn't lost the kid.

372
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:41,756
l lost the kid? l lost the kid?
Oh, well, that's news to me.

373
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:45,522
- Who fell asleep reading nursery stories?
- Who left the window open?

374
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:51,723
- That was me.
- You idiots are why we don't got the kid.

375
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:57,741
As far as l'm concerned, you can drop out and
l'll keep the $5m. You don't deserve a penny.

376
00:44:57,808 --> 00:45:00,504
- You'd stiff us?
- Wait a minute!

377
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:05,481
Don't get hot, Eddie. Don't get hot.
We're all just tired from gettin' torn apart.

378
00:45:06,017 --> 00:45:10,454
Like l like to fall off buildings
and jump in ditches! That's the breaks.

379
00:45:10,521 --> 00:45:12,489
We're dealing with a baby.

380
00:45:12,556 --> 00:45:16,219
Babies are obviously
more dangerous than we thought.

381
00:45:16,293 --> 00:45:19,057
lt don't figure, Eddie. They're so small.

382
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,622
When l boxed, the guys l most feared
were those who feared nothin'.

383
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,067
Babies are like that -
they ain't afraid of nothin'.

384
00:45:29,974 --> 00:45:31,737
Baby tracks.

385
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:54,294
Norby, hey.

386
00:46:55,793 --> 00:46:58,660
The kid's in the gorilla cage.

387
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:03,533
There goes our five million bucks, huh?

388
00:47:05,736 --> 00:47:07,897
l think the ape likes the kid.

389
00:47:18,883 --> 00:47:22,649
- What?
- You got long arms.

390
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:27,147
Thanks.

391
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:36,233
l can't reach him, Eddie.

392
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:41,163
That's it. You got it.

393
00:47:46,544 --> 00:47:48,637
Easy does it.

394
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,772
That's it. Slow, slow, slow. There.

395
00:47:52,883 --> 00:47:54,544
Easy.

396
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:18,130
Nice monkey.

397
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,768
Yes.

398
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:25,345
He's startin' to cry, Eddie.
He'll make the monkey mad.

399
00:48:28,185 --> 00:48:29,675
Eddie, he's gettin' up.

400
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:34,417
- l'm afraid, Eddie.
- Freeze. Just stare him down.

401
00:48:39,964 --> 00:48:42,057
That's it.

402
00:49:11,462 --> 00:49:12,724
Shut up!

403
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,944
Hey, King Kong. Hey, over here.

404
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,915
l'm a banana.

405
00:50:12,056 --> 00:50:16,117
l'm a coconut. l'm an entire fruit salad.

406
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,190
Over here. Hey, look. l'm the Jungle Boy.

407
00:50:19,296 --> 00:50:22,857
Over here. That's it.

408
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:25,526
Now you got it.

409
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:29,700
l got him.

410
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:36,142
l got him.

411
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,514
Bad monkey.

412
00:52:33,464 --> 00:52:35,523
- Eddie?
- Careful, Eddie.

413
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:04,545
Eddie.

414
00:54:06,223 --> 00:54:08,748
l know you don't wanna hear this, but...

415
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:13,954
the kid's gone again.

416
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:18,159
This morning all l wanted
was my baby's picture in the paper.

417
00:55:25,502 --> 00:55:27,629
l got my wish.

418
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:33,133
Where's your mommy?

419
00:56:08,512 --> 00:56:11,709
Hey, Eddie, maybe
he went down a rabbit hole.

420
00:56:11,815 --> 00:56:16,013
We're serious about our work.
You wanna make jokes, join the circus.

421
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:20,720
Bozo.

422
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:32,227
Step on it, Eddie. Baby, starboard side.

423
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:34,736
- Starboard.
- What?

424
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:36,931
- Port.
- What is that?

425
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,473
- Point!
- Nine o'clock!

426
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:41,443
- Where is he?
- Over here at 6:30.

427
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,742
Step on it.

428
00:56:46,616 --> 00:56:49,141
You're ours now, moneybags.

429
00:56:59,563 --> 00:57:02,828
Did Baby Bink miss his Uncle Eddie?

430
00:57:06,036 --> 00:57:08,129
- Come here.
- Get him.

431
00:57:11,108 --> 00:57:13,599
- Did you get him?
- No! Come on!

432
00:57:24,721 --> 00:57:26,848
Where'd he go?

433
00:57:26,923 --> 00:57:30,051
He went down a rabbit hole.

434
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:36,865
- Don't let those rabbits chew your face off.
- Shut up, Veeko. Just shut up!

435
00:57:38,568 --> 00:57:43,938
No problem, fellas. lt ain't a hole,
it's a tunnel. And what's every tunnel got?

436
00:57:44,007 --> 00:57:46,805
Don't tell me. l know, l know. lt's a...

437
00:57:47,644 --> 00:57:49,839
Toll booth at the end.

438
00:57:49,913 --> 00:57:53,781
Are you always this stupid,
or do you do this just to annoy me?

439
00:57:53,884 --> 00:57:58,878
A tunnel has two ends.
This one's here, and the other one's...

440
00:57:58,989 --> 00:58:01,389
Where? Come on.

441
00:58:15,305 --> 00:58:18,638
- Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Get him, Norby. Get him.

442
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:21,939
- Don't let him get away.
- Here he is, Eddie.

443
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:27,311
Today ain't your lucky day, eh, shorty-pants?

444
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:31,686
That wasn't so hard.

445
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:12,819
- Beautiful day, huh?
- You know anything about that vehicle?

446
00:59:18,435 --> 00:59:21,063
Yes. lt belongs to us.

447
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:23,037
You left the engine running.

448
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,932
Yes.

449
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,066
l did.

450
00:59:27,143 --> 00:59:30,874
l've been having battery trouble.

451
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:35,510
We just stopped by to admire the beauti...

452
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:41,157
beautiful flowers.

453
00:59:49,032 --> 00:59:52,024
Have you guys seen a baby around here?

454
00:59:52,235 --> 00:59:54,294
The park is full of...

455
00:59:56,072 --> 00:59:59,564
- babies.
- Yeah, well, there's been a kidnapping.

456
00:59:59,676 --> 01:00:02,167
Well, that's a cryin' shame.

457
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:05,242
lt's amazing what people will do for money.

458
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:07,374
Yeah, for five million...

459
01:00:08,551 --> 01:00:10,712
lf we see anything...

460
01:00:14,724 --> 01:00:16,487
Excuse me.

461
01:00:17,294 --> 01:00:21,458
lf we see anything, we'll be sure to notify...

462
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:52,954
He's got a bad heart.

463
01:01:02,238 --> 01:01:04,297
Excuse me.

464
01:01:06,876 --> 01:01:08,935
The police.

465
01:01:09,746 --> 01:01:11,737
Thank you.

466
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:20,579
Walk 'em to the car. My entire reproductive
system is about to go up in flames.

467
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:29,064
ls that a Fleetline van?

468
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:33,560
Eddie, is it?

469
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:37,164
- Yes!
- Yes, it is.

470
01:01:37,273 --> 01:01:39,400
l thought so.

471
01:01:39,509 --> 01:01:42,410
My brother drives one
for a dry-cleaning firm.

472
01:01:42,512 --> 01:01:45,140
Oh, yeah, they drive a lot of those.

473
01:01:45,215 --> 01:01:47,706
He's always had a lot of trouble with his.

474
01:01:47,784 --> 01:01:53,381
Give me a second, l'll think of what he said
is the problem with the electrical system.

475
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:55,549
- Alternator?
- No.

476
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:58,025
- Carburetor?
- No.

477
01:01:59,529 --> 01:02:02,657
- There's this little relay thing.
- Veeko!

478
01:02:02,732 --> 01:02:04,859
Veeko.

479
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:08,335
l think you should move the van.

480
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:10,702
l have a frog in my throat.

481
01:02:12,442 --> 01:02:16,037
And a brush fire in my undershorts.
Get 'em outta here.

482
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:20,708
lt's just a bad battery. l think we should
move it before the engine dies.

483
01:02:20,784 --> 01:02:25,744
Yeah, it's just the battery.
Let's get it outta here. Come on, let's...

484
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:37,795
You sure can tell summer's here.

485
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:40,369
People got those barbecues goin'.

486
01:02:44,307 --> 01:02:48,471
- Smells great, doesn't it?
- Come on, let's go move the van.

487
01:02:55,985 --> 01:02:57,885
l'll be right with you.

488
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:03,723
l just have a cramp in my leg.

489
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:20,073
Take it easy.

490
01:04:01,584 --> 01:04:03,950
That's how you put out campfires.

491
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,351
ls that a fact?

492
01:04:07,457 --> 01:04:09,516
Used to do it in Boy Scouts.

493
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:14,296
You toasted your marshmallows

494
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:18,266
over a pile of flaming gonads?

495
01:04:19,502 --> 01:04:21,732
We usually used logs.

496
01:04:23,273 --> 01:04:25,264
Follow that kid!

497
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:28,105
We'll meet you on the other side.

498
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:31,079
l'm sorry, man, but it was an emergency.

499
01:04:31,147 --> 01:04:34,275
- You were blazin' pretty hard...
- Shut up!

500
01:04:43,259 --> 01:04:45,352
Oh, boy, Eddie.

501
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:48,362
You got burnt clear through your skivvies.

502
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,530
Baby Bink! lt's your mother!

503
01:04:53,603 --> 01:04:55,195
Baby Bink!

504
01:04:55,305 --> 01:04:58,274
l'll kill him.

505
01:05:38,114 --> 01:05:40,344
l'm sorry, ma'am.

506
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:48,780
l haven't forgotten your feelings.

507
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,253
My feelings don't matter.

508
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:07,034
Yes, they do.

509
01:06:07,844 --> 01:06:09,869
They do very much.

510
01:06:12,215 --> 01:06:15,514
The love my baby's gotten
has been as much yours as mine.

511
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:21,348
Probably more.

512
01:06:28,298 --> 01:06:30,357
Where's my little boy?

513
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:35,868
What's he doing?

514
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:44,169
lf he were home,
he'd be going down for his nap.

515
01:09:46,596 --> 01:09:48,894
l got bad news.

516
01:09:48,965 --> 01:09:51,092
The kid's...

517
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:54,160
in there.

518
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:56,729
No, wait. Eddie, there's a guard.

519
01:09:56,873 --> 01:09:59,774
Eddie, no. Eddie, wait. No.

520
01:09:59,876 --> 01:10:03,141
- There's a guard.
- He's asleep, you moron.

521
01:10:05,348 --> 01:10:10,081
Where is he? Come on,
knucklehead. Where is he, huh?

522
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:18,885
Of course.

523
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:21,288
Where else would he be?

524
01:10:26,269 --> 01:10:28,328
Let's go get him.

525
01:10:59,135 --> 01:11:01,399
Eddie.

526
01:11:01,504 --> 01:11:03,495
Baby, 12 o'clock.

527
01:11:07,443 --> 01:11:09,035
Up there.

528
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:17,880
We'll be with you in just a minute.

529
01:11:23,993 --> 01:11:28,157
Lingerie, home furnishings,
men's hats, babies.

530
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:35,062
- Wait a minute. We passed him.
- Yes, moron. We'll grab him as he goes by.

531
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:38,937
Yeah, that's a good plan, Ed.
We grab him as he comes by.

532
01:11:39,008 --> 01:11:41,101
You grab him.

533
01:11:41,877 --> 01:11:43,936
- l grab him?
- Right.

534
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:48,481
As the girder comes up,
you jump out on it and grab the baby.

535
01:11:48,551 --> 01:11:52,715
- Me? By myself?
- You just step out on it. lt ain't difficult.

536
01:11:53,222 --> 01:11:55,952
- Why me?
- Norby's scared of heights.

537
01:11:56,092 --> 01:11:58,652
- Why don't you grab him?
- Nobody asked me!

538
01:12:08,337 --> 01:12:11,306
OK, OK. That's it.

539
01:12:11,374 --> 01:12:13,638
- Come on, don't miss him.
- l'll get it.

540
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:15,768
Don't miss it. He's coming.

541
01:12:17,446 --> 01:12:22,509
- All right. Don't grab, OK?
- l'm not touching you. There it is. Go!

542
01:12:34,296 --> 01:12:36,287
Here he comes.

543
01:12:40,369 --> 01:12:42,735
How'd he do that?

544
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,199
Baby luck.

545
01:12:59,622 --> 01:13:02,056
Eddie! Help me!

546
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:07,093
- He asked for you, Ed.
- He ain't thinkin' straight.

547
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:09,461
- Don't look down.
- What are you doin'?

548
01:13:09,532 --> 01:13:13,969
- Eddie, no! l'm gonna faint!
- Didn't l tell you not to look down?

549
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:16,436
- Pull me back, please!
- l'm losing my grip.

550
01:13:16,505 --> 01:13:19,338
- Pull me back, please.
- Grab him by the leg.

551
01:13:19,442 --> 01:13:21,706
Grab him by the leg or l'll let you go!

552
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:24,473
Don't look down.

553
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:26,538
OK, good. You got him.

554
01:13:31,587 --> 01:13:33,020
Up!

555
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,889
You're going the wrong way! Come up!

556
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:41,794
- Rest on my feet.
- l could use a hand here!

557
01:13:41,897 --> 01:13:44,889
Hey, quit being a crybaby. Get up.

558
01:13:50,406 --> 01:13:53,307
You're doin' good, but you gotta get back up.

559
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:55,775
- l'm losin' him, Eddie.
- Quit foolin' around.

560
01:13:55,878 --> 01:13:57,539
Gimme a hand.

561
01:14:01,283 --> 01:14:02,716
What's the matter with you?

562
01:14:17,032 --> 01:14:18,522
Ed?

563
01:14:20,736 --> 01:14:23,227
- Eddie?
- Get off of me.

564
01:14:32,782 --> 01:14:35,273
There he is.

565
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:37,876
Come on, we'll take the stairs.

566
01:15:33,676 --> 01:15:35,871
lt's comin' back down. Get ready.

567
01:15:39,348 --> 01:15:42,283
- Now, jump.
- l'll wait for another.

568
01:15:42,351 --> 01:15:44,512
No, don't wait. Jump.

569
01:15:44,653 --> 01:15:46,712
Jump!

570
01:16:13,349 --> 01:16:15,214
My...

571
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:17,149
spine.

572
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:30,253
- l lived.
- Get back up here!

573
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:41,295
Come here, you little ball of grief!

574
01:17:44,173 --> 01:17:48,132
Now l gotcha! You ain't
gonna crawl away from this one.

575
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,498
That hurt!

576
01:18:53,742 --> 01:18:55,642
That's it!

577
01:18:56,512 --> 01:18:59,242
No mercy!

578
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:08,921
This ain't no nursery-school
battle of wits anymore.

579
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:14,662
This is my five foot, ten inches
of guile, gut and gristle

580
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:20,430
versus your two and a half feet
of goo-goos, ga-gas and giggles.

581
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:27,404
lf the Mil...

582
01:19:34,716 --> 01:19:37,514
lf the Milwaukee Mob couldn't kill me,

583
01:19:37,619 --> 01:19:43,717
no milk-puking little thumb-sucker's
got a candle's chance in a cyclone

584
01:19:43,826 --> 01:19:46,056
of gettin' the better of me.

585
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:53,325
Where are you going?

586
01:19:57,473 --> 01:19:59,338
Come back here.

587
01:20:02,377 --> 01:20:05,744
This isn't funny anymore.

588
01:20:08,984 --> 01:20:11,452
My money!

589
01:22:11,974 --> 01:22:13,669
What?

590
01:22:13,742 --> 01:22:16,540
l thought l saw a baby
crawl around the corner.

591
01:22:18,847 --> 01:22:20,906
Good night, Donald.

592
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,211
Norby!

593
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:02,346
Veeko!

594
01:23:03,825 --> 01:23:07,056
Ed! We're down here!

595
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:17,063
Hey, Ed!

596
01:23:19,074 --> 01:23:21,508
We better go before l dry!

597
01:23:22,444 --> 01:23:25,379
Ed, can you see the baby from up there?

598
01:23:26,348 --> 01:23:30,284
Just hang on and we'll come on up.
l got an idea.

599
01:23:41,063 --> 01:23:44,999
We got some news. l don't know
if it's good, but it's not bad.

600
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,967
Since the media broke the story,
calls have come in.

601
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:51,731
There was a report of a man
looking for a baby on a bus this morning.

602
01:23:52,107 --> 01:23:55,372
A baby missing from
a department store care center.

603
01:23:56,678 --> 01:23:59,476
Another, at three o'clock, at the zoo.

604
01:23:59,548 --> 01:24:03,484
Shortly after that at a downtown park.
And a final report not long ago at...

605
01:24:03,552 --> 01:24:07,113
- A building under construction.
- Yeah, that's right.

606
01:24:09,691 --> 01:24:11,955
He's doing everything in the book.

607
01:24:16,898 --> 01:24:18,957
l know where he is.

608
01:24:20,068 --> 01:24:22,434
''Before returning home for supper,

609
01:24:22,504 --> 01:24:28,170
Nanny and Baby Boo stopped at
the Old Soldiers' Home to visit Mr Tinsel.''

610
01:24:28,276 --> 01:24:30,744
That's where he is.

611
01:25:28,036 --> 01:25:30,095
Come on over.

612
01:25:31,273 --> 01:25:34,242
lt's the kid, on television! The one that...

613
01:25:39,781 --> 01:25:42,579
Come on. That's it. Come on.

614
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:02,468
~ This is the army, Mr Jones

615
01:26:02,537 --> 01:26:06,496
~ No private rooms or telephones

616
01:26:06,608 --> 01:26:10,044
~ You had your breakfast in bed before

617
01:26:10,111 --> 01:26:14,707
~ But you won't get it there anymore

618
01:26:14,816 --> 01:26:18,616
~ This is the army, Mr Brown

619
01:26:18,687 --> 01:26:22,020
~ You and your baby went to town

620
01:26:22,491 --> 01:26:26,018
~ She had you worried, but this is war

621
01:26:26,094 --> 01:26:30,121
~ And she won't worry you anymore

622
01:26:30,332 --> 01:26:33,961
~ No, she won't worry you

623
01:26:34,069 --> 01:26:37,835
~ Anymore

624
01:26:55,056 --> 01:26:57,115
Baby.

625
01:27:20,448 --> 01:27:22,746
You had quite an adventure today.

626
01:27:22,851 --> 01:27:24,716
Boo-boo.

627
01:27:27,522 --> 01:27:31,515
- Boo-boo?
- lt's what he calls his book. He lost it today.

628
01:27:31,626 --> 01:27:35,084
We'll get you another one, sweetheart.

629
01:27:38,233 --> 01:27:39,564
What?

630
01:27:41,536 --> 01:27:43,265
What?

631
01:27:43,338 --> 01:27:46,000
Oh, l see. That's nice.

632
01:27:47,475 --> 01:27:50,672
That's not a boo-boo.
That's a clock. A ticktock.

633
01:27:50,745 --> 01:27:53,771
- Was there a ticktock in his book?
- No.

634
01:27:56,351 --> 01:27:58,911
Well, he's pointing to...

635
01:28:00,722 --> 01:28:05,056
His boo-boo. He's not pointing
at the ticktock. He wants his boo-boo.

636
01:28:05,126 --> 01:28:10,029
- l thought he was getting a new boo-boo.
- He means his boo-boo's back there.

637
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:17,263
Radio Rogers and McCloskey. Tell them we're
going to the ticktock to get the boo-boo.

638
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:19,239
And send for backup.

639
01:29:12,027 --> 01:29:17,522
Hey, Eddie, you sure you don't wanna
go check to see if they left the money?

640
01:29:17,632 --> 01:29:20,192
Oh, that's a good idea.

641
01:29:20,268 --> 01:29:23,533
We get the living hell
tore out of us by a baby!

642
01:29:23,705 --> 01:29:28,472
Three fully grown men versus
15 pounds of pink flesh with a mouth.

643
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:34,443
What chance have we got of strolling into
that alley and coming out with anything less

644
01:29:34,516 --> 01:29:37,041
- than 140 years in prison?
- No way.

645
01:29:37,118 --> 01:29:39,211
No, thank you!

646
01:29:39,287 --> 01:29:43,724
This is a hexed situation.
We walk away while we're still ahead.

647
01:29:43,825 --> 01:29:46,658
We took a lickin' and kept on tickin'.

648
01:29:46,728 --> 01:29:48,457
We'll go back to banks.

649
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:52,131
Dealing with grownups.
l don't want no kiddy stuff.

650
01:29:52,233 --> 01:29:56,567
- We did all right with banks.
- Or a convenience store once in a while.

651
01:29:56,671 --> 01:30:03,668
You know, one thing l learned from all this:
l ain't never gonna have any kids of my own.

652
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:11,241
Yeah, seeing as you burnt down the only tree
in your forest, l wouldn't worry about it.

653
01:30:13,655 --> 01:30:15,452
Why don't you shut up?

654
01:30:15,924 --> 01:30:20,918
l don't wanna ever hear another word
about that rotten, snake-bit baby.

655
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:25,126
l'm serious!

656
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:33,066
l'm hearing that little vermin in my thoughts.

657
01:30:33,141 --> 01:30:35,575
l wanna erase him from my mind.

658
01:30:38,413 --> 01:30:40,540
Did you hear that?

659
01:30:41,483 --> 01:30:44,577
- Yeah.
- You know what it sounds like?

660
01:31:02,771 --> 01:31:05,137
He's back.

661
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:30,558
You dirty, no-good little stool pigeon!

662
01:31:30,665 --> 01:31:34,066
You're surrounded. Throw down the boo-boo.

663
01:31:38,973 --> 01:31:41,669
And put your hands over your heads.

664
01:32:25,253 --> 01:32:27,312
This is the end of the story.

665
01:32:53,948 --> 01:32:55,882
Good night, sweetheart.

666
01:32:56,551 --> 01:32:58,610
Good night, Bink.

667
01:33:06,694 --> 01:33:10,960
Did l tell you? The baby's
having his picture taken tomorrow,

668
01:33:11,065 --> 01:33:14,034
- Say hello to old Willy,
- l will,

669
01:38:33,454 --> 01:38:35,854
