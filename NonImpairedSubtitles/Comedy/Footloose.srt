1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Two, two, one, two.
Mic check one, two. One, two.

2
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:12,277
Oh, yeah. rall know
what's coming up, don't you?

3
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:14,713
Come on, I got it right here.
I got it right here.

4
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:17,049
Bomont High School, where you at?

5
00:00:18,683 --> 00:00:23,225
We got something to celebrate!
Bomont Panthers, 31!

6
00:00:23,388 --> 00:00:29,199
Bayson Bulldogs, 17!
We killed 'em, y'all! Yeah!

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,134
All right, I want eveybody
on the dance floor! Come on!

8
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:35,068
What? What? rall ready to party?

9
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:41,079
Get up, get up! I thought
this was a party! Let's dance!

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,012
Been woking so hard

11
00:00:44,176 --> 00:00:46,581
I'm punching my card

12
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,551
Eight hours for what?

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,753
Oh, tell me what I got

14
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,591
I've got this feeling

15
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:58,562
That time'sjust holding me down

16
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,069
I'll hit the ceiling

17
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,408
Or else I'll tear up this town

18
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:14,778
Tonight I got to cut loose

19
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:18,450
footloose
_ck off your Sunday shoes

20
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:22,454
Please, Louise

21
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:25,122
Pull me ofl of my knees

22
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:27,725
Jack, get back

23
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,695
Come on, before we crack

24
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,098
Lose your blues

25
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:35,800
Eveybody cut footloose

26
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:12,472
Hey, Robert!

27
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,811
Yeah!

28
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:18,581
Bomont High, where are you at now?

29
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:23,119
- I'm not kidding.
- They did not!

30
00:02:23,283 --> 00:02:25,821
- Yes, they did.
- They did not.

31
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:27,189
We going to Mama's?

32
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:31,362
We're about to get real wild tonight,
y'all! Come on!

33
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:40,437
- Ron, where we going tomorrow?
- We're going to Mama Cannon's.

34
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,974
I'm sorry, guys.
Suzy gets the final call.

35
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,009
Turn it up, turn it up!
It's the best part!

36
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:48,379
Louder, Bobby!

37
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:15,209
Dispatch, stand by. I've got the
driver here. License and registration.

38
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:18,077
- Step forward for me, please, sir.
- All right.

39
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:23,517
He is testing us.

40
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,522
Our Lord is testing us.

41
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,426
Especially now...

42
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,897
...when we are consumed with despair.

43
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:40,337
When we are asking our God
why this had to happen.

44
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,244
No parent should ever have to
know the horror

45
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:49,844
of burying their own child.

46
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:53,416
And yet...

47
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,855
...five of Bomont's brightest
have lost their lives.

48
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:01,758
Among them, my only son.

49
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,530
My boy. Bobby.

50
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,240
We have other children
to raise here in Bomont.

51
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:19,945
And one day, they will
no longer be in our...

52
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,051
...embrace and in our care.

53
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:26,786
They will belong to the world.

54
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,426
A world filled
with evil and temptation...

55
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,061
...and danger.

56
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:41,101
But until that day,
they are ours to protect.

57
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:46,476
That is the lesson to be taken
from this tragedy. That is our test.

58
00:04:51,143 --> 00:04:55,352
We cannot be missing
from our children's lives.

59
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:17,542
The following measures will be read
and voted on accordingly.

60
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:22,113
A cu_ew for minors under the age of 18
will take effect immediately.

61
00:05:22,277 --> 00:05:25,616
Minors must be home
by ten p. m. on weeknights,

62
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:28,518
11 p. m. on weekends.
All in favor, say "Aye. "

63
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:31,989
- Aye.
- Opposed.

64
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:33,288
Motion carries.

65
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:36,327
Punitive measures will be taken
against any individual,

66
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:39,463
group or property owner who organizes
a public gathering

67
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:42,632
where minors engage in
inappropriate activities.

68
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:46,839
Such activities include consumption
of alcohol or unlamul drugs,

69
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:49,640
listening to vulgar or demeaning
amplified music,

70
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:53,847
or participating in lewd
or lascivious dancing.

71
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,481
- All in favor, say "Aye. "
- Aye.

72
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:57,914
Motion carried.

73
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:01,655
There will be no public displays of
dancing unless supervised as part of

74
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:04,423
a school, civic or
church-related function.

75
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:07,026
Outside of these
authorized institutions,

76
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:11,198
public dancing among Bomont's minors
will be in violation of the law.

77
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:14,402
- All in favor, say "Aye. "
- Aye.

78
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:19,741
Reverend? Your vote, please.

79
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,616
- Aye.
- Opposed. Motion carried.

80
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,302
This is my car.

81
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,209
Momma, it's Ren! He's here!

82
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,010
I'm gonna beat you!

83
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,450
Hey, girls. How you doing?

84
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,150
You guys are huge!

85
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,355
- Get off of me! Attack of the cousins!
- Who'd you find, Amy?

86
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,126
- Hey, darling.
- Hey, how you doing?

87
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,231
Good. Hope you got some
sleep on that bus.

88
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:16,298
Yeah, I got plenty of sleep.
No worries, Lulu.

89
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,634
- Hey, boy.
- Wesley.

90
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,434
You used to call me Uncky Wes.

91
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:22,437
You too big in the britches
for that now?

92
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,673
- Is anybody hungry?
- I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

93
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,613
- Sounds good. Need a hand with that?
- I got it, thanks.

94
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,049
Hey Ren, I wanna tell you a ioke.
How do you make a tissue dance?

95
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:33,984
Put a little boogie in it.

96
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,855
Hey, buddy, I tell you about
these baked beans?

97
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,325
Your great grandma Esther,
who you didn't know.

98
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,925
This is her secret recipe.

99
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:44,094
Yeah, you know what
the secret ingredient is?

100
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,528
Bourbon.

101
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:48,500
It's not bourbon. It's a ton of butter.

102
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:52,104
- That's code for bourbon.
- Now, we do burgers on Saturdays.

103
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:55,775
I didn't know if you were a vegetarian,
or a vegan or something?

104
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,077
No, no, no, this is great, it's good.
Thank you.

105
00:08:58,242 --> 00:08:59,845
- It's grass-fed beef.
- Thank you.

106
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,011
With a bit of possum.

107
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:03,750
- OK. Whose turn is it?
- Daddy's!

108
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:07,554
Let's ioin hands. Bow your heads.

109
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,927
Most gracious heavenly Father,
we ask you to bless this food,

110
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,399
nourishment of our body and
greater strength for Thy good.

111
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:19,401
Help us be ever mindful
of the needs of others.

112
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:21,468
- Amen!
- Amen.

113
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:26,876
This used to be my office,
but Lulu fixed her up for you.

114
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,613
It's got all the essentials...
water, power, bed.

115
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,789
Look, I appreciate what you've
done here. Taking me in and all.

116
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:45,095
There, at the end, the money
you sent us... It really helped.

117
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,865
I wish I could have done more.

118
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:52,870
Now, look... there's rules in my house.

119
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,605
They're not written down,
they're just common sense.

120
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,981
Do your schoolwork. Don't stay out late,
that's not just my rule, that's the law.

121
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:05,084
And don't give people attitude.
This ain't Boston.

122
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:07,217
I really want to
pull my own weight around here...

123
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,088
Cooking meals, getting work,
helping out.

124
00:10:10,252 --> 00:10:13,692
My buddy, Andy Beamis runs
a cotton gin up on Chulahoma.

125
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:15,759
He said you can start
in the middle of next week.

126
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,560
Couldn't I work at the car lot with you?

127
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:20,566
I'm good with engines, oil changes.
That's how I made money back home.

128
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:25,473
In this economy, that's the best I got.
I suggest you learn to love it.

129
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:27,139
Come on.

130
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:30,442
How am I supposed to
get to work and school?

131
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:32,679
You got subways out here in Mayberry?

132
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:35,013
There's that Yankee sarcasm
I've been hearing about.

133
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:38,786
Wish it were funnier. OK.

134
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:42,723
You say you're good with engines?
I'll make you a deal.

135
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:46,895
If you can get this baby running,
she's all yours.

136
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:53,836
- This?
- That's a bad-ass car, boy.

137
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,873
OK, OK. The door sticks.

138
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:01,243
And the gas pedal's missing.
A couple of the, uh...

139
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:02,877
Hey, it's a fixer-upper.

140
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:14,454
He did it! He did it!

141
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:20,193
Have a safe trip!

142
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,847
Oh, shit!

143
00:13:57,898 --> 00:13:59,701
Step out of your vehicle, son.

144
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:04,541
- Is there a problem, officer?
- Driver's license.

145
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:11,114
Massachusetts, huh?

146
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,016
You got that music cranked
pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack.

147
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,286
You gonna throw me in iail
for playing Quiet Riot?

148
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,220
Let's watch that attitude, son.

149
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:20,022
- Yankee sarcasm.
- What was that?

150
00:14:20,187 --> 00:14:22,759
Nothing. Sir.

151
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:26,399
- You'll have to appear in court.
- For what?

152
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,531
Disturbing the peace.

153
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,736
Peaceful out here, isn't it?

154
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:38,979
Progress.
What does progress mean to you?

155
00:14:40,476 --> 00:14:42,948
We have computers in our pockets,

156
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:47,053
telephones in our automobiles,
and money on a plastic card.

157
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:50,723
Who here today remembers a time
when you had to go

158
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,326
inside the bank to get your money?

159
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,465
Remember old Mr. Rucker
down at Bomont State Bank?

160
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:02,472
Every time you made a deposit, he'd
give you a piece of Bazooka gum.

161
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:05,940
Now, I haven't yet met an ATM machine

162
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:09,176
that would give me a piece
of Bazooka chewing gum,

163
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:15,153
let alone make me feel special,
like Mr. Rucker did.

164
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,284
Now, is that progress?

165
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,321
Today...

166
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:25,964
...more and more, as families,
we are tuning each other out.

167
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,995
We're either su_ing on the Internet,

168
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,333
texting on our cell phones, or
staring mindlessly at a television set.

169
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,811
Now, if that is a portal to the world,
I want no part of it.

170
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:44,884
These are the people
that we need to tune in to.

171
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:48,819
Everyone in this church.

172
00:15:49,618 --> 00:15:52,523
- Thanks for coming today.
- Nice preaching today, Reverend.

173
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:54,358
- Good to see you.
- Yes, sir, you, too.

174
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:58,564
This is my sister's son, the one I was
telling you about. Ren MacCormack.

175
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:01,299
- Ren, Ren, welcome to Bomont.
- How you doing?

176
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,701
- We are so happy to have you with us.
- Thank you.

177
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,405
I think you're gonna like
Bomont High School.

178
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:09,841
In fact, if I'm not mistaken,
the graduating class this year

179
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:12,511
is the biggest in the school's history.

180
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:14,345
Hey, Roger! Come on over here!

181
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:16,682
How many seniors
we have at Bomont High this year?

182
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:21,389
- About 220, give or take a dropout.
- Roger's the school principal there.

183
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:24,357
- Hello.
- Wait... Do you play football?

184
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:29,031
- 'Cause we really need a good kicker.
- Ain't that a fact!

185
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:32,032
But, remember, if you're gonna play
for us, you gonna have to stay clean,

186
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:36,438
keep out of trouble. I heard you
already had a run-in with the law.

187
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:38,037
You what?

188
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:42,478
I don't know how it is up in Boston,
but down here we have rules

189
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:44,244
against playing music too loud.

190
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,616
You're kidding me.
He got popped for playing music?

191
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,687
Ariel! I want you to meet my daughter,
she goes to Bomont.

192
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:53,521
You're going to need a friend
on your first day.

193
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:57,260
This is Ren MacCormack. He'll be
attending school with you tomorrow.

194
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:02,366
- Hey.
- Hey.

195
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,466
- Hey, Dad?
- Yes, honey?

196
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:06,434
Rusty and I have that
science project due tomorrow,

197
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:09,974
we're going to be working on it pretty
late. I was thinking I'd stay over.

198
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:14,212
- Is that OK?
- On a school night? Is that necessary?

199
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:17,749
Rusty! Don't you think
it's gonna take us all night?

200
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:21,520
Sure. At least.

201
00:17:22,785 --> 00:17:27,427
- I guess it's fine, right...
- Thanks, Daddy. Bye, Mom.

202
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:32,597
Come on, let's go.

203
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:39,973
And with _o laps to go,
the leader is car number_,

204
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:41,573
Chuck Cranston!

205
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:07,001
Coming around the last turn
on the final lap...

206
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,469
We have a winner!

207
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:11,139
In the number _ car,
it's Chuck Cranston

208
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:14,342
crossing the line first
for the checkered flag!

209
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:16,209
Let's hear it for Chuck!

210
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:20,816
Yeah! He iust won!

211
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:29,057
Yeah, baby!

212
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:31,459
Yeah, baby!

213
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:35,132
Today's late-model division
Two-time champion, folks.

214
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:38,970
Give it up for Chuck Cranston!
Way to go, Chuck!

215
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:42,407
Go up there, you get that flag and
get that cute ass out here right now!

216
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:43,839
Come on, now!

217
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:50,181
Hey, what are you doing?
Come back here with that!

218
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:53,217
- Ariel, what the hell are you doing?!
- Hammer down, baby!

219
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,922
Oh, yeah. Come on, now.

220
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:01,994
Chuck Cranston! I don't care if
your daddy does own this track,

221
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,329
you've got to get her out of here!

222
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:08,100
You can chase me down, old man.
Chase me down!

223
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:11,671
Get back here! You're going to
get yourself killed out there!

224
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:20,615
Once again, ladies and gentlemen, your
late-model division _o-time champion.

225
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:23,082
Let's give it up for Chuck Cranston!

226
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,806
Thanks for coming out to the
Cranston Motor Speedway.

227
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,907
- Rusty!
- We hope you had a good time.

228
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:47,240
Rusty, I'm talking to you!

229
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:49,210
You know when you're watching
the news, and you see someone

230
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:51,546
- get killed doing something stupid?
- God, this again?

231
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:54,583
I don't want to be that stupid friend
who just stands around watching.

232
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:58,055
- He should never let you do that!
- So you're just going to leave me?

233
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:01,691
Me?

234
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:04,794
Leave you?

235
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:09,567
I don't know what's going on
with you anymore.

236
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,470
Ever since Bobby...

237
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:17,309
- I guess I'll get my own ride back.
- I guess you will.

238
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:44,836
Yellow flag.

239
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:46,840
Yellow flag.

240
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,014
Baby, why we got to go so fast?

241
00:20:56,182 --> 00:20:58,887
You want some choirboy
to put a promise ring on your finger?

242
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,954
You're not gonna find that with me,
preacher's daughter.

243
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,694
Stop. I get that from everybody else.
I don't need that from you.

244
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:07,694
I thought it was real simple
with you and me.

245
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:09,497
Yeah?

246
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:11,900
I'm your man.

247
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:14,703
You're... you're my rebel child.

248
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:18,673
I'm not a child.

249
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:27,215
Prove it.

250
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:31,221
Shut the door.

251
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,496
Shut the door.

252
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:41,764
Go on.

253
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:19,638
Are you going to pout all day?

254
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:23,608
Look, I already said I was sorry.

255
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:28,849
It's Monday. Everybody gets a do-over.

256
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:32,016
- You love me!
- I know I do!

257
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:50,805
Isn't that that new kid
my mom introduced me to at church?

258
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:52,806
Sure is. He's cute.

259
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:56,812
- You think everybody's cute.
- I know, but I think he's cute.

260
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,052
He dressed up for his first day
of school. That's so cute!

261
00:24:03,216 --> 00:24:05,486
Oh, my God, Rusty. Come on, let's go.

262
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,423
Did you see his tie?
I like it and I'm going to tell him.

263
00:24:08,588 --> 00:24:10,825
- That's a nice tie.
- Rusty.

264
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,993
Hey, I mean it!
Don't let anyone tell you different.

265
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,262
Thanks, uh...

266
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:16,933
- Rusty.
- It's Ahriel, right?

267
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:21,671
It's Ariel.

268
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:26,177
- Ariel.
- Very good.

269
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,622
Hey. Watch where
you're going, little guy.

270
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:12,591
- Sorry, man. I didn't see you.
- It's like driving.

271
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:14,092
Stick with the
flow of traffic, numbnuts.

272
00:25:14,258 --> 00:25:16,663
Maybe if you weren't wearing
all that camouflage, I could see you.

273
00:25:16,828 --> 00:25:19,667
You should get one of them orange
vests so hunters don't shoot you.

274
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:22,036
An orange vest? I don't wear orange.

275
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:25,139
I'm not a Tennessee fan.
I'm a Georgia Bulldog.

276
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:27,674
Where you from? You talk funny.

277
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:32,149
I talk funny? I talk funny?
You should hear you from my end.

278
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:34,514
I'm from Boston.

279
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:37,251
Massachusetts?

280
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:40,857
- It's in the United States?
- Yeah, I read that somewhere.

281
00:25:42,956 --> 00:25:44,426
What's up, man? I'm Willard.

282
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:52,337
- I'm Ren. MacCormack.
- Nice to meet you. Let me see this.

283
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:55,872
Literature and Composition.
That's this way. Follow me.

284
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:57,940
People give you shit
about that tie yet?

285
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:03,115
- Nah, but the day iust started.
- First group, on your mark...

286
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:06,049
Keep that head down! Head down!

287
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,553
I'm gonna smoke your butt, man.

288
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,889
- You think so?
- I know so. Your butt's getting smoked.

289
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,863
Come on, Willard!

290
00:26:24,568 --> 00:26:26,238
Go get your water.

291
00:26:26,403 --> 00:26:28,841
Don't gulp it down!

292
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,743
Warm it up in your mouth.

293
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:32,911
Two swallows, hit them monkey bars.

294
00:26:33,077 --> 00:26:36,818
- You're looking flushed, Willard.
- My cheeks are naturally ruddy, man.

295
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,187
Ren, this is Woody, our team captain.
You don't gotta salute him.

296
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:42,756
- What's up, man? Nice to meet you.
- How's it going?

297
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:46,394
Last year, varsity made it to regional.
They bussed us down to Alabama.

298
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,763
The excitement never stops.

299
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:52,367
- You haven't been overseas?
- I've been to Alabama, if that counts.

300
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:54,034
No. It doesn't.

301
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,672
I went to Russia two years ago
with my gymnastics team.

302
00:26:56,836 --> 00:26:58,673
It's kind of a sister city
thing with Moscow.

303
00:26:58,838 --> 00:27:02,278
Yeah, Russia... I don't know if I
dig that. It sounds kind of boring.

304
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:03,877
Do you know anything
about Russian girls?

305
00:27:04,043 --> 00:27:07,116
I know they range from
bearded to drop-dead beautiful.

306
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,450
Yeah? Well, I can vouch
for the beautiful ones.

307
00:27:09,616 --> 00:27:10,885
Two girls from the Russian team

308
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:13,523
snuck me out of my dorm room
late night. They didn't have beards.

309
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:16,293
- They were smoking.
- What were they smoking?

310
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:20,797
Oh, you mean, like, smokin' hot.
I'm sorry. Continue.

311
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:24,368
So we go to this club.
The music's banging. It's pitch black.

312
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:28,540
I couldn't see shit, iust hot two girls
drenched in sweat all over me.

313
00:27:28,704 --> 00:27:31,242
- We danced all night.
- Great. What'd you guys do after?

314
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:35,280
Oh, come on. Look, down in the South,
you can't start a story

315
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:37,414
about a threesome and not finish it.

316
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:40,150
Come on.

317
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,490
It goes without saying,
these girls are flexible.

318
00:27:44,654 --> 00:27:48,328
They take me into a bathroom stall.
One shoves her tongue down my throat,

319
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:52,265
the other one's on top. This girl's
a champion pommel horse gymnast.

320
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:56,637
I'm talking killer
upper body strength. Banging.

321
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,604
She's scratching my back,
she's tearing my clothes off.

322
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:02,009
And her friend's whispering
in my ear, "Hernnya. "

323
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:04,277
- Her...
- Hernnya.

324
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:06,144
- Hernnya.
- Yeah.

325
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,185
- What does that mean?
- It's Russian for "bullshit. "

326
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:11,683
Why would she say that?

327
00:28:15,822 --> 00:28:18,961
- 'Cause you're bullshitting me?
- Yup. Yeah.

328
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:21,128
But we did dance, man.

329
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:24,431
We danced our asses off.

330
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,303
That ain't right.

331
00:28:42,115 --> 00:28:46,223
You ever work at a gin before?
You know about a bale press?

332
00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:48,624
I don't know. I've never seen one.

333
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,863
- Where are you from?
- Boston, Mass.

334
00:28:52,026 --> 00:28:54,296
Did they teach you
anything useful up north?

335
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:57,902
Just enough to get by. I'm hoping y'all
can teach me the three R's.

336
00:28:58,066 --> 00:28:59,168
Three R's?

337
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:01,972
Yeah, you know...
reading, writing, redneckery.

338
00:29:05,007 --> 00:29:07,244
People are giving you
a hard time, I can see that.

339
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:10,381
You're young, you're from out of town
and you're a smart aleck.

340
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:13,050
Can you start Thursday?

341
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:16,755
Yeah. Yes, sir!

342
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:20,592
I'll teach you to read and write,

343
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:23,429
but you're on your own
when it comes to redneckery.

344
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:30,769
Yeah. Give it a little bit of gas.

345
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,241
Yeah, that sounds good. Cut it.

346
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,414
What's the deal with the preacher's
daughter? She worth all that attitude?

347
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,715
I hear, back in the day,
she used to be a goody two-shoes.

348
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,354
Now she fronts like she some hellraiser.
Wearing her jeans tight and everything.

349
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,087
You could put a quarter
in that girl's back pocket

350
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,788
and tell if it's heads or tails.

351
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,857
Why? You're trying to knock boots
with her, aren't you?

352
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,526
- No.
- Yes, you are. He is.

353
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:55,631
I'm iust curious. I ain't trying to
bang her or take her ballroom dancing.

354
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,600
Well, that'd be pretty hard,
being that that's against the law.

355
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,870
What? Banging a preacher's daughter?

356
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:02,871
No, public dancing's against the law
if you're under 18.

357
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:04,706
Shut up.

358
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:09,144
Wait, wait, wait. Jump back.

359
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,115
Are you kidding me?
Dancing is against the law?

360
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,483
Yeah, man. We got laws
up the poop chute around here.

361
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:19,090
I can't even bring a bandana to school,
because they think I'm in a gang.

362
00:30:19,254 --> 00:30:21,558
If my face gets sweaty,
I gotta use the back of my hand.

363
00:30:21,723 --> 00:30:24,796
Let me tell you something,
this country was built on bandanas.

364
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:27,833
So you're telling me Bomont High
doesn't have a prom.

365
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:31,636
Well, you know...
They got the Fall Ball, right?

366
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:34,206
OK. So, all the churches
get together and put it on.

367
00:30:34,403 --> 00:30:37,008
The whole town shows up
and everybody's eyes are on you

368
00:30:37,173 --> 00:30:39,811
to make sure you're dancing
at least six inches away from your girl.

369
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:41,814
You gotta add
another two inches for me.

370
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:46,421
And, for one song, they make you...
They make you dance with your mother.

371
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,487
I mean, talk about a boner killer.

372
00:30:49,453 --> 00:30:51,791
And the schools don't wanna
have dances on their property.

373
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:55,195
They... They say they
don't want to be held liable.

374
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,129
They don't want to be held
liable for what?

375
00:30:57,294 --> 00:30:59,899
Five seniors died in a car crash
coming home from a dance,

376
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:01,500
and that's when
the whole town went crazy.

377
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:05,340
They started blaming it on the liquor,
the music, the dancing.

378
00:31:05,503 --> 00:31:08,610
After a while everybody
started thinking dancing was a sin.

379
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:12,381
But we're talking about the law, right?
Not heaven and hell?

380
00:31:12,544 --> 00:31:16,986
Yeah, take that up with Reverend Moore.
I'm a machine, I'm a machine.

381
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:21,421
Hey, what's up, dude?

382
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,125
Hey, Woody, what's up, man?

383
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:28,563
Hey, how you doing?

384
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:30,530
- MacCormack.
- How you doing, buddy?

385
00:31:30,697 --> 00:31:33,202
- Good, man. You hungry?
- Yeah. What's good here?

386
00:31:33,366 --> 00:31:36,205
We got nachos, hot dogs, hamburgers.

387
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,039
Frito pie, all the way.

388
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:39,807
And if you're a real man?
You'll eat that jalapeño.

389
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,743
- Get your fingers out of my pie!
- What about that guy?

390
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,245
You don't know where his finger's been.

391
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:46,383
Woody! Check the door, man.
Cop still here?

392
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:51,854
Five-O getting his move on.

393
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,160
- What you got for me, Uncle Claude?
- David Banner.

394
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,429
Bootleg. Don't get too krunk out there.

395
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:01,666
First sign of the police,
I'm gonna pull the plug.

396
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:04,436
I don't wanna get a fine,
and you don't wanna get another ticket.

397
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,076
- Wait. You got a ticket for dancing?
- He got two tickets for dancing.

398
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:11,843
One more and he's off the team.

399
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:16,383
All right. Let's get
this party started! It's on!

400
00:32:16,547 --> 00:32:20,054
- No cops. Let's get it, come on!
- Let's get it started!

401
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:22,555
Yo! It's shomime!

402
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:24,389
- It's clear!
- Let's go!

403
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:28,293
Back it up, back it up, move out.

404
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:37,136
Whoa.

405
00:32:55,655 --> 00:32:57,759
- Woody!
- Woody!

406
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:05,299
Whoa!

407
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:07,936
Now that's what I'm talkin' about.
That's a beautiful thing!

408
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:10,807
Does that turn you on?
Girls acting like hussies?

409
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:12,575
It don't suck.

410
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,076
Oh, now, come on.

411
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:19,315
Yeah, dude. They... they get into it.

412
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:24,353
Hey, you. Let's go.

413
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,990
Come on, let's dance.

414
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,836
- Come on!
- I'm good. I don't dance.

415
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:40,338
You go have fun.

416
00:33:46,544 --> 00:33:48,714
Me and my boys are going
to push everybody back.

417
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:51,117
Let me see you do that city boy thing.

418
00:33:51,282 --> 00:33:52,617
C'mon! Get it!

419
00:34:43,037 --> 00:34:44,774
Oh, dang. Oh, dang.

420
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,260
Claude!
Reverend Moore's out front, man.

421
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:15,440
Oh, shit.

422
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,445
You want me to step in on this?

423
00:35:26,218 --> 00:35:27,486
What, you can't keep up?

424
00:35:27,652 --> 00:35:31,494
You can put on a show for that guy.
Doesn't mean I'm gonna.

425
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:37,164
Attention, attention. Ar9el Moore,

426
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:39,934
will you please come up
to the front of the diner.

427
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:42,436
Your daddy is here for you.

428
00:35:44,737 --> 00:35:46,373
She's busted!

429
00:35:54,547 --> 00:35:56,083
Show's over.

430
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:12,804
You mother was afraid you didn't
have any money. She said you'd be here.

431
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:14,670
Daddy, it's not a big deal.
We were just messing around.

432
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:17,875
I think it would be best
if you came home with me.

433
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:20,878
Right now.

434
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,284
Daddy gonna
take her out to the woodshed.

435
00:36:26,415 --> 00:36:28,285
What the hell does that mean?

436
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:30,454
It means she's in deep shit.

437
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:40,233
- Hey, honey. You're home early.
- Yeah.

438
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:41,766
Did you have fun?

439
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,910
- Just breaking the law, Momma.
- Ariel. We have not finished talking.

440
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,876
Ariel!

441
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:57,585
Why do you think you're above serving
your penalty in Saturday School?

442
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,387
I don't think I'm above anyone, sir.
I was just unaware that...

443
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,689
Hey, Eddie? Eddie?

444
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:05,860
He has a iob on Saturdays
over at Andy's cotton gin.

445
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,994
Wes. Call me "Judge," would you?

446
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:12,035
- And take your hat off.
- OK, Judge Eddie.

447
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:16,238
Could you show a little mercy here?
He was playing his music too loud.

448
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,441
About as loud as you used to
play Lynyrd Skynyrd

449
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:21,277
in that old Impala
me and you used to roll in.

450
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:24,046
Remember that... Judge?

451
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,448
You'll have Andy verify his employment?

452
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:29,050
- Now hold on...
- Yes I will!

453
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,590
- Can I go back to the car lot now?
- Sentence suspended.

454
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:37,261
Oh, man. Son, you're lucky.

455
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:39,931
Not everyone's got this town
on lockdown like I do.

456
00:37:40,095 --> 00:37:42,934
Oh, yeah? Since you and the iudge
are so buddy-buddy,

457
00:37:43,098 --> 00:37:46,137
maybe you can have him explain this
whole ban-on-dance thing to me.

458
00:37:46,302 --> 00:37:48,639
Whatever happened to separation
of church and state?

459
00:37:48,804 --> 00:37:50,942
What's church got to do with it?

460
00:37:51,107 --> 00:37:53,879
It seems to have everything
to do with everything around here.

461
00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:55,445
Let me ask you a question.

462
00:37:55,611 --> 00:37:58,616
If there's a football game Sunday
and you want to buy a beer, can you?

463
00:37:58,781 --> 00:38:02,155
- You can't buy beer on Sundays.
- And why not?

464
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:03,754
'Cause of church.

465
00:38:05,456 --> 00:38:09,631
You can in Boston, why not in Bomont?

466
00:38:10,627 --> 00:38:14,301
Look. Sunday is God's day.

467
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:17,773
If you want to drink beer on God's day,
you need to buy it on beer's day,

468
00:38:17,936 --> 00:38:20,307
which is Saturday.

469
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:22,476
It's right there in the Bible,
if you don't believe me.

470
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,479
Separation of God and beer.

471
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:30,186
And if God said it, I believe it.
That settles it! Now shut up.

472
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,292
Hey, MacCormack.

473
00:38:44,965 --> 00:38:47,069
Hey, what's up... Ariel?

474
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:51,173
Chuck Cranston wants to see you
at his daddy's racetrack tomorrow.

475
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:55,680
- Be there at two o'clock.
- OK. What happens at two o'clock?

476
00:38:55,842 --> 00:38:59,316
- Show up and find out.
- And what if I don't?

477
00:39:00,114 --> 00:39:04,021
- You're gonna miss all the fun.
- How come he sent you to tell me?

478
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:08,024
I volunteered.

479
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:16,133
If that shithog tries anything,
I'm gonna pound him.

480
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:18,503
- No fighting, Willard.
- No promises, Rusty.

481
00:39:19,302 --> 00:39:21,907
You guys, keep the smoke away
from her now. Her daddy smells that,

482
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:24,976
- he'll never let her hang out again.
- High school field trip's here.

483
00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:29,012
Twinkle toes.

484
00:39:29,178 --> 00:39:32,083
Watching you the other night,
that was real entertaining.

485
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:37,158
We thought we'd invite you out here.
Maybe you could put on a show for us.

486
00:39:37,321 --> 00:39:40,728
Chuck, didn't you hear?
He's real into gymnastics.

487
00:39:40,891 --> 00:39:42,461
Gymnastics.

488
00:39:44,728 --> 00:39:48,068
Well... I thought only fags
were into gymnastics.

489
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:51,238
I thought only assholes
still used the word "fag. "

490
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:56,676
Touché.

491
00:39:57,609 --> 00:39:59,079
Why don't you...

492
00:40:01,213 --> 00:40:02,348
...try dancing with this?

493
00:40:37,785 --> 00:40:43,496
Now... we race these buses
every weekend at the Derby Mash-up.

494
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:47,332
We race them in a figure eight,
just like this.

495
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:55,010
Two things you gotta worry about.
Your corners, and your intersection.

496
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,478
You fall behind, you're gonna
get hit by the leader.

497
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:03,150
You pull ahead, you iust might
get slammed by the guy in last place.

498
00:41:03,314 --> 00:41:06,954
What do you say, city boy?
Ready to race?

499
00:41:08,853 --> 00:41:11,792
I drove one of these at a pep rally
one time... it ain't easy.

500
00:41:11,956 --> 00:41:13,893
All right? If she flips over,
crawl out the side window.

501
00:41:14,091 --> 00:41:16,663
If it catches on fire, iump out of it.

502
00:41:16,827 --> 00:41:18,998
- Keep loose.
- Pump your brakes with your foot.

503
00:41:19,164 --> 00:41:20,599
Pump the brakes. Tell him.

504
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:22,435
- I iust told him.
- Cool. Pump them brakes.

505
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:24,872
- All right, man. Good luck.
- Whoa, whoa! Guys, guys.

506
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:28,444
This is pretty dangerous, right?
We could get killed?

507
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:35,286
We? What's this "we," white boy? Crazy.
We? Like I'd get my black ass up there.

508
00:41:35,415 --> 00:41:37,218
What'd I get myself into?

509
00:41:38,785 --> 00:41:43,694
How do, all you pissants? Welcome
to the Cranston Motor Speedway!

510
00:41:43,856 --> 00:41:47,763
Whoa, baby! You OK?
You kinda had a lot to smoke.

511
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:49,698
Don't be tellin' me
when I've had enough.

512
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:52,334
Looks like a lovely day for a bus...

513
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,935
I didn't say you had enough.
I just said you had a lot.

514
00:41:54,134 --> 00:41:59,478
If you want to lecture somebody,
go tell Sweet Buns to start his engine.

515
00:42:01,176 --> 00:42:05,718
We got one practice lap
before the green flag drops, folks.

516
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,556
It's a three-lap race to the
finish line, or the last man standing.

517
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,694
Gentlemen, start your engines!

518
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:22,998
Let's go!

519
00:42:25,768 --> 00:42:31,179
We've got homegrown hero
Chuck Cranston in Burn in Hell.

520
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:32,944
You're in my world now, boy!

521
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,281
On the outside, we've got the new kid

522
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:38,085
racing in the Fun Zone,
Ren MacCormack.

523
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:39,618
Go, Fun Zone!

524
00:42:39,783 --> 00:42:42,756
Caroline and Russell
are in the back of the pack, y'all.

525
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,790
Hey! Where's the green flag?

526
00:42:44,956 --> 00:42:47,193
- Improvise.
- Now we're coming into turn four,

527
00:42:47,326 --> 00:42:49,763
- getting ready for the green flag.
- Oh, yeah!

528
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:52,032
Preacher's daughter, my ass, baby!

529
00:42:53,899 --> 00:42:57,873
Green flag, green flag,
green flag! And... Go!

530
00:42:58,705 --> 00:43:00,875
Come on, Ren! Go!

531
00:43:01,574 --> 00:43:03,043
- Go, Ren! C'mon!
- Let's go!

532
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:07,050
They're coming around turn number one.
Fun Zone is loose around the corner.

533
00:43:07,914 --> 00:43:09,951
Hang in there! Hang in there!

534
00:43:13,387 --> 00:43:16,926
Chuck Cranston takes the lead,
with Russell on his ass.

535
00:43:20,127 --> 00:43:23,834
Caroline and MacCormack are door to
door, they're battling for third place!

536
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:26,802
You want a little smooch?

537
00:43:31,306 --> 00:43:32,641
She is tearing him up!

538
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:35,479
Coming out of turn four.

539
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:38,617
Here they come,
headed straight for the intersection!

540
00:43:39,782 --> 00:43:42,654
- Pump the brakes!
- Somebody better stop.

541
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:45,357
Somebody better do something!

542
00:43:45,521 --> 00:43:47,258
- Watch out, baby!
- Shit!

543
00:43:52,261 --> 00:43:56,303
- Caroline is into the wall!
- Sorry, girl.

544
00:43:56,466 --> 00:43:59,371
Russell! You damn son of a bitch!

545
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,375
Russell and MacCormack
are duking it out for second place.

546
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:15,521
Shit!

547
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:19,660
We got fireworks! God bless America!

548
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:22,662
And I'm on fire.

549
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:26,068
Chuck Cranston holds the lead
with one lap to go!

550
00:44:26,232 --> 00:44:27,400
Getting lonely up here!

551
00:44:27,566 --> 00:44:31,541
Oh, we've got us a regular
Mexican standoff, folks.

552
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:33,673
Don't you play chicken with me, boy.

553
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,810
Who's gonna back down?
Who's gonna back down?

554
00:44:35,976 --> 00:44:37,745
Somebody's got to back down.

555
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:39,914
- Oh, what the hell.
- No, no, no! Damn it!

556
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,257
Chuck is down!
MacCormack takes the lead!

557
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:48,890
Yeah!

558
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:50,358
Fire! He's on fire!

559
00:44:52,761 --> 00:44:53,762
Damn it!

560
00:44:57,566 --> 00:45:00,371
- I got no brakes!
- Run! Hurry!

561
00:45:00,535 --> 00:45:02,338
We're coming for you, Ren! Hold on!

562
00:45:03,372 --> 00:45:04,774
Oh, my God!

563
00:45:05,775 --> 00:45:07,244
Hey man, did you know
your bus is on fire?

564
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:09,212
- Yeah, no shit!
- Stop this bus!

565
00:45:09,378 --> 00:45:11,048
- Pump the brakes!
- The gas pedal is stuck!

566
00:45:11,213 --> 00:45:13,217
- Do something!
- Abandon bus!

567
00:45:13,383 --> 00:45:15,086
Abandon bus!
We need to get off this bus!

568
00:45:15,251 --> 00:45:16,786
Ren, you gotta get off, man!

569
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:32,107
The wheels on the bus go
boom, boom, boom!

570
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:35,643
Yes, sir! Get some! Fire it up!

571
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:37,744
- You OK, baby?
- Oh, my God!

572
00:45:39,977 --> 00:45:41,480
Get some!

573
00:45:43,114 --> 00:45:47,088
That was awesome!
Let's do that again! Yes!

574
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:03,340
Hey, man. Chuck's pretty sore
about losing that race.

575
00:46:03,503 --> 00:46:07,310
I mean, you blew up
the man's bus, dude.

576
00:46:09,476 --> 00:46:13,651
Yeah... Bomont blows, dude.

577
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,685
I don't have to tell you, though, do I?

578
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:19,089
Yeah. I've been to Chicago. St. Louis.

579
00:46:19,253 --> 00:46:23,361
Been up to some of them clubs
in New York City. I been around.

580
00:46:23,524 --> 00:46:25,160
- Just like you, man.
- Oh, yeah?

581
00:46:25,326 --> 00:46:26,629
Yeah.

582
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:37,173
Hey.

583
00:46:38,207 --> 00:46:41,847
You get high?
'Cause I do... every damn day.

584
00:46:42,012 --> 00:46:45,118
If you want, you and I
can go burn one right after school.

585
00:46:45,281 --> 00:46:48,120
You know, city mouse, country mouse...

586
00:46:48,284 --> 00:46:49,653
Blazing!

587
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,224
What makes you think
I'm anything like you?

588
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:53,859
Hold on a second.

589
00:46:57,495 --> 00:46:59,799
This is what we call a take-homer.
You need anything else?

590
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,466
- I don't want this.
- It's cool. It's cool.

591
00:47:01,632 --> 00:47:02,734
No, it's not cool. Take this...

592
00:47:02,901 --> 00:47:04,971
We can go down to the
railroad tracks and chief one now.

593
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:06,839
- No, seriously, take this.
- Hey!

594
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:09,343
- What is that?
- What's what?

595
00:47:09,508 --> 00:47:11,245
In your hand. Let me see it.

596
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:12,678
Young man. Hey!

597
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:16,084
Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop, stop!

598
00:47:16,248 --> 00:47:17,985
Hey! Stop!

599
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:21,020
Open the door!

600
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:23,324
Open!

601
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,268
I will not tolerate it, Ren.
Not in my school.

602
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,934
So what have you gotta say for yourself?

603
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:35,938
What do I have to say? I was on
the gymnastics team for three years.

604
00:47:36,102 --> 00:47:38,941
Got drug tested all the time.
If I smoked weed, I'd be off the team.

605
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,710
- He had a ioint...
- You know what one looks like?

606
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:43,679
Were you going to smoke it or sell it?

607
00:47:43,845 --> 00:47:47,519
Mr. Parker says you were with
Rich Sawyer when this went down.

608
00:47:47,682 --> 00:47:50,187
- I don't even know that prick.
- Hey! Language.

609
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:51,953
Ren, level with me.

610
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,261
Was it Rich's ioint? You can tell me.

611
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:00,563
I don't do drugs.

612
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,867
You can test me.
And when it comes out clean,

613
00:48:04,033 --> 00:48:07,273
I want this guy investigated for
barging into the bathroom stall with me.

614
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:08,571
That's gross.

615
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,381
Well. Since we don't have the evidence,

616
00:48:14,544 --> 00:48:16,915
I'm going to let you off
with a warning this time.

617
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,986
But Ren, listen to me,
you have to understand something.

618
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:24,258
You see, life is not some big party.

619
00:48:24,421 --> 00:48:29,398
I don't care what the rap music
people say, marijuana is just wrong.

620
00:48:32,563 --> 00:48:34,266
Son, listen to me.

621
00:48:37,268 --> 00:48:39,806
Ren, I knew your momma.

622
00:48:39,972 --> 00:48:41,742
That's right. I knew Sandy.

623
00:48:43,075 --> 00:48:45,413
She had a wild spark, iust like you.

624
00:48:45,577 --> 00:48:48,917
Running off up north, trying to live
the high life might have been fun,

625
00:48:49,082 --> 00:48:51,119
but it also led her into getting
into some kind of...

626
00:48:53,352 --> 00:48:58,830
- ... unexpected trouble.
- Unexpected trouble.

627
00:49:00,426 --> 00:49:03,331
I'm thinking when you say "unexpected
trouble," you're talking about me.

628
00:49:03,496 --> 00:49:05,166
Right? Right?

629
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:09,506
Look, believe me, don't believe me.
Suspend me, arrest me. I don't care.

630
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,507
But you do me one favor, all right?

631
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:15,680
Never talk to me about my mother again.
You understand?

632
00:49:16,277 --> 00:49:17,445
Hey!

633
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,384
Let him go.

634
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,654
Hey, MacCormack.

635
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:28,491
What's the rush?

636
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:31,961
Dude, you trying to
ignore me or something?

637
00:49:32,128 --> 00:49:34,031
I'm doing the best that I can!

638
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,388
Massachusetts, huh?

639
00:50:28,555 --> 00:50:30,859
You got that music cranked
pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack.

640
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:33,129
"You got that music
cranked pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack. "

641
00:50:33,293 --> 00:50:34,863
Yeah! No shit, Barney Fife!

642
00:50:35,462 --> 00:50:36,965
Watch that attitude, son.

643
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:38,400
Try being a cop in Boston,
you huckleberry!

644
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:40,970
- I will not tolerate it, Ren.
- Shut up! I'm talking!

645
00:50:41,135 --> 00:50:42,137
Not in my school.

646
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,306
Mr. Dunbar.
Mr. Douchebag! Mr. Dumb-Ass.

647
00:50:44,472 --> 00:50:46,209
With your righteousness
and your little vest.

648
00:50:46,374 --> 00:50:47,777
Stop trying to act like you know me!

649
00:50:47,943 --> 00:50:50,414
Don't act like you know me. Don't try
and act like you know my mother!

650
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:52,449
You don't know the pain
she went through every day.

651
00:50:52,614 --> 00:50:54,284
You don't know shit!
You don't know shit!

652
00:53:12,965 --> 00:53:15,235
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

653
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:19,209
- Well, I thought I was alone.
- Not in this town, you're not.

654
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:21,210
There are eyes everywhere.

655
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,884
- So what was all that?
- What was all what?

656
00:53:27,014 --> 00:53:29,051
All that.

657
00:53:30,651 --> 00:53:33,923
I was iust letting off some steam,
I'm sure you got your own wicked ways.

658
00:53:37,959 --> 00:53:40,363
You think I'm a slut or something?

659
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:43,766
I think you've been kissed a lot.

660
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:48,840
- Where's lugnut?
- You mean Chuck?

661
00:53:49,637 --> 00:53:52,442
He doesn't own me. I know
he acts like he does, but he doesn't.

662
00:53:57,112 --> 00:53:59,015
You want to see something?

663
00:54:23,007 --> 00:54:25,112
Everybody calls it the yearbook.

664
00:54:25,277 --> 00:54:29,051
I don't know when it started,
maybe 10 years ago or so.

665
00:54:29,214 --> 00:54:32,688
- What is all this?
- Some are songs. Lyrics.

666
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:34,888
Quotes from books.

667
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:41,332
Poems. Music we're not
supposed to listen to.

668
00:54:43,229 --> 00:54:47,403
- What do people do? Just hang out?
- Yeah.
