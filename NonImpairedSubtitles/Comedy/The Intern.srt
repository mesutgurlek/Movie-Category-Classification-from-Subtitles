00:59:42,881 --> 00:59:47,017
No, actually, one is because
I am usually better than this.

1429
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:48,786
[ Sighs ]

1430
00:59:48,787 --> 00:59:51,522
The truth is...

1431
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:52,956
Something about you
makes me feel calm

1432
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:57,061
or more centered or something,
and I-I could use that.

1433
00:59:57,062 --> 00:59:59,530
Obviously.

1434
00:59:59,531 --> 01:00:03,267
I hope you'll accept my apology
and come back to work for me.

1435
01:00:03,268 --> 01:00:04,969
If you want.

1436
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,136
And I'm not just saying this

1437
01:00:06,137 --> 01:00:07,404
because
I screwed up this morning.

1438
01:00:07,405 --> 01:00:09,340
But I was thinking that

1439
01:00:09,341 --> 01:00:12,043
I'd like to bring you up to
my area, next to Becky.

1440
01:00:12,044 --> 01:00:15,780
I know you can handle more work.
If you'd like more. I...

1441
01:00:15,781 --> 01:00:17,649
Oh, God, I can't tell you
how much I hate

1442
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,017
that I jumped the gun
and I made you feel...

1443
01:00:19,018 --> 01:00:21,652
I'm coming back.
I-I'm happy to come back.

1444
01:00:21,653 --> 01:00:23,454
Excellent.

1445
01:00:23,455 --> 01:00:25,490
Can I give you a lift
back to the office?

1446
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:26,924
Sure, thanks.
Can I take this?

1447
01:00:26,925 --> 01:00:28,726
No.

1448
01:00:28,727 --> 01:00:30,261
[ Sighs ]

1449
01:00:30,262 --> 01:00:31,796
Actually,
do you mind driving?

1450
01:00:31,797 --> 01:00:34,400
- I don't technically have a license.
- Sure.

1451
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:40,805
This is...
this is crazy, Ben.

1452
01:00:40,806 --> 01:00:42,273
Two desks
are not gonna fit in here.

1453
01:00:42,274 --> 01:00:43,741
No, I promise
I'll stay out of your way.

1454
01:00:43,742 --> 01:00:45,943
But it's impossible because
now I don't have room for...

1455
01:00:45,944 --> 01:00:47,111
- hi.
- Hi.

1456
01:00:47,112 --> 01:00:48,379
This is good, right?

1457
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,880
I like this arrangement.

1458
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:52,349
Uh, Becky, I want you to let Ben
give you a hand, okay?

1459
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:53,718
And CC him
on all my e-mails?

1460
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:55,219
Did we get
yesterday's numbers?

1461
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:58,857
Uh, yes, we did.
I saw them here...

1462
01:01:01,326 --> 01:01:02,994
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1463
01:01:02,995 --> 01:01:05,295
And I need to go over the data
on customer purchase patterns.

1464
01:01:05,296 --> 01:01:06,697
Let Ben take a look
at that, too.

1465
01:01:06,698 --> 01:01:08,800
Actually, let Ben
take a look at that first.

1466
01:01:08,801 --> 01:01:09,833
Okay.

1467
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:11,802
Don't worry, Becky.
Backup's good.

1468
01:01:11,803 --> 01:01:13,672
Ping me
when Cameron gets in?

1469
01:01:15,908 --> 01:01:17,276
[ Cries ]

1470
01:01:19,411 --> 01:01:21,280
[ Crying ]

1471
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:31,357
Hey.

1472
01:01:32,858 --> 01:01:34,125
Becky?

1473
01:01:34,126 --> 01:01:36,527
I've been here nine months, Ben,
and she's never asked me

1474
01:01:36,528 --> 01:01:39,697
to take a look at anything
for her ever, okay?

1475
01:01:39,698 --> 01:01:41,432
I hear you.
That's frustrating.

1476
01:01:41,433 --> 01:01:43,567
I mean, totally.
I graduated from penn.

1477
01:01:43,568 --> 01:01:45,002
I have a business degree.

1478
01:01:45,003 --> 01:01:47,704
But I never seem to do
anything right around here.

1479
01:01:47,705 --> 01:01:51,709
And you're like 50 years older
than me and you're deaf.

1480
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:54,747
I happen to think you do
a lot of things right.

1481
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:58,950
You do so much.

1482
01:01:58,951 --> 01:02:01,051
I know.
I know that.

1483
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:02,487
- Mm-hmm.
- But she doesn't.

1484
01:02:02,488 --> 01:02:06,490
I mean, I bust my ass for her
14 hours a day,

1485
01:02:06,491 --> 01:02:08,525
and she never notices.

1486
01:02:08,526 --> 01:02:10,761
Oh. Oh, my God.

1487
01:02:10,762 --> 01:02:13,865
I hate
girls who cry at work.

1488
01:02:13,866 --> 01:02:16,133
How 'bout if you,
just as an experiment,

1489
01:02:16,134 --> 01:02:17,435
try letting me help you.

1490
01:02:17,436 --> 01:02:18,936
A lot of your stress
is gonna be lifted

1491
01:02:18,937 --> 01:02:20,871
once you're out from under
this mountain of worry.

1492
01:02:20,872 --> 01:02:23,407
And maybe you should consider
leaving here at a normal hour

1493
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:24,609
once in a while.

1494
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,077
See your friends.
Have a little fun.

1495
01:02:26,078 --> 01:02:29,647
Mm-hmm. I can offer
my assistance in this area.

1496
01:02:29,648 --> 01:02:33,217
I would love to,
actually.

1497
01:02:33,218 --> 01:02:37,421
I just don't want her to think
that I can't do my job

1498
01:02:37,422 --> 01:02:39,156
and I need an intern
to help me.

1499
01:02:39,157 --> 01:02:41,259
Okay, you're not gonna
want to hear this,

1500
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:44,561
but I heard women who sleep
less than seven hours a night

1501
01:02:44,562 --> 01:02:46,130
gain 38% more weight

1502
01:02:46,131 --> 01:02:48,900
than women who sleep
more than seven hours a night.

1503
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:50,501
What?!

1504
01:02:50,502 --> 01:02:52,136
I leave here at 11:00.
I get back at 7:00.

1505
01:02:52,137 --> 01:02:56,139
I sleep like five hours a night,
and now I'm gonna get fat?

1506
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,442
Let's get through this stuff.
Let's do it together.

1507
01:02:58,443 --> 01:03:00,044
Let's clean-slate it.

1508
01:03:00,045 --> 01:03:01,212
Let's just do it.

1509
01:03:01,213 --> 01:03:03,247
- Yes!
- Very nice, St. Louis.

1510
01:03:03,248 --> 01:03:05,850
- Ah, suede jacket in D.C.
- I cannot believe how well that sweater is doing.

1511
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:07,184
I'm so happy.

1512
01:03:07,185 --> 01:03:09,887
- Beautiful, Miami! Thank you.
- Oh! Look at Chicago!

1513
01:03:09,888 --> 01:03:11,856
She put the same boots in her
cart as the woman from Houston.

1514
01:03:11,857 --> 01:03:13,758
Okay, let's see
what she does at checkout.

1515
01:03:13,759 --> 01:03:15,259
[ Beeps ]

1516
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,060
She's not
buying them either.

1517
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:19,096
Okay, maybe check the
delivery cost on those boots?

1518
01:03:19,097 --> 01:03:20,097
Mm-hmm.

1519
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:22,766
- Knock-knock.
- Hey.

1520
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:25,269
Hi. I took a look
at the data purchase patterns.

1521
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:26,904
Uh, should I come back?

1522
01:03:26,905 --> 01:03:28,806
No, no, come on in.
That was fast.

1523
01:03:28,807 --> 01:03:30,641
Well,
I enlisted Becky's help.

1524
01:03:30,642 --> 01:03:33,377
It seems the most expensive
place you're advertising

1525
01:03:33,378 --> 01:03:36,480
is actually bringing you the customers
who are spending the least.

1526
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:38,549
And the channels
you're least investing in

1527
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:41,852
are adding enormous value in segments
that currently appear to have low value

1528
01:03:41,853 --> 01:03:44,888
but actually have
the highest spending potential.

1529
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:48,191
That's what I could tell
so far.

1530
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:50,728
Oh, Ben. Can you, like,
deal with that for me?

1531
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:51,895
Maybe come up with
a better plan?

1532
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:53,464
I mean,
if you have the time?

1533
01:03:53,465 --> 01:03:55,000
Happy to.

1534
01:03:55,967 --> 01:03:58,168
The man spent 40 years
in business.

1535
01:03:58,169 --> 01:03:59,403
Yeah, no, I get it.

1536
01:03:59,404 --> 01:04:01,171
And, Jules, Becky
was a huge help in this.

1537
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:03,240
You know she has
a business degree from PENN?

1538
01:04:03,241 --> 01:04:04,641
I know.

1539
01:04:04,642 --> 01:04:07,446
I mean, I forgot,
but I know.

1540
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:13,684
I'll say something
to her.

1541
01:04:13,685 --> 01:04:15,219
That would be very nice.

1542
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:17,889
Hey. How's it goin' up here
in first-class?

1543
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:20,324
Busy. I see
you found an apartment.

1544
01:04:20,325 --> 01:04:21,425
No.

1545
01:04:21,426 --> 01:04:22,627
My two weeks are up.

1546
01:04:22,628 --> 01:04:24,094
I'm movin' in
with my cousin.

1547
01:04:24,095 --> 01:04:25,063
Excellent.

1548
01:04:25,064 --> 01:04:26,496
In Philadelphia.

1549
01:04:26,497 --> 01:04:27,731
- Davis.
- What?

1550
01:04:27,732 --> 01:04:29,667
I'll get there by 11:00,
leave at 5:00.

1551
01:04:29,668 --> 01:04:31,201
It's cool.
I can handle it.

1552
01:04:31,202 --> 01:04:34,338
You know, I feel like
everybody's uncle around here.

1553
01:04:34,339 --> 01:04:35,539
Yeah, why is that?

1554
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,808
Because
I'm gonna save your ass,

1555
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:38,876
and I'm gonna put you up
for a few weeks.

1556
01:04:38,877 --> 01:04:39,677
Obviously.

1557
01:04:39,678 --> 01:04:41,078
Ben, thank you.

1558
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:42,780
Mwah!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1559
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:44,883
Okay. Okay.
Easy, fella.

1560
01:04:48,053 --> 01:04:50,321
Davis: I like that you do
the throw pillow thing.

1561
01:04:50,322 --> 01:04:52,523
I was married
for a very long time.

1562
01:04:52,524 --> 01:04:54,591
Mm.

1563
01:04:54,592 --> 01:04:57,627
Whoa.
Is this your closet?

1564
01:04:57,628 --> 01:05:00,531
Busy man about town.

1565
01:05:00,532 --> 01:05:02,099
What's in
all these drawers?

1566
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:05,135
Boxers, t-shirts,
pocket squares, handkerchiefs.

1567
01:05:05,136 --> 01:05:07,071
Okay, what's the deal
with the handkerchief?

1568
01:05:07,072 --> 01:05:08,672
That one
I just don't get at all.

1569
01:05:08,673 --> 01:05:10,041
Okay. It's essential.

1570
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:12,342
That your generation
doesn't know that is criminal.

1571
01:05:12,343 --> 01:05:15,312
The best reason to carry
a handkerchief is to lend it.

1572
01:05:15,313 --> 01:05:17,114
Ask Jason about this.

1573
01:05:17,115 --> 01:05:18,416
Women cry, Davis.

1574
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:19,750
We carry it for them.

1575
01:05:19,751 --> 01:05:22,185
One of the last vestiges
of the Chivalrous Gent.

1576
01:05:22,186 --> 01:05:24,054
Oh. Well, then
it's different than a po...

1577
01:05:24,055 --> 01:05:25,623
I know you want to hang,
but I...

1578
01:05:25,624 --> 01:05:28,091
I have to get some sleep, kid.
I'm pooped.

1579
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:29,261
Good night, Ben.

1580
01:05:30,561 --> 01:05:32,130
Thanks again.

1581
