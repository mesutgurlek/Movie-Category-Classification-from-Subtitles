1
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,677
I wouldn't want to live his life.
He hasn't been happy.

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,360
I think
if you can find work, stay healthy,

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,870
find somebody to share it,
you're the ultimate success.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,278
He's had some of the pieces
of the puzzle but not all of them.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,630
<i>I, Ronald Reagan,</i>
<i>do solemnly swear...</i>

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,228
<i>I, Ronald Reagan,</i>
<i>do solemnly swear...</i>

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,078
<i>That I will faithfully execute</i>

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,509
<i>the office of</i>
<i>President of the United States.</i>

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,756
<i>That I will faithfully execute...</i>

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,110
<i>When you're young,</i>
<i>your potential is infinite.</i>

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,877
<i>You might do anything, really.</i>

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,517
<i>You might be Einstein,</i>
<i>you might be DiMaggio.</i>

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,800
<i>Then you get to an age</i>
<i>when what you might be</i>

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,309
<i>gives way to what you have been.</i>

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,793
<i>You weren't Einstein.</i>

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,993
<i>You weren't anything.</i>

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,557
<i>That's a bad moment.</i>

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,156
Chuck, it's Pen.

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,551
Jesus. How did you find me?

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,558
You wrote me your last letter
on hotel stationery.

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,033
Fuck.

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,589
It's great to see you, Pen.
You look... beautiful.

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,113
This place is scary.

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,157
Yeah. The human psyche.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,799
I came to take you back
to California with me.

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,273
No.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,233
It's a lonely state without you.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,713
I am home, Red.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,072
I can't wait forever.
Please marry me.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,955
Well, apparently, I can.

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,548
But... I really don't want to.

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,113
Penny.

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,198
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm kind of busy right now.

34
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,673
OK?

35
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,874
<i>It was 1981, and I had holed myself</i>
<i>up in this New York hotel.</i>

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,752
<i>The Phoenix Hotel.</i>

37
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,950
<i>Terrified of everything.</i>

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,433
<i>Ashamed of my life.</i>

39
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,958
<i>Until finally I realised</i>

40
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,518
<i>my salvation might be in recording</i>
<i>my wasted life unflinchingly.</i>

41
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,633
<i>Maybe it would serve</i>
<i>as a cautionary tale.</i>

42
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,672
<i>Maybe it would help me</i>
<i>understand why,</i>

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,234
<i>when I was 11,</i>
<i>I had an experience</i>

44
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,388
<i>with my sister's friend Tuvia</i>
<i>that left an indelible impression.</i>

45
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,875
What?

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,355
- Tuvia
- What?

47
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,357
Wanna lick it?

48
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,357
No. Why should I?

49
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,876
Well, it tastes like strawberry.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,560
My sister tells me
you love strawberries.

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,716
Yeah, well, I hate strawberries.

52
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,718
Seriously. It tastes
like a strawberry lollipop.

53
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,798
- Look, I know that's not true.
- I bet you it does.

54
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,478
I bet you it doesn't.

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,158
I bet you a dollar.

56
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,792
<i>Tuvia.</i>

57
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,751
<i>My first love.</i>

58
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,799
<i>Perhaps my whole life</i>
<i>turned at that point.</i>

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,592
<i>The repulsiveness of my sex</i>

60
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,599
<i>confirmed by the taste buds</i>
<i>of a ripening pubescent girl.</i>

61
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,750
<i>And so I found myself</i>
<i>in a downward spiral of debauchery.</i>

62
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,155
<i>Endlessly chasing pussy.</i>

63
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,037
<i>My only focus in life to get laid,</i>
<i>get blown. Fool myself into believing</i>

64
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,550
<i>given the right combination</i>
<i>of circumstances and deception,</i>

65
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,559
<i>maybe the Tuvias of the world could</i>
<i>desire me the way I desired them.</i>

66
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,758
<i>I only wanted to loved.</i>

67
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,152
<i>A constant, inarticulate rage</i>
<i>led to bar fight after bar fight.</i>

68
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,954
<i>Directly across the avenue...</i>

69
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,356
<i>I had heard that television</i>
<i>was an industry with a future.</i>

70
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,515
<i>So I packed up</i>
<i>and moved from Philly to Manhattan.</i>

71
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,355
We began making
commercial broadcasts in 1941

72
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,951
and in 1953, NBC made the first ever
colour telecast by network

73
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,116
during the <i>Colgate Comedy Hour.</i>

74
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,552
Now we'll see the studio
where they make the <i>Today</i> show.

75
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,069
Excuse me, Miss. Do you know
where I can apply for NBC page?

76
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,352
<i>The Perry Como Show</i> which you
can tune into on Saturdays at 7:30.

77
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,438
<i>The Nat King Cole Show</i>
which you won't wanna miss

78
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,913
on Tuesdays at 8pm

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,792
and hold on one second...

80
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,876
OK. And my personal favourite,
<i>The Lux Show,</i>

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,672
starring Rosemary Clooney.

82
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,155
Which you can enjoy
every Thursday at ten.

83
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,158
And <i>The Steve Allen Show,</i>
on Sundays at eight.

84
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,350
You may like to know
that Steve Allen

85
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,074
got his start in entertainment
as an NBC page.

86
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,156
Ladies and gentlemen, follow me...

87
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,158
You know Raymond in accounting?
He's kinda cute.

88
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,271
Cute is all well and good, Marianne,

89
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,756
but what you want
is a man who's going places.

90
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,352
A go-getter
on the management fast track.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,549
Yeah, a management trainee
application, please, ma'am.

92
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,955
How many people
have applied for this?

93
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,753
Let's see.
Including you, about 2,000.

94
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,758
- For how many positions?
- Five.

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,428
Thanks, ma'am.

96
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,352
<i>Sometimes, as a younger man,</i>

97
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,869
<i>I stretched the truth</i>
<i>to get what I wanted.</i>

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,150
- Tell me again.
- Head of sales at 30.

99
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,555
Head of the entire network by 40.

100
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,355
I love you, Mr Chuck Barris.

101
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,596
Management trainee!

102
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,758
<i>Life was sweet.</i>

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,752
<i>For a minute.</i>

104
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,273
I got fired today.

105
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,713
Fired?

106
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,873
Yeah, fired.

107
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,673
Fired?

108
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,030
What the fuck did you get fired for?

109
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,549
I don't know.
Cutbacks, all that bullshit.

110
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,557
Look, it's gonna be fine.

111
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,953
I'm pregnant.

112
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,596
So, I figured, I'm gonna skip town.

113
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,916
I intend to be important, you know?

114
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,473
I can't be sad over this.

115
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,755
Then I remembered
something Carlyle said.

116
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,559
Do the duty which lies nearest thee.

117
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,630
- So you see...
- Who's Carlyle?

118
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,068
Dear God. Why do I?

119
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,911
Fuck you, you condescending prick.

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,194
Pregnant?

121
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,713
Yeah. Pregnant.

122
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,833
Fuck you.

123
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,791
Why the fuck
did you get pregnant?

124
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,273
Fuck you.

125
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,152
Why the fuck did I get pregnant?

126
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,794
You got me fucking pregnant,
you fuck.

127
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,273
Fuck you!

128
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,753
Fuck you. Fucking...

129
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,233
Fuck you.

130
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,993
Fuck!

131
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,348
Fuck you.

132
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,356
Looks like I was just late.

133
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,712
Yes. We had a great time.

134
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,071
The crew loved him and the show.

135
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,671
Because it was crazy and we could
do anything we wanted to, sort of,

136
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,268
and yeah.
They liked him very much.

137
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,753
He was a good guy.

138
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,953
Even though he's a prick,
he's a good guy too.

139
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,513
What a dream faculty.

140
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,553
Wouldn't school be wonderful
if we had a faculty like this?

141
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,514
Principal Sal Mineo,
Vice Principal Tony Perkins.

142
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,950
Imagine a school
where Sal Mineo was the principal.

143
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,753
<i>In '61, I had become</i>
<i>a minor suit at ABC.</i>

144
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,996
<i>It was during</i>
<i>the music payola scandal</i>

145
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,549
<i>so my job</i>
<i>was to commute to Philly every day</i>

146
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,593
<i>to the American Bandstand tapings</i>
<i>and keep an eye on Dick Clark.</i>

147
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,431
<i>On weekends, I used to</i>
<i>hang around amusement parks</i>

148
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,154
<i>because that's where</i>
<i>the young girls were.</i>

149
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,953
<i>I wrote a song about my experiences.</i>

150
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,876
<i>I got it</i>
<i>to Freddie Boom-Boom Cannon</i>

151
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,116
<i>through my friendship</i>
<i>with Dick Clark.</i>

152
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,276
<i>Dick really wanted to help me out.</i>

153
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,913
Hi.

154
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,393
- What?
- Hi.

155
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,278
I wrote this song.

156
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,835
It's number three on the pop charts.

157
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,750
- See?
- Uh-huh.

158
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,359
Yeah.

159
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,274
There's a great future in television.

160
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,150
Uh-huh.

161
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,750
I'm gonna take my royalties
and I'm gonna create a pilot.

162
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,269
A pilot's
what they call a test TV show.

163
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,152
I work in TV.

164
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,669
Yeah. What's your name?
I'm Chuck.

165
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,268
- Debbie.
- Debbie. So you live in Philly?

166
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,833
No. I live in Manhattan.

167
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,555
It's going to be a game show.
I see a great future in game shows.

168
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,750
- That's good.
- Yeah.

169
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,269
Everyone loves game shows, right?

170
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,039
- I don't know.
- Well, they do.

171
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,673
Well, that's great then.

172
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,153
I'm on my way.

173
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,073
Hello.

174
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,273
Hi.

175
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,151
Don't be alarmed.
I'm here with Debbie.

176
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,510
Yeah. I figured that.

177
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,392
- Hungry?
- Er... no, thanks.

178
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,279
- Thirsty?
- Sure.

179
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,073
If you have a beer...

180
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,472
So how was sex with Debbie?
I always wanted to know.

181
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,875
It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking.

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,353
No problem.

183
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,078
I just got fucked by this drummer
cat. A real righteous negro hipster.

184
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,553
Ha. Interesting.

185
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,116
We did the brotherhood of man.
I fucked an Oriental last week.

186
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,356
- What are you?
- Jew.

187
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,072
I had one of those once.

188
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,760
He was Sephardic.
You look Ashkenazi.

189
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,396
- Ashkenazi?
- Right. Ashkenazi.

190
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,277
I haven't had one of those yet.

191
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,753
You're a romantic.

192
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,078
Yeah, I just don't get into all
the bullshit between cats and chicks.

193
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,031
- I know what you mean.
- You know?

194
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,879
Otherwise you give your heart
to one cat and get hurt.

195
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,353
Don't I know it.

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,116
We could ball if you want.

197
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,833
That would be good.

198
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,152
What kind of name is Debbie?
It doesn't seem right.

199
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,155
That's true. I didn't think of that.

200
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,758
I'm going to go to bed.
It was nice meeting you.

201
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,634
What's your name?

202
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,553
I'm Penny.

203
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,033
I'm Chuck.

204
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,513
- Chuck Barris?
- Yeah.

205
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,359
You wrote that Palisades song.
I like that song.

206
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,392
- Well, thanks.
- Yeah, real sentimental bullshit.

207
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,513
Right.

208
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,879
Last night in my dreams, this ape and
I are sitting staring at each other.

209
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,309
It was like across time
and evolution.

210
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,956
And then he started talking but in a
language I didn't really understand.

211
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,353
Swiss, maybe.

212
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,516
And then he turned into Perry Como.

213
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,993
Real square.

214
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,473
What's wrong with you?

215
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,953
Nothing.

216
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,356
Just because we fucked
doesn't mean there are strings.

217
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,152
I just wanted to tell you.

218
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,794
Nothing more complicated.
Don't panic.

219
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,071
I'm just not used to all this
dating bullshit, you know?

220
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,556
Now we're a couple, I'm obliged
to give a shit what you say.

221
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,955
Don't worry.
I'm not into those games.

222
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,436
So, anyway.
The monkey turns into Perry Como.

223
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,357
Holy fuck.

224
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,950
- What?
- Holy, holy fuck.

225
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,877
You just gave me an idea.

226
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,878
- For a show. Fuck!
- A show about monkeys?

227
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,150
No, about people.

228
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,636
About sex, about romance.
About the bullshit of dating.

229
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,435
I call it <i>The Dating Game.</i>

230
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,996
And that's what it's about,
Mr Goldberg.

231
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,953
A pretty girl
asks three handsome guys

232
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,116
who she can't see
silly questions.

233
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,631
And based on her answers,
she picks one to date.

234
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,672
And we pay for the date.
That's it. That's the show.

235
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,753
Hot damn!

236
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,313
- What?
- They bought it!

237
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,317
They bought it! They bought it!

238
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,750
They gave me 7500 fuckin' dollars
to do the pilot!

239
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,518
Let's go roller skating!

240
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,993
I can't. I got a date!

241
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,190
- OK, cool. Will you call me after?
- OK.

242
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,673
OK. Bye.

243
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,913
<i>I figured I was in.</i>

244
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,918
<i>All I had to do</i>
<i>was get the pilot made</i>

245
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,553
<i>and I'd be a millionaire.</i>

246
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,153
<i>Everyone would love me.</i>

247
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,312
<i>Was anyone ever so young?</i>

248
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,793
- No.
- No.

249
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,273
- No.
- No.

250
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,753
No.

251
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,233
Alright. Lose it.

252
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,749
<i>ABC didn't like "The Dating Game".</i>

253
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,269
<i>They did like a show</i>
<i>called "Hootenanny".</i>

254
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,833
Whoa, I like this one.

255
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,554
Well, he led an amazingly long life.

256
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,796
<i>"Hooten-fuckin'-nanny".</i>

257
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,153
What do they know?

258
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,271
That's long for a dog.

259
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,750
I don't know.
About 70 for you and me.

260
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,115
It's nine years to every one of ours.

261
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,353
Yeah.

262
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,752
I'm sorry about your show.

263
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,073
What?

264
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,713
How long has it been dead?

265
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,312
Jesus, Phoebe, that's...

266
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,793
Yeah. No, I'll hold on.

267
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,717
- Is that your mum?
- My sister.

268
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,193
Come here.

269
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,673
Here we go.

270
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,552
- I got you these.
- I'm not...

271
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,513
I wanna tell you something.
I talked to a psychic.

272
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,153
- A what?
- A psychic.

273
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,158
And she said you are gonna be
very successful.

274
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,508
Really. Yeah.

275
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,993
Very successful.

276
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,792
- Tarot cards?
- Tea leaves.

277
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,595
Say that again, Phoebe. I missed it.

278
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,158
Tuvia?
No, why would I have seen her?

279
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,233
She... She did?

280
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,233
Who's Tuvia?

281
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,713
To Manhattan?

282
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,193
Who's Tuvia?

283
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,593
Yeah.

284
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,833
Your niece.

285
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,313
Divorced? Really?

286
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,437
I didn't know she got married.

287
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,513
Yes?

288
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,477
Hi. Tuvia.

289
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,235
Well, if it isn't
Strawberry Dick Barris.

290
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,713
What do you want?

291
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,832
I'm back in town for a while
and I thought maybe...

292
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,916
Jesus, you've gotta be kidding.

293
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,392
He's so convincing when he talks.
He'll convince you of anything.

294
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,513
He's one of the very few guys
I'd like to have on my side

295
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,993
in a street fight.

296
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,749
You're a pretty angry young fella.

297
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,871
Can't fight worth a damn, though.

298
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,558
Screw off, queer.

299
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,478
I seen you watching me
in that bar for a week now.

300
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,354
Bit of a loner, I'd say.
Fairly bright, tad anti-social.

301
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,879
Mad at the world.

302
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,558
Can I buy you lunch?

303
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,153
There's a schoolyard up there.
Why don't you go trawling there?

304
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,275
I can teach you
at least 30 different ways

305
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,755
to kill a man
with a single blow, Mr Barris.

306
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,952
It might help in future bar fights.
Just a thought.

307
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,309
And there's money in it.
Good money.

308
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,355
You know,
I figure if I can keep afloat

309
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,948
until I come up
with the next game show idea

310
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,957
then... all will be copacetic.

311
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,672
That sounds great, Chuck.

312
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,316
I've never known a television
producer before. I'm impressed.

313
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,149
Yeah. What's the money deal
you were talking about?

314
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,350
I work for a governmnent agency.

315
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,516
Always looking for enthusiastic men

316
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,835
to help us carry out our directives.

317
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,439
What kind of work?
What government agency?

318
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,033
Problem-solving work.

319
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,155
The Office of Diplomatic Security.

320
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,633
So what?

321
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,435
I've never heard of it. Is that
the fucking CIA or something?

322
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,356
Please be discreet, Mr Barris.

323
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,272
Jesus.

324
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,550
It is the fucking CIA?

325
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,473
Yeah, I'll be a spy.

326
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,873
Where do I sign up?

327
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,513
You're fucking with me.

328
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,993
Hardly.

329
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,588
You wouldn't be
working for the company.

330
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,150
You'd be an independent
contract agent. Independent.

331
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,077
No official tie to any agency.

332
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,233
Understand?

333
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,513
Why me?

334
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,475
As you know, I've been watching you.

335
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,479
For quite some time, actually. I've
only let you know in the last week.

336
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,956
I'm happy to report
you fit our profile, Mr Barris.

337
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,271
Are you interested in the work?

338
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,392
Well, what's the profile?

339
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,397
Are you interested in the work,

340
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,873
Mr Barris?

341
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,875
Yeah, sure,
I wanna be a secret agent.

342
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,709
A contract agent, whatever.
Get to fuck Eastern European women.

343
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,990
What we do is very serious,
Mr Barris.

344
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,112
It's essential
in quelling the rise of Communism,

345
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,392
allowing democracy to get its
rightful foothold around the globe.

346
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,873
You understand?

347
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,393
Yeah. Sure.

348
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,393
Yeah.

349
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,158
Yeah. OK. That's good.

350
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,870
There are several efficient methods
for killing a man

351
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,639
were you to find yourself
without a weapon.

352
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,514
The edge of your hand against
your adversary's Adam's apple.

353
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,428
This will crush his windpipe,
causing strangulation.

354
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,953
And death.

355
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,713
Shit.

356
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,352
I need another volunteer.

357
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,954
- They're training me to be a killer.
- I knew you were bright.

358
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,470
Look, I'm not killing people.
My future's in television.

359
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,398
You're 32 years old
and you've achieved nothing.

360
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,149
Jesus was dead and alive again
by 33. You better get cracking.

361
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,713
I have ideas for shows.

362
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,594
Good. Why don't you spend
another six months developing them

363
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,030
while you stare out the window
waiting for Goldberg to call?

364
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,391
- What do you know about it?
- I know everything about you.

365
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,353
I know which hand
you jerk off with. Left.

366
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,831
Leave in the morning, if you want.

367
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,758
I'm here to tell you
this is honest work. Good pay.

368
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,555
You're making the world safer.
The country'll be grateful.

369
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,273
It'll toughen you up.

370
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,513
But wait a second.

371
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,556
We've gotta talk about this.

372
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,516
<i>And there it was.</i>
<i>My defining moment.</i>

373
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,159
<i>I wasn't just gonna work for the CIA.</i>

374
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,157
<i>I was gonna kill for them.</i>

375
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,432
<i>Call it patriotism.</i>

376
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,110
Glycerine is, of course,
the best known nitrating agent.

377
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:46,112
Keep in mind, though, that
nitroglycerine is extremely unstable.

378
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,553
A slight tap.

379
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,390
A one-degree change in temperature...

380
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,476
and it will blow up in your hands.

381
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,993
So let's mix us up a batch.

382
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,759
Everybody take
your 75 millilitre beaker.

383
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,352
And fill it up to the 13ml level
with red hot fuming nitric acid.

384
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,833
98% concentration.

385
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,153
The field phone.

386
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,432
Used as an instrument
of interrogation. Or torture.

387
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,193
Attaching firmly to the genitalia.

388
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,313
Ivan.

389
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,513
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist party?

390
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,349
What's your aunt Tilly's recipe
for vodka cookies?

391
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,273
Alright, Jack.

392
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,433
Take care, Lee.

393
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,150
I know a lot about him you
are not gonna know. I can't tell you.

394
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,957
Yeah. I know some things about him
that are very distressing.

395
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,199
And you wouldn't wanna know them
about him.

396
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,235
So what did this guy
really do anyway?

397
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,511
Your job is to follow directives,
not question them.

398
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,955
- <i>Por favor. Señor?</i>
- <i>No hablo inglés.</i>

399
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,992
<i>Ra-ba-bla los loteros?</i>

400
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,956
<i>Ra-bla-bla menjares?</i>

401
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,672
- Eduardo, help me, please.
- <i>Señor, no hablo inglés.</i>

402
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,360
- No, no, no.
- Can I be of some assistance?

403
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,552
He's a bad guy.
He's one of the bad guys.

404
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,432
Bad for the US, right, Jim?

405
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,154
Not in the absolute sense,
just bad for the US.

406
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,955
Don't dance with me. He's bad
for the Tea and Biscuit Company.

407
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,914
He's bad for me personally.
You work for me. Renda's bad for me.

408
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,874
<i>You're now a patriotic citizen</i>
<i>of the United States of Jim Byrd.</i>

409
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,072
You can't back out now.
We've let you in on everything.

410
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,760
You don't play, you don't leave.
Understand?

411
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,950
You don't play, you don't leave.

412
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,476
<i>I like you. I do.</i>
<i>You're gonna do fine tomorrow</i>

413
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,875
<i>and we're gonna</i>
<i>become good friends.</i>

414
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,352
You're gonna have a nice career
but grow up. There's a war on.

415
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,797
<i>Beautiful country, isn't it?</i>

416
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,273
Yeah.

417
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,156
You did us proud today, Chuck.

418
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,072
Renda was a bad guy.

419
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,758
He really was.

420
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,555
- Chuck, is that you?
- Jesus Christ, Pen!

421
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,352
You scared the shit out of me.

422
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,711
- What are you doing here?
- I've been crashing here.

423
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,877
- Where have you been?
- Mexico, on a little vacation.

424
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,718
Did you drink the water?

425
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,193
Yeah.

426
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,072
That's Montessori's Revenge.

427
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,553
Montezuma's.

428
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,309
You can't open your eyes or mouth
when you take a shower there.

429
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,159
Why is our water so good
and theirs is poison?

430
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,158
- It's the same ocean.
- I don't know.

431
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,352
I'm a hippy now.

432
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,958
I've been to San Francisco.
It's amazing there.

433
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,150
Everybody loves everybody.

434
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,955
There are so many colours.
We're gonna change the world.

435
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,958
Will you come back there
and be my old man with me?

436
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,472
Well, not that old.

437
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,195
- Penny, I'm a little tired...
- Wait! I gotta play you this song!

438
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,272
Penny?

439
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,630
Penny, what did you do to my wall?

440
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,194
Some guy called. Goldbird.

441
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,673
Goldberg.

442
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,870
Larry Goldberg?
You're kidding me!

443
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,674
Hi, this is Chuck Barris
returning for Larry Goldberg.

444
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,392
- Hi, Chuck.
- Mr Goldberg.

445
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,159
I'm so sorry
I didn't get back to you right away.

446
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,236
I was on vacation in Mexico.

447
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,352
Good for you. Listen.
I'm just going through things

448
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,755
and I have a hole
in my daytime schedule.

449
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,791
It might be right for your baby.

450
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,558
My... My baby, Mr Goldberg?

451
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,274
Chuck, <i>The Dating Game.</i>
Isn't that your baby?

452
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,994
- Yes, sir. It is.
- Are you still interested?

453
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,519
Yes. Very interested.

454
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,235
I've got six weeks to get it on.
Is that do-able for your people?

455
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,271
My people? Six weeks?

456
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,958
Sure. Yeah.

457
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,548
Give me a call
when you get to LA, Chuck.

458
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,633
Goddamn!

459
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,113
Hot dog!

460
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,470
Shit! Yes!

461
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,352
Who's Larry Goldberg?

462
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,949
Bachelor number one.
What would I like most about you?

463
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,631
I'm very romantic
and I'd send you flowers every day.

464
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,512
That's so sweet.

465
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,950
Bachelor number three,
what would I like most about you?

466
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,758
My big cock.

467
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,956
Bachelor number one.
What nationality are you?

468
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,276
My daddy is Welsh,
my mama's Hungarian,

469
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,870
so I guess that makes me Well-Hung.

470
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,756
Bachelor number... two.

471
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,677
I play the trombone.

472
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,553
If I blew you,
what would you sound like?

473
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,751
What would I sound like?

474
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,153
Alright...

475
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,632
<i>That's nice, don't stop...</i>

476
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,518
<i>Blow it, baby.</i>

477
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,835
Chuck, quite frankly,
these episodes are unairable.

478
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,351
Look, Larry. The show's spontaneous.
It's unscripted. That's its charm.

479
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,677
- I can't help what people say.
- Be that as it may, Mr Barris.

480
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,554
We can't have black men getting
blow jobs on national television.

481
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,193
It's not that he's black.

482
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,550
- I know that, Larry.
- Chuck, that's it.

483
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,559
We can't air this stuff. If you
can't retain spontaneity on the show

484
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,990
without lewd conduct,
it's finished, you're history.

485
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,509
Fix this fucking thing
or we've got a problem.

486
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,428
Hi, folks.
Before we begin taping today,

487
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,154
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr Peter Janks

488
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,955
from the Federal Communications
Commission. OK?

489
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,038
Thank you, Mr Barris.

490
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,755
I don't know if any of you...
are aware of this.

491
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,551
But it's a federal offence
to make lascivious remarks

492
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,035
on a television network broadcast.

493
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,756
The penalty...

494
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,550
...for this disgusting...

495
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,956
...un-American... behaviour

496
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,351
is one year in prison...
or a $10,000 fine.

497
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,152
Or both!

498
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,552
Anyone making a sick,
subversive remark tonight

499
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,311
will be arrested immediately.

500
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,352
I will personally escort
the offender to prison

501
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,278
for booking under edict number 364

502
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,472
of the Broadcasting Act of 1963.

503
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,354
And it's a long drive
to that prison, baby.

504
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,157
Just you and me.

505
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,952
No witnesses.

506
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,519
OK. Have fun, everybody.
Alright.

507
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,997
He gave everybody jackets
with their names on.

508
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:31,035
When we got number-one ratings,
everybody got a gold plaque.

509
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,357
He was a good boss
and obviously had the common touch

510
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,552
because he really knew
what people wanted to watch.

511
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,269
<i>We aired and became a big hit.</i>

512
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,153
- A</i> <i>phenomenon, really.</i>
- Hey, baby.

513
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,869
- I got a story to tell you.
- Asshole.

514
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,788
I know, I know.
I got a little story for you.

515
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,151
I'm busy. We're in the middle
of a bachelorette crisis.

516
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,829
Sit down, relax. Take a load off.
Make yourself at home.

517
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,679
- The network just called. Drink?
- Got any weed?

518
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,349
- I wish. No, no weed.
- Then I'll have a drink.

519
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,959
Bad news?

520
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,038
<i>The Tammy Grimes Show</i>
got pulled from Saturday night.

521
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,355
Not Tammy!

522
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,355
They want a primetime version
of <i>The Dating Game</i> in its place.

523
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,953
That's fucking great.

524
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,073
But the daytime version's not hot
enough. They want more excitement.

525
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,952
I've got 48 hours.

526
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,152
What have you got?

527
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,595
I don't have a clue.
I've got nothing.

528
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,678
This is a big deal.
This could be my big break.

529
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,358
I know.

530
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,553
- Don't blow it.
- Thanks for the help.

531
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,189
- Let me ask you something, Chuck.
- Jesus.

532
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,515
What the... What are you doing here?

533
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,552
I've been put in charge
of a fairly large operation

534
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,750
and I could use your help.

535
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,875
I've got a TV show on the air.
I don't need to kill people for hire.

536
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,673
You may not need to,
but you'd like to.

537
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,155
- Bullshit.
- Think of it as a hobby.

538
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,077
Something you do to relax.

539
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,875
You can be an assassination
enthusiast. A murder bug.

540
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,638
I got more important things.

541
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,070
- I've no time to fuck around.
- This is serious work, Chuck.

542
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,758
Serious work.

543
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,553
Now how about
I help you with your little show

544
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,956
and you help me. Tit for tat.
That's the kind of guy I am.

545
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,036
Yeah. You're a piece of work.

546
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,720
I've seen this <i>Dating Game.</i>
I have a thought.

547
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,711
Now you're a big TV producer?

548
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,035
I'm John Q Public
when it comes to TV.

549
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,799
That should make my opinion
of value to you.

550
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,751
Alright, let's hear it.

551
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,472
Alright.

552
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,875
What do you have?
Some couple gets sent to

553
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,549
some second-rate shit-can
restaurant, set you back 50 bucks?

554
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,468
Not too exciting a prize for us
vicarious-living boobs in TV land.

555
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,955
- What's your point?
- Up the stakes, Chuck.

556
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,640
Send them to some exotic locale
in Europe.

557
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,751
Southeast Asia, for example.

558
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,676
The network won't let me send
unmarried kids on vacation.

559
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,756
Send a chaperone.

560
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,033
It's...

561
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,753
That's not half bad.

562
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,350
I'm telling you. Sometimes
you could be the chaperone.

563
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,153
Say we have a job for you in Austria.

564
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,159
You, successful television producer,
chaperones a young couple.

565
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,953
While there, you take on
some company business.

566
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,358
It's a perfect cover. TV producer
by day, CIA operative at night.

567
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,995
I got money, Jim. I don't have to
kill people for money any more.

568
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,270
Chuck, when I said
you fit the profile,

569
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,994
very little of that
meant you needed the money.

570
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,839
You liked it with Renda.
I saw it in your eyes.

571
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,155
You liked it but you botched it.

572
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,710
You could be a great warrior, Chuck.

573
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,478
<i>Bachelor number three.</i>

574
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,273
<i>If we were fixed up on a date,</i>
<i>and I ignored you...</i>

575
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,550
This guy's never been on a date.

576
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,872
Ready four? Take four.

577
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,357
<i>I'm not used to being ignored.</i>
<i>I'd give you your space.</i>

578
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,552
The only date this guy has had
is with his right hand.

579
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,956
Ready one? Take one.

580
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,712
Bachelor number three.
What if I pick you and?

581
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,479
- She's going for the three!
- <i>What would you do?</i>

582
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,874
Ready four? Take four.

<i>The only way that you could be ugly</i>
<i>is by what you say or do.</i>

<i>you're beautiful.</i>

585
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,275
Bachelor number three.
Can you tell me what a girl is like

586
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,075
who has never been on a date before
and how you can tell?

587
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,156
Well...

588
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,748
I'll ask her what she likes to do.

589
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,758
And if she doesn't know
what she likes to do,

590
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,678
then I'll know
she hasn't done it yet.

591
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,752
Why don't you talk to her?
You can do that.

592
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,558
She's real shy.

593
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,875
You have to tell her.
That's your job.

594
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,753
Tell her
that I think she's real pretty

595
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,757
and I wanna be her boyfriend.

596
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,517
I'm shy, too.
You gotta tell her that, Chuck.

597
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,553
I used to skate. I told her that.
She didn't even look at me.

598
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,955
Talk to her, Chuck. It's your job.

599
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,152
She picked me.
She didn't pick those other guys.

600
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,555
You're the chaperone, Chuck.

601
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,551
She called me gay. I'm not gay.

602
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,355
You gotta tell her that.
You're not doing your job very well.

603
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,358
I know it takes time
to get to know each other

604
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,436
but this is ridiculous.

605
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,757
They thought he was...

606
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,351
They sort of walked a straight line.
They'd talk about him.

607
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,359
"This guy, he can turn on you."
And I never saw that side.

608
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,278
A lot of the crew thought
he could turn on them.

609
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,152
Chuck?

610
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,790
<i>Helsinki is wonderful</i>

00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,549
<i>It affords one solitude,</i>
<i>even in a city full of people.</i>

613
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,075
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

614
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,352
By you.

615
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,756
Helsinki is wonderful
this time of year, isn't it?

616
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,757
Yes, it is.

617
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,158
I'm sorry.

618
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,958
Excuse me.

619
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,758
Helsinki is wonderful

620
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,357
Especially the snow.

00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,472
It affords one solitude,

00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,192
I'm Chuck.

00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,158
So I gathered.

624
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,952
You are?

625
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,953
Here you are, Chuck.

626
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,950
At least give me a made-up name,

627
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,676
something for me to cry out
during those dark nights of the soul.

628
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,397
Cry out Olivia.

629
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,756
That's <i>Twelfth Night.</i>

630
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,038
Very good, Chuck.

631
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,352
Pleasantly surprised.

632
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,238
You're not like the other murderers.

633
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,558
You have it?

634
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,750
- Yeah, I have it.
- You have it?

635
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,552
Sorry.

636
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,552
- We're not gonna cheat you.
- Just the same.

637
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,232
Sorry about your teeth.

638
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,152
Chuck?

639
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,278
Chuck?

640
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,352
Olivia?

641
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,352
It's Patricia, actually.

642
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,753
So I spent a year in Operation Chaos,
inside the anti-war movement,

643
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,952
nudging it towards violence
to discredit it.

644
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,550
- That was fun.
- It sounds fun.

645
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,475
Tell me, Patricia.
Why did you come up here tonight?

646
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,352
I don't know.

647
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,551
You're kinda cute,
in a homely sort of way.

648
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,360
It's lonely
when the civilian you're fucking

649
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,074
calls out the name
on your fake passport.

650
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,591
All the information I have about
myself is from forged documents.

651
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,557
Nabokov.

652
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,754
Wait. I gotta go to the bathroom
and take care of something.

653
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,750
Leave the microfilm in, baby.

654
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,952
Do you know when
my episode's gonna air? OK.

655
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,355
Well, see you, Chuck. Bye.

656
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,152
This is Simon Oliver. Everything
go OK? You don't look too good.

657
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,477
Mr Barris. Do not ever
again jeopardise one of my missions

658
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,354
by having a game-show contestant
becoming a witness. Understood?

659
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,471
Do I make myself clear?

660
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,354
- Fuck you. They're my contestants.
- You are a bloody amateur.

661
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,357
- You're a faggot.
- Chuck...

662
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,756
Tell me, Mr Barris. Are you
in possession of my microfilm?

663
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,233
- I got it.
- Let me have it.

664
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,954
It's up my ass. Why don't you
reach up and get it?

665
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,752
What is this shit?

666
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,555
I just feel I deserve a little
appreciation for my efforts, Jim.

667
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,148
What do you think
Patricia Watson was?

668
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,158
Prick.

669
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,150
Well, if it isn't the hitman.

670
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,759
What?

671
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,359
The hitman.

672
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,075
- Surprise!
- What's going on?

673
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,749
ABC's picking up <i>The Newly-Wed</i>
<i>Game,</i> daytime and primetime!

674
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,872
My God! That's sensational!

675
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,558
Fantastic!

676
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,554
<i>Here's our last five-point question.</i>
<i>Where, specifically,</i>

677
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,750
<i>is the weirdest place</i>

678
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,632
<i>that you personally, girls,</i>

679
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,354
<i>have ever gotten the urge</i>
<i>to make whoopee?</i>

680
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,555
<i>The weirdest place. Olga?</i>

681
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,557
<i>Yes, Olga?</i>

682
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,153
<i>In the ass?</i>

683
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,594
<i>No, no, no.</i>

684
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,153
<i>I'm not talking about...</i>
<i>The weirdest location, the place.</i>

685
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,953
<i>The weirdest location? I don't know.</i>

686
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,312
<i>The weirdest location.</i>
<i>Place. You know what I mean?</i>

687
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,151
<i>I liked Penny.</i>
<i>I even loved her in my way.</i>

688
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,959
<i>But the idea of tying myself down</i>
<i>for the rest of my life...</i>

689
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,949
<i>I remember my parents' marriage.</i>

690
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,950
We need a new ice box.

691
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,473
<i>"The Newly-Wed Game"</i>
<i>was based on my theory</i>

692
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,752
<i>that almost any American would sell</i>
<i>out their spouse for a washer dryer</i>

693
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,030
<i>or a lawnmower you could ride on.</i>

694
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,994
<i>Such was my respect</i>
<i>for that most holy of unions.</i>

695
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,591
- Interpet.
- Inter-pret.

696
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,472
- Do you have an extra R?
- I can't give you a letter.

697
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,875
I should make you forfeit a turn.

698
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,470
- OK.
- You look cute today, Pen.

699
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,353
I always look cute.
Don't distract me.

700
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,155
- What was I gonna say?
- I don't know.

701
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,713
What were you gonna say?

702
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,956
I think we should get married.

703
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,749
Cos we've known each other forever.
And we've fucked each other forever.

704
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,952
And you think I'm cute,
you just said.

705
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,548
You always come to me
when you're in trouble

706
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,591
and I'm nothing like your mother.

707
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,597
What does that mean? What is that?

708
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,757
I'm just kidding.

709
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,030
Don't ask me to marry you again, OK?

710
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,113
<i>I couldn't breathe.</i>

711
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,958
<i>I was drowning.</i>

712
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,910
<i>And what the fuck</i>
<i>did my mother have to do with it?</i>

713
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,598
<i>So I made a call.</i>

714
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,956
Over here, Strawberry Dick.

715
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,354
- How do you know those things?
- We even know how it tasted to her.

716
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,550
Really? What did she think?

717
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,353
That's on a need to know basis,
my friend.

718
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,950
- What can I do for you?
- I really need something, Jim.

719
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,150
I need something for my head.

720
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,956
I got something for your head.

721
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,836
<i>And you're going on your date</i>
<i>to fabulous...</i>

722
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,155
<i>West Berlin, Germany!</i>

723
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,355
Name's Hans Colbert,
other side of the wall.

724
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,792
We don't like him very much.

725
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,950
You'll work with
a kraut named Keeler.

726
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,753
He's been tailing Colbert.
Knows the routine.

727
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,190
Keeler's a drunk,
so stay sober and take charge.

728
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,038
Done and done.

729
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,991
Kill for me, baby.

730
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,158
Sorry.

731
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,357
What are you writing?

732
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,558
Just keeping track of anything that
happens in the Clara-Zetkin-Straße.

733
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,555
That's him.

734
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,752
Too many people.

735
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,877
Chuck.

736
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,353
- Chuck.
- Alright.

737
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,277
- Take the camera.
- Alright.

738
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,753
What is this?

739
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,915
What the?

740
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,277
- Take a picture.
- Take a what?

741
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,515
Take a picture.

742
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,556
Take a picture. Come on.

743
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,718
Take a picture.

744
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,753
<i>Danke schön.</i>

745
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,676
He would disappear
for a week or so at a time.

746
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,554
His secretary would say, "He's
out of town. We don't know where."

747
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,559
I don't know whether
it's true or not. I couldn't say.

748
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,475
<i>The only reason the KGB</i>

<i>That I was duped</i>

762
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,076
Are you still in one piece?

763
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,555
- Where the fuck you been?
- Nice flight?

764
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,150
Fuck you. Where you been?
I got one contact, Jim, and it's you.

765
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,271
If you disappear, I got no one.

766
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,956
- She's good, huh?
- She's very good, very good.

767
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,594
- That's great.
- That's fine. Thank you.

768
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,156
- Can't I sing the whole song?
- That was wonderful. Great.

769
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,032
That was enough. That was fine.

770
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,513
That was great. Thanks.

771
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,993
Alright. Next thing.

772
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:58,352
Christ. There has to be somebody
in America with talent... Hi.

773
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,159
Now, I saw her in a little club.
I swear you're gonna love her.

774
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:52,355
- Alright, thank you. Wonderful.
- That's great! Fantastic.

775
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,511
Great. We'll be in touch.

776
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,993
Thank you. Thank you.

777
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,999
We're going about this all wrong.
We're trying to find good acts.

778
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,156
We just put bad ones
and kill them.

779
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,555
Chuck, honestly, this is torture.

780
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,830
We kill 'em before they're through.

781
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,754
As soon as it gets unbearable,
we kill 'em. Dead.

782
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:20,473
Ladies and gentlemen, this guy...
This is so good. I love this man.

783
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,559
This next act
answers the age-old question.

784
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,352
If you wear a Cellophane...

785
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,358
If you... OK.

786
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,758
If you wear... a Cellophane suit,

787
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,077
can people clearly see you're nuts?

788
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,475
I don't know. A little humour, folks.

789
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,319
All the way from Pacoima,

790
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,112
Mick... Donnelly!

791
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,958
I should have known
there were so many Americans

792
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,514
<i>just waiting for the opportunity</i>
<i>to get on TV</i>

793
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,551
<i>and make an ass of themselves?</i>

794
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:46,310
We'll be back with more... stuff
right after this message.

795
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,919
You know what the sad part is?

796
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,117
Barris has a reputation
for lowering the bar of television

797
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,196
and the standards and all but...

798
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,151
He knew what people wanted.

799
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,510
And he couldn't take the criticism.

800
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,600
<i>Things started to evolve</i>
<i>pretty quickly.</i>

801
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,197
<i>The show was gaining momentum.</i>

802
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,799
<i>I was becoming the one thing</i>
<i>I didn't expect.</i>

803
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,233
<i>Famous.</i>

804
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,715
Hey! You're Chuck Barris.
<i>The Gong Show.</i>

805
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,149
- I love that show.
- Thanks.

806
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,149
Hi.

807
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,032
- Hi.
- I thought that was you.

808
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,513
Yeah.

809
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,513
It's me.

810
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,991
Well, I'm glad to meet you.
I've seen <i>The Gong Show.</i>

811
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,954
You're the most despicable force
in entertainment today.

812
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,511
How dare you subject the world

813
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,108
to your loathsome views of humanity?

814
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,958
I don't think it's that...

815
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,755
What is it, then?
To mock some poor, lonely people

816
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:54,158
who are just craving
a little attention? To destroy them?

817
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,157
They're still people.

818
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,511
They still deserve
a little respect and compassion.

819
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,833
Who the hell are you?
What the fuck have you done

820
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,952
to elevate yourself
above the pathetic masses?

821
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,353
That's right. You created
<i>The Dating Game.</i> Wow...

822
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,398
That's right up there
with the Sistine Chapel.

823
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,474
It wouldn't surprise me
to see this next act...

824
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,151
That means... it's Gene!

825
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,999
Gene... The Dancing Machine!

826
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:02,755
<i>This represents more than</i>
<i>the decline of quality television.</i>

827
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,236
<i>In my opinion, Chuck Barris</i>
<i>will do more harm to our society</i>

828
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,918
<i>than people seem to realise.</i>

829
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,632
Line One's for you, Chuck.

830
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,113
Who is it?

831
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,198
A guy. He says
he's a friend of yours from Berlin.

832
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,793
Hello.

833
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,876
<i>Ja. Wie geht's dir, mein Lieber?</i>

834
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,468
I guess you heard about Oliver.

835
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,033
Someone changed sides.

836
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,552
What was so urgent?

837
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:47,035
I was wondering. You wanna grab
a bite? I'm in town for a day.

838
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,276
<i>Now, assassins don't fraternise.</i>

839
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:53,234
<i>If Keeler was calling me, it could</i>
<i>mean it was my turn to get hit.</i>

840
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,830
<i>I would take him somewhere</i>
<i>where I knew I would be safe.</i>

841
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,552
- How's showbiz?
- Well, it's hit and miss.

842
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,672
I got a new show called
<i>Operation Entertainment</i>

843
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,075
which I believe is really gonna kill.

844
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,431
It's sort of
a Bob Hope-visiting-the-troops thing.

845
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,028
Instead of Bob Hope,
it's Flip Wilson.

846
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,513
Chuck...

847
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,392
Why do you do what you do?

848
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,470
Well, I like to think
that I bring joy and laughter

849
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,912
to millions of people. That's very
important in these difficult times.

850
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,992
I'm not saying the show
is as good as it can be, yet.

851
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,953
No, no, no.

852
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,311
Why do we do what we do?

853
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,871
Hmm? Come on.

854
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,393
I got my feet wet in World War II.

855
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,313
Germany.

856
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:52,875
The pleasure of killing...
was exhilarating.

857
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:59,074
Later in life, I couldn't
find a place to fill that void.

858
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,873
To get that same rush of energy.
So I started up my own business.

859
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,150
Gentlemen. Are you ready to order?

860
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,277
A green salad. No dressing.

861
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,753
And for you, sir?

862
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,189
I'll get a steak. Rare.

863
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,673
Thank you.

864
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,950
Let me read you something.

865
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,757
Whatsoever your hand finds to do,
do it gladly,

866
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,352
because there is no work, love,
knowledge or wisdom in the grave.

867
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,276
Who was that? Carlyle?

868
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,995
No, it's the Old Testament.

869
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,278
It's God.

870
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,996
It's amazing you should quote him.

871
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,758
He's my hero.

872
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,756
Killing my first... man...

873
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,558
...was like making love
to my first woman.

874
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,151
I remember... every little detail.

875
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,751
<i>The smell of his hair.</i>

876
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,235
<i>The ice on the window.</i>

877
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,191
<i>Wallpaper.</i>

878
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,110
It's like entering
a different time zone.

879
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,751
<i>You become an outsider,</i>
<i>isolating yourself.</i>

880
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,757
<i>You've been condemned.</i>

881
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,513
<i>Condemned?</i>

882
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,111
<i>You have become... their sadness.</i>

883
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,799
<i>And... live</i>
<i>in a different state of mind.</i>

884
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:44,957
Ladies and gentlemen.
The host of <i>The Gong Show.</i>

885
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,951
- Chuck Barris.
- It's good to see you, Sig.

886
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,230
Yeah. It'll be alright.

887
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,233
It'll be alright.

888
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,717
I think.

889
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,393
Was that right?

890
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,750
Yeah. It was real good.

891
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,038
It was real good.

892
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,230
So what's wrong, Chuck?

893
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,431
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm OK.

894
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,671
It's just a guy I know
killed himself last night.

895
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,555
A guy I know killed himself.

896
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,713
Who was he?

897
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,832
You don't know him.
He's a... stage hand.

898
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,156
Why did he do it?

899
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:07,352
He didn't like his work any more.
Thanks.

900
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,948
Is being a stage hand
really, really bad?

901
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,433
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

902
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,313
Hello?

903
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,000
We were supposed to meet
at The Palm two hours ago.

904
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,395
- Fuck. I forgot.
- You forgot. Really?

905
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,988
- Keeler's dead.
- Yeah, I heard, I heard.

906
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,714
- What did you hear?
- I heard he took himself out.

907
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,230
- Did Byrd tell you that?
- Yeah, he said he was depressed.

908
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,157
- Hey! Alright!
- Who is this?

909
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,952
I don't get stood up. Get it?

910
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,150
Fine. Excuse me.

911
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,911
So glad... Penny, Patricia.
How did you find me?

912
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,032
Are you serious?
This is what I do for a living.

913
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,072
- What does she mean?
- You're dead, Strawberry Dick.

914
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,156
Strawberry Dick? What's that?

915
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,159
See you around. Nice to meet you,
Penny. I've heard a lot about you.

916
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,633
Why don't you stay for a... cocktail?

917
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,751
- Penny?
- And...

918
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,231
You know. Man...

919
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,352
I am giving you one more chance,
get it?

920
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,915
<i>Angel...</i>

921
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,559
Thank you.

922
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,958
<i>Line One for you, Chuck.</i>

923
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,633
Thanks.

924
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,035
- Yeah?
- <i>Keeler didn't kill himself.</i>

925
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,549
<i>He was murdered. Watch your back.</i>

926
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,355
You can come in now, Mr Flexner.

927
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,959
Chuck.

928
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,553
- Great to see ya.
- What's up, Rod?

929
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,239
Well... Chuck. May I sit?

930
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,351
How's that redhead?

931
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,156
Good. You know. Keeps...

932
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,158
Well, Chuck.
The thing is, we have to talk.

933
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,759
What's up, Ron?

934
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,235
Well, the thing is...

935
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,553
Some of your old shows aren't doing
so well in the old ratings war.

936
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:44,159
So,, I've been put
in the unfortunate position

937
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:49,354
of having to inform you that the
network is cancelling these shows.

938
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,356
Now don't shoot me, Chuck.

939
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,356
I'm just the messenger.

940
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,751
This really is
the hardest part of the job for me.

941
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,358
They killed my babies, Tino.
Just like that.

942
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,758
I pushed them into the world through
the birth canal of my imagination.

943
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,960
Lovingly. Tenderly.

944
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,355
Where's the humanity
of these people?

945
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,473
- Huh?
- Fuck 'em.

946
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,953
Fuck 'em.

947
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,196
They're fucking bastards anyway.

948
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,552
Yeah, what am I gonna do now?

949
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,273
Baby...

950
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,473
Yeah.

951
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,673
It's so good.

952
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,793
Chuck?

953
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,360
- Chuck?
- Fuck! Fuck!

954
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,357
Penny. Fuck.

955
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,873
I came here to tell you
I sold the painting.

956
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,672
That's great.

957
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,358
- What's she doing here?
- She's...

958
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,152
This is our house.

959
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,549
It's one thing to go elsewhere
for your pussy needs.

960
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,353
But... this is our house.

961
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,552
- It's my house, Pen.
- It's our house.

962
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,758
I found it with you,
I decorated it with you.

963
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,871
I spent six fucking months

964
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,151
waiting for the fucking plumber
to fucking come.

965
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,556
You're such an asshole.

966
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,555
No, I'm not saying that.

967
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:09,559
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Then what are you saying, Chuck?

968
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,150
Do you want me around or not?

969
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,156
Do you even like me?

970
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,670
Of course I like you. Penny...

971
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,075
- How much?
- What?

972
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,555
I need to know how much you like me.

973
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,156
I don't know what that means.

974
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:31,556
How much? How can I
rate a person in that way?

975
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,875
You could if you felt it.

976
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,788
If you felt it, it would be easy.
You would just...

977
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,357
...spread your arms

978
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:45,359
as wide as they would go
and say, "This much, Penny."

979
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,352
Everything...

980
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,630
Everything's complicated, Pen.

981
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:02,118
You know,
nothing's black and white like that.

982
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,150
Do you want me around or not?

983
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,874
Cos if you don't, it's OK.
Just tell me.

984
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,756
I love you, Penny.

985
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,552
In my way.

986
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,354
Maybe not in that crazy,
head-over-heels thing

987
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,869
but what is that anyway?

988
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,752
Romantic love?

989
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,756
Isn't that just an illusion?

990
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,160
You just said you loved me, right?

991
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,558
- Hiya, Chuck.
- Jim. What do you want?

992
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:34,150
How's work?
Any new gameshow ideas?

993
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,511
Dozens. Why are you here, Jim?

994
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,353
We need you to find the mole
and take him out.

995
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,953
Yeah.

996
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:53,556
I'm done killing people.
I just want to entertain people.

997
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,549
No.

998
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,158
It ain't that.

999
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,756
Yeah, I got an idea.

1000
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,078
If you want him so bad,
why don't you do it?

1001
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:13,352
Why don't you kill the mole?
You got a problem with killing, Jim?

1002
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,040
I just don't fit the profile.

1003
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,754
What profile?
There is no fucking profile.

1004
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:22,440
- OK. There's no profile.
- There's no profile.

1005
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:23,959
OK.

1006
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,471
You had a twin sister, stillborn,
strangled by your umbilical cord.

1007
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,352
Your first hit.

1008
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,155
Your mother wanted a daughter.
She blamed you for her death

1009
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:41,159
so until your sister Phoebe was
born, she raised you as a girl.

1010
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,679
What else?

1011
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,155
Your father, the dentist.

1012
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,757
Not really your father.

1013
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,758
Your real father was a man
named Edmond James Windsor.

1014
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,668
Among other things, he was a serial
killer. Your mother didn't know

1015
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,950
when she had an affair with him
in 1928.

1016
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,150
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

1017
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,077
That's insane.

1018
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,158
Windsor died
in the electric chair in 1939.

1019
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,954
I'm trying to think of
what more I can tell you

1020
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:14,039
but you have me at a disadvantage.
I don't have your files with me.

1021
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,958
I'm out, Jim.

1022
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,152
I'm out.

1023
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,918
As long as the mole's alive,
you're a dead man.

1024
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,313
How do I know it's not you?

1025
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,756
You're a fairly bright guy, Chuck.

1026
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,038
Figure it out.

1027
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,670
- Chuck. I...
- Take it off.

1028
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,758
Who are you? What's your name?
What's your name?

1029
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:11,432
That's the way it goes on... TV.

1030
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,755
Get off the stage. Get off the stage.

1031
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,393
Go back to Scotland.

1032
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:19,115
Get yourself... a Guinness
and some Lucky Charms.

1033
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,593
Alright.

1034
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,073
Ladies and gentlemen.

1035
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:26,591
Prince of Puns,
the Wizard of Whoopee!

1036
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,869
The Unknown Comic!

1037
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,073
Chuck-a-Daydee.
Chuck-a-Daydee! I got a joke for you.

1038
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,875
What's the difference between
toilet paper and a shower curtain?

1039
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,718
- I don't know.
- Here's the guy!

1040
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,035
Get off the stage. Get off the stage.

1041
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:48,149
- You're fucking crazy, man.
- Get the fuck outta here.

1042
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:51,192
Ladies and gentlemen, our...

1043
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,673
Our next act...

1044
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,633
...first came...

1045
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,878
...to us

1046
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,592
all the way...

1047
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:09,155
Lord, I'm going crazy
on coast to coast.

1048
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,672
You like the way Mummy looks?

1049
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:23,031
I bet you'd like to be a mummy
some day, wouldn't you?

1050
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,109
<i>Come here, you.</i>

1051
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,955
<i>Sorry about your teeth.</i>

1052
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,634
Come on. Take me away now.

1053
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,952
Take me away.

1054
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,877
What are you waiting for?

1055
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,353
Come on.

1056
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,550
Come on. Come on.

1057
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,878
<i>I see you.</i>

1058
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,558
<i>I know who you are.</i>

1059
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,358
<i>Dear Penny.</i>

1060
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:54,950
<i>This is just a note</i>
<i>to say that I'm sorry.</i>

1061
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,752
<i>For all of it.</i>

1062
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:02,753
<i>You were the best part of my life</i>
<i>and I couldn't see it.</i>

1063
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,360
<i>I'm not asking for another chance.</i>

1064
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,950
<i>Just for your forgiveness.</i>

1065
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:12,957
<i>Love, Chuck.</i>

1066
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,357
Well...

1067
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,550
Look who comes out of hiding.

1068
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,350
I started thinking.
You're the only woman in the world

1069
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:44,155
who really knows me. I know
I screwed you over in the past.

1070
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,752
I'm sorry.

1071
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,156
I just want you to know that...

1072
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,950
...I hate myself.

1073
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,956
Goddamn, I hate myself
for how I lived, Trish.

1074
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,034
Nietzsche says,
"Whoever despises oneself

1075
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:10,357
still respects oneself
as one who despises."

1076
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,876
Shit, I never thought of that.

1077
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,958
I can't even despise myself
with any insight.

1078
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,351
Insane asylums are full of people
who think they're Jesus or Satan.

1079
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:26,075
Very few have delusions
of being a guy down the block,

1080
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,555
who works for
an insurance company.

1081
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,558
Coffee.

1082
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,358
Look at this.

1083
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,756
I wanted to be a writer.
I wanted to write something

1084
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:44,351
that someday some lesser person
would quote but I never did.

1085
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,550
I'm the lesser person.

1086
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,149
If I say anything meaningful,
it was said by someone else first.

1087
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,956
I am disposable.

1088
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,558
I disposed of people
and I'm disposable.

1089
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,151
I've been thinking about you
a lot lately, Chuck.

1090
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,952
Yeah?

1091
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,356
- I've missed you.
- You could have fooled me.

1092
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,513
Well, I've mellowed.

1093
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,550
Look, Boston is a beautiful city.

1094
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,398
We could start over here,

1095
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,351
a normal life together.

1096
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,797
Sell insurance.

1097
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,758
Yeah, that sounds good.
That sounds right.

1098
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,958
Look at that.

1099
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,230
I could learn to love that skyline.

1100
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,389
Did you see
I got your picture framed?

1101
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,158
Yeah? Where?

1102
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,719
Hot dog.

1103
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,758
To life.

1104
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,158
To life.

1105
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,358
You devil. Isn't that sweet?

1106
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,956
What about
splitting our time in New York?

1107
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,751
Fuck. I just bit...

1108
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,950
It's just a...

1109
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,630
Too quick. You're supposed to get
to the bathroom and throw up first.

1110
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,354
God, you should have seen
Oliver's face.

1111
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,755
It was just... Well...

1112
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:49,156
If I do say so myself. I got
a nice snapshot of it, actually.

1113
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:55,151
Keeler was easy. He travelled halfway
round the world for a night with me.

1114
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,759
OK.

1115
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,752
Let's see.

1116
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,155
Chuck, you've put on weight.

1117
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,958
Come on.

1118
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:15,510
Nearly blew it with Byrd. Never farm
out a job you should do yourself.

1119
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,958
Do you want a laugh?
He thought you were the mole.

1120
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,877
He was going to kill you.

1121
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,877
What an idiot.

1122
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,151
"I'm not at all the person
you and I took me for."

1123
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,555
Hmm. Sounds like an epitaph.

1124
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,398
Your handwriting, too.

1125
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:34,159
You see, Chuck, I save everything.

1126
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,157
All your lovely notes.

1127
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,752
You know what?

1128
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,149
I like Carlyle best, too.
I really do. Yeah.

1129
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:48,555
Say hi to the boys when you see 'em.

1130
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,152
To life.

1131

Chuck Barris, who, most recently,

1145
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,758

with even more shows
that will stimulate and educate

1149

1150
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:53,679
Hi, how are you?

1151

Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

Hit it. Drive, now!

1153
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:30,752
- Bye...
- There's something I gotta confess.

1154
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,950
Something I gotta tell you.

1155
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,350
Listen.
You've known me a long time.

1156

OK. Yeah, yeah. Listen.

I worked... I worked for the CIA.

1160

You understand? And I killed people.

1161
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,718
I killed a lot...
I killed a lot of people.

1162

You understand?
