1
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,642
MAN:
O'Donnell, save something for the game.

2
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,811
I'm just warming up, coach.

3
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,481
Just talked to the scout again.
He's coming tonight.

4
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,900
You play half the game
I know you're capable of...

5
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,277
...he's prepared to offer you
a full scholarship.

6
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,489
Free ride to college
and the world's your oyster, kid.

7
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:15,991
Thanks, coach.

8
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,787
MURPHY: All right, jockstraps,
let's gather up. Picture time.

9
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,246
Try not to break the camera.

10
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,917
We gotta hang on. Ned's not here yet.

11
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,668
Who cares? He's the water boy.

12
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,171
That doesn't matter,
because he's part of the team.

13
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,840
BOY:
Sorry I'm late! Sorry I'm late!

14
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,677
But what kind of Dungeon Master
would I be...

15
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:39,056
...if I left my party in the middle
of a battle with a hippogriff?

16
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,141
Check it out, it's Merlin the Girlin.

17
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,980
Um, Ned, Ned, look, I'm your best friend,
all right, and I'll always have your back.

18
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,067
But there's only so much I can do
when you show up in a dress.

19
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,487
O'Donnell. How about you and Boy George
join us for this picture?

20
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,239
- Yep. Yep.
- Just one sec.

21
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,201
Give the little guy the sign, please.
Here we are.

22
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,036
Nice, guys. Scoot up in back.

23
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,081
Come on, you gotta look pretty
for the ladies, right? Come on.

24
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,376
Yeah. Let's do it. Three, two, one.

25
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,282
MURPHY:
Hey, Vanilla Ice.

26
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,285
We got a game here. Let's bring it in.

27
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,623
Man, I had to. I had to.

28
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,374
Oh, man, over there.

29
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,755
Who is that stone-cold fox?

30
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,300
Oh, it's my girlfriend.

31
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,886
MAN:
Take no prisoners, bro.

32
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,473
MIKE: Oh, hey, there's my girl.
- Hey.

33
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,644
I'm glad you're here, Scar. This whole
scout thing has me wicked nervous.

34
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,647
I just feel like my whole future's
riding on this game.

35
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,067
Yeah. Yeah, I know how you feel.

36
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,236
Yeah? Is everything...?
Everything's cool, right?

37
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,655
Oh, yeah. Everything's totally copacetic.

38
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,406
- Totally?
- Totally.

39
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,158
MURPHY:
O'Donnell.

40
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,744
I gotta go. See you.

41
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,170
You okay?

42
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,089
Uh, uh...

43
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,510
- We can talk about it later.
- No. Just tell me.

44
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,428
It's your big night. Go enjoy it.

45
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,431
I can't enjoy it unless you tell me
what's going on.

46
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,850
Okay.

47
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,894
Um...

48
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,000
O'Donnell!

49
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,397
Wake up!

50
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,732
MURPHY:
O'Donnell!

51
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,319
What are you doing?

52
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,899
MIKE:
Scar! Scar, hey.

53
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,108
Hey, Scarlet.

54
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,820
- Hey, hey. Hey, what are you doing?
- Mike, what are you doing?

55
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,948
Look, you and me,
we're in this together, okay?

56
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,619
- But the game. That's your future.
- No, the baby's my future.

57
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,954
- That's crazy.
- You're my future.

58
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,208
I can't let you throw this all away.
I won't let you.

59
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,591
Thank you for letting me stay here, Ned.

60
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,511
Oh, yeah. No problem.

61
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,516
- You good on the Cap'n?
- I'm good on the Captain.

62
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,188
Hey, Mike?

63
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,693
Mike, I can tell you're down,
but trust me on this.

64
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,529
You're looking at Scarlet
kicking you out of the house...

65
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,992
...and the kids wanting nothing to do
with you as a negative, when in fact...

66
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,039
- I guess it's mostly negative, isn't it?
- Well, yeah.

67
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,375
I had no upside for that.

68
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,545
Hey! You're getting that
big promotion today, right?

69
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,380
Yes. Yes, I am.

70
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,216
Today everything turns around for me.

71
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,177
Knock them dead.

72
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,096
I love you!

73
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,403
MAN:
So anyway...

74
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,572
...the way corporate
wants us to spin it...

75
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,742
...is that maybe, in certain situations...

76
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,370
...a four-hour erection
isn't such a terrible thing.

77
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,582
Okay. Next up:

78
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,003
As most of you know, today I am proud to
be naming our new regional sales manager.

79
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,755
- Here we go.
- You know...

80
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:32,761
...l've been in the pharmaceutical game
for almost two years now...

81
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,223
...and people always ask me:
"What's it take to be an RSM?"

82
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,099
Leadership.

83
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,936
Courage.

84
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,438
Integrity.

85
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:48,401
But most importantly,
dedication to this company.

86
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,947
So congratulations. Mike.

87
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:57,285
Mike, if you could slide to your left so I
can congratulate our new RSM, Wendy!

88
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,579
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

89
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,292
Go out there and push some pills,
my peeps.

90
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,919
WOMAN:
Good job, baby!

91
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,964
Bye-bye, thanks.

92
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,591
See you at practice. Mmm.

93
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,180
Mike. What's crack-a-lacking, coz?

94
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,600
Well, I'll tell you what's crack-a-lacking.
Are you kidding me?

95
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,479
Wendy's been here two months.
I've been here 16 years.

96
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,314
I got the best numbers on the team.

97
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,817
You should think of it as a compliment.

98
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:34,072
Think of it as us saying,
"You're just too valuable to promote."

99
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,825
- You little...
- Shh, shh, shh, hello?

100
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,995
Hey, buddy. No, no, no, I got time.

101
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:44,332
Ha. I know, right?
Look, listen, she was my doubles par...

102
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,924
So many girls and only one promotion,
but you guys are so supportive.

103
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,343
- But, Wendy, you did it.
- Thank you.

104
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,263
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

105
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,765
You guys! OMG.

106
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:05,020
Oh, and it gets better,
because we are going to T.G.I. Friday's!

107
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,646
- Shut up!
- Aah!

108
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,048
MAN:
Mike O'Donnell.

109
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,094
Do I know you?

110
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,596
No. But I know you.

111
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,556
Oh, yeah?

112
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,894
High school star.
Never quite lived up to your potential.

113
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,482
Sooner or later you all come back
to the old school.

114
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,111
Stand there and look at the picture
of the glory days...

115
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,613
...wondering what might have been.

116
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,950
Seems to me you guys
are living in the past.

117
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,328
Well, of course I want to live in the past.

118
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,080
It was better there.

119
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,960
I'll bet you wish you had it
to do all over again.

120
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,004
Huh. You got that right.

121
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,134
You're sure about that?

122
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,011
MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

123
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,390
GIRL: Dad.
- Hi, Mr. O'Donnell.

124
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,059
- Ladies.
MAGGIE: What are you doing here?

125
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,145
MIKE:
Oh, I was just talking to...

126
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,480
...nobody.

127
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,485
Doesn't matter. I got off work early,
and I thought we could get ice cream.

128
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,029
Together?

129
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,825
- Why?
- Just go get your brother, okay?

130
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,162
WOMAN:
Do you need anything else?

131
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,955
No, we're fine.

132
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,503
What's the matter?
This used to be your favorite place.

133
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,673
- We used to come here for your birthday.
- When I was, like, 8.

134
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,184
So, Al, basketball season's coming up.

135
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,393
- You ready?
- Yeah.

136
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,353
- Been working on that outside shot?
- Mm-hm.

137
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,646
- Passing?
- Good.

138
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,440
- Dribbling?
- Really good.

139
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,525
Good's not going to get you
a scholarship.

140
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,361
I meant, it's great.
It's great, Dad. It's great.

141
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,947
That's my boy. Remember,
it's not how big you are.

142
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,157
It's how big you play.

143
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,742
Right up here.

144
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,620
Uh, Maggie got into Georgetown.

145
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,122
Maggie, that's awesome.

146
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,708
Can you turn down the?

147
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,103
Okay, guys, see you soon.

148
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:40,068
Love you. Nice chatting with you.

149
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:56,584
What the hell are you doing?

150
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,171
Hey, that's my stuff.

151
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,885
Why are you destroying our yard?

152
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,096
It's not our yard. It's my yard, remember?

153
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,183
You took the road not taken.
And I get the yard.

154
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,023
I'm going to turn it into a showpiece
for my clients.

155
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,402
- Clients of what?
- Landscape design.

156
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,778
Landscape design?

157
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,281
I'm going to show people what I can do.

158
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,452
Yeah, well, the divorce isn't final for
another two weeks, so you have no right.

159
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,790
Really? So I've spent the last 18 years
of my life listening to you whine...

160
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,210
...about the things you could've done
without me, and I have no right?

161
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,589
- It's just I put a lot of work into this yard.
- Did you?

162
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,133
Really? Like the barbeque pit?

163
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,551
Yeah.

164
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,805
Yeah. The way I remember that is that
you spent about an hour working on it...

165
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,767
...and then you spent the next two days
complaining about...

166
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,979
...if you had gone to college,
you could've hired someone to do it.

167
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,399
- I don't think it was a whole two days.
- Or the hammock over here.

168
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,650
Yeah.

169
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:06,905
I think you quit that one because
you just decided not to try anymore.

170
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,699
Look, try to see things
from my point of view.

171
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,577
I am extremely disappointed with my life.

172
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,495
I never asked you to marry me.

173
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,997
Yeah, but I did.

174
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,044
Well...

175
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,465
...you don't have to do me
any more favors, then.

176
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,092
We're not going to hold each
other back anymore, okay?

177
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,804
- Scar...
- I'll see you at court, okay? At the trial.

178
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,306
WOMAN:
Scarlet.

179
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,515
Naomi!

180
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,684
- You came.
WOMAN: Of course I came.

181
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,229
What bridesmaid would I be if I
didn't hold your hand during the divorce?

182
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:44,108
Now, just remember.
The first one's always the hardest.

183
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,610
- Mike.
- Naomi.

184
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,153
- Naomi.
- I don't care.

185
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,448
Let's get going. We got to get you ready.
Back on the market.

186
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,824
Yeah, I'm a real catch.

187
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:56,037
Single mom with two teenage kids
and manure caked under my fingernails.

188
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,665
You'll do great. You got the butt
of a 12-year-old boy.

189
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,125
That's terrific.
I hope our daughter heard that.

190
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,836
Ugh. When was the last time you waxed?

191
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,676
Bye, Mike.

192
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,391
Bye.

193
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,382
MAN
You're sure about that?

194
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,269
Jesus.

195
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,409
Hey! Get off of there!

196
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,634
Oh, no. Hello?

197
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,180
Hello?! Hello?!

198
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,314
What the?

199
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,029
Oh, no!

200
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,661
Oh, man.

201
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,166
Ned?

202
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,709
Thief!

203
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,296
No, no, no, Ned!
Ned, no, no, no! It's me!

204
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,428
Stop! Stop!

205
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,435
Ned?

206
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,483
Oh, wow. I feel great.

207
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,069
Ha, ha.

208
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,490
MIKE:
What are you doing? No, Ned.

209
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,743
- Aah! Aah!
- No.

210
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,582
No, no, no, Ned!

211
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,386
Ned! Come on! It's me, it's Mike!

212
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,769
Ned, Ned, Ned, I'm telling you,
I'm telling you, stop it! Stop it! Now!

213
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,439
Oh.

214
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,274
An elegant weapon...

215
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,902
...from a more civilized time.

216
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,368
Hey, it's me! It's Mike O'Donnell,
your best friend!

217
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,955
You have an undescended testicle.

218
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,458
Googleable!

219
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,834
Ned!

220
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,796
You helped me cheat on my math test,
but I got caught.

221
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,049
Public record!

222
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,559
You asked Princess Leia to junior prom.

223
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,145
Covered by the local news.

224
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,905
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

225
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Please.

226
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,745
- Oh!
- Ha, ha!

227
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,624
Oh, my God.

228
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,919
No, no, no.

229
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,629
Ned, Ned.

230
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,590
Oh, my God.

231
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,313
MIKE:
Would you stop staring at me?

232
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,525
- It's freaking me out.
- It's freaking me out!

233
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,652
I'm pubescent!

234
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,534
Okay. So, uh...

235
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,536
...it's a classic transformation story.

236
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,747
It appears in the literature
time and time again.

237
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,250
Were you at any point shot
by a gamma ray?

238
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,087
- No.
- Exposed to gamma radiation of any kind?

239
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,172
- No, Ned.
- No?

240
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,550
You wouldn't see it. Okay.

241
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,929
That eliminates these and those
and most of that side.

242
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,184
Are you now or have you ever been...

243
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,314
...a Norse god, vampire,
or time-traveling cyborg?

244
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,400
I've known you since, what, first grade?
I would have told you.

245
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,154
Vampire wouldn't tell.
Cyborg wouldn't know.

246
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,822
Shut up.

247
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:10,077
Okay, if it's not any of those,
I guess, um, we're looking at your basic...

248
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,540
...spirit guide transformation magic.
That's kind of a biggie, actually.

249
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,460
That is here.

250
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,378
When the hero...

251
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,006
- I guess that's... I guess, you.
- Hm.

252
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,926
Uh, is transformed by his spirit guide...

253
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,762
...to set him on a new path.

254
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,598
- Which is what?
- Do I look like your spirit guide?

255
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,855
The janitor.

256
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,941
The janitor.

257
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,456
You guys seen the janitor?
You seen the janitor?

258
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,042
- Do you know where the janitor is?
GIRL: No.

259
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,295
Hey, where's the janitor?
Where does the janitor work?

260
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,464
- Excuse me!
- You all right, kid?

261
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,966
- There's another janitor who works here.
- Just me.

262
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,969
No, no. There's an older guy
with white hair who works here.

263
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:13,766
I was here yesterday talking to the janit...
I showed him this picture of me.

264
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,060
WOMAN: You?
- Yeah.

265
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,979
That picture's from 1989.

266
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,818
Right. Forget it.

267
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,784
Alex!

268
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,327
Alex, buddy!

269
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,746
Alex!

270
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:11,991
Hello?

271
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,162
Spirit guide?

272
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,665
What am I supposed to do?

273
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,376
Don't know what I'm supposed to do.

274
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,178
NED:
Ouch. Oh, ow.

275
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,264
I got shot. Did I get shot or did I get...?
Someone got powned.

276
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,060
- It's a grenade.
MIKE: Ned.

277
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,146
Aah! Oh, sorry. Teenage you.

278
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,191
I figured it out.
I figured out what I'm supposed to do.

279
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,568
I figured out what my spirit guide
wants me to do.

280
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,986
I'm going back.

281
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,407
I'm going back to high school, Ned!

282
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,076
No! No, no. No way.

283
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,079
Your spirit guide would not waste
transformation magic...

284
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,916
...on you reliving your senior year
and going to prom. No.

285
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:07,004
Ned, this is my chance to have my life over,
but to do it right.

286
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,340
- Wouldn't you, if you had the chance?
- No.

287
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,092
I'm rich, and nobody stuck
my head in a toilet today.

288
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,011
Sure. Besides, it's not just about me.

289
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,265
- It's about you.
- No, it's much bigger than me.

290
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,559
- It's about you.
- Okay, maybe it's about me...

291
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,269
...but what's wrong with that?

292
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,397
I have not done anything
for me since 1989.

293
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:30,361
You do what you have to do. But don't
think about sucking me into this with you.

294
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,404
Hayden was the low point
of my existence...

295
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:36,867
...and I vowed I would never go back
to that godforsaken place!

296
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,287
Never, ever, ever!

297
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,707
Never! Never, ever, ever!

298
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,587
I hate you.

299
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,131
Hello.

300
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,301
I'm here to enroll my son...

301
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,428
...in school.

302
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,013
Mark.

303
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,140
What's up?

304
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,687
NED:
So...

305
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,484
So we'll just have a seat
till you're ready for us.

306
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,486
We'll be right, uh... Okay.

307
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,663
What's this you're wearing?

308
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:29,253
This is cool. This is hip. I have a picture
of Kevin Federline wearing the same thing.

309
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,672
- I don't know who that is.
- What are you wearing?

310
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,257
- I told you, like a dad.
- I am.

311
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,593
- You look like Clay Aiken.
- Leave him out of this.

312
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:42,224
MIKE: Are you sure these look legit?
- Oh, yeah. Look who you're talking to.

313
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:47,187
I'm the guy who invented the software
that prevents people from stealing music.

314
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,482
I also invented the software
that helps people steal music...

315
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,026
...but that's a happy coincidence.

316
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,487
MIKE:
What is that?

317
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,032
Oh, my G...

318
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,950
- Wrong. These are for me.
- You kidding?

319
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,871
- What's-her-name and Chewie's for me.
- Miss Masterson will see you now.

320
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,122
Let's go.

321
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,542
Just don't try to be funny, all right?

322
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,794
Say as little as possible.

323
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,464
Hey, watch where you're going, toolbag.

324
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:17,092
- So sorry, sir. Our fault.
- Stan.

325
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,684
Hello. I'm Jane Masterson,
principal here at Hayden High.

326
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,394
MIKE:
Hi.

327
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,576
Hello.

328
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,912
JANE: Hi.
- Hi.

329
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,914
Uh, okay.

330
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,875
Yeah, I think we're good here.

331
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,794
Sorry.

332
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,839
I think our hands just made a baby.

333
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:00,719
Excuse my dad. He's not used to
talking to attractive women.

334
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,513
Oh, thank you...

335
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,556
- Mark.
JANE: Mark...

336
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,394
...for that flattering
yet totally inappropriate comment.

337
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,770
Please sit.

338
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,943
Before we get started, I think you should
know that, uh, Mark's a bastard.

339
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,404
Excuse me?

340
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,572
I had him out of wedlock, so...

341
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,950
...l'm single.

342
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,451
And I'm very rich.

343
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,289
Okay.

344
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,959
- Did you bring your transcripts?
- Oh, yeah.

345
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,211
Transcripts.

346
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:38,048
JANE: Last school you went to was
Cutler High in Connecticut.

347
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,217
Straight-A student. Very impressive.

348
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,137
Math club...

349
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,639
...National Merit finalist...

350
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,892
...Coney Island
Hot Dog Eating Champion.

351
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,984
Well, I think Hayden
would be lucky to have you.

352
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,112
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

353
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,829
Uh, yes, Mr. Gold.
Do you have a question?

354
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,832
Your hair is pretty.

355
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:16,086
Ah. Not a question, but thank you.

356
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,757
Would the lady mind if I smelled it?

357
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,510
Now is probably a good time to tell you
that I don't date students' parents.

358
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,016
Well, maybe I should tell you that I never
don't not date the principal of my child.

359
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,977
Okay, come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

360
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,229
Let's go.

361
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,982
NED:
I was about to close!

362
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,360
MIKE: You have to do it right now?
Just calm down. You're a dad.

363
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:44,156
- Hi. Oh, my gosh. We're in.
- You see her undress me with her eyes?

364
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,158
I don't think that's what that was.

365
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,453
Hey. Wow. I don't know how we did it.

366
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,246
It's Maggie's friends. Watch this.

367
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,957
- Hey, girls, how's it going?
JAIME: Do I know you?

368
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,417
What'd you do, mug K-Fed?

369
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,382
Welcome to the bottom
of the food chain.

370
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,971
Hey, look, you always had
my back in high school, okay?

371
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,891
So if your spirit guide
wants you to be a fake teenager...

372
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,018
...and me to be your fake dad...

373
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,355
...the least I can do is make sure
that my fake son doesn't look...

374
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,024
...like a total douche.

375
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,236
- I don't look like a douche.
BOY: What a douche.

376
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,446
We're going shopping.

377
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,241
- Really?
- Yes, your shirt is bedazzled.

378
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,743
Bedazzled with rhinestones.

379
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,098
Ooh.

380
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,100
Let's go to school.

381
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,434
BOY:
Hey, yo, check it out.

382
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,103
That's just rude.

383
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,188
What's up, dude?

384
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,696
What are you looking at, punk?

385
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,158
BOY 1: Watch it.
BOY 2: Wake up, douche.

386
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,746
Sorry.

387
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,168
No phones, no texting.

388
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,589
Settle, people. Settle down.

389
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,425
Take the roughhousing outside, class.

390
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,640
Hello?

391
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,935
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you?

392
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,521
Oh, cr...

393
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,691
- The thing.
SCARLET: You mean our divorce?

394
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,610
Do you take any of this seriously?

395
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,821
No, no! Yes, I take this seriously.

396
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:33,617
I had to leave the country
very suddenly, uh...

397
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,536
...with the Mayan... Inca,
I'm with the Incas in Peru.

398
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,664
We think we might have found the next...

399
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,041
...Rogaine.

400
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,378
Are you with a girl?

401
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,381
No, no. It's, uh, a bunch of cheerleaders.

402
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:51,009
So would you consider
maybe dating a 10th-grader?

403
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,053
I think we could go for full custody.

404
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,305
No, you can't take my kids
away from me.

405
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,557
Since when do you care?

406
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,313
MIKE:
Look...

407
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,693
...l'm a lot closer to them than you think.

408
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,237
Let's reschedule, okay?

409
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,282
Hey, Maggie.

410
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,080
Um, why is the new kid waving at me?

411
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,999
SAMANTHA:
I don't know.

412
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,167
But if that boy were an apple...

413
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,794
...he'd be a Delicious.

414
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,088
MIKE:
Oh, God.

415
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,512
Gosh, we are all in such great shape.

416
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,264
Oh, jeez.

417
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,517
Man, you know, I will tell you something.

418
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,603
In 10 years you're going
to have this thing right here...

419
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:48,400
...that no amount of crunches will
get rid of. And spot reduction, total lie.

420
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,444
You know, l...

421
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,572
Never mind. Give me the ball.

422
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,782
Fakes right, goes left.

423
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,909
And signature move.

424
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,787
Kid.

425
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,918
- I'm Coach Murphy.
- Oh, wow.

426
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,629
- You're still here?
- What?

427
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,090
You're a legend.

428
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,510
Yeah. Well, yeah. Twenty years.

429
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,180
It's actually my last one.

430
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,099
Good hops, kid. Nice handle.

431
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,226
We're looking for a point guard.

432
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,811
Oh, yeah?

433
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:30,150
- Why don't you come to tryouts?
- Okay.

434
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,570
- I'm done talking to you.
- Yeah, yeah.

435
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,616
Hey, how's it going?

436
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,825
MIKE
Things are looking up.

437
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,828
Coach Murphy practically
put me on the team.

438
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,581
That's not a coincidence.
We're on the path.

439
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,001
That's great. That's super you're finding
your destiny and, blah, blah, whatever.

440
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,587
Here's something.
I need you to do something for me.

441
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,339
I need you to get in trouble.

442
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,965
Not, like, big trouble.

443
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,803
Just enough trouble so that the principal
needs to meet with your father.

444
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,596
Yeah, okay, well, we'll see.

445
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,807
- Oh! Boom.
BOY Ned!

446
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,100
NED:
Boom. Checkmate, Samir!

447
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,102
- Damn it!
NED: Checkmate.

448
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,605
BOY:
Uh, can I get a little help in here?

449
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,609
Alex?

450
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,867
How does it...?

451
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,163
- Who did this to you?
- The basketball team.

452
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,709
But why? Why? You're one of them.

453
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,128
You're popular.

454
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,966
Uh, look, this is kind of personal,
and I don't know you.

455
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,342
- I'm taped to the toilet.
- Yeah.

456
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:42,055
I'm sorry, I'm Mark Gold, uh,
your uncle Ned's kid. I just started here.

457
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,307
Oh, cool. Cool, yeah.

458
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,685
Well, I'd shake your hand...

459
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,979
...but it's taped to my ass.
- Right. Right.

460
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,355
Would you mind?

461
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,233
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Yeah, um.

462
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,569
- Just rip.
- I'm going to get it.

463
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,863
- Band-Aid.
- Go for it.

464
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,910
ALEX:
So how come we never met?

465
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,915
My mom didn't want anyone to know
she had a kid with Ned.

466
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,168
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

467
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,254
So since we're practically
family and all...

468
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,924
...my dad says we should just
keep an eye on each other, you know?

469
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,551
Uh, yeah. Why not?

470
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,762
Next time you could get there
before they tape me to the toilet.

471
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,472
You got it.

472
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,393
This looks good.

473
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,483
Who's that?

474
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,943
Oh, uh...

475
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,778
- Nicole.
- Are you two going out?

476
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,489
No, no, she's the, uh, head cheerleader.

477
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,450
She'd never go out with me.

478
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,453
You know, when I first met
your mother, I was so nervous...

479
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,121
You met my mother?

480
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,539
- What?
- My mother.

481
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,417
You said, "The first time I met
your mother, I was nervous."

482
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,712
- Oh, that's weird. Is your mom hot?
- Dude, what...?

483
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,799
- What do I say to that?
- I was joking. Joking, dude.

484
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,971
ALEX:
Stan.

485
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,142
I hate that guy.

486
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,978
- Oh.
- Thanks.

487
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,188
BOY: What?
- Huh.

488
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,523
- Freshman.
STAN: Good sandwich.

489
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,152
Is that the guy
who taped you to the toilet?

490
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,528
MIKE:
Yeah.

491
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,740
Yesterday he shoved me in a
washing machine in my own house.

492
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,327
- What was that jerk doing at your house?
- It's Maggie's boyfriend.

493
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,664
Maggie has a boyfriend?

494
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,501
Well...

495
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,504
...l'm very disappointed in your sister.

496
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,925
He's looking. Don't make eye contact.
He's kind of temperamental.

497
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,345
- You're looking. Stop it, stop it.
- I'll look at him.

498
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,389
STAN:
Hey, twinkle douche.

499
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:53,270
If I wanted you in the cafeteria,
I would've taped you to a lunch lady.

500
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,273
MIKE:
You little punk.

501
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,692
You don't talk to him that way.

502
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,988
STAN:
Yeah?

503
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,865
What are you gonna do?

504
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:11,997
What am I gonna do?

505
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,667
First...

506
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,670
...l'm going to call your father.

507
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,800
Heads up!

508
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,228
Give me my ball back, bitch.

509
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,731
You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you.

510
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,900
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I do.

511
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,736
All too well.

512
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,779
You're the man.

513
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,073
Captain of the basketball team.

514
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,492
Dates the pretty girls.

515
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,829
High school is your kingdom.

516
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,707
But, people...

517
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,959
...Stan's a bully.

518
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,586
Why?

519
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:05,717
It'd be way too easy to say Stan preys
on the weak simply because he's a dick.

520
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,093
No.

521
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,429
No, no.

522
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,264
Stan here...

523
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,267
...is much more complex than that.

524
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,437
See, according to leading psychiatrists...

525
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,899
...Stan's a bully for one of three reasons.

526
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,026
One:

527
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,737
Underneath all of that male bravado...

528
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,783
...there's an insecure little girl banging
on the closet door trying to get out.

529
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,454
Two:

530
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,373
Like a caveman...

531
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,708
...Stan's brain is...

532
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,252
...underdeveloped.

533
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,464
Therefore, Stan is unable
to use self-control.

534
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,800
And so he acts out aggressively.

535
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,969
And the third reason:

536
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,430
Stan has a small wiener.

537
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,035
Don't hurt yourself, big boy.

538
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,923
Whoa, whoa, hey. Drinking age is still 21,
thank you very much.

539
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,927
Unless your spirit guide gave you
a fake ID, this is mine.

540
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,474
What are you eating?

541
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,394
I don't even know.
I just know I'm hungry.

542
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,020
All the time.

543
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,897
Okay, that's not safe or sanitary.

544
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,817
That's your can now.
We'll label it like that.

545
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,197
So, what did you learn at school today?

546
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,202
- That I'm a bad dad.
- I thought it was going great.

547
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,205
It was going fantastic for me.

548
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,790
And then what?

549
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:07,172
And then I found out my son spent the
last year being the school punching bag...

550
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,092
...and watched my daughter get a
tongue bath from a psychopathic jackass.

551
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,136
High school's delightful, isn't it?

552
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,681
Yeah. But I think I was wrong
about my spirit path.

553
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,975
NED:
And who was right? See? I told you.

554
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,144
I told you high school
was the wrong thing.

555
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:25,023
High school was right,
but it's not about basketball.

556
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,734
It's about helping Alex and Maggie.

557
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,279
Mmm.

558
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,491
All right. I'm getting out of here.

559
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,744
- Disgusting.
- My kids need their father.

560
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,253
- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, Mark.

561
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,591
What was that?

562
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,511
A three-pointer.

563
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,389
Can you do that twice in a row?

564
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,855
Okay. Let's see you do it
with a little pressure.

565
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,406
Wow, you're great.
You should be on the team.

566
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,745
You should be on the team.
I'm going to get you on the team.

567
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,749
That's it. That'll solve everything.

568
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,126
Dude, what are you talking about?

569
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,628
Nothing.

570
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:39,722
Well, that was fun. I haven't been to
happy hour in, like, a week and a half.

571
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,059
Naomi, thank you so much.
That is exactly what I needed.

572
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,769
NAOMl:
Oh, great.

573
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,480
SCARLET: Mike who?
- Mike who? I've never heard of the guy.

574
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,940
Ow.

575
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,902
Hey, Mom, this is Mark,
Uncle Ned's bastard.

576
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,362
Wow.

577
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,657
I know. Someone had a kid
with Uncle Ned. Ew.

578
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,327
You okay, Mrs. O'Donnell?

579
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,162
Yeah, I'm fine.

580
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,207
It's "Ms.," kid. It's "Ms.," Scarlet.
Don't forget that.

581
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,625
Oh, right.

582
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,256
Wow.

583
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,261
You look just like my husband.
Doesn't he?

584
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,723
- My ex-husband. That is so weird.
- Heh, heh.

585
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,016
It is weird.

586
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,851
SCARLET:
What is that?

587
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,477
NAOMl:
Scarlet, I need you to come.

588
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,854
SCARLET:
Weird.

589
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,522
- Do you see that?
- I did see it.

590
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,025
SCARLET: You see him?
- She's nice.

591
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,443
But look at him.

592
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,779
You gotta let that guy go,
just out of your brain and move on.

593
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,949
I know you need to grieve
a relationship. It's only natural.

594
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,367
Okay.

595
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,120
You wait here.
I'm going to go smell him.

596
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,624
No, no, no. Sweetie.
You're not allowed to smell teenagers.

597
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,044
Sweetie, you need to hear me on this.
Here's the thing.

598
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,087
The other thing,
you need to acknowledge...

599
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:56,549
...that he looks exactly like Mike
used to look in high school.

600
00:43:56,717 --> 00:44:00,470
We discussed that. I have looked at him.
But, honey, this is the thing:

601
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,722
You need to hook up with someone new.

602
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,727
Yeah, I deserve to have somebody
smile at me and tell me I'm pretty.

603
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,562
- You do.
- Even if it is...

604
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,148
...to just get me to go home with him.

605
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:17,195
Or lunch. But, yes, we're gonna
find you a new playmate. Ow!

606
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,822
You little turd. You little snot.

607
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,491
My bad. Gosh, I'm so sorry.

608
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,745
I guess I was, uh, kind of distracted,
as I imagine Alex was...

609
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:29,207
...at hearing about how his mother,
who is still married, by the way...

610
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,876
...is planning to run around
with every guy she can get.

611
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,838
In Afghanistan, she'd be dragged through
the streets by goats with her hands cut off.

612
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,924
I'm just saying. I'm just saying, Naomi.

613
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,385
- Naomi.
- I don't care.

614
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,652
- Hey, guys.
MAGGIE: Oh.

615
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,779
Okay, settle down. Take your seats.

616
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,616
Thank you, thank you. Thank you, Stan.
Thank you.

617
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:09,455
Okay, today we will be continuing
our discussion on human sexuality.

618
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:14,585
And as we discussed,
the official school policy is abstinence.

619
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,462
Now, that is very sensible.

620
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,590
I'm glad that someone here
has their head screwed on straight.

621
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:23,386
I think all of us should make a pact
to abstain from sex.

622
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,805
Now, who's with me, you guys?
Come on.

623
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,224
Oh, my God.

624
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,895
- Maggie?
- Hm?

625
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,273
DELL:
However, let's get real.

626
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,735
I know asking high school seniors
to be abstinent...

627
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,822
...is like asking a porcupine
to poop goat cheese. Yuck.

628
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:47,493
So since the majority of you are or will
become sexually active at some point...

629
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:52,457
But that point should be way,
way in the future, right?

630
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,126
Well, the official school position...

631
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,503
...is that we prepare you
for safe sex now.

632
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,674
So please take one and pass it down.

633
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,348
I have needs.

634
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:14,771
- You don't need these.
DELL: Stan, give one to Mark.

635
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:19,108
No. No, you know what, he's right.
He's right. I don't need one.

636
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:23,029
You know why I don't need one?
Because there's no one I'm in love with.

637
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,239
It's called "making love," isn't it?

638
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:30,787
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I think that
means you do it with someone you love.

639
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,372
And preferably when you're married.

640
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,294
You know, when you're ready to take
that love and turn it into a baby.

641
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,756
Because that's what love is.

642
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:45,051
It's that first moment
when you hold your baby girl...

643
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:50,890
...and you didn't know that anything
could be so small or so delicate.

644
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,976
And you feel that tiny heart beat...

645
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:58,689
...and you know that you couldn't love
anything more in the whole world.

646
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,236
And you hope that you can do right
by that little girl...

647
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:08,157
...and always be there to catch her when
she falls, and that nothing ever hurts her.

648
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,868
Not a broken arm...

649
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,246
...or a bad dream...

650
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,750
...or a broken heart.

651
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,342
- I don't want these. Just take them.
LAUREN: Me either.

652
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,885
Are you serious?

653
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,805
Great, fine, wonderful.

654
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,682
More for me.

655
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,768
Now I got enough
for the whole weekend.

656
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,022
Oh, my God!

657
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,985
- Stan!
- Boys, stop it!

658
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,903
Break it up! Get off him, Stan!

659
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,699
Put those phones away! Stop it!

660
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,368
- Stop hitting him!
DELL: No fighting!

661
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,372
- You like that?
- You're gonna go to jail again.

662
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,628
BOY: Look at that.
He slapped him like a mother.

663
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,255
GIRL:
That thing sucks.

664
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,301
- Oh!
- Oh, that's wrong.

665
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:12,013
Yo, check this out.
My cousin in New York sent it to me.

666
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,526
I hope I'm not late for our meeting.

667
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,821
Busted for fighting, nice. Who won?

668
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,991
You know, it was actually pretty even.

669
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,659
Really?

670
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,162
On YouTube it looked like
you got your ass kicked.

671
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,205
I saw it a couple times.

672
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,042
- What are you wearing?
- Hm?

673
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,544
- Beckham.
- No, what?

674
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,254
Oh, the clothes. Oh, right.

675
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,757
To the untrained eye,
I look like a total idiot.

676
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,258
You do, in fact.

677
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,930
Ah. But it's actually a seduction technique
known as "peacocking."

678
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:58,351
My outfit serves the dual function
of icebreaker and attention-getter.

679
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,270
You can go in now.

680
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,356
Watch.

681
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,530
Are you peacocking?

682
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,367
Really? You think that's gonna work?

683
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,993
I think it just might.

684
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:29,757
Is that? Mrs. O'Donnell!
How you doing?

685
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,092
Hello, how are you?

686
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,677
I'm good. How are you?

687
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,428
Good.

688
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,265
Wow.
This is gonna take some getting used to.

689
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,184
You're Ned's son?

690
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,603
Yeah. Yeah. Ned gave birth to me.

691
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,564
Well, he didn't give birth...
You know what I meant.

692
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,402
You're doing some gardening.

693
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,029
- I'm redoing the backyard.
- Oh.

694
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,322
You want to see?

695
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,325
Yeah, sure. I got some time.

696
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,246
Oh, wow.

697
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:04,750
Yeah. Obviously, I still have a lot to do.

698
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,044
- You can put that...
- Right here?

699
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,504
All right.

700
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,840
Thank you.

701
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,009
- So this is it.
- This is it.

702
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,593
It used to look a lot worse.

703
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,638
Mm-mm.

704
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:23,352
Basically, uh, what I planned to do was
to put a pond in over here...

705
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,063
- Okay.
...and have water...

706
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,816
...streaming in from both sides.

707
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:33,070
And then put a big deck right here...

708
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:38,951
...and then a flagstone patio there
with sod in between.

709
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,536
That would be pretty.

710
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:45,958
And then to have twinkling lights
above the whole thing...

711
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,627
...so that every night is a starry one.

712
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,129
Heh.

713
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,631
It's gonna be amazing, Scar.

714
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,050
What did you just call me?

715
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,052
Uh...

716
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,804
- I just said, "lt'll be amazing."
- You called me "Scar."

717
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,682
My husband's the only one
who calls me that.

718
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,392
Could you use some help?

719
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,396
Volunteer. I'm young, I'm strong.

720
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,190
Oh. Oh.

721
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,484
Right, got it. Okay.

722
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,573
I realize that whole
lady cougar hunting...

723
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:22,161
...the "mothers I'd like to,"
you know, whatever, thing...

724
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,664
...is big with you guys, right?
With you high school boys?

725
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,417
But that's not gonna happen
between me and you.

726
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,961
I didn't even mean it that way.

727
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:36,175
I was thinking more along the lines of
business experience, college application.

728
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,803
But if you want to go there, that's...

729
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,971
- So I'll just get you a shovel, then?
- Yeah.

730
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,348
Okay.

731
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:31,814
What?

732
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:13,439
MIKE: I said we could do it!
- Called it.

733
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,733
Did you see the look on Stan's face?

734
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:21,238
Alex? What happened at the tryouts?
How'd it go?

735
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:25,534
It was good. Mark had a great tryout.
He played great.

736
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,204
- Yeah.
- And so did I. I made the team.

737
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,207
Really? Oh, great! That's so good.
I'm so proud of you.

738
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,625
Me too.

739
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,293
He did great out there.

740
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,378
Oh, Mark. That's super inappropriate.

741
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,464
L... Good job today.

742
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,924
- Good job!
- Thanks.

743
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:43,260
I want to show you something.
Come here. I wanna show you guys.

744
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,307
Ta-da.

745
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,727
- You hung the lights.
SCARLET: Yes.

746
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,812
- Wow.
- Wow.

747
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,232
I wanted you guys to be the first to see.

748
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,067
- Mom, it's sick.
SCARLET: Really?

749
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,236
ALEX:
It's so good.

750
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,696
Oh, my gosh.

751
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:07,493
Mark. Mark, we should go practice, dude.

752
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,246
The game's on Friday.
Mom, such a good job.

753
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,919
What do you think?

754
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,462
It's amazing.

755
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:23,342
When people see how talented you are,
you'll be designing gardens all over the city.

756
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,843
Really?

757
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,679
Well, thank you, Mark. That's nice.

758
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:32,351
Oh.

759
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:37,022
- I have to go. I have a date tonight.
- You have a...? You have a date?

760
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:40,818
I'm going dancing, which is ridiculous
because I'm a terrible dancer.

761
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,321
- You're an amazing dancer.
- What?

762
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,366
- Hm? Ahem.
- Wh...?

763
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,285
You just look like you can move.

764
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,203
Um, okay.

765
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,873
I'm going to go, so have fun, Mark.

766
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,542
Night.

767
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:15,936
- What are you looking at?
- That was great.

768
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,731
That is The Snake.

769
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,483
That was a very hot dance
when you were 1.

770
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,820
- Teach it to me.
- I can't.

771
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,114
It's a very advanced step...

772
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,826
...which I know is hard to believe
because I make it look effortless.

773
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,662
That's the secret to all great dancers.

774
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,206
Try me.

775
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,211
Why did you pick that song?

776
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:44,840
Oh, I don't know.
It just, uh, kind of spoke to me.

777
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,009
Hm. That's funny.

778
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:50,095
That's the song that my husband
and I danced to at our wedding.

779
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,389
Hm. A man of good taste.

780
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,641
- Want me to show you some dance moves?
- I'd love to.

781
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,101
That I learned at my wedding.

782
00:55:56,269 --> 00:56:00,647
- Great.
- Yeah. Okay, you stand here, like that.

783
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,275
Okay, like that, and I'll stand here.

784
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,445
- No, you stand right there.
- Right there.

785
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:10,991
Okay, ready? So you go
right foot back and then left foot back.

786
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:15,120
And then quick
right, left, right, left, right.

787
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,956
And then right... Oh.

788
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,043
That was good.
And left, right, left, right.

789
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,087
That's good.

790
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:26,215
That was really good.
You're picking that up pretty quickly.

791
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,342
MIKE: So you mentioned your husband.
- Mm-hm.

792
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,803
Do you think you guys are ever
going to get back together?

793
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,138
Um, no.

794
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,641
Why are you so sure?

795
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:39,019
Maybe there's something he could do
to fix things.

796
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:42,356
I love my husband and care about him...

797
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,568
...but sometimes that just is not enough.

798
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,739
Well, he blew it.

799
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,282
Jump.

800
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,675
- Mom?
- Yeah.

801
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,595
Hey, Alex.

802
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:17,641
- Mom?
ALEX: I'm your mom.

803
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,810
I am Alex's mom, Mark.

804
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,270
MIKE:
Yeah.

805
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,690
- Your date is here.
- Huh?

806
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,359
- The front door. Your date.
- Okay.

807
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,862
She was nervous. It's creepy, right?

808
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,613
Little bit.

809
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,032
She's so old, it's like...

810
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,869
Dance with all your friend's moms?

811
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,370
MIKE:
Pretty much.

812
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,622
MAN: Oh, hi, Scarlet.
- Hello.

813
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,292
- Wow, you look amazing. Here. Pour vous.
SCARLET: Oh, thank you.

814
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,044
Carnations. What a douche bag.

815
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,463
Mark.

816
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,548
DEAN: No, that's okay.
- I'm sorry.

817
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,757
DEAN:
I'm a single dad.

818
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,553
It's totally normal for sons to
feel weird when their moms date.

819
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,015
I mean, he's stepping into
Dad's shoes, protecting the castle.

820
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,225
- He's not my son, but...
- Oh.

821
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,269
Then that's weird.

822
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,687
- It is.
DEAN: Yeah.

823
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,814
- Uh, do you want to go?
- Yeah.

824
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,399
Let me get my coat.

825
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,401
- Oh, come on.
- Hold these, please.

826
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,903
- This guy?
- You're being rude.

827
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,905
- You're going from Uncle Mike to this guy?
- Shh.

828
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,491
- Be quiet.
- Okay.

829
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,494
- Do me a favor. Shh.
- He's a tool.

830
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,331
Give this to Ned, okay, to give to Mike.
It's our divorce papers.

831
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,751
And remind him that he needs
to be there on the 27th.

832
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,253
Okay? Thank you.

833
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,655
Where are you going?

834
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:56,615
MAGGIE:
Jamie's party.

835
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,411
Alex!

836
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:07,125
ALEX: Yeah, uh, seriously, I can't be here.
I really can't be here.

837
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:10,754
Do you know how many dangerous and
hurtful things Stan could do to me here?

838
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,799
You had your head shoved in a
ball return? It's not a massage.

839
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,718
You're on the basketball team now.
Okay? This is your party.

840
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:19,054
ALEX:
Okay, okay, there she is.

841
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,597
There's Nicole. Oh, God.

842
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,432
- Which one?
ALEX: She's right there.

843
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,434
You're looking at... She's my 3, your 2.

844
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:26,603
- Stop it. You're looking right at her.
- Calm down.

845
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,648
- Sorry.
- What was that?

846
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,984
- Nothing, it was a burp.
- Why are you burping?

847
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,653
- I have tummy issues. What? Get over it.
- Tummy issues?

848
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,905
She's not going to like me. I'm a loser.

849
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:40,117
Why are you a loser?
Because Stan says you're a loser?

850
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:43,161
Do you think Stan's a winner?
Stan's going nowhere.

851
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,748
Any girl in here would be lucky
to have your attention.

852
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:50,335
- What do you know about girls?
- What do I know about girls?

853
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,463
I used to date the
most beautiful girl in school...

854
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,549
...and I let her slip through my fingers.

855
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,676
But I won't let that happen to you.

856
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,428
You're absolutely right.

857
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,264
I'm just going to walk up to her
and introduce myself.

858
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,684
Tomorrow at school. Maybe.
Probably not.

859
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,394
Just go.

860
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,942
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, you came.

861
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,277
- How are you?
- Good.

862
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,030
Thank you, um. Have you seen Maggie?
I've been looking everywhere.

863
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,699
Oh, um, Maggie's not here.

864
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,701
But, um, I am.

865
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,495
And I'm really, really glad you came.

866
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,833
LAUREN: It's her birthday.
- I didn't get you a present, I'm sorry.

867
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,836
- I'll just have to unwrap you.
- Heh, heh. Okay.

868
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:38,634
I was kicked off the cheerleading squad
for being too flexible.

869
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:46,183
Okay, okay. Sit down. Just sit down.

870
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,396
If you girls don't respect yourselves...

871
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:55,275
...then how do you expect
anyone else to respect you?

872
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,693
Right?

873
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:57,903
Don't respect me.

874
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,363
No, don't respect me.

875
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,657
You don't even have to
remember my name.

876
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,909
- Wow, that's slutty.
- First of all, you slut.

877
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:06,328
This is some other dad's problem.

878
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:11,041
And, um, I just want to tell you
that you look like my dog.

879
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:15,712
- Excuse me?
- Your hair looks like my dog's hair.

880
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,256
- Oh, um...
- No, it's shiny and soft.

881
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,717
We give my dog special food.
It's got flax in it.

882
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,761
Oh, flax.

883
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,596
- She's a sweetheart.
- That's sweet.

884
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,181
Well, she died.

885
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,309
So I look like your dead dog?

886
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,604
I'm just really nervous, and I've wanted
to talk to you for so long.

887
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,107
- What am I thinking?
- Don't worry about it. Really.

888
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,567
- Alex?
- Oh, my God, you know my name.

889
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:38,902
You're on fire.

890
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:42,114
- Really?
- Literally, you're on fire.

891
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,365
What?

892
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,033
NICOLE:
Literally on fire.

893
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,954
Whoa. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna
get out of here. Later.

894
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,253
Just hand me those keys right there.

895
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,546
BOY:
They're in for the night.

896
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:03,760
STAN: If the keys are locked in there, I don't
know how I'm going to get you guys out.

897
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:07,264
Conserve some oxygen in there.

898
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,475
Don't scream, you have
a limited amount of oxygen.

899
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:14,396
They're pretty, huh?
We got some pretty ladies in here.

900
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,607
Oh, there you are.

901
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,125
- What do you want?
- I just want to talk about Stan.

902
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,710
Yeah?

903
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,590
Why are you dating him?
I mean, you know he is not a nice guy.

904
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,133
He's crazy.

905
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,011
Hey, don't say that about Stan.
You don't even know him.

906
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,681
Oh, but I do. I really do.
I know him better than you.

907
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,350
Look, we're moving in together
after graduation.

908
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,311
Stan got into Georgetown?

909
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,730
- What?
- What?

910
01:02:56,898 --> 01:03:01,151
No. No. Stan got on the management track
at Home Depot.

911
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,944
Oh, great.

912
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,990
And I'm going to Westwood Community
College to be closer to him.

913
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,534
He's my forever.

914
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,998
- There's no way in hell that's happening.
- Excuse me?

915
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,335
I said, "There's no way in hell
that that is happening."

916
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,922
You think I'm gonna let you mortgage
your future?

917
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,466
You think I'll let you throw away
your hard work...

918
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,843
...everything that you've accomplished...

919
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:29,554
...for some psychopathic guy
who doesn't care about you?

920
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:33,350
I forbid you. I forbid you
to see him anymore.

921
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:38,647
Oh, okay! Who the hell do you think
you are, my father?! Dude!

922
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,149
- Don't walk away from me.
- You're a freak.

923
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,818
Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!

924
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,864
- Hey. How'd it go?
- Fantastic.

925
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,575
What's on your leg?

926
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,453
CHEERLEADERS
We're the Warriors! Yeah, yeah!

927
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,789
MURPHY:
Remember: Defense wins the game.

928
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,834
What's wrong? You look uncomfortable.

929
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,086
Oh. No.

930
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,632
I was just thinking that
the last time I was here...

931
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,134
...my husband asked me to marry him.

932
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,011
Wow.

933
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,347
Tough to compete with that.

934
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:17,143
Down by 6, get the ball to Gold.

935
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,938
Warriors on three. One, two, three.

936
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,606
TEAM:
Warriors!

937
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,364
MURPHY:
Stan, what are you doing? Let's go.

938
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,576
Go, Alex! Whoo!

939
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:33,910
Woo-hoo.

940
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,626
PLAYER 1:
Left side.

941
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,059
PLAYER 2:
Pick off! Right there!

942
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,814
PLAYER 3:
He's got too much time. Come on!

943
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,238
PLAYER 4:
Yeah!

944
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,660
PLAYER 5:
Get it to McKinley! Get it in! Get it!

945
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,329
PLAYER 6:
Get him!

946
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:24,336
Ball!

947
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,171
PLAYER 7:
Come on, outside!

948
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,967
O'Donnell! Give the ball to Gold!
Give the ball to Gold!

949
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,345
No, no, no!

950
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:49,110
We did it! You were great. Oh.
Ooh. I, um...

951
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,738
- I'm sweaty. Um...
- Sorry about that.

952
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,657
Congratula... That was awesome.

953
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:56,660
You did a great...
I saw the... I liked the dance.

954
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:00,997
Yeah, so I think August...
August will be good.

955
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,875
All right, uh, have a good night.

956
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,377
See you tomorrow.

957
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:18,056
Oh. Hi. Wow, what are the odds?

958
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,351
What's it going to be now?
Did you buy me the Statue of Liberty?

959
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,938
I'm just going to ask you out, okay?
Like a grownup.

960
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:26,606
Just two friends having dinner.

961
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:32,028
Then if it turns into anything else,
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

962
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,906
No. Good night.

963
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,701
I'll buy every student a laptop.

964
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:43,039
You would deny the children of laptops?

965
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:46,084
- Miss Masterson, the children.
- Okay. Okay, fine, fine.

966
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,421
Fine. But this is not a date.

967
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:50,755
No, in no way a date.

968
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:54,592
And if I do this, you will stop
the inappropriate behavior and gifts.

969
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,846
- Yes.
- And we'll just drive to this restaurant.

970
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,181
We won't fly there in the space shuttle...

971
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:03,935
...or drive in some gaudy, tacky limo.

972
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,271
No, let's take your car. How about?

973
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,568
This way.

974
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,864
Ned to driver, abort.
Abort, abort. Move it out right now.

975
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:22,412
I totally missed it. She came right up to me,
I should've kissed her. And I froze.

976
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,123
Hey, don't worry.
I'll get you another chance.

977
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,875
How? How are you going to do that?

978
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:34,466
Victory party at my house!

979
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,898
Maggie.

980
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:02,827
Maggie? Hey, Maggie.

981
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,454
Go away.

982
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,040
Hey, what happened?

983
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,375
What do you want?

984
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:12,170
Rub it in my face? Say, "I told you so"?

985
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,923
No. No, I really don't.

986
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,134
Just tell me what happened.

987
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,681
Stan dumped me.

988
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:30,105
Stan dumped you?

989
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,065
Stan dumped you? What?

990
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:35,860
What happened? How did this...?
What did he do?

991
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:37,612
What did he do?

992
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,031
After the game...

993
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:41,991
We...

994
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:45,203
He took me behind the quad, and we...

995
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:48,706
I can't hear this. You didn't.

996
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:51,876
- No, Mags.
- No.

997
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,004
No.

998
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:58,299
That's why he dumped me.

999
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,347
Mags, hey.

1000
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:07,058
Hey, hey, it's okay.

1001
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,895
You know...

1002
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,984
...when you're young, everything feels like
the end of the world.

1003
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:19,946
It's not.

1004
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,906
Right.

1005
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,576
It's just the beginning.

1006
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,663
You might have to meet
a few more jerks...

1007
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,832
...but one day
you're going to meet a boy...

1008
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,002
...who treats you the way
that you deserve to be treated:

1009
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:39,340
Like the sun rises and sets with you.

1010
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,015
You really think so?

1011
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:51,102
I know so.

1012
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,939
That's so sweet.

1013
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,734
You're the sweetest.

1014
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:00,320
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

1015
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,696
- Ow. Oh.
- Thank you.

1016
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:07,702
Anyways, I, uh, came over here...
I was looking for you.

1017
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:11,372
I wanted to invite you to my party.
I don't know if you want to come.

1018
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,458
- Yes. I would love to.
- Yeah.

1019
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,793
- Great. That's exciting.
- Thank you!

1020
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,754
- Aah! Yay!
- Yes. Yay.

1021
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,505
- Thank you.
- That's very exciting.

1022
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:22,300
I know, it's great. Ha, ha.

1023
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,093
See you tonight.

1024
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:33,978
"At Mark's house."

1025
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:57,001
BOY: Hey, that's cool. Let me see that.
That is nice, man.

1026
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:59,254
Don't touch the toys, okay?

1027
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:03,091
ALEX: Yeah, I'll, uh, try not to light myself
on fire tonight.

1028
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,886
- I'll keep a fire extinguisher handy.
ALEX: Oh, good.

1029
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:11,182
- Do you want to sit outside?
- Sure.

1030
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:46,968
That's delightful.

1031
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,516
What? What?

1032
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:59,731
- Okay, I don't know how to act normal.
- Clearly.

1033
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:04,569
It's the story of my life. I'm not smooth.
I'm just trying to impress you, okay?

1034
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:08,156
I'm not the kind of guy who comes
to places like this. I'm a dork.

1035
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,991
The kind of guy who spends 10 grand...

1036
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,744
...on Gandalf the Grey's quarterstaff
from The Two Towers.

1037
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,414
Yes, that does make you a dork.

1038
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,670
Especially since Gandalf the Grey
was only in Fellowship.

1039
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:27,925
He returns in Two Towers
as Gandalf the White.

1040
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,535
STAN:
I was upset. I'm sorry, okay?

1041
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:58,039
I need you to show me that you love me.

1042
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,166
And that way
we can get a place together.

1043
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:03,461
Stop it. Look, whatever.
I'm with somebody else now.

1044
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:07,340
- What?
- Party's over, Stan.

1045
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:09,634
Just get out of here.

1046
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,514
STAN:
Oh, yeah?

1047
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,308
Who's gonna make me leave?

1048
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:19,936
You?

1049
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:23,981
You know I would, but it smells
like you've been drinking...

1050
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:27,068
...so I'm just gonna let the cops do it.

1051
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:33,741
STAN:
You can have the nun.

1052
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,160
She doesn't put out, anyway.

1053
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:37,662
On second thought...

1054
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:45,753
MIKE:
Oh, I just had the craziest dream.

1055
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:49,674
I was 17.

1056
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,637
I was back in high school,
and it was terrible.

1057
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,184
Scar.

1058
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:04,772
Scar? I don't see a scar.

1059
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:08,192
Look, I know why you didn't
want me to be with Stan.

1060
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,987
It's because you wanted me.

1061
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:16,826
You want to play games?
I can play games.

1062
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,412
- No, no, no.
- I'm a hungry lioness...

1063
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,372
...and you're a baby gazelle.

1064
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,209
Maggie! No, no, no,
Maggie, stop this now.

1065
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:28,838
If you only knew how highly inappropriate
and dysfunctional this is.

1066
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:30,548
Stop it. Please stop.

1067
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,384
Maggie, I'm not the person
that you think I am.

1068
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,136
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

1069
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,930
You're right, you're good.
You're not like the others.

1070
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:40,766
I'm not like others.
I'm very different than the others.

1071
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:44,937
So different, in fact, that you and I can
never, ever, ever, ever be together.

1072
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:46,939
- Stop biting.
- Why?

1073
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,652
Oh.

1074
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:55,781
Oh, my God. What are you saying?

1075
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,408
Are you confused?

1076
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,495
I'm very confused, yes.
Extremely confused.

1077
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:04,999
Oh, my God. I... I... I get it now.

1078
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:10,087
And your hair is always perfectly coiffed,
and you have highlights.

1079
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,383
- What are you talking about?
- I mean...

1080
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:17,929
Dude, your jeans are really tight.

1081
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:21,682
I'm not gay.

1082
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,810
I'm in love, Maggie. I'm in love.

1083
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,646
I've been in love.

1084
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:30,858
I've been in love with the same girl
since I was 17, Maggie.

1085
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:37,782
Does she go to our school? Do I know her?
Tell me her name. I want to know her name.

1086
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,076
- No, Maggie. No.
- Okay.

1087
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:46,207
You tell your girlfriend
she better keep a close eye on you.

1088
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,464
Sweet baby Jesus.

1089
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,842
Thanks.

1090
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,529
We'll take the check.

1091
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,709
I'm so dead.

1092
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,381
GIRL:
Excuse me.

1093
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:39,343
- Scarlet? Scarlet? Scarlet.
- Hi.

1094
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,345
- What are you doing here?
- You seen Alex?

1095
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:43,472
He's not picking up his phone.

1096
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,474
Alex is fine. Alex is fine, believe me.

1097
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:47,685
In fact, with the way things are going...

1098
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:51,188
...by the end of the night
Alex could have a girlfriend.

1099
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:54,650
- Alex has a girlfriend?
- Yeah, and she's great. She's cute.

1100
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,402
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Where?

1101
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:59,488
Walk up the stairs. Walk with me
for one sec, I'll show you.

1102
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:02,325
So how ever did you get
the newest version of Halo?

1103
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:04,744
It's not due out for another six months.

1104
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:10,124
Well, let's just say I said some things
to the Make-A-Wish people...

1105
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,418
...that I'm not totally proud of.

1106
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:24,805
I'm going to kill him.

1107
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,324
Everybody, out!

1108
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:51,040
Oh, no, no.
No! No! No! Not Dr. Philsopholis.

1109
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:55,878
This party is over!

1110
01:17:56,046 --> 01:18:01,550
Unless you want to spend the next
three months in detention, leave! Now!

1111
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:06,180
Okay. We better go warn Mark.

1112
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:11,936
SCARLET:
You really care about him, don't you?

1113
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:16,190
- Yeah.
- That's nice. That's really nice.

1114
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:19,110
He really needs a male role model.

1115
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:20,945
- He's a great kid.
- Mm-hm.

1116
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,073
You know, they both are.

1117
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,619
I think you're a great mother.

1118
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,329
Thank you.

1119
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:33,332
He's on the balcony. He's right there.

1120
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:39,296
- Mom?
- This has been a really tough time...

1121
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:42,800
...and you really feel like
part of the family.

1122
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:47,471
You have no idea how amazing
it is to hear you say that.

1123
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:58,816
Scarlet.

1124
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:02,111
Scarlet! Scarlet, I'm not Mark, okay?

1125
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:06,031
- I'm him, I'm me. Scarlet, I'm your husband.
- Will you stop it already?

1126
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:09,493
If you'd listen to me, I am the father
of your children! Scar, let me...

1127
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:12,663
Don't call me that. Don't call me that!

1128
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:15,583
You are a weirdo little man-child!

1129
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,835
Give me two seconds,
and I can explain this!

1130
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,503
You are a pervert!

1131
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:33,601
Get out, and get out, and get out.

1132
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,311
JANE:
You can leave.

1133
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:42,193
Well, this isn't exactly the
inconspicuous relationship I wanted.

1134
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:46,864
I'm sure now you can see why
I don't date my students' parents.

1135
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,201
I'm sorry.

1136
01:19:56,208 --> 01:20:00,878
I'm sorry. I had no idea that it was
going to get so out of control.

1137
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,464
- Hm.
MIKE: Really?

1138
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:11,555
- Now I'm sorry.
- I guess I deserved that.

1139
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,809
The second one was out of line.
It was uncalled for. Sorry.

1140
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:17,228
Are you okay? I'm really sorry.

1141
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:21,899
Three makes it even. Now we're even.

1142
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:25,694
How are you? You okay?

1143
01:20:25,862 --> 01:20:27,196
Yeah.

1144
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:39,458
And finished.

1145
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,254
With the rug area.

1146
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:45,756
But we've made very good progress.

1147
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:47,758
We deserve a break.

1148
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:50,469
I lost my family.

1149
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:52,930
Hey, Mike?

1150
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:56,767
If it's any consolation,
I think you really did help your kids.

1151
01:20:57,143 --> 01:21:00,396
You did your job,
and now the hero can move on.

1152
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:02,606
I don't want to.

1153
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,277
Maybe they don't need me anymore,
but I need them.

1154
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,114
Hey, not to be a buzzkill...

1155
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:11,866
...but you're due in court...

1156
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:14,285
...in 22 minutes.

1157
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,246
Ned, I need more time.

1158
01:21:17,747 --> 01:21:20,249
- I have to stop this.
- To the Nedmobile.

1159
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:22,251
- Wait, Ned, Ned, Ned.
- Yes.

1160
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:26,255
- Pants.
- I should have pants on. Yes.

1161
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,225
NED:
Come on, Glenn!

1162
01:21:38,935 --> 01:21:41,186
He's nothing but
a glorified midget wrangler.

1163
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:43,647
You wouldn't be so big
without that vest!

1164
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:47,359
Grab that thing that's down there.
Grab it. Just hold that up.

1165
01:21:47,527 --> 01:21:49,445
- Where you get this?
- Best 20 ever spent.

1166
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,488
Saves me a half hour on my commute.

1167
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:53,991
Dude, just hold it. Hold it way up.

1168
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:14,887
- The whole truth, nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1169
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:16,347
SCARLET:
I do.

1170
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:18,849
You request a divorce
by the state of California...

1171
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:21,352
...citing irreconcilable differences.
This correct?

1172
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:25,439
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Is Michael O'Donnell present?

1173
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:26,815
No, Your Honor.

1174
01:22:26,983 --> 01:22:30,027
I take his absence as agreement
to the orders of the divorce.

1175
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:37,701
- You are not requesting sole custody?
- No, Your Honor.

1176
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,287
"You can't handle the truth!"

1177
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:42,623
What?

1178
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:46,001
I'm sorry, I panicked. It was the
first thing that came into my mind.

1179
01:22:46,169 --> 01:22:48,796
Your Majesty.

1180
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:51,298
- Who are you?
- That's my husband's best friend.

1181
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,176
You a lawyer, best friend?

1182
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:56,553
- Yes.
- No.

1183
01:22:56,721 --> 01:23:00,057
I believe the law degree
in my pocket says so.

1184
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:04,728
Yes, and it's a little bit smeared
because I sat on it in the car...

1185
01:23:04,896 --> 01:23:08,190
...not because I printed it out recently.

1186
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:14,154
Let's pretend that's real.
Want to explain what you're doing?

1187
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:16,532
We...

1188
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,827
...are stopping a gross...

1189
01:23:21,579 --> 01:23:23,080
...miscarriage ofjustice!

1190
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,290
That...

1191
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:29,044
Okay, if you'd just let me explain.
I can explain this.

1192
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:30,587
If you would just listen...

1193
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:34,633
I've got a letter from Mike O'Donnell,
he's the husband in this case!

1194
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,301
I'm sorry. We're in the middle...

1195
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:39,888
Your Honor, if it's okay,
I'd like to hear the letter, please.

1196
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,231
MIKE:
Thank you, Your Honor.

1197
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:54,153
This is a letter from Mike O'Donnell.

1198
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,280
He wanted me to read it.

1199
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:01,201
"Scarlet...

1200
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:05,247
...before you go through with this...

1201
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:09,710
...I want to remind you
of September 7th, 1988.

1202
01:24:12,088 --> 01:24:13,922
It was the first time that I saw you.

1203
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,552
You were reading Less Than Zero.

1204
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:22,931
You were wearing
a Guns N' Roses T-shirt.

1205
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,978
I'd never seen anything so perfect.

1206
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:34,943
I remember thinking
that I had to have you, or I'd die.

1207
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:39,990
Then you whispered that you loved me...

1208
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,995
...at the homecoming dance.

1209
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,167
And I felt...

1210
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:52,753
...so peaceful...

1211
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,465
...and safe.

1212
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:01,720
Because I knew that no matter
what happened from that day on...

1213
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:04,389
...nothing could ever be that bad.

1214
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:06,975
Because I had you.

1215
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,270
Uh...

1216
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:12,564
And then I grew up...

1217
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:16,026
...and I lost my way.

1218
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:21,615
And I blamed you for my failures.

1219
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:29,039
And I know that you think
you have to do this today.

1220
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:32,876
I don't want you to.

1221
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,383
But I guess...

1222
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:44,721
...if I love you...

1223
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:50,519
...I should let you move on."

1224
01:25:54,732 --> 01:25:56,358
JUDGE:
All right, son, you need to go now.

1225
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:20,382
Let's proceed.

1226
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:25,262
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Would it be okay...

1227
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:28,390
...if we postpone
this for now for just a little while?

1228
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:30,225
Would that be okay?

1229
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:32,895
Postponed 30 days. Next case.

1230
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:01,965
NED: Haven't seen you practice
this hard since school.

1231
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:05,177
Yeah, you know, if I want
to impress these college scouts...

1232
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:07,763
...then I need to stay focused.

1233
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:11,433
Wait, wait. You're not still trying
to get a scholarship, are you?

1234
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:15,979
Be careful, man. You do not want
to get off of the spirit path.

1235
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:20,609
There's no path, Ned! There's no path!
I can't do it!

1236
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,527
I just made it worse for them.

1237
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:27,491
My wife is happier, everyone's happier
with me out of the picture, Ned.

1238
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:29,952
It's time to move on.

1239
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,111
It's time to go, Mom.

1240
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:21,044
Hey, Gold, save something
for the game, huh?

1241
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:23,130
Just warming up, coach.

1242
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,549
Got a little inside info for you.

1243
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:29,261
The scout from Ohio State is back,
and the coach is with him.

1244
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:32,139
You play half the game
I know you're capable of...

1245
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:34,975
...you're going to be playing
college ball next year, huh?

1246
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,144
- That's the plan, coach.
- Give me the ball.

1247
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:43,025
All right, gather up, jockstraps.
Picture time.

1248
01:28:43,192 --> 01:28:45,068
Try not to break the camera.

1249
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:33,950
I can't wait to go to Georgetown
and start dating college boys.

1250
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:42,417
I thought Mark was hanging out
with Alex to get to me, not you.

1251
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:46,004
All right, ladies, let's bring it in.

1252
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:50,801
NED:
Jane! Jane!

1253
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,471
Jane! I'm sorry, sorry.

1254
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,640
JANE: Ned, Ned, Ned.
- Oh, sorry.

1255
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:59,559
JANE: Ned. Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

1256
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:02,938
- I need to talk to you.
- What are you doing?

1257
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:05,107
I practiced this, uh.

1258
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:06,775
Okay.

1259
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:13,448
I have just seen my best friend lose
everything than means anything to him.

1260
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:15,367
And maybe we'll never be there, but...

1261
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:20,330
Yes, I understand, but I have told you
before that I am the principal...

1262
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,958
- Yes.
...and I cannot be seen...

1263
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:24,626
...with my students' parents.

1264
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:28,004
But, Jane,
how can you be seen with me...

1265
01:30:28,172 --> 01:30:30,799
...when I'm wearing
the cloak of invisibility?

1266
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:37,431
Jane, all I'm asking is a chance
for us to be friends.

1267
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:41,435
Because you're the one
I want by my side...

1268
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:44,938
...when I'm storming
the Elvish Castle of Ganakinesh.

1269
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,946
You can plunder my dungeon anytime.

1270
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:55,031
I'll bring my long bow.

1271
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:58,660
TEAM:
Warriors! Yeah!

1272
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,206
Come on.

1273
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,722
Oh, my God.

1274
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,891
MAGGIE:
Mom? Are you okay?

1275
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,520
I can't be here again. I have to go.

1276
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:48,543
SCARLET: The game. That's your future.
MIKE: The baby's my future.

1277
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,714
SCARLET: That's crazy, Mike.
No, I can't let you throw this all away.

1278
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:54,216
Bye, Mike.

1279
01:31:54,383 --> 01:31:55,842
JANITOR: High school star.
Never lived up to potential.

1280
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:58,512
- What are you doing?
MIKE: I want to live in the past.

1281
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:01,723
JANITOR: I'll bet you wish you had it to
do all over again.

1282
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:03,183
Hello?!

1283
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:05,101
NED:
It's a classic transformation story.

1284
01:32:05,978 --> 01:32:08,104
MIKE:
Spirit guide?

1285
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:10,524
You and me, we're in this together.

1286
01:32:13,444 --> 01:32:14,528
It's your turn now.

1287
01:32:22,286 --> 01:32:23,286
Traveling.

1288
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:24,955
Green ball!

1289
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:27,290
O'Donnell, get in there!

1290
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:28,875
Scarlet!

1291
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:31,628
Scar?

1292
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:34,798
Scarlet?

1293
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:54,693
It is you.

1294
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:02,701
MIKE:
Hi.

1295
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:05,620
"Hi"?

1296
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:08,456
I can explain.

1297
01:33:10,459 --> 01:33:11,835
You can?

1298
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:13,920
No, not at all.

1299
01:33:15,506 --> 01:33:19,384
- You didn't have to come after me again.
- Yes, I did, because I love you.

1300
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:23,305
You're the best decision
I ever made, I just forgot.

1301
01:33:24,765 --> 01:33:29,311
And then I fell off a bridge
and things got pretty weird after that.

1302
01:33:29,478 --> 01:33:31,730
But I'm never going to forget again.

1303
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:37,027
Look, I know that I've been
in a bad mood for the last...

1304
01:33:37,653 --> 01:33:39,154
...20 years.

1305
01:33:40,197 --> 01:33:44,659
But if you let me, I swear, I will spend
the rest of my life making it up to you.

1306
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:48,705
I thought I wanted
a second chance at life...

1307
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:52,417
...but now I know I just want
a second chance with y...

1308
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:57,505
Weird.

1309
01:33:57,882 --> 01:33:59,215
Yeah.

1310
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,677
I missed you.

1311
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:14,689
Yeah, I'm gonna put you down
because this was a lot easier before.

1312
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:18,818
Yeah, you did have that six-pack
thing going.

1313
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:20,862
Is there any chance I'll see that again?

1314
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:23,698
I knew you were checking me out.

1315
01:34:26,243 --> 01:34:29,537
Go! Go! Go!

1316
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:34,542
SCARLET:
Adults can have that, though.

1317
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:37,545
MIKE:
Well, I'll work on it. Maybe I'll jog home.

1318
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:46,054
Ned, hey.

1319
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:49,683
I packed up all my stuff and I wanted
to give your key back and say thanks.

1320
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,309
Hey, whoa. No. No.

1321
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:54,854
Wasn't expecting to see
you there, Principal Masterson.

1322
01:34:55,064 --> 01:34:57,148
You look very pretty.

1323
01:34:57,316 --> 01:34:58,358
Thank you.

1324
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,110
The Force is strong in this one.

1325
01:35:00,277 --> 01:35:02,821
So I guess I'll be
seeing you at work, boss.

1326
01:35:02,988 --> 01:35:05,532
Oh, yes, uh, Coach O'Donnell.

1327
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,910
And, um, we are very happy
to have you aboard.

1328
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:12,872
Buddy, I got you a little something
for your first day at your new job.

1329
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,917
Don't think about how much it cost,
it's not much.

1330
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:20,046
Hey, you got me a whistle.

1331
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:22,632
Don't blow it.

1332
01:35:25,344 --> 01:35:26,386
Play big.

1333
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:28,263
You too.

1334
01:35:29,932 --> 01:35:31,641
JANE: Good luck.
NED: Love you!

1335
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,309
MIKE:
Love you!
