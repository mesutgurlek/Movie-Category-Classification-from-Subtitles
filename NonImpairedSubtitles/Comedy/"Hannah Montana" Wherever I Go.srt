2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,790
Oh, look how cute I was.

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,200
Oh, yeah, you were cute, too.

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,000
This is going to look so
adorable at our college dorm.

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,970
Lilly, college is not all
about decorating your room.

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,570
It's about getting an education
and expanding your mind.

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,080
Now, with that being said,
which one of these fake glasses

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,580
makes me look more higherly educated?

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,750
This one? Or... this one?

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,390
Miley, if you're going to be using the
phrase "more higherly educated" at Stanford

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,360
you're gonna need more than
fake glasses to pull it off.

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,500
Oh, Lillian,
you loquacious <i>provocateur.</i>

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,330
Just admit it, I look scary smart.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,840
No, you just look scary scary.

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,310
You really think you're gonna get away
with fake glasses for four years?

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,540
Of course not. The second year
I'll have fake contacts,

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,740
third year, fake laser eye surgery

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,710
and the fourth year I'll probably
have to get one eye redone,

19
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,780
so that'll give me a week
to get a really cute eye patch.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,820
You just always have to
have a secret, don't ya?

21
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,990
And your faithful Hannah
wig isn't even cold yet?

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,120
Shame on you.

23
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,630
Whoa! Who's that intelligent-looking
college girl over there?

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,900
Oh, well, that would be me.

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,270
Your daughter is the pathological liar

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,000
wearing the fake glasses.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,570
Oh, yeah? Says the girl that told Oliver
she never kissed anybody before...

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,710
It made him feel special!

29
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,310
Well, lookie here. Somebody's thoughtful
daddy got them a Stanford sweatshirt.

30
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,050
Thought you might want to wear it tomorrow
when you head up for orientation.

31
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,220
Oh, Dad this is...

32
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,850
...returnable, right?

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,690
What are you talking
about? It's perfect.

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,030
Oh, yeah, if you want me
to look like a shapeless lump.

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,830
If you put the hood up, you
couldn't even tell I'm a girl.

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,700
Like I said, it's perfect.

37
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,070
Now, Lilly, why don't you get yours on.
I'll take a picture of my two college girls.

38
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,500
Or... I could just,
you know, get in there with her.

39
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,670
Oh, yeah? See what happens
the next time

40
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,210
you want to borrow my car up in Stanford.

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,010
Oh, really?
What are you gonna do?

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,080
Hide it in your sweatshirt?

43
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,910
Zing!

44
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,690
- Hello?
- I gotta get outta this thing.

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,190
Like I said, guys, Miley is not interested

46
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,560
in doing any movie right now.

47
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,330
Yeah, I'm going to college, and
no movie's gonna change that.

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, listen, it doesn't matter to
her that Tom Cruise is her costar.

49
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,940
You tell Mr. Spielberg
I said thanks but no thanks.

73
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,510
Miley, are you actually thinking about
calling back and taking this movie?

74
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,040
Of course not.

75
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,880
Why don't I believe you?

76
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,810
Because I'm lying through my
crooked-yet-uniquely-charming teeth.

77
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,920
Come on, Dad. It's Steven
"Phone home" Spielberg.

78
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,250
The greatest director of our time.

79
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,990
OK, all right. Time for that picture of
me and my roomie in her roomy sweatshirt.

80
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,790
See what I did there?
That's college humor.

81
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,060
Here you go. I can't believe
we're gonna do this.

82
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,630
I am so proud of you. I mean,
you gave up this secret,

83
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,400
and you put your entire career on hold
just so we can go to college together.

84
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,770
I mean, who does that?
I don't know if I could do that.

85
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,210
Really?

86
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,610
Yeah, I mean, you're not just
my best friend, you are my hero.

87
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,580
You here that, Mile?
You're her hero.

88
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,780
Take the dang picture, Dad.

89
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
Let me see.

90
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,950
Aw, that's gonna look
so cute in the collage.

91
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,020
I gotta e-mail it to Oliver
because I look cute.

92
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,490
Oh. Yeah, you do, too.

93
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,660
Eh.

94
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,630
Well, bud, looks like you're
in a bit of a pickle.

95
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,430
What do you want me to do? Call
back Spielberg or let it go?

96
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,130
Mile?

97
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,140
I want this part more than
anything else in the world

98
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,870
but if it means disappointing
Lilly, I can't do it.

99
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,610
'Cause I'm her hero.

100
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,580
Unless...

101
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,550
...you insist that I take a year
off of college to do this movie

102
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,990
because, you know, you are my
daddy and... daddies know best.

103
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,050
Honey, I could never tell you
not to go to college.

104
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,260
It's gotta be your decision
and yours alone.

105
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,090
Fine. I'll be a good friend
and go to college with Lilly.

106
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,300
You know, the closer I get to
18, the more useless you become.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,340
Honey, as long as you wear this
boy-repellent sweatshirt I got you,

108
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,710
you can call me any names you want to.

Wow. Who's this from?

113
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,660
Hope the script and the muffin

114
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,560
"PS, this card will
self-destruct in five seconds."

115
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,100

119
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,910
They clutter up my pier,
they block my customers...

120
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,980
Parents are always asking you if
you need help finding your mommy.

121
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,150
That's funny. And you know
what's funnier, my new policy.

122
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,020
No shirt, no shoes...

123
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,790
...no Jackson.

124
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,130
I don't have time for your petty
little games, you petty little man.

125
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
I have a job to get to.

126
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
You have a job?
Doing what?

127
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,970
Stewart...

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,470
...you're up.

129
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,810
Oh, no, you're doing kids' parties now?

130
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,280
Do they string you up like a piñata and
smack you until you spit out candy?

131
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,550
No, I don't spit out candy.

132
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,420
I spit out knowledge.

133
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,790
It's my job to educate and enlighten

134
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,060
the youngsters of today about their place

135
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,230
in the glorious ecosystem
that is our Earth.

136
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,070
This is my friend Cuddles.

137
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,010
He's a Burmese python, one of the
six largest snakes in the wwrld.

138
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,210
Where you goin' there, buddy?

139
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,750
This isn't what we rehearsed.

140
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,320
Uh, some snakes use venom
to paralyze their prey.

141
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,390
Others simply squeeze the life out of them,

142
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,590
as Cuddles is so playfully
demonstrating now.

143
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,330
Kids, don't try this at home.

144
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,160
Oh, look at the pretty stars.

145
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,370
This is the best birthday party ever.

146
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,480
Jackson, why are you putting
yourself through this?

147
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,350
There's gotta be better jobs out
there than professional snake snack.

148
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,790
You think I haven't tried?

149
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,260
I've been looking for a job for weeks.

150
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,830
I even carry around my resume
in hopes that one of the parents

151
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,360
at these stupid parties has
a job opening in their company.

152
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,570
No wonder you're not getting
a job. This resume's a mess.

153
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,070
Is that snake urine?

154
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,300
Yes.

155
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,570
Look, man, I need the money.

156
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,040
Siena is always buying me
these great gifts,

157
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,280
and I never have any cash
to get anything for her.

158
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,380
And now her birthday's coming up, and I
just wanna get her something as nice

159
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,720
as the dual time zone, solid gold,

160
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,250
Gushenflagen watch she got
me for my birthday.

161
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,260
I mean, check this thing out, it's...

162
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,290
Jackson, is this yours?

163
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,460
I picked it out of Cuddles's vomit.

164
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,670
Yeah, thanks.

165
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,610
Hey, honey, what's up?

166
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,780
Just wondering what time it is.

167
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,980
Well, let me check my beautiful watch,

168
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,950
given to me by my even
more beautiful girlfriend.

169
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,720
It's...

170
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,390
...2:20.

171
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,090
Just four more hours until
I can get out of this bikini,

172
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,290
change into some comfy sweats
and come over to see you.

173
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,500
Or if you're running late you can
just come over in the b-b-b-bikini.

174
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,740
- You're so f-f-f-funny.
- OK, we'll see you after work.

175
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,940
OK, bye.

176
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,680
You know, Jackson,
if you need a job that bad,

177
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,980
you can come back and work for me.

178
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,980
No! Ahh!

179
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,450
You know I may have bruised ribs
and a watch covered in...

180
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,520
...bits o' dead mouse...

181
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,420
...but I still have my pride.

182
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,490
All right.
Ready to box the kangaroo?

183
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,660
I believe the question is,

184
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,030
is the kangaroo ready to box me?

185
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,030
They're always brave at first.

186
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,140
Oh, you're gonna need this.

187
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,170
She fights dirty.

188
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,140
Of course she does.

189
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,350
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh ♪</i>

190
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,520
Oh, mud crunkies, I can't
believe how good this is.

191
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,790
I know.

192
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,390
The chocolate chip
is incredible. Mmm!

193
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,460
I meant the script.
It's perfect for me.

194
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,630
How would you know?
You barely cracked the cover.

195
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,000
It's about a girl from Alabama who goes
to Paris as a Foreign Exchange student

196
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,530
and is recruited by the CIA to pose
as the daughter of an oil tycoon

197
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,670
to stop a plot
to bring down the World Bank.

198
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,740
So basically I'm a Southern girl
with a double identity.

199
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,640
I think I can handle that.

200
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,180
You just gonna forget about
college and Lilly?

201
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,380
One minute. You couldn't
let me enjoy it for one minute.

202
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,890
- Mile...
- I've got an idea.

203
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,720
Why don't I just, you know,
take off college for a year.

204
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,720
And Lilly?

205
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,330
Could you be a bigger buzzkill?

206
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,900
Miley, you gotta tell her what's goin' on.

207
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,370
I know. But do you think once I tell
her the truth, she'll understand?

208
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,100
Either way, she deserves to know the truth.

209
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,870
And Mr. Buzzkill strikes again.

210
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,650
Can I please tell you
again how excited I am

211
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,650
that we are going to college together?

212
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,820
You don't have to say that.
You don't, really.

213
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,690
You don't!

214
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,590
No I do, because I just got
off the phone with Jeannie,

215
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,690
who's at our college orientation
at North Carolina

216
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,790
and she just found out that she's
rooming with a germophobic, insomniac

217
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,600
with a sinus condition,
who walks around all night

218
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,300
in, like, little crinkly sanitary booties,

219
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,270
going, "Nyah!" "Nyah!"

220
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,270
Nightmare!

221
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,910
Well, yeah, you can think of it
like that or you can think of it

222
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,510
as Jeannie growing as a more
tolerant and compassionate person,

223
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,380
which could very well be the most valuable
lesson that she learns in college.

224
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,520
Yeah, I mean, I guess
I can look at it that way.

225
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,990
But I don't have to
because I got you... roomie.

226
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,120
Yeah, uh...

227
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,990
Look, Lilly, I'm no big deal,
really. I'm not.

228
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,100
Really.

229
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,330
Yeah, well, you are to me.

230
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,970
Look, I never told you this but
I was kinda nervous

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,110
that you were never really
gonna go to college with me.

232
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,240
That a world tour or one
of those stupid movie offers

233
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,480
was gonna come up and it would
be too hard for you to resist,

234
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,250
and you would just bail.
But you didn't.

235
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,950
And I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

236
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,260
And I can't tell you what hearing
you say that means to me.

237
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,960
Really, I can't.

238
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,030

240
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Now listen, son. I went to bed at
2:ooam and your sister was still up

241
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,680
trying to figure out this Lilly situation.

242
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,510
So play nice. I don't want
you beating her up.

243
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,320
Yeah, nice to see you're so
worried about her being beat up.

244
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,290
Where were you when Candy the kangaroo
was using my face for a punching bag?

245
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,960
You're telling me you got
whooped by a girl kangaroo?

246
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,330
It wasn't my fault. Apparently, I look
a lot like her ex-boyfriend, Bobo.

247
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,370
Well, do me a favor, son.

248
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,310
Try to be less you and more not you.

249
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,240
She gonna be in a foul mood.

250
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Morning, family!

251
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,980
Oh, yeah. She's devastated.

252
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,120
You are still going to
orientation, aren't you?

253
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,820
- Yup. - So you decided on
college instead of the movie?

254
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,260
- Nope. - But you're still
going to orientation.

255
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,990
- Yep.
- You haven't told Lilly yet.

256
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,690
- Nope.
- Lord, I smell a plan.

257
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,830
Daddy, I'm no longer in high school.

258
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,300
I no longer solve my problems
with some silly high jinks.

259
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,570
See, I create a sequence of logical
actions that, when executed properly,

260
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,340
lead you to the desired result.

261
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,010
So in other words...
a plan.

262
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,840
Yes, a plan.

263
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,650
But a plan so brilliant,

264
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,080
that when it came to me
at 4:37 in the morning,

265
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,420
- it was a gift from the gods.
- Let me guess.

266
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,020
Since Lilly thinks it's gonna be
hard to go to college without you,

267
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,660
you're gonna show her it's even
harder to go to college with you.

268
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,360
Oh, come on, son. She's been up all night.
Surely she's got something smarter than that.

269
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,830

Oh, no, actually I always

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,590
Once I go in there, they're
gonna recognize and mob me.

307
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,390
And then you're gonna get pushed
aside and only be known as

308
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,890
"that blonde chick with Miley"
for the next four years.

309
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,360
It's not gonna be that bad.
This isn't high school any more.

310
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,130
Like that makes a difference.

311
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,700
You seem to forget, I'm world famous.

312
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,340
We're here for the orientation weekend.

313
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,140
This is Lilly Truscott
and I'm Miley Stewart.

314
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,440
Miley Stewart!

315
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,780
See? Look, nobody mobbed you.
Thanks. Come on.

316
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,450
Here it comes.

317
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,650
Sorry to bother you.
Do you have a pen?

318
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,490
Who do you want me to make it out to?

319
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,660
Oh, no. I just need to write my
roommate's phone number down.

320
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,060
Thanks.

321
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,270
See? She didn't care who you
were. College kids are awesome.

322
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,970
What have I been saying this entire drive?

323
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,700
This is going to be the best
four years of our lives.

324
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,470
Take a pack.

325
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,340
<i>♪ Oh, ho ♪</i>

326
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,010
<i>♪ Wow, wow ♪</i>

327
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,250
<i>♪ Hey, hey ♪</i>

328
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,350
My girlfriend is totally
gonna love this necklace.

329
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,360
Now just make sure that
nobody else picks this horse

330
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,590
until I bring her over.

331
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,330
What if she wants the bunny?
Girls love bunnies.

332
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,800
Well, this one loves horses.

333
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,700
Why doesn't she like bunnies?

334
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,800
- Why do you care?
- I don't know. I just do.

335
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,970
Just guard the horse.

336
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,310
Fine, but you're taking
the joy out of what coulda been

337
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,940
a lovely, romantic moment for all of us.

338
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,380
I'll survive.

339
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,120
So, what's today's "get rich slow" scheme?

340
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,450
Gonna put the clown suit on
and let a monkey slap you silly?

341
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,660
It was an orangutan, and afterwards, we
shared a banana and hugged it out, so...

342
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,890
Look, bottom line is, I may have
humiliated myself the last few weeks...

343
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,630
Years.

344
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,700
Sorry, keep going.

345
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,040
But, I finally made enough
money to buy Siena that.

346
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,670
A stuffed horse?

347
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,410
Wouldn't she prefer the bunny?
Girls love bunnies.

348
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,980
That's what I said.

349
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,880
She likes horses!

350
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,820
And I'm talking about the necklace,

351
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,550
which totally makes us even for the watch.

352
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,020
Gifts are supposed to be
about love, not getting even.

353
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,230
You're such a child.

354
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,760
Oh, back off.
Here she comes.

355
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,130
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

356
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,530
I'm starving, let's...
What happened to your eye?

357
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,370
Oh, um, a little old lady...

358
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,910
Big scary mugger...
I took care of it.

359
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,910
Anywho, uh, before we go,

360
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,110
I won all these tickets.

361
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,180
If only I had a special birthday
girl to give them to.

362
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,720
Aw, Jackson, you're so sweet.
I know just what I want.

363
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,790
- Oh, you do? Do you?
- Mm-hmm.

364
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,230
- I want the bunny.
- What?

365
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,930
- We saw that coming.
- Pound it.

366
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,200
What about the
horse? See how cute he is?

367
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,570
He's blue and he's cute.
And... He's blue.

368
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,240
He is cute, but I want the bunny.

369
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,910
- OK, I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.

370
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,950
- I'll get it.
- I will get it!

371
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,950
Just... wanna make sure
it doesn't have any bugs.

372
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,460
Oh, looking good.

373
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,230
All clean. Here we go.

374
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,030
You know, you're right, the horse is cuter.
I'll take the horse.

375
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:48,570
- OK. - But, you can
leave the necklace.

376
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,780
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, I love it.

377
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,680
And you know where I can't wait to wear it?

378
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,650
- Where?
- In your brand-new...

379
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,750
...car!

380
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,660
Happy six-month
anniversary, baby!

381
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,590
- You got me a... a car!
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,830
Break out the clown suit, brother.

383
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,830
You got work to do.

384
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,570
<i>♪ La di di da da ♪</i>

385
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,200
<i>♪ Oh, yeah ♪</i>

386
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,570
Yeah, Oliver, the campus tour
was so awesome.

387
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,340
It's so beautiful here.
Oh, and the best part?

388
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,710
Nobody even noticed that Miley was Miley.

389
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,950
Uh-huh. It was like,
"Hannah Montana? Eh!

390
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,050
Miley Stewart? Eh!"

391
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,850
He gets it.
Your dad got it.

392
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,590
Your mom got it.
Move on!

393
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,290
Yeah, she's just having
a little trouble adjusting.

394
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,530
I can't fit all my clothes in here.

395
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,900
A Muppet couldn't fit
their clothes in here.

396
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,330
Yeah, but she's just
gonna have to deal with it!

397
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,240
So anyway, this weekend we get to
spend the night in the same room

398
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,840
that in two weeks is gonna
be ours for a whole year.

399
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,170
A year? In this shoebox?

400
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,040
It looked way bigger in the brochure.

401
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,710
That is false advertisement.

402
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,880
I gotta go. Yeah.

403
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,650
Yeah, high maintenance Miley is back.

404
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,690
I can't breathe in here.
Can you breathe in here? I can't breathe.

405
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,220
OK, look, Miley.
You have got to calm down, OK?

406
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,360
If it bothers you that much,
just open the window.

407
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,690
- OK.
- OK.

408
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,060
Oh, sweet pea! It won't open!

409
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,170
I need to get outta here!

410
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,870
Miley, are you gonna be like this all year?

411
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,370
What'd you say? I can't
hear you with all the racket!

412
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,970
What racket?

413
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,380
Yo! 24-hour part-ay people.
Can you have a little consideration?

414
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,780
- Sorry, we...
- Cut the attitude!

415
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,450
Miley!

416
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,090
I'm sorry! Look, she's not
normally like this!

417
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,690
You have got to get a grip, OK?
Everything is going to be fine.

418
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,090
We're here together,
and nothing is gonna ruin that.

419
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,100
Hi, hi!

420
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,700
Oh, no.

421
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,540
- Guess who lives next door?
- I know! I know! We do!

422
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,670
If you weren't rich, I'd totally dump you.

423
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,710
What are you guys doing here?

424
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,040
Just sticking tight with our Malibu crew.

425
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,380
And since we always
loved you in high school...

426
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,950
You hated us in high school.

427
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,320
True. But that was only because
we didn't know Miley was famous.

428
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,780
- And now that we do...
- We love you!

429
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,550
Ooh, ooh.

430
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,420
I thought you guys gave that up
when you realized it was lame.

431
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,560
If I gave up everything I thought was lame,

432
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,390
I wouldn't be hanging out with her.

433
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,360
Good one!

434
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,470
Oh! Hey, look, cute college
guys by the vending machine.

435
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,840
- Ooh, where?
- Bye, now.

436
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,610
Oh, my gosh, Lilly.
You know what I just realized?

437
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,280
As long as I'm here, they're
never gonna leave us alone.

438
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,650
You know what that means. The only way you're
really gonna enjoy Stanford is if I leave.

439
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,420
What are you talking about?

440
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,490
I mean, you never let Amber
and Ashley bother you before,

441
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,190
why don't we just deal with them

442
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,960
like we always do and just ignore them?

443
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,190
Yeah, but that's not fair to you.

444
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,430
So, I guess I'll just
have to take a year off.

445
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,000
You know, go do some big Hollywood
budget movie or something.

446
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,970
'Cause that's how much
I love you. My best friend.

447
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,410
- What was that?
- What was what?

448
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,680
That hug. That wasn't your, "I'm your best
friend and I'll do anything for you" hug.

449
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,610
That was your, "I feel guilty, and I'm
trying to get out of something" hug.

450
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,250
No it wasn't. See?

451
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,990
Yeah! You patted my back!

452
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,490
You only pat my back when you feel guilty.

453
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,930
That's not true! That wasn't
a pat. That was a rub. See?

454
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,800
A rub!
With a hint of a pat.

455
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,460
A little bit of both. You know,
a pat-rub. I call it a "pub."

456
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,900
Yeah, well I call it a lie.

457
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,540
What's going on?

458
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,540
I'm gonna go do a Steven
Spielberg movie with Tom Cruise

459
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,810
that shoots in Europe for a year.

460
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,870
What?

461
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,980
I'm gonna go do a Steven Spielberg...

462
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,150
Yeah, I heard you!

463
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,380
I can't believe this.

464
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,550
Now I'm the one who can't breathe in here.

465
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,090
Lilly, wait. Please!

466
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,460
Lilly, please wait.

467
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,130
Look, I know that you're mad at me.

468
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,930
And we've been dreaming
about college forever,

469
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,630
and now you think I'm being
selfish and bailing on you.

470
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,970
You are!

471
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,670
True.

472
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,900
But you haven't read the script.

473
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,480
Lilly, please, I know that
this is a dream of ours, but...

474
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,050
...this is a dream of mine, too.

475
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,750
- How can I pass it up?
- You can't pass it up!

476
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,420
It's Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg!

477
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,690
- So you understand?
- Of course I do.

478
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,960
But what I don't understand
is that after six years,

479
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,930
you don't know me well enough
to know that, yeah,

480
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,860
I would be really mad at you, but
then I'd be really happy for you.

481
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,700
I just didn't want to go
through the really mad part.

482
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,770
Yeah? Well, guess what?
You got it anyway.

483
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,930
As for the happy part?
Don't hold your breath.

484
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,900
Lilly, I didn't know what else to do!

485
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,510
So you thought you'd do
anything you could to make me

486
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,170
not want to go to college with you?

487
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,840
Well, congratulations.
You got your wish.

488
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,510
You're the last person I would
want to go to college with.

489
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,280
No, you're the last person

490
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,420
that I would want to go anywhere with!

Hey, Jackson! I've been
thinking about your proble

516
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,100
and I found a couple of jobs
you might be good for.

517
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,770
At a cat hospital, cleaning up poop.

518
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,240
At a dog hospital, cleaning up poop.

519
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,540
Or if working with animals is beneath you,

520
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,980
there's one at a daycare center,
cleaning up...

521
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,680
I get it! I get it! All right?
It's very amusing.

522
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,720
But I was just getting ready
to apply for a job that's...

523
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,890
...way more humiliating
than any of those.

524
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,660
Thank you for dining at Rico's.

525
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,100
Hey-oh.

526
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,300
And I thought the days of you
working for me were gone forever.

527
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,910
But I guess the old saying is true.

528
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,910
"If you love something, set it free.

529
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,610
And if it comes back,
it was meant to be."

530
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,820
Curse my Latin emotions.

531
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,420
Hey, honey. Your dad
said you were down here.

532
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,360
It is such a beautiful day,
let's take a ride in your car.

533
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,430
I can't. I'm working.

534
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,600
At Rico's?

535
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,600
But you hate him.

536
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:45,500
You called him a pus-filled sore
on the devil's hairy butt.

537
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,570
No offense.

538
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,540
None taken.

539
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,540
Look, I don't have a choice.
I have to work here.

540
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,680
Not all of us can be pop stars,
or supermodels,

541
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,120
or evil multimillionaires.

542
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,650
Some of us are just regular people,

543
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,550
and we have to take regular jobs,

544
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,560
because we can barely afford
regular presents,

545
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,860
even though we buy them
at police evidence auctions.

546
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,070
Oh, no, don't worry.
I have a signed affidavit

547
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,600
saying nobody got whacked while wearing it.

552
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,250
She's in there packing right
now. You've got to help me.

553
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,120
What do you mean "no?"

554
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,880
Why are you on her side?

555
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,020
Oh, Oliver.
Soulmate, shmoulmate.

556
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,460
This is real life. This ain't
some Nicholas Sparks novel.

557
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,990
Oliver? Hello?
Oh, you are gutless.

558
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,600
Oy! I hate my life.

559
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,540
Your sequence of logical actions
didn't achieve their desired results?

560
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,570
Your sequence of logical actions
didn't achieve their desired...

561
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,010
You're not doing the mimic thing.

562
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,110
We always do the mimic thing.

563
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,410
What's the point?

564
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,510
Oh, wow. Siena dumped you, huh?

565
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,080
Worse. She bought me a car.

566
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,760
And that's a problem?

567
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,690
How hard did that kangaroo hit you?

568
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,460
Look, you don't get it,
my girlfriend has a career,

569
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,530
and the only jobs I can get
are either working for Rico

570
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,770
or letting exotic animals
beat and squeeze the snot...

571
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,440
...and other liquids out of me.

572
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,970
I'm gonna pretend you're
talking about a water bottle

573
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,570
- in your pocket and move on.
- If only.

574
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,910
Well, at least your job doesn't make you
choose between an opportunity of a lifetime

575
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,980
- and your best friend.
- Hey, that's the price you pay

576
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,320
for being so ridiculously talented.

577
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:48,260
OK, first no mimic fight
and now a compliment?

578
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,630
Seriously, Jackson, how hard
did that kangaroo hit you?

579
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,630
Look, I know that things
are bad right now with Lilly,

580
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,830
but trust me, the way my life is going

581
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,230
I would so rather be you than me.

582
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,940
Oh, don't worry, Jackson.
You'll get a real job.

583
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,910
Someday.

584
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,710
You've got a lot to offer.

585
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,710
- Like what?
- I don't know,

586
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,480
but whatever it is, you've
definitely got a boatload of it.

587
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,150
And one day someone will give you a job

588
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:19,420
that's worthy of your...
as yet undiscovered talents.

589
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,590
"As yet undiscovered talents.
As yet undiscovered talents!"

590
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,560
Seriously, now?

591
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,860
Sorry, I was just starting
to feel close to you,

592
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,430
and it was creeping me out.

593
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,730
But... thanks.

594
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,700
And... don't worry.

595
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,110
I'm sure you and Lilly
are gonna figure this out.

596
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,840
I can't imagine you guys
not being best friends.

597
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,110
I don't know, Jackson.
I really messed up.

598
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,510
I've never seen her so mad.

599
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,580
And it didn't help at all when you
asked her to go to Paris with you?

600
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,020
I didn't ask her.

601
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:55,420
You ask her to go tours, concerts.

602
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,060
You don't even go to the bathroom without
asking her if she wants to come along.

603
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,030
Hey! All girls do that.

604
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,560
You never know when you're gonna
need to borrow a lipstick, or a...

605
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,530
...toilet paper.

606
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,740
And Lilly carries three-ply
with aloe. I'm gonna miss that.

607
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,940
Seriously, men and women...

608
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,250
Same species, worlds apart.

609
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,380
Jackson, look, Lilly
does not want to go to Paris.

610
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,850
I mean, she really wants to go to college.

611
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,990
If she wanted to go to Paris she
would've started dropping hints

612
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,120
the minute I told her about it.

613
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
- Oh, no.
- What?

614
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,330
She started dropping hints
the minute I told her about it.

615
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,460
You're the last person I would
want to go to college with.

616
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,400
No, you're the last person I
would want to go anywhere with.

617
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,810
That was a hint?

618
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,580
Yeah. She said,
"go anywhere with."

619
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,480
She coulda stopped at college,
but no, she added "anywhere."

620
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,550
Which means Paris, the place
I didn't ask her to go.

621
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,120
And why would she hint at Paris,
if she didn't want to go.

622
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,520
All right, let me try to think like a girl.

623
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,230
No, still don't get it.

624
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,900
Maybe you're right. When Lilly's fishing for
something, she adds a "Pff" at the end.

625
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,530
Oh, no.

626
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,710
You go away to Paris to do a stupid
movie, and you can't even speak French?

627
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,110
Pff.

628
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,580
Pff.

629
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,810
Pff.

630
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:28,620
See? She did a "pff," but it was
delayed. It was a delayed "pff."

631
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,850
A delayed "pff?"

632
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,890
Yes, a delayed "pff."
That's why I didn't see it.

633
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,690
Jackson, you're right. I gotta
go talk to her.

634
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,360
- Thank you. You're a genius.
- You're welcome.

635
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,530
I don't know what I did.
But you're welcome.

636
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,370
I don't wanna know why.
I don't wanna know how.

637
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,370
I just wanna enjoy this moment
for as long as it lasts.

638
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,980
Much bettfr.

639
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:01,920
Now it's time for the stupid collage
of stupid times with stupid Miley...

640
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:05,020
Oh, hey, that was that time we went
pumpkin carving. That was really fun.

641
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,120
No it wasn't!

642
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,320
Lilly?

643
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,160
I know the real reason you're mad at me.

644
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Oh, really? What was your
first clue, when I told you?

645
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,900
No. I said "the real reason"
little miss "pff."

646
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,010
- What?
- I may have given you the pat,

647
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,110
but you gave me the "pff."
And I know why.

648
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,980
It's 'cause I didn't ask you
to go to Paris with me.

649
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,310
Well, it sure took you long enough.

650
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,850
Hey, it was a delayed "pff."

651
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,380
I had a delayed reaction.
You're being a little unfair.

652
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,250
I'm being unfair? First you
lie to me about the movie,

653
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,160
and then you don't even
want me to come with you?

654
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,290
Look, Lilly, of course
I want you to go with me.

655
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,590
It's just... I didn't ask

656
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,260
'cause I know how much
college means to you.

657
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,570
- Really?
- Yeah.

658
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,630
Well, you could've at least asked.

659
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,400
Is it too late?

660
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,170
Try me.

661
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,110
Lilly, do you want to go to Paris with me?

662
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,180
No.

663
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,850
No? Why'd you
make me ask you?

664
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,590
Because I needed to hear it.

665
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:14,390
I need to know that this friendship
means as much to you as it does to me.

666
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,230
And I can't put off college.

667
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,060
Why not, Lilly? Come on,
picture it. Think about it.

668
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,900
When we're in Europe. I mean,
all the culture and the history,

669
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:26,070
and the language. It'll be an educational
experience that is <i>fantastique.</i>

670
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,270
That's "fantastic" in French.

671
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,040
- Miley, come on.
- No, I'm serious.

672
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,670
Think about it, next year,
in class, when they're talking

673
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,480
about the Golden Arches of Triumph,

674
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,550
we'll have actually been there.

675
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,780
It's the <i>Arc de Triomphe.</i> <i>It's not
someplace you drive</i> <i>through to get fries.</i>

676
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,720
French fries. Hey.

677
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,320
Come on, Lilly. Not only will it
be an amazing learning experience,

678
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,730
but you'll be around
Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg.

679
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,130
"Yo, Tommy! Stevie! Can't have lunch
with you today but try me tomorrow!"

680
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,570
That'll be you.

681
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Well...

682
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,170
Come on, your folks'll be cool with it.

683
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,340
I don't know! I mean,
I always thought,

684
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,480
you know, you go to high school
and then you go to college

685
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,640
but I guess people do take time off.

686
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,510
And an opportunity like this, I
mean, it is kind of <i>fantastique.</i>

687
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,750
Do you really want me to go with you?

688
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,450
More than anything.

689
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,460
Well, then, how can I say no?

690
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,490
- We're going to Paris!
- Paris, France!

691
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,830
Yay!

692
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,860
I can't wait to go see the Awful Tower!

693
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,930
Kidding.

694
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,630
<i>♪ Hey, oh, oh ♪</i>

695
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,070
<i>Today on</i> Real
Geniuses, <i>Albert Einstein.</i>

696
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,540

698
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,280
Twenty-six. That means
I got plenty of time.

699
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,250
Of course I had the IQ of 160.

700
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,320
What's yours?

701
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,860
Get out!

702
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,630
Hey, Jackson.

703
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,940
Dude, it's bad enough
that I have to work for you.

704
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:12,270
I don't need the reek
of your Rico-ness in my house.

705
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,740
I'm only here because, well, I
though about what you said and...

706
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,480
...and you're right.

707
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,610
That you're the result of a botched
Chihuahua cloning experiment?

708
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,780
- No. - That you can get a full
workout in a hamster wheel?

709
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,650
- No... - That you can fit
your entire body inside...

710
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,220
Jackson!

711
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,620
You're fired.

712
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,690
What? Just because
I insulted you?

713
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,830
That's our thing.
That's what makes us us.

714
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,400
No, I firing you because
until you get a real job,

715
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,670
you're never going to
feel good about yourself.

716
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,640
Which should make you feel terrific.

717
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,240
I know!
But I don't!

718
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
It's weird, right?

719
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,080
Maybe it's because I'm leaving for
college, and all of a sudden...

720
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,720
...I'm worried about you?

721
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,690
Yeah.

722
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,060
And I'm worried about hitting my head on the top
of the doorframe every time I leave a room.

723
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,960
Jackson, I'm not joking.

724
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,800
I'm h...

725
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,070
...helping you.

726
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,310
Here. I called in a favor
and I got you a great job.

727
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,840
What?

728
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,710
Well, I thought about
your marketable skills.

729
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,450
And then when I realized you
didn't have any, I dug deeper.

730
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,720
And then it hit me. You have
the attention span of a gnat,

731
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,420
the tiny, little hands
of a six-year-old boy.

732
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,560
And you can sit on the couch
longer than anyone I've ever met.

733
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,890
A videogame tester?

734
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,190
You'll evaluate new games,

735
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,600
give input on software design
and playability,

736
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,930
with the opportunity to move up

737
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,930
into game creation and development.

738
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,640
OK, you start on Monday.

739
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,370
I can't believe you'd do this for me.

740
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,240
Neither can I.

741
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,710
But I guess when I look
underneath my disgust,

742
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,820
disdain and utter lack of respect for you.

743
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,220
You're my best fr...

744
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,890
Fr... Fr... Fr...

745
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,520
Fr...

746
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,760
Fr...

747
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,890
Frien...

748
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,260
It's OK.
You don't have to say it.

749
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,570
Oh, thank you.

750
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,540
And Rico, you're my fr...

751
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,670
Frien...

752
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,780
This where you say, I don't
actually have to say it.

753
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,550
Yeah, but I actually want
to hear you say it. So...

754
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,620
You're my friend, too.

755
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,790
Oh, now you've gone and done it.

756
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,600
OK.

757
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,040
- Back to normal on three?
- Yeah. One, two...

758
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,450
- Backwards bubble head!
- Bird-faced freak!

759
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,650
And wait till you see your new office.

760
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,020
New office?

761
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,060
Turbo boost acceleration lag in turn three.

762
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,470
Uh, spotty pixilation
on the vehicle undercarriage.

763
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,310
And come on, graphics division,

764
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,870
when an alien's head explodes,

765
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,980
let's not skimp on the brain
chunks and the eye goo.

766
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,710
Could you get that over to corporate, Gina?

767
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,980
Yes, Mr. Stewart.

768
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,650
She called me Mr. Stewart.

769
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,990
Tough day at work, dear?

770
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,360
- Oh, just brutal.
- Mm-hmm.

771
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,760
First my lower back jet went out, and
now my swim trunks are riding up.

772
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,400
Mm-hmm. Oh, and you
worked through it?

773
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,630
I am so proud of you.

774
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,870
That's just the kind of man I am.

775
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,300
Come on, Jackson.
We've been packing all day.

776
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,470
Yeah, and you said you'd be
outta your "office" by five.

777
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,140
Hey, some of us take our jobs seriously.

778
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,510
Now get out of here.

779
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,480
I have a deadline, and
I'm working through dinner.

780
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,320
Then why is Siena here?

781
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,550
Oh, I brought dinner.

782
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,490
Who likes shrimp?

783
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,790
Obviously you do.

784
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,260
And he's in the hot tub.

785
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,100
- He's in the hot tub.
- He's in the hot tub.

786
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,860
- He's in the hot tub.
- He's in the hot tub.

787
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,700
- He's in the hot tub!
- He's in the hot tub!

788
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,610
That was kinda mean.

789
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,180
Nope, that's just us.

790

Window.

00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,860
Uh, man with hat.

796
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,670
Oh, pregnant woman.

797
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,040
What'd she just say?

798
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,250
She liked my hat.

799
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,750
I reckon she wasn't even pregnant.

800
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,480
No.

801
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,350
I cannot believe that by tomorrow night

802
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,290
we're gonna be in a cute,
little Parisian cafe

803
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,990
and you'll be offending
French people in France.

804
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,990
I know.

805
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,560
- Lilly.
- Oliver?

806
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,270
Oliver! Hey, I thought your band
was playing in San Antonio.

807
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,070
We were, but our next show's in Seattle.

808
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,400
And I got a flight that stopped here.

809
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,270
I wasn't gonna let you leave
without saying goodbye.

810
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,270
- Ahem!
- You, too, Miley.

811
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,910
I'll leave you kids to say your goodbyes.

812
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:53,010
I'm gonna go buy some of that
dried fruit for the flight.

813
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,750
I love to toot one out
and then watch the rich folks

814
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,850
all blame it on each other.

815
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,390
That's been you?

816
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,620
Honey, you should know my toots by now.

817
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,400
- Hey, Miley.
- Jesse!

818
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,330
Jesse, I thought you were in Seattle.

819
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,770
I was.
Our next show is in San Antonio,

820
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,540
so I got a flight that stopped here.

821
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,370
I can't let you leave
without saying goodbye.

822
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,510
Real original.

823
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,210
Dude, why the hostility?

824
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,180
Well, it's just that I made
a huge romantic gesture,

825
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:27,980
and your doing the same thing kinda
makes it a little less special.

826
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,720
Oliver, it's not a competition.

827
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,390
Oh, I know.

828
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,420
Other than I had to be up at
4:30 in the morning

829
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,460
just to make this happen.

830
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,660
And now you just sound desperate.

831
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,000
Hey, Miley.
I made something for you.

832
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,600
What is it?

833
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,270
It is a playlist of songs
that remind me of you.

834
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,640
Oh...

835
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,970
- It's cute.
- Uh, hey, Lilly.

836
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,410
- Yeah?
- I got you something.

837
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,810
Used lip balm.

838
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,450
Uh, it has my kisses all over it.

839
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,350
- Oh!
- What's up, dude?

840
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,120
Really?

841
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:06,620
OK, guys. We only have a little
while with our boyfriends,

842
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,020
so let's not waste the time with you
guys fighting over your girlfriends,

843
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,330
like a really cute gladiator and...

844
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,430
- ...Oliver.
- Hey!

845
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,630
I'll have you know plenty
of girls on tour find me...

846
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,870
What? They find you what?

847
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,040
Incredibly...
faithful to you.

848
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,370
That's my guy.

849
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,070
OK, so we're gonna leave you two

850
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,740
to do your kissy-mushy
thing over here

851
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,680
and we'll go do ours by the
inflatable neck-pillow cart. Bye.

852
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,350
Man! I can't believe
you're going to Paris.

853
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,480
I know. It's all
happening so fast.

854
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,590
I've been cramming
to learn French all week,

855
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,620
but, you know, I do think I have
the most important phrase down.

856
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,630
"Back off, I have a big, strong
boyfriend back in America?"

857
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,200
Uh, close. It's, um...

858
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,270
I love you too, Lilly.

859
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,510
Oh, well, I gotta get to my flight.

860
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,380
Tell Miley I said good luck
on the movie, OK?

861
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,390
- OK.
- Call me as soon as you land.

862
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,220
Uh-huh.

863
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,860
Oh, Lil, look. Those girls
are going to Stanford.

864
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,530
That'll be you and Miley next year.

865
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,860
Yeah.

866
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,800
Unless she books another
blockbuster movie or something.

867
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,170
Yeah.

868
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,870
- I miss you already.
- Bye.

Miley, Paris and Spielberg and Cruise...

It's all incredible,
and it's like a dream come true.

890
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,590
Then what's the problem?

891
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,830
Well, the problem is it's your dream.

892
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:00,200
My dream is college.
It's always been college.

893
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,870
But we talked about this, remember?

894
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,540
Just wait this year and then
we'll go to college together.

895
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:05,810
No. You don't know that.

896
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,480

Exactly. See, you don't know.

901

And that's fine because it's your life.
