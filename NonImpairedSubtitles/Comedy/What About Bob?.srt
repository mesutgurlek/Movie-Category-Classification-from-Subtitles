1
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:59,404

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,340
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

3
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:30,443
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

4
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:34,347
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

5
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:39,057
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

6
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,248
Good Morning Gil.

7
00:01:56,255 --> 00:01:59,255
I said ... Good Morning Gil.

8
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,163
I gotta go to work

9
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:04,566

10
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:27,198
Wish Me Luck Gil !

11
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,189
Doctor, It's your wife on the phone

12
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,840
Thank you Claire.

13
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:25,563
Fay, Are you sitting down ?

14
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:29,167
My Publisher thinks it's gonna happen

15
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,879
Ya, he thinks Good Morning America is coming to lake 

16
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:35,089
Pinasetoki next week to interview me.

17
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:38,795
It's a tremendous shock in the arm for my book.

18
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:41,792
Ye.. No! It's very unsual..

19
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:44,387
Well I think they did visit doctor Rooth once but, other than that ...

20
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,590
Hold on a second honey.

21
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:47,588
Yes.

22
00:03:47,797 --> 00:03:50,797
Excuse me doctor, but there is doctor Godswell on the phone.

23
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:53,598
Thank You.

24
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:55,903
Fay, I have to go, just another collegue on the phone.

25
00:03:56,105 --> 00:04:00,105
Wow, it's rude to come out to the real work when you're famous

26
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:01,809
Good bye there.

27
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:03,019
Godswell !

28
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:06,313
Leo ! Long time no see huh !

29
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,413
You've got a big book out !

30
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,121
Things are really clikin' huh ?

31
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,327
That's the way I planned it !

32
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:18,426
Listen Leo, I'm quitting my practice for a while, I'm leaving town.

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I have one patient I'd like to refer to you.

34
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:27,841
Exactly what kind of case is it Godswell ? He's not psycothic is he ?

35
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:30,747
No ! No ...nothing like that ! 

36
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:32,846
Listen, his name is Bob Willey

37
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:36,031
He pays early, he comes on time.

38
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:38,134
He just  needs someone brilliant.

39
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,545
I know you don't like flatery but, 

40
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:45,959
If there's anyone I know who could win a Nobel Prize, it's you.

41
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:51,252
Well...I suppose I could find an hour for him sometime after labour day

42
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:54,164
Okay ! I'll work him in for an interview

43
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:57,468
Hey Godswell , huh , how come you're leaving town ?

44
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,900
We're a dying breed Leo, Good Luck !

45
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:05,076
Free !

46
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:09,787
Claire, If a Bob Willey calls, schedule him for a short interview

47
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,394
right after I get back from my vacation

48
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,192
He's already called Dr Marvin, twice, he's your next apointment.

49
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:20,217
Hmm , That's persistence.

50
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,103
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

51
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:28,885
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

52
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:31,994
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful

53
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,698
I feel good.

54
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:49,237

00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,641

60
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:06,241
Hum, Why don't you sit down, it will be a few minutes.

61
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:19,273
Dr Marvin, Bob Willey.

62
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,583
Thank You.

63
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,577
Thank you for working me Doctor.

64
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,779
Should I call you Dr Marvin or Leo ?

65
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,179
Which ever you like.

66
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:34,287
Call me Bob.

67
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,289
Is that your family ?

68
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:36,990
Yes.

69
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:40,495
Oh wait, let me guess, I'm very good at this!

70
00:07:40,698 --> 00:07:42,198
Err, That's Harriet...

71
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500

And Rita.

74
00:07:48,614 --> 00:07:50,114
Eh wait, wait a second,

75
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:51,311
Cecilia,

76
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,732

00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:02,245
This is my son Sigmund

80
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:03,146
And my wife Fay

81
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,458
And my daughter Anna

82
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:05,956
And that's my sister Lily

83
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:08,762
Lily ? I was close.

84
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:11,367
It's a beautiful family.

85
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,880
Thank You.

86
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:15,283
Have a seat.

87
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:33,904
Why don't I start ?

88
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:37,212
The simplest way to put it,

89
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,618
I have problems.

90
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
I worry about diseases,so,

91
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:48,323
I have trouble touching things,

92
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:52,831
In public places it's almost impossible.

93
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:56,986
I have a real big problem moving.

94
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,540
Talk about moving.

95
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:05,353
As long as I'm in my apartment, I'm ok.

96
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:11,772
But when I go out, I get WEIRED !

97
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:13,961
Talk about weired.

98
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:15,263
Talk about weired.

99
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:18,867
Well, I get desease spams, ellosia,

100
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,479
Cold sweats, 

101
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,982
Hot Sweats,

102
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:28,782
fiber blestures,

103
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:29,685
difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing,

104
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:33,691
Bird Vision,involntary tremble

105
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:38,196
Dead ends, nom lips,

106
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:41,107
Finger nails sensitivity,

107
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:43,313
Pelvis discomfort,

108
00:09:44,614 --> 00:09:48,114
So the real question is, what is the crisis ?

109
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:52,116
What is that you're trully affraid of ..

110
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:55,423
What if my heart stops beating ?

111
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:59,236
What if ... I'm looking for a bathroom , I can't find it...

112
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:03,242
and my bladder exploses...

113
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:07,652
Do you ever heard of thread syndrom ?

114
00:10:08,953 --> 00:10:10,953
Involontary shouting profanity..

115
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:14,353
It's exceptionnaly rare ...

116
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:16,858
SHUT IT SON OF A BITCH ! 

117
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:18,665
BASTARD ! 

118
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:25,074
Why exactly are you doing this ?

119
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:30,402
If I fake it, then I don't have it !

120
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:35,089
You know it's the same with the cardiac arrest.

121
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:47,698
Are you married ?

122
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:50,411
I'm divorced.

123
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:52,812
Would you like to talk about that ?

124
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:56,417
There are two types of people in this world.

125
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:57,319
Those who like Neil Daemon

126
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,719
and those who don't.

127
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:01,631
My ex-wife loves him.

128
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:05,127
I see,

129
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:07,137
So, what you're saying is 

130
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:10,435
that even you are an almost paralyzed, 

131
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:14,547
multi-phobic personality that he's in a constant state of panic,

132
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:16,557
your wife did not leave you, you left her,

133
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:18,456
because she liked Neil Daemon

134
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:24,166
No, you're saying that maybe,

135
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,467
maybe I didn't leave her because she likes Neil Daemon,

136
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:30,167
but maybe, she left me ?

137
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:32,373
Yes.

138
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:38,074
Oh Oh Oh Oh ....

139
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:45,542
Dr Marvin, 

140
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:49,844
You can help me, for the first time in my life,

141
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,643
I feel like there's hope !

142
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:57,449
I feel like I can be somebody.

143
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,761
Bob, there's an old saying, 

144
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:06,662
that's the best psychiatric in the world,

145
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,068
is the one right inside of you.

146
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:10,374
Yeah...

147
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:11,877
I can help you, yes.

148
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:14,182
Thank you.

149
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,581
Bob, there is a ground-breaking new book, that has just come out, 

150
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:27,097
Now, I have writed this book, of course it applies to you, but,

151
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:30,601
I'm sure that you can see

152
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
when you see the title, 

153
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:36,112
exactly how it could help.

154
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,622
Baby Steps ?

155
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:41,926
It means setting small reasonnable goals for yourself

156
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,500
one day at a time.

157
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,259
On tiny step at a time

158
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:46,863
Baby steps

159
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:47,068


160
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:51,372
For Instance, hum...

161
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,471
When you leave this office,

162
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:55,266
don't think about everything you have to do 

163
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,179
in order to get out of the building,

164
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:00,175
just think to what you must do to 

165
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:01,577
get out of this room,

166
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:03,701
and when you get to the hall,

167
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,603
deal with that hall,

168
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,919

00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,362
Yes this is Bob Willey, I'm a patient of Dr Marvin,

217
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,167
I have to speak with him right away, it's urgent...

218
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:54,277
I'm sorry Mr Willey, But Dr Marvin's out...

219
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:56,584
It's Bob and you are ?

Betty

221
00:15:57,287 --> 00:15:58,287
Betty, Hi !

222
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,671
Bob, Dr Marvin's out of town, and Dr Armand is taking his cause, 

223
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:06,104
I know that Betty, 

224
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:08,207
It's just the expense of confusion, 

225
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,916
I was supposed to call Dr Marvin, 

226
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,192
but I've lost his phone number.

227
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:14,398
Bob, I can't give out that number.

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I know that Betty, 

229
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:19,405
But you could call him on the other line, 

230
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:22,825
and tell him that I'm on hold on the other line, could you please ?

231
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Thanks Betty please ...

235
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:49,116

236
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:51,334
Dr Marvin, this is Betty at your exchange,

237
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:53,436
I'm sorry to disturb you but,

00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,348
Betty you know better than that ...

241
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:01,047
Dr Armand is covering for me

242
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:02,057
I told him that Doctor,

243
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,458
but he lost your number and then it was urgent.

244
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:07,449
All right, put him through

245
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:09,448

246
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:12,284

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
Bob ...

252
00:17:22,812 --> 00:17:24,312
I thought I made it clearly, 

253
00:17:24,516 --> 00:17:26,016
I'm on vacation, 

254
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:27,823
Well I know,

255
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:29,628
but I'm just worst as usual this time, really bad.

256
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:31,613
Bob, if this is really an emergency, 

257
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:33,014
go to the ER.

258
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:34,821
And if it isn't call Dr Armand, 

259
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:36,319
I'm sure he can help you.

260
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,322
Well I'd just feel so much so much better

261
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,025

264
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,140
But, can't we just talk ?

265
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:45,245
Yes we can,

266
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:46,849
In my office after labour day !

267
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:49,455
After your bathroom fire all huh ?

268
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,057
Good Bye Bob.

269
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:53,159
You want to keep me not to yourself ?

270
00:17:53,457 --> 00:17:55,457
Good Bye Bob !

271
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:59,063
Is this a fake hang up ?

272
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:02,574
It's a fake hang up !

273
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,600
I'll get the phone, I'll get the phone

274
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:15,919
Allo ?

275
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:17,013
Doctor, It's Betty again,

276
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:19,237
I have an urgent call from your sister

277
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,334
My sister ? 

278
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Put her through

279
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Go ahead.

280
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:30,304
It's not you, it's me.

281
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,211
Lily ? What's wrong ?

282
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:38,613
Dr Marvin, please don't be hangry, this is Bob.

283
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,319
I know that I shouldn't be calling..

284
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:42,225
Bob, the doctor patient relationship is based 

285
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,324
on trust, and when you call me pretenting to be my sister,

286
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:46,033
I can't trust you anymore.

287
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:49,035
Go to the ER, please, do not call me here again!

288
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:54,071
No no no no...

289
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,071
That was not smart !

290
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:57,576
That was not smart !

291
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:05,787
Who is it ?

292
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:09,087
Detective Robertson, from homicide, I have some questions about a Bob Willey.

293
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:11,894
What ?

294
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:14,502
That was the Bob who kept calling Dr Marvin.

295
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:20,109
That was that Bob who kept calling.

296
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:24,816
Unfortunately, Bob comitted suicide about 15 minutes ago.

297
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,031
Oh my God!

298
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:29,355
That's terrible !

299
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:30,256
Very sad, It should never happend

300
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:31,954
A very sweet guy, 

301
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,260
but he did leave a note however

302
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:36,766
mentionning a Betty

303
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:37,672
She's Betty.

304
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,468
I'm Betty.

305
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:39,964
Oh.

306
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:42,269
So you're Betty.

307
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:44,369
Oh, Bob called here trying to reach his psychiatric

308
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,984
Oh, well where is he ?

309
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,088
 I may ask him some questions too.

310
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:52,986
Dr Marvin is on vacation in New Hampshire.

311
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:55,195
New Hampshire!

312
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:57,512
I can get it on the phone for you.

313
00:19:58,317 --> 00:19:59,317
Good.

314
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:00,622
No! don't !

315
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:04,318
If I really need to, I'll send some NHPD to drop by.

316
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:06,928
Err, but, 

317
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:12,236
what if I wanted to write him a letter... would you have a mailing adress or some kind up there ?

318
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:14,126
Oh, sure !

319
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:19,043
That's PO BOX 14

329
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:06,619
Thank you for calling Betty.

330
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:11,331
It was the service.

331
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:15,017
That patient who called before,

332
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:17,822

340
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:52,515

341
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:53,917
Baby Steps ..

00:21:54,635 --> 00:21:56,635
You think you can do it today Bob ?

343
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:58,643
What a busy schedule ...

344
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:09,054
Baby Steps in the bus ...

345
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:12,957
Baby Steps in the halley...

346
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:14,764
Baby Steps in the halley...

347
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:16,268
Baby Steps...

348
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:17,965
And seat.

349
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:21,574
Hello !

350
00:22:21,284 --> 00:22:22,284
I'm Bob, 

351
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:25,084
Would you knock me out please ? Just a hit in the face...

352
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:38,267
Do we have enough to feed the entire film creature ?

353
00:22:38,163 --> 00:22:40,163
Honey, we have enough to feed the entire network !

354
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:44,065
Oh Great! Another vacation that is not a vacation...

355
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,070
Why do I have to dress up for this stupid show ?

356
00:22:46,774 --> 00:22:49,274
You mean, you already tryied on everything you own !

357
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:50,376
I have not !

358
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:53,729
All right ! All right ! Oh My Gosh !

359
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:58,207
It will probably be a short interview anyway,

360
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,208
just me and the family 

361
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:01,098
my book.

362
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:09,196
Easy fellows, we're almost there !

363
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,315
False alarm.

364
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:51,967
Dr Marvin !

365
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,970
Dr Leo Marvin !

366
00:23:54,973 --> 00:23:56,473
Doctor 

367
00:23:56,494 --> 00:23:57,994
Marvin !

368
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,207
Thank You !

369
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
- Bye Doctor !
- Thanks Again

370
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:07,792
Isn't someone calling you ?

371
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,698
Right over there !

372
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,201
Oh My God !

373
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:16,206
Doctor 

374
00:24:16,211 --> 00:24:18,211
Leo

375
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:19,518
Leo, do you know that man ?

376
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:20,623
Get in the car !

377
00:24:20,718 --> 00:24:21,718
Come on ! Hurry !

378
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:22,717
Hurry , Hurry !

379
00:24:23,022 --> 00:24:24,522
Doctor Marvin !

380
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,724
Ohhhhh I really appreciate this !

381
00:24:27,631 --> 00:24:29,631
Everyone in the car ! Come on !

382
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,135
Doctor Marvin...

383
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,739
This is a bad time ?

384
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:43,857
The fam' !

385
00:24:55,976 --> 00:24:57,276
- Who's that ?
- I don't know ...

386
00:24:58,775 --> 00:25:00,775
What are you doing here ?

387
00:25:00,985 --> 00:25:02,485
I thought you were dead !

388
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,780
Oh well, 

389
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:06,091
I felt a little bit,

390
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:07,488
but don't be mad at me...

391
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:11,896
Bob, your behaviour is completely inapropriate,

392
00:25:11,898 --> 00:25:12,898
You're hangry...

393
00:25:12,706 --> 00:25:14,006
No, No, I don't get hangry...

394
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,100
So you're upset...

395
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:17,005
I don't get upset!

396
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,510
Well let's have a little talk...

397
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:21,508
Bob, I do not see patients on vacation, ever !

398
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:24,113
How many ways can I make that clear ?

399
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Now, what I would like you to do 

400
00:25:25,518 --> 00:25:27,018
is to get on this bus, 

401
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,750
and go back to New York.

402
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,250
I can't ! I'm totally paralized !

403
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:31,131
I'm all locked up !

404
00:25:31,134 --> 00:25:32,134
You got yourself here !

405
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,531
Barrely...

406
00:25:34,337 --> 00:25:35,337
Well getting back to the therapeutic !

407
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:37,142
Could we just have a little talk ?

408
00:25:37,237 --> 00:25:38,237
Bob ! You are testing my patience !

409
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,245
Come on ! I come so far !

410
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:42,271
- Bob !
- Baby Steps...
- I'm doing the work !

411
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,876
Baby Steps! And I'm not a slacker !

412
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:46,979
Check it out ! I'm in a really bad shape !

413
00:25:47,376 --> 00:25:48,376
Come on please !

414
00:25:49,084 --> 00:25:52,084
Gimme,Gimme,Gimme, I need, I need, I need !

415
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:52,365


416
00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:57,672
Ok ok ok ! All right ! All right !

417
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,580
All right, it's 2 o'clock 

418
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:02,103
go to the bus station, buy yourself a ticket home

419
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,380
and then wait for me at that coffee shop.

420
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:05,982
You'll meet me ?

421
00:26:06,492 --> 00:26:07,492
I'll call you !

422
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:08,991
In 2 hours...

423
00:26:10,593 --> 00:26:12,593
Oh my God! You're the greatest !

424
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:14,901
No no no... just you have to promess me that

425
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,900
you will buy your ticket and go home !

426
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Absolutely !

427
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:20,307
I'll do it right now!

428
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,014
All right, I'll call you at 4 o'clock..

429
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:27,131
You could possibly make it 3:30 could you ?

430
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,030
Bob !

431
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:28,921
4 ! 4 okay ! 

432
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:31,725
Exactly 4 o'clock ! It's better. Okay 

433
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:34,629
Thank you Dr M. !

434
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:43,961
Baby Steps to 4 o'clock...

435
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:47,173
Baby Steps to 4 o'clock...

436
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:51,094
Baby Steps to 4 o'clock...

437
00:26:56,688 --> 00:26:57,688
Oh my Gosh !

438
00:26:58,091 --> 00:26:59,091
I need a bowl !

439
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,890
- What ?
- I need a bow, he's been locked in for abour 8 hours !

440
00:27:02,395 --> 00:27:03,395
he's about to scream.

441
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:04,695
he's furious.

442
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:09,411
Sorry Gil. Little Negligence on my part,

443
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:12,207
here you go, come on tight fellow

444
00:27:12,415 --> 00:27:15,415
Ohhh, it was a long ride wasn't it ? I know, I need a scratch...

445
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,221
Hey No ! No ! No !

446
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:22,121
I'm expecting a phone call !

447
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,130
Thank You.

448
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:26,232
Thanks a lot! Thanks everybody, I really appreciate it!

449
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,836
Also, 

450
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:29,138
If I ...

451
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:31,543
loose consciousness or black out or 

452
00:27:32,244 --> 00:27:33,244
something explodes, 

453
00:27:33,644 --> 00:27:35,144
whould you tell Dr Marvin when he calls 

454
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:37,152
Doctor Leo Marvin ?

455
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:39,153
Do you know him ?

456
00:27:39,672 --> 00:27:40,672
Yeah !

457
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,580
He bought our dream house !

458
00:27:43,073 --> 00:27:45,073
It's a lifetime to save for downpaiment 

459
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:47,475
He sew down with a bag full of money,

460
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:50,181
and grab the tab for unders.

461
00:27:50,184 --> 00:27:52,184
Son of a bitch !

462
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:54,389
She never says that.

463
00:27:54,603 --> 00:27:56,603
Stay as far away from him as possible!

464
00:27:57,513 --> 00:27:58,513
Well that will be easy !

465
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:01,613
He don't see me, that's why I'm expecting a phone call.

466
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,414
He won't see you...

467
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,617
Well, 

468
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:08,821
We'll show you where he lives !

469
00:28:09,418 --> 00:28:10,418
You will ?

470
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:12,219
The son of a bitch !

471
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:14,229
She never says that !

472
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,420
Siggy, I have the whole house to fix,

473
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:17,225
all the art to hang, 

474
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:19,531
I have no idea whenever I will be on the TV show,

475
00:28:20,135 --> 00:28:22,635
but I've stopped everything in order to teach you how to dive.

476
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:24,942
This is as important for me to see you dive

477
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:27,141
as it is for me to appear on Good Morning America.

478
00:28:27,347 --> 00:28:28,847
Oh man ! This is really pressure.

479
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:30,645
Come on take off your rode

480
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:34,355
Why are you always wearing black ?

481
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:37,452
What is it with you and the death mecanization ?

482
00:28:37,163 --> 00:28:39,163
Maybe I'm morring from my lost childhood

483
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:43,267
All right, come on turn around !

484
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:46,372
Close to the edge, that's it!
Remember what we did last year.

485
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:47,574
One, Two Three Spread.

486
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,679
Now bend up the knees, bend your waist, hands out, step on the board.

487
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:51,185
One, Two , Three..

488
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:52,283
Spread !

489
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:55,089
One

490
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:56,086
Two

491
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Three

492
00:29:00,502 --> 00:29:01,502
Spread

493
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:05,601
Spread

494
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,711
Summerfall, time to go dad!

495
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:10,109
I don't understand...

496
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,315
why won't you dive ?

497
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:14,936
From all the horror in this world, what difference does it make ?

498
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,450
Hi Lily !
I'm just calling to remind you about Leo surprise party.

499
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:26,145
Thursday night 7 o'clock.
ok ?

500
00:29:28,156 --> 00:29:30,156
Well, it will be after his interview so he should be relaxed,

501
00:29:31,754 --> 00:29:32,754
oh, wait a minute.

502
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,958
Oh Yes! Of course I'm thrilled Lily, 

503
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:42,259
the last person interviwed on vacation
was Dcotor Rooth.

504
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:46,667
Here he comes, Thursday night 7 o'clock, don't forget ok ? Bye bye

505
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:57,301
He didn't dive ?

506
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
No ...

507
00:29:58,902 --> 00:30:00,902
Oh come on sweetie, he's just a little bit affraid of it!

508
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:02,695
The patience...

509
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:05,294
No, it's not like I wanted him to jump from an airplane...

510
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:08,798
When i was growing up, I thought diving was fun !

511
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:11,106
I thought you were born grown up daddy !

512
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Yes, I'd like the number to the godlam's coffee...

513
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:27,434
What are you doing here ?

514
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:28,535
I'm sorry, don't be mad,

515
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,244
the goldams brought me

516
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:31,645
Thank you Mr and Mrs G. !

517
00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:33,448
You're welcome Bobby !

518
00:30:33,442 --> 00:30:35,442
Hello Doctor Marvin !

519
00:30:35,848 --> 00:30:37,348
The house looks good !

520
00:30:37,554 --> 00:30:39,054
Burn in hell Dr Marvin !

521
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Bob, we agreed I would call you !

522
00:30:46,864 --> 00:30:49,364
Coming here is unbelievably inapropriate !

523
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:51,769
Dad, can I ...

524
00:30:52,073 --> 00:30:53,073
Oh, I'm sorry 

525
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:54,877

526
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,790

527
00:30:57,703 --> 00:30:58,703
Hi bob !

528
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,199
Nice to meet you Bob !

529
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,399
Hi ! I'm Bob !

530
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:03,099
I'm Fay.

531
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:05,704
Oh Mrs M. you are even

532
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:08,793
prettier than your picture !

533
00:31:08,797 --> 00:31:10,797
and younger !

534
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,203
Thank you !

535
00:31:13,008 --> 00:31:14,508
Fay, Anna, Would you please excuse us ?

536
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:17,307
I think Bob and I have something to talk about.

537
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:19,013
Really ?

538
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,519
You think so too ?

539
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,125
Let's take a walk !

540
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,624
-Oh Bob, could I get your fish ?
- Oh yes, thank you!

541
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:30,234
he's already been in a bowl otherwise.

542
00:31:32,243 --> 00:31:33,743
This is a great place !

543
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,143
No wonder why the goldam want it !

544
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:40,169
I'm sorry about bargging you like this !

545
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:42,579
That's all right !
I understand.

546
00:31:43,188 --> 00:31:45,688
The problems don't go away just because I go.

547
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,760
Bob, I'd like you to ... take a long look around you 

548
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:55,378
what is everything you see here have in common ?

549
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:04,693
Vacation Bob !

550
00:32:06,197 --> 00:32:07,197
Vacation.

551
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:08,399
Now, 

552
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:11,807
I can't Bob, at this time, give you the kind of therapy

553
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:12,915
to contension you need to solve all your problems

554
00:32:13,107 --> 00:32:14,107
and you know why...

555
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:17,106
you're on vacation !

556
00:32:17,114 --> 00:32:18,114
Exactly !

557
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:19,313
What I can do, 

558
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:21,233
is, this.

559
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,640
Don't give me pills ! I already have plenty !

560
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:27,221
This is not pills !

561
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:31,633
Read It !

562
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:34,237
It says, 

563
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:36,138
Take a vacation

564
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,050
from my problems.

565
00:32:39,548 --> 00:32:41,548
Give you a persmission to take a vacation
from your problems !

566
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:43,756
Not a vacation from your work, 

567
00:32:43,757 --> 00:32:45,257
not a vacation from daily life,

568
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:46,655
but a vacation 

569
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:48,261
from my problems.

570
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,359
Exactly !

571
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,069
And now I want you to get on that bus

572
00:32:51,364 --> 00:32:52,364
and go back to New York.

573
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:53,669
But ! 

574
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,772
Every single time a problem arises, 

575
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:58,078
I want you to take that prescription out

576
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:01,776
and follow it to the letter, Doctor's orders.

577
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,589
I see you in New York, in my office

578
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,890
in one month !

579
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:08,594
This is incredible !

580
00:33:08,997 --> 00:33:10,997
This is a step on me !

581
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:14,304
For the first time since ever, I feel free !

582
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:16,509
You gave me a great gift Doctor !

583
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,911
The gift of life !

584
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:21,913
You're a great man !

585
00:33:26,628 --> 00:33:28,628
I knew coming right here was the right thing to do...

586
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:31,245
It feels right because you are here

587
00:33:31,463 --> 00:33:33,463
and it feels right because you're leaving.

588
00:33:36,455 --> 00:33:39,455
- Have a great vacation !
- You too Bob !

589
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:43,659
The vacation from my problems !

590
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,567
You bet I will !

591
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:51,777
Here you go !

592
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,083
Baby Steps.

593
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:06,395
Is everything all right honey ?

594
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:08,596
- Yes, everything is perfectly fine.
- he seemed pleasant enough

595
00:34:10,003 --> 00:34:11,003
When he's controlled

596
00:34:15,006 --> 00:34:17,006
I got so excited I forgot to bring you with me !

597
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,800
Gil...

598
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,808
Oh! The Fish !

599
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:29,425
Wow, that's a very nice likes of you.

600
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:30,829

Bye bye Bob!

604
00:34:34,535 --> 00:34:35,535
Bye bye !

605
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:38,644
You've got to be Sigmund ?

606
00:34:38,548 --> 00:34:39,548
Yes, this is Sigmund and

607
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:40,546

608
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:41,349
and Bob was just leaving.

609
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:42,447
Hi !

610
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,550
Oh, this is Gil my fish Sigmund.

611
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:47,357
Did you get him on the lake ?

612
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:48,767
No, he's a sitty fish.

613
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:50,168
Cool.

614

615
00:34:54,684 --> 00:34:56,684
You father is the most incredible psychiatrist,

616
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:58,486
I sincerely hope you appreciate him.

617
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,297
Have a great vacation family !

618
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:02,694

621
00:35:07,193 --> 00:35:08,193

622
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,304
Well, he's different.

623
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:30,349
Or ...

624
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,160
This.

625
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:52,559
I told you, I like the riffle, I think it's a symbol
of virility.

626
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,273
Now can I eat breakfast, I'm supposed to go sailing
on George's boat.

627
00:35:56,771 --> 00:35:58,771
Wait , Wait !

628
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,583
Fay, I need your opinion, riffle or us ? 

629
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:05,179
I think both are wonderful sweetie !

630
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:08,988
hmm Fay !

631
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:11,493
You know I can't live with that kind of answers !

632
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:13,704
I need feedback !

633
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:25,317
Good morning Doctor Marvin !

634
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:28,427
No ! These aren't for you !
They're for Fay !

635
00:36:29,425 --> 00:36:30,425
For yesterday, 

636
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:31,726
for your hospitality

637
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,833
to Gil and me.
I didn't say thank you.

638
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,930
I thought about what you said !

639
00:36:35,934 --> 00:36:37,934
Take a vacation from my problems, 

640
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,140
and I did ! 

641
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,239
But you're back !

642
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:42,542
No I'm not !

643
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:43,747
You're not ?

644
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,648
No I'm not !

645
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:46,649
I'm on vacation !

646
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:50,554
This isn't an apointment, I'm dropping by !

647
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:52,758
This is my first time over the lake !

648
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:54,167
This is my first time...

649
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,667
anywhere !

650
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:58,965
Well I'm anxious cause I'm not able to get food yet,

651
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:01,192
but I'm staying at the goldman's and I told them what you said,
They insisted.

652
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:04,277
No no no no no! 

653
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,579
I know it can't work.
But let's get the friendship going.

654
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:09,689
See you later !

655
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:11,288
It seems thats he's staying, doesn't it ?

656
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,896
Hey, Paper Boy, this was on the couch.

657
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:17,297
Thank you.

658

00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:36,631
Why ?

663
00:37:36,437 --> 00:37:39,937
- Why ??
- Sweet heart, aren't you over-reacting just a little bit ?

664
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:41,038
Good we found an agreeement, 

665
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:42,643
Family conference is over.

666

The vacation from my problems

667
00:37:51,264 --> 00:37:53,264
There is nobody here.

668
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:54,769
There's nothing to fear.

669
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,673
There is nobody here.

670
00:37:56,979 --> 00:37:58,479
I will be alone

671
00:37:59,303 --> 00:38:00,803
I'm all by myself.

672
00:38:04,112 --> 00:38:05,612
There is nobody here.

673
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:26,209
Hi Bob !

674
00:38:26,214 --> 00:38:27,714
- Hi!
- Where are you going ?

675
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:28,938
Just going to town.

676
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:32,542
- Buy some kleenex.
- Well you want a ride ?

677
00:38:33,524 --> 00:38:35,024
I'd love one.

678
00:38:40,137 --> 00:38:41,637
Do a lot of people use this car ?

679
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:43,364
Just us.

680
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:01,267
So, how's it like to be the daughter of a brilliant analyst ?

681
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
When he's in the next bedroom at night when you need him, is it great ?

682
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,580
Hmm No ... It's not great.

683
00:39:11,593 --> 00:39:13,593
I have problems, the same as anyone else.

684
00:39:14,091 --> 00:39:15,591
The same as you.

685
00:39:15,796 --> 00:39:17,296
You're affraid your bladder explode ?

686
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:21,102
What other ones are the same ?
Like what ? Like what ?

687
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,710
Well like analyzing everything !

688
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:24,911
to death, to see what I'm feeling is normal.

689
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:26,213
Yes, I have it !

690
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:32,509
Do you freeze up and, turn into wood when you're around a good looking guy

691
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
you don't even know if he likes you or not!

692
00:39:34,626 --> 00:39:36,126
Well, not a guy, but yes I freeze.

693
00:39:36,526 --> 00:39:39,526
You know, I treat people, 
as if they were telephones,

694
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,500
If I meet somebody I think doesn't likes me I say I'm Bob,
this one is temporarely out of order.

695
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:48,239
you know, don't break the connection,
just hang up and try again!

696
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:50,351
Does it work ?

697
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:52,047
It seems to be !

698
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:53,549
I'm on vacation at lake winnipesaukee !

699
00:39:54,676 --> 00:39:55,676
All right ?

700
00:39:56,684 --> 00:39:59,684
Do you want to come sailing on  
my friend George's boat ?

701
00:40:00,986 --> 00:40:02,986
ohhh no...

702
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:04,476
That's ok, you don't have to.

703
00:40:04,574 --> 00:40:06,574
No, I'd love to ! 

704
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,281
It sounds great !

705
00:40:09,883 --> 00:40:12,883
I've never been on a boat, and I don't know how to handle it!

706
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,100
It just make my lips hard to think about it.

707
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:18,897
But if you find a good sailor, and the craft to see 

708
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:22,092
Yes, I would go sailing !
Yeah Let's go sailing !

709
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:24,804
I know the plans !

710
00:40:26,406 --> 00:40:27,906
I'm sailing !

711
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:30,213
I'm sailing !

712
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:33,916
I'm sailing !

713
00:40:36,424 --> 00:40:38,424
I'm sailing !

714
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:45,429
I'm sailing !

715
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,736
This is child abuse !

716
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,540
If you drop me I'll prosecute !

717
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,650
I'm not gonna let go until you're ready ok ?

718
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:55,748
Trust me!

719
00:40:55,896 --> 00:40:57,396
Put your hans up like I showed you.

720
00:41:01,863 --> 00:41:04,863
I'm not ready.
You hear me ? I'm not ready ! Don't drop me !
I'm not ready !

721
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,504
Dr Marvin ! I'm sailing !

722
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:11,979
Oh, Siggy....

723
00:41:14,394 --> 00:41:15,894
Murderer !

724
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,700
Killer !

725
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:24,106
- Hi dad !
- I sail !

726
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:35,627
Anna !

727
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:37,523
Anna ! Come here please !

728
00:41:37,627 --> 00:41:40,627
- Dad !
- Anna, I'd like to speak to you please.

729
00:41:40,636 --> 00:41:42,636
Dr Marvin, Dr Marvin, guess what ! 

730
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:44,835
I sail !

731
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:46,239
I'm a sailor ! I sail !

732
00:41:46,565 --> 00:41:49,065
- I'd like to talk to my daughter alone !
- What is this ? a break through ?

733
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:51,474
Do you think that I'm a sailor ?

734
00:41:51,878 --> 00:41:53,378
I sail ?

735
00:41:54,185 --> 00:41:55,685
I sail now ?

736
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,279
Keep sailing Bob !

737
00:41:57,285 --> 00:42:00,285
On a boat on the lake.
Very far away from the dock.

738
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:03,291
Into the wind, with the sky and everything.

739
00:42:05,379 --> 00:42:07,879
I thought I told you to stay away from Bob Willey !

740
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:10,177
Dady, I was with my friends !

741
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:12,178
- Where are we going ?
- Home !

742
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:15,789
- What about the car ?
- Leave it, it's been a long time since I've got a talk with my daughter !

743
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh daddy ! Not here !

744
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:23,599
Anna, Anna, Anna !

745
00:42:25,603 --> 00:42:27,103
Anna ...

746
00:42:27,617 --> 00:42:30,117
- I know you won't listen to your father,
  but you will always listen to me.

747
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:31,813
- So I'm asking not to see Bob Willey.

748
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,840
- Daddy, I am just...
- I can't hear you !

749
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:37,046
- Where are you Anna ?

750
00:42:39,855 --> 00:42:42,855
- I'm just having fun with my friends !
- And Bob Willey.

751
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,940
- Yes and Bob Willey !

752
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:46,452
- Bob Willey is your father's patient

753
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,250
- Bob Willey is a very sensitive person !
- Your father's sensitive ?

754
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,666
- Bob listens to people !
- You father listens to people !

755
00:42:53,078 --> 00:42:55,078
- Except when he's up here on lake Winnipesaukee.

756
00:42:57,759 --> 00:43:00,759
He is FUN !

757
00:43:01,462 --> 00:43:04,462
You father is ... kinda fun.

758
00:43:07,498 --> 00:43:08,998
I'm Fay Marvin.

759
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:10,502
Doctor Marvin's wife.

760
00:43:10,806 --> 00:43:12,806
And I'm very happy to be on your program.

761
00:43:13,909 --> 00:43:15,909
And these are our childrens, Anna and Siggy.

762
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:35,644
I'm a failure.

763
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:36,947
What ?

764
00:43:38,751 --> 00:43:40,251
Going on national television tomorrow as an expert on human behaviour,

765
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,550
and in the space of the last hour, both of my childrens

766
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,660
told me that they hate me.

767
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,560
Come on, you know they don't mean it.

768
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,669
Anna accused me of being insensitive.

769
00:43:55,774 --> 00:43:58,774
No, what she actually said was, 

770
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,537
I was insensitive,

771
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,640
and I didn't listen,

772
00:44:03,947 --> 00:44:05,447
and I wasn't any fun,

773
00:44:07,454 --> 00:44:09,454
and that Bob Willey was...

774
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,400
Give me...

775
00:44:11,473 --> 00:44:12,473
Some time...

776
00:44:13,481 --> 00:44:15,481
To blow the man down...

777
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,619
You see something different about me ?

778
00:44:30,509 --> 00:44:33,509
- No.
- Do you sail ?
- No.

779
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,520
Well I just picked that up

780
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:38,827
What am I going to pick up next ?

781
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,500
- Try diving !
- All right ! Diving !

782
00:44:42,634 --> 00:44:44,634
I know a great teacher.

783
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:49,633
My dad, he just dropped me into the water, without warning me first.

784
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,040
I mean, I nearly drunked.
My whole life flashed before my eyes.

785
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:56,945
Well you're lucky you're only 12!

786
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,650
That still grim.
I mean what is it with him and diving ?

787
00:45:00,862 --> 00:45:02,362
What's the big deal ?

788
00:45:02,757 --> 00:45:04,257
Well .. he ... 

789
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:06,267
Wow...

790
00:45:09,475 --> 00:45:11,475
He probably just want you to beat it, that's all.

791
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:15,475
You know he probably just want you to dive, because you're affraid of diving.

792
00:45:15,884 --> 00:45:19,884
Didn't I tell you I sailed on my first try ?

793
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,690
I just let the boat do the work,  that was my secret.

794
00:45:25,496 --> 00:45:27,496
But, with diving, what's the thing ?

795
00:45:29,122 --> 00:45:31,122
- What's the trick ?
- I don't know

796
00:45:31,322 --> 00:45:33,322
It's supposed to be easy.

797
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:35,525
Can you give me a handle on it ?

798
00:45:39,045 --> 00:45:40,045
Thanks.

799
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:43,437
- Careful, oh careful !
- Let's go to the edge.

800
00:45:44,347 --> 00:45:45,847
Go to the Edge!

801
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:48,245
Come on toes off, close to the edge.

802
00:45:48,835 --> 00:45:49,835
Don't worry.

803
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,740
- Come on!
- Let's call this the edge, right here, this is the edge.

804
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:55,141
Ok, step out this edge.

805
00:45:55,074 --> 00:45:56,574
Now walk up to our edge.

806
00:45:58,081 --> 00:45:59,081
Okay

807
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,290
Got you.
Bend your knees.

808
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:03,094
Bend your knees.
Very good.

809
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,099
Bend your knees.

810
00:46:07,495 --> 00:46:08,995
- Stick to the board.
- I am sticked to the board.

811
00:46:11,207 --> 00:46:13,207
Just a second, no rush.

812
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,410
Just a second, it's my first dive.

813
00:46:21,224 --> 00:46:23,224
Well I can't see what you're doing,
why don't you get first ?

814
00:46:27,545 --> 00:46:29,545
Hey careful, hold it hold it!

815
00:46:29,836 --> 00:46:31,336
- Come up, come up
- Hold it , hold it!

816
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:32,747
- Hold my shirt, I'll show you.
- I got it.

817
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,660
- Okay, bend my knees.

818
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:39,859
Bend your knees.

819
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:40,367
Hands forward.

820
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:43,149
Stick to the board.

821
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:44,552
Honey, 

822
00:46:44,957 --> 00:46:46,457
Come here, look.

823
00:46:48,057 --> 00:46:49,557
Come here, come here.

824
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,070
I don't want to see this !
No please !

825
00:46:57,873 --> 00:46:59,373
- One

I HAD THE RIGHT TO BUY THIS HOUSE !!

845
00:47:58,615 --> 00:48:00,115
Am I gonna die ?

846
00:48:08,937 --> 00:48:10,437
- Am I gonna die ?
- No !

847
00:48:18,241 --> 00:48:19,241
Fay ...

848
00:48:25,461 --> 00:48:26,961
Look everybody, I'm not wrong often

849
00:48:27,556 --> 00:48:29,056
but when I am, I admit it.

850
00:48:29,558 --> 00:48:30,558
I mean it.

851
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,360
I would like you all to accept my apology.

852
00:48:33,766 --> 00:48:36,266
- But what about Bob ?
- What about Bob ?

853
00:48:36,571 --> 00:48:39,071
Yeah, dad, don't you think you should apologies to Bob ?

854
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:42,071
I will not apologies to Bob.

855
00:48:42,181 --> 00:48:43,181
Why not?

856
00:48:44,785 --> 00:48:45,785
All right.

857
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:48,186
I'll apologies to Bob.

858
00:48:56,298 --> 00:48:57,798
And now I'd like him to go.

859
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,800
Leo, why are you so hostile to him ?

860
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:03,406
Because he's a patient !

861
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:06,411
Fay, don't you get it, he's a patient !

862
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:09,421
A patient ! A patient !

863
00:49:09,818 --> 00:49:12,318
- Mum, can we have Bob over for dinner ?
- Dinner ?

864
00:49:12,231 --> 00:49:13,231
Yeah !

865
00:49:14,223 --> 00:49:15,723
I don't want Bob for dinner Fay.

866
00:49:16,117 --> 00:49:17,117
Leo, it's for the kids.

867
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:17,440
I don't want Bob for dinner Fay.

868
00:49:20,446 --> 00:49:22,446
I want to think about my interview tomorrow !

869
00:49:24,335 --> 00:49:25,835
I'm sorry Leo.

870
00:49:26,138 --> 00:49:27,638
Right is right.

871
00:50:13,857 --> 00:50:15,357
Fay, this is so crunchious.

872
00:50:15,759 --> 00:50:17,259
- Is this hand chocked ?

873
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,500
Would you like some more chicken Bob ?

874
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:34,569
- Leo do you want the breast ?
- No no no, that's fine, eat up !

875
00:50:42,685 --> 00:50:44,185
Hmm nice bicuits huh ?

876
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:48,492
Yeah, great biscuits, great corn, great potatoes.

877
00:50:48,995 --> 00:50:50,995
You want some more salad Bob ?

878
00:50:52,203 --> 00:50:53,703
Ya, I think I do.

879
00:51:02,722 --> 00:51:04,222
Can you get that tomatoe off there please ?

880
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,730
Sure.

881
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:07,833
Thank you.

882
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:25,941
This is delicious !

883
00:51:27,844 --> 00:51:28,844
Will you stop that please !

884
00:51:40,585 --> 00:51:42,585
Leo, I see salt and pepper, is there a salt substitute ?

885
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,070
I'll get it!

886
00:51:51,582 --> 00:51:53,582
And dont call me Leo.

887
00:51:53,687 --> 00:51:55,687
But you said in your office that I could call you Leo.

888
00:51:56,387 --> 00:51:57,887
That was in my office.

889
00:51:58,092 --> 00:52:00,092
In my home, I'd like you to call me Dr Marvin.

890
00:52:06,303 --> 00:52:08,303
He's just a little bit nervous about his interview tomorrow.

891
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:12,810
Oh yeah ! I heard about your upcoming date view !

892
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,220
Congratulations Le... Dr Marvin!

893
00:52:19,138 --> 00:52:21,638
Your book is gonna do a lot of good to a lot of people !

894
00:52:23,128 --> 00:52:25,128
I'm a walking proof of that !

895
00:52:31,342 --> 00:52:33,342
- Is this butter or margarine ?
- Butter.

896
00:52:34,759 --> 00:52:35,759
Dad ?

897
00:52:40,588 --> 00:52:41,588
Dad, are you okay ?

898
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,590
- Dad ?
- Honey ?

899
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:47,296
Don't panic, I know what to do !

900
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:53,303
Don't worry, hang on !

901
00:52:58,213 --> 00:52:59,213
He's dying !

902
00:53:01,418 --> 00:53:02,918
I'm doing the right thing !

903
00:53:13,115 --> 00:53:15,115
Honey , I love you ! Breath !!

904
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:16,519
Maybe with your knee more !

905
00:53:16,517 --> 00:53:17,517
Hit him harder ! 

906
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:20,925
Spit it up !

907
00:53:20,923 --> 00:53:21,923
He doesn't blew !

908
00:53:23,431 --> 00:53:24,431
Spit again !

909
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:31,042
- Leo are you ok ?
- Get him off me !

910
00:53:37,046 --> 00:53:38,546
Bob you saved him !

911
00:53:39,547 --> 00:53:41,047
That was incredible !

912
00:53:42,234 --> 00:53:43,734
I just never gave up hope !

913
00:54:03,613 --> 00:54:05,613
We're singing in the rain ...

914
00:54:06,915 --> 00:54:09,415
just singing in the rain ...

915
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,420
what a glorious day,

916
00:54:13,628 --> 00:54:16,128
I'm happy again ...

917
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:19,733
I walk through the kitchen...

918
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:22,739
With the bowl for the chicken...

919
00:54:22,948 --> 00:54:26,948
And I put in Leo, I mean Dr Marvin's refrigerator...

920
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:28,449
Thank you.

921
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:31,209
I'm singing in the rain ...

922
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:36,419
Well being a party cool, but tomorrow is really important

923
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:40,130
better calling  the night.

924
00:54:45,034 --> 00:54:47,034
I don't want to be rude, but maybe it's time for Bob to sing his way home !

925
00:54:49,144 --> 00:54:50,144
Honey he can't walk under this !

926
00:54:50,763 --> 00:54:52,763
Did I say that ?
I'll drive him !

927
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:57,370
- Oh dad ! The car is still at the marina !
- What ? 

928
00:54:58,472 --> 00:55:00,472
You said to leave her, remember ?

929
00:55:04,163 --> 00:55:06,163
Well that gonna led up soon.
He's gonna go home then.

930
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:08,671
But what if it starts up again ?

931
00:55:09,376 --> 00:55:10,876
He can borrow my slicker !

932
00:55:30,332 --> 00:55:31,832
- Leo ..
- Shhht

933
00:55:31,931 --> 00:55:33,931
- Leo ...
- Shhht... I think it's ledding up !

934
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:38,836
Leo, honey, it's 1 o'clock in the morning...

935
00:55:39,855 --> 00:55:42,855
we can't make Bob sit here all night !

936
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:45,469
Let just him stay over...

937
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:49,576
STAY !!
Good Morning America will be here at 7 o'clock !

938
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,880
You don't want them to discover a sevirely disturbed patient sleeping on one of my coaches !

939
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:55,686
There's an extra bed in Siggy's room.

940
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:59,881
- Fay !!
- Leo, you were very upset over Anna and Siggy...

941
00:56:02,188 --> 00:56:04,188
It's your chance to show what kind of guy 

942
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:08,396
Leo Marvin really is...

943
00:56:11,703 --> 00:56:13,703
Come on sweetie.
Come on.

944
00:56:17,015 --> 00:56:19,515
Bob, We would love for you to spend the night.

945
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:22,834
That's a great idea !

946
00:56:23,729 --> 00:56:25,229
Do you have a pillow ?

947
00:56:25,226 --> 00:56:28,226
Sure, sure ! Anna would you get a pillow and some sheets for Bob ?

948
00:56:29,034 --> 00:56:30,534
Sure !

949
00:56:30,943 --> 00:56:32,943
Siggy, would you get one of you father's ropes for Bob ?

950
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:34,530
Yeah !

951
00:56:36,933 --> 00:56:38,433
Are you sure I'm not imposing ?

952
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:40,531
Oh no ! Not at all !

953
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,340
okay ...

954
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,859
Do you care which bed ?

955
00:56:57,675 --> 00:56:59,175
Well I prefer facing south-east.

956
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
This one.

957
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,620
Did you find a tooth brush ?

958
00:57:06,918 --> 00:57:07,918
Yes.

959
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:11,321
Fay, you know where my new tooth brush is ?

960
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:13,549
In the bathroom.

961
00:57:14,156 --> 00:57:17,156
I know it should be in the bathroom but it is not in the bathroom !

962
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:20,639
Leo, honey, juste because you're going on television tomorrow 

963
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:24,139
this isn't giving you any right being so snippy !

964
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:26,949
It is not that that is making me snippy!

965
00:57:27,252 --> 00:57:29,752
- It's him !
- Him who ?

966
00:57:30,253 --> 00:57:30,953
Bob ?

967
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,660
Yes Bob !

968
00:57:32,764 --> 00:57:34,764
Who else am I talking about ?

969
00:57:35,976 --> 00:57:38,976
- Quiet, he would hear you !
- So what if he hears me ! It's my house ins't it ?

970
00:57:40,177 --> 00:57:43,177
Don't you get it ? He faked suicide ! 

971
00:57:43,777 --> 00:57:45,777
Wasn't that a cry for help ?

972
00:57:45,787 --> 00:57:47,787
What is the matter with all of you ?

973
00:57:47,883 --> 00:57:50,883
Don't you understand ?
This man is crazy !

974
00:57:51,891 --> 00:57:54,891
I mean, for all we know, he could be a... 

975
00:57:54,898 --> 00:57:56,898
Mass Murderer !

976
00:58:01,405 --> 00:58:03,405
Oh Come on Leo ! 

977
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:04,917
He's a sweet guy !

978
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:07,818
He's perfectly harmless !
Maybe a little nevrotic, but

979
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,120
not crazy.

980
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,824
Don't you realize, that everything he's done, 

981
00:58:13,228 --> 00:58:15,228
violates the doctor/patient relationship ?

982
00:58:15,728 --> 00:58:17,728
And now he's in there, 

983
00:58:17,746 --> 00:58:19,746
with our son !

984
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:23,043
Bob ?

985
00:58:23,941 --> 00:58:25,441
Yeah ?

986
00:58:28,173 --> 00:58:30,173
Are you affraid of death ?

987
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:36,281
Yeah ...

988
00:58:36,384 --> 00:58:37,884
Me too...

989
00:58:39,277 --> 00:58:41,277
Ther's no way out of it ...

990
00:58:42,577 --> 00:58:44,577
You're going in to die..

991
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,480
I'm going to die...

992
00:58:47,404 --> 00:58:49,404
It's going to happend

993
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:52,090
What difference does it make if it's tomorrow 

994
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:54,609
or in 80 years ...

995
00:58:56,012 --> 00:58:58,012
Much sooner you get it...

996
00:58:59,015 --> 00:59:01,515
Do you know how fast does time goes ?

997
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:04,619
I was 6 like yesterday ...

998
00:59:05,323 --> 00:59:06,823
Me too...

999
00:59:06,925 --> 00:59:08,425
I'm going to die !

1000
00:59:09,443 --> 00:59:12,443
You ... are going to die.

1001
00:59:15,026 --> 00:59:18,026
There's nothing to be affraid of !

1002
00:59:19,532 --> 00:59:21,532
Well not diving anymore ...

1003
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:25,341
But ...

1004
00:59:26,548 --> 00:59:28,048
Treat syndrom.

1005
00:59:28,544 --> 00:59:30,544
What's treat syndrom ?

1006
00:59:33,859 --> 00:59:35,859
What's treat syndrom ?

1007
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:38,859
Oh, I'm very proud of it Mr Obson, 

1008
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:40,868
very encourage by its success

1009
00:59:41,169 --> 00:59:43,669
I think the greatest challenge to me is not for writing.

1010
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,280
Butt head !

1011
00:59:52,285 --> 00:59:53,285
Snup Face !

1012
00:59:53,889 --> 00:59:54,889
Don't you ram it !

1013
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:56,589
Turkey tits !

1014
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,600
Open this door ! 

1015
01:00:02,604 --> 01:00:04,604
Sigmund ! 
Sigmund Open this door immediately !

1016
01:00:06,214 --> 01:00:07,714
I'm sorry dad.

1017
01:00:09,212 --> 01:00:10,212
Sorry.

1018
01:00:14,023 --> 01:00:16,023
What is going on around here ?

1019
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:19,230
Treats.

1020
01:00:19,928 --> 01:00:20,928
Treats.

1021
01:00:21,637 --> 01:00:24,637
I'm sorry Da... Leo... Dr Marvin.

1022
01:00:25,943 --> 01:00:28,943
I don't want to ear another pipe out of this room !

1023
01:00:29,648 --> 01:00:31,648
People are trying to sleep around here !

1024
01:00:31,149 --> 01:00:33,149
I think it's just kids being kids !

1025
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,754
Well tomorrow is just the most important day of my carreer !

1026
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,160
We're sorry, we'll stop.

1027
01:00:38,863 --> 01:00:41,863
We just got carried away.
It will never happend again.

1028
01:00:42,669 --> 01:00:45,169
I want you to be out of here by 6:30, do you understand me ?

1029
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:48,166
The camera crew is coming at 7, I want you out by 6:30 !

1030
01:00:50,484 --> 01:00:52,484
Sure, Would you like something for sleep ?

1031
01:00:53,286 --> 01:00:54,286
What ?

1032
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,193
I have valium if you need it.

1033
01:00:56,293 --> 01:00:58,293
No ! I don't need any valium !

1034
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:01,890
I want some peace and quiet !

1035
01:01:05,116 --> 01:01:06,616
I'll be quiet.

1036
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,420
I'll be peace.

1037
01:01:18,502 --> 01:01:19,502
Come on Bob.

1038
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:21,208

Now, we've got to keep your father calm for Good Morning America tomorrow

1040
01:01:28,795 --> 01:01:30,795
Bob gave you great things to be affraid of instead of death.

1041
01:01:32,727 --> 01:01:34,227
That's nice sweetie.

1042
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:38,910
That's very nice Bob.

1043
01:01:41,327 --> 01:01:43,327
- Good night fellows.

1044
01:01:43,831 --> 01:01:46,831

- Oki Doki.

1045
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:21,831

01:03:22,714 --> 01:03:24,214
Baby stepping down the stairs.

1064
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:26,131
Baby stepping down the stairs.

1065
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:28,637
Success, this is a beautiful morning or what ?

1066
01:03:29,137 --> 01:03:30,137
Get Out !

1067
01:03:30,345 --> 01:03:32,345
- I had the most incredible dream last night !

1068
01:03:34,455 --> 01:03:36,455
- Good Bye Mrs M. See you later !

1069
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,200

1075
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,270
Hi ! I'm Mary Grady.

1076
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:03,375
That's an honor to get you in Good Morning America.

1077
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,883
I watch your stuff all the time !

1078
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:08,184
- Aren't we jumping out too early ?
- No ! Not at All !

1079
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:10,891
- I'm Derek Catrell the director.
  And this is our producer Larry Binds.
- Nice to meet you.

1080
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:15,816
- Well, may we come in ?
- Ya ! Oh sure !

1081
01:04:22,102 --> 01:04:23,102
This is our home, 

1082
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:27,115
I was thinking of something by the fire ?

1083
01:04:29,317 --> 01:04:30,817
It's frieplace shot fellows !

1084
01:04:30,939 --> 01:04:32,439
This is even nicer than the pictures.

1085
01:04:32,745 --> 01:04:33,745
Thank You.

1086
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:34,940
Is this your family ?

1087
01:04:36,242 --> 01:04:38,242
Yes, yes it is.

1088
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:43,140
Oh ! Excuse me, I'm sorry,

1089
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,540
this is my wife Fay,
Oh, sorry, 

1090
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:53,254
And this is my daughter Anna,

1091
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:59,760
And my son ... hmm 

1092
01:05:00,381 --> 01:05:01,881
- Siggy ?
- Siggy !

1093
01:05:02,473 --> 01:05:03,473
Oh ! Hi ! I'm Mary.

1094
01:05:03,772 --> 01:05:04,772
Hello Mary, I'm Bob.

1095
01:05:05,274 --> 01:05:06,774
Yes, that was Bob, 

1096
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,900
He's a patient he lives down the road.

1097
01:05:09,179 --> 01:05:10,179
Dr Marvin, what a great idea ! 

1098
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:12,190
A Baby Step real action !

1099
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:14,288
- What ?
- Oh, Dr Marvin's gonna get a patient with him.

1100
01:05:14,788 --> 01:05:17,788
Fine, Lenny listen up how we should shot this fire place.
Let's set up over here and shoot.

1101
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:20,299
Oh ! Wait a minute !

1102
01:05:21,904 --> 01:05:23,404
No problem Dr Marvin ! We can still use the fire place.

1103
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,600
You on one side and bob on the other.

1104
01:05:29,477 --> 01:05:30,977
I don't think it's such a good idea to have a patient on with me.

1105
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:32,598
- It is !
- It is ?

1106
01:05:32,997 --> 01:05:34,497
Yeah ! It's a great idea !

1107
01:05:34,886 --> 01:05:36,886
The the better way to show the effectiveness of your book,

1108
01:05:36,988 --> 01:05:37,988
is to have a patient on with you!

1109
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:39,590
I think it's a fireplace shot.

1110
01:05:39,698 --> 01:05:41,698
Can I speak to you outside for just one second ?

1111
01:05:42,601 --> 01:05:44,101
Thank you so much.

1112
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,708
I worked very hard to be where I am, you understand me ?

1113
01:05:47,413 --> 01:05:50,413
- Screwing alone, yes.
- I don't want you on the show with me, do you understand ?

1114
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:54,113
- I think I do.
- I'll make up some excuse.

1115
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:55,918
Dr Marvin, Bob can we have you for a minute in please ?

1116
01:05:57,223 --> 01:06:00,223
- I can't Dr Marvin doesn't want ...
- Eh eh eh ! No ! Get in there !

1117
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:02,928
They're waiting for us !

1118
01:06:03,264 --> 01:06:04,764
Right this way.

1119
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,400
In ...

1120
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,300
Three

1121
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:11,900
Two

1122
01:06:11,973 --> 01:06:11,973
One

1123
01:06:12,872 --> 01:06:14,872
We're back and we're now going to our live style reporter

1124
01:06:15,682 --> 01:06:17,682
Mary Grady and the Lake Winnipesaukee New Hampshire

1125
01:06:17,996 --> 01:06:20,996
And Mary what is so special about Lake Winnipesaukee ?

1126
01:06:21,401 --> 01:06:22,901
Well Jone, among other things,

1127
01:06:22,906 --> 01:06:24,406
 it's the summer home of Dr Leo Marvin.

1128
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,710
Author of the newest sensational therapy in Baby Steps.

1129
01:06:29,317 --> 01:06:31,317
And with Dr Marvin is Bob Willey 

1130
01:06:31,717 --> 01:06:33,217
who is a patient and obviously a

1131
01:06:33,525 --> 01:06:35,525
big fan of Baby Steps Therapy.

1132
01:06:36,323 --> 01:06:38,323
Good Morning Dr Marvin, Bob.

1133
01:06:38,632 --> 01:06:39,932
- Good Morning
- Good Morning

1134
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:43,125
Now clearly, to come on national television live 

1135
01:06:43,243 --> 01:06:46,243
with a patient, shows a remarquable amount of confidence 

1136
01:06:46,851 --> 01:06:48,351
in your methods.

1137
01:06:59,878 --> 01:07:02,478
False Alarm.
Sorry.

1138
01:07:01,277 --> 01:07:02,277
Okay ?

1139
01:07:05,383 --> 01:07:06,183
Good.

1140
01:07:06,282 --> 01:07:07,282
Now, Dr Marvin.

1141
01:07:07,987 --> 01:07:09,987
Exactly how does Baby Steps work on someone like Bob ?

1142
01:07:13,292 --> 01:07:15,292
Well Jone, I'm very proud of Baby Steps, enormously gratified by its success,

1143
01:07:16,997 --> 01:07:18,997
I think the greatest challenge aside for the writing, 

1144
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:23,809
is finding ways to make the ideas accessible to everyone.

1145
01:07:28,525 --> 01:07:30,525
Hum, Bob, Tell us your impressions of Baby Steps.

1146
01:07:32,726 --> 01:07:34,726
I couldn't be happier about Baby Steps 

1147
01:07:37,231 --> 01:07:38,731
I was a total disaster 

1148
01:07:39,937 --> 01:07:41,937
and now, because of this man 

1149
01:07:42,247 --> 01:07:44,247
this morning I'm on TV in front of

1150
01:07:44,444 --> 01:07:45,444
millions and millions of people

1151
01:07:45,951 --> 01:07:47,951
I don't even think Dr Marvin know what is going on, 

1152
01:07:48,451 --> 01:07:49,451
he can't believe what's going on.

1153
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,231
I'm very excited !

1154
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:54,333
You know it sounds like a very intriguing process.

1155
01:07:54,436 --> 01:07:57,436
How long have you been a patient of Dr Marvin ?

1156
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,640
3 or 4 days.

1157
01:08:00,652 --> 01:08:02,152
3/4 days ??

1158
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:05,062
Book is not really ment to work that quickly ! 

1159
01:08:06,273 --> 01:08:07,773
It only worked that quickly with Boub.

1160
01:08:08,141 --> 01:08:09,741
Boub ?

1161
01:08:09,038 --> 01:08:09,638
Bob.

1162
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:10,940
You can call me Boub.

1163
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:12,721
No, I don't want to call you Boub.

1164
01:08:12,876 --> 01:08:14,176
Even if you did as an accident.

1165
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,382
No ! I really don't want to call him Boub,

1166
01:08:16,182 --> 01:08:19,182
the book isn't make to work that quick.

1167
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:22,224
But it did work that way ! 
That's the miracle !

1168
01:08:22,617 --> 01:08:24,117
The Miracle of Baby Steps.

1169
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:26,932
It's not just this book.

1170
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,300
It's this man.

1171
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,460
It's the compation.

1172
01:08:29,954 --> 01:08:31,954
It's the dignity, the wisdom.

1173
01:08:32,156 --> 01:08:34,156
It's the horse sense,

1174
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,860
of the guy.

1175
01:08:37,249 --> 01:08:39,249
That gets you !

1176
01:08:39,853 --> 01:08:41,853
He actually had me stay here last night in his jammies.

1177
01:08:46,794 --> 01:08:48,794
Using his tooth brush.

1178
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:50,899
In his house.

1179
01:08:51,308 --> 01:08:53,308
And, I spent the day swmming, 

1180
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:55,409
sailing with his family.

1181
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:57,310
Fay, Anna and Siggy, come here !

1182
01:09:02,425 --> 01:09:04,425
Here is the fam' !
The Marvins.

1183
01:09:05,323 --> 01:09:06,123
This is Fay, Anna and Siggy.

1184
01:09:06,227 --> 01:09:08,227
I want diving with testerday.

1185
01:09:09,544 --> 01:09:11,544
Doctor Marvin pushed me in, 

1186
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,047
You have a very nice family,

1187
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:15,253
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1188
01:09:15,456 --> 01:09:17,456
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

1189
01:09:22,869 --> 01:09:23,869
Mary, you are wise, 

1190
01:09:24,172 --> 01:09:25,672
what do I say to someone who has turned my whole life

1191
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:28,872
forever and who is giving some much of time and vacation 

1192
01:09:29,193 --> 01:09:31,193
to make me better.

1193
01:09:31,282 --> 01:09:33,282
What I'd really like to do is put the greatness of this man in perspective.

1194
01:09:33,697 --> 01:09:36,697
I think there's really only 3 names 

1195
01:09:36,905 --> 01:09:39,405
Dr Albert Schweitzer,

1196
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:40,716
Mother Trice of Calcuta probably,

1197
01:09:41,619 --> 01:09:43,619
and Leo Marvin.

1198
01:09:45,403 --> 01:09:49,403
The book is Baby Steps, the author is Dr Leo Marvin,

1199
01:09:49,507 --> 01:09:51,507
and we've been talking with Bob Willey 

1200
01:09:51,914 --> 01:09:53,414
Pretty impressive stuff Bob !

1201
01:09:53,715 --> 01:09:54,715
Dr Marvin.

1202
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:55,820
Back to you June.

1203
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,275
Way to go Bobby !

1204
01:10:02,788 --> 01:10:03,988
That was wonderful Bob !

1205
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,287
Thank you very much Mary.

1206
01:10:05,586 --> 01:10:06,586
We can come out after a few month and talk about your problems ?

1207
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,290
Hum, as long as it is ok with my doctor ?

1208
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:13,398
What ?
Oh !

1209
01:10:13,606 --> 01:10:14,606
Absolutely !

1210
01:10:14,809 --> 01:10:16,009
That's a very good idea !

1211
01:10:16,516 --> 01:10:17,216
Ok Great !

1212
01:10:17,348 --> 01:10:18,348
Come on dad ! We're taking a picture !

1213
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:21,470
- Come on !
- Come on Dr Marvin !

1214
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:23,070
- Come on !
- No...

1215
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:24,886
You got that ...

1216
01:10:25,485 --> 01:10:26,985
All right.

1217
01:10:27,282 --> 01:10:29,282
- How long do you stay ?
- Just till labour day and then we go back to New York City.

1218
01:10:29,787 --> 01:10:31,287
Ok.. Big smiles everybody !

1219
01:10:33,594 --> 01:10:35,594
Cheeeeeeeeeeese !

1220
01:10:37,098 --> 01:10:38,098
Ok, bye bye.

1221
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:39,799
Good Bye Mary.

1222
01:10:40,901 --> 01:10:41,901
Bye bye.

1223
01:10:42,309 --> 01:10:43,809
That was nice talking to you !

1224
01:10:48,414 --> 01:10:50,414
They're so nice !

1225
01:10:49,817 --> 01:10:51,817
You wer great Bob !

1226
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:53,930
You were incredible !
I mean dad shocked, you saved him !

1227
01:11:00,853 --> 01:11:02,353
Here is the one who made me happy !

1228
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:05,958
- Oh Sweetie !
- Dr Leo Marvin !

1229
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:10,167
Get Out...

1230
01:11:10,272 --> 01:11:12,272
No we won't get out ! You deserve it !

1231
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,380
I mean , GET OUT !

1232
01:11:19,061 --> 01:11:21,062
GET OUT !!

1233
01:11:20,662 --> 01:11:21,662
Is it something I said ?

1234
01:11:21,766 --> 01:11:23,266
You ruined my life !

1235
01:11:23,471 --> 01:11:24,971
You ruined my career !

1236
01:11:25,273 --> 01:11:26,773
You ruined my book !

1237
01:11:26,974 --> 01:11:28,974
You put a perfectly peaceful house into an insame asylum !

1238
01:11:29,682 --> 01:11:31,182
Get out !!

1239
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,280
- Daddy !
- What's got into you ?

1240
01:11:33,788 --> 01:11:34,988
It was a disaster Fay !

1241
01:11:35,203 --> 01:11:37,203
No it wasn't you were wonderful sweetie !

1242
01:11:38,907 --> 01:11:40,907
You were fine dad !

1243
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:43,110
Why do you need to keep Bob out of the house ?

1244
01:11:43,404 --> 01:11:44,404
You think he's gone ?

1245
01:11:44,803 --> 01:11:46,803
He's not gone !
That's the all point !

1246
01:11:47,105 --> 01:11:48,605
He's never gone !!

1247
01:11:48,913 --> 01:11:50,413
Is this some radical new therapy ?

1248
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,014
YOU SEE ??

1249
01:11:54,924 --> 01:11:56,924
We can't be expected to understant,
he's so far above us !

1250
01:11:58,533 --> 01:12:00,533
We're like ropes on a goodyear blim.

1251
01:12:06,138 --> 01:12:08,138
Are you all right ?

1252
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:11,544
I want to apologies to you for that terrible outverse,

1253
01:12:12,752 --> 01:12:14,752
I'm trully sorry.

1254
01:12:14,777 --> 01:12:16,777
call it the show-business nerves.

1255
01:12:17,786 --> 01:12:19,786
Oh, we can all certainly understand that !

1256
01:12:20,185 --> 01:12:22,185
A lot of people freeze on TV dad !

1257
01:12:23,096 --> 01:12:24,096
Thank you.

1258
01:12:24,594 --> 01:12:25,594
Bob...

1259
01:12:26,099 --> 01:12:28,099
how do you feel about you and me having a little talk ?

1260
01:12:29,505 --> 01:12:31,505
Just me and you ?

1261
01:12:32,104 --> 01:12:34,104
I think I'dle like to spend a little time with you,

1262
01:12:34,412 --> 01:12:36,412
pay you back, for all the time you spent with me.

1263
01:12:37,913 --> 01:12:39,913
What do you say ?
Do you feel like for a little ride ?

1264
01:12:40,531 --> 01:12:42,031
Do I ??

1265
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:47,541
- This is so sweet !
- It's really nice dad !

1266
01:12:50,934 --> 01:12:52,434
Look how happy he is !

1267
01:13:07,574 --> 01:13:09,570
Try to be home by 7.

1268
01:13:21,319 --> 01:13:22,319
Where we're going ?

1269
01:13:22,824 --> 01:13:24,324
Intensive psychotherapy.

1270
01:13:24,822 --> 01:13:26,322
Waow !

1271
01:13:26,627 --> 01:13:28,127
Okay !

1272
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:30,231
Some free association from my infancy...

1273
01:13:32,536 --> 01:13:32,936
A beach ball

1274
01:13:33,038 --> 01:13:34,038
A dog

1275
01:13:34,942 --> 01:13:35,942
A frog

1276
01:13:36,743 --> 01:13:37,743
A lock

1277
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:39,043
A puddle

1278
01:13:39,447 --> 01:13:40,447
A nuddle

1279
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:41,855
A duddle

1280
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:49,870
Dr Marvin to see Dr Tobski.

1281
01:13:51,273 --> 01:13:52,773
Dr Leo Marvin.

1282
01:13:53,273 --> 01:13:55,273
Err Main building Doctor, they're expecting you.

1283
01:13:56,178 --> 01:13:58,178

1285
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Ah !

1286
01:14:17,749 --> 01:14:19,249
Hello Leo ! Long time no see !

1287
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,955
Sorry, I missed your show this morning.

1288
01:14:22,148 --> 01:14:24,148
Well this is the friend you called about !

1289
01:14:24,348 --> 01:14:26,348
Bob Willey ! I would like you to meet your new pal, Dr Tobski. 

1290
01:14:27,358 --> 01:14:28,358
Hello Bob.

1291
01:14:28,846 --> 01:14:30,082
New Pal ?
What's wrong with my old pal ?

1292
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:32,958
Would you show Mr Willey to his room please ?

1293
01:14:35,059 --> 01:14:37,059
Oh no, wait a second doctor, doctor !

I have compulsions, my bladder is feeling funny !

1296
01:14:44,432 --> 01:14:47,032
Really appreciating you're helping me on this Catherine.

1297
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:49,040
I can only hold him for 24 hours Leo, without staff corraboration.

1298
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:55,573
Not to worry about that !
I'm sure your entire staff will corroborate !

1299
01:14:57,767 --> 01:14:59,267
Thank you, Thank you very much Catherine.

1300
01:14:59,754 --> 01:15:01,754
- You're welcome !
- Thank you.

1301
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:16,561
Ahh, you see Bob, 

1302
01:15:16,753 --> 01:15:18,753
I will not be defeated !

1303
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,160
I won't negociate and I won't compromise the defeat !

1304
01:15:27,097 --> 01:15:28,097
Cigarret Bob ? 

1305
01:15:28,202 --> 01:15:29,202
Oh ! Sorry !

1306

I didn't realize you wear administrate jacket !

1307
01:15:58,723 --> 01:15:59,723
Honey,

1308
01:16:00,332 --> 01:16:01,832
Catherine Tobski's on the phone.

1309
01:16:03,829 --> 01:16:04,829
Allo ?

1310
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:06,936
What ?

1311
01:16:07,339 --> 01:16:08,339
No !

1312
01:16:08,544 --> 01:16:09,544
No !!

1313
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:12,640
- Son of a bitch !
- Where's Bob ?

1314
01:16:12,649 --> 01:16:13,649
- Son of a bitch !!
- Where's Bob ??

1315
01:16:15,774 --> 01:16:17,774
Honey ! Where's Bob ?

1316
01:16:20,661 --> 01:16:22,661
What about Bob ?

1317
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:24,978
What about Bob ?

1318
01:16:25,186 --> 01:16:27,186
WHAT ABOUT BOB ?

1319
01:16:28,901 --> 01:16:31,901
It's a female !
Do you think I'm wearing something ?

1320
01:16:35,906 --> 01:16:38,906
But, it reminds me my favorite poem,
which is ..

1321
01:16:38,917 --> 01:16:40,317
Well this is a red,

1322
01:16:40,413 --> 01:16:41,813
fouled as a blue,

1323
01:16:41,822 --> 01:16:43,222
I'm a skit as franck

1324
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,440
and so am I.

1325
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:01,125
So the psychiatrist says...

1326
01:17:06,834 --> 01:17:08,334
It's not the joke yet !
Wait a second ...

1327
01:17:08,544 --> 01:17:10,044
He draws a picture of a tree, what do you think of that one ?

1328
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:13,950
He answered sex, ok, he draws the picture of a car, sex, sex 

1329
01:17:15,054 --> 01:17:17,054
Then the doctor says, you're obssesed with sex !

1330
01:17:18,056 --> 01:17:20,056
And the patient says, oh ! you're the one drawing dirty pictures !

1331
01:17:21,162 --> 01:17:23,162
I'm giving you back your admitting form Leo,

1332
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,160
to save you an embarassment.

1333
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:25,291
- EMBARASSMENT ?
- Yeah !

1334
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:29,601
Catherine ! You have been dubted, by a brilliant sociopath !

1335
01:17:33,552 --> 01:17:35,552
Brilliant enough to dubt my entire staff ?

1336
01:17:36,456 --> 01:17:37,456
I doubt that !

1337
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,353
Look, it's perfectly natural for a patient to bind with his analyst !

1338
01:17:42,857 --> 01:17:44,857
If you want to be rid of him, just tell him you won't treat him anymore !

1339
01:17:46,268 --> 01:17:47,768
Catherine, that's easy for you to say !

1340
01:17:47,978 --> 01:17:49,978
The man is human crazy-glue !

1341
01:17:50,769 --> 01:17:52,769
You should have never let him sleep in your pijamas Leo !

1342
01:17:53,073 --> 01:17:55,073
I can't believe I'm hearing this !

1343
01:17:55,738 --> 01:17:56,738
Relax Leo !

1344
01:17:56,739 --> 01:17:57,739
I'm relaxed !!

1345
01:17:58,042 --> 01:17:59,042
Take a vacation !

1346
01:17:59,142 --> 01:18:00,142
I'm on vacation !!

1347
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:03,950
Maybe you should check in here for a few days...

1348
01:18:04,154 --> 01:18:06,154
We can handle on things.

1349
01:18:12,956 --> 01:18:14,956
It was an interesting morning, fruitful,

1350
01:18:15,258 --> 01:18:17,258
but it lacks the intensity that you and I generate together.

1351
01:18:18,462 --> 01:18:20,462
the sparks that we get one on one 

1352
01:18:21,175 --> 01:18:23,175
we should discut out a way to work around your schedule,

1353
01:18:24,982 --> 01:18:26,982
do we work afternoons ?

1354
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,180
2 to 4 ?

1355
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:29,190
3 to 5 ?

1356
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:31,290
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday ?

1357
01:18:40,825 --> 01:18:42,825
You think we'd rather work on mornings ?

1358
01:18:44,228 --> 01:18:45,728
Get Out !!

1359
01:18:51,547 --> 01:18:53,547
It's a combustible relationship isn't it ?

1360
01:18:54,165 --> 01:18:56,165
Is it just you and me ? 
or it it you and everybody ?

1361
01:19:03,685 --> 01:19:05,185
Hoy !

1362
01:19:23,031 --> 01:19:25,031
Excuse me Officer ?

1363
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,140
Can you please make sure he's home by 7 ?

1364
01:19:34,134 --> 01:19:37,011
Hey ! Didn't I see that guy on TV ?

1365
01:20:02,582 --> 01:20:03,818


1366
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,897
Oh Damn !
Son of a Bitch !

1367
01:20:27,612 --> 01:20:28,895
I'm Home !

1368
01:20:33,181 --> 01:20:34,131
Fay !

1369
01:20:37,511 --> 01:20:39,557
We're all here sweetie !

1370
01:20:48,828 --> 01:20:50,011
SURPRISE !

1371
01:20:51,808 --> 01:20:53,812
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU !

1372
01:20:55,493 --> 01:20:57,497
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU !

1373
01:20:57,897 --> 01:21:00,080
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR MARVIN !

1374
01:21:01,651 --> 01:21:03,655
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU !

1375
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:41,901
Dad, what happend ?

1376
01:21:42,075 --> 01:21:43,025
Dad ?

1377
01:21:43,417 --> 01:21:45,383
Honey, you're a mess !
Are you all right ?

1378
01:21:46,632 --> 01:21:48,187
Oh yeah yeah !

1379
01:21:49,408 --> 01:21:51,656
Just a little car trouble !

1380
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,951
Ohhh on your birthday ...

1381
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:57,237
Happy birthday Leo !

1382
01:21:57,053 --> 01:21:58,851
HAPPY BIRTHDAY LEO !

1383
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:04,214
Sweetie, we have a great big surprise for you !

1384
01:22:06,486 --> 01:22:09,260
You sister Lily is here from Chicago !

1385
01:22:10,571 --> 01:22:12,369
Happy birthday Leo !

1386
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:14,205
Lily !!

1387
01:22:15,171 --> 01:22:17,952
We are all here for you Dr M. ! 
This is your night !

1388
01:22:20,052 --> 01:22:22,058
DON'T TOUCH MY SISTER !

1389
01:22:40,976 --> 01:22:43,635
I've never seen him like this Phil...

1390
01:22:42,847 --> 01:22:45,569
He's been under a lot of stress Fay,

1391
01:22:44,984 --> 01:22:47,940
Bob, his interview which didn't go so well...

1392
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:51,314
- And his birthday...
- Exactly...

1393
01:23:07,094 --> 01:23:09,870
Phil, do you think Leo was surprised ?

1394
01:23:10,078 --> 01:23:11,775
Oh I think so !

1395
01:23:11,617 --> 01:23:13,226
- How is he ?
- I'm leaving a prescription for PROZAC.

1396
01:23:15,005 --> 01:23:19,158
Excuse me Phil, but with these particular symptoms, is PROZAC the right choice ?

1397
01:23:20,484 --> 01:23:22,959
You think PROZAC is a mistake ?

1398
01:23:22,601 --> 01:23:26,950
For this kind of episode, I would says LIBERRINE is a more effective management tool.

1399
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:30,018
You could be right, I'll rewrite the prescription.

1400
01:23:32,051 --> 01:23:35,430
Bob, why do you think Leo act to you like that ?

1401
01:23:34,739 --> 01:23:37,640
I don't know ! He's been tensed today, 

1402
01:23:37,007 --> 01:23:41,592
But don't worry, no matter how long it takes, I'm gonna stay on and help the family to be the daddy !

1403
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:45,096
You are such a good friend !
Leo is lucky to have you !

1404
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:53,703
Thank you sweetie !
Oh, no problem !

1405
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,368
It's been a real pleasure !

1406
01:24:00,738 --> 01:24:02,378
Keep me posted !

1407
01:24:02,673 --> 01:24:03,670
Okay !

1408
01:24:04,302 --> 01:24:05,769
- Bye Lily !
- Good Bye

1409
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,579
Bye Lily !

1410
01:24:23,304 --> 01:24:25,554
This is so hard Bob, but...

1411
01:24:24,997 --> 01:24:28,076
We're not defending Leo's behaviour in anyway so...

1412
01:24:31,813 --> 01:24:34,316
please don't take this personnaly !

1413
01:24:34,428 --> 01:24:35,519
Oh no...

1414
01:24:37,168 --> 01:24:40,603
That how irrational the reasons, Leo is so upset at you,

1415
01:24:43,734 --> 01:24:47,735
We just think it would be best if you're not here when he wakes up.

1416
01:24:53,286 --> 01:24:56,142
Please, that's not the way I want it !

1417
01:24:55,982 --> 01:24:57,167
Me either.

1418
01:24:57,623 --> 01:24:58,620
Or me.

1419
01:25:03,324 --> 01:25:05,277
You want me to go ?

1420
01:25:05,828 --> 01:25:07,013
I'm sorry.

1421
01:25:13,886 --> 01:25:14,975
Really ?

1422
01:25:21,146 --> 01:25:22,284
Good Bye.

1423
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,262
Later !

1424
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,645
- Good bye Bob !
- Bye Anna !

1425
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:33,093
- Take care of yourself !
- Okay , and you take care of Leo !

1426
01:25:34,565 --> 01:25:37,251
Just temporarly disconnected, that's all !

1427
01:25:40,656 --> 01:25:43,253
You know, I've got to tell you !

1428
01:25:43,881 --> 01:25:46,921
I've got the greatest vacation with you all !

1429
01:26:13,817 --> 01:26:15,557
No ! Too messy !

1430
01:26:16,644 --> 01:26:18,863
No ! Not painfull enough !

1431
01:26:30,027 --> 01:26:30,977
Yes !

1432
01:26:39,178 --> 01:26:41,244
He's not at the dock !

1433
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:42,178
He's not downstairs !

1434
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:44,712
Let's get the car ! Come on !

1435
01:26:43,844 --> 01:26:46,151
Maybe he went for a walk !

1436
01:27:15,323 --> 01:27:16,414
Allo !!!

1437
01:27:19,481 --> 01:27:20,670
Oh God !

1438
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,619
Doctor Marvin !

1439
01:27:24,388 --> 01:27:25,477
Doctor !

1440
01:27:26,365 --> 01:27:28,122
Doctor Leo Marvin !

1441
01:27:29,163 --> 01:27:30,490
Dr Marvin !

1442
01:27:32,869 --> 01:27:34,240
Dr Marvin !!

1443
01:27:34,587 --> 01:27:35,912
Hello Bob !

1444
01:27:37,346 --> 01:27:40,007
What are you doing with a riffle ?

1445
01:27:38,893 --> 01:27:40,925
Get back ! Get back !

1446
01:27:41,549 --> 01:27:43,447
- What are you doing ?
- Quick ! quick !

1447
01:27:45,019 --> 01:27:46,430
Stand there !

1448
01:27:47,336 --> 01:27:48,286
Dad !
Where are you ?

1449
01:27:54,326 --> 01:27:56,258
Where goes the fam' ?

1450
01:27:55,706 --> 01:27:57,676
You'll be very quiet !

1451
01:27:57,698 --> 01:27:59,972
And do exactly as I say !

1452
01:27:59,578 --> 01:28:00,991
Turn around !

1453
01:28:00,912 --> 01:28:02,003
and move

1454
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:04,097
- Where to ?
- Death therapy Bob !

1455
01:28:04,778 --> 01:28:07,537
- It's a gurantee cure.
- Wow ! 

1456
01:28:06,658 --> 01:28:09,193
You should I put my hands up ?

1457
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:10,661
Yes that's good ! do that !

1458
01:28:10,315 --> 01:28:12,266
- Err, which way ? 
- To the left !

1459
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:14,126
To the left, yes !

1460
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:19,172
It is so right that we have come together, isn't it right Dr Marvin ?

1461
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:21,324
I know it was ment to be !

1462
01:28:20,792 --> 01:28:22,608
- You think so Bob ?
- Yes !

1463
01:28:22,787 --> 01:28:24,544
Because It's time !

1464
01:28:24,598 --> 01:28:26,197
And I'm ready !

1465
01:28:25,829 --> 01:28:28,737
But Dr Godswell didn't think I was ready...

1466
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:29,792
And Dr Rosingay and Tcheski.

1467
01:28:31,699 --> 01:28:34,693
I was certainly not ready for Malestine or Miller.

1468
01:28:37,085 --> 01:28:39,926
But with you ! Finnally , I'm ready !

1469
01:28:40,824 --> 01:28:44,913
What do you think is the difference between the others guys and me Bob ?

1470
01:28:43,821 --> 01:28:46,418
Is that now I'm gonna kill you !

1471
01:28:45,788 --> 01:28:49,056
But if you shoot me, our therapy will be over !

1472
01:28:51,097 --> 01:28:53,507
I'm not gonna shoot you Bob !
I don't think I can shoot anybody !

1473
01:28:54,001 --> 01:28:56,105
I'm gonna blow you up !

1474
01:28:57,934 --> 01:29:00,469
This is called black powder Bob !

1475
01:29:03,888 --> 01:29:05,355
Here you go !

1476
01:29:05,122 --> 01:29:06,938
How much is this ?

1477
01:29:07,733 --> 01:29:09,412
20 pounds worth !

1478
01:29:11,524 --> 01:29:13,639
You understand don't you ?

1479
01:29:13,024 --> 01:29:15,561
That there is no other solution !

1480
01:29:14,542 --> 01:29:16,399
You won't go away !

1481
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:17,413
- I will !
- No you won't !

1482
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:20,412
You're just saying you will, 

1483
01:29:20,721 --> 01:29:24,056
But after, if I don't kill you, you show up again.

1484
01:29:23,226 --> 01:29:27,037
And you make everyone in my life think you are wonderful
and I'm a schmock

1485
01:29:27,447 --> 01:29:29,553
I'm not a schmock Bob !

1486
01:29:30,696 --> 01:29:34,759
And I won't let you take my family away, just beacause you're crazy engouh to be fun !

1487
01:29:47,138 --> 01:29:49,729
You'll take care of Gil for me ?

1488
01:29:48,996 --> 01:29:52,767
Yeah don't worry ! I'll feed him until is big jelly is fat !

1489
01:29:52,638 --> 01:29:54,978
And then I'll eat him Bob !

1490
01:29:55,958 --> 01:29:58,521
You sure aren't convincing Dr M. !

1491
01:30:03,986 --> 01:30:05,626
This is tricky !

1492
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:13,613
What ?? Oh ! It's terrible news Fay !

1493
01:30:14,150 --> 01:30:17,088
Well he tryied to commit suicide once before
and we should have seen this coming.

1494
01:30:18,129 --> 01:30:19,129
More fish anyone ?

1495
01:30:20,547 --> 01:30:22,269
I'm all tied up...

1496
01:30:23,288 --> 01:30:24,747
And tied up...

1497
01:30:28,357 --> 01:30:31,661

1498
01:30:33,155 --> 01:30:34,152

1499
01:30:34,722 --> 01:30:36,810
I'm all tied up inside...

1500
01:30:38,066 --> 01:30:40,692
and those dirty bombs means that ...

1501
01:30:42,252 --> 01:30:43,669
If I don't...

1502
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:47,122
Untie myself inside the emotional knots ...

1503
01:30:50,474 --> 01:30:52,235
I'm gonna explode !

1504

On Wednesday we'll eat Bob !

1520
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:14,259
No no no that's going too far !

1521
01:32:16,596 --> 01:32:18,107
Dad ! Daddy !

1522
01:32:20,342 --> 01:32:22,384

1525
01:32:32,493 --> 01:32:33,996
Now Bob's gone.

1530
01:32:50,236 --> 01:32:52,038
Bob, just please ...

1531
01:32:54,537 --> 01:32:56,533
Dr Leo is a genius !

1532
01:32:56,355 --> 01:32:59,416
Your death therapy cured me, you're a genius !

1533
01:33:00,879 --> 01:33:03,059
What are you doing here ?

1534
01:33:03,178 --> 01:33:05,148
You killed me doctor !

1535
01:33:06,774 --> 01:33:09,498
The bags I put around your neck Bob,

1536
01:33:08,412 --> 01:33:10,050
Where are they ?

1537
01:33:09,606 --> 01:33:11,021
In the House.

1538
01:33:11,803 --> 01:33:12,753
Why ?

1539
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:29,394
Sweetie ... our house ?

1540
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:31,383
Oups...

1541
01:33:35,836 --> 01:33:37,476
Burn Burn Burn !

1542
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:05,275
You think he can hear us talk to him ?

1543
01:34:04,656 --> 01:34:06,650
Can we talk to him ?

1544
01:34:06,088 --> 01:34:08,723
I don't know if it will help you. Try.

1545
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:10,103
Come on sweetie.

1546
01:34:12,421 --> 01:34:13,371

1547
01:34:13,433 --> 01:34:14,569

1548
01:34:14,917 --> 01:34:15,867
Leo !

1549
01:34:16,915 --> 01:34:18,690
Can you hear me ?

1550
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:20,724
Daddy it's me Anna !

1551
01:34:20,848 --> 01:34:23,355
Leo, it's me Lily, your sister !

1552
01:34:24,094 --> 01:34:26,571
We don't care about the house !

1553
01:34:26,481 --> 01:34:28,256
Come back to us !

1554
01:34:28,535 --> 01:34:30,392
The worst is over !

1555
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:33,417
Yeah dad ! How much worst can it get ?

1556
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:41,905
Do you Bob Willey take Lily Marvin, to be your loveful wife, loves honor and cherrish her
until death do you part ?

1557
01:34:45,211 --> 01:34:46,161

1558
01:34:46,628 --> 01:34:49,289
Do you Lily Marvin take Bob Willy o be your loveful husband, loves honor and cherrish her

I do !

1560
01:34:56,456 --> 01:34:59,626
If anyone here, knows any reason why these two 
should not be joined together in the holly matrimony

1561
01:35:02,937 --> 01:35:05,592
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

1562
01:35:17,431 --> 01:35:20,034
Then by the power invested in me...

1563
01:35:20,102 --> 01:35:23,701
by the state of New York, I pronounce you Husband and Wife.

1564
01:35:23,130 --> 01:35:24,754

1565
01:35:26,899 --> 01:35:28,266
