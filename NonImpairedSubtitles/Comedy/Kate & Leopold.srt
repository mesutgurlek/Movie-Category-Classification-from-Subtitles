00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,080
Kate & Leopold (2001) - 23.976 fps
Cleaned by Xylo

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,600
Time.

3
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,700
Time, it has been proposed

4
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,400
is the fourth dimension.

5
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,400
And yet, for mortal man,
time has no dimension at all.

6
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,000
We are like horses
with blinders

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,800
seeing only
what lies before us.

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,500
Forever guessing the future

9
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,400
and fabricating the past.

10
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,900
Brilliant.

11
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,600
Quite right, Your Grace.

12
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,200
How, you ask, can we lift

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,500
these shackles and live-
not in the moment

14
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,500
but in the glorious expanse
of time's continuum?

15
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,200
Listen, and I shall tell you.

16
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,200
The secret lies in the enduring
power of our achievements

17
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,700
our creations!

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,900
As the pyramids testify
to the Egyptians

19
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,400
so my glorious erection
shall represent

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,100
our culture in perpetuity.

21
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,900
Behold, rising before you

22
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,900
the greatest erection
on the continent.

23
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,900
The greatest erection
of the age!

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The greatest erection
on the planet!

25
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,400
Hold this.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Of course.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
For the Herald, Your Grace.

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
I understand
you'll be making

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,200
an important announcement
tonight.

30
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,000
Good afternoon, ladies.
Please, excuse me, please.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Good afternoon.

32
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,800
And the Perrier-Jouet
should be chilled.

33
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
- You understand? Chilled.
- Yes, sir.

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
Leopold!

35
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,700
Leopold, where have you been?

36
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,300
Leopold!

37
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,200
Otis, I demand explication!

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,400
It's half past 5:00!
He's not even dressed!

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,200
He'll be ready, my lord.
I assure you.

40
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,200
I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendent!

41
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,500
Ah, Miss Blaine.

42
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,300
You dance like a...

43
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,800
like a herd of cattle.

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,900
You are a rare woman

45
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,800
who lights up a room
simply by leaving it.

46
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,500
Might you be rich,
Miss Blaine?

47
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
You see, whilst I
am the third Duke

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,900
the little secret of those
of us in the Royal Court-

49
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,500
apart from our
general uselessness-

50
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,100
is our massive
indebtedness.

51
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,200
It's always been
your misfortune, Leopold

52
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
that you so thoroughly
amuse yourself

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,800
with the sound
of your own voice.

54
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,300
In a life as stagnant as mine

55
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,900
that I can amuse myself at all

56
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,900
is an evolutionary marvel.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Please don't touch that.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The device you were
jabbering about.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,500
To take priests
to the bell tower.

60
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,400
To take anyone, Uncle, to
the floor they so desire.

61
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,200
Buildings continue to climb.

62
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,300
Soon they will outstrip
the stamina of our legs.

63
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,200
You speak of progress
and invention.

64
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,600
Yet what I offer you downstairs
is reality.

65
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
Take a wife. Marry.

66
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,300
Marriage...

67
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,400
marriage is the promise
of eternal love.

68
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,600
As a man of honor, I can
not promise eternally

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,400
what I have never
felt momentarily.

70
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Born into privilege,
yet perversely ashamed of it.

71
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,200
That is your tragedy.

72
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
My God! If my brother

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,400
could only see you,
he'd be heartbroken.

74
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,900
You are no duke!

75
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
Of course I'm not.

76
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,800
The monarchy is dead, Uncle.

77
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,900
We are relics.
That is reality.

78
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,600
The new Royals are men
of accomplishment.

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,900
Men like Roebling,
with his bridge

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,200
Edison, with his lamp

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Diesel, Bell, Westinghouse...

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,400
Those men made themselves
from nothing!

83
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,600
You, on the other hand,
were born with everything

84
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,000
and from it,
fashioned nothing.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
As of tonight,
I wash my hands of you.

86
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,000
Take a good look
at your dance card, Leopold.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A wealthy bride
is your only surety.

88
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,700
Your Grace,
may I present Miss Tree

89
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,700
of the Trees
of Schenectady, sir.

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,900
Miss Tree?

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,200
It's an honor to be making

92
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,200
your royal acquaintance,
Your Highness.

93
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Shall we?

94
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Many dreams, all useless.

95
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Who are you?

96
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
No, no, no.

97
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Okay, rela...

98
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
Please, wait, no.

99
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,500
I don't want to harm you.

100
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Stop! Please!

101
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Sir, wait!

102
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Pardon me. Pardon me.

103
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,600
Go! Go!

104
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Ya!-

105
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,300
Ya!

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Stop, sir! Please!

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, my God.

108
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,400
No!

109
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,200
Oh!

110
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,900
Let go!

111
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,800
Just let go. It's okay!

112
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,800
You don't understand!
Let go!

113
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Oh!

114
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,300
I don't want to hurt you!
Let go!

115
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Goddamn it!

116
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Bart!

117
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Wait!

118
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,900
Shit!

119
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, my God.

120
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,100
We must remember, Bart

121
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,100
that sometimes it is okay
to color outside the lines.

122
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Hello?

123
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
My Palm Pilot.
You still have it.

124
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,800
Kate, it's 1:00 in the morning.

125
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,100
And clearly you're awake,
so what is the infraction?

126
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,000
Look, Kate, I don't know
where your Palm Pilot is.

127
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I can't do this right now.
Not now. I'm expecting a call.

128
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,400
Oh, Bart.

129
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,700
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

130
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,700
She is not a happy person.

131
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Goddamn it!

132
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,700
You know what, Stuart?
You know what? I'm...

133
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,200
Kate...

134
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,000
Please. I've got
somebody here, okay?

135
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,900
I know. I saw her.

136
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,700
No, you didn't.

137
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,700
Yes, I did!

138
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,300
It's a him, if that's
any kind of consolation to you.

139
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,100
So, look, now that you know

140
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
I'm not getting laid,
just go to bed, okay?

141
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,000
Nuh-uh, don't. Do not
hang up on me, Stuart.

142
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,300
Don't do that.

143
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Kate, please.

144
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,600
I beg of you.
Something big is happening.

145
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Something that validates
my entire life...

146
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
What could that possibly be?

147
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
- Are you sitting down?
- Yes.

148
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

149
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,200
- No, you're not.
- Ye...

150
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Okay.

151
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,600
I found it.

152
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,700
What did you find?

153
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,100
The portal.

154
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,300
A crack in the fabric of time.

155
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,800
It was over
the East River, Kate

156
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,300
- just where I said it would be.
- You found the portal?

157
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,000
A portal into April 28th, 1876.

158
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge
and took a walk

159
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,800
in 1876 today.

160
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,800
I followed the Duke of Albany
around old New York.

161
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,200
- Are you listening?
- Avidly.

162
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,300
This here's the twist, Kate.
Here's the kicker.

163
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,200
What's the kicker?

164
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,500
He followed me home.

165
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,800
The Duke of Buffalo...

166
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,100
No, the Duke of Albany.

167
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,900
...Albany followed you home

168
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,400
through a crack in time.

169
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,700
He's a brilliant engineer.

170
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,000
He patented
the counterweight pulley.

171
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,400
He invented the elevator,
for Christ's sake.

172
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,800
You know what, Stuart?
You know what?

173
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,500
I'm not your girlfriend anymore.

174
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I haven't been
for a whole month now.

175
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,100
You can tell me the truth.

176
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,800
I am telling you
the truth, Kate.

177
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,900
You can tell me you went

178
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,200
and picked up a transvestite
in Times Square.

179
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
I don't care.

180
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,100
You know what, Kate?
This is it, right here.

181
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,100
This is it, in a nutshell.
Our downfall.

182
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,300
You never- not once-
believed in me.

183
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,800
Oh, I did, Stuart.

184
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
I did, for four years.

185
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,200
And I got burnt.

186
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Okay, you want to know
who he is?

187
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,800
I'll tell you who he is.

188
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,600
He is a hacker.

189
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,800
High end. English.

190
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,700
I know him from Columbia.

191
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,900
He's in town for the Mac Expo
at the Javits.

192
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,000
We went out, got a little sloppy
on Guinness

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and he passed out on my couch.

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,300
And that's the truth?

195
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,200
Mm-hmm. That's the truth.

196
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,100
Okay? Are you happy now?

197
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,800
Is that plausible enough

198
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,900
for you and your little
focus group?

199
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,600
You know what, Stuart?

200
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,500
I blew my best years on you.

201
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Those were your best?

202
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,200
Look...

203
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,100
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,100
I have to go.
You'll get your Pilot in the morning.

205
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,900
Orange alert.

206
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Otis!-

207
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Otis!

208
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Bart, stop!

209
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,800
It's okay.

210
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,200
- It's okay.
- Where am I?

211
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,800
Well, um, there's not
an easy explanation for that.

212
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,500
If it's a ransom you seek,
my uncle won't pay a cent.

213
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,200
Except, perhaps, for my demise.

214
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,500
No. no. You're not
being kidnapped.

215
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,100
Bart, quiet!

216
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,000
I can scarcely see,
thanks to your spray.

217
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,300
My eyes feel like Steak au Poivre.

218
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,300
So I ask you again,
where the hell am I?

219
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,700
As far as I'm concerned,
you might be Jack the Ripper!

220
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,000
And you would have me believe

221
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,300
that I'm being detained
at present in the hereafter?

222
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
- The time to come?
- Yes.

223
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,200
Bart, quiet!
He needs a walk.

224
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,300
Oh, and you would have me believe

225
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,700
that you have found
a crack in time.

226
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,300
You, of all people,
should understand.

227
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,800
I mean, you're a scientist.
You invented the elevator.

228
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,600
What is an elevator?
What the hell are you talk...

229
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,100
Where the hell am I?

230
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,500
I told you-
you haven't actually gone anywhere.

231
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,700
You're still in New York.

232
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,300
That, sir, is not New York!

233
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,900
I'm afraid it is.

234
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,800
- No, Kate.
- Hello. Hello there.

235
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
What's your name?

236
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,300
- Leopold.
- Tell me something.

237
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
I'm having trouble
with my G-5.

238
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,300
How much RAM do I need
to properly run OS 9.6?

239
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,100
Clearly, the Mac Expo is out.

240
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,700
So you must be...

241
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,400
a man out of time?

242
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,100
Or Sergeant Pepper?

243
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,700
You know what?

244
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,000
Actually, we could use
a little privacy.

245
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Stuart, I want my Palm Pilot.

246
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,600
- I'm not... I'm serious.
- Maybe later on, Kate.

247
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:51,700
I just want
my Palm Pilot, Stuart!

248
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,400
- No. No.
- Hey, give me my Palm Pilot!

249
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,700
Give it to me.

250
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,900
This is madness.
This is madness.

251
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,500
Who was that?

252
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,800
I-I feel as if I've seen her...

253
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,400
Women have changed
since your time, Leo.

254
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,400
They've become dangerous.

255
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,100
It's on the landing!

256
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,500
You say this is no kidnapping.
You say you mean no harm.

257
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Then why is it, sir,
you will not unlock the door?

258
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,600
I'm sorry, okay?

259
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,900
I'm sorry about her. I'm...

260
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,500
Look, with all due respect

261
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,600
I can't let you just go running
around free out there, okay?

262
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,500
This is New York City.

263
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,400
It's not such a safe place
anymore.

264
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Look at you.

265
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
You look like some sort
of psychotic escapee

266
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,900
from a Renaissance fair.

267
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
I understand you
have some anxiety

268
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,100
but you have to trust me.

269
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,900
I'm going to get you home, okay?

270
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,000
I promise.

271
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Bart!

272
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,000
The portal opens up again
next week. Monday.

273
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
I know that, because it was
my back-up

274
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,400
in case I didn't make it last night.

275
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,700
It's on a cycle, you know?
Kind of like, uh...

276
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,000
total eclipse.

277
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,200
Once every 20 years.
You understand?

278
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,700
Generally,
I understand everything.

279
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,700
Since I've met you, nothing.

280
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,300
I can only assume
I'm in a nightmare

281
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,700
brought on by agita,
or else I am dead.

282
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,500
You're not dead.

283
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,800
Come here. Sit down.

284
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,600
Here.

285
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,800
Want some milk in yours?

286
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Bart, can I just have...

287
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,900
Sorry. He's really
got to go out.

288
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,300
I'd be honored
if you took a look at those.

289
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,700
I'll explain everything
when I get back.

290
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,900
He's got to go out
or he'll drop a bomb in there.

291
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Come on. Let's go.

292
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Back in five.

293
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,300
One quick trip to Spectra, Bart

294
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,300
and you and I will be Nobel...

295
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,300
Laureates.

296
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,400
Come on, Bart.

297
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,600
Hey, let's go.

298
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Come on. Let's go!

299
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Oh, Jesus!

300
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Good boy, Bart!

301
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Stay!

302
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,800
Stay, Bart. Stay!

303
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Oh, Bart, please stay!

304
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Stuart, you forgot
the pointy thing!

305
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Stuart...

306
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,000
Look, this is not complex.

307
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
He gave me the Palm Pilot

308
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
but he forgot
the pointy thing.

309
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,900
- I've been warned about you.
- Oh. Really?

310
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,700
And what, pray tell
did the great disappointment say?

311
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,900
That you were dangerous,
though you hardly look it.

312
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,500
- Oh, really?
- A lady in trousers isn't dangerous, merely plain.

313
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,100
- I take it you're a career woman.
- Yeah, market research.

314
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,700
Fine avocation
for women, research.

315
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,700
Perfect for the feminine mind.

316
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,200
You're a trip, Lionel.

317
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,100
I myself once courted
a librarian in Sussex.

318
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,700
Oh.

319
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Good for you.

320
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,600
I must confess, I feel as though
we've met on a previous occasion.

321
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,100
Well, Lionel, seeing as I've never
met a single friend of Stuart's-

322
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm not even sure
he's ever had any-

323
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I really don't see
how that's possible.

324
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,400
Oh, man! Bart!

325
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,100
He just made Lake Erie
out there.

326
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,800
You just can't toss a dog
out into the hall like that.

327
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,800
- You can't do that.
- I assure you, I did not.

328
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,700
Let's go.

329
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,700
- I beg your pardon?
- Come on. Let's go!

330
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,000
Look, pal, I don't care
how many elevators you've got.

331
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,900
This one's in my building.

332
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,300
Hang on a second.

333
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,600
Sorry about
the elevator, Miss Kate.

334
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,200
I've got them
on the phone right now.

335
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,300
Hey, Gracy. This is Lionel,
Stuart's friend.

336
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,200
How do you do?

337
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Ten minutes?
I need someone here right now.

338
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,400
- Watch it, man.
- I beg your pardon.

339
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,100
Hey, what are you doing?

340
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,500
You need to be going
that way.

341
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,400
There's an electron... Hello?

342
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,500
- There's an electronics store.
- I'm sorry, miss.

343
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,600
There's a patch of grass
across the street.

344
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,900
Take him there.
He'll do his business.

345
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Can you give this to Stuart, please?
It's his cable bill.

346
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,100
They haul our furniture
and cradle our children

347
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,700
but this morning, from
the Battery to the Bronx

348
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,700
elevators have mysteriously...

349
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,800
So sorry.

350
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,800
- Stupid!
- I do beg your pardon.

351
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,100
I beg your pardon.

352
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Are you going to remove that?

353
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,100
I beg your pardon?

354
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,100
Pick it up
and put it in the trash.

355
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,300
Absolutely not.

356
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,400
Maybe you don't understand.

357
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,600
It's against the law
to leave it there.

358
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Are you suggesting, madam,
there exists a law

359
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,100
compelling gentlemen to lay hold
of canine bowel movements?

360
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,100
I'm suggesting you pick the poop up
and throw it away now.

361
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,600
I refuse. Respectfully.

362
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,900
All right.

363
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,600
What's your name, fancy pants?

364
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,800
Leopold...

365
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,600
Alexis Elija...

366
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Walker Thomas Garrett

367
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Mountbatten.

368
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,500
All right, Stuart.

369
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Have a nice day.

370
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,900
I appreciate you putting in
a good word for me

371
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,500
but J.J.'s not back from London.

372
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,400
Right. Bye.

373
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,200
- What's with the elevators?
- It's happening everywhere.

374
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,600
Darci.

375
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Last page.

376
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,600
Did everyone live
happily ever after?

378
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,600
He lost his leg to gangrene
waiting for her on the island.

379
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,400
But they're together now.

380
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Wonderful.

381
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
- Oh, look, you got your Palm Pilot back.
- A nightmare.

382
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,300
Okay, so who do I owe?

383
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,400
Okay, Bobby at Hasbro,
Reeves at Crunch.

384
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,100
And the finals came in
for "Love for Sale."

385
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,700
The call with the studio is
at 4:00.

386
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,400
The margarine thing's in 15
in the conference room.

387
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,000
And J.J. wants to talk
to you before that.

388
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Oh, and one more thing.

389
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,400
I remember that you told me
to start thinking ahead

390
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,700
so I know your brother's
getting back

391
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,900
from his retreat tomorrow

392
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,700
and if you want something
in the fridge...

393
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,300
- Darci...
- Mm-hmm?

394
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,800
Can you tell me
why I'm upset right now?

395
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,000
Because, uh...

396
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
J.J. called this morning.
That is why I have a cell phone.

397
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,700
- So you can call me...
- Kate, Kate, he didn't call.

398
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,600
He just popped his head in here
and spoke two sentences.

399
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,800
So he's back?

400
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,600
Margo says he's going to make
a big announcement

401
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,500
about the merger next week.

402
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,200
Margo? What does she know?

403
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,800
How does she know
anything about anything?

404
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Oh. All right. So he
popped his head in here.

405
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,100
All right, so you have to tell
me exactly what he said, Darci.

406
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,800
You have to start
at the beginning and tell me...

407
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,800
He said, "Tell Kate I'm going
to sit in on Farmer's Bounty."

408
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,700
J.J.

409
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,200
Good morning, Kate.

410
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,700
Good morning.

411
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,700
I'll see you in there.

412
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,700
Good Lord, it still stands.

413
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,400
The world has changed
all around it

414
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,400
but Roebling's erection
still stands!

415
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,600
That, my friend, is a miracle.

416
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,400
- What?
- It's a miracle, man!

417
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,700
It's a bridge.

418
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,700
Tell me... when did they
adapt it for steam engines?

419
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,700
The fire brigade.

420
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,900
I don't know how it happened.

421
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,000
I found him in a shaft.

422
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,300
Stuart!

423
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,500
Leopold, what are you doing
out here?

424
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Get back inside!

425
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,600
They're taking him
to Goodman Memorial.

426
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,200
"Fresh creamery butter."

427
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,400
"Is there anything
more comforting?"

428
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,100
"There is,
and I know you will agree"

429
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,700
"when you try Farmer's Bounty"

430
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,700
"with the essence of real butter
in every bite."

431
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,000
Your first choice.

432
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,900
However, 45% of our demo
circled "shifty"

433
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,500
as his key descriptor.
Not good.

434
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,900
"This is what I say."

435
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,800
"Everybody should be trying
Farmer's Bounty"

436
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,300
"with the real, rich, creamy
taste of real butter."

437
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,800
"Try it, and you will be losing
pounds. Poof! Boom! Voila!"

438
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,100
Your second choice.

439
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,100
Unfortunately, the group found
him obnoxious, abrasive

440
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,100
and a whopping 72%
found him just plain creepy.

441
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,600
The spot rolls out in four days.
We have to shoot...

442
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,800
The product is shipping,
what the hell am I supposed to do?

443
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,600
We have to do
another session, tomorrow.

444
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,900
I had my assistant book the
response room at National

445
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,900
so we can decide then and there.

446
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,000
Kate, are you all right?

447
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,400
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

448
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,000
Geez, Kate, I'd ask for a decaf.

449
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,800
Monica, I need you
to call Barney's.

450
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,900
I need a white blouse,
size small

451
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,900
in Kate's office by lunch.

452
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Oh, dear.

453
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,600
"Hi, you've reached Stuart."

454
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,800
"Please leave a message."

455
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,600
Leopold? Leopold, look,
don't be frightened.

456
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,100
This is Stuart, okay?

457
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
I see it is Bell's talking telegraph.

458
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,000
I saw a prototype
at last year's fair.

459
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,800
I need you to pick up
the handset, Leo.

460
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,800
You pick up the green handset,
because I need to talk to you...

461
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,900
Are-are you there?

462
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
- Hello?
- Leopold, thank God.

463
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,400
Listen, they're taking me
to X-Rays.

464
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,600
Everything's going to be fine
but you have to stay in the apartment.

465
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,900
Do you understand me?

466
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,500
Oh, Stuart,
I saw Roebling's bridge today.

467
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,200
I saw it... complete.

468
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,900
Yes, yes, but listen to me.

469
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,000
You can't go out again.

470
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,200
You have to stay
in the apartment.

471
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,700
Stay in the apartment?
For how long?

472
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,900
Leo, I'll be back tonight.

473
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,200
I promise-
no more field trips.

474
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,100
Would you...

475
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,800
Hel... hello?

476
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Stuart? Hello?

477
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Blast!

478
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,100
Hello.

479
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,300
Hello. Who are you?

480
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,800
Hector. My mom works late
on Wednesdays

481
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,800
so I watch TV with Stuart.

482
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,900
Want some Pirate's Booty?

483
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,000
Hang on.

484
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,600
Excuse me, J.J., I wanted
to thank you for the shirt.

485
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,800
That was very nice.

486
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,000
Come in, come in.

487
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,800
Yeah. Uh-huh.

488
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,600
Absolutely.

489
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,900
Oh, good, good.

490
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,100
Yeah, she's here right now.
I'll tell her.

491
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,400
Okay... okay.
Bye.

492
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
Sit down.

493
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,500
That was Barry.

494
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,100
He was thrilled with your work
at the screening last night.

495
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Oh, good. Good.

496
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,100
You're a rarity
among women, Kate.

497
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,700
I'm sorry?

498
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,100
You don't cling to illusion.

499
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,100
You don't get caught up
in emotion.

500
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,100
You don't do pretty.

501
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,600
I don't?

502
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,500
You skew male.
You're like a man.

503
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,500
A man who understands women-
their desires, their needs.

504
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,600
You understand them
but you're not really one of them.

505
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
- You don't mind my being frank, do you?
- No. I don't. No.

506
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Endamame?

507
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,100
Kate?

508
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,800
One day, he lowered
the Jolly Roger

509
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,300
- Stu?
- and set sail in search

510
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,800
of another kind of treasure.

511
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Not money, not jewels,
not gold...

512
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,400
but a bride.

513
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,800
Despite his being a ruffian
of the brine

514
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,300
fearless in his plunder

515
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,500
and merciless with the sword

516
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,500
the Pirate King
was also lonely.

517
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,100
You see,
he had never met a lady.

518
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,300
He never met a girl?

519
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,300
No. Not a girl, not a lady,
not even his own mother.

520
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,000
- So what happened?
- As with all comedies

521
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,600
the most ridiculous thing
imaginable- the Pirate King

522
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,000
fell in love with
the major general's daughter.

523
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,600
I had the good fortune to see
the premiere last month

524
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,000
at the Fifth Avenue Theatre.

525
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Since when is
Penzance at the Fifth?

526
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,000
Is it your habit, sir

527
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,400
to simply enter a conversation
without introduction?

528
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,900
Whoa, you are deep in it.

529
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,400
It's cool. I'm an actor, too.

530
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm Charlie. I live downstairs.

531
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,600
Kate McKay,
senior vice president.

532
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,500
Darci, it hasn't happened.

533
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,100
All he did
was dangle a carrot.

534
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,300
Until he makes a decision

535
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,600
the pressure's doubled.

536
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,800
When's he going
to make a decision?

537
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,100
We're having dinner tomorrow
to discuss it further

538
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,200
at Commune.

539
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,500
- Kate?
- Yeah.

540
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,900
- I have Stuart on the line.
- No!

541
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,500
- He says he's in the hospital.
- No!

542
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,900
Leopold is just sitting alone
in my apartment right now.

543
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,300
God knows what could happen
to him.

544
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,500
Do you know he got outside today?

545
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,100
Of course he did-
I made him walk your dog.

546
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,300
What? No, Kate,
you can't do that!

547
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,500
He can't go outside!

548
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,800
Jesus Christ, Kate.

549
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,300
He's from 1876, Kate.

550
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,600
He doesn't know our customs.

551
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,100
If something were
to happen to him

552
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,300
- it could be catastrophic.
- Shh!

553
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,600
If he doesn't go back

554
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,800
to April 28, 1876,
he doesn't get married

555
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,700
he doesn't have children,
and you want to know what?

556
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,600
What happened
with the elevators today, well

557
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,100
that's going to seem
like a walk in the park.

558
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,200
Stuart! This is embarrassing.

559
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
It's embarrassing now,
all right?

560
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,700
Someone has to keep
an eye on him.

561
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,400
Stuart, he's a grown man.

562
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,200
He's a grown man. He's fine.

563
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,700
He can take care of himself.

564
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,500
- No. Wait. Aah!
- I'm going.

565
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,000
Kate, please.

566
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Just take this to Spectra, okay?

567
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Get it developed.

568
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,500
You'll see I'm telling
the truth.

569
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,300
Tell Manny it's important.

570
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,400
You want double prints?

571
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
That's not funny, Kate.

572
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,000
This is not a joke.

573
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,800
You need help, Stuart.

574
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,800
You need help.

575
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,700
Charlie?

576
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,600
Hey, Kate!

577
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,000
Can I see you downstairs
for a minute?

578
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,400
I invited someone to dinner.

579
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,500
He's up there all alone.

580
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,900
Stuart's in the hospital.

581
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,500
I didn't think you'd
have such a problem...

582
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,600
No, you didn't think, Charlie.
You didn't think.

583
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,300
You came home early,
one day early from actor camp.

584
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,400
Okay, it's not actor camp

585
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,200
and yeah, I came home
a day early, all right?

586
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,000
There was this tai chi
broad who kept trying

587
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,700
- stick her fingers...
- No, this is the point.

588
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,000
You immediately march upstairs

589
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,200
to my ex-boyfriend's apartment

590
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,800
and you invite
his freakish friend...

591
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,900
See, that's what it's about.

592
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,900
It's not that
I went up there.

593
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,300
It's that it was
your ex-boyfriend...

594
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
No, it's not about Stuart.

595
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,300
- Greetings, Kate, Charles.
- Hey, Leo.

596
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,600
Be nice.

597
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
So, when's Stuart getting back?

598
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,400
Couple of days, maybe a week.

599
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,500
He promised me that he would
return late this evening.

600
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,100
Well, maybe he will, Leopold.

601
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,100
He's so big on keeping
his promises.

602
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,100
May I have the next course?

603
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,000
There is no next course.

604
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,700
Where I come from, the meal...

605
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,700
is the result of reflection and study.

606
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,900
Menus are prepared in advance

607
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,500
timed to perfection.

608
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,300
It is said,
without the culinary arts

609
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,300
the crudeness of reality
would be unbearable.

610
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,600
We had a saying
in the McKay house:

611
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,200
"You shake and shake
the ketchup bottle.

612
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,200
None will come,
and then a lot'll."

613
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,800
What is that?

614
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,000
- I beg your pardon?
- Why are you standing?

615
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm accustomed to stand
when a lady leaves the table.

616
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,000
Tell me, Charles

617
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,200
when Stuart and your
sister were engaged

618
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,300
did you happen to read

619
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,100
his papers on
the temporal universe?

620
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,700
I spent the morning perusing
them, and must confess...

621
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,600
Stuart and I were never engaged.

622
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Not even close.

623
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,200
But I did read...

624
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
Thank you.

625
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,100
But I did read his papers, however,
to show support.

626
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,700
Is Stuart still trying
to make a time machine?

627
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,200
That's the beauty of it
he discovered no machine was necessary.

628
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,300
All one had to do was
to develop formulae to forecast portals-

629
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,300
natural windows
in the fabric of time.

630
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,300
Apparently, Stuart located one
utilizing modern...

631
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,000
Utilizing modern theories
of weather prediction.

632
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,800
What's a portal?

633
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,300
An opening which exists
for but a moment.

634
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,300
This explains why one must
jump through it from a height-

635
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,600
in order to achieve
the required velocity.

636
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,000
The speed of gravity,
to be exact.

637
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,500
It's quite brilliant.

638
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,900
You are so method.

639
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,800
You don't even break
for a second, do you?

640
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
It's unbelievable!

641
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,200
Oh, stop it, please!

642
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,600
No more! Stop, please?

643
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,800
I beg you. I'm tired.

644
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,700
Can you go away?
Can you just go away?

645
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,100
Can you go away?

646
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,400
She's drunk, Leo.

647
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,900
Oh, shut up, Charlie!

648
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,300
And you, can you go upstairs?
Can you go away?

649
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,900
I am truly sorry if I have
offended you in any way.

650
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,900
Goodnight, Charles.

651
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Goodnight, Leo.

652
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,900
What the hell was that?

653
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,500
He thinks he's from
the 19th century, Charlie.

654
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
He thinks he's a duke.

655
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,000

- I know. Isn't that cool?

656
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,500
Kate, he's in character.
He is an actor.

657
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,600
Oh, really? For what show?

658
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,300
You know that just because someone
doesn't have a paying gig

659
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,300
it doesn't mean they're not
working on their craft.

660
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,300
What's going on here?

661
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,600
I think there's something wrong
with his, uh...

662
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,600
thing.

663
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,300
Give me that telephone.

664
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,600
No.

665
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,100
- Give it to me.
- No, I need to...

666
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,400
What do you expect me to do?
You took away my cell phone.

667
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,100
They're not allowed
on hospital property.

668
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,300
I have to make a phone call!

669
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,100
You're not going
to make one now.

670
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,700
No, no, you don't understand.
This is a very important phone call.

671
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,000
I have to leave this hospital now.
I can't be here anymore.

672
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,100
Mr. Besser,
I'm tired of telling you this.

673
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,800
You are not going nowhere

674
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,800
until Dr. Feinstein signs
your release!

675
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,800
Did you ever take any
earth science, Esther, hmm?

676
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,500
You look like a smart woman.

677
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,700
Ever hear of the
time-space continuum?

678
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,800
Sounds important, doesn't it?
Well, it is.

679
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,100
And you want to know
something, Esther?

680
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,400
It's broken! Okay?

681
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,100
And I'm the only guy
who can fix it.

682
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,900
So why don't you
go down the hall there

683
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,500
and get on your
little telephone

684
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,600
and call Dr. Feinstein...

685
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
Goodnight, Mr. Besser.

686
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,000
You tell him that...

687
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You tell him that I...

688
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,100
Point the toes,
pull your shoulders back.

689
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,100
Take a deep breath in

690
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:27,100
and then exhale
into downward-facing dog.

691
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,000
Oh, be quiet!

692
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Be quiet... oh!

693
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,900
Bart, shut up!

694
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,100
That thing is a damned hazard!

695
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,000
It's just a toaster!

696
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,500
Well, insertion of bread
into that so-called toaster

697
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,900
produces no toast at all-

698
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,000
merely warm bread!

699
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,900
Inserting the bread twice
produces charcoal.

700
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,300
So, clearly, to make proper toast
it requires 1 1/2 insertions

701
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,300
which is something for which
the apparatus doesn't begin to allow!

702
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,800
One assumes

703
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,600
that when the General of Electric
built it

704
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,700
he might have tried using it.

705
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,100
One assumes the General might
take pride in his creations

706
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,400
instead of just foisting them
on an unsuspecting public.

707
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,200
You know something?

708
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,100
Nobody gives a rat's ass

709
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,700
that you have to push
the toast down twice.

710
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,300
You know why?

711
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,000
Because everybody
pushes their toast down twice!

712
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,800
Not where I come from.

713
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,000
Oh, because where you come from

714
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,700
toast is the result
of reflection and study.

715
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,600
Yes, you mock me.
But perhaps one day,

716
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,700
when you've awoken from a
pleasant slumber

717
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,400
to the scent of a warm brioche

718
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,100
smothered in marmalade
and fresh creamery butter

719
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,200
you'll understand that life

720
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,200
is not solely comprised
of tasks, but tastes.

721
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Say that again.

722
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,000
Pardon me?

723
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,900
- Did they start yet?
- Yes.

724
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,700
Session list.

725
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,500
Leopold, Darci.
Darci, Leopold.

726
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,800
I'd like him to read.
Can you tack him on at the end?

727
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,400
And, Leopold, go with Darci.

728
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,000
She'll take you to the greenroom
and explain everything.

729
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,700
I need to work out.
I need a place I can work out.

730
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,500
If I could get Mr. Duke?
Is he ready? Where is he?

731
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,900
Oh, my God, look at this.
Let's skip this one.

732
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,300
Mr. Duke.
Right here on the floor.

733
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,600
Excuse me, that's your marker, right there.
Just stand on that tape line.

734
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,500
Look, forget this guy.
I can't waste any more time, J.J.

735
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,000
We need to make
a decision now.

736
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
All right, we've got
plenty of good choices.

737
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,800
Let's cut it off, Kate.

738
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,700
That would be a mistake, J.J.

739
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,900
Kate, the client wants
to move on.

740
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,400
We should see this last guy.

741
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,400
It'll... Two minutes!

742
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,100
I think he looks like
the Quaker Oats guy.

743
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,700
Well, Phil, it's really not
about what you think.

744
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,200
It's about what they think.

745
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,700
They've been in a coma all day
and now look at them.

746
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,700
To them, this guy is a dream.

747
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,900
He's handsome,
honest, courteous.

748
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,900
Stands when you
walk in a room.

749
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,800
Brings you brioche in bed.

750
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,600
If you eat his margarine

751
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,700
maybe your hips will shrink

752
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,200
and he'll come to your door.

753
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,700
I take it this is to be
delivered in direct address

754
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,400
as on Geronimo.

755
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,800
Geronimo?

756
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,400
He means Geraldo.

757
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,100
Exactly.

758
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,400
Okay, everyone- quiet please.

759
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,400
And action.

760
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,900
Start talking, bud.

761
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,500
Fresh creamery butter.

762
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,900
Is there anything
more comforting?

763
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,500
I say there is.

764
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,500
And perhaps you'll agree when you sample
fat-free Farmer's Bounty

765
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,200
with the genuine essence
of creamery butter

766
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,100
in every bite.

767
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,900
With every mouthful
of Farmer's Bounty

768
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,900
you shall receive butter's
luxurious comfort in your mouth

769
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,100
without adding to the luxury
of your waistline.

770
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,100
Not bad, Kate.

771
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Where'd you find him?

772
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,700
He lives in my building.

773
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,500
- Where do I sign?
- Right here, and here.

774
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,300
Oh! Hi.

775
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,200
That was spectacular, Kate.

776
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,200
- Thanks, J.J.
- A lot to talk about tonight at dinner.

777
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,100
- Nice work, Mr. Margarine.
- Thank you.

778
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,800
Outfit was a great idea. Nice.

779
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

780
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,800
You seem pleased.

781
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,300
Oh, you did so great in there!

782
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,000
Man!

783
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You are going to be on
a national television spot!

784
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,700
I take it you're dining
with that man tonight.

785
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,700
Huh? Oh, yeah, J.J.
He's my boss.

786
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,600
You require a chaperone.
His intentions are obvious.

787
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,500
Oh, I'm alone with you.
Do I need a chaperone?

788
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,200
We're not courting, Kate.
If we were, as a man of honor

789
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,200
I would have informed you
of my intentions in writing.

790
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,900
Good day.

791
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,600
- Hey!
- Kate, why don't we take one of these.

792
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,700
They're for tourists.

793
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,100
Sorry, she doesn't
seem interested.

794
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,100
Oh, hey, hello. Hello.

795
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,800
Hey! Hey, you...

796
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,700
Kate!

797
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,700
Hey, you asshole!

798
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,500
I'm gonna get you!

799
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,900
Asshole!

800
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,900
Goddamn it.

801
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,800
Give me your hand.

802
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,700
What?

803
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,700
Your hand, woman!

804
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,800
Yah! Yah!

805
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,700
What do you think you're doing?

806
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:06,100
Whoa, hey!

807
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,500
Yah!

808
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,300
I warn you, scoundrel

809
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,400
I was trained to ride
at King's Academy

810
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,600
and schooled in weaponry by the
palace guard. You stand no chance.

811
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,700
Where you run, I shall ride
and when you stop,

812
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,700
the steel of this strap
will be lodged in your brain.

813
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,600
Your boyfriend's
a very good rider.

814
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,600
Yeah.

815
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,200
Are you for real?

816
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,100
Pardon me?

817
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,200
Are you for real?

818
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,100
I believe so.

819
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,500
You're a duke.

820
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,700
I was born a duke.

821
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,700
I've never felt like one.

822
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,000
Stay. Sit.

823
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
On your feet. Stay.

824
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:10,300
Stay. Good boy.

825
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,600
I'm off to dinner.

826
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,800
What are you two doing?

827
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,300
I don't know. Maybe we'll...

828
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,900
watch the rest of the game
or go out or something.

829
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,800
Oh, thank you.

830
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Kate, may I repeat my offer
to serve as a chaperone?

831
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,300
No, thank you, Leopold.

832
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,200
Charles, don't you
find this inappropriate?

833
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,400
- As her brother, I would think...
- As her brother, I would think

834
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,000
that my sister would invite me
to an audition.

835
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,500
Could be just me, though.
Seems kind, but...

836
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,400
- Charlie.
- Hmm?

837
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,900
You're not exactly
a margarine spokesperson.

838
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,400
- I can't sell butter, Kate?
- I don't mean to be insulting...

839
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,000
It's insulting. I'm an actor.
You don't have faith in me to sell butter?

840
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,200
- No. No. I'm sorry.
- I can do British, Kate.

841
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,100
- I'm an actor. I can be anybody!
- You're a very, very good actor.

842
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,500
- I am a good actor.
- You are.

843
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,000
Okay, fine, all right.

844
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
A Victorian dude who's never
seen a Mets game watching TV.

845
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,000
Scene: I say, are those little people
in that box of phosphorous?

846
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,400
Why, crikey! I believe it is!

847
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,800
This game's more
beguiling than cricket!

848
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,900
Indian: Good golly, oh, Jesus!

849
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,400
It looks like Mike Piazza
just hit a game!

850
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,600
How about Canadian?

851
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,400
Oh, right on.

852
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,400
Right on, you like butter, huh?
Yeah, what's that about?

853
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,500
Good night

854
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,400
Good night.

855
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,100
...all those people
up in that stadium.

856
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,900
Know what they probably could go for?
Some margarine!

857
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,600
When your friend walked in
in that outfit

858
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,000
I was getting a little
nervous for you there.

859
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,700
"If you eat his margarine,
maybe your hips will shrink."

860
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,700
It's brilliant. You saved Phil
from his own ambivalence.

861
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,500
I knew it was the way to go-
in my gut.

862
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,700
I'm counting on that gut.

863
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,200
Can I get a bottle of your '95 Lynch-Bages
and a bottle of Evian?

864
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,700
I'll tell you one thing:
your friend

865
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,900
is going to be bigger than Mr. Whipple.

866
00:52:58,900 --> 00:52:59,800
Thanks.

867
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,800
You're not sleeping with him,
are you?

868
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,700
No

869
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,700
No.

870
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,600
Leo. Leo, come on. Come here.

871
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,600
How's it going, man?

872
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,400
See the girl with
the long brown hair?

873
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,700
That's Patrice.

874
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,800
She's lovely.

875
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,200
She's mine.

876
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,200
Congratulations.

877
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,100
Hey, everybody, this is Leo!

878
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,800
Leo, this is everybody.

879
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,500
What's up? Dennis.

880
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,300
Shelby, Allison, Monica.

881
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,800
And this, this is

882
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,500
the insatiable Patrice.

883
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,700
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.

884
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,000
- Hey.
- How do you do?

885
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,400
- Patrice, let me assist you.
- Thanks.

886
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,000
You got it?

887
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I was going to get it.

888
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,500
Let me get that for you.

889
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,200
There you go.

890
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,900
You look nice tonight. Very...

891
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,800
Like a Judy Blume book.

892
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,900
That's good, because I thought for a moment
that body of water here

893
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,000
was a moat.

894
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,200
No, that's a pond.

895
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,700
The gardens are devastating.

896
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,500
They are. They're very,
very beautiful.

897
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,300
You'll have to come
and see them firsthand.

898
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,400
Right, right.

899
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,600
After the merger I'm going to be stuck
over there, setting things up.

900
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,600
I'll be craving a little face time
from my new top honcho in New York.

901
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,500
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you should come visit.

902
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,900
- I'll fly you over for the weekend.
- Oh, yeah, I heard that, but the...

903
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,300
the other part,
the part before that.

904
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,300
The part about the top honcho.

905
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,400
I didn't understand that,
that part.

906
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,800
How about catching an opera
Saturday?

907
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,100
La Boheme's at the Met.

908
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,600
Okay, so she comes back-
the audience is about to leave-

909
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,900
she comes back on stage

910
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,400
and she starts squirting the audience
with this turkey baster

911
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,000
filled with this pine mist.

912
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,500
And she's screaming
"Un-sex me! Un-sex me!"

913
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,700
But no tears.

914
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,100
Just raw human passion.

915
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,100
Isn't... Willem Dafoe
part of that group?

916
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,100
Yeah, and he did this monologue
about how

917
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,600
all the best things in life are
hidden in people's basements.

918
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,600
Like the Louvre.

919
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,800
I'm sorry.
You were saying, Charles?

920
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,500
- Just...
- No, what about the Louvre?

921
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,800
Tell us what you
were going to say.

922
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,700
Well, only a fraction of
the Louvre is on the walls.

923
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,600
- The rest is in the basement.
- You've been in the basement of the Louvre?

924
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,300
Oh, yes.

925
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,900
I was an art history major
at Vassar.

926
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,300
And so, what's down there?

927
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,400
Well, that's where
the real show begins.

928
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,300
Unspoiled by dilettante.

929
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:02,300
Da Vinci, Michelangelo,
David, Chardin.

930
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,500
"Allow me to assist you, Patrice."

931
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,700
"Oh, let me light that
for you, Monica."

932
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,000
"What, this?"

933
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
"This is my family crest."

934
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,300
"Been in the family for..."
"Oh, in the basement?"

935
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,600
"What do they have in the basement?
Why, the works of da Vinci"

936
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,600
"Michelangelo, Chardin, David"

937
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,600
"all surrounded by great coral
sponges to absorb the moisture."

938
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,600
Just for the record, I was working it.
I was in the zone

939
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,300
and I would have
gotten her number

940
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,200
if you hadn't turned
the evening

941
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,600
into a guided tour
of the Louvre.

942
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,900
My apologies.

943
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,900
Let's get
one thing straight.

944
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,900
Patrice, she thought
you were cute -

945
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,700
probably gay and cute.

946
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,800
And cute, Leo,
that's the kiss of death.

947
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,300
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps? Certainly.

948
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,200
I believe this is her number.

949
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,900
As I see it, Patrice has not
an inkling of your affections.

950
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,000
And it's no wonder.

951
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,500
You, Charles,
are a merry-andrew.

952
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,600
A what?

953
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,200
Everything plays a farce to you.

954
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,400
Women respond to sincerity.

955
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,500
This requires pulling one's
tongue from one's cheek.

956
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,900
No one wants to be
romanced by a buffoon.

957
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,300
Now, that number rings her.

958
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,800
- Yes?
- So ring her tomorrow.

959
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,100
I can't. She gave
the number to you.

960
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:18,000
Only because I told her
of your affections.

961
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Wha-What did you say?

962
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,700
Merely that you admired her but
you were hesitant to make an overture

963
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,200
since you'd been told
she was courting another.

964
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,900
Shit. That's good!

965
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,400
Wha-What did she say?

966
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,400
She handed me the napkin.

967
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,800
Charles, it's quite late.

968
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,600
No, no, no,
she won't be home yet.

969
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,500
I get her machine,
I leave a message.

970
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,800
Ball's in her court.

971
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,800
You're ladling calculation
upon comedy.

972
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,800
The point is,
to keep the ball in your court.

973
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,700
You're right. You're right.

974
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,900
Okay.

975
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,600
Nothing need be done
till tomorrow.

976
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,100
Tomorrow.
Then I make my move.

977
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,000
An overture, Charles.

978
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,800
Make your intentions known.

979
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,800
Think of pleasing her,
not vexing her.

980
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,100
No vexing.

981
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,300
You're intoxicated.
We should retire.

982
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,900
I'm sure Kate will be home.

983
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,200
I doubt it.

984
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,200
But it's nearly midnight.

985
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,800
You like her, don't you?

986
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,500
- Who?
- Kate.

987
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,100
- You do!
- Oh, Charles, stop.

988
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,100
You like my sister!

989
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,000
Well, you made your
intentions known, right?

990
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,600
- Right?
- You've been drinking.

991
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,500
Leo, Commune is right
around the corner.

992
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,000
We could stop in, you could
give me a couple of pointers

993
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,100
pull out a chair or two,
you could throw out a gesture here or there.

994
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,000
Yeah, see, it's one thing with Patrice.
You don't give a shit.

995
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
It's a whole other ball of wax
when it's a girl you like, huh?

996
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,500
Yeah, who's
the merry-andrew now?

997
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,300
You want to vex my sister!

998
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:56,300
I have to confess that
I'm a little bit confused...

999
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,200
No. Thank you.

1000
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,500
When you asked me to dinner tonight
I was under the impression that...

1001
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,500
- we were here to discuss...
- The merger.

1002
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,400
Yes. Right. Yes.

1003
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,300
And a possible promotion.

1004
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,100
Yes.

1005
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,100
Yes, that, too.

1006
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:15,000
And, well, dinner
is winding down

1007
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,700
and we haven't
really discussed

1008
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,900
anything even remotely relevant to

1009
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,500
what I thought we came here to...

1010
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,400
I don't believe I've ever
seen you this flustered, Kate.

1011
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,400
You haven't even kissed me yet.

1012
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,900
Yeah.
Right. Well...

1013
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,600
I like you, J.J., I do.

1014
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,000
I like you quite a bit.

1015
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,300
As a matter of fact...

1016
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,500
I think you would agree
that a working...

1017
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,200
a successful
working relationship

1018
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,700
requires a great deal of...

1019
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,500
- What exactly is our working relationship?
- Kate...

1020
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,200
Hi, Kate!

1021
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,100
Hi, Charlie.

1022
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,500
Wha... what are you doing here?

1023
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,400
- We just thought we'd come by to say hi.
- Kate?

1024
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,700
- J.J., right?
- Right.

1025
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,800
Might I have a word with you?

1026
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,000
- Now?
- In private.

1027
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,300
No! No.

1028
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,000
Mr. Margarine.

1029
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Please... please join us.

1030
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,700
And where did you say it is?

1031
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,300
- In Sussex.
- Near Balmore.

1032
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,500
- Yes.
- Built in the 18th century.

1033
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,000
Early 18th century.

1034
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,900
Early? Are you quite sure?

1035
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,000
Yes.

1036
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,600
He's got pictures, Leopold.

1037
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,700
Perhaps you were swindled,
because I can assure you

1038
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,200
as of the late 19th century

1039
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,300
there's nothing
but farmland near Balmore.

1040
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,400
- You're mistaken.
- That's not possible.

1041
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,200
Well, it's quite possible,
Leopold, that you are mistaken.

1042
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,000
No, it is not possible...

1043
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,400
Balmore is the only manor house
in the county.

1044
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,800
- I know because I grew up there.
- Leopold, it wasn't...

1045
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,300
Leo, do you enjoy opera?

1046
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,400
- I do. And do you?
- Oh, yes.

1047
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,000
It keeps... keeps me alive.

1048
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,300
Do you have a favorite?

1049
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,500
Bohme. La Bohme.

1050
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,400
- La Bohme?
- I've seen it 12 times.

1051
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,100
That's... that's how
I learned to speak French.

1052
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,100
- You speak French?
- Fluently.

1053
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,000
Que ton visage est doux

1054
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
entour par la lumire
de la lune.

1055
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,200
What did he say?

1056
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,600
"How sweet your face looks

1057
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,600
gently encircled
by the soft moonlight."

1058
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,500
Oh, I like that.

1059
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,800
From the opening scene of Bohme.
A stunning duet.

1060
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,400
- Andre sings it to Mimi.
- Andre...

1061
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,900
I invited Kate to the Met next week.
She's never been.

1062
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,800
Patrone is singing Andre,
and she turned me down.

1063
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,800
Can you explain that, Leopold?

1064
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,400
Well...

1065
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,400
Bohme is one of man's great achievements
and should not be missed.

1066
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:44,000
But perhaps Kate resists
on moral grounds.

1067
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,100
- How so?
- Should we get the check?

1068
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,800
Well, some feel that
to court a woman in one's employ

1069
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,400
is nothing more than
a serpentine effort

1070
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,400
to transform a lady to a whore.

1071
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,500
J.J.

1072
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,600
This guy's charming, Kate.

1073
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,000
The Duke of Margarine
thinks me a serpent.

1074
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,200
- No, he doesn't.
- No, not a serpent.

1075
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,100
That's too grand a word.
Simply a braggart and a cad

1076
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:20,100
who knows less French than I,
if that's possible.

1077
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,500
And by the way

1078
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,900
there's no Andre in
Bohme- it's Rudolfo.

1079
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,200
And though it takes place
in France

1080
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,100
it's rarely played in French,
as it is written in Italian.

1081
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:35,100
Good night.

1082
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,400
Sorry.

1083
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:57,300
Kate, might I have a word?

1084
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,600
- Morning.
- Hi.

1085
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,200
- You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

1086
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,800
- You want to read your paper?
- No, thank you, Charlie.

1087
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,300
I want to go to work

1088
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:05,400
and try and clean up
this mess you made.

1089
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,400
You sure you don't...

1090
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,900
Kate...

1091
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,400
Uh, Kate!

1092
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,200
What?

1093
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,200
I just thought maybe you'd want a...
kiwi for... the subway.

1094
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,200
That's a papaya, Charlie.

1095
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,200
Oh? You're right. Okay.

1096
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,600
But while using the product 80% found

1097
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,600
the product too soft to be...

1098
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,500
effective.

1099
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,300
This, of course, presents

1100
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,800
a conundrum for us marketeers.

1101
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,700
How do we maintain a soft feel
on the exterior

1102
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,600
of a plastic wrap or pack

1103
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,600
while retaining the useful
tensile strength in the sheets?

1104
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,400
Now, I'm going to suggest
to the Summer Soft people

1105
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,900
to scale back to a limited
release of the product...

1106
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,600
<i>Dearest Katherine...</i>

1107
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,000
<i>I behaved as an imbecile
last night</i>

1108
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,600
<i>animated in part by drink,</i>

1109
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,800
<i>in part by your beauty</i>

1110
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,000
<i>and in part
by my own foolish pride.</i>

1111
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,300
<i>And for that
I am profoundly sorry.</i>

1112
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,700
<i>Please accept
as a gesture of apology</i>

1113
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:30,700
<i>a private dinner on the rooftop
tonight at 8 o'clock.</i>

1114
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,100
Okay, where are we
on Farmer's Bounty?

1115
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,900
Kate?

1116
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,900
Care to share with us?

1117
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,700
Farmer's Bounty?

1118
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,700
Where we are?

1119
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,500
Where we are is good.

1120
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,700
Um, as you know, we
found our spokesperson.

1121
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,500
The response room final showed
a 96 in the top two boxes.

1122
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,100
His key female descriptors...

1123
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,000
were "handsome", "romantic"

1124
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,400
with several write-ins
of...

1125
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,400
"What a hunk."

1126
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,800
Great.

1127
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,400
Would you hold this?

1128
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,900
J.J.?

1129
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,200
J.J., hi.

1130
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,300
Um, listen, I just want
to apologize again

1131
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,500
for what happened last night.

1132
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,400
There was no need
for things to get that way.

1133
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,900
I appreciate that.

1134
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:27,200
So... everything's okay?

1135
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,200
Yes, Kate.

1136
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,700
I didn't jump; I fell.

1137
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,700
There's a difference-

1138
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,700
a subtle difference,
but nonetheless a difference.

1139
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,000
Why did you fall, then?

1140
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Because there was no elevator.

1141
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,800
And you feel that
was your fault?

1142
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,700
You know what, I'm sorry.

1143
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:46,200
I got to concede that
you are a very busy man

1144
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,500
and I'm sure there are
plenty of people clamoring

1145
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,500
for your particular
brand of attention.

1146
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,800
Unfortunately,
I am not one of them.

1147
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,300
So if you don't mind, would you
please unlock this door?

1148
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:59,000
I'm concerned you might be
a danger to yourself.

1149
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,500
And in such cases...

1150
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,400
- state law requires...
- Hello?

1151
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,400
Will someone please open this...

1152
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,600
Fuck...

1153
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,000
Everything all right,
Dr. Geisler?

1154
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Yes, Gretchen.
Everything's fine.

1155
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,200
So, Stuart, I'm going to prescribe

1156
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,000
something called Prolixin.

1157
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
It's a mild antipsychotic.
Nothing too strong.

1158
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,500
"I was wondering..."

1159
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,500
"I was wondering if you
would like to accompany me..."

1160
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,300
"If you have a previous engagement,
I understand."

1161
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:43,900
Tonight at 7:00, 7:30.
Please don't be late.

1162
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,300
I got to talk to you
about this, okay?

1163
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,300
'Cause there's some shit here
that just cannot be said.

1164
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,400
Did you assemble
a bouquet for Patrice?

1165
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,000
I'll just get one of these, but look,
you just can't tell a woman she's...

1166
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,700
- "gracefully serene."
- No, no, this one won't do.

1167
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,100
Wha... Why?
What is wrong with this one?

1168
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,800
The orange lily
implies extreme hatred.

1169
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,500
The begonia and lavender
danger and suspicion, respectively.

1170
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,000
Every flower has
a meaning, Charles.

1171
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,500
Might I suggest the amaryllis,

1172
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,000
which declares the recipient
a most splendid beauty.

1173
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Or the cabbage rose.

1174
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:26,200
Darci!

1175
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,400
- What is this?
- It's a reply to Leopold's invitation.

1176
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,000
You're going, right?

1177
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,800
I haven't decided yet.

1178
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,100
Oh, you haven't decided if you want to have
dinner on your rooftop with a duke?

1179
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:41,200
...Who thinks he's from 1876!

1180
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,700
- No! And I would appreciate it if...
- Kate, come on, okay?

1181
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,800
I don't know what this guy did
to piss you off

1182
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,600
but that is the best apology letter
in the history of mankind.

1183
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,600
Just sign it, Kate.
It's 4:30. We'll fax it.

1184
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,100
Kate McKay's office.

1185
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:02,100
They hung up.

1186
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,300
Hi. Is Patrice there?

1187
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,900
Hey, Patrice?

1188
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:10,900
- Hi. It's me, Charlie.
- Hey, Charlie.

1189
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,700
I was just calling to find out

1190
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:16,700
if you got my flowers-
your flowers.

1191
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,000
I was calling to see if you got
the flowers I sent you.

1192
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,800
Yeah, I did.

1193
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,800
And I was just wondering

1194
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,400
if you would like to go
to a movie tonight

1195
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,900
and maybe afterwards perhaps

1196
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,100
accompany me to a dinner?

1197
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,500
I mean, I...

1198
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:34,200
I understand completely
if you're otherwise engaged.

1199
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,700
But, uh, you know,
I just wanted to say that, um...

1200
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:41,700
Yeah?

1201
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:47,500
I wanted to say
that you've, uh...

1202
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
you've made an impression on me.

1203
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,300
And-and it-it's not
just the way you look-

1204
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,500
I mean, which are great.

1205
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:59,300
Your looks are,
you know, top-top shelf.

1206
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:03,300
But, uh...

1207
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:07,500
I don't know, it's, um...

1208
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,500
What?

1209
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,300
You're graceful.

1210
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:18,300
You know, the way you move
and speak.

1211
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,900
I mean, some people have a way with words
and, you know, you... you do.

1212
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,400
The bottom line is, I like you.

1213
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,900
Patrice?

1214
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:40,300
What about 7:00?

1215
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,200
7:00?

1216
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,400
7:00 would be heaven. Okay.

1217
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,600
See you then.

1218
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,900
It worked! It worked cool!

1219
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,100
Who's going out with Patrice?
Charlie's going out with Patrice!

1220
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,300
Over there! Charlie's going over there!

1221
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,300
Oh, better go get ready.
Better go get changed.

1222
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,400
Shouldn't change too much, though

1223
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,400
'cause she likes me for who I am.

1224
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:11,400
- Hey.
- Charlie, you look fantastic.

1225
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1226
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,700
I got a date.
I got to go. Bye.

1227
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:20,700
Bye.

1228
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,200
- Kate?
- Yeah?

1229
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,300
Um, have a good time tonight.

1230
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:32,300
Bye.

1231
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:20,400
My God.

1232
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,300
This is beautiful.

1233
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,300
The very word for which
I was searching.

1234
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,400
May I?

1235
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,600
She was a real romantic, my mom.

1236
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,100
When Prince Charles and Lady Di
got married, she had a party.

1237
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,500
She made crumpets and jam.

1238
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,800
It was like a Super Bowl party,
but for moms.

1239
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,500
She cried for a week.

1240
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,400
I don't know the story
of Prince Charles and Lady Di.

1241
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:09,200
Oh, you don't want to.
It's a cautionary tale. Further proof.

1242
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:13,200
- Of what?
- That you can't live a fairy tale.

1243
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:35,100
I'm not very good with men.

1244
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Perhaps you haven't found
the right one.

1245
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,600
Maybe. Or...

1246
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:50,200
maybe the whole love thing is
just a grown-up version of Santa Claus

1247
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,500
just a myth we've been fed
since childhood

1248
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,500
so we keep buying magazines
and joining clubs

1249
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,500
and doing therapy and
watching movies with hit pop songs

1250
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,300
played over love montages

1251
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,700
all in this pathetic attempt
to explain why our love Santa

1252
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:10,700
keeps getting caught
in the chimney.

1253
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:16,100
Otis always told me
love is a leap.

1254
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:20,100
Lamentably,
I was never inspired to jump.

1255
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,300
By my 30th birthday,
I had, according to my uncle

1256
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,800
become a blemish
on the family name.

1257
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,200
So he brought me to this country

1258
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,000
with the proviso
I marry an American.

1259
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,900
A girl with a
good deal of, um...

1260
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,900
Charm?

1261
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,400
Money. Since my parents died

1262
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,400
our family fortune had become,
shall we say, depleted.

1263
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,500
I would be married now
if I hadn't followed Stuart.

1264
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,500
I was to announce a bride
that night.

1265
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:54,700
Who?

1266
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,700
I don't know.

1267
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,300
Someone.

1268
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:05,300
One of them.

1269
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,700
What are you doing?

1270
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,900
I'm just cleaning up.

1271
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:22,900
Would you do me
the honor of a dance?

1272
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:26,900
Please?

1273
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,600
- I am not much of a dancer.
- You're doing famously, then.

1274
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:18,500
Leopold, this was lovely.

1275
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,700
But I don't know
if I can leap

1276
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,700
even if I am inspired.

1277
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,600
People might think
I'm brave, but I'm not.

1278
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,000
The brave are simply those
with the clearest vision

1279
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,900
of what is before them.

1280
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,800
Glory and danger alike

1281
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,800
and notwithstanding,
go out to meet it.

1282
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,000
Hey.

1283
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,300
Morning, Charles.

1284
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,800
How was your evening
with Patrice?

1285
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:09,700
Good. Nice.

1286
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,600
How was yours?

1287
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,600
Good. Nice.

1288
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,600
So, Leo, don't you think it's
time you tell me who you are?

1289
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,400
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

1290
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:38,400
it's a blast doing
the duke thing with you 24/7 but...

1291
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,100
I don't want to see Kate
go through Stuart: The Sequel.

1292
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,900
I know she seems pretty tough
but she hasn't had it that easy.

1293
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:48,900
She's always getting stuck with people
who don't hold up their end.

1294
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,700
Like me.

1295
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,600
- I just don't...
- I understand, Charles.

1296
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,200
- You do?
- Yes.

1297
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,800
So...

1298
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,800
Who are you?

1299
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:09,200
I am the man
who loves your sister.

1300
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,600
Okay, pour the soap in.

1301
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,300
Shut the lid.

1302
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,900
Push the drawers in.

1303
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,500
Close the door, and
you push this button.

1304
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,600
A word to the wise:

1305
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,000
Don't press that
till she wakes up.

1306
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,100
So she sees you doing it.

1307
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:33,800
How clever.
The proverbial tree in the woods.

1308
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,000
If a man washes a dish
and no one sees it...

1309
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Did it happen?

1310
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:55,100
- A cup of coffee, my dear.
- Thank you.

1311
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,800
Breakfast?

1312
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:09,200
Nine-grain toast with strawberries
and mascarpone, Madame.

1313
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,800
It's apparently low...

1314
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,800
in polyunsaturates.

1315
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,800
It's really good.

1316
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,800
It's good.

1317
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:40,100
What should we do today?

1318
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:47,400
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

1319
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,400
Thank you. No.

1320
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,300
You know what makes me happy?
You don't look good in those.

1321
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:58,300
They're so completely
inappropriate for you.

1322
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,600
Kate.

1323
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,600
Kate, Kate, come.

1324
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,600
Leopold? Leopold?

1325
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,500
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It boggles the mind that it is still here.

1326
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,700
This is my uncle's home. Well, was.

1327
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,000
This is where I lived.
Good Lord.

1328
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
A portrait of my parents...
and me.

1329
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,200
Leopold?

1330
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,200
Look, I just don't think
that we should just be

1331
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,700
barging around here like that.

1332
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:52,700
Leopold?

1333
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,400
My old quarters.

1334
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:20,200
What are you doing?

1335
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,600
The place where I put
everything I most cared for.

1336
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,800
Things I didn't want
my uncle to touch.

1337
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:52,800
My mother's ring.

1338
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,800
Oh, it's beautiful.

1339
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:08,500
You know,
I live on an island

1340
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,800
connected to everything
by bridges

1341
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:15,100
and I never cross them.

1342
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:18,500
I've lived here for ten years and I've...

1343
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,400
never been
to the other side of anything.

1344
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,300
You've never traveled?

1345
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:28,300
No.

1346
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,300
Do you...

1347
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:44,300
What?

1348
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,400
Do you miss where you're from?

1349
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,200
In a way, I...

1350
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,800
I miss...

1351
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,200
I miss its rhythm.

1352
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,700
It was slower?

1353
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,900
Quite a bit slower.

1354
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:12,900
- Like today?
- Yes.

1355
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,800
Do you hear that, Leopold?
Do you hear that music?

1356
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,800
Yes.

1357
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,700
Have you ever seen the movie
Breakfast at Tiffany's

1358
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:32,600
Uh, no.

1359
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,200
"No."

1360
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,200
Not yet.

1361
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,800
You see that guy down there
with the light on?

1362
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,500
He listens to the soundtrack

1363
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:48,100
of Breakfast at Tiffany's
every night

1364
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,700
until exactly midnight.

1365
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,800
And then he
turns his light off

1366
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,700
goes to sleep.

1367
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:58,200
<i>* My huckleberry friend *</i>

1368
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:02,200
<i>* Moon River *</i>

1369
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,200
<i>* And me. *</i>

1370
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,000
Oh, that means it's Sunday.

1371
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,800
Oh, I don't want it
to be Sunday.

1372
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,800
I want more of this.
More 1876.

1373
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:31,500
But, Kate, you don't work on
Sundays. We can have more.

1374
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:35,500
Well, I don't know,
'cause Sunday is the day before

1375
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,100
the day I work, so...

1376
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:41,000
it gets poisoned.

1377
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,700
I see.

1378
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,200
Besides, tomorrow is the day

1379
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:50,200
we shoot your commercial.

1380
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:04,200
Kate.

1381
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,200
Would you...?

1382
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,300
Might you ever...

1383
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:13,300
consider...?

1384
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:17,300
Hmm?

1385
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,800
It's time for bed.

1386
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,000
I'm so relaxed.

1387
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
That's all right.

1388
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,200
You're tucking me in.

1389
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,700
Yes.

1390
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,900
You're my Otis.

1391
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:08,900
Yes, Your Grace.

1392
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,300
Oh, wait.

1393
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,800
Hey, hey, don't...
don't go upstairs.

1394
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,800
Stay.

1395
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:08,600
I love you, Kate McKay.

1396
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,900
Scone, Your Grace?

1397
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,300
Ah, thank you, Millard.

1398
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,400
And you brought
the Farmer's Bounty?

1399
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,800
But of course.

1400
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,800
Ah!

1401
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,200
Fresh creamery butter.

1402
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,000
Is there anything
more comforting?

1403
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,200
I say there is

1404
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,400
and perhaps you'll agree

1405
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,800
when you sample fat-free
Farmer's Bounty

1406
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,800
with the genuine essence
of creamery butter in every bite.

1407
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,100
With every mouthful
of Farmer's Bounty

1408
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:54,000
you shall receive butter's
luxurious comfort in your mouth

1409
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,700
without adding to the luxury
of your waistline.

1410
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:59,200
Farmer's Bounty.

1411
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,500
Now, on this one

1412
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:04,500
take a bite and smile.

1413
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,400
And... cut!
All right, check gate.

1414
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,000
Good enough for me.

1415
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,700
Can we get a Dedo up here
and something...

1416
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,400
Oh, excuse me.

1417
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:18,200
Excuse me. Is this an actual
sample of Farmer's Bounty?

1418
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,300
Yeah. Why?

1419
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,200
This tastes like saddle soap.

1420
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,500
Well, it's not really
your concern, now, is it?

1421
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,300
Not my concern?

1422
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,100
This product tastes
like raw suet.

1423
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:29,600
How is that not my concern?

1424
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,600
Hey, pal, it's a paycheck!

1425
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,400
- A Paycheck?
- Wait a minute...

1426
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,000
This is an outrage!

1427
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,300
Don't worry about the taste.
Come back. We need another shot.

1428
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:41,300
Something that
brings the light up on this...

1429
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,400
Leopold.

1430
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,700
Leopold!

1431
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,700
Leopold, what's going on?
What are you doing?

1432
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,400
They-they need you
back in there.

1433
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,500
Do they?

1434
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,800
Yeah. They have to shoot the rest of
the spot. They're not finished yet.

1435
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,200
Well, I want no part of it.

1436
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,300
Why?

1437
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,100
Have you tasted it?

1438
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,900
- Farmer's Bounty?
- Yes, Farmer's Bounty.

1439
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:10,800
- Yeah, I've tasted it.
- It's revolting.

1440
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,700
I know.

1441
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:16,400
You know it's revolting yet you have no
qualms enlisting me to endorse it?

1442
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,600
It's diet;
it's supposed to be awful.

1443
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,100
I mean, what is the problem?

1444
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,400
The problem is that for no reason
beyond my affection for you

1445
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:27,400
I find myself peddling pond scum
to an unsuspecting public.

1446
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,900
Hey, listen, you know the stakes
are very high for me here.

1447
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:32,900
- You can't just quit because...
- Yes, I can. And so can you.

1448
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,700
When one finds oneself
participating

1449
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,400
in an endeavor entirely
without merit, one withdraws.

1450
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,900
No. No. Because sometimes

1451
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,600
you have to do things
that you don't like.

1452
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,400
Sometimes you have to suck it up
and finish what you started.

1453
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,500
It's part of life.

1454
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,000
You sound like my uncle.

1455
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,600
Look, Leopold, Jansen Foods is

1456
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,800
a very important
account for my company.

1457
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,000
If you don't go back in there

1458
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,500
then I get into
a lot of trouble.

1459
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,500
Is this what you do
at work, Kate?

1460
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,000
Research methods
to deceive people?

1461
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,400
Refine lies until
they resemble truth?

1462
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,500
It's no wonder
you dread your work week.

1463
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,000
Oh! Man, I don't have time
for this.

1464
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,400
What has happened to the world?

1465
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,300
You have every convenience,
every comfort

1466
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:13,900
- yet no time for integrity.
- No.

1467
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:16,500
What I don't have time for
are pious speeches

1468
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,300
by 200-year-old men

1469
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,700
who've never had to work
a day in their life.

1470
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:22,100
You have no idea
what I've done with my life.

1471
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:25,600
And you-you have no idea
what I've done with mine!

1472
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,000
I haven't had all that many
comforts and conveniences, Leopold,

1473
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,300
because I've been
paying dues all of my life

1474
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,900
and I'm tired,
and I need a rest

1475
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:37,400
and if I have to peddle
a little pond scum to get one

1476
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:41,400
then so be it.

1477
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:48,900
Very well.

1478
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:59,100
We're kidding ourselves,
Leopold.

1479
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:04,100
In point of fact I don't even
really know who you are.

1480
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:10,800
You still don't believe
I'm the man I say I am?

1481
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,900
We had a great weekend;
that's that.

1482
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:16,600
Now it's Sunday.

1483
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:20,600
It's over.

1484
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:45,500
<i>* There's such a lot of world to see. *</i>

1485
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:41,600
I know.

1486
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,500
I know, I know,
it sounds crazy-

1487
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,200
talking about...

1488
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:50,200
finding a crack
in time under the East River.

1489
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:56,400
But in, in point,
in point fact, Gretchen

1490
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,500
you know...

1491
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,600
it is no more crazy than, uh,

1492
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:06,600
a dog finding a rainbow.

1493
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,300
Dogs are color-blind, Gretchen.

1494
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:13,000
They don't see color.

1495
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,800
- Really?
- Just like we can't see time.

1496
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,000
We can feel it.

1497
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,500
Oh... we can feel it passing but,

1498
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,400
we can't see it;
it's just a blur.

1499
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,500
It's like, uh...

1500
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:29,500
it's like we're riding
in a, in a supersonic train

1501
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:33,500
and the world is
just blowing by.

1502
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:37,500
But imagine if we could stop
that train, Gretchen. Hmm?

1503
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,100
Imagine if we could stop
that train

1504
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,200
get out, look around

1505
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:45,700
and see time
for what it really is.

1506
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:47,900
A universe,

1507
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:51,900
a world, a thing as unimaginable as

1508
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,400
color to a dog.

1509
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:58,400
And as real and tangible
as that chair you're sitting in.

1510
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:03,700
Now, if we could see it
like that

1511
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:06,000
I mean, really look at it

1512
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,400
then...

1513
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:12,400
maybe we could see
the flaws as well as the form.

1514
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,600
And that's it.

1515
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,300
It's that simple.

1516
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:24,300
That's all I discovered.
I'm just a...

1517
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,400
just a guy who saw a crack
in a chair

1518
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:31,100
that no one else could see.

1519
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:35,100
I'm that dog who saw a rainbow.

1520
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:39,400
Only, uh...

1521
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:44,600
none of the other dogs
believe me.

1522
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:51,300
I believe you.

1523
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,800
I can see that some things have...

1524
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:41,300
happened since I went away.

1525
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:45,300
But...

1526
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:49,900
you have to go back.

1527
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:17,800
You understand you'll be going back
to the same day you left,

1528
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,500
- April 28th.
- Yes.

1529
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,700
So you understand you might be
repeating a few things.

1530
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:25,000
You might even see me.

1531
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Just don't follow me
this time.

1532
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:36,700
Can I go in?

1533
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:40,400
J.J., you asked to see me?

1534
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:44,400
Come on in.

1535
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,800
I understand you, uh,
put out a fire

1536
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,300
at the shoot yesterday.

1537
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:51,300
Guess Mr. Duke's got a bit
of an ego on him, huh?

1538
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:54,000
Yeah.

1539
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,600
I'm going to England
this week

1540
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:00,000
and I made a decision.

1541
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
You're going to be
the top New York honcho.

1542
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:06,600
So, this is going
to be your office.

1543
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,600
I'll be making it official
tonight.

1544
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,400
Thank you, J.J. Thank you.

1545
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,800
You've earned it.

1546
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,600
I'm heading over to Jansen to sign
the buy-out papers,

1547
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,500
FTC stuff. So I'll...

1548
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:24,600
see you later
at the thing.

1549
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,200
- What did he say?
- I got it.

1550
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:27,800
Oh, my God.
It's wonderful!

1551
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,800
Just give me one second.
I'm sorry, Darci. One second.

1552
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,200
Hi. You've reached Stuart.
Please leave a message.

1553
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,000
Hello?

1554
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,200
Leopold, I-I don't know
where you are

1555
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:45,700
but if you're there,
please pick up.

1556
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:48,600
I got it.

1557
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,100
I got the job.

1558
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:54,300
I'm the new
senior vice president

1559
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:56,900
at CRG.

1560
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:59,000
Uh, please call me. I...

1561
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,900
I'm sorry about the way
things came down yesterday.

1562
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:04,300
I apologize. I...

1563
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:07,000
I just really need to see you.
I'd love to see you tonight

1564
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
but I have this thing at Farmer's Bounty.
But I'd love to see you later.

1565
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,700
I miss you..

1566
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:17,700
I miss you.

1567
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:20,400
Hey, Stuart.

1568
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:24,400
How're you feeling?

1569
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,800
Where's Leo?

1570
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,800
He went home.

1571
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,800
He was for real..

1572
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,600
He was for real!

1573
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:26,400
Holy shit!

1574
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:30,400
Look at this!

1575
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:42,100
Oh, my God.

1576
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,100
Chilled, do
you understand? Chilled.

1577
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:52,000
And be sure to leave another
case of the Chateau Laffite.

1578
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,100
Yes, sir.

1579
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:57,300
Leopold! Where have you been?!

1580
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:59,900
Otis, I demand explication!
It's half past five.

1581
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:01,100
He's not even dressed!

1582
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:02,800
He'll be ready, my lord,
I assure you.

1583
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:06,000
I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendent!

1584
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
This is the invitation. You've got...
your table number, your car number

1585
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,700
and I've got Morty down there-
the guy you like. He's on the Madison side.

1586
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:13,300
Also, your phone sheet
is in here.

1587
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:15,800
And Stuart called
you a couple times. So...

1588
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:19,800
Have a great time tonight.
You look beautiful.

1589
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,100
I don't think this is right.
I'm supposed to be going to 2640 Madison.

1590
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:04,100
That's where we are,
Miss McKay.

1591
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,900
Have a nice evening.

1592
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:09,000
- Hi.
- Hello.

1593
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Invitation, please.

1594
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,000
No, no.
Look, they're still plugged.

1595
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,400
But they're just randomly seeded
with Minoxidil.

1596
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,200
- No cornrows.
- Excuse me.

1597
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,500
Hey, Kate.

1598
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,500
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1599
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,000
To hell with the facelifts.

1600
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,400
I'm into mini-lifts now.
Just a tiny little bit each year.

1601
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:33,500
I hear they'll bring them
back to 840 next year.

1602
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:34,900
So I'm just running
out my lease.

1603
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:38,300
- Kate, congratulations.
- Thanks, Bob.

1604
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:39,000
Hey, Kate.

1605
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,700
J.J. Hi, Barry.

1606
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:42,100
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

1607
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:43,900
Anyway, I'm just glad
they've got them fixed.

1608
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:47,900
I was going to move my office
down to the lobby.

1609
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:53,400
Excuse me.

1610
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,300
Kate, don't powder
your nose for too long.

1611
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,100
I'm going to give this speech
in a couple of minutes.

1612
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:01,100
Okay.

1613
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,700
All this time I thought
that I had

1614
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:06,400
pretezled fate and it had to be untwisted.

1615
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:10,200
But what I never considered is that
the whole thing is a pretzel.

1616
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:13,500
A beautiful 4D pretzel
of kismetic inevitability.

1617
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:16,700
Okay, you know what, get off Park
as soon as you can, and then go up Madison.

1618
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:18,700
I was supposed to go back.

1619
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:22,700
He was supposed to come forward then
he was supposed to go back again and...

1620
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:27,200
so was she.

1621
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:29,800
Now it is my
pleasure and honor...

1622
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:33,800
to turn this over to my friend,
J.J. Camden...

1623
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:49,100
...to take
priests to the bell tower.

1624
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:51,600
You speak of progress
and invention.

1625
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,400
But what I offer you
downstairs is reality.

1626
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:57,800
Take a wife. Marry.

1627
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:00,100
Let us not bother
with this banter, Uncle.

1628
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:02,000
Tell me whom you want me
to marry.

1629
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,200
Well, who has the most money?

1630
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:05,700
Well...

1631
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:08,600
that would be Miss Tree
of the Trees of Schenectady.

1632
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:12,000
Good. Consider it done.

1633
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Otis, fetch the ring.
I will announce at midnight.

1634
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:17,300
Invitation, please.

1635
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:18,300
Uh, hello.

1636
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,400
My name is Stuart Besser.

1637
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:20,800
I'm sorry, I know
we're not on your list

1638
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,800
- but his sister is Kate McKay...
- I'm sorry, sir, I can't just let you in.

1639
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:32,100
...and I learned that there was one thing

1640
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:35,000
that I could do and it didn't require money

1641
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,300
and it didn't require
a fancy school.

1642
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:41,200
I learned that I could
please people.

1643
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:44,100
And there is nothing wrong
with that!

1644
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:48,100
I am a people pleaser, people!

1645
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:52,800
Thank you so much. I am so...

1646
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,000
Kate!

1647
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,200
Stuart!

1648
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,900
Charlie! What are you doing?

1649
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:59,000
- You should look at these pictures, Kate.
- No! No-no-no-no!

1650
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,200
Now it's time to introduce
the woman who's going to be

1651
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,700
holding down the fort
in our New York offices

1652
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:05,200
our own little rising star,

1653
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,700
Miss Kate McKay!

1654
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:09,900
- Just listen to me for a second, please?
- They're introducing me downstairs right now!

1655
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:12,900
I'm sorry I was a lousy boyfriend.
I'm sorry I let you down.

1656
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:14,800
I know all you wanted
was someone you could trust...

1657
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,600
Oh, Stuart, really
I can't talk about...

1658
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:20,100
No, Kate, just listen
to me, okay? Please.

1659
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:23,000
Maybe we weren't such
a waste of time after all.

1660
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,600
- I mean, maybe there's a reason I was your guy.
- What are you talking about?

1661
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:30,600
Maybe I was supposed to help
you find your guy... Leopold.

1662
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:35,100
You got to go back, Kate.

1663
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:38,600
You got to go back there.

1664
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:40,900
Go back?

1665
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,200
How?

1666
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:46,200
You have to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge
within the next 23 minutes.

1667
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:50,300
Kate? Katie?

1668
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:54,300
Kate, just look
at the pictures, okay?

1669
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:10,400
Is there a... a Kate McKay
in the house?

1670
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:14,400
- Yeah. Here I am!
- Kate?

1671
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:18,100
Here she is. Here she is.

1672
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:20,000
Well, without further ado

1673
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,900
the new senior vice president
of our New York offices.

1674
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:26,900
Here she is, ladies and
gentlemen- Kate McKay.

1675
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,000
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1676
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Sorry.

1677
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:34,900
Thank you.

1678
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,300
Quite an entrance, huh?

1679
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:37,700
Thank you, J.J.

1680
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:40,000
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1681
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,700
Wow.

1682
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:43,300
Well...

1683
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:45,500
This is a great night.

1684
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,900
We here at...

1685
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:50,300
CRG have always
considered ourselves to be

1686
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:53,800
in the "Find what people want"
business and at Jansen,

1687
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,500
you guys are in the
"Make what people want" business.

1688
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:59,800
So, imagine
what we can do together.

1689
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:03,800
We'll be able to find out
exactly what people want

1690
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:06,100
and make it... for them.

1691
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:10,100
So... yeah, so our customers...

1692
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:14,200
will be able to get exactly...

1693
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:24,400
...what they...

1694
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:29,100
...they want.

1695
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:57,200
And...

1696
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:01,200
...it's a great thing to...
to get what you want.

1697
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,200
Uh, it's a really good thing.

1698
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,900
Unless what you thought
you wanted wasn't really

1699
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:09,400
what you wanted
because what you really...

1700
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:12,100
...wanted

1701
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:16,100
you couldn't imagine, or you
didn't think it was possible.

1702
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:22,600
But... but what if someone
came along who knew

1703
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:24,800
exactly what you wanted
without asking?

1704
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,300
They just knew. Like they could...

1705
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:31,300
hear your heart beating
or listen to your thoughts.

1706
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,200
And what if they were sure
of themselves

1707
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,800
and they didn't have
to take a poll

1708
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,100
and they loved you...

1709
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:44,100
and you hesitated?

1710
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:49,800
And...

1711
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:53,000
I have to go.

1712
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,900
I...

1713
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:59,900
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

1714
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:04,600
Kate?

1715
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:08,900
Stuart,

1716
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,100
can you tell me

1717
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:13,800
in short, complete sentences
featuring no words over two syllables

1718
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:16,100
why exactly
I am in these pictures?

1719
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:17,600
- Probably not.
- Try.

1720
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,400
- Because you were there.
- I wasn't.

1721
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,900
I would remember. Believe me,
I would remember if I was there.

1722
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:23,900
Because you're going to be there.

1723
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:24,900
If we get there in time.

1724
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:27,900
These are pictures
of the past, not the future.

1725
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:28,700
Not exactly.

1726
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:31,100
Theoretically speaking
if you go to the past in the future

1727
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:33,200
then your future
lies in the past.

1728
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:37,200
And that is a picture of you
in the future, in the past.

1729
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:41,500
We'll have to make a run
for it. Let's go.

1730
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,300
Come on, come on.

1731
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:46,400
Let's go, let's go. Come on!

1732
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,000
Whoa, where the hell do
you think you're going?

1733
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,600
$6.80 on the meter, pal.

1734
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:55,600
It's going to close, Kate!
Come on!

1735
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:04,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

1736
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:06,800
The Duke of Albany
will be making

1737
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,200
a very important announcement
in 20 minutes

1738
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:11,200
from this very stage.

1739
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:13,500
And I believe it shall be
an announcement

1740
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:17,500
that will justify
the playing of a bridal waltz.

1741
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:27,400
Okay...

1742
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:28,500
this is the hard part.

1743
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:30,100
- What?
- The girder.

1744
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:34,100
- The girder?
- You have to cross the girder, Kate.

1745
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:37,400
That girder?

1746
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:40,100
Stuart, I can't cross
that girder.

1747
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:42,600
- You love him, right?
- What?

1748
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,600
Leopold.

1749
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:48,200
You love him, right?

1750
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,200
Yeah.

1751
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:53,000
That's all you need to know.
Now go.

1752
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,500
- You'll be fine.
- Katie...

1753
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,500
Charlie... Charlie, what am I...
How are you gonna...

1754
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:00,600
No, go! Don't worry about me.

1755
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:02,500
- Now, Kate, now.
- Now?

1756
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:04,200
- The portal's going to close.
- All right.

1757
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:06,400
Go.

1758
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:09,700
-Oh!
- Jesus.

1759
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:11,000
Oh, God.

1760
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,400
You can do it.

1761
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:17,400
Don't look down.

1762
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Charlie...

1763
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:44,900
I'll love you forever.

1764
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:48,900
Love you.

1765
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:54,800
It's okay.

1766
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,100
Lady... lady, what
are you doing?

1767
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:00,100
Step back, lady.

1768
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:02,300
- It's okay.
- Step back from there, lady.

1769
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:06,300
Come back, lady.

1770
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,200
Central, be advised,
this is Bridge Post Four.

1771
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:11,700
I've got a jumper on the southwest
location of the bridge.

1772
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:16,700
Have a supervisor, ESU and Harbor
respond to this location forthwith.

1773
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,200
Ladies and gentlemen

1774
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:40,700
it is with a glad heart
and a bright eye

1775
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:44,000
that I proudly introduce
my beloved nephew

1776
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,700
Leopold, Duke of Albany.

1777
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:49,900
Thank you, Uncle Millard.

1778
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:50,600
Thank you.

1779
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:52,900
I'm sorry, madam, but
this is a private affair.

1780
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,300
No, you don't seem
to understand.

1781
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,700
I need to get inside.

1782
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:59,300
- I need to get inside right now and...
- What seems to be the problem?

1783
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:00,600
Are you Otis?

1784
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:04,600
Well, let us proceed.
Please raise your glasses...

1785
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,400
so we may toast
to my bride-to-be

1786
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:14,300
the woman whose welfare and happiness
shall be my solemn duty to maintain.

1787
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:19,100
The future Duchess of Albany...

1788
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:27,100
Kate McKay.

1789
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:33,500
Of the McKays of...?

1790
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:37,900
Massapequa..

1791
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:42,300
Massapequa.

1792
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,800
- I love you.
- I love you.

1793
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:43,400
<i>* If I caught the world in a bottle *
* And everything was still beneath the moon *</i>

1794
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:48,300
<i>* Without your love would it shine for me? *</i>

1795
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:58,000
<i>* If I was smart as Aristotle *
* And understood the rings around the moon *</i>

1796
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,000
<i>* What would it all matter if you love me? *</i>

1797
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:09,300
<i>* Here in your arms, *
* Where the world is impossibly still *</i>

1798
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:13,000
<i>* With a million dreams to fulfill *</i>

1799
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,600
<i>* And a matter of moments *
* Until the dancing ends. *</i>

1800
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:23,700
<i>* Here in your arms, *
* When everything seems to be clear *</i>

1801
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:27,600
<i>* Not a solitary thing would I fear *</i>

1802
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:32,800
<i>* Except when this moment comes *
* near the dancing's end. *</i>

1803
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:41,400
<i>* If I caught the world in an hourglass, *
* Saddled up the moon so we could ride *</i>

1804
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:46,600
<i>* Until the stars grew dim *</i>

1805
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:50,600
<i>* Until... *</i>

1806
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:59,300
<i>* One day you'll meet a stranger *
* And all the noise is silenced in the room *</i>

1807
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:05,000
<i>* You'll feel that you're close to some mystery *</i>

1808
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:13,800
<i>* In the moonlight when everything shatters, *
* You'll feel as if you've known her all your life *</i>

1809
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:19,200
<i>* The world's oldest lesson in history *</i>

1810
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:25,400
<i>* Here in your arms, *
* where the world is impossibly still *</i>

1811
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:29,100
<i>* With a million dreams to fulfill *</i>

1812
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:33,700
<i>* And a matter of moments *
* until the dancing ends. *</i>

1813
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:40,000
<i>* Here in your arms, *
* when everything seems to be clear *</i>

1814
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,900
<i>* Not a solitary thing do I fear *</i>

1815
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:51,800
<i>* Except when this moment comes *
* near the dancing's end. *</i>

1816
01:55:52,800 --> 01:56:01,100
<i>* Oh, if I caught the world in an hourglass, *
* saddled up the moon then we would ride *</i>

1817
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:06,700
<i>* Until the stars grew dim, *</i>

1818
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:13,900
<i>* Until the time, that time stands still, *</i>

1819
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:21,400
<i>* Until... *</i>
