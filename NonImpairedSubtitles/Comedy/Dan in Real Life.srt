The school and we will handle later

14
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,577

15
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,651
He sounds well.

16
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,753
- No suena bien.
- ¿Ahora qué?

17
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:44,061
You always tell us to go to her
School and now us expensive of her.

18
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,993
What must my studies?

19
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,765
Why do you smile?

20
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,667
It is that I never intended to hear you telling that.

21
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,472
He makes me smile.

22
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,907
I do not want to go.

23
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,377
We do this every year.

24
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,472
It is the only moment in that
That are all together ones.

25
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,177
I like the grandfather's house.

26
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,618
- Destruyen mi educación.
- No digas eso.

27
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:11,790

31
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,195
I am Marty Barasco, I wanted to thank him
By the last Friday column

32
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,534
He made me understand my parents.

33
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,240
This well one, good Marty
Which mas can I make by you?

34
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,437
Mr wanted to see his daughter

35
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,036
Jane.

36
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,146
In fact, I came by Face.

37
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,747
Taste know you, comes back in 3 years.

38
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,218
I do not want to boast but the Mr Shaw
He says that it am one of the best ones

39
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,491
Drivers in his class, he says that
I am ready for the expressway.

40
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,292
We do not agree.

41
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,559
Expensive, we go.

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,158

- Ya veremos.

43
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:59,069
-3 en punto, no lleguen...

44
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,072
Evening.

45
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,539
For which he knows it, the boy that you threw out
My friend Marty, is my fellow

46
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,775
Of laboratory of the type of science
Even we are doing a project.

47
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,645
The bus.

48
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,651
- iEsperen!

49
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,865

If, you him half an hour sends ago.

51
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,300

52
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,030
iNo can be!

53
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,119
- ¿Dónde esta tu hermana?
- Llegas tarde.

54
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,420
Yumes went.
Can I handle?

55
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,949
- Papa será premiado.
- No tan rápido.

56
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,621
- Hay otras dos columnas nominadas.
- Es grandioso.

57
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,654
Can I handle?

58
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,037
He looks, you are a good driver
Himself that is other million of

59
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,068
If you do not let me never learn.

60
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,144
But if I leave you maybe not alive.

61
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,647
What was that? Which bundles?
You shamed me.

62
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,115
Perdon by interrupting your
Studies with your friend.

63
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,254
Everyone can not be monks I eat your.

64
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,394
Of by the way, these punished.

65
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,726
- ¿Castigada?
- Si.

66
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,857
- ¿Por cuanto tiempo?
- De por vida.

67
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,400
- Vamos papa.
- Esto es humillante.

68
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,596
- Ni que lo digas.
- Castigada por un mes.

69
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:49,040
A month? It is worse than I always give birth.
Why potato?

70
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:53,139
- Me mentiste.
- No puedes con la verdad.

71
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,976
Quizas you would have to try it for the next one.

72
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,742
- Pero, pero...
- No.

73
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,880
- Esta bien papa, amo a Marty.
- Por favor.

74
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:09,991
Pope; pope; high; listening.
I did not know it immediately, I take a time.

75
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,189
What is a time?

76
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,723
I know it per 3 weeks
But I knew it at the 3 days.

77
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,361
3 days? In three days not it is not, possible.

78
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,064
- Quizas si pueda.
- No, no.

79
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,699
That feeling is not love.

80
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,708
- Lo amo, lo amo, lo amo.
- No es apropiado.

81
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,246
- Lo amo, lo amo, lo amo, lo amo.
- Crees que es amor pero no lo es.

82
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,911
It is not like that

83
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,174
These either, pope?

84
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:09,487
There Jane's university, goes
And there her goes opposite

85
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,217
What must mine?

86
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,689
Your these well ones, does not wait.
There he goes.

87
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,925
You can not move me away from Marty.

88
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,729
Pope, let me remember that the
Half of the world are boys.

89
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,706
Conocere to others.

90
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,410
But alone Marty this in my heart.

91
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,483
One that I am very good driver.

92
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,309
Not.

93
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,661
There you have.

94
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,464
I believe that your sisters are not
Very satisfied with me.

95
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,431
Why do you believe that I am that?

96
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:03,070
You are a good father but
Sometimes a bad pope.

97
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,772
Who told you to say that?

98
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,177
Nobody.

99
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,979
This very expensive One, can tell it to me.

100
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,509
- Yo misma lo invente.
- ¿Cuál de tus hermanas te lo dijo?

101
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:20,250
Him I invent by myself, myself, I am in the fourth grade
I can think of things by myself.

102
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,351
Jane or Face?

103
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,158
- Yo misma pensé en eso.
- ¿Jane o Cara?

104
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,424
I am in the fourth grade

105
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,125
- Esta en el cuarto grado
- Esta en el cuarto grado

106
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,736
They already arrived!

107
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,745
Girls go, they already arrived.

108
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,047
Hello grandfather.

109
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,048
Hello pope.

110
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,122
That good that they are everybody here.

111
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,824
- ¿Cómo estas?
- Estoy bien.

112
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,799
Or my girls not do not, stand me maybe.

113
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,359
It is not novelty.

114
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,607
He looks at your girls, they are all floodwaters.

115
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,112
They are not, very young even.

116
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,547
Hello, I go, she grew.

117
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,211
He grows daily.

118
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,379
Hello.

119
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,352
Hello Elli.

120
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,356
- ¿Había trafico?
- Si, terrible.

121
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,429
- Hola hermana.
- Me alegra que vinieras.

122
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,662
Who are any them?
I had never seen them.

123
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,931
- Hola tío Dan.
- Di algo.

124
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,133
- Algo.
- Paso, lo sabia.

125
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,165
Then he is, he sounds well.

126
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,733
He helps your uncle with his suitcases.

127
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:27,376
Fondness, your brother Mitch
He will bring a visit like that that

128
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,149
I am in the special room.
This well one.

129
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,697
- Duerme bien.
- Tu también.

130
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,261
Good morning.

131
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,423
Did they sleep well?

132
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,956
If.

133
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:16,930
Them can I bring something?

134
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,966
He gets a life.

135
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,672
- Solo necesitan espacio.
- ¿Eso necesita?

136
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,740
If, everyone him need.

137
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,812
Why do not you go by the newspapers?

138
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:39,347
- Mama...
- Anda, te hara bien.

139
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,027
Pierdete by a moment.

140
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,656
- Debería quedarme.
- No, pierdete Danny.

141
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,165
It is not a request.

142
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,006
- ¿Podría atenderme?
- En un minuto.

143
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:18,322
He went to the centre then.
By cafe.

144
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,454
I excuse ¿, I could help me?

145
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:29,699
If.

146
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,330
I am looking for a book obviously.

147
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,036
Something in particular?

148
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,566
If, something that is possible
Help to fight with.

149
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,175
What could be a situation is inconvenient.

150
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,845
This either ¿, what is?

151
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:55,191
I could be something funny one, but not
Necessarily slightly very funny.

152
00:14:55,861 --> 00:15:01,993
And without playing a trick to nobody
But something

153
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,992
- Gracioso pero humano.
- Esta bien.

154
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:14,005
And if I could surprise me, but that to that
Do same time feeling

155
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:20,178
That what you thought was correct
Of incorrect but wrong way.

156
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,848
There is something of correct in the wrong.

157
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,455
Quizas what I want to say is.

158
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:33,423
Mas important, I want me to be charmed.

159
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,434
And at the same time not.

160
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:43,032
It is that I want to feel
A connection towards something.

161
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,812
Or maybe not one I look for what.

162
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,247
In my experience, rarely him
You find in a book all.

163
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,148
That there are many is by that.

164
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,011
What do we have?

165
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:59,957
- Tenemos un popurri de elecciones.
- ¿Popurri?

166
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,388
If.

167
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:07,527
There you have, poetry, Dickensen.
Basic things, a little Neruda.

168
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,591
- Siempre es bueno.
- Estoy de acuerdo.

169
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:17,439
This is easy to read, Ghandi life.
The one, but nobody was as inspired.

170
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:23,439
As that, A good man is
Difficult to find of Lighthouse.

171
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,611
- El titulo solo.
- Ana Karena, Idol.

172
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,120
It is funny.

173
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,949
This is funny.

174
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,828
It Quizas is not.

175
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:41,825
- De hecho, es muy gracioso y real.
- Bien, me alegra.

176
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,832
If you could elect alone one.

177
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,772
Good, I would say that nothing compares one
To the fish Romance.

178
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:03,252
Walk and grasp what happened one to me.

179
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,153
Was I looking for something?

180
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,418
- Vendido.
- ¿Perdon?

181
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,720
The I love everybody.

182
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,695
- Solo eran sugerencias.
- Asegurese de darle su comisión.

183
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,393
- El no trabaja acá.
- Pues debería.

184
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,402

But I believe that they gave me
A small planet.

193
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,465
Thanks.

194
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,480
Tendo napkins and tools

195
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,177
And your not by him I dress.

196

197
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,220
- ¿Naciste?
- Naci.

198
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,388
I grew as everybody and also.

199
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,687
This good?

200
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:25,592
This either ¿, which mas? In the school
Taenia joins Bonanza punchbowl.

201
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,435
It is a program of the 60.

202
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:34,639
That wanted to be magician so
Taenia toys of magic.

203
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,610
Try to make levitate to a girl

204
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:07,669
You are going to laugh, slightly that
I never told him anyone in my life

205
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,677
And me saying it is very difficult.

206
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,887
And then, one gets sick.

207
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,384
And he died.

208
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,891
Me hard a time

209
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,003
We should talk about something mas.

210
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:39,343
¿ So you are one of those widowers
That 3 daughters have that he knows

211
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,902
To women without suspicion in bookstores?

212
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,642
So he seems.

213
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,013
- Estuve ahí.
- ¿En serio?

214
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:55,057
It does not, seem that it was too difficult.

215
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,192
We are well now.

216
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,632
Seriously.

217
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,533
You can smile.

218
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,530
It is better than the alternative.

219
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,538
Can you grasp this?

220
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,212
Disculpame.
Hello.

221
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,243
Not minutes, if.

222
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,984
- Tengo que irme.
- Esta bien.

223
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,093
Perdi the time notion.

224
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,964
Desearia go on talking.

225
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:38,759
Knowing you was very cute and unusual.

226
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,661
Quizas can call you someday.

227
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,099
- Eso quizas sea incomodo.
- Supongo que tienes una relación.

228
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,905
If, a new.

229
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,606
I had known it of not talking so.

230
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,376
- Eso es cierto.
- No es justo ¿verdad?

231
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:52,984
Thanks.

232
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,910
You taste all of my and he does not swim one of you myself.

233
00:20:55,988 --> 00:21:00,721
I do not want to pass me the life rest
Asking me by the bookstore girl.

234
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,063
Alone seriamos two people
Finishing a conversation.

235
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,824
There this well one, is not damage.

236
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,639
Flame or not, but flame.

237
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:36,251
Himself for which he knows, I will call though I am
Alone to tell me not to call.

238
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,264
This well one.

239
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:57,675
"I will call though I am alone
To tell me not to call

240
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,414
I establish it.

241
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:22,171
I never do that kind of things, officer.
In general I am always careful.

242
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,231
Nobody believes in

243
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,339
- Su multa.
- Esta bien.

244
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,846
That good.

245
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,043
- Hola.
- Hola.

246
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,454
What does it happen?

247
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,482
Nobody, he swims that is to say.

248
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,488
Danny return.

249
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,699
These either partner?

250
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,469
If, I am well.

251
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,268
- ¿En serio?
- Si.

252
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,571
You do not seem to be well.

253
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,142
Slightly very strange step.

254
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,808
I

255
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,945
Conoci to someone and it is other thing.

256
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:16,051
- Maldición.
- Esto es enorme.

257
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,721
- ¿Tienes su número?
- Si.

258
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,458
- ¿La vas a llamar?
- Es complicado.

259
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,192
It is simple you have to call.

260
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,031
Insurance has just known her, him
That I am very quick worries.

261
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,162
It is never very quick
In special at his age.

262
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:30,233
- Amy, Dan conocio a alguien.
- ¿Conocio a alguien?

263
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,244
What can he call so soon?

264
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,576
I could not say you
I have not been single per years.

265
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,582
My god, you knew someone.

266
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,641
Dan knew a ricura.

267
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,284
You know that, preguntemosle to potato.

268
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,449
How is he?

269
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,758
Her

270
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:55,426
Which is... the question?

271
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:59,665
That is my brother, Dan
He needs your advice.

272
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:03,765
A ricura and this knew something agitated one.

273
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,538
Would not it be your?

274
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,005

All the family would know

275
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,805

- Vámonos todos

276
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,622
- ¿Anie?
- Es Ann Marie.

277
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,219
Mitch me calls Anie but I am Marie.

278
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:27,755
I have to two Maries my class of
Exercises, I did not want to confuse them.

279
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,893
That not serious good.

280
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,335
I prefer Marie.

281
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,998
We go fondness, all the women.

282

- Están muy atrasados.
- No es nada.

287
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,097
Two consecutive things.

288
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:10,937
That is strange your you are interested
In someone, he must be very special.

289
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,311
It is what I try to tell, you, I did not pass anything.

290
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,010
- Ella tiene novio.
- Eso no es problema.

291
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,386

- ¿Tiene una roca en su mano izquierda?
- No, aun no.

295
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,620
It is fair juice then.

296
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,154
Concentrense people, fryer.

297

Pate.

298
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,459
Opening that is that.

299
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:44,340
The previous word the
We relate to this.

300
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,069
That would do the word ocean.

301
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,544
Everyone did them.

302
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,682
10 letters something that could not
Go out bad if Salian so.

303

We are not in them even of down.

Rays.

305
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,994
I end one.

306
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,296
Congratulations.

307
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,405

00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,512
It is very quick for saying.

313
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:37,785
Saying that, it is shiny, kind
And adorable, if you spoil it

314
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:41,026
We will get rid of you
And her will keep her.

315
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,064
Dan, I am you absent there.

316
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,531
Seriously, that girl is incredible.

317
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,037
- ¿Qué te parece?
- Es grandiosa.

318
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,235
Not, by here.

319
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,373
Do I show you where we are in this map?

320
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,605
If.

Of having known that you are
My brother's girlfriend.

00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,028
- Ya veo.

326
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,331
It is funny, we should tell everybody.

327
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,836
No, no, no.

328
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,737

331
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,605

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,007

339
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,516
- Mitch es un gran tipo.
- Si que lo es.

340
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,453
It is funny, complicated
In a good way.

341
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,016
- Justo lo que necesito.
- Es un gran tipo.

342
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:53,393

And uni to a gym and Mitch was there.

343
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,525
- Es un gran tipo.
- Sigues diciendo eso.

344
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,061
Because it is.

345
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:06,432
So good luck gives birth to all us.

346

This well one.

347

The small Burt told me that
They will give you a reward.

348
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,487
They are seeing many
Columnists it is something very distant one.

349
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:23,790
She is incredible he has lived there
Or Tibet has visited it.

350
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,729
Chile, Berlin, where they are the walls.

351
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:30,928

353
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,773

Cover in asparaguses.

359
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,034
And never oli swims myself.

360
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,534
Could they pass me the corn?

361

365

00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,764
Talent Show.

369

- ¿Cómo seria tu día perfecto?
- El mío comenzaria con Anie

370
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,370
Do not ask you.

371
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:48,844
My perfect day serious wake up in one
pais in which I do not know his language.

372
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,317
No customs, a place where
This out of my element.

373
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,779
Welcome.

374
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:59,220
That was what I said when
I saw it for the first time.

375
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,722
You do not have to shout.

376
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:09,662
I thought that I had died because
There was an angel in the room.

377
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,227
Thanks.

378
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,944

00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,976
- Algunos seguimos comiendo.

381
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:07,014
He does not, excuse if we overwhelm you.

382
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,654
When does a boyfriend turn into your lover?

383
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:15,688
This either, this well one, believe that
We should he stops doing it

384
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,667
You ask, he has been like that all the night.

00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,533

Excuse, none of them

Mitch old fiancés he has been
Submitted to such interrogation.

390
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,281
There the diabla comes

391
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:43,491
I do not talk to you of the diabla
Nor who was in the marine.

392
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:47,190
Or to the masseur therapist.

393
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:51,326
None of the airhostesses
Of the international lineas.

394
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,929
- que vinieron a esta casa.
- Ya es suficiente.

395
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,566

00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:06,145
Dan goes by lightening that thanks.
You are the type ready mas that I know.

397
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,320
Turn is of that Anie asks me
What want to know.

398
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,490
Preguntame what you want.

399
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,828
- No tengo preguntas.
- Vamos.

400
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:28,064
Mitch told that me whether he forgot
His last one, that would forget mine.

401
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,438
That is something stupit one.

402
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,679
John, brings the foot.

403
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,764
Your not, your you washed the plates by yourself.

404
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,519
I establish it, go too far of the line.

405
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,584
Never it is like that, you are my brother.

406
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:24,788
I believe that you would understand.

407
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,161
There is not anything that you can
Make me to worry.

408
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:35,333
When you talked about my others
Girls tell me bill of something

409
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,572
What I establish by Marie is different.

410
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:47,782
- Sabes ese sentimiento en tu...
- Corazón.

411
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:51,583
- Si, cuando tu corazón...
- Late fuerte.

412
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,390
¿ How if I were I was
Of the ribs?

413
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,358
If.

414
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:02,458
Feel vulnerable, well but bad.
You the heart hurts and it is good.

415
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,797
If.

416
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,994
How does that call one?

417
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,001
Love.

418
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,302
You always have the words.

419
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,487
- Stanford o Berkley.
- Esas son buenas escuelas.

420
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,115
Quizas Washinton university.

421
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,723
Or some place close to house.

422
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,959
If you have problems with sleeping
You already know where to meet me.

423
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,229

Good night kiss?

Rooms separated until you marry you.

426
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,138

- Yo estoy de acuerdo con eso.

427
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,648
- Gracias Dan.
- De nada.

428
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,850
What do you do Mitch?

429
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,547
Marie I buy books but I believe
That should read a book

430
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,522
- de un escritor verdadero.
- No es buena idea.

431
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,855
- Por favor no.
- Es el mejor libro.

432
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,987
- Quizas otro sea mejor.
- Se amable.

433
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,089
- Si lo firmaras seria grandioso.
- Cuidado, es primera edición.

434
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,793
It is the only edition.

435
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,829
Good night.

436
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,030
He sleeps well.

437
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,700

00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,063
Put you to the front.

455
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,219
With the arms.

456
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,699
Look at Dan so they see
What they do not have to do.

457
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,304
- Fue excelente.
- Gracias.

458
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,712
It was impressive.

459
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,623
That one is one good snooty.

460
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,164
Quizas you try that with me later.

461
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,991

In fact my daughters they want it to happen
A time of quality with his pope

467
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,844
But I promise us to do it other day.

Shells and of the mache paper shark.

00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,663
Do you remember that you liked taffies?

Life this full of disillusions
Sometimes big and sometimes mas big

479
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,483
What will, the light or the museum be?

480
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:06,024
- ¿Saben porque tenemos faros?
- ¿Por qué son bonitos?

481
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,963
If and also because they help
When this dark.

482
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,530
Help to keep to the boats safely.

483
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,240
For which do not crash against the rocks.

484
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:25,047
Because when these over there outside
And waves you rock from a side the other.

485
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:32,511
And you that never consider truths earth once again
And that you would be able I will break to pieces

486
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:37,357
Sink until the bottom, deep.

487
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,757
It is that light what keeps us in course.

488
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,158
- La luz.
- ¿Te sientes bien, papa?

489
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,661
Clear that if, fondness.

490
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,442
Did they have a good time?

491
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,745
- No.
- No.

492
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,515
- Chicos, ¿dónde estaban?
- Lo se, lo se.

493
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,453
- Los busque por todas partes.
- Para un expertos en paternidad.

494
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,962
The one, I was not thinking.

495
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,622
Hello boy.

496
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:29,736
Dave, her you had seen, it is incredible
Me I kill the last mile.

497
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,680
Was it enough?

498
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,239
I believed that I would not achieve it.

499
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,189
To where he went Do they give?

500
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,613
Marie, there are clean towels
In the right office.

501
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,154
I am surprised your skin.

502
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,521
I am surprised your smell.

503
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,521
I am surprised your eyes.

504
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:22,858
iPapa!

505
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:29,395
You are a strange one. I do not, establish it.
He is my father's loser.

506
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,533
If, I was spying.

507
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:41,343
- ¿Hola?
- Tenemos que hablar.

508
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:44,984
Can not he wait?

509
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,956
This this working for you?
You have to be honest.

510
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,858
- La estoy pasando bien.
- ¿Bien?

511
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,361
If, then he is.

512
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,160
- ¿Te estas divirtiendo?
- Tengo jabon en los ojos.

513
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,629
Because you know something
Me I am not entertaining

514
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:02,867
I believe that I eat two people
We should have rules.

515
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:07,240
- ¿No lo crees?
- Claro.

516
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:14,276
This well, of that was talking
We must keep distance, tab.

517
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,014
- Una toalla.
- Bien, lo siento.

518
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,112
Thanks.

519
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,985
- Deja de leer mi libro.
- ¿Por qué?

520
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:26,895
- Y esa salsa que haces.
- ¿De qué estas hablando?

521
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,367
The sauce, this thing
If you could stop doing it.

522
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,298
I establish it.

523
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,399
I would much never help each other
Have known of your existence.

524
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,536
- Gracias.
- Si, lo dije

525
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,938
He did not go in serious but I said it.

526
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,642
And do you taste that hare mas?

527
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:52,955
I go to make less attractive give birth
That feelings do not emerge

528
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:58,992
That funny but I
I will stop thinking in you.

529
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,023
- Que bien.
- Lo hare.

530
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:06,168
And if I start to think
In you who it happens maybe.

531
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,899
At a moment of weakness.

532
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,401
I will approach me in your faults.

533
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,773
- ¿Mis defectos?
- Tus defectos.

534
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:14,869
And those are?

535
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:18,404
I do not have idea but you can be
Sure that I will find out it.

536
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,240
- Estoy acá.
- Lo siento mucho.

537
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,411
- ¿Te estas duchando?
- Si, eso hare.

538
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,652
A small advice
Domestic old trick.

539
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:27,622
Thanks.

540
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,056
Can I talk you of something?

541
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,221
Opening.

542
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,130
Can he remain between us?

543
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:47,008
That you were talking about your life is alone
Last night and of the importance of traveling.

544
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:55,543
Try new things and I put me
To think of the good that serious

545
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,446
That seems to be this list.

546
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,527
Even these dressed.

547
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,693
Not I will, look, I will look give birth here.

548
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:14,800
Finally, I have just given me bill.

549
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,100
I have been thinking of what I want a lot
Do.

550
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,444
But not alone in the school.

551
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,646
I have to see that hare with my life exactly.

552
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:33,217
One that I want to go to a new place
And have a house.

553
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:38,820
But trying to decipher is difficult
Where you must be.

554
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,059
That good.

555
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:46,126
And have that experience, knowledge of him
That treats one.

556
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,163
Correct.

557
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:57,146
Me I establish landfall when giving me bill, give you
Bill of what you want ¿, you know?

558
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:29,701
Lunch.

559
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,620
He walks to suit to the dining room.

560
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:42,950
You know that I believe me I will suit with
The children.

561
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,855
Dan.

562
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,621
Let me please.

563
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,671
Hello boys.
Hello.

564
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:25,690
Hello?

565
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:39,504
Hello.

566
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:40,808
Hello

567
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,048
What this passing?

568
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,616
We are talking about something
But we are not entertaining.

569
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,418
If, I can see that.

570
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,416
How this? - She is surprising.

571
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,124
Goodbye daddy.

572
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:53,727
Goodbye.

573
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,730
Goodbye.

574
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,959
You said to me.

575
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:05,974
If, I was about getting out that of above
With a lot of forces

576
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:15,778
So I hid it and Salian, Salian very
Cute, I seemed a star.

577
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:18,387
If?

578
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,320
Dan. - Hello.

579
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,318
Fondness, we are worried about you.

580
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:30,298
And with what I pass this tomorrow are
Very worried.

581
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,798
Thanks, I feel been shocked.

582
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,400
But... I am well.

583
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,743
We are talking in private. - Further, this will be good.

584
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,408
We have to talk. - Further I am all ears.

585
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:51,019
Your you do so by your children
You do so by everybody.

586
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:52,949
What do you do for you?

587
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:57,717
It happens everyone. - That I am worried is alone.

588
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:01,764
This well one. Quedense by favor
Ma follows.

589
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,860
Is this by that he functioned rare? - If, fondness.

590
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,669
If, he is an explanation gives birth
All that.

591
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:12,440
And I have to talk with you, you have
You must be very depressed

592
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:16,676
So I think that you must feel you
With the short self-esteem

593
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,674
Do not - talk with my neurologist on that.

594
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:28,256
The only one asks that all us
We do he is if Dan found love of new.

595
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,150
Not he will not, do it. - Fondness.

596
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,089
I establish it, but he will not do it.

597
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,688
Love meets you.

598
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,773
I do not believe that I was being clear before
But you have to unplug that problem.

599
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:55,378
what I have listened to up to now and;
Worry, unplug, and drain.

600
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,278
Good... graces.

601
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:03,618
That is everything. I end one. - It is not that.

602
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:10,425
We knew Marcus daughter
In the drugstore and her I ask by you.

603
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,325
They should go out to have a good time.

604
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:19,438
What means that Rutri Draker will pick up you
To the 6 pm, and they are going to take some drinks.

605
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,368
Not the hare. - Angers to an appointment.

606
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,273
iNo, I will not go to an appointment!

607
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,080
iDan is time!

608
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:41,153
Mom I do not remember Ruthie face
I do not want to go.

609
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,463
iNo I want to go out with the hog face!

610
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:48,065
You are going to go. - iYa I do not remember it!

611
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,466
Decided iEsta! - I remember his face not even.

612
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,299
It will be an appointment blindly. - He walks, it will be amusing.

613
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,778
If, it will be amusing.

614
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,620
We go, do you one. - Good.

615
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,923
He walks as rough savage.

616
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:35,150
This either, this well one.

617
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,252
That is good.

618
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:57,000

You must not have long time to go out.

Someone had.

630

Of disfigured children.

00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,613
You are a saint.

642
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:28,320
By myself I do my part to help.

00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,120
Like your brother.

644

Some times when I can not sleep
In the nights

What you said, the potato mother
It is an impressive story.

649
00:55:56,553 --> 00:56:02,924
And in a paragraph speeches that is necessary
Give different foods each boy

650
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,023
What are you your?
A restaurant?

But it is clear.

They will give me support.

00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:35,146
Tendran that excuse, I can not
Avoid it.

657
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,367
With a backside I seized

00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,971
.. que mas puede pedir alguien.

659
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:54,733
He hears.

660
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,342
Truth does ¿ not disturb her? - If.

661
00:56:58,882 --> 00:56:59,644
Good.

662
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,386
But I do not believe that this interested in her. - ¿ Not him these?

If, he seems.

668
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:33,304
That is good.

01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,749
But you must use the head. - ¿ What does that mean?

Lilly has asked me because
You were flirting with Mary.

718
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:25,223
I was not flirting. - Do not worry, cover you.

719
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,433
I told him that I was not anything.

01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:29,163
Because it is not.

721

Daddy.

He has come from Boston.

731
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:42,076
Daddy, that loves me.

01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,044
Good.

733
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,940
You do not have to worry
When one he reports to the sex.

734
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,745
Marty is who wants to wait.

735
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:55,557
And that must give me peacefulness?

736
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:57,653
I love daddy.

The master.

739
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,529
You do not love him.

740
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,697
What we have is true love.

741
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:09,793
Alone because your you him do not have he does not mean that you must
Punish us.

742
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,201
Love is not at your age, appeal is
Sexual.

743
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:16,505
It is not love. - Your you are not good.

744
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,410

What is what I understand?
Help me please.

747
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:32,258
What do you feel connected to that person?

748
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:37,557
And when this person's fences
You do not know that say and you say about everything.

749
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,926
That this in your mind and in your heart
You know that they are destined to be together.

750
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:46,269
That this person will make to live you a best one
Version of your life.

751
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,141

He looks, I am not your father, but you must know that
Love is a dangerous feeling.

757
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:21,098
Not gentleman.

758
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,110
These discussing with me? - Not.

759
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:26,509
It is alone.

760
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:32,551
Love is not a feeling, it is an ability.

761
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:34,352
Who told you that?

762
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,919
Invent it, gentleman.

763
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,223
Come to say goodbye.

764
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,465

Sweet? ¿ How it can be
Sweet that?

771
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,595
Be as certain to feel a lot of love.

772
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,798
Love, not is a feeling. - ¿ Not?

773
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,395
It is an ability.

774
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,708
If that is true you have a daughter very skillful.

775
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:40,353
iTu you are a love assassin!

776
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:50,631
This well Sarah, the following ones.
We must do something with the girls

777
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,723
That we do usually.

778
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:56,166
My daughter and I work on the same.

779
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:57,263
That is cute.

780
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:58,933
And Jane?

781
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,868
This annoyed one. - ¿ What did he tell you?

782
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:02,370
Love assassin.

Teniamos he plan for all the family slightly.

785
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,425
Did your pope function?

786
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:26,396
That will not do it.

787
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:29,566
That is the only one this excluded from doing it.

788
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,436
I introduce myself to Bill Wilson.

789
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,213
These well ones? - Not.

790
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,050
Always do what bundles.

791
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:49,723
Mary is not a normal girl
I have to do something special.

792
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:52,359
Your same one one.

793
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:13,776
This is by Marty.

794
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:06,434
I have an idea.

795
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:08,462
Do you consider that this well one?

796
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:10,636
It can be.

797
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,740
Either, the last but not minus
The Mitch uncle.

798
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:22,242
Someone very wise, my brother.

799
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,444
He once told me that if.

800
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:30,291
.. quieres ser completamente honesto.
He sings.

801
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,591
By the way, let me present him my band

802
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:40,465

What was that?

806
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:31,370
I could not arrest me.

807
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,430
What will we do now?

808
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:37,236
We can not do anything.
He is my brother.

809
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,340
Why you sang do I give birth my?

810
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,342
Because

811
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:53,555
He paginates 92, that lives because a
Angel I enter to the room.

812
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:58,390
He paginates 148, I will forget your past
If you forgive mine.

813
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:01,233
It seems that that was done by you.

814
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:06,797
It is unbearable.

815
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:11,304
I can not go on wanting.

816
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:28,728
Daddy?

817
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:30,523
If he Blows?

818
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:34,166
Can you come to my room?
I want to show you something that I need.

819
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,532
We will do it tomorrow
I promise it.

820
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:41,639

821
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:57,449
What this passing?

822
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,992
I must not have sung
The one.

823
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:10,905
But I already did it.

824
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,307
This crying or laughing?

825
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,845
No, please.

826
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,847
Do not let me.

827
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:36,722
Here he comes.

828
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:37,857
iMamá!

829
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:55,043
Do not function please normal.

830
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:08,926
I was an impressive kind.
She said that she loved me a lot.

831
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:11,989
And he said later.

832
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,099
The two we have to find ours
Twin souls.

833
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:20,907
I am confused not one I pass that
Of yesterday for today.

834
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:22,007
That made it to happen this.

835
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,242
There a reason by which is she. -..

836
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,413
Why do you look me to my? - I am not looking.

837
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:33,015
The I look at his future and your these
In that.

838
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:36,520
Dan ¿, you have something that to add?

839
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:38,621
If, that the expert has to say
We go.

840
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,226
Fondness, the truth is.

841
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,630
We fell down well.

842
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,734
If, really if.

843
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,462

Not.

01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:09,281
If!

846
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:11,482
This is my blood. - Do it.

847
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:13,686
To his marks.

848
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:15,293
iVamos!

849
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,495

01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,419
An official taste see it

864
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:15,216
Does he know by that I stopped it? - Clear that if.

865
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:18,386
One what towards and one that this
Evil.

866
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:21,790
This cost him. - Pongalo in my bill.

867
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,293
What was that? - Pongalo in my bill.

868
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:58,030
What are we doing?

869
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:00,992
That can this evil.

870
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,095
If.

871
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,397
But there is something correct one in our equivocation
Fodder.

872
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,598
¿ You create

873

They ask you.

What?

875
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,988
I believe that all this is premature.

876
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:26,786
You are right.

877
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:33,495

That one was a terrible shooting.

884
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:17,969
We can make it of new.

885
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:24,644
Two pines. - That is good.

886

At three.

You two they finished ¿, certain? - Two hour ago.

896
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,550
The one, the one, himself.

And by yourself you are not a love assassin.
You are the worst world father.

934
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:00,593
That sweet.

Pair of candidates mas

If this well one, should remain, one I like
Have the family near.

939
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:24,249
With Dan everyone keep the things
Between family.

940
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:25,550
Certain Dan?

941
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:30,120
Thereby we think of you, in your columns
You represent your moral values.

The personal features that one
They reflect in your writings very impressive sound.

Honesty, confidence. - Dan have impressive plans for you.

01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:42,835
What we want to do, is that you say to him
To your readers who you do. -

945
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:44,441
What is that?

946
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:46,338
Put to the family first.

947
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,840
This well, this is the question.

948
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:55,144
Someone has not been reading his
Column.

949
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:58,185
I am not sure that means that.

950
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,099
Andate.

951
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:16,008
You are one lie and a hypocrite
Deceive your brother with his girlfriend.

952
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:19,505
What as well do you know it? - Two violations and a collision.

953
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:21,513
Was that part of the plan?

954
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:25,019
The worst of all.
It was that you avoid to Lilly

955
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,914
She has wanted to show you something that did
For you.

956
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:29,521
But you never were.

957
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:06,209
I made a mistake really. - You did not do it.

958
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:07,379
If I did it mom.

959
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:10,213
What I made to Lilly. - Do not forget Mitch.

960
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:11,386
If.

961
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:15,687
And to that newspaper people. - It was not a good day.

962
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,828
If I had approached me in death
Of my wife.

963
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:22,830
Please.

964
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:26,496
Love is like that. - Debi have made it better.

965
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:30,004
Heri to my children. - He walks to desherirlos.

966
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:34,707
Fondness do task errors. - Many, too many.

967
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:43,953
Can someone give me other box by favor?

968
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,416
If, I already go.

969
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:52,431
Mitch, I.

970
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,571
Mas had to have been someone.

971
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:04,673
I am very

972
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:08,714
Let it there.

973
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:15,217
Hello beautiful.

974
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:35,703
Girls?

975
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:40,212
I would like to talk with Lilly to
Alone, if it is possible.

976
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:52,822
This well one.

977
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:06,404
One that spoils all, a lot.

978
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:08,474
If, you did it.

979
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:10,409
Now

980
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,305
Ma.

981
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:18,580
Strange to his mom, all the time
Always the hare.

982
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:20,376
Mom has gone.

983
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:23,016
I see fondness, every day.

984
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:28,894
I see it in his goodness, sacrifice
And passion.

985
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:35,000
Lilly, I memorize... his smile.

986
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:39,839
This is what hare.

987
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:42,936
I will punish me by life.

988
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,809
I will stay with you
I will be with you.

989
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:48,905
These with us everybody
The days.

990
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:50,643
I will not go to no place.

991
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,156
Confuse Veran, a little with
Mary.

992
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,923
But that one I end
This well one?

993
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:03,019
Perdi the head.

994
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:08,158
I was stupit, because I love her.

995
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,038
What?

996
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:15,641
That is... not not her master
What is not fifteen saying.

997
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:18,844
¿ How I can love her if alone
I know it?

998
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:19,637
Three days.

999
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:20,843
If.

1000
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:25,243
How can you know in 3 days?

1001
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:30,681
Not him one.

1002
01:30:31,659 --> 01:30:33,251
If the one, I love her.

1003
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:36,960
I love her, I love her, I love her.

1004
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:47,471
He walks by her.

1005
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:51,374
You must be happy.

1006
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:02,919
He walks.

1007
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:07,621
Now.

1008
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:19,435
Fondness, for the path.

1009
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:30,446
What does it happen?

1010
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:32,451
I can not do it. - You must do it.

1011
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:33,751
I do not have licence.

1012
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:53,105
I am very good with the advices.

1013
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:56,271
This is very strange.

1014
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:59,011
But I would not lose it.

1015
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:15,760
Dear readers for most
You this column in his newspaper is my first one

1016
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:19,758
In the future I will answer his questions, but
Today

1017
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:25,035
I want to break my usual format and
Talk to him on the objective of the plans.

1018
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:29,666
Not my plans with this column, but
My life plans.

1019
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:31,475
As everybody we do it.

1020
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:36,142
And as we hope our children to can
Do it by if same.

1021
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:44,558
But to be honest with ourselves
The plans that do do not work as we wait

1022
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:52,898
So instead of asking people
Young ¿, such as they are your plans?

1023
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,661
What do you plan to do with your life?

1024
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:57,569
Maybe must tell them this

1025
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,905
Plan to have a surprise.

1026
01:33:00,906 --> 01:33:11,906
