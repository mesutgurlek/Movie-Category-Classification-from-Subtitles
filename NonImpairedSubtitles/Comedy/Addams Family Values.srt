as the Black Widow.

281
01:50:27,236 --> 01:50:29,033  X1:275 X2:456 Y1:360 Y2:426

286
01:50:38,113 --> 01:50:40,581  X1:175 X2:558 Y1:360 Y2:426

I have a confession,

557
02:06:10,957 --> 02:06:12,982  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:360 Y2:433
something
I must tell you.

558
02:06:16,963 --> 02:06:19,158  X1:282 X2:439 Y1:400 Y2:434
I'm a virgin.

559
02:06:19,232 --> 02:06:20,358  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:400 Y2:426
You are?

560
02:06:20,433 --> 02:06:21,525  X1:332 X2:386 Y1:400 Y2:426
Yes.

561
02:06:21,601 --> 02:06:22,761  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:398 Y2:426
What's that?

562
02:06:24,571 --> 02:06:25,833  X1:253 X2:469 Y1:400 Y2:426
It--It's someone

563
02:06:25,906 --> 02:06:30,741  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:360 Y2:433
who's never experienced
physical love.

564
02:06:30,811 --> 02:06:33,609  X1:336 X2:384 Y1:398 Y2:426
Oh.

565
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:35,807  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:362 Y2:433
You mean,
with another person.

566
02:06:38,885 --> 02:06:40,318  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:398 Y2:430
Then, Debbie,

567
02:06:40,387 --> 02:06:43,447  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:360 Y2:430
I have a confession
to make, as well.

568
02:06:43,523 --> 02:06:44,888  X1:276 X2:445 Y1:400 Y2:430
I'm one, too.

569
02:06:44,958 --> 02:06:47,153  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:400 Y2:426
You? You?

570
02:06:47,227 --> 02:06:48,285  X1:332 X2:386 Y1:400 Y2:426
Yes.

571
02:06:48,361 --> 02:06:51,660  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:360 Y2:433
But with your looks,
your charm,

572
02:06:51,731 --> 02:06:53,961  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:364 Y2:434
women must
follow you everywhere.

573
02:06:54,034 --> 02:06:55,524  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:398 Y2:426

574
02:06:55,602 --> 02:06:57,467  X1:287 X2:433 Y1:398 Y2:430
Oh, Fester,

575
02:06:57,537 --> 02:06:58,970  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:398 Y2:433
I always dreamed

576
02:06:59,039 --> 02:07:02,099  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:360 Y2:430
of meeting
someone untouched,

577
02:07:02,175 --> 02:07:04,166  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:406 Y2:433
someone pure,

578
02:07:04,244 --> 02:07:07,077  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:368 Y2:433
someone...
just like you.

579
02:07:07,147 --> 02:07:08,842  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:398 Y2:426
You'll meet him.

580
02:07:08,915 --> 02:07:14,114  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:430
And--And I dreamed
that when I met him,

581
02:07:14,187 --> 02:07:17,714  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:360 Y2:433
that we would wait
until our wedding night

582
02:07:17,791 --> 02:07:20,191  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:360 Y2:430
to give ourselves
to one another,

583
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:23,491  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:360 Y2:426
to make
the ultimate sacrifice.

584
02:07:23,563 --> 02:07:25,360  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:400 Y2:433
A goat?

585
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:29,568  X1:225 X2:498 Y1:360 Y2:433
Until now I thought
it was impossible,

586
02:07:29,636 --> 02:07:31,866  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:398 Y2:430
but, Fester Addams,

587
02:07:31,938 --> 02:07:33,906  X1:293 X2:429 Y1:398 Y2:433
I love you.

588
02:07:35,508 --> 02:07:37,476  X1:303 X2:415 Y1:398 Y2:426
You do?

589
02:07:37,544 --> 02:07:41,344  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:360 Y2:433
Please, I have to know
how you feel about me.

590
02:07:41,414 --> 02:07:43,712  X1:293 X2:429 Y1:398 Y2:433
I love you.

591
02:07:43,783 --> 02:07:45,182  X1:266 X2:455 Y1:398 Y2:433
I worship you.

592
02:07:45,252 --> 02:07:46,981  X1:202 X2:519 Y1:398 Y2:433
I'd do anything for you.

593
02:07:47,053 --> 02:07:48,384  X1:313 X2:408 Y1:398 Y2:433
I'd pay.

594
02:07:48,455 --> 02:07:49,979  X1:316 X2:406 Y1:400 Y2:426
Fester!

595
02:07:50,056 --> 02:07:51,023  X1:308 X2:413 Y1:398 Y2:426

596
02:07:55,495 --> 02:07:57,759  X1:336 X2:384 Y1:398 Y2:426
Oh.

597
02:07:57,831 --> 02:07:59,355  X1:336 X2:384 Y1:398 Y2:426
Oh.

598
02:07:59,432 --> 02:08:00,922  X1:336 X2:384 Y1:398 Y2:426
Oh.

599
02:08:01,001 --> 02:08:02,195  X1:336 X2:384 Y1:398 Y2:426
Oh.

600
02:08:02,269 --> 02:08:03,668  X1:277 X2:445 Y1:398 Y2:426
Look at him.

601
02:08:03,737 --> 02:08:05,932  X1:277 X2:442 Y1:398 Y2:433
So peaceful.

603
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:10,500  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:360 Y2:430
This evening
as I watched Fester and Debbie,

604
02:08:10,577 --> 02:08:12,807  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:360 Y2:433
I kept
my fingers crossed.

605
02:08:12,879 --> 02:08:13,971  X1:299 X2:422 Y1:398 Y2:433
I hoped...

606
02:08:14,047 --> 02:08:15,139  X1:303 X2:419 Y1:398 Y2:433
I prayed.

607
02:08:15,215 --> 02:08:17,240  X1:287 X2:433 Y1:360 Y2:426
Let them
fall in love.

608
02:08:17,317 --> 02:08:19,148  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:398 Y2:433
Let them know happiness.

609
02:08:19,219 --> 02:08:20,345  X1:252 X2:470 Y1:398 Y2:433
Let them adopt.

610
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:22,513  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:400 Y2:431

611
02:08:22,589 --> 02:08:24,318  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:402 Y2:434
great news--

612
02:08:24,391 --> 02:08:26,859  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:360 Y2:426
Something impossible,
a miracle.

613
02:08:26,927 --> 02:08:28,656  X1:281 X2:438 Y1:360 Y2:433
- The rash...
- It's gone.

614
02:08:28,728 --> 02:08:31,424  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:398 Y2:433
I'm engaged.

615
02:08:35,001 --> 02:08:36,229  X1:285 X2:434 Y1:398 Y2:433

616
02:08:36,303 --> 02:08:39,033  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:360 Y2:426
It was our mother's.
She was buried with it.

Oh, no.

625
02:09:02,228 --> 02:09:03,820  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:398 Y2:426
What is it?

626
02:09:03,897 --> 02:09:05,372  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:398 Y2:433
This is unspeakable.

627
02:09:05,539 --> 02:09:07,404  X1:219 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:426
Is something wrong?
Bad news?

628
02:09:07,474 --> 02:09:11,274  X1:149 X2:571 Y1:360 Y2:433
It's the worst thing ever
in the history of human events.

629
02:09:11,345 --> 02:09:13,711  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:360 Y2:433

630
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:14,872  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:398 Y2:433

631
02:09:14,948 --> 02:09:16,415  X1:282 X2:439 Y1:360 Y2:433

great news.

632
02:09:16,483 --> 02:09:17,541  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:398 Y2:426

635
02:09:21,221 --> 02:09:22,449  X1:270 X2:451 Y1:398 Y2:433
I'd kill myself.

638
02:09:26,593 --> 02:09:28,857  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:360 Y2:433

that's disgusting.

639

640
02:09:30,263 --> 02:09:32,697  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:360 Y2:433
like some weird

02:22:54,973 --> 02:22:56,804  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:398 Y2:426
He's a dead man.

895

897
02:23:05,316 --> 02:23:08,342  X1:251 X2:470 Y1:362 Y2:434
It's an American
bald eagle!

898
02:23:08,419 --> 02:23:10,250  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:362 Y2:433
But aren't
they extinct?

899
02:23:10,321 --> 02:23:11,879  X1:263 X2:456 Y1:398 Y2:433
They are now.

900
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:16,492  X1:265 X2:456 Y1:398 Y2:426
Mrs. Addams?

901
02:23:16,561 --> 02:23:17,493  X1:329 X2:390 Y1:400 Y2:426
Yes?

902
02:23:17,562 --> 02:23:19,325  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:360 Y2:433
Your hearse.
Where's the body?

903
02:23:19,397 --> 02:23:20,329  X1:280 X2:441 Y1:398 Y2:433
Right there.

904
02:23:20,398 --> 02:23:21,831  X1:269 X2:453 Y1:398 Y2:426

905
02:23:21,899 --> 02:23:23,298  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:398 Y2:426
Tell me about it!

906
02:23:32,877 --> 02:23:35,368  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:360 Y2:433
Fester, we may be
together for a while...

907
02:23:35,446 --> 02:23:37,505  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:360 Y2:426
All our lives,
cara mia.

908
02:23:37,582 --> 02:23:38,549  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:398 Y2:426
What?

909
02:23:38,616 --> 02:23:39,583  X1:295 X2:434 Y1:398 Y2:426
Mon cher.

910

911
02:23:41,919 --> 02:23:44,854  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:360 Y2:433
If I have to be seen with you,
we need to make some changes.

912
02:23:44,922 --> 02:23:46,822  X1:295 X2:425 Y1:398 Y2:433
Changes?

913
02:24:00,938 --> 02:24:04,430  X1:261 X2:461 Y1:360 Y2:426
Be careful!
It's a credenza!

914
02:24:04,509 --> 02:24:06,136  X1:249 X2:472 Y1:360 Y2:433
These are
beautiful things.

915
02:24:06,210 --> 02:24:07,734  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:360 Y2:433
They're
from catalogues.

Fester,
get over here!

917
02:24:13,985 --> 02:24:15,475  X1:304 X2:418 Y1:398 Y2:426
It itches.

918
02:24:15,553 --> 02:24:18,613  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:360 Y2:426
Don't touch it,
not until the scab falls off.

919
02:24:18,690 --> 02:24:21,750  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:360 Y2:433
Pumpkin, do you think
these clothes are really me?

920
02:24:21,826 --> 02:24:24,124  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:360 Y2:433
Of course not.
That's the point.

921
02:24:24,195 --> 02:24:27,961  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:360 Y2:426
- Where do you want this?
- The second floor boudoir.

922
02:24:28,032 --> 02:24:29,260  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:398 Y2:426
I'm her husband.

923

924
02:24:30,334 --> 02:24:31,767  X1:263 X2:458 Y1:398 Y2:426
Give me a kiss.

925
02:24:31,836 --> 02:24:34,270  X1:269 X2:452 Y1:362 Y2:427
Give me a 20.
Watch it!

926
02:24:34,338 --> 02:24:36,602  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:426
That's a Queen Anne
chandelier!

927
02:24:38,009 --> 02:24:39,840  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:398 Y2:426
"Hawaii is wonderful.

"I wish you were here,

929

"and I can never
see you again!

P.S., Debbie says hi."

931
02:24:47,552 --> 02:24:52,046  X1:116 X2:605 Y1:360 Y2:430
I don't understand.
For weeks not a word, and now this.

932
02:24:52,123 --> 02:24:55,149  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:360 Y2:426
Darling, come to bed.
He can't be serious.

933
02:24:55,226 --> 02:24:57,592  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:360 Y2:433
Have I done something,
said something?

934
02:24:57,662 --> 02:25:00,028  X1:211 X2:510 Y1:360 Y2:433
Why does my brother
despise me?

935
02:25:00,098 --> 02:25:01,929  X1:260 X2:461 Y1:398 Y2:433
He adores you.

936
02:25:01,999 --> 02:25:04,467  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:398 Y2:433
I'd do anything for him.

937
02:25:04,535 --> 02:25:07,595  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:360 Y2:433
At his request,
I would rip out my eyes.

938
02:25:07,672 --> 02:25:10,732  X1:188 X2:535 Y1:360 Y2:433
At his command,
I would crawl on my belly

939
02:25:10,808 --> 02:25:13,470  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:360 Y2:433
through hot coals
and broken glass.

940
02:25:13,544 --> 02:25:14,636  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:398 Y2:433
Why wait?

941
02:25:14,712 --> 02:25:16,509  X1:211 X2:510 Y1:398 Y2:433
Has Fester gone mad?

942
02:25:16,581 --> 02:25:19,709  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:360 Y2:433
This is all just
some sort of phase.

943
02:25:19,784 --> 02:25:20,944  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:398 Y2:433
Post-honeymoon malaise.

944
02:25:21,018 --> 02:25:23,816  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:400 Y2:433
It's very common.

945
02:25:23,888 --> 02:25:26,413  X1:237 X2:487 Y1:360 Y2:433
Do you remember
our honeymoon?

946
02:25:26,491 --> 02:25:29,255  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:398 Y2:433
That glorious cruise.

947
02:25:29,327 --> 02:25:31,090  X1:277 X2:444 Y1:398 Y2:433
No quarrels.

948
02:25:31,162 --> 02:25:32,424  X1:298 X2:424 Y1:400 Y2:426
No cares.

949
02:25:32,497 --> 02:25:35,193  X1:272 X2:449 Y1:400 Y2:427
No survivors.

950
02:25:35,266 --> 02:25:38,292  X1:303 X2:428 Y1:400 Y2:427
Cara mia.

951
02:25:38,369 --> 02:25:40,030  X1:332 X2:387 Y1:400 Y2:426
So...

952
02:25:40,104 --> 02:25:42,732  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:360 Y2:433
you still desire me
after all these years?

953
02:25:42,807 --> 02:25:44,775  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:398 Y2:426
The old ball and chain?

954
02:25:44,842 --> 02:25:45,900  X1:306 X2:416 Y1:400 Y2:426
Forever.

955
02:25:47,044 --> 02:25:48,636  X1:276 X2:446 Y1:398 Y2:433
I'll get them.

956
02:25:51,582 --> 02:25:53,948  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:360 Y2:433
Heads up, campers.
Thejamboree's only two weeks away.

957
02:25:54,018 --> 02:25:57,078  X1:129 X2:591 Y1:360 Y2:426
And you know what that means--
clean cabins.

958
02:25:57,155 --> 02:25:59,020  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:398 Y2:433
Creating with clay and...

959
02:25:59,090 --> 02:26:00,921  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:400 Y2:430
Canoes, canoes, canoes!

960
02:26:00,992 --> 02:26:03,984  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:360 Y2:433
So we better
get cracking, huh?

961
02:26:04,061 --> 02:26:07,121  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:360 Y2:433
Look at this.
I've got them.

962
02:26:07,198 --> 02:26:09,132  X1:194 X2:534 Y1:398 Y2:426
Schizos and Serial Killers.

963
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:11,725  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:360 Y2:426
I have almost
the whole series.

964
02:26:11,803 --> 02:26:15,569  X1:145 X2:578 Y1:360 Y2:433
I'm only missing Jack the Ripper
and that Zodiac guy.

965
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:16,629  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:398 Y2:426
But look.

966
02:26:16,707 --> 02:26:18,538  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:398 Y2:426
"The Black Widow."

967
02:26:18,609 --> 02:26:20,270  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:398 Y2:433
It might be Debbie.

968
02:26:20,344 --> 02:26:23,939  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:398 Y2:426
At least three rich husbands...

969
02:26:24,015 --> 02:26:25,812  X1:303 X2:417 Y1:398 Y2:426
all dead.

970
02:26:25,883 --> 02:26:27,475  X1:273 X2:449 Y1:398 Y2:433
I'll trade you.

971
02:26:27,552 --> 02:26:28,610  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:398 Y2:426
For what?

973
02:26:33,457 --> 02:26:35,823  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:360 Y2:426
Each year,
we conclude our summer

974
02:26:35,893 --> 02:26:38,418  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:360 Y2:433
with a very special
presentation.

975
02:26:38,496 --> 02:26:40,157  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:360 Y2:433
Book, music,
and lyrics by...

976
02:26:40,231 --> 02:26:42,131  X1:264 X2:457 Y1:400 Y2:433

977
02:26:43,734 --> 02:26:45,429  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:398 Y2:433
And this year,

978
02:26:45,503 --> 02:26:48,768  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:360 Y2:433
the old bean has come up
with something pretty exciting--

979
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:51,434  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:360 Y2:433
my own personal salute
to the first Thanksgiving.

980
02:26:51,509 --> 02:26:54,706  X1:205 X2:518 Y1:360 Y2:433
Now, we have thought
long and hard

981
02:26:54,779 --> 02:26:57,907  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:360 Y2:433
about choosing
just the right little actress

982
02:26:57,982 --> 02:27:00,974  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:360 Y2:430
for the leading role
of Sarah Miller,

983
02:27:01,052 --> 02:27:03,247  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:360 Y2:433
our beautiful
and kindly pilgrim lady,

984
02:27:03,321 --> 02:27:06,222  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:398 Y2:426
and we have selected...

986
02:27:12,196 --> 02:27:15,427  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:360 Y2:433
And in the roles
of her pilgrim pals--

987
02:27:15,499 --> 02:27:17,296  X1:263 X2:456 Y1:360 Y2:433

989
02:27:22,573 --> 02:27:26,839  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:360 Y2:433
But, of course,
not everyone can be a star.

990
02:27:26,911 --> 02:27:30,403  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:360 Y2:433
Let's not forget
our cheery little Chippewas

995
02:27:41,192 --> 02:27:42,454  X1:294 X2:426 Y1:398 Y2:430
and, um...

996
02:27:42,526 --> 02:27:45,893  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:360 Y2:433
I'm still not sure just
how to pronounce this.

997
02:27:45,963 --> 02:27:47,760  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:398 Y2:433

Whatever.

1000

1447

1461
02:53:46,851 --> 02:53:48,250  X1:274 X2:447 Y1:398 Y2:433

1462

1478
02:54:43,174 --> 02:54:44,505  X1:309 X2:410 Y1:400 Y2:426

1492
02:55:52,977 --> 02:55:56,469  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:398 Y2:433

1493
02:55:56,547 --> 02:55:57,878  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:398 Y2:433

02:56:18,302 --> 02:56:23,535  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:360 Y2:426
