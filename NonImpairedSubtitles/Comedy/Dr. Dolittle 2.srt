00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,012
I'm somebody's best friend

20
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,014
that's right

21
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,016

22
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,018

23
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,020

00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:43,997

32
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,001
every zoo in the country got
a job for the doc

33
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,004
how long ago did you guys
make a little turtle?

34
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,007

36
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,013
I see what the problem is

37
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,014
I'm gonna give you this pill

38
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,015
I want you to crush it up

39
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,016

00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:08,981
what did they do?

41
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,983
you're looking fine

42
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,985
I'm coming at you

43
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,987
there we give an international celebrity

44
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,989
traveling from Alaska to Australia

45
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:20,993
I'm here with the world famous Dr. Dolittle

46
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,995
who actually speaks with animals

47
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:23,996
what're we gonna do?

48
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:29,001
we sneak up on this unsuspected alligator

49
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,003
we better be quiet or he'll know we're here

50
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,005
the trick to catch it is to wear

51
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:41,013
teeth this big

52
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:45,017
when he catches me

53
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:50,981
I'm gonna bite his hands off

54
00:03:50,981 --> 00:04:03,994
I think he knows. . .

55
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,997
it seems every wants to be a
patient of a good doctor

56
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,999
his family understood

57
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,002
most families did

58
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:17,007
right now I gotta answer the door

59
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,008
who's there?

60
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,011

61
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,013

come on boy, beg

63
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,017
role reversal

64
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,979
usually it's human

65
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,981
you better open up

66
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,983
just open the door

67
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,985
since you're the one who feeds me

68
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:42,991

I got a question for you

136
00:07:55,017 --> 00:08:05,986
why am I on the outside talking
to you on the cell phone?

137
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:06,987
what am I doing?

138
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:07,988
it's the only way to reach you

139
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:08,989
what are you doing here?

140
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,992

141
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,993

142
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,996
that's not dance that's advertise

143
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,998
you don't wanna spend your
birthday with your family?

144
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,000
I had to have dinner when I was younger

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,002
now I'm turning 1 6

146
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,003

147
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,004
you can bring him here

148
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,006
cos you're having dinner here

149
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,008
my parents and my little sister

150
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,010

151

that's private

154
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,020
I can see why it's private

155
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,979
it's embarrassing

156
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,984
since you got 2 Cs and a D on here

157
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,988
you should be the last person
talking about being embarrassing

158
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:49,988
what are you talking about?

159
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:55,994

160
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,998

161
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,000
is it what you mean being embarrassing?

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,001
it's not going to happen

163
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:07,005
that's right. You're going to dinner

164
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,007
no cell phone for a week

165
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,009
what am I supposed to do
without my cell phone?

166
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,011

167
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:25,983

171
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:30,988

172
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:38,996

181
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:11,987
I'm asking a question, punk

182
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:12,988

183
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,990

how old you are

184
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,992
are you threatening me?

185

187
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,000
that was an old man on the cell phone

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,006

189
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,007

I forgot to give you a tip I'm sorry

197
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:14,007
it's cool you do don't have to give a petty tip

198
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,008

199
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:15,008

200
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,010
Eric this is my dad

201
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,014
my man, what's up?

202
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:25,018
we need to stay to have family dinner

203
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,980
this is cool with me

204
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,981
don't be like that

205
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,984
you're gonna ruin the dinner for everybody

206
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,987
don't worry

207
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:38,991
I know how to take of it

208
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:44,997
pup?

209
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,999
Charliz always has a mind of her own

210
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:47,###
a year and a half

211
00:11:47,### --> 00:11:51,003
she decided not to wear diapers
anymore, remember that?

212
00:11:51,003 --> 00:12:00,012
then she started to make
messes around the house

213
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,014
it's cool I can actually learn something

214
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,015
you're really something?

215
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:07,019
cos you've never to take off
your hat at the dinner table

216
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,980
is your head being hot or what?

217
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,982
1 6

218
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:16,987
just think in 2 years she is out of the
house and on her way to college

219
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,989
one year and 1 0 months 1 6 days

220
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,991
Berkeley is a close college

221
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,994
if you go there, you can live
at home and save some money

222
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:24,995
that's a good idea

223
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:28,999
but I already reserved a college
when I graduate from high school

224
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,002
you reserved already?

225
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:38,008
someone to see you

226
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,010
excuse me darling

227
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:46,016
I love you too

228
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,018
you down here

229
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,019
what do you want?

230
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,979
first of all let me beaver wants to
sent a birthday greeting

231
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,981
to your loving daughter

232
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,983
that's very nice

233
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,987
you go tell beaver start getting
out of my nerves

234
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,989
he only wants some moment of your time

235
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,991
what if I say no

236
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,995
I think you need to go in that room

237
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:07,996
you go tell the beaver

238
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:12,000
be in my office 8 o'clock tomorrow

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,003
he knows you're busy

240
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,006
but this is really a matter
of life or death situation

241
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,009
in my car, 7 am . Alright?

242
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,011
this is good news

243
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,013
the beaver likes good news

244
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:43,991
Jimmy, get the car

245
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:50,998
blow the candles and make a wish

246
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:57,004
surprise

247
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,005
give me that

248
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,007
I'm gonna eat that

249
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,009
you lick my fat bump

250
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,012
don't be a pig

251
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:14,021
we're trying to do something nice
to your daughter

252
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,981
you're not 2 little cute kitties

253
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,983
you're just 2 disgusting rats

254
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:18,984
no, we are not

255
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,987
you just ruined the birthday cake

256
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,989
if you write backward of rats

257
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:24,990
it's stars

258
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,992
I'm your star

259
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,994
you know hospital backward?

260
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:37,002
yes it is

261
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,003
diapers!

262
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,005
my favorite, chocolate

263
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:45,010
say miya

264
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,012
what do you think you're doing?

265
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,014
I think he's about to say something

266
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:52,017
bring me a bone

267
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,019
bring me a large plate of flies

268
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,020
super size

269
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:02,986
you'll bring me ham

270
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:10,994
can I talk to Charliz a second?

271
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,997
I'm sorry about tonight

272
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:15,999
I'm thinking about cutting a little work

273
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,002
and spend more time with you guys

274
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,004
great more animals will be here

275
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,005
what if we don't stay here

276
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,006
what about a big vacation in Europe

277
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,007
the whole family?

278
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:28,011
are you serious?

279
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,013
we're going to Paris, Rome, Greeks

280
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,014
just do it

281
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:35,018
what do you think?

282
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,020
is it a bribe?

283
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,982
yes, it's a bribe

284
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,984
it's working

285
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,986
yo doc, one more thing I forgot to tell you

286
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:49,992
tomorrow

287
00:15:49,992 --> 00:16:08,010
tomorrow, we're going to Europe

288
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,011
so the raccoon and the parcel

289
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:13,015
take the road trip to meet the beaver

290
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:16,018
nice wheel, what do you call this thing?

291
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,020
this is a mustang

292
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:31,992
any car that's named after me?

293
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,995
I'm gonna be go over a couple of rules

294
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,998
rule number 1, no sudden movement

295
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:41,001
number 2, do not stare at his teeth

296
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,003
he's got a little rodent bite

297
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,004
I think he needs bracing

298
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,006
but I'm not a dentist

299
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,008
number 3 to 1 0

300
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:51,011
show with respect he deserves

301
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,014
we're talking about the beaver, right?

302
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,015
how're you doing?

303
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,017
how's the hanging?

304
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,019
back away

305
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,979
show some respect to it

306
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,981
the raccoon got a doctor

307
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:13,992
it's a miracle

308
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,994
doctor Dolittle I presume

309
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:16,995
welcome to my bed

310
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,997
do you like a fish

311
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:20,999
on, I've eaten already

312
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,001
when the beaver offers you a fish

313
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,002
you just take the fish

314
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,003
shut up

315
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,005
sorry boss

316
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,008
I read some of the good things
of your bay area family

317
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,011
bay area family

318
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,012
what are you guys

319
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,014
some Mafia or something?

320
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,016
we don't know anything about Mafia

321
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,017
I've never heard of it

322
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,019
that's myth

323
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,020
I'm just a simple fisherman

324
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,981
I'll only be blessed to make friends

325
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,983
you'd be one

326
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,985
what you guys from me?

327
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,987
I'm losing my territory

328
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,990
are other animals moving in
on you or something?

329
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,993
the human kind . They're cutting
down our homes

330
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,995
busting our families

331
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,997
we hear they're cutting down the whole forest

332
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,999
you're talking to the wrong person

333
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,001
you gotta contact the nature groups like

334
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:07,004
that has to be you

335
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,007
you are the only one who know
how to speak human

336
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:12,009
we can't fight humans on my own

337
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,012
they got guns, knives and pull out couches

338
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,014
sure I got rabies, I can bite

339
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,016
but I really can't do so much

340
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,019
you guys have no idea what I'm
talking about, do you?

341
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,020
it's human against nature

342
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,981
but with you on our side that'd be nice

343
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,984
me on your side, I didn't say
I was gonna help you

344
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,986
I didn't say it

345
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,988
before you say no

346
00:18:32,988 --> 00:19:01,016
I'd like you to see what we're talking about

347
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,018
it's gone

348
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:10,984
everything gone

349
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,986
how do you save the forest anyway?

350
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,988
it's not gonna be easy

351
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,991
I assume the lumber companies
have a lot of crowd

352
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,995
but I do know a few endangered
species living in the forest

353
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,997
who definitely have lost the protective

354
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,000
how am I gonna find how many endangered
animals living in the forest

355
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,004
you can ask Eugine

356
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,006
we find the endangered species

357
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,009
the females killed by the poachers

358
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,012
it's the only western Pacific bear

359
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:42,015
at least one bear has to be protected, right?

360
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,017
let the lawyer of the logging
company argue this

361
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,019
since she is the only up there

362
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,980
there's no chance for survival anyway

363
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,982
there had to be a male too

364
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:50,983
so we get a male up there

365
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:51,984
and let them together

366
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,986
let nature take its course

367
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,988
the only male western Pacific bear

368
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:58,991
we can find is raised in captivity

369
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,993
never has a bear raised in captivity

370
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,995
been successfully reintroduced to the wild

371
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,997
they never have a world famous doctor

372
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:10,002
make an introduction

373
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:13,005
your man left the button open

374
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:17,009
something wrong?

375
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:32,983
I hope he didn't see it

376
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:33,984
I know you're really disappointed

377
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,986
disappointed?

378
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:38,989
about not going to Europe?

379
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,991
why'd I be disappointed?

380
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:41,992
I made you a promise

381
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,994
and I'm gonna stick to it

382
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:44,995
you don't want me to it

383
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,997
I understand

384
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:50,000
if I say no . I'll regret for the rest of my life

385
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,001
when do we leave?

386
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,002
as soon as we get the court order

387
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,004
to stop the tree cutting

388
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:59,009
who is going to argue the case?

389
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,011
why are you looking around?

390
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,012
me?

391
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:09,019
not me, you

392
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,020
for the animals

393
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,982
I don't do the animals

394
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:19,988
you are a speciest

395
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,990
we're asking for an injunction

396
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,995
so that we might the chance
to save the species

397
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:30,999
this is a delaying tactic a publicity stunt

398
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:36,004
I have an afidavit signed a range
of experts who'll take them

399
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:41,009
a bear raised in captivity is
reintroduced to the wild

400
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,011
it's dangerous and irresponsible

401
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:48,016
simply raised by a circus who
don't know how to feed

402
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:52,980
let alone let it through its first winter

403
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,983
it 'll certainly succumb to Darwin's law of nature

404
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:59,987
survival of the fittest

405
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:00,988
but Darwin never met my dad

406
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:04,992
young lady, that's inappropriate behavior

407
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:05,993
who's your father?

408
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,996
it's me . I'm her father

409
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:09,997
my name is Dolittle

410
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:14,001
doctor Dolittle

411
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,003
do you feel you can rehabilitate

412
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:20,007
and make it in the wild for the female?

413
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,009
yes I do

414
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,013
in that case I'll delay one month

415
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:32,019
one month, that's it

416
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:37,983
if that bear is capsized in this month

417
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,985
I'll dismiss the order

418
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,987
I understand completely

419
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:48,994
thank you your honor

420
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:51,997
you can speak with the wild animals

421
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:55,000
and the circus bears?

422
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,002
I don't know much about it

423
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,003
I only know it's living in captivity

424
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:07,012
I bet they'll be happy to return to the wild

425
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:10,015
so much for a family vacation

426
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,017
can doctor figure how much it's gonna be?

427
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:49,012
that's before he met Acher

428
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,014
you know what I'm talking about?

429
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:54,017
no, listen .you'll be lucky
winning somebody like her

430
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:58,981
I've had so many girlfriends

431
00:23:58,981 --> 00:23:59,982
I never have a girlfriend

432
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:03,986
just bring her by on Monday

433
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:04,987
I can't her here

434
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:06,989
you have to go to her

435
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:07,990
go to her, where?

436
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,993
she is in the forest

437
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:15,998
I don't play in the forest

438
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:19,001
do you what kind of beer you are?

439
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:22,004
I'm a singer, dancer

440
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:24,006
you're an endangered species

441
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:28,010
is that a threat? Cos my lawyer. . .

442
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:34,016
you're a very rare bear. You're
called the western Pacific bear

443
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:37,019
I know I can play any bears

444
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,021
western, polar

445
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,982
I'm freezing

446
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:45,986
your ancestors came from the
mountain of California

447
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,988
when you were 6 months they
took you from your mother

448
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:52,993
they taught how to dance
according to a hound dog

449
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:53,994
I taught myself that

450
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:57,998
cos I'm a panda bear

451
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:02,002
yes funny stuff

452
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,003
what I'm proposing to you is

453
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:06,006
I'd like you back to your ancestors' room

454
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:09,009
and teach you to be a real bear

455
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:13,013
I like the bear I'm... I'm famous

456
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,014
do you have a gift shop?

457
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,016
I have my own baby

458
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,019
you do this I promise you'll
be the most famous bear in the world

459
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,979
famous that pooh

460
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:21,980
are you kidding me?

461
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,982
you pull this off and you're saying

462
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:24,983
Winnie the who?

463
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,986
you got yourself a bear?

464
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,989
and what's the most unusual
story of the year

465
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:34,993
doctor Dolittle is going to
rewrite the law of nature

466
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:38,997
by tempting to reintroduce a
performing bear into the wild

467
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:43,001
and in doing do hoped to save an
entire force from destruction

468
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:45,003
it's Darwin versus Dolittle

469
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:47,005
get over yourself

470
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:51,009
I got 2 lumber millers waiting for that wood

471
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:54,012
I understand but it's complicated

472
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:59,017
especially if that bear survives

473
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,980
you're the one who's going to be endangered

474
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,984
that bear is bound to screw up

475
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:10,988
when he does, have yourselves a little toy

476
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:41,018
I have just the place to put it

477
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:44,980
so we're going to the forest
waiting for Acher to arrive

478
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,982
when the family's settled

479
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:52,988
I'm starting to look for mount number one

480
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:55,991
looks like a good place

481
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:59,995
simple pleasure

482
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:08,003
that woof is a fox

483
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:10,005
you like that

484
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:16,011
there's more where I came from

485
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,012
what is that?

486
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:20,015
some kinda secret lady dog's code

487
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,016
you like me?

488
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:28,982
this is called back scratching

489
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:29,983
where are you going?

490
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,985
call me

491
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,987
so the big day finally came

492
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:34,988
I have a feeling

493
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,991
the fur is gonna fly

494
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,993
you all know why we're here

495
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,996
we're about to do something
we've never done before

496
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,998
everyone thinks we can't pull this off

497
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,000
they got their blaze sharpened

498
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,002
truck ready to roll

499
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:53,006
we're going to prove them wrong, right?

500
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,008
I want everybody to put their claw together

501
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,011

502
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:06,019

503
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:09,982

504
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:13,986

505
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,988
is it some kinda joke?

506
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:17,990
I wanna go serious on you for a second

507
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,993

508
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,995

509
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:49,980

510
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,983
the show is over

511
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,985
you got your work cut out for you pal

512
00:28:54,985 --> 00:29:01,992
ok I'm done . Turn it off

513
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,994
it's so dirty

514
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:07,998
yes, it's a shit hole

515
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:08,999
is that her?

516
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:12,002
she is a babe

517
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,004
look at the way she walks

518
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:16,006
I love her wet

519
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:18,008
I'm going over to introduce you

520
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:21,011
you just wait here

521
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,013
tell her I really her fat pouch

522
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,014
but don't be cruel

523
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:30,979
I'll try to work that

524
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:31,980
are you coming over here?

525
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,984
I'm real busy foraging

526
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:36,985
my name is John

527
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,987
I'm Eva

528
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:39,988
that's a pretty name

529
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:40,989
nice to meet you

530
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,991
a quick question

531
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,994
how would you like to meet your man of dream?

532
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:46,995
you're real cute

533
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,998
but I don't go for the other species

534
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:50,999
I'm not talking about man

535
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,001
I'm talking about a male bear

536
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,002
how would you like to meet the

537
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:58,006
big magnificent male over there

538
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:01,009
I don't think I see him

539
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,012
is he standing behind that tree?

540
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:06,014
let me explain what's going on

541
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:08,016
there's a logging company that's

542
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,018
trying to tear down this forest

543
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,020
the only I can stop is

544
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,982
I bring 2 western Pacific bear together

545
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,984
you're a western Pacific bear so is he

546
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:17,985
if I can the 2 of you together

547
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:21,989
and you make a little western Pacific bear

548
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:27,995
you see where I'm going?

549
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:32,###
hey Acher come over here

550
00:30:32,### --> 00:30:38,005
I think we can work it out

551
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,006
what do I say to her?

552
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,007
tell her a little more about yourself

553
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:44,011
tell her a little more about yourself

554
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:47,014
I like walking on the beach

555
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:50,017
and sharing pop corns with someone

556
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,019
and also the sound of back street boys

557
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:54,021
you're weird

558
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:58,984
weird? Isn't sexy

559
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:04,990
why don't you let me take it from here

560
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,992
what do you think of Acher, cute?

561
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:08,994
don't make me eat you

562
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:10,996
I know he's a little uncomfortable
with female around

563
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:13,999
that's not even the point

564
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,000
I need a real bear

565
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,004
someone who can hunt and provide for me

566
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:23,008
I'm already involved with someone

567
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:25,010
you have a bear friend already

568
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,013
are you in love with this bear

569
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:30,015
my cousin married for love but she

570
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:34,019
know her husband has another in the north

571
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,020
so you're not in love

572
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,981
so let's make a deal

573
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,984
in one month's time, I'm going to

574
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:41,985
turn that bear into someone

575
00:31:41,985 --> 00:32:03,006
you'll be proud to have little baby bears of

576
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,008
perfect night

577
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:07,010
so you're just breathing the country air

578
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:11,014
and listening to the crickets chirping?

579
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:13,016
you know what the crickets are saying?

580
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:17,020
I don't know. You're the one who
speaks to the animals

581
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,981
a monkey don't come to me asking
for malt of 40 ounce

582
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:21,984
I can't do that I stay in the room

583
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,986
you ever seen me talk to an animal?

584
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:26,989
slow down a little

585
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:28,991
the crickets are the human temperature

586
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,993
you can tell how colder it is

587
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:37,###
the faster they're chirping

588
00:32:37,### --> 00:33:08,989
it seems a little colder

589
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:18,999
what's up baby?

590
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,001
maybe you should tell me what's up

591
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:28,008
I'm gonna stay a couple of days if it is cool

592
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:31,011
what is that you don't understand?

593
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,012
his bag

594
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:34,014
he's staying for a couple of nights

595
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:38,018
mama said so

596
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:42,981
you're gonna sleep on the
sleeping bag on the floor

597
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,984
by the way I'm watching you

598
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,986
not just me I got all the eyes all around the woods

599
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:50,989
you know I talk to birds, right?

600
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:55,994
you watch your back

601
00:33:55,994 --> 00:34:03,001
I'm watching you

602
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:06,004
can we see what else is on?

603
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:09,007
no you gotta watch this and learn

604
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:12,010
how to survive in the winter

605
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,012
what's he doing? Digging?

606
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:19,017
you don't even know what sharp
claws are for?

607
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:21,019
bears're excellent swimmers

608
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,020
not this bear

609
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,982
you're not just sitting there telling
me you can't swim

610
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:29,987
haven't you ever heard there is a
new invention called boat

611
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:31,989
tomorrow we're gonna get up at the crack of dawn

612
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,992
I'm gonna teach you how to fish

613
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,994
and so began the bearathon

614
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,997
the training is so unbearable

615
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:42,###
so hairy. Ok, that's all

616
00:34:42,### --> 00:34:45,002
this might be full of fish . Let's go

617
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:47,004
so are lobsters

618
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:48,005
look at the water

619
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:50,007
that's where the fish is

620
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:53,010
there's one touched me

621
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:58,015
I want you to put your head
down and grab a fish

622
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:00,017
I want you to do just like what you saw on TV

623
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:03,020
put your head under the water and catch a fish

624
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,980
I'm here with you . Go under water

625
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,986
I'm trying

626
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,988
that's Achder

627
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:18,994
what's up?

628
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:20,996
you get one

629
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:38,013
I can't breathe

630
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,015
tell me how smart you can be to
lift your head out of the water

631
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,016
when you can't breathe?

632
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,018
I saw a light

633
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,979
it was beautiful

634
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:46,980
let me take you for a swim

635
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,983
that'll sharpen you up

636
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,985
we're gonna find something you can catch

637
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:58,992
I saw my grandmum

638
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:07,000
come on eat

639
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,002
am I close?

640
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:11,004
cold

641
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:12,005
and the force

642
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:15,008
colder? Warmer

643
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,009
attic

644
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:18,011
how is going?

645
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,013
it's going great. We bare need 3 weeks

646
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:23,016
he's already foraging grapes

647
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,017
I can't see why he's walking away

648
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:27,020
he's circling the grapes

649
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,981
why? Are they dangerous grapes?

650
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:33,986
grapes are not dangerous?

651
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:47,###
he's doing great. We're right on schedule

652
00:36:47,### --> 00:36:51,003
explain it to me again

653
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:53,005
I'm going to crawl into a dark space

654
00:36:53,005 --> 00:36:55,007
and sleep for 6 months

655
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:57,009
it's called hyphenation

656
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,011
it sounds depressing

657
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:01,013
how do I eat?

658
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:05,017
you eat a lotta enough and last the whole winter

659
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:12,983
where is the bathroom?

660
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:13,984
a week before you start hyphenating

661
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:23,994
you eat dirt, moss, hair and green glass

662
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:35,005
it blocks my butt?

663
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:37,007
you want me to sleep for 6 months

664
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:43,013
with a big cork in my butt

665
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:50,979
come back here see ya

666
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:55,984
I'll leak the gas and sleep in
the back with the kids

667
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:56,985
this isn't gonna work

668
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,987
I almost drowned

669
00:37:58,987 --> 00:37:59,988
Evy doesn't like me

670
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:01,990
I'm sick and tired of your complaints

671
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,993
look up at the tree, what do you see?

672
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:06,995
a bird

673
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:07,996
a bird and its home

674
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:09,998
and below is a squirrel

675
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:13,001
down is a little rabbit in his home

676
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,003
all these animals are depending on you

677
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:18,006
you can do it. Just listen to your inner bear

678
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:19,007
just trust him

679
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:43,991
he'll tell you what to do

680
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:55,002
is it really necessary?

681
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,003
go in there

682
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,004
why?

683
00:38:57,004 --> 00:39:16,982
there're a couple of bears inside
who want to meet you

684
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:20,986
do I hear someone talking

685
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:23,989
these kids today have no respect

686
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:28,994
I think he needs us to teach him a lesson

687
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:31,997
get over here I'm gonna give you a bear hug

688
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:50,015
actaully it's going quite well

689
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:55,979
looks like everybody like music

690
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,982
while the cats are away, the mouse will play

691
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:20,003
I mean teenagers

692
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,005
you gotta a cover

693
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:25,008
there is something I've been
meaning to do since I gotta here

694
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:38,981
what is that?

695
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:40,983
your plan worked out

696
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:42,985
the drink is on me

697
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:46,989
mean while the doc's giving Acher a lesson

698
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:48,991
could you leave a little for me

699
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,993
cos technically it belongs. . .

700
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:52,995
just a thought

701
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:59,001
what's going here?

702
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:03,005
you don't have to put up
with that, get out of here

703
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:05,007
that's one hot fox

704
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:07,009
don't you know every female is looking

705
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:08,010
for the strongest female

706
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,012
what about personality?

707
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:14,016
I'd rather die a virgin

708
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:19,021
alpha male is the boss. lt is the boss male

709
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:22,983
alpha male should learn how to walk

710
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:24,985
like an alpha male

711
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:29,990
walk the walk

712
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,993
it's about power

713
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:38,999
unchecked, uncompromise

714
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:40,000
didn't I ask you to line the garbage pales

715
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,003
you line them you damn self

716
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:45,005
what?

717
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:52,012
I was talking with the animals

718
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,014
I'm on my way. I'm going to
get food right here

719
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:55,015
go I'm going?

720
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:57,017
where're you going?

721
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:58,018
talk the talk. shut up

722
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,020
you telling me to shut up?

723
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,979
I am talking to the animals

724
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:09,988
I'm going to get the food

725
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:17,996
sure you don't want this thing?

726
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:19,998
I have a question

727
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:22,000
you say you'll spend your
whole life in show business

728
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:32,010
when is it gonna be a big finish?

729
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,012
I mean in life

730
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:35,013
who do you share your success with?

731
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:42,980
your hopes, dreams, fear and failure

732
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,982
sometimes I'm lonely

733
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:46,984
I've never been in love

734
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:47,985
this is your chance

735
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,987
I think Evy really likes you

736
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:52,990
did she say something?

737
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,993
you gotta read between the line

738
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:58,996
she loves me? I knew it

739
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:10,007
you shouldn't be carried away

740
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,009
I think it's the mushroom cos

741
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:14,011
you've eaten a whole bag

742
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:16,013
tomorrow you're gonna see a brand new bear

743
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:20,017
I think I'll call it a night

744
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:22,019
it's a little scary out here

745
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:28,984
can you stay until I fall asleep

746
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:32,988
I'll wait until you fall asleep

747
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:36,992
can you leave a light on?

748
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:38,994
the light stays on

749
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:59,014
keep this here

750
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:13,987
it's a new Acher in town

751
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:15,989
feel windy

752
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:22,996
feel the muscle cramp

753
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:24,998
don't quit

754
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:29,002
my butt stinks

755
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:39,012
can you rub my butt, please

756
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:42,015
doc finally realized he wasn't able to make

757
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:45,018
Acher fast enough to impress Evy

758
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:49,982
maybe he can make him sweater

759
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:52,985
how can anybody be so beautiful

760
00:44:52,985 --> 00:44:59,992
why don't you go over and tell her?

761
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:04,997
that's Sunny, her little bear friend

762
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:06,999
don't get discouraged

763
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:09,001
you can win her over

764
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:12,004
you just figure out what she likes

765
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:15,007
let's take my wife . .

766
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:16,008
I'm sorry

767
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:18,010
she likes to be surprised

768
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:21,013
like jumping out of the bushes and sreaming?

769
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:24,016
do something romantic

770
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:25,017
say I'm thinking about you all the time

771
00:45:25,017 --> 00:45:28,020
you're always on my mind

772
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,981
you say that all the time?

773
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,983
I used to

774
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:37,988
lately I'm caught up in this

775
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:50,000
I think I need a little practice

776
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,003
what are you doing?

777
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:57,007
it's all about you tonight

778
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:59,009
I sent the children up to the movies

779
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:07,017
and the bears camping in the woods

780
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:10,020
you can see me

781
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,983
I'm blending, getting interwoven . . .

782
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:20,989
I can give you some pointer

783
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:21,990
where were we?

784
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,993
you were thinking about the candles
and some wine would up make for

785
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:29,998
annoying me for the last few days

786
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:37,005
I know something that'll be able to resist

787
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:39,007
is it our wedding song?

788
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:43,011
that's not fair

789
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:45,013
show is about to start

790
00:46:45,013 --> 00:47:01,989
what show?

791
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:04,992
he is good

792
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:10,998
he scratched my belly the other day

793
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,###
what's going on?

794
00:47:12,### --> 00:47:17,004
he is truly in love with her

795
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,005
give her some garbage

796
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:33,020
chicks like garbage

797
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,982
get out of here all of you

798
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:37,983
this is really helpful

799
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,986
I'm learning a lot, truly

800
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:42,988
we'll discuss tomorrow

801
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:53,999
you're gonna discuss what tomorrow?

802
00:47:53,999 --> 00:48:01,006
why don't you sit on the couch?

803
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:03,008
what she said doc?

804
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:10,015
she said she loves me so much that
I can sleep on the couch

805
00:48:10,015 --> 00:48:28,992
I'm a man on the couch

806
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:33,997
Romeo is on the move

807
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:39,002
there he goes

808
00:48:39,002 --> 00:48:42,005
I was only going to the bathroom

809
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:50,013
you can hold it

810
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:53,016
what's wrong with your voice?

811
00:48:53,016 --> 00:49:03,986
why don't you put some sugar in . . .

812
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:11,994
is that our song?

813
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:15,998
you should learn to climb trees

814
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:17,###
that's a bruise

815
00:49:17,### --> 00:49:20,002
come on out of there never

816
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:28,010
I'm sure it wasn't that bad

817
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,013
I understand . We can fix it

818
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:33,015
we just need to work a little harder

819
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:38,020
we're staying here we'll make
our own bear suit

820
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:39,021
cos we were wondering it'd be alright

821
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:41,982
if every animal in the entire forest

822
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:43,984
is going to stay with you next week?

823
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:47,988
I want you to come out right now

824
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:50,991
who are you calling a coward?

825
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:56,997
you're a big coward for a quit like this

826
00:49:56,997 --> 00:50:00,000
my wife and my daughters are mad at me

827
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,003
I'm spending my vacation with a pizza boy

828
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:08,008
now listening to you furry cry baby telling me

829
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:13,013
it's too hard

830
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:17,017
Evy laughed at me

831
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:20,979
she is even better than a coward like you

832
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:27,986
I didn't poke a bear

833
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:28,987
I'm warning

834
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:29,988
I'm poking you

835
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:40,999
stop it

836
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:45,003
that was good, bear like

837
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:51,009
you just take your ass back to the circus

838
00:50:51,009 --> 00:52:42,996
I'm an alpha bear

839
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:44,998
there was love in the air

840
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:52,005
be a man

841
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:54,007
now you listen to me

842
00:52:54,007 --> 00:53:07,980
you're in my house now

843
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,984
you wanna go out with me tonight?

844
00:53:11,984 --> 00:53:14,987
what you think you're doing?

845
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:20,993
I'm not doing anything

846
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:22,995
you marked my tree

847
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:27,###
I don't even know what those words mean

848
00:53:27,### --> 00:53:32,004
I drink a lot of water

849
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:39,011
it smells like lemonade

850
00:53:39,011 --> 00:53:41,013
it smells like anomia

851
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:44,016
I'm getting dizzy

852
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:46,018
let's beat it

853
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:47,019
what're you doing?

854
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:48,020
we're having fun

855
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:51,982
you make a very handsome couple

856
00:53:51,982 --> 00:54:01,992
I hate myself

857
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:03,994
if you want it I'll go up

858
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:06,997
don't even think about it

859
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:10,000
I'm gonna go get it for you

860
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,006
it's too dangerous. Promise me

861
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:20,010
I like you too

862
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,012
what're you girls doing over here?

863
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:26,016
beat it, circus boy

864
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:33,982
your charm is matched only by your odor

865
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:39,988
what's he saying? I'm confused

866
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:44,993
you think you get used to it?

867
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:46,995
maybe you'll be better being with me

868
00:54:46,995 --> 00:54:52,000
don't do worse

869
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:05,013
you'll only be a city bear I need more than that

870
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:10,018
shall we put our cards on the table?

871
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:12,020
this bear you brought up here

872
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,983
is much likely to have little bear babies

873
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:21,989
it ain't gonna happen

874
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:24,992
here's my offer

875
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:28,996
I'll set aside 1 0 acres turning it into a sanctuary

876
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:40,007
you can bring your animal buddies there

877
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:42,009
that's the offer

878
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:44,011
the dead line is Wednesday 1 2 noon

879
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:46,013
let me be clear it's 1 2:01

880
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:49,016
we'll be sending every piece of equipment

881
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:55,981
we got. By Friday there won't be
a tree standing there

882
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:57,983
I need to run this by my wife

883
00:55:57,983 --> 00:56:04,990
there's a pay phone in the back

884
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:06,992
phone the wife

885
00:56:06,992 --> 00:56:17,002
always a sign of weakness

886
00:56:17,002 --> 00:56:30,015
I know what to do I got my thing finished

887
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:32,017
I gotta tell you this thing is over

888
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:34,019
sorry to drag you in all of this

889
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,979
might as well give you an audition in Vegas

890
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:37,981
cos these guys offered me a deal

891
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:38,982
this is the best I can do

892
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:41,985
the best you can do is not give up on me

893
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:46,990
you told me, listen to your inner bear

894
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:50,994
I know how I can win Evy

895
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:51,995
I know I'm dumb or something

896
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:58,001
I'm giving you one more chance

897
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:01,004
the ice cream is acting up

898
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:06,009
I got depressed by Sunny and Eva

899
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:12,015
I realized I'm in love with Eva

900
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:14,017
don't you dare throw up on me

901
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:17,980
it's gonna come out

902
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,983
you gotta sit down on the toilet

903
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:25,988
you gotta lift it up first

904
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:29,992
I'm gonna keep guard you just sit there

905
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:30,993
I'll meet you one second

906
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:31,994
I gotta take care of some business

907
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:33,996
what are you talking in there?

908
00:57:33,996 --> 00:57:33,996
I was talking to myself

909
00:57:33,996 --> 00:57:35,998
I gotta. . .

910
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:37,###
sometimes I gotta coax it down

911
00:57:37,### --> 00:57:44,006
you must have some little pet talk

912
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:56,018
let me get the window open

913
00:57:56,018 --> 00:58:01,982
it's worse than I thought

914
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:02,983
you just ate ice cream?

915
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:14,995
that's not ice cream

916
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:27,007
no deal . Thanks for your time

917
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:34,014
was that me?

918
00:58:34,014 --> 00:59:56,013
I'm trying to blend

919
00:59:56,013 --> 01:00:13,989
your mother is little worried

920
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:14,990
I knew something was bothering you

921
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,992
tell me

922
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:19,995
daughter to daddy

923
01:00:19,995 --> 01:00:25,000
you wanna cry, we cry together

924
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,002
nothing stop

925
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:31,006
it must be the mountain messing me up I'm fine

926
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:43,018
you sure you're alright

927
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:53,987
take your time I'm in the house

928
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:54,988
talking time's done

929
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:58,992
it's time to be bold

930
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:08,001
he's going up to the high

931
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:16,009
this cliff is higher than I remember

932
01:01:16,009 --> 01:01:18,011
you come back here . Get back

933
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:23,016
I'm doing it or die

934
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:26,019
what are you doing here?

935
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:31,984
I'm not gonna win Eva by
eating a bunch of worms

936
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:34,987
I need to show her how much
she means to me

937
01:01:34,987 --> 01:01:39,992
if you fall you're just stupid

938
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:44,997
circus boy got a little trick

939
01:01:44,997 --> 01:01:52,004
it's not gonna hold

940
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:57,009
I'll buy you the honey

941
01:01:57,009 --> 01:02:00,012
break

942
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:01,013
I want you to come down

943
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:04,016
I'm fine

944
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:06,018
there're bees

945
01:02:06,018 --> 01:02:08,020
don't move

946
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:15,986
they're sting me

947
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:39,009
protect the hive

948
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:41,011
jump circus boy

949
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:58,987
go eat the salmon

950
01:02:58,987 --> 01:02:59,988
why'd you do something like that

951
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:01,990
are you crazy?

952
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:05,994
I could have got that hive if I wanted it

953
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:07,996
we're not working out

954
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:14,002
take a hike

955
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:18,006
I mean would you like more honey?

956
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:21,009
you're ready to talk about presuming the species

957
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:31,019
we could talk or you count to a
hundred and cone to get me

958
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:35,983
focus

959
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:41,989
I should really in the open

960
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:56,003
pace yourself not so fast

961
01:03:56,003 --> 01:04:03,010
daddy is back

962
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,013
what happened?

963
01:04:06,013 --> 01:04:10,017
it's Acher

964
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:29,995
folks we got a wild animal coming through

965
01:04:29,995 --> 01:04:29,995
I'm doctor Dolittle

966
01:04:29,995 --> 01:04:31,997
what happened?

967
01:04:31,997 --> 01:04:33,999
he broke down the back door

968
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:40,005
we found him ransacking in the kitten

969
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:44,009
let's move up show is over

970
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:47,012
it's me what happened?

971
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:49,014
I was so close

972
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:51,016
they came out of no where

973
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:55,979
are you ready to save the forest?

974
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,982
we're setting aside 1 0 acres of the forest

975
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:03,987
we cal it doctor wild life sanctuary

976
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:05,989
speak of the devil

977
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:11,995
you think you've won but you haven't

978
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:17,000
thanks very much . That's all for today

979
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,001
we only have an eyewitness

980
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:20,003
did anybody see what happened?

981
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:22,005
we got one problem

982
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:24,007
it's a freaking weasel

983
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:26,009
what did he do?

984
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:33,016
weasel, the doctor is here

985
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:40,983
did you see what happen to the bear?

986
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:43,986
you give me your watch I'll
tell you what you need to know

987
01:05:43,986 --> 01:05:49,992
you're such a weasel

988
01:05:49,992 --> 01:05:53,996
an animal? You can't offer them evidence

989
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:55,998
you got a better idea?

990
01:05:55,998 --> 01:05:59,001
I'll stall the trial maybe we hire
a private investigator

991
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:03,005
they're going to take Acher to Mexico

992
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:04,006
if you go on the witness stand

993
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:06,008
Riley is going to tear you to shreds

994
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:11,013
what do I have to lose?
your reputation

995
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:16,018
I'm not giving up these animals easy

996
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:18,020
we admit it was a setback

997
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:30,991
but we'd like one more week
to rehabitate the bear

998
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:35,996
what if I could prove the entire
thing is a setup?

999
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:38,999
that'd be a very serious allegation

1000
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:42,002
do you intend to present the evidence?

1001
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:45,005
we have an eyewitness

1002
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:49,009
can I address to the court just a minute?

1003
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:51,011
we have an eyewitness who can testify

1004
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:55,015
he heard the gunshot and a truck
back to the area

1005
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:58,018
is that witness here in the court?

1006
01:06:58,018 --> 01:07:03,982
it's not in the court cos he's. . .

1007
01:07:03,982 --> 01:07:13,992
he's a weasel

1008
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:15,994
I know this seems very unreasonable

1009
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:17,996
I can talk to animals

1010
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:22,000
this did come forward

1011
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:29,007
I have no problem doctor Dolittle
to question the witness

1012
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:31,009
I'd like a brief recess so that I'll have

1013
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:38,016
an opportunity to get a camera
to have a snapshot

1014
01:07:38,016 --> 01:07:43,981
if he needs immunity we can provide
animal protection

1015
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:46,984
I'd not allow you to make a mockery
in my courtroom

1016
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:48,986
the deadline has passed

1017
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:51,989
the motion to delay is denied

1018
01:07:51,989 --> 01:08:00,998
that's a shame

1019
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:12,009
could you tell us what the weasel
wanted to say?

1020
01:08:12,009 --> 01:08:15,012
you come to get me out?

1021
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:16,013
what do you mean sort of?

1022
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:19,016
I couldn't prove your story

1023
01:08:19,016 --> 01:08:22,019
they what?

1024
01:08:22,019 --> 01:08:29,985
they think you'd be too dangerous
to be set free

1025
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:42,998
they sold you to a Mexican circus

1026
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:49,004
everything . I dragged you out and
put you through all this stuff

1027
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:53,008
like I've ruined your life

1028
01:08:53,008 --> 01:08:56,011
you gave me a life

1029
01:08:56,011 --> 01:08:58,013
you even taught me about love

1030
01:08:58,013 --> 01:09:07,981
no one can ever take that away from me

1031
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:08,982
mama wanted me to tell you that

1032
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:21,995
the appeal's been denied

1033
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:25,999
you're back to your show business

1034
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:30,003
I just want eva

1035
01:09:30,003 --> 01:09:34,007
maybe I wasn't meant to be loved

1036
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:48,981
everybody is meant to be loved

1037
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:50,983
since when?

1038
01:09:50,983 --> 01:09:54,987
a couple of weeks ago

1039
01:09:54,987 --> 01:09:56,989
at first I was kinda fuzzy

1040
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:02,995
now I'm really clear

1041
01:10:02,995 --> 01:10:04,997
this is what you've been keeping from us right?

1042
01:10:04,997 --> 01:10:07,###
don't say anything cos I don't want to be a freak

1043
01:10:07,### --> 01:10:13,005
you're not gonna be a freak

1044
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:14,006
when it started to happen to me

1045
01:10:14,006 --> 01:10:16,008
I got scared too

1046
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:29,980
this is a good thing

1047
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:30,981
now I know what I've been missing

1048
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:35,986
a family. I guess it's something I'll never have

1049
01:10:35,986 --> 01:10:37,988
you gotta help him

1050
01:10:37,988 --> 01:10:40,991
isn't there something that we can do?

1051
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:43,994
not just him I mean all the animal

1052
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:48,999
so many of them

1053
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:57,007
there are so many of them

1054
01:10:57,007 --> 01:11:00,010
you guys have given up haven't you?

1055
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:02,012
what am I gonna do, I'm 6 years old

1056
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:04,014
I am not a young beaver no more

1057
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:07,017
beside, we've been living
in this forest how long?

1058
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:11,980
about 1 00 years we've been
shacking in the forest

1059
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:14,983
I can't do this by myself

1060
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:15,984
you guys wanna save your home

1061
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:16,985
you gotta help me

1062
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:18,987
whether you'll believe it

1063
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:25,994
you guys have untapped power

1064
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:27,996
you got a heart of the lion

1065
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:29,998
or just strong like an ox

1066
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:30,999
eyes like an eagle

1067
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:33,001
movement swift like a gazette

1068
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:35,003
or you stink like a skunk

1069
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:37,005
sorry, I'm trying to make my point here

1070
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:38,006
what I'm trying to say is

1071
01:11:38,006 --> 01:11:40,008
we can do this

1072
01:11:40,008 --> 01:12:09,997
just don't do it without a fight

1073
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:12,###
listen don't stall with me

1074
01:12:12,### --> 01:12:26,013
everybody take your position

1075
01:12:26,013 --> 01:12:29,016
roll them up

1076
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:32,019
I have never seen anything like this before

1077
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:37,983
none of them're having milk

1078
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:38,984
what's wrong?

1079
01:12:38,984 --> 01:12:50,996
strike

1080
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:57,002
go get the fribee

1081
01:12:57,002 --> 01:13:15,020
strike

1082
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:16,980
all the animals are working together

1083
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,984
you'll be out of here in no time

1084
01:13:20,984 --> 01:13:23,987
animals can't organize

1085
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:39,002
you may want to take a look at this yourself

1086
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:43,006
maybe you should talk to Dolittle

1087
01:13:43,006 --> 01:13:46,009
giving in to a bunch of beasts
lowering our life form?

1088
01:13:46,009 --> 01:13:47,010
I can take democrats

1089
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:57,980
I can take animals

1090
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:01,984
retreat

1091
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:23,005
organized

1092
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:39,021
I heard something

1093
01:14:39,021 --> 01:15:00,000
don't make any move

1094
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,007
you locked the door

1095
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:08,008
I think you should run

1096
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:23,982
I'm an attorney. I'm not with him

1097
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:25,984
I'm sure we can work something out

1098
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:29,988
I'm gonna call doctor Dolittle

1099
01:15:29,988 --> 01:15:44,002
no sudden move or I'm gonna bite you

1100
01:15:44,002 --> 01:15:47,005
Mr, Potter, how are you sir?

1101
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:50,008
I'm here with a couple of your friends

1102
01:15:50,008 --> 01:15:53,011
I don't think you believe animals'd organize

1103
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:57,015
I don't know what to think anymore

1104
01:15:57,015 --> 01:16:00,018
I'll be happy to set up a meeting
with you and the animals

1105
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:02,980
so that we can work out our problem

1106
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:05,983
it's the only way for you to admit

1107
01:16:05,983 --> 01:16:08,986
so you won't look like an idiot

1108
01:16:08,986 --> 01:16:12,990
just call them off

1109
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:14,992
put the raccoon on the phone

1110
01:16:14,992 --> 01:16:16,994
he wants to speak to you

1111
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:19,997
make it short

1112
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:21,999
I got it all under control

1113
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:24,001
I'll call you back

1114
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:26,003
I'm here only a mediator

1115
01:16:26,003 --> 01:16:29,006
this negotiation is between Mr Potter

1116
01:16:29,006 --> 01:16:36,013
the representatives of the local wildlife

1117
01:16:36,013 --> 01:16:40,017
this is my new proposal

1118
01:16:40,017 --> 01:16:44,021
what kind of territory we're looking at

1119
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:48,984
only 1 2 acres here

1120
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:49,985
they like it

1121
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:50,986
I'll give you something you like

1122
01:16:50,986 --> 01:17:01,997
like this

1123
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:03,999
meanwhile the strike kept rolling

1124
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:17,012
even the pros're getting in on the act

1125
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:22,017
no, no . we won't go

1126
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:37,991
you try running a mile

1127
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:47,000
I don't feel like jumping any hoops today

1128
01:17:47,000 --> 01:18:06,019
hope you'll fill in there

1129
01:18:06,019 --> 01:18:09,982
give me a bear hug

1130
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:10,983
you're not leaving here

1131
01:18:10,983 --> 01:18:12,985
until you get a bear hug

1132
01:18:12,985 --> 01:18:20,993
just a little one

1133
01:18:20,993 --> 01:18:30,002
you crushed my spine

1134
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:35,007
drive safe now

1135
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:40,012
are you in there?

1136
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:42,014
I just stopped by to say hello

1137
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:46,018
thanks for everything

1138
01:18:46,018 --> 01:18:48,020
Acher, I'm ready

1139
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,980
she is in heat

1140
01:18:49,980 --> 01:19:02,993
gotta go save the species

1141
01:19:02,993 --> 01:19:08,999
it's quite a summer

1142
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:25,015
what are you doing here?

1143
01:19:25,015 --> 01:19:34,983
Charliz and the doc were closer than ever

1144
01:19:34,983 --> 01:19:43,992
you'll blend trust me

1145
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:47,996
look at me I'm blending again

1146
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:49,998
right you're invisible

1147
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:52,000
good job

1148
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,004
they doubt the black master is back

1149
01:19:56,004 --> 01:20:02,010
I'm king of the third world

1150
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:12,980
but the best news of all came
the following spring

1151
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,983
step, step turn kick step

1152
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:20,988
I thought it was step kick turn step, step

1153
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:24,992
I thought you've retired.

1154
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:27,494
ok, from the chorus
