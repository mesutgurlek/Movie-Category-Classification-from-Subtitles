1
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:07,720
Inside a snowflake,
like the one on yoursleeve...

2
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:11,925
...there happened a story
you mustsee to believe.

3
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:31,361
Way up in the mountains,
in the high range of Pontoos...

4
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:34,120
...lay the small town of Whoville:

5
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:35,920
The home of the Whos.

6
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:43,280
Ask any Who, and they'll have this to say:

7
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:47,565
''There is no place like Whoville
around Christmas Day.''

8
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:50,766
Every window was flocked,
every lamppost was dressed...

9
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:55,045
...and the Whoville band marched
in their Christmasy best.

10
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,685
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

11
00:02:15,127 --> 00:02:17,880
Arbor Day was fine,
and Easter was pleasant...

12
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:21,118
...and every Saint Fizzin's day,
they ate a Fizz pheasant.

13
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:25,081
But every Who knew,
from their twelve toes to theirsnout...

14
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:29,365
...they loved Christmas the most,
without a single Who doubt.

15
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:35,803
-Farfingle's welcomes you!
-Thank you.

16
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:39,284
Merry Christmas!
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's!

17
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:42,282
We got a snoozlephone

18
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:47,077
...and a snoozlephone for your brother Stu,
a muncle for your uncle...

19
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,876
...a fant for your aunt
and a fandpa for your cousin Leon.

20
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,117
So, we just need.... Cindy?

21
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,640
Sale on Aisle 3!

22
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:56,524
-Cindy Lou!
-Merry Christmas.

23
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:59,121
Hello, Myrna. Merry Christmas, Fred.
Excuse me.

24
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:00,686
Cindy Lou? Honey?

25
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:02,842
-Dad?
-Yeah?

26
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:04,838
Doesn't this seem like a bit much?

27
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:07,239
This is what Christmas is all about!

28
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:09,006
Can't you feel it?

29
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,202
Merry Christmas!

30
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,517
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's.
Wait a second!

31
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:13,796
Your change!

32
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:15,799
Another minute closer to Christmas!

33
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:21,596
And, for the next five minutes only,
99 percent off!

34
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:38,717
Yes, every Who down in Whoville
liked Christmas a lot...

35
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:42,636
...but the Grinch,
who livedjust north of Whoville...

36
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:44,846
...did not.

37
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:50,160
Get on it, girls.
All the good mistletoe's at the top.

38
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:53,518
-Hey, Drew, I'll race you!
-Notif I race you first.

39
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:56,799
Last one to the top is a stinky old Grinch!

40
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:02,283
You guys, where are we?
l think we should go back.

41
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,722
What? You're scared of the Grinch!

42
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:06,442
No!

43
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:09,202
They say he lives up here in a big cave.

44
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:11,921
And only comes down
when he's hungry for the taste of...

45
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,078
-...Who flesh!
-Drew!

46
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,516
You're scared of the Grinch!
You're scared of the Grinch!

47
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:21,645
-Are too!
-Am not!

48
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,246
Wait for me!

49
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:39,160
Go on, touch it. Touch the door.

50
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:40,885
Do it for me, Stu.

51
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,605
Well done, Max!

52
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,159
Serves them right, those Yuletide-loving...

53
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:20,444
...sickly-sweet,
nog-sucking cheer mongers!

54
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:23,923
l really don't like them.

55
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:26,840
No, l don't.

56
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:30,476
Max!

57
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:34,443
Get my cloak!

58
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:38,444
l've been much too tolerant
of these Whovenile delinquents...

59
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:41,445
...and their innocent, victimless pranks.

60
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:45,085
So, they want to get to know me, do they?

61
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:48,843
They want to spend a little quality time
with the Grinch.

62
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:52,557
l guess l could use a little...

63
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,319
...social interaction.

64
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:04,842
Merry Christmas!

65
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:06,485
Yeah, you bet.

66
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,285
Ho, ho, ho, and stuff.

67
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:12,316
Oh, my.

68
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:15,087
Someone has vandalized that vehicle.

69
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:17,920
You see, Max?
The city is a dangerous place.

70
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:20,766
The Grinch hated Christmas.
The whole Christmas season.

71
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:21,962
Top of the day. Flatfoot.

72
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:25,403
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.

73
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:26,806
Here's a present for you.

74
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,004
Be sure to run real fast with it.
Come on. Double time. Move.

75
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:32,920
It could be that his head
wasn'tscrewed on just right.

76
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:36,283
Orit could be, perhaps,
that his shoes were too tight.

77
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,927
But I think that
the mostlikely reason of all...

78
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:42,841
...may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small.

79
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,524
Stranger, won't let you go
till you buy a chapeau!

80
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,003
Boy, nothing beats Christmas, right?

81
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,876
l guess.

82
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,120
You guess?

83
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:09,202
lt's just, l look around at you and Mom
and everyone getting all kerbobbled.

84
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:11,960
Doesn't this seem superfluous?

85
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:13,042
Dad!

86
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:15,279
Dad!

87
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:20,400
-What happened to you?
-lt was the Grinch!

88
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:28,037
-Grinch?
-What do you want? l mean....

89
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:29,685
''Grinch? Oh, no!''

90
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,756
Did someone just say, ''Grinch''?

91
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:36,405
Hello, Mayor May-Who, sir.

92
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:40,516
Lou.

93
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:46,882
l don't need to remind you
that this Christmas...

94
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,004
...marks the one thousandth Whobilation.

95
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:52,203
Whoville's most important celebration!

96
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:55,956
And The Book of Who says, very clearly:

97
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:59,522
''Every size of Who we can measure...

98
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:03,401
''...knows that Whobilation
is a time we must treasure.''

99
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:06,325
Now, Lou, please tell me that your boys...

100
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:08,638
...were not up on Mount Crumpit...

101
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:12,402
...provoking the one creature
within a billion bilometers of here...

102
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:13,721
...who hates Christmas!

103
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,605
But it was the Grinch!

104
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:19,598
No, sir, the boys didn't see any Grinch.

105
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:21,758
lt was, and he came after--

106
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:23,883
l think they were up on the mountain...

107
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:27,084
...playing with matches,
or defacing public property, or....

108
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:29,760
That's a relief.

109
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,878
All right, you heard the man:

110
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,879
There is no Grinch problem here.

111
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:45,843
-l need it there by tomorrow.
-Heck of a rush.

112
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:48,395
Merry Christmas, Mo. Heck of a rush.

113
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:52,276
But, Dad...

114
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,125
...l just don't understand something.

115
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,882
Why won't anyone talk about the Grinch?

116
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:59,438
You kids and the Grinch!

117
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:04,000
You see, Cindy,
the Grinch is a Who, who always....

118
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:07,239
Actually, not a Who. He's more of a....

119
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,844
-A what?
-Exactly, honey.

120
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:13,840
And he's a What
who doesn't like Christmas.

121
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,598
Take a look at his mailbox, sweetie.

122
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:19,360
Not a single Christmas card, in or out.

123
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,961
Ever!

124
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:22,116
But why?

125
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:23,646
Lou, where's my mail?

126
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:25,963
Lou! Got the wrong mail here.

127
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,238
Lou! l got the wrong mail!

128
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:32,919
-l'll be right there.
-Lou, we got a problem!

129
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:35,555
All right, we'll straighten this out.

130
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:41,361
lt'll take them years to sort this out.

131
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:45,600
This is his and now it's yours,
and this hers and now it's his!

132
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:48,880
And for the rest of you:

133
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,724
Jury duty! Jury duty! Jury duty!

134
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,521
Blackmail. Pink slip.
Chain letter. Eviction notice.

135
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,718
Jury duty!

136
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:06,040
Would you mind helping me
take this to the back room, honey?

137
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:09,401
-Be careful of the sorting machine, right?
-Yeah.

138
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:46,081
Gesundheit.

139
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:55,881
You're the....

140
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:57,766
The....

141
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,042
The Grinch!

142
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,360
That worked out nicely.

143
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:06,201
Help!

144
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:16,079
Help me! Somebody!

145
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:17,726
Max, let's go.

146
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,244
Our work here is finished.

147
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:21,562
Help me!

148
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,200
Please help!

149
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,437
That is not a chew toy!

150
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:27,962
Stop it, Max!

151
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:31,159
Get that out of your mouth!
You have no idea where it's been!

152
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:36,922
Help!

153
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:43,122
Bleeding hearts of the world, unite!

154
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:52,881
There! Give me that!

155
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:56,164
Don't you know you shouldn't
take things that don't belong to you?

156
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:58,124
What's your problem?
Are you a wild animal?

157
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:02,041
Let's go.

158
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:04,398
Thanks for saving me.

159
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:11,999
Saving you?

160
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,923
ls that what you think l was doing?

161
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,286
Wrong-o.

162
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:25,515
l merely noticed that you were
improperly packaged, my dear.

163
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,361
Hold still!

164
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:31,279
Max, pick out a bow.

165
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:33,919
Can l use your finger for a second?

166
00:12:34,847 --> 00:12:36,280
Hello! Hello!

167
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,365
-Cindy?
-Dad!

168
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:45,241
Daddy!

169
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:46,961
Daddy!

170
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:48,881
What the hey...?

171
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,082
Honey.

172
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,201
Cindy?

173
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:54,886
Dad! lt was amazing!

174
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,125
You've been practicing
your Christmas wrapping!

175
00:12:58,367 --> 00:12:59,766
l am so proud of you.

176
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:03,966
Now, that's holiday.

177
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,443
Sweetlittle Cindy didn't know what to do.

178
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:10,365
In her head, bum-tumbled a conflict or two.

179
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:13,958
''If the Grinch was so bad,
then why did he save me?

180
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:15,560
''Maybe he wasn'tso bad.''

181
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,358
Maybe. Just maybe.

182
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:25,726
No lights on in the house.
Your mom must be shopping.

183
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,923
Good, l'm so glad you're home.

184
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,885
l can feel it, Lou. This is the year.

185
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:36,323
When everybody asks who has the most
spectacular lights in greater Whoville...

186
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:40,238
...they're gonna cry out,
''Mrs. Betty Lou Who!''

187
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:43,077
lsn't this the chandelier
from the dining room?

188
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,285
lt's all for the cause, dear.

189
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:48,764
And Cindy?
Could you be Mommy's little helper...

190
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:51,315
...and unscrew the bulb there
from the refrigerator?

191
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,837
-'Cause somehow l missed that one.
-Go on!

192
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:03,395
Every year Martha May Whovier
has the best lights.

193
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:05,886
Not this year.

194
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,486
This year...

195
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:11,037
...l'm gonna beat
that prim, perfect little prissy--

196
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:12,276
Betty!

197
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:16,040
-Hi!
-Martha!

198
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:20,156
My, l've never seen so many
beautiful Christmas lights, Betty Lou!

199
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:23,763
l'd blow every fuse
if l tried to keep up with you, Martha May!

200
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,483
lsn't this antique darling?

201
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:30,437
lt's handcrafted and almost 100 years old.

202
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:32,919
Jeez. l'm really impressed!

203
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,958
This, however, is new.

204
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:50,003
Betty! Sweetie!

205
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,919
Good night, Betty.

206
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,761
-l got it!
-Honey, l've got it.

207
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:14,882
Hello?

208
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,880
ls my sub-zero chillibrator running?

209
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:22,245
-l suppose.
-You better go catch it!

210
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,602
That's a good one! That is rich.

211
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:37,886
Let's go home.

212
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:44,766
Fleas before beauty. Thank you.

213
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,963
Come on, hurry up, Slowpoke.

214
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:07,525
There's got to be a better way!

215
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:31,041
A car would have paid for itself by now!

216
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,923
Goody. Another load coming down.

217
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,285
What's that stench?

218
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,446
lt's fantastic!

219
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:47,445
Max! Grab a bag.

220
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:50,244
We'll come back for the rest.

221
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:53,245
Of course, when l say ''we,'' l mean ''you.''

222
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:57,045
lt's amazing
what these Whos just throw away.

223
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:58,196
Oh, well.

224
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:03,123
One man's toxic sludge
is another man's potpourri.

225
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:05,718
l don't know. lt's some kind of soap.

226
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:21,196
''Where are you, Christmas?

227
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:25,037
''Why can't l find you?

228
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:30,357
''Why have you gone away?

229
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:36,955
''My world is changing

230
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:40,722
''l'm rearranging

231
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:43,526
''Does that mean Christmas

232
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:47,478
''changes too?

233
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:59,602
''Where are you, Christmas?

234
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:02,840
''Do you remember

235
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:08,726
''The girl you used to know?

236
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,802
''You and l were so carefree

237
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,160
''Now nothing's easy

238
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,765
''Did Christmas change

239
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:27,162
''Or just

240
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:32,205
''me?''

241
00:18:58,447 --> 00:18:59,562
Sweet!

242
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:11,437
''Be it ever so

243
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:12,836
''Heinous

244
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:16,761
''There's no place like home''

245
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:23,722
First floor, factory rejects.

246
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,277
Those Whos are hard to frazzle, Max!

247
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,518
But we did our worst.
And that's all that matters.

248
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:34,202
At least l scared the bejeebles
out of that little girl at the post office.

249
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,642
She'll be scarred for life, if we're lucky.

250
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,558
Funny she didn't rat on us, though.

251
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,763
Must be afraid of reprisals.

252
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:09,476
Yes!

253
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:11,923
Down a size and a half!

254
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:15,881
And this time, l'll keep it off.

255
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:20,517
Get the stick, Max. Get the stick!

256
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,039
There's no stick!

257
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:27,526
l'm smarter.

258
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:35,646
Any calls?

259
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,085
You have no messages.

260
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:42,884
Odd. Better check the outgoing.

261
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,483
Ifyou utterso much as one syllable...

262
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:50,282
...I'll huntyou down and gutyou like a fish!

263
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:53,276
Ifyou'd like to fax me, press the star key.

264
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:56,961
Oh, well.

265
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:03,919
That's more like it.

266
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:24,966
Excellent year.

267
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,559
l'll tell you, Max...

268
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:30,002
...l don't know why l ever leave this place.

269
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:33,803
l've got all the company l need right here.

270
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:36,720
Hello!

271
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:38,240
Hello!

272
00:21:39,127 --> 00:21:40,355
How are you?

273
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:41,675
How are you?

274
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:43,600
l asked you first.

275
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:44,915
I asked you first.

276
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:49,200
That's really mature,
saying exactly what l say!

277
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:52,798
Mature...exactly...what I say....

278
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:55,316
l'm an idiot!

279
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,678
You're an idiot!

280
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:01,916
All right, fine.

281
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:05,363
l'm not talking to you anymore.
ln fact, l'm going to whisper.

282
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:09,645
So that by the time my voice reverberates
off the walls and gets back to me...

283
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:12,566
...l won't be able to hear it!

284
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:15,877
You're an idiot!

285
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:29,482
Am l just eating because l'm bored?

286
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:40,646
Who could that be?

287
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:45,485
Hello, little girl.
Are you here to read to us?

288
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:46,676
No.

289
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:50,039
l hear you know some things
about the Grinch.

290
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:53,756
Cindy Lou had some questions
in her curious heart.

291
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:57,756
Why did the Grinch hate Christmas?
Where did it all start?

292
00:22:58,047 --> 00:23:00,686
With her dad's blabbacorder
she wouldn't give an inch.

293
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:05,164
ln your own words, please tell me
everything you know about the Grinch.

294
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:07,040
Where did he come from?

295
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:11,277
He came the way all Who babies come.

296
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:14,563
On calm nights...

297
00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:18,475
...baby Who girls
and tiny Who fellas...

298
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:23,477
...drift from the sky
in their own pumbersellas.

299
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:33,844
Hey, honey, our baby is here!

300
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:37,758
He looks just like your boss.

301
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:41,724
So that's how it works.

302
00:23:42,927 --> 00:23:47,125
lt was Christmas Eve,
and a strange wind blew that night.

303
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:15,481
We were having
our annual holiday get-together.

304
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:41,883
It was morning before anybody realized
that he was out there!

305
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,002
The poor dear!

306
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:44,966
But, you know what?

307
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:47,038
We knew right away that he was special.

308
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,797
Do you want a Christmas cookie?

309
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:57,606
Yes, which Christmas cookie
would you like?

310
00:24:57,727 --> 00:24:58,716
Santa.

311
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,526
His first words!

312
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:03,802
Yes, that is a Santa plate.

313
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:06,441
Do you want to hold this Santa plate?

314
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,246
Santa, bye-bye!

315
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:21,878
He was a wonderful...

316
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:23,886
...whatever he was.

317
00:25:24,327 --> 00:25:27,603
And we raised him
like any other Who child:

318
00:25:27,887 --> 00:25:29,639
With a deep love of Christmas.

319
00:25:33,087 --> 00:25:36,079
Don't forget, tomorrow
is our big Christmas gift exchange.

320
00:25:36,527 --> 00:25:40,361
Everyone bring a special gift
for a special someone.

321
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:42,396
The...

322
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:44,000
...Grinch....

323
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:47,680
He had no sense of color coordination.

324
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:51,997
Although l hardly remember him.
l didn't have time to socialize.

325
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:54,637
I was far too busy with my...

326
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,356
...studies.

327
00:25:56,527 --> 00:25:59,439
Now, class, is everyone almost finished?

328
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:03,364
And if the truth be told, he....

329
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,722
He liked Martha.

330
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,398
Martha was my girlfriend.

331
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:15,120
l don't like discussing this Grinch
so very close to Christmas, but...

332
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:17,966
...maybe if you hear the truth,
you'll understand why--

333
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:19,799
Put your back into it!

334
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:23,286
l tried to take him under my wing.

335
00:26:23,927 --> 00:26:27,761
You don't have a chance with her.
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!

336
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:33,681
He had hair. Not pleasant.

337
00:26:35,607 --> 00:26:36,801
He shed.

338
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:38,116
Not right.

339
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:43,758
You know, Christmas
is my favorite time of year.

340
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:45,999
l just love the colors.

341
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:47,801
The red...

342
00:26:48,127 --> 00:26:49,799
...and the green.

343
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:55,277
Did I have a crush on the Grinch?

344
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:57,476
Of course not.

345
00:26:57,927 --> 00:26:59,280
l didn't ask you that.

346
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:02,836
Right.

347
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:06,436
Forsome reason,
when he came home that day...

348
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:09,564
...he really gotinto the Christmas spirit
for the first time.

349
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:11,556
Perfect!

350
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:15,996
Whoopsie!

351
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:24,637
What a lovely family heirloom!

352
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,039
The fires of love!

353
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:42,882
This will be perfect on the top of her tree.

354
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:45,760
Oh, Martha! Oh, Christmas!

355
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:55,078
I wantyou all to look your best tomorrow.

356
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,838
You don't have a chance with her.

357
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,600
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!

358
00:28:15,687 --> 00:28:17,325
Has everyone given their gifts?

359
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:20,125
-l haven't.
-What?

360
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,044
Merry Christmas, Martha May.

361
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:32,642
Why do you have a bag on your head?

362
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:37,042
Probably because
he's embarrassed by that hideodorous gift.

363
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,041
Mr. Grinch...

364
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:42,642
...please take the bag off.

365
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:45,116
Yes, you.

366
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:46,322
Take it off.

367
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,885
Put the book down.

368
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:58,686
And your foot.

369
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,125
Look at that hack job!

370
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:16,078
Stupid present!

371
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:18,166
Stupid tree!

372
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:21,280
l hate Christmas!

373
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:23,597
-The anger.
-The fury!

374
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:25,686
The muscles!

375
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:41,284
lt was a horrible day
when they were so cruel to him.

376
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:42,962
And...

377
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:46,119
...l could hardly bear it.

378
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:04,486
l hate Christmas! l hate it!

379
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:08,280
And that was the last time
we eversaw him.

380
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:13,076
The very last time.

381
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:05,837
So, whatever the reason,
his heart or his shoes...

382
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:08,243
...he stood outside his cave...

383
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:10,603
...hating the Whos.

384
00:31:11,207 --> 00:31:12,879
Alphabetically.

385
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:17,202
Aardvarkian Abakenezer Who...

386
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:18,522
...l...

387
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:22,118
...hate you!

388
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:28,604
Aaron B. Benson Who, l hate you.

389
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:31,083
Hate, hate, hate.
Hate, hate, hate.

390
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,566
Double hate.

391
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:36,477
Loathe entirely!

392
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:44,765
Nutcrackers?

393
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:48,280
lt's their Whobilation.

394
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,835
He snarled with a sneer.

395
00:31:51,687 --> 00:31:55,236
Tomorrow is Christmas!
lt's practically here.

396
00:31:56,607 --> 00:31:57,881
Max!

397
00:31:58,047 --> 00:32:00,800
Fetch me my sedative.

398
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:04,880
Now to take care of those pesky memories.

399
00:32:07,287 --> 00:32:10,120
''Whobilation, plentiful
with candy canes and pies

400

to eat some google fries

402
00:32:15,047 --> 00:32:16,162
-Dad?
-Yeah.

403
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:20,160
l've been thinking about the Whobilation
and l may do something drastic.

404
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:22,283
That's fine, dear. Ask your mother.

405
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,801
-Where did she go?
-Honey!

406
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:26,445
Honey! Hi!

407
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:31,196
Look, l just found the cutest light
for my Christmas display.

408
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:34,637
Hurry up, we're gonna be late. Come on.

409
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,963
And now, the nominations...

410
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:57,686
...for that Who among us
who best typifies...

411
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,157
...the qualities of Whodom and Whodery...

412
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:05,320
...the Whoville holiday cheermeister!

413
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:16,080
Do l hear a nomination?

414
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,441
l nominate the Grinch!

415
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:22,200
-The Grinch?
-The Grinch?

416
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:26,164
My, my, my.

417
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:29,478
What an altruistic daughter
you have there, Lou!

418
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:32,040
Thank you.

419
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:34,681
Cindy?

420
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:39,596
Let me quote a verse...

421
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:42,078
...from The Book of Who.

422
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,802
Thank you.

423
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:49,041
''The term 'Grinchy' shall apply
when Christmas spirit is in short supply.''

424
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,358
Now, l ask you: Does that sound
like our holiday cheermeister?

425
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:57,005
True, Mr. May-Who.
But The Book of Who says this too:

426
00:33:57,087 --> 00:33:59,521
''No matter how different
a Who may appear...

427
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:02,405
''...he will always be welcomed
with holiday cheer.''

428
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:08,446
Yes, the book also says, the....

429
00:34:08,527 --> 00:34:09,846
''The award...

430
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:12,646
''...cannot go to the Grinch, because...

431
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:16,402
''...sometimes things
get the lead-pipe cinch.''

432
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:18,837
You made that up! lt doesn't say that.

433
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,039
No, it does.

434
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:23,276
What page?

435
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:29,359
Lost my place, but it's....

436
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:30,962
lt's in here!

437
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:32,924
But the book does say:

438
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:36,602
''The cheermeister is the one
who deserves a back slap or a toast.

439
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:40,044
''And it goes to the soul at Christmas
who needs it most.''

440
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:42,641
And l believe that soul is the Grinch.

441
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:47,885
And if you're the Whos l hope you are,
you will too.

442
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,480
She's right!

443
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:56,596
Fine.

444
00:34:56,927 --> 00:35:00,237
You people want to waste
a perfectly good nomination...

445
00:35:00,327 --> 00:35:01,999
...why, it's up to you.

446
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:04,681
But l am telling you...

447
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:07,998
...the Grinch will never come down.

448
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:10,885
And when he doesn't,
the Mayor will wear the crown.

449
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:12,998
Well, more or less.

But this girl had a mission.
She knew what to do.

468

She'd invite the Grinch herself,
that brave Cindy Lou.

00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:56,360
Mr. Grinch?

Mr. Grinch!

474
00:37:32,007 --> 00:37:33,326
Excuse me.

475
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,005
Hello...

476
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:51,886
...little girl.

477
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,835
How dare you enter...

478
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:57,476
...the Grinch's lair?

479
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,400
The impudence! The audacity!

480
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:03,242
The unmitigated gall!

481
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:05,318
You called down the thunder...

482
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:08,717
...now, get ready for the boom!

483
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:13,315
Gaze into the face of fear!

484
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:17,040
Mr. Grinch...

485
00:38:17,887 --> 00:38:19,764

You see?

487
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:25,079
Even now the terror
is welling up inside you.

l'm not scared.

489
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:31,926
Denial is to be expected
in the face of pure evil.

490
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:35,520
l don't think so.

00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:37,722
Doubt?

492
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:41,516
Another unmistakable sign
of the heebie-jeebies!

493
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:45,523
Now you're doomed!

494
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:54,724
Run for your life...

495
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:58,083
...before l kill again!

496
00:39:00,487 --> 00:39:01,966
l'm a psycho!

497
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:07,156
Danger! Danger!

498
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:18,003
Maybe you need a time-out.

499
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:24,635
Kids today.

500
00:39:24,727 --> 00:39:27,525
So desensitized by movies and television.

501
00:39:28,287 --> 00:39:29,561
What do you want?

502
00:39:30,807 --> 00:39:33,685
Mr. Grinch, l came to invite you...

503
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:36,762
...to be holiday cheermeister.

504
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,085
-''Holiday Whobie-what-y''?
-Cheermeister.

505
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:45,322
''Cheermeister. Celebrate with friends.''

506
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:50,920
That's a good one.

507
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:55,521
l know you hate Christmas,
but what if it's all just a misunderstanding?

508
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:59,202
-Don't care.
-l myself am having some Yuletide doubts.

509
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:03,203
But maybe if you reunite
with the Whos and be a part of Christmas--

510
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:06,165
''Maybe if you reunite with the Whos
and be a part of Christmas.''

511
00:40:06,247 --> 00:40:07,236
Grow up!

512
00:40:07,327 --> 00:40:09,283
Then maybe it'll be all right for me, too!

513
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:10,800
l'm sorry, your session is over.

514
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:13,924
Please make another appointment
with the receptionist on the way out.

515
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:16,316
Please, please.
You have to accept the award.

516
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:23,279
Award?

517
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:28,559
You never mentioned an award!

518
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:31,043
Yeah, with a trophy and everything.

519
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:33,084
-And l won?
-You won!

520
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:36,641
-That means there were losers.
-l guess.

521
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:40,845
-So, if you come--
-A town full of losers!

522
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:42,766
l like it.

523
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,035
Was anyone emotionally shattered?

524
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:50,044
Come on, a minute ago
l couldn't shut you up! Details, details!

525
00:40:51,247 --> 00:40:52,441
The Mayor wasn't happy.

526
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:55,875
Oh, no.

527
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,159
Martha May will be there.

528
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:01,280
She will?

529
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:04,045
And she'll see me.

530
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:05,642
A winner.

531
00:41:07,127 --> 00:41:10,722
She'll be on me like fleegle flies
on a flat-faced floogle horse.

532
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:15,198
l'm sorry to disappoint you, Martha, baby,
but the G train has left the station.

533
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,438
So, will you come?

534
00:41:18,047 --> 00:41:19,400
All right.

535
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:22,880
l don't know if it's
that adorable twinkle in your eye...

536
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:24,480
...or that nonconformist streak...

537
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,043
...that reminds me of a younger,
less hairy me.

538
00:41:28,367 --> 00:41:30,198
But you've convinced me.

539
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:35,157
Who knows? This Whobilation
could change my entire outlook on life!

540
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:37,439
-Really?
-No.

541
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,878
There you are, honey.

542
00:42:12,207 --> 00:42:14,323
You can make snow angels later.

543
00:42:14,847 --> 00:42:16,758
We can't be late for the Whobilation!

544
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:21,526
The nerve of those Whos.

545
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:24,917
lnviting me down there
on such short notice.

546
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:28,443
Even if l wanted to go,
my schedule wouldn't allow it.

547
00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:33,480
''4:00, wallow in self-pity.

548
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:36,365
''4:30, stare into the abyss.

549
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:39,157
''5:00, solve world hunger...

550
00:42:39,247 --> 00:42:41,203
''...tell no one.

551
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:43,118
''5:30, jazzercise.

552
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:46,119
''6:30, dinner with me.''
l can't cancel that again.

553
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:49,684
''7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing.''

554
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:51,201
l'm booked.

555
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:54,444
lf l bumped the loathing to 9:00,
l 'd have time to lay in bed...

556
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:58,122
...stare at the ceiling
and slip slowly into madness.

557
00:42:58,727 --> 00:43:00,558
But what would l wear?

558
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:22,242
lt's not a dress, it's a kilt!

559
00:43:23,647 --> 00:43:25,797
Sicko!

560
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:27,796
Stupid.

561
00:43:27,927 --> 00:43:28,916
Ugly.

562
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:30,406
Out of date.

563
00:43:31,927 --> 00:43:33,406
This is ridiculous.

564
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:36,843
lf l can't find something nice to wear,
l'm not going!

565
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:56,084
That's it, l'm not going.

566
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:12,005
It's time for our Holiday Cheermeister
of the YearAward!

567
00:44:18,207 --> 00:44:21,358
Congratulations, Mr. Grinch!

568
00:44:23,847 --> 00:44:25,280
He isn't here.

569
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:27,002
What?

570
00:44:27,847 --> 00:44:29,519
He didn'tshow?

571
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,958
Who could have predicted this?

572
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:38,080
All right. l'll swing by for a minute,
allow them to envy me...

573
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:41,204
...grab a handful of popcorn shrimp,
and blow out of there.

574
00:44:41,687 --> 00:44:45,157
But what if it's a cruel prank?
What if it's a cash bar?

575
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:47,439
How dare they?

576
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:49,441
All right, l'll go.

577
00:44:49,527 --> 00:44:50,960
But l'll be fashionably late.

578
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:53,277
No. Yes. No. Yes. No!

579
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:54,396
Yes!

580
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:57,446
Definitely not!

581
00:44:57,887 --> 00:45:00,162
All right. l've made my decision!

582
00:45:00,687 --> 00:45:02,962
l'm going, and that's that.

583
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:05,800
Had my fingers crossed.

584
00:45:09,727 --> 00:45:12,241
Maybe l should flip a coin!

585
00:45:19,567 --> 00:45:22,525
I guess the award goes to...

586
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:24,001
...the runner-up.

587
00:45:25,687 --> 00:45:29,600
That's right. A man for whom
Christmas comes not once a year...

588
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:32,084
...but every minute of every day.

589
00:45:32,527 --> 00:45:34,882
A handsome, noble man.

590
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,637
A man who
has had his tonsils removed twice!

591
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:40,486
That's an interesting story.

592
00:45:40,887 --> 00:45:42,718
You see, what happened was--

593
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,241
Hello, Martha.

594
00:45:58,447 --> 00:45:59,436
He made it!

595
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:00,836
-Cindy.
-Honey!

596
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:24,876
Look--

597
00:46:27,407 --> 00:46:29,159
Hot crowd. Hot crowd.

598
00:46:31,087 --> 00:46:33,078
l believe l'm here to...

599
00:46:34,687 --> 00:46:37,724
...accept an award of some kind.

600
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:43,596
And the child mentioned a check.

601
00:46:44,047 --> 00:46:46,515
-No, l didn't.
-All right, then, give me the award.

602
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:48,518
Come on, while l'm young!

603
00:46:48,647 --> 00:46:52,879
Don'tyou worry, Mr. Holiday Cheermeister,
you'll getyour award.

604
00:46:52,967 --> 00:46:56,846
But first, a little family reunion.

605
00:46:57,847 --> 00:47:00,884
They nursed you. They clothed you.

606
00:47:00,967 --> 00:47:02,446
Here they are...

607
00:47:02,527 --> 00:47:05,246
...your old biddies!

608
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:09,195
Are you two still living?

609
00:47:09,847 --> 00:47:11,166
We missed you!

610
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:14,357
Rose. The sweater. The sweater, Rose.

611
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,281
Sweater? What are you talkin' about?
No, l can't!

612
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,925
l can't do that!

613
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:23,125
Don't touch me there!

614
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,763
Put him in the Chair of Cheer!

615
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:34,200
Chair of Cheer?

616
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:36,005
What's the Chair of Cheer?

617
00:47:36,207 --> 00:47:38,243
You didn't tell me about the Chair of Cheer.

618
00:47:38,327 --> 00:47:40,636
Please, Mr. Grinch.

619
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:43,280
No. l can't do it, honestly.

620
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:45,119
l'm not ready. lt's too much, too soon!

621
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:47,164
It's that time ofyear.

622
00:47:47,247 --> 00:47:49,477
The Cheermeister's ride
in the Chair of Cheer!

623
00:47:50,407 --> 00:47:52,443
Put me down! l mean it!

624
00:47:52,527 --> 00:47:53,846
l've got a lawyer.

625
00:47:53,927 --> 00:47:55,838
There'll be hell to pay!

626
00:47:57,167 --> 00:48:00,125
First, you'll put
your taste buds to the test...

627
00:48:00,207 --> 00:48:04,439
...as you judge the Who pudding cook-off!

628
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,884
-Mine first.
-l really don't know--

629
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,639
No, mine's the best!

630
00:48:09,007 --> 00:48:10,599
You'll enjoy this!

631
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:13,518
This is not pudding.

632
00:48:14,367 --> 00:48:15,595
What is it?

633
00:48:17,447 --> 00:48:19,722
This is mine. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

634
00:48:19,807 --> 00:48:21,798
Christmas conga!

635
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:24,765
Look at the time.
l really should be getting back.

636
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:26,678
All right!

637
00:48:31,247 --> 00:48:32,839
Fruitcake, tra-la-la!

638
00:48:33,927 --> 00:48:35,042
No.

639
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,078
Fudge Judge.

640
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:45,846
Made it myself.

641
00:48:46,207 --> 00:48:47,720
Yeah? Mine are homemade too.

642
00:48:48,287 --> 00:48:49,436
Okay.

643
00:48:50,087 --> 00:48:51,839
Put it in. Bring it on!

644
00:48:52,487 --> 00:48:54,284
ls that all you got?

645
00:48:54,367 --> 00:48:56,198
ls that all you got? Come on.

646
00:49:01,967 --> 00:49:03,366
Out of the way, slow-mo!

647
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:06,002
Excuse me.

648
00:49:18,727 --> 00:49:21,002
He's number one in the sack race run!

649
00:49:21,087 --> 00:49:24,159
Number one! l'm number one!

650
00:49:24,287 --> 00:49:26,278
l'm number one!

651
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:29,839
No child can beat the Grinch!

652
00:49:34,727 --> 00:49:36,445
l beat you.

653
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,721
He won!

654
00:49:47,407 --> 00:49:50,604
And now it's time
for the moment we've all been waiting for.

655
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:53,155
Yes! My award.

656
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:55,204
-Write the check.
-There's no check.

657
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:58,643
Are you sure? Because I thought
I heard someone mention a check.

658
00:49:58,727 --> 00:50:01,366
I said, there's no check.
And now it's time...

659
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:03,677
...for Present Pass-it-on!

660
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:07,079
As always, we start with our Cheermeister.

661
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:17,795
The gift of a Christmas shave.

662
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:33,404
Look at that hackjob!

663
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:45,721
Yes, yes, yes. Good times!

664
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,202
Good times.

665
00:50:49,487 --> 00:50:53,196
And now, l have a little something
for the love of my life.

666
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:55,800
Martha May...

667
00:50:58,047 --> 00:51:00,959
...please become Mrs. Augustus May-Who.

668
00:51:08,807 --> 00:51:10,240
Augustus....

669
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:12,845
lf you agree to be my wife...

670
00:51:13,047 --> 00:51:17,165
...along with a lifetime supply of happiness,
you'll also receive this:

671
00:51:19,887 --> 00:51:22,242
It's a new car!

672
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:26,523
Generously provided
by the taxpayers of Whoville!

673
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:30,080
What do you say, Martha?

674
00:51:30,807 --> 00:51:33,685
You got 20 seconds on the clock.

675
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:37,836
I....

676
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:43,556
These gifts are quite dazzling.

677
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:55,756
Of course they are.

678
00:51:56,687 --> 00:51:58,518
That's what it's all about, isn't it?

679
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:02,037
That's what it's always been about!

680
00:52:03,247 --> 00:52:04,236
Gifts!

681
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:05,842
Gifts.

682
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:08,316
Gifts, gifts, gifts.

683
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,282
You want to know what happens
to your gifts?

684
00:52:11,447 --> 00:52:14,120
They all come to me. ln your garbage.

685
00:52:14,527 --> 00:52:15,846
You see what l'm saying?

686
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,884
ln your garbage!

687
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:23,523
l could hang myself with all the bad
Christmas neckties l found at the dump!

688
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,120
And the avarice.

689
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:30,719
The avarice never ends!

690
00:52:30,807 --> 00:52:32,638
''l want golf clubs.'' ''l want diamonds.''

691
00:52:32,727 --> 00:52:36,515
''l want a pony, so l can ride it twice,
get bored, and sell it to make glue.''

692
00:52:37,207 --> 00:52:42,076
Look, l don't want to make waves,
but this whole Christmas season is...

693
00:52:42,247 --> 00:52:44,522
...stupid, stupid, stupid!

694
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:47,605
There is, however...

695
00:52:48,407 --> 00:52:51,080
...one teeny-tiny...

696
00:52:51,607 --> 00:52:53,165
...Christmas tradition...

697
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:55,120
...l find...

698
00:52:55,767 --> 00:52:58,406
...quite meaningful.

699
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:04,846
Mistletoe.

700
00:53:05,247 --> 00:53:07,920
Now, pucker up and kiss it, Whoville!

701
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:18,806
Somebody's fabulous!

702
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:23,806
All right, your turn! Go on!

703
00:53:31,727 --> 00:53:32,876
-Let's go!
-No!

704
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:34,880
Excuse me, old-timer.

705
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:37,519
Mind if l wet my whistle?

706
00:53:42,207 --> 00:53:43,799
That's my good stuff!

707
00:53:51,447 --> 00:53:53,961
Burn, baby! Burn!

708
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:09,082
The Whomanity!

709
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:10,841
-Let's go! Come on!
-No, wait!

710
00:54:11,087 --> 00:54:13,476
-Do something.
-Right!

711
00:54:20,887 --> 00:54:22,639
Calling all units. Calling all units.

712
00:54:26,607 --> 00:54:27,926
Taxi!

713
00:54:30,087 --> 00:54:32,476
lt's because l'm green, isn't it?

714
00:54:37,047 --> 00:54:38,526
Halt!

715
00:54:39,927 --> 00:54:42,760
Evening, folks. Mind if l ride along?

716
00:54:43,007 --> 00:54:45,157
You might want to scooch over.

717
00:54:47,127 --> 00:54:48,640
You did the right thing.

718
00:54:56,687 --> 00:54:58,245
Out of the way!

719
00:55:07,647 --> 00:55:09,956
That's gonna hurt in the morning.

720
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:35,004
lt's gonna blow!

721
00:55:51,887 --> 00:55:53,320
You fellas all right?

722
00:55:53,407 --> 00:55:55,125
How about a nice hat?

723
00:55:55,567 --> 00:55:56,682
Lou?

724
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:06,681
l'm hurt, Lou.

725
00:56:07,967 --> 00:56:10,197
l'm hurt, and l don't hurt easily.

726
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:12,926
But you and your family....

727
00:56:13,887 --> 00:56:15,400
l'm so...

728
00:56:15,487 --> 00:56:17,000
...disappointed.

729
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:20,997
Can we just get back to Christmas...

730
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:23,642
...the way it should be?

731
00:56:24,487 --> 00:56:25,966
Grinch-less?

732
00:56:26,487 --> 00:56:28,682
Merry Christmas!

733
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:31,917
Merry Christmas!

734
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:39,646
l just wanted everybody
to be together for Christmas.

735
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:44,319
l quite enjoyed that.

736
00:56:44,407 --> 00:56:46,284
l hope l get another invite soon.

737
00:56:51,487 --> 00:56:52,806
Come on, come on!

738
00:56:52,887 --> 00:56:54,957
Good thing we have a spare.

739
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,880
Suffering snorkelblatz!

740
00:57:00,287 --> 00:57:02,357
They're relentless!

741
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:11,242
Only four hours till Christmas!

742
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:16,642
Yes, the Grinch knew tomorrow
all the Who girls and boys...

743
00:57:16,927 --> 00:57:19,999
...would wake bright and early
and rush for their toys.

744
00:57:20,087 --> 00:57:22,885
And then, the noise!

745
00:57:23,087 --> 00:57:26,762
The noise, noise, noise!

746
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:29,397
They'll bang on tong-tinglers.

747
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,557
They'll blow their floo-flounders.

748
00:57:31,727 --> 00:57:35,322
They'll crash on jang-jinglers
and bounce on boing-bounders!

749
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:39,682
Then Whos young and old
would sit down to a feast.

750
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:42,281
And they'll feast and they'll feast.

751
00:57:42,607 --> 00:57:45,883
And they'll feast, feast, feast, feast!

752
00:57:46,127 --> 00:57:47,958
They'll eat their Who pudding.

753
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:51,757
And rare Who roast beast!

754
00:57:52,087 --> 00:57:56,239
But there's something
l just cannot stand in the least.

755
00:57:56,567 --> 00:57:57,716
Oh, no.

756
00:57:58,047 --> 00:58:01,483
l'm speaking in rhyme!

757
00:58:06,527 --> 00:58:09,519
Blast you Whos!

758
00:58:13,767 --> 00:58:17,885
And the more the Grinch thought
of what Christmas would bring...

759
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:20,357
...the more the Grinch thought:

760
00:58:20,447 --> 00:58:23,245
l must stop this whole thing.

761
00:58:24,727 --> 00:58:28,561
Why, for year after year
l've put up with it now!

762
00:58:28,727 --> 00:58:32,003
l must stop this Christmas from coming!
But how?

763
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:35,397
l mean, in what way?

764
00:58:38,487 --> 00:58:42,446
''Christmas is goin' to the dogs

765
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:47,316
''We're scoffing down
the turkey and the grog

766
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:52,356
''Things are looking very good, it's true''

767
00:58:53,807 --> 00:58:57,038
Are you having a holly, jolly...

768
00:58:57,847 --> 00:58:59,565
...Christmas?

769
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:02,366
Wrong-o!

770
00:59:19,647 --> 00:59:21,524
lf you're not going to help me...

771
00:59:21,847 --> 00:59:23,963
...then you might as well....

772
00:59:24,807 --> 00:59:26,126
Then he got an idea.

773
00:59:26,927 --> 00:59:28,997
An awful idea.

774
00:59:29,807 --> 00:59:31,957
The Grinch got a wonderful...

775
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:34,278
...awful idea.

776
00:59:34,567 --> 00:59:38,765
l know just what to do.

777
00:59:46,927 --> 00:59:49,395
The Grinch laughed in his throat.

778
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,521
And he made a quick
Santy Claus hat and a coat.

779
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:58,207
And he chuckled and clucked...

780
00:59:58,527 --> 01:00:00,722
...at this great Grinchy trick.

781
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:04,595
With this coat and this hat,
l'll look just like Saint Nick.

782
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:09,239
''You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch

783
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:14,516
''You really are a heel

784
01:00:15,047 --> 01:00:19,006
''You're as cuddly as a cactus
and as charming as an eel

785
01:00:19,087 --> 01:00:21,521
''Mr. Grinch

786
01:00:22,207 --> 01:00:23,959
''You're a bad banana

787
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:27,677
''With a greasy black peel

788
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:36,045
''Just face the music, you're a monster

789
01:00:36,687 --> 01:00:38,837
''Mr. Grinch, yes, you are

790
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:43,200
''Your heart's an empty hole

791
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:47,196
''Your brain is full ofspiders
You got garlic in yoursoul

792
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:49,596
''Mr. Grinch

793
01:00:50,687 --> 01:00:52,882
''I wouldn't touch you with a

794
01:00:53,927 --> 01:00:57,317
''thirty-nine-and-a-half footpole''

795
01:01:08,527 --> 01:01:11,564
l asked for three-quarters, not five-eighths.

796
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:13,166
Stay focused!

797
01:01:19,207 --> 01:01:22,404
''You know, ifyou asked
the who's who of Whoville

798
01:01:23,807 --> 01:01:27,197
''No one would deny it''

799
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:48,602
Air bag is a little slow.

800
01:01:50,927 --> 01:01:53,361
But that's what these tests are for!

801
01:01:54,247 --> 01:01:56,044
''You're a vile one

802
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,960
''Mr. Grinch

803
01:01:59,047 --> 01:02:02,801
''You have termites in yoursmile

804
01:02:03,407 --> 01:02:07,685
''You have all the tendersweetness
Of a seasick crocodile

805
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:09,917
''Mr. Grinch

806
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,322
''Given the choice between you

807
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:16,638
''l'd take the seasick crocodile''

808
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:42,037
Fat boy should be finishing up
anytime now.

809
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,764
Talk about a recluse.

810
01:02:44,847 --> 01:02:49,045
He only comes out once a year,
and he never catches any flak for it!

811
01:02:50,327 --> 01:02:52,966
Probably lives up there to avoid the taxes.

812
01:02:54,927 --> 01:02:57,395
Merry Christmas!

813
01:02:59,127 --> 01:03:00,355
Oopsie.

814
01:03:01,607 --> 01:03:03,643
Forgot about the reindeer.

815
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,007
Did thatstop the old Grinch?

816
01:03:07,647 --> 01:03:09,239
No.

817
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,318
The Grinch simply said:

818
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:14,155
lf l can't find a reindeer...

819
01:03:14,927 --> 01:03:18,044
...l'll make one instead.

820
01:03:22,247 --> 01:03:25,796
Oh, Max!

821
01:03:28,927 --> 01:03:30,838
So he called his dog Max...

822
01:03:31,527 --> 01:03:33,358
...and he took some red thread...

823
01:03:33,527 --> 01:03:36,837
...and tied a big horn on top of his head.

824
01:03:40,327 --> 01:03:41,316
All right.

825
01:03:41,807 --> 01:03:44,560
You're a reindeer. Here's your motivation.

826
01:03:44,847 --> 01:03:47,680
You're Rudolph, a freak with a red nose,
nobody likes you.

827
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:50,600
Then one day,
Santa picks you and you save Christmas.

828
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:55,236
No, forget that part. We'll improvise.

829
01:03:55,327 --> 01:03:57,716
Just keep it kind of loosey-goosey.

830
01:03:57,847 --> 01:03:59,883
You hate Christmas! You're gonna steal it!

831
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:03,677
Saving Christmas was a lousy ending.
Way too commercial.

832
01:04:05,127 --> 01:04:06,526
Action!

833
01:04:09,087 --> 01:04:10,202
Brilliant!

834
01:04:10,607 --> 01:04:12,518
You reject your own nose...

835
01:04:12,607 --> 01:04:15,167
...because it represents the
glitter of commercialism!

836
01:04:15,247 --> 01:04:16,965
Why didn't l think of that?

837
01:04:17,047 --> 01:04:19,163
Cut, print, check the gate. Moving on.

838
01:04:28,727 --> 01:04:30,001
That...

839
01:04:30,127 --> 01:04:31,480
...feels...

840
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,603
...good.

841
01:04:44,487 --> 01:04:47,160
Here goes nothin', hot dog!

842
01:04:52,767 --> 01:04:53,836
Wow!

843
01:05:07,367 --> 01:05:09,676
This is nuts!

844
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:13,598
On, Crasher! On, Thrasher!

845
01:05:13,887 --> 01:05:15,957
On, Vomit and Blitzkrieg!

846
01:05:24,407 --> 01:05:25,806
We're gonna die!

847
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:27,599
We're gonna die!

848
01:05:27,927 --> 01:05:31,237
l'm going to throw up,
and then l'm gonna die!

849
01:05:33,527 --> 01:05:36,485
Mommy, tell it to stop!

850
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,326
Almost lost my cool there.

851
01:06:02,327 --> 01:06:06,366
All their windows were dark.
Quietsnow filled the air.

852
01:06:06,567 --> 01:06:10,640
All the Whos were all dreaming
sweet dreams without care...

853
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:13,327
...when he came to the first
little house on the square.

854
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:15,398
Welcome to Whoville, Max.

855
01:06:22,967 --> 01:06:24,002
Betty?

856
01:06:24,287 --> 01:06:25,481
-Betty?
-What?

857
01:06:25,567 --> 01:06:27,478
Did you hear something?

858
01:06:29,327 --> 01:06:30,601
lt's Santa!

859
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:32,598
Go right back to sleep.

860
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:40,958
Come on, Max. lt's our first stop.

861
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:43,317
The old Grinchy Claus hissed.

862
01:06:43,407 --> 01:06:46,126
And he climbed to the roof,
empty bags in his fist.

863
01:06:46,207 --> 01:06:49,438
He'd slide down the chimney.
A rather tightpinch.

864
01:06:49,687 --> 01:06:52,679
Butif Santa could do it,
then so could the Grinch.

865
01:06:53,087 --> 01:06:56,523
He's planning a double-twisting
interrupted forward-flying 2-and-a-half...

866
01:06:56,607 --> 01:06:58,199
...with a combo tuck and pike.

867
01:06:58,287 --> 01:06:59,845
High degree of difficulty.

868
01:07:07,567 --> 01:07:10,798
He gotstuck only once,
for a moment or two.

869
01:07:10,887 --> 01:07:14,436
Blasted water weight!
Goes right to my hips.

870
01:07:23,967 --> 01:07:26,720
Then he stuck his head
out of the fireplace flue.

871
01:07:28,047 --> 01:07:30,242
A little more stealth, please.

872
01:07:30,607 --> 01:07:32,962
Where the little Who stockings
all hung in a row.

873
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:34,116
These stockings...

874
01:07:34,207 --> 01:07:35,117
...he grinned...

875
01:07:35,207 --> 01:07:36,959
...are the first thing to go.

876
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,722
Okay, fellas. Show time.

877
01:08:10,207 --> 01:08:12,277
Then he slunk to the icebox.

878
01:08:13,527 --> 01:08:14,562
Slunk?

879
01:08:16,687 --> 01:08:20,441
He eyed the Whos' feast.
He took the Who pudding.

880
01:08:21,567 --> 01:08:23,603
He took the roast beast.

881
01:08:24,127 --> 01:08:25,162
Hike!

882
01:08:26,447 --> 01:08:28,677
He cleaned out thaticebox
as quick as a flash.

883
01:08:28,767 --> 01:08:32,521
Why, that Grinch,
he even took theirlast can of Who hash.

884
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:36,957
Then he stuffed all the food
up the chimney with glee.

885
01:08:37,567 --> 01:08:39,159
And now...

886
01:08:39,247 --> 01:08:41,078
...grinned the Grinch...

887
01:08:42,927 --> 01:08:44,645
...l'll stuff up the tree.

888
01:08:44,727 --> 01:08:47,639
And the Grinch grabbed the tree,
and he started to shove...

889
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:51,836
...when he heard a small sound
like the coo of a dove.

890
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:53,280
Excuse me.

891
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:02,164
The Grinch had been caught
by this tiny Who daughter...

892
01:09:02,367 --> 01:09:04,801
...who'd got out of bed
for a cup of cold water.

893
01:09:04,927 --> 01:09:08,203
Santa Claus?
What are you doing with our tree?

894
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:12,515
But, you know, that old Grinch
was so smart and so slick...

895
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:16,845
...he thought up a lie,
and he thoughtit up quick.

896
01:09:17,367 --> 01:09:18,561
Why...

897
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:21,406
...my sweet little tot.

898
01:09:21,647 --> 01:09:23,205
The fake Santa Claus lied.

899
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:25,797
There's a light on this tree...

900
01:09:26,447 --> 01:09:27,800
...that won't...

901
01:09:27,887 --> 01:09:29,764
...light on one side.

902
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:34,120
So l'm taking it home
to my workshop, my dear.

903
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:41,077
l'll fix it up there...

904
01:09:41,447 --> 01:09:44,962
...and l'll bring it back here.

905
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:48,604
Santa, what's Christmas really about?

906
01:09:48,887 --> 01:09:50,605
Vengeance!

907
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:53,515
l mean...

908
01:09:56,007 --> 01:09:57,440
...presents...

909
01:09:58,487 --> 01:09:59,886
...l suppose.

910
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,485
l was afraid of that.

911
01:10:06,927 --> 01:10:09,964
And his fib fooled the child.

912
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:13,444
Then he patted her head,
and he got her a drink...

913
01:10:13,567 --> 01:10:15,842
...and he sent her to bed.

914
01:10:23,287 --> 01:10:24,276
Santa?

915
01:10:24,927 --> 01:10:28,124
-What?
-Don't forget the Grinch.

916
01:10:28,887 --> 01:10:30,764
l know he's mean and hairy and smelly.

917
01:10:32,647 --> 01:10:35,036
His hands might be cold and clammy.

918
01:10:36,447 --> 01:10:39,803
But l think he's actually kind of sweet.

919
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:41,202
Sweet?

920
01:10:48,607 --> 01:10:50,325
You think he's sweet?

921
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:52,919
Merry Christmas, Santa.

922
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:02,485
And when Cindy Lou
went up with her cup...

923
01:11:02,607 --> 01:11:04,165
Nice kid.

924
01:11:05,047 --> 01:11:07,561
Bad judge of character.

925
01:11:08,607 --> 01:11:11,280
...he went to the chimney
and stuffed the tree up.

926
01:11:19,047 --> 01:11:22,244
And the last thing he took
was the log for their fire.

927
01:11:22,327 --> 01:11:26,320
On their walls he left nothing
butsome hooks and some wire.

928
01:11:26,447 --> 01:11:29,086
And the one speck of food
that he'd leftin the house...

929
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:32,398
...was a crumb that was even
too small for a mouse.

930
01:11:35,367 --> 01:11:39,440
Then he slithered and slunk,
with a smile most unpleasant...

931
01:11:39,607 --> 01:11:43,236
...around each Who home,
and he took every present.

932
01:11:54,007 --> 01:11:55,042
Clearance sale.

933
01:11:55,167 --> 01:11:57,044
Everything must go.

934
01:12:09,567 --> 01:12:11,478
What now?

935
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,556
Martha...

936
01:12:46,767 --> 01:12:50,476
...have you ever kissed a man
who lost his tonsils twice?

937
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:53,399
No, silly!

938
01:12:57,287 --> 01:13:00,757
But it's an experience
that l've always longed for.

939
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,765
Kiss me, you fool!

940
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:24,123
What are you laughing at...

941
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:26,804
...Rudolph?

942
01:14:27,887 --> 01:14:29,843
lt's all you, Maxie!

943
01:14:29,927 --> 01:14:33,203
3,000 feet up,
up the side of Mount Crumpit...

944
01:14:33,287 --> 01:14:36,757
...he rode with his load
to the tiptop to dump it.

945
01:14:46,247 --> 01:14:49,319
We did it!

946
01:14:54,327 --> 01:14:56,238
We did it! We did it!

947
01:14:56,807 --> 01:14:58,763
That wasn't so bad, was it, Max?

948
01:15:02,487 --> 01:15:04,239
They'll be waking up now.

949
01:15:06,327 --> 01:15:09,956
And l know just what they'll do.

950
01:15:10,727 --> 01:15:12,763
All those Whos...

951
01:15:13,167 --> 01:15:14,805
...down in Whoville...

952
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,157
...will all cry.

953
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:37,041
What an embarrassment!
l've been robbed!

954
01:16:05,887 --> 01:16:08,037
Mayor May-Who? Oh, dear.

955
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:18,035
l wonder who could have done this.

956
01:16:19,887 --> 01:16:21,320
Tell you people one thing:

957
01:16:21,927 --> 01:16:23,406
lnvite the Grinch...

958
01:16:24,007 --> 01:16:25,838
...destroy Christmas.

959
01:16:26,127 --> 01:16:27,958
lnvite the Grinch...

960
01:16:28,047 --> 01:16:30,720
...destroy Christmas!

961
01:16:33,767 --> 01:16:36,406
But did anyone listen to me?

962
01:16:36,487 --> 01:16:38,125
-l did.
-No.

963
01:16:38,207 --> 01:16:41,119
You choose to listen...

964
01:16:41,247 --> 01:16:45,684
...to a little not-to-be-taken-seriously girl...

965
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:49,724
...who hasn't even grown into her nose yet.

966
01:16:51,247 --> 01:16:54,205
Cindy, l hope you're very proud...

967
01:16:54,607 --> 01:16:55,835
...of what you've done.

968
01:17:04,527 --> 01:17:06,199
lf she isn't, l am.

969
01:17:08,247 --> 01:17:10,044
l'm glad he took our presents.

970
01:17:11,887 --> 01:17:13,639
-What?
-l....

971
01:17:16,287 --> 01:17:18,323
-l'm glad.
-He's glad.

972
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:22,000
You're glad.
You're glad everything is gone.

973
01:17:23,247 --> 01:17:27,160
You're glad that the Grinch
virtually wrecked....

974
01:17:27,247 --> 01:17:29,602
No, not wrecked, pulverized Christmas.

975
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,359
ls that what l'm hearing?

976
01:17:32,367 --> 01:17:34,483
You can't hurt Christmas, Mr. Mayor...

977
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:38,401
...because it isn't about the gifts
or the contests or the fancy lights.

978
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,604
That's what Cindy's been trying
to tell everyone.

979
01:17:42,127 --> 01:17:44,243
And me. She's been trying to tell me.

980
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:47,603
What is wrong with you? This is a child.

981
01:17:48,447 --> 01:17:50,005
She's my child.

982
01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:52,806
And she happens to be right, by the way.

983
01:18:01,047 --> 01:18:05,086
l don't need anything more for Christmas
than this right here, my family.

984
01:18:08,207 --> 01:18:11,438
-Merry Christmas, everybody!
-Merry Christmas!

985
01:18:12,847 --> 01:18:16,681
Merry Christmas, you hunk of burnin' Who!

986
01:18:23,807 --> 01:18:25,365
Give me a break.

987
01:18:32,887 --> 01:18:33,956
Merry Christmas!

988
01:18:46,047 --> 01:18:47,196
Mr. Grinch?

989
01:18:48,567 --> 01:18:50,444
Mr. Grinch?

990
01:18:50,527 --> 01:18:53,246
Now for the final note in my symphony...

991
01:18:53,327 --> 01:18:56,205
...of downright nasty not-niceness!

992
01:18:56,527 --> 01:18:59,644
The crescendo of my odious opus!

993
01:19:05,487 --> 01:19:07,921
The wailing and the gnashing of teeth.

994
01:19:08,407 --> 01:19:12,685
The bellowing of the bitterly bummed out!

995
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:16,244
lt'll be like music to my ears!

996
01:19:24,247 --> 01:19:28,286
Then the Grinch heard
a sound rising over the snow.

997
01:19:28,407 --> 01:19:32,286
Itstarted in low. Then itstarted to grow.

998
01:19:34,567 --> 01:19:36,956
But the sound wasn'tsad.

999
01:19:37,567 --> 01:19:40,240
Why, this sounded merry.

1000
01:19:41,087 --> 01:19:43,396
Butit was merry.

1001
01:19:43,527 --> 01:19:44,642
Very.

1002
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:48,601
Every Who down in Whoville,
the tall and the small...

1003
01:19:48,727 --> 01:19:51,844
...were singing without any presents at all.

1004
01:19:57,607 --> 01:20:00,121
He hadn'tstopped Christmas from coming.

1005
01:20:00,407 --> 01:20:01,396
It came.

1006
01:20:01,487 --> 01:20:04,604
Somehow or other, it came just the same!

1007
01:20:08,327 --> 01:20:09,806
Mr. Grinch?

1008
01:20:12,487 --> 01:20:16,162
And the Grinch,
with his Grinch feetice-cold in the snow...

1009
01:20:16,247 --> 01:20:18,807
...stood puzzling and puzzling.

1010
01:20:19,127 --> 01:20:21,197
How could it be so?

1011
01:20:21,447 --> 01:20:23,165
lt came without ribbons!

1012
01:20:23,567 --> 01:20:25,842
lt came without tags!

1013
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:29,318
lt came without packages, boxes or bags!

1014
01:20:32,247 --> 01:20:34,966
And he puzzled and puzzled...

1015
01:20:35,047 --> 01:20:37,436
...till his puzzler was sore.

1016
01:20:39,727 --> 01:20:43,481
Then the Grinch thought ofsomething...

1017
01:20:43,607 --> 01:20:45,245
...he hadn't before.

1018
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:46,681
Maybe...

1019
01:20:47,887 --> 01:20:49,081
...Christmas...

1020
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:50,998
...he thought...

1021
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:56,682
...doesn't come from a store.

1022
01:21:00,287 --> 01:21:01,845
Maybe Christmas...

1023
01:21:03,127 --> 01:21:04,480
...perhaps...

1024
01:21:10,127 --> 01:21:12,482
...means a little bit more.

1025
01:21:44,487 --> 01:21:46,000
Help me!

1026
01:21:46,767 --> 01:21:47,916
l'm...

1027
01:21:48,887 --> 01:21:50,286
...feeling!

1028
01:21:56,807 --> 01:21:58,877
And what happened then...

1029
01:21:59,167 --> 01:22:01,601
...well, in Whoville they say...

1030
01:22:01,847 --> 01:22:04,407
...that the Grinch's small heart...

1031
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:08,275
...grew three sizes that day.

1032
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:41,484
What's happening to me?

1033
01:23:04,007 --> 01:23:05,281
l'm all...

1034
01:23:06,567 --> 01:23:08,285
...toasty inside.

1035
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:17,476
And l'm leaking.

1036
01:23:20,647 --> 01:23:21,682
Oh, Max.

1037
01:23:25,007 --> 01:23:27,123
l love you!

1038
01:23:34,847 --> 01:23:37,805
All right, that's enough.
Knock it off. Beat it!

1039
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:40,005
Get out of here!

1040
01:23:40,167 --> 01:23:41,964
One step at a time.

1041
01:23:50,007 --> 01:23:52,999
No. The sleigh. The presents.

1042
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:54,486
They'll be destroyed!

1043
01:23:54,567 --> 01:23:55,886
And l care!

1044
01:23:56,127 --> 01:23:58,800
What is the deal?

1045
01:23:59,607 --> 01:24:01,040
Wait!

1046
01:24:02,487 --> 01:24:03,715
This can't happen!

1047
01:24:03,807 --> 01:24:06,844
lt shouldn't! lt couldn't!
lt mustn't! lt wouldn't!

1048
01:24:07,447 --> 01:24:09,836
Not now, not then, not ever again!

1049
01:24:19,647 --> 01:24:21,046
No!

1050
01:25:08,367 --> 01:25:09,356
Oh, well.

1051
01:25:10,127 --> 01:25:12,516
lt's just toys, right?

1052
01:25:13,927 --> 01:25:15,519
Hi, Mr. Grinch!

1053
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:19,239
Cindy Lou!

1054
01:25:19,327 --> 01:25:21,557
What are you doing up there?

1055
01:25:22,247 --> 01:25:26,035
l came to see you.
No one should be alone on Christmas.

1056
01:25:41,807 --> 01:25:42,796
No!

1057
01:26:12,647 --> 01:26:15,525

1058
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:17,116
You did it!

1059
01:26:57,407 --> 01:26:59,602
Spread eagle! Nailed it!

1060
01:27:16,567 --> 01:27:18,125
Are you all right?

1061
01:27:18,407 --> 01:27:19,601
Are you kiddin'?

1062
01:27:19,687 --> 01:27:22,042
The sun is bright and the powder's bitchin'!

1063
01:27:22,207 --> 01:27:24,596
Now scoot over! lt's my turn to drive!

1064
01:27:31,767 --> 01:27:33,405
l'd better slow this buggy down!

1065
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:40,642
-We're gonna crash!
-Now you listen to me, young lady!

1066
01:27:41,207 --> 01:27:43,641
Even if we're horribly mangled...

1067
01:27:44,367 --> 01:27:46,244
...there'll be no sad faces on Christmas.

1068
01:27:56,807 --> 01:27:58,126
What is it?

1069
01:27:58,607 --> 01:27:59,926
Help!

1070
01:28:00,167 --> 01:28:01,759
-Cindy!
-Grinch?

1071
01:28:04,327 --> 01:28:05,726
My baby!

1072
01:28:09,767 --> 01:28:10,756
Grab an end.

1073
01:28:11,087 --> 01:28:13,521
By the way,
these lights match your outfit perfectly.

1074
01:28:16,127 --> 01:28:18,163
This could be more difficult to negotiate.

1075
01:28:18,647 --> 01:28:20,797
Heads up, Whoville!

1076
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:22,765
Hurry! Here he comes!

1077
01:28:23,927 --> 01:28:26,361
Out of the way! l have no insurance!

1078
01:28:29,567 --> 01:28:30,761
Yeah!

1079
01:28:37,447 --> 01:28:38,482
Run for your lives!

1080
01:28:38,567 --> 01:28:40,558
Watch out, l can't stop!

1081
01:28:42,407 --> 01:28:44,682
-Daddy, move!
-Dad, move it!

1082
01:28:55,287 --> 01:28:56,402
Thanks for the help.

1083
01:28:56,687 --> 01:28:58,643
-Hi, Daddy!
-Hi, Cindy, honey!

1084
01:28:58,807 --> 01:29:00,763
Merry Christmas...

1085
01:29:01,287 --> 01:29:02,561
...one and all!

1086
01:29:02,687 --> 01:29:03,676
Cindy!

1087
01:29:05,647 --> 01:29:06,636
Mommy!

1088
01:29:14,567 --> 01:29:15,920
All right.

1089
01:29:16,647 --> 01:29:18,956
What do we have here?

1090
01:29:19,767 --> 01:29:21,962
You got me, Officer!

1091
01:29:23,007 --> 01:29:24,281
l did it!

1092
01:29:24,367 --> 01:29:26,927
l'm the Grinch that stole Christmas.

1093
01:29:28,407 --> 01:29:29,681
And l'm...

1094
01:29:30,247 --> 01:29:31,521
...sorry.

1095
01:29:36,207 --> 01:29:37,845
Aren't you gonna cuff me?

1096
01:29:37,967 --> 01:29:41,357
Put me in a choke hold?
Blind me with pepper spray?

1097
01:29:41,447 --> 01:29:43,324
You heard him, Officer. He admitted it.

1098
01:29:44,247 --> 01:29:47,717
-l'd go with the pepper spray.
-Yes, l heard him, all right.

1099
01:29:48,887 --> 01:29:51,276
He said he was sorry.

1100
01:29:52,327 --> 01:29:55,842
Besides, it looks like everything
is all here and accounted for.

1101
01:29:56,207 --> 01:29:57,959
Help me out here, people.

1102
01:29:58,607 --> 01:29:59,562
Martha?

1103
01:29:59,647 --> 01:30:01,922
Merry Christmas, August May-Who!

1104
01:30:03,447 --> 01:30:06,644
l'm afraid l do have something for you!

1105
01:30:17,207 --> 01:30:18,640
Your ring back.

1106
01:30:19,207 --> 01:30:20,242
Sorry...

1107
01:30:20,607 --> 01:30:22,757
...but my heart belongs to...

1108
01:30:23,407 --> 01:30:24,840
...someone else.

1109
01:30:40,287 --> 01:30:42,164
No hard feelings?

1110
01:30:49,127 --> 01:30:50,480
Cheer up, dude. lt's Christmas.

1111
01:31:04,727 --> 01:31:06,763
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch.

1112
01:31:11,487 --> 01:31:12,681
Your cheek is so....

1113
01:31:13,207 --> 01:31:14,276
l know.

1114
01:31:15,327 --> 01:31:16,316
Hairy?

1115
01:31:17,007 --> 01:31:18,804
-No.
-Greasy?

1116
01:31:19,687 --> 01:31:21,564
Stinky? Do l have a zit?

1117
01:31:22,007 --> 01:31:23,076
No.

1118
01:31:24,647 --> 01:31:26,160
Warm.

1119
01:31:32,567 --> 01:31:37,436
''Fah who foraze, dah who doraze

So he brought back the toys
and the food for the feast.

1135
01:32:40,327 --> 01:32:42,966
And he, he himself, the Grinch...

1136
01:32:43,487 --> 01:32:45,239
...carved the roast beast.

1137

Yeah!

There's nothin' like the holidays.
