1
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,562
Despite all the warnings,
she was smoking in bed, fell asleep.

2
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,316
Bad move.

3
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:49,739
And the fire begins.

4
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:00,252
It's showtime.

5
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:06,683
Don't worry, ma'am! I'm here to save you!

6
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:13,730
Keep those people back!
This is an emergency!

7
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,360
Don't you dare die on me!

8
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,769
Breathe, damn it, breathe!

9
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:25,616
She's going to make it!

10
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:33,787
What the...?

11
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:20,247
Damn!

12
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:54,030
Though it may be hard to believe
a single biology professor...

13
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,581
...making in excess of $17,500 a year
could find time...

14
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,165
...to grade your first biology
research papers, l did.

15
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:06,001
As you can see,
there was a shocking statistical anomaly:

16
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:08,254
Pretty much all of you got A's.

17
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:17,010
congratulate yourselves.
l have a good feeling about this group.

18
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:22,262
And l think the parade of A's
will continue to the end of the semester.

19
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,515
So much for the bell curve.

20
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,268
Bell curves suck!

21
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,188
-Mr. Kane?
-Dr. Kane?

22
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,102
There seems to be a mistake here.

23
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,701
My brother and l each got a c-.

24
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:37,695
c-. Me, too.

25
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:41,872
Allow me to share something
with the entire class.

26
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:47,036
As l was grading papers, l came across
two gems, both entitled ''cells are Bad.''

27
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:52,674
Both with just one paragraph, which
l unfortunately committed to memory.

28
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,718
''cells are Bad.

29
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,845
''My uncle lives in a cell.

30
00:05:57,055 --> 00:06:01,552
''lt's 10 by 12 and he has to read
the same boring magazine every day.

31
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,139
''The end.''

32
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,566
You're talking about our papers,
aren't you, Dr. Kane?

33
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:11,892
Yes, l am.

34
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:15,402
And although my standards
are nowhere near where they used to be...

35
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,069
...l couldn't put an A on those beauties.
l hope you understand.

36
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:23,997
-Sure.
-Yeah, okay.

37
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:28,246
Okay, let's get back to work
at the periodic table, which....

38
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:31,079
A meteor? Where?

39
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:37,172
Route 89A. Yeah, l got it.

40
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:42,929
Rest assured, l will be there. Okay, 'bye.

41
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:50,014
How does it look, Professor?

42
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:53,019
It's tight.

43
00:06:53,777 --> 00:06:56,351
Really, really tight, Nadine.

44
00:06:56,447 --> 00:07:00,278
But not too tight.
You just don't have the points. Sorry.

45
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:03,618
Don't take it too hard.
Geology's tougher than people think.

46
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:06,279
Are you sure? could you check again?

47
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:09,208
l need this credit
to get into nursing school.

48
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:12,574
Nursing school?

49
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,919
Wouldn't you prefer a different profession?

50
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,580
One where lives
were not dependent on you?

51
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:24,094
Actually, what l want to be
is Miss Arizona.

52
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:28,636
But my pageant consultant says
nursing school will impress the judges.

53
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:30,970
They'll think l want to help people--

54
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:32,558
Ready for lunch?

55
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:36,766
Or have you already eaten?

56
00:07:38,195 --> 00:07:41,861
I'm just concluding
a teacher-student conference with Nadine.

57
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,818
Harry, your dedication to your job
is an inspiration to us all.

58
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,323
Regrettably, l have a prior lunch
engagement with Professor Kane.

59
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:56,332
We'll discuss your extra credit later.
cheer up.

60
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:00,085
Let me grab my stuff.

61
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:07,591
Where are you taking me?

62
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:10,849
-A meteor hit last night.
-That's what that was.

63
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:15,268
As Glen canyon's representative
for the U.S. Geological Survey...

64
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:17,313
...l have to check it out.

65
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,353
I'm taking you in case
l have to do something scientific.

66
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:21,440
Then we eat.

67
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:23,937
You're with the USGS?

68
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:26,190
l signed up over the Internet.

69
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:31,828
Or were you on a cheerleader site and
accidentally got linked to the USGS site?

70
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,033
Something like that.

71
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:36,158
Watch it. Take it easy.

72
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:39,205
That's my baby. Take it easy.

73
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,373
come on! Be careful!

74
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:46,718
Who's going to pay for the damage
to my goddamn car?

75
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:50,055
l told you, we don't do that.
It.'s force majeure.

76
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:54,221
Force majeure, my ass!
That car's a classic '73 Buick Riv.

77
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:57,802
Who are you?

78
00:08:58,064 --> 00:09:01,231
Harry Block,
United States Geological Survey.

79
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:05,184
My secretary, Ira Kane.
We're here to investigate the meteor...

80
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,106
...if that is what it is.

81
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:09,979
Of course it is. It almost blew up my car.

82
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:13,079
I'm still fuzzy
on why you were here at night.

83
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:14,955
With Betty Lou here.

84
00:09:15,248 --> 00:09:20,242
l was practicing for my fireman's exam,
which started seven minutes ago.

85
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:23,170
So I'd appreciate it if you'd let me go.

86
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:25,997
So you and the blonde found the meteor?

87
00:09:26,342 --> 00:09:30,339
Yeah, l found it.
It bounced my car 200 feet in the air.

88
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,846
-can l go?
-Bob, get him out of here.

89
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,930
Don't leave town.

90
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:44,022
Well, Sheriff, is this the...

91
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:47,018
...point of penetration?

92
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:51,194
Yeah. It punched through into a cavern
about 80 feet down.

93
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:55,448
Now that's a hole!

94
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:00,993
Damn it!

95
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:03,286
Next time, you carry the case.

96
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:08,004
You're the USGS representative.
That responsibility comes with the badge.

97
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,843
Oh, my God. Look at that.

98
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,347
l believe we've located the target.

99
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:17,431
Two big smiles, fellas.

100
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:19,550
cheese!

101
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:22,052
Okay, hold it up now.

102
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,389
-Got it.
-It's really hot.

103
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,393
I'll hold you up.

104
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:31,401
Show a little more nightstick.

105
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:33,148
Look at these jackasses.

106
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:37,190
Muscle pose. Give me big smiles!
Looking good.

107
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,910
At ease, gentlemen! The feds are here.

108
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:43,406
Feds? What feds?

109
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:45,244
Who let you down here?

110
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:46,995
Let's not get combative.

111
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:51,501
The USGS and local law enforcement
have a long history of cooperation.

112
00:10:51,757 --> 00:10:55,341
We're just here to get
some scientific samples. If that's okay.

113
00:10:56,261 --> 00:11:01,257
Yeah, sure. We got
all the photographic evidence we need.

114
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:04,591
-carry on.
-Thanks. Keep up the good work.

115
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:09,846
Wow.

116
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:24,026
It just hit last night
and it has stuff growing on it.

117
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,619
could be cave moss.

118
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,461
After just a few hours? That's peculiar.

119
00:11:30,795 --> 00:11:33,286
Let's get a sample and get out of here.

120
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:46,093
It's bleeding.

121
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:49,427
It's a rock that bleeds.

122
00:11:51,107 --> 00:11:54,440
Now that's really peculiar.

123
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:56,939
Let's bag it.

124
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:10,787
l don't know if this USGS gig
is all it's cracked up to be.

125
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:15,874
l mean, it pads out my résumé,
but am l growing as a person?

126
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:19,749
Am l growing as a Division 3
women's volleyball coach?

127
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:25,711
You going to do that spectro-thingy test?

128
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,508
Spectrograph.
Yeah, l will do a spectroscopic analysis.

129
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:31,262
Your résumé will shine.

130
00:12:31,896 --> 00:12:34,933
l got to get to the game.
Let me know if you find anything.

131
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:43,523
Ira, are you sure you can handle this
by your lonesome?

132
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:46,816
All right.

133
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:25,357
That's impossible.

134
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:06,855
Ten base pairs.

135
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,814
That can't be.

136
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,749
come on, ladies! Look alive up here!

137
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:29,085
Tina! When Lisa goes for the spike,
you have to cover the line!

138
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:32,379
Lisa! Two hands, okay? Two hands!

139
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:34,963
God gave you two hands for a reason!

140
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:37,091
Big news. The most amazing thing.

141
00:14:37,768 --> 00:14:40,685
The meteor samples are teeming
with one-celled organisms.

142
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,893
Their metabolic rates are off the charts.

143
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:45,982
They're dividing at an incredible rate.
Almost exponential.

144
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:49,018
Their DNA has ten base pairs.

145
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:51,938
Ten base pairs. That's good to know.

146
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:55,240
Harry, the DNA of all earth life
has only four base pairs.

147
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:58,953
come on, ladies! Look alive!

148
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:01,619
Harry...

149
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,459
...these are organisms from another world.

150
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:08,289
They're aliens.

151
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:15,341
Is the Nobel Prize paid in instalments
or a lump sum, like the lottery?

152
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:17,796
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

153
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,470
I'm not. I'm concerned about
the potential tax consequences.

154
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:29,859
-Why in here?
-l just want to be cautious.

155
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:35,608
Our discovery.

156
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:37,943
I'm all tingly.

157
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:43,069
Wow.

158
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:51,004
I'm no biologist, but how many cells
do single-celled organisms have?

159
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:56,463
If we want to be big important scientists,
you have to act the part.

160
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:58,963
Take a look.

161
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:17,186
There are multi-cellular organisms in there.

162
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:19,981
l know.

163
00:16:20,074 --> 00:16:22,566
-They weren't there before.
-They snuck in.

164
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:24,819
No, there was no sneaking in.

165
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:28,621
It's too amazing.

166
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:32,995
It's like they're evolving.

167
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:34,713
They're growing.

168
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:37,296
Growing into more complex organisms.

169
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:40,290
It's evolution.

170
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:43,970
Nobel, here we come.

171
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:49,468
But it's 200 million years worth
in just a few hours.

172
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:53,804
That's fast.

173
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:57,518
You have no idea.

174
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:00,857
Get ready!

175
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,659
On my signal! Go!

176
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:08,030
Recruit, wake up.

177
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,240
Wake up!

178
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:12,575
Go!

179
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,079
-The hose! This thing here!
-Sorry.

180
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:20,126
Move it!

181
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,921
Wayne, go! come on!

182
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:31,884
These things happen, buddy.

183
00:17:33,229 --> 00:17:35,387
There's another test in six months.

184
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:38,898
Six months? l can't wait six months!

185
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:42,319
At least you have the pool gig
at the country club.

186
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:43,982
Great. Thanks a lot.

187
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:46,486
Drive careful.

188
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:51,120
l got it. l do this.

189
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:00,995
Looks like we have visitors.

190
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,924
class, since this is our first field trip,
l want you to obey some simple rules.

191
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:15,598
Dirt.

192
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:17,266
Nice footwear.

193
00:18:17,522 --> 00:18:20,143
Perfect for spelunking.
Now don't touch anything.

194
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,985
Don't move anything.
Don't even breathe unless we say.

195
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,026
Wear your protective gloves at all times.

196
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:26,606
Why do we have to do this?

197
00:18:26,697 --> 00:18:30,530
Field experience.
The meat and potatoes of geology.

198
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:32,859
-Will this be on the final?
-Yes.

199
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:35,445
-Officer, nice to see you.
-What's up, Professor?

200
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,200
We came to pick up the rock.

201
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,283
Pick it up? What?

202
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:44,547
Orders from the USGS.
They want it under controlled conditions.

203
00:18:44,631 --> 00:18:46,173
It's very technical.

204
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,293
Oh, technical stuff. It's technical.

205
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,129
Okay. Go right ahead.

206
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:53,463
-We'll just haul it right out.
-Sure.

207
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,309
Deke and Danny?
Remember what we talked about?

208
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,976
You're in charge of hoisting.
Get the winch to the hole.

209
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:04,180
Fellas? Stop nodding, and stare at me
for a second, okay?

210
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:06,356
Focus.

211
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,486
-You understand what l want you to do?
-Yeah.

212
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:11,986
Go do it.

213
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:26,417
Ira, I'm picking up
a heavy creepy vibe here.

214
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:28,998
Yeah, a lot has changed.

215
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:36,513
class, l know these look like mushrooms,
but refrain from eating them.

216
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,395
It smells disgusting.

217
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:45,477
Nadine, sometimes science stinks.

218
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:48,601
It's the game we play, baby.

219
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:56,274
Rotten egg smell. Hydrogen sulfide, right?

220
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:59,778
With ammonia and methane.
It's converting the atmosphere.

221
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,742
Look at all this rudimentary plant life.
It's amazing.

222
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:09,956
Not to get all girly here, but l feel
something wiggling around my toes.

223
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,545
The ground does seem to be moving.

224
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:30,145
Flatworms.

225
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:31,853
Millions of them!

226
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:33,650
Yuck!

227
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:40,613
Barely 18 hours
and we already have flatworms.

228
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:42,868
-Look.
-There they are!

229
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:44,656
Hi, Dr. Kane!

230
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:49,867
-l almost went down on that one!
-Awesome.

231
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,297
come here, little buddy.

232
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:00,964
l won't hurt you.

233
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:10,263
You didn't hurt it. You killed it.

234
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:12,396
The oxygen must have killed it.

235
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,225
It must need its own atmosphere to live.

236
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:20,812
Grab a specimen jar. We'll scoop
some atmosphere in there with them.

237
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:27,236
It took us two billion years to do
what they did in a couple of days.

238
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:31,708
Those germs are the embodiment
of the American dream.

239
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:35,796
I'm sorry to interrupt, Professor Block.

240
00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:39,546
But l was wondering if I'm correct
in assuming that that field trip...

241
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:42,125
...fulfilled any of my missing
credit assignments?

242
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:44,547
Nadine, you are a very...

243
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,889
...very smart girl. If you would just focus.

244
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:56,350
Professor, the little wiggly worm things
are breaking.

245
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,146
Ira, look.

246
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,197
It's not breaking. It's splitting.

247
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,198
It's mitosis. That's how they reproduce.

248
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,407
No sex?

249
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,374
No time for sex.

250
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,497
Bummer.

251
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,495
-They're splitting again.
-Put it away.

252
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,209
We call no one, we tell no one.
This is our secret.

253
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,846
What about the government?
They usually get involved.

254
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,512
-No government. l know those people.
-You do?

255
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:35,436
This is our discovery.
We must maintain absolute control.

256
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:39,354
We have to do more research and
check our findings. Document everything.

257
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,237
Wayne?

258
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,740
What's this?

259
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,997
That would be an all-cotton towel, sir.
l believe it's a Fieldcrest.

260
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:01,335
It's a damp towel.
What is a damp towel doing on my chaise?

261
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,710
-Let me take care of this for you.
-You should, as pool manager.

262
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:10,502
If anyone knows what to do
about the dampness on my chair, it's you.

263
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,635
''You know what to do with the towels
because you're the pool boy.''

264
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,437
What the hell?

265
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,281
Where did you guys come from?

266
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:55,049
You're dead now.

267
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:27,044
When l checked the samples this morning
l found three different subspecies.

268
00:24:27,671 --> 00:24:31,669
They're evolving so quickly God knows
what we'll find when we get back.

269
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:40,719
-Please tell me there's an air show today.
-Damn.

270
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:46,182
Shit.

271
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:57,570
can l help you?

272
00:24:57,701 --> 00:25:00,785
Harry Block, Ira Kane.
United States Geological Society.

273
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,575
We're doing some important research.
This is our site.

274
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:07,700
Not anymore. You're not on the list.

275
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:10,370
What? We come here all the time.

276
00:25:10,463 --> 00:25:13,796
Well this is not a nightclub.
Why don't you take it somewhere else.

277
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:16,505
l know my constitutional rights.
You can't tell--

278
00:25:16,594 --> 00:25:20,592
Harry! Maybe you can call your superior,
we can have a word with him?

279
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:27,062
l have a Harry Block and an Ira Kane here--

280
00:25:27,396 --> 00:25:28,559
Punk.

281
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:33,816
-Talk nice to the white man.
-I'll whup his ass.

282
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:36,393
White man doesn't like to be yelled at.

283
00:25:36,655 --> 00:25:37,734
Ira Kane?

284
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:39,652
The Ira Kane?

285
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:44,361
I've looked forward to this for a long time.
You bastard!

286
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:47,204
You're history! You're done!

287
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:49,411
Get his gun!

288
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:52,075
Take it easy! Okay, they're going up.

289
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:55,170
You're responsible for the worst month
of my life!

290
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,666
-What the hell was that about?
-l don't know.

291
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:02,591
Drive down to the command tent.
They're expecting you.

292
00:26:03,264 --> 00:26:04,427
Go.

293
00:26:04,682 --> 00:26:07,303
That guy had me in diapers
for over a month!

294
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:09,595
What the hell was that?

295
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:42,548
-General Woodman's expecting you.
-Russell Woodman?

296
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:50,968
What an unexpected surprise.

297
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,180
For me, too.
l didn't know we were on a hugging basis.

298
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,768
Same old Ira Kane. And you are?

299
00:26:56,857 --> 00:27:00,938
Harry Block, this is Gen. Russell Woodman,
head of U.S. Army Research.

300
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,030
You two know each other?

301
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,699
Ira used to work for me, right?

302
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,198
l worked with you, actually.

303
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:13,534
You worked in Army Research
in the Pentagon?

304
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:16,495
All this time l thought you were just
a schoolteacher.

305
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:19,337
No. How did you find out about this?

306
00:27:19,922 --> 00:27:23,255
You leave the Pentagon,
you don't call, you don't write.

307
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,834
We like to keep tabs on our prodigal sons.

308
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,720
You tapped my phone?

309
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,006
No. We're not the KGB.

310
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,674
We've been monitoring your computer.

311
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:35,847
His computer?

312
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:39,938
All those girls in the photos are over 18.

313
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,686
Yes, I'm sure.

314
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,436
l should have figured, Russell.

315
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,110
You should've known better than
to keep something this big from us.

316
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:48,859
And the cDc.

317
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:53,777
Just in time. Ira, this is Allison Reed,
senior researcher in epidemiology at...

318
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:56,365
...the cDc.

319
00:27:56,707 --> 00:27:57,988
Nice underwear.

320
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:00,325
A garter belt? At a day function?

321
00:28:00,794 --> 00:28:02,288
l can do it. Thank you.

322
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:04,206
I'm okay.

323
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:05,579
Dr. Kane.

324
00:28:05,674 --> 00:28:09,292
I'd heard about your recklessness
but you are way out of line on this one.

325
00:28:09,386 --> 00:28:12,719
Didn't you realise how dangerous
the situation could have become?

326
00:28:12,806 --> 00:28:14,134
Nice to meet you, too.

327
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:18,351
No need to play the blame game, Allison.
No harm, no foul.

328
00:28:18,895 --> 00:28:22,893
We're all appreciative about the discovery
made by Dr. Kane and Mr. Black.

329
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,263
Block.

330
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:26,228
Block. I'm sorry.

331
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:28,989
The confirmation that life exists
outside this planet--

332
00:28:29,072 --> 00:28:31,776
Would be the greatest
scientific discovery of our time.

333
00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:34,618
-Yes, actually.
-Yes, it would.

334
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:38,495
You have my word you'll be
kept in the loop from this point on.

335
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:39,909
You son of a bitch.

336
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,835
Kept in the loop? We are the loop.

337
00:28:42,918 --> 00:28:45,326
We won't cut you out
but we need to take control.

338
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:49,086
We're following protocol, Ira.
You remember protocol, don't you?

339
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:52,009
l have some protocol right here for you,
come and get it.

340
00:28:52,094 --> 00:28:57,088
Look! The fact is, this research
must continue under government control.

341
00:28:57,432 --> 00:28:59,092
We've already secured the area.

342
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:03,181
We're constructing an airlock
and a state-of-the-art field research facility.

343
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:06,855
So there's not a whole lot
for the science department...

344
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:09,693
...of Glen canyon community college
to do here.

345
00:29:09,778 --> 00:29:12,269
Did you catch that condescending tone?

346
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:15,068
We are following well-established
federal guidelines--

347
00:29:15,158 --> 00:29:17,945
Please, don't pull this crap.
We deserve to be here.

348
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:20,113
You deserve to be here?

349
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:25,156
You're lucky anybody's ever let you
near a science laboratory again.

350
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:29,331
You're a disgrace,
and a dangerous one at that.

351
00:29:32,966 --> 00:29:35,458
Lieutenant, show these men out.

352
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:38,130
This is horseshit.

353
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:40,800
It's not over.

354
00:29:41,642 --> 00:29:43,635
You're in for a fight, Russell.

355
00:29:44,979 --> 00:29:47,979
Would you stop following me? Thank you.

356
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:51,224
We won't bend over and take this!

357
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:54,488
Fruit basket for Russell Woodman!

358
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:56,695
Happy holidays, General!

359
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,905
cute.

360
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:08,368
Dr. Kane, are you asking me to bar
the federal government from involvement...

361
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:11,160
...in a discovery as significant as this one?

362
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:16,498
No. We're asking you to ensure the local
scientists who made the discovery...

363
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:18,632
...continue to play a significant role.

364
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:20,878
They've kept us out for almost two weeks.

365
00:30:20,972 --> 00:30:24,387
We put our lives on the line to find
these little guys, Your Majesty.

366
00:30:24,934 --> 00:30:27,603
We just want to be there for them
as they grow up.

367
00:30:28,187 --> 00:30:32,683
We were first team at the meteor site and
all the initial testing was done in our lab.

368
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:36,606
The facilities at Glen canyon
community college are a joke.

369
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:40,062
They weren't a joke
when l went there, General.

370
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:46,487
Your Honour, if the court would allow me
to depose Dr. Kane.

371
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:49,033
Depose me?

372
00:30:49,165 --> 00:30:51,621
We think your past
is very relevant, Dr. Kane.

373
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,493
These issues speak directly
to his competence as a scientist.

374
00:30:57,382 --> 00:31:02,340
Dr. Kane, you were a top-level researcher
at USAMRID from '94 to '97...

375
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:03,543
...were you not?

376
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:04,966
That's correct.

377
00:31:05,223 --> 00:31:10,217
You were summarily dismissed
in the summer of 1997. Any idea why?

378
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:14,231
My services were no longer required?

379
00:31:15,232 --> 00:31:19,395
So your firing had nothing to do
with an experimental anthrax vaccine...

380
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:24,113
...you developed and administered to
140,000 U.S. soldiers in May of that year?

381
00:31:26,076 --> 00:31:28,282
l see where you're going with this.

382
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:32,036
It may have been a factor.
You need to ask the Joint chiefs of Staff.

383
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:36,998
I'll do that. For now, can you tell me
what happened...

384
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:39,328
...to the soldiers who were inoculated?

385
00:31:39,422 --> 00:31:43,255
None of them got anthrax,
if that's what you're asking.

386
00:31:44,594 --> 00:31:46,254
What did they get?

387
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:49,680
Well, as with any new vaccine...

388
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:52,435
...there were certain side effects
associated with--

389
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:54,143
could you be more specific?

390
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:58,767
It's very technical.
I'd hate to waste the court's time with it.

391
00:31:59,108 --> 00:32:00,187
Humour me.

392
00:32:01,945 --> 00:32:04,945
Some debilitating stomach cramps.

393
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:07,441
Severe diarrhoea.

394
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:08,981
Memory loss.

395
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:12,823
Yes. Go on. Any more symptoms?

396
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:19,453
Partial facial paralysis,
temporary blindness, drooling...

397
00:32:19,795 --> 00:32:22,795
...bleeding gums, erectile dysfunction...

398
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:25,089
...uncontrollable flatulence.

399
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:27,385
l think that's it.

400
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:29,963
One more question.

401
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:33,425
Do you remember
what the soldiers called this illness?

402
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:42,770
They called it the Kane Madness.

403
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:49,781
Keep your head up.

404
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:53,400
You know she wants to give you some.

405
00:32:54,078 --> 00:32:56,569
Were you even in that courtroom?

406
00:32:56,831 --> 00:33:00,994
Getting barbecued like babyback ribs?
It's all foreplay.

407
00:33:10,678 --> 00:33:11,957
We've been hit.

408
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:14,669
Forget the foreplay. We just got screwed.

409
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:21,854
-Empty.
-This is bad. This is very, very bad.

410
00:33:22,189 --> 00:33:23,648
Damn it!

411
00:33:27,444 --> 00:33:29,852
l don't care who they are.
Stealing is stealing!

412
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:42,241
They took the rock, the samples,
all the little wormy critters.

413
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:47,211
All the data's gone. The JPEG files,
the DNA sequences. They cleaned us out.

414
00:33:47,296 --> 00:33:49,372
-I'm calling the cops.
-The cops?

415
00:33:49,882 --> 00:33:51,376
They are the cops!

416
00:33:53,302 --> 00:33:54,333
Then what?

417
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,942
Let me ask you something.

418
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:12,897
How come you get to be a colonel
and I'm just a private?

419
00:34:12,988 --> 00:34:14,316
l was a colonel.

420
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:17,199
And you obviously served
your country with distinction.

421
00:34:17,283 --> 00:34:18,694
consider yourself lucky.

422
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:22,035
The penalty for impersonating an officer
is five years in prison.

423
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:25,123
Maybe for you, white boy. Me, they hang.

424
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:27,952
colonels first.

425
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:35,174
We been out here for twelve hours.
My toe is starting to hurt.

426
00:34:40,055 --> 00:34:41,514
Stop it.

427
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:48,981
-Just act like you belong.
-Don't worry, l got this.

428
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:52,725
-Pick up that butt, soldier.
-Sorry, sir.

429
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,976
-And tuck that shirt in.
-Yes, sir.

430
00:34:55,738 --> 00:34:56,983
Get the door.

431
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:01,819
Thank you, Private.

432
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,868
Don't get used to this.

433
00:35:32,857 --> 00:35:34,019
Look at that.

434
00:35:39,196 --> 00:35:41,105
Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.

435
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:50,697
Your girlfriend, 11:00.

436
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,205
Darn it.

437
00:35:56,379 --> 00:35:58,206
The woman's a menace.

438
00:35:58,882 --> 00:36:01,717
Testing, one, two.

439
00:36:02,051 --> 00:36:05,551
This is DJ Harry Block here
and I'm an Aquarius.

440
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:07,548
Stop. l can hear you.

441
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:11,805
Don't snap at me, unless you want
an angry Solid Gold dancer on your hands.

442
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:14,891
Lieutenant?

443
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:19,895
Who's that?

444
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:23,899
l don't know.

445
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:28,114
l don't have anything on my schedule.

446
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:33,241
Maybe it's the guys from Sector 12
doing a nocturnal specimen run.

447
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:35,207
You know how those guys are.

448
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,916
This place has changed.

449
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,028
can you believe this?

450
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:07,774
Harry, look at that.

451
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:25,205
Our little babies are growing up.

452
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:35,472
Three weeks,
it's already like a rain forest in here.

453
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:41,229
Looks like the kitchen
from my first apartment.

454
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:50,108
Harry...

455
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:52,406
...check that guy out.

456
00:37:59,331 --> 00:38:00,956
Is it coming or going?

457
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:09,999
That tree just ate it.

458
00:38:10,343 --> 00:38:15,170
Everything here seems to be food for
something else, so let's stay off the menu.

459
00:38:15,347 --> 00:38:16,842
You got that right.

460
00:38:23,105 --> 00:38:25,097
come here, look at these little things.

461
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:32,815
cool.

462
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:34,406
Snag one.

463
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:36,860
Snag one?

464
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:39,074
Yeah. Snag one and put it in the bucket.

465
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,454
I've seen this movie.
The black dude dies first. You snag it.

466
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,039
Don't be scared.
We came for a specimen, now snag one.

467
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:49,044
He won't hurt you,
he's turned the other way. He's eating.

468
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:51,542
come on.

469
00:38:51,882 --> 00:38:54,208
come on, my little red lobster.

470
00:38:54,552 --> 00:38:58,217
come on, my sexy little crustacean.

471
00:39:08,732 --> 00:39:10,392
Look at that backside.

472
00:39:10,734 --> 00:39:15,063
Theatre-in-the-round. That's the kind of
trunk space you want in a late model car.

473
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:17,982
Who does that remind you of?

474
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:20,316
l have no idea what you're talking about.

475
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,735
She's been throwing it at you enough.

476
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:24,824
-Dr. Reed?
-Bull's-eye.

477
00:39:25,415 --> 00:39:28,914
Excuse me. Dr. Reed?
Did you authorise a walk-through?

478
00:39:29,252 --> 00:39:30,995
No. Why?

479
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:34,921
You should probably
take a look at something.

480
00:39:35,258 --> 00:39:36,337
Here.

481
00:39:38,635 --> 00:39:42,847
That's the kind of rump you'd like to roast.
Kind of mother you'd like to butter.

482
00:39:42,932 --> 00:39:46,431
That is a nice image.
And I appreciate your assumption...

483
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:49,520
...that there is
an actual sexual human being...

484
00:39:49,689 --> 00:39:52,605
...underneath
all Dr. Reed's deep-seated neuroses...

485
00:39:53,108 --> 00:39:55,267
-...but I don't think so.
-What?

486
00:39:55,611 --> 00:39:58,397
I think she is a humourless ice queen.

487
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:04,275
That's just a cover, don't you know that?
All she needs is a good humping.

488
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:07,289
Oh, Ira. Ira

489
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:13,951
We have to get a piece of the asteroid.
And cut that out, it disturbs me.

490
00:40:14,504 --> 00:40:16,626
Don't do that behind my back like that.

491
00:40:16,756 --> 00:40:18,547
-I'm not doing it.
-cut it out.

492
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:20,044
I'm just walking.

493
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:29,174
Let's bag that and get the hell out of here.

494
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,761
I'm ready when you are, colonel.
This disco suit is making me chafe.

495
00:40:36,483 --> 00:40:37,859
Shoo, fly.

496
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:41,854
Hold it. Right there.

497
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,195
Dr. Reed. Nice to see you again.
We were just leaving.

498
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:50,443
You realise you're in violation of the
judge's orders. l could have you arrested.

499
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:53,030
Talk about violations. What about our lab?

500
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,583
Anyone have a can of Raid?

501
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:58,251
-What are you talking about?
-You stole our computer files, our samples.

502
00:40:58,338 --> 00:41:00,663
-l didn't steal anything.
-Your buddies did.

503
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:02,750
-They cleaned us out.
-No, we didn't.

504
00:41:02,842 --> 00:41:03,791
Damn right.

505
00:41:03,885 --> 00:41:05,794
You've been trying to grab credit...

506
00:41:05,886 --> 00:41:09,754
...on our discovery from the beginning.
We just want what's rightfully ours.

507
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:13,182
credit has nothing to do with it.
I'm concerned with public safety.

508
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:16,519
-Is any of this true, Flemming?
-Absolutely not.

509
00:41:16,606 --> 00:41:19,974
-Something's in my suit.
-You're not going to believe him!

510
00:41:20,234 --> 00:41:21,693
Something's in my suit.

511
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:25,110
-What?
-There's something in my suit!

512
00:41:25,197 --> 00:41:26,988
That's impossible, it's sealed!

513
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:31,200
The fly! There's a fly in my suit!

514
00:41:32,537 --> 00:41:35,539
Take off your helmet! Turn up the oxygen!

515
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:37,202
It'll kill it!

516
00:41:40,379 --> 00:41:42,870
Do you see it? Look. Do you see it?

517
00:41:43,798 --> 00:41:44,664
No.

518
00:41:45,717 --> 00:41:47,710
-You're all right. Who's the man?
-You are.

519
00:41:47,803 --> 00:41:49,297
-No, you're the man!
-I'm the man.

520
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:51,344
-You're the man!
-Okay.

521
00:41:51,723 --> 00:41:53,051
Oh, God.

522
00:41:57,562 --> 00:41:59,186
It's in me!

523
00:42:04,068 --> 00:42:07,235
For the love of everything holy,
get this thing out of me!

524
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:09,979
You'll be okay! cut him open and get it.

525
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:13,242
cut me open?
There goes your christmas gift, you Judas!

526
00:42:13,494 --> 00:42:15,237
It's moving down his leg!

527
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:17,661
-What do we do?
-Might have to amputate.

528
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:20,584
Don't take my leg!
Don't let them take my leg!

529
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,337
Anything else you can do?
He thinks he's an athlete.

530
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,665
Doctor, look.

531
00:42:27,257 --> 00:42:29,084
It's heading for his testicles.

532
00:42:29,176 --> 00:42:31,667
Take it! Take the leg!

533
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:33,256
Wait!

534
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:36,307
It's going the other way.

535
00:42:36,391 --> 00:42:39,594
Give me some forceps.
l might be able to catch it in his colon.

536
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:41,762
-How will you go in?
-Rectally.

537
00:42:42,772 --> 00:42:44,148
I'll get the lubricant.

538
00:42:44,232 --> 00:42:46,805
-No time.
-There's always time for lubricant!

539
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:48,182
Flip him!

540
00:42:48,695 --> 00:42:50,569
Okay, here we go.

541
00:42:51,114 --> 00:42:53,272
-You have to try to relax.
-It'll be okay.

542
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:56,035
I'll shove this gurney up your ass,
see if you relax!

543
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,399
cheek spreader.

544
00:42:57,787 --> 00:42:59,031
I'm going in.

545
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:05,792
-Don't clench.
-You're so brave.

546
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:07,871
-A little more.
-No more!

547
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:09,292
A little deeper.

548
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:11,540
No deeper!

549
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:13,211
Squeeze my hand.

550
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:15,259
-Almost there.
-Open up.

551
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:18,046
-Breathe.
-I'm breathing.

552
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:20,714
-Almost there.
-You're there!

553
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:23,389
Got it!

554
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,387
It's over.

555
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,643
It just died.

556
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:33,320
Don't you ever do that again!

557
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:40,076
Those forceps were like this.
You took it like a man.

558
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:43,946
You did great. can we get you anything?

559
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:47,250
Ice cream. I'd like an ice cream, please.

560
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:48,663
What flavour?

561
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:51,755
It doesn't matter. It's for my ass.

562
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:06,181
Man!

563
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:09,012
Now I'm a Hawaiian warrior?

564
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:14,183
I'm thinking seriously about moving.
Maybe to California. Start over.

565
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,695
Because of the fireman thing?
Big deal. You flunked out.

566
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:20,782
You know how many times
I've flunked in my life?

567
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,030
A ton.

568
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,740
Pool boy, you watering down the mai tais?

569
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:28,953
No, sir.
But let me fix you something special.

570
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:34,208
Because you're nothing
but a big, fat monkey turd.

571
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:35,710
Excuse me?

572
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:39,174
Drink's almost ready.

573
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:44,378
Here you go. That should tide you over.

574
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:02,320
''Don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks

575
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,610
''For makin' whoopee''

576
00:45:16,754 --> 00:45:17,917
Damn it!

577
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,417
That's going to stain.

578
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:40,938
Barry!

579
00:45:41,945 --> 00:45:44,863
Barry, where are you? l can't see you?

580
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:46,609
Where are you?

581
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,358
I'm down here, my pet, by the water.

582
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,479
Something just ate Barry cartwright!

583
00:46:23,486 --> 00:46:25,145
That's too bad.

584
00:46:30,826 --> 00:46:34,658
l don't get it. How does someone
with your background...

585
00:46:34,914 --> 00:46:38,662
...credentials, and talent end up...

586
00:46:40,169 --> 00:46:41,497
...like you?

587
00:46:43,004 --> 00:46:44,083
Thank you.

588
00:46:44,172 --> 00:46:47,008
Your partner could have died.
What were you thinking?

589
00:46:47,718 --> 00:46:49,092
l was desperate.

590
00:46:49,177 --> 00:46:52,012
I've been exiled out here in Arizona
for five years...

591
00:46:52,097 --> 00:46:54,006
...watching the world pass me by...

592
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:58,476
...and this amazing discovery
falls into my lap. It's my ticket out of here.

593
00:47:02,064 --> 00:47:04,900
l don't suppose you would understand that.

594
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:10,729
No, how could l? I'm just a humourless
ice maiden in need of a good humping.

595
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:15,112
You heard that?

596
00:47:15,452 --> 00:47:17,113
Loud and clear.

597
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,405
Don't think you know so much about me.

598
00:47:20,874 --> 00:47:21,989
You don't.

599
00:47:22,835 --> 00:47:24,246
I'm sure l don't.

600
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:29,499
Thank you for not calling the cops.

601
00:47:40,268 --> 00:47:43,104
-Be careful!
-Stop being such a baby.

602
00:47:46,941 --> 00:47:48,768
We've seen that car before.

603
00:47:50,737 --> 00:47:52,729
No more bran for me.

604
00:47:55,825 --> 00:47:56,739
Hey, girls.

605
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,828
cut it out.

606
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:08,704
It's the meteor guy.

607
00:48:08,963 --> 00:48:11,288
What's in the bag, your blow-up doll?

608
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:14,632
No. I've got something
you're really going to like.

609
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:17,627
-What happened to you?
-Shut up.

610
00:48:20,182 --> 00:48:21,676
You guys teach here?

611
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:25,557
l was thinking about taking some classes...

612
00:48:26,063 --> 00:48:29,811
...but l decided to hit the job market
early and get a jump start on things.

613
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:33,778
can we help you?

614
00:48:34,738 --> 00:48:37,738
A guy got killed
at my country club last night.

615
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:40,358
A real douchebag, but...

616
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,866
...that just doesn't make it right.

617
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,164
It was an animal attack.

618
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,873
Isn't that something?

619
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:57,509
Happened by the water hazard on the 4th
green. The lady he was banging saw it.

620
00:48:58,052 --> 00:49:01,717
We chased this sucker on the fairway,
then it died in a sand trap.

621
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,263
It just died? How?

622
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,766
Like it was choking to death.

623
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,270
You know? Stopped breathing.

624
00:49:12,233 --> 00:49:16,444
It's like nothing l ever saw before.
l thought you guys might want to see it.

625
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,834
Jill, you've got some kind
of infestation here.

626
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,507
You have a serious bug problem.

627
00:49:46,682 --> 00:49:49,849
Jill? There's something in your closet.

628
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:55,683
Open the door, Grace.

629
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:58,017
Me? It's your house.

630
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:20,874
When did you guys get a dog?

631
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,004
We don't have a damn dog.

632
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:31,387
l don't think that's a dog.
It's like some kind of rodent.

633
00:50:31,726 --> 00:50:33,719
Or a muskrat or a pig.

634
00:50:35,396 --> 00:50:37,056
How did it get in here?

635
00:50:37,315 --> 00:50:39,640
It doesn't look too healthy, does it?

636
00:50:40,234 --> 00:50:41,894
Well, it's frightened.

637
00:50:42,903 --> 00:50:46,901
He can barely breathe, he's so scared.

638
00:50:48,075 --> 00:50:50,400
come on, cutie pie.

639
00:50:51,412 --> 00:50:52,905
Don't be afraid.

640
00:50:53,246 --> 00:50:55,820
come on. That's a good boy--

641
00:51:05,592 --> 00:51:06,671
911?

642
00:51:22,942 --> 00:51:24,851
What the hell is that thing?

643
00:51:32,076 --> 00:51:33,404
Thanks.

644
00:51:34,912 --> 00:51:37,403
Pick me up in an hour. No, two.

645
00:51:37,748 --> 00:51:40,583
Well, an hour and a half would be good.

646
00:51:54,765 --> 00:51:57,255
Hi. Do you have any messages for me?

647
00:52:01,063 --> 00:52:04,348
Two single beds, please. We're fighting.

648
00:52:04,441 --> 00:52:08,604
come on. I'm tired. I've had two hours
of sleep. l need a shower.

649
00:52:08,945 --> 00:52:10,605
They're spreading.

650
00:52:10,863 --> 00:52:15,525
You mean the golf course? Woodman sent
a team out there two hours ago.

651
00:52:15,785 --> 00:52:19,783
Too bad you missed the 5-foot
amphibian that's lying dead in my lab.

652
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:22,613
They're adapting.
We have got to shut it down.

653
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:25,283
You're overreacting. We can handle this.

654
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:28,835
l used to be arrogant like you.

655
00:52:29,632 --> 00:52:31,874
We're both aware of what that led to.

656
00:52:32,301 --> 00:52:34,127
Take me seriously, Allison.

657
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:37,679
l do take you seriously.

658
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:41,974
Then talk to Woodman,
because he won't listen to me.

659
00:52:42,811 --> 00:52:45,646
We have to kill these things
while we still can.

660
00:52:48,149 --> 00:52:51,482
All right. I'll talk to him,
but l can't promise anything.

661
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:53,148
Thank you.

662
00:52:54,155 --> 00:52:56,481
Just one more thing.

663
00:52:58,326 --> 00:53:00,734
could you ever be attracted to me?

664
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:05,321
-'Bye, Ira.
-Just food for thought.

665
00:53:12,673 --> 00:53:14,333
She's mine.

666
00:53:18,053 --> 00:53:20,758
I've been an adjunct professor
for almost four years.

667
00:53:20,848 --> 00:53:25,842
I'm hoping this whole alien brouhaha will
net me an honorary doctorate somewhere.

668
00:53:27,021 --> 00:53:29,059
You going to finish that bacon?

669
00:53:29,689 --> 00:53:32,691
Yeah, l am. l ordered it, didn't l?

670
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,025
So, about the coaching. Girls volleyball?

671
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:40,857
Do you ever get to see them take showers?

672
00:53:41,033 --> 00:53:44,533
Yeah, all the time.
Sometimes l shower with them.

673
00:53:45,705 --> 00:53:47,365
You're kidding, right?

674
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,950
-So?
-She's going to talk to Woodman.

675
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,039
Thank goodness.

676
00:53:53,046 --> 00:53:54,290
I'm okay.

677
00:53:56,048 --> 00:53:58,041
So, level with me, fellows.

678
00:53:58,384 --> 00:54:01,053
Is there some sort of alien...

679
00:54:01,387 --> 00:54:03,545
...attack happening here?

680
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,885
We don't know.

681
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:11,225
could l borrow your cream?

682
00:54:12,898 --> 00:54:14,060
Hi, Denise.

683
00:54:14,399 --> 00:54:17,899
Hello, Ira. Still setting the world on fire?

684
00:54:18,486 --> 00:54:21,060
That's Ira's ex over there
sitting with the cop.

685
00:54:21,323 --> 00:54:25,320
Why the police escort?
You're not under arrest, are you?

686
00:54:25,577 --> 00:54:28,993
Funny. This is Sam.
He's about to make detective.

687
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:33,908
l know Sam. Maybe you can look into
what happened to my missing shirts.

688
00:54:34,002 --> 00:54:36,837
Did l tell you? She left
with two or three of my shirts.

689
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:38,167
See what l mean?

690
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:43,965
I'm not up on the law,
but is it against the law to...

691
00:54:44,053 --> 00:54:46,591
...walk out of someone's house
with what they own?

692
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:49,302
You want your shirt? Seriously, take it.

693
00:54:49,601 --> 00:54:52,767
You must be cold, right? Is that it?

694
00:54:53,104 --> 00:54:55,512
Why should l wear a shirt that's yours?

695
00:54:55,773 --> 00:54:56,935
calm down.

696
00:54:57,024 --> 00:55:00,358
It's amazing how many women
just open their shirt to him.

697
00:55:00,444 --> 00:55:03,647
He'll let you borrow the shirt
for just today. Right, Professor?

698
00:55:04,114 --> 00:55:07,733
10-99, we have a code 12-72
over in Valley Vista....

699
00:55:08,785 --> 00:55:11,193
12-72? That's an animal attack.

700
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:13,031
10-99 responding.

701
00:55:13,123 --> 00:55:15,199
-Got to go, babe.
-Now?

702
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:16,620
They're calling.

703
00:55:19,463 --> 00:55:21,040
Be careful out there.

704
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,040
You'll take care of the check, right?

705
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:34,466
l want those shirts back, Denise.

706
00:55:36,312 --> 00:55:41,306
You have to admit, this animal attack
has kind of an ominous feel, doesn't it?

707
00:55:42,485 --> 00:55:44,478
-check it out?
-check it out.

708
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:46,148
All right!

709
00:55:59,501 --> 00:56:05,087
Looks like we're under the microscope,
so let's be subtle. No cowboy stuff, okay?

710
00:56:05,173 --> 00:56:07,000
-No problem.
-Professionals.

711
00:56:07,175 --> 00:56:08,670
Officer Johnson.

712
00:56:09,428 --> 00:56:11,218
What are you doing here?

713
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:12,846
We heard about the attack.

714
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:17,177
Part of our job
is to ascertain if there's any health risk.

715
00:56:17,518 --> 00:56:20,473
No. Not this time. Forget about it.

716
00:56:20,563 --> 00:56:23,599
-You didn't touch it, right?
-That would be a serious no-no.

717
00:56:23,691 --> 00:56:27,191
-You did? He touched it.
-He shouldn't have touched it.

718
00:56:27,445 --> 00:56:29,153
-What do we do?
-l don't know.

719
00:56:29,364 --> 00:56:32,198
Okay. Why don't you come in
and take a look?

720
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:34,241
I'll be checking things out...

721
00:56:34,702 --> 00:56:37,027
...around here in this vicinity.

722
00:56:45,045 --> 00:56:47,204
This dog is all ass.

723
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:50,216
Jeez. Ira, look at this, man.

724
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:56,295
He would have come from in here, right?

725
00:56:56,389 --> 00:56:59,225
It's just used for storage
and access under the house.

726
00:57:05,232 --> 00:57:07,900
Looks like he crawled through the dirt.

727
00:57:11,071 --> 00:57:12,399
Hey, guys.

728
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:14,232
l was conducting...

729
00:57:14,573 --> 00:57:18,821
...a parameter check,
and there's something you better see.

730
00:57:19,912 --> 00:57:21,739
You liked that thing,
you're going to love this.

731
00:57:21,997 --> 00:57:23,326
What is it?

732
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,743
What is it?

733
00:57:34,927 --> 00:57:36,754
Great googa-mooga!

734
00:57:37,596 --> 00:57:39,090
What did l tell you?

735
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,427
They're crawling out.

736
00:57:44,602 --> 00:57:47,272
They're trying to breathe
in our atmosphere.

737
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:51,441
Fortunately, they haven't been able
to adapt yet.

738
00:57:56,615 --> 00:57:59,449
-l think l know how these things got here.
-How?

739
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:06,115
This entire area is just a honeycomb
of caves and old mine shafts.

740
00:58:06,457 --> 00:58:10,455
l believe the Moenave cave system
starts a few miles away...

741
00:58:10,795 --> 00:58:14,413
...west of the golf course.
It runs into the foothills, continues to...

742
00:58:14,507 --> 00:58:17,342
...the Kaibab Plateau
and goes right into Lake Powell.

743
00:58:19,637 --> 00:58:21,131
Our cave...

744
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,472
...is smack dab in the middle
of the system. It's all connected.

745
00:58:28,937 --> 00:58:31,309
-could you repeat that?
-I'm impressed.

746
00:58:31,648 --> 00:58:35,977
Beneath this calm, sexy exterior
beats the heart of a true scientist.

747
00:58:37,404 --> 00:58:38,898
That one's moving.

748
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:46,162
What the hell is it doing?

749
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:52,123
l think it's trying to breathe.

750
00:59:02,178 --> 00:59:04,171
That's like a big loogie!

751
00:59:21,196 --> 00:59:23,355
Mazel tov. It's a boy.

752
00:59:27,035 --> 00:59:28,613
It's oxygen tolerant.

753
00:59:37,336 --> 00:59:39,460
It's flying away. Is that a bad thing?

754
00:59:39,547 --> 00:59:41,457
Only if you're a human being.

755
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:45,968
You know how l hate shopping.

756
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:50,383
-You need something for Thanksgiving.
-l have enough clothes.

757
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:56,230
l think that colour is great on you.

758
01:00:30,305 --> 01:00:32,048
l think this may be the place.

759
01:00:41,023 --> 01:00:43,099
Ever used one of these before?

760
01:00:43,192 --> 01:00:45,599
Just 'cause I'm a teacher
don't make me a pussy.

761
01:00:45,694 --> 01:00:50,404
Ladies, there's a flying extraterrestrial
in the store. can we focus?

762
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:01,449
I'm in here. Just a minute.

763
01:01:04,295 --> 01:01:06,454
Just a second, please!

764
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:11,132
l said, just a second, bitch.

765
01:01:14,264 --> 01:01:16,968
How would you like me
to scratch out your eyes?

766
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:49,003
Here, birdy-birdy-birdy-birdy-birdy!

767
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:05,645
If l was a giant, nasty alien bird
in a department store, where would l be?

768
01:02:06,273 --> 01:02:09,024
-Lingerie.
-Not you, the bird.

769
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,348
Lingerie.

770
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,190
Help!

771
01:02:35,468 --> 01:02:37,710
You go low. I'm going high.

772
01:03:00,408 --> 01:03:02,318
We'll never find this damn thing.

773
01:03:02,577 --> 01:03:04,154
l lost him!

774
01:03:04,412 --> 01:03:07,247
How do you lose a 20-foot bird in a mall?

775
01:03:10,084 --> 01:03:11,412
l don't know.

776
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,998
What do we do now?

777
01:03:26,517 --> 01:03:27,596
Wayne.

778
01:03:28,602 --> 01:03:32,932
l think we've established that
''ca-caw'' and ''tookie-tookie'' don't work.

779
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,182
Right. Sorry.

780
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:39,444
So what do you say, Ira? Pack it in?

781
01:03:48,454 --> 01:03:50,412
Step back. I'm going to shoot him.

782
01:03:50,498 --> 01:03:53,499
Stand down. I'll kill this one myself.

783
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:56,869
Give me a chance.
I'm communicating here.

784
01:04:04,304 --> 01:04:07,968
Wayne, please stop.
You are embarrassing me.

785
01:04:31,496 --> 01:04:32,990
It's working.

786
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:35,241
Sing. Rub some funk on it.

787
01:04:44,676 --> 01:04:47,843
Here he comes!
You grab the girl, I'll get the bird.

788
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:20,794
All right! Nice shot!

789
01:05:21,211 --> 01:05:24,129
l am so sorry. l swear to God...

790
01:05:24,214 --> 01:05:26,586
...l will never shoplift again.

791
01:05:27,383 --> 01:05:28,628
Good.

792
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:42,061
So what do you want, light meat or dark?

793
01:05:42,398 --> 01:05:43,893
You have to ask?

794
01:05:51,074 --> 01:05:52,864
It's dead now.

795
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:41,360
I'm standing at the edge of
the Valley Vista housing community...

796
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:46,746
...where just below me are dozens of giant,
odd-looking, dead creatures.

797
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:51,208
We should stress that, to this point,
we have had no official word from--

798
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:56,292
This ugly tentacle came out of the ground
and tried to grab my private parts.

799
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,879
I batted it away. It got my hand.

800
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:02,056
There is anxiety and confusion
in the Glen Canyon area.

801
01:07:02,392 --> 01:07:07,386
We're outside the state capitol building
awaiting comment from the Governor...

802
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:11,977
...concerning the nature and origin
of these extraordinary creatures.

803
01:07:25,831 --> 01:07:27,824
Governor Lewis, this way.

804
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:30,837
can someone tell me
why l was not informed...

805
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,790
...that we have aliens
crawling all over my beloved state?

806
01:07:33,964 --> 01:07:37,250
Right now, 400 media vultures
are camped outside my office.

807
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,549
They know more about this than l do.

808
01:07:39,636 --> 01:07:42,638
l should throw the bunch of you
into prison.

809
01:07:42,974 --> 01:07:47,350
Not the cushy federal place with jumpsuits.
State prison, with crotch binders.

810
01:07:47,895 --> 01:07:52,640
I'm sorry, but there were earlier security
breaches by Dr. Kane and his team.

811
01:07:52,899 --> 01:07:55,141
Wait a minute. No, no. Excuse me.

812
01:07:55,486 --> 01:07:58,154
That's not exactly true, Gen. Woodman.

813
01:07:58,405 --> 01:08:01,157
l believe the Governor's question
was directed at me.

814
01:08:01,241 --> 01:08:04,444
Put a plug in it!
I'm not interested in bureaucratic crapola.

815
01:08:04,536 --> 01:08:06,528
l want to know how bad this thing is.

816
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:08,990
It's bad, Governor.

817
01:08:09,832 --> 01:08:13,996
According to the new ground sensors
and satellite thermal scans...

818
01:08:14,337 --> 01:08:16,495
...they indicate a potential problem.

819
01:08:17,673 --> 01:08:19,832
l can't read this. What kind of problem?

820
01:08:20,093 --> 01:08:23,176
Someone take this bag of snakes
and lay them out straight.

821
01:08:23,262 --> 01:08:24,341
Allow me.

822
01:08:24,513 --> 01:08:26,553
-And you are?
-Dr. Allison Reed.

823
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:28,218
Carla? Would you mind?

824
01:08:30,853 --> 01:08:34,850
The red markings indicate the growth
of the alien ecosystem.

825
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:42,687
Unless we act immediately,
we will lose Glen canyon in three days.

826
01:08:43,031 --> 01:08:44,656
Great merciful Christ.

827
01:08:45,534 --> 01:08:47,859
In a week, the rest of Arizona.

828
01:08:48,203 --> 01:08:51,038
Then, the entire southwest.

829
01:08:51,373 --> 01:08:55,204
In two months, the United States
officially belongs to them.

830
01:08:55,877 --> 01:08:57,537
And we are extinct.

831
01:08:57,921 --> 01:08:59,379
You must be shitting me!

832
01:09:05,344 --> 01:09:07,670
Admit it. You're glad to see us.

833
01:09:08,389 --> 01:09:11,389
Yes, l am. call the MP's.
Have them arrested.

834
01:09:11,725 --> 01:09:16,388
We just blew a giant alien bird out of
a store. We're covering up your mess.

835
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:19,482
I'm Dr. Ira Kane,
chairman of the science department...

836
01:09:19,566 --> 01:09:22,817
...Glen canyon community college.
This is my associate.

837
01:09:22,904 --> 01:09:26,604
Harry Block, adjunct professor of geology.
Voted for you.

838
01:09:27,157 --> 01:09:30,360
Wayne Gray.
l took some chemistry in high school.

839
01:09:33,455 --> 01:09:36,740
You two are the original discoverers
of the phenomena, correct?

840
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:40,582
Yes, and they're also responsible
for the mess we're in now.

841
01:09:40,837 --> 01:09:42,000
Here we go.

842
01:09:42,089 --> 01:09:45,374
They broke into the contained area,
breaching security procedures.

843
01:09:45,467 --> 01:09:49,334
Disseminating the alien organisms
outside the secured area.

844
01:09:49,428 --> 01:09:50,923
Liar, liar, pants on fire!

845
01:09:51,014 --> 01:09:52,841
criminal charges are in order!

846
01:09:52,932 --> 01:09:54,759
-This is bullshit!
-It is not!

847
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:56,558
Shut up all of you! Listen.

848
01:09:56,644 --> 01:09:58,601
My state is being overrun by aliens.

849
01:09:59,105 --> 01:10:03,102
Now you're supposed to be experts.
l want to know, and quick:

850
01:10:03,442 --> 01:10:05,186
How will you deal with this?

851
01:10:06,112 --> 01:10:10,939
This is an outline of the infected area
as of this afternoon.

852
01:10:11,617 --> 01:10:16,528
My plan is to evacuate everyone
from within five miles of the perimeter.

853
01:10:16,622 --> 01:10:18,864
You're talking about 10,000 people.

854
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:21,448
Yes, sir. We evacuate, make it safe...

855
01:10:22,127 --> 01:10:25,164
...then burn the alien menace
the hell out of there.

856
01:10:25,297 --> 01:10:26,459
With what?

857
01:10:27,799 --> 01:10:31,299
With napalm. Lots and lots of napalm.

858
01:10:31,637 --> 01:10:34,127
Napalm? Why don't you just nuke them?

859
01:10:34,973 --> 01:10:36,384
What about nukes?

860
01:10:36,808 --> 01:10:39,808
Nobody's dropping an H-bomb on my state.

861
01:10:40,061 --> 01:10:43,430
All this talk about napalm
and burning makes me nervous.

862
01:10:43,523 --> 01:10:47,567
And we don't know how they'd react
to such an attack on a cellular level.

863
01:10:47,652 --> 01:10:51,483
Governor, it's time for a military solution.
This will work.

864
01:10:51,697 --> 01:10:55,363
General? Sorry to interrupt.
You better take a look at this.

865
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:03,036
What?

866
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:04,868
You called me out for this?

867
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,747
Sir, one of the creatures
just destroyed video four.

868
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:10,121
What's going on down there?

869
01:11:13,468 --> 01:11:16,635
My God. They've evolved into primates.

870
01:11:18,473 --> 01:11:20,632
That's a face for radio.

871
01:11:34,989 --> 01:11:37,231
They took out six and seven.

872
01:11:37,492 --> 01:11:39,283
All the monitors are down.

873
01:11:39,494 --> 01:11:41,236
Well, that can't be good.

874
01:11:42,329 --> 01:11:43,872
That's the elevator.

875
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:47,407
We have no personnel down there.

876
01:11:47,501 --> 01:11:49,328
They breached the air lock.

877
01:11:49,753 --> 01:11:51,497
The fuzzy no-nose chimp?

878
01:11:52,548 --> 01:11:53,627
call for backup.

879
01:11:56,009 --> 01:11:57,338
We need backup!

880
01:11:57,595 --> 01:11:59,836
They're coming through the elevator!

881
01:12:01,181 --> 01:12:03,257
They're coming through the elevator!

882
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:05,758
-cover the elevator!
-Give me a sidearm!

883
01:12:05,935 --> 01:12:08,177
Okay, just stay behind me!

884
01:12:08,438 --> 01:12:10,265
Get off me! l want to see!

885
01:12:16,112 --> 01:12:17,655
Be prepared to fire.

886
01:12:33,379 --> 01:12:34,873
It's empty, sir.

887
01:12:50,645 --> 01:12:52,804
The Governor! Don't shoot!

888
01:12:52,981 --> 01:12:53,895
Help!

889
01:13:04,743 --> 01:13:06,071
Do something!

890
01:13:06,244 --> 01:13:08,865
Hold your fire. You'll get someone killed.

891
01:13:33,687 --> 01:13:35,015
Nice shot.

892
01:13:35,355 --> 01:13:36,766
I'll take that now.

893
01:13:42,529 --> 01:13:46,194
You have my full support
to do whatever you need to do...

894
01:13:46,449 --> 01:13:48,241
...however much firepower it takes.

895
01:13:48,326 --> 01:13:51,411
Melt the place down to beaded glass,
if that's what it takes.

896
01:13:52,205 --> 01:13:54,447
Get these hellish creazoids
out of my state!

897
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:57,542
Thank you, Governor.
I'll be ready to go by noon tomorrow.

898
01:13:57,628 --> 01:13:58,955
Good, sir.

899
01:13:59,045 --> 01:14:01,750
-Where've you two been?
-Just getting out of the way--

900
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,002
Get me out of here.

901
01:14:04,426 --> 01:14:06,133
Science project is over.

902
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,795
l want you and your people gone.

903
01:14:10,056 --> 01:14:12,381
Soldier, escort these men out.

904
01:14:19,231 --> 01:14:21,141
Don't you have work to do?

905
01:14:22,235 --> 01:14:24,310
You are such an asshole.

906
01:14:28,741 --> 01:14:31,314
When a woman expresses anger,
it's often because--

907
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:33,735
Shut up, Flemming.

908
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,413
Okay. l know where the car is.

909
01:14:40,085 --> 01:14:41,745
Wipe my ass, too.

910
01:14:42,253 --> 01:14:44,080
Hey, guys!

911
01:14:46,341 --> 01:14:47,966
Got room for one more?

912
01:14:48,926 --> 01:14:50,089
Hell, yeah.

913
01:14:50,929 --> 01:14:53,337
Who wants to be deputy director
of the cDc, anyway?

914
01:14:53,431 --> 01:14:55,507
The real money's in the private sector.

915
01:14:57,185 --> 01:15:00,103
-Are you sure about this?
-Oh, yeah.

916
01:15:00,438 --> 01:15:02,644
Listen, it may not seem like much now...

917
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:06,066
...but l got your research files
and original samples.

918
01:15:07,611 --> 01:15:08,940
So...

919
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,316
...if we survive this,
you guys will get the credit.

920
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,735
Thank you.

921
01:15:17,955 --> 01:15:19,864
-It's nothing.
-Let me get it.

922
01:15:19,956 --> 01:15:21,237
No, l got it.

923
01:15:26,713 --> 01:15:28,207
Sorry. Excuse me.

924
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:31,127
We haven't been formally introduced.
I'm Wayne Gray.

925
01:15:31,385 --> 01:15:33,128
I'm kind of with him.

926
01:15:33,386 --> 01:15:35,046
That's cool.

927
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:39,007
Buckle up, Allison. We're rolling.

928
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,345
Oh, my goodness!

929
01:15:44,647 --> 01:15:47,767
Facilities are being provided for you
and your families.

930
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:50,315
Please move in an orderly fashion.

931
01:16:00,246 --> 01:16:02,404
They're going to blow up the whole town.

932
01:16:03,415 --> 01:16:05,408
Hey! Hold on!

933
01:16:06,335 --> 01:16:08,079
Where the hell you going?

934
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,686
We need to clear this area, people.

935
01:16:28,815 --> 01:16:32,480
For your own safety,
evacuate immediately.

936
01:16:48,584 --> 01:16:49,829
Professor Kane!

937
01:16:49,919 --> 01:16:52,244
Arizona! It's going down, baby!

938
01:16:53,297 --> 01:16:56,084
This may not be the best time
to be drinking.

939
01:17:03,557 --> 01:17:08,017
l was your first. We discovered you
in that cave. You were scared and alone.

940
01:17:08,228 --> 01:17:09,972
It was just you, me and Harry.

941
01:17:10,063 --> 01:17:11,972
Those were good times.

942
01:17:12,732 --> 01:17:14,725
So, why not level with me now?

943
01:17:15,569 --> 01:17:18,735
You can trust me. Just talk to me.

944
01:17:18,946 --> 01:17:23,276
Tell me the secret. Tell me the answer.
Tell me how to kill you.

945
01:17:24,452 --> 01:17:26,943
You are losing it, pal.

946
01:17:27,121 --> 01:17:28,948
What is that stuff anyway?

947
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:33,042
Some of the original liquid material
from inside the meteor.

948
01:17:33,127 --> 01:17:38,121
-Why hasn't it evolved like the rest?
-l don't know. Maybe being refrigerated?

949
01:17:38,465 --> 01:17:43,590
Being in an airtight case, nothing to
metabolise with. But we've still no clue....

950
01:17:47,642 --> 01:17:49,468
When did you start smoking?

951
01:17:49,559 --> 01:17:51,932
Not much of a point
to clean living anymore.

952
01:18:18,338 --> 01:18:20,958
They react to fire like it was Miracle-Gro.

953
01:18:21,257 --> 01:18:22,420
Fire.

954
01:18:23,593 --> 01:18:27,922
The organisms were dormant in space.
They hit Earth's atmosphere and bam!

955
01:18:28,264 --> 01:18:31,348
Heat. Fire. That's the catalyst.

956
01:18:31,851 --> 01:18:35,184
So if a tiny match catalyses
this stuff like this...

957
01:18:35,437 --> 01:18:37,514
...what's a ton of napalm going to do?

958
01:18:38,107 --> 01:18:40,182
So much for the military option.

959
01:18:46,948 --> 01:18:48,609
Better call that dick general.

960
01:18:54,122 --> 01:18:57,326
-That's a lot of napalm.
-Yes, it is.

961
01:18:58,292 --> 01:19:01,377
We're going to blow those creatures
straight to hell.

962
01:19:01,963 --> 01:19:05,747
We'll flush them out along the mine shafts
then mop up the edges as they...

963
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:07,633
...run trying to escape the flames.

964
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:10,803
Excuse me, sir.
There's an urgent call from Dr. Reed.

965
01:19:11,138 --> 01:19:13,974
She says she has important information
about the mission.

966
01:19:14,058 --> 01:19:17,676
Oh, really?
Well, unfortunately, I'm not available.

967
01:19:23,817 --> 01:19:25,146
Anything more?

968
01:19:25,653 --> 01:19:26,815
No, sir.

969
01:19:33,327 --> 01:19:35,568
He blew me off. can you believe it?

970
01:19:35,912 --> 01:19:39,993
-He wouldn't even take my call.
-You did call him an asshole.

971
01:19:40,334 --> 01:19:41,661
Dr. K!

972
01:19:42,001 --> 01:19:43,828
-We got beer!
-Time to party!

973
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,672
-I'll take one of those.
-Me, too. l just quit smoking.

974
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,749
What are you boys doing here?

975
01:19:48,841 --> 01:19:51,415
Thought you could use a brew
so you can mellow out.

976
01:19:51,511 --> 01:19:53,136
Kick back and chill.

977
01:19:53,972 --> 01:19:56,545
Have a beer, relax.
It'll help with your research.

978
01:19:56,683 --> 01:19:58,925
Yeah, help with your research.

979
01:19:59,686 --> 01:20:01,179
Look at that thing.

980
01:20:02,605 --> 01:20:05,061
can we have that
when you're done with it?

981
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:08,767
Fellas, thanks for the beers,
but we're working.

982
01:20:08,861 --> 01:20:09,892
Hold it.

983
01:20:11,948 --> 01:20:13,738
-Look.
-What are you doing?

984
01:20:13,866 --> 01:20:16,072
Selenium. It could be the answer.

985
01:20:16,494 --> 01:20:20,906
I'm looking at the periodic table
on your T-shirt. I'm seeing a pattern.

986
01:20:20,998 --> 01:20:22,540
Take off your shirt.

987
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:23,864
Yes.

988
01:20:23,959 --> 01:20:25,619
-No.
-All right, look.

989
01:20:26,211 --> 01:20:28,702
We are a carbon-based life form.

990
01:20:28,797 --> 01:20:30,042
Keep pulling.

991
01:20:30,215 --> 01:20:33,465
We move down here
and you find our poison: Arsenic.

992
01:20:34,052 --> 01:20:36,211
But the aliens are nitrogen-based, right?

993
01:20:36,722 --> 01:20:38,096
You make the same move...

994
01:20:38,181 --> 01:20:42,013
...down and over,
and where do you find yourself?

995
01:20:43,729 --> 01:20:45,056
Selenium.

996
01:20:45,855 --> 01:20:48,429
It could be as lethal to them
as arsenic is to us.

997
01:20:48,566 --> 01:20:51,436
With their metabolic rates,
it'll kill them fast.

998
01:20:54,405 --> 01:20:56,896
Selenium. How much do we need?

999
01:21:00,244 --> 01:21:02,913
Five hundred gallons should do it.

1000
01:21:03,163 --> 01:21:04,823
Five hundred gallons?

1001
01:21:06,459 --> 01:21:10,326
l hate to be a buzzkill,
but where will we get that at 2:00 a.m.?

1002
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:11,998
No problem.

1003
01:21:12,256 --> 01:21:13,750
We can get that.

1004
01:21:17,886 --> 01:21:19,381
Head & Shoulders.

1005
01:21:19,596 --> 01:21:21,007
The dandruff shampoo?

1006
01:21:21,098 --> 01:21:24,716
Yeah, that's the stuff.
The active ingredient is selenium sulphide.

1007
01:21:28,438 --> 01:21:30,846
How do you know that?
You don't know anything.

1008
01:21:30,941 --> 01:21:34,356
Haven't you noticed
how shiny and flake-free our hair is?

1009
01:21:38,782 --> 01:21:41,948
Okay, this is the best idea we got.

1010
01:21:42,285 --> 01:21:44,776
Let's give it a shot. come on.

1011
01:21:45,246 --> 01:21:48,033
We'll get the troops together.
We're getting shampoo!

1012
01:21:48,124 --> 01:21:49,951
l have the perfect vehicle.

1013
01:21:50,042 --> 01:21:53,874
Good! Donalds, you just got your A's.

1014
01:22:03,389 --> 01:22:04,587
Almost full.

1015
01:22:09,478 --> 01:22:13,475
There's something l should tell you,
but l don't know exactly how.

1016
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:19,145
Just say it. We're adults and we're
about to die a horrible death soon anyway.

1017
01:22:21,656 --> 01:22:23,981
l would have rocked your world.

1018
01:22:29,372 --> 01:22:31,910
-You already have.
-All full.

1019
01:22:31,999 --> 01:22:34,158
Battle stations!

1020
01:22:37,505 --> 01:22:39,830
can we continue this discussion later?

1021
01:22:41,759 --> 01:22:43,087
Let's do this!

1022
01:22:45,012 --> 01:22:46,720
Let's shampoo us some aliens!

1023
01:23:06,784 --> 01:23:08,443
Lots of soldiers around.

1024
01:23:14,665 --> 01:23:19,708
There's an old mine half a click south.
We can sneak into the cave through there.

1025
01:23:19,921 --> 01:23:22,246
''Half a click''? What are you, in Vietnam?

1026
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:25,294
Hey, I'm digging this. Work with me.

1027
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:47,572
It's over here! It's right here!

1028
01:23:50,951 --> 01:23:52,824
-Are you okay?
-I'm good.

1029
01:23:54,579 --> 01:23:55,742
Let's go!

1030
01:23:56,081 --> 01:23:57,326
Let's do this.

1031
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:00,581
You sure this leads to the main cavern?

1032
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:03,421
It'll lead somewhere.
Geology's not an exact science.

1033
01:24:06,925 --> 01:24:08,585
Where are you?

1034
01:24:09,594 --> 01:24:11,551
Where are you, my little aliens?

1035
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,133
Show yourself.

1036
01:24:24,525 --> 01:24:26,269
Warm to the touch.

1037
01:24:30,114 --> 01:24:31,359
Highly acidic.

1038
01:24:31,949 --> 01:24:35,115
We've no time for you
to act like you know what you're doing.

1039
01:24:35,202 --> 01:24:36,577
What happened to the respect?

1040
01:24:36,662 --> 01:24:39,200
Woodman's going at noon.
We have to hurry.

1041
01:24:42,876 --> 01:24:45,877
-Good. Are the troops in place?
-Ahead of schedule.

1042
01:24:45,963 --> 01:24:47,955
Excellent. We can go early.

1043
01:24:48,965 --> 01:24:51,801
Oh, no. What is he doing here?

1044
01:24:54,971 --> 01:24:56,299
Governor Lewis.

1045
01:24:56,556 --> 01:24:59,474
l don't see anything burning.
Where are all the explosions?

1046
01:24:59,685 --> 01:25:03,135
We're just getting underway.
l didn't know you were coming to watch.

1047
01:25:03,229 --> 01:25:05,637
Well, better make it a good one, Sergeant.

1048
01:25:05,982 --> 01:25:07,310
That's General.

1049
01:25:07,566 --> 01:25:10,521
Not if you screw this up.
Keeping my chair warm for me?

1050
01:25:11,905 --> 01:25:13,066
Thank you.

1051
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:16,694
I'll take a pair of spy glasses
and a hot chocolate.

1052
01:25:16,784 --> 01:25:18,195
Give me the hose.

1053
01:25:18,827 --> 01:25:23,288
Get up top. When l give the signal,
start pumping the selenium.

1054
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:24,868
Got it.

1055
01:25:44,602 --> 01:25:47,094
We'll spray all around the meteor...

1056
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:50,011
...then get out of here as fast as we can.

1057
01:25:53,361 --> 01:25:55,354
Blue monkey!

1058
01:25:57,531 --> 01:25:59,857
Wayne, charge the line now!

1059
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:11,169
That's the napalm!

1060
01:26:11,629 --> 01:26:13,123
Woodman went early.

1061
01:26:23,724 --> 01:26:25,432
Bad!

1062
01:26:25,976 --> 01:26:27,518
Wayne, come on!

1063
01:26:30,564 --> 01:26:31,892
I'm out.

1064
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,482
We've got to go!

1065
01:26:44,244 --> 01:26:47,743
Go! Faster! Get up there!

1066
01:26:49,999 --> 01:26:51,992
Run for your life!

1067
01:26:57,423 --> 01:27:01,005
Quite a bonfire we've got.
Should have brought some wieners.

1068
01:27:01,343 --> 01:27:02,838
That can be arranged.

1069
01:27:02,928 --> 01:27:06,261
-First reports are excellent, sir.
-Very good.

1070
01:27:09,351 --> 01:27:11,059
Keep it together, Wayne.

1071
01:27:12,938 --> 01:27:14,101
Oh, my God.

1072
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:23,441
What's happening?

1073
01:27:25,033 --> 01:27:26,942
-It's coming!
-What's coming?

1074
01:27:28,996 --> 01:27:29,944
Get the hell out of here!

1075
01:27:31,789 --> 01:27:34,826
-Great flaming whore balls!
-General, look!

1076
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:51,386
Hurry!

1077
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:53,766
-Drive!
-Go!

1078
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,680
All right!

1079
01:28:48,948 --> 01:28:50,940
Fall back!

1080
01:28:55,996 --> 01:28:57,905
What the hell is that thing?

1081
01:28:58,164 --> 01:29:02,661
The napalm forced an evolutionary
response, like the match in the petri dish.

1082
01:29:03,836 --> 01:29:05,247
That's evolution?

1083
01:29:05,505 --> 01:29:09,751
Survival of the fittest. Often,
the simplest organism is the strongest.

1084
01:29:10,093 --> 01:29:11,920
Guys? It's freaking out!

1085
01:29:12,178 --> 01:29:15,345
It's starting to have
some sort of spaz attack.

1086
01:29:16,515 --> 01:29:19,007
That's not spazzing out.

1087
01:29:20,353 --> 01:29:22,097
It's getting ready to divide.

1088
01:29:26,693 --> 01:29:28,021
Mitosis.

1089
01:29:28,777 --> 01:29:31,862
Wait. There's going to be more
of these things?

1090
01:29:32,198 --> 01:29:35,032
-A lot more.
-Its cycle is starting again.

1091
01:29:35,868 --> 01:29:39,451
It will go on growing and doubling
until it takes over.

1092
01:29:40,373 --> 01:29:42,365
But we were here first.

1093
01:29:44,543 --> 01:29:48,243
So that Head & Shoulders idea.
Is that still the plan?

1094
01:29:52,551 --> 01:29:53,713
I'm driving.

1095
01:29:53,801 --> 01:29:57,634
So what if he's on Air Force One?
It has phones. I've seen them!

1096
01:29:57,723 --> 01:29:59,964
l don't think this can wait an hour.

1097
01:30:01,809 --> 01:30:04,217
What's that fire truck doing out there?

1098
01:30:20,619 --> 01:30:21,818
Mama.

1099
01:30:29,253 --> 01:30:30,912
can you believe this?

1100
01:30:31,254 --> 01:30:33,828
We have to find a point of attack.

1101
01:30:38,762 --> 01:30:40,090
There!

1102
01:30:48,939 --> 01:30:50,267
Nasty!

1103
01:30:50,606 --> 01:30:52,932
Allison, stop. Right here.

1104
01:30:55,945 --> 01:30:57,605
Here we go!

1105
01:30:58,281 --> 01:30:59,941
Get the ladder up!

1106
01:31:01,534 --> 01:31:03,443
Feed me the hose, Deke.

1107
01:31:04,036 --> 01:31:06,278
-What are you doing?
-Going up top.

1108
01:31:06,623 --> 01:31:09,623
Not before me.
l got a major score to settle.

1109
01:31:09,959 --> 01:31:11,619
Go, go, go!

1110
01:31:27,809 --> 01:31:31,309
We don't have much time, guys! Hurry!

1111
01:31:37,152 --> 01:31:39,145
-Left!
-Left!

1112
01:31:39,487 --> 01:31:42,322
Got it.
l haven't had much practice with this.

1113
01:31:45,993 --> 01:31:48,152
Stop!

1114
01:31:51,291 --> 01:31:54,291
-What's going on?
-l don't know, but it's getting bigger.

1115
01:31:54,377 --> 01:31:57,212
What are they doing with that ladder?

1116
01:31:58,922 --> 01:32:02,090
Looks like they're getting ready
to administer a jumbo enema.

1117
01:32:03,177 --> 01:32:05,668
We got one shot. Let's do this.

1118
01:32:06,347 --> 01:32:09,016
It's payback time!

1119
01:32:13,854 --> 01:32:15,348
Keep it in there!

1120
01:32:15,689 --> 01:32:17,681
What's it look like I'm doing?

1121
01:32:19,192 --> 01:32:21,019
It's working!

1122
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:28,279
Shit!

1123
01:32:30,453 --> 01:32:31,698
What the hell?

1124
01:32:31,871 --> 01:32:34,197
Oh, my God!

1125
01:32:34,374 --> 01:32:36,947
Give me back my friend, you big sphincter!

1126
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:39,121
She's going to blow!

1127
01:32:39,295 --> 01:32:40,540
Stop kicking!

1128
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:42,373
It's horrible in here!

1129
01:32:42,715 --> 01:32:45,206
-l got you!
-Help me!

1130
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:48,220
Hold me, Ira! Don't let me go!

1131
01:32:52,016 --> 01:32:54,720
We have to get out of here!
This thing's going to blow!

1132
01:32:55,018 --> 01:32:57,426
You cannot imagine what l saw in there!

1133
01:32:57,730 --> 01:32:59,058
Hurry up, guys!

1134
01:32:59,273 --> 01:33:03,105
Ira! Don't you ever tell anyone
where I've been!

1135
01:33:03,944 --> 01:33:05,023
Dear Lord.

1136
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,444
Uh-oh. Time to go.

1137
01:33:15,205 --> 01:33:16,450
Go!

1138
01:33:39,937 --> 01:33:41,266
We did it!

1139
01:34:16,848 --> 01:34:21,594
Here we go, sir. Just relax
and we'll have you as good as new.

1140
01:34:22,103 --> 01:34:26,101
l am happy to report
that all remaining traces...

1141
01:34:26,191 --> 01:34:28,515
...of the alien menace
have been eradicated...

1142
01:34:28,609 --> 01:34:31,943
...using the selenium shampoo formula
developed right here.

1143
01:34:32,029 --> 01:34:36,192
Let me introduce our civilian scientist
heroes and their team...

1144
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:41,112
...the best the great state of Arizona
has been privileged to produce.

1145
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:49,869
So this is your moment. You wouldn't
want to miss this for anything.

1146
01:34:50,714 --> 01:34:55,210
Firstly, l would like you all
to meet Wayne Gray.

1147
01:34:56,053 --> 01:35:00,050
As of today, a fully credentialed fire-fighter.

1148
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:02,217
l spoke to the chief.

1149
01:35:02,726 --> 01:35:04,137
Thanks, Governor.

1150
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:09,225
Now, our next hero...

1151
01:35:09,315 --> 01:35:12,102
...Professor Harry Block, noted geologist...

1152
01:35:12,443 --> 01:35:15,480
...and winningest coach
in north Arizona women's volleyball.

1153
01:35:15,572 --> 01:35:17,481
l appreciate that, Governor.

1154
01:35:17,741 --> 01:35:20,860
First, l thank God.
With Him, all things are possible.

1155
01:35:21,077 --> 01:35:24,908
We just played tough defence,
took it one alien at a time...

1156
01:35:24,997 --> 01:35:27,073
...and came away with the big W.

1157
01:35:32,921 --> 01:35:34,167
And finally...

1158
01:35:35,091 --> 01:35:37,759
...Doctors Ira Kane and Allison Reed...

1159
01:35:38,093 --> 01:35:42,755
...whose tireless efforts, research,
and academic findings led to the....

1160
01:35:44,099 --> 01:35:46,768
l think he's giving her
a bit of the Kane Madness.

1161
01:36:01,366 --> 01:36:04,366
Wow! Fighting the alien menace
can be tough work.

1162
01:36:04,702 --> 01:36:07,538
So is keeping your hair clean,
shiny and dandruff-free.

1163
01:36:07,664 --> 01:36:10,664
So it is a good thing that we always keep a healthy supply of...

1164
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,159
...Head & Shoulders around the house.
