1
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:38,650
Did you blow
the candles out downstairs?

2
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,331
Yeah.

3
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:45,744
Look at this.

4
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:49,234
A Thanksgiving cornucopia
made of pie plates and spackle.

5
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:51,458
What the heck is a cornucopia?

6
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,567
It's like a horn of plenty.

7
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,174
Oh, dear, can't it wait?

8
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:58,860
We just finished decorating
for Halloween.

9
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:04,689
-Well, good night.
-Good night.

10
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,397
Go look!

11
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:42,385
Just a prank, that's all. Anton.

12
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,754
Our little Scooter would
never do something like that.

13
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,787
Quit calling him that baby name.

14
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,235
Anton would not scoot his behind
off the couch if the house was on fire.

15
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:57,879
God knows he didn't help me
with the Halloween decorations.

16
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:04,667
Did you hear that?
I heard something downstairs.

17
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,967
Well, the dog's out in the yard.

18
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:09,843
It's probably just the cat.

19
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,522
Well, go see!

20
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:11,816
Hey, Bones.

21
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:22,055
Gary?

22
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,739
Anton?

23
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:10,873
Gary, you said you--

24
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:15,245
The house could burn down!

25
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:35,877
Wake up!

26
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:39,251
Anton, is that you?

27
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:10,659
If you'd like to make a call,
hang up and try again.

28
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:14,495
If you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.

29
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:17,579
Hey, Mom! We're out of milk!

30
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:26,015
Mom, we're out of dog food!

31
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:47,260
Murderin Bolan: A Special Report.

32
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:50,712
Four bodies were found.
And the killer is still at large.

33
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:52,630
Bolan is gripped with fear...

34
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:55,046
...as killings spread
from a postal route...

35
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:58,497
...to the bowling alley
and now to our own Burger Jungle.

36
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:00,606
With Halloween only one day away...

37
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:04,441
...Bolan officials have set
a 9 p.m. curfew for all teenagers.

38
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:28,562
Hey, what's up, man?

39
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,825
-What's up with you?
-I'm dry.

40
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:34,162
-So?
-So why don't you bring me a dimer?

41
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:37,498
This ain't Domino's, you lazy bitch.
Come over and get it.

42
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,067
Come on, man. I'm comfortable.

43
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:42,752
Hello?

44
00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:02,233
What's up, Anton?

45
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:06,566
Nice outfit!

46
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:18,761
Yeah? lf your mom had teeth,
she wouldn't suck dick so well.

47
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:20,372
What's your point?

48
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,325
What's up, Anton?

49
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:25,817
How's it going, brother?

50
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:27,812
Nice boxers.

51
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:30,649
Pass the chronic.

52
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,372
I'm sorry, man.
This bong is cashed.

53
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:35,597
You said you was holding.

54
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:38,358
I didn't say what I was holding.

55
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:45,798
That's messed up.

56
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,170
I hear if you combine nutmeg
and oregano you can get pretty wasted.

57
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,240
All you do is smoke pot...

58
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:53,774
...and watch TV all day.

59
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:56,765
Don't get me wrong.
That's what life is all about.

60
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,179
But don't you think you should
have some ambition, a goal?

61
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:03,400
I mean, my dream life would be...

62
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:08,462
...to lie around and watch TV
while some hot broad delivers me food.

63
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,300
Until your parents kick
your oily ass out.

64
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:14,866
I haven't seen my parents
in a few days.

65
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:17,666
Maybe they're dead.
Party at Anton's.

66
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:18,778
What are you doing?

67
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,424
With a killer loose,
you can't rule out murder.

68
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:23,265
What killer?

69
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:24,952
Don't you watch the news?

70
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:26,755
I hate that fucking show.

71
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,439
Our little town is
in the national spotlight.

72
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:31,241
Local mailman, iced.

73
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:33,849
Barmaid at the bowling alley, iced.

74
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,843
You haven't heard about the twins?

75
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:38,950
They were jerking off in the
milkshake-maker again?

76
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,245
Iced times two. Last night, when
they were working at Burger Jungle.

77
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:44,970
Damn.

78
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,457
Anton, here comes your woman.

79
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,215
He's got serious problems.

80
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:05,755
Molly's lived across the street
for, like, what, ever?

81
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:08,363
Tell her about your
obsession with her.

82
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:12,389
-Start by telling her your name.
-Yeah, man. She's waiting for you.

83
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:14,115
She's not waiting for me.

84
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:18,219
Would you stop being such a puss
and go, like, ask her to the dance.

85
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:19,484
What dance?

86
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:22,361
If you'd been to school recently,
you'd know.

87
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:24,163
Halloween thing in the gym?

88
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:26,809
9:00 curfew?
No trick-or-treating allowed?

89
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:28,496
Dumb dance is the only option.

90
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,375
You guys going?

91
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:33,405
Hell, no. Can you see us
in stupid-ass costumes?

92
00:12:33,597 --> 00:12:35,054
Grooving to Hanson and Jewel?

93
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:37,700
What do we look like,
total losers, man?

94
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:41,804
I see your point.

95
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:45,906
She dropped her lyrics book.

96
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,512
She'll catch you reading that
over her shoulder in biology.

97
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:52,618
Her songs are badass.
She's like a poet or something.

98
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:57,067
Go bring it back to her.
Be like a knight in shining armor.

99
00:12:57,297 --> 00:13:01,362
She'd be all grateful, invite me in,
offer me a drink, I'd accept.

100
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:03,011
She'd rip your clothes off...

101
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:06,117
...and make sweet love to you,
Red Shoe Diary-style.

102
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,568
-Right.
-Could happen.

103
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,291
Just go talk to her, man!

104
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,285
Maybe she'll think you're funny.

105
00:13:16,203 --> 00:13:17,315
You know what?

106
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:19,079
I think I'm going to.

107
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,533
You want to borrow some pants, chief?

108
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:23,489
First impressions and all.

109
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,908
You're a bud.

110
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,395
Think he's going to do it?

111
00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:32,463
So you got to reach.

112
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,333
You're getting
Cheezy Poofs everywhere.

113
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,327
You got to open your mouth, man.

114
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,702
Lookie what I found.

115
00:13:43,162 --> 00:13:44,350
I thought you were dry.

116
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:45,463
I guess not.

117
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:49,068
Fire me up.

118
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:24,848
These are great.

119
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:41,452
My book!

120
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,562
Thank you for...

121
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:45,440
...returning it.

122
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:10,751
You're certain this is the right man?

123
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,665
Well, I'll tell you,
Sister Liquor--

124
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:16,121
That's LeCure.

125
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:19,380
-Debi's fine.
-All right, Sister Debi.

126
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:21,221
He's right here.

127
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:29,197
It's gone!

128
00:15:29,926 --> 00:15:30,999
Shit!

129
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:33,147
Missed it again.

130
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:37,979
Where did it go?

131
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:55,427
Beaver.

132
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:04,823
Bolan.

133
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:11,957
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

134
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:25,800
Holy shit!

135
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,097
Don't move!

136
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,592
Roll over!

137
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,395
Roll over!

138
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:16,881
Anton Tobias.

139
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,949
You got a reason for
prowling around here?

140
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:21,061
I live here.

141
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:23,554
Since when is it illegal
to grocery shop?

142
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,510
Hey, I know you guys.

143
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:29,038
You guys were seniors
when I was a freshman.

144
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:30,956
Let's talk about high school.

145
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:34,254
You and your stoner friends
zipping around on skateboards.

146
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:36,095
Thought you were too cool for us.

147
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:39,622
Did you ever, even once, invite us
to get high behind the gym?

148
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:41,425
You were dorks.

149
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:49,247
Either of you holding?

150
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,360
What?

151
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,620
I'm desperate. I know you can
get in the evidence room--

152
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,225
You asshole!
You're trying to score from a cop?

153
00:17:57,455 --> 00:18:00,522
That's it.
Complete personal-effects search.

154
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,166
What's this?

155
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:06,735
Stupid, that's an asthma inhaler.

156
00:18:09,497 --> 00:18:10,954
Empty your pockets, boy.

157
00:18:11,146 --> 00:18:12,296
They're not my pants.

158
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:13,715
Let's go!

159
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:21,461
George has found a new home.

160
00:18:23,724 --> 00:18:25,411
What have we here?

161
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,328
Officer?

162
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:30,780
Smells like marijuana to me.

163
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:31,969
Write it up, Ruck.

164
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,311
What? It's empty.

165
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:36,379
You can't cite me
for possession of a baggie.

166
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,520
Littering.

167
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:42,400
Maximum fine.

168
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:46,043
Two hundred dollars.

169
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:48,880
Right.

170
00:21:10,197 --> 00:21:12,382
Oh, shit! The killer's here!

171
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:14,722
The killer's in my house!

172
00:21:44,712 --> 00:21:45,977
Okay, Dukey.

173
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:48,278
It'll be okay.

174
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,965
Come on, come on.

175
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,912
Everything's going to be fine.

176
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:56,714
Yes, it is.

177
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,417
All right, boy.

178
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,707
He's not dead!

179
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:38,285
Duke! Come on, lay down!

180
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:39,627
Get down, Duke!

181
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,580
All right.

182
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:52,743
Hold on, Duke. Hold on.

183
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:56,309
Where's the phone?

184
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:05,858
Run, Duke, run!

185
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,082
He's under the bed!

186
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,272
Mom?

187
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:27,601
Dad?

188
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:47,313
What's the matter?
Bad shrooms?

189
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:49,805
You got a fever? Here you go.

190
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:51,915
I'm going to show you.

191
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:01,502
Oh, man!

192
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:06,642
I love this video. I didn't think
they could show it anymore.

193
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,750
Guys!

194
00:24:10,476 --> 00:24:12,048
Someone killed my parents!

195
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,391
This is the best part.

196
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:18,261
Shake them, baby.

197
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:22,671
Look. Look!

198
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:25,930
-Shit!
-Yeah, you see?

199
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:31,721
Mr. Tobias?

200
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,063
Miss T.?

201
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:40,925
Is this some kind of Halloween gag?
Your parents always go all-out.

202
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:46,639
What the fuck are you doing?
That's my dad!

203
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:49,285
CPR, man. I saw it on Baywatch.

204
00:24:58,221 --> 00:24:59,716
Check it out.

205
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:04,510
A clue.

206
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:44,853
"Ant"? They were killed by ants?

207
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,962
Please, don't be stupid.

208
00:25:47,193 --> 00:25:48,803
Do you have an evil aunt?

209
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:51,679
Holy shit!

210
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:57,048
Are those ears?

211
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,196
Ear rings?

212
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:00,730
They're both lefts.

213
00:26:02,456 --> 00:26:04,143
You know what that means.

214
00:26:05,178 --> 00:26:06,865
Feldstein twins.

215
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:26,078
The killer was wearing your shirt.

216
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:32,061
The killer was wearing me.

217
00:26:36,165 --> 00:26:37,507
I'm the killer.

218
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:42,990
I'm going to call 91 1 .

219
00:26:43,796 --> 00:26:45,099
What's the number?

220
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:53,153
There's something wrong
with my friend.

221
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,799
I think he took
some nutmeg or something.

222
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:01,590
Mick, buddy.

223
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,849
-I would remember something like that.
-You would.

224
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:06,920
I'm not the killer. You know?

225
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:10,755
Yeah, I know. But if O.J.
could get off, then I'm sure--

226
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,631
Do you want a beer?

227
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:15,165
-No, thanks.
-You sure?

228
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:34,301
Talk to me!

229
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:39,862
What the hell is happening to me?

230
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,450
Pnub, man. I didn't do it.

231
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:55,125
Okay, I did it.
But it was an accident.

232
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:57,656
I can't believe
you told me to smoke that shit!

233
00:27:57,925 --> 00:27:59,765
Okay, Anton.

234
00:28:00,494 --> 00:28:01,606
I have to leave now.

235
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,945
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

236
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:24,116
It's the basement!
You can't get out that way!

237
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:38,075
Why are you doing this?

238
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:39,495
I don't know!

239
00:28:40,492 --> 00:28:41,949
It's me, Pnub! Your buddy!

240
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:45,784
I know who you are.
I don't want to hurt you.

241
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:47,049
Then don't!

242
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:50,885
It's not me!

243
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:52,265
It's my hand!

244
00:28:52,457 --> 00:28:54,757
It's like I have no control
over my hand!

245
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,079
I don't know how long
I can hold it. Run!

246
00:29:03,272 --> 00:29:04,460
Get out of my way!

247
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,418
Just go!

248
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:11,209
It's going to be okay.
I won't tell anybody.

249
00:29:11,402 --> 00:29:12,514
I swear.

250
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,354
Everything will be cool.

251
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:15,543
Everything will be...

252
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,272
...cool.

253
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:09,654
What have I done?

254
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,066
What have I done?

255
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:05,873
Get out of here, Bones!

256
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,519
Git!

257
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:26,658
Bones?

258
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,511
Here, kitty, kitty.

259
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:09,456
Aren't you a little old
for ding-dong ditch?

260
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:13,521
Sorry about your bush.

261
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:19,273
No problem.

262
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:24,911
What were you doing out there anyway?

263
00:32:30,203 --> 00:32:32,388
Jesus, look at you.

264
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:37,950
I was looking for my cat.

265
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,445
We got in a fight.

266
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:41,976
You sure got your ass kicked.

267
00:32:42,475 --> 00:32:43,932
I did okay.

268
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,032
So you ran and hid in my bush.

269
00:32:52,752 --> 00:32:54,401
I shouldn't be here.

270
00:32:54,823 --> 00:32:56,395
I'm not myself today.

271
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:59,118
I'm someone completely different.

272
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,955
You're so shy.

273
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,298
It's okay, I get it.

274
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:06,941
So let's skip this chickening-out,
sneaking-around stage.

275
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:10,086
No, you don't understand. I'm--

276
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,797
Do you want to come inside and talk?

277
00:33:25,924 --> 00:33:29,682
You never gave me a chance to thank you.
That book is important to me.

278
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:35,434
So...

279
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:39,193
...nothing cooler than
a chick bass-guitar player.

280
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:42,414
Especially one that writes
her own lyrics.

281
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:44,101
You read them?

282
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:48,971
I couldn't help looking in the book.
They're amazing.

283
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:51,809
Look, I even got
my favorites memorized.

284
00:33:52,002 --> 00:33:53,689
Devil girl with nothing to lose

285
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:57,946
She got wind in herhair
And gum on her shoes

286
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:02,931
I was 1 3 when I wrote that.

287
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:04,465
Yeah, well...

288
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:06,190
...they're amazing.

289
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:07,686
Thanks.

290
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:25,096
I should not be here, Molly.

291
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:29,008
Safer in here than on the streets.
There's a killer out there.

292
00:34:30,657 --> 00:34:34,300
That's exactly what I'm saying.
I'm dangerous.

293
00:34:34,722 --> 00:34:35,757
Oh, yeah?

294
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,867
How dangerous?

295
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:40,973
I'm not kidding.

296
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:43,044
I've done stuff, you know?

297
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:55,277
I'm impressed.

298
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:59,418
I never would've thought you'd have
the balls to just grab me like that.

299
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,219
Me neither.

300
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:54,488
You're kinky.

301
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,249
That's me.

302
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:15,848
Move it, people! Let's go!

303
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,111
Some of us are on
serious missions here.

304
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:22,215
There's evil out there
and I got to kick its ass!

305
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:31,763
Shit, my parents are home.

306
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,298
We'll pick this up later.

307
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:37,171
My parents might take offense to some
bloody boy banging their daughter.

308
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:38,551
Tomorrow.

309
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:41,082
-You want to see me?
-Come by at seven.

310
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:45,569
The curfew's annihilated our options,
but we can go to the dance.

311
00:36:47,257 --> 00:36:49,596
I thought you said
the streets weren't safe.

312
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:51,973
I'll protect you.

313
00:37:19,393 --> 00:37:20,965
Dearly beloved...

314
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:24,839
...we're gathered here today
because you're all dead.

315
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:27,254
And it's my fault.

316
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,361
Mom, Dad...

317
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,467
...what can I say? I mean...

318
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,998
...you brought me into this world...

319
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:39,986
...you put a roof over my head,
you fed me until I killed you.

320
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:46,007
If you look at it that way, I haven't
been a good son, but I'm really...

321
00:37:46,276 --> 00:37:48,308
...really, really sorry.

322
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,110
And wherever you are...

323
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:54,329
...l just want you
to forgive me...

324
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,899
...because I'm going to
try to change.

325
00:38:02,191 --> 00:38:03,418
Mick...

326
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,990
...Pnub, guys....

327
00:38:06,294 --> 00:38:07,789
You guys were the greatest.

328
00:38:07,982 --> 00:38:11,740
I'm never going to forget
the way we sat around all day...

329
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:15,114
...watched TV and got really stoned.

330
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:17,530
And all those other times
where we just....

331
00:38:21,404 --> 00:38:23,513
I guess that's all we did.

332
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:29,763
Amen.

333
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:45,064
Over here.

334
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:48,094
Anton, help me.

335
00:38:49,514 --> 00:38:52,581
Come on, man.
I can't breathe down here.

336
00:38:59,216 --> 00:39:01,286
Anton, can you hear me?

337
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:03,856
Yeah, man, Mick.

338
00:39:04,086 --> 00:39:06,041
Now get me out of here.

339
00:39:07,154 --> 00:39:08,266
You're dead.

340
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:09,301
No, I'm not.

341
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:13,022
You conked my head pretty good.
I must've been unconscious.

342
00:39:15,169 --> 00:39:17,930
-You think?
-I know, fucker, now dig me up!

343
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,282
Stay where you are, Mick!

344
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,468
Please don't kill me.

345
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,342
Watch it, man!

346
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:35,663
What did I take last night?

347
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:39,920
That dream was intense.

348
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:43,218
Intense.

349
00:40:49,776 --> 00:40:52,383
-Turn it up. Check it out.
-Yeah, I'm watching.

350
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,570
Did you see?

351
00:40:54,762 --> 00:40:55,874
-Guys!
-That's funny.

352
00:40:56,104 --> 00:40:59,632
Thank God you're alive, because
I had this dream that I killed--

353
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:07,416
Oh, shit!

354
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,712
Sorry about that thing
with the shovel.

355
00:41:12,326 --> 00:41:14,243
-You're dead.
-Easy, tiger.

356
00:41:14,627 --> 00:41:16,314
Undead, actually.

357
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,729
You said you were unconscious.
You lied.

358
00:41:18,922 --> 00:41:22,526
You killed me, all right?
Try and keep this thing in perspective.

359
00:41:22,757 --> 00:41:26,093
I was bitter about the getting-killed-
by-my-best-friend thing...

360
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:27,358
...but I got over it.

361
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:41,279
So why you here?

362
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:42,928
We need a place to kick it.

363
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,881
Don't be selfish.
No one else's parents are dead.

364
00:41:46,188 --> 00:41:48,642
No, not why are you
"here" here. I mean....

365
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:52,477
Are you flesh-eating zombies
back from hell to exact revenge?

366
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:54,049
Is that it?

367
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:56,196
Why would we go to hell?

368
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:57,271
We're not bad.

369
00:41:57,462 --> 00:42:00,913
It's not like we're good,
but at least we don't kill people!

370
00:42:01,182 --> 00:42:03,176
I didn't kill anybody on purpose.

371
00:42:03,828 --> 00:42:05,822
Yeah, well, we weren't in hell.

372
00:42:06,014 --> 00:42:09,005
There was this bright light
at the end of a long tunnel.

373
00:42:09,197 --> 00:42:12,303
There were all these chicks' voices.
And that music.

374
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:13,415
Music?

375
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:16,176
Kind of uncool music, like Enya.

376
00:42:16,407 --> 00:42:18,056
And these chicks were saying...

377
00:42:18,248 --> 00:42:20,970
..."Come to us.
Come towards the light."

378
00:42:23,578 --> 00:42:24,958
So what happened?

379
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:26,723
We figured, fuck it.

380
00:42:26,953 --> 00:42:28,793
I mean, it was really far.

381
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,847
I've got to ask.
What's with the hand?

382
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,104
It doesn't obey me at all.

383
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:44,516
The only thing I can come up with is
it's got to be possessed.

384
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:48,734
Do you guys know anything
about Satan or evil or...?

385
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:54,334
But we know somebody who does.

386
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:26,662
Did you know them well?

387
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:29,116
Not really.

388
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,573
You?

389
00:43:31,494 --> 00:43:33,603
Yeah, they were great.

390
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:38,090
I just feel really bad, you know?
Because I was always so mean to them.

391
00:43:39,126 --> 00:43:42,884
Like this one time, they asked me
to go out on a double-date...

392
00:43:43,076 --> 00:43:46,757
...and I thought they were 'tards,
because there's only one of me.

393
00:43:47,371 --> 00:43:50,247
So I told them to go blow each other.

394
00:43:53,545 --> 00:43:54,580
Did they?

395
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,636
The way you treated them...

396
00:44:01,828 --> 00:44:04,474
...the guilt must be making you feel
like shit inside.

397
00:44:05,203 --> 00:44:06,238
Randy!

398
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,232
You still in high school?

399
00:44:08,424 --> 00:44:10,955
Yeah, me, I got out
about three years ago.

400
00:44:11,147 --> 00:44:12,489
I need your help.

401
00:44:13,448 --> 00:44:15,825
What are you playing,
a little two-ball?

402
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,814
Look, I got to talk to you.
Serious stuff is going on.

403
00:44:20,006 --> 00:44:23,457
Anton, can't you see I'm getting
a little action over here?

404
00:44:27,906 --> 00:44:31,319
Oh, man. I can't believe
you cock-blocked me like that.

405
00:44:31,511 --> 00:44:33,466
I thought we were buds.

406
00:44:34,157 --> 00:44:35,039
Randy, wait!

407
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,953
I didn't mean to mess you up.
Listen.

408
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:39,755
I need your help.

409
00:44:43,629 --> 00:44:44,894
Piss off!

410
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:02,803
Fresh tomatoes....

411
00:45:04,376 --> 00:45:05,794
Hey! Who are you?

412
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,980
New. Drive-thru duty.

413
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,322
Excuse me.

414
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:11,854
Sorry.

415
00:45:22,668 --> 00:45:24,470
-Break time.
-All right.

416
00:45:25,238 --> 00:45:28,229
Give me the Big Five with
the Spicy Safari Fries...

417
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:30,223
...the African Apple Turnover...

418
00:45:30,415 --> 00:45:32,409
...and the Raspberry Rainforest Shake.

419
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:35,170
Slap some extra mustard
on that Jungle Burger.

420
00:45:35,362 --> 00:45:37,586
Tell me everything you know
about the devil.

421
00:45:39,312 --> 00:45:41,152
Are you out of your fucking mind?

422
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:45,600
You listen to satanic music.
You must've picked up something.

423
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:48,362
Look, it's just music.

424
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:51,276
Like Mozart and that other fag....

425
00:45:53,002 --> 00:45:53,960
Keep it clean.

426
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,262
Who, Beethoven?

427
00:45:56,492 --> 00:45:59,674
That's the guy. It's just like
their music, only louder.

428
00:45:59,867 --> 00:46:01,400
You got to know.
I'm desperate.

429
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:02,935
Oh, man!

430
00:46:06,194 --> 00:46:07,421
Here!

431
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:09,070
Asshole!

432
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:15,129
It's my hand.
It's like it's got a mind of its own.

433
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,891
It makes me do things
I don't want it to do.

434
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:19,808
I used to be like that.

435
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,415
Get into all kinds of stupid shit.

436
00:46:22,608 --> 00:46:23,758
Look, the trick is...

437
00:46:24,065 --> 00:46:25,714
...to keep yourself busy.

438
00:46:25,906 --> 00:46:28,091
That's why I'm always
working on the Ford.

439
00:46:28,322 --> 00:46:30,201
Keeps me out of trouble.

440
00:46:30,431 --> 00:46:33,460
Idle hands are the devil's playground.

441
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,646
Keep my hands busy.

442
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:39,136
Yeah, that actually makes sense.

443
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:40,708
Thanks.
You're the coolest.

444
00:46:55,435 --> 00:46:57,007
So do you, like, knit now?

445
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:00,497
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look queer doing that.

446
00:47:00,727 --> 00:47:02,682
Randy broke it down for me.

447
00:47:03,258 --> 00:47:06,019
"ldle hands are the devil's playpen."
So I'm thinking...

448
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:08,857
...keep my hands occupied, right?

449
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:11,541
Man, that saying's not literal.

450
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:13,036
It's more like...

451
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:14,686
...you know....

452
00:47:15,261 --> 00:47:16,488
Metaphorical?

453
00:47:16,948 --> 00:47:18,021
Right.

454
00:47:30,908 --> 00:47:32,710
This is the noise complaint.

455
00:47:33,515 --> 00:47:35,279
Ain't this the Tobias residence?

456
00:47:42,757 --> 00:47:45,019
Holy shit! It's Anton.
He's the killer!

457
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:47,512
-I better call for backup.
-Are you crazy?

458
00:47:47,704 --> 00:47:51,193
And let the feds get the credit?
lf we collar him, we'll be heroes.

459
00:47:51,386 --> 00:47:52,958
We can't go in without a warrant.

460
00:47:53,188 --> 00:47:55,373
Piss on the Bill of Rights!
We got just cause.

461
00:47:56,448 --> 00:47:57,790
Freeze!

462
00:47:57,982 --> 00:47:59,170
Yeah, freeze!

463
00:48:04,118 --> 00:48:04,923
Guys...

464
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:06,150
...what do I do?

465
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:08,489
I think you--

466
00:48:13,513 --> 00:48:15,890
I was going to say
do what the officers tell you...

467
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:17,501
...but now I changed my mind.

468
00:48:17,693 --> 00:48:19,303
You should just kill them.

469
00:48:20,953 --> 00:48:22,371
-They're alive!
-They are not!

470
00:48:22,564 --> 00:48:24,711
You shot one in the head!
They're morgue-meat.

471
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,086
Look, guys. I don't want
to kill anybody else.

472
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,767
You don't want to go to jail, though.

473
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:34,489
Jail. That's it!

474
00:48:34,682 --> 00:48:37,980
They'll throw me in a rubber room.
I can't hurt anybody else.

475
00:48:38,172 --> 00:48:39,514
Cuff me!

476
00:48:40,013 --> 00:48:41,930
Okay. Just...

477
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:45,266
...drop the knitting needles.

478
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:48,679
That's not a good idea.
Why don't you just cuff me?

479
00:48:49,101 --> 00:48:51,977
Drop the needles
and put your hands on your head!

480
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:53,320
I can't!

481
00:48:53,742 --> 00:48:55,851
Put down the needles
and come quietly.

482
00:48:56,081 --> 00:48:58,420
-Cuff me!
-Put the needles down! Now!

483
00:48:58,612 --> 00:49:00,299
-Cuff me!
-Put them down!

484
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:01,948
-Put them down!
-Cuff me!

485
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:32,358
Go, go, Buffalo!

486
00:49:35,695 --> 00:49:36,768
Stop!

487
00:49:37,536 --> 00:49:39,376
I didn't do it. It was my hand.

488
00:49:39,569 --> 00:49:42,253
It's like, the knitting
didn't help at all.

489
00:49:42,445 --> 00:49:45,359
I told you that saying
was more, like, metaphorical.

490
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:56,020
I can't keep doing this!

491
00:49:57,938 --> 00:49:59,433
I'm losing my mind.

492
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:16,038
Get your head.

493
00:50:25,051 --> 00:50:26,738
No way.

494
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:29,499
It's the only thing I can think of.

495
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:33,027
Once that hand is gone,
how will you cut off the other one?

496
00:50:33,219 --> 00:50:34,599
The left one's a keeper.

497
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:36,976
I mean, I guess it wasn't idle enough.

498
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:38,702
Are you sure?

499
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,573
I use it for a lot of things.
I light up, I change the remote...

500
00:50:44,072 --> 00:50:46,066
...l relieve a little tension.

501
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:48,558
This is the answer. I know it.

502
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,473
Those things won't even cut my bagel.

503
00:50:54,273 --> 00:50:55,423
Shit!

504
00:51:02,403 --> 00:51:03,361
Grab the carver.

505
00:51:09,114 --> 00:51:10,302
Look at me!

506
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:12,297
I'm Leatherface!

507
00:51:14,483 --> 00:51:15,441
Thanks, Mick.

508
00:51:18,548 --> 00:51:20,465
I'll just use this one.

509
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,305
I can't watch.

510
00:51:43,436 --> 00:51:44,318
You missed.

511
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:46,350
Pnub...

512
00:51:47,424 --> 00:51:48,459
...bite down.

513
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:50,146
Don't cut me, man!

514
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:02,074
You scream like a girl.

515
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:06,407
What the hell are you doing?

516
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:12,389
I got to stop the blood flow.
Don't you watch ER?

517
00:52:14,154 --> 00:52:16,991
Look at that nasty thing.
That'll be infected for sure.

518
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,136
You got any antiseptic, Anton?

519
00:52:20,366 --> 00:52:21,286
I don't know.

520
00:52:21,593 --> 00:52:24,430
Pnub's got some in a first-aid kit
in his house.

521
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,812
And burritos.

522
00:52:26,387 --> 00:52:27,805
You'll be okay, buddy.

523
00:52:28,036 --> 00:52:30,528
We'll be back in a sec
to fix you up, Anton.

524
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,083
Catch you on the flip-flop.

525
00:52:56,491 --> 00:52:57,526
Oh, shit!

526
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:19,116
Anton, are you home?

527
00:53:23,144 --> 00:53:25,253
Don't come in!
Just stay there, okay?

528
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,630
Very funny, Anton.

529
00:53:27,861 --> 00:53:29,318
Stay out there, Molly!

530
00:53:29,663 --> 00:53:31,465
I'm freezing my butt off.

531
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:48,070
Anton, we're going to be late.

532
00:53:54,858 --> 00:53:56,622
Anton, I can hear you in there!

533
00:53:56,814 --> 00:53:58,501
Stay outside!

534
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:01,416
Come on, Anton!

535
00:54:07,782 --> 00:54:09,776
Let's go!
We're going to be late!

536
00:54:21,856 --> 00:54:23,428
We're going to miss the band.

537
00:54:29,411 --> 00:54:30,523
Fry!

538
00:54:35,432 --> 00:54:36,620
Gross.

539
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:38,882
Anton, I'm coming in.

540
00:54:43,332 --> 00:54:44,175
Wait!

541
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,411
You look incredible.

542
00:54:55,642 --> 00:54:57,482
Thanks. But you should've called.

543
00:54:57,674 --> 00:55:01,163
If you needed more time with your
costume, fine. But I hate waiting.

544
00:55:01,509 --> 00:55:03,848
So what are you supposed
to be, anyway?

545
00:55:06,418 --> 00:55:07,338
I'm a...

546
00:55:08,143 --> 00:55:11,210
...fast-food employee that
cut off his own hand.

547
00:55:11,595 --> 00:55:12,553
Cute.

548
00:55:19,303 --> 00:55:20,261
Come on!

549
00:55:23,982 --> 00:55:25,592
Anton, we're back!

550
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:29,388
We got antiseptic
and adhesive bandages!

551
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:31,268
The ouch-free kind!

552
00:55:35,985 --> 00:55:39,398
"Microwave for three minutes
and enjoy."

553
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,159
This is getting on my nerves.

554
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:54,277
What are you doing?

555
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,268
Could you...?

556
00:55:57,614 --> 00:55:58,649
This way.

557
00:55:58,956 --> 00:55:59,914
Easy.

558
00:56:04,593 --> 00:56:05,436
That's better.

559
00:56:08,697 --> 00:56:09,655
All right.

560
00:56:14,756 --> 00:56:15,868
Thanks, man!

561
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,850
Gross!

562
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,496
Maybe we should clean it first.

563
00:56:25,647 --> 00:56:28,408
While we're at it,
we can clean the whole house.

564
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:30,286
This ain't our mess.

565
00:56:49,078 --> 00:56:52,260
Look, I can't go to
the dance yet, okay? I'm sorry.

566
00:56:53,488 --> 00:56:55,980
My parents will be home
in a few minutes.

567
00:56:56,211 --> 00:56:58,780
If they see the mess I made,
they'll kill me.

568
00:56:59,509 --> 00:57:01,541
Look, I won't be too long.

569
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:03,113
I'll meet you there.

570
00:57:04,456 --> 00:57:05,606
Is something wrong?

571
00:57:06,028 --> 00:57:07,600
You need to go there now...

572
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:10,744
...and you can't stop till
you're inside with everyone.

573
00:57:12,778 --> 00:57:14,580
You wouldn't stand me up, would you?

574
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:17,609
Not a chance, babysnakes.

575
00:57:25,586 --> 00:57:26,928
I'll get the next one.

576
00:57:34,598 --> 00:57:36,477
Shit! I bit my tongue.

577
00:57:43,802 --> 00:57:44,837
That's disgusting.

578
00:57:49,056 --> 00:57:50,858
I bet I can fix that for you.

579
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:03,628
Hold still.

580
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,885
That's better.

581
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,454
Burrito, burrito

582
00:58:12,717 --> 00:58:14,864
Wait, wait! Don't open it!

583
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:17,932
I'm sorry, there were only two.

584
00:58:18,163 --> 00:58:20,502
No! You let the hand out!

585
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,337
We brought you a first-aid kit.

586
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,401
-Where did it go?
-What? You mean the hand?

587
00:58:28,594 --> 00:58:29,629
Of course, the hand.

588
00:58:31,585 --> 00:58:33,579
Try looking up your ass.

589
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,611
Damn.

590
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:16,223
Hey, foxy.

591
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:18,562
Looking for a ball?

592
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:22,551
Because I could help you find one
that's the right size for you.

593
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:24,545
What the hell?

594
00:59:24,737 --> 00:59:26,079
Try and keep up.

595
00:59:26,463 --> 00:59:29,109
I'd be happy to keep up
with you, sweet thing.

596
00:59:32,407 --> 00:59:34,094
Didn't you have a dance to go to?

597
00:59:34,746 --> 00:59:37,238
That's right.
We got to do our costumes.

598
00:59:37,469 --> 00:59:38,811
You coming, Randy?

599
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,917
I think I can find myself a ride.

600
00:59:42,109 --> 00:59:43,374
All right.

601
00:59:46,596 --> 00:59:48,398
So what brings you to Bolan?

602
00:59:50,201 --> 00:59:51,466
You don't want to know.

603
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,534
No, seriously.
I'm interested.

604
00:59:54,726 --> 00:59:55,799
Really?

605
00:59:58,714 --> 01:00:00,171
Here it goes.

606
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,773
I'm a Druidic priestess sworn
to fight a certain evil force...

607
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:07,879
...that possesses the laziest
fuckup it can find.

608
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:10,602
It will kill as many people
as possible...

609
01:00:10,794 --> 01:00:13,976
...and then drag a free soul
into the Netherworld.

610
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,349
That's some weighty shit there.

611
01:00:18,732 --> 01:00:19,844
Here's the kicker.

612
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:23,410
I have the one thing
that can stop this from happening.

613
01:00:24,446 --> 01:00:27,283
I just need to find the bastard
whose hand is possessed.

614
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:28,972
Weird.

615
01:00:29,163 --> 01:00:33,228
Earlier today, this guy, Anton, told me
that his hand was doing stuff...

616
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,452
...that he didn't want it to do.

617
01:00:36,373 --> 01:00:37,791
Don't you fuck with me!

618
01:00:37,984 --> 01:00:39,594
Ease up, there, kitten.

619
01:00:39,786 --> 01:00:42,815
I'm telling you the truth.
This guy was freaked!

620
01:00:43,238 --> 01:00:44,771
Show me where he lives.

621
01:00:57,388 --> 01:00:59,612
Left! Turn left!

622
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,698
Guys! We got to go to the dance.

623
01:01:23,926 --> 01:01:25,344
The hand, it's after Molly.

624
01:01:25,997 --> 01:01:28,374
Let's check out the dance.
I'll win Best Costume.

625
01:01:28,566 --> 01:01:31,557
Chicks dig winners.
I'll probably hook up.

626
01:01:31,749 --> 01:01:35,814
Yeah, because severed heads are
one of the top ten big turn-ons.

627
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:40,109
It kills me to see you stressed out.

628
01:01:40,339 --> 01:01:43,483
You cut off your hand in the interest
of however many others.

629
01:01:43,676 --> 01:01:44,864
It's not your problem anymore.

630
01:01:45,171 --> 01:01:48,814
So what I want you to do
is take a little Anton-time.

631
01:01:49,965 --> 01:01:52,419
Just relax and kick back, my man.

632
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:54,374
No, no. You know what?

633
01:01:56,944 --> 01:01:58,056
Not this time, okay?

634
01:01:59,092 --> 01:02:01,507
I'm through with that.
All I do is sit around.

635
01:02:01,738 --> 01:02:04,307
I veg out, I watch TV,
I smoke pot--

636
01:02:04,499 --> 01:02:06,991
No Kevin Costner speeches.
Let's just go.

637
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:12,591
Come on!

638
01:02:21,641 --> 01:02:23,098
Let's go! Come on, come on!

639
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:24,517
That's him!

640
01:02:25,093 --> 01:02:28,122
-They're getting into my Ford!
-Wait here. He's dangerous.

641
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:31,113
Wait.
Don't let him steal my Ford.

642
01:02:31,305 --> 01:02:33,145
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

643
01:02:36,291 --> 01:02:37,403
That's lucky.

644
01:02:38,438 --> 01:02:39,511
Shit.

645
01:02:39,742 --> 01:02:41,391
Couldn't be automatic.

646
01:02:42,273 --> 01:02:43,116
Want me to drive?

647
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:44,574
No, just shift for me.

648
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:53,969
Anton! Wait!

649
01:03:03,403 --> 01:03:04,515
What was that?

650
01:03:04,746 --> 01:03:05,704
Who cares?

651
01:03:17,056 --> 01:03:18,513
Get back here!

652
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,775
Who's got the barf breath?

653
01:04:09,134 --> 01:04:11,204
Damn!
It's hot in here.

654
01:04:12,355 --> 01:04:13,697
So are you, babe.

655
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:19,948
I'm sweating my costume off, Curtis.

656
01:04:23,745 --> 01:04:24,742
Better?

657
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:40,081
Help me get this off.

658
01:04:59,218 --> 01:05:00,905
Right there.

659
01:05:40,558 --> 01:05:41,631
It's here.

660
01:05:42,475 --> 01:05:44,430
You guys go in the dance,
protect Molly.

661
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,965
I'll go after the hand.

662
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,681
-What a waste.
-You didn't like Curtis.

663
01:05:50,874 --> 01:05:52,638
I'm talking about that ass!

664
01:05:52,868 --> 01:05:54,593
Well, at least he died happy.

665
01:06:20,671 --> 01:06:21,974
What's bugging you?

666
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:23,547
Just thinking.

667
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:25,771
And I know who about.

668
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,995
Just thought he'd be here by now.

669
01:06:28,801 --> 01:06:30,373
He'll be here.

670
01:06:32,674 --> 01:06:34,207
I'll go get punch.
Want some?

671
01:06:35,857 --> 01:06:37,467
Okay, I'll be right back.

672
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:04,005
You guys look great!

673
01:07:04,811 --> 01:07:06,421
Who did your makeup?

674
01:07:07,879 --> 01:07:10,946
-I guess Anton did.
-Based on my design, though.

675
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:12,902
You want to dance?

676
01:07:13,132 --> 01:07:14,052
Hell, yeah!

677
01:07:17,082 --> 01:07:19,152
-We should find Molly.
-Quit being a skirt.

678
01:07:19,345 --> 01:07:22,566
We'll look for her while we dance.
There's plenty of chicks here.

679
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,634
-Careful, it's on kind of loose.
-Cool!

680
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:53,283
Don't put me on hold again.
I want to talk to your supervisor.

681
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:54,549
What?

682
01:07:55,547 --> 01:07:57,119
Yes, of course.

683
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:03,446
What's taking so long?
ls this the supervisor?

684
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,051
What do you mean
my credit card is no good?

685
01:08:07,511 --> 01:08:09,926
Well, you must have
the wrong number.

686
01:08:10,694 --> 01:08:13,340
No, it's 8-4-6-8.

687
01:08:20,243 --> 01:08:21,355
That's good.

688
01:08:22,544 --> 01:08:25,113
I think you've been a bad girl...

689
01:08:25,996 --> 01:08:29,370
...and I want to spank you
with my ruler.

690
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:32,783
Yes, that's nice.

691
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:34,432
That is nice.

692
01:08:36,887 --> 01:08:38,152
Now I'm hot.

693
01:08:38,804 --> 01:08:40,146
I'm hot.

694
01:08:41,604 --> 01:08:44,902
You got me so hot, it's like
I can feel you touching me.

695
01:08:48,967 --> 01:08:50,807
I can feel you touching me.

696
01:09:17,882 --> 01:09:18,955
Bingo!

697
01:09:31,419 --> 01:09:33,566
Come on! We got to find Anton!

698
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:36,443
And kick his ass!

699
01:09:55,579 --> 01:09:56,997
Are you Anton?

700
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:59,989
If you're a teacher,
we'll discuss my attendance later--

701
01:10:00,181 --> 01:10:02,136
I found you!
My name is Debi Le Cure.

702
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:04,668
I know what's happening.
I could stop it.

703
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:06,355
Really, how?

704
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:09,538
Die!

705
01:10:21,158 --> 01:10:22,346
Yeah, fuck him up, Debi!

706
01:10:23,881 --> 01:10:25,760
The host of evil must die!

707
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,892
Isn't that knife
a little extreme, kitten?

708
01:10:44,858 --> 01:10:47,082
You won't go anywhere,
evil-hosting fuck-stick.

709
01:10:47,274 --> 01:10:49,459
Nobody touches my Ford!

710
01:10:49,881 --> 01:10:50,724
Come on, Debi.

711
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:51,914
Give him what for.

712
01:10:52,106 --> 01:10:53,601
Wait, wait! I'm not a host.

713
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:55,097
Okay, look.

714
01:10:55,289 --> 01:10:57,283
The evil was in my hand, all right?

715
01:10:59,354 --> 01:11:00,964
I cut it off. Okay?

716
01:11:02,843 --> 01:11:03,648
Oh, shit!

717
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,143
You let it loose?

718
01:11:05,336 --> 01:11:07,100
That was probably a mistake.

719
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:10,244
No kidding. And now it's
after my girlfriend.

720
01:11:10,436 --> 01:11:12,276
-You got a girlfriend?
-I got to stop it.

721
01:11:12,507 --> 01:11:15,268
-It's out for blood.
-That ain't all it's out for.

722
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,297
If your girl's the one it's after,
then at midnight...

723
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:20,177
...it's taking her to hell.

724
01:11:20,369 --> 01:11:21,749
Hell?

725
01:11:23,168 --> 01:11:25,737
It's not even 9 o'clock yet.
We got some time.

726
01:11:27,003 --> 01:11:27,846
It's actually...

727
01:11:29,074 --> 01:11:31,911
...six minutes till midnight,
druid time.

728
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:34,174
Druid time.

729
01:11:34,481 --> 01:11:35,324
Right.

730
01:11:35,555 --> 01:11:36,360
Let's go!

731
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:45,794
Oh, God!

732
01:11:46,063 --> 01:11:47,366
That's disgusting.

733
01:11:47,942 --> 01:11:50,166
Come on, man. You're dead.

734
01:11:50,971 --> 01:11:53,693
You know, think about it.
It's illegal.

735
01:12:17,509 --> 01:12:18,966
Move! Look out!

736
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,458
Move!

737
01:12:24,604 --> 01:12:27,326
Everybody, go home!
There's a psycho killer here!

738
01:12:37,757 --> 01:12:39,981
I cut off my hand
and it'll kill you all.

739
01:12:40,173 --> 01:12:41,591
Get off the stage!

740
01:12:45,159 --> 01:12:47,536
It's true.
His hand killed us yesterday.

741
01:12:47,766 --> 01:12:50,028
Yeah, it sliced me up real good.

742
01:12:50,374 --> 01:12:52,713
-Molly, you out there?
-Get out of here, kid!

743
01:12:52,905 --> 01:12:54,055
Crank it up!

744
01:12:54,247 --> 01:12:56,739
You had your fun!
Now it's time--

745
01:13:07,056 --> 01:13:07,861
Shit!

746
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,971
-God! Did you see that thing?
-I have to get Anton!

747
01:13:36,163 --> 01:13:39,154
No, screw him!
I mean, he'll be fine!

748
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:42,337
Come on!

749
01:13:44,983 --> 01:13:45,941
In there?

750
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:49,470
You want to stay out here
and get killed and or trampled?

751
01:13:55,491 --> 01:13:57,216
I was going to get some.

752
01:13:58,175 --> 01:14:00,092
I really doubt it.

753
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:09,335
Pnub's a lot more creative
than I thought.

754
01:14:09,565 --> 01:14:11,520
I mean, he's actually kind of cool.

755
01:14:11,904 --> 01:14:14,550
-He had that costume--
-Maybe we should go faster.

756
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:16,390
I don't know if he did it or--

757
01:14:16,621 --> 01:14:18,385
-Wait, wait!
-What, what--

758
01:14:20,763 --> 01:14:21,721
Go!

759
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:33,418
Oh, shit! We're trapped in here!

760
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:36,141
-It's going to get me!
-It's not going to get you!

761
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:38,173
It's not going to get you!

762
01:14:42,507 --> 01:14:45,651
We can't go through the blade!
We'll be pulverized!

763
01:14:45,843 --> 01:14:47,223
Give me your shoe!

764
01:15:16,407 --> 01:15:18,171
What are you going to do?

765
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:23,233
No, no.
Oh, God, it's too far!

766
01:15:23,425 --> 01:15:25,304
I can't drop that far!

767
01:15:26,263 --> 01:15:27,643
We'll die in this vent!

768
01:15:27,874 --> 01:15:29,599
-We won't die.
-We'll die here.

769
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:32,169
The rats will eat us,
and nobody will find us.

770
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:37,039
Okay, we're good.

771
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:43,059
-Be careful.
-All right, let's go!

772
01:15:49,388 --> 01:15:52,379
This would be more comfortable
if your ass wasn't so wide.

773
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:54,756
-This is dumb.
-Anton needs our help.

774
01:15:54,948 --> 01:15:58,054
The best thing about being dead
is zero responsibility.

775
01:15:58,246 --> 01:16:00,508
That's Tanya. Let's save her.
Come on!

776
01:16:02,273 --> 01:16:03,155
She needs me.

777
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,647
She needs you like a fish needs--

778
01:16:10,364 --> 01:16:12,204
Okay, this sucks.

779
01:16:18,034 --> 01:16:19,759
Grab the cord and come down!

780
01:16:20,412 --> 01:16:23,058
I can't. I can't, I'm scared!

781
01:16:23,557 --> 01:16:25,206
Do it, Tanya! Come on!

782
01:16:25,397 --> 01:16:27,199
I can't. It's here.

783
01:16:27,391 --> 01:16:29,001
It's in here, I know it.

784
01:16:30,344 --> 01:16:32,069
Why'd you pull the rope up?

785
01:16:32,914 --> 01:16:34,754
I didn't pull the rope up.

786
01:16:37,861 --> 01:16:39,931
Tanya, where are you?
I can't see you!

787
01:16:40,469 --> 01:16:42,156
Tanya, talk to me, please!

788
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,805
Just jump! Just jump!

789
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:50,515
Tanya, grab the rope!

790
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:52,701
Get it off!

791
01:17:24,148 --> 01:17:27,714
I'm not going through all this Tanya.
Go back that way.

792
01:17:29,095 --> 01:17:31,587
-Now you really won't get any.
-It's unfair.

793
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:34,042
You can go back if you want
to get a piece.

794
01:18:04,836 --> 01:18:06,293
Fucking hand, I got you now!

795
01:18:43,837 --> 01:18:45,179
Who's your daddy now?

796
01:18:46,368 --> 01:18:47,556
Who's your fucking--

797
01:18:50,779 --> 01:18:52,581
We're here for you, don't worry.

798
01:18:54,882 --> 01:18:56,569
-I made that ashtray!
-Really?

799
01:18:56,761 --> 01:18:58,026
You let it go again!

800
01:18:58,487 --> 01:18:59,292
Fuck you, then.

801
01:18:59,522 --> 01:19:01,132
Fine, then! You know what?

802
01:19:01,325 --> 01:19:03,127
You aren't crashing at my house.

803
01:19:03,319 --> 01:19:04,661
Did you guys hear that?

804
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:11,219
Help! Help!

805
01:19:16,856 --> 01:19:18,006
Help me!

806
01:19:26,712 --> 01:19:28,629
Bet she wins Best Costume.

807
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:30,393
Help me!

808
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:35,493
The hand's raising the car!

809
01:19:37,296 --> 01:19:38,561
Help me!

810
01:19:40,019 --> 01:19:41,974
Don't worry, we got it under control!

811
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:43,469
Fucker's got a grip.

812
01:19:49,721 --> 01:19:51,715
Hurry, please!

813
01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:00,381
Those auto shop boys
are true artistes.

814
01:20:02,261 --> 01:20:03,986
It's Mighty Joe Bong!

815
01:20:05,636 --> 01:20:06,709
I needs me spinach.

816
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:12,117
I made that.

817
01:20:12,385 --> 01:20:15,261
The ashtray I'd almost believe.
But this? No way.

818
01:20:19,825 --> 01:20:22,164
Molly will get squished,
you bastards!

819
01:20:22,356 --> 01:20:24,810
This is important. For strength.

820
01:20:36,469 --> 01:20:37,734
There you go.

821
01:20:39,498 --> 01:20:41,300
Now you're taking Anton-time.

822
01:20:42,029 --> 01:20:45,557
You're getting stoned with
your friends? Unbelievable!

823
01:21:16,889 --> 01:21:18,768
That's some one-hit shit there!

824
01:21:19,995 --> 01:21:20,838
Don't worry.

825
01:21:21,337 --> 01:21:22,219
I'll get you down.

826
01:21:48,143 --> 01:21:48,948
That's it?

827
01:21:50,712 --> 01:21:53,703
That's it?
No explosions, no hellfire, no--

828
01:21:55,736 --> 01:21:57,116
I'm glad everyone's all right.

829
01:21:57,308 --> 01:21:58,918
But that was weak.

830
01:21:59,418 --> 01:22:01,335
Well, my work here is done.

831
01:22:01,604 --> 01:22:04,288
Time for the ritualistic sex.
You coming?

832
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:07,433
You are a pistol.

833
01:22:10,577 --> 01:22:11,612
I'm still up here.

834
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:15,984
Thanks, Mick.

835
01:22:17,173 --> 01:22:18,400
You're a bud.

836
01:22:34,392 --> 01:22:35,427
Come here.

837
01:22:47,316 --> 01:22:48,274
As usual...

838
01:22:48,466 --> 01:22:51,764
...marijuana saves
an otherwise disastrous day.

839
01:22:57,708 --> 01:22:59,740
I never got a hit. Light me.

840
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,322
Sweet Jesus!

841
01:23:11,514 --> 01:23:13,009
That wasn't my fault!

842
01:23:13,201 --> 01:23:15,847
That thing should've come down
a lot slower!

843
01:23:26,202 --> 01:23:27,620
What the hell.

844
01:23:27,812 --> 01:23:29,077
Don't forget my bong.

845
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,110
You did not make that bong.

846
01:23:31,302 --> 01:23:32,414
I arc-welded it.

847
01:23:32,644 --> 01:23:33,794
You don't take auto shop.

848
01:23:33,986 --> 01:23:35,366
Fuck you!

849
01:23:36,939 --> 01:23:38,472
You coming, Anton?

850
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:55,155
I can't even believe it.

851
01:23:55,385 --> 01:23:57,800
You blew off Heaven
to kick it with me.

852
01:23:57,993 --> 01:23:59,028
You are the coolest.

853
01:23:59,258 --> 01:24:02,556
You taking care of me
beats the shit out of heaven.

854
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:03,592
Really?

855
01:24:07,772 --> 01:24:09,229
Time for your meds.

856
01:24:17,283 --> 01:24:19,622
Guys! You blew off heaven too?

857
01:24:19,814 --> 01:24:22,114
No, we're your guardian angels.

858
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:26,217
Poor thing has delirium.
Visiting hours are over.

859
01:24:29,324 --> 01:24:31,126
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

860
01:24:37,339 --> 01:24:39,793
So the deal is
we're supposed to monitor you...

861
01:24:39,985 --> 01:24:42,707
...and make sure you don't revert
to your evil ways.

862
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,587
But you seem fine now.

863
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:48,077
Let's hit the Snack Master in the hall.
You want anything?

864
01:24:48,269 --> 01:24:50,608
Get me Crunch Nuggets.
Those are awesome.

865
01:24:54,711 --> 01:24:56,321
Thanks, you guys.

866
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,192
Hit the light.

867
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:12,927
Mick! Pnub!
Come guardian me!

868
01:25:18,679 --> 01:25:21,094
You're right.
Anton screams like a girl.

869
01:25:21,402 --> 01:25:23,856
Think we should tell him
we painted that?

870
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,809
Fuck it.
Let's go walk through a nurse.

871
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,264
Watch it! Some of them are guys.
