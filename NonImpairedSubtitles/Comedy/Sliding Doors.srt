Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...
Oh, shit

3
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:13,052
Hello, Helen... I' d almost
forgotten you work here

4
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:18,423
I know, I know, you'd almost
forgotten I work here...

5
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,797
but I swear I was up all night toying
with ideas for the fashion show...

6
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,663
...and I've really hit
on something. You see...

7
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,636
What?

8
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:35,515
I took four bottles of vodka on Friday,
it was my birthday, you know that

9
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,607
I was having a party and I was
running late, so I borrowed some

10
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:40,447
I bought some more to replace it

11
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:43,113
Not a lot of use to me when
I had nothing to offer the executives

12
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:44,747
who dropped by late Friday

13
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,588
Off the top of my head, you could
have told them you'd run out

14
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:50,891
It's, it's popular stuff

15
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:54,159
Bullshit, bullshit... We're in PR.
That's what we do, isn't it?

16
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:59,264
But you didn't do that,
did you, Paul?

17
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:01,073
No

18
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,269
So I'm out... am I?

19
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:11,116
Well, this is just perfect

20
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:15,151
Congratulations. You've wanted me
out for ages, now you've done it.

21
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,779
Very well done

22
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:22,925
For theft. Pretty foolproof

23
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:26,660
Okay, I'll go... I'll go

24
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:29,736
I was getting a bit choked up with all
the testosterone flying about the place

25
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:31,998
Best I get out before
I start growing a penis

26
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:36,942
Oh! Told you... lesbian

27
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,119
I really didn't think it'd be
so easy to crack, did you?

28
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,721
No
Oops

29
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:01,495
Thank you

30
00:06:14,237 --> 00:06:17,173
District Line information.
Due to a derailment at Victoria...

31
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:19,743
...District Line trains are
subject to extensive delay

32
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:22,643
We suggest you find
alternative means of transport

33
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:57,214
Are you all right, love?
Oh, it's a bit of a nasty cut

34
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:59,709
Might need a couple of stitches...
Come on

35
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:13,028
Oh-oh... Ah, Beatles' lyrics, eh?

36
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,995
What?

37
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:17,227
'Elastic Thrombosis'.
They're guilty of lyric poaching

38
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:18,826
They're Beatles' lyrics,
aren't they?

39
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:20,564
I don't know, sorry

40
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:22,404
Of course you do. Come on,
everyone is born knowing all

41
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:23,668
the Beatles' lyrics instinctively

42
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:26,676
They're passed into the foetus subconsciously
along with all the amniotic stuff

43
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:30,271
In fact, they should be called
'The Foetles'

44
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:35,813
Not a fan, clearly

45
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,072
It's funny the way nobody
talks on the tubes, isn't it?

46
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,509
I mean, I rarely catch
the tube myself but, er... or lifts

47
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,781
Confined spaces,
everybody shuts down. Why is that?

48
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,450
Perhaps we think everyone else
in the tube or the lift

49
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,854
is a potential psychopath
or a drunk...

50
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,291
...so we close down and pretend
to... read a book or something

51
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,454
You've got a terrible tea stain
on your book

52
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,761
Look, I don't think you're a psychopath.
I just want to read my book

53
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,527
I, I understand. I apologise

54
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,595
I'm in a little bit of a good mood
today as a matter of fact so I'll just

55
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,833
...sorry

56
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,467
Have we met before?

57
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,106
No, no, honestly, honestly,
I'm, you... you seem familiar

58
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,705
I don't think so

59
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,649
Yes... Yes, you were
in the lift just now

60
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,677
You dropped your earring,
I picked it up

61
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,954
Oh yes, you did... Thank you

62
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,390
Pleasure

63
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,422
Do you work there?

64
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,089
I did do but I've just
been fired. Okay?

65
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,502
Oh no, that's... that's horrible,
I'm sorry

66
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,571
It's okay, you didn't do it

67
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,870
I thank you for your concern and glad
you're in a good mood, et cetera

68
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:05,241
I thank you for picking up my earring
but... I just want to read my book

69
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,427
Well, I get off at this stop.
I'm only telling you in case

70
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:22,654
you get off at this stop, too...

71
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,095
...and you get up before me
and then I get up and you think

72
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:25,096
I'm following you which I'm not

73
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,897
I mean, I wouldn't. I mean...

74
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:29,625
...you know

75
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,540
I really didn't mean any offence.
Please forgive me

76
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:36,809
I'm really not a nutcase...
I apologise

77
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:46,620
Excuse me. Um, I'm sorry

78
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,622
I, I'm sure you're not a nutcase or a
psycho or anything, it's just that, um

79
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:55,027
...I'm not, I'm not that good at,
um... you know, um...

80
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:59,130
Constructing sentences?

81
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:00,292
Anyway...

82
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,026
I'm James

83
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,960
Helen

84
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,477
I never figured out
why we didn't make it, Gerry

85
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:18,081
You went back to America, remember?
I couldn't afford the bus fares

86
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:19,484
I came back though

87
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:25,855
Turn my back for three lousy years and you
callously ditch me for another woman

88
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:29,596
Mmm, I know, I suppose
I'm just naturally impetuous

89
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,864
I live with someone. A man.
I live with a man

90
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:35,095
Really?

91
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:38,997
Mmm! I have people consider soul mates
who don't confide in me this much

92
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:43,740
And what would he say if he knew you were
walking up from the tube in broad daylight

93
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:44,972
...with a complete stranger?
Mmm, big deal

94
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:53,813
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Helen... Sorry about your job, really

95
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:56,222
I suppose being a Gemini
can have its down sides

96
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,620
Hey, remember what
the Monty Python boys say?

97
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,591
What..."Always look
on the bright side of life"?

98
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,165
No..."Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition"

99
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,457
What?

100
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:17,834
I didn't think you liked Elton John

101
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:21,071
I, I do, I do sometimes

102
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:35,087
You really shouldn't just stop like that.
Set a woman back three days

103
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:37,093
doing a thing like that

104
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:41,328
Who is she?

105
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,168
She's Lydia

106
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,948
Well, I've had a dreadful day

107
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:03,244
I got sacked.
And so did you it would seem

108
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,888
Cup of tea?

109
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:08,852
That'd be nice

110
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:13,265
You bastard! You bastard!

111
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:15,732
You useless shagging bastard!

112
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:29,316
I come home and catch you up to
your nuts in Lady Shagging Godiva

113
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:35,153
I am working all hours to support you while
you are supposedly writing your first novel

114
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:39,822
How long?
Huh?

115
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,986
Do you love her?

116
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,192
No, don't tell me,
I'm not interested

117
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:53,771
I'm only asking because I need
to know exactly how big a mug I am

118
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,740
Look, er... Iook...

119
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,548
Hello?
Helen? Is that you?

120
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:13,612
No, it's your bit of stuff.
Wednesday... shag day, remember?

121
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,761
Have you just got up, you lazy git?

122
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:26,299
Er, no. Er... well I, er...

123
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:29,036
...I didn't sleep that well
last night and then, er...

124
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,939
you know when you left I kind
of... I went into a really, er...

125
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:37,809
...a really, really deep, deep,
er, deep, deep sleep

126
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,812
And, er... I think I might be, er, coming,
coming down with, er... anyway, er

127
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,248
...what are you doing home
at this time of...

128
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:49,590
Oh my God, what happened to you?

129
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:54,654
Well, it depends.
Which story do you want first?

130
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:55,957
What?

131
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:59,035
Well... I got mugged. And...

132
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,097
What are you doing?

133
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:07,333
I can't stand Elton John.
You know that

134
00:16:09,378 --> 00:16:12,473
Well, anyway... listen, tell me...

135
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:14,209
...what happened?
What happened to your head?

136
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:17,576
Well, I got mugged
and sacked only not in that order

137
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,279
Although it wasn't an actual mugging,
it was only an attempted mugging

138
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:20,355
according to the policeman...

139
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:22,823
...because they didn't...

140
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:24,825
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
wait a sec, wait a sec.

141
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,121
Come here... Come here

142
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:29,955
Now sit down. Just sit here. Okay?

143
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:36,773
Now... now you're in shock, darling,
okay. You've had a bit of

144
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,305
a little bit of a shock. Okay?
Now just relax

145
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:42,675
Um... do you want a brandy?

146
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:45,705
It's four in the afternoon

147
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:47,341
Of course it is... sorry

148
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:50,050
Gerry!

149
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:52,587
Are you okay?

150
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:56,091
Me? I'm fine... Um, I'm fine.
I'm just... No, anyway, anyway

151
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,423
Tell, tell, tell me what happened

152
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:27,583
And I just couldn't help
thinking...

153
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:31,390
if I had just caught that bloody
train it would never have happened

154
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:33,487
I'd have been home ages ago

155
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:37,558
Oh, well, you don't want to go
wondering about things like that

156
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:40,660
You know, um,'if only this',
and 'what if that'. I mean...

157
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:46,132
It's done now

158
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:48,504
Come on

159
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,141
Follow

160
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,611
Splash

161
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,550
I'm going to take you out...

162
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:58,623
and get you alarmingly out of
your head on Grolsch and then...

163
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:01,318
Dry
Thank you

164
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:04,122
Um, and then follow, follow,
follow, follow, follow...

165
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:06,830
and then when you've sung all your
favourite Barbra Streisand songs

166
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:08,229
at the top of your voice...

167
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:10,597
and got us slung out of the pub...

168
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:13,466
Ah, here we are. Yeah, put this on

169
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:17,099
I'm going to let you have intimate
carnal knowledge of a Lamb Passanda

170
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:19,007
...which I know your diet
does not allow, with a...

171
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:21,444
...double Tarka Dahl
which you can then, er...

172
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,071
...puke up all over the, er...
pristine doorstep of Herr

173
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:24,206
and Frau Goebbels next door and...

174
00:18:24,315 --> 00:18:26,876
I'll help you

175
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,082
Oh, I love you, Gerry

176
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:33,125
Gerry! She's not here!

177
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:36,059
Anna, you're Helen's best friend.
I mean, where else would she be?

178
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,152
Come in and search the place
if you want. She's not here, Gerry

179
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:43,670
What is it you've done anyway? It can't be
that nice if she's walked out on you

180
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:46,261
Okay, look, I, I'm sorry.
Look, if she comes here...

181
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:49,205
...just let me know or, or get her
to ring me or, or something

182
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:51,072
That's all I ask

183
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:53,372
Like you say, Gerry,
I'm Helen's best friend

184
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:55,572
If she comes here
I'll do what she asks

185
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:25,306
Well, she's got a point...
You can't stand Elton John

186
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,279
Russell, forget about Elton John.
That's not the issue. What do I do?

187
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:29,405
Gerry...

188
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:31,416
you've been telling me for weeks
you couldn't hack it juggling

189
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:32,815
between Helen and Lydia...

190
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:35,184
...and you wish you hadn't
got involved with her again

191
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:36,118
I know

192
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:38,453
And you didn't think you were
cut out for infidelity

193
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:39,389
I know

194
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:42,223
But you couldn't end it with Lydia,
'cause you weren't sure how she'd take it

195
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:47,159
And I told you that something
if you remember my words,

196
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:49,259
something 'ungoverned by you'
would happen...

197
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:51,634
...to bring the situation to a head

198
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:54,736
And... something has

199
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:02,071
It's not funny actually, Russell

200
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,710
No, I'm sorry, old man...
I beg to differ

201
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:07,650
It is funny.
It's very, very, very funny

202
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:11,487
And look at you, it's not as though
you're rushing frantically

203
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:13,151
about the place trying to find her

204
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,818
I went to Anna's. She wasn't there

205
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:18,831
Oh, you went to Anna's. Boy,
you're a one man SAS crack unit

206
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:23,334
You want my opinion?

207
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:24,996
Will I like it?

208
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:27,666
Well, of course not...
It'll be based on reality

209
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:39,051
No, no, no. You don't advertise
a new restaurant. It's very uncool

210
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:42,256
It's word of mouth... People talk

211
00:20:42,856 --> 00:20:46,487
And how do these people who talk know where
you are so that they can talk about you?

212
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:49,428
Hey, listen, it's your restaurant,
Clive. I just want it to work

213
00:20:49,531 --> 00:20:51,329
Helen

214
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:55,565
Hello, James. Rather annoying
chatty bloke on the tube

215
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:58,105
Oh yes, hi

216
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,342
You look all stressed up
with nowhere to go

217
00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:03,969
It's only a job,
you'll get another one

218
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,344
No, it's something else, isn't it?

219
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:09,509
You know sometimes it helps
to just say whatever it is out loud

220
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:12,785
Of course it also helps if people
just mind their own business

221
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:14,355
and leave you alone. I'm sorry

222
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:17,689
When I left you at the tube earlier,
I went home and found my boyfriend...

223
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:19,089
...in bed with another woman. Shit!

224
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:24,100
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's... I mean, what an idiot

225
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,596
It's okay, you weren't to know

226
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,637
No, not me, your boyfriend.
He's an idiot

227
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:33,002
Sorry, it's not my place

228
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,275
It's okay

229
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:39,082
Well, look, if it makes you feel any better,
you see that bloke over there?

230
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:42,516
Not only does he own a personalised
matching set of crocodile skin luggage...

231
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:44,780
...but his favourite TV programme
is'Baywatch'

232
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:47,819
So you see there's always someone
sadder than you

233
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,020
Do you love him?

234
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:55,923
No, I could never
love a 'Baywatch' fan

235
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,202
Hey, you did a joke in the midst
of your turbulent emotional state

236
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,238
That's very positive

237
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,838
Listen, you decide you want
company we're over here... Okay?

238
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:09,772
I'm really sorry, Helen

239
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,654
Two of your most disgustingly
large Grolsches, please...

240
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:30,063
...and a large Jack Daniels
with ice, and I'll have the same

241
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:37,470
You're behind. Can we have another?

242
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,643
Fifteen?

243
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,943
Gerry came looking for you

244
00:23:12,043 --> 00:23:13,305
Is it what I think?

245
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:15,836
Depends

246
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:20,386
Is what you think that I walked in on him
shagging 'Lydia' in my bed and I walked out?

247
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:22,681
Pretty much

248
00:23:23,054 --> 00:23:24,784
Then, yes

249
00:23:39,637 --> 00:23:40,696
Oh, hold up... hold up

250
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:44,405
This morning was sensational

251
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:46,535
Oh, I can't...
sorry, I can't hear you

252
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:48,135
I can't hear you

253
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:49,714
Gerry, can you hear me?

254
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:50,679
Didn't know it was on

255
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,773
Ready, steady, go!

256
00:23:55,553 --> 00:23:56,543
I'll see you, Clive

257
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:02,989
Who's that?

258
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:04,289
My friend

259
00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:09,123
Come on, you... Let's get you home.
You drunken eejit

260
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,267
And again

261
00:24:14,673 --> 00:24:15,902
Come along

262
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:19,334
Can I give you a lift anywhere?

263
00:24:19,444 --> 00:24:22,312
Er... yeah.
That, that'll be great, thank you

264
00:24:22,414 --> 00:24:24,645
Oh, hands up
if you drank too much, eh?

265
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:28,379
Hey... I'm not as drunk
as thinkle peep I am

266
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:30,752
Put a wick in her mouth
and she'd burn for a fortnight

267
00:24:37,162 --> 00:24:39,597
Um, 9 Menlove Avenue. Thanks a lot

268
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:45,067
French bean, some chicken,
some rice...

269
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:46,729
...one more little Indian

270
00:24:46,838 --> 00:24:49,502
No. Oh, come on.
Really, I'll be sick

271
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:51,372
Well, we're on schedule for that
but we've gotta move location...

272
00:24:51,476 --> 00:24:53,138
...so just don't swallow
for ten minutes

273
00:24:57,784 --> 00:24:59,446
He didn't fancy me

274
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:02,351
He, he offered us a lift.
He was just being concerned

275
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:06,185
Uh-huh... Well let me tell you,
if he was being that concerned about me

276
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:08,318
...I wouldn't be helping you
into bed right now

277
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:10,720
Am lin bed?

278
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,197
Yes... You're staying with me
for a while

279
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,131
Don't worry... You'll be fine

280
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:16,725
Just fine

281
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:22,532
There we go. There we go

282
00:25:27,915 --> 00:25:33,287
Are you some peculiar, thus far
undefined breed of dickhead?

283
00:25:34,088 --> 00:25:37,149
You have two head problems

284
00:25:37,257 --> 00:25:42,060
One: That was close... Very close

285
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:45,461
Put in layman's terms...
she nearly caught you

286
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:50,972
And two... and this is far
more worrying than the first one

287
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:55,235
You're talking to yourself
in the mirror again

288
00:25:57,645 --> 00:25:58,977
Really bad sign

289
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:18,426
No, bigger sip... big, bigger sip.
Bigger sip... Don't throw up all over me

290
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:24,528
There are no PR jobs

291
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:29,199
I'm going to need
some part-time work, Gerry

292
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:34,579
What you need is a change of image

293
00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:39,122
Er, you know that goes back like and then like
I don't know sort of comes like slant

294
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:16,924
No, no...
That's for you, sir

295
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:51,795
Hey, gorgeous. What do you do when you're not
serving up 'mad cow' burgers in here, eh?

296
00:27:51,894 --> 00:27:53,362
Well now then, let me see

297
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,954
I get up about seven thirty a. M...

298
00:27:55,065 --> 00:27:57,557
...make and deliver sandwiches
in the West End during the day...

299
00:27:57,667 --> 00:28:00,193
...before I come here about
six o' clock and finish at midnight

300
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,672
After that, if I've got any energy left,
I give my boyfriend a blow job

301
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:06,039
Would you like some mayonnaise
with that?

302
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:08,474
You don't mean that

303
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:10,342
I do... Really

304
00:28:11,882 --> 00:28:14,579
So... you were together two
and a half years, and...

305
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:18,547
...you've been sitting here
like suicide on a stick for a week

306
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,647
Nine days, Anna

307
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,122
But bollocks to him?

308
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:28,064
Yes. I mean why hasn't he even called to see
if I'm okay to admit that he's a twat?

309
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:30,866
"Hello, Helen, it's Gerry

310
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:33,597
I'm a twat. Please come home,
I love you. " All that shit

311
00:28:33,703 --> 00:28:36,798
Oh, I don't care anyway Bollocks
to him. I'm over him

312
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:38,973
Oh... you're over him

313
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:42,513
Yes. Totally and utterly
and completely over him

314
00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:43,409
No, you're not

315
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,242
I am

316
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,076
You're not

317
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:48,313
Anna, I'm over him. What do you mean
I'm not? How do you know I'm not?

318
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:51,754
Well, two things really

319
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,382
One: You're still counting how
long you've been apart in days...

320
00:28:54,492 --> 00:28:56,324
...and probably hours and minutes

321
00:28:56,427 --> 00:28:59,762
But... the big flashing red light way of
telling you're not really over someone

322
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,730
...is when you're still
reading their horoscope...

323
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:04,598
in the hope that they're going to get wiped out
in some freak napalming incident

324
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:06,330
Smart arse

325
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,807
What is he?

326
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:09,998
A wanker

327
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:12,840
Oh, Aries

328
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:14,880
Aries. Aries

329
00:29:16,914 --> 00:29:20,374
Well... just shows how much I know

330
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:24,752
With Mars your ruler in the ascendancy... you will
get wiped out in a freak napalming incident

331
00:29:24,857 --> 00:29:27,019
...and Helen says bollocks to you
This guy's very good

332
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:35,056
You go. No, I will. No, you

333
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:39,293
I'm not in, I'm out.
You don't know where or who with

334
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,099
Specially who with

335
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,765
Quickly, go on

336
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:46,311
I am not answering the door
like this

337
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:49,609
Anna, please, you have to.
It won't be him anyway

338
00:29:50,215 --> 00:29:51,478
So there's no big deal, is there?

339
00:29:57,423 --> 00:29:59,414
Bollocks to him

340
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:01,686
Bollocks to him. Bollocks to him. Bollocks to him.
Bollocks to him. Bollocks to him

341
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:03,921
Bollocks to him

342
00:30:15,508 --> 00:30:19,776
Come on. You don't drink your fatty drinks,
you'll never really achieve quality cellulite

343
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,312
Haircut suits you by the way.
No, it does. It does, no gag

344
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:29,415
Never make a joke about women's hair,
clothes or menstrual cycles, page one

345
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:32,321
Look, James,
maybe I shouldn't be here

346
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:35,225
I'm sorry, I'm not being fair

347
00:30:36,796 --> 00:30:41,735
You know, under normal... circumstances,
et cetera... you're really nice... and funny

348
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:45,237
My friend Anna thinks you're cute

349
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:46,931
Wait, hold, hold

350
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:50,478
Your friend Anna thinks I'm cute?
Your friend Anna thinks I'm cute?!

351
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:54,209
Shit, I just blew, wait...

352
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:57,413
Two eighty-five,
two eighty-five on the wrong girl

353
00:30:59,185 --> 00:31:00,483
Helen, listen...

354
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:03,982
sometimes we are plonked into people's lives
when they just need to be cheered up and reassured

355
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:09,588
...and it turns out that
for some reason it's your job

356
00:31:09,697 --> 00:31:11,359
We don't know why.
In your case it's my job

357
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:14,128
But I'll be honest...

358
00:31:15,335 --> 00:31:19,603
the fact that I find you... moderately attractive
just makes the job easier on my part

359
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:24,504
My intentions are completely honourable
I have no desire to overstep the mark, seriously

360
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:28,473
D'you prefer diamonds or sapphires?

361
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:29,845
Sorry, nothing

362
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,714
'Moderately attractive'?

363
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:34,584
Uh-huh, I knew you were listening

364
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:38,319
Well, you know, lose the sad eyes,
the droopy mouth, I could get you an upgrade

365
00:31:40,328 --> 00:31:43,059
So... having firml y established
the ground rules...

366
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:44,996
...what are you doing
two weeks on Saturday?

367
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,326
Probably killing myself

368
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:48,493
Excellent.
What time does that finish?

369
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:50,036
Do you like boats?

370
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:55,235
D'you know we haven't done that
for two months

371
00:31:55,342 --> 00:31:57,277
Don't be daft

372
00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:00,214
Two months... Almost to the day

373
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:04,042
Almost to the day? Listen to you
what are we, a survey?

374
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:06,848
Gerry...

375
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:11,492
...how did one of my Waterford crystal
brandy glasses get into the laundry basket?

376
00:32:12,594 --> 00:32:13,425
To the where?

377
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:14,860
The laundry basket

378
00:32:16,364 --> 00:32:19,892
I don't know. Can I answer
questions on 70s pop music?

379
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:23,598
Last week, when I got the sack
and I came back, am I going mad?

380
00:32:23,705 --> 00:32:27,268
But there was a bottle of brandy and two
glasses on the dressing table, wasn't there?

381
00:32:28,276 --> 00:32:30,040
I don't know.
I mean, I couldn't really say

382
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,705
Well, there were, I'm sure

383
00:32:31,814 --> 00:32:34,545
Oh, hang on, no, wait a minute.
No, I, no, I could say

384
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,586
There was a bottle and one glass
because if you...

385
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:39,950
No, I'm certain there
were two glasses, Gerry

386
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:43,993
Helen, I'm... not sure I like
where this conversation is going

387
00:32:44,093 --> 00:32:48,429
I, I told you, I couldn't sleep
so I got up in the night...

388
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:49,965
to get a drink to
knock myself out It was still there

389
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:50,998
in the afternoon when you got home

390
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,969
I mean you had also, that day if,
if you remember had taken a blow

391
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,971
to the, the, the, the head

392
00:32:57,273 --> 00:32:58,468
We'd just had a party

393
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:01,942
Maybe one of y our mad friends
like Anna threw it there

394
00:33:03,045 --> 00:33:04,171
I mean, Jesus

395
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:08,684
Let's, let's spoil the moment
properly, shall we?

396
00:33:08,784 --> 00:33:09,911
What are you trying to say?

397
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,512
Am I shagging a brandy drinker? Yes

398
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:16,320
Gerry, ease up, will you,
for Christ's sake. I'm only asking

399
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,764
Oh, no, women never ask.
No, they don't ask, they insinuate

400
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:24,528
And you are insinuating, not very subtly,
may I add, that I am...

401
00:33:29,205 --> 00:33:30,104
Thanks

402
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,578
No, no, no. No, no, no, no,
thank you, thanks

403
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:38,479
I mean... I mean thank you...
thank you

404
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:42,347
I mean this, you know, this,
this is the... this is the right time,

405
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:44,888
isn't it, to address our,
our relationship, isn't it?

406
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,153
I mean, it's, it's, it's perfect.
Perfect moment

407
00:33:48,258 --> 00:33:51,422
Gerry, for God's sakes,
I asked a simple question

408
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:53,360
There's no need to
become Woody Allen

409
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,003
Thanks, James. I'm sorry
if you had a lousy time

410
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:10,171
Are you kidding?

411
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,773
In my book getting to drink
two chocolate milkshakes

412
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,750
in the one sitting represents
social splendour

413
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,616
It's one of the perks
of being shallow

414
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,423
Take care, Helen. You'll be fine

415
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,872
Thank you very much

416
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:50,754
It's amazing how you can actually learn
to despise inanimate objects...

417
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,551
...like tin openers
that don't open tins...

418
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,991
...egg mayonnaise and skipjack tuna

419
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,523
Are you going out?

420
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,854
Yeah. I was just writing you a note

421
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,956
I'm off to the library.
I have some stuff to read up on

422
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:02,628
Okay

423
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,596
Yeah, well... I won't be
more than a couple of hours

424
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:09,197
Would you rather I didn't go?

425
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,174
Oh no, no, of course not. Go

426
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:14,004
Okay, bye

427
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,031
Lydia, what are you talking about?
She followed me

428
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:08,363
I said I was going
to the library...

429
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:11,199
...so I've come to the library,
for God's sake!

430
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,435
Of course I can't come now,
I mean what if she's still lurking

431
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,442
or waiting round the corner
or something?

432
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:20,574
Lydia, I don't know
why she followed me.

433
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,909
I'm not a sleuth! I have taken
two hours off work, Gerry...

434
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:25,416
Oh, look, look, please. No, okay,
please don't get hysterical

435
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,886
Don't get hysterical.
Look, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry

436
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:30,750
I've booked a hotel in Dorset.
Are we still going?

437
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:34,090
Do you wanna cancel it? I mean,
is, is she gonna follow us there?

438
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,991
Do you wanna end this Gerry
because I am...

439
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:38,691
Yes, I, I, I mean no. I, I mean,
no, I, I don't want

440
00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:42,327
Of course we're still going.
I don't... don't, don't...

441
00:36:43,637 --> 00:36:45,332
Don't, don't, don't, don't what?

442
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:47,271
I don't know

443
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:51,176
Look... we're going to dorset, okay.
We're going to have a great time... and, er

444
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:54,475
...I'll talk to you tomorrow

445
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:07,824
Right, that's the lot.
You don't live there anymore

446
00:37:08,596 --> 00:37:10,086
Thanks for going again, Anna

447
00:37:11,665 --> 00:37:13,691
Any evidence of 'her'?

448
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:15,167
Nothing that stood out

449
00:37:19,474 --> 00:37:20,338
Hello?

450
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,801
Hi, it's James. Is Helen there?

451
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:24,140
Helen

452
00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:27,105
It's James

453
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:33,579
Hello?

454
00:37:34,757 --> 00:37:38,319
Yes, 'tonight' tonight, you know the tonight
that comes immediately after today

455
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:41,529
He wants to go out tonight

456
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,222
Go

457
00:37:43,331 --> 00:37:45,027
Please come, it'll be a laugh

458
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:47,728
Um... okay

459
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,565
See you

460
00:37:53,476 --> 00:37:54,101
Okay?

461
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:56,303
She doesn't wanna leave here

462
00:37:57,346 --> 00:37:58,313
I know

463
00:37:58,513 --> 00:38:01,814
She's really frail, James.
Do you want me to postpone my trip?

464
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:03,441
There's another course later
in the year

465
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:05,543
It's only a couple of weeks.
You should go

466
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:07,053
Are you sure?
It's not that important

467
00:38:07,156 --> 00:38:09,853
It is important. I want you to go

468
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,018
Okay

469
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:14,123
It's going to be hard to
leave this place, James, but...

470
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,563
But you've still
got the London flat

471
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:20,531
You'll be nearer the hospital and you
can get much better crack in twon

472
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:25,272
Hey, you know
what the Monty Python boys say...

473
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:28,743
"Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition", I know

474
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:30,443
Exactly

475
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:31,980
...sorry, let me just...

476
00:38:33,183 --> 00:38:35,118
...Lydia's becoming
more and more demanding...

477
00:38:35,218 --> 00:38:37,049
and you, you feel bad because
Helen's working night and

478
00:38:37,153 --> 00:38:39,054
day to keep the money coming in

479
00:38:39,556 --> 00:38:42,549
But you've asked Helen to come on
a research trip to Dorset with you...

480
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:47,787
knowing that she wouldn't be
able to... to cover up the fact...

481
00:38:48,365 --> 00:38:50,265
that you're really taking Lydia
And, and despite the fact that...

482
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:53,303
Lydia gave you an 'out' on
the phone, which you didn't take...

483
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:54,870
...you are having a moral dilemma

484
00:38:55,472 --> 00:38:58,135
Gerry... you are
a morality free zone

485
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:00,710
If I had no morals,
would I be discussing it?

486
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:04,748
Whose idea was this trip...
yours or Lydia's?

487
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:09,147
You wanna get out
of this Lydia thing

488
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:10,948
I foresee problems

489
00:39:11,354 --> 00:39:14,256
And I wouldn't mind betting you're talking
to yourself in the mirror again

490
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:17,558
Very bad sign

491
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:20,223
You've no compassion... None

492
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,164
Why do I bother confiding in you?

493
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:26,202
I'm your mate. I'm here to help you

494
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:33,144
I'm here to help you

495
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:40,680
Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition!

496
00:39:40,785 --> 00:39:43,118
Our chief weapon is surprise

497
00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:43,619
Surprise and fear.
Fear and surprise

498
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:47,090
Our two, two chief weapons
are surprise and fear

499
00:39:47,191 --> 00:39:48,784
And a ruthless efficiency.
Our three...

500
00:39:48,893 --> 00:39:51,920
...three main weapons are fear,
surprise and a ruthless efficiency

501
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:53,895
I'll come in again

502
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:58,661
Here we go

503
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,707
Pass me your plate

504
00:40:02,807 --> 00:40:04,799
How do you do, Nigel?
Very nice to meet you

505
00:40:07,512 --> 00:40:09,447
You all right?

506
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:16,084
I am deadly serious

507
00:40:16,188 --> 00:40:18,521
Oh, just set up my own PR company?

508
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,149
Yeah, well, why not?

509
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:23,093
You've got the experience...
the know-how, the contacts

510
00:40:23,895 --> 00:40:25,659
You want to spend the rest of
your life working for other people?

511
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,456
Hey, what's the worst
that could possibly happen?

512
00:40:29,034 --> 00:40:32,334
Um, I could fail miserably
and look like a complete tosser

513
00:40:32,437 --> 00:40:34,531
Exactly, so what is there
to worry about?

514
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:44,781
I had a really nice time, James

515
00:40:44,883 --> 00:40:48,012
Did you? Oh, shit. Sorry,
that's against the rules, isn't it?

516
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,988
Yes, it is, so just bear that
in mind in the future, would you?

517
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:53,217
I'm getting over a major break-up

518
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,693
Yeah, sorry... Won't happen again

519
00:41:02,902 --> 00:41:04,028
Goodnight, Helen

520
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:11,043
Hey... you know everything happens
for the best

521
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:13,305
You'll never know if you don't try

522
00:41:13,413 --> 00:41:16,611
Wear something warm on Saturday...
Can get cold on the river

523
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:18,476
Take care

524
00:41:36,636 --> 00:41:38,867
So, what other ideas has James
run by you?

525
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:42,671
Anna, don't do that. Don't do
'desperate mother' acting with me

526
00:41:42,776 --> 00:41:45,109
He's a friend. Okay? A friend

527
00:41:49,683 --> 00:41:51,515
not remotely in him
No

528
00:41:52,286 --> 00:41:55,188
So how come last night was the first night
since you've been here... you didn't ask

529
00:41:55,288 --> 00:41:57,223
if anyone had called
the second you walked in the door?

530
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:45,673
You're sorry?

531
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:49,576
You're sorry that four of the staff
here have been cut down... with food poisoning

532
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:51,704
after eating your sandwiches?

533
00:42:52,414 --> 00:42:53,882
And before you speak, yes...

534
00:42:53,982 --> 00:42:57,544
...they all had the same sandwiches
and the same symptoms at the same time

535
00:42:58,586 --> 00:43:00,612
Are you trained
in the catering trade, may I ask?

536
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:03,357
No, actually I worked in PR
but I...

537
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:07,122
Well, you're not doing a particularly good
PR job this morning, are you?

538
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:11,299
Luckily for you I've convinced my
colleagues not to take the matter any further

539
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:13,231
This time

540
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:15,963
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have five people's work to do

541
00:43:18,374 --> 00:43:19,432
Sorry?

542
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:22,375
Helen has been delivering
sandwiches to your office?

543
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:25,141
Yes... And today I had reason
to summon her

544
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:28,049
Well I made up a reason,
to be brutally honest

545
00:43:29,217 --> 00:43:32,450
She's quite pretty in a British
horsey sort of way, isn't she?

546
00:43:33,688 --> 00:43:35,156
Lydia... what are you playing at?

547
00:43:35,257 --> 00:43:37,818
Have you gone raving mad?
She's not bloody stupid, you know

548
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:42,924
I wanted to see what the woman
you ditched me for is like

549
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:46,594
Now, now, now, now wait a sec.
Now I did not ditch you for...

550
00:43:46,702 --> 00:43:48,034
I mean, you went back
to America for...

551
00:43:48,137 --> 00:43:52,269
I wanted to see what this girl you seem
to have no intention of leaving...

552
00:43:52,374 --> 00:43:56,813
despite the occasional pre-orgasmic
suggestion that you are...

553
00:43:56,912 --> 00:43:59,245
...has that is so unleavable

554
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:02,477
And I have to say that I ended our
brief meeting at a bit of a loss

555
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:05,044
Now, Lydia, don't talk like this.
Now it sounds ugly

556
00:44:05,154 --> 00:44:08,853
Now I've told you before,
I cannot leave Helen for... for...

557
00:44:10,794 --> 00:44:11,761
you know

558
00:44:11,861 --> 00:44:12,886
For me?

559
00:44:15,698 --> 00:44:17,792
Is that what
you're trying say?

560
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:21,163
You can't leave her for me?

561
00:44:22,072 --> 00:44:24,064
Well, you haven't said
you wanted that, have you?

562
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:26,234
Gerry, I'm a woman

563
00:44:26,343 --> 00:44:28,642
We don't say what we want.

564
00:44:28,745 --> 00:44:31,681
But we reserve the right to
be pissed off if we don't get it

565
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:34,480
That's what makes us so fascinating

566
00:44:34,584 --> 00:44:36,347
And not a little bit scary

567
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:39,948
Hello?

568
00:44:40,056 --> 00:44:42,924
Ah, Gerald Flannigan, at last

569
00:44:43,026 --> 00:44:45,359
This is your kindly
Uncle Russell here

570
00:44:46,563 --> 00:44:47,393
Listen...

571
00:44:47,497 --> 00:44:50,957
...wherever you were tonight as if
we need to ask, you weren't with me

572
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:52,831
Helen called here looking for you

573
00:44:52,937 --> 00:44:54,097
Okay

574
00:44:54,204 --> 00:44:55,001
Yeah, all right

575
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:56,403
Okay, thanks, mate. Bye

576
00:44:57,874 --> 00:45:00,742
Oh, thank God, I was so worried.
Where have you been?

577
00:45:01,612 --> 00:45:04,707
I went to Anna's.
I needed to see a friendly face

578
00:45:06,017 --> 00:45:07,712
I've had a horrible day

579
00:45:07,819 --> 00:45:11,221
I met Cruella de Ville's
less nice sister this morning...

580
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:12,984
...she completely deflated me

581
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,786
I know

582
00:45:14,892 --> 00:45:16,884
How do you know?

583
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:20,522
Oh, no, I mean I can tell.
Jesus, you look terrible

584
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:29,332
Where were you earlier?
I really needed to talk to you

585
00:45:30,342 --> 00:45:34,508
Oh, I had some stuff to read up on
so I went to the library

586
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:37,545
God, you're always at the library

587
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,976
I'm sich of waiting on tables

588
00:45:41,386 --> 00:45:44,288
I know when you finish the book
we'll be millionaires but...

589
00:45:46,091 --> 00:45:47,820
...when are you going to finish it?

590
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,151
I'm going to finish it
very soon, Helen

591
00:45:53,332 --> 00:45:54,630
Very soon

592
00:45:57,636 --> 00:46:00,834
Helen, there's something
I want to tell you

593
00:46:02,207 --> 00:46:03,971
I need to tell you

594
00:46:05,244 --> 00:46:10,617
Er... it's a little bit to do
with the... brandy glass and, er...

595
00:46:10,716 --> 00:46:13,481
...a little bit to do with
that woman... you met today

596
00:46:14,687 --> 00:46:18,624
Only... please let me finish
before you say anything

597
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:21,421
Okay?

598
00:46:25,764 --> 00:46:26,857
Helen?

599
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:32,164
Bollocks

600
00:46:32,872 --> 00:46:35,398
Come on, James!

601
00:46:37,644 --> 00:46:39,408
Come on, come on!

602
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:43,949
Come on, come on!

603
00:47:04,038 --> 00:47:05,369
That's really weird

604
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,066
I knew there'd be a boat race going
by with purple and white shirts

605
00:47:09,475 --> 00:47:10,875
Sorry?

606
00:47:10,978 --> 00:47:13,209
Why hasn't he asked you to
go with him to Dorset?

607
00:47:13,314 --> 00:47:15,340
He has... I've got to work

608
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:18,419
Anyway it'll be good for him
to get away. We need a bit of space

609
00:47:20,787 --> 00:47:22,779
Anna, can I ask you
a daft question?

610
00:47:23,356 --> 00:47:26,657
Did you drop a glass
in the laundry basket at our party?

611
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,257
Sounds like a ridiculous thing
to do. It was almost certainly me

612
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:33,324
Are you okay?

613
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:34,924
Just going quietly mad

614
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:36,263
Thank God for that. I was worried

615
00:47:39,306 --> 00:47:41,537
Faster

616
00:47:47,481 --> 00:47:49,473
And to my left...

617
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:51,575
And to my right...

618
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:53,847
And with my left...

619
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,582
And with my right...

620
00:47:56,357 --> 00:47:59,156
And with the 'head'...

621
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:06,565
Father Abraham 'head'
had seven sons, head', '¡head'

622
00:48:06,668 --> 00:48:10,503
Seven sons had
Father Abraham 'head'

623
00:48:12,506 --> 00:48:14,475
Are you sure
it's just writer's block?

624
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:16,910
I mean, you seem so distant

625
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,279
I'm here, Gerry, if you need
to talk to me about anything

626
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:24,213
Hey, that's Helen in there

627
00:48:28,523 --> 00:48:29,855
Look, she's got blonde hair

628
00:48:31,226 --> 00:48:34,788
There's loads of them... having some
kind of sponsored epileptic fit

629
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:40,561
Lydia

630
00:48:41,603 --> 00:48:44,199
Maybe it isn't writer's block
at all, Gerry

631
00:48:45,306 --> 00:48:47,332
Maybe it's Helen block

632
00:48:48,276 --> 00:48:54,309
I don't want to hear about Helen.
I don't care about Helen

633
00:48:57,653 --> 00:49:02,024
The trouble is...
you do quite clearly

634
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,922
I just thought of
a great finish for your book!

635
00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:10,598
The End!

636
00:49:24,748 --> 00:49:26,580
Yes, you are, Clive

637
00:49:26,683 --> 00:49:29,346
He's opening his first restaurant
in six days...

638
00:49:29,453 --> 00:49:31,752
...and he's completely disorganised

639
00:49:31,855 --> 00:49:36,351
Well, you know at my old company we had 'wars '
getting Pierre Claude's restaurant open

640
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,622
You did Pierre Claude?

641
00:49:39,495 --> 00:49:43,058
Mmm
Er, he's my hero. You did his launch?

642
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:46,530
Well I heard that was a really
classy do. People went on about it

643
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:49,466
I mean, six days is...

644
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,009
...could I come down
and take a look?

645
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:55,408
I can't promise anything stupendous

646
00:49:55,511 --> 00:49:58,914
Sure, yeah. Yeah, no problem...
You're kidding?

647
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:00,678
Yeah, come down

648
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:03,276
Pierre Claude? Oh, wow!

649
00:50:07,757 --> 00:50:11,194
You're very thoughtful, James.
You give out an incredible amount

650
00:50:11,962 --> 00:50:15,524
Oh, you're the same.
You encouraged me today

651
00:50:15,632 --> 00:50:17,760
I saw you jumping up
and down like a mad thing

652
00:50:19,002 --> 00:50:20,334
Spurred me on

653
00:50:23,573 --> 00:50:26,942
I love this bridge. My great
grandfather helped to build it

654
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:32,644
I often come and... stand on it
when I want to, um...

655
00:50:34,252 --> 00:50:35,948
Build a bridge?

656
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:38,187
I'm sorry

657
00:50:46,831 --> 00:50:48,026
Oh God, James, don't

658
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,601
Oh... I'm sorry. I, I...

659
00:50:52,336 --> 00:50:57,105
...I know this is an ideal sort
of kissing moment...

660
00:50:57,208 --> 00:51:00,304
...you know, night, moon, boat,
water lapping...

661
00:51:00,879 --> 00:51:03,940
...you know, it's, um... i
t's perfect and I'm...

662
00:51:04,048 --> 00:51:07,383
...I'm not feeling that
it would be nice...

663
00:51:07,486 --> 00:51:10,115
...but I don't really know anything
about you and I'm...

664
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,617
...I'm still on the rebound

665
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:16,456
Oh God, I hate that word but I am

666
00:51:16,562 --> 00:51:18,724
Ah, who isn't? Everyone is

667
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,959
I'm on the rebound myself...
in a way...

668
00:51:24,402 --> 00:51:26,564
So, who are you
on the rebound from?

669
00:51:27,906 --> 00:51:29,898
A girl called Pamela

670
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:32,910
My whole life pivots around.
Pam and I breaking up

671
00:51:33,011 --> 00:51:34,138
When was that?

672
00:51:34,246 --> 00:51:36,272
1973, we were eight

673
00:51:37,683 --> 00:51:39,948
I bloody loved that woman

674
00:51:40,052 --> 00:51:43,922
No warning, just up gone...
left me for somebody else

675
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:45,717
Who?

676
00:51:45,824 --> 00:51:48,020
Gary Glitter!
The cow

677
00:51:48,126 --> 00:51:51,723
Gary Glitter, for crying out loud!

678
00:51:52,465 --> 00:51:56,870
I mean all my friends were being left for
Donny Osmond or David Cassidy or...

679
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,201
I could have come to
terms with that, given time

680
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:03,003
But Gary. Oh she wanted
to 'touch him there, yeah'

681
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:05,172
You know?

682
00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:07,474
Well, I went to pieces
as you can imagine

683
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,015
And there was no 'junior Prozac'
to see me through so...

684
00:52:22,061 --> 00:52:23,996
So I, er, I, um...

685
00:52:24,097 --> 00:52:25,064
I kissed you

686
00:52:25,165 --> 00:52:27,258
Yeah, yeah, I spotted that too

687
00:52:27,368 --> 00:52:29,268
You weren't gonna do that

688
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:34,837
Um, hmm... would you mind, um...
just putting that down to

689
00:52:34,941 --> 00:52:37,342
a momentary lapse of,
um, concentration?

690
00:52:37,977 --> 00:52:39,070
Is that what it was?

691
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:40,544
No

692
00:52:40,647 --> 00:52:43,243
Y-yes, I don't... Oh, help

693
00:52:49,522 --> 00:52:53,585
I, I don't want to be a confusion
in your life, Helen. I don't truly

694
00:52:53,893 --> 00:52:57,490
But something's happened to me
since I've met you and...

695
00:52:58,398 --> 00:53:02,530
...that I wasn't expecting and...
and I don't really...

696
00:53:03,904 --> 00:53:06,339
...well, well wasn't expecting

697
00:53:06,874 --> 00:53:09,435
Repetition of expecting.
Must buy a thesaurus

698
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:10,476
Anyway, I...

699
00:54:19,782 --> 00:54:22,308
You did remember to take a full page
ad in 'Adulterer's Weekly'? Jesus!

700
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:29,752
Lydia, get in the car, will you?

701
00:54:29,858 --> 00:54:32,123
How many years have you been going
to paint that stain off?

702
00:55:57,949 --> 00:55:59,246
He didn't even pay the bill?
Of course not. What do you think?

703
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,819
Um I'm, I'm just... Would you excuse me,
please? I've just remembered I, I'm...

704
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,486
What do you mean you
want to see me?

705
00:56:08,593 --> 00:56:12,121
Jesus Christ, Gerry, what...
How did you get in?

706
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:15,668
One of the waiters is,
is a, a friend of Russell's

707
00:56:15,766 --> 00:56:17,962
He got me a ticket.
It's a great do, Helen

708
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:20,231
I, I hear your company's
really taken off...

709
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:23,536
Gerry, you can't
just turn up like this

710
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:25,269
This is a really important nights
for me

711
00:56:25,376 --> 00:56:26,969
Yes, I can, Helen

712
00:56:27,078 --> 00:56:31,176
I can 'just turn up'. It, it's the most
important 'just turn up' I've ever done

713
00:56:31,782 --> 00:56:33,478
Oh God. We, we can't talk in here

714
00:56:40,892 --> 00:56:44,159
We've been through too much just
to drop this. Haven't we? Surely

715
00:56:48,399 --> 00:56:49,492
Helen...

716
00:56:50,002 --> 00:56:51,595
...please, look at me

717
00:56:54,573 --> 00:56:55,632
I'm sorry

718
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,569
Really sorry

719
00:57:00,946 --> 00:57:03,108
You're too good not to fight for.
The last...

720
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:05,878
Oh God, Gerry,
don't talk about fight. I...

721
00:57:12,624 --> 00:57:14,559
Good looking bloke

722
00:57:15,328 --> 00:57:16,761
Are you seeing him?
Er...

723
00:57:16,862 --> 00:57:19,799
I, I'm sorry,
it's not my place to ask

724
00:57:22,402 --> 00:57:23,835
Is that him?

725
00:57:23,936 --> 00:57:25,336
Guess so

726
00:57:26,305 --> 00:57:27,671
Does she know about Claudia?

727
00:57:27,773 --> 00:57:28,763
No

728
00:57:29,609 --> 00:57:31,134
I really like her, Clive

729
00:57:32,045 --> 00:57:34,207
I'm confused.
I feel a bit lost suddenly

730
00:57:35,715 --> 00:57:38,310
Gerry, I really have to
go back inside

731
00:57:38,418 --> 00:57:39,909
Will you come and see me, Helen?

732
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:45,757
Please, Helen, there's so much
more I want to say. I miss you

733
00:57:48,061 --> 00:57:49,791
Will you come and see me?

734
00:57:52,265 --> 00:57:53,494
Please, Helen

735
00:57:54,534 --> 00:57:55,296
I'll go.

736
00:57:57,838 --> 00:57:59,237
Thanks for listening. I...

737
00:58:00,406 --> 00:58:01,566
...I'm really proud of you

738
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:27,464
Are you okay?

739
00:58:27,568 --> 00:58:30,299
Yes. Just a bit dizzy

740
00:58:30,404 --> 00:58:31,895
Too much champagne

741
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:45,078
Oh, sorry

742
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,556
Bye now

743
00:58:54,229 --> 00:58:56,460
Hey... It's official... I love you

744
00:58:58,033 --> 00:59:00,559
Thank you. You're...
you're a genius. I'm ecstatic

745
00:59:01,535 --> 00:59:03,163
Have you, er, have you seen James?

746
00:59:03,904 --> 00:59:07,501
Yeah. Yeah, he had to go...
early start. He apologised

747
00:59:27,462 --> 00:59:30,990
Business trip... Newcastle
or something. I didn't want to pry

748
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,726
His secretary
wasn't very forthcoming

749
00:59:34,502 --> 00:59:35,628
D'you believe he's away?

750
00:59:35,737 --> 00:59:36,898
Don't know

751
00:59:37,005 --> 00:59:38,371
Or do you think
he's just avoiding you?

752
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:39,133
I don't know

753
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,172
Did you leave a message?

754
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:40,901
No

755
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:44,378
D'you think maybe you should have?
Did he actually see Gerry kiss you?

756
00:59:44,479 --> 00:59:45,640
I don't know

757
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,081
D'you think he might be hoping you've called
and not known that you have?

758
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:49,777
I mean... did you not check
if he has a mobile?

759
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:52,377
Anna! Ease up, will you?
Bloody hell!

760
00:59:53,188 --> 00:59:55,988
They have less questions
than this on 'Jeopardy'

761
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,585
I was nervous. I wanted to
get off the phone. I felt awkward

762
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:03,194
Well, it's such a piddly little thing.
It's hardly worth him getting up tight about

763
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,666
Oh, Gerry called by the way

764
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:09,401
Terrific. That's just...

765
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,667
Two months ago I want Gerry
to come round, James comes round

766
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,006
Now I want James to call,
Gerry calls

767
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,314
It was the weirdest dream.
You were there

768
01:00:28,991 --> 01:00:32,622
And you had a funny mask
over your face...

769
01:00:32,728 --> 01:00:36,564
...and you had something that you needed
to tell me but you couldn't say it

770
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:40,537
Well that does it, I'm afraid. I'm, er,
taking away your class one drugs for a week

771
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:46,870
Anyway... um... there's something
else I wanted to tell you

772
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,579
I fainted at work the other night

773
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,912
Oh, sweetheart. Are you okay?

774
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:59,320
Yes, but I don't normally faint
so I, um...

775
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,355
What was that?

776
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,953
I don't know. The people next door are plainly
engaged in some bizarre sexual ritual

777
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:10,228
I may pop in later
and introduce myself

778
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:12,861
What were you saying?

779
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,460
Anyway...

780
01:01:14,572 --> 01:01:17,838
...I don't normally faint
so I was a little curious...

781
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:24,976
Oh shit...

782
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:28,851
...I stubbed my foot
on the side of the shagging bath

783
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:31,317
God, sounds horrific

784
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,616
I know

785
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:34,986
Ssshhh!
Anyway...

786
01:01:38,596 --> 01:01:40,393
Listen, there,
there's the landlady.

787
01:01:40,498 --> 01:01:41,523
She keeps coming up with these,
er... corned beef sandwiches

788
01:01:41,632 --> 01:01:44,898
Look I, I'll phone you back when, er,
world war twelve has stopped for tea. Okay

789
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:46,402
Okay, bye

790
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:51,838
So I did a test and it turns out
that I'm pregnant

791
01:01:54,279 --> 01:01:56,110
I just though you might
like to know

792
01:01:59,151 --> 01:02:02,053
Have you gone completely insane?

793
01:02:02,153 --> 01:02:03,314
What are you trying to do?

794
01:02:03,422 --> 01:02:06,324
What do you mean 'what am I trying
to do'? I think I've broke my toe

795
01:02:06,425 --> 01:02:11,091
Lydia, I'm on the pissing phone
to Helen, for goodness sake

796
01:02:12,164 --> 01:02:14,827
In case you've forgotten,
she doesn't know you're here

797
01:02:15,334 --> 01:02:18,532
She thinks I'm on a research
trip... along. Remember?

798
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:20,468
I remeber

799
01:02:21,473 --> 01:02:23,840
Don't worry, I remeber.
It's pretty hard to forget

800
01:02:23,942 --> 01:02:25,877
So what are you trying to do? Huh?!

801
01:02:26,411 --> 01:02:30,577
Coming in here... screeching the
place down when I'm on the phone

802
01:02:31,783 --> 01:02:33,411
Don't you know, Gerry?

803
01:02:34,554 --> 01:02:37,353
Don't you know
what I am trying to do?!

804
01:02:38,724 --> 01:02:41,854
I am trying to
be your girlfriend, Gerry

805
01:02:42,561 --> 01:02:44,723
I am trying to win you back!

806
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:49,792
It's fairly simple. I am standing
on the platform at Limbo Central...

807
01:02:49,902 --> 01:02:53,135
...with my heart and soul packed
in my suitcase...

808
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:57,735
...waiting for the Gerry fucking
Express to roll in...

809
01:02:57,844 --> 01:03:01,543
...and tell me that my ticket
is still valid, that I may reboard the train

810
01:03:02,649 --> 01:03:08,613
Only the station announcer keeps coming on
and telling me that my train has been delayed

811
01:03:08,721 --> 01:03:14,059
...as the driver has suffered a major
panic attack in Indecision City!

812
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,131
"We suggest you take the bus!"

813
01:03:17,697 --> 01:03:20,667
That's what I am trying to do,
you cripple!

814
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:34,645
Except it's quite clear...

815
01:03:35,982 --> 01:03:38,679
...that that is
never going to happen

816
01:03:40,286 --> 01:03:41,720
Is it?

817
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:45,119
No reply

818
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:48,017
Perfect

819
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:52,924
So I... I'm not waiting
any more, Gerry

820
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:58,762
I am cashing my ticket in.
I am taking that bus

821
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,937
Oh God...

822
01:04:01,442 --> 01:04:04,935
I tell all my friends
"never go back"

823
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:08,081
Look at me, I must be crazy

824
01:04:09,316 --> 01:04:11,114
Don't phone me for a while

825
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:18,820
Ow! Oh!
No... don't phone me at all!

826
01:04:18,926 --> 01:04:19,951
Ever!

827
01:04:21,362 --> 01:04:22,921
It's over!

828
01:04:24,332 --> 01:04:26,096
Again!

829
01:04:28,203 --> 01:04:31,173
I've done it, Russell.
I've bloody done it!

830
01:04:31,706 --> 01:04:33,698
EXcellent. Congratulations.
Done what?

831
01:04:33,808 --> 01:04:35,071
I've finished it

832
01:04:35,176 --> 01:04:37,577
Oh, the book... Oh well, great,
mate, that's great

833
01:04:38,146 --> 01:04:40,115
Not the book, not the book, Russell

834
01:04:40,215 --> 01:04:42,207
I'm a novelist, I'm never gonna
finish the book...

835
01:04:42,317 --> 01:04:44,149
The affair!

836
01:04:44,252 --> 01:04:46,187
The affair!
The sordid affair with Lydia

837
01:04:46,287 --> 01:04:48,256
I've blown her out... in Dorset

838
01:04:48,356 --> 01:04:50,689
I was decisive but fair

839
01:04:50,792 --> 01:04:52,316
I've just got back

840
01:04:52,427 --> 01:04:55,125
Oh God, I feel like
I've got out of jail

841
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:59,190
No more deceit, no more I ying
to Helen. It was such a mistake

842
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,328
"Never go back", Russell.
But it's over

843
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:05,937
God, I can't tell you
it's such a good feeling

844
01:05:07,175 --> 01:05:10,613
Well, I'm, I'm very pleased.
How does she feel about it, Lydia?

845
01:05:11,347 --> 01:05:14,875
Well, you know, she's not jumping
through hoops obviously, I mean...

846
01:05:14,984 --> 01:05:18,352
...but, but it's the best thing by
far. By far and away the best thing

847
01:05:18,454 --> 01:05:20,753
I mean she, she knows that.
I mean, she will do when she...

848
01:05:21,857 --> 01:05:25,885
well, she was upsel I mean bit
farught, you know... obviously

849
01:05:25,994 --> 01:05:27,895
Oh God, oh God, oh God, I feel good

850
01:05:27,996 --> 01:05:31,229
I've got to go home. I wanna be home
before Helen comes back from work

851
01:05:35,771 --> 01:05:36,601
Er, no

852
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,675
Because you never buy me flowers
when you're meant to...

853
01:05:39,775 --> 01:05:41,640
...let alone
when you're not meant to

854
01:05:41,745 --> 01:05:43,110
So, yes, I'm a little suspicious

855
01:05:43,212 --> 01:05:45,374
I want to know what else you've
been doing that you're not meant to

856
01:05:45,481 --> 01:05:46,881
Wait, hang on

857
01:05:46,982 --> 01:05:50,441
Let me get this straight
'cause this is just about brilliant

858
01:05:50,553 --> 01:05:52,681
I buy you flowers on a whim in a...

859
01:05:52,788 --> 01:05:57,592
in a, in a fit of, of,
of, um, of romance but...

860
01:05:58,161 --> 01:05:59,823
See... you couldn't
even think of the word

861
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:02,957
But instead of being, of being grateful,
instead of being 'romanced'...

862
01:06:03,066 --> 01:06:08,335
...you're instantly convinced
that I'm ensconced in some decrepit tacky,

863
01:06:08,437 --> 01:06:11,067
underhand clandestine affair!

864
01:06:11,741 --> 01:06:13,073
In a nutshell

865
01:06:24,421 --> 01:06:25,615
Gerry?

866
01:06:28,925 --> 01:06:30,290
Are you back?

867
01:06:31,962 --> 01:06:33,954
I missed you so I came home early
to see you

868
01:06:34,564 --> 01:06:35,532
God

869
01:06:38,602 --> 01:06:39,900
What are they?

870
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,362
Well they're flowers

871
01:06:43,173 --> 01:06:44,402
For you. Um...

872
01:06:45,775 --> 01:06:47,073
...d'you not like them?

873
01:06:48,645 --> 01:06:52,378
That image of her sitting
on top of you, oh God, I...

874
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:54,975
...I, I really don't know
why I agreed to come

875
01:06:55,085 --> 01:06:57,783
Please stop, Gerry, don't, I,
I don't want you to touch me

876
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,153
I'm, I'm sorry. Um, um, don't go

877
01:07:00,858 --> 01:07:04,557
Please try and...
put her out of your mind

878
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,699
She's, she's out of mine

879
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:09,858
It's finished... over

880
01:07:09,967 --> 01:07:11,993
I made a mistake. Such a big...
big mistake and I'm sorry

881
01:07:12,103 --> 01:07:14,197
I'm truly, truly sorry

882
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:19,907
I mean this new bloke, this James
Hammerton that you're seeing...

883
01:07:20,012 --> 01:07:22,311
...does he not make mistakes?

884
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:24,211
How do y ouknow his name?

885
01:07:24,315 --> 01:07:27,047
A mate of Russell's works
at the restaurant

886
01:07:27,152 --> 01:07:31,181
They're... mutual friends. I... I mean,
it's not especially important

887
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:34,624
Well I don't want to talk about James Hammerton
or anyone else. I have to go

888
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:37,353
Oh, by the, by the way I've, er...

889
01:07:39,198 --> 01:07:40,689
...I've stopped writing the book

890
01:07:43,335 --> 01:07:48,297
Helen... the truth is
I can't write without you

891
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:50,704
I can't do anything without you

892
01:07:53,344 --> 01:07:55,176
I want you to
come back to me, Helen

893
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:00,012
We were so good together

894
01:08:01,486 --> 01:08:03,512
Remeber, remember
how good we are together?

895
01:08:07,492 --> 01:08:09,188
Sorry... Just wait

896
01:08:13,065 --> 01:08:13,498
Yeah?

897
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,502
I'm late, Gerry... Four days.
I'm never late

898
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:20,037
Oh, Russell. Er, look, hi

899
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:21,970
Er, look, mate. Look, er, can I ring you
back in a few minutes, yeah?

900
01:08:22,074 --> 01:08:24,806
Yeah... Yeah, okay. Okay.
Thanks, mate, cheers. Bye

901
01:08:25,812 --> 01:08:27,007
It's, er... Russell

902
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,979
I'm, I'm dying for the loo

903
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:53,398
Telephone number 01714443184

904
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:55,566
To return the call press three

905
01:09:00,614 --> 01:09:02,981
Why are you pretending I'm Russell?
You know I hate that

906
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,416
What's going on?

907
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:08,752
Gerry, answer me. Who's there?

908
01:09:08,855 --> 01:09:11,324
It's Helen actually. We met once

909
01:09:11,424 --> 01:09:13,723
I interrupted you
faking your orgasm

910
01:09:13,827 --> 01:09:15,818
Sorry I can't be more specific

911
01:09:19,533 --> 01:09:21,126
You know what I was thinking?

912
01:09:22,368 --> 01:09:23,893
You're not going, are you?

913
01:09:24,338 --> 01:09:29,107
You wanker. You sad, sad wonker

914
01:09:31,278 --> 01:09:33,840
God, I feel like such a mug!

915
01:09:33,948 --> 01:09:36,349
The useless, no good...

916
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:39,443
...shagging, horrible,
despicable, I ying...

917
01:09:39,553 --> 01:09:42,148
...two-faced pissing, shagging...

918
01:09:42,256 --> 01:09:42,951
You said shagging

919
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:49,094
You know the worst bit?

920
01:09:50,231 --> 01:09:52,132
All I could think about was James

921
01:09:52,233 --> 01:09:55,499
I felt like I was being unfaithful
to James just by being there

922
01:09:56,638 --> 01:09:58,698
That sounds like the best bit.
And you were

923
01:09:58,807 --> 01:10:00,605
He didn't call, did he?

924
01:10:02,944 --> 01:10:04,536
That's nearly a week

925
01:10:06,448 --> 01:10:08,007
I think I've blown it.
I've blown it, haven't I?

926
01:10:09,416 --> 01:10:11,351
I blame British Telecom.
All this new technology

927
01:10:13,921 --> 01:10:17,188
This number if you want
to know who called...

928
01:10:17,292 --> 01:10:21,196
...another one if you don't
want them to know you called...

929
01:10:21,296 --> 01:10:24,789
...itemised bills, take away
the first number you thought of

930
01:10:24,899 --> 01:10:28,530
I mean they are single-handedly condemning
the average red-blooded Englishman...

931
01:10:28,636 --> 01:10:30,400
...to a life of terminal monogamy

932
01:10:30,505 --> 01:10:32,667
What are they after?
The Nobel Peace Prize?

933
01:10:33,475 --> 01:10:34,875
And Lydia might be pregnant

934
01:10:41,484 --> 01:10:44,511
Oh no more, please...
I can't take it

935
01:10:46,188 --> 01:10:48,157
Oh this is terrific stuff

936
01:10:48,591 --> 01:10:51,288
I must say, being with you makes
the wait for the next episode of

937
01:10:51,393 --> 01:10:53,555
'Seinfeld' much easier to bear

938
01:10:53,662 --> 01:10:56,291
I didn't reckon on things
turning out this way

939
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:00,131
Everything's a cock up.
What's going on?

940
01:11:00,769 --> 01:11:03,706
Well... to use boxing parlance,
if I may... it's quite simple

941
01:11:04,473 --> 01:11:06,635
You've just lost

942
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,211
Are you sure? You've been a bit...

943
01:11:10,946 --> 01:11:13,609
...I don't know, a bit distant
since I've got back

944
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:15,184
I know

945
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:17,316
Well, okay...
there are a couple of things.

946
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,446
Which one do you want
to hear first?

947
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:21,522
I don't mind

948
01:11:21,725 --> 01:11:25,493
Well the 'small'thing is that
I've got an interview for a job

949
01:11:25,595 --> 01:11:27,222
A PR job, a proper one

950
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:31,293
International company
opening up in London

951
01:11:32,001 --> 01:11:36,337
Chairwoman herself called, said she
had heard a lot about me and...

952
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:39,535
she's invited me to her apartment
tomorrow evening for a serious chat

953
01:11:41,378 --> 01:11:42,675
Jesus Christ!

954
01:11:44,681 --> 01:11:45,478
What?

955
01:11:45,582 --> 01:11:51,580
Jesus Christ, I mean that's... that's
not a small thing, that's... that's huge

956
01:11:51,688 --> 01:11:54,989
I mean it's... I mean it's... it's brilliant.
I mean that's the best

957
01:11:55,091 --> 01:11:56,719
Is the blind buggered again?

958
01:11:56,828 --> 01:11:58,523
No. Er... no

959
01:11:58,628 --> 01:12:00,096
Well, I...

960
01:12:08,206 --> 01:12:09,230
Are you all right?

961
01:12:09,339 --> 01:12:13,744
Yeah, no, I'm fine, darling.
My sweetheart, that's great, it's tremendous

962
01:12:13,844 --> 01:12:15,278
I'm thrilled. I'm so thrill...

963
01:12:16,246 --> 01:12:17,009
Hello?

964
01:12:17,114 --> 01:12:18,741
I really need to talk to you

965
01:12:20,084 --> 01:12:21,177
Hi, Russ. How are you?

966
01:12:21,285 --> 01:12:25,222
Come by my apartment tomorrow night
at eight. It's important

967
01:12:26,057 --> 01:12:29,516
Ah, really, mate. No, what a drag

968
01:12:29,627 --> 01:12:30,925
Oh no, yeah. Okay, yeah, sure.
Sure, sure, yeah

969
01:12:31,028 --> 01:12:33,190
Yeah, yeah, I'll help you

970
01:12:33,297 --> 01:12:34,765
Yeah, yeah, cheers, mate.
Cheers. Bye

971
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:38,098
It's Russell's family
is descending unannounced

972
01:12:38,402 --> 01:12:40,394
Yeah, he wants me to, er,
go round tomorrow evening and,

973
01:12:40,505 --> 01:12:43,704
er... help him clear out,
er, his spare room

974
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,372
Er, right. Okay. So...

975
01:12:53,018 --> 01:12:55,283
Sorry, what was the other thing
you wanted to tell me?

976
01:12:57,089 --> 01:12:58,920
Doesn't matter. It's not important

977
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,009
Hammerton Enterprises

978
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,525
Rachael, I'm going out to the shops

979
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,690
Can I get you anything?
No thanks

980
01:13:39,365 --> 01:13:40,696
Are you okay?

981
01:13:40,799 --> 01:13:42,597
Yes

982
01:13:43,635 --> 01:13:45,831
Yes. Yes, I'm fine

983
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:49,432
I just... you know, I go to
the shops, just I'll be, um...

984
01:14:25,478 --> 01:14:26,707
Sorry

985
01:14:29,649 --> 01:14:31,277
Hello!
Hi. Hi Hi

986
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,685
How... how are you?

987
01:14:34,787 --> 01:14:36,915
I'm... I'm great

988
01:14:37,023 --> 01:14:38,491
Er, how are you?

989
01:14:38,592 --> 01:14:40,959
Sorry, you're great

990
01:14:45,265 --> 01:14:46,163
Business lunch?

991
01:14:46,266 --> 01:14:48,257
Yeah, just a chat, you know

992
01:14:49,036 --> 01:14:50,503
Well my office
is just round the corner

993
01:14:50,603 --> 01:14:55,008
I know. Um... I, I, I thought
you were away on business

994
01:14:55,108 --> 01:14:58,511
Yeah, I was. I just, I, um,
got back last night as a matter of, er

995
01:15:01,682 --> 01:15:04,482
Helen, look, please
don't think that I, that I...

996
01:15:05,219 --> 01:15:07,711
Ah... it's okay, I...
I haven't thought

997
01:15:07,821 --> 01:15:10,154
I mean I, I,
I didn't think that or not

998
01:15:10,724 --> 01:15:13,957
No, I mean... don't think
that I have not called you

999
01:15:14,061 --> 01:15:16,053
I haven't 'not' called you

1000
01:15:16,163 --> 01:15:18,064
I mean, I don't... I don't mean
I haven't 'not' called you

1001
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:20,328
because that's a double negative...

1002
01:15:20,435 --> 01:15:21,960
...so as to say
that I 'have' called you

1003
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:23,264
When did you call?

1004
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:25,168
Er, well I, I didn't

1005
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:31,005
But I... I didn't 'not' call you in the way
that you might think I didn't call you

1006
01:15:31,112 --> 01:15:33,104
Oh dear

1007
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:37,608
I wanted to call you

1008
01:15:37,719 --> 01:15:40,314
I even did that dial all but the
last number thing and then not, er...

1009
01:15:41,856 --> 01:15:43,688
It's... ridiculous behaviour

1010
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:45,351
Totally

1011
01:15:46,628 --> 01:15:49,860
You see, I... I thought you still had to
deal with, with your other, er...

1012
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,431
Gerry?!

1013
01:15:52,534 --> 01:15:54,526
Well I don't know,
is that... yeah, if...

1014
01:15:54,636 --> 01:15:56,764
And I thought it was best
if I allowed youto...

1015
01:15:56,871 --> 01:15:59,306
Gerry is why you haven't called me?

1016
01:15:59,441 --> 01:16:03,470
Well, after Clive's party I didn't
want to just presume that you'd, that we had

1017
01:16:03,578 --> 01:16:06,811
You think I just go to bed with all successful
oarsmen that I come across?

1018
01:16:09,485 --> 01:16:11,147
Sorry, nervous humour

1019
01:16:12,088 --> 01:16:13,488
Well I hoped not

1020
01:16:17,325 --> 01:16:18,725
Sorry, excuse me

1021
01:16:20,296 --> 01:16:21,285
Hello?

1022
01:16:23,632 --> 01:16:24,998
Oh, I see. I'll, um...

1023
01:16:27,336 --> 01:16:29,965
...I'll come straight away.
Okay, thanks

1024
01:16:31,273 --> 01:16:33,799
My... mum had to go into hospital

1025
01:16:33,909 --> 01:16:36,470
She's had some tests done. The results
are through. I should, er, go

1026
01:16:38,247 --> 01:16:39,908
Do you want me to come with you?

1027
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:45,179
Yeah, that's really nice of you

1028
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,958
Er... well maybe, um...

1029
01:16:49,992 --> 01:16:52,587
I don't... she's quite frail
and I, and I don't know how she's gonna...

1030
01:16:52,695 --> 01:16:53,993
It's okay

1031
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:56,464
but, um... thanks

1032
01:16:59,969 --> 01:17:02,371
I'm, er, well some friends are
having dinner at Clive's tonight...

1033
01:17:02,472 --> 01:17:05,840
...if you're, if you're not doing
anything, you want to come along

1034
01:17:08,512 --> 01:17:09,878
Well some other time

1035
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,881
I'd love to if that's okay

1036
01:17:13,049 --> 01:17:18,615
Yeah, yeah. Of course, crikey,
it's, it's, it's very, very okay, yeah

1037
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:23,992
But well, at the risk of sounding
old-fashioned, I'll pick you up at eight

1038
01:17:24,094 --> 01:17:26,894
Is that a 'will' pick me up,
or a 'haven't, not, didn't, might'?

1039
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,434
Listen... don't worry
about your mum. She'll be okay

1040
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:35,362
Remember Monty Python

1041
01:17:37,574 --> 01:17:39,042
Well I'll see you later

1042
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:43,477
Bye

1043
01:17:55,326 --> 01:17:57,295
How are you?
Yeah, just... you know...

1044
01:18:01,532 --> 01:18:03,364
Is Gerry excited
about being a daddy?

1045
01:18:03,467 --> 01:18:05,299
I haven't told him yet

1046
01:18:05,403 --> 01:18:08,635
Never seems to
be the right moment somehow

1047
01:18:09,807 --> 01:18:12,038
Come on... let's celebrate
with a proper drink

1048
01:18:12,877 --> 01:18:14,470
Bloody marvellous idea

1049
01:18:16,315 --> 01:18:19,683
I really shouldn't in my condition
but I'm really going to

1050
01:18:19,784 --> 01:18:21,218
What have you got?

1051
01:18:22,186 --> 01:18:24,018
Um... brandy

1052
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:26,090
Oh, no, yuk. Makes me vomit

1053
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:46,505
Half day?

1054
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:53,940
James?!

1055
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:58,117
Since last night?

1056
01:20:00,888 --> 01:20:02,287
Sorry

1057
01:20:03,824 --> 01:20:05,086
You can't tell from one

1058
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:07,425
They can be inaccurate

1059
01:20:08,329 --> 01:20:09,762
I bought three packets

1060
01:20:10,364 --> 01:20:12,196
Two in a packet, that's six

1061
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,629
You can tell from six

1062
01:20:16,369 --> 01:20:17,632
What are you gonna do?

1063
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:26,440
Is James Hammerton in?

1064
01:20:26,547 --> 01:20:28,106
I'm afraid not

1065
01:20:28,215 --> 01:20:29,877
Um, do you know when he's due back?

1066
01:20:29,985 --> 01:20:33,319
I'm not sure. He's gone to visit his mother
in hospital with his wife

1067
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,680
Would you like to leave a message?

1068
01:20:37,558 --> 01:20:38,992
What?

1069
01:20:39,094 --> 01:20:41,154
Can I take a name and number?
Get him to call you

1070
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:46,997
Um... no, thank you

1071
01:21:34,015 --> 01:21:35,608
There's something
I want you to know

1072
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,715
Anna doesn't drink Brandy, Gerry,
it makes her vomit

1073
01:21:44,093 --> 01:21:46,221
and those glasses were
not used at the party

1074
01:21:46,328 --> 01:21:48,593
They only come out for
special dinners, you know that

1075
01:21:51,233 --> 01:21:53,794
Am I meant to immediately
get the reference here?

1076
01:21:54,636 --> 01:21:56,502
Are you having an affair?

1077
01:21:57,807 --> 01:21:59,799
Just tell me yes or no

1078
01:22:03,647 --> 01:22:06,116
No, I'm not

1079
01:22:15,559 --> 01:22:18,154
Helen, look into my eyes

1080
01:22:18,994 --> 01:22:21,726
I am not having an affair

1081
01:22:24,267 --> 01:22:25,495
I'm not

1082
01:22:30,574 --> 01:22:33,203
Well, I shouldn't have brought this up now,
I've got to go to my interview

1083
01:22:35,645 --> 01:22:37,079
We'll talk later

1084
01:22:39,115 --> 01:22:41,277
Are you going to be here
when I get back?

1085
01:22:41,384 --> 01:22:43,580
Yes. Of course

1086
01:22:47,324 --> 01:22:49,190
Helen... listen

1087
01:22:50,761 --> 01:22:52,353
Good luck, okay

1088
01:23:02,572 --> 01:23:03,334
Hello

1089
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,466
Hi, Anna, is Helen there?

1090
01:23:05,575 --> 01:23:07,339
You've got a damned nerve
phoning here

1091
01:23:07,978 --> 01:23:09,412
What?

1092
01:23:13,651 --> 01:23:16,849
Anna, please, just open the door.
I don't know what's going on

1093
01:23:17,855 --> 01:23:19,083
You dono't know what's going on?

1094
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:23,093
I'll tell you then. She saw you, James,
at the hospital. With your wife

1095
01:23:23,194 --> 01:23:24,992
You know, the one
with the wedding ring

1096
01:23:25,096 --> 01:23:26,085
What is it with you bloody men?
We're not just here...

1097
01:23:26,197 --> 01:23:28,428
Anna, let me see her. I can...
She's not here

1098
01:23:28,533 --> 01:23:30,023
Where is she?

1099
01:23:30,134 --> 01:23:31,500
What's it to you? I don't know

1100
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,468
Oh shit, shit. Bollocks

1101
01:23:35,207 --> 01:23:36,834
Oh God. You idiot!

1102
01:23:57,228 --> 01:23:58,719
Clive, you seen Helen?

1103
01:23:58,829 --> 01:24:00,627
No. Why?

1104
01:24:31,197 --> 01:24:32,357
Helen!

1105
01:24:35,234 --> 01:24:36,429
Helen!

1106
01:24:40,473 --> 01:24:43,409
Helen...
Helen, you've made a mistake

1107
01:24:43,508 --> 01:24:45,704
Oh, I am such an idiot.
Helen, look at me

1108
01:24:45,811 --> 01:24:46,779
Listen to me, please

1109
01:24:46,879 --> 01:24:51,341
No, you listen!
I never want to see you again

1110
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:55,019
I have been throught enough
for one year

1111
01:24:55,688 --> 01:24:59,284
I stupidly believed that here was
a man who was different from 'men '

1112
01:24:59,392 --> 01:25:01,987
But it is clear
that I made a mistake

1113
01:25:02,629 --> 01:25:06,396
Now please...
do me a favour and go away!

1114
01:25:07,367 --> 01:25:10,166
I am married, Helen,
but I am separated

1115
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:12,603
Walk away if you want
but take this with you

1116
01:25:12,705 --> 01:25:16,165
The woman you saw today was
the woman I married three years ago

1117
01:25:16,276 --> 01:25:19,371
We separated six months ago
and soon we'll be divorced

1118
01:25:21,147 --> 01:25:23,082
Nothing aggressive

1119
01:25:23,182 --> 01:25:24,844
I didn't tell you before because...

1120
01:25:26,486 --> 01:25:30,515
...I don't know why, I...
I have wanted to tell you so many times and

1121
01:25:31,792 --> 01:25:35,024
...and now you've found out
another way I wish I had told y ou

1122
01:25:36,964 --> 01:25:39,263
My mother is ill in hospital
as you know...

1123
01:25:39,366 --> 01:25:42,963
...and Claudia agreed to keep up the
pretence that we were okay still for my mum

1124
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:47,503
As a favour.
She's a very decent woman

1125
01:25:50,244 --> 01:25:51,940
Do you have a mum, Helen?

1126
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:57,380
Ten minutes, Lydia

1127
01:25:57,484 --> 01:25:59,976
And don't ever turn up at
my kitchen window again like that

1128
01:26:01,021 --> 01:26:03,582
It's over. You know?
You said it yourself

1129
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,990
I know. Sorry, I wasn't thinking

1130
01:26:06,093 --> 01:26:07,789
I just want to show you something

1131
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:17,271
Oh, Helen...

1132
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,799
if we are not gonna be together then let's
make sure it's for the right reason

1133
01:26:20,909 --> 01:26:23,674
And right now
there is no reason, none

1134
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:26,907
there is just confusion and
it can be erased in a split second

1135
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:32,185
Get that, would you?

1136
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:48,900
Of course, if you don't
want to keep it, darling...

1137
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:51,169
Who is it?

1138
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:54,333
Oh, hello again.
You're right on time

1139
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:59,211
Is this the truth, James?

1140
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,619
Permission to engage
the enemy, sir?

1141
01:27:19,869 --> 01:27:22,430
Thing is, I can't take
the interview just now

1142
01:27:22,538 --> 01:27:25,907
I'm discussing whether or not I'm
going to keep your boyfriend's baby

1143
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,338
James...

1144
01:27:31,648 --> 01:27:33,377
...there's something
I have to tell you

1145
01:27:34,017 --> 01:27:36,384
I'm so sorry you had to
hear it this way, Helen

1146
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:42,687
Er, I really should just phone
Anna and tell her I'm okay

1147
01:27:45,662 --> 01:27:46,993
Helen

1148
01:27:48,998 --> 01:27:50,466
I love you

1149
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,234
Helen, wait, please. Wait!

1150
01:27:52,769 --> 01:27:53,758
Let me go!

1151
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:55,132
Helen!
Helen!

1152
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:55,422
James... are you her husband?

1153
01:28:57,368 --> 01:28:59,599
Er... I will be.
We're, we're getting married

1154
01:29:00,638 --> 01:29:02,231
If I could have a quick word?

1155
01:29:04,509 --> 01:29:07,445
Helen has suffered major
internal injuries, James

1156
01:29:08,779 --> 01:29:11,340
Helen has lost her baby,
I'm afraid, Gerry

1157
01:29:12,718 --> 01:29:14,744
I'm afraid she's lost her baby

1158
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:18,150
You did know she was pregnant?

1159
01:29:19,658 --> 01:29:21,217
Did you know she was pregnant?

1160
01:29:25,697 --> 01:29:27,528
She will be okay though, won't she?

1161
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,999
She is, she is going to wake up,
isn't she, Doctor?

1162
01:30:22,822 --> 01:30:26,385
Helen, for some reason
I know you can hear me

1163
01:30:30,496 --> 01:30:33,398
I'm glad we got things
sorted out... tonight

1164
01:30:49,182 --> 01:30:51,913
I'm glad you caught
the train that day

1165
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,233
I am going to make you so happy

1166
01:31:14,274 --> 01:31:15,765
I promise

1167
01:31:26,787 --> 01:31:27,981
Helen?

1168
01:31:30,558 --> 01:31:32,116
Helen!

1169
01:31:35,497 --> 01:31:36,964
Helen!

1170
01:32:07,529 --> 01:32:09,054
Can you hear me?

1171
01:32:10,832 --> 01:32:12,629
Can you hear me, Helen?

1172
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:43,494
I'm sorry I'm late
Ah, no problem

1173
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:46,695
I'm pleased to say your mother's showing
some signs of improvement this morning

1174
01:32:46,802 --> 01:32:48,930
She's sitting up
and she's had a full breakfast

1175
01:32:49,038 --> 01:32:50,300
That's great

1176
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:12,951
Helen, I swear...

1177
01:33:19,502 --> 01:33:21,368
I'll do anything you want, Helen

1178
01:33:22,873 --> 01:33:24,170
Will you?

1179
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:28,577
In that case,
I want you to stand up...

1180
01:33:29,713 --> 01:33:31,409
...walk over to the door...

1181
01:33:32,015 --> 01:33:34,246
...open it... walk through it...

1182
01:33:35,152 --> 01:33:36,916
...then close it behind you

1183
01:33:53,271 --> 01:33:54,431
Ta-ta, mum

1184
01:34:01,378 --> 01:34:03,108
Call us if you have
any problems at all

1185
01:34:03,214 --> 01:34:04,078
Thank you

1186
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:07,448
You're very fortunate, Helen.
You had a lucky escape

1187
01:34:07,552 --> 01:34:09,418
Say that again

1188
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:11,619
Thank you

1189
01:35:01,939 --> 01:35:03,407
Thank you

1190
01:35:03,508 --> 01:35:06,501
Cheer up. You know
what the Monty Python boys say

1191
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:08,805
"Nobody expects
the spanish Inquisition"
