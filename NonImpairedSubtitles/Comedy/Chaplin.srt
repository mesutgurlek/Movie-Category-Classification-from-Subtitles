1
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:23,691
Come on, Charlie. Stop messing
about. We have to get down to it.

2
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:26,849
I just hope our friendship survives.

3
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:29,648
George, don't be so melodramatic.

4
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:31,808
It's your autobiography, Charlie.

5
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:34,287
And as your editor...

6
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:37,805
...I have to tell you
that parts of the manuscript...

7
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:41,564
...are vague, at best.
For instance, your mother.

8
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:46,842
When did she first lose control?
We need to know those facts.

9
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:48,761
It's hard to say.

10
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:51,640
She could be so wonderful.

11
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,559
On her good days.

12
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:09,794
You are my honey, honeysuckle.

13
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:19,950
I'd like to sip the honey
from those red lips.

14
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,389
I love you dearly.

15
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:27,467
And I want you to love me.

16
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:30,906
You are...

17
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,704
You are...

18
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,743
Come on, love!

19
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:40,423
Get on with it!

20
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:44,741
Get off, you silly cow!

21
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,420
Come on, Mum!

22
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,939
We want a refund!

23
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:51,459
Come on!

24
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:54,697
Get off!

25
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,054
Off! Quick, Lady, off!

26
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:05,853
Come on. Cut it out!

27
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:08,093
Off!

28
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,852
You're out of it. Finished.

29
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:14,290
Ladies and gentlemen!

30
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,609
We crave your special attention!
Play the game!

31
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:22,088
Play the game! Come on, lads!

32
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:23,167
Please, sir!

33
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,886
Get off the bloody stage!

34
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,965
Isn't he cute?

35
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:30,844
I know it. I can do the song.

36
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:32,284
Let him do it!

37
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:33,643
Let him try!

38
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:35,403
Give the boy a chance!

39
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:37,162
What's your name?
- Charles.

40
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:41,081
Charles what?
- Charles Chaplin.

41
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,720
At very short notice
and great expense...

42
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,199
...for your special pleasure,
we present...

43
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,797
...Master Charles Chaplin.

44
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:53,796
Half a mo!

45
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:57,435
Ready?

46
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:03,552
You are my honey, honeysuckle.

47
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:07,151
I am your bee.

48
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:09,950
I'd like to sip...

49
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,589
...the honey sweet from those lips...

50
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,668
...you see.

51
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:18,187
I love you dearly, dearly.

52
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:22,106
And I want you to love me.

53
00:06:22,346 --> 00:06:24,905
You are my honey.

54
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:26,264
Honeysuckle.

55
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:30,343
And I am your bee.

56
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:47,856
Your mother never sang again?

57
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:50,495
No. Never.

58
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:53,974
Mrs. Chaplin, if I don't get me rent,
I'll report you!

59
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:59,212
Them two little mites ain't fed proper!

60
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:05,970
If I don't get me rent, I'll report you!

61
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,329
You're two months behind!

62
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:11,968
The rent? Rent?

63
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:14,127
What on earth is that?

64
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,445
Shut up, you ghastly woman!

65
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,764
You tell her!

66
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:29,201
Sorry it's only fish heads again.

67
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,158
I'll get you plum cake one day.

68
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:41,037
When my ship comes in.

69
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:52,633
Mum? Someone's coming!

70
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,110
Mrs. Chaplin?

71
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,747
Are these your children?

72
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:11,146
Not the workhouse.

73
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:13,145
It's for their own good.

74
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,384
Stop! Come back here!

75
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:18,104
Come here!

76
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:21,782
Come here!

77
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,899
We've got him! Quick!

78
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:44,014
Syd!

79
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:51,611
Get off!

80
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:53,651
Put me down! Let me go!

81
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,170
You were beaten?

82
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,169
With a cane thick as a man's thumb.

83
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:58,609
And Syd?

84
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:01,648
Send to a training ship.
Then to sea.

85
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:05,566
You omit how long you were in
the workhouse, or how you got out.

86
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:08,525
That's a mistake. I was there a year.

87
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,444
My mother started
taking in piecework.

88
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,723
Sewing gloves.

89
00:09:13,963 --> 00:09:18,362
While you were growing up,
there was just the two of you.

90
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:20,761
Your father?
- What about him?

91
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:24,999
He died during that period.
You don't write much about him.

92
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:28,598
I don't know much. He left,
sang on stage and died of drink.

93
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:31,037
What else should I say?

94
00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:36,395
This is you're book we're discussing.
It's your life. It's up to you.

95
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:40,753
How do, old scout!

96
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:45,072
How do, old scout! What's up Rummy?
All the police gone?

97
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:47,591
Don't give me your lip.

98
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:50,430
All right, clear off! Now!

99
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,869
Didn't mean no harm.

100
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,068
Hey, Lil.

101
00:09:57,307 --> 00:10:00,666
Charlie? Hello love.

102
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:08,143
Your mum's gone mad again!

103
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:10,862
Get off!

104
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:03,563
Thank God you got here, Charlie!

105
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:08,362
I got you that plum cake,
just like I said.

106
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:13,000
Thanks, Mum.

107
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:32,913
Make your mark, if you can't sign.

108
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:36,671
The doctor said to bring her here.

109
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:40,190
She'll be better off.

110
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,909
What about you?
- I'll be fine.

111
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,068
What do you mean, "fine"?

112
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:46,908
I'll stay with me aunt.

113
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:49,787
Watch your feet, mister!
Shoes cost money!

114
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:54,105
Sometimes she thinks
the floor is a river.

115
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:56,104
We won't get wet.

116
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:58,903
Yes, we'll do our best.

117
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:03,262
You should say good-bye now.

118
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:08,100
Wasn't thinking.

119
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:21,495
Mum, I love you so much.

120
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,894
I know, I know.

121
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:27,333
If you had given me a cup of tea,
I'd be fine.

122
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:29,732
They'll take better care of you.

123
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:33,651
One cup! You must have
wanted to get rid of me bad.

124
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,169
I didn't. I really didn't.

125
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:40,608
Come along, dear.
- You're a lying little runt.

126
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:45,486
You'll end up like your father.

127
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:54,683
Charlie? Don't do this to me.

128
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:59,721
I love you. Don't let them
take me away from you!

129
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:02,040
Don't let them do this to me!

130
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,799
Don't let them do this to me, Charlie!

131
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:11,557
Don't let them take me away
from you, Charlie!

132
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:30,030
Dressed in style
with your father's old green tie on.

133
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,309
I wouldn't give you tuppence
for your old watch chain.

134
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:36,708
Old iron, old iron.

135
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:43,905
Was you scared when you first
met this Karno geezer?

136
00:13:44,145 --> 00:13:48,463
Everyone's scared.
And it's Mr. Karno, remember.

137
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:54,141
To be in vaudeville, you work
for him, or you work for nobody.

138
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:59,579
If you get this job,
and with what I'm bringing in...

139
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:04,617
...we can move Mom
somewhere better.

140
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:07,336
Don't let me down.
- I'll be great.

141
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:12,775
You don't have to be great.
Just shut up and be funny.

142
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:14,134
Hello, Mr. Karno.

143
00:14:14,374 --> 00:14:16,933
Hello, Sydney. Come on over.

144
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,732
We've got something to eat.

145
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:24,770
Now then. What about
this young brother of yours?

146
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,569
He's been legit up to now, Mr. Karno.

147
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:31,928
But he sings and he dances a treat.

148
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:39,405
I've got song and dance men
like you coming out of my ears.

149
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:44,363
Well, his slapstick is fantastic.
He's got the knack.

150
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:47,562
Watch him.

151
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:14,872
He can do more, you know.
More stuff.

152
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:18,830
I hope so.

153
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:36,424
Bloody hell!

154
00:15:41,182 --> 00:15:43,102
You okay?

155
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,181
Need the job that bad?

156
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:46,540
Yes, sir.

157
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,299
Comedy is knowing who you are
and where you come from.

158
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:54,058
It has to be perfection.

159
00:15:54,777 --> 00:15:56,137
Can I come out now?

160
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:58,856
You may.

161
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:11,012
It's been a great evening so far,
hasn't it?

162
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:16,330
I promise, you're going to love
the next act.

163
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,648
Everybody loves elephants.

164
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:25,726
And here on our stage,
you will see twenty of the largest...

165
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:28,125
...most graceful specimens.

166
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:32,204
These are straight from the jungle.

167
00:16:32,444 --> 00:16:34,043
Do you mind, sir?

168
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:37,322
I'm introducing
our dancing elephants.

169
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:40,601
Please do take your seat, sir.

170
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:44,000
Sit down, sir!

171
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:56,515
Take your feet down, sir!

172
00:16:56,755 --> 00:17:00,274
Show a little respect!
Now ladies and gentlemen...

173
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:05,472
...a very big round of applause
for our next act!

174
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:11,030
Captain Boynton and his
Pulchritudinous Pachyderms!

175
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:19,307
Really, sir! This is too much.

176
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:26,304
Kindly remember, sir,
this is a place of entertainment...

177
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:29,263
...not a bar...

178
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:33,621
...or rest home for inebriates!

179
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:41,099
Now, sit down and behave yourself.

180
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:40,917
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Charles Chaplin!

181
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,272
Good evening.

182
00:18:58,311 --> 00:18:59,910
Hey, cookie.

183
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,069
Hello, dearie.
- Hello, Charlie.

184
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:06,708
I hear your governor's here tonight.
- I saw him.

185
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:15,185
Charlie, come and do me up, will you?

186
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:18,583
I'm so late!

187
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:24,021
I'll never make it.

188
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,699
When did it start?

189
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:32,938
This afternoon. He's four.

190
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:35,177
He was coughing his heart out.

191
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,896
It could be the croup. Call a doctor.

192
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,335
I can't afford a doctor!

193
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:43,454
Yankee Doodles,
five minutes, please!

194
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:47,573
Come on. Girls, move.

195
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:52,771
My Harry was in last night.
He thought you were hysterical!

196
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:54,130
How do I look?

197
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,170
Fine, fine.

198
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,328
You're a good boy, Charlie.
You saved me.

199
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:12,364
What are you doing in here?

200
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:14,523
The others don't mind.

201
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:17,162
Well, I do!

202
00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:19,041
You must be new.

203
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:24,559
I'm going to complain.
I'll tell Mr. Karno.

204
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,599
Dirty good-for-nothing.

205
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:29,517
Lips.

206
00:20:30,357 --> 00:20:32,876
Lips.

207
00:20:41,513 --> 00:20:44,992
I'm still going to complain.

208
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,069
Well, thanks, I suppose.

209
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,987
Last again?

210
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:23,018
I'll get your coat.

211
00:21:27,017 --> 00:21:30,375
Look the other way.

212
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:35,334
Hello, hello, who's out on the town?

213
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:36,813
Evening, Govenor.

214
00:21:37,053 --> 00:21:39,252
And in my tails, at that!

215
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:46,290
Don't spill nothing down your front,
lad. That suit cost me good money.

216
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:49,568
Fred, you old devil.

217
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,728
You watch him now.

218
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:55,806
Tomorrow he'll be at sea.

219
00:21:56,046 --> 00:22:00,364
Don't say I didn't warn you.

220
00:22:03,883 --> 00:22:06,922
Good evening. I booked a table.

221
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:10,241
Name of Chaplin.

222
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,959
Mr. Charles Chaplin.

223
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:19,517
I booked it a week ago.

224
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:23,596
There's nothing here, sir.

225
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:27,195
We're fully booked.

226
00:22:27,435 --> 00:22:31,833
There must be some error.

227
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,669
I really did book that table.
You know?

228
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:45,508
I know.

229
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:48,707
It's cause that geezer
saw us with Karno.

230
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:53,745
They won't have theatricals
in them fancy places.

231
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:57,264
You wait. Someday they'll beg.

232
00:22:57,504 --> 00:23:00,942
We'll walk in, you and me.

233
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:05,341
You in a fur, dripping jewels,
me in my own whistle.

234
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:06,700
Whistle?

235
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,380
Whistle and flute. Suit.

236
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,339
Oh, I see.

237
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:24,014
Will you marry me?

238
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:28,852
No.

239
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:30,612
Where would I get the jewels?

240
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:35,090
From me. Engagement rings,
wedding tiaras, rubies...

241
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,888
Charlie, I can't marry you.

242
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:45,726
I don't see why not.

243
00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:49,565
I'm only sixteen.

244
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:53,403
But you'll get over that. Why else?

245
00:23:53,643 --> 00:23:58,521
We hardly know each other.
This is our first date.

246
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:03,120
When I return from America,
we'll spend more time together.

247
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,838
Are you serious?

248
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:10,317
Were you, Charlie?

249
00:24:10,477 --> 00:24:13,676
You say you were.
I want to make sure.

250
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:17,035
It's on page forty-something.

251
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:20,314
Thirty-three.

252
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:24,472
I mean, you never even kissed her.

253
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:28,591
You think I don't know that?

254
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,228
I'll just backtrack for a moment.

255
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:39,267
After you had your mother
committed it all gets a bit vague.

256
00:24:39,507 --> 00:24:40,946
Yes, it does.

257
00:24:41,186 --> 00:24:42,625
Why?

258
00:24:42,865 --> 00:24:45,824
Because I don't wish to remember.

259
00:24:46,064 --> 00:24:49,023
Fair enough. But...

260
00:24:49,263 --> 00:24:51,662
...if you'll allow me to say so...

261
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:55,021
...I don't think, and I know
this sounds very American

262
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:59,579
you shouldn't be afraid to let
the readers share your feelings.

263
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:02,058
Know what I mean?

264
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:05,017
You'll break me heart
if you say no.

265
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:08,616
At least say you'll wait for me.

266
00:25:08,856 --> 00:25:10,695
I'll wait for you.

267
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:13,014
How long will you be in America?

268
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:15,414
I don't know exactly.

269
00:25:15,653 --> 00:25:18,692
It depends if they like the drunk act.

270
00:25:18,932 --> 00:25:20,772
If they throw things,
I won't be gone long.

271
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:23,251
They won't throw things.

272
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:27,369
They'll think you're wonderful.

273
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:33,687
I think you're wonderful.

274
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:42,204
The funny thing is...

275
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:48,481
...you never mentioned love.

276
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:52,760
I don't have to, do I?

277
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:35,624
The number nine's in from Chicago.
Let's load up the steers.

278
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:06,493
Nickel.

279
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:21,528
Sit down.

280
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,438
Have you seen that English bloke?

281
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:50,957
Watch this.

282
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:55,275
I've seen it before.
A telegram came for you.

283
00:27:58,234 --> 00:27:59,594
Show it again.

284
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:01,993
You've seen everything twice.

285
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:03,992
The one with the fire engine.

286
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:05,672
You'll love this one.

287
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:08,551
If any of them could act,
they'd be on the stage.

288
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,190
Charlie, it's a telegram.

289
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:15,748
That can only mean somebody's died.

290
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:28,383
Some bloke's offered me
a job in California.

291
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,543
In the flickers!

292
00:28:30,782 --> 00:28:32,622
The flickers aren't legit.

293
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:36,101
A hundred and fifty a week.

294
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,659
A hundred and fifty a week!

295
00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:00,971
Watch your step.

296
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:22,244
Mack Sennett Studios

297
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:40,397
Hit him harder, Fred.

298
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:42,396
Harder.

299
00:29:42,636 --> 00:29:47,754
Put some muscle into it.
This ain't a Sunday school picnic.

300
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,189
Ready when you are, Mr. Sennett.

301
00:30:14,065 --> 00:30:15,184
Someone's in the shot.

302
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:19,303
Keep cranking. Still cranking!

303
00:30:19,423 --> 00:30:23,342
Cut. Cut it! Jesus Christ!

304
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:26,780
Was it good till the dummies fell out?

305
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,780
How could I find Mr. Mack Sennett?

306
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:31,898
What the hell were you doing?

307
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:34,857
I'm afraid you just found him.

308
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:38,936
Hello, sir. I'm Charlie Chaplin.

309
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,735
You sent me a telegram.

310
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:45,733
Butte, Montana. You hired me
for a year, Mr. Sennett.

311
00:30:45,973 --> 00:30:50,692
You're not Chaplin. Chaplin did
the best comedy drunk I ever saw.

312
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:52,891
I don't pay $ 100 a week to kids.

313
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:54,970
Another one, boss?
- No.

314
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,529
Mr. Sennett?

315
00:31:56,947 --> 00:32:02,146
You might be Chaplin, after all.

316
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:09,463
And it was $ 150.

317
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:15,101
Plum in the middle of a shot.

318
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:19,339
You sure screwed it up, didn't you?

319
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:23,738
Fix it, will you, Rollie?

320
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:26,937
We don't print until we cut it.

321
00:32:27,176 --> 00:32:29,736
That was negative, kid.

322
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:34,214
I know this is new to you,
this is not an ancient industry.

323
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:36,533
It's all built around speed.

324
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:40,012
Start the story, the chase.
I get bored easy is why.

325
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:43,051
How much of Mabel? A couple of yards?

326
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,490
Yeah. No, try three.

327
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,649
But we don't sacrifice quality.

328
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:52,687
I only make two pictures a week.
I'll spend up to $ 1,000 on each.

329
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:54,407
Well, Rollie?

330
00:32:54,646 --> 00:32:56,246
Almost done.

331
00:32:56,486 --> 00:33:00,404
Waste not, want not. That's my motto.

332
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:03,923
When Rollie's done, no one
will know you were there.

333
00:33:04,163 --> 00:33:06,082
I'm rewinding.

334
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:09,921
You're on the cutting room floor.
Not the place to be.

335
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:12,960
Got it.

336
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:19,877
Forget everything you ever learned.
You're not in the theatre anymore.

337
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:37,591
That did it.

338
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:42,229
If you need me, I'll be with Mabel.

339
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,620
Nothing quite like it.

340
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:11,339
The feeling of film. But was it clear...

341
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,618
...how much the movies terrified me?

342
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:15,617
Not really. Why?

343
00:34:15,857 --> 00:34:17,816
You must help me get that right.

344
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,655
I was right to be scared.
I was dreadful.

345
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:26,693
Sennett wished he'd never hired me.
I could barely keep control.

346
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:31,851
I would have been a total disaster
if I hadn't invented the tramp.

347
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:35,050
I wanted to talk to you
about that section.

348
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:39,448
The words just poured out.
It practically wrote itself.

349
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:43,247
I'd only been with Sennett a month.

350
00:34:43,607 --> 00:34:46,326
That magical moment,
as I walked through...

351
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:49,365
...the wardrobe door.

352
00:34:49,605 --> 00:34:53,483
I felt possessed.

353
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:59,041
I could feel him calling out to me.

354
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:02,400
The Tramp.

355
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:10,397
Bullshit. And you know it.

356
00:35:10,637 --> 00:35:14,396
But the truth was so boring, George.

357
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,990
Jesus.

358
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,868
You told him to change.
- Into what, a suit of armour?

359
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:55,901
Chaplin! Get your ass
onto this stage, right now!

360
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,410
Forget the Limey. Get cranking.

361
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,609
Okay! Begin!

362
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:31,248
Very formal, everyone.

363
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:39,485
What the hell? He's crazy.

364
00:36:42,404 --> 00:36:43,843
What do I do?

365
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:46,922
Cut it. No, wait. Hold it. Keep going.

366
00:36:47,162 --> 00:36:48,641
Maybe he's not so crazy.

367
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:53,440
Photographer! Henry!
Chase him around the camera!

368
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,079
Okay, put him in line.

369
00:36:56,319 --> 00:36:59,757
Big reaction! Who is this?

370
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:02,636
Stay down, Henry. Stay down!

371
00:37:02,876 --> 00:37:07,914
Groom! Look jealous!
Jealous! Better than that!

372
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:11,193
Mabel give the tramp the eye.
That's right.

373
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:16,311
Matron, you're real hoity-toity.
Who is this bum? Good. Very good.

374
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:20,670
Groom, he's trying to steal your bride!

375
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:23,909
Matron, hit him!

376
00:37:24,148 --> 00:37:27,427
All right! Domino fall! Domino fall!

377
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:31,266
Start the chase!

378
00:37:35,344 --> 00:37:39,303
Don't stop! Keep going!

379
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:20,608
Good! Good! Terrific!

380
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:28,405
Look into the camera.

381
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:29,925
Snap it.

382
00:38:30,164 --> 00:38:32,004
Watch the bride.

383
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:34,483
That's enough. Cut.

384
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:37,762
Chaplin, what are you trying
to do to me?

385
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:42,200
I knew I was right to hire him.

386
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:46,519
Listen.

387
00:38:46,718 --> 00:38:49,757
You do what I say,
or I'll report you to Mack.

388
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,476
You stand up right now.

389
00:38:52,716 --> 00:38:56,315
Pick up this hose and when I say,
sprinkle the road.

390
00:38:56,555 --> 00:38:59,114
I could do more with that hose.

391
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:01,113
I could be funny.

392
00:39:01,353 --> 00:39:04,912
Two months you think you know
everything. I'm the director.

393
00:39:05,152 --> 00:39:09,030
This is not a movie about
being funny with a hose.

394
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:14,108
You're right. But it could be.

395
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:22,226
Chaplin!

396
00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:32,022
He's coming.

397
00:39:32,262 --> 00:39:35,181
I don't insist you fire him,
but if you do, that's fine.

398
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:39,179
I'd love to axe the Limey,
but I talked to new York.

399
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,538
It seems he's an asset to the company.

400
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:47,576
But I'll make sure he knows
you're a great director.

401
00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:54,694
Is Mack ever waiting for you!

402
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:05,050
Come in.

403
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,929
Charlie, come in, please.

404
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:13,527
You got to help me with Mabel.
She actually thinks she can direct.

405
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:15,606
You're not mad, then?

406
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:20,924
I've been waiting for an actor
to have the guts to stand up to her.

407
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:24,403
I really like you, Charlie.

408
00:40:24,643 --> 00:40:26,802
I really like you too, Mack.

409
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:31,520
And I'll bet you've talked to New York.

410
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,999
Let me direct the next one.

411
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:36,239
How do you know you can?
- I couldn't do worse.

412
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:40,237
Says you. What if no one wants it?
What if it stinks?

413
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:45,115
Who'll pay?
I've never seen you pick up a check.

414
00:40:45,635 --> 00:40:48,594
I'll pay.

415
00:40:49,434 --> 00:40:52,953
This is my work.

416
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,352
Did you pay?

417
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:58,151
No. But, boy, did I work.

418
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:01,509
I directed more than 20 films
by the year's end.

419
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:03,829
Why didn't you send for Hetty?

420
00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:06,907
I did write. Never got a reply.

421
00:41:07,147 --> 00:41:10,906
I thought she might be on tour.
So I asked Syd to track her down...

422
00:41:11,146 --> 00:41:14,425
...see how she felt.

423
00:41:15,944 --> 00:41:18,943
My god, look at him!

424
00:41:19,183 --> 00:41:23,182
Dressed in style with your father's
old green tie on.

425
00:41:23,421 --> 00:41:29,779
I wouldn't give you tuppence
for your old watch chain, old iron.

426
00:41:32,178 --> 00:41:35,217
This is Minnie.

427
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:39,296
Nice to meet you.

428
00:41:39,536 --> 00:41:42,494
Give us a hand, Chas, come on.

429
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,453
Why did you pick him?
- He's not so bad.

430
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:48,252
Our Syd's all right.

431
00:41:48,492 --> 00:41:53,451
I don't know, Chas.
I don't see anybody staring at you.

432
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,849
Nice flivver. How long you had it?
- A couple of weeks.

433
00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:00,168
When do I meet Mr. Sennett?

434
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:04,207
Got something to show you first.

435
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:06,006
Look!

436
00:42:06,246 --> 00:42:08,005
New Chaplin Film

437
00:42:08,245 --> 00:42:12,484
I don't believe it!
It's all happened so quick, Chas.

438
00:42:12,724 --> 00:42:15,522
Last year, you were in vaudeville.

439
00:42:15,762 --> 00:42:17,762
I'm top of the bill.

440
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,801
I still don't see anyone staring at you.

441
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,680
I don't look like me.

442
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:27,438
What news?

443
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:31,996
Mum? Oh, Mum is fine.

444
00:42:32,236 --> 00:42:35,915
Well, not fine,
but there are lots of good days.

445
00:42:36,155 --> 00:42:39,514
Well, not lots. But some.

446
00:42:39,754 --> 00:42:43,032
And Hetty. Does she know?

447
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:46,791
The whole world knows about you.

448
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:51,230
She gave me this for you.

449
00:42:51,509 --> 00:42:55,108
Fancy Hetty writing.

450
00:42:59,946 --> 00:43:03,345
Look at this.

451
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,304
She got married.

452
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:08,823
I know.

453
00:43:09,063 --> 00:43:12,742
I'm not surprised.

454
00:43:12,982 --> 00:43:17,180
I wish her lots of happiness.

455
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,179
Well, not lots. But some.

456
00:43:20,419 --> 00:43:23,898
Chin up, kid.

457
00:43:24,737 --> 00:43:30,735
See, I was right. He is the
most famous man in the world.

458
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:39,532
Value for money is what we want, sir.

459
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:45,250
Charlie, take this guy back
to the asylum.

460
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:50,648
Syd's my manager. He left his
acting career to handle me.

461
00:43:50,888 --> 00:43:54,646
Woe is me!
The theatre will never be the same.

462
00:43:54,886 --> 00:43:58,325
What career? A thousand a week
is more than I get.

463
00:43:58,565 --> 00:44:04,963
Charlie's name is bigger,
if you'll pardon me for saying so.

464
00:44:05,003 --> 00:44:07,202
Charlie, I've been so rotten to you!

465
00:44:07,442 --> 00:44:10,081
I don't know if you can forgive me.

466
00:44:10,321 --> 00:44:13,360
I forced you to leave Butte, Montana.

467
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,798
I made you accept
a hundred and fifty per week.

468
00:44:17,038 --> 00:44:20,397
I stuffed directing down
your throat, too.

469
00:44:20,637 --> 00:44:26,035
Tell me how Uncle Mack can
make it up to you!

470
00:44:26,235 --> 00:44:31,313
I want to run my own show.
I want control.

471
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:37,551
Dream on, kid. I know this business.
You're not that big.

472
00:44:38,351 --> 00:44:42,789
First time I've seen you miss.

473
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:47,067
But, Charlie, Mack Sennett
was the king of comedy.

474
00:44:47,307 --> 00:44:51,706
He gave you your start. How could
you walk out and leave him?

475
00:44:51,946 --> 00:44:56,424
The reasons are clearly intellectual.
Money.

476
00:44:56,664 --> 00:44:59,623
So you joined up with
Bronco Billy Anderson...

477
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,062
...a puffed-up cowboy star?

478
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:05,541
Not the high point of my career.

479
00:45:05,781 --> 00:45:08,020
But I wanted my own studio.

480
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,338
I was putting money aside
to build one.

481
00:45:12,738 --> 00:45:14,257
Excuse me.

482
00:45:14,497 --> 00:45:16,657
Do you always eat alone?

483
00:45:16,897 --> 00:45:19,696
Only when I'm trying to meet someone.

484
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:23,454
Actually, I'm waiting for my girlfriend.

485
00:45:23,694 --> 00:45:26,493
I'm a motion picture director.

486
00:45:26,733 --> 00:45:30,971
I'm forming a new company
with Bronco Billy over there.

487
00:45:31,211 --> 00:45:34,090
And you need a new leading lady.

488
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,770
Lucky me.

489
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:38,089
You must be an actress, miss...

490
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:43,367
Purviance. Sorry. Just a secretary.

491
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:47,126
I'm auditioning actresses
who aren't actresses.

492
00:45:47,365 --> 00:45:51,444
Well, if you need an untalented
actress who isn't an actress...

493
00:45:51,684 --> 00:45:57,402
...you couldn't do better than me.
Worse than me.

494
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,119
Don't you want to know who I am?

495
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,437
I have no interest in who you are.

496
00:46:09,677 --> 00:46:12,796
Mr. Chaplin.

497
00:46:20,553 --> 00:46:21,993
Cut.

498
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:24,752
Not great.

499
00:46:24,992 --> 00:46:27,311
We'll do another.

500
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:30,910
If I eat one more bean,
I'm going to be sick.

501
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:33,629
You almost had it. But this time...

502
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:37,307
...not quite so dainty. You're starving.

503
00:46:37,547 --> 00:46:39,067
I know.

504
00:46:39,307 --> 00:46:42,026
But it's hard to be hungry
after 46 takes.

505
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:44,425
But no one could do it as well.

506
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:46,824
We both know it.

507
00:46:47,064 --> 00:46:49,063
I'll do my best.

508
00:46:49,303 --> 00:46:53,621
How about dinner tonight?
Chili con carne.

509
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:55,541
I'll kill you, Charlie.

510
00:46:55,781 --> 00:46:58,380
More beans.

511
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,219
Camera.

512
00:47:01,538 --> 00:47:04,217
Action!

513
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:12,175
The arrival in the land of liberty.

514
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,637
That's all for today, folks.

515
00:48:01,437 --> 00:48:05,715
Good to know I can count
on my nearest and dearest.

516
00:48:05,955 --> 00:48:08,754
Don't come it with me.

517
00:48:08,994 --> 00:48:13,072
"Arrival in the land of liberty"?
Showing the statue?

518
00:48:13,312 --> 00:48:16,031
What are you playing at?

519
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:19,230
No one else seemed to mind.

520
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:23,469
Kicking an immigration officer
on the backside.

521
00:48:23,709 --> 00:48:26,268
You think that's funny?

522
00:48:26,508 --> 00:48:30,186
For those of us with a sense
of humour, very.

523
00:48:30,426 --> 00:48:35,664
It was supposed to be a comedy.

524
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,983
You've turned it into a bloody
political tract.

525
00:48:39,223 --> 00:48:43,861
We're guests here.
You can't criticize the way it's run.

526
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:47,060
Syd, I love this country.
I owe it everything.

527
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,339
That's why I can criticize it.
Why I must.

528
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:56,417
Remember where we're from.
There's a war going on, remember?

529
00:48:56,657 --> 00:49:00,335
You make a million a year
while British boys die in France.

530
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:04,254
The London papers are after you.
You want that here, too?

531
00:49:04,494 --> 00:49:07,932
I registered for the draft.
They never called me.

532
00:49:08,172 --> 00:49:12,651
It isn't like I'm hard to find.

533
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:16,169
I'm on your side, kid.

534
00:49:16,409 --> 00:49:19,208
First one on board, remember?

535
00:49:19,448 --> 00:49:22,407
Be careful, Chas.

536
00:49:22,647 --> 00:49:26,046
Just watch it.

537
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:30,444
That's all I'm saying.

538
00:50:04,192 --> 00:50:06,751
You said you detested studio parties.

539
00:50:06,991 --> 00:50:10,910
The worst. But not where
Doug Fairbanks was concerned.

540
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:13,709
Life was fun when Doug was around.

541
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:18,507
I don't think anyone today remembers
what a huge star he was.

542
00:50:18,747 --> 00:50:22,026
I mean in those days, he was huge.

543
00:50:22,265 --> 00:50:23,705
Men liked him.

544
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:26,504
Women adored him.

545
00:50:26,744 --> 00:50:31,222
He was royalty.

546
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:40,259
Look out below!

547
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:53,614
Sire, you are most truly welcome.

548
00:50:53,694 --> 00:50:54,974
Great party, Doug.

549
00:50:55,213 --> 00:51:00,052
Isn't it fabulous?
- Wonderful.

550
00:51:03,131 --> 00:51:04,410
I hate it more than you do.

551
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:07,329
I doubt it.

552
00:51:07,449 --> 00:51:12,087
Of course everything changed
when America's Sweetheart came.

553
00:51:12,327 --> 00:51:14,966
You mean Mary Pickford?

554
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:18,565
I always found her to be something
of an undersized bitch.

555
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:21,844
But Doug fell for her
like a ton of bricks.

556
00:51:22,084 --> 00:51:23,443
Hello, Charlie.

557
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:27,202
Hi, Doug. Thanks for inviting me.

558
00:51:27,442 --> 00:51:31,920
Mary. It's a pleasure.

559
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:37,198
Duty calls. Excuse me.

560
00:51:39,237 --> 00:51:41,717
He's really a lovely person, Charlie.

561
00:51:41,956 --> 00:51:45,755
Yes. Hungry?

562
00:52:07,867 --> 00:52:09,706
Her name is Mildred Harris.

563
00:52:09,946 --> 00:52:11,306
An actress?

564
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:14,904
Oh, yes. A child actress.

565
00:52:15,144 --> 00:52:17,623
You ever hear the word "jailbait"?

566
00:52:17,863 --> 00:52:20,822
That's the definition.
I'd watch it if I was you.

567
00:52:21,062 --> 00:52:24,501
I value that, Mary.

568
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,059
Coming from you.

569
00:52:29,299 --> 00:52:32,658
When America's Sweetheart gives
you advice, you'd better listen.

570
00:52:32,898 --> 00:52:36,577
"Better listen?" Thanks, Charlie.

571
00:52:36,817 --> 00:52:41,535
When here you're married and Doug
is married and you two are rutting...

572
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:43,614
...pretending you've just met.

573
00:52:43,854 --> 00:52:45,373
Mr. Chaplin, please?

574
00:52:45,613 --> 00:52:49,292
Lecture me more about morality.

575
00:52:50,092 --> 00:52:52,731
Bettah, Bettah.

576
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:55,450
Bettah. Bitch.

577
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,769
Better.

578
00:53:12,803 --> 00:53:16,122
I washed my face.

579
00:53:16,282 --> 00:53:19,441
Come here.

580
00:53:36,035 --> 00:53:39,074
What is it?

581
00:53:39,314 --> 00:53:44,832
I just need some...
you just need some lip rouge.

582
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:47,951
I've some in my purse.

583
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:52,869
It's in the drawer, over there.

584
00:54:12,102 --> 00:54:15,421
Look at me.

585
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,939
Is this right?

586
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:22,898
Just put it on.

587
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:12,760
You weren't yet 30 and were
the most famous man in the world.

588
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,878
You had your own studio, named
after you. Couldn't you just enjoy?

589
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:19,078
I can, now.

590
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:24,396
I couldn't then. It meant too much.

591
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,749
Mr. Chaplin, welcome.

592
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:04,501
Can I take your picture?

593
00:57:09,637 --> 00:57:11,717
Cut!
- Hold it.

594
00:57:11,956 --> 00:57:13,876
Let's try a little less.

595
00:57:14,116 --> 00:57:15,315
Hold the smoke.

596
00:57:15,555 --> 00:57:20,113
The dirt, I mean.
Someone get me out of this thing.

597
00:57:22,033 --> 00:57:26,671
Looks great, Charlie. I kept the boys
here till you got out of costume.

598
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:31,109
You are an ass!
- Thank you.

599
00:57:31,229 --> 00:57:32,509
One more, Charlie?

600
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:34,348
How's the light? I know.

601
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:36,747
It's better down at Barney's Bar.

602
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:40,146
Call it a day.

603
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:43,945
I don't feel funny anymore.
- Let's go, Charlie.

604
00:57:44,185 --> 00:57:46,104
Are you cheating, Fairbanks?

605
00:57:46,344 --> 00:57:49,143
You are a truly strange fellow,
Charles.

606
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,582
Nonsense.

607
00:57:50,822 --> 00:57:52,262
Facts indicate otherwise.

608
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,661
Out.

609
00:57:54,901 --> 00:57:57,780
These facts show a young man
of what, 29?

610
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:03,338
Not perhaps handsome,
but certainly not repellent.

611
00:58:03,858 --> 00:58:06,657
Flatteringly put.

612
00:58:06,896 --> 00:58:10,175
Double fault. Lucky me.

613
00:58:10,415 --> 00:58:14,414
A fellow of fame and fortune,
not without talent.

614
00:58:14,654 --> 00:58:15,453
Ready?

615
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:17,693
If only you'd put one in play.

616
00:58:17,932 --> 00:58:19,612
Call this one out.

617
00:58:19,852 --> 00:58:21,811
What for? I'm winning.

618
00:58:22,051 --> 00:58:23,011
Damn.

619
00:58:23,251 --> 00:58:24,210
Damn.

620
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:26,449
And who is he escorting?

621
00:58:26,689 --> 00:58:32,207
Mildred Harris, that intellectual giant
of 16 who still sucks her thumb.

622
00:58:32,447 --> 00:58:33,327
Very funny.

623
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:36,366
Then why aren't you laughing?

624
00:58:36,606 --> 00:58:40,644
Because I'm marrying her.

625
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:51,080
She's really not that bad.

626
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,639
"Really not that bad"?

627
00:58:53,879 --> 00:59:00,517
Spoken like a man desperately in love.
You're madder than I thought.

628
00:59:02,676 --> 00:59:04,675
You sure it's yours?

629
00:59:04,915 --> 00:59:06,355
I can only hope.

630
00:59:06,595 --> 00:59:10,113
There are ways of getting out of this.

631
00:59:10,353 --> 00:59:15,711
Where I come from,
that's not an option.

632
00:59:15,871 --> 00:59:18,430
Besides, I want a family...

633
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:22,189
You'll have one before you know it.

634
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:24,828
May I congratulate you?

635
00:59:25,068 --> 00:59:26,987
You may not!

636
00:59:27,227 --> 00:59:29,906
Good!

637
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:38,663
You didn't suspect about Mildred?

638
00:59:38,903 --> 00:59:40,582
Not for a moment.

639
00:59:40,822 --> 00:59:44,181
Why don't you add that? Put that in?

640
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:47,860
I'll never forget the night
Mary told me.

641
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,979
We were celebrating
the end of WW1.

642
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:53,938
I met J. Edgar Hoover
for the first time.

643
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:57,776
You should explain this was before
he became head of the FBI.

644
00:59:58,016 --> 01:00:01,615
If I may continue, Mr. Hearst.
We're too generous.

645
01:00:01,855 --> 01:00:05,693
We're too open.
If we don't watch out...

646
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:10,771
...if we don't take steps now to impose
some new discipline, some decency...

647
01:00:11,011 --> 01:00:14,290
...then we're in trouble. Deep trouble.

648
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:17,089
It's not fashionable to say this.

649
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:20,528
We're celebrating, we think it's over.

650
01:00:20,768 --> 01:00:23,967
But democracy carries a price tag.

651
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:28,925
I think one of the most misguided
promises we ever made...

652
01:00:29,165 --> 01:00:32,683
...was inscribed
on the Statue of Liberty.

653
01:00:32,923 --> 01:00:36,762
One I predict will lead this country
into trouble.

654
01:00:37,002 --> 01:00:40,601
"Give us your poor,
your huddled masses. "

655
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,359
We must stop this
before it goes too far.

656
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,838
Our concept of America
does not include...

657
01:00:47,078 --> 01:00:50,117
...never included this kind of scum.

658
01:00:50,357 --> 01:00:53,236
You must forgive
our famous young friend...

659
01:00:53,476 --> 01:00:59,954
...his artistic temperament.
What you're saying is important.

660
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:12,829
We are giving sanctuary
to the refuse of the world.

661
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:17,707
Left-wing intellectuals
who want to bring us down.

662
01:01:17,947 --> 01:01:19,866
Aren't you overstating?

663
01:01:20,106 --> 01:01:21,626
No, I'm not.

664
01:01:21,866 --> 01:01:25,704
Do you people realize
the responsibility you have?

665
01:01:25,944 --> 01:01:29,143
To my way of thinking, movies...

666
01:01:29,383 --> 01:01:32,822
...are the most influential form
of communication ever invented.

667
01:01:33,061 --> 01:01:35,061
And they're not controlled.

668
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:36,980
Your message
reaches people everywhere.

669
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,739
Message?

670
01:01:38,979 --> 01:01:40,499
Of course.

671
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:44,497
Mr. Chaplin reaches millions
who only have to see.

672
01:01:44,737 --> 01:01:48,256
And when they see our immigration
service mocked...

673
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:51,095
...I call that a message.

674
01:01:51,335 --> 01:01:54,694
As you've already said, Mr. Hoover...

675
01:01:54,934 --> 01:01:57,253
...movies are for the people.

676
01:01:57,493 --> 01:02:01,091
Most people work for a living
and don't make very much.

677
01:02:01,331 --> 01:02:05,730
It pleases them to see officials and the
upper class kicked on the backside.

678
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:09,008
Always have and it always will.

679
01:02:09,248 --> 01:02:13,647
And if that can change things,
so much the better.

680
01:02:13,887 --> 01:02:16,446
Bettah.

681
01:02:16,686 --> 01:02:18,205
He's improving.

682
01:02:18,445 --> 01:02:21,244
But movies have made you rich.

683
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:25,003
They sure have.

684
01:02:27,562 --> 01:02:30,681
I think you've handled it wonderfully.

685
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,360
Mildred.

686
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,079
The pregnancy?

687
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:40,717
Everyone knows you were conned.

688
01:02:47,314 --> 01:02:50,353
Excuse us, Mr. Hearst.
I must be up early.

689
01:02:50,593 --> 01:02:54,872
Come along, my dear.

690
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:12,505
You made an enemy there.

691
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:15,064
Was it personal, you think?

692
01:03:15,304 --> 01:03:17,224
Personal? Maybe.

693
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:20,822
I'm sure he really believed
I was a communist.

694
01:03:21,062 --> 01:03:23,541
I wasn't. I was simply a humanist.

695
01:03:23,781 --> 01:03:26,420
He also believed you were a Jew.

696
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:31,059
Something I've rarely troubled
to deny, mainly because of Syd.

697
01:03:31,298 --> 01:03:36,057
He's half-Jewish.
Same mother, different fathers.

698
01:03:36,297 --> 01:03:42,015
I suppose the false pregnancy
was the end with Mildred.

699
01:03:50,691 --> 01:03:55,410
You're so late again.
I'd almost given up.

700
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:59,408
Sometimes I feel I'm so close
to getting it right...

701
01:03:59,648 --> 01:04:01,647
...but it slips away.

702
01:04:01,887 --> 01:04:04,926
You've been editing that film
for months.

703
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:08,845
Will be for months, more than likely.

704
01:04:09,085 --> 01:04:14,763
Not like the old days.
The good times.

705
01:04:15,802 --> 01:04:20,800
The good times? Are they over?

706
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,119
You want me to leave?

707
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:27,238
No.

708
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:32,236
I'll leave.

709
01:04:40,353 --> 01:04:41,953
Why aren't you bitter towards her?

710
01:04:42,193 --> 01:04:45,232
Stealing my movie wasn't her idea.

711
01:04:45,472 --> 01:04:50,750
Poor child was so stupid,
I doubt she could even spell "idea".

712
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:55,788
Wake up!

713
01:04:58,827 --> 01:05:00,666
They're trying to seize the film.

714
01:05:00,906 --> 01:05:02,745
Wash your face and wake up.

715
01:05:02,985 --> 01:05:07,464
Sweet little bride of yours. Her divorce
lawyers say the film's an asset.

716
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:09,863
An asset?

717
01:05:10,103 --> 01:05:14,661
I've got Rollie, the wife and 40
cans of film in the car. Come on.

718
01:05:14,941 --> 01:05:19,099
Once we're out of the state,
we'll finish cutting the film.

719
01:05:19,339 --> 01:05:24,057
You've got
your pants on back to front.

720
01:06:17,638 --> 01:06:20,277
It's good.

721
01:06:21,317 --> 01:06:24,635
It moves now.

722
01:06:29,474 --> 01:06:33,712
I really do love that kid.

723
01:06:58,503 --> 01:07:01,022
Where's that shot, Syd?

724
01:07:01,262 --> 01:07:03,421
Look in 102, Rollie.

725
01:07:03,661 --> 01:07:07,420
Wait. I've got it, Chas.

726
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:12,298
Minnie, answer the door. Hurry.

727
01:07:21,735 --> 01:07:26,333
Here's your tea.
- Thanks very much.

728
01:07:30,931 --> 01:07:34,250
He's on to us, boys.

729
01:08:22,593 --> 01:08:27,431
You are the honeysuckle
and I am the bee.

730
01:08:31,309 --> 01:08:35,308
They're here, boss.

731
01:09:15,853 --> 01:09:20,691
I've dreamed of this moment for years.

732
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:27,809
This is America.
It's where your dreams come true.

733
01:09:34,366 --> 01:09:36,846
Charlie bought you a lovely house.

734
01:09:37,085 --> 01:09:41,684
It's not too big.
- Great ocean view.

735
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:53,959
You always wanted to live by the see.

736
01:09:56,318 --> 01:10:00,757
Don't stop Syd. You're right. I have.

737
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:06,475
I think I will love watching the waves.

738
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:12,353
I'm sure I will. You boys!
You spoil me so!

739
01:10:28,147 --> 01:10:31,226
More tea?

740
01:10:34,065 --> 01:10:36,784
The mark on my arm?

741
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:40,982
I got that at the asylum.

742
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:48,699
If I'd fed you proper,
I'd never have gone there.

743
01:10:48,939 --> 01:10:55,537
Now, if they ever come back for me,
I'll have enough food for us all.

744
01:11:02,374 --> 01:11:05,493
I could never deal with my mother.

745
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:08,572
I just threw money at her.

746
01:11:08,812 --> 01:11:13,410
You have to explain why you chose
that time to go to London.

747
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:17,089
I was tired. I had a movie opening.

748
01:11:17,729 --> 01:11:21,088
I wanted to see old friends.

749
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:27,725
Straight into the water, ass over tip!

750
01:11:27,965 --> 01:11:31,604
He needed the job that bad!

751
01:11:31,844 --> 01:11:35,962
But I was worried, Charlie.
I was prepared for the worst.

752
01:11:36,202 --> 01:11:41,320
I've seen it happen
in the profession so many times.

753
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,959
I'm sure you have, Mr. Karno.

754
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:48,358
Head size. That's the only true
measure of a man.

755
01:11:48,598 --> 01:11:54,915
I sent this lad to America.
Look what's come back to me.

756
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:59,554
My head never swelled,
not with all my successes.

757
01:11:59,794 --> 01:12:03,712
But I was worried about you, Charlie.

758
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:07,271
That night at the Troc, remember?

759
01:12:07,511 --> 01:12:11,909
You took a tall suit from the
wardrobe and tried to be a gent.

760
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:16,108
Trying to impress that dancer,
Hetty-wasn't that her name?

761
01:12:16,348 --> 01:12:17,747
Hetty Kelly.

762
01:12:17,987 --> 01:12:20,786
I could see that you fancied her.

763
01:12:21,026 --> 01:12:23,345
Sad.

764
01:12:23,585 --> 01:12:26,624
I know all about it. She got married.

765
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:32,582
She sent me a lovely note.
I've got it with me somewhere.

766
01:12:32,822 --> 01:12:37,500
Oh, Charlie, Charlie.

767
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:40,099
Don't you know?

768
01:12:40,339 --> 01:12:43,977
Has nobody told you? She's gone!

769
01:12:44,217 --> 01:12:49,975
The flu epidemic after the war
carried her away.

770
01:12:51,175 --> 01:12:54,454
I thought someone
must have told you.

771
01:12:54,694 --> 01:12:56,693
Must have written.

772
01:12:56,933 --> 01:13:00,691
Didn't nobody?

773
01:13:41,836 --> 01:13:45,555
What will we do, Charlie?

774
01:13:49,874 --> 01:13:52,752
Smile.

775
01:13:54,952 --> 01:13:58,270
Give me my hat.

776
01:15:27,878 --> 01:15:31,996
Hey! That's Charlie Chaplin!

777
01:15:32,316 --> 01:15:33,996
What can I get you?

778
01:15:34,236 --> 01:15:36,075
Light ale, please.

779
01:15:36,315 --> 01:15:39,034
That'll be tuppence, sir.

780
01:15:39,274 --> 01:15:42,593
There's someone who had a good war!

781
01:15:42,832 --> 01:15:44,592
He wasn't in the army!

782
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:47,831
Come to stare at the animals, Charlie?

783
01:15:48,071 --> 01:15:50,590
Give your mouth a rest, Ted.

784
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,469
I just came in for a quiet drink.

785
01:15:52,709 --> 01:15:54,148
Good to see you.

786
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:55,588
Have one on me.

787
01:15:55,828 --> 01:15:57,827
You have one on me.

788
01:15:58,067 --> 01:16:00,866
Mr. Charlie fucking Chaplin!

789
01:16:01,106 --> 01:16:05,104
Cheers! Bloody bastard!

790
01:16:05,664 --> 01:16:11,462
Don't worry about him. He's always
been a miserable old sod.

791
01:16:19,099 --> 01:16:22,858
Good luck!
- I've seen all your pictures!

792
01:16:23,098 --> 01:16:26,057
That's Charlie Chaplin!

793
01:16:26,297 --> 01:16:28,216
There's the back way, sir.

794
01:16:28,456 --> 01:16:32,174
You're very kind.

795
01:16:54,366 --> 01:16:57,565
Charles Chaplin in the Kid.

796
01:16:57,805 --> 01:17:01,644
Welcome home, Charlie.

797
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:08,761
I knew then that I had no home. So I
decided to put down roots in America.

798
01:17:27,834 --> 01:17:30,953
A man came to see me the other day.

799
01:17:31,193 --> 01:17:35,591
A corset salesman? I sent him.
Your paunch needs help.

800
01:17:35,831 --> 01:17:38,470
He was the FBl, old darling.

801
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:41,349
Said he knew I was a loyal American.

802
01:17:41,589 --> 01:17:45,348
He wondered if everyone else
felt the same.

803
01:17:45,588 --> 01:17:47,907
I let him work his way around to you...

804
01:17:48,147 --> 01:17:49,826
...which he did.

805
01:17:50,066 --> 01:17:52,865
He asked if you were a member
of the Communist Party.

806
01:17:53,105 --> 01:17:55,624
I said that was
an absolute impossibility.

807
01:17:55,864 --> 01:17:57,423
Because I love America.

808
01:17:57,663 --> 01:18:00,462
You were too cheap to pay the dues.

809
01:18:00,702 --> 01:18:05,261
Remarkable. Your timing in work
is flawless. In life, it's the reverse.

810
01:18:05,501 --> 01:18:11,258
You're a miserable pain in the ass.
But I'm worried about you.

811
01:18:11,498 --> 01:18:14,097
Worry about your family jewels...

812
01:18:14,337 --> 01:18:15,817
...old darling.

813
01:18:16,057 --> 01:18:20,095
I'm serious. Watch out.

814
01:18:22,374 --> 01:18:24,374
For what?

815
01:18:24,614 --> 01:18:28,212
You're a foreigner.
You're still an outsider.

816
01:18:28,452 --> 01:18:30,691
You don't understand this country.

817
01:18:30,931 --> 01:18:33,330
It's a good country underneath.

818
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:37,089
No. It's a good country on top.

819
01:18:37,329 --> 01:18:42,767
Underneath is what starts showing
when we're scared.

820
01:18:43,007 --> 01:18:46,566
But you don't care about politics.
What is this?

821
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:48,285
Why are you worried?

822
01:18:48,525 --> 01:18:51,484
Me? I haven't a care in the world.

823
01:18:51,724 --> 01:18:55,162
I'm the oldest action star around
and talkies are coming.

824
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:59,121
What have I got
to be worried about?

825
01:18:59,321 --> 01:19:01,840
That's talkies, Charles.

826
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,999
Talkies!

827
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,839
Talkies!

828
01:19:06,078 --> 01:19:07,998
Imagine the tramp talking.

829
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:09,597
It's the future, Charlie.

830
01:19:09,837 --> 01:19:11,277
Not in my lifetime.

831
01:19:11,517 --> 01:19:14,116
Talkies!

832
01:19:14,355 --> 01:19:16,315
It'll never catch on.

833
01:19:16,555 --> 01:19:19,674
Talkies!

834
01:19:39,506 --> 01:19:44,225
We've enlarged it for you.

835
01:19:44,465 --> 01:19:47,903
I still can't make him out.

836
01:19:48,143 --> 01:19:50,942
Have you got a positive I.D.?

837
01:19:51,182 --> 01:19:54,101
It's Hawkins, sir. The red labour leader.

838
01:19:54,341 --> 01:19:56,580
Visiting him in the studio.

839
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:59,139
How can we make them
realize the danger?

840
01:19:59,379 --> 01:20:00,939
I told him that.

841
01:20:01,178 --> 01:20:04,377
Face to face.
"You can damage this country".

842
01:20:04,617 --> 01:20:08,616
He didn't get it.

843
01:20:09,176 --> 01:20:11,415
How old is this one?

844
01:20:11,655 --> 01:20:14,094
She's under age is all that matters.

845
01:20:14,334 --> 01:20:16,773
We can go after him
for statuary rape.

846
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:18,692
The scandal will destroy him.

847
01:20:18,932 --> 01:20:21,091
I appreciate your zeal.

848
01:20:21,331 --> 01:20:26,769
But Chaplin and Miss Grey
were married yesterday.

849
01:20:27,569 --> 01:20:32,127
If only he'd just sleep with them!
It would be so much easier.

850
01:20:32,367 --> 01:20:33,967
Still...

851
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:38,165
...we must do what we can.

852
01:20:39,405 --> 01:20:43,723
Lita was your second wife. She gave
you two sons, whom you adored.

853
01:20:43,963 --> 01:20:47,042
This book is over 500 pages long.

854
01:20:47,282 --> 01:20:49,761
Yet only five lines to her. Why?

855
01:20:50,001 --> 01:20:52,080
I hated the bitch.

856
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,958
She was hardly more than a child.
It can't all have been her fault.

857
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:00,477
She was a profoundly flawed
human being.

858
01:21:00,717 --> 01:21:02,316
We must deal with the problem.

859
01:21:02,556 --> 01:21:05,915
You married her.
All your life you bedded babies.

860
01:21:06,155 --> 01:21:07,754
Readers will want to understand.

861
01:21:07,994 --> 01:21:11,673
Where were you when she had those
two boys less than a year apart?

862
01:21:11,913 --> 01:21:18,031
You know were I was. Making a little
film called "The Gold Rush".

863
01:21:21,909 --> 01:21:25,668
You're a flawed human being,
just like the rest of us.

864
01:21:25,908 --> 01:21:30,306
Only, you have to address it.

865
01:21:30,466 --> 01:21:36,864
I mean, why are we here talking
in Switzerland and not California?

866
01:21:37,104 --> 01:21:41,502
It wasn't just the parlour pink
business or the speeches...

867
01:21:41,742 --> 01:21:45,740
...or the donations that finally turned
you into an exile.

868
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:48,619
Nah.

869
01:21:49,379 --> 01:21:52,618
You know what it was?

870
01:21:52,858 --> 01:21:55,937
Sex.

871
01:21:58,336 --> 01:22:01,695
Yes. Sex.

872
01:22:01,975 --> 01:22:05,333
It's odd, but I've never looked
at a woman...

873
01:22:05,573 --> 01:22:11,011
...without measuring that
possibility between us.

874
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:16,289
At the same time, I'm not that
interested-never during work.

875
01:22:16,529 --> 01:22:21,248
I suppose it was only when I wasn't
working I was...

876
01:22:21,487 --> 01:22:24,966
...vulnerable.

877
01:22:25,086 --> 01:22:28,605
Why don't you write about that?

878
01:22:28,845 --> 01:22:31,844
If you want to understand me...

879
01:22:32,084 --> 01:22:35,242
...watch my movies.

880
01:22:39,841 --> 01:22:44,959
Okay, sonny boy, tell your poor
little brother today's problem.

881
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,438
The same as yesterday.

882
01:22:47,678 --> 01:22:50,877
And the day before
and the day before.

883
01:22:51,117 --> 01:22:54,116
Fine. You be creative for a change.

884
01:22:54,355 --> 01:22:57,274
The Tramp buys a flower from the girl.

885
01:22:57,514 --> 01:23:01,633
For the plot to work,
she has to think he's rich. That's all.

886
01:23:01,873 --> 01:23:05,192
Except, of course, the girl is blind.

887
01:23:05,431 --> 01:23:09,990
And I don't know how to make her
mistake him for a millionaire.

888
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:11,909
Easy.

889
01:23:12,149 --> 01:23:15,348
We'll do what everyone else is doing.

890
01:23:15,588 --> 01:23:18,707
Joe!

891
01:23:19,026 --> 01:23:23,585
We'll have the actors talk.

892
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:26,104
Joseph Curb, Vitaphone.

893
01:23:26,344 --> 01:23:30,102
Hello, sir.

894
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:37,980
Sorry. You're in the middle
of a family feud.

895
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:42,218
You decide who's right.
The Tramp can't talk.

896
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:47,576
The minute he talks, he's dead.
Tell me I'm right.

897
01:23:47,816 --> 01:23:50,295
He can't, because you're wrong.

898
01:23:50,535 --> 01:23:54,454
Who'll pay to see you,
when everyone else uses sound?

899
01:23:54,694 --> 01:23:57,972
I'll tell you who.
The Japanese and the Russkies...

900
01:23:58,212 --> 01:24:00,931
Anyone who doesn't speak English.

901
01:24:01,171 --> 01:24:06,369
Or did you forget about the other
9"I"10s of the globe?

902
01:24:07,169 --> 01:24:10,128
Who's the most famous ballet dancer
in the world?

903
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,087
The most famous ballet dancer
in the world?

904
01:24:13,327 --> 01:24:15,166
Nijinsky.

905
01:24:15,406 --> 01:24:19,604
Fine. So let's say he was doing
"Swan Lake" today...

906
01:24:19,844 --> 01:24:23,443
...and we went to see it.

907
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:26,482
He comes down to the footlights.

908
01:24:26,722 --> 01:24:28,601
The orchestra stops.

909
01:24:28,841 --> 01:24:33,080
He says, "Hi, I'm Vaslav Nijinsky".
No, he'd have Russian accent.

910
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:36,878
"Hi, folksies. Call me Vaslav Nijinsky.
Just call me Vas"

911
01:24:37,118 --> 01:24:39,677
"It's okay by me".

912
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,156
"Everything is wonderful".

913
01:24:42,396 --> 01:24:45,755
"Today I'm going to jump up
and down for you".

914
01:24:45,995 --> 01:24:51,673
"Hope you like me. "
What would happen when he danced?

915
01:24:51,913 --> 01:24:55,831
It would be awful.
Because the magic is gone.

916
01:24:56,071 --> 01:25:00,470
As it would with the tramp.

917
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:04,388
Tell me I'm right.

918
01:25:04,468 --> 01:25:08,467
I'm in the word business,
so I have to say you're wrong.

919
01:25:08,707 --> 01:25:13,185
But I'm glad I got to meet you.

920
01:25:13,905 --> 01:25:17,623
Enjoyed the dancing?

921
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:21,342
Yeah. And the talking.

922
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:31,138
Take Mr. Curb to his office.

923
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:42,214
Rollie! Get them all back.
Syd, we're in business!

924
01:25:42,454 --> 01:25:45,413
How does a blind girl mistake
a tramp for a rich man?

925
01:25:45,653 --> 01:25:48,932
When she hears a door slam
on the rich man's car.

926
01:25:49,172 --> 01:25:52,171
She thinks the tramp's the owner.

927
01:25:52,371 --> 01:25:57,209
Easy. When you know how.

928
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:09,045
Boys!

929
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:23,759
Boys!
I'm taking your ball to the cellar.

930
01:26:23,879 --> 01:26:28,078
I don't see any stairs.

931
01:26:38,634 --> 01:26:42,992
Mum's here. Off you go!

932
01:26:43,112 --> 01:26:46,711
Your mummy's here.

933
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:54,628
I'll see you next weekend.
Come on, off you go!

934
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:21,898
It can't be all that bad, Mr. Chaplin.

935
01:27:22,138 --> 01:27:24,217
Do I know you?

936
01:27:24,457 --> 01:27:26,217
And why don't I?

937
01:27:26,457 --> 01:27:28,936
I'm Paulette Levy.

938
01:27:29,176 --> 01:27:31,974
Would you like a drink?

939
01:27:32,214 --> 01:27:34,214
I already have one.

940
01:27:34,454 --> 01:27:38,052
A fur coat?

941
01:27:38,732 --> 01:27:42,291
You look hungry.

942
01:27:47,769 --> 01:27:50,328
Actress?

943
01:27:50,568 --> 01:27:54,166
If you watch B movies and don't blink.

944
01:27:54,406 --> 01:27:57,525
But don't get any ideas.
- You're taken.

945
01:27:57,765 --> 01:28:03,243
No, but I'm twenty-one.
Way too old for you.

946
01:28:04,243 --> 01:28:07,042
You're very pretty, Miss Levy.

947
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:10,560
I didn't get here
thanks to my Shakespeare reviews.

948
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,399
May I say something?
You'd be prettier as a brunette.

949
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:19,277
You'd be devastating
if you were 6 inches taller.

950
01:28:19,517 --> 01:28:23,356
Punch? Two, please.

951
01:28:23,596 --> 01:28:26,395
At least you can do something
about your hair.

952
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:31,433
Never! I was born this way.

953
01:28:34,072 --> 01:28:37,831
Nice to see you again, sir.

954
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:52,305
Evening, Mr. Chaplin.

955
01:28:52,545 --> 01:28:57,104
Sorry,
I'm waiting for a natural blonde.

956
01:29:02,062 --> 01:29:03,581
You look beautiful.

957
01:29:03,821 --> 01:29:09,219
My usual table.
- Of course. Right this way.

958
01:29:20,175 --> 01:29:23,214
You'd come a long way.
- Yes. My own suit.

959
01:29:23,454 --> 01:29:27,213
No need to book a table.
I lived in luxury. But I was blind.

960
01:29:27,452 --> 01:29:28,692
Blind?

961
01:29:28,932 --> 01:29:31,931
Yes. That's fatal, for a storyteller.

962
01:29:32,171 --> 01:29:36,249
Did I tell you I sold all my stocks
the year before the Crash?

963
01:29:36,489 --> 01:29:40,248
That was clever.

964
01:29:40,648 --> 01:29:45,566
It was deeply cruel, the Depression.

965
01:29:46,046 --> 01:29:49,844
Can I have an autograph, Mr. Chaplin?

966
01:29:50,084 --> 01:29:53,763
Yes, of course.

967
01:29:58,921 --> 01:30:02,120
I wish they'd wanted my money.

968
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:07,518
You know what?
I've always had that gift.

969
01:30:08,837 --> 01:30:14,755
After a man makes love to me,
he just goes wild from happiness.

970
01:30:14,995 --> 01:30:17,794
I am happy.

971
01:30:18,034 --> 01:30:23,432
Then I don't want to be around
when you're sad.

972
01:30:26,511 --> 01:30:30,270
Terrible things have happened
since the Crash.

973
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:33,908
Millions of Americans
have been robbed of work.

974
01:30:34,148 --> 01:30:39,546
Machinery is replacing manpower.

975
01:30:39,906 --> 01:30:43,825
And I've said nothing.

976
01:30:46,384 --> 01:30:50,102
Shame on me.

977
01:30:50,782 --> 01:30:54,381
Shame on me.

978
01:31:16,893 --> 01:31:20,691
You're right, Charlie.
It's three seconds too short.

979
01:31:20,931 --> 01:31:26,729
Okay, we'll do a two-bar repeat
of the xylophone.

980
01:31:28,728 --> 01:31:30,288
Sorry, darling.

981
01:31:30,528 --> 01:31:34,726
I'm taking the boys out today.
Why don't you come?

982
01:31:34,966 --> 01:31:39,764
Tomorrow, darling.
Definitely tomorrow.

983
01:31:42,443 --> 01:31:44,243
Put that in straight away.

984
01:31:44,483 --> 01:31:48,601
What should we do?
- Change the key.

985
01:31:48,841 --> 01:31:52,200
Let me hear it.

986
01:31:56,238 --> 01:32:00,437
No. I'll tell you why.

987
01:32:09,074 --> 01:32:13,032
Charlie, you were supposed
to meet us at the fight.

988
01:32:13,272 --> 01:32:16,031
I'm sorry. Who was fighting?

989
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:18,550
Mostly Mary and Doug.

990
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:23,548
You're wonderful, Miss Goddard.

991
01:32:30,986 --> 01:32:35,264
That didn't work either, did it?

992
01:32:56,337 --> 01:32:59,615
The Fairbanks are getting a divorce.

993
01:32:59,855 --> 01:33:03,894
Mussolini has invaded Abyssinia.

994
01:33:04,134 --> 01:33:06,893
You really need a break, Charlie.

995
01:33:07,133 --> 01:33:08,892
We should take a trip.

996
01:33:09,132 --> 01:33:11,051
Good idea.

997
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:13,610
What's a good idea?

998
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:18,289
Around the world, I thought.

999
01:33:20,008 --> 01:33:24,006
I'm not going to make it.

1000
01:33:31,004 --> 01:33:35,802
Did you lose your other wives
this way?

1001
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:38,561
I think so.

1002
01:33:38,801 --> 01:33:43,479
But you'd have to ask them.

1003
01:33:48,717 --> 01:33:51,237
Paulette. She was wonderful.

1004
01:33:51,476 --> 01:33:54,315
Her personality, you mean?

1005
01:33:54,555 --> 01:33:57,354
In bed?
- No. Well, that was good.

1006
01:33:57,594 --> 01:33:59,913
She didn't take me for a fortune.

1007
01:34:00,153 --> 01:34:04,512
Let me help you. Come on.

1008
01:34:06,351 --> 01:34:09,470
Okay?

1009
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:17,227
I know you so well. I know you're
thinking of Doug, aren't you?

1010
01:34:17,467 --> 01:34:22,305
I was the only one who knew.

1011
01:34:25,664 --> 01:34:30,462
Don't say I don't look after you.

1012
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:39,619
Mr. Chaplin. Always a pleasure.

1013
01:34:39,859 --> 01:34:41,698
How are you?

1014
01:34:41,938 --> 01:34:43,298
You look even prettier.

1015
01:34:43,538 --> 01:34:47,536
Nobody's fine and everyone needs
a drink. Champagne, scotch?

1016
01:34:47,776 --> 01:34:49,935
Scotch.

1017
01:34:50,175 --> 01:34:51,655
Is he, uh...?

1018
01:34:51,894 --> 01:34:53,574
Yes.

1019
01:34:53,814 --> 01:34:57,013
Seriously?

1020
01:34:57,253 --> 01:35:01,971
His heart.
- Shit.

1021
01:35:07,329 --> 01:35:09,488
Hey. Don't laugh.

1022
01:35:09,728 --> 01:35:12,407
I'm testing for Scarlett.

1023
01:35:12,647 --> 01:35:13,647
Why should I laugh?

1024
01:35:13,886 --> 01:35:17,525
Because it's a joke.
Everyone's testing for Scarlett.

1025
01:35:17,765 --> 01:35:22,084
I hear Katie Hepburn has it locked
away. So they say.

1026
01:35:22,323 --> 01:35:24,523
I haven't worked
since "Modern Times".

1027
01:35:24,763 --> 01:35:26,482
Neither have I.

1028
01:35:26,722 --> 01:35:30,480
No ideas. I'm desperate.

1029
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:34,919
See you later.

1030
01:35:36,998 --> 01:35:38,558
I can manage a double.

1031
01:35:38,797 --> 01:35:40,357
Should you?

1032
01:35:40,597 --> 01:35:45,035
Are you two still married or what?
I find it very confusing.

1033
01:35:45,275 --> 01:35:50,153
When people thought we were having
an affair, we were married.

1034
01:35:50,393 --> 01:35:52,313
Now people know,
we're getting divorced.

1035
01:35:52,552 --> 01:35:56,351
You're a wizard with women,
no question about it.

1036
01:35:56,591 --> 01:35:59,790
Who's that man? Sounds German.
- Looks German.

1037
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:04,628
Probably one of those directors.
Maybe he has a job for me.

1038
01:36:04,868 --> 01:36:09,866
Like Plato, Adolf Hitler is defining
the ideal state to be a model...

1039
01:36:10,106 --> 01:36:11,905
...for backward systems.

1040
01:36:12,145 --> 01:36:14,784
Do you know him?

1041
01:36:15,024 --> 01:36:18,063
I have that good fortune, yes.

1042
01:36:18,303 --> 01:36:20,702
And you have my word.

1043
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:25,261
We only desire to defend our
historical frontiers. That's paramount.

1044
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,100
Told you. Paramount.

1045
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:28,699
It's not funny.

1046
01:36:28,939 --> 01:36:34,177
He merely wants to improve
the situation for the German people.

1047
01:36:34,417 --> 01:36:37,416
How can they let these fascist thugs...

1048
01:36:37,656 --> 01:36:40,975
To cut out the profit speculator.

1049
01:36:41,215 --> 01:36:42,774
The Jew.

1050
01:36:43,014 --> 01:36:48,052
Mr. Chaplin!
I am a great admirer of yours.

1051
01:36:48,292 --> 01:36:52,051
I'm sorry.
I don't shake hands with nazis.

1052
01:36:52,291 --> 01:36:55,809
What have you got against us?

1053
01:36:56,049 --> 01:36:59,568
What have you got
against everyone else?

1054
01:36:59,808 --> 01:37:03,407
You must forgive Mr. Chaplin.
He's a Jew.

1055
01:37:03,647 --> 01:37:05,766
So!

1056
01:37:06,006 --> 01:37:10,644
I'm afraid I don't have that honour.

1057
01:37:10,884 --> 01:37:13,923
Shame on you!

1058
01:37:16,442 --> 01:37:19,961
The former Miss Levy.

1059
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:24,879
Shall we, my dear?

1060
01:37:32,516 --> 01:37:35,035
God bless you, Charlie.

1061
01:37:35,275 --> 01:37:36,635
I'll call you.

1062
01:37:36,874 --> 01:37:40,393
Yes. Please do.

1063
01:37:43,512 --> 01:37:46,591
A fine international incident
you caused!

1064
01:37:46,831 --> 01:37:48,670
Let's go out.

1065
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:52,429
Not tonight, old darling.
I'm a bit tired.

1066
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:57,027
It's funny, you look a lot like him.

1067
01:37:57,267 --> 01:38:01,106
Adolf, I mean.

1068
01:38:03,145 --> 01:38:05,424
With your moustache on.

1069
01:38:05,664 --> 01:38:09,942
I think he stole your act.

1070
01:38:10,382 --> 01:38:13,221
'Night, old boy.

1071
01:38:13,461 --> 01:38:16,860
'Night.

1072
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:20,858
Sweet prince.

1073
01:38:23,697 --> 01:38:26,337
So much ended around then.

1074
01:38:26,576 --> 01:38:29,135
I'd been there 25 years.

1075
01:38:29,375 --> 01:38:32,254
Everyone else had gone over to sound.

1076
01:38:32,494 --> 01:38:37,372
I don't know
if I could resist it much longer.

1077
01:38:37,612 --> 01:38:40,331
Of course, U.A. was over for me.

1078
01:38:40,571 --> 01:38:43,650
United Artists.

1079
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:48,289
You haven't written anything
about how that began.

1080
01:38:48,528 --> 01:38:52,327
I'll put something in.
It was a great idea, I think.

1081
01:38:52,567 --> 01:38:56,406
Creative people had their say
for the first time.

1082
01:38:56,645 --> 01:38:59,085
No milk.

1083
01:38:59,325 --> 01:39:04,523
A distributor said, "The Lunatics
have taken over the asylum".

1084
01:39:04,763 --> 01:39:09,641
That became quite a famous remark.

1085
01:39:14,599 --> 01:39:18,558
But U.A. did mean a lot to Doug.

1086
01:39:18,797 --> 01:39:22,036
When my mother died, it was sad.

1087
01:39:22,276 --> 01:39:26,315
But she was old, she'd had her run.

1088
01:39:26,555 --> 01:39:29,194
It was different with Doug.

1089
01:39:29,434 --> 01:39:33,392
Even today, I still miss him.

1090
01:39:33,632 --> 01:39:38,190
Tell me, when did you start
"The Great Dictator"?

1091
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:40,270
'38.

1092
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:43,708
And everyone thought you were crazy.

1093
01:39:43,948 --> 01:39:48,227
But when the war broke out,
you became a genius.

1094
01:39:48,467 --> 01:39:52,905
Not to those
who thought I was a communist.

1095
01:40:00,462 --> 01:40:05,380
Commen fr der hair-dryen!

1096
01:40:08,779 --> 01:40:14,457
Und lager beer mit pizza parliament!

1097
01:40:19,095 --> 01:40:23,494
Big smile!

1098
01:40:25,693 --> 01:40:30,131
I know you. You bastard.

1099
01:40:31,091 --> 01:40:35,250
Syd? Is that you?

1100
01:40:37,969 --> 01:40:42,887
What's wrong? You wanted to make me
a talkie. Now I'm making a talkie.

1101
01:40:43,127 --> 01:40:47,405
Yeah, but not this.

1102
01:40:49,324 --> 01:40:51,724
I know this man.

1103
01:40:51,964 --> 01:40:56,122
I'm born the same year,
four days apart.

1104
01:40:56,362 --> 01:40:59,361
He's like me, capable of anything.

1105
01:40:59,601 --> 01:41:02,400
Nobody wants to see a film...

1106
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:05,159
...about Adolf fucking Hitler!

1107
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:09,957
I do!

1108
01:41:10,717 --> 01:41:13,236
You're missing the point.

1109
01:41:13,476 --> 01:41:16,675
It's not about Hitler,
it's about the Tramp.

1110
01:41:16,914 --> 01:41:20,393
The little Jewish barber
taking his place.

1111
01:41:20,633 --> 01:41:23,592
What's happening in Europe
is not our problem.

1112
01:41:23,832 --> 01:41:27,031
Ninety percent of the Americans
want to stay out of the war.

1113
01:41:27,271 --> 01:41:31,589
That's nine out of ten!
It's not your business.

1114
01:41:31,829 --> 01:41:34,308
You're a comic.

1115
01:41:34,548 --> 01:41:39,346
Yes, Syd. And you're a Jew.

1116
01:41:45,424 --> 01:41:49,982
Nevertheless, I've got to give it a try.

1117
01:41:50,222 --> 01:41:55,700
Otherwise, what have I been doing
all these years?

1118
01:41:55,940 --> 01:42:00,858
I know talking
will be the end of the Tramp.

1119
01:42:01,098 --> 01:42:06,976
But at least he'll say something
I believe in.

1120
01:42:07,336 --> 01:42:12,054
Okay. We'll see how it goes.

1121
01:42:13,094 --> 01:42:18,132
"The Great Dictator"
Scene y-11-a, take one.

1122
01:42:21,371 --> 01:42:25,010
I'm sorry, but I'm not an emperor.

1123
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:28,009
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

1124
01:42:28,249 --> 01:42:30,568
I'd like to help everyone, if possible.

1125
01:42:30,808 --> 01:42:33,487
Jew, gentile, black man, white.

1126
01:42:33,727 --> 01:42:37,165
We all want to help one another.
People are like that.

1127
01:42:37,405 --> 01:42:40,564
We want to live by each other's
happiness, not misery.

1128
01:42:40,804 --> 01:42:45,442
Greed has poisoned men's souls
and barricaded the world with hate.

1129
01:42:45,682 --> 01:42:48,841
It's goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.

1130
01:42:49,081 --> 01:42:50,600
Do not despair.

1131
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:53,959
The hate of men will pass,
and dictators die.

1132
01:42:54,199 --> 01:42:56,958
He's not talking about Germany...

1133
01:42:57,198 --> 01:43:01,636
He's talking about America.
Turn that damn thing down!

1134
01:43:01,876 --> 01:43:08,354
This is what we need
to make people understand.

1135
01:43:13,592 --> 01:43:17,910
Mr. Seeley,
you're looking a little pale.

1136
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:20,909
You need a trip to California.

1137
01:43:21,149 --> 01:43:22,709
Comrades!

1138
01:43:22,949 --> 01:43:24,828
Let us fight for a new world.

1139
01:43:25,068 --> 01:43:27,547
Commie bastard!

1140
01:43:27,787 --> 01:43:32,865
Soldiers! In the name of democracy,
let us unite!

1141
01:43:34,344 --> 01:43:36,464
What brings you here?

1142
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:40,302
My firm is getting into movies.

1143
01:43:41,342 --> 01:43:46,540
But I really don't know
much about it.

1144
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:52,898
Congratulations on the London opening.

1145
01:43:53,338 --> 01:43:55,697
Tea is on it's way, sir.

1146
01:43:55,937 --> 01:44:00,335
Lovely afternoon, Charlie.

1147
01:44:05,813 --> 01:44:12,211
Women drop handkerchiefs.
Men must drop other things.

1148
01:44:25,086 --> 01:44:29,165
"Upper regional domes
immensely expensive. "

1149
01:44:29,404 --> 01:44:32,643
That's how you describe Joan Barry.

1150
01:44:32,883 --> 01:44:37,402
She was very well-endowed,
is that what you mean?

1151
01:44:37,641 --> 01:44:40,960
You expect people to believe
it wasn't just sex?

1152
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:45,519
Well, I didn't have to put a girl
under contract to sleep with her.

1153
01:44:45,759 --> 01:44:47,518
I spent thousands on her.

1154
01:44:47,758 --> 01:44:49,877
I wrote a screen-play for her.

1155
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:53,916
I don't care what the readers think.
Joan definitely had talent.

1156
01:44:54,155 --> 01:44:58,714
She was intelligent. She was pretty.
She was willing to work hard.

1157
01:44:58,954 --> 01:45:04,032
And the screen test proved
that she was very photogenic.

1158
01:45:04,272 --> 01:45:07,111
But she became erratic.

1159
01:45:07,351 --> 01:45:11,669
For some reason she began
to have some kind of breakdown.

1160
01:45:11,909 --> 01:45:17,227
She took to driving to my house,
drunk, in the middle of the night.

1161
01:45:17,467 --> 01:45:21,785
She was arrested. Made a scene.

1162
01:45:22,025 --> 01:45:26,584
I refused to have anything further
to do with her.

1163
01:45:26,824 --> 01:45:29,782
How could you have been so foolish?

1164
01:45:30,022 --> 01:45:32,621
You took up with a crazy girl...

1165
01:45:32,861 --> 01:45:35,700
A promiscuous, vengeful liar.

1166
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:40,099
And for the first time,
you didn't propose marriage.

1167
01:45:40,339 --> 01:45:43,058
Hoover had kept tabs on you
for 20 years.

1168
01:45:43,298 --> 01:45:46,017
And he still couldn't nail you until...

1169
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:51,774
...you played it right into his hands
by shutting Joan out.

1170
01:45:53,774 --> 01:45:55,453
You're improving.

1171
01:45:55,693 --> 01:45:58,052
Can't you find someone else
to play with?

1172
01:45:58,292 --> 01:46:02,691
Apparently not. Not anymore.

1173
01:46:02,770 --> 01:46:04,170
Who's that?

1174
01:46:04,410 --> 01:46:06,089
The debutante.

1175
01:46:06,329 --> 01:46:08,448
You're doing a favour for her agent.

1176
01:46:08,688 --> 01:46:12,407
Not another one who wants to act.
It's endless.

1177
01:46:12,647 --> 01:46:14,726
This is the last time.

1178
01:46:14,966 --> 01:46:19,484
They think it's so easy. I bet as
a child, she wanted to be a fireman.

1179
01:46:19,724 --> 01:46:23,043
In half an hour, say I have an
appointment. Someone important.

1180
01:46:23,283 --> 01:46:24,563
Leave it to me.

1181
01:46:24,802 --> 01:46:27,801
Mr. Chaplin?

1182
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:32,200
I'm Oona O'Neill.

1183
01:46:33,399 --> 01:46:36,518
If I'm interrupting your game,
I can always come back...

1184
01:46:36,758 --> 01:46:39,197
No. No.

1185
01:46:39,437 --> 01:46:43,636
I was waiting for you.

1186
01:46:46,914 --> 01:46:50,593
I always have tea at 4:00.
How long have you been here?

1187
01:46:50,833 --> 01:46:53,432
Just this summer.

1188
01:46:53,672 --> 01:46:57,591
My agent got me
a screen test at Fox.

1189
01:46:57,830 --> 01:47:00,789
Will they give you a contract?

1190
01:47:01,029 --> 01:47:04,068
I don't know.

1191
01:47:04,308 --> 01:47:07,347
Will you tell me?

1192
01:47:07,587 --> 01:47:10,146
Yes, if you want me to.

1193
01:47:10,386 --> 01:47:11,985
Charlie!

1194
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:16,024
Excuse me.
It's nearly time for your appointment.

1195
01:47:16,264 --> 01:47:19,383
Appointment?

1196
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:26,300
Who's it with?

1197
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:28,299
Uh, Fred.

1198
01:47:28,539 --> 01:47:30,339
Fred.

1199
01:47:30,579 --> 01:47:32,618
Not Astaire again.

1200
01:47:32,858 --> 01:47:34,217
That's right.

1201
01:47:34,457 --> 01:47:35,777
And Ginger?

1202
01:47:36,017 --> 01:47:37,896
Could be.

1203
01:47:38,136 --> 01:47:40,175
I'm sick of them.

1204
01:47:40,415 --> 01:47:44,573
I'm not teaching them any more.
Let them make it on their own.

1205
01:47:44,813 --> 01:47:48,372
Right.

1206
01:47:50,491 --> 01:47:55,849
Sorry. I asked him to interrupt
in case I was...

1207
01:47:56,089 --> 01:48:00,608
I mean, in case you were...

1208
01:48:03,886 --> 01:48:07,965
I've never been to England.

1209
01:48:54,748 --> 01:48:57,587
All proceeds from tonight's world
premiere...

1210
01:48:57,827 --> 01:49:02,505
...will benefit families of American
soldiers serving overseas.

1211
01:49:05,944 --> 01:49:09,343
George, I've written this for the end.

1212
01:49:09,583 --> 01:49:13,381
For the last 20 years,
I have known happiness.

1213
01:49:13,621 --> 01:49:17,780
I wish I could write more about this.
But, it involves love.

1214
01:49:18,019 --> 01:49:21,578
Perfect love is the most beautiful
of all frustrations.

1215
01:49:21,818 --> 01:49:25,977
Because it is more
than one can express.

1216
01:49:26,217 --> 01:49:29,455
Excuse me, sir.

1217
01:49:29,495 --> 01:49:31,215
Sorry for the intrusion.

1218
01:49:31,455 --> 01:49:35,253
It's all right. Come in.

1219
01:49:37,932 --> 01:49:39,892
What is it?

1220
01:49:40,131 --> 01:49:43,610
I just took a call from Miss Barry, sir.

1221
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:49,048
She wanted me to tell you
that she's pregnant.

1222
01:50:02,003 --> 01:50:03,203
Where's Charles?

1223
01:50:03,443 --> 01:50:06,522
With Harry.

1224
01:50:06,802 --> 01:50:09,801
He may be on the stage by now.

1225
01:50:10,041 --> 01:50:13,639
Is Charles down there?

1226
01:50:20,077 --> 01:50:24,715
She'll drop the paternity suit.
Her lawyers said she'll settle.

1227
01:50:24,955 --> 01:50:28,594
No. What? Just listen.

1228
01:50:28,834 --> 01:50:33,192
She'll take $ 150,000.
That's nothing, compared to a trial.

1229
01:50:33,432 --> 01:50:38,390
She says you did it at Christmas
when she came to your house.

1230
01:50:38,630 --> 01:50:42,229
I've never made you a deal
this good, kid.

1231
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:46,147
It was over before Christmas.
It's not my child.

1232
01:50:46,387 --> 01:50:47,427
It'll be out of the way.

1233
01:50:47,667 --> 01:50:51,745
I can't do that. I've got Oona to think of.
I must prove my innocence.

1234
01:50:51,985 --> 01:50:57,863
I'm all for proving your innocence,
but how?

1235
01:50:59,223 --> 01:51:02,222
Go back to them.

1236
01:51:02,461 --> 01:51:04,381
I beg you.

1237
01:51:04,621 --> 01:51:07,420
Get them to agree to a blood test.

1238
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:10,659
So that night you went to his house...

1239
01:51:10,898 --> 01:51:15,617
...did you and Mr. Chaplin
have sexual relations?

1240
01:51:15,857 --> 01:51:18,296
Doesn't it look like it?

1241
01:51:18,536 --> 01:51:21,655
Never mind what it looks like.
Did you?

1242
01:51:21,894 --> 01:51:27,412
She said she did.
Why else agree to a blood test?

1243
01:51:27,692 --> 01:51:31,131
The next morning,
he just called a cab.

1244
01:51:31,371 --> 01:51:35,130
Paid me off.

1245
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:40,728
He wanted somebody younger.
Classier.

1246
01:51:40,967 --> 01:51:44,006
Didn't he?

1247
01:52:07,078 --> 01:52:09,917
Yes, thank you.

1248
01:52:10,157 --> 01:52:12,316
It's all over.

1249
01:52:12,556 --> 01:52:17,754
The test proved it's not my baby.

1250
01:52:23,632 --> 01:52:26,751
Let's just forget all this new-fangled
rubbish about blood-tests.

1251
01:52:26,991 --> 01:52:31,189
Put it out of our minds.
His honour has ruled them...

1252
01:52:31,429 --> 01:52:33,708
...inadmissible.

1253
01:52:33,948 --> 01:52:37,427
What matters now is the financial
future of this poor child.

1254
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:41,226
It is her future
the State is here to protect.

1255
01:52:41,465 --> 01:52:43,785
It makes me mad...

1256
01:52:44,025 --> 01:52:47,063
...how this fellow tries to put it
over us simpletons.

1257
01:52:47,303 --> 01:52:49,023
This great star...

1258
01:52:49,263 --> 01:52:50,982
...of stage and screen...

1259
01:52:51,222 --> 01:52:53,661
...who has enjoyed our hospitality
for 30 years without...

1260
01:52:53,901 --> 01:52:59,979
...applying for American citizenship.

1261
01:53:00,499 --> 01:53:03,418
But what good has his money done
Chaplin?

1262
01:53:03,657 --> 01:53:06,097
Wasting his time debauching girls.

1263
01:53:06,336 --> 01:53:08,536
What good has it done America?

1264
01:53:08,776 --> 01:53:12,814
This is the kind of stuff
that makes for communism.

1265
01:53:13,054 --> 01:53:14,893
Now my client...

1266
01:53:15,133 --> 01:53:17,612
...on the other hand...

1267
01:53:17,852 --> 01:53:19,971
...is, alas...

1268
01:53:20,211 --> 01:53:23,850
...no more moral than Chaplin.

1269
01:53:24,090 --> 01:53:28,728
Ah, yes. Yes.
They're both equally guilty.

1270
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:32,967
Only Chaplin is old enough
to be her father.

1271
01:53:33,207 --> 01:53:34,966
Prowling around with girls.

1272
01:53:35,206 --> 01:53:41,404
Members of the jury, use your common
sense, and just look at this man.

1273
01:53:41,644 --> 01:53:46,482
This cheap, Cockney cad.

1274
01:53:47,122 --> 01:53:50,041
This...

1275
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:53,679
...little tramp.

1276
01:53:53,919 --> 01:53:56,998
Then take a very good look at...

1277
01:53:57,238 --> 01:54:01,316
...innocent Carol Ann.

1278
01:54:01,356 --> 01:54:04,635
I defy you not to see
the resemblance.

1279
01:54:04,875 --> 01:54:09,913
Gentlemen an ladies... wives and
mothers everywhere are watching you.

1280
01:54:10,153 --> 01:54:14,712
Watching to see you stop Chaplin
in his tracks.

1281
01:54:14,951 --> 01:54:20,030
You'll sleep well the night
you give this baby a name.

1282
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:22,949
The night you show this lecher...

1283
01:54:23,188 --> 01:54:29,426
...the law means him
as well as the bums on skid row.

1284
01:54:29,466 --> 01:54:32,585
GUILTY!
Chaplin Baby Gets $75 a week

1285
01:54:32,825 --> 01:54:36,064
CHAPLIN MUST SUPPORT BABY

1286
01:54:38,103 --> 01:54:40,862
Chaplin Faces Call In Red Inquiry

1287
01:54:41,102 --> 01:54:43,981
Drive to Bar Reds Stirred
by Attack on Chaplin

1288
01:54:44,221 --> 01:54:46,260
Chaplin Joins
Red-Organized Peace Group

1289
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:47,860
Not a Red, Chaplin Says

1290
01:54:48,099 --> 01:54:52,018
CHAPLIN FINISHES "LIMELIGHT"

1291
01:54:53,218 --> 01:54:56,696
It's a star-studded evening here.

1292
01:54:57,536 --> 01:55:03,454
Here is Charlie Chaplin
with his lovely wife, Oona.

1293
01:55:30,404 --> 01:55:32,683
Are you a communist, Mr. Chaplin?

1294
01:55:32,923 --> 01:55:35,482
Are you a fellow traveller?

1295
01:55:35,722 --> 01:55:38,761
Will you attend
the McCarthy hearings?

1296
01:55:39,001 --> 01:55:41,280
Gentlemen, please.

1297
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:46,918
Mr. Chaplin has said he will go
whenever he is called.

1298
01:55:47,878 --> 01:55:49,597
Senator Joseph McCarthy

1299
01:55:49,837 --> 01:55:51,196
Even if there's one communist...

1300
01:55:51,436 --> 01:55:55,395
...in the state department...

1301
01:55:55,635 --> 01:56:00,673
...that would still be
one communist too many.

1302
01:56:00,793 --> 01:56:03,832
Mr. Lawson, are you now
or have you ever been...

1303
01:56:04,072 --> 01:56:08,190
...a member of the communist party?

1304
01:56:16,547 --> 01:56:19,746
I'm responding in the only way
in which any American...

1305
01:56:19,986 --> 01:56:22,345
...can respond to a question
which absolutely invades...

1306
01:56:22,585 --> 01:56:27,103
Then you refuse to answer, correct?

1307
01:56:27,343 --> 01:56:30,382
I have said I will offer my beliefs...

1308
01:56:30,622 --> 01:56:32,941
Stand away from the stand.

1309
01:56:33,181 --> 01:56:34,741
Stand away from the stand!

1310
01:56:34,981 --> 01:56:39,779
I am fighting for the Bill of Rights!

1311
01:56:46,936 --> 01:56:50,135
I'd love to get away for a while.

1312
01:56:50,375 --> 01:56:55,653
Maybe after this bundle arrives,
we could go.

1313
01:57:05,889 --> 01:57:08,728
Sir.

1314
01:57:10,248 --> 01:57:16,565
We just got word.
Chaplin left for London on vacation.

1315
01:57:41,476 --> 01:57:42,636
Where's Mr. Chaplin?

1316
01:57:42,876 --> 01:57:45,155
We left him at the stern.

1317
01:57:45,395 --> 01:57:48,914
It's all right, darling.

1318
01:58:02,389 --> 01:58:07,347
What is it, sweetheart?

1319
01:58:07,867 --> 01:58:11,306
Is it Syd?

1320
01:58:11,985 --> 01:58:15,184
What is it?

1321
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:21,182
They've thrown you out.

1322
01:58:21,422 --> 01:58:26,460
Thrown me out?
Thrown me out of what?

1323
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:31,298
Of America.

1324
01:58:33,058 --> 01:58:36,936
I'm so sorry.

1325
01:58:39,895 --> 01:58:44,134
I can't go back.

1326
01:58:53,130 --> 01:58:57,609
There are nights when it's still hard
being in exile.

1327
01:58:57,849 --> 01:59:02,087
They surely wouldn't refuse you a
visa now. Thought of going back?

1328
01:59:02,327 --> 01:59:05,006
Let's go in.
- I have everything I need here.

1329
01:59:05,246 --> 01:59:07,165
It's cold.
- I like the cold.

1330
01:59:07,405 --> 01:59:08,525
I must go away.

1331
01:59:08,765 --> 01:59:09,604
I must go anyway.

1332
01:59:09,844 --> 01:59:13,243
The telephone!
- I heard it ringing, thank you.

1333
01:59:13,483 --> 01:59:19,081
No, George, in answer to your
question. I'm used to invitations.

1334
01:59:19,321 --> 01:59:21,840
It's been a long day.

1335
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,519
You must be very tired.

1336
01:59:24,759 --> 01:59:27,438
Come on, George, finish it off.

1337
01:59:27,678 --> 01:59:29,917
The question mark.

1338
01:59:30,157 --> 01:59:32,236
What is it?

1339
01:59:32,476 --> 01:59:36,435
You mean that?

1340
01:59:37,954 --> 01:59:41,313
It was a personal matter.
Nothing relevant.

1341
01:59:41,553 --> 01:59:43,712
Tell me.

1342
01:59:43,952 --> 01:59:46,951
Okay.

1343
01:59:47,271 --> 01:59:49,350
The madness.

1344
01:59:49,590 --> 01:59:54,348
I wondered,
how much did it affect you?

1345
01:59:54,588 --> 01:59:57,307
What makes you think it did?

1346
01:59:57,547 --> 02:00:00,106
Your mother was certified insane,
and...

1347
02:00:00,346 --> 02:00:05,824
...your grandmother was as well,
and, uh...

1348
02:00:05,984 --> 02:00:11,742
That's not what dogged me, George.
It wasn't that.

1349
02:00:14,621 --> 02:00:16,500
It was...

1350
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:21,618
...the knowledge that if you did what
I did, if you were a clown.

1351
02:00:21,858 --> 02:00:26,176
And you had passion to tell
a particular story...

1352
02:00:26,416 --> 02:00:30,495
...something...

1353
02:00:32,854 --> 02:00:35,413
...beyond.

1354
02:00:35,653 --> 02:00:37,852
You only had one chance
to get it right.

1355
02:00:38,092 --> 02:00:39,692
And I never did.

1356
02:00:39,931 --> 02:00:42,930
One never does. But you know that.

1357
02:00:43,170 --> 02:00:48,049
That's not the problem.

1358
02:00:51,967 --> 02:00:55,966
It's when you feel you're
getting close...

1359
02:00:56,206 --> 02:00:58,685
...but you can't make it.

1360
02:00:58,925 --> 02:01:02,923
You're not good enough.
You're not complete enough.

1361
02:01:03,163 --> 02:01:06,402
And despite all your fantasies...

1362
02:01:06,642 --> 02:01:09,001
...you're second-rate.

1363
02:01:09,241 --> 02:01:12,560
It's human.

1364
02:01:13,719 --> 02:01:17,758
And it's very hard.

1365
02:01:20,357 --> 02:01:21,956
Why not add that?

1366
02:01:22,196 --> 02:01:25,035
It's not important, really.

1367
02:01:25,275 --> 02:01:30,553
Ultimately, you're judged by what
you did, not what you didn't do.

1368
02:01:30,793 --> 02:01:34,752
And I didn't change things, I just...

1369
02:01:34,991 --> 02:01:38,550
...he just...

1370
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:42,229
...cheered people up.

1371
02:01:42,469 --> 02:01:45,708
Not bad, that.

1372
02:02:28,572 --> 02:02:31,691
Charlie?

1373
02:02:35,409 --> 02:02:37,049
Charlie, dear.

1374
02:02:37,289 --> 02:02:40,808
I dreamed I was answering
questions for George. Silly.

1375
02:02:41,047 --> 02:02:46,046
California called again.
You have to give them an answer.

1376
02:02:46,286 --> 02:02:49,484
They took 20 years to decide,
I can take another afternoon.

1377
02:02:49,724 --> 02:02:53,603
Enough. Enough!

1378
02:03:07,558 --> 02:03:12,516
From Los Angeles, the 44th annual
Academy Awards Presentation.

1379
02:03:26,871 --> 02:03:29,270
Suppose they start throwing things.

1380
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:31,029
Now that would be a story.

1381
02:03:31,269 --> 02:03:34,148
You never know... on the stage.

1382
02:03:34,388 --> 02:03:38,067
I can see the headlines:
"Amazing incident at Academy Awards".

1383
02:03:38,307 --> 02:03:42,985
"Chaplin Disappears under
Avalanche of Oscars".

1384
02:03:43,225 --> 02:03:45,984
Look, it's Walter.

1385
02:03:46,224 --> 02:03:48,103
Does that make you happy?

1386
02:03:48,343 --> 02:03:51,542
No.
- Crabby.

1387
02:03:51,782 --> 02:03:54,741
I shouldn't have let them show
film clips.

1388
02:03:54,981 --> 02:03:57,859
People will think they're old.

1389
02:03:58,099 --> 02:04:03,697
They are old.
Well over 50 years, some of them.

1390
02:04:03,857 --> 02:04:08,016
You know the worst thing
about age is...

1391
02:04:08,256 --> 02:04:11,694
...you can't defend yourself.

1392
02:04:11,934 --> 02:04:17,252
When I was young and handsome
and had my power...

1393
02:04:17,492 --> 02:04:19,572
...I'd make a movie...

1394
02:04:19,811 --> 02:04:24,410
...and make them laugh
and make them cry.

1395
02:04:24,650 --> 02:04:27,849
Now I'm at their mercy.

1396
02:04:28,088 --> 02:04:31,087
Come in.
- Go away.

1397
02:04:31,327 --> 02:04:35,806
We're ready for you, Mr. Chaplin.

1398
02:04:36,046 --> 02:04:38,125
Behave yourself.

1399
02:04:38,365 --> 02:04:41,883
Now the President of the Academy,
Mr. Daniel Taradash.

1400
02:04:42,123 --> 02:04:45,362
Remember the President
of the Academy, Daniel Taradash.

1401
02:04:45,602 --> 02:04:48,921
Taradash? Sounds like a spice.

1402
02:04:49,161 --> 02:04:52,400
The inscription reads:
"To Charles Chaplin...

1403
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:55,958
...for the incalculable effect
he had making motion picture...

1404
02:04:56,198 --> 02:05:00,837
...the art form of this century. "

1405
02:05:01,076 --> 02:05:03,875
"Humour heightens our sense
of survival...

1406
02:05:04,115 --> 02:05:06,395
...and preserves our sanity. "

1407
02:05:06,634 --> 02:05:09,114
The words of Charlie Chaplin.

1408
02:05:09,353 --> 02:05:12,952
The abiding elements of Chaplin's
artistic conscience...

1409
02:05:13,192 --> 02:05:15,911
...as actor, writer, director, and...

1410
02:05:16,151 --> 02:05:19,830
...to quote W. C. Fields,
"greatest ballet dancer who ever lived".

1411
02:05:20,070 --> 02:05:22,509
A few years ago, Mr. Chaplin said:

1412
02:05:22,749 --> 02:05:26,067
"My only enemy is time. "

1413
02:05:26,307 --> 02:05:28,427
We respectfully disagree.

1414
02:05:28,666 --> 02:05:30,706
I'm leaving you here, darling.

1415
02:05:30,946 --> 02:05:37,183
My white dress... They mustn't
see anyone until the clips are over.

1416
02:05:37,623 --> 02:05:45,580
Time is Charlie Chaplin's dearest
and eternal friend.

1417
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:47,779
Here is the proof.

1418
02:05:48,019 --> 02:05:53,937
Watch... remember... rejoice.

1419
02:10:51,069 --> 02:10:55,588
The End

1420
02:11:02,185 --> 02:11:05,904
Charles Spencer Chaplin accepted
his Special Academy Award.

1421
02:11:06,144 --> 02:11:10,782
Days later, he left Hollywood
and returned to Switzerland.

1422
02:11:11,022 --> 02:11:14,980
In 1975 Charlie
became sir Charles Chaplin...

1423
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:20,099
...receiving his knighthood
from Queen Elizabeth in London.

1424
02:11:20,179 --> 02:11:24,377
During a 54-years career, Charlie
made 81 films. Five were talkies...

1425
02:11:24,617 --> 02:11:28,775
...67 where completed
before his 30th birthday.

1426
02:11:29,015 --> 02:11:32,814
Charlie died, aged 88,
on Christmas Day 1977 at his home...

1427
02:11:33,054 --> 02:11:36,933
...surrounded by Oona,
their children and grandchildren.

1428
02:11:37,172 --> 02:11:41,371
Hannah Chaplin, Charlie's mother,
spent the last 7 years of her life...

1429
02:11:41,611 --> 02:11:47,289
...in the house Charlie bought for her.

1430
02:11:48,048 --> 02:11:52,047
Sydney Chaplin retired to France
and spent summers at Charlie's home...

1431
02:11:52,287 --> 02:11:57,205
...in Switzerland.
He died on Charlie's 76th birthday.

1432
02:11:57,485 --> 02:12:01,044
Fred Karno, who gave Charlie
his first job, went bankrupt in 1926.

1433
02:12:01,284 --> 02:12:05,722
He died penniless 15 years later.

1434
02:12:05,922 --> 02:12:09,001
Hetty Kelly, Charlie's first love,
married a politician and died at 25.

1435
02:12:09,241 --> 02:12:14,679
She was the inspiration for many
of Charlie's screen heroines.

1436
02:12:14,919 --> 02:12:18,637
George Hayden
is a fictional character.

1437
02:12:18,877 --> 02:12:24,275
Charlie wrote "My Autobiography",
on which this film is partly based.

1438
02:12:24,795 --> 02:12:28,554
Mack Sennett's reign as the king
of comedy ended with the talkies.

1439
02:12:28,794 --> 02:12:33,952
He received a Special Oscar in 1937.

1440
02:12:34,552 --> 02:12:38,270
Mabel Normand was involved
in a drug and sex scandal...

1441
02:12:38,510 --> 02:12:41,909
...surrounding a murder in 1922.
She never acted again.
