- [Muttering, Chuckling]
- [Knocking]

2
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:02,110
- [Radar] Colonel?
- [Chuckling Continues]

3
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,280
Good, I'm glad you're awake.

4
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,358
Sir, I hate to interrupt you...

5
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,427
while you're in a good mood,
but...

6
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,223
- Colonel? Ohh!
- [Shouting] Oh! What the...

7
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,560
- Ohh, Radar!
- Sir, I'm sorry.

8
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:17,363
- I thought you were awake. I heard you laughing.
- Laughing?

9
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,438
Oh, yeah. Heh!

10
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:23,975
I dreamt I came home from the war,
and there... there was Mildred...

11
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:26,636
wearing Hunnicutt's mustache.

12
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:29,806
- Why would you be laughing?
- Because it tickled.

13
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,282
Is this important, or are you
just going around waking people?

14
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,649
No, there's a phone call.
It's "l" Corps. General Imbrie.

15
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:38,520
Bill Imbrie?
What's that old windbag doin' in-country?

16
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:41,821
- I don't know.
You could always ask the old windbag.
- Zip it, sonny.

17
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:44,192
Right.

18
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:46,595
Maybe if Mildred waxed it.

19
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:50,363
[Wheezing]

20
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:53,565
[Coughing, Snorting]

21
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:58,076
[Mutters]
Oh, dear.

22
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:02,705
[Groans]
If only I could breathe.

23
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:05,443
Oh, if only I could sleep.

24
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:09,043
Why should you rest when my sinuses
are pounding out the "Anvil Chorus"?

25
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:12,147
Charles, you're blowing
a good night's sleep for us all.

26
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:15,386
Drip, drip, drip.

27
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:17,962
This is making a shambles of my throat.

28
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:21,090
- [Clattering]
- Now what?

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,294
- [Gargling]
- Oh, good. He's drowning.

30
00:02:24,403 --> 00:02:26,530
Evening, boys.

31
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,040
Same to you, Winchester.
You're just the man I want to see.

32
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:33,475
- Can you see him outside?
- You'll want to hear this too.

33
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:38,642
There's been a big shake-up at "l" Corps.
General Imbrie has replaced General Hammond...

34
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:43,085
and Imbrie wants a powwow with all
the major officers in his command tomorrow.

35
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:46,818
That's fascinating, Colonel,
especially at this hour of the night.

36
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:51,158
What makes you think I could find
this of the remotest possible interest?

37
00:02:51,263 --> 00:02:53,629
Just this, Senor Hoity-toity.

38
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:59,296
As of 0600, I will be en route to Seoul,
and you will be interim commander of this post.

39
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:02,806
- Congratulations.
- Charles in command?

40
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:05,809
That's like giving
Captain Bligh his own fleet.

41
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:08,903
Colonel, I'm touched that you thought of me,
but it's out of the question.

42
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:11,142
It wasn't an offer; it was an order.

43
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,912
And under ordinary circumstances
I would be happy to comply...

44
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,648
but my sinuses are clogged,
and they're ready to burst.

45
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:19,281
- Here. Feel that. Feel that right there. Feel...
- Ehh! Major!

46
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:22,020
We don't know each other that well.

47
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:25,029
All right, Winchester.
You're off the hook.

48
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:28,225
- Pierce, you're temporary C.O.
- I'm who?

49
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:32,668
- There goes the war.
- Oh, no! No, you don't! I'm unfit for command.

50
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:35,070
- You have a cold? Hangnail? Warts?
- And scurvy.

51
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,142
- You're still it.
- What about B.J.?

52
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,211
- I don't want it.
- That's good enough for me.

53
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,506
- What?
- You've got seniority, Pierce.

54
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:44,981
But I'm a coward.
My insignia is a cringing chicken.

55
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:49,544
- I don't know how to give orders.
- That's all right. No one around
here knows how to take 'em.

56
00:03:49,655 --> 00:03:53,614
Don't worry.
Radar knows the routine.

57
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,921
- Colonel, how long will you be gone?
- No idea.

58
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,155
I've seen these things
take an hour or three days.

59
00:03:58,264 --> 00:04:01,256
- We'll leave a marker where the camp was.
- Get some sleep, Commander.

60
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:04,530
0600 gets here early.
Night, boys.

61
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:08,733
- [Hacking]
- Courage, Camille.

62
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:11,435
- Hawk, I'm truly happy for you.
- So am I.

63
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:14,672
It's like one of those westerns
where the town drunk becomes sheriff.

64
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,840
All right, here's my first command.
You, bubble-cheeks.

65
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,852
Get your steam room and your gargle
out of here and into post-op on the double!

66
00:04:21,954 --> 00:04:24,479
- I will not.
- You will for your commander!

67
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,286
Ten-hut! Hut, hut, hut,
hut, hut, hut, hut!

68
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:30,419
- I will to get away from my commander.
- Good! Left, left! Right, right!

69
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:34,625
Left, left! Right, right!
Well, that wasn't so bad.

70
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,535
[Whistling]

71
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:41,367
- [Groans]
- Ah, welcome to your new job, sir.

72
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:46,002
Now I know why they shoot people at sunrise.
Who wants to live at 6:00 in the morning?

73
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:49,309
- Hey, Hawkeye, you're not even dressed.
- I have my bars on, don't I?

74
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,440
I know, but it doesn't look good...
you know, for the guys.

75
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,611
- From now on,
I want the middle of this desk kept clear.
- Hey!

76
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:59,817
Don't disturb me until lunch.
Lunch is disturbing enough.

77
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,588
How am I doing so far?
Thank you.

78
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:06,961
Come on. Will you please be serious once?
We've got work to do here.

79
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,933
All right. The first order
of the day is a drink.

80
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:12,868
- Where's the key?
- With the colonel, I'm happy to say.

81
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:15,702
Potter took the key?
He doesn't trust me?

82
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:17,901
Well, if you were him
and he was you, would you?

83
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,444
That's catchy.
Set that to music right away.

84
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:22,946
Radar, cut an order.

85
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:25,915
"Cut an order."
That's pretty good.

86
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:30,955
- The Officers Club bar
will remain open daily from 0500.
- 0500.

87
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:33,183
And it will never close.

88
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:37,819
- Corporal Klinger reporting as ordered, sir.
- Who ordered you?

89
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,831
My sense of duty, sir.
A soldier's intuition that his new commandant...

90
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:43,766
- would like to know how
that soldier feels about him.
- Oh, boy.

91
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,996
And I feel just great, sir...

92
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:49,233
knowing at last there's somebody
behind this desk who understands.

93
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:52,242
- Klinger...
- Have I told you lately how
splendid you're looking, sir?

94
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:55,074
Did I say splendid?
Handsome is the word.

95
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:58,912
- Oh, boy, you could cut it with a fork.
- Oh, you were built for command.

96
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:03,216
Those shoulders, broad enough for four stars.
That height. Commanders should be tall.

97
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:07,122
- Look down on his men.
- Napoleon didn't do so bad.

98
00:06:07,226 --> 00:06:10,559
Klinger, I'm afraid it is not within my purview
to grant you a discharge.

99
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:13,757
I know that, sir.
But you do have the authority.

100
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:16,027
Let me put it another way:
I'm not allowed.

101
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:21,334
Good try though. It shows initiative,
persistence and a total grasp of unreality.

102
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,601
- Does this mean you won't?
- In spades.

103
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:28,043
I should've known.
The higher the brass, the lower the class.

104
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:31,548
Sorry, sir. That's just the way I see it.
I look forward to your demotion, sir.

105
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,584
That makes two of us.

106
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:36,246
My door is always closed.

107
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,619
Would you like to look at
the duty roster now, sir?

108
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:41,158
You know what's wrong with this job?
I'm too accessible.

109
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,388
From now on, I want a 24-hour palace guard
outside these doors.

110
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,623
Would you like to look at
the duty roster now, sir?

111
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:49,701
Also, I want a peasant costume
so I can slip in amongst my subjects...

112
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:52,771
- and find out what they're saying about me.
- Hawkeye, you gotta sign this!

113
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,998
- You sign it.
- That's forgery!

114
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:57,166
Well, forge ahead, Corporal.
Good night.

115
00:06:57,276 --> 00:07:00,473
Margaret, I'm out of water.

116
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:02,479
- And you want me to get you some.
- Please?

117
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:05,015
Forget it. There are real patients here
with real problems.

118
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:07,085
They're wounded. I'm sick.

119
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:10,519
I'll be by later with a fresh pacifier.

120
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:14,582
Webster, Webster.
Oh, yes. I loved your book...

121
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,184
especially the chase scene
where "L" was following "K."

122
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:21,255
You're doing just fine...
so fine that you won't need this drain anymore.

123
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,767
You're gonna take it out?
Here? Now?

124
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:25,962
And it won't hurt a bit.

125
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,438
Doc, could you give me something?
I don't want to see.

126
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,374
- Too late. It's already out.
- Oh, really?

127
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:34,673
Good. Boy, was I scared.

128
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,181
- Now I just have to take out a couple of stitches.
- Oh, no.

129
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:40,775
- Klinger. More water.
- I'm a little busy, Major.

130
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:45,687
- Now, you insubordinate desert riff.
- Riff?

131
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:50,319
With all due respect, sir,
may a pregnant camel give birth in your bunk.

132
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:54,126
Levantine thug!
[Wheezing]

133
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:56,701
- Doc...
- Whoa. Take it easy, Webster.
I'll be finished in a second.

134
00:07:56,802 --> 00:07:59,202
Will someone please
bring me some water?

135
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:02,240
Klinger, get that wheelchair
over here and roll him out of here.

136
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:05,105
Your command is my wish,
0 Temporary King of the Hill.

137
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,644
Come, second banana.
Into the chair.

138
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:11,580
Pierce, you order me in,
you order me out.

139
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:13,982
[Wheezes]
Make up your mind. Where do you want me?

140
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:16,054
Black Hole of Calcutta
and step on it.

141
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:18,282
My flag is down, sir.

142
00:08:19,558 --> 00:08:21,458
Despot!

143
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,960
- Excuse me, sir, I hate to bother you...
- Then don't.

144
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,258
Uh, just-just, easy now.
I'm almost there.

145
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:29,129
Sir, you haven't done your status reports.
Every morning you gotta fill out...

146
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:32,032
- your DD-5 and your DD-5-As.
- I DD-do?

147
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,765
Unless you fill out
your DD-5-As from the day before.

148
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:37,364
Radar, put all that garbage on my desk.
I'll ignore it later.

149
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:42,413
- The pile on your desk is almost as high as me.
- Well, how bad can that be?

150
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:47,513
- Uh, Hawkeye?
- Whoever said it was lonely at the top?

151
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:50,179
- All right, Father. What's your problem?
- Uh, well, uh...

152
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:53,690
The fact of the matter is...
You see, uh... You look busy.

153
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:56,590
- I am! What do you want?
- I don't want to sound critical.

154
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:58,856
I mean, after all,
you are new at the job.

155
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:01,592
Still, it is turning colder,
and we do need them.

156
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,760
- And now seems as good a time as any to...
- Need what?

157
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,634
Blankets. We're low on blankets.

158
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,868
Every time we send a man back to Seoul,
he goes in a blanket.

159
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:14,537
Sure. They send the soldiers back here,
but never the blankets.

160
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:16,944
- Eh.
- All right, Father. I'll get right to it.

161
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,483
The temperature's supposed to
drop down 20 degrees tonight.

162
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:23,521
- Okay, okay.
- Remember, my son, patience is a virtue.

163
00:09:23,622 --> 00:09:27,718
- And you're taxing my virtue.
- But you will get right on it, won't you?

164
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:30,795
[Hawkeye]
Are you telling me I don't get the blankets...

165
00:09:30,896 --> 00:09:33,262
until I fill out the requisitions?

166
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,027
Look, Major, we're pretty cold up here.

167
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:38,228
I'll fill 'em out right away.

168
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:40,328
Plus what else?

169
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:42,634
Oh, yeah. The DD-5-Ds.

170
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:45,266
- Center pile.
- Right. Those are in the mail.

171
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,971
Hey, you can't lie to "l" Corps!

172
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,346
Now, what about those blankets?
Look, I'm the commanding officer here...

173
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:57,115
and I'm not sending anything else out
until I see those blankets, and that's final!

174
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,884
All right! Don't yell!
You'll get your requisitions.

175
00:09:59,992 --> 00:10:03,860
Let's not get into a snit.
You'll drive yourself into a perfect tizzy.

176
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:06,157
Bye.

177
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:09,666
I tell ya... if I weren't the boss here,
I would've told that guy off.

178
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:11,827
Welcome to the trenches, sir.

179
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:14,303
This wouldn't have happened
if you'd handed me these things...

180
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,306
instead of piling them on my desk.

181
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,241
- You told me to pile them on your desk!
- Well, don't listen to me.

182
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:22,108
Boy, I hate breaking in a new man!

183
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:28,176
- Howdy, chief.
- Whatever you want, you got it.

184
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:31,586
- Just allow three days for paperwork.
- I just wanted to say hello.

185
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,557
- In that case, two days.
- In your honor, sir. A new delicacy...

186
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,620
- chicken à la commandant.
- With all the temporary power vested in me,
no discharge.

187
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:43,827
Before you say no, sir, please,
try the commandant sauce... dress green.

188
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:47,472
Kellye, I gotta get off tonight.

189
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:50,701
- Take my late duty and then
I'll take yours tomorrow night.
- Yeah, sure, no problem.

190
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:54,176
Baker, you can't trade shifts for tomorrow night.
You've already got a shift... mine.

191
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,247
I worked yours last Thursday.

192
00:10:56,348 --> 00:10:59,681
[Overlapping Chatter]

193
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:03,243
- No, it doesn't! You said you would work mine...
- Nurses, what's the problem here?

194
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:05,721
[Chattering Continues]

195
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:08,952
All right, all right. At ease.
I'll settle this right now.

196
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,621
As of now,
there'll be no more trading off of shifts.

197
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,632
- The duty roster is the final word.
- [Chattering]

198
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:18,703
- The final word!
- Hello, I'm your commanding officer,
and I must warn you...

199
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,433
if this arguing keeps up, you'll all be
confined to my quarters one at a time.

200
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:26,773
Excuse me, Commander.
These are my nurses, and I'll handle the situation.

201
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,848
I know, Margaret, but there's an easy way
to solve this. I don't want to butt in...

202
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:32,314
- But he can't resist.
- You've gotta compromise.

203
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,510
Baker and Bigelow,
take a half night off each.

204
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,885
Kellye, you work a third of a shift,
Baker a third, Bigelow a third.

205
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,426
Then tomorrow you reverse the whole thing.
There. Can I rise to an occasion?

206
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:45,224
- That's the dumbest schedule I ever heard.
- [Chattering]

207
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,855
[Man On p.A.]
Attention, all personnel. Incoming wounded.

208
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:51,902
- Choppers and ambulances loaded.
- That settles it. You're all on duty.

209
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,307
Plasma stat. Type and cross match
for two units of whole blood.

210
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:59,206
- Can you get a full casualty count?
- I'll get a full casualty count.

211
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:01,609
- Radar, please. Don't talk while I talk.
- Okay.

212
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:04,273
- I gotcha. I'll do exactly what you say.
- Just do what I ask, okay?

213
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:07,318
That's better. How you doing?

214
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:09,512
You wouldn't happen to be carrying around
an extra surgeon, would you?

215
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:12,988
Sorry. He's in my other jacket.
Margaret, how 'bout one of your nurses over here?

216
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:15,116
Oh, now they're my nurses.

217
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:17,661
Always ready with
the wisecracks, aren't you?

218
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:21,529
- Charles, move it, will ya?
- Pierce, please. I'm going through hell.

219
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:24,966
Well, go through a little faster.
Radar, what about those blankets?

220
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,538
I mailed the requisitions.
They'll probably be here tomorrow.

221
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,836
- Tomorrow? What's wrong with today?
- These things take time.

222
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:35,277
- Tell that to these guys who are out here freezing.
- I feel bad about it too, sir.

223
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:40,614
- Hawk, go easy on the kid. He's on your side.
- Yeah, I know.

224
00:12:40,752 --> 00:12:43,346
- Sponge. [Groans]
- Sponge.

225
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:45,719
- Clamp. [Snorts]
- Clamp.

226
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:48,725
- Hanky.
- [Sneezes]

227
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:53,093
- Blow and wipe.
- Hunnicutt, I have met a lot of people in my life.

228
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:56,964
- You are not among them. [Sneezes]
- Bless you anyway, creep.

229
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:00,835
- I think the expression is "God bless you, creep."
- Amen, Father.

230
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:02,998
Can we hold it down, please?

231
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:07,374
How can I be expected to drain these miserable
sinuses if they keep sending me more wounded?

232
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:09,606
I wouldn't take it, Charles.
Send them back.

233
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:11,842
Why doesn't somebody
tie off his tongue?

234
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,077
- Why doesn't somebody stand on yours?
- Clamp.

235
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:16,677
- Clamp.
- For your mouth.

236
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:18,949
- Will you dry up?
- I would love to.

237
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:22,652
- Will you all shut up?
- Ah, another county heard from.

238
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,025
Can we be serious?
I want it quiet in here.

239
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,963
- All right. Knock off the loud bleeding.
- Come on, Hunnicutt.

240
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:31,160
I got enough to worry about with a room full
of wounded and a camp full of headaches.

241
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,533
Not to mention
a couple of c.c. S of self-pity.

242
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:37,166
- Look, if you think it's so easy, you do it.
- Why? You're doing so well.

243
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:41,803
At least I'm trying. Meantime,
you stay in the backseat where you belong.

244
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:44,643
[All]
Whoa-ho-ho!

245
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,181
[Phone Ringing]

246
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,760
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin'.

247
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:05,567
Yeah, what?
No, I mean, 4077 th MASH.

248
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:10,267
No, Colonel Potter's not...
Colonel, is that you?

249
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,178
Oh, what are you doing up so late, sir?
Is it an officers' conference?

250
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:14,145
Oh, what are you doing up so late, sir?
Is it an officers' conference?

251
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:19,149
Well, General Imbrie runs a tight ship,
so we're all pretty tight.

252
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:23,210
- How are things at home?
- Fine. Mom's gonna enter her
cucumbers in the county fair...

253
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,222
and Uncle Ed's one of the judges so she might win.
[Laughs]

254
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:31,887
No, Radar. Home where you are
at the 4-0 double natural.

255
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,989
- How-How are things?
- Oh, uh, great.

256
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,297
Fine. Pretty good.
When you coming back, sir?

257
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:41,861
Oh, any time now.
How's, uh... How's Hawkeye doin'?

258
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:45,932
Uh... Uh, he's trying real hard.
When did you say you're coming back?

259
00:14:46,044 --> 00:14:49,707
I don't know. We been listening
to Imbrie for two days...

260
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:53,717
and, uh, all he's done so far
is-is clear his throat.

261
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:57,721
Well, hurry. Everybody misses you. They keep
saying, "When's Colonel Potter coming back?"

262
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:00,291
Well, give my best to everybody.

263
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:02,826
I'll talk t... talk to you tomorrow.

264
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:04,987
Good night, son.

265
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:07,065
[Laughter]

266
00:15:10,268 --> 00:15:13,635
Nah. I think I'll sleep here.

267
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:16,503
[Man]
Attention. Ajeep with single patient...

268
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:19,202
wants to meet single doctor
on the double.

269
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,742
- Is it bad? Is it bad?
- Easy, pal, easy.

270
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:26,784
No, it's not too bad. I can get those
shell fragments out with eyebrow tweezers.

271
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,853
- I'll take it, sir.
- How'd it happen?

272
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:32,481
Mortar. I was helping my buddy
at the battalion aid station.

273
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:36,027
- Direct hit. Got us both. It killed the aid surgeon.
- Geez, what about your buddy?

274
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:40,360
I think he's hurt worse than I am.
But I was the one bleeding, so they shipped me.

275
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:44,458
- What makes you think your buddy's hurt so bad?
- Well, he's not cut or nothin'...

276
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,299
- but he's sweatin' and looks gray, ya know?
- Stomach hurt?

277
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,568
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I touched it and he screamed.
But they thought he was fakin'.

278
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:53,269
- Fakin', huh? Radar, get him inside.
I'm goin' back up there.
- Yeah.

279
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:56,677
Wait a minute! Don't you think you'd better
tell Captain Pierce where you're going?

280
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:58,773
You tell him.
I can't get an appointment.

281
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:01,216
Hey, wait a minute.!
That's not S.O. P...!

282
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,618
- This the man who just came in?
- Yes, sir. This is Corporal Hough.

283
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:08,090
- Hi, Doc.
- Hi. All right, get B.J. On him right away.
Tell him to hurry.

284
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:11,856
I just got a call. There's a lot more casualties
coming in. We're gonna be very busy very soon.

285
00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:15,558
- Uh, sir? Excuse me, but about Captain Hunnicutt.
- Yeah, what about him?

286
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:20,127
Don't yell, but you know that jeep that just
come in? It just went out again with B.J. In it.

287
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:22,206
- Why?
- Well, he went after his buddy.

288
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:25,276
He's hurt real bad and they left him
at the aid station, so he went to get him.

289
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:27,641
Well, what does he think
we get in here, shaving nicks?

290
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:30,044
Look, he didn't know we had
more casualties coming in.

291
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:33,311
Well, he would have if he'd
checked with me first. This is great.

292
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:36,717
Fantastic.
Potter's not here, B.J.'s not here...

293
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:39,086
Charles has never been here,
and I'm left holding the bag.

294
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:41,091
Nothing personal.

295
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:44,856
[Man On p.A.]
Attention, all personnel. Choppers incoming.

296
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:48,558
Remember, you heard it here first.

297
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:51,727
Superficial. He can wait.
Margaret, I'm gonna scrub.

298
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:54,362
- You finish out here.
- This one has a bad chest wound. He's shocky.

299
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,440
- He better go in now.
- No, he can't.

300
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,009
- I got two that are worse off,
and Charles is already working.
- All right.

301
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,079
I'll start him on whole blood
and try to get him stabilized.

302
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,239
We'll manage till you're ready.
Come on, Corpsman!

303
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,647
- You know you're beautiful
when you're overworked?
- Hey, Hawkeye...

304
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:08,878
- Colonel Potter's on the phone for you.
- Tell him I'm busy.

305
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:13,219
- But I brought him all the way out here for you.
- Hello! Colonel Potter, it's you.

306
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:16,021
It's been so long I didn't recognize your voice.
There's a litter over there.

307
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:19,790
Get him into pre-op right away.
How's everything in Seoul? Having fun?

308
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:22,162
- Captain Pierce!
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

309
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:26,169
I gotta run, but I just want to say I'm thrilled
with the hustle and bustle of command.

310
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,365
The thousand details that clog my days
and waste my nights.

311
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:32,409
- And time permitting,
I even tend to a few wounded.
- Captain Pierce!

312
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,968
Gotta run. Been nice chatting with you. Why don't
you drop in if you're in the neighborhood?

313
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,112
I gotta get back home.

314
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:48,523
Gentlemen, tell the general we should
do this again sometime after the war.

315
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,928
Well, Doctor, as much as I hate to admit it,
you ran that siege pretty well.

316
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,163
We were great for half a staff.

317
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:04,169
Damn that Hunnicutt.
Where is he?

318
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:06,676
Technically he's AWOL, ya know?
I could throw the book at him.

319
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:10,043
I don't believe what I'm hearing!
Since when did you join the army?

320
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:15,347
- Since it was left to me.
- If only Frank Burns could see you now.

321
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:18,581
It's not so easy to play the clown
when you have to run the circus, is it?

322
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,022
- You finished, Major?
- Just one more thing.

323
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:26,621
- Permission to say, "It serves you right, sir."
- Permission denied. Dismissed.

324
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,598
Easy with him.
If the ride didn't kill him, he's still got a chance.

325
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,669
- Prep him fast.
- How is he?

326
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,738
- Severe internal bleeding.
- Are you okay?

327
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:35,965
- Yeah.
- Good. Now, what the hell were you doing?

328
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,599
- You think you can just waltz
out of here anytime you want?
- Not now, Hawk.

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,508
Don't give me "not now."
While you were driving around playing hero...

330
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:44,377
we were trying to patch together
a whole platoon with only two doctors.

331
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:47,474
Hey, I wasn't joy riding. When I go up
to an aid station, it's because I'm needed.

332
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,644
You should've checked with me first.
What you did was wrong.

333
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,086
I did exactly what Captain Pierce
would have done.

334
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,523
I don't know about Commander Pierce.
I don't even know Commander Pierce...

335
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:58,061
and I'm not sure I want to.

[Door Opens]

So that's how I look
behind that desk. Yuck.

338
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,077
Ah, returning to the scene of the crime.

339
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:19,707
I hereby give back your command, sir.

340
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:22,946
If you're interested, I've prepared
a detailed report on what you can do with it.

341
00:19:23,054 --> 00:19:25,181
I'll wait till the movie comes out.

342
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:29,727
Have a good time with the boys in Seoul?
Lots of parties? Generals jumping out of cakes?

343
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:33,025
Well, while you were out gallivanting,
I was cooped up here with the children.

The young clerk with the paper fetish.
The Lebanese Machiavelli in a garter belt.

Not to mention my roomie,
who can't just wait for business to come in.

- They are a pesky bunch, aren't they?

If you let these people have dessert tonight,
you're crazy.

00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:48,844
- Can we water down that temper tantrum?
- I don't want to.

349
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:52,212
- I like being mad.
- But you're not in charge anymore. I am.

350
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,582
And that's another thing! You could have
at least left me the key to the liquor cabinet.

Are you kidding?
Look what you're like sober.

- Want another?

- I've wanted another for days.
- Down this one. We'll take the bottle with us.

355
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:14,260
- Where?
- To your place.
Hunnicutt could probably use a belt.

356
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:16,932
No, thank you!
One thing I've learned on this job:

357
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:20,307
Never fraternize with your subordinates.
It leads to insubordination.

358
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:22,539
Will you relax?
You're gonna throw a shoe.

359

- Come on. To the 4077 th.

- Colonel, come on in.

- Brought you a snort.
- Hey, thanks.

Uncle Ben's perverted rice juice.
- Hm!

You two do know each other, don't you?

365
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:45,861
- Yeah, we've met, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Colonel, I'm glad you're back.

366
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,371
- I can't tell you how glad I am you're back.
- What's that supposed to mean?

367
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:52,375
- It means I'm glad he's back.
- Down the hatch.

368
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:57,576
You just won't admit that going out there
without telling me was the wrong thing to do.

369
00:20:57,682 --> 00:21:01,311
I did what I thought was right. You're only angry
because somebody else made a decision.

370
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:04,582
- It's my job to make the decisions.
- Was your job.

371
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:10,093
- Up the rebels!
- I think the real reason you did it was to spite me.

372
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:14,359
Spite you? I don't believe this. How do you get
your head through doorways with that ego?

373
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:16,593
You just won't admit
you couldn't handle it.

00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:18,259
You see what I've been putting up with?

Do you have any idea what he's been like
the last couple of days?

- Genghis Khan was bigger laughs.
- In your eye!

377
00:21:25,944 --> 00:21:28,777
Considering what I had to work with,
I think I did a damn good job.

378
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,848
- Well, that makes one of you.
- Oh, yeah?

379
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:33,941
- If you weren't so busy trying
to undermine my authority...
- [Sarcastic Laugh]

380
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:37,453
Why aren't you helping me? You should be
right in the middle of this. You're the commander.

381
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:40,285
And I'm acting like one,
staying out of it till I'm needed.

382
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:44,851
It's all in the timing, son.
There's a time to step in and a time to back off.

383
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:47,557
Pull the reins too tight
and the horse'll buck.

384
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:52,762
You had good people under you.
You should've let 'em go through their paces.

385
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:56,807
You know, this is pretty good.
Someone should be writing this down.

- Let's say a lot.

388
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,845
- Amen.
- And you.
- Yeah!

389
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:12,889
You're lucky you didn't run off when I was here,
or your fanny'd be hanging from the flagpole.

390
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:17,656
Well, don't sit there
like a couple of moon calves.

391

Drink up and shake hands already.

392
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,634
That's an order, boys.

Do you know how ridiculous
you two look?

You wanna make nice?

- Well, next time I'll know what to do.

- Hopefully there won't be a next time.
- What's that supposed to mean?

397
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,687
- Oh, no.
- Oh, come on. Will you get off it?

398
00:22:48,793 --> 00:22:52,388
- No, no, no, no, no. You meant
something by that. What was it?
- [Mutters]

399
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:56,160
- Come on. What was it?
- Nothing! For cryin' out loud! You are really a pip.

- You know that?
- All that good whiskey shot to hell.

401
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:01,739
- I'm a pip?
- You are a pip.

402
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,000
Because I don't want you
to talk to me like...

403

- Generalissimo Benjamin Franklin Pierce
is what you...
- Just a minute!

404
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:12,182
I'm sorry about all these forms, sir...

405
00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:14,911
- but Captain Pierce got us about two days behind.
- Don't hold a grudge, Radar.

406
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,921
Colonel, we have to do something
about the shower schedule.
The men are always booked in first.

407
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,321
By the time my nurses get in,
there isn't any hot water.

408
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:25,260
Besides, they leave the place a shambles.
Are you listening to me?

409
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,355
Your nurses are taking cold showers,
and the men are leaving the place a mess.

410
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:30,866
- What are you gonna do about it, Colonel?
- As soon as I can...

411
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:33,301
I'll look into the ladies' shower,
so to speak.

412
00:23:33,404 --> 00:23:36,567
I hope so.
And thank God you're back, sir.

413
00:23:36,674 --> 00:23:38,972
Dismissed, and thank you, Margaret.

- Colonel, I missed you.
- No.

415
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:43,113
- About my heart murmurs, sir...
- No.

416
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,977
- My double vision is coming back.
- No.

417
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,880
- I've fallen in love with a goat.
- No.

418
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:50,045
- Glad to have you back, sir.
- Well, that just about does it, sir.

419
00:23:50,154 --> 00:23:53,317
- I'll send these right off. Well done.
- Don't mention it.

420
00:23:53,424 --> 00:23:55,551
Oh, and, Radar, one other thing.

421
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,357
Bring me back
a tall bicarbonate of soda.

422
00:23:59,464 --> 00:24:02,922
- This place is gonna drive me nuts.
- Yes, sir.
