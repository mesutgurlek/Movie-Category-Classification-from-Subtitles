You found me beautiful once.

660
01:05:40,021 --> 01:05:42,607
Honey, you got real ugly.

661
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:01,709
There we are.

662
01:06:10,426 --> 01:06:12,470
So you wanna play rough, eh?

663
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:13,888
Okay.

664
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:18,976
Oh.

665
01:06:23,064 --> 01:06:24,982
All right, all right.

666
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,988
Prepare to die!

667
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:45,670
You're going down!

668
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:48,381
I'm going up.

669
01:06:48,464 --> 01:06:49,882
I'm coming for you.

670
01:06:58,432 --> 01:06:59,684
Come on!

671
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:15,700
Oops. Excuse me.

672
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:16,909
Come on.

673
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:18,411
All right!

674
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:23,708
You're pissing me off,
you ugly son of a bitch!

675
01:07:41,517 --> 01:07:44,520
I'll spoil those good looks.

676
01:07:46,439 --> 01:07:47,940
Back-stabber!

677
01:07:52,945 --> 01:07:54,321
Hold Still!

678
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:07,501
Tallyho

679
01:08:08,377 --> 01:08:09,754
(SCREAMING)

680
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:11,672
(CACKLING)

681
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:13,799
We can't hold the battlements!

682
01:08:13,883 --> 01:08:16,969
We will hold!
We must protect the book!

683
01:08:21,182 --> 01:08:22,767
(GROWLING)

684
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:31,734
I got a bone to pick with you.

685
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:33,569
Come on.

686
01:08:40,493 --> 01:08:42,536
Slice that gizzard open.

687
01:08:58,803 --> 01:09:00,554
Now you're mine.

688
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,433
(EXCLAIMING)

689
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:12,858
(SCREAMING)

690
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:23,619
At last, the book.

691
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,710
I possess the Necronomicon.

692
01:09:31,794 --> 01:09:33,712
I've crushed
your pathetic army.

693
01:09:33,796 --> 01:09:35,965
Now I'll have my vengeance.

694
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:39,635
Buckle up, bonehead, 'cause
you're goin' for a ride.

695
01:09:39,718 --> 01:09:40,928
Huh?

696
01:09:47,393 --> 01:09:48,936
(SCREAMING)

697
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,318
SOLDIER: Victory's ours!

698
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:57,987
(ALL CHEERING)

699
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:00,906
Retreat! Retreat!

700
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:02,783
Let's get the hell
out of here!

701
01:10:30,853 --> 01:10:32,062
HENRY: Tricky ones, they are.

702
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:33,772
MAN:
If it's a fight you want...

703
01:10:34,315 --> 01:10:37,484
ARTHUR: Watch 'em, lads.
They're an untrustworthy lot.

704
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:53,959
(SWORDS SWISHING)

705
01:11:24,531 --> 01:11:26,325
Move yourself, lad!

706
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:28,035
Your hand, man.
Hey, Henry.

707
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:29,536
Godspeed!
Yeah, nice going.

708
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:30,955
My lady.
Arthur.

709
01:11:31,038 --> 01:11:32,623
Well won, my friend.

710
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:33,958
We've won the day.

711
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:37,002
Yeah!
Yeah!

712
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:44,635
We're brothers and a new
kingdom shall be born!

713
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:50,975
The book tells us that
once you drink this liquid

714
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:54,812
<i>and recite the words,
"Klaatu barada nikto, "</i>

715
01:11:54,895 --> 01:11:57,564
thou shalt awaken
in thine own time.

716
01:12:00,234 --> 01:12:04,154
Remember, you must
recite the words exactly.

717
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:58,917
I thought about staying.

718
01:12:59,043 --> 01:13:03,505
They offered me the chance to lead
them, to teach them, to be king.

719
01:13:04,339 --> 01:13:05,340
Ah-ha.

720
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:06,884
But my place is here.

721
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:10,721
So I swallowed the juice,
said the words and here I am.

722
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:13,140
Did you say the words
right this time?

723
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:17,436
Well, maybe I didn't say every
single, tiny little syllable, no,

724
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,813
but basically
I said 'em, yeah.

725
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:22,900
Basically.

726
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:29,198
You know that story about
how you could've been king?

727
01:13:29,615 --> 01:13:31,867
I think it's kind of cute.

728
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:34,453
Yeah.

729
01:13:43,921 --> 01:13:45,214
(SCREAMING)

730
01:13:53,347 --> 01:13:54,681
Die!

731
01:14:09,404 --> 01:14:12,658
Lady, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave the store.

732
01:14:12,741 --> 01:14:14,868
Who the hell are you?

733
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,578
Name's Ash.

734
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:20,040
Housewares.

735
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:43,230
I'll swallow your soul.

736
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:44,773
Come get some.

737
01:15:05,085 --> 01:15:07,671
<i>ASH: Sure, I could've
stayed in the past.</i>

738
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:11,592
<i>Could've even been king.</i>

739
01:15:13,302 --> 01:15:15,012
<i>But in my own way,</i>

740
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:17,222
<i>I am king.</i>

741
01:15:19,099 --> 01:15:21,018
Hail to the king, baby.
