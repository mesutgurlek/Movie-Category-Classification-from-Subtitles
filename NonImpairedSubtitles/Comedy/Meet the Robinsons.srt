1
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,315
Then I didn't choose that one
because it was gonna give me pimples,

2
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,954
so I choosed another scary one

3
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,949
because, for all those years
that I went for Halloween,

4
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,718
I wasn't scary at all.

5
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,319
I love baseball.
It's my destiny to play that game.

6
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,317
I don't really care about winning.

7
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,718
Well, like, now I do
'cause, like, we've lost every game.

8
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,671
I've gotten tired of it.

9
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,156
I'm working, like, so hard.
All the balls are getting thrown to me.

10
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,589
I'm trying to catch, like, every one.

11
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,633
All of the people in the outfield
are all looking around and...

12
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,274
Come on!
Let's play some baseball, okay?

13
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,674
Not the lazy game.

14
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,999
They're here.

15
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,669
Lewis?

16
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,798
Lewis?

17
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,915
Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it!

18
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,553
They are gonna love this!

19
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,433
Nothing says "adopt me"
like a weird invention.

20
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,629
Lewis!

21
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,796
- Lewis, the Harringtons are here!
- Way ahead of you, Mildred.

22
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,638
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,718
Remember, sit up straight.
Look them in the eye.

24
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,910
Smile. Let's fix your...

25
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,873
Mildred.

26
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,236
All right, all right, all right, all right.

27
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,157
Go show them how special you are.

28
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,118
Oh, I hope this is it.

29
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,878
I hope he gets adopted.

30
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,553
You and me both, chief.

31
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,839
I mean, there's so many things
in the world that can be improved.

32
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,157
Just think of it.
Moving sidewalks, flying cars.

33
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,759
The possibilities are endless.

34
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,871
Flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,719
All it takes is some imagination
and a little science,

36
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,115
and we can make the world
a better place.

37
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,391
Well, these are all interesting ideas.

38
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,431
So, what's your favourite sport?

39
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,949
- Well, does inventing count as a sport?
- Actually...

40
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,071
'Cause I think I hit a home run
with this one!

41
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,509
- What is that?
- First, a question.

42
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,835
What's the number one problem
that you face

43
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,598
when you make
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

44
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,915
- Lewis, I don't think we...
- Portion control.

45
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,871
Too much peanut butter sticks
to the roof of your mouth,

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,035
takes forever to chew.

47
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,755
Too much jelly squishes out the sides
and makes your hands all sticky.

48
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,394
Well, I propose
that the perfect P.B. and J.

49
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,794
is within mankind's grasp,

50
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,115
and I've built this machine to achieve it.

51
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,356
For this demonstration,
I'll use regular bread.

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,515
Honey, it's okay.

53
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,392
As you can see, toasting is an option.

54
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,590
We don't usually eat peanut butter.

55
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,469
Lewis, this is really not necessary.

56
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,272
It's jammed!

57
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,758
Lewis, please, don't!

58
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,435
What's happening?

59
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,279
Mr Harrington has a peanut allergy!

60
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,039
I'm sorry!

61
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,639
Here let me help you get that off!

62
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,432
Stand back!

63
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,994
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Breathe. Breathe.

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,997
I'm so sorry! I didn't know!

65
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,678
It was really nice to meet you.

66
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,473
We're gonna need some time
to think about it.

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,670
Hi, folks. Everything all...

68
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,835
What happened?

69
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,315
Miss Duffy,
that boy is definitely not right for us.

70
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,793
Now, if you'll excuse me.

71
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,708
I'm so sorry about this.
If you would just...

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,600
- I made some lunch.
- Not hungry.

73
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Poor Mr Harrington.

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,470
- I killed him?
- No. No! No, you didn't kill him.

75
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,477
I called. He's perfectly fine.

76
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,791
I was just gonna say that it's...

77
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,512
It's too bad
he didn't get to try a sandwich

78
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,074
from that wonderful invention of yours.

79
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,191
- Yeah, real wonderful.
- It's not you.

80
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,709
We just haven't found
the right couple yet.

81
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,671
One hundred twenty-four.

82
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
What?

83
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,676
That's how many adoption interviews
I've had, 124.

84
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,835
Oh, Lewis, come on, now.

85
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,110
You're exaggerating just to make your

86
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,755
point.

87
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,791
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year,

88
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,276
and you know how hard it is
for a teenager to get adopted.

89
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,790
I have no future. No one wants me.

90
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
That's not true, Lewis!

91
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,632
My own mother didn't even want me.

92
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,035
Now, stop it. You do not know that.

93
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,479
Then why'd she give me up?

94
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,192
She may not have been able
to take care of you.

95
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,753
Did you ever think of that?

96
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,468
I am sure that she was only thinking
about what was best for you.

97
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,519
I never thought of it that way.

98
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,791
Maybe she wanted to keep you,
but she had no choice.

99
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,553
You're right.

100
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,190
My real mom is the only person
who's ever wanted me.

101
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,992
Wait. I said "maybe."

102
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,793
And if she wanted me then,
she'll want me now.

103
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,319
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,671
I have to find her, Mildred,
and when I do, she'll take me back,

105
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,119
and we'll be a family again!

106
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,869
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Lewis, you can't do that.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,639
No one knows anything about her.
No one even saw her.

108
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,354
Wrong. I saw her

109
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,515
once.

110
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,111
She's in here. I just have to remember.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's it!

112
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,632
<i>Hello</i>

113
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,479
<i>I got something to tell you</i>

114
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,910
<i>But it's crazy</i>

115
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,350
<i>I got something to show you</i>

116
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,750
<i>So give me just one more chance</i>

117
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,839
<i>One more glance
And I will make of you</i>

118
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,312
<i>Another believer</i>

119
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,309
<i>Guess what?
You got more than you bargained</i>

120
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,352
<i>Ain't it crazy?</i>

121
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,950
<i>You got more than you paid for</i>

122
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,233
<i>So give me just one more chance</i>

123
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,828
<i>One more glance</i>

124
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,708
<i>One more hand to hold</i>

125
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,439
<i>You've been on my mind</i>

126
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,916
<i>Though it may seem I'm fooling</i>

127
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:40,309
<i>Wasted so much time</i>

128
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,831
<i>Though it may seem I'm fooling</i>

129
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,230
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

130
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,954
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

131
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,789
<i>What are we gonna do about it?</i>

132
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:00,308
<i>You've been on my mind</i>

133
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,716
<i>One more chance</i>

134
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,834
<i>Wasted so much time</i>

135
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,120
<i>One more chance</i>

136
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,279
So tired.

137
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,432
We'll see you at 2:00 this afternoon.
He'll be so excited you're coming.

138
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,788
Bye-bye, now.

139
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,356
Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael.

140
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,436
- Good luck at the big game today.
- Easy win.

141
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,516
Those guys are a bunch of bums.

142
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,631
I just hope I can stay awake.

143
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,557
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

144
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,275
He was up all night
working on his stupid project,

145
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,029
but that's what happens

146
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,277
when you get a science geek
for a roommate.

147
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,238
Ah, that's good joe.

148
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,438
All right, Einstein,
you owe Michael big time.

149
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,438
Well, unlocking the secrets of the brain
took a lot longer than I expected,

150
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,518
but it's finished, Mildred.
I recalibrated the headset.

151
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,192
Now the neural circuits will connect.

152
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,117
I've cracked the hippocampus!

153
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,037
Really? Okay. What?

154
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,878
Now to test it out.

155
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,518
Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go!

156
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,675
Wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute.

157
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,392
I almost forgot what I came up here for.

158
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,839
I know you have a lot
on your plate today,

159
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,155
but I've scheduled an interview for you
this afternoon.

160
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,077
- No, thanks.
- "No, thanks"?

161
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,997
Sweetheart, this is
about being adopted,

162
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,998
and you will be back here
clean, happy and on time.

163
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,749
I'm done with interviews, Mildred.
I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.

164
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,075
Listen, I know where your head is,
but I'm telling you,

165
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,749
you have got to get out of the past
and look to the future.

166
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,711
I am, and this is it.

167
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,989
This is my future.

168
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,479
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,878
Lewis? Honey?

170
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,680
Dr Krunklehorn,
I know you're very busy there

171
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,835
at Inventco Labs,

172
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,840
and we're just so excited
to have you as a judge.

173
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,791
It's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein.
Hey, you never know.

174
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,876
One of your students may invent
the next integrated circuit

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,956
or microprocessor or integrated circuit.

176
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,433
Oh, wait! I said that already.

177
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,278
Well, I just don't get out
of that lab very much.

178
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,311
Is that a bow tie? I like bow ties.

179
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,317
I haven't slept in eight days!

180
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,034
Well, then can I get you a cot
or something?

181
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,038
Nope, I've got the caffeine patch.
It's my invention.

182
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,674
Each patch is the equivalent
of 12 cups of coffee.

183
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,109
You can stay awake for days
with no side effects.

184
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Sorry. Who's this?

185
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,874
This is one of our students,
Stanley Pukowski.

186
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,555
Oh, so cute!

187
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,955
I just want to bite
his chubby little cheeks!

188
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,197
What's with the dress, Pukowski?

189
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,754
It's actually a toga, sir.

190
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,190
Coach, nice to see you, sort of.
What are you doing here?

191
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,675
Judging a science fair.
What's it look like I'm doing?

192
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,678
And what makes you qualified
to judge a science fair?

193
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,994
It's my gym.

194
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,479
Stanley. Volcano.

195
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,879
Behold the awesome power
of Mount Vesuvius!

196
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,791
The toggle switch isn't toggling.

197
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,955
Dr Krunklehorn?

198
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,991
Barium, cobalt, Einstein, Kool-Aid!

199
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,908
I don't know what she just said,
but this project is unacceptable!

200
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,678
Now, give me 20 laps around the gym!

201
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,233
Move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go!

202
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,998
- Coach!
- I'm watching you.

203
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,993
Okay, next up is Lizzy
and her fire ant farm.

204
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,235
That's right.

205
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,759
Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants.

206
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,632
You know that they have a tendency
to bite people.

207
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,910
Only my enemies.

208
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,156
Just keep moving, shall we?
Top notch, Lizzy!

209
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,919
Let's not anger her
or make her jumpy in any way.

210
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,911
This area's not secure. Get in.

211
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,517
Have you been approached
by a tall man in a bowler hat?

212
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,756
- What?
- Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.

213
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,269
- Okay, goodbye.
- All right,

214
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,356
didn't want to pull rank on you,
but you forced my hand.

215
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,550
Special Agent Wilbur Robinson
of the T.C.T.F.

216
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,636
- The what?
- Time Continuum Task Force.

217
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,829
- I'm here to protect you.
- Well...

218
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,269
Now, tall man, bowler hat,
approached you?

219
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,435
No, why?

220
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,837
I could lose my badge for this.

221
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,598
He's a suspect in a robbery.

222
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,755
What did he steal?

223
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,108
- A time machine.
- A what?

224
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,232
I've tracked him to this time,
and my informants say he's after you.

225
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,952
Me? Why me?

226
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,957
The boys back at HQ
haven't figured out a motive yet.

227
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,957
And by "HQ," I mean "headquarters."

228
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,354
I know what HQ means.

229
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,959
Good. You're a smart kid.

230
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,036
That might keep you alive, for now.

231
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,639
Just worry
about your little science gizmo

232
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,796
and leave the "perp" to me.

233
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,559
- And by "perp," I mean...
- I know what it means!

234
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,591
Okay, Mr Smarty-pants.

235
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,070
Bowler Hat Guy!

236
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,834
My frogs!

237
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,154
You're not gonna get away with it,

238
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,793
kid with science project.

239
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,434
Dude, you almost busted
my solar system!

240
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,075
My frogs! They're getting away!

241
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,229
Got you! That's the last of them.

242
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,590
Annoying little girl,
I don't have time for this.

243
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,755
I'm on a very important...

244
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,952
Don't sass me, boy. I know karate.

245
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,992
Come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain!
Love the pain!

246
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,189
Coach...

247
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,389
Next up is Lewis.

248
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,590
Yes... Lewis! Excuse me.

249
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,997
Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna...

250
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,514
It's okay. It's gonna work this time.
I won't let you down, I promise.

251
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,438
All right, Lewis, I trust you.
Knock 'em dead.

252
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,753
That was a figure of speech.
Please don't kill anyone.

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,831
Okay, stand back, everybody.

254
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,520
This next project
will knock your socks off.

255
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,236
Seriously, you might wanna stand back
a little.

256
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,359
Have you ever forgotten something,

257
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,836
and no matter how hard you tried,
you couldn't remember it?

258
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,710
Well, what happens
to these forgotten memories?

259
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,156
I propose
they're stored somewhere in your brain,

260
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,748
and I built a machine
that can retrieve them.

261
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,678
I call it the Memory Scanner.

262
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,832
It's shiny!

263
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,520
So, Lewis,
how does the Memory Scanner work?

264
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,871
First, you input the desired period
of time on this keypad.

265
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,154
Then a laser scans the cerebral cortex,
where memories are stored.

266
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,635
The retrieved memory
is then displayed on this monitor.

267
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,591
Wrap him up. I'll take two.

268
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,156
Now, I'm going back 12 years,
three months and 11 days.

269
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,077
Why that particular day?

270
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,077
You didn't think
I was paying attention, did you?

271
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,708
Well, that was the day...

272
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,675
Let's just say, that was
a very important day in my life.

273
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,273
Fair enough. Play ball.

274
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,788
It'll just take a second
to get the turbines going.

275
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,157
Lewis, wait!

276
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,430
She's gonna blow!

277
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,439
Watch out!

278
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,277
Feel the pain! Love the...

279
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,358
Hurts so much! Make it stop!

280
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,234
Make it stop!

281
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,634
Coach, suck it up, okay?

282
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,036
Let us conduct ourselves in a way
that we'll all be proud of tomorrow.

283
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,878
- Let's calm down!
- Mr Willerstein?

284
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,513
- I didn't mean to...
- Not now, Lewis!

285
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,154
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

286
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,708
Not now.

287
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,713
Okay, and we are walking
in a calm, orderly fashion

288
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,878
toward the exits.

289
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,679
Wait, Lewis!

290
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,278
Come, my dear. Our future awaits.

291
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,748
Hey, what are you doing up here?

292
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,754
Would you quit that, please?
I know you're not a pigeon.

293
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,198
You're blowing my cover.

294
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,833
We're the only ones up here.

295
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,837
That's just what they want you to think.

296
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,473
Now, enough moping.

297
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,398
Take this back to the science fair
and fix that Memory Scanner.

298
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,317
Stop! Stop! Get away from me!

299
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Maybe you've forgotten.

300
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,994
I'm a time cop from the future,
should be taken very seriously.

301
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,154
That's no badge.

302
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,437
This is a coupon for a tanning salon!
You're a fake.

303
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,516
Okay, you got me. I'm not a cop,

304
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,517
but I really am from the future,

305
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,517
and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy.

306
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,789
Here we go again.

307
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,751
He stole a time machine,
came to the science fair

308
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,915
and ruined your project.

309
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,235
My project didn't work
because I'm no good.

310
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,749
There is no Bowler Hat Guy,
there is no time machine,

311
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,393
and you're not from the future!

312
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
You're crazy!

313
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,348
I am not crazy.

314
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,710
Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel?
Prove it.

315
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,031
Yeah, that's what I thought.

316
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,872
I'm just gonna go lock myself
in my room

317
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,831
and hide under the covers
for a couple years.

318
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,157
If I prove to you I'm from the future,
will you go back to the science fair?

319
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,396
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.

320
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,359
Hey, let go of me!

321
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,436
- What are you doing? Let go of me!
- Okay.

322
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,909
What is this? Where are we going?

323
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,276
To the future!

324
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,995
<i>The future has arrived</i>

325
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,588
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

326
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,952
<i>The future has arrived</i>

327
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,673
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

328
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Is this proof enough for you?

329
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,993
Is it ever!

330
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,998
I never thought that time travel
could be possible in my lifetime,

331
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,429
and here it is, right in front of me!

332
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,232
The truth will set you free, brother.

333
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,113
This is beyond anything
I could've imagined.

334
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,995
This means
I could really change my life.

335
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,439
That's right. You can.

336
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,790
Next stop, science fair,
to fix your Memory Scanner.

337
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,559
Hey, I'm not gonna fix
that stupid Memory Scanner.

338
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,080
- What?
- Wilbur, this is a time machine!

339
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,838
Why should I fix my dumb invention

340
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,236
when you can take me
to see my mom now in this ship?

341
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,793
I could actually go back to that night
and stop her from giving me up.

342
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,639
The answer is not a time machine.
It's this.

343
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,990
This? You want to know
what I think about this?

344
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,189
What are you doing?

345
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,435
I'm sorry, Wilbur,

346
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,312
but you don't know
what I've lived through.

347
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,158
- Lewis, no!
- Let go!

348
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,077
- You let go!
- You're not the boss of me!

349
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,237
Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13.

350
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,679
That makes me older.

351
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,835
Well, I was born in the past,

352
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,916
which makes me older
and the boss of you!

353
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,111
I am so dead.

354
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,228
I'm not allowed to look at this thing,
let alone drive it!

355
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,679
Mom and Dad are gonna kill me,

356
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,439
and I can tell you this.
It will not be done with mercy.

357
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,152
Isn't there like
a time machine repair shop

358
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
- or something?
- No!

359
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,391
There's only two time machines
in existence,

360
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,238
and the Bowler Hat Guy
has the other one!

361
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,715
Well, somebody's gonna have
to fix this.

362
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,753
Good idea. You're smart. You fix it.

363
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,189
Are you crazy? I can't fix this thing.

364
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,754
Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it.

365
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,917
All right, under one condition.

366
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,874
I fix it,
you take me back to see my mom.

367
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,798
What? You didn't even follow through
on our last deal.

368
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,955
How can I trust you?

369
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,674
Well, you told me you were a time cop
from the future.

370
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,438
How can I trust you?

371
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,189
<i>Touché.</i>

372
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,718
So do we have a deal?

373
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,508
Good day, madam.

374
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,950
- I'm here to change the future.
- Yes, sir?

375
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,755
I must speak with the man
in charge immediately.

376
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,997
- Yes, sir.
- I have an appointment with destiny.

377
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,712
Very good, sir. I'll let Smith know,

378
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,956
and I'll have your dry cleaning
delivered directly to your suite.

379
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,036
- What?
- Now, what time is your appointment?

380
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,876
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

381
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,593
What time is your appointment?

382
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,835
Big hand is on the... Oh, 2:00!

383
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,518
You're the 2:00?

384
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,599
Yes. Yes, I am.

385
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,392
You're Mary Johnson?

386
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,756
Yes.

387
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,396
Mary is short for...

388
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Marian?

389
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,276
- Can that be a boy name?
- Yes.

390
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,796
- Then yes.
- Have a seat.

391
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,239
Oh, goody!

392
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,351
"Pass off invention as my own." Check.
Oh, I love checklists.

393
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,038
The board is ready to see you now.

394
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,349
Wait. What am I going to say?

395
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,237
I'm never gonna remember that.

396
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,597
Would you... Why don't you go?
You do it so much better than me.

397
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,835
That's true.

398
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,520
A hat without a head
couldn't really pass off an invention

399
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,675
as its own.

400
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,834
Fantastic! Great idea!
I'm so glad I have you!

401
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,199
"Prepare to be amazed." Oh, I got it!

402
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,032
Prepare to be amazed!

403
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,999
"This is my invention."

404
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,993
"I doubt any of you have seen
anything as brilliant as this device."

405
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
Very well,

406
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,352
Miss Johnson?

407
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,313
It's Ms.

408
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,908
You have two minutes. Please begin.

409
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,630
- It's shiny!
- What is that thing?

410
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,119
Well, I like to call it my...

411
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,031
To call it my...

412
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,153
- What are you looking at?
- No! I... The sun, in my eyes.

413
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,998
Well, then let me close the blinds.

414
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,391
Now, the name?

415
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,393
Well, what...

416
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,112
We can quibble about names
at a later date.

417
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,879
The point is,
what I have here is special, unique.

418
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,197
Yes. Yes, you must love it
and buy it and mass produce it,

419
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,029
and the best part is,
it's got really comfy headphones.

420
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,119
I wonder, could you lean forward
just a little bit, please?

421
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,958
Yes, thank you.

422
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,594
Yes, they are quite comfortable.

423
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,036
What do you hope
to accomplish with this?

424
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,718
Oh, nothing of consequence.

425
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,391
I simply wish to crush the dreams
of a poor little orphan boy!

426
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,873
After that, it's all a little fuzzy.

427
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,638
You mean,
you haven't thought this through?

428
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,834
Thirty seconds.

429
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,959
Allow me to show you how it works.

430
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,036
First, we turn it on.

431
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,796
That's not it.

432
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,635
Ten seconds.

433
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,876
So where do I sign?

434
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,509
Doris, it's all over.

435
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,517
All our hopes and dreams dashed,

436
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,189
like so many pieces
of a broken machiney thing.

437
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,068
You're right.

438
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,800
Success is still ours for the taking.

439
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,956
We must find that boy.

440
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,152
We'll sneak this thing into the garage.
You'll have all the tools you need.

441
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
What about your parents?

442
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,469
Mom never goes in there,

443
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,591
and Dad's on a business trip
until tomorrow morning.

444
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
You've got till then to fix it.

445
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,877
Well, fine, but I'm gonna need
some blueprints or something for this.

446
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,230
No worries. I got someone
who could help us with that.

447
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,952
<i>Who dares to disturb my sanctuary?</i>

448
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,036
Carl, it's me. Let me in.

449
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,197
<i>None may enter
unless they speak the royal password.</i>

450
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,629
Carl, what are you talking about?
We don't have a password.

451
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,911
<i>Yes, we do.
I made one up while you were gone.</i>

452
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,076
Well, then
how am I supposed to know what it is?

453
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,474
<i>You...</i>

454
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,159
<i>Good point.</i>

455
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,077
Welcome back, little buddy.

456
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,634
So what's up
with the stolen time machine?

457
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,194
Did you find it? Apparently not,

458
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,834
and you managed
to bust this one as well.

459
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,439
It'll be fixed before Dad gets home.

460
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,994
And how do you suppose
that's gonna...

461
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,076
- Who's that?
- Wow, a real robot!

462
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,269
Hi, I'm Lewis.

463
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,436
Well, that was unexpected.

464
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,513
As was that.

465
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,029
If my family finds out
I brought you from the past,

466
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,151
they'll bury me alive
and dance on my grave.

467
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,192
I'm not exaggerating.
Well, yes, I am, but not the point.

468
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,436
The point is,
your hair's a dead giveaway.

469
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,198
Why would my hair be
a dead giveaway?

470
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,958
That is an excellent question.

471
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,479
Wait! Where are you going?

472
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,999
Another excellent question.

473
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,318
But I don't just want to sit here.

474
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Stay.

475
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
But...

476
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,319
Wow!

477
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,429
Hey, ring my doorbell.

478
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,875
No, no, no, no, ring my doorbell.

479
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,991
Ring it. Ring it. Ring it.
Look at this door bell. Ring it.

480
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,955
- Yes!
- That was accidental.

481
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,479
That's an accidental ring.
It doesn't count.

482
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,669
It's in the rule book. Look it up.

483
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,199
- Flat head.
- Short roots.

484
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
Evergreen.

485
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,519
What do you mean,
don't go to the family?

486
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,189
How can we not go to the family
in this time of family crisis?

487
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,835
By leaving the garage door unlocked,
you let the time machine get stolen,

488
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,713
and now the entire time stream
could be altered!

489
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,432
That and someone took my bike.

490
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,154
Look, I told you. It's gonna all work out.

491
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,914
First, we keep Lewis in the garage,
away from everybody.

492
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,871
I show up and give him
the pep talk of the century.

493
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,399
Then he fixes the time machine.

494
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,192
Why is it an acorn?

495
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,958
I didn't have time to sculpt everything.

496
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,991
Okay, now, the time machine is fixed.

497
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,633
His confidence in inventing is restored.

498
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,115
He goes back to the science fair,
fixes his Memory Scanner,

499
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,071
thus restoring
the space-time continuum.

500
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,872
What about taking him back
to see his mom?

501
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,752
I just told him that to buy some time.

502
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,077
Oh, yeah, can't see that one
blowing up in your face.

503
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,872
Trust me. I got it under control.

504
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,991
Wilbur Robinson never fails.

505
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,832
But on the slight chance that I do...

506
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,997
"On the slight chance," yeah.
You know what? I'll run the numbers.

507
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,788
What is it?

508
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,558
Well, it's not...

509
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,549
It doesn't pertain to anything in...
You know, there's not necessarily...

510
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,310
There's a 99.999999% chance
that you won't exist.

511
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,672
- What?
- And I didn't want to tell you, but I did.

512
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,119
I won't exist?

513
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,673
And where does that leave me?

514
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,995
Alone, rusting in a corner.

515
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,753
What am I worried about?
Now, blueprints?

516
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,548
If this thing ever blows over,
I really gotta get away from you

517
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,908
and get some quiet time.

518
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
What's...

519
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,558
Well, hey, there, little fella!

520
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,229
Now, I know what you're thinking,
and my clothes are not on backwards.

521
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,839
My head is!

522
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,959
Oh, I used to tell that one
to my science students.

523
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,478
They didn't laugh, either.

524
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,556
Anywho, what's your name, fruit-head?

525
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,636
- Well, Lewis, but...
- Lewis, huh?

526
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,718
Well, say, Lewis, you haven't seen
any teeth around here, have you?

527
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,398
- Teeth?
- Yeah, my teeth.

528
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,953
Been digging holes all day.
Can't find them anywhere.

529
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,116
All right, look, old man,
I need to get back to the garage.

530
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,275
Wilbur left me down there,

531
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,628
and I wasn't supposed to leave,
and these monsters...

532
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
- Monsters?
... attacked me on the porch and...

533
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,677
There's no monsters on the porch,
you ninny.

534
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,279
- Listen to me!
- Of course, I also didn't think

535
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,958
there was a woodchuck
living on my arm,

536
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,479
and lookie there!

537
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Hope he ain't got rabies.

538
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,790
Old man, I need to get to the garage!

539
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,629
Well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy.
I know a shortcut.

540
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,637
Welcome to the garage.

541
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,709
Well, I'm completely lost.

542
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,875
Hiya, Grandpa.

543
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,035
Hey, Aunt Billie.

544
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,639
Lewis and me
are looking for the garage.

545
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,910
- We have a garage?
- Apparently so.

546
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,270
Lewis, will you give me a hand
and time my race?

547
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,109
Okay, Gaston,
my toy train's ready for you.

548
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,318
That's a toy train?

549
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,159
On your mark, get set, go?

550
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,955
- 3.7 seconds.
- I win!

551
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,431
Okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints.

552
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,749
Lewis?

553
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,753
<i>- And five and six and seven and eight.
- That's Uncle Joe. He works out.</i>

554
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
<i>Keep those tummies tucked.</i>

555
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,959
This isn't the garage.

556
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
I know.

557
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,476
I don't think
the garage is in here, either.

558
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,160
Egads! A very grave matter, indeed.

559
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,714
- That's Uncle Art.
- A real superhero?

560
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,671
Quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy,

561
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,995
needs a large
cheese-and-sausage thin-crust?

562
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,351
I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.

563
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,031
- He's a...
- Pizza delivery guy.

564
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,434
Lewis?

565
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,434
- What are we doing up here?
- Looking for the garage.

566
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,198
Oh, yeah!

567
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,435
Laszlo, you stop painting my hat,
or I'm telling Ma!

568
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,755
- Lighten up, sis!
- Lasz, I mean it!

569
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,072
Children, please!
Your mother is trying to take a nap.

570
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,077
What is all the yelling out here?

571
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,315
- He started it!
- She started it!

572
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,714
I don't want to hear any more!

573
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,150
- Now, sweetie...
- Don't you "sweetie" me!

574
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,476
I'm going for a drive!

575
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,434
That's strange.
She usually takes the Harley.

576
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,272
Lewis!

577
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,960
I think my wife Lucille's baking cookies.

578
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,510
Bake them cookies, Lucille!

579
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,914
Why is your dog wearing glasses?

580
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,998
Oh, 'cause his insurance
won't pay for contacts.

581
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,714
That's Uncle Spike,
and there's Uncle Dimitri.

582
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,110
- Oh, look, there's...
- That's the monster!

583
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,993
Oh, no, Lewis, that's our butler, Lefty.

584
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,474
Nice to meet you.

585
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,795
Hey, Lefty,
any idea how to get to the garage?

586
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,155
Well, that's true. We didn't ask her yet.

587
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,271
- Who?
- Wilbur's mom, Franny.

588
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,992
I think you'll like her.

589
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,359
Hey, guys!

590
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,713
<i>You ask me over
And over and over</i>

591
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,798
<i>Have you seen
My peacock-feathered hat?</i>

592
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,035
Frogs?

593
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,593
Taught them everything they know.

594
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,553
- Franny, this is Lewis.
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

595
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,070
Perfect timing.
We need someone on maracas.

596
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,354
<i>Where is your heart at?
Nobody knows that</i>

597
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,471
<i>Even though you've him, her, me</i>

598
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,068
<i>And an army searching</i>

599
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,555
<i>I've got a feeling
You will be reeling</i>

600
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,116
<i>When you are bad
And the circus comes to town</i>

601
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,878
Grandpa, I think I found your teeth.

602
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,718
<i>And you see me leaving
Dressed up as a magician</i>

603
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,909
<i>Or something like that</i>

604
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,113
Sarsaparilla! My teeth are back!

605
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,594
Ring-a-ding-ding.

606
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,315
All right!

607
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,432
Right. Well, glad I could help
with the teeth,

608
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,869
but, wow, look at the time.

609
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,190
Lewis, I told you to stay in the garage!

610
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,356
I did, but I went up the tube,
and I ran into your family, and I...

611
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,879
You met my family?

612
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,715
Pop quiz.

613
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,239
Who have you met,
and what have you learnt?

614
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,271
Okay. Bud, Fritz and Joe are brothers.

615
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,675
Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she...

616
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,949
Cranky? Yes.

617
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,433
<i>Tallulah and Laszlo are their children.</i>

618
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,437
<i>Joe is married to Billie.
Lefty is the butler.</i>

619
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,629
<i>Spike and Dimitri are twins,</i>

620
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,478
and I don't know who they're related to.

621
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,635
Neither do we. Go on.

622
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,036
Lucille is married to Bud,
and your dad, Cornelius, is their son.

623
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,559
What does Cornelius look like?

624
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,920
Tom Selleck.

625
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,909
Okay, Cornelius is married to Franny,
and her brothers are Gaston and Art.

626
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,189
You're forgetting something.

627
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,469
Forgetting? Oh, right.

628
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,955
<i>Wilbur is the son
of Franny and Cornelius.</i>

629
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,638
And nobody realised
you were from the past?

630
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Nope.

631
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,309
Thank you. Thank you.

632
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,720
Hold your applause.
Thank you very much.

633
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,314
Doris, get it off! Get it off!

634
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,512
I've got you now.

635
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,994
Lewis!

636
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,476
No, Lewis is my stupid roommate.

637
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,831
My name's Mike Yagoobian.
People call me Goob,

638
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,350
but today, everyone that beat me up
called me "puke face"

639
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,074
and "butterfingers"
and "booger breath."

640
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,998
Nice to see that they're branching out.

641
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,554
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

642
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,671
Well, I was just looking for Lewis.

643
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,633
Try the roof.
He's always up there being dumb.

644
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,752
Of course. Why didn't I think of that?

645
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,033
Mr Steak, you're my only friend.

646
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,911
Game didn't go so well, huh?

647
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,352
No, I fell asleep in the ninth inning,
and I missed the winning catch.

648
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,198
Then I got beat up.

649
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,359
Afterwards, Coach took me aside
and told me to let it go.

650
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,431
I don't know. He's probably right.

651
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,629
No!

652
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,638
Everyone will tell you to let it go
and move on, but don't.

653
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,639
Instead, let it fester
and boil inside of you.

654
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,512
Take these feelings
and lock them away.

655
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,198
Let them fuel your actions.

656
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,276
Let hate be your ally,

657
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,949
and you will be capable
of wonderfully horrid things.

658
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,036
Heed my words, Goob. Don't let it go.

659
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,349
What?

660
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,358
Where is that boy?

661
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,517
Good idea!
Separate and look for clues.

662
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,512
Look, my dear! Look what I found!
It's a stick.

663
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,798
Now, what did you find?

664
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,472
Yes. Yes, I see.

665
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,592
Time travel residue next to DNA
from Wilbur Robinson.

666
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,917
That plus my stick must mean...

667
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,632
To the future! Shotgun!

668
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,640
I don't even know what I'm doing.

669
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,720
Keep moving forward.

670
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,796
I mean,
this stuff is way too advanced for me.

671
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,955
Keep moving forward.

672
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,071
And what if I can't fix this?
What are we gonna do?

673
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,269
Keep moving forward.

674
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,834
Why do you keep saying that?

675
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,837
And don't just say,
"Keep moving forward."

676
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,234
It's my dad's motto.

677
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,237
Why would his motto be
"keep moving forward"?

678
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,634
It's what he does.

679
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,352
What's that supposed to mean?

680
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,280
That is an excellent question.

681
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,708
Robinson Industries,

682
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,434
the world's leading
scientific-research-and-design factory.

683
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,233
My dad runs the company.
They mass produce his inventions.

684
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,359
His motto, "Keep moving forward."
It's what he does.

685
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,112
- What has he invented?
- Everything.

686
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,037
Carl, the time machine,
the travel tubes.

687
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,799
Your dad invented the time machine?

688
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,319
Yep. Five years ago,

689
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,510
Dad wakes up in the middle
of the night in a cold sweat.

690
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,438
He wants to build a time machine,
so he starts working.

691
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,869
We're talking plans.
We're talking scale models.

692
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,592
We're talking prototypes.

693
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,039
That's a prototype?

694
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,232
- The very first, or what's left of it.
- Yikes.

695
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,476
Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson house.

696
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,397
Prototypes two and three,
not much better.

697
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,714
Number six, 58,

698
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,193
212, 485,

699
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,400
952,

700
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,675
and they all end the same way.

701
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,439
But he doesn't give up.

702
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,034
Dude, I can't take you seriously
in that hat.

703
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,277
He keeps working and working
until finally he gets it,

704
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,913
the first working time machine.

705
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,237
Then he keeps working and working
until finally he gets it again,

706
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,395
the second working time machine.

707
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,669
Kind of small.

708
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,836
I'm assuming that's a joke.
I'm ignoring you for time reasons.

709
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,359
This, my friend, is merely a model

710
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,278
because, unfortunately,
time machine number two

711
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,836
<i>is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy.</i>

712
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,717
- Pretty amazing story, huh?
- Yeah.

713
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,195
Now, are you ready to start working?

714
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,074
I think that's it. I did it!

715
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,553
I knew you could.

716
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,988
Nice work, my friend.

717
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,475
Well, you know what they say!
"Keep moving..."

718
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,079
Don't say it!

719
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,634
<i>Boys! Dinner time!</i>

720
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,875
Not now, Mom!

721
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,470
<i>If you aren't up here in five minutes,
I'm gonna come down and get you!</i>

722
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,276
We'd better get up there.

723
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,112
Let's get that boy!

724
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,155
Sit here?

725
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,872
But I want to look, too.

726
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,599
A mini-Doris!

727
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,792
I didn't even know you could do that.
It's so cute.

728
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,636
Let's take her out for a spin.

729
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,399
Sorry.

730
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,914
Teamwork.

731
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,955
<i>Sorry.</i>

732
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,555
<i>Sorry!</i>

733
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,274
There you are.

734
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,874
Now, to lure him out of the house.

735
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,113
I know! I'll blow it up! Yes!
Yes, and... No.

736
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,273
No, that won't work. Then he'll be dead.

737
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,189
<i>Oh! I know!</i>

738
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,029
I'll turn him into a duck!
Yes! Yes, it's so evil!

739
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,157
I don't know how to do that.

740
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,953
I don't really need a duck.

741
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,315
This may be harder than I thought.

742
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,829
Hey, ring my doorbell.

743
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,678
No, no, no, no, ring this doorbell.

744
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,472
That doorbell will give you a rash.

745
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,391
Yes! I'm two for two, man.

746
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,033
If they don't do it on purpose,
it doesn't count.

747
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,230
- Come on. Read your rule book.
- You know what?

748
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,078
You can take your rule book
and shove it right...

749
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,508
<i>I don't believe in fretting or grieving</i>

750
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,631
<i>Why mess around with strife?</i>

751
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,432
<i>Guess I was cut out
To step out and strut out</i>

752
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,788
<i>Give me the simple life</i>

753
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,674
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

754
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,234
Dinner is served.

755
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,360
Dinner is served.

756
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,718
Hooray! Italian food.

757
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,193
I want a sloppy joe!

758
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,470
Oh, Billie,
could you please pass the gravy?

759
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,749
Coming to you, big girl.

760
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,429
Reminds me of the time
my meatball pizza staved off civil war

761
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,357
on the black moon of Keward.

762
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,071
Where's my sloppy joe?

763
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,553
Thank you for the gravy, Aunt Billie.

764
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,830
- We gotta talk.
- How about some gravy? Over here.

765
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,599
Why is the kid still here?
Any of this ring a bell?

766
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,315
Science fair, Memory Scanner,
a time stream that needs fixing?

767
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,475
Temporary setback.

768
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,318
He's just having
a little confidence issue.

769
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,475
- You want me to talk to him?
- No.

770
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,919
- I give a mean back rub.
- No.

771
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,040
- Shiatsu?
- No.

772
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,229
- Feng shui.
- No.

773
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,588
I've got it under control.

774
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,071
So, Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class?

775
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,235
- No.
- Yes.

776
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,395
- Yes.
- No.

777
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,834
Well, yes and no.

778
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,633
Lewis is a new transfer student.

779
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,955
Yeah.

780
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,469
- Where are you from, Lewis?
- Canada?

781
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,956
I think you mean North Montana.
Hasn't been called Canada in years.

782
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,674
Do you know Sam Gundersen?

783
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,156
- It's a big country.
- State.

784
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,919
- I wonder if you're related.
- Maybe if he took his hat off.

785
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,268
Oh, good idea.

786
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,789
Then we can see
if he has the family cowlick.

787
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,117
He can't,
because he's got bad hat-hair.

788
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,673
Oh, nonsense.

789
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,598
A North Montana man doesn't care
about hat-hair.

790
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,994
Let's see the cowlick!

791
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,473
All right, everyone, hold your horses.

792
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,749
Lewis, do you mind?

793
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,110
I'm afraid
this isn't gonna stop otherwise.

794
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,593
- But... But...
- And so it begins.

795
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,755
Now, don't be shy.

796
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,269
- We're all family here.
- Ready, aim, fire!

797
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,752
Surely, that is not the best you can do.

798
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,553
Impressive, little sister.

799
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,240
Your skills are strong,
but not strong enough.

800
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,555
Your words
do not threaten me, brother.

801
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,070
Then enough words.
Now the real battle begins.

802
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,076
Your meatballs are useless against me.

803
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,636
Then perhaps it's time
for spicy Italian sausage!

804
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,875
No!

805
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,351
That's right. I did it.

806
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,993
Is dinner like this every night?

807
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,838
No, yesterday, we had meatloaf.

808
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,439
Okay, gang,
time for the second course.

809
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,712
And what goes better with meatballs
than P.B. and J?

810
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,716
Hey, that's just like...

811
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,834
Stupid...

812
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,075
Carl?

813
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,200
Is everything all right?

814
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,756
We're just experiencing bugs.

815
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,033
Just what the doctor ordered.

816
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,915
My friend Lewis is an inventor.
He can fix it.

817
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,519
Wilbur, you know I can't.

818
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,312
Come on. Give it a try.

819
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,954
You don't understand
what's at stake here.

820
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,594
Uncle Joe's seen the toast!

821
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,476
We're past the point of no return!

822
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,670
If he doesn't get P.B. and J...

823
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,438
We all pay!

824
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,040
I don't know.

825
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,116
You would really be
helping us out, Lewis.

826
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,355
Please.

827
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,510
One dragonfly on the rocks, please,
Mr Barkeep.

828
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,757
Hey, hey, Frankie, baby,
you gotta tell us one of your jokes.

829
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,519
Yeah, Frankie.
How about that one with the bullfrog?

830
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,392
All right, you bozos.

831
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,195
<i>Have to get that boy out of the house.</i>

832
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,993
<i>Sorry. Wait!</i>

833
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,270
<i>So I turn to the bullfrog,
and you know what I says?</i>

834
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,517
Talking frogs
with their own little outdoor bar,

835
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,234
and so smartly dressed! Perfect!

836
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,715
I says,
"Hey, not with my umbrella, you don't."

837
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,150
- Frankie, you're a riot.
- I gotta go pee!

838
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,759
- I love it.
- You bunch of goons.

839
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,957
That's a good buzz. What the...

840
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,517
Yes! You are now under my control.

841
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,631
I am now under your control.

842
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,032
- Stop laughing.
- Stop laughing.

843
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,958
- Don't repeat everything I say.
- I won't repeat everything you say.

844
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,832
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

845
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,714
Did you just say, "Excellent,"
because I said, "Excellent"?

846
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,195
No.

847
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,436
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

848
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,075
- So, Mr Fix-it, how's it looking?
- Pretty good, Mrs Robinson.

849
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,111
I've recalibrated
the dispensing conduits

850
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,356
and aligned
the ejection mechanism and...

851
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,992
There he is,
that repulsive, half-witted fool!

852
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,872
Now, my slave, seize the boy.

853
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,592
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

854
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,035
Did you not hear what I said, you idiot?
Grab the boy and bring him!

855
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,190
Well, it's just that
there's a million people over there,

856
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,398
and I have little arms.

857
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,191
I'm just not so sure
how well this plan was thought through.

858
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,795
Master?

859
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,715
<i>Master?</i>

860
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,159
Okay, that should do it.

861
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,954
It's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis!

862
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,719
Quickly.
Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer.

863
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,080
Everybody ready?

864
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,872
- Go, Carl.
- Yeah!

865
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,269
Is it gonna work?

866
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,594
Oh, no!

867
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,874
No!

868
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,276
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

869
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,755
- You failed!
- And it was awesome!

870
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,030
- Exceptional!
- Outstanding!

871
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I've seen better.

872
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,755
From failing, you learn.
From success, not so much.

873
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,552
If I gave up every time I failed,

874
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,511
I never would have made
the meatball cannon.

875
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,995
I never would have made
my fireproof pants.

876
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,594
Still working out the kinks.

877
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,880
Like my husband always says...

878
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,593
<i>Keep moving
Keep moving</i>

879
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,720
<i>Stop</i>

880
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,591
Okay, talking frog, not a good minion.

881
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,995
Need another henchman,
something large, not too bright.

882
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,758
Something that won't talk back.

883
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,950
What is he still doing here?
Get rid of him.

884
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,520
Oh, my noggin.

885
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,830
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your lousy mitts off of me!

886
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,871
You're gonna regret this!

887
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,992
Wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it!

888
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,475
I wonder if I should tell Doris.

889
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,790
No, I'll make it a surprise.

890
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,752
All right, everyone, quiet down.
Quiet down.

891
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,509
I propose a toast to Lewis
and his brilliant failure.

892
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,074
May it lead to success in the future.

893
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,750
Gosh, you're all so nice.

894
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,555
If I had a family, I...

895
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,516
I'd want them to be just like you.

896
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,235
Oh, well, then, to Lewis!

897
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,873
To Lewis!

898
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
To Lewis!

899
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,195
Yeah!

900
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,120
- Come on, Lewis!
- Good show, buddy!

901
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,156
What if Louis Armstrong said,
"I can't"?

902
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,429
You think he'd have walked
on the moon?

903
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,790
Dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer.

904
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,315
What did he mean, if he had a family?

905
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,759
Oh, Lewis is an orphan.

906
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,154
Orphan?

907
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,758
- Oh, no!
- Big boy!

908
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,272
Get up, you pansy!

909
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,628
What a great plan!

910
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,878
Go back in time and steal a dinosaur.
Oh, Doris will be so proud of me.

911
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,035
Why didn't you tell me
you had a pet dinosaur?

912
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,160
Because we don't.

913
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,316
What are you talking about?
He's standing right here.

914
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,034
Oh, no! No, you can't eat him!

915
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,718
<i>I need him alive.</i>

916
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,033
Choo-chew on this!

917
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,999
Lewis!

918
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,279
Ready, aim, fire!

919
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,028
Got you!

920
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,510
You messed with the wrong family!

921
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,558
Ding-dong! Pizza's here!

922
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,400
No!

923
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,278
Okay, everybody,
this dino's deep-dished.

924
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,113
Run!

925
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,718
Oh! He ate Carl!

926
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,110
- Help us! Help! Help!
- Oh, goodness!

927
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,880
Oh, no.

928
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,954
Incoming!

929
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,269
Run!

930
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,120
Now, go get that boy!

931
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,440
<i>What's going on?</i>

932
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,640
Why aren't you seizing the boy?

933
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,869
I have a big head...

934
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,638
...and little arms.

935
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,159
I'm just not sure...

936
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,032
...how well this plan was
thought through.

937
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,839
Master?

938
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,040
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

939
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,029
Bowler Hat Guy!

940
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,479
Him you can eat.

941
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,876
- Lewis, run!
- Wilbur!

942
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,360
No!

943
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,319
Oh, no!

944
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,513
Little Doris now sleeps with the fishes.

945
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,549
- Nice catch.
- Nice meatball shooting!

946
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,159
Guess we made
a pretty good team, huh?

947
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,872
Yeah, guess we did.

948
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,591
- Are you boys all right?
- We're good, Mom.

949
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,392
Yeah, didn't you see us
take out that dinosaur?

950
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,750
Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom!

951
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,190
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't...

952
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,833
Oh, Lewis, it's okay.

953
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,598
I'm really happy you're safe.

954
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,472
- Your head.
- What?

955
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,953
It's just a bruise, Lewis.

956
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,555
You all sacrificed so much for me.

957
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,513
- Well, of course.
- You are a special kid.

958
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,789
One of a kind.

959
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,037
Okay, you should get him out of here
before something really bad happens.

960
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,197
Silly, silly robot.
I've got it all under control.

961
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,755
Okay, everybody,
it's been a long, hard day

962
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,677
filled with emotional turmoil
and dinosaur fights,

963
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,598
so why don't you all hit the hay,
and Lewis and me will get going?

964
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,956
Do you have to go now?
I mean, you know, it's getting late.

965
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,390
Maybe Lewis could spend the night.

966
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,317
Mom, maybe some other time, okay?

967
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,228
Well, any time you want to come over,
you just come over.

968
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,272
- Mom.
- The truth is, we love having you.

969
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,789
- We really have to go.
- No.

970
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,597
No, you don't. You have to stay.

971
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,710
I mean, who would be a better family
for you than us?

972
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,993
What do you say, Lewis?

973
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,439
Do you want to be a Robinson?

974
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,838
You want to adopt me?

975
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,838
- Yeah!
- Yes!

976
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,829
Okay, it's true. I'm from the past.

977
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,075
Now you know the big secret.

978
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,159
Wilbur, what have you done?
How could you bring him here?

979
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,077
That is an excellent question.

980
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,633
Please, don't get mad at Wilbur.

981
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,079
He was just being a good friend.

982
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,159
Lewis, I am so sorry,
but you have to go.

983
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,633
What? You just said...

984
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,557
I know what I said.

985
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,557
I'm from the past. So what?

986
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,074
Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're...

987
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,239
You're a great kid,

988
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,158
and we would never do anything
to hurt you,

989
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,910
but I'm sorry.
You have to go back to your own time.

990
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,914
Yeah, about that,
one of the time machines is broken,

991
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,430
and the other one was stolen
by a guy with a bowler hat,

992
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,393
which kind of explains the dino.

993
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,714
I'm calling your father.

994
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,319
Wait. If I have to leave,

995
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,556
can I at least go back
and find my mom?

996
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,318
Wilbur promised.

997
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,589
You promised what?

998
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,472
I was never gonna do it. I swear!

999
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,395
- You lied to me?
- No!

1000
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,680
Yes.

1001
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,274
Lewis! Lewis, wait!

1002
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,756
I can't believe I was dumb enough
to actually believe you were my friend!

1003
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,673
I am your friend!

1004
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,190
Mister, you're grounded till you die.

1005
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,031
<i>Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame.</i>

1006
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:48,029
<i>All he wants to do is go back in time
to meet the mother he never knew,</i>

1007
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,277
<i>but they won't let him.
We'd let him, though.</i>

1008
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,073
<i>Too bad
we don't have a time machine.</i>

1009
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,510
<i>Oh, wait. We do.</i>

1010
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,359
Bowler Hat Guy?

1011
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,393
- Hello, Lewis.
- What do you want?

1012
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,080
To make your dream come true.

1013
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,192
All you have to do is put
Humpty Dumpty back together again,

1014
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,709
and we'll take you back
to find your mommy.

1015
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,589
Lewis!

1016
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,829
Let's just talk about this, Lewis.
Come on!

1017
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,598
I know you're around here somewhere.

1018
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,280
Lewis!

1019
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,919
I can't imagine why you're so interested
in this piece of junk.

1020
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,229
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

1021
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,351
Now, show me how to work this thing.

1022
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,118
It doesn't work. Never did.

1023
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,240
Well, supposing it did,

1024
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,112
and if one were presenting
the invention to, say,

1025
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,152
a board of directors
for a very large invention company,

1026
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,872
where might one find the "On" switch?

1027
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,953
Hypothetically speaking, of course.

1028
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,150
All right, first, you turn this knob twice,

1029
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,838
then push this red button,

1030
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,234
and that's it. It's pretty easy.

1031
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,634
What a stupid way to turn it on!

1032
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,716
Okay, take me to see my mom now.

1033
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,159
Yes, of course.

1034
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,429
Doris?

1035
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,200
We had a deal!

1036
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,077
Crossies! Doesn't count.

1037
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,634
Why are you doing this to me?
I never did anything to you.

1038
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,637
You still haven't figured it out?

1039
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,034
Figured out what?

1040
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,071
Well, let's see if this rings a bell.

1041
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,475
Father of the Future,
inventor extraordinaire,

1042
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,033
"Keep moving forward"?

1043
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,515
That's not me. That's Wilbur's dad.

1044
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,596
Are you saying

1045
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,029
that I'm Wilbur's dad?

1046
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,678
Give the boy a prize.

1047
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,590
You grew up to be the founder
of this wretched time,

1048
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,278
so I plan to destroy your destiny.

1049
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,312
- Easy peasy, rice and cheesy.
- Well...

1050
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,558
So if I'm Wilbur's dad...

1051
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,680
Keep going.

1052
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,918
If I'm Wilbur's dad...

1053
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,632
Yes, thank you, we've established that.

1054
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,320
But what does that have to do
with you?

1055
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,158
Allow me to shed some light
on the subject.

1056
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,319
My old room!

1057
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,715
I think you mean our old room.

1058
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,752
- What?
- Yes! Yes, it is I,

1059
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,108
Mike Yagoobian!

1060
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,270
I know.
I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.

1061
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,753
How did you end up like this?

1062
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:30,476
Well, it's a long and pitiful story
about a young boy with a dream,

1063
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,114
a dream of winning
a Little League championship,

1064
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,710
<i>a dream that was ruined
in the last inning.</i>

1065
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,873
<i>We lost by one run because of me.</i>

1066
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,035
Get him!

1067
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,039
If I hadn't fallen asleep,
I would have caught the ball!

1068
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,111
And we would have won!

1069
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,719
Do you understand?

1070
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,354
<i>For some reason,
no one wanted to adopt me.</i>

1071
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,472
<i>Whiz kid Cornelius Robinson
graduates from college at age 14.</i>

1072
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,149
<i>This year's Nobel Prize goes
to a young Cornelius Robinson.</i>

1073
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,793
Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder.

1074
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,797
Hey, Goob,
wanna come over to my house today?

1075
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,751
<i>They all hated me.</i>

1076
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,271
<i>Eventually, they closed down
the orphanage and everyone left,</i>

1077
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,958
<i>except me.</i>

1078
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,911
<i>Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco.</i>

1079
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,189
<i>- Robinson reaches out to...
- It's new name,</i>

1080
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,231
<i>- Robinson Industries.
- Cornelius Robinson!</i>

1081
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,318
<i>- Cornelius Robinson is now...
- Now here's another amazing...</i>

1082
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:25,389
<i>It was then
that I realised it wasn't my fault.</i>

1083
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,839
<i>It was yours.</i>

1084
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,032
<i>If you hadn't kept me up all night
working on your stupid project,</i>

1085
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,118
<i>then I wouldn't have missed the catch,</i>

1086
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,119
<i>so I devised a brilliant plan
to get my revenge.</i>

1087
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,394
Robinson, you stink!

1088
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,873
<i>Then, just as I was on the brink
of destroying Robinson Industries,</i>

1089
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,630
<i>I met her.</i>

1090
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,756
<i>We retreated to our villainous lair,</i>

1091
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,872
<i>where Doris spun a tale
of deception and woe.</i>

1092
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,276
<i>Apparently, you invented her
to be a Helping Hat,</i>

1093
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,516
<i>a slave to humankind,</i>

1094
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,392
<i>but Doris knew she was capable
of so much more.</i>

1095
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,153
<i>However, you didn't see
her true potential.</i>

1096
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,191
<i>- Got it.
- So you shut her down,</i>

1097
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,471
<i>or so you thought.</i>

1098
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,836
<i>We both had a score
to settle with you,</i>

1099
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:44,399
<i>and while my plan for revenge
was brilliant, Doris' was...</i>

1100
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,277
<i>Well, we went with Doris',</i>

1101
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,799
<i>but I made
a very, very important contribution.</i>

1102
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,268
<i>Together we made the perfect team.</i>

1103
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,040
Wilbur!

1104
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,680
Make sure you shut that door tight,
or else the alarm won't engage.

1105
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,869
Yeah, Mom.

1106
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,709
<i>I went to your house,
snuck in the garage</i>

1107
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,512
<i>and stole the time machine,</i>

1108
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,155
<i>all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid
who forgot to lock the garage door.</i>

1109
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,232
And now all that's left
is to return to Inventco,

1110
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,999
where I'll pass off
your little gizmo as my own.

1111
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,395
But you have no idea
what that could do to this future!

1112
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,512
I don't care. I just want to ruin your life.

1113
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,198
Goob, I had no idea.

1114
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,117
Shut up! And don't call me Goob!

1115
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,800
How many evil villains do you know
who can pull off a name like Goob?

1116
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,191
Look, I'm sorry
your life turned out so bad,

1117
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,311
but don't blame me.
You messed it up yourself.

1118
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,989
You just focused on the bad stuff
when all you had to do was

1119
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,715
let go of the past
and keep moving forward.

1120
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,840
Let's see.

1121
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,713
Take responsibility for my own life
or blame you.

1122
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,474
"Blame you" wins hands down!

1123
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,957
This is gonna be
the best day of my life!

1124
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,877
Doris, would you be a dear
and open the hatch for me, please?

1125
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,828
No!

1126
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,273
Well, I hate to foil your evil plan
and run, but ta-ta!

1127
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,953
But...

1128
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,991
I bet you're glad to see me.

1129
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,071
That's for not locking the garage door.

1130
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,635
You know about that?

1131
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,079
I know everything.

1132
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,200
You gotta admit,

1133
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,316
this will be a great story
to tell me someday.

1134
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,555
Look at that, boys.
We're almost home free.

1135
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,639
Oh, no!

1136
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,997
Take a good look around, boys,

1137
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,714
because your future
is about to change.

1138
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,714
Lewis, you have to fix
the time machine.

1139
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,831
No. No, I can't.

1140
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,276
What about your dad?
You could call him.

1141
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,795
- You are my dad.
- But that's in the future.

1142
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,514
There won't be a future
unless you fix the time machine.

1143
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,468
<i>Look, I messed up.</i>

1144
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,553
I left the garage unlocked,
and I've tried like crazy to fix things,

1145
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,680
but now it's up to you.

1146
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,039
You can do it, Dad.

1147
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:51,275
- Lewis? Lewis!
- Wilbur? Wilbur!

1148
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,275
Wilbur.

1149
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,478
Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty?

1150
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,556
<i>Prepare to be amazed.</i>

1151
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,274
<i>I call it the Memory Scanner.</i>

1152
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,710
<i>So, Yagoobian, any other ideas
you'd like to share with us?</i>

1153
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,071
<i>Yes. I call them Helping Hats.</i>

1154
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,513
<i>They're everywhere!</i>

1155
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,234
<i>Doris, what's happening?
I don't understand.</i>

1156
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:37,033
<i>I just wanted to ruin his future, not this.</i>

1157
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,151
<i>No!</i>

1158
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:49,036
No. No, this can't be happening! No!

1159
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,392
Oh, Lewis, it's already happened.

1160
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,037
Why did I ever invent that stupid hat?

1161
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:05,070
Take a good look around, Doris,
'cause your future's about to change.

1162
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,633
Goob, stop!

1163
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,355
You don't know what you're doing!

1164
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,471
Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future.

1165
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,669
She's using you, Goob,

1166
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,870
and when she gets what she wants,
she'll get rid of you.

1167
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,718
What? What?

1168
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,195
I am never going to invent you.

1169
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,595
Come on, Goob.
I've got to show you something.

1170
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,595
Doris?

1171
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,678
I thought she was my friend.

1172
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,391
You did it, Lewis. You did it!

1173
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,513
I'll hold him while you run for help.

1174
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,640
Let him go.

1175
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,389
What are you doing? He's the bad guy.

1176
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,080
No, he's not. He's my roommate.

1177
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,912
- What?
- He's my old roommate,

1178
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,519
and I really think
you guys should adopt him.

1179
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,756
- Are you nuts?
- Give me one good reason why not.

1180
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,233
I'll give you three good reasons.

1181
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,669
He stole our time machine,
tried to ruin your future,

1182
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,030
and he smells
like he hasn't showered in 30 years!

1183
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,477
May I remind you, I'm your father,
and you have to do what I say.

1184
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,717
Okay, Mr Yagoobian,
do you want to be a...

1185
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,831
- Where'd he go?
- Goob?

1186
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,955
Goob!

1187
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,034
Goob.

1188
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,440
Are you hurt? Any broken bones?

1189
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,073
- No, I'm...
- Do you have a temperature?

1190
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,599
- Brain fog?
- Scurvy?

1191
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,755
- Tapeworm?
- Cellulite?

1192
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,394
No. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine.

1193
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,115
In fact,
better than I've felt in a long time.

1194
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,357
Franny, they're gone.
Oh, this is terrible!

1195
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,152
- Oh, boy.
- Well, he's home early.

1196
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,636
Franny, where are you?
The time machines are gone!

1197
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,392
Ratted out by the old lady.

1198
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,589
Harsh.

1199
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,269
Okay.

1200
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,397
Yeah, beats working
in an office every day.

1201
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,272
Yeah, no kidding.

1202
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,715
Hey!
Want to see the one I'm most proud of?

1203
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,159
Yeah.

1204
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,990
Oh, no, no, no. That one.

1205
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,395
It was our first real invention.

1206
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,718
It's the one that started it all.

1207
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,909
Wowie.

1208
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:59,429
So if I go back now,
then this will be my future.

1209
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,074
Well, that depends on you.

1210
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,200
Nothing is set in stone.

1211
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,909
You gotta make the right choices
and keep moving forward.

1212
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,957
Since it's gonna work this time,
that means I...

1213
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:18,153
We won't finally get to see
what Mom looks like?

1214
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,794
Do we ever meet her?

1215
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,711
I think
you're just gonna have to get back

1216
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,479
to that science fair
and find out for yourself.

1217
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,716
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

1218
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,712
That's because we are one smart kid.

1219
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,520
- So long!
- Bye-bye, Lewis!

1220
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,989
- Farewell, future brother-in-law.
- So long! See you later, Lewis!

1221
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,838
Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes!

1222
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,116
- Have a safe trip, little Lewis.
- I will.

1223
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,912
Hey, while I got you here,

1224
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,316
just a couple of little suggestions
regarding my design.

1225
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,797
Let's face it, these skinny limbs
don't exactly make the teapot whistle.

1226
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,798
All that really matters is,
hey, don't forget to invent me.

1227
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,229
- Are you kidding? No way!
- I love you.

1228
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,715
There's so many things
I wish I could ask you.

1229
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,354
Excuse me.
Time travel now, questions later.

1230
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,480
- But I...
- Don't worry.

1231
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,279
Just get back to that science fair,
and we'll see you real soon.

1232
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,631
Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye.

1233
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,194
- Goodbye, son.
- Thanks again for everything!

1234
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,709
- Wait. Lewis, one more thing.
- Yeah?

1235
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,516
Just a little tip for the future.
I am always right.

1236
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:30,438
Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.

1237
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,512
She's right.
I'd just go with it if I were you.

1238
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,628
And I am.

1239
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,072
Then you're absolutely right.

1240
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,312
All right, I'm coming.

1241
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,637
Well, it's not like
you're never gonna see them again.

1242
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,478
They are your family, after all.

1243
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,120
Wait a minute.

1244
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,191
You're supposed to take me back
to the science fair.

1245
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,435
I know.

1246
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,439
Well, I think
you punched in the wrong numbers.

1247
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,074
We agreed that,
if you fixed the time machine,

1248
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,997
I'd take you back to see your mom.

1249
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,235
What?

1250
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,400
A deal's a deal.

1251
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,473
I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go?

1252
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,237
Because I already have a family.

1253
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:11,510
I never thought my dad
would be my best friend.

1254
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,550
Now, now, don't make me come
and bail you out again.

1255
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,280
I won't.

1256
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,277
Remember, I've got a time machine.

1257
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,833
If you mess up again,
I'll just keep coming back

1258
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,075
till you get it right.

1259
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,798
- You got that motto?
- I got it.

1260
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,114
Don't forget it.

1261
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,958
I don't think that's possible.

1262
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,509
You better get going.

1263
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,759
See you later, Wilbur.

1264
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,879
Wait a minute!

1265
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,031
Goob! Goob, wake up!

1266
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,160
What?

1267
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,279
That's it!

1268
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,713
Mr Willerstein,
I know what went wrong.

1269
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,956
Can I have one more chance? Please!

1270
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,673
My ride isn't here yet, so fire it up.

1271
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,838
I need a volunteer.

1272
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,598
Now, just give me a date to input.

1273
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,073
Well, now, let's see.

1274
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,198
There's my first science fair,
the day I got my first microscope,

1275
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,312
the time I swam the English Channel,
my first gold medal for the luge.

1276
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,555
I know.

1277
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,834
Perfect!

1278
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,638
<i>- You look gorgeous.
- He's a lucky guy.</i>

1279
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,358
Oh! It works.

1280
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,835
- It works!
- It works.

1281
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,550
<i>You look beautiful, Lucille.</i>

1282
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,715
Bud?

1283
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,791
- Would you look at that?
- Whoa!

1284
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,638
Honey! Honey, you're just in time.

1285
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,513
- Lucille!
- You did it, Lewis! You did it!

1286
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,959
This invention is brilliant!

1287
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,479
Kid, you're this fair's MVP!

1288
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,636
That was some show you put on.

1289
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,070
You're a real special kid,

1290
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,832
but you don't look like a Lewis.
You look more like a...

1291
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,554
Cornelius. I get that a lot.

1292
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,989
Oh, no! Sorry, mister.

1293
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,439
No harm done.

1294
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,510
Frankie, what have I told you
about running away?

1295
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,870
- Frankie?
- My star pupil.

1296
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,676
My name's Franny,
and I teach frogs music.

1297
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,869
Really?

1298
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,558
You know that frogs
have more musical ability than people?

1299
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,989
But nobody believes me.

1300
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,791
They all think I'm crazy.

1301
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,753
You think I'm crazy, too.

1302
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,758
No. No, I think you're right.

1303
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,838
Over here? There he is.

1304
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,032
Kid, we'd like to get a story
on you for the local paper.

1305
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,628
You've got a bright future ahead of you.

1306
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,834
<i>Let it go</i>

1307
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:28,995
Yeah.

1308
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,238
<i>Let it roll right off your shoulder</i>

1309
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,759
<i>Don't you know</i>

1310
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,789
<i>The hardest part is over</i>

1311
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,478
<i>Let it in</i>

1312
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,193
<i>Let your clarity define you</i>

1313
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,833
<i>In the end</i>

1314
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:50,079
<i>We will only just remember
How it feels</i>

1315
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,396
<i>Let it slide</i>

1316
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,198
<i>Let your troubles fall behind you</i>

1317
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,038
<i>Let it shine</i>

1318
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,560
<i>Until you feel it all around you</i>

1319
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,280
<i>And I don't mind</i>

1320
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,119
<i>If it's me you need to turn to</i>

1321
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,390
<i>We'll get by</i>

1322
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,198
<i>It's the heart that really matters
In the end</i>

1323
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,194
<i>Our lives are made</i>

1324
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,914
<i>In these small hours</i>

1325
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,509
<i>These little wonders</i>

1326
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,433
<i>These twists and turns of fate</i>

1327
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,950
<i>Time falls away</i>

1328
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,152
<i>But these small hours</i>

1329
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:45,400
<i>These small hours still remain</i>

1330
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,990
<i>All of my regret</i>

1331
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,799
<i>Will wash away somehow</i>

1332
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,474
<i>But I cannot forget</i>

1333
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,751
<i>The way I feel right now</i>

1334
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,558
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1335
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,756
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1336
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,797
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1337
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,315
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1338
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,473
<i>The future's arrived</i>

1339
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,079
<i>Nobody can doubt</i>

1340
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,158
<i>The future is what everything's about</i>

1341
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,953
<i>It's better for you
And it's better for me</i>

1342
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,312
<i>It's better than what everybody
Thought it would be</i>

1343
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,317
<i>The future has arrived</i>

1344
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,280
<i>The future has arrived today</i>

1345
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,393
<i>The future's alive</i>

1346
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,953
<i>Alive as can be</i>

1347
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:08,399
<i>Just open your eyes</i>

1348
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,078
<i>It's plain to see</i>

1349
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,599
<i>Just don't be afraid</i>

1350
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,438
<i>Just keep going on</i>

1351
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:16,233
<i>One step at a time
And you can't go wrong</i>

1352
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,794
<i>It's time to create</i>

1353
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,831
<i>Time to grow</i>

1354
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,393
<i>If you feel right</i>

1355
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,637
<i>The world, yeah
She's changing</i>

1356
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,274
<i>Don't it make you feel alive?</i>

1357
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,838
<i>The future has arrived</i>

<i>The future is alive today</i>

1361
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,312
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1362
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,193

<i>The world, yeah
She's changing</i>

1372
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,277
<i>And life's rearranging</i>

1373
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,231

<i>The future has arrived today</i>

1391
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,954
<i>Waiting to cross the Rubicon</i>

1392
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:28,596
<i>Wondering what side I'm on</i>

1393
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,596
<i>What are these visions
Of me as a young man</i>

1394
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:39,477
<i>With one arm pointing
And the other arm holding your hand?</i>

1395
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:44,196
<i>Needing a plan to keep you near</i>

1396
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:49,075
<i>Blowing a horn so you can hear</i>

1397
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:54,036
<i>If it was only my love and devotion</i>

1398
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:58,517
<i>This world would suddenly be
In a state of</i>

1399
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:02,838
<i>Commotion</i>

1400
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:07,598
<i>Emotional commotion</i>

<i>Emotional commotion</i>

<i>Emotional commotion</i>

1404
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,359
<i>I never get around
Under the sun and the stars</i>

1405
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:51,112
<i>And I may be always frowning</i>

1406
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:55,313
<i>But one day you will see
Under the sun and the stars</i>

1407
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:00,958
<i>You will turn around
And I'll be</i>

1408
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:05,039
<i>In motion</i>

1409
