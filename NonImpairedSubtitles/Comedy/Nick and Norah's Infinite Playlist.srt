1
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,787
<i>Hey, this is Tris.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

2
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:06,192
Hey, Tris, it's Nick. How are you?
It's about 3 in the afternoon.

3
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,663
I think you're probably
still at school.

4
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,762
I stayed home today.
I took a personal day.

5
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,065
I wanted to finish up
some creative projects...

6
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,733
...and stuff that I've been working on
around here.

7
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,342
Nothing to do with you or anything.

8
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,781
So I'm sorry, real sorry I missed you.
I was hoping to get you on the phone.

9
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,952
Haven't talked to you in a while...

10
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,829
...and I just kind of wanted to
speak to you at some point.

11
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,496
You know, I think last time
we spoke...

12
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:45,467
...we both kind of said some really
nasty things that neither of us meant.

13
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,697
You know, just, like...

14
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,472
...when you broke up with me,
you know...

15
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,668
...and everything, on my b-day.

16
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:06,386
Also, that mixed CD
that I left on your doorstep...

17
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,426
...was the last one
that I'll be making for you.

18
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,322
More or less.

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,129
Anyway, give me a call.

20
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,566
I'm doing very well.
I hope you're great.

21
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,171
Have a great weekend,
and do something fun, you know.

22
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,308
Just get out there.

23
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,637
Call me, though,
when you get a chance.

24
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,676
All right. Bye.

25
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,109
<i>Message has been deleted.</i>

26
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:30,738
Fuck.

27

<i>To re-record

28
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,222
Norah.

29
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,594
Norah.

30
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,755
It's Friday, pumpkin.

31
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,696
I'm sorry. Do you mind?
I'm in my zone.

32
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,733
- Oh, you're in your zone. I'm so...
- What?

33
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,927
- What?
- What?

34
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,128
What? What? What?

35
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,898
Could you please
come join my zone?

36
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,132
Hey, guys.

37
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,640
- Hi.
- Hey, Tris.

38
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,106
He made another one.

39
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,678
Look at the ridiculous cover art.

40
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,406
L...

41
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,313
Don't.

42
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,611
- Don't do it.
- Don't do what?

43
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,484
Let's go already.

44
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,923
He makes the best mixes in the world.
Look at this cover art.

45
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,827
Tris does not know
what she gave up.

46
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:56,123
<i>"Road to Closure Volume 12"?
Poor bastard.</i>

47
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,964
You are so in love with this guy
it is ridiculous.

48
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,663
Okay, I have never met him.
I have no idea who he is.

49
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,501
I'm just gonna put this in my iPod.

50
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,657
Is that always there?

51
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,693
Yes, always.

52
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,063
Sorry.

53
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,172
That's where we put the garbage.

54
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:40,701
Yo.

55
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,210
- Yo.
- I'm not going.

56
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,145
- What do you mean you're not going?
- Let's load the van.

57
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,581
I don't wanna go.
I'm taking a mental-health day.

58
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,153
We have a gig, Nicky.
This is a big night for us.

59
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,221
This is our first night
with our new name.

60
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,360
We are the Jerk Offs,
and we finally found a drummer.

61
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,586
You found a drummer? Who?

62
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,325
That's a children's toy.
Who's gonna operate that thing?

63
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,661
- You.
- Okay. Thanks for coming by, guys.

64
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,159
Nicky.

65
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:06,694
We love you, okay...

66
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,670
...but you've been depressed
for a month and it's not cool.

67
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,935
Get your clothes.
We're gonna play this gig...

68
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,703
...then find you something better.

69
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,904
- Someone better.
- Yes.

70
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,414
Not that easy. You don't know
what it's like to be straight. It's awful.

71
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,484
<i>- Jersey's only source for indie rock.</i>

72
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,986
<i>And for all of you
Where's Fluffy fans out there...</i>

73
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,717
<i>...for the first time since the last time,
looks like Fluffy's to be found...</i>

74
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,395
<i>...somewhere in the five boroughs
tonight.</i>

75
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,360
<i>The rarest show on Earth

76
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,625
<i>...so keep an eye out
for those white rabbits.</i>

77
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,030
<i>You never know
where they might lead you.</i>

78
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,137
Fluffy. You can't say no to Fluffy.

79
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,206
- Okay, all right. I'll go.
- Yes.

80
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,639
- Let me put some clothes on.
- Put some clothes on.

81
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,246
- But I'm taking my own car.
- And put on some pants.

82
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,074
- Oh, my God.
- What?

83
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,274
Okay.

84
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,920
I just got a text from Carrie
saying Where's Fluffy...

85
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,250
...is doing a surprise show tonight.
- Oh, my God.

86
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,792
Last time they had a surprise show
it was at Arlene's. Start there.

87
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,257
Okay, wait.

88
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,230
Promise me that you won't get drunk
and leave me alone the whole night.

89
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,698
When have I ever done that?
I promise.

90
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,063
Caroline.

91
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:16,230
Did you hear? Who's Fluffy is playing
in the city tonight. I love that band.

92
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,910
It's "Where's Fluffy. "

93
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,943
Whatever. So I'm bringing this guy.

94
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,378
He's been following me around
the mall for months.

95
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,178
- Maybe it's your scent.
- Yeah, what's that called?

96
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,979
"I Cheat on People"
by Calvin Klein?

97
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,753
And what do you wear?
"My Daddy's Famous" by Dior?

98
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:36,418
- All right, you're both pretty.
- I was only kidding. So sensitive.

99
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,994
Okay, talk to you later.

100
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,359
Bye.

101
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,535
- Why do you humor her?
- She's not that bad.

102
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,967
We grew up with her.
Just don't let it ruin your night.

103
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,333
Fluffy.

104
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,475
- Fluffy. Fluffy.
- Fluffy. Fluffy.

105
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,540
Goddamn it. Come on.

106
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,949
Cheers.

107
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,558
- Hey, baby, you look good.
- No, you look good, baby.

108
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,984
- Give it.
- It's mine.

109
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,447
We are the Jerk Offs.

110
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,882
Nick, the drum machine. Turn it off.

111
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,856
I don't know how this works.
There's no off button.

112
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,493
You suck!

113
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,827
Drum machines suck.

114
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,100
Your mother buy that for you?

115
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,672
- Oh, my God, you dirty little slut.
- What? What did I...?

116
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,933
You're practically blowing him
with your eyes.

117
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:16,080
I am not. You cannot do anybody
with your eyes, Caroline.

118
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,649
Well, you can. But whatever.
He's a complete mo, look at him.

119
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,685
He is not a mo.
Look at how shitty he's dressed.

120
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,822
- His Supercuts haircut. He's coming.
- I know.

121
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,159
Sorry. I'm sorry.

122
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,151
That was really good.

123
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,389
Well, he's bridge-and-tunnel,
obviously.

124
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,090
If he's bridge-and-tunnel,
then what does that make us?

125
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,270
Doesn't make us anything.
You're very drunk. Come on, let's go.

126
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,441
Whatever, you're drunk.
Why don't you cut the cord, Mom?

127
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,037
Hi.

128
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,876
- God.
- Hi, I've been looking at you guys.

129
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,606
Have you been looking at me?

130
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,511
Hey, Nicky.

131
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,716
Ask this beefy guy
what his name is for me.

132
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,527
- What's your name?
- Anything you want it to be.

133
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,756
- He's creepy.
- He's harmless.

134
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,492
And he's gonna help us find Fluffy.

135
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,532
What's your problem?

136
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,370
She's here.

137
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,571
You told her
not to come to the shows.

138
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,209
I did. She came anyway.

139
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,208
Don't even think
about going over there.

140
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,938
I need to say hi if she came
all this way to see me.

141
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,874
Dude, don't give into temptation.
She's not worth it.

142
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,512
Oh, my God. I love it.

143
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,782
- Happy anniversary.
- Thank you so much.

144
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,985
- Oh, my God, all right, how's it look?
- Fits great. It looks really good.

145
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,180
Is it too long in the back?

146
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,026
No.

147
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,021
So you like it?

148
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,623
Yeah.

149
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,694
- Come here.
- Good.

150
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,073
- Who do you belong to?
- Tris. Tris.

151
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:25,107
No, no, louder. Who do you belong to?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear you.

152
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,811
Norah.

153
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,210
Alone again?

154
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,349
Hey, Tris.
Been looking for you everywhere.

155
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,855
This is the one I was telling you about.
You have friends who'd be into her?

156
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,052
You know what, that's okay.
Thanks, anyway.

157
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,128
Oh, well, you know,
Gary's in college.

158
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,698
You could have better luck
with college guys.

159
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,894
That's when guys really get into stuff
like how smart a girl is, you know?

160
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,834
It's not all about looks.

161
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,469
Yeah. Gary seems real deep.

162
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,907
But I guess Ira Silverberg's daughter
doesn't have to worry about looks.

163
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,211
- I came here with someone, actually.
- Really?

164
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,913
- Yep.
- Who?

165
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,524
My boyfriend.

166
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,194
Your boyfriend?

167
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,384
Yeah.

168
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,655
Guess you should be getting
back to him, then.

169
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:20,991
Yeah.

170
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,533
Okay. I'm gonna go see him, then.

171
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:39,776
Hi.

172
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,444
I know this is gonna sound weird,
and I'm a stranger...

173
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,056
...but would you be my boyfriend
for five minutes?

174
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,247
What?

175
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:51,991
Him?

176
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,024
Okay, just be cool. Just be cool.

177
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,262
Just, please, just go with it, okay?

178
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,919
Nick. Norah.

179
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,491
How do you guys, like,
know each other?

180
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,990
What?

181
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:29,831
We go to the same dentist together.

182
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,570
Dr. Mann.

183
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,907
<i>Manno Mannowitz.</i>

184
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,601
Come on, Gary.

185
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,279
Hey, did you get my mixes?

186
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,609
How do you know Tris?

187
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,482
Mixes? Are you Tris' Nick?

188
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,590
She told you about me?
How do you know her?

189
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,282
Oh, dear God.

190
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,226
Go.

191
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,767
That tastes so good.

192
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,769
Help, help, help. I just made out
with Tris' sloppy seconds.

193
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,635
What's the problem now?

194
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,540
Caroline, the problem is that this is not
gonna compete with perfect little that.

195
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,874
Okay? It's time to go. Night is over.

196
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,777
- I fell.
- I know you fell.

197
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,508
Let me give you a hand with that.

198
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,244
- I gotta get her home.
- Are you going back to Englewood?

199
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,913
- I can take you. That where you live?
- Do I look like I'm from Englewood?

200
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,357
I don't know if you're saying
that you are from there or you're not.

201
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,497
That's one super cut
you got there, dude.

202
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,257
- Think she's drunk.
- Oh, yeah.

203
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,493
I'm just parked right out front.
I think we can walk her out there.

204
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,332
- Wait. Stop.
- What?

205
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,065
- Are you mad at me?
- No, Caroline.

206
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,767
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

207
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,469
Hi.

208
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,237
Hi.

209
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,246
Hi, we're Bishop Allen.

210
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:05,523
- Try to walk. Focus on walking.
- Hi, guys. So look, I need you.

211
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,822
What?

212
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,598
Can we get a ride?

213
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:14,935
Who...? We? Is that...? Are you...?
You and this fellow here? Is that "we"?

214
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,103
- Well...
- Sorry, Tris, the car's full.

215
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,675
You didn't say "hi" to me earlier.
Are you mad at me?

216
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,083
I think you should probably
take Drunkzilla here...

217
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,219
...back to Daddy's house anyway,
don't you?

218
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,581
And I was just talking to Nick, so...

219
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,950
You know what, Tris? There's no room
for you, okay? Not tonight. Come on.

220
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,266
Well, that's cool. I'll catch up with
you guys. It's a small car, anyway.

221
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,934
You guys have fun.

222
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,695
Not now, Gary.

223
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,483
Sorry.

224
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,058
Give me a minute.

225
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,892
Damn it. Why won't she turn?

226
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,936
- I think it's gotta cool down.
- Yugo.

227
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,567
Yeah, you don't see many of these
Easter eggs on the road.

228
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,906
Yeah. Once you buy one
you see them everywhere.

229
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,880
Oh, yeah? It's pretty small.
In mint condition, though.

230
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,748
Yeah. This is the result of a lot
of time and care.

231
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,779
Unfortunately.

232
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,527
- You off-duty?
- This isn't a cab.

233
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,719
Are you off-duty?

234
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,796
It's not a cab, my friend, I promise you.

235
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,297
Okay, don't get mad.

236
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,594
I wasn't getting mad.

237
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,637
What is that?

238
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,210
It's not as ominous as it seems.

239
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,108
I told you they look cute together.

240
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,277
Okay, here's the plan.
I'm gonna go give Nicky a pep talk.

241
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,953
Dev, clean up the girl.

242
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,356
Nick. I had a feeling
you two might get stuck.

243
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,527
- Having some trouble?
- Stalled again?

244
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,355
Hi, Thom. Hi, beefy guy.

245
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,299
- Lady friend.
- Yes?

246
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,663
Dev could use your assistance
in the van, if you please. Thank you.

247
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,996
In the van?

248
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:30,005
In the van. Large vehicle right there?
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

249
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,583
Hi.

250
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,810
Try this.

251
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,846
What?

252
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,422
Let's just say we're not the biggest
fans of his ex.

253
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,355
And we've decided
you're to be his salvation.

254
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:53,729
Besides, we saw you two making out,
and we think you're the one.

255
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,394
We just gotta get you
out of that sports bra.

256
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:03,508
- This isn't a sports bra.
- Come on. We're all ladies here.

257
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,371
<i>Are you seriously
talking about Tris right now?</i>

258
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,776
I think this might be my opportunity
to get some answers, you know?

259
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,747
Do not talk to this girl
about Tris, Nicky. I mean it.

260
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,920
Look, we'll take
the drunk mess home.

261
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,386
You kids go find Fluffy, text us
when you do and we'll meet you there.

262
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,183
What could possibly go wrong?

263
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,057
Okay.

264
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,693
Oh, it's better than the uni-boob.

265
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,363
Thanks a lot.

266
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,208
This isn't gonna work, okay?
He's hung up on Tris.

267
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,642
You look gorgeous.
And let me tell you something:

268
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:47,410
Nicky is definitely worth the underwire.
He just needs a little push, that's all.

269
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,453
Shit.

270
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,328
Oh, God. I gotta get my friend home.

271
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,963
- We'll do it.
- What?

272
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,498
We'll do it. Go find Fluffy.

273
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,135
Go.

274
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,931
- Hey, unlock the door, please.
- Hi, hello?

275
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,769
Caroline? Honey, can you hear me?

276
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,470
Aren't you a sweet thing?

277
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,114
- Wake up, Caroline.
- Wake up.

278
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,783
- Wake up, Caroline.
- Get out.

279
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,748
Please be careful. This is not a toy.

280
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,783
- Can you...?
- You just need to be quiet.

281
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,310
Unlock the door, bitch.

282
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,375
Please don't be mad at me.
I'm right here.

283
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,946
Caroline. Just like we practiced.
Go like this.

284
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,514
I'm right here.

285
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,653
- You don't have to yell at me.
- Go like that. Up, up a little.

286
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,043
- Yes.
- Yeah.

287
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,890
- Everybody, move along. Thank you.
- I got her.

288
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,519
- All right.
- I did it.

289
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,665
- I can see the head.
- Come with me. Come with me.

290
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,567
I got her.

291
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,329
Okay. Nobody look.

292
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,528
I got her.

293
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,505
If you touch one hair on her head,
I will kill all of you.

294
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,737
Norah, I'm being carried.
You look so...

295
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,740
She'll be okay.

296
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,315
Is she conscious?

297
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,749
She'll be okay.
They're not gonna kill her.

298
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,989
Eyes up here.

299
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,876
So where do you think Fluffy's
gonna be?

300
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,879
- Should we try Mercury Lounge?
- Yeah, that's good.

301
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,848
But you know Fluffy's not going on
till super late, though.

302
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,023
So I guess we have some time
to kill, then.

303
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,396
So...

304
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,133
...your friends are all gay, right?

305
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:21,861
Not all my friends.

306
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,136
Not all your friends,
but the ones in the van are gay?

307
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,869
Yeah, I mean, they're all gay. Yeah.

308
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,540
One hundred percent, you know, gay.
Gay every day, all the time.

309
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,582
Okay. That's a relief.

310
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,415
If anyone's gonna get raped
in that van, it will be a guy.

311
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,117
That's good.

312
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,151
You wanna get a drink or something?

313
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,291
- I don't drink at all.
- I don't either.

314
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,864
You don't?
Are you straightedge like I am?

315
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,002
I don't really subscribe to any label.

316
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,903
Fine.

317
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,673
Hey. What's that banging?

318
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,954
- Is it my car?
- I think it's drums. Get it?

319
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,287
Get it? Rhythm?
Rhythmic drumming on drums?

320
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,552
Because when you're in a band,
you need drums.

321
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,855
And you're in a band,
and you don't have drums.

322
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,190
Thanks.

323
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,132
I haven't heard that before.

324
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,833
I didn't mean your band wasn't good.
I just meant you need a drummer.

325
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,634
You can just drop me off up here
if you want.

326
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,603
- Yo. Yo.
- Oh, my God.

327
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,304
Taxi. Yeah.

328
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,285
- Hi.
- Hey. Bowery Ballroom.

329
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,284
No, I'm not a cab, sir.
I'm not a cab. I'm not a cab.

330
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,487
- It's so good to be alone.
- Finally.

331
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,360
- Bowery Ballroom?
- You made that happen.

332
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,929
Oh, God, yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

333
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,464
- I do that?
- Yeah, you do that.

334
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,483
- So are you from Englewood?
- Yep.

335
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,251
Englewood, up to no good.

336
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,594
- I'm from Hoboken.
- Hoboken, no joking. What?

337
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,495
- I love you.
- I love you.

338
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,670
I love you so much it's retarded.

339
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,708
So are you going off to college?

340
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,502
You smell so good.

341
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:43,044
- I don't know. I got into Brown.
- Oh, you smell like soap.

342
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,513
But I have this job lined up here
which is...

343
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,250
I don't know,
and I have to make up my mind fast...

344
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,582
...because they're only holding
my spot at Brown until tomorrow.

345
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,249
- I'm going to Berklee School of Music.
- Oh, yeah?

346
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,622
- It's in Boston.
- That's awesome.

347
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,458
If you went to Brown,
we'd only be an hour away.

348
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,963
Yes.

349
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,224
What's wrong?

350
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,131
- Cramp.
- What? What? Hold on.

351
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,432
- My hand's stuck in the seat belt.
- Cramp, cramp, cramp. Cramp.

352
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,972
Okay, last stop. Get out, please.

353
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,551
- What do I owe you?
- It's $8.50.

354
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,914
- There you go, man.
- Okay.

355
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,052
- Thanks for the ride.
- Okay. Careful, now.

356
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,890
- Oh, my God.
- All right, hey.

357
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,897
Cherish one another, folks.

358
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,656
Don't slam my door, please.

359
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,966
Nice folks. Charged a little extra
for the cleanup.

360
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,671
That's gonna be fun.

361
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,270
Thanks for sticking that out with me.

362
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,143
Yeah.

363
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:02,993
<i>So that's it, Tris.</i>

364
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,652
<i>That's the breakup mix.
Ten songs from my broken...</i>

365
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,158
That was not even real.

366
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,271
Can we go straight
to laughing about this?

367
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,302
- I have to pee.
- Okay.

368
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:17,866
Go pee.

369
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,713
- Hey, how you been?
- Hi.

370
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,430
Caroline, pick up the phone.

371
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,669
Caroline.

372
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,709
Look, Dev, I am sick and tired
of arguing about our band's name.

373
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,248
- What about Shit Sandwich?
- What about Shit Sandwich?

374
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,011
We are Shit Sandwich.

375
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,655
Whatever happened to Dickache?
I liked Dickache.

376
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:09,190
- I got it. What about The Tight Ends?
- Going Balls Deep.

377
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,974
Norah! Norah! Norah!

378
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,807
Brooklyn Pool. I got a clue.

379
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,381
Hey. You are not gonna believe this.

380
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,092
So can't we talk about
how cool Fluffy is?

381
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,663
- They're my favorite band in the world.
- They're my favorite band.

382
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,959
I've gotten so many people
into that band.

383
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,158
Me too.

384
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,533
I had a bootleg of "Black Carnage"
before anybody else ever heard it.

385
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,641
I was the first person
outside of the band to hear that song.

386
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,538
- Okay. Yeah.
- I'm sure that I was.

387
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,542
We went to see them
at the Elbow Room.

388
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,612
- Yes?
- And it was a total bait and switch.

389
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,183
- Are You Randy showed up instead.
- That literally makes me wanna die.

390
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,787
Yeah, I hate those guys. I was the one
that got her into Where's Fluffy.

391
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:45,978
It was me.

392
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,752
She'd never even heard of them until I
put one of their songs on a CD for her.

393
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,657
- Tris. I'm talking about Tris.
- Is that right?

394
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,231
How well do you know each other?
You go to Sacred Heart together or?

395
00:28:56,434 --> 00:29:00,962
Do you guys talk a lot?
Talk about her new boyfriend?

396
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:05,973
I cannot believe Tris dated a
straightedge. That's, like, astounding.

397
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,044
What did she say about me?
She said I was a straightedge?

398
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,216
Can I ask, what did you see
in her? I could floss with that girl.

399
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,816
This is your friend?

400
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,351
All right. I'm the bad guy now. This
what we're doing? I'm the bad guy?

401
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,956
If you really wanna know, she actually
supported our music and our band...

402
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,322
...when nobody else did,
not that that's any of your business.

403
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,222
- Okay, forget it. I can't do this.
- Do what?

404
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,560
Just make a U-turn and take me back
to Ludlow. I'll find my own way.

405
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,703
- Perfect.
- I refuse to be the goodie bag...

406
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,838
...at your party.
- You don't have to yell.

407
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,064
It's not a train station.
We're in a car.

408
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,334
- Just drop me off.
- I will.

409
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,602
Oh, my God!

410
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,275
Are you crazy?

411
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,183
I don't know what I did
to make you so angry.

412
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,619
- Nothing. You're ridiculous.
- You don't know me.

413
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,622
- I know you. I know your make.
- My make?

414
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,761
You're an emo-band boy,
obsessed with Tris?

415
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,726
They could make action figures of you.
Drummer not included.

416
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,923
It's funny that Tris
never mentioned you.

417
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,399
But she did mention some frigid,
jealous JAP that was jealous of her...

418
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,266
...and who was a complete bitch.
- Oh, jealous? Oh, really?

419
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,170
- I know who she was referring to.
- Let's dance, douche bag.

420
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,436
Sweetheart,
you think you have something to...

421
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,910
I am not jealous!

422
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,977
Oh, no, man, she's not jealous.

423
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,320
Awesome. Awesome night.

424
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,554
<i>- So how's it going?
- It was great until she choked me out.</i>

425
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,165
<i>- Kinky.
- What's up with you guys?</i>

426
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,358
Well, everything's fine here,
Nick. Peachy.

427
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,368
<i>- It's just we sort of kind of lost the girl.
- What girl?</i>

428
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:42,870
You know, the girl.

429
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:44,897
What?

430
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,976
<i>Yeah, well, we came to
Gray's Papaya to grab a bite to eat...</i>

431
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,670
<i>...and she must've woke up.
The chick's flown the coop.</i>

432
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:54,079
<i>- Thom, that's not acceptable.
- I know.</i>

433
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,776
So the shitbox stall again?
You want us to pick you up?

434
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,216
Thom, you have to find her.

435
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,756
<i>We already looked everywhere,
Nicky. She's not in the van.</i>

436
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,986
<i>She's not in Gray's Papaya.
She's gone.</i>

437
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:11,134
So I think now is the time
we cut our losses and go find Fluffy.

438
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,998
<i>Right? Hello, Nicky?</i>

439
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,935
Hey, Tal, it's me. Where are you?

440
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,845
<i>- Hey.
- Norah?</i>

441
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,674
They lost Caroline.

442
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,148
What?

443
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,477
<i>Norah?</i>

444
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,587
You kids been drinking?

445
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:40,786
- No.
- No.

446
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,160
Why not?
We're having a search party.

447
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,029
Search party!

448
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:46,826
God.

449
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,395
Party.

450
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:53,008
Search party, N.Y.C.
Search party, N.Y.C.

451
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,744
Caroline, where the hell
can you be?

452
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,710
- Caroline.
- Caroline.

453
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,680
Caroline.

454
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,182
Caroline.

455
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,477
Caroline!

456
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,418
Guys, we need to be adults right now.

457
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:10,287
- I don't have $ 11.
- How much do you have?

458
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,193
- Total?
- Yeah.

459
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,329
One dollar.

460
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,572
One dollar won't get you to Newark.

461
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:31,171
Oh, no, no. I didn't say
I wanted to go to Newark.

462
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,212
That's so funny.

463
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,850
Okay. I'm just gonna
tell you something.

464
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,754
I was kidnapped tonight. Seriously.

465
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,920
In this van with these guys
talking about going balls deep.

466
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,325
Sounds like fun, right?
Not always. Scary.

467
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,066
I just think the Jerk Offs
isn't hardcore enough.

468
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,405
We are not calling ourselves
Shit Sandwich, and that is final.

469
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:06,014
I want my stepfather to have the
possibility of seeing one of our shows.

470
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,118
Yeah, well, I'm a third of this group,
too, Thom, if not more.

471
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,483
- How are you more?
- I'm the lead singer.

472
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,153
- You all right?
- I can't believe...

473
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,594
...I'm missing Where's Fluffy
for this.

474
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,899
- Where's Fluffy? Where?
- Well, supposedly at Brooklyn Pool.

475
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,937
We can't go, because we
need to relocate the entire person...

476
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,404
...you guys managed to lose.

477
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,937
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, come on.

478
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:38,479
Okay. Listen, she's probably there.
I mean, the chick likes to party.

479
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,877
I say we do a drive-by.

480
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,215
No. Absolutely not. No drive-bys.

481
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:48,050
Look, the sooner we find Caroline,
the sooner we can find Fluffy...

482
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,988
...and the sooner this
will be over.

483
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,225
Okay.

484
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,525
You know,
if you don't have a drummer...

485
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:01,398
...then why do you have drums,
you fistful of assholes?

486
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,736
Fistful of Assholes.

487
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,911
I like it.

488
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,794
Hi, I'm Caroline. What's your name?

489
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,858
That's okay,
you don't have to tell me.

490
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,528
It's been, like, one of those nights,
you know?

491
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,168
I was with my friend Norah,
who you don't know...

492
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:39,343
...but you would really like her
because everybody likes Norah...

493
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:43,275
...and she left me tonight, which is...
She never does that.

494
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,971
And then I was kidnapped.

495
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,313
And then she...
Usually when I go home with her...

496
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,286
...she makes me a turkey sandwich
when I get home...

497
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:56,289
...but I might never get home,
you know?

498
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,926
And I'm so tired.

499
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,508
Is that a turkey sandwich?

500
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,509
It is.

501
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,317
Can you hold this for me?

502
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,756
Thank you so much.

503
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,655
Oh, my God.

504
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,656
Hi.

505
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,003
I just need my gum.

506
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,421
Okay, Englewood.

507
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:07,029
Okay. Well, the last bus to Englewood
left seven minutes ago.

508
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,222
You see? She's fine. Let's go.

509
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:13,665
No, just because there was a last bus
doesn't mean she was on the last bus.

510
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,271
- You and your logic.
- I'm trying her again.

511
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,319
I'll get it.

512
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,967
- Norah.
- Caro...

513
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,505
Oh, no.

514
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,581
Oh, God.

515
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,182
Norah?

516
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,124
- Help me.
- Caroline, where are you?

517
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,457
<i>- Tell me where you are.
- Norah, my gum.</i>

518
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,657
What? Can you hear me? Caroline?

519
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,129
Norah.

520
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,535
Norah, where are you?

521
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,936
<i>- Can you hear me? Caroline?
- Norah?</i>

522
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,270
- Shit.
- Where is she?

523
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,812
I don't know.
I couldn't hear over the music.

524
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,357
Music? What music?

525
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:50,056
She's at Brooklyn Pool.
She's probably looking for you.

526
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,462
- In Brooklyn?
- Let's go.

527
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,701
To Brooklyn?

528
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,340
Fine, let's go to Brooklyn.

529
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,226
- This is awesome.
- This is ridiculous.

530
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,339
Okay, what are we supposed to do
if she's not here, you guys?

531
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,271
When she's not here,
because she's not, obviously.

532
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,173
Hello. How you doing? Hi.

533
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,871
- Everybody in. Pile on in.
- Really? Are you sure?

534
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,175
There you go.

535
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,394
- No.
- I've been here for an hour.

536
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,051
No, you can't get in.

537
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,499
Hey, were you on YouTube
or something?

538
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,698
What?

539
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,644
Who are you?

540
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,546
I'm Norah.

541
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,907
I'm no one.
I'm just the daughter of someone.

542
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,416
Daughter of who?

543
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,716
My dad. I'm gonna
go find Caroline, okay?

544
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,480
Yeah, good luck.

545
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:56,984
That's my song.

546
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,424
Really? It's my song kind of.
Really? That's cool.

547
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,063
You dance?

548
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,359
Can we dance like this?

549
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,668
When they wrote this song, they were
hoping people would dance like this.

550
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,274
Go like this.
You're not supposed to actually...

551
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,537
Try and get as close to my hands
as you can without touching them.

552
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:20,478
- This is a very good dance, Nick.
- This is the pedal boat.

553
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,129
You know the blow-dryer?

554
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,129
- Okay.
- Doesn't work on mine.

555
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,496
Oh, no, it doesn't. Wow, you're soft.

556
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,969
I asked for the Ellen DeGeneres
haircut.

557
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,502
Oh, my God.

558
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:48,804
Hey. Oh, hey.

559
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,806
Dance-wich.

560
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,480
- He's pushing me. I'm not doing it.
- It's okay.

561
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:55,913
- It's not me.
- It's all him.

562
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,089
He's making me do it.
I'm not doing it.

563
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,884
It's not your fault. It's all right.
Oh, man. Oh, my God.

564
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,184
Hi there.

565
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,193
Oh, hi.

566
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,355
Hey, baby.

567
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,763
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

568
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,063
Looking for Fluffy.
What are you doing here?

569
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,637
We're looking for Caroline.

570
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:20,868
Oh, Caroline. What, can't you just
follow the umbilical cord?

571
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,074
- What's up?
- Hi.

572
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,512
Nick, this is Tal. Tal, this is Nick,
Tris' latest victim.

573
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,186
Oh, serious?

574
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,684
Well... Oh, but you're in that
gay band...

575
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,818
...We're Gay.

576
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,087
The Jerk Offs.
And we're not all gay.

577
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:42,094
Yeah. You were pretty decent.

578
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:46,531
Except for being one arm short
of a Def Leppard cover group.

579
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,335
All right, yeah, take care, fellas.

580
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,733
You guys were pretty good except...

581
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:57,277
...you were two penises short of
a Shania Twain re-imagination band.

582
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:58,470
You're done.

583
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:03,346
Prettiest shoulders, prettiest hair,
prettiest ears.

584
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,388
- Thanks.
- Gorgeous ears.

585
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,391
Here we go.

586
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,993
<i>Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!</i>

587
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,721
<i>Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!</i>

588
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:28,741
Yes.

589
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,277
Fluffy!

590
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:37,247
Okay. The hype man
knows what you want...

591
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,581
...but he's not sure
if you want it enough.

592
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,421
Do you really want it?

593
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,260
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?

594
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,158
I said, do you really want it?

595
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,862
I got one question.

596
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,391
Are...

597
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,462
...You...

598
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,101
...Randy?

599
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:58,997
You suck.

600
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,841
- Damn it.
- The bait and switch.

601
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,276
- Randy, you suck.
- Go ahead.

602
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:17,017
So, listen, baby,
what are you doing tonight?

603
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:21,459
Aside from you being beautiful. I got
something I really want you to hear.

604
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,826
Look here. I need to talk to you
right now.

605
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,594
I got some important stuff
I need to talk to you about.

606
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,863
Okay, well, I'm gonna...

607
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,302
You have fun, okay?

608
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,304
I'm just gonna go find Caroline, okay?

609
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,541
You're just gonna call me
in 45 minutes anyways.

610
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:40,873
With a gay band.

611
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,007
- Hi.
- Hey.

612
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,050
Thanks.

613
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,023
Come on.

614
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,428
I thought we were gonna...

615
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:34,036
No, we're not, we're gonna...
Just get in the cab, Gary, come on.

616
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,230
Follow that van.

617
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,327
- So is that guy your boyfriend?
- Sort of.

618
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,431
He's sort of your boyfriend,
or he's your sort-of boyfriend?

619
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,261
He's sort of my ex-boyfriend,
most of the time.

620
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,165
- What is he the rest of the time?
- We're friends.

621
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,432
- With benefits?
- Yeah, it's just the never-ending story.

622
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,839
- That's like me and Tris.
- No, that ended, remember?

623
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:16,935
I mean...

624
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,446
Excuse me, you have a boyfriend
or an ex-boyfriend with benefits...

625
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,279
...but you still go around
kissing total strangers?

626
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,955
Trust me, that was an act
of desperation.

627
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,056
Oh, yeah, okay.
Seemed pretty desperate.

628
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,749
Oh, okay. Well, Nick,
you're not a total stranger, huh?

629
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:33,930
In fact, I am rife
with too much information.

630
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,088
What does that mean?

631
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,894
Okay, hi. I hate to break up
the love-fest back there...

632
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,833
...but does anyone wanna tell us
where we're going?

633
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,306
- I can narrow this down.
- Well, let's hear it, sister.

634
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,103
You know how some people like to eat
in the same places?

635
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:49,609
Yes.

636
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:52,441
Okay, Caroline likes to barf
in the same places.

637
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,952
Hey, we're gonna get a hot dog
around the corner.

638
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:18,100
- Oh, no. No more. No more.
- Have you seen her?

639
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,799
Your girlfriend puked
in the ice cream again.

640
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,343
Last time it took me one hour
to chip out.

641
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,179
Hey. Hey.

642
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,178
Thought you got a ride home.

643
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,686
- What, do you like him or something?
- Do you?

644
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,916
Well, I was with the guy
for six months, so...

645
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,186
And you cheated on him
for six months, so...

646
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:43,059
- You didn't tell him that, did you?
- No, I didn't tell him that.

647
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,689
Good.

648
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,928
- I just feel like she's messing with me.
- Who are we talking about?

649
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:53,572
Right now, Norah. No, Tris. Tris.

650
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:56,610
- You just haven't figured it out yet.
- What?

651
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,877
It. You know, it, the big picture.

652
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,382
I guess not.

653
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,780
The Beatles.

654
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,582
- What about them?
- This.

655
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,058
Look, other bands,
they wanna make it about sex or pain.

656
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,823
But, you know, the Beatles,
they had it all figured out.

657
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:20,026
"I Wanna Hold Your Hand. " That's the
first single. It's F-ing brilliant, right?

658
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:26,204
The guy actually cried. I mean, I made
guys cry before, but I really broke him.

659
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,207
And I'm saying this
for the both of you.

660
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,243
I mean, I don't wanna
see you get hurt...

661
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:33,416
...but I don't wanna see him get
any more hurt, either, you know?

662
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,107
What do you mean?

663
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,913
Word on the street is
you never had an orgasm.

664
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,551
Because that's what
everybody wants, Nicky.

665
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:44,727
They don't want a 24-hour
hump sesh.

666
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:48,659
They don't wanna be married to you
for a hundred years.

667
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:52,267
They just wanna hold your hand.

668
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,875
I'm gonna stop doing that.

669
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:04,336
Tris? So who was on the street when
you heard this "word on the street"?

670
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,776
Was Caroline on the street?

671
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,975
It's okay. I mean, some people
just can't have one.

672
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,188
I can have one. Okay?

673
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,950
I've probably had, like,
a million in my life, so...

674
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,524
Oh, sure, yeah.

675
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,923
How am I supposed to know,
you know?

676
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,098
Oh, you'd know.

677
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:28,328
Look, I'm just afraid that if he gets
with you and nothing happens...

678
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,996
...his self-esteem could really
go through the crapper, you know?

679
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,611
- This is Tris.
- Oh, hey, bitch. It's Caroline.

680
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,784
- What? Give me the phone.
- Wait, what do you mean, kidnapped?

681
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,510
- Why didn't she call me?
- You're totally grounded.

682
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,019
- Give it to me.
- Hold on.

683
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:50,158
Where are you? We've been looking
for you everywhere.

684
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,852
<i>- Norah? I found Jesus.
- What?</i>

685
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:57,329
Jesus! He's much taller in person.

686
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,162
<i>I'm at a church, I think.</i>

687
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:05,672
<i>- It's so churchy and beautiful.
- It's a church. Okay, which church?</i>

688
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:09,505
- Norah, I have to follow Jesus now.
- No, Caroline...

689
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,544
There's an altar boy
with no pants on.

690
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,909
Why do you have no pants on,
altar boy?

691
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,180
Great. I have to find Jesus now.

692
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,990
- Nor?
- Yeah?

693
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,025
- My phone.
- Here.

694
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:43,504
- Hey.
- Hey.

695
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:45,544
You all right?

696
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,439
Is she okay?

697
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:49,374
Yeah.

698
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,550
I got a clue, guys.

699
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:56,187
- Are we done?
- One last stop.

700
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,387
A Yugo. We're looking for a Yugo.

701
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,159
- She said a church.
- All right, let me check it out.

702
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,079
What's wrong?

703
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,721
Tris is what's wrong.

704
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:33,157
Tris? Please. That girl's got nothing
on you. I mean, for one, she's awful.

705
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,352
Awful.

706
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:36,998
- Yeah. And for two, you're amazing.
- Amazing.

707
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:44,904
Yeah, well.

708
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,879
- Hey.
- Sorry, sorry.

709
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,176
- I'm sleeping here.
- You trying to take my BLT?

710
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,410
- It's cool, Switzerland. I got this.
- Hey.

711
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:00,647
- What's up, friend? How you doing?
- Good. I was just gonna go in...

712
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:02,882
- You walked right in here.
- I didn't mean to.

713
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,186
You're like a little canary
in skinny jeans.

714
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,329
I was gonna go in
to look for my friend.

715
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:10,796
You got friends right here. Me and
Switzerland are here for you, baby.

716
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,868
Let me ask you a question.
You ever hook up with a dog?

717
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,336
No. What? Like an an...
A dog, like a pet? No.

718
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:21,170
Don't. It's not worth it.
I like you so much.

719
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:25,678
- I'm running away. I'm running.
- Run away. Run away, little canary.

720
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,314
Okay. Okay.
What exactly did she say to you?

721
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,146
Something about an altar boy
with no pants.

722
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,152
I don't know
what she was talking about.

723
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:37,190
Midnight Ass. The all-male
"holigay" revue at Camera Obscura.

724
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:40,625
"Deck the Balls," "O Horny Night. "
You guys never went to that?

725
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,560
A Christmas show
at this time of year?

726
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,394
Since when does a queen
need an excuse to sing?

727
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:53,331
Go, girl.

728
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,273
- Did you find her?
- No.

729
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,184
Merry Christmas.

730
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:41,588
Norah. Happy Hanukkah, Norah!

731
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,554
I made it to Broadway.

732
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,853
- I'll get her.
- Thanks.

733
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,593
This tree is drunk.

734
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:53,132
Norah, it's Yugo.
He came to rescue me.

735
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:02,372
It's right here, right here.
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Right here.

736
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:12,546
I'll text you. Okay?

737
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,325
Want us to take you
back to the Yugo, Nicky?

738
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,515
Yeah, sure.

739
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:25,496
- The bass is really good.
- Thank you.

740
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,733
- You okay?
- No.

741
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:37,503
- You guys must be really good friends.
- Yes, I am a great friend.

742
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:42,310
It's always been like this. I'm the head
squire in Caroline's quest for attention.

743
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,418
That's gross.

744
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:50,556
You wanna...
I got one of these things.

745
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,656
You have a Handi Wipe?

746
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,360
Kind of handy.

747
00:53:58,435 --> 00:53:59,868
What a gentleman.

748
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,298
Yeah, I...

749
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:05,600
We had Chinese food, like,
three weeks ago, and I haven't used it.

750
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:10,110
I never wash my pants.
I like to keep the night on them.

751
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:20,452
I've been thinking more
about Brown.

752
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:21,988
Yeah.

753
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:25,355
I think it'd be nice
to know someone an hour away.

754
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:27,619
Yeah.

755
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,564
I really wouldn't mind getting away
from my minion duties.

756
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:45,978
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

757
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,797
Maybe I should just go
deal with it right now.

758
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,901
- Well, how will you get home?
- Nicky.

759
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:15,373
We'll get home fine.
You guys can still drop us off, right?

760
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,240
Yeah.

761
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,384
Nick.

762
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,925
Nice meeting you.

763
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,252
- Hi.
- Hi.

764
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,930
- What are you doing here?
- You know what I'm doing here.

765
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,621
No, I really don't.

766
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:14,929
Well, it wasn't hard to find
the only Yugo in the city.

767
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,368
I think it's the only Yugo
in the country.

768
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:21,000
Aren't you gonna
open the door for me?

769
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:25,170
- Well, where are we going?
- You're giving me a ride home.

770
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:28,382
Why don't you get a ride
from that new guy?

771
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:31,082
Well, he doesn't have a Yugo.

772
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:38,693
It's just a ride. It's late. Please?

773
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:42,286
Okay.

774
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,273
- Here.
- But I don't want your gum.

775
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:57,571
Just take it. God.

776
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,982
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Tal.</i>

777
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,320
<i>Norah.</i>

778
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,226
Where are you?

779
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:26,034
You should go. I'll be fine.
Don't worry about me. Go.

780
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,708
Okay.

781
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:33,808
Bye.

782
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,951
Have fun. I love you.

783
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,983
I miss you already.

784
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:44,850
You guys got directions?
You know where you're going?

785
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,359
- Yeah, we got them.
- Okay. No stopping.

786
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,429
No stopping for anything.

787
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,863
I don't care if Brad Pitt is selling fruit
in a thong on the GW.

788
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:56,937
- You cannot stop, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, we know. We know.

789
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:02,535
Well, good night,
my hetero heroine.

790
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:05,737
Good night, Dev. Good night, Thom.

791
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,545
It was a really fun night.

792
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,547
God, I don't know
what your name is.

793
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:14,913
It's Lethario.

794
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:19,123
Nice.

795
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,143
- There you are, yay.
- Hi.

796
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,746
- You made it.
- Yes.

797
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,917
You graced us with your presence.

798
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,546
You're the coolest girl ever.

799
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,578
- You wanna come have a seat?
- Yes.

800
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:49,053
- Okay, come. Step.
- Hi.

801
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,248
- Hey there.
- Hey.

802
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,788
So did you ever find Winehouse?

803
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,160
- Yes. And you don't wanna know.
- Yeah?

804
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,699
Don't even ask.

805
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,770
You're gonna be an amazing mother
one day.

806
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:05,934
Thanks. I guess so.

807
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,707
What is this jacket?

808
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,213
Who is Salvatore?

809
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:13,905
I got something to be worried
about here?

810
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,979
- It's just a jacket.
- Yeah?

811
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:17,516
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

812
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,932
I feel so safe here.

813
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,237
Like when I was a kid driving home
with my parents...

814
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,534
...from some trip somewhere...

815
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:45,373
...and I couldn't help
but fall asleep because that car...

816
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,812
...like I was already home.

817
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:52,548
And that's how you feel, Nicky.
Like I'm already home.

818
00:59:56,659 --> 01:00:00,789
Look, your car misses me.
It's falling apart without me.

819
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:03,965
But you just did that.

820
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,395
Oh, come on.

821
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,333
Are you really over me?

822
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:14,099
You wouldn't have to get over me
if you were still under me.

823
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:15,833
Yeah.

824
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:18,002
Wait, wait, wait.

825
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,578
What?

826
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,807
Just, you know, I'm driving.
And try not...

827
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,919
Let's go down by the river. Right here.

828
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,157
- I'm very glad you came to see me.
- Me too.

829
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:39,426
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

830
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,164
You know, I brought a present
for you.

831
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:47,036
What? You didn't have to get me
any present.

832
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,609
<i>So the history of the name,
Oz- rael...</i>

833
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:58,082
...it's like anarchy meets Zionism,
you know. It's ironic.

834
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:02,781
Oh, man. You think Israel's ready
for all this Jew fire?

835
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,051
Are you kidding me?
We bring the Jew fire.

836
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,419
So...

837
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,029
...do you like it?

838
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:13,190
Yeah?

839
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,428
Serious? Oh, that means so much.

840
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,833
That means so much.
Thank you so much. Really?

841
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,532
Really? Oh, thank you.

842
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:24,372
And you think your dad will like it?

843
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,381
- Whenever you're ready.
- Hey, what?

844
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,920
- No. Did they just charge us?
- What?

845
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,424
Did they just charge us?
What the hell?

846
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,255
Could you please talk to someone
about this, please?

847
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:47,935
- About that? Sure.
- Yeah? Really?

848
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,900
Yeah. Sit tight.

849
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:54,800
Thank you.
You're the coolest girl ever.

850
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,843
Excuse me.

851
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:01,577
I think you meant two zeros,
not one.

852
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,208
Thank you.

853
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:25,102
I've been kind of getting some
mixed signals from you lately.

854
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:26,866
Yeah?

855
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,039
Sort of.

856
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,551
Clears that up.

857
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,658
That's my song.

858
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,320
Yeah.

859
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:18,679
Hey.

860
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:21,350
Hey, Nick.

861
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,325
Are you kidding me?

862
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:33,561
Gary?

863
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:09,994
Assorted meat plate?

864
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:12,470
Great. Just keep it coming.
Thank you.

865
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:25,784
Nicholas' phone.

866
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:27,819
<i>Hi, is Nick there?</i>

867
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:31,221
No, he's not. Would you like
to call back for his voice mail?

868
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,395
<i>Can I just leave a message?</i>

869
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,262
Yeah, but if I need a pen,
you're shit out of luck.

870
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,258
Could you tell him...

871
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:41,231
...that he really blew it tonight
when he got out of the van?

872
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:49,506
<i>And that he knows Norah probably
never wants to see him again...</i>

873
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:52,476
<i>...and he'd like to apologize to her
in person.</i>

874
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,406
Really?

875
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:59,383
Yeah, where are you?
Did you leave the city?

876
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:02,989
<i>- I'm at Veselka.
- What are the cross streets?</i>

877
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,448
Second and Ninth.

878
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,686
<i>Okay, well, don't leave.
I'm gonna come over, okay?</i>

879
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,263
In the meantime,
could you pass that message on?

880
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,064
Hey.

881
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:57,910
I have a confession to make.

882
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,739
Oh, you do?

883
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:01,375
I like your jacket.

884
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:05,815
- Oh, thanks. Well, it's not mine.
- It should be.

885
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,149
It belongs to Salvatore.

886
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:11,121
Well, he told me
that he wants you to keep it.

887
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:12,316
He does?

888
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,962
- Yeah, he thinks it looks better on you.
- That's nice.

889
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,257
But don't tell his wife,
because she gets crazy.

890
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:19,593
- And jealous.
- She's hostile?

891
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:23,397
- Is this your gum here?
- Don't touch it. I'm not done.

892
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,267
It must maintain its freshness.

893
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,774
So I also have a confession.

894
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:38,148
- Before Tal, I never really...
- What?

895
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:44,958
- Kissed anyone else till tonight.
- Really?

896
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:46,753
Yeah.

897
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:49,954
Unless you count Becca Weiner
at camp when I was 13.

898
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,930
- I do count Becca Weiner.
- You do?

899
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:56,901
I don't know who wouldn't. You'd
have to be a fool not to count her.

900
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:01,035
- How long were you guys together?
- Three campfire-y nights.

901
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:07,810
Oh, me and Tal? I knew that.
Three years total.

902
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:09,848
Friends with benefits?

903
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:11,784
I guess.

904
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:14,947
Well, what are the benefits?

905
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:17,990
Yeah, that's crossed my mind.
I don't know.

906
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:22,260
I don't know.
He's just always been there...

907
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:25,364
...and you just feel ignored
for long enough...

908
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:28,469
...and it's just nice
to feel special sometimes.

909
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:32,531
What is it that keeps two people
together for such a long time...

910
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:34,834
...when it's just not working?

911
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:37,137
I can call my parents and ask them.

912
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:43,943
- Do you wanna go somewhere?
- Yeah.

913
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,015
Where do you wanna go?

914
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:49,714
Anywhere. I mean,
it's only 4 in the morning.

915
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:51,722
Where do you wanna go?

916
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:55,687
Somewhere nobody we know
will find us.

917
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,559
Yeah.

918
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,695
I'll drive.

919
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:10,136
Aren't you impressed
that I drive stick like a pro?

920
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,251
This is amazing. You are literally
like my musical soul mate.

921
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:19,683
It's unbelievable.
Except for all the Cure.

922
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:21,186
What's wrong with the Cure?

923
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:24,359
There's nothing wrong with the Cure,
actually, but just the name.

924
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,961
You know, the Cure?
What are they the Curing?

925
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:31,133
Get it? They should be called
the Cause, right?

926
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,766
Maybe I'll take this for a bit
and you can focus on driving.

927
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,531
What, you don't like
my sweet grooves?

928
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,436
I need something
to distract myself...

929
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:43,612
...from the fact that you're driving
my car pretty recklessly.

930
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:45,336
I am a great driver.

931
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:47,571
Fine.

932
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:55,618
Oh, this is a really fancy
parking job.

933
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:59,191
It's good because if another car wants
to park between us and the curb...

934
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:00,657
...he can get right in here.

935
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:04,663
Fine. I'll get closer to the curb,
just for you. Just for you, Nick.

936
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,164
Just because you're picky like that.

937
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,096
Shit.

938
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:19,280
You're close enough to the curb now.
We're right on it.

939
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,444
Sorry I broke your car.

940
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:24,483
Yeah, don't worry.
We'll call a tow truck or some...

941
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:26,249
And...

942
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:28,423
Welcome to...

943
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,990
Electric Lady Studios.
Built by Jimi Hendrix in 1970.

944
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,758
What? Do you have any idea
who recorded here?

945
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:39,059
Led Zeppelin? ACIDC?
The Rolling Stones?

946
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:41,132
David Bowie?

947
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,464
Your dad owns this place?

948
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:47,598
Is he this man?

949
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,034
Yeah.

950
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:00,181
So, what is he, like a former hippie,
current yuppie...

951
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:03,119
...spoon-feeding the masses
the same old garbage?

952
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:04,986
Stop me at any time.

953
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,416
Yes.

954
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:08,096
- Yeah.
- Yes.

955
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:12,027
I'm gonna use that in my graduation
speech. That's, like, amazing.

956
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:14,327
- Cool. Good.
- Here, come on.

957
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:19,834
<i>They were supposed to show up
at Brooklyn Pool tonight...</i>

958
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:22,203
<i>...but it looks like Where's Fluffy
is gonna...</i>

959
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:26,006
<i>- Hold on. Listen.
- I don't think they deserve it.</i>

960
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:27,739
<i>- I should tell them?
- Yes.</i>

961
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,783
<i>- I shouldn't tell them?
- Yes, of course you should. Come on.</i>

962
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:35,013
<i>All right. We'll give you a hint.
Are you ready?</i>

963
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:41,595
<i>Five, 68, 100 and 21.</i>

964
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:42,991
Oh, come on.

965
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,928
- The numbers. They mean something.
- It's a clue.

966
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,002
- What did he say?
- So stupid.

967
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,167
- Sixty-nine.
- No, 68. Get out of the gutter.

968
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,001
The alphabet. The A...

969
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:57,110
- There aren't 68 letters in the alphabet.
- I hate you sometimes.

970
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,440
- Well, think, damn it.
- Five from 68, that's...

971
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,240
Retarded.
Gotta be something else.

972
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:04,419
Song titles. Do we know
songs with numbers in the title?

973
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,951
It's a address.

974
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:11,022
Fifth Avenue, 68th Street,
New York, New York...

975
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:15,856
...10021.

976
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,101
- It's an address. It's an address.
- Turn!

977
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:21,769
- No, I can't. Wait.
- Just do it!

978
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,130
Oh, my God!

979
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:01,465
I'm gonna throw up.

980
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:04,769
Well, don't throw up
on the Strat. Please.

981
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,505
Yeah, I'll try not to.
Can I pick this up?

982
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,206
Yeah.

983
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:12,119
My God.

984
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,286
It's left-handed.

985
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:19,526
It's like playing for the first time.

986
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:24,392
Is this the job that you have
lined up?

987
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,728
- It's mine if I want it, yeah.
- Well, how could you not want this?

988
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:31,372
I don't know. I love music,
you know what I mean?

989
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:34,072
But I feel like if I work in it
in here...

990
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:36,335
...I might not love it
the same way anymore.

991
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:42,611
I loved your mixes, by the way.

992
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:44,474
You heard those?

993
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:50,053
I heard one. Or seven.
Yeah, I have seven of them.

994
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:54,996
I knew you liked Where's Fluffy
before I asked.

995
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:57,487
That's kind of creepy.

996
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:05,203
- What was your favorite song?
- Let's see. My favorite verse was:

997
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:09,366
"The way you're moving in your sleep,
the way you look before you leap...

998
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:13,742
...the strange illusions that you keep,
you don't know, but I'm noticing. "

999
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,413
- I wrote that.
- You wrote that?

1000
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,484
I love that.

1001
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:21,713
It wasn't about her.
It wasn't about anybody.

1002
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:23,687
It was just, you know...

1003
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,027
Would you play it?

1004
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:29,322
- Right now?
- Yeah, dude. Look where we are.

1005
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:32,091
- You wanna lay it down?
- Yes.

1006
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,132
- Really?
- Get in there.

1007
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:36,770
- Really?
- Go. Go for it.

1008
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,584
- Can you hear me?
- Check.

1009
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:02,723
Yeah. All right.

1010
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:08,028
<i>I never should've let you drive my car
Because now it's ruined forever</i>

1011
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,865
<i>It was the biggest mistake of my life
To let you drive it</i>

1012
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:12,904
I'm sorry.

1013
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:14,700
That's okay. I'm used to it.

1014
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:17,606
She falls apart
and I put her back together again.

1015
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,075
Just like me and Caroline.

1016
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:23,948
It reminds me of this part of Judaism
that I really like.

1017
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:26,518
<i>It's called Tikkun olam.</i>

1018
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:29,816
It says that the world's been broken
into pieces...

1019
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:34,519
...and it's everybody's job to find them
and put them back together again.

1020
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:39,067
Well, maybe we're the pieces,
you know?

1021
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:42,203
Maybe we're not supposed
to find the pieces.

1022
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,269
Maybe we are the pieces.

1023
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:49,770
Nick?

1024
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:51,434
Yeah?

1025
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,106
I'm coming in.

1026
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:18,996
Hi.

1027
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:32,580
I'm not gonna compete
with her, okay?

1028
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:34,078
With who?

1029
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:38,242
I think Dev has the same bra.

1030
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:43,718
I just...

1031
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:47,584
I just, I know I'm not, like,
pretty like that.

1032
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,664
Norah, you're beautiful.

1033
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:01,101
Why is this button so difficult?

1034
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,571
Sorry, Nicky.

1035
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,837
- Why would you buy these pants?
- I don't know.

1036
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:07,174
I just, I don't know.
I can't remember.

1037
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:10,482
- Cold. Cold hands.
- Sorry.

1038
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,916
Why are your hands so cold?

1039
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:53,324
You okay?

1040
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:56,395
Yeah, it's just a little embarrassing.

1041
01:18:57,766 --> 01:19:00,735
Don't be embarrassed.
You're beautiful.

1042
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:10,143
It's my phone. Sorry.

1043
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:15,640
Nick?

1044
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:16,977
What?

1045
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:19,515
How do you feel about Where's Fluffy?

1046
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,923
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1047
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:26,720
- Okay. Oh, hurry up.
- We have to hurry. Hurry, hurry.

1048
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,692
I am, I am, I am. Oh, my God.

1049
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:32,190
Oh, shoes.

1050
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,368
Okay, hang on.

1051
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:38,398
Okay. I'm ready. Okay, go.

1052
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:23,849
- Norah! You're here. I'm so happy.
- What are you doing here?

1053
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,911
- How's it going?
- I'm never drinking again. I promise.

1054
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:28,680
- Hey, Norah.
- Okay.

1055
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:31,119
What are you doing?

1056
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:33,755
You asshole.

1057
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,793
Wait, you show up here
with this gaylord?

1058
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,899
You trying to make a fool of me
in front of my boys?

1059
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:43,400
<i>Do you realize that I had to walk back
to 10th by myself?</i>

1060
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:45,835
- You weren't exactly by yourself.
- Shut up, Gary.

1061
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:49,135
- So you're telling me this is over?
- You're seriously over me?

1062
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:52,713
Come on, no.

1063
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:54,176
Come here a second.

1064
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,212
Come on.

1065
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:59,113
You're still gonna give your dad
our CD, right? Aren't you?

1066
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:03,121
Come on, you know how hard we
worked on that. You promised me...

1067
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,950
Wait. It's all good. It's all good.

1068
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:11,231
This doesn't concern you, Sal.

1069
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:14,928
Well, anyway, so...

1070
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:17,570
- It's Salvatore.
- Oh, yeah?

1071
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:20,407
What, you blew it
with your own chick...

1072
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:23,373
...so you gotta run around
playing beard with someone else's?

1073
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:24,943
- Lf you push me again...
- What?

1074
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:28,411
- Your merry men will bone me?
- That's it.

1075
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:36,086
Leave her. She'll go running to Daddy.

1076
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:39,727
Come on, come with me.
Just come with me.

1077
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:43,791
- Come on.
- Come on, come with me.

1078
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:46,267
Let's go watch the show.

1079
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:19,292
<i>Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!</i>

1080
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:49,829
That's three years I've wasted
on Ira Silverberg's daughter...

1081
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:51,658
...and what does it get me?

1082
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:54,391
Norah, who's gonna take me home?

1083
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:56,832
Yeah, well, I hate your stupid band.

1084
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:58,972
Oh, and P.S., I cheated on you.

1085
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:01,472
- Go away.
- Shut up.

1086
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:03,232
Let's go.

1087
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:08,144
<i>Don't leave yet, because we've got
one question for you: Are you ready...</i>

1088
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:12,116
<i>...for Where's Fluffy?</i>

1089
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,551
I love you, New York.

1090
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:28,892
Hey, what's wrong?

1091
01:23:29,637 --> 01:23:31,070
Are you sad we missed it?

1092
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:34,598
We didn't miss it. This is it.

1093
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,445
Come on. Don't you wanna go home?
