1
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:47,506
Slow down, slow down.
Move it back up.

2
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,707
- Here we go.
- They're drivin' me crazy!

3
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,775
- Don't go too fast.
- Come on!

4
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:56,151
- What's the matter?
- You threw the cage on my foot!

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,884
- I didn't do that.
- Yes, you did.

6
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,825
I need puppies.

7
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,991
- Okay. All right. Come on.
- Puppies.

8
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,347
Hi there.
Isn't that the sweetest?

9
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:19,428
- He's cool. Yeah.
- He likes us.

10
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,479
What a cute guy.
Isn't he cute?

11
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:01,178
Hi, puppy.

12
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,739
No, absolutely not.

13
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,865
Well, how big's
he gonna be?

14
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:26,427
- St. Bernards get to be 150 pounds.
- I got a junkyard.

15
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:30,942
I need a big, mean
junkyard dog.

16
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,376
Let me see him.

17
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,973
Come here, puppy.

18
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:43,287
He looks good and mean.

19
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:46,347
I don't know. He's pretty sweet.

20
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:49,087
You can make
any dog mean.

21
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:54,524
Hey!
Damn little beast!

22
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,534
God!

23
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,872
You got any pit bulls?

24
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,562
Come on. It's a pushover.
I cased the place.

25
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,532
What about the cops?
Video surveillance?

26
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,798
You're crazy if you're gonna
just walk up like this.

27
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,395
What about the alarm?

28
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:49,616
All you gotta do
is step over.

29
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:57,162
- I got you.
- Okay, okay.

30
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:59,857
There, you see?
In and out, quiet as a mouse.

31
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,526
Get some dogs.

32
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:07,297
Come on, puppy.
We're just goin' for a little car ride.

33
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,774
Look at the wee, little ones.
Come here, little puppies.

34
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,835
Here we go.
Here we go.

35
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:18,576
Come on, puppy.
Here puppy, nice puppy.

36
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,057
I've stepped in the beam.

37
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:12,299
Here, puppy, nice puppy.

38
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:28,314
See, didn't I tell ya?

39
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:30,650
Doesn't this beat takin'
strays off the street?

40
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:33,417
- You are a genius!
- Get off!

41
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,599
Sorry! I'm sorry.

42
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:47,103
I'm just a little bit excited.
That's my very first felony.

43
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:51,437
I've committed a lot of misdemeanors,
but that was my first felony.

44
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:08,721
Why are they barking?

45
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:10,624
They're dogs.

46
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:14,095
I know they're dogs!
Go in the back and check.

47
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:19,900
Okay, doggies,
what's the racket back...

48
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,961
Hey!

49
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,803
Okay, doggies,
back in your house.

50
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,311
Back in your house.
Here, doggie, nice doggie.

51
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:33,974
No, doggie.
Don't jump.

52
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,245
Bad dog!
Good puppy!

53
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:41,758
Bad puppy, don't jump!
Good puppy, don't jump!

54
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:45,421
Come back!
Stop the van!

55
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:48,124
Harv, what is it?
Why did you want me to stop?

56
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,292
Hurry, they're gettin' away.

57
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,195
Hey, you, come back here!

58
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:57,638
Come here!
I'll give you a bone!

59
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,404
Come back here,
you little runt!

60
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,571
Come here, you!

61
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:33,495
7:00 a.m.
Up and at 'em!

62
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:50,307
Ted, I'm sorry.

63
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:55,148
Mmm. What's wrong?
Did you have another nightmare?

64
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,949
Yeah.

65
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:02,322
Mom, it's Saturday and it's 7:02.
Do we really have to get up?

66
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:04,793
Yep, you heard
your father.

67
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,424
I know, Daddy's rules.

68
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:23,141
That's it! I'm not
gonna take it anymore.

69
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:27,450
Mom, I have a news flash.
It's Saturday!

70
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:29,816
- Yeah, I know, honey.
- This sucks!

71
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,253
Why do we have to get up
so early on a Saturday?

72
00:11:32,322 --> 00:11:34,586
Ask your father.
Don't say "sucks."

73
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:37,593
The bathroom's mine!

74
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:41,495
- Nanny, nanny!
- Shut up! Let me in.

75
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,793
Open up, you little wimp!
Let me in!

76
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:48,667
- Mom! Let me in!
- You have no bladder control.

77
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:53,199
Wait 'til I get my hands on you.
Let me in!

78
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,085
A puppy!

79
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:06,250
Hi!

80
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:14,357
Guys, do you have to...

81
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:17,423
I dreamt I had a puppy,
and it came true!

82
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:25,671
Honey.

83
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:29,372
I take back everything I said
about you being cold and insensitive.

84
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:31,380
Dad...

85
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:33,439
I take back anything
I said too.

86
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:36,315
Dad, I have everything
I ever wanted.

87
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:38,320
- I owe you big time.
- Why?

88
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:41,255
Daddy, can we
call him Fred?

89
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:49,092
- Let me have him. It's my turn.
- No, it's my turn!

90
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:54,160
- I saw him first!
- I'm gonna have him for 5 more minutes.

91
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:58,231
We can't have a dog.
We can't have a dog!

92
00:12:58,308 --> 00:13:01,209
You can't show a child a puppy,
then take it away two minutes later.

93
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,076
I didn't show a child a puppy.
It's obviously lost.

94
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:07,845
- Occupy the kids. I'll run to the pound.
- No, no way!

95
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:12,116
- It'll be destroyed.
- If we keep it, the house will be!

96
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:16,250
- Millions of people have dogs.
- Not people like me.

97
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:19,261
Dogs sniff.
They lick, chew.

98
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:21,627
They drool, scratch...

99
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:25,225
- Alice, they have parasites.
- Oh, God, yeah.

100
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:28,931
The kids'll lose interest.
It'll grow to be enormous.

101
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:31,497
It'll take over the yard.

102
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:34,601
When the dog finally
settles down, it'll die.

103
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:38,842
Everybody will be upset. We'll have
to get another puppy and start all over.

104
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,384
- Do you understand?
- No. Could you be more specific?

105
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:44,682
- Alice, I need a little support.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

106
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:47,087
All right.

107
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:50,186
How shall we handle this?

108
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,058
Go tell the kids.

109
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:57,464
- Come on.
- Come over here.

110
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,771
He loves me the most.

111
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:14,450
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Dad.

112
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:17,783
- Can he sleep in my room?
- No, in my room.

113
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,814
- He's sleeping in my room.
- He's not sleeping in anyone's room.

114
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:24,486
Listen to me a minute.

115
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:29,624
We are people people here.
We are goldfish people.

116
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,568
We're ant farm people.
We're not dog people.

117
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:36,367
Dad, why can't you
just give us a chance?

118
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,102
You're always saying
we have to have responsibility.

119
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:40,438
That's true.

120
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:49,145
It's my decision.
I mean, I've decided.

121
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:50,914
I knew it!

122
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:06,734
Think of something
to name him.

123
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:09,169
When he destroys my house,
I wanna know what to call him!

124
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:11,173
- Thank you.
- This is temporary.

125
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:15,177
This is temporary
until we find the owner.

126
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,378
Okay, the dog's name
will be...

127
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:23,715
What is it?

128
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:26,813
- What's his name gonna be?
- You can't change it. That's the rules.

129
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,949
Okay. Emily?

130
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:31,620
Did you do your name
in a crayon?

131
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:35,096
Well, I don't think words
for parts of the body make good names.

132
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:38,760
But he's got one of those.
I looked.

133
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:41,861
I'm sure he does,
but I don't think Daddy...

134
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:45,204
wants to stand on the front porch
at night yelling that out.

135
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:48,210
But that's what
you call Uncle Richard.

136
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:53,443
Okay, the dog's
name will be...

137
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:00,882
You asked for my input.

138
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:06,127
- What?
- Nothing. Let's just call him Rover.

139
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:10,064
- Mom, please, M.C. Hammer.
- Ultimate Warrior.

140
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:12,658
M.C. Hammer?
No, no, Rover.

141
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:15,261
He doesn't like
any of those names.

142
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,604
- Right! Like you can read his mind!
- Ryce!

143
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:20,905
Emily, what does the dog
want his name to be?

144
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:25,438
This is ridiculous! It's a dog.
He doesn't have preferences!

145
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:29,679
- Call him Ding Dong. He wouldn't know.
- Yes, he would!

146
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:32,688
He'll tell us what
he wants to be called.

147
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:47,125
Beethoven.

148
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:04,108
Roll over.
Come on, boy. Roll over.

149
00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:36,794
You!

150
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:44,240
No, no, no!

151
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,360
If this business is gonna
grow, we need more money.

152
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:13,064
They're talking about twenty-five.
That's not gonna do me any good.

153
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:15,107
They said, "No?"
I said, "No."

154
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:19,474
If this is gonna take off,
I need some capital, not a Band-Aid.

155
00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:22,013
"What kind of figures
are we talking about?"

156
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:25,346
I said, "A hundred and fifty sounds
like a good neighborhood to me."

157
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:29,354
- Did you really say that?
- Yeah. This is a business.

158
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:33,324
Advertising, signs, ;
but I'm optimistic.

159
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:36,088
- Ted, get down here.
- Where's my shoes?

160
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:39,256
- I don't know, honey, just backtrack.
- Mom, please?

161
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:41,266
Look behind
the bathroom door.

162
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:43,666
- Daddy?
- What?

163
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:45,863
He wants you to
scratch his head.

164
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:48,634
Uh, you know...

165
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,871
I don't wanna scratch his head.
Back off, back off!

166
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:53,673
But he wants you to.

167
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:57,273
Sometimes we don't get what we want.
That's not the way the world works.

168
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,284
If I don't get this deal,
I'll kill myself!

169
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:02,082
Honey, don't talk like that
in front of the kids.

170
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:06,557
If I can just get them to smell
the stuff. Air fresheners are visceral...

171
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:09,094
- Dad, I got a great idea.
- What?

172
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:11,561
Can I have karate lessons?

173
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:15,362
I didn't get any bacon.
What do you want karate lessons for?

174
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:19,097
Brenda's littler than me,
and she's got a green belt.

175
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:21,833
Why don't we skip the lessons
and get you the belt?

176
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:31,911
No! Come on!

177
00:21:31,984 --> 00:21:36,250
He slimed me!
He slobbed! Look at this!

178
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:38,017
Don't worry about it.

179
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,081
I've got dog drool
on my pants!

180
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,595
I can't meet with Vanguard Capital
with dog drool on my pants!

181
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:46,928
- Just change your pants.
- I'm gonna change my pants.

182
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:50,662
I had a schedule and now it's gone.
I'll never have that again!

183
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:53,830
- Just change, George.
- I'm gonna change my pants.

184
00:21:53,906 --> 00:21:55,931
If I change my pants,
I gotta change my jacket.

185
00:21:56,008 --> 00:21:57,942
If I change my jacket,
I change my shirt.

186
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,001
If I change my shirt,
I change my tie.

187
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,207
I have to change
my belt, shoes, socks.

188
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:06,342
Just change your pants, George.

189
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:38,583
I don't need you to
drool all over me, for God sakes!

190
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:42,143
You're so smart!
What am I telling you about?

191
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:45,418
Listen to me!

192
00:22:58,204 --> 00:23:00,297
Bye, honey.

193
00:23:00,373 --> 00:23:03,206
Sorry.
Good luck.

194
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:05,675
A little Kleenex
or something.

195
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,267
Hi, puppy.

196
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:40,510
Thirsty, huh?

197
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:43,548
Easy, buddy.
Save some for the fishes.

198
00:24:52,017 --> 00:24:54,315
Look at Tom.
He's wide open. Shoot it!

199
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:58,322
Put it up.
Put it up!

200
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,517
- This guy's all over me.
- Shoot it.

201
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:03,460
Yeah!

202
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:07,989
All right, that's it. Hit the showers.

203
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:12,367
Give me ten.
Let's go, hustle.

204
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:17,039
Hi, Mark.

205
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,807
- You're sweaty.
- You like it?

206
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:32,690
Air fresheners are the fastest-growing
area in household hygiene.

207
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:34,692
Fascinating!

208
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,459
All of these use a two-dip process
that guarantees a longer smell life.

209
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:42,968
Smell this.
That smell nice?

210
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,470
If we get the right amount of capital,
we can take this place to the top.

211
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:52,534
I don't just mean successful,
I mean, dominant.

212
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:55,671
Here's a favorite.
Look at this.

213
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:58,615
- New leather.
- Oh, that's cute.

214
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:01,847
- I could use that in my Beemer.
- I could use it in my Beemer!

215
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:03,718
A lot of people
could use 'em.

216
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:07,987
I wouldn't want to hang it from
my rearview mirror... Tacky!

217
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,426
No, there's velcro
on the back.

218
00:26:10,496 --> 00:26:14,159
People hide them.
A lot put it under their dashboard.

219
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:17,464
Ingenious!
Bravo, Newton. Kudos.

220
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:19,436
Thank you.

221
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,679
- Let's get Ted.
- Hey!

222
00:26:34,753 --> 00:26:39,213
Hey, Teddy boy.
That's a nice lunch you got there.

223
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:43,352
- A veritable nutrition lesson.
- Oh, yeah.

224
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:47,957
Don't forget to wash it down
with a big glass of milk.

225
00:26:49,702 --> 00:26:51,499
Oh, man!

226
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,095
See ya on the bus.

227
00:27:14,193 --> 00:27:17,253
Hi! Miss Simpkins
made me stay after.

228
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:22,992
Want a Twinkie?

229
00:27:23,068 --> 00:27:25,059
Hold on a minute.

230
00:27:32,244 --> 00:27:34,974
Good boy.

231
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:42,848
See over there?

232
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:44,855
That's Donna Ditsworth.

233
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:48,859
She's the most popular girl
in the whole school.

234
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:53,227
Her hair is perfect.
Her teeth are perfect.

235
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:56,233
Even Mark thinks she's perfect.

236
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:04,598
Beethoven!

237
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:17,548
Hey, check out Fido.

238
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:24,787
- What a cool-lookin'dog.
- I bet you wanna play fetch.

239
00:28:24,863 --> 00:28:28,230
You gotta give me the stick,
if you want me to throw it.

240
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,894
Hey, where we going?

241
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,777
- Cool dog.
- Cool dog.

242
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:43,076
Is he yours?

243
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:46,481
- What's his name?
- Beethoven.

244
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:49,077
- Wow. Hi, Beethoven.
- Hey, Beethoven.

245
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:51,520
Cool dog. Good boy.

246
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,050
Well, see you later, Ryce.

247
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:02,827
Yes! He knows my name!

248
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:07,270
He knows my name.

249
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:10,831
No question about it. You've built
yourself something impressive.

250
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:13,901
Thank you very much.

251
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:15,947
- That mean you're interested?
- Absolutely.

252
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:18,482
We've smelled
a lot of stuff.

253
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,951
I speak for myself as well as
the "Brie Meister" when I say...

254
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,215
yours smells the best.

255
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:26,985
That's great.
Thanks a lot.

256
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,118
We're gonna crunch
some numbers.

257
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:31,754
- Maybe we can get together later.
- That would be great.

258
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,355
- We're looking forward to it.
- I'll get it.

259
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:36,424
- Thank you.
- Ciao.

260
00:29:36,502 --> 00:29:39,903
- Ciao, George.
- Ciao bello.

261
00:29:39,972 --> 00:29:42,736
- Ciao bello.
- Ciao!

262
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:45,276
Ciao.

263
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,142
Ciao.

264
00:30:26,218 --> 00:30:28,379
How ya doin', Theodore?

265
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:31,445
- Nice backpack, Teddy!
- Can I see it?

266
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:35,459
Oh... woops!
Sorry!

267
00:30:35,527 --> 00:30:38,189
Why do you guys
always pick on me?

268
00:30:38,263 --> 00:30:40,697
'Cause you're a
little four-eyed dork.

269
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:42,791
Give them back!

270
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,530
They're mine.
Give them back!

271
00:30:45,604 --> 00:30:48,664
Where you going, Teddy?

272
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,212
Wait up, Theodore.
We wanna walk you home.

273
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:19,531
What are you?
A chicken?

274
00:31:19,605 --> 00:31:21,197
- Come on.
- Scaredy-cat!

275
00:31:27,946 --> 00:31:30,278
Scared?
Come on, fight me.

276
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,977
- Now he can't even see.
- Blind as a bat!

277
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:36,248
What's going on here?

278
00:31:36,321 --> 00:31:38,551
He looks mean!

279
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:40,387
Yeah.

280
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:44,293
- Give him the glasses.
- Sorry.

281
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:54,337
And don't come back!

282
00:32:14,426 --> 00:32:18,328
I know it doesn't mean
that he likes me.

283
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:24,063
But he's gotta like me
better than before he said my name.

284
00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:26,604
You think he could
like me, Beethoven?

285
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:33,640
I know you like me.

286
00:32:33,712 --> 00:32:36,738
Good night, sweetheart.

287
00:32:36,815 --> 00:32:38,715
You, out!

288
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:40,945
Good night, Beethoven.

289
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:45,752
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Dad.

290
00:32:52,864 --> 00:32:54,966
Mark.

291
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:59,232
All right!
You, in here!

292
00:32:59,303 --> 00:33:02,704
You sleep in here.
I sleep there. You...

293
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:07,607
See, that's very nice.

294
00:33:07,678 --> 00:33:12,115
That's progress. I appreciate that.
Good night.

295
00:33:14,852 --> 00:33:17,480
Good night.

296
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:26,859
Ever since you started
looking for investors you seem...

297
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:30,924
- You wanted us to expand.
- I want you to be happy.

298
00:33:31,002 --> 00:33:34,233
You even said you'd
come back to work.

299
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:37,399
I said I'd give you
one wish for your birthday.

300
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:41,241
Well, I wish you'd
come back to work.

301
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:43,872
There's other things
that are important.

302
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:46,178
I like being home
when the kids get home.

303
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,309
I don't want them to
come home to some stranger.

304
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:52,755
We'll get a great sitter, somebody
reliable that the kids'll just love.

305
00:34:24,922 --> 00:34:28,483
In the 3rd occurrence this month.

306
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,859
We've seen a 500% increase in
the reported incidence of stolen pets.

307
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,990
Police believe an animal
kidnapping ring is at work.

308
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:38,058
That's "News Break."
Back to "The Wolfman."

309
00:34:38,135 --> 00:34:41,002
- Did you hear something?
- No.

310
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:43,063
I heard something downstairs.

311
00:35:51,675 --> 00:35:54,906
You were right.
The TVwas on.

312
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,908
I don't know.
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

313
00:35:58,983 --> 00:36:02,043
It feels like a good idea
to expand...

314
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:05,145
but I don't want to do it
at everybody's expense.

315
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:08,521
We have to get somebody wonderful
to take care of the kids.

316
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:10,992
There's no question
about that.

317
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:13,586
It's hard to know
what the right thing is.

318
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:19,193
No matter how many
showers I take...

319
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:23,707
I still smell Beethoven
all over me.

320
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:27,301
Are you okay?
You're so quiet.

321
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:30,108
You're not mad at me,
are you?

322
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:36,145
Oh, baby!

323
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,850
Oh, baby, it's not even
Saturday night.

324
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:43,325
Oh, Alice, you
drive me crazy.

325
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:47,626
Oh, has Daddy's little girl
been naughty tonight?

326
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:50,030
George?

327
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,125
Who you talking to?

328
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:09,542
How dare you!
Are you crazy?

329
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,384
Did you think you were
gonna get away with it?

330
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:17,318
Ohh... that's
how you do it!

331
00:37:17,394 --> 00:37:20,124
I'll put a stop to that.

332
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:23,655
You've ruined my life,
my furniture, my clothes!

333
00:37:23,734 --> 00:37:27,431
My family likes you
more than they like me.

334
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:30,234
Why? All you do
is drool and shed.

335
00:37:30,307 --> 00:37:34,573
You're never getting out
of there again. Never!

336
00:37:34,645 --> 00:37:37,307
Do we understand each other?

337
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:40,043
Do we...

338
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,536
Hey, little buddy.
How ya doin'?

339
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:07,600
Thank you.
Good work.

340
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:23,085
- Vernon!
- Come on, Harvey.

341
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,594
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

342
00:38:25,663 --> 00:38:27,722
I don't like it
when you tease the dogs.

343
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:31,165
Are you some kind
of animal lover?

344
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:51,812
We've developed
a new type of ammunition.

345
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:54,323
It explodes on contact.

346
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:58,122
We'd like you to use this
revolver for the tests.

347
00:38:58,195 --> 00:39:02,256
We want to know the extent
of the damage at close range.

348
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:11,036
You wanna know
how messy it is.

349
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:17,144
I presume you can get dogs
with big skulls for the tests.

350
00:39:17,214 --> 00:39:20,342
Newfoundlands,
Great Danes, St. Bernards.

351
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:22,510
Large dogs are
difficult to come by...

352
00:39:22,586 --> 00:39:26,078
harder to manage.

353
00:39:39,636 --> 00:39:42,628
I'm sure we'll
be able to handle it.

354
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:13,831
- Mr. Newton?
- Yes.

355
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:17,738
I'm Dr. Varnick.
This must be Beethoven.

356
00:40:19,643 --> 00:40:23,841
He's a magnificent animal.
Magnificent!

357
00:40:23,914 --> 00:40:27,782
Magnificent, ahh!

358
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:30,411
- In for his shots?
- That's right.

359
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:33,217
He'll be a little groggy
this evening.

360
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,383
That'll be nice.

361
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:38,656
You should leave him
overnight for observation.

362
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,493
- I'd be happy to.
- Dad!

363
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,692
It's just a shot.
He'll be okay.

364
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:47,498
Let's take him home.
He's scared and wants to go home.

365
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:52,406
Mr. Newton, I wonder if I might
have a word with you privately.

366
00:40:52,476 --> 00:40:53,602
Sure.

367
00:40:53,677 --> 00:40:57,340
Good dog.

368
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:01,643
Take good care of
these nice people.

369
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:04,710
They aren't gonna
hurt Beethoven, are they?

370
00:41:04,788 --> 00:41:07,382
Nothing could hurt Beethoven.

371
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:21,700
Please, sit down.

372
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:29,143
Mr. Newton, have you...

373
00:41:29,213 --> 00:41:32,876
Have you noticed anything strange
about your dog lately?

374
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:41,321
You know, I mean, he's...
He's destroyed my life.

375
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:44,451
I wish I was kidding.

376
00:41:44,528 --> 00:41:49,295
That's very funny. St. Bernards
have been heavily over-bred.

377
00:41:49,366 --> 00:41:54,668
There's been quite a bit written
about behavioral problems.

378
00:41:54,738 --> 00:41:57,832
- What kind of problems?
- Well...

379
00:41:57,908 --> 00:42:02,607
I've had to put down several
over the past months.

380
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:06,445
They have a tendency
to turn on people...

381
00:42:06,517 --> 00:42:08,849
attack without
provocation.

382
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:13,288
I only mention this
because you have children.

383
00:42:20,597 --> 00:42:22,531
Good boy!

384
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,659
George, come on.

385
00:42:25,736 --> 00:42:29,399
Beethoven isn't even remotely dangerous.
He'd never hurt the kids.

386
00:42:29,473 --> 00:42:31,737
He might take a bite
out of you, though.

387
00:42:31,808 --> 00:42:36,404
First snarl, first any kind
of weirdness, and he's gone.

388
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,042
Weirdness? What should I watch for,
his wearing my clothes?

389
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:49,053
Good boy!

390
00:42:49,126 --> 00:42:52,095
You guys are
gonna love Devonia.

391
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:54,426
I don't need a baby-sitter.

392
00:42:54,498 --> 00:42:57,797
How come you gotta go back to work?

393
00:42:57,868 --> 00:43:01,395
There's no point of us
going into this with a bad attitude.

394
00:43:01,471 --> 00:43:04,406
Hi there,
you little cutie!

395
00:43:04,474 --> 00:43:07,375
Don't you worry
about a thing.

396
00:43:07,444 --> 00:43:10,572
We're gonna get along great.
Right, kids?

397
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:13,844
I'll be back before dinner,
so it's not that long.

398
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:15,851
We're gonna do neat stuff.

399
00:43:15,919 --> 00:43:19,582
I was hopin' we could
sing a tune together. You like music?

400
00:43:19,656 --> 00:43:21,590
What kind of music?

401
00:43:21,658 --> 00:43:26,152
How about Herb Alpert
and the Tijuana Brass? Oh, sorry.

402
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,130
I am a nut for
the disco beat!

403
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:32,600
Okay, kids, be good.

404
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,147
- You've had some time to think and...
- And we made our decision.

405
00:43:58,028 --> 00:44:01,361
We wanna get in bed with
Newton Auto Air Fresheners.

406
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:03,661
Excellent!
That's just great!

407
00:44:03,734 --> 00:44:06,532
- Thank you very much.
- As quickly as possible.

408
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:09,037
We meet our lawyers today
and have the papers drawn up.

409
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:11,040
That's excellent!

410
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,133
Let us take you
out to dinner.

411
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,440
Are there any good restaurants
in this burgh?

412
00:44:15,512 --> 00:44:19,471
Ah... restaurants.
Uh, what?

413
00:44:19,549 --> 00:44:23,417
- Why don't you come to our house?
- We'll barbecue.

414
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:28,356
Barbecue!
Let's live dangerously!

415
00:44:28,425 --> 00:44:32,452
Well, our food may not be great,
but it's not dangerous.

416
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:35,828
I hope it's better
than this espresso.

417
00:44:41,636 --> 00:44:44,366
Lady Marmalade
down in old New Orleans

418
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:47,431
Struttin'her stuff
on the street

419
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:53,038
She said, Hello, BigJoe
You want to give it a go

420
00:44:53,114 --> 00:44:56,550
Gitchy, gitchy
Ya-ya, da-da

421
00:45:16,638 --> 00:45:18,731
Soul sister
Go, sister

422
00:45:18,806 --> 00:45:22,867
Hey, sister, go, sister
Soul sister, go, sister

423
00:45:22,944 --> 00:45:27,108
Make Marmalade
down in old New Orleans

424
00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:39,156
Help!

425
00:45:51,272 --> 00:45:52,933
Help, somebody!

426
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,521
I love you too.

427
00:46:54,636 --> 00:46:58,003
Thanks, Beethoven.
You saved my life.

428
00:46:58,072 --> 00:47:02,941
But you better go home now.
Mom said to stay in the backyard.

429
00:47:03,011 --> 00:47:06,640
You kids might be interested
to know that I am a performer...

430
00:47:06,714 --> 00:47:08,739
Saturday nights
at the Padded Zebra.

431
00:47:10,051 --> 00:47:12,144
Oh, my gosh!
Emily's in the pool!

432
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,517
The pool?

433
00:47:16,391 --> 00:47:20,327
- Emily!
- What are you doing in the pool?

434
00:47:20,395 --> 00:47:23,296
Get out this instant.
You want to get me into trouble?

435
00:47:23,364 --> 00:47:25,889
- Emily, are you all right?
- I fell in.

436
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:28,527
Oh, Emily,
you must've been so scared!

437
00:47:28,603 --> 00:47:31,163
I thought
I was gonna die.

438
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:33,469
Oh, you poor little thing.

439
00:47:33,541 --> 00:47:37,602
Now, you were never
in any real danger, were you?

440
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,810
We don't want you to get into trouble,
so we'll let this be our little secret.

441
00:47:42,884 --> 00:47:46,047
I'd like to call
my mother, please.

442
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,021
- Your mother?
- Immediately.

443
00:47:51,993 --> 00:47:55,258
She must've snuck out while
I was watching Ted and Ryce.

444
00:47:55,329 --> 00:47:58,958
It was hot out, so I guess
she wanted to take a little swim.

445
00:47:59,033 --> 00:48:02,196
And where were you while
all this was happening?

446
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:06,001
Where I was supposed to be,
inside watching the other two.

447
00:48:06,074 --> 00:48:09,976
If Emily had stayed where I put her,
none of this would've happened.

448
00:48:10,044 --> 00:48:14,208
If you ask me, what these children need
is a little discipline.

449
00:48:14,282 --> 00:48:17,615
What these children need
is their mother.

450
00:48:17,685 --> 00:48:20,313
You're fired.

451
00:48:20,388 --> 00:48:22,879
- Honey, it was an accident.
- So what?

452
00:48:22,957 --> 00:48:26,324
We can't throw out having a baby-sitter
because we had a bad one.

453
00:48:26,394 --> 00:48:30,797
We'll find somebody responsible
to look after the kids.

454
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:33,766
- Over my dead body.
- Oh, come on.

455
00:48:37,305 --> 00:48:41,241
We're fine on our own.
You don't have to entertain us.

456
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:51,450
Do you have any kids?

457
00:48:54,722 --> 00:48:56,781
We have a career.

458
00:48:56,858 --> 00:48:58,917
Big one.

459
00:48:58,993 --> 00:49:01,257
Excuse us.

460
00:49:07,168 --> 00:49:09,261
- Brats.
- Monsters.

461
00:49:09,337 --> 00:49:11,430
If we pull this off...

462
00:49:11,506 --> 00:49:15,840
in six months we will own
Newton Auto Air Fresheners.

463
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,401
Touch it.

464
00:49:21,282 --> 00:49:22,943
Sorry for the delay.

465
00:49:23,017 --> 00:49:25,417
- We, we, we...
- No problem.

466
00:49:25,486 --> 00:49:27,784
- Vegetables. Here you go.
- Look at that.

467
00:49:27,855 --> 00:49:32,451
- Here's the paperwork, Giorgio.
- I've got my own chair, honey.

468
00:49:38,399 --> 00:49:41,266
- Look at that.
- You gonna do that now, honey?

469
00:49:41,335 --> 00:49:42,768
Alicia.

470
00:49:42,837 --> 00:49:44,737
- Alice.
- Alice.

471
00:49:44,806 --> 00:49:47,798
I'm sorry. Alice.
Could I have a refill, please?

472
00:49:49,544 --> 00:49:51,102
Sure.

473
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:53,079
Thank you.

474
00:49:55,082 --> 00:49:58,540
Just right down
at the bottom, George.

475
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:02,646
This is everything we've discussed?

476
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:04,657
Oh, yes, exactly.

477
00:50:04,725 --> 00:50:06,920
Right at the bottom you can sign.

478
00:50:06,994 --> 00:50:11,795
Hon, don't sign that now. Why don't
we have a little something to eat?

479
00:50:11,866 --> 00:50:14,960
- You can read it over...
- Alice, tell me about your dog.

480
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:18,465
Well, he's a dog.

481
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:22,407
He sure is!
Hello, cutesy-ootsy.

482
00:50:22,476 --> 00:50:26,435
- He's a St. Bernard.
- He's a purebred St. Bernard, isn't he?

483
00:50:26,514 --> 00:50:29,745
Hello. Oh, look at that big old tongue!

484
00:50:29,817 --> 00:50:31,512
Yes!

485
00:50:31,586 --> 00:50:34,953
Look at that.
Come here. Oh, yeah.

486
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:38,514
You wanna come
with Mommy and Daddy? Yes, you do.

487
00:50:38,593 --> 00:50:40,720
Oh, come on.
We'll come to Mommy and Daddy.

488
00:50:40,795 --> 00:50:42,763
Come on. Come on!

489
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:45,060
I just love these
big, dumb animals.

490
00:50:45,132 --> 00:50:47,430
I bet you do.

491
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:50,334
Dogs obey so much better
than children, don't they?

492
00:50:50,404 --> 00:50:54,636
Come here.
Oh, look, cutesy-ootsy-oogy.

493
00:50:54,709 --> 00:51:00,272
Oh, Mama just loves
this great big doggie-woggie.

494
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:04,418
The places for you to sign...

495
00:51:04,485 --> 00:51:07,010
are marked by that
blue clip right there.

496
00:51:07,088 --> 00:51:09,079
These are all
standard stuff?

497
00:51:09,156 --> 00:51:12,125
You sure you wanna
"signee-wignee" right now?

498
00:51:12,193 --> 00:51:15,856
Oh!
Alice, I'm sorry.

499
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:18,865
I've got that. I don't
want you to break a nail.

500
00:51:18,933 --> 00:51:22,869
Right down there where
the blue arrow is.

501
00:51:22,937 --> 00:51:24,495
Right there, George.

502
00:51:24,572 --> 00:51:27,370
Honey, you sit.
I've got this.

503
00:51:29,677 --> 00:51:31,838
You guys don't seem
to have made a good impression.

504
00:51:31,913 --> 00:51:33,346
I'm crushed.

505
00:51:33,414 --> 00:51:35,814
- Me too.
- I'll cry all night.

506
00:51:35,883 --> 00:51:39,683
I don't like 'em either. But these
people are important to Dad's business.

507
00:51:39,754 --> 00:51:43,246
I hope Beethoven slimes
that lady's dress.

508
00:51:43,324 --> 00:51:45,656
If you don't want our capital...

509
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:47,990
we could find another
investment somewhere else.

510
00:51:48,062 --> 00:51:50,997
- Sure!
- No, no, no, no.

511
00:51:52,266 --> 00:51:56,794
- Beethoven, down, down.
- Is there some problem?

512
00:51:56,871 --> 00:51:58,771
- No, no.
- Did I miss anything?

513
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:01,603
No. Giorgio has gone over
all the papers...

514
00:52:01,676 --> 00:52:03,974
and he's about to sign.

515
00:52:04,045 --> 00:52:06,343
Just standard stuff,
really.

516
00:52:08,282 --> 00:52:10,273
Will you get outta here,
you mutt?

517
00:52:13,921 --> 00:52:15,786
I pitched in college.

518
00:52:34,008 --> 00:52:36,272
Beethoven, stop!

519
00:52:36,344 --> 00:52:38,471
Bad dog!

520
00:52:39,413 --> 00:52:41,574
Sit! Stop! Stay!

521
00:52:41,649 --> 00:52:43,913
No!

522
00:52:53,227 --> 00:52:55,889
Beethoven!

523
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:26,824
I really don't like our dog.

524
00:53:28,729 --> 00:53:31,459
I really don't like those people.

525
00:53:31,532 --> 00:53:33,625
I don't trust them.

526
00:53:33,701 --> 00:53:37,637
I don't want their money.

527
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,902
I know my opinion
doesn't matter, but...

528
00:53:41,976 --> 00:53:44,467
I'm not interested
in expanding.

529
00:53:44,545 --> 00:53:46,877
If I had been home instead of
helping you impress those morons...

530
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:49,177
Emily wouldn't have
fallen in the pool.

531
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:52,378
And I'm not reentering
the workforce, George.

532
00:53:52,453 --> 00:53:55,183
You're gonna have
to do this on your own.

533
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,918
And you will.

534
00:53:58,993 --> 00:54:01,826
Somehow you'll make
your fortune.

535
00:54:01,896 --> 00:54:05,559
And tucked away behind you deep
in the shadows will be me and the kids.

536
00:54:10,671 --> 00:54:13,105
That's how you see me.

537
00:54:13,174 --> 00:54:16,371
Suddenly I'm a lousy
husband and father.

538
00:54:16,444 --> 00:54:21,848
Everything was fine
until Beethoven came into our lives.

539
00:54:23,184 --> 00:54:26,813
I've tried to be patient,
but I've had it.

540
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:29,014
The dog has to go.

541
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,921
I'm proud of Beethoven.

542
00:54:30,991 --> 00:54:34,017
Those two idiots insulted your kids,
treated me like dirt.

543
00:54:34,095 --> 00:54:39,397
He was the only one who had the nerve
to give them the ride they deserved.

544
00:54:39,467 --> 00:54:41,697
I'm going to bed.

545
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:47,298
My dream's going down the drain,
and you're worried about a dog.

546
00:54:50,211 --> 00:54:55,205
Your family's going down the drain,
and you're worried about a dream.

547
00:55:14,935 --> 00:55:17,733
Oh, hush.

548
00:55:17,805 --> 00:55:21,263
Why do we gotta be so quiet?

549
00:55:47,868 --> 00:55:50,462
You're a big boy!

550
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:30,403
- Sit down.
- We made you breakfast, Dad.

551
00:56:30,477 --> 00:56:33,708
- Scrambled eggs the way you like them.
- I fed Beethoven.

552
00:56:33,781 --> 00:56:35,442
We washed him too.

553
00:56:38,018 --> 00:56:39,883
You should smell him.

554
00:56:39,954 --> 00:56:41,819
I'm gonna walk Beethoven
every day.

555
00:56:41,889 --> 00:56:47,384
We divided up the dog chores. You won't
have to do anything for Beethoven.

556
00:56:47,461 --> 00:56:48,894
I see.

557
00:56:48,963 --> 00:56:53,400
Is there anything else you need?
Anything else at all?

558
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:55,935
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

559
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:03,902
I dropped part of
an eggshell in there.

560
00:57:03,978 --> 00:57:06,344
Chew carefully, Dad.

561
00:57:11,218 --> 00:57:14,881
Okay, fine. Great, Ryce.
I'm gonna get that thing.

562
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:16,650
- That leaf's mine.
- I get the next one!

563
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:19,022
Okay, fine.
Get that question box.

564
00:57:19,093 --> 00:57:21,288
Give me five.

565
00:57:21,362 --> 00:57:23,330
Shake.

566
00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:30,300
Mrs. Newton.

567
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:33,238
- Yes.
- I'm Dr. Varnick, the veterinarian.

568
00:57:33,307 --> 00:57:36,470
I'm sorry to trouble you...

569
00:57:36,543 --> 00:57:39,205
but I wonder
if I might come in?

570
00:57:41,715 --> 00:57:43,307
Well, sure.
Come on in.

571
00:57:43,384 --> 00:57:45,318
With animals
as large as yours...

572
00:57:45,386 --> 00:57:49,413
I like to do a follow-up on rabies shots
just to see how he's doing.

573
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,789
- It's nice of you to come down here.
- No trouble at all.

574
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:56,387
- Here you go.
- Thank you. I'll only be a moment.

575
00:57:56,463 --> 00:57:58,556
Would you like a lemonade?

576
00:57:58,632 --> 00:58:00,725
- Oh, no, I'll be fine. Thank you.
- All right.

577
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:05,795
Well, Beethoven,
how are you doing? Huh?

578
00:58:07,408 --> 00:58:09,569
Lookin'good.
Lookin'good.

579
00:58:17,584 --> 00:58:20,212
Beethoven, this
is gonna hurt you...

580
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,347
a lot more than
it hurts me.

581
00:58:23,424 --> 00:58:26,860
But it's a great
benefit to mankind.

582
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:29,293
Put some of this here.

583
00:58:29,363 --> 00:58:31,695
- I'm gonna get those bones.
- No, I get some!

584
00:58:31,765 --> 00:58:33,630
You get the next.

585
00:58:38,072 --> 00:58:41,735
Okay, that'll do ya.

586
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:47,237
All right now.

587
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,347
- No!
- Emily, what's the matter?

588
00:58:56,423 --> 00:58:58,653
Come on,
you big stupid mutt!

589
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:03,229
Help! Help!

590
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:10,293
George!
Oh, my God!

591
00:59:10,371 --> 00:59:13,306
Help, somebody!
Help!

592
00:59:13,374 --> 00:59:15,467
Good boy. Good boy!

593
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:18,636
Beethoven! Beethoven!

594
00:59:18,712 --> 00:59:20,805
- No!
- Get off him.

595
00:59:20,881 --> 00:59:23,179
Beethoven!

596
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:26,276
Beethoven.
Oh, my gosh, Beethoven!

597
00:59:26,353 --> 00:59:30,813
- Why'd he do that?
- My gosh, look what he did!

598
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:33,860
- Are you all right?
- Well, I don't know.

599
00:59:33,927 --> 00:59:36,862
- What happened?
- He just lunged at me!

600
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:40,093
That's not true.
I saw you hit Beethoven.

601
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:45,264
- Emily, please.
- Why would I? I patted him on the head.

602
00:59:45,339 --> 00:59:47,204
It's possible that
from a distance the child...

603
00:59:47,274 --> 00:59:49,037
Liar!

604
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:52,510
- Emily!
- I'm sorry. Everything's all right.

605
00:59:52,579 --> 00:59:56,242
It's very natural the child
would want to defend her dog.

606
00:59:56,316 --> 00:59:58,944
- Let's call an ambulance.
- No, no. I'll take care of it.

607
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:01,715
I'll take care
of this myself.

608
01:00:03,957 --> 01:00:06,187
I'm terribly sorry.

609
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,888
He's never done anything
like this before.

610
01:00:08,962 --> 01:00:13,399
Once an animal crosses the line
and attacks a human being...

611
01:00:13,467 --> 01:00:16,459
you can rest assured
he'll do it again.

612
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:19,199
Of course, next time
it could be one of your children.

613
01:00:19,273 --> 01:00:23,300
I'm very, very sorry.
Let me help.

614
01:00:23,377 --> 01:00:26,505
Mr. Newton, we have
a real problem here.

615
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:30,346
The law is very clear when
it comes to dealing with this.

616
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:32,510
Unless you bring the animal
to my office immediately...

617
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:36,022
I'm afraid I'll be forced
to press charges.

618
01:00:42,496 --> 01:00:44,760
I'm, I'm so sorry.

619
01:00:56,908 --> 01:01:00,639
I don't want anything
to happen to Beethoven.

620
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:06,147
Dad won't believe us
'cause he hates Beethoven.

621
01:01:06,217 --> 01:01:09,618
He's always
hated Beethoven.

622
01:02:03,274 --> 01:02:05,139
Dad has Beethoven!

623
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:07,643
Wait, wait!
Stop!

624
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:17,085
Stop! Daddy!

625
01:02:19,957 --> 01:02:24,053
Wait! Wait!

626
01:02:47,852 --> 01:02:52,721
My dad had to take our dog
to the vet to be put down.

627
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:54,917
I hated him for it.

628
01:02:54,992 --> 01:02:59,361
Now I'm doing it myself.

629
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,336
I know you won't believe me,
but I don't wanna do this.

630
01:03:11,175 --> 01:03:13,700
You understand.

631
01:03:13,778 --> 01:03:16,372
It's not your fault.

632
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:44,507
- Mr. Newton.
- Dr. Varnick.

633
01:03:44,575 --> 01:03:48,705
I know that you're doing
the right thing.

634
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,510
I hope so.

635
01:03:51,582 --> 01:03:53,106
Follow me.

636
01:03:57,789 --> 01:03:59,620
Come on. Come on.

637
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:01,851
How is your arm?

638
01:04:01,926 --> 01:04:04,258
Oh, it's fine, fine.

639
01:04:04,328 --> 01:04:08,287
- 37 stitches.
- I'm so sorry.

640
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:10,732
Do you want the collar
and tags?

641
01:04:10,802 --> 01:04:15,671
- Some people like to keep them.
- Yeah.

642
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:19,335
Do you mind?
I have the bad wing.

643
01:04:20,578 --> 01:04:22,944
Come here.
Come here.

644
01:04:41,365 --> 01:04:43,424
I'm sorry.

645
01:04:44,502 --> 01:04:47,198
You were my dog too.

646
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:01,484
Sad state of affairs.

647
01:05:01,552 --> 01:05:05,283
Sad state of affairs.
Come on, boy. Come on.

648
01:05:05,356 --> 01:05:07,551
Come on, boy.

649
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:11,823
In you go.
There you go.

650
01:05:13,197 --> 01:05:16,189
All right.
Magnificent.

651
01:05:31,649 --> 01:05:33,844
George Newton.

652
01:05:33,918 --> 01:05:36,546
We're gonna have to charge you
for a day's boarding...

653
01:05:36,621 --> 01:05:40,148
becauseJimmy, who handles the
lethal injections and disposals...

654
01:05:40,224 --> 01:05:43,193
he doesn't work today so we're gonna
have to hold the dog overnight.

655
01:05:43,261 --> 01:05:46,025
Should we bill you?

656
01:06:37,248 --> 01:06:39,944
Dog killer!

657
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:45,486
- Nice dog, huh, Doc?
- He's perfect for the animal experiment.

658
01:06:45,556 --> 01:06:48,389
Get everything ready.
I'll be by in the morning.

659
01:06:48,459 --> 01:06:50,518
We'll do the test
on him first thing.

660
01:06:50,594 --> 01:06:52,960
All right.

661
01:06:59,804 --> 01:07:02,170
Nice doggie, good doggie.

662
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:04,332
Okay, close the door.

663
01:07:04,408 --> 01:07:07,502
I've got him.
Come on!

664
01:07:07,578 --> 01:07:10,741
Good doggie. Come here, doggie.

665
01:07:10,815 --> 01:07:12,715
- Okay, I got him.
- Good, good.

666
01:07:12,783 --> 01:07:17,015
- I got him. Come on, doggie.
- Not you! The dog!

667
01:07:18,055 --> 01:07:20,387
Put him in.
Okay, you got him?

668
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:23,018
In the cage. Get in.

669
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:35,837
Shut up!

670
01:07:35,906 --> 01:07:37,897
There.

671
01:07:37,975 --> 01:07:40,443
Doc will work on him
first thing in the morning...

672
01:07:40,511 --> 01:07:42,672
and then he's
one dead puppy.

673
01:07:42,747 --> 01:07:44,840
Can we eat?

674
01:07:44,915 --> 01:07:46,940
- Yeah. You hungry?
- Yeah. I'm hungry.

675
01:07:47,018 --> 01:07:50,419
- What do you feel like?
- A chef's salad.

676
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:05,034
Did I do the wrong thing?

677
01:08:06,504 --> 01:08:08,938
I don't know, honey.

678
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:15,504
Beethoven made
this house real.

679
01:08:18,516 --> 01:08:21,178
He put the dents in it.

680
01:08:23,587 --> 01:08:28,081
I know he slobbered,
and he smelled bad, but he loved us.

681
01:08:30,461 --> 01:08:32,793
Even you.

682
01:08:36,801 --> 01:08:39,235
I just hope your motives
were pure...

683
01:08:39,303 --> 01:08:41,931
and you did this for
the safety of the kids.

684
01:08:42,006 --> 01:08:44,804
Because I really hate to think
we sold Beethoven down the river...

685
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:48,311
for a piece of carpet
or a chance to sell more air freshener.

686
01:08:48,379 --> 01:08:51,473
It had nothing to do with carpet
or air freshener. You saw what he did.

687
01:08:51,549 --> 01:08:55,508
I know. But we don't
know why he did it.

688
01:08:55,586 --> 01:08:59,147
Maybe the vet didn't hit him, but maybe
he handled him too rough or something.

689
01:08:59,223 --> 01:09:01,453
Emily's really
sticking to this.

690
01:09:01,525 --> 01:09:04,858
Have we ever known her to attack
an adult and accuse them of lying?

691
01:09:04,929 --> 01:09:07,864
No, but why would
a vet say that?

692
01:09:07,932 --> 01:09:10,833
Instead of listening to some guy
we've met only twice...

693
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:14,769
maybe we should try
listening to our own child.

694
01:09:14,839 --> 01:09:20,072
Honey, something doesn't make sense.
Can't we talk to him?

695
01:09:20,144 --> 01:09:22,339
Oh, what do you
want me to do?

696
01:09:22,413 --> 01:09:26,042
Dr. Varnick, are you sure
you didn't hit our dog?

697
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:28,813
Yes, Mr. Newton,
I just remembered I did hit your dog.

698
01:09:28,886 --> 01:09:32,447
- Come on!
- It'd make me feel better. Let's go.

699
01:09:33,691 --> 01:09:36,854
- I'm coming with you.
- So am I.

700
01:09:36,927 --> 01:09:38,861
We're all going
with you.

701
01:09:53,978 --> 01:09:56,003
I'm terribly sorry.

702
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,378
- We want our dog back!
- Where's Beethoven?

703
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:01,077
- Kids, let Daddy handle this.
- What can I do for you?

704
01:10:01,152 --> 01:10:04,144
- We want our dog back!
- I'm terribly sorry.

705
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:07,816
It's too late.
The dog's been destroyed.

706
01:10:07,892 --> 01:10:10,986
- Dad?
- Now, wait a minute.

707
01:10:11,061 --> 01:10:13,052
I was told this
wouldn't happen until tomorrow.

708
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,691
- I don't believe you!
- Hey, hey, hey!

709
01:10:16,767 --> 01:10:18,826
Take your hands off her!
What are you...

710
01:10:23,741 --> 01:10:26,938
I told you
he was lying.

711
01:10:27,011 --> 01:10:30,447
What the hell
are you trying to pull?

712
01:10:30,514 --> 01:10:32,982
You can't come in here.
This is private property.

713
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:35,143
Beethoven?

714
01:10:38,422 --> 01:10:40,982
- He's not here.
- Hold it right there.

715
01:10:41,058 --> 01:10:43,288
You have no right to be in here.
Out, all of you.

716
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,089
Where's my dog?

717
01:10:45,162 --> 01:10:47,995
I don't have to answer
your questions.

718
01:10:48,065 --> 01:10:52,798
You ordered that dog destroyed,
and it was done. Now get out.

719
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:56,829
You hit me, I'll have you put
in jail for assault and battery.

720
01:11:07,718 --> 01:11:09,481
- Whoa!
- Dad!

721
01:11:09,553 --> 01:11:11,544
- Honey!
- That was amazing.

722
01:11:11,622 --> 01:11:13,954
Dad, you were awesome.

723
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:18,017
- You were really cool.
- I never found you more attractive.

724
01:11:19,496 --> 01:11:21,896
I may need an X ray.

725
01:11:21,966 --> 01:11:25,697
- He said our dog bit him.
- But he didn't really. Tell him.

726
01:11:25,769 --> 01:11:28,670
There were no bite marks
on his arm!

727
01:11:28,739 --> 01:11:32,971
"So what?"
What do you mean?

728
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:35,739
I'd like to file
a report on you!

729
01:11:35,813 --> 01:11:38,304
What? They're not
going to help us?

730
01:11:38,382 --> 01:11:40,316
- Not this year.
- Dad?

731
01:11:40,384 --> 01:11:41,976
- Look.
- Dr. Varnick.

732
01:11:52,763 --> 01:11:54,754
Let's follow him.

733
01:11:54,832 --> 01:11:57,801
Maybe he'll lead us
to Beethoven.

734
01:12:02,473 --> 01:12:05,237
Hold your door.
Hold your door.

735
01:12:07,011 --> 01:12:09,241
Shut it.

736
01:12:14,351 --> 01:12:17,411
Dad, haven't you ever followed anyone?

737
01:12:17,488 --> 01:12:20,719
Turn off your lights.

738
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:43,178
- I think that's the last of it.
- Start getting the dogs.

739
01:12:43,247 --> 01:12:44,942
The dogs?

740
01:12:45,015 --> 01:12:48,678
Yeah! He said we gotta
destroy all the evidence.

741
01:13:32,529 --> 01:13:34,963
I'm gonna check this out.

742
01:13:43,073 --> 01:13:44,973
It's 9:30.

743
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:47,340
If I'm not back
in 15 minutes...

744
01:13:47,411 --> 01:13:49,879
call the police.

745
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:52,780
Don't come in after me.

746
01:13:58,555 --> 01:14:00,819
Before you
destroy the dogs...

747
01:14:00,891 --> 01:14:03,792
bring me the St. Bernard
for the ammo test.

748
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:06,385
Okay.

749
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:09,660
And bring me a little one
for this chemical test.

750
01:14:09,733 --> 01:14:12,702
Sure.
I know just the one.

751
01:14:12,769 --> 01:14:15,329
Hurry up.

752
01:14:30,153 --> 01:14:32,087
Latch.

753
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:42,630
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a pioneer.

754
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:45,634
- Like Davy Crockett, right?
- Right.

755
01:15:02,886 --> 01:15:05,013
Good doggie!

756
01:15:14,665 --> 01:15:17,065
Oh, no! No, no!

757
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:38,921
I'm saving you.
I'm saving you!

758
01:15:52,102 --> 01:15:55,697
He pushed me on the ground,
and I couldn't get up.

759
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:03,310
Emily, come on.
Here, Ryce, take her.

760
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:07,146
Lock the doors.
If I'm not back in 15...

761
01:16:07,217 --> 01:16:10,948
- I'll be back.
- Lock the doors. Lock that one.

762
01:16:18,795 --> 01:16:21,093
Nice doggie.

763
01:16:21,164 --> 01:16:24,190
We're gonna have a field test
with this new ammo.

764
01:16:27,037 --> 01:16:28,937
So long.

765
01:16:40,016 --> 01:16:43,747
You're a very foolish man,
Mr. Newton.

766
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:45,583
You should've left
well enough alone.

767
01:16:51,795 --> 01:16:54,787
- That was a gun!
- Daddy!

768
01:16:54,865 --> 01:16:57,925
- Mom, get over here!
- There's no time!

769
01:17:03,874 --> 01:17:06,570
I don't know where.
It's a big thing, a warehouse!

770
01:17:06,643 --> 01:17:08,975
- Buckle up.
- You can't drive.

771
01:17:09,045 --> 01:17:10,535
You don't have a license!

772
01:17:10,614 --> 01:17:13,606
- We're going in!
- What are you doing?

773
01:17:13,683 --> 01:17:15,583
I don't know.
It's a...

774
01:17:19,022 --> 01:17:22,116
Ted! Ted!

775
01:17:23,794 --> 01:17:25,523
Ya-hoo!

776
01:17:44,881 --> 01:17:46,974
- Cool.
- Dad!

777
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:48,950
Dad!

778
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:50,782
Dad!

779
01:17:50,854 --> 01:17:53,618
Oh, my babies!
Are you all right?

780
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:56,955
- Beethoven!
- Beethoven!

781
01:17:57,027 --> 01:18:01,293
- I love this dog. What a good doggie!
- George!

782
01:18:01,364 --> 01:18:04,094
George!
Oh, my God!

783
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:07,603
Be careful!

784
01:18:07,671 --> 01:18:10,105
- Is everyone alive?
- Oh, yeah. Where were you?

785
01:18:10,173 --> 01:18:12,232
I was shopping, George!
I called the police.

786
01:18:12,309 --> 01:18:15,710
- I jumped. I fell on the guys.
- You're kidding?

787
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:18,475
- You let Ted drive through the door!
- I didn't let him drive!

788
01:18:18,548 --> 01:18:21,244
- Don't yell at me!
- I'm not yelling.

789
01:18:21,318 --> 01:18:24,481
Oh, I love you too.

790
01:18:24,554 --> 01:18:26,886
- You're free!
- You can go home!

791
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:28,891
You're free! You're free!

792
01:18:42,906 --> 01:18:45,033
Go, go!

793
01:18:45,108 --> 01:18:46,666
Sic 'em, boys!

794
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:12,999
Help!
Get outta my way!

795
01:19:25,582 --> 01:19:27,516
Oh, my God!

796
01:19:27,584 --> 01:19:29,518
Out of my way!

797
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,954
Come on, Harvey.
Over the fence.

798
01:19:55,612 --> 01:19:58,308
You thought you could get me,
you feebleminded mongrels!

799
01:19:58,381 --> 01:20:02,579
- Stupid, stupid doggies!
- Never! You'll never get me!

800
01:20:05,689 --> 01:20:09,284
- Never!
- Stupid, stupid doggies.

801
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:11,350
Stupid, stupid doggies!

802
01:20:13,596 --> 01:20:15,325
Stupid, stupid...

803
01:20:15,398 --> 01:20:17,059
You little mangy thing!

804
01:20:17,133 --> 01:20:18,964
And you and you,
you little one!

805
01:20:19,035 --> 01:20:21,401
Never! Never!

806
01:20:21,471 --> 01:20:23,462
You little mangy...

807
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:26,008
What?

808
01:20:44,661 --> 01:20:47,129
The final chapter of a horror
story for animal lovers...

809
01:20:47,197 --> 01:20:49,324
concluded at
County Courthouse today.

810
01:20:49,399 --> 01:20:52,266
- Ruth Walters has the details.
- Animal lovers everywhere...

811
01:20:52,335 --> 01:20:54,860
Hey, it's us!

812
01:20:54,938 --> 01:20:59,034
...when Dr. Varnick and two associates
were indicted on animal abuse.

813
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:02,078
Boo! Hiss!

814
01:21:02,145 --> 01:21:04,773
These were scientific
investigations!

815
01:21:04,848 --> 01:21:07,715
And leading the cheers were
the ring's unlikely captors...

816
01:21:07,784 --> 01:21:09,775
the Newton family
of Valley Vista.

817
01:21:11,988 --> 01:21:14,513
I had no choice.

818
01:21:14,591 --> 01:21:18,823
Beethoven is not just some dog
that wandered in off the street.

819
01:21:18,895 --> 01:21:22,558
He's a member of our family,
and we love him very much.

820
01:21:22,632 --> 01:21:24,497
Have you always been a dog lover?

821
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:33,237
Maybe not as much as now.

822
01:21:33,309 --> 01:21:35,072
Thank you.

823
01:21:37,747 --> 01:21:40,648
This is Ruth Walters reporting
from County Courthouse.

824
01:21:44,621 --> 01:21:46,953
Okay, guys.
Let's go to bed.

825
01:21:47,023 --> 01:21:50,049
- Oh, do we have to?
- It's been a long day.

826
01:21:50,126 --> 01:21:54,028
- You look beautiful.
- Daddy, you're the best.

827
01:21:54,097 --> 01:21:56,793
- Good night, Dad. I love you.
- Good night, sweetheart.

828
01:21:56,866 --> 01:21:59,300
Say good night to Daddy.

829
01:21:59,369 --> 01:22:01,462
Can I stay up?

830
01:22:01,538 --> 01:22:03,699
You are up!

831
01:22:04,774 --> 01:22:06,969
Go to sleep.

832
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:11,405
Hello? Yeah.

833
01:22:11,481 --> 01:22:14,245
Hold on one second.

834
01:22:14,317 --> 01:22:16,444
Ryce?
Who's calling?

835
01:22:16,519 --> 01:22:18,987
Ryce!

836
01:22:19,055 --> 01:22:20,955
- Don't stay on too long.
- Okay.

837
01:22:21,024 --> 01:22:23,151
Dad, who is it?

838
01:22:23,226 --> 01:22:27,287
Somebody who saw you on TV.
Mark something.

839
01:22:27,363 --> 01:22:30,264
Mark.

840
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:33,769
Hello?

841
01:22:33,837 --> 01:22:35,634
Yeah.

842
01:22:35,705 --> 01:22:37,832
No.

843
01:22:38,808 --> 01:22:41,743
Really? Friday?

844
01:22:43,113 --> 01:22:45,877
Good night, honey.

845
01:22:45,949 --> 01:22:48,042
Good night.

846
01:22:49,652 --> 01:22:52,678
Sleep tight.

847
01:22:54,891 --> 01:22:57,917
Good night, Beethoven.

848
01:22:57,994 --> 01:23:00,121
Good night, Sparky.

849
01:23:00,196 --> 01:23:02,960
- Good night, Mitch.
- Good night, Murphy.

850
01:23:04,534 --> 01:23:06,661
Good night, Sally.

851
01:23:06,736 --> 01:23:09,000
Good night, Lacey.

852
01:23:09,072 --> 01:23:11,336
Good night, Fred.

853
01:23:11,407 --> 01:23:13,642
Good night, Eliot.
