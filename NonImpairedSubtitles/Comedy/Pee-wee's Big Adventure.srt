1
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,201
Look out, Mr. Potato Head!

2
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:08,887
Good morning, Speck!

3
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,722
Me, too. Come on.
Let's get some breakfast.

4
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:20,325
Mad dog!

5
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:00,292
Good morning, Pee-wee.

6
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:02,753
Good morning, Mr. Breakfast.

7
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:06,230
Can I have my "Mr. T" cereal?

8
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:12,504
I pity the poor fool
who don't eat my cereal!

9
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:44,438
Here, Speck.

10
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:47,807
Welp, I'm off.

11
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:49,803
You be good.

12
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:10,393
Good morning, Mr. Crabtree.

13
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:11,893
Good morning, Pee-wee.

14
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,964
I'm going to water my lawn.

15
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:17,396
Good morning. I'm here.

16
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:45,417
You're the best bike in the whole world.

17
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:58,496
Brush-brush-brush.
Brush-brush-brush.

18
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:32,170
Good morning, Pee-wee.

19
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,598
Hello, Francis.

20
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:37,802
Today is my birthday. My father said
I can have anything I want.

21
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:39,612
Good for you and your father.

22
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:41,213
Guess what I want?

23
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,512
A new brain?

24
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:45,248
No. Your bike.

25
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:52,055
What's so funny, Pee-wee?

26
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:56,430
It's not for sale, Francis.

27
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,800
My father says, "Everything
is negotiable," Pee-wee.

28
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:03,865
I wouldn't sell my bike for anything.

29
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:07,406
Not for a hundred, billion,
million, trillion dollars.

30
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:10,133
-You're crazy.
-I know you are, but what am I?

31
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:12,711
-You're a nerd.
-I know you are, but what am I?

32
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:14,872
-You're an idiot.
-I know you are, but what am I?

33
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:16,644
I know you are, but what am I?

34
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:18,343
I know you are, but what am I?

35
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:21,047
I know you are, but what am I?

36
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:23,248
-I know you are, but what am I?
-Infinity!

37
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:25,019
-I'm not, you are.
-You are.

38
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:26,588
-No way!
-No way!

39
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:27,958
-Knock it off!
-Knock it off!

40
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,326
-Cut it out!
-Cut it out!

41
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,592
-Shut up!
-Make me.

42
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:32,764
Why don't you make me?

43
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:35,993
Because I don't make monkeys,
I just train them.

44
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:38,166
Pee-wee, listen to reason.

45
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:42,040
I'm listening to reason.

46
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,839
That's my name, don't wear it out.

47
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:46,845
Remember when I first saw your bike?

48
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:51,345
You rode past my house, and I ran out
to tell you how much I liked it.

49
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:53,351
I love that story.

50
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:01,053
You'll be sorry, Pee-wee Herman.

51
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,026
I meant to do that.

52
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:43,721
My good friend, Pee-wee!

53
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:45,355
Hi, Mario.

54
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:47,521
Are you just browsing today?

55
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:50,853
Sort of. I wanted to stock up
on some supplies.

56
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:52,529
Help yourself.

57
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,736
How do you like school?

58
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:01,367
Closed.

59
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,877
What?

60
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:29,392
I got some new items
you might be interested in.

61
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:43,281
Box for Pee-wee.

62
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,086
New, improved, squirting flower.

63
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,415
Fake blood, or is it?

64
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,420
Super stink-bomb?

65
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:55,927
Have some.

66
00:15:56,297 --> 00:15:57,423
Shrunken head?

67
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,099
Regular size?

68
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:10,107
Trick gum?

69
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,105
Headlight glasses?

70
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:20,819
And direct from Australia,
The Boomerang Bow-Tie!

71
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:22,887
Come in red?

72
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,137
I'll be right back.

73
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:56,084
-What's up, man?
-How's it going?

74
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,414
Is Dottie still working on your bike?

75
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:00,650
No, I've got it back already.

76
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:02,351
What's she doing to it?

77
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,493
I can't talk about it.
James Bond kind of stuff.

78
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:09,492
Dottie's radical with bikes.

79
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:12,996
I say we cruise, dudes.

80
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:14,999
It's getting hot in here.

81
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,667
It's steamy.

82
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,437
I'm sweating.

83
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,013
Is my horn ready yet?

84
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:26,177
It's ready. It should be
loud enough for you now.

85
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:28,512
Where is it? Let's hear it.

86
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,355
Wait. I want to talk to you first.

87
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:37,189
You are talking to me.

88
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:39,555
No, I want your undivided attention.

89
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:43,696
This is important.
I want to ask you something.

90
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:51,044
I want to know,
if you will do something?

91
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,376
What?

92
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:57,581
I want to know if you'll
go someplace with me.

93
00:17:57,885 --> 00:17:59,580
Like where?

94
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:02,714
The drive-in.

95
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,923
Look, Dottie, I like you.

96
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,959
Like! I like you.

97
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:10,721
I like you, too.

98
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:15,228
There are a lot of things about me
you don't know anything about.

99
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:19,595
Things you wouldn't understand,
you couldn't understand.

100
00:18:19,907 --> 00:18:22,740
Things you shouldn't understand.

101
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,407
I don't understand.

102
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:28,337
You don't want to get mixed up with me.

103
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:31,914
I'm a Ioner, Dottie. A rebel.

104
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:37,920
So long, Dot.

105
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:36,574
Are you the owner?

106
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:40,309
Yes. That's me. They call me Chuck.

107
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:42,252
Can I do anything?

108
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:44,250
We're losing time!

109
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:47,685
Set up a dragnet!
Comb the whole area! Hurry!

110
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:52,263
I'm afraid we can't consider your bike
being stolen a police emergency.

111
00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:55,699
If it doesn't turn up, come to
the station and fill out a report.

112
00:19:56,003 --> 00:19:58,494
That's the best we can do.
Come on, let's go.

113
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,506
Where are you going?

114
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:05,505
To find my bike!

115
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:30,527
Why exactly do you believe
the Soviets were involved?

116
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:37,030
Let me be honest. Hundreds of bikes
are stolen every month.

117
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:40,863
Very few of them are recovered.
We don't have the resources.

118
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,574
You're saying you can't do anything.

119
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:46,036
My bike means everything to me.

120
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:48,644
I knew the police wouldn't help.

121
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,040
You know what I'd do?

122
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:54,543
Retrace my steps.

123
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:57,790
I parked my bike and
when I came back it was gone.

124
00:21:58,225 --> 00:22:01,058
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to take it?

125
00:22:01,395 --> 00:22:03,226
Everyone wanted my bike.

126
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:08,398
This morning, before it was stolen,
Francis offer... Francis!

127
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:31,083
I want to see Francis.

128
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:32,347
He's busy.

129
00:22:32,592 --> 00:22:33,650
Busy, doing what?

130
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,225
He's having his bath.

131
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:38,027
Where are they hosing him down?

132
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:46,361
Me again!

133
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,781
Fire!

134
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:33,917
Still want to buy my bike?

135
00:23:34,054 --> 00:23:37,046
I don't want that relic.
I can have any bike in the world.

136
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:40,323
You don't want it because you have it!

137
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:44,160
Tell me where it is before I lose
patience with you.

138
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:49,059
Help, Dad!

139
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:54,831
Go on and scream! We're miles
from where anyone can hear you!

140
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:03,505
Are you all right?

141
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,022
What's going on in there?

142
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,692
I wouldn't sell it to you,
so you stole it!

143
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:18,020
I swear it wasn't me!

144
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:20,595
Francis, we're breaking the door down!

145
00:24:37,384 --> 00:24:41,047
What is going on?
Have you lost your mind?!

146
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:43,654
-He's a thief! He stole my bike!
-You liar!

147
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:45,384
I swear I didn't do it.

148
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:47,693
That's a serious accusation.

149
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:49,721
Do you have any proof?

150
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:52,222
Not exactly.

151
00:24:52,432 --> 00:24:55,162
Pee-wee, the Buxtons are not thieves.

152
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:58,132
Just look at him.

153
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:00,873
He couldn't have stolen your bike.

154
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:03,705
We set up his birthday
train-set all day.

155
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:07,412
I guess I was wrong.

156
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:11,239
We don't have to involve
the authorities, do we?

157
00:25:12,486 --> 00:25:15,853
It was a simple mistake
and I'm really sorry.

158
00:25:17,924 --> 00:25:20,916
I think that you owe Francis an apology.

159
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:23,760
And then I want you two to shake hands.

160
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:26,759
I'm sorry, Francis.

161
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:30,930
Here. Would you care for some gum?

162
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:34,930
Would you care for some?

163
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:37,776
Spearmint or fruit?

164
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,102
Fruit, please.

165
00:25:40,113 --> 00:25:42,104
Well, good-bye.

166
00:25:44,284 --> 00:25:46,275
You do believe me, don't you, Dad?

167
00:25:56,296 --> 00:25:58,696
How are you ever going
to pay a reward like that?

168
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,697
It's simple.

169
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,291
Whoever returns the bike is obviously
the person who stole it.

170
00:26:03,637 --> 00:26:06,105
So they don't deserve any reward!

171
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,141
Where are we going now?

172
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:17,313
On the air!

173
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:24,116
That was some story.
And with the reward you've offered...

174
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,988
...I'm sure our listeners
will be out looking.

175
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,654
My name's engraved
on the back of the seat.

176
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:33,165
That's Pee-wee Herman.
P-E-E...

177
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:35,858
That does it.

178
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:37,594
He just won't let up.

179
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:41,000
I changed my mind.
I don't want the bike anymore.

180
00:26:41,341 --> 00:26:42,501
A deal's a deal.

181
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:46,906
So fork over my money
for lifting it for you, Buxton!

182
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:51,339
Here. Take the bike with you.
Just get rid of it!

183
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:53,676
That'll cost you extra.

184
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:56,178
See you later, sucker!

185
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:22,879
Good! We can finally
start the big meeting.

186
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:25,150
Dottie, Chuck.

187
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,876
Let's begin, shall we?

188
00:27:28,888 --> 00:27:29,650
Shall we?!

189
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:38,563
This box contains over
217 bits and pieces of information.

190
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:40,723
Evidence.

191
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:45,268
Exhibit "A"!
A photograph of the victims.

192
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:48,563
My bike and me.

193
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:51,066
Exhibit "B"!

194
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:56,242
Another photograph!
What's missing from this picture?

195
00:27:56,583 --> 00:28:00,417
It's just me. Without my bike!

196
00:28:01,755 --> 00:28:04,417
Is this something you can share
with the rest of us?

197
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,423
Exhibit "C".
The horn I was picking up...

198
00:28:10,764 --> 00:28:11,924
...at Chuck's...

199
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,930
...Bike-O-Rama...

200
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:17,261
...when my bike was actually stolen.

201
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,143
Exhibit "D"! Jimmy!

202
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:26,336
What is this?

203
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:28,103
Too late! Chip!

204
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:29,270
It looks like a pen.

205
00:28:29,382 --> 00:28:33,682
Exactly! I bought this pen one hour
before my bike was stolen.

206
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:37,980
Why? What's the significance?
I don't know!

207
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:43,122
Exhibit "Q"!

208
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,394
A scale model of the entire mall!

209
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:49,792
"X" marks the scene of the crime.

210
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:53,970
These arrows mark the sun's position
at the hour of the crime!

211
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,301
Jupiter was aligned with Pluto!

212
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:58,203
The moon was in the Seventh...

213
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:02,481
Please save your questions
until I'm through!

214
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:03,876
Well, when will that be?

215
00:29:04,317 --> 00:29:05,978
A long time, we wait.

216
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,254
We've been here over three hours.

217
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:12,656
I'm not sure if any of us can see
what this is supposed to mean!

218
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:16,089
Supposed to mean? Supposed to mean?!

219
00:29:18,198 --> 00:29:21,827
I think everyone here knows
what this is supposed to mean.

220
00:29:22,502 --> 00:29:26,165
When you've gone over something
again and again...

221
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:28,497
...and again and again...

222
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:30,173
...like I have...

223
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,243
...certain questions get answered.
Others spring up!

224
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,274
The mind plays tricks on you.
You play tricks back!

225
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:39,341
It's like you're unraveling
a cable-knit sweater...

226
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:41,677
...that someone keeps knitting...

227
00:29:41,755 --> 00:29:44,223
...and knitting and knitting...

228
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,624
...and knitting and knitting
and knitting!

229
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:52,694
Let's go get some fresh air.

230
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:55,700
Because it's hot in here.

231
00:29:55,935 --> 00:30:00,429
Hot?! Who's hot? Feels just fine
to me! I feel just perfect.

232
00:30:01,741 --> 00:30:05,142
I can't remember when
I've felt so cozy down here.

233
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:09,539
I can get Chuck to give you a good break
on another bike in the shop.

234
00:30:09,716 --> 00:30:11,877
I don't want another bike!

235
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:15,320
Pee-wee, listen,
if you want my help...

236
00:30:15,421 --> 00:30:16,649
I don't want your help!

237
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:19,587
I don't need the police
and I don't need you!

238
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:21,553
I don't need anybody!

239
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:50,753
You're new to this turf.
We don't like strangers!

240
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,291
Cash only.

241
00:31:28,628 --> 00:31:30,118
No cards, no checks.

242
00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:31,293
You got cash?

243
00:31:35,668 --> 00:31:37,295
Let me take your jacket.

244
00:31:38,404 --> 00:31:42,135
You want to wear a wet jacket,
it's all right with Madam Ruby.

245
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:49,975
For $20 I can tell you a lot of things.
For $30 I can tell you more.

246
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:53,308
And for $50 I can tell you everything.

247
00:31:53,653 --> 00:31:55,052
Tell me why I'm here.

248
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:58,313
You're here because you...

249
00:31:59,492 --> 00:32:00,982
...want something.

250
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:11,500
Let's see...

251
00:32:12,405 --> 00:32:14,669
...what Madam Ruby sees.

252
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:22,009
I see...

253
00:32:22,348 --> 00:32:23,508
...a bicycle.

254
00:32:23,783 --> 00:32:26,274
Yes! Is it okay?

255
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,816
It's okay.

256
00:32:28,855 --> 00:32:31,016
Where is it?! Can you see it?
Where is it?!

257
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,353
Where is it?

258
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:38,795
It's somewhere else.
Somewhere far away.

259
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:40,096
Where?!

260
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:51,101
The Alamo.

261
00:32:54,547 --> 00:32:56,037
The Alamo.

262
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,549
In the basement.

263
00:33:04,924 --> 00:33:06,448
I'll never forget you.

264
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:11,290
Thanks a million.
I've been trying all day.

265
00:34:19,232 --> 00:34:21,462
-The name's Mickey.
-I'm Pee-wee.

266
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,139
How about some music?

267
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,244
Morelli is armed and dangerous...

268
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,978
Forget the music.

269
00:34:35,515 --> 00:34:37,142
Let's enjoy the scenery.

270
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,922
What did you do?

271
00:34:50,897 --> 00:34:53,161
I lost my temper, took a knife
and I...

272
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:59,995
You know those "Do not remove under
penalty of law" labels on mattresses?

273
00:35:01,507 --> 00:35:03,498
I cut one off.

274
00:35:06,512 --> 00:35:08,673
I got a real bad temper.

275
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,681
I always thought that was a dumb law.

276
00:35:11,951 --> 00:35:13,009
You said a mouthful.

277
00:35:14,587 --> 00:35:16,350
Life can be so unfair.

278
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,388
You're telling me?!

279
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:13,409
I tried to go through legal channels.
But the cops, hah!

280
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,906
They were no help.
They gave me the runaround.

281
00:36:18,117 --> 00:36:21,245
That's when I decided to take
the law into my own hands.

282
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,585
The law...

283
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:24,920
The law.

284
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:26,418
The law.

285
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,386
The law!

286
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:31,560
This is it.

287
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:34,932
I got an idea!

288
00:36:45,111 --> 00:36:46,271
What's going on?

289
00:36:46,612 --> 00:36:48,773
We're looking for an escaped convict.

290
00:36:49,115 --> 00:36:52,778
We heard about it on the radio.
Right, honey?

291
00:36:53,853 --> 00:36:55,047
Have you seen this man?

292
00:36:57,623 --> 00:36:59,955
I've seen better heads on boils!

293
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,958
No, I'm sure I'd remember this face.

294
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:11,795
-Would you mind stepping out of the car.
-No, not at all, officer.

295
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:14,837
-Some sort of problem?
-Not at all.

296
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:17,807
I wanted to look at
that cute outfit you have on.

297
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:24,975
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

298
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:37,492
You have a nice day.

299
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:20,303
What's it like in the big house, Mickey?

300
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:23,366
It's not so bad.

301
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:27,711
You get to lift weights,
watch TV, write up appeals...

302
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:30,709
...take long showers, lift weights.

303
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,042
You get used to it.

304
00:39:42,722 --> 00:39:43,620
Out!

305
00:39:44,023 --> 00:39:45,217
Out!

306
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,021
It wasn't my fault.

307
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:51,457
Look kid, I like you. I like you a lot.

308
00:39:51,797 --> 00:39:53,788
That's why I can't drag you into this.

309
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:57,466
I'm bad. You don't get mixed up
with a guy like me.

310
00:39:57,803 --> 00:39:59,828
I'm a Ioner. A rebel!

311
00:40:01,374 --> 00:40:02,636
Déjà vu.

312
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:04,843
See you in the Promised Land.

313
00:40:05,077 --> 00:40:06,874
Arrivederci, baby!

314
00:40:12,218 --> 00:40:13,185
Wait!

315
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:18,646
I'm in the middle of nowhere!

316
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:26,320
Sure is spooky out here.

317
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:43,178
Probably just a dog.

318
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:55,355
Kitty.

319
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,534
Where's those headlight glasses?

320
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,404
Thanks for stopping.

321
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:52,580
Some night, huh?

322
00:41:52,852 --> 00:41:55,184
On this very night...

323
00:41:55,588 --> 00:41:57,749
...ten years ago...

324
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,652
...on this the same stretch of road...

325
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,593
...in a dense fog just like this...

326
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:09,924
...I saw the worst accident I ever seen.

327
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,933
There was this sound...

328
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,330
...like a garbage truck...

329
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,933
...dropped off
the Empire State Building.

330
00:42:25,885 --> 00:42:29,787
And when they finally pulled
the driver's body...

331
00:42:30,456 --> 00:42:34,449
...from the twisted, burning wreck...

332
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,789
...it looked like this!

333
00:42:43,903 --> 00:42:46,565
That was the worst accident...

334
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:49,300
...I ever seen.

335
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:53,403
I get off right up here.

336
00:43:02,087 --> 00:43:03,418
Have a nice day.

337
00:43:04,356 --> 00:43:07,917
Be sure and tell them.
Large Marge sent you.

338
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:50,128
Large Marge sent me.

339
00:43:57,142 --> 00:43:58,541
Did you say Large Marge?

340
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:01,635
She just dropped me off.

341
00:44:02,147 --> 00:44:03,614
That's impossible.

342
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,809
Large Marge, she's...

343
00:44:10,556 --> 00:44:12,547
It was ten years ago...

344
00:44:12,992 --> 00:44:16,155
...on a night just like tonight.

345
00:44:20,766 --> 00:44:22,495
Tonight's the anniversary.

346
00:44:24,837 --> 00:44:27,829
Worst accident I ever seen.

347
00:44:29,008 --> 00:44:32,341
But that means the Large Marge
I was riding with was...

348
00:44:32,678 --> 00:44:34,339
...her ghost.

349
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,362
Don't you mind them.
They're just superstitious.

350
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,484
My wallet's gone!

351
00:45:30,903 --> 00:45:34,395
I think you've worked off
that tuna platter and milk shake.

352
00:45:41,847 --> 00:45:43,906
And here's something extra.

353
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:45,373
Thanks, Simone.

354
00:45:48,921 --> 00:45:51,412
That old highway's a-calling.

355
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,763
I got to move on.

356
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,601
I beg your pardon?

357
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:15,444
I said I always have trouble
with good-byes.

358
00:46:16,014 --> 00:46:18,005
The French say, Au revoir.

359
00:46:19,017 --> 00:46:20,109
Au revoir.

360
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:27,787
Before you go will you come
and watch the sunrise with me?

361
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,625
Please?

362
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:14,662
Do you have any dreams?

363
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:18,670
I'm all alone.

364
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,975
I'm rolling a big doughnut
and a snake wearing a vest...

365
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,844
No, not that kind of dream.

366
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:28,518
I mean a dream you dream about
all the time...

367
00:47:28,854 --> 00:47:31,687
...and it keeps you going,
dreaming about it...

368
00:47:31,924 --> 00:47:34,222
...hoping it will come true.

369
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:37,356
Do you ever have a dream like that?

370
00:47:39,097 --> 00:47:40,689
To find my bike.

371
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:49,033
My dream is to live
in the city of eternal love...

372
00:47:51,877 --> 00:47:53,538
...Paris, France.

373
00:47:53,879 --> 00:47:55,540
You'll get there, Simone.

374
00:47:55,881 --> 00:47:57,542
I don't know.

375
00:47:58,383 --> 00:48:00,374
Why not? What's stopping you?

376
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,380
Andy, for one.

377
00:48:03,121 --> 00:48:05,385
-Who's Andy?
-My boyfriend.

378
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:07,885
He's real jealous.

379
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,551
He flunked French in high school...

380
00:48:10,896 --> 00:48:15,230
...and thinks that everything there
is set up to make him look dumb.

381
00:48:16,068 --> 00:48:19,401
I bet if he knew how important
it is to you, he'd change his mind.

382
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:23,899
Simone, this is your dream.
You have to follow it.

383
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:26,074
I know you're right, but...

384
00:48:26,578 --> 00:48:28,239
But what?

385
00:48:28,914 --> 00:48:31,747
Everyone I know has a big "but."

386
00:48:33,752 --> 00:48:37,085
Come on, Simone.
Let's talk about your big "but."

387
00:48:40,259 --> 00:48:42,090
I don't know.

388
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:47,095
You can't just wish and hope
for something to come true.

389
00:48:47,432 --> 00:48:49,263
You have to make it happen.

390
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:01,442
I've been waiting for somebody
to put it to me like that for so long.

391
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:10,569
Stop!

392
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:12,401
Stop!

393
00:51:15,914 --> 00:51:17,245
Morning.

394
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,580
Care for a sardine?

395
00:51:19,918 --> 00:51:21,249
No, thank you.

396
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,251
Imported.

397
00:51:27,592 --> 00:51:29,150
Name's Jack.

398
00:51:33,598 --> 00:51:35,589
"She'll be wearing pink pajamas.

399
00:51:37,602 --> 00:51:41,265
"She'll be wearing pink pajamas
when she comes.

400
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,442
"We'll all go out to meet her
when she comes."

401
00:51:56,121 --> 00:51:59,454
"It rained all night the day I left,
The weather, it was dry.

402
00:51:59,558 --> 00:52:03,085
"The sun so hot I froze to death,
Susannah, don't you cry."

403
00:52:03,295 --> 00:52:06,992
"Flies in the buttermilk,
Shoo, fly, shoo.

404
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,664
"Skip to my Lou, my darling."

405
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,164
"Jimmy crack corn, and I don't care."

406
00:52:47,806 --> 00:52:52,368
Welcome to the San Antonio Department
of Parks and Recreation Alamo tour.

407
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:54,472
My name is Tina.

408
00:52:54,779 --> 00:52:57,009
Excuse me Tina,
but could we go straight...

409
00:52:57,315 --> 00:53:00,546
Let's hold all questions
until the end of the tour.

410
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,948
Thank you.

411
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:07,552
This Mission, the Alamo, named from
the Spanish word for cottonwood tree...

412
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:10,727
...was established in the year 1718.

413
00:53:11,129 --> 00:53:15,725
The same year that our city was founded
by the Spanish expeditionary force...

414
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:18,902
...on the site of
an Indian burial mound.

415
00:53:19,204 --> 00:53:22,230
This is one of my favorite parts
of the tour.

416
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:26,504
Please say hello to our residents,
Pedro and his wife, Inez.

417
00:53:26,878 --> 00:53:30,143
Inez is holding a clay pot
that she seems very proud of.

418
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:34,145
She carefully detailed it
with paint and glaze.

419
00:53:35,053 --> 00:53:37,419
And Pedro is working on an "adobe."

420
00:53:37,656 --> 00:53:40,648
Can you say that with me? Adobe.

421
00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:46,926
We are now in the kitchen
of the Alamo women.

422
00:53:47,332 --> 00:53:50,824
Here they are preparing
culinary delights of the Southwest.

423
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:53,160
Do I hear someone's stomach growling?

424
00:53:55,507 --> 00:53:58,169
The mainstay of the Alamo diet is corn.

425
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,501
Corn can be prepared many ways.

426
00:54:00,845 --> 00:54:04,008
It can be boiled, shucked,
creamed...

427
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,113
...or in this case dried.

428
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:08,742
Corn can also be used to make...

429
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:10,115
...tortillas.

430
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,857
Do we have any Mexican-Americans
with us today?

431
00:54:18,597 --> 00:54:21,862
There are thousands and thousands
of uses for corn...

432
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,862
...all of which I will
tell you about right now.

433
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,861
Upon this battlement, in 1836...

434
00:54:28,206 --> 00:54:29,867
...two hundred Texas volunteers...

435
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:34,372
...including such heroes as
Davy Crockett, Bill Travis, Jim Bowie...

436
00:54:34,713 --> 00:54:37,876
...fought off an onslaught
of 4,000 Mexicans...

437
00:54:38,049 --> 00:54:41,883
...under the command of
General Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana.

438
00:54:44,022 --> 00:54:46,252
At this time, I'd like
to conclude our tour.

439
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:50,452
You all have been one of the greatest
groups I have ever worked with.

440
00:54:51,229 --> 00:54:53,060
Are there any questions?

441
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,894
Where's the basement?

442
00:54:57,235 --> 00:54:59,066
Aren't we going to see the basement?

443
00:55:00,238 --> 00:55:02,570
There's no basement at the Alamo.

444
00:55:50,955 --> 00:55:53,480
Pee-wee, I'm on my way to Paris.

445
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:56,783
Andy and I had a fight after you left.

446
00:55:57,128 --> 00:55:58,686
You were right, Pee-wee.

447
00:55:58,763 --> 00:56:00,993
I'm making my wish come true.

448
00:56:01,466 --> 00:56:03,957
I'm off to Paris!

449
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,467
What's wrong?

450
00:56:08,707 --> 00:56:11,733
Bus 91, leaving for New York City,
now departing.

451
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:13,471
That's my bus.

452
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,374
Come on.

453
00:56:16,848 --> 00:56:20,477
Guess what. The Alamo was built
without a basement.

454
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:22,150
I didn't know that.

455
00:56:22,287 --> 00:56:25,814
Neither did I. They don't tell you
that stuff in school.

456
00:56:26,157 --> 00:56:28,990
It's something you
just have to experience.

457
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:35,163
Don't worry, Pee-wee.
I know you'll find your bike.

458
00:56:48,513 --> 00:56:52,040
Good luck. I just know
you're going to find your bike.

459
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:19,040
Hello, Dottie? It's me, Pee-wee.

460
00:57:19,711 --> 00:57:21,042
Where are you calling from?

461
00:57:21,379 --> 00:57:22,710
Texas.

462
00:57:23,615 --> 00:57:25,708
Honest. Listen, I'll prove it.

463
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:29,878
"The stars at night
Are big and bright...

464
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:33,380
"Deep in the heart of Texas."

465
00:57:34,058 --> 00:57:36,618
Wait. Don't hang up.
There's something...

466
00:57:36,694 --> 00:57:38,889
...I have to talk to you about.

467
00:57:39,964 --> 00:57:41,727
It's about the other night.

468
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:46,835
I owe everybody a big apology.
Especially you.

469
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:51,402
I didn't mean what I said, Dottie.
Honest.

470
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:53,370
I know you didn't.

471
00:57:53,545 --> 00:57:56,013
There's somebody else
who's been worried about you.

472
00:58:02,587 --> 00:58:04,487
I know.

473
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:06,482
I forgot.

474
00:58:09,093 --> 00:58:10,424
All right, Speck!

475
00:58:13,097 --> 00:58:15,930
All right, Speck! Put Dottie back on.

476
00:58:20,939 --> 00:58:23,100
There's something I want to say.

477
00:58:24,843 --> 00:58:27,778
I've learned something
out here on the road.

478
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:29,442
Humility.

479
00:58:32,617 --> 00:58:36,781
Dottie, when I get back,
will you...

480
00:58:37,355 --> 00:58:38,287
What, Pee-wee?

481
00:58:40,158 --> 00:58:41,955
Will you still help me find my bike?

482
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,121
All right.

483
00:58:46,865 --> 00:58:49,299
There's something else
I wanted to ask you about.

484
00:58:49,868 --> 00:58:50,800
What is it?

485
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:55,469
Could you wire me a bus ticket?
I'll pay you back. Honest.

486
00:58:55,807 --> 00:58:57,672
All right, Pee-wee.

487
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,802
When you get back,
we can settle up at the drive-in.

488
00:59:00,879 --> 00:59:01,937
What?

489
00:59:04,883 --> 00:59:06,908
I couldn't hear that last part.

490
00:59:06,985 --> 00:59:09,385
The connection just got really bad.

491
00:59:09,888 --> 00:59:11,219
Thanks a lot.

492
00:59:19,898 --> 00:59:21,889
You missed it by five minutes.

493
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:42,672
Next up is the local favorite, Number 9,
Lloyd Fletcher, riding Volcano.

494
01:00:43,114 --> 01:00:44,604
That's you.

495
01:00:48,252 --> 01:00:50,720
And away he goes!

496
01:00:56,995 --> 01:00:58,519
It looks like he's going for...

497
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,928
...a new San Antonio record!

498
01:01:05,903 --> 01:01:09,066
He may be going for
a new world's record!

499
01:01:39,537 --> 01:01:43,871
That was some fancy riding.
Let's hope Lloyd is okay.

500
01:01:48,782 --> 01:01:50,113
What's your name?

501
01:01:50,617 --> 01:01:52,608
I can't remember.

502
01:01:53,053 --> 01:01:54,418
Where you from?

503
01:01:55,055 --> 01:01:56,886
I can't remember.

504
01:01:57,023 --> 01:01:58,684
Can't you remember anything?

505
01:01:59,859 --> 01:02:02,350
I remember the Alamo.

506
01:02:34,394 --> 01:02:37,227
I'm sorry, operator. I can't hear you.

507
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,392
I'm trying to use the phone!

508
01:02:56,583 --> 01:03:00,246
Did anybody tell you that this is
the private club of the Satan's Helpers?

509
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,084
Nobody hipped me to that dude.

510
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,481
It's off-limits!

511
01:03:06,426 --> 01:03:08,758
Well, my mistake!

512
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:12,256
Guess I'll be on my way, then.

513
01:03:13,233 --> 01:03:14,097
Excuse me.

514
01:03:17,604 --> 01:03:18,764
Excuse me.

515
01:03:41,428 --> 01:03:42,759
I barely touched them!

516
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:45,962
I say we kill him!

517
01:03:47,133 --> 01:03:49,795
I say we hang him, then we kill him!

518
01:03:50,704 --> 01:03:52,035
I say we stomp him!

519
01:03:53,306 --> 01:03:54,967
Then we tattoo him!

520
01:03:55,709 --> 01:03:57,142
Then we hang him!

521
01:03:57,811 --> 01:03:59,301
And then we kill him!

522
01:04:00,647 --> 01:04:02,979
I say we let him go.

523
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:14,316
I say you let me have him first!

524
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:20,165
Wait! Don't I get a last request?

525
01:04:23,336 --> 01:04:24,667
Why not?

526
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:25,391
Break dance!

527
01:06:03,136 --> 01:06:04,763
Tequila!

528
01:06:18,451 --> 01:06:20,442
Thanks a lot, dudes.

529
01:06:22,422 --> 01:06:24,287
I hope you find your bike.

530
01:08:31,184 --> 01:08:32,173
Now!

531
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:51,093
The customized bicycle was presented
to child star, Kevin Morton...

532
01:08:51,437 --> 01:08:55,271
...at Warner Brothers Studios
in Hollywood, California.

533
01:08:56,142 --> 01:08:57,609
Congratulations, Kevin.

534
01:08:57,944 --> 01:08:59,502
Thanks, Mr. Hawthorne.

535
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:01,843
A bike like this is every boy's dream.

536
01:09:26,739 --> 01:09:28,366
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a pass?

537
01:09:28,641 --> 01:09:30,973
Oh, no, I' sorry you can't
enter without a pass.

538
01:09:33,579 --> 01:09:36,912
So the fellow said, "What do you think
I have down here, a duck?"

539
01:09:43,122 --> 01:09:44,487
A duck!

540
01:10:05,378 --> 01:10:07,505
Where can I find Kevin Morton?

541
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:11,175
I don't know.

542
01:10:11,984 --> 01:10:14,179
Do you know what stage
Kevin Morton is on?

543
01:10:14,987 --> 01:10:16,477
It's stage six.

544
01:10:22,528 --> 01:10:24,189
All right. I want to go once again.

545
01:10:40,012 --> 01:10:42,037
Hair standing by.

546
01:10:46,052 --> 01:10:49,488
What I want to do now,
is I want to do one more, faster paced.

547
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:50,553
All right, Kevin?

548
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,147
You know, I would love to...

549
01:10:52,225 --> 01:10:55,126
...except how can I
when she's so late on her cues?

550
01:10:56,062 --> 01:10:57,552
Just a minute!

551
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:01,964
Please, Marion.

552
01:11:04,137 --> 01:11:06,901
I don't have to take that
from that little...

553
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,231
Kid! He's just a kid.

554
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:12,367
Even a kid can be courteous.
I'm going to quit.

555
01:11:12,912 --> 01:11:15,472
I swear it, I am going to quit!

556
01:11:16,782 --> 01:11:19,307
All right, Jerry. But I have had it!

557
01:11:22,421 --> 01:11:24,514
Well, is everything straightened out?

558
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:25,921
We're ready when you are.

559
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,992
Doesn't it look like I'm ready?!
I am always ready!

560
01:11:29,262 --> 01:11:33,255
I have been ready since first call!
I am ready!

561
01:11:33,799 --> 01:11:34,925
Roll!

562
01:11:35,601 --> 01:11:37,933
Quiet, please! This is a take!

563
01:11:40,673 --> 01:11:41,662
Action!

564
01:11:43,409 --> 01:11:45,104
Good-bye, Mother Superior.

565
01:11:45,378 --> 01:11:48,870
Good-bye, Rusty. And God bless you.

566
01:11:50,016 --> 01:11:54,112
Thank you Mother Superior,
I want the orphanage to have my bike.

567
01:11:54,453 --> 01:11:55,681
No, Rusty.

568
01:11:55,955 --> 01:11:59,618
You sold a lot of magazine subscriptions
to earn that bike.

569
01:11:59,959 --> 01:12:02,291
But I want to give.

570
01:12:02,895 --> 01:12:07,559
I've just received the two best parents
a boy could ever hope for.

571
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,300
Rusty, you are an inspiration to us all.

572
01:12:12,672 --> 01:12:13,866
I'll say.

573
01:12:14,507 --> 01:12:17,670
I'm going to start
a paper route right now.

574
01:12:21,647 --> 01:12:23,239
Stop that nun!

575
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:33,481
Remember me? Let's go!

576
01:15:01,374 --> 01:15:02,864
Merry Christmas!

577
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:23,812
Geronimo!

578
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:34,683
Radical!

579
01:18:05,824 --> 01:18:07,655
You can help me. Come on!

580
01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:09,383
Don't panic!

581
01:18:09,461 --> 01:18:11,452
No pushing, no shoving.

582
01:18:12,665 --> 01:18:16,499
Move in an orderly fashion
to the front exit.

583
01:18:26,345 --> 01:18:27,607
Stay!

584
01:18:27,846 --> 01:18:29,780
Listen up, everybody! Sit!

585
01:18:47,866 --> 01:18:48,662
It's okay.

586
01:19:00,212 --> 01:19:01,304
Go on! Run!

587
01:19:08,721 --> 01:19:11,383
Fast! Come on! Let's go!

588
01:20:01,473 --> 01:20:04,203
Son, are you all right?
Can you hear me?

589
01:20:04,543 --> 01:20:07,034
There's still a few more fish inside.

590
01:20:07,746 --> 01:20:09,043
This boy is a hero.

591
01:20:09,281 --> 01:20:11,272
This boy is under arrest.

592
01:20:28,434 --> 01:20:30,561
I can explain, Mr. Hawthorne.

593
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:32,401
Call me "Terry."

594
01:20:35,607 --> 01:20:38,906
Warner Brothers thinks your story
would make a fantastic movie.

595
01:20:39,178 --> 01:20:41,510
My story. A movie?!

596
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,352
My bike!

597
01:20:57,496 --> 01:20:58,588
Do we have a deal?

598
01:21:32,231 --> 01:21:34,461
Pee-wee, can I have your autograph?

599
01:21:40,472 --> 01:21:42,463
Here's your chili dog.

600
01:21:50,315 --> 01:21:53,648
Pee-wee! Over here. Look! Box seats!

601
01:21:55,854 --> 01:22:00,314
This is Bob, Luke, Skinny and Milton.
Boys, this is Pee-wee!

602
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,718
Sno-cones.

603
01:22:03,162 --> 01:22:05,653
I never met a movie star.

604
01:22:06,999 --> 01:22:08,489
What did they pay you?

605
01:22:10,903 --> 01:22:12,564
Nice to meet you.

606
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:33,415
Let's take a breather, Dottie.

607
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:35,524
The X-1 needs to cool down.

608
01:22:37,529 --> 01:22:39,690
I'm a little overheated myself.

609
01:22:41,633 --> 01:22:43,533
Come over here, P.W.

610
01:23:24,743 --> 01:23:26,574
I must get to a phone.

611
01:23:36,255 --> 01:23:39,315
Great so far, Pee-wee.
Action packed.

612
01:23:39,758 --> 01:23:41,157
One soda.

613
01:23:42,094 --> 01:23:44,756
One foot-Iong!

614
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:53,933
Good try, Pee-wee.

615
01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:08,609
Have you got any message for Room 104?
The name is Herman.

616
01:24:09,521 --> 01:24:11,011
P.W. Herman.

617
01:24:16,962 --> 01:24:19,624
No, nothing right now, Mr. Herman.

618
01:24:22,634 --> 01:24:24,124
I'll be in the bar.

619
01:24:30,309 --> 01:24:32,140
That's fantastic!

620
01:24:43,989 --> 01:24:45,149
Ditto.

621
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,981
I brought you guys French fries!

622
01:24:58,337 --> 01:25:00,669
The big scene's coming up, guys!

623
01:25:10,349 --> 01:25:12,340
Paging Mr. Herman.

624
01:25:12,684 --> 01:25:16,745
Mr. Herman, you have a telephone call
at the front desk.

625
01:25:31,937 --> 01:25:33,529
Yes, I understand.

626
01:25:36,441 --> 01:25:37,931
That was the president.

627
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:39,805
I must steal back the X-1...

628
01:25:39,878 --> 01:25:43,211
...before the Soviets find
the hidden microfilm inside.

629
01:25:43,949 --> 01:25:46,816
The future of the free world
is riding on this.

630
01:25:46,885 --> 01:25:50,377
-I'll go with you.
-No, it's too dangerous.

631
01:25:51,523 --> 01:25:54,390
I invented the X-1.
I'm going with you!

632
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:56,293
All right, let's go.

633
01:25:58,063 --> 01:26:00,554
You are such a pushover.

634
01:26:01,867 --> 01:26:03,391
I know you are...

635
01:26:04,036 --> 01:26:05,469
...but what am I?

636
01:26:15,147 --> 01:26:16,978
Congratulations, Pee-wee!

637
01:26:18,116 --> 01:26:19,743
Hi, P.W.

638
01:26:20,752 --> 01:26:22,083
How's the X-1?

639
01:26:22,421 --> 01:26:25,413
It's cooled down. But I'm heated up.

640
01:26:26,091 --> 01:26:28,423
Where's my candy?

641
01:26:28,927 --> 01:26:30,258
I forgot.

642
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,865
Pee-wee and I go way back.

643
01:26:36,935 --> 01:26:39,426
When did you become blood brothers?

644
01:26:39,771 --> 01:26:41,602
I don't remember the exact year.

645
01:26:41,773 --> 01:26:44,264
And you say you taught Pee-wee
to ride his bike?

646
01:26:44,976 --> 01:26:47,843
I remember the day I took off
his training wheels.

647
01:26:49,714 --> 01:26:51,272
This is the bike.

648
01:26:52,117 --> 01:26:53,948
How about a picture of me on it?

649
01:26:54,186 --> 01:26:55,517
I don't think that's a good idea.

650
01:26:55,854 --> 01:26:58,186
It's not your decision.

651
01:26:58,457 --> 01:27:02,791
If it wasn't for me, none of this
would have happened to you, right?

652
01:27:03,462 --> 01:27:05,123
Well, sort of.

653
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:08,524
Then it's okay if I sit on it.
Right, Pee-wee?

654
01:27:10,969 --> 01:27:13,961
Come on, Pee-wee, everybody's waiting.

655
01:27:20,145 --> 01:27:21,510
Everyone, gather around.

656
01:27:21,613 --> 01:27:24,309
Let me show you some of
the more high-tech features.

657
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,091
You don't want to get mixed up with me.

658
01:27:44,503 --> 01:27:46,971
I'm a Ioner, Dottie. A rebel.

659
01:27:53,512 --> 01:27:55,343
Come on, Dottie. Let's go.

660
01:27:56,281 --> 01:27:58,272
Don't you want to see
the rest of the movie?

661
01:27:58,350 --> 01:28:00,045
I don't have to see it, Dottie.

662
01:28:00,519 --> 01:28:02,248
I lived it.
