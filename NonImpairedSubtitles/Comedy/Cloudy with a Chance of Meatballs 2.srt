1
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:41,193
My name is Flint Lockwood.

2
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:44,969
My whole life I always wanted
to be a great inventor.

3
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:46,890
Just like my hero.

4
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:51,402
The Scientifically
Wonderful World of Science.

5
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:54,026
With your host, Chester V.

6
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:56,265
Welcome back, science friends.

7
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:59,436
You know, I have devoted my life
to inventing the future.

8
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:01,835
But every dream
has a beginning.

9
00:01:01,836 --> 00:01:04,587
I still remember
my first invention:

10
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,700
The humble Food Bar.

11
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,500
Whoa!

12
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,857
It was like Chester V

13
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:12,416
was speaking directly to me
using the language of science.

14
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:13,615
Now look at us.

15
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:17,102
Our new Food Bar XL
with flavor crystals.

16
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:20,290
Still making people happy
after all these years.

17
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:23,375
Now, kids, you'll almost
certainly never be me.

18
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:27,150
But, remember, there's no
such thing as small science.

19
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:28,815
Only small scientists!

20
00:01:28,816 --> 00:01:30,958
We love you, Chester V!

21
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,513
Speaking of small scientists,
say goodbye, Barb.

22
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:36,527
Goodbye, Barb.
Ha, ha, ha!

23
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:40,207
Can your ideas change the world?
Yes.

24
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,511
Just like Chester V,

25
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:45,489
my dream was to make the world
a better place.

26
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,433
Spray-On Shoes! Voila!

27
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:51,098
How you gonna get them off?

28
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,795
<i>Unfortunately, a lot of
people didn't believe in me.</i>

29
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:55,603
<i>But I never gave up.</i>

30
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:57,679
<i>- And eventually,</i>-

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,821
A machine that could turn water

32
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:00,884
into food.

33
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:02,707
<i>Cheeseburger.</i>

34
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,244
It's called the Flint Lockwood
Diatonic Super Mutating

35
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:07,508
Dynamic Food Replicator.

36
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:10,548
The FLDSMDFR.

37
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:12,919
<i>Because of my
invention's food weather,</i>

38
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,355
<i>I finally made the world
a better place.</i>

39
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:16,955
Yeah!

40
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:20,885
I love it!
Or so I thought.

41
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:24,694
When the weather evolved into
a disaster of epic portions,

42
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:26,314
and the machine
started creating

43
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:27,619
dangerous living food

44
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,243
I had to face the truth:

45
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:31,510
It was time to put an end

46
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:32,951
to my FLDSMDFR.

47
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:42,519
Chee... Chee... Chee... Chee...

48
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,560
Cheese.

49
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:53,190
By destroying
my greatest invention,

50
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,674
I made something even better:

51
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,212
Friends!

52
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,890
Wow. Wow.

53
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,292
You made me very proud, son.

54
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:05,238
Unh! Thank you, Dad. Sorry.

55
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:11,760
Sam Sparks, in the eight minutes
since we saved the world,

56
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:13,359
I've had time to reflect.

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,611
And I think you and I
should have a place together.

58
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,733
A place?

59
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,430
A place where we work.

60
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,525
You think we work together?
I do.

61
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:25,373
Awesome!
Yes!

62
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:26,960
We could build a lab.

63
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:28,986
With cool weather
forecasting devices!

64
00:03:28,987 --> 00:03:31,863
We can invent fantastic machines
like the FLDSMDFR.

65
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:32,894
Yeah!

66
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:34,363
But not that one.
No.

67
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:37,279
Not ever.
Never, ever, ever!

68
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,136
What shall we call our lab?

69
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:42,655
Oh! How about Sparkswood?

70
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,570
Ooh! Sparkswood.

71
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:47,573
Sparkswood is gonna need
some security.

72
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:49,698
And I can be your mascot!

73
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,925
And I can be your dad.

74
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,925
There are many ways
in which I can help.

75
00:03:52,926 --> 00:03:55,534
Ho, ho! Can't forget you,
lab partner.

76
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,579
Steve!

77
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,460
Where'd he get
the brown crayon?

78
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:02,465
This could be our future.

79
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:05,870
Oh, yeah! Ha, ha!

80
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,643
Greetings, friends.

81
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:25,765
And namaste.

82
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,389
Whoa. Is that...?
Chester V?

83
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,637
Mustache.

84
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:32,006
Please have
some humanitarian aid

85
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:34,374
as a gesture of our goodwill.

86
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,167
Chester V! Whoa!

87
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:38,438
Your lab vest looks
even cooler in person!

88
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,952
Thank you. The lack of sleeves
frees up my arms to do this.

89
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:44,455
Whoa!

90
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:46,537
Ah! Hand,
what did you do?

91
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:49,742
There's nothing wrong
with your hand, young Lockwood.

92
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:54,120
You see, I am merely a hologram
of the real Chester V.

93
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:57,374
The United Nations has asked
me and my Thinkquanauts

94
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,954
to assist in the cleanup
and containment

95
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:02,085
of the leftovers
all over the world.

96
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:06,218
Including your Swallow Falls.

97
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:08,188
We'll get started
on the cleanup

98
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:09,515
right away.

99
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:11,498
As soon as you all leave.

100
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:13,412
What?
You need us to leave?

101
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,615
Listen up, ghost man,

102
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,745
you expect us to skedaddle
from our homes

103
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:18,550
because of some nasty
leftovers?

104
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,164
Yes. Yes, I do.

105
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:23,959
Son, you can't argue
with yellow police tape.

106
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,487
Everybody back up!
Listen to ghost man.

107
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:27,886
But do not fret.

108
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:31,535
All of you will be
temporarily relocated

109
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:35,024
to sunny San Franjose,

110
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,718
California!

111
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,289
The home of Live Corp!
The home of Live Corp!

112
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,168
On my word as a hologram,

113
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,977
you shall all return home
before you know it.

114
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:47,180
Except for you, Flint Lockwood.

115
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,144
Me? Why?

116
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,057
Oh, heh, heh.
You are going...

117
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,336
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
Where am I going?

118
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:53,712
Oh, please tell me!

119
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:56,651
Just give it a second.
He's buffering.

120
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:59,367
You are going to join me
at Live Corp

121
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:02,504
and help us make the world
a better place.

122
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:05,928
Sir, that's all
I've ever wanted.

123
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,719
But I can't.

124
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,623
On account of making
a promise two minutes ago

125
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:13,192
to build a lab
with my friends, sir.

126
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:15,914
I understand, Lockwood.

127
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:18,793
But if you become
a Thinkquanaut like me,

128
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:21,196
then all your dreams
will come true.

129
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:22,762
You have to do this!

130
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:24,809
What about our dream?

131
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,148
Flint, this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

132
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:31,051
We're all behind you.

133
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:32,939
Are you guys sure?

134
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,731
Sure.

135
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:41,248
This is the best day ever!

136
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,885
Sir, I've taken care
of everything.

137
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,331
The locals have been evacuated.

138
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:50,830
Splendid. And the inventor?

139
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:53,004
Oh, he took the job.
Outstanding!

140
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:54,643
Now we can keep an eye on him.

141
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:57,838
He has no idea
of our real plan.

142
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,287
Contact me as soon as Operation
Capture the Invention succeeds.

143
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,657
Live Corp.

144
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:14,514
Cheeseburger.

145
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:31,871
Oh, big day, big day!
Big day, big day,

146
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:33,427
big day! Yes!

147
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:35,700
Wake up, Steve!
Steve.

148
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:39,636
Do I look
like a future Thinkquanaut?

149
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:42,039
Morning there, skipper.
You want a sardine scramble?

150
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,818
No, thanks! Can't be late!

151
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,402
Flint! Ask that Chester V when
he thinks we can go home again.

152
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:51,285
Morning, Sam!

153
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:54,223
Morning, Flint! Are you ready
for your first day?

154
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,150
Yeah! Are you?

155
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:57,186
Whoa!

156
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:58,420
Sam?

157
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:02,902
Well, this is me. Good luck
with your new jobs, guys.

158
00:08:02,903 --> 00:08:03,709
Good luck, Flint!

159
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,609
Break a leg, Flint!

160
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,571
Bye!

161
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:06,519
Adios.

168
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,974
Wow!

169
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,316
Good morning, Flint Lockwood
and lab partner.

170
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,704
I'm Barb.

171
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:41,172
Eeh! I know, I'm a huge fan.

172
00:08:41,173 --> 00:08:42,154
Monkey.

173
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,164
Excuse me,

174
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:47,103
I'm an ape. One of Chester V's
most brilliant innovations.

175
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:49,661
An orangutan with a human brain

176
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,157
within my ape brain.

177
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:53,566
Like a turducken.

178
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,370
I'll be your welcome ambassador.
Soy latte?

179
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:58,494
Okay.

180
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,830
Coffee and milk?

181
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:04,958
Are you ready to live?

182
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,775
Oh, am I!

183
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:09,044
Monkey.

184
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:10,512
Ape. Follow me, boys.

185
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:16,000
Welcome to Live Corp.

186
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,803
Wow.

187
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:22,488
There are caffeine stations
every 10 feet.

188
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:23,771
Soy-free soy latte?

189
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,339
Thanks!

190
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:27,682
Hot.

191
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:29,202
Not too bad yourself, monkey.

192
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:31,590
Caffeine patches
are available 24 hours.

193
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:35,265
And our mocha-yoga classes are
offered in beginner or grande.

194
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,839
Over here, indoor sports.
Those are encouraged.

195
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,590
Oh, cool!
I've never played volleyball.

196
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:44,260
Well, neither have they.
You'll fit right in!

197
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:45,963
<i>Can your ideas
change the world?</i>

198
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:48,645
Behold, the motivation pod.

199
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:49,781
<i>Can your ideas...?</i>

200
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:51,205
I know, right?

201
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,741
Quinoa latte?

202
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:54,229
Absolutely! Ha, ha, ha!

203
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,518
<i>Can your ideas
change the world?</i>

204
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,792
Yes, Chester V poster,
they can!

205
00:09:58,793 --> 00:09:59,411
Mine too!

206
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:00,050
So can mine!

207
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:00,871
I have great ideas.

208
00:10:00,872 --> 00:10:04,042
Absolutely!
I've got my idea pants on.

209
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:07,781
Thinkquanauts! Awesome!

210
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:09,351
Hey! Excuse me,

211
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:10,887
I'm so looking forward
to working with you guy...

212
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:13,626
Uh! Aww!

213
00:10:15,305 --> 00:10:17,407
That's where we belong, Steve.

214
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,203
Anxious!

215
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:19,035
Oh, heh, heh.

216
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:22,920
That's not even a possibility
until our next vesting ceremony.

217
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,045
What's that?

218
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:25,297
That's where Chester V

219
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:27,210
handpicks a great inventor

220
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,846
and makes him
into a Thinkquanaut.

221
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:29,800
When? When?

222
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:32,922
Next one's in six months,
so submit your ideas

223
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,944
and who knows?
He might choose you.

224
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:36,427
Really?

225
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,664
Hot chocolate with
double-whipped whipped cream?

226
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:39,589
Thanks.

227
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,573
Happy inventing!

228
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,887
We're gonna have to get used
to that landing.

229
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:04,790
Okay, Steve, we have six months
until the vesting ceremony.

230
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,189
Let's do this thing.

231
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,375
Can.

232
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,229
That's the spirit, Steve!

233
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,783
<i>Say goodbye</i>

234
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:17,552
<i>to ice cubes
with the Re-Freeze-a-Fan!</i>

235
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:21,657
<i>Can your ideas
change the world?</i>

236
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:25,590
The Forkenknifenspooninator!

237
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,010
<i>Can your ideas
change the world?</i>

238
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:30,813
The Grocery Deliverator!

239
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:32,497
Whoa!

240
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:34,929
<i>Can your ideas

241

Invisible coffee table!

242
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:38,262
Ah! Flint.

243
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:42,154
<i>Can your ideas
change the world?</i>

244
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:43,767
Flint!

245
00:11:48,694 --> 00:11:50,389
The Celebrationator!

246
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,299
A party in a box
for any occasion.

247
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,372
Okay, Steve, time to celebrate!

248
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:57,241
Celebrate!

249
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:59,830
Flint!

250
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:01,644
Happy birthday, Tim Lockwood!

251
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:03,567
Here you go, Dad.
Hope you like it.

252
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:04,877
Steve picked it out.

253
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:06,677
Steve!

254
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:19,223
Yeah. Yeah!

255
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:20,548
Okay, like we practiced.

256
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,121
When I'm up on stage
getting my vest,

257
00:12:22,122 --> 00:12:25,007
you hit the red button
when I say "celebrate."

258
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,273
Celebrate!

259
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:27,544
Whoa. Careful, Steve!

260
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:28,780
This is a loaded
party-in-a-box.

261
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,930
Hello, Team Live Corp!

262
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,337
It's a pleasure to welcome you

263
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:38,362
to our annual Thinkquanaut
vesting ceremony!

264
00:12:38,363 --> 00:12:40,332
Whoo! Chester V!
Ha, ha, ha.

265
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:45,289
I have built the coolest,
hippest company in the world.

266
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:47,258
As you all know,

267
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,760
the Food Bar is the lifeblood
of this company.

268
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:51,994
And this year,
I've challenged myself

269
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:53,627
to reinvent taste. Ooh.

270
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:55,772
So in two short weeks,

271
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:58,861
we shall release the new
Live Corp Food Bar!

272
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:02,364
Version 8.0!

273
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,060
Yes!

274
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:05,996
And now, without further ado,

275
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:07,869
who will be this year's

276
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,440
newest Live Corp Thinkquanaut?

277
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,190
Oh, ho, ho! Yeah!

278
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:19,761
We have received thousands
of invention submissions

279
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,913
and today, one of them
will be deemed

280
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:24,672
Thinkquanaut-worthy.

281
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:25,875
Thank you, Barb.

282
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:27,007
Whoo!

283
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:29,344
This person comes
from an island.

284
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:30,336
Ohh. Uh-huh!

285
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:33,409
He's got a memorable mop
of unruly hair.

286
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,695
Hair. Hair!

287
00:13:34,696 --> 00:13:35,979
Ha, ha, ha! That's me!

288
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,946
Our newest Live Corp
Thinkquanaut is:

289
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:41,985
Flint...

290
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,554
Yeah!

291
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:44,723
Ly McCallahan!

292
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:45,825
No.

293
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,586
Crikey blikey! Yes!

294
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:50,051
For inventing
a zero-emission car

295
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,720
that runs on cute.

296
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,844
This is the
greatest day of my life!

297
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:01,401
Didgeridoo!
I'm finally a real inventor!

298
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:05,540
Sorry, Steve.
No reason to celebrate.

299
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,010
Celebrate!

300
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:08,678
Wait, Steve, no, no, no. No!

301
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,870
<i>♪ He's a real baboon ♪</i>

00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:52,810
Hi, Sam, it's Flint.

308
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:57,260
I see you're live on TV
with a tornado.

309
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,230
Probably why you're not
answering the phone.

310
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,645
<i>Thinkquanaut? I think not.</i>

311
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:04,685
Ugh. Please call me back.

312
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:09,091
Okay. Bye!

313
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:18,543
Bad news!
Sir, we lost contact

314
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,326
with Search Teams X and Y.

315
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:20,888
What?

316
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:21,454
Yeah!

317
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,374
The situation is grim, sir.

318
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,486
Still no sign of the FLDSMDFR.

319
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:26,455
Should I send in Team Z?

320
00:15:26,456 --> 00:15:30,096
Are you mad, Barb?
We'll be all out of alphabet.

321
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,233
Look, we're running low
on Thinkquanauts.

322
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:36,400
We need someone expendable.

323
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:39,633
Someone who knows the island
inside and out.

324
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:43,346
Someone who's smart,
but still naive.

325
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,840
Someone who idolizes me,

326
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:48,179
has recently hit rock bottom

327
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,218
and will now do
just about anything I ask.

328
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:55,424
Where are we gonna find
someone so desperate?

329
00:15:57,812 --> 00:16:00,947
I think we already have.

330
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:07,113
Sprinkles!

331
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,005
Fire!

332
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:12,853
Flint, who's number one? Oh.

333
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:14,166
Ta-da!

334
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:20,168
Hey, Flint, I got your message.

335
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:22,325
Oh, no, what happened to you?

336
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:35,448
Flint, everyone gets humiliated
on national television.

337
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:36,652
It's not that big a deal.

338
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:39,384
Yeah, but not everyone
gets humiliated

339
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:42,618
in front of
their childhood hero.

340
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,286
I'll never be a real inventor

341
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,393
in Chester's eyes.

342
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:48,029
Mom gave me this lab coat

343
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,091
because she always dreamed
I'd do great things.

344
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:53,531
Now I guess I won't.

345
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:55,575
Now that's a big bucket
of chum.

346
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:58,310
Flint, you don't need
Chester's approval.

347
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:00,870
You can still make
the world a better place

348
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:02,491
without an orange vest.

349
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:04,187
I don't get vests.

350
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:07,725
Is it winter on your torso
and summer on your arms?

351
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:10,245
For what it's worth,

352
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,175
the people who really
care about you

353
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:15,067
think you look great
in your lab coat.

354
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,238
Good night, Mr. Lockwood.

355
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:17,886
Good night, my dear.

356
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:22,398
Hey, look, son.

357
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:24,765
This Chester V guy.

358
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:28,804
He promised us we'd be home
before we know it. Well,

359
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,906
we darn sure know it
and we're not home.

360
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:36,927
So I say you,
me and your friends,

361
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:39,625
we take the boat.
We can go fishing every day.

362
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,530
And if there's still a mess
on the island,

363
00:17:41,531 --> 00:17:43,041
we can go clean it up
ourselves.

364
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:46,017
Dad, please.
I'm not into fishing.

365
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:50,434
And cleanup? You're way too old
to be doing that kind of work.

366
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:53,027
I'm only 49.

367
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:58,885
Flint Lockwood, please.

368
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:04,547
Oh, Flint. Um...

369
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:08,324
There's, um... Could you
come to the door, please?

370
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:09,992
I think it's that monkey
in your poster.

371
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:12,675
What? No! Ahh!

372
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,212
Barb?

373
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:15,749
Shh.

374
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:18,436
<i>Good day.</i>

375
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:21,073
<i>I'm afraid I have something
very important</i>

376
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:22,822
<i>to discuss with you.</i>

377
00:18:22,823 --> 00:18:24,224
<i>Live Corp.</i>

378
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:27,014
Chester V wants to see me?

379
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:33,350
Follow me.

380
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:36,555
Whoa.

381
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,296
Ah. Young Lockwood.

382
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:46,505
Chester V. Sir.

383
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:48,680
I can explain everything.

384
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:50,617
I thought I was gonna meet
the real Chester V.

385
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:51,785
You are.

386
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:53,769
Oh, not me. Him.

387
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,139
Yes, it's me.

388
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,034
Sorry about that.

389
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:01,419
My holograms and I were having
an urgent brainstorming session.

390
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,418
Aah! Mr. V! You're real!
I'm so excited

391
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:07,388
to get this opportunity
to show you my inventions.

392
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:11,045
Hold on. Hold on. That's not
why I brought you here tonight.

393
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,086
Our cleanup operation
back on Swallow Falls

394
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:17,132
has met with
unexpected complications.

395
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,501
This is a photograph

396
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:21,037
before we began our cleanup.

397
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,808
And this was three days ago.

398
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:27,342
It gets worse, Flint.

399
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:29,746
<i>There's only two of us left.
We need help.</i>

400
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:35,982
What is that thing?

401
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:37,105
Cheesy.

402
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:39,951
It appears to be
a living cheeseburger

403
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:43,440
with french fry legs
and sesame seed eyes.

404
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:45,008
Living food?

405
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:47,746
Oh, no. This could
only mean one thing.

406
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:50,736
The FLDSMDFR
survived the explosion,

407
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:52,978
and it's still operating.

408
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:56,149
This is what worries me most.

409
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,821
They're trying to learn
to swim.

410
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:06,481
If they succeed

411
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:07,970
and get to the mainland,

412
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:11,012
they will destroy monuments
all around the world,

413
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:12,366
including the one monument

414
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,741
your food storm didn't destroy.

415
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:16,083
Not Lady Liberty!

416
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,287
I've gotta destroy the FLDSMDFR.
But how?

417
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:22,101
Well, my Thinkquanauts
have invented this.

418
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:26,102
The BS-USB.
Or BSUSB.

419
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:29,340
A Bifurcating Systematic
Universal Stop Button!

420
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:32,118
Precisely. It would
destroy the machine

421
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,900
and everything it created.

422
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,238
But we cannot find
your FLDSMDFR.

423
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:39,741
We've searched everywhere
and failed.

424
00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:44,077
Chester, I'll find the machine.
I invented it. I can fix this!

425
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,271
Brilliant!

426
00:20:45,272 --> 00:20:48,067
But are you sure you want
to take this on alone?

427
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:49,794
Yes!
Wait, did you say "alone"?

428
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:51,225
Alone it is, then.

429
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:55,738
If you succeed, you'll be more
than just a Thinkquanaut.

430
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:57,081
You'll be my hero.

431
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:58,617
Your hero?

432
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:00,634
Yes, my hero.

433
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,710
Your mission
must be kept a secret.

434
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:05,216
We don't wanna create
a worldwide panic.

435
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:06,405
You mustn't tell anyone,

436
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:08,932
not even your closest friends
and family.

437
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:12,413
Sir, I won't tell a soul.

438
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:13,882
Sam! Sam, Sam, Sam!

439
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,306
I gotta tell you a secret! Sam!

440
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,806
Big news. I'm going to Swallow
Falls to destroy the FLDSMDFR,

441
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:20,603
which is creating
deadly food monsters,

442
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:21,973
which are trying
to learn to swim

443
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:24,421
so they can attack
Lady Liberty!

444
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:26,717
Sam?

445
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,500
Wait, you're doing this alone?

446
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:30,325
Yeah. Please don't tell Dad.

447
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:32,405
If he finds out I'm going back
to Swallow Falls,

448
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:34,364
he's gonna wanna come too.

449
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:35,997
Well, I'm coming.

450
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:39,969
What? No! I promised Chester V
I would go alone.

451
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,627
There's no talking you
out of this?

452
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:44,169
Nope.

453
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:44,735
Wait.

454
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,582
Sam, it's gonna be
deadly dangerous

455
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,916
with a good chance of death.

456
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:49,507
And that's why we'll need help.

457
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:53,057
Triple decaf
mochaccino-boba-latte

458
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:54,479
with skim soy
and nutmeg sprinkle?

459
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,935
I'd like to order
something strong.

460
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:58,843
Wait your turn, fancy pants.

461
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:01,410
Flint Lockwood and Sam Sparks!

462
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:03,202
And Steve too!

463
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:04,188
Juicy!

464
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,172
Earl, we need your help.

465
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:08,561
Swallow Falls is overrun
with deadly food monsters.

466
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:10,339
Hey, where's my coffee?

467
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,668
Coffee? I'm not a barista,
I'm a polista!

468
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:16,482
Let's ride!

469
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:17,986
Can I come too, Dad?

470
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:21,860
Son, you are my beautiful,
precious little angel.

471
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:24,002
But I cannot let you
come with me.

472
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:26,444
Not until you get
your first chest hair.

473
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,291
I have chest hair.

474
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,181
It's just like mine.

475
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,420
Wait a minute.

476
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:34,470
That's not a chest hair.

477
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,697
That's cupcake frosting.

478
00:22:35,698 --> 00:22:38,358
Tell your mom
I'm getting our home back.

479
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:42,693
What's up?

480
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,326
Sponge.

481
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:45,480
Forceps.

482
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:46,823
A swab.

483
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,031
Manny. We need your help.

484
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:50,233
I can drop everything.

485
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:51,602
Camera.

486
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,831
♪ Chick 'n' sushi
Get it while it's cold ♪

487
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,960
Hoo!

488
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:58,846
Yo, Chicken Brent!

489
00:22:58,847 --> 00:22:59,730
In the flesh.

490
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:01,514
Ba-gawk-oh!

491
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:04,406
Swallow Falls is in trouble.
Will you help us?

492
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:05,450
You bet I will.

493
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,201
I just need someone
to cover my shift.

494
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:10,122
Thanks, tree.

495
00:23:17,228 --> 00:23:18,922
<i>Okay, gang.</i>

496
00:23:18,923 --> 00:23:23,695
We'll be traveling to the island
using my Grocery Deliverator!

497
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:33,057
All right,
who wants to go first?

498
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,316
Hungry.

499
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:36,173
Yes, Steve,

500
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:37,902
hungry for adventure.

501
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:40,073
See you on the island,
my brave lab partner.

502
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:41,133
Afraid!

503
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:43,408
It worked!

504
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:45,418
Banana! Banana! Banana!
Steve!

505
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:48,295
I guess it only works on food.
I gotta fix that.

506
00:23:53,713 --> 00:23:55,548
Ahoy there, skipper, my boy.

507
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:56,423
Dad.

508
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:57,320
Mr. Lockwood?

509
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:59,505
Dad, no. How did
you know we were here?

510
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,277
I could see you
from the apartment.

511
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:08,433
Flint, if you're going home,
so am I.

512
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:10,003
The island's gonna be
very dangerous...

513
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:13,009
I was born on the island,
and I wanna die on that island,

514
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,545
just like your mom.

515
00:24:14,546 --> 00:24:17,350
Besides, I know that place
like the inside of a tackle box.

516
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:18,251
I wanna help.

517
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:19,186
No!

518
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:20,205
Flint, let him help.

519
00:24:20,206 --> 00:24:21,223
The man does have a boat.

520
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:23,508
Which is twice as many boats
as we have.

521
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,373
Fine.
But we'll get there faster

522
00:24:26,374 --> 00:24:27,925
if we use
the Grocery Deliverator.

523
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:28,916
Steve!

524
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:31,087
Aah! Okay, okay,
we'll take the boat!

525
00:24:32,758 --> 00:24:34,741
Shoving off!

526
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:36,645
♪ Ninety-nine buckets
Of chum on a boat ♪

527
00:24:36,646 --> 00:24:39,543
♪ Ninety-nine buckets
Of chum ♪

528
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:46,519

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,356

531
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:52,814
♪ There's 18 buckets of chum

532
00:24:52,815 --> 00:24:55,262
We'll be there in two flaps
of a sardine's fluke!

533
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:57,112
Thanks, Dad!

534
00:24:57,113 --> 00:24:59,548
Okay, when we land
at Swallow Falls,

535
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:01,916
our first objective
is to get to my lab.

536
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,401
I can use my old computer

537
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,068
to pinpoint
the FLDSMDFR's location.

538
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:07,484
Once we find it,
we can shut it down

539
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:10,621
with the utterly
irreplaceable BS-USB.

540
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,740
What if you don't find it?

541
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:18,778
I have to.
It's my machine.

542
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:21,616
If the world gets destroyed
by these, it's my fault.

543
00:25:21,617 --> 00:25:23,578
I can't let that happen.

544
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:24,699
Land ho!

545
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,100
Land ho!

546
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:28,669
If we work together,
this should be easy as...

547
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,725
Pie.

548
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:36,636
Oh, no! We're...

549
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:37,724
Toast!

550
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:39,228
French toast!

551
00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:40,481
This is totally...

552
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:41,661
Bananas!

553
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:45,132
I was gonna say "nuts,"
but now I'm afraid to.

554
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,424
Uh-oh.

555
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:12,320
Whoa, whoa!

556
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:23,532
Home!

557
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:24,509
No! Steve, wait!

558
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,687
The jungle's no place
for a monkey.

559
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,700
Home, home, home!

560
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:31,536
Manny, are you getting this?

561
00:26:31,537 --> 00:26:32,511
I certainly am.

562
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:33,475
Flint.

563
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:35,781
Look! The climate
has shifted dramatically

564
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:37,986
to allow this much vegetation
to grow!

565
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:47,550
Aah! Sam! Ratbirds!

566
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:51,697
Okay, then. All ashore
that's going ashore.

567
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:54,122
Dad, this place
is really dangerous.

568
00:26:54,123 --> 00:26:56,890
I'd feel better
if you stayed here on the boat

569
00:26:56,891 --> 00:26:57,990
where it's safe.

570
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,680
Safe? I wanna help.

571
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:04,418
I'd never forgive myself if you
got eaten by a cheespider.

572
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:06,248
He's right, Tim Lockwood.

573
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,719
Don't worry,
we'll get your home back.

574
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,463
Well, fine.

575
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,489
Thanks, Dad.

576
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,850
We'll try to be back
before suppertime, okay?

577
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,121
Sure.

578
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:37,709
Whoa. Look what's happened
to our town.

579
00:27:40,684 --> 00:27:44,717
Look. There's my angel son
Cal's old preschool.

580
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,577
My old van.

581
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:56,432
Look! An old thing
that I've never seen before!

582
00:27:57,872 --> 00:28:02,010
That's where the Thinkquanauts
were attacked by a cheespider.

583
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,268
It's like a cheesy spider web,

584
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:08,849
made of cheese.
Let's get out of here!

585
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,887
No, wait. What if there's
a survivor in there?

586
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:13,680
Stand back, everybody.

587
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:16,657
I'm gonna cut the cheese.

588
00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:22,316
Uh... That was the cheese.

589
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:26,769
Hello? Anybody in here?

590
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:33,812
Shh!

591
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,380
Sorry.

592
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,285
Ha!

593
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:53,653
Wow.

594
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:56,524
That is the biggest strawberry
I've ever seen in my life.

595
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,008
Is it heavy?

596
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,528
Yeah. But other than that

597
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,348
it looks
like a perfectly normal,

598
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:03,607
fresh, delicious strawberry.

599
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:12,152
N-woo?

600
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:15,385
N-woo?

601
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,593
It's moving!

602
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:19,898
Heh, heh.
Oh, that was a close one.

603
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:22,135
You got a little someone
stuck to your pants.

604
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:25,273
Ah! Get it off! Get it off me!
Sam! Sam!

605
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:26,775
Hey, wait, wait. Stop!

606
00:29:26,776 --> 00:29:30,426
Sam, don't touch it!
Put it down! Put it down!

607
00:29:30,427 --> 00:29:31,611
Look at him.

608
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:41,306
Seriously?

609
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:43,804
Aww. I think
I'll name him Barry!

610
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:46,698
Okay, Sam, could you please
put "Barry" down?

611
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:48,761
Look, we have to get
to the FLDSMDFR

612
00:29:48,762 --> 00:29:50,221
so we can shut it down

613
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,909
with this utterly irreplaceable
BS-USB.

614
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,973
Hey! That's not for you!

615
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:57,086
I need that. Please?

616
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,856
That BS-USB
is really important.

617
00:29:58,857 --> 00:29:59,934
N-woo?

618
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:00,936
N-woo. Yes.

619
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:01,887
N-woo?

620
00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:05,025
Hi, N-woo. Hey, you wanna
hand it to me, buddy?

621
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:05,528
I beg you.

622
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:06,110
Huh?

623
00:30:06,111 --> 00:30:07,163
Please?

624
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:08,160
Oh, oh.

625
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:09,312
Please?

626
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:10,399
N-woo.

627
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,870
N-woo, N-woo. Yes. Yes.
There you go.

628
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:15,338
No!

629
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:21,395
Don't let him get away!

630
00:30:25,187 --> 00:30:28,064
Stop! Stop!

631
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:29,166
Gotcha.

632
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:30,210
N-woo?

633
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:32,156
Aah! Here, you take it,
you take it.

634
00:30:32,157 --> 00:30:36,069
You're gonna have to carry him
until he passes the BS-USB.

635
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,466
And by "pass," you mean...

636
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:40,445
Yes. Look,
we better get a move on

637
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:42,790
before we run into any more
of these creatures.

638
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:16,328
Oh! It's so beautiful.

639
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:18,888
It's enough
to make a grown man cry.

640
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:20,199
But not this man.

641
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,368
Get back in there, tear.

642
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:25,939
Wow, I can't believe
the FLDSMDFR created

643
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,703
all of this.

644
00:31:29,578 --> 00:31:31,370
Ah! Where's Barry?

645
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:33,322
Whee. Ha, ha, ha!

646
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:34,108
Uh-oh.

647
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,092
Ah! Ah!

648
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:39,664
Just a little bit closer.
I can get him.

649
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:40,896
Come on, Earl, faster.

650
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:42,377
Look at the mangos.

651
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:43,788
You mean flamingos.

652
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:45,003
Flamangos!

653
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:46,539
There's a bunch of shrimp!

654
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,378
They look like chimpanzees.

655
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:49,151
Shrimpanzees!

656
00:31:49,152 --> 00:31:49,951
Shrimpanzees!

657
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:52,140
Those are some
tasty-looking jellyfish!

658
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:53,645
Oh!
What's that one over there?

659
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:54,932
That's just a tomato.

660
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:57,358
Barry!

661
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,605
Come on!

662
00:31:58,606 --> 00:32:00,375
Chester gave me that BS-USB.

663
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,317
It's really important.

664
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:03,220
Shrimpanzee.

665
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,078
Steve.

666
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:04,646
Shrimpanzee.

667
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:05,197
Steve.

668
00:32:05,198 --> 00:32:06,233
Shrimpanzee.

669
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,215
Shove.

670
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,558
Steve.

671
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,844
There's a leek in the boat!

672
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:12,975
Hold on, everyone.

673
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:15,311
This ain't gonna be no picnic.

674
00:32:15,312 --> 00:32:17,519
Stop! Get back here!

675
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,175
Keep it steady, Earl.

676
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:21,936
Watermelophants!

677
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:33,974
Barry, grab my hand!

678
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:38,766
Barry!

679
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:43,456
Freeze, berry man.

680
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:44,795
Thanks, Earl. Ugh.

681
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,068
Okay, come here.

682
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:49,267
You have caused enough trouble
for one day.

683
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:50,336
Susheep!

684
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:51,377
Cantalopes.

685
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:53,228
I can't believe your machine

686
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:54,706
reprogrammed itself to create

687
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:57,941
this entire ecosystem
of living food.

688
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,565
How is that even possible?

689
00:33:00,566 --> 00:33:01,908
I have no idea.

690
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:03,560
Best we don't think about it.

691
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,444
The world should know
about this.

692
00:33:05,445 --> 00:33:09,045
Manny, is your camera
still working?

693
00:33:09,046 --> 00:33:12,168
<i>Of course. I've been
rolling since we landed.</i>

694
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:13,888
So much for keeping this
a secret.

695
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:17,560
We can't let these friends
tell the world anything.

696
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,671
What we need to do is go there

697
00:33:19,672 --> 00:33:22,076
and separate Flint
from his friends

698
00:33:22,077 --> 00:33:24,078
so we can manage the situation.

699
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:24,775
Champion!

700
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:25,526
Brilliant idea.

701
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:26,449
Way to go, Chester.

702
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,352
Thank you.

703
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:29,322
Barb, you take care
of that weather girl.

704
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:32,344
But, sir, I'm a scientist.

705
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:34,616
That's why I need you.

706
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:36,763
I want the same brilliant mind

707
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,833
that solved
the unified field theory

708
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:41,595
to help me help Live Corp.

709
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:42,998
Consider it done, sir.

710
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:44,122
Good monkey.

711
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:46,693
To the Helpicopter.

712
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:49,963
Oh, Earl.

713
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:50,700
Pull over there.

714
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:51,420
Duck!

715
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:54,724
Duck? I love... Ba-gawk! Ah!

716
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:04,797
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah!

717
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:06,612
You guys, that wasn't so bad.

718
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:09,093
Yeah, well, be thankful
we didn't run into a...

719
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:10,686
Cheespider!

720
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:12,736
Run!

721
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:19,552
Cheesy. Cheesy. Cheesy.

722
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:21,388
Manny!

723
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,394
Wait for me!

724
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:36,091
Ba-gawk-oh!

725
00:34:41,283 --> 00:34:43,118
I'm glad you still wearing
that diaper.

726
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,611
I wish I brought a fresh one!

727
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,307
Hey, guys! Down this alley!

728
00:34:50,308 --> 00:34:52,227
Oh, no! Dead end.

729
00:35:14,984 --> 00:35:16,953
Ghost man?

730
00:35:16,954 --> 00:35:18,790
<i>Greetings, and namaste.</i>

731
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:20,827
Chester V! You're here!

732
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,796
That's right, young Lockwood.

733
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:24,902
And by the looks of things,
just in time.

734
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:28,254
One minute later, and we would
have been food for that food.

735
00:35:28,255 --> 00:35:29,523
Flint, I thought you said

736
00:35:29,524 --> 00:35:32,405
you were going to complete
this mission alone.

737
00:35:32,406 --> 00:35:33,530
Can I say something?

738
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,984
Apparently you can.

739
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:36,820
This is Barb, my number two.

740
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:38,759
Why are you carrying

741
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,185
a strawberry
in your backpack, miss?

742
00:35:42,186 --> 00:35:43,626
Stand back, everyone!

743
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:45,728
Hey, hey, hey, stop.
You're scaring him.

744
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,594
Scaring him?
Oh, please,

745
00:35:47,595 --> 00:35:50,538
it's probably
got a mouth full of fangs.

746
00:35:51,725 --> 00:35:53,291
Now you're scaring me.

747
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:56,362
I've been carrying him
and he hasn't hurt anyone.

748
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,084
I'm sorry.
Are you a scientist?

749
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:00,203
Matter of fact, I am.

750
00:36:00,204 --> 00:36:01,320
She's a meteorologist.

751
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:03,405
Meteorology.
Oh, I love it.

752
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:06,199
The science of smiling
and having pretty hair

753
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,659
while you point at a map.

754
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:07,630
It's a very important job...

755
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:09,613
Meteorology is

756
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:11,366
a comprehensive analysis...

757
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,005
Ladies, ladies. Please.

758
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:17,134
I'm sure we can all agree
that one of you is a scientist.

759
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,439
Young Lockwood,

760
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,417
why was your lady friend
carrying this rabid

761
00:36:21,418 --> 00:36:23,400
little strawberry
in her backpack?

762
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:25,811
Why is the strawberry guy
in the backpack?

763
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:27,812
Well, um, that's funny.
Um... It's...

764
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:30,130
Uh... You know
what he did? Um...

765
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:35,408
He, uh...
He ate the BS-USB.

766
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:36,879
Not the BSUSB.

767
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,099
I'm on it.

768
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,284
She's got a knife!

769
00:36:39,285 --> 00:36:41,423
If you touch a leaf
on his head...

770
00:36:41,424 --> 00:36:42,828
Step away
from the berry, madam.

771
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,539
That orange hairy lady
scared the jam out of him!

772
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,510
N-woo?

773
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:51,985
Oh, no, it's jammed.

774
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:53,121
Lick. Lick. Lick.

775
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:54,255
Oh, thanks, Steve.

776
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:55,570
Young Lockwood.

777
00:36:55,571 --> 00:36:57,140
The world could've
been destroyed

778
00:36:57,141 --> 00:37:00,692
because of the actions
of one sinister strawberry.

779
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:03,924
We cannot allow any more
mistakes like this.

780
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:05,427
Oh...

781
00:37:05,428 --> 00:37:08,333
It won't be long before
those malicious melons,

782
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,613
pernicious pickles,

783
00:37:10,614 --> 00:37:12,166
and belligerent burgers
learn to swim

784
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:14,351
and make their way
to the mainland.

785
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:17,653
What is your plan?

786
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:20,254
I need to get back to my lab
so I can

787
00:37:20,255 --> 00:37:22,084
make contact with the FLDSMDFR.

788
00:37:22,085 --> 00:37:22,973
Brilliant!

789
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,108
I'll lead the way.

790
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:28,214
No, we'll lead the way.

791
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:29,451
Safe, safe, safe.

792
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:32,247
I believe
my Sentinels of Safety

793
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:36,153
are better equipped to lead us
in their robo-suits.

794
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,027
N-woo?

795
00:37:45,753 --> 00:37:47,930
"I'll be back before supper."

796
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:49,581
What a bunch of baloney.

797
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:52,390
Just leave me on the boat
without any food.

798
00:37:52,391 --> 00:37:55,451
I know a place where
I can get something to eat.

799
00:37:55,452 --> 00:37:58,074
There she is.
Home sweet home.

800
00:38:08,478 --> 00:38:09,819
What?

801
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,591
There's no sardines?
Had to be looters.

802
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:17,662
Ah.
Vintage Baby Brent.

803
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:20,476
Ah.

804
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:34,698
Oh, chum.

805
00:38:42,592 --> 00:38:45,196
No, no!

806
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:51,074
Uh-huh. Yeah. Heh.

807
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:54,051
I like them too. I do.
I love them.

808
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:55,586
Mine. No, no. Mine.

809
00:38:55,587 --> 00:38:57,186
Off. Off. Mine.

810
00:38:57,187 --> 00:39:00,657
No, no, mine. Mine. Off.

811
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:10,278
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, you guys.
Come on, you could lose an eye.

812
00:39:13,381 --> 00:39:15,817
Look, I tell you what.
You want more sardines?

813
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:17,953
I can get you more sardines.

814
00:39:22,886 --> 00:39:26,390
Hey, thanks for loaning me
these skinny jeans, Flint.

815
00:39:26,391 --> 00:39:27,481
Those aren't skinny jeans.

816
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:28,614
Nope.

817
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:31,783
My feet are turning purple.
Is that bad?

818
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,283
Uh-oh.

819
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,640
Bananostrich! Ah!

820
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:44,648
Go, go, go! Come on, Brent!

821
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,952
Banana! Banana! Banana!

822
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:53,704
That bunch of bananostriches
nearly split us.

823
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:55,645
Are you okay?

824
00:39:58,954 --> 00:40:00,422
Oh, my gosh.

825
00:40:01,259 --> 00:40:02,410
My house!

826
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:05,983
Home, home, home!

827
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:10,987
Oh, my gosh.

828
00:40:10,988 --> 00:40:12,790
Your lab!

829
00:40:14,574 --> 00:40:15,660
Oh, crap balls.

830
00:40:15,661 --> 00:40:18,162
We can't go up there,
Flint Lockwood.

831
00:40:18,163 --> 00:40:20,332
That dangly, upsy-downsy lab's
not to code.

832
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,344
I've got to, if I'm gonna find
the FLDSMDFR.

833
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:24,525
We can do it.
Those load-bearing vines

834
00:40:24,526 --> 00:40:25,996
will be able to support
a small team.

835
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:27,758
Onwards and upwards!

836
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,606
Right, sir. To the lab!

837
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,767
Sentinels, keep the locals safe.

838
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:40,176
I'll keep them safe.

839
00:40:40,177 --> 00:40:42,679
Hey, guys! Where you going?
Guys! Hey,

840
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,240
wait for me!

841
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,959
Uh-oh.

842
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,196
A little help?

843
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:53,618
STEVE Spooky.

844
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,054
Spooky is right, Steve.

845
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:01,618
I say,

846
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,715
this laboratory of yours
is a wonder of engineering.

847
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:07,123
Really?

848
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:08,468
Thank you, sir.

849
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:09,704
Initiating backup power.

850
00:41:11,508 --> 00:41:15,476
<i>Welcome, Flint.</i>

851
00:41:15,477 --> 00:41:17,180
Whoa, my computer's dead.

852
00:41:17,181 --> 00:41:20,246
The fate of the world
is depending on us.

853
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:21,620
Think, Lockwood.

854
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:23,700
Well, if I could pull

855
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:25,804
the hard drive, there's enough
equipment in this lab

856
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:28,254
that I could build
a tracking device.

857
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:28,867
Whoa!

858
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:29,526
Flint!

859
00:41:29,527 --> 00:41:31,734
I say, young Lockwood,

860
00:41:31,735 --> 00:41:34,390
what extraordinary underpants.

861
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:37,327
Thank you, sir. They're
my wedgie-proof underwear.

862
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,379
I invented them when I was 6.

863
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,296
I had no idea we were so alike.

864
00:41:42,297 --> 00:41:44,247
Except I invented mine

865
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:46,071
when I was 3.

866
00:41:47,544 --> 00:41:49,113
You guys have been wearing
the same underwear

867
00:41:49,114 --> 00:41:50,648
since you were kids?

868
00:41:50,649 --> 00:41:51,217
Yes!

869
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:51,769
Yes!

870
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,240
Excuse me.

871
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:55,444
How do you expect us
to get the hard drive

872
00:41:55,445 --> 00:41:58,423
with all that
electrified water?

873
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:02,811
We dangle!

874
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,248
Come, Lockwood, give the monkey
your underpants.

875
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:07,099
What?

876
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,843
Lay on, young Lockwood.

877
00:42:14,588 --> 00:42:16,187
Whoa!

878
00:42:16,188 --> 00:42:18,591
Whoa!

879
00:42:19,196 --> 00:42:21,115
Yes! Heh, heh.

880
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:22,654
Whoa!

881
00:42:22,655 --> 00:42:25,905
You know, hanging from
my underpants in this space

882
00:42:25,906 --> 00:42:27,789
brings back so many memories.

883
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,269
I too built my lab up high

884
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,124
to keep the bullies out!

885
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,470
You were...

886
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,333
You were bullied too?

887
00:42:38,334 --> 00:42:39,703
Absolutely.

888
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:41,662
People like us

889
00:42:41,663 --> 00:42:43,519
are always bullied.

890
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,789
Sometimes I wish I'd kept
my bullies around.

891
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,103
Really?

892
00:42:47,104 --> 00:42:49,311
So I could crush them
with my success.

893
00:42:49,312 --> 00:42:51,450
Just like you did
with that man-baby.

894
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:52,961
You mean Brent?

895
00:42:52,962 --> 00:42:55,831
Sure, he used to be a bully,
but he's my friend now.

896
00:42:55,832 --> 00:42:59,746
Friend? A bully can
never be your friend.

897
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:00,548
Never?

898
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:01,313
Remember

899
00:43:01,314 --> 00:43:03,682
the ancient Chinese proverb:

900
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:08,258
Huh?

901
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:11,491
"Stew offered by a bully
is poisoned broth."

902
00:43:11,492 --> 00:43:12,898
Wow, stew.

903
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:14,756
I have so much to learn.

904
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:17,058
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

905
00:43:20,261 --> 00:43:21,732
Mission accomplished!

906
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:25,444
Indeed, young Lockwood.
Indeed.

907
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,636
Help!

908
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,059
Help! Come on, guys.
Get me ou...!

909
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:39,302
You okay, Earl?

910
00:43:39,303 --> 00:43:41,967
My chest hairs
have been tingling all day.

911
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:43,996
Don't worry.
Live Corp Sentinels

912
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:47,947
have danger-sensing fibers
built into their chest plates.

913
00:43:47,948 --> 00:43:49,511
Bravo, Lockwood.

914
00:43:49,512 --> 00:43:51,781
With luck,
we'll survive the night.

915
00:44:04,874 --> 00:44:07,755
Hm. Sounds
like midnight snacks.

916
00:44:07,756 --> 00:44:10,504
Dr. Manny!
This is delicious!

917
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:12,682
I call it Manny's Gorilla Stew.

918
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,628
So how do you make
a gorilla stew?

919
00:44:14,629 --> 00:44:16,873
You keep it waiting
for two hours.

920
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,295
Hey, guys.
Oh, that smells good.

921
00:44:19,296 --> 00:44:21,744
Hey, Flint! Wanna try
some of this special stew?

922
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:25,547
I saved you a bowl.
It's killer.

923
00:44:25,548 --> 00:44:27,916
Killer stew.

924
00:44:31,053 --> 00:44:32,988
No!

925
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:35,725
Thank you,

926
00:44:35,726 --> 00:44:37,903
Brent.

927
00:44:37,904 --> 00:44:39,672
Ever since that ghost man
showed up,

928
00:44:39,673 --> 00:44:39,630
Flint Lockwood's been acting...

929
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:41,902
Jerky.

930
00:44:41,903 --> 00:44:43,407
He rejected my stew.

931
00:44:43,408 --> 00:44:46,031
No one has ever
rejected my stew.

932
00:44:46,032 --> 00:44:49,203
I'm gonna go talk to him.

933
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:51,421
Flint, wait up.

934
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,431
Yeah, Sam?

935
00:44:52,432 --> 00:44:54,064
Is something wrong?

936
00:44:54,065 --> 00:44:55,333
Yeah, we blew a fuse.

937
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:57,040
You blew a fuse.

938
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:59,640
Why are you being so weird
to your friends?

939
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:01,436
What?
I haven't been weird.

940
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:03,441
You karate-chopped

941
00:45:03,442 --> 00:45:06,225
Manny's stew
out of Brent's hands.

942
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:07,713
You hurt their feelings.

943
00:45:07,714 --> 00:45:09,634
Sam, you wouldn't understand.

944
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,322
I do understand,

945
00:45:14,323 --> 00:45:15,792
but you're forgetting that:

946
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,352
Huh?

947
00:45:21,353 --> 00:45:22,620
"A bully turned friend

948
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:25,044
will be friend to the end."

949
00:45:25,045 --> 00:45:28,660
Listen, Brent came here
to help you.

950
00:45:28,661 --> 00:45:29,845
We all did.

951
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,981
And you're acting like
we're just in your way.

952
00:45:36,982 --> 00:45:40,757
Remember, we work together.

953
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:52,318
That weather girl
is ruining our plan.

954
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,930
I just need more time, sir.

955
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:55,563
We don't have more time.

956
00:45:55,564 --> 00:45:58,339
If we don't get the FLDSMDFR
in the next 48 hours,

957
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,484
we'll miss our deadline
to release Food Bar 8.0.

958
00:46:01,485 --> 00:46:02,869
I'll be a laughingstock!

959
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:05,015
Sir, let me handle this.

960
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:08,280
Never send a monkey
to do Chester work.

961
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:10,201
I'll take care of it.

962
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,635
Okay, guys, we're here.
Hey, hey, hey!

963
00:46:20,636 --> 00:46:23,100
That is not for you.

964
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:24,603
All right, let's get to it.

965
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:31,813
Okay.
You got this, right?

966
00:46:32,861 --> 00:46:36,799
Okay. Then you wanna put one
of these on there, like that.

967
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,440
No, no, no.
No, don't eat that.

968
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:42,359
That's bad.
You'll hurt yourself.

969
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,162
Hey, hey, easy! Stop picking
on your brother, will you?

970
00:46:45,163 --> 00:46:47,588
How would you like it
if he was shoving you?

971
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:49,022
Okay, now watch.

972
00:46:49,023 --> 00:46:52,766
Are you watching?
One and two and three!

973
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:55,137
Catch the big one!

974
00:46:58,208 --> 00:46:59,743
Yeah, good, huh?

975
00:46:59,744 --> 00:47:01,012
It's called fishing.

976
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:11,233
♪ Out on my boat ♪

977
00:47:11,234 --> 00:47:13,537

00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:15,458

♪ That's my crazy world ♪

984
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:33,603
I tell you, if only Flint liked
fishing as much as you guys.

985
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:37,462
Why am I talking to a pickle?

986
00:47:42,374 --> 00:47:44,610
Dangerous food creatures
detected.

987
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,854
Stay put.
We'll find and destroy them.

988
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,366
Barry!

989
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:52,970
You can't be here.

990
00:47:54,215 --> 00:47:55,622
You better hide him.

991
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,647
Okay, gang! Today's the day
we find the FLDSMDFR.

992
00:47:58,648 --> 00:48:01,603
Sam, I was thinking about
what you said last night...

993
00:48:01,604 --> 00:48:02,920
N-woo?

994
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:03,972
What?

995
00:48:03,973 --> 00:48:04,967
Me too.

996
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:07,817
Right. Listen, I have
been acting weird,

997
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,887
but it's only because
I'm under a lot of pressure.

998
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:10,417
N-woo?

999
00:48:10,418 --> 00:48:10,984
What?

1000
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:12,456
So true!

1001
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:14,426
But I'm also doing this for us.

1002
00:48:14,427 --> 00:48:18,666
You see, I still want Sparkswood
to happen, but it can't.

1003
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:21,265
Not until I become
a great inventor like Chester V.

1004
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:23,462
Flint, you don't have
to prove anything...

1005
00:48:23,463 --> 00:48:26,955
Ha, ha. Lockwood!
How goes the inventing?

1006
00:48:26,956 --> 00:48:30,012
Very good, sir. I was
up all night making this.

1007
00:48:30,013 --> 00:48:32,596
I call it the Flint Lockwood
Food Jungle

1008
00:48:32,597 --> 00:48:34,592
Topographical Pointing Machine.

1009
00:48:34,593 --> 00:48:35,741
Or...

1010
00:48:35,742 --> 00:48:36,910
The FLFJTPM! Brilliant!

1011
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:38,071
Oh, thank you, sir.

1012
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:39,764
Follow the beam,
find the machine.

1013
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,649
All I have to do now
is cut the leg holes.

1014
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,421
Ooh.

1015
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,669
Huh. Well,

1016
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,909
maybe it's better

1017
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:50,542
here.

1018
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:51,867
Great idea, Sam.

1019
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:53,423
And, guys,
you can help me by...

1020
00:48:53,424 --> 00:48:54,831
Excuse us.

1021
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:56,933
Your friends are distracting
you from our mission.

1022
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,298
Distracting?

1023
00:48:59,632 --> 00:49:02,557
My chest hairs just
don't trust that Chester.

1024
00:49:02,558 --> 00:49:04,747
We should be hunting
the FLDSMDFR, not chitchatting.

1025
00:49:04,748 --> 00:49:06,041
But, sir, I...

1026
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:07,353
You're heading into the deepest,

1027
00:49:07,354 --> 00:49:08,847
darkest part of the jungle.

1028
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,552
You need to focus
on saving the world.

1029
00:49:13,553 --> 00:49:16,391
Be a hero.

1030
00:49:17,266 --> 00:49:18,767
Okay. You're right, sir.

1031
00:49:18,768 --> 00:49:21,976
Excellent! Let's go!

1032
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,962
Okay, Barry,
time to go home now.

1033
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:29,458
Okay. Okay.
Okay, one more hug, Barry.

1034
00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:30,612
Barry?

1035
00:49:30,613 --> 00:49:32,657
Right! Barry.

1036
00:49:32,658 --> 00:49:34,110
You Barry.

1037
00:49:34,111 --> 00:49:35,475
Barry.

1038
00:49:35,476 --> 00:49:38,836
And I'm Sam Sparks.

1039
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:40,846
Saspa.

1040
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:41,447
Right! Sam...

1041
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:42,431
Come on, Sam!

1042
00:49:42,432 --> 00:49:43,380
Coming!

1043
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:46,581
Okay, Barry,
time to go home now. Now go.

1044
00:49:46,582 --> 00:49:47,926
Now you go on home.

1045
00:49:47,927 --> 00:49:49,814
Buh.

1046
00:49:49,815 --> 00:49:51,183
Bye.

1047
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:52,470
Huh?

1048
00:49:55,735 --> 00:49:57,495
Saspa?

1049

Holy guacamole!

1061
00:51:04,576 --> 00:51:06,912
I got this, bro!

1062
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:09,503
I'm okay!

1063
00:51:09,504 --> 00:51:12,446
Up there! Hurry, Sam!

1064
00:51:18,144 --> 00:51:19,913
Barb!

1065
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:29,072
You okay?

1066
00:51:29,073 --> 00:51:30,756
Uh-huh.

1067
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,379
Freeze!

1068
00:51:38,979 --> 00:51:41,415
Come on, let's go!
Let's get out of here!

1069
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:45,194
Bravo, young Lockwood, bravo!

1070
00:52:07,943 --> 00:52:09,606
A mother?

1071
00:52:09,607 --> 00:52:11,109
Sam!

1072
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,389
Saspa!

1073
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:20,859
Butter.

1074
00:52:22,314 --> 00:52:23,560
Parkay.

1075
00:52:23,561 --> 00:52:26,088
Almost there.

1076
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:28,592
The FLDSMDFR should be
just across this syrup bog.

1077
00:52:28,593 --> 00:52:32,587
This is syrup?
Syrup is my favorite.

1078
00:52:32,588 --> 00:52:34,762
Darn mosquitoasts!

1079
00:52:34,763 --> 00:52:36,972
Don't worry, man-baby.

1080
00:52:36,973 --> 00:52:40,076
They, like all the other
abominable food monsters

1081
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:41,771
will soon be no more.

1082
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:43,180
Wait, Flint!

1083
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:46,220
What if we're making
a big mistake?

1084
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:47,692
Mistake?

1085
00:52:47,693 --> 00:52:49,964
About shutting off
the FLDSMDFR.

1086
00:52:49,965 --> 00:52:53,259
Some of these creatures,
they're incredible.

1087
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,893
Incredibly dangerous.

1088
00:52:54,894 --> 00:52:56,838
We were just attacked
by a giant tacodile.

1089
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:00,001
He's right, Sam. I mean, we were
almost eaten by a cheespider.

1090
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:02,920
It doesn't mean we have
to destroy all of them.

1091
00:53:02,921 --> 00:53:05,854
Some of the food's
actually been friendly.

1092
00:53:05,855 --> 00:53:09,343
It is true. The dessert
creatures are especially sweet.

1093
00:53:09,344 --> 00:53:12,015
Okay. Maybe we... Ah!

1094
00:53:12,016 --> 00:53:14,959
Mosquitoast!
Was gonna bite you.

1095
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,494
See? Even the tiniest creatures
are attacking us.

1096
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:19,859
The only reason they're biting
is because of the drop

1097
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,587
in barometric pressure.
Bugs do that before a storm.

1098
00:53:22,588 --> 00:53:24,481
And by the look
of those nimbostratus clouds...

1099
00:53:25,905 --> 00:53:28,008
Miss Sparks, we are
not talking about the weather.

1100
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:30,642
We are talking about food here.

1101
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:34,483
Dangerous food that does not
have human emotion.

1102
00:53:34,484 --> 00:53:36,529
Food that is not friendly.

1103
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,155
Food that cannot love!

1104
00:53:39,156 --> 00:53:42,193
Flint, we should be
studying the food animals,

1105
00:53:42,194 --> 00:53:43,634
not killing them.

1106
00:53:43,635 --> 00:53:45,266
What if he's wrong?

1107
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:48,082
The choice is yours, son.

1108
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,886
Live up to your full potential,

1109
00:53:49,887 --> 00:53:52,659
or walk away
and let the food monsters

1110
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,397
destroy Lady Liberty.

1111
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,643
Sam, finding that FLDSMDFR

1112
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:00,502
and saving the world,

1113
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:01,940
that's what matters.

1114
00:54:01,941 --> 00:54:04,854
Really?
Our opinion doesn't matter?

1115
00:54:04,855 --> 00:54:06,167
Of course it does!

1116
00:54:06,168 --> 00:54:08,214
Yes! Yes, it matters.

1117
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:10,647
But just not right now.

1118
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:11,699
Uh-oh.

1119
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,695
Wrong answer.

1120
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:13,347
Toast.

1121
00:54:13,348 --> 00:54:13,975
Yeah?

1122
00:54:13,976 --> 00:54:16,679
Well, I guess
this doesn't matter either,

1123
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,670
young Lockwood.

1124
00:54:19,512 --> 00:54:21,781
I'll just
see you back on the boat.

1125
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,585
Wait! Sam!

1126
00:54:26,586 --> 00:54:27,992
Wait, please!

1127
00:54:27,993 --> 00:54:30,392
No! No. Sam! Come back!

1128
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:32,217
Come back, Sam, no!

1129
00:54:32,218 --> 00:54:33,913
No, Sam!

1130
00:54:33,914 --> 00:54:36,088
Sam! Sam!

1131
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:36,589
Sam!

1132
00:54:44,188 --> 00:54:45,824
Hey, Earl,
would you talk to her?

1133
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,163
You bet I will.

1134
00:54:47,164 --> 00:54:48,699
Hey, Sam! Wait for me!

1135
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,075
<i>Adiós. Sayonara.</i>

1136
00:54:50,076 --> 00:54:51,804
Goodbye, Señor Lockwood.

1137
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:53,117
Bye, Flint.

1138
00:54:53,118 --> 00:54:54,953
Steve!

1139
00:54:55,389 --> 00:54:57,244
<i>Et tu, Steve?</i>

1140
00:55:01,086 --> 00:55:04,889
Oh. What just happened?

1141
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,767
You've made
the right choice, son.

1142
00:55:07,768 --> 00:55:11,715
Sentinels! Keep them safe.

1143
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,122
Butter.

1144
00:55:20,801 --> 00:55:22,975
Ah, Young Lockwood,

1145
00:55:22,976 --> 00:55:26,078
we're getting close.
I feel it in my beard!

1146
00:55:33,282 --> 00:55:35,184
Water goes in the top

1147
00:55:35,185 --> 00:55:37,952
and food comes out the bottom.

1148
00:55:37,953 --> 00:55:39,989
It's gotta be inside that
big rock candy mountain!

1149
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:43,393
This is exactly why I wanted
you on this mission.

1150
00:55:43,394 --> 00:55:46,064
Sally forth, Lockwood.

1151
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,430
I can't believe Flint is
still listening to that guy!

1152
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:55,248
Flint is naive. It appears
he is being manipulated

1153
00:55:55,249 --> 00:55:56,841
for some nefarious purpose.

1154
00:55:56,842 --> 00:55:58,787
Of course he is!

1155
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,260
Sam! Freeze!

1156
00:56:00,261 --> 00:56:01,061
What?

1157
00:56:01,062 --> 00:56:04,324
Stay calm and walk toward me

1158
00:56:04,325 --> 00:56:06,437
slowly.

1159
00:56:06,438 --> 00:56:09,765
Very slowly.

1160
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,933
Oh, come on.
Now you're acting weird.

1161
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:14,103
I'm in no mood for this.

1162
00:56:21,384 --> 00:56:23,253
Stop right there,
cheese monster!

1163
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,928
Nobody eats my friends
on my watch!

1164
00:56:31,015 --> 00:56:33,124
No, wait!
Chester's been lying to us

1165
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,266
about these creatures,
and I am going to prove it.

1166
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,162
Sam, don't do it!

1167
00:56:37,163 --> 00:56:39,732
It's foodicide!

1168
00:56:41,804 --> 00:56:43,306
Danger! Danger! Danger!

1169
00:56:43,307 --> 00:56:44,910
Nice cheespider.

1170
00:56:49,419 --> 00:56:50,922
Ohh. Ugh.

1171
00:56:50,923 --> 00:56:51,674
Yellow.

1172
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:52,395
Dude!

1173
00:56:52,396 --> 00:56:55,052
You got special-sauced!

1174
00:56:57,068 --> 00:56:59,148
It's okay, guys. See?

1175
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,930
She's not mean. She's just

1176
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:02,643
a little beefy.

1177
00:57:06,606 --> 00:57:08,205
Whoa. What's it doing?

1178
00:57:08,206 --> 00:57:10,609
I think she wants you
to scratch her buns.

1179
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,428
Aw. I like that too.

1180
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,478
Who's a good cheespider?

1181
00:57:14,479 --> 00:57:15,918
She's cute!

1182
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:17,521
But why did she attack us
before?

1183
00:57:17,522 --> 00:57:21,156
Because we were dressed
like them.

1184
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:23,605
She doesn't like backpacks?

1185
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,702
No. It appears
she doesn't like Live Corp.

1186
00:57:26,703 --> 00:57:29,295
The food creatures
know something

1187
00:57:29,296 --> 00:57:31,696
we do not.

1188
00:57:31,697 --> 00:57:33,132
Gasp!

1189
00:57:33,133 --> 00:57:34,481
Who's Evel?

1190
00:57:34,482 --> 00:57:36,624
Not "Evel." Evil.

1191
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:39,986
I knew it! Chester's
up to something terrible.

1192
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:41,205
We have to warn Flint!

1193
00:57:41,206 --> 00:57:42,353
Let's ride!

1194
00:57:42,354 --> 00:57:44,081
Run!

1195
00:57:49,555 --> 00:57:52,882
You're not warning
anyone about anything.

1196
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:55,507
Oh, crap balls.

1197
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:17,845
Magnificent.

1198
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:24,672
The FLDSMDFR must be up there.

1199
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:30,379
A very unpleasant fall.

1200
00:58:31,161 --> 00:58:33,912
Finish the job, Lockwood.

1201
00:58:33,913 --> 00:58:35,815
Yes, sir.

1202
00:58:37,049 --> 00:58:39,719
Whoa. Ahh!

1203
00:58:52,252 --> 00:58:54,488
Whoa! Oh!

1204
00:58:58,972 --> 00:59:01,007
Made it!

1205
00:59:08,828 --> 00:59:11,265
FLDSMDFR.

1206
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:19,038
Look, I'm sorry
I have to do this to you...

1207
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:19,901
again.

1208
00:59:19,902 --> 00:59:21,904
But I can't let
your swimming cheespiders

1209
00:59:21,905 --> 00:59:24,726
destroy Lady Liberty
or the world.

1210
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:33,448
Whoa.

1211
00:59:34,688 --> 00:59:37,056
<i>Marshmallow.</i>

1212
00:59:55,939 --> 00:59:58,842
They're like a family.

1213
01:00:08,388 --> 01:00:10,245
Sam was right.

1214
01:00:10,246 --> 01:00:12,982
This is a mistake.

1215
01:00:23,526 --> 01:00:25,639
Oh, dear!

1216
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,642
Sir! Uh, sir?

1217
01:00:26,643 --> 01:00:27,591
There it is.

1218
01:00:27,592 --> 01:00:28,760
Wait.

1219
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:29,928
In all its glory.

1220
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:32,838
Chester, look, I can't do this.

1221
01:00:32,839 --> 01:00:34,058
Oh, okay. I will.

1222
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:35,207
What? Wait.

1223
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:37,510
Chester, wait.
We can't destroy it.

1224
01:00:37,511 --> 01:00:38,967
Ah!

1225
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,438
Let go of me, Lockwood.

1226
01:00:40,439 --> 01:00:42,694
No, sir,
I can't let you do this.

1227
01:00:50,281 --> 01:00:52,650
No! No! No!

1228
01:00:57,004 --> 01:00:58,672
<i>Live Corp.</i>

1229
01:00:58,673 --> 01:01:01,770
The BS-USB
reprogrammed it?

1230
01:01:01,771 --> 01:01:03,939
It was never gonna
turn off the machine.

1231
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:07,435
A BS-USB? Hello.

1232
01:01:07,436 --> 01:01:10,763
Your machine is what
I wanted all along.

1233
01:01:10,764 --> 01:01:13,613
You lied to me.

1234
01:01:13,614 --> 01:01:15,373
Of course I lied to you.

1235
01:01:15,374 --> 01:01:18,578
I knew you'd eventually fall
for these pathetic creatures.

1236
01:01:18,579 --> 01:01:21,036
But you were my idol.

1237
01:01:21,037 --> 01:01:23,629
My whole life,
I looked up to you.

1238
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:25,454
I wanted to be you!

1239
01:01:25,455 --> 01:01:28,462
Oh, Lockwood.
I was just using you

1240
01:01:28,463 --> 01:01:29,866
to get your invention.

1241
01:01:29,867 --> 01:01:31,213
We're ready.

1242
01:01:31,214 --> 01:01:33,483
Launch Operation
Slice and Dice.

1243
01:01:43,024 --> 01:01:45,360
And now that I've got
what I want,

1244
01:01:45,361 --> 01:01:46,784
I no longer need you.

1245
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:49,648
I'm afraid we're going
to have to let you go.

1246
01:01:49,649 --> 01:01:51,050
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, please.

1247
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:10,292
Whoa.

1248
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,955
That's not natural.

1249
01:02:11,956 --> 01:02:12,948
No, no, no.

1250
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:15,507
Easy, easy, you guys.
Don't cry.

1251
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,770
Huh?

1252
01:02:59,738 --> 01:03:01,683
Okay, Steve.
If me and you put

1253
01:03:01,684 --> 01:03:03,094
our two brilliant minds
together,

1254
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:04,921
we will get out of here.

1255
01:03:04,922 --> 01:03:05,907
Steve?

1256
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:06,867
Brent, do you ever get

1257
01:03:06,868 --> 01:03:10,346
the feeling that maybe
Steve Lockwood is just a monkey?

1258
01:03:10,347 --> 01:03:13,073
Why would you say that
about him, Earl?

1259
01:03:13,074 --> 01:03:15,451
Why would you ever say that?

1260
01:03:15,452 --> 01:03:19,356
Of course he's just a monkey.
How stupid are you people?

1261
01:03:19,357 --> 01:03:22,908
No one should ever put
any trust in a monkey.

1262
01:03:22,909 --> 01:03:24,945
Chester thinks you're a monkey.

1263
01:03:24,946 --> 01:03:27,868
Well, I'm an ape.
Chester knows that.

1264
01:03:27,869 --> 01:03:29,852
But he calls you a monkey.

1265
01:03:29,853 --> 01:03:31,677
Ooh!

1266
01:03:31,678 --> 01:03:32,879
It is true, he does.

1267
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,749
He's just joking around.

1268
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,278
Chester's my best friend.

1269
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:41,023
If Chester
was really your friend,

1270
01:03:41,024 --> 01:03:43,358
would he still call you
a monkey?

1271
01:04:06,756 --> 01:04:09,057
N-woo! N-woo!

1272
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:24,178
Flint.

1273
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:25,572
Dad.

1274
01:04:25,573 --> 01:04:29,029
What's happening, son?
You look terrible.

1275
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,665
What's with all of them?

1276
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,500
They saved my life.

1277
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,256
I let Chester steal the machine

1278
01:04:35,257 --> 01:04:38,009
and now he's starting
Operation Slice and Dice.

1279
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:41,408
Come on, son. You're really
not making any sense.

1280
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:44,456
Look, Chester's gonna wipe out
all the foodimals.

1281
01:04:45,671 --> 01:04:48,107
My friends tried to
tell me they were good,

1282
01:04:48,108 --> 01:04:49,364
but I didn't listen.

1283
01:04:49,365 --> 01:04:51,722
Everything I touch
just gets ruined.

1284
01:04:51,723 --> 01:04:53,223
N-woo!

1285
01:04:53,224 --> 01:04:54,792
Barry?

1286
01:04:54,793 --> 01:04:56,425
N-woo!

1287
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:59,656
Barry. I'm so sorry
I misjudged you.

1288
01:04:59,657 --> 01:05:01,092
I should have listened to Sam.

1289
01:05:01,093 --> 01:05:02,504
Saspa. Sam.

1290
01:05:02,505 --> 01:05:05,008
What is it?
What are you trying to say?

1291
01:05:08,523 --> 01:05:09,737
Saspa, Saspa.

1292
01:05:09,738 --> 01:05:12,170
Sa... Saspa.

1293
01:05:12,171 --> 01:05:13,089
Sassy pants.

1294
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:13,962
Dad.

1295
01:05:13,963 --> 01:05:15,114
Saspa, Saspa!

1296
01:05:15,115 --> 01:05:16,554
Sam and the gang?

1297
01:05:16,555 --> 01:05:18,523
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1298
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,453
It looks like
a Sentinel of Safety.

1299
01:05:26,478 --> 01:05:27,885
Aha! Sassy pants.

1300
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:29,421
Sassy pants? No, Dad.

1301
01:05:29,422 --> 01:05:31,824
He's saying Sentinels captured
Sam and the gang.

1302
01:05:36,143 --> 01:05:38,186
And they're being held
in the factory?

1303
01:05:38,187 --> 01:05:39,662
We gotta get them out of there.

1304
01:05:39,663 --> 01:05:43,759
But how?
There's just two of us.

1305
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,231
N-woo!

1306
01:05:56,913 --> 01:05:58,672
N-woo!

1307
01:05:58,673 --> 01:06:00,113
N-woo! N-woo!

1308
01:06:00,114 --> 01:06:01,733
N-woo!

1309
01:06:01,734 --> 01:06:03,247
N-woo!

1310
01:06:03,248 --> 01:06:03,748
N-woo!

1311
01:06:07,825 --> 01:06:09,994
Hey, what's with all
the "N-woos"?

1312
01:06:10,643 --> 01:06:12,078
Why do they have my TV?

1313
01:06:14,131 --> 01:06:19,348
<i>Water goes in the top
and food comes out the bottom.</i>

1314
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:23,346
<i>N-woo! N-woo!</i>

1315
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:25,517
What's it, broken or something?
What's it doing?

1316
01:06:25,518 --> 01:06:28,211
N-woo!

1317
01:06:28,212 --> 01:06:30,965
Here, you take it, you take it.

1318
01:06:30,966 --> 01:06:32,309
N-woo.

1319
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:34,324
It's saying that I'm N-woo.

1320
01:06:34,325 --> 01:06:35,733
N-woo.

1321
01:06:35,734 --> 01:06:38,229
N-woo. N-woo.

1322
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:40,501
N-woo.

1323
01:06:40,502 --> 01:06:42,505
Look, Flint,
they came here to help.

1324
01:06:42,506 --> 01:06:44,789
We all did.
It's time to let us.

1325
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,592
Uh-huh.

1326
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:50,711
Okay, I don't know
if you can understand me.

1327
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:54,414
I know you think I'm N-woo.

1328
01:06:54,415 --> 01:06:56,093
I know you think I'm N-woo.

1329
01:06:56,094 --> 01:06:59,255
But the truth
is I'm no N-woo,

1330
01:06:59,256 --> 01:07:01,496
I'm just a man.

1331
01:07:01,497 --> 01:07:03,232
A man who's made
a lot of mistakes

1332
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:05,081
in the last couple of days.

1333
01:07:05,082 --> 01:07:08,465
And now my friends are in
a lot of trouble, thanks to me.

1334
01:07:09,866 --> 01:07:12,547
Someone once told me
that I didn't need friends.

1335
01:07:12,548 --> 01:07:15,211
That I could accomplish more
by myself.

1336
01:07:15,212 --> 01:07:17,051
I know now more than ever

1337
01:07:17,052 --> 01:07:18,842
that he was wrong.

1338
01:07:18,843 --> 01:07:21,247
We need all the friends
we can get.

1339
01:07:21,248 --> 01:07:24,668
And I need your help.
All of you. Fruits,

1340
01:07:24,669 --> 01:07:27,835
vegetables and meat!

1341
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:31,141
I need you to help me
to get into that factory,

1342
01:07:31,142 --> 01:07:34,589
save our friends
and get our home back!

1343
01:07:39,582 --> 01:07:42,781
Okay, now I just
gotta figure out

1344
01:07:42,782 --> 01:07:44,254
how to get in there.

1345
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,376
With the right rod and tackle,
I could cast you up

1346
01:07:47,377 --> 01:07:49,173
into that unfinished part
of the factory.

1347
01:07:49,174 --> 01:07:50,953
Should be a piece of cake.

1348
01:07:50,954 --> 01:07:52,061
Hm?

1349
01:07:52,062 --> 01:07:55,327

Sam's backpack.

01:10:06,417 --> 01:10:08,153
They were here!

1384
01:10:14,545 --> 01:10:16,593

01:10:26,451 --> 01:10:27,569

01:10:30,164 --> 01:10:31,474
Thanks, cheespider.

N-woo!

1389
01:10:37,621 --> 01:10:40,023
Barry,
use the Grocery Deliverator

1390
01:10:40,024 --> 01:10:42,421
to save your friends.

1391
01:10:42,422 --> 01:10:44,759
I'll go save mine.

01:10:46,582 --> 01:10:48,351
Uh-huh.

1393
01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:02,968

There's a leek in my boat.

You're still alive?

1408
01:12:10,175 --> 01:12:13,632
That's right. Hands up.
Give me back my friends.

1409
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:17,937
Of course!
I have them right here.

1410
01:12:18,913 --> 01:12:20,321
Hey, Flint.

1411
01:12:20,322 --> 01:12:22,913
Sam! Guys!
Chester, let them go!

1412
01:12:22,914 --> 01:12:26,498
Don't worry, Lockwood,
I'll let them go.

1413
01:12:26,499 --> 01:12:30,881
Right into my super-sized
Food Bar machine.

1414
01:12:30,882 --> 01:12:32,067
Food Bars?

1415
01:12:32,068 --> 01:12:33,186
Food Bars?

1416
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:35,824
You're going
to turn them into Food Bars?

1417
01:12:35,825 --> 01:12:39,650
Yes, Food Bars.
The lifeblood of my company.

1418
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:41,572
I learned your FLDSMDFR food

1419
01:12:41,573 --> 01:12:43,681
is far more delicious
than "food" food.

1420
01:12:43,682 --> 01:12:45,924
So using your foodimals
as ingredients

1421
01:12:45,925 --> 01:12:48,197
would make my products
super-delicious!

1422
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:50,200
I had to have your invention.

1423
01:12:50,201 --> 01:12:52,997
Unfortunately,
I couldn't find it.

1424
01:12:52,998 --> 01:12:55,460
Until you helped me.

1425
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:58,372
FLDSMDFR!

1426
01:12:58,373 --> 01:13:01,061
<i>Watermelon!</i>

1427
01:13:04,774 --> 01:13:08,039
You're a monster!
Those are living creatures.

1428
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,442
Yes, that's the problem.

1429
01:13:09,443 --> 01:13:12,551
Food with legs
is much harder to catch.

1430
01:13:12,552 --> 01:13:16,584
They hide, they fight back,
they want to live. Ugh.

1431
01:13:16,585 --> 01:13:19,183
But now that I control
your FLDSMDFR,

1432
01:13:19,184 --> 01:13:23,208
I can pave your island
and work in complete secrecy.

1433
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:24,745
Live Corp will remain

1434
01:13:24,746 --> 01:13:27,658

in the world

1435
01:13:27,659 --> 01:13:31,050
with a new Food Bar version 8.0!

1436
01:13:31,051 --> 01:13:32,352
I should've believed in you.

1437
01:13:32,353 --> 01:13:34,506
Yes, that was quite foolish.

1438
01:13:34,507 --> 01:13:36,321
Now if you want
your friends back,

1439
01:13:36,322 --> 01:13:38,235
I suggest you drop your cans.

1440
01:13:38,236 --> 01:13:41,003
Don't do it, Flint!
Save the island!

1441
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:43,020
But you are my island.

1442
01:13:43,021 --> 01:13:46,060
Ew. Okay, first, shut up.

1443
01:13:46,061 --> 01:13:49,259
Then drop the cans
or I drop your friends.

1444
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,571
Okay, okay. There.

1445
01:13:50,572 --> 01:13:51,755
Oh, no, Flint.

1446
01:13:51,756 --> 01:13:54,572
This is embarrassing.
I changed my mind.

1447
01:13:54,573 --> 01:13:56,909
Please understand
I can't leave any witnesses.

1448
01:13:58,191 --> 01:13:59,468
Barb, grind them.

1449
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,306
But, sir, I didn't think
we were going to...

1450
01:14:01,307 --> 01:14:03,149
This is why I work alone.

1451
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:06,521
Monkey! You are dismissed.

1452
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:10,160
And now, without further ado.

1453
01:14:10,161 --> 01:14:12,814
Flint, hurry!

1454
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,575
Why won't this go faster?

1455
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:15,945
Give me that controller!

1456
01:14:15,946 --> 01:14:19,057
Sure, come and get it.

1457
01:14:21,521 --> 01:14:22,923
But which one of us has it?

1458
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:24,215
Is it me?

1459
01:14:24,216 --> 01:14:25,457
Or me?

1460
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:27,056
Oh!

1461
01:14:27,057 --> 01:14:29,328
Earl, can't you break us
out of here?

1462
01:14:29,329 --> 01:14:33,008
Yellow police tape!
The one thing I can't break.

1463

1466
01:14:42,547 --> 01:14:44,082
I'm sorry I was such an idiot.

1467
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,779
Flint, that's true,

1468
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,691
but now may not be the time!

1469
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:50,659
Please let me finish.
I took you all for granted.

1470
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,048
I should have listened to you.

1471
01:14:52,049 --> 01:14:54,324
Okay, go on. But hurry!

1472
01:14:54,325 --> 01:14:57,479
The truth is I need each
and every one of you guys.

1473
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,767
You're more than my friends.
You're my family. Oh!

1474
01:15:00,768 --> 01:15:02,645
How sweet. Note to self:

1475
01:15:02,646 --> 01:15:04,248
Put that on their tombstones.

1476
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:05,781
Good one, Chester!

1477
01:15:05,782 --> 01:15:07,727
Don't you see, young Lockwood?

1478
01:15:07,728 --> 01:15:10,399
These friends are the reason
you keep losing.

1479
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,661
Well, it's better than ending up
alone like you.

1480
01:15:12,662 --> 01:15:14,166
Ha, ha, I'm not alone!

1481
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:16,236
I've got holograms!

1482
01:15:18,232 --> 01:15:22,232
Flint! Why don't you throw him
a party?

1483
01:15:22,233 --> 01:15:23,435
We love parties.

1484

Party's over, Lockwood.

No!

1488
01:15:35,161 --> 01:15:36,312
Not yet.

1489
01:15:36,313 --> 01:15:39,383
I think it's time to celebrate!

No!

No, Flint! Chester!

1502

I've got what I want.
Enjoy your friends, Lockwood.

No! No!

1504

Don't do this!

No! Never!

Chester, there's nowhere to go.

That's what you think.

You're going to be fine.

1523

We'll save you.

You see, Flint?
With my holograms...

01:17:23,367 --> 01:17:25,937
Oh, fudge.

1526
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:33,889
I saved myself.

1527
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:43,881
Ugh.

1528
01:17:43,882 --> 01:17:46,086
That will leave a bad taste
in your mouth.

1529
01:17:46,087 --> 01:17:47,403
Ugh.

1530
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:52,176
Ahem. Uh, I believe
this belongs to you.

1531
01:18:06,924 --> 01:18:08,461

Guys,

1541
01:19:08,629 --> 01:19:11,924
do you think we could still
work together?

1542
01:19:11,925 --> 01:19:16,597
I think we will work
great together.

1543
01:19:18,518 --> 01:19:21,336
Come on, bring it on in, Barb.

1544
01:19:36,889 --> 01:19:39,640
Aw, this is nice.

Monkey.

I'm proud of you, son.

1548
01:19:46,426 --> 01:19:47,897
Thanks, Dad.

1549
01:19:47,898 --> 01:19:50,936
But there's one last thing
I need to do.

1550
01:19:51,963 --> 01:19:55,449
Okay, now, son. Now,
once you put it on like that,

1551
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:57,419
all you have to do is cast it.

1552
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,898
So like this? Ehh.

1553
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:03,355
No, no, no.
Here, let me show you how.

1554
01:20:03,356 --> 01:20:05,258
See, it's all in the wrist.
Like this.

1555
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:08,124
Whoo!
Catch the big one, boy.

1556
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:09,127
Am I fishing?

1557
01:20:09,128 --> 01:20:10,077
Yup.

1558
01:20:10,078 --> 01:20:11,932
I'm fishing!

1559
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:14,621
Whoa, whoa!
You've got a live one.

1560
01:20:14,622 --> 01:20:16,732
Now reel him in, Flint.

1561
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:21,105
That's it. Steady, steady.
Oh. He's a fighter!

1562
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:24,383
Ah! I got one!

1563
01:20:24,384 --> 01:20:25,419
I got one, Dad!

1564
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,398
Okay.

1565
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,337
Can we do this again?
Like all the time?

1566
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,279
You betcha, skipper.

1567
01:20:34,721 --> 01:20:37,123
Sam, guys,
I caught my first fish!

1568
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,425
Yay!

1569
01:20:38,426 --> 01:20:39,793
