1
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,987
Move it, dorkus.

2
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,618
Okay, I think you're next.
I'll take your ticket.

3
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,080
Come right around this way.
Keep your back straight.

4
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,999
Put your books down
on your lap.

5
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:26,086
Now, look right up at the camera,
okay? Nice smile. Here we go.

6
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,756
Let me focus right over here.
Okay. Get you in.

7
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,216
That's good.

8
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,802
Swing around this way
just a little bit, Gina.

9
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,096
- It's Jenna.
- Look over here, Gina.

10
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,056
It's Jenna!

11
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,321
Oh, God.

12
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,199
Oh, no.

13
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,583
I've had enough already.

14
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,512
Hey, Jenna.

15
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,597
Matt, please. No more pictures.

16
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:22,059
Come on. It's your 1 3th birthday.
We gotta document it.

17
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,905
- Hi, Tom-Tom.
- Hey, Jenna.

18
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,449
Hi, Beaver.
How's everything at the dam?

19
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,620
- So how'd yours come out, Rink?
- Not so good.

20
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,747
Yeah, mine aren't so hot either.

21
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,584
- Tom-Tom, yours are great!
- Yours are the best.

22
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,379
God, you're so photogenic.

23
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,964
I'll meet you out front.

24
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,592
Do whatever you want. It's not
like she needs a play-by-play.

25
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,223
- Freakazoid.
- See you.

26
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,060
Jenna, could I talk to you
a tiny sec?

27
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,148
I told Chris Grandy me and the
Six Chicks were going to your party.

28
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,318
- And he said he wanted to come with.
- Really?

29
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,864
Yeah, it's too bad we can't make it,
because we really wanted to.

30
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,574
- Didn't we, girls?
- Totally.

31
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,868
- So, so much.
- We're so sorry.

32
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,871
Miss Measly's up our butts
with this group project...

33
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,123
... and Chris is gonna help us out...

34
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,084
... so I guess he can't come either.

35
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,174
<i>- I could write your report for you.
- Fabuloso.</i>

36
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,144
You know, I can't believe
you invited those clones.

37
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,979
They're my friends.

38
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,648
Six Chicks are not your friends, okay?

39
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,359
Well, almost. And someday
I'm gonna be a Six Chick.

40
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:58,572
There's six of them. That's the point.
There can't be a seventh Six Chick.

41
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,616
It's just mathematically impossible.

42
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,327
You're cooler than they are.
They're unoriginal.

43
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,538
I don't wanna be original, Matty,
I wanna be cool.

44
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,792
- Want some Razzles?
- Razzles are for kids.

45
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,378
Exactly.

46
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,511
<i>- Arrivederci.
- Au revoir.</i>

47
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,719
- Hey, sweetie.
- Happy birthday!

48
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,138
Tell us about your new
life as a teenager.

49
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,724
What did you do?
Are you wearing a bra?

50
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,770
- Go away!
- Oh, honey, what's wrong?

51
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,439
Wayne. Self-image.

52
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,443
- Jenna, it's going to be all right.
- It is not, Mom! Look at me!

53
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,156
- This is not okay. This is fatal.
- It's not fatal, honey. It's realistic.

54
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,658
I hate my life.

55
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,160
You don't look like girls
in "Poise" magazine...

56
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,205
... but you're beautiful
in your own way.

57
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,666
I don't wanna be beautiful
in my own way.

58
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,294
I wanna look like these people.

59
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,422
Oh, those aren't people, honey.
Those are models.

60
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,969
"Thirty, flirty and thriving. Why the
30s are the best years of your life."

61
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,637
I wanna be 30.

62
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,515
Well, you will be, honey.

63
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,852
But right now you're my
beautiful 13-year-old.

64
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,385
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, my God.

65
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:29,598
This is just part one of your present.
I got something else to give you later.

66
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,433
What is it?

67
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,021
You know how you always
wanted a Barbie Dream House?

68
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:42,194
Well, I decided to make you
your own Jenna Dream House.

69
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:50,244
- You made all this? Oh, Matty.
- Yeah.

70
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:55,249
See, that's you in your bubble bath,
reading your favorite magazine.

71
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,877
And there's your bedroom,
with a massive stereo...

72
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,296
... and every record ever made.

73
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,923
The good ones.

74
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,554
And there's that bum Rick Springfield
loafing on the couch.

75
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,017
And there I am, to make sure the
creep keeps his hands to himself.

76
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,565
Oh, almost forgot. Wishing dust.

77
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:24,403
It says, "This wishing dust knows
what's in your heart of hearts.

78
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,072
It'll make all your dreams
come true."

79
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,429
They're here.

80
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,431
What do we do?

81
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,060
Oh, my God. Matt, I'm just
gonna put this away, okay?

82
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,146
So there's room to dance.

83
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,151
Put some music on.

84
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,741
Dad, you promised you were
gonna stay upstairs. Go!

85
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,788
Hi, guys. The party's downstairs.

86
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,634
<i>Fabuloso.</i>

87
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,807
- What is this?
- I'm not sure. It's Matt's.

88
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,027
Sorry, Beave-head. Majority rules.

89
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:34,449
Narrow, man.
Narrow, hopeless people.

90
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,202
- Freak.
- Robot.

91
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,251
I'm gonna go next door
and get my Casio.

92
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,754
Do whatever you want, Matt.
It's not like I need a play-by-play.

93
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,675
See you, loser.

94
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,349
Hey, I have an idea, girls.

95
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,894
Let's play
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

96
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,521
You can go first,
because you're the birthday girl.

97
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,398
How does that one go, again?

98
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:10,360
Well, you go in the closet, and some
lucky guy's gonna go in there...

99
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,948
... and do whatever he wants
with you for seven whole minutes.

100
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,951
And guess who wants to go first.

101
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,995
- Who?
- Chris Grandy.

102
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,623
- No way.
- Way.

103
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,091
Before I forget,
where's our project proposal?

104
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,427
- On the table.
- Thanks.

105
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,847
Remember, no peeking.
Keep that blindfold on.

106
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:43,352
And just so you know,
Chris loves going for second base.

107
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,784
Let's go. I think I can get
my brother to buy us some beer.

108
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,419
- I got the cheez doodles.
- Wait, give me that drink.

109
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,172
Thank you. Leave it, George.
Come on.

110
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:20,097
- What's going on?
- Jenna's waiting for you in the closet.

111
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,578
I thought you weren't gonna come.

112
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,297
Where are you?

113
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,470
Oh, Chris.

114
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,641
- It's not Chris, it's Matt.
- What are you doing here?

115
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,687
- Where's Chris?
- He's gone. Everybody left.

116
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,692
- What'd you do?
- Nothing!

117
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,069
- Yes, you did!
- I just went to get my Casio!

118
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,906
- Get out!
- Wait! Jenna, let me talk to you!

119
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,491
- Get out! No!
- Jenna, please, just come out!

120
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,328
I hate you! I hate me!
I hate everybody!

121
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,498
- Jenna, what are you talking about?
- I wanna be 30!

122
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,918
Just let me play you this song, okay?
It'll make you feel better.

123
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:31,210
I wanna be 30.
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

124
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,215
I wanna be 30.
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

125
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,427
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

126
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:45,599
Thirty and flirty and thriving.
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

127
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:50,646
Thirty and flirty and thriving.
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

128
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:54,233
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

129
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,121
Mom?

130
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,755
Mom?

131
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,261
Dad?

132
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,434
What is happening?

133
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:58,190
Oh, what is happening?
What is going on?

134
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:16,083
"Jenna Rink."

135
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,838
"Jenna Rink.
Jenna Rink, Jenna Rink."

136
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,840
I live here.

137
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,764
<i>- Hi. Sorry we missed your call.
- Dad?</i>

138
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,600
<i>Well, not that sorry,
because we're in the Caribbean.</i>

139
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,355
<i>So we'll be back on the 18th,
so call us then. Have a good day.</i>

140
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,692
You went on a cruise without me?

141
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:48,574
Oh, this is a dream.
This is a really weird dream.

142
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:12,598
- Hey, sweet bottom!
- Oh, my God.

143
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:24,151
I know you're there! And my parents
are totally gonna be home any minute!

144
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,779
Hey, where's the conditioner?

145
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:31,283
- You're naked!
- Well, not yet.

146
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,080
You could join me if you want.

147
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,959
Sweet bottom!

148
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,218
Can you hear that music?

149
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,970
Jenna? Can you hurry up
a little bit, please?

150
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,765
He made a commitment.
Jenna? Can you come over here?

151
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,809
I don't care if you have to
grab him by his testicles...

152
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,103
... I want him in New York
in 1 2 hours.

153
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,606
He needs to be at the party.
Hold on a second.

154
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,609
- Get in the car.
- I don't get in the car with strangers.

155
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,778
Get in the car.
We're gonna be late.

156
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:10,113
- I don't know you.
- Just get in the car.

157
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,783
- Not with strangers!
- You're being paranoid.

158
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,036
Sweet bottom! Don't make me
come down there and grab you.

159
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,873
Lucy Wyman. He has my number.
Could you please get in the car?

160
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,667
- Jenna!
- We are gonna be late.

161
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:26,380
Look, he made a commitment. He has
my number. My name is Lucy Wyman.

162
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,798
Just go away!

163
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:35,222
Honey, I know I'm your best friend,
but the slip dress is a little '97.

164
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:38,851
- Unless it's retro.
- Are you really my best friend?

165
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,271
- You're pregnant.
- Oh, no! Oh, my God, no!

166
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,482
Thank God. You scared me.
What did you do last night?

167
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,902
See, that's the thing. Something
really strange is happening.

168
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,780
I slept in an apartment
I've never seen before...

169
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:55,284
... and there was a naked man
in my shower and I saw his thingy.

170
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,077
Oh, God. Not his thingy.

171
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:00,247
Driver, could you please pull over,
since we're here?

172
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,958
- Stop!
- Wait. I don't wanna get out of the--

173
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,170
I don't think you're listening.
Wait, hang on.

174
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:10,382
Wait, listen to me. I'm 1 3.

175
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,552
If you're gonna start lying about
your age, I'd go with 27.

176
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,222
Wait! I know it sounds strange,
but some weird dream is-- Like that!

177
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,433
Do you hear it? Did you hear that?

178
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,770
Would you stop being ridiculous?
It's probably just Richard.

179
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,941
- Who's Richard?
- You drink too much.

180
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,027
Richard, your boss.

181
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:33,864
Brown, curly hair. British. Richard.

182
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,699
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, sweet bottom.</i>

183
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:40,245
You. You. Put on your pants
and stop calling me "sweet bottom."

184
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,498
<i>- Look, baby--
- And get out of my house!</i>

185
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,166
Who is that?

186
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,377
I don't know his name.
I don't know what's happening.

187
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:50,422
Okay, Jenna. Jenna.
Just calm down, okay?

188
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,177
We have a meeting in 1 0 minutes.
I'll tell you what to do. Repeat after me:

189
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:58,889
I am Jenna Rink,
bigtime magazine editor.

190
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,517
- I am?
- Repeat it.

191
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,646
I am Jenna Rink,
bigtime magazine editor.

192
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,064
I'm a tough bitch.

193
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:14,780
- Say it.
- I am a tough bitch.

194
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:18,283
I'm gonna walk into that office,
I won't let anyone know I'm hung-over.

195
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,953
But that's not the point.
I'm not hung-over--

196
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:24,665
I'm gonna walk into that office
and not let anyone know I'm hung-over.

197
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:29,253
Because the future of "Poise"
depends on me.

198
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,922
"Poise"?

199
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,800
Oh, jeez.

200
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,890
"Poise" magazine. Thank you.

201
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,017
Good morning, Miss Rink,
Miss Wyman.

202
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:47,229
- Good morning. What's her name?
- Who cares?

203
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,232
Jenna. Please don't yell at me,
it's not my fault.

204
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,609
They need a decision right now.

205
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,903
- Just pick one.
- That one.

206
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,613
Love. Knew it. Genius.

207
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,408
Eminem's on the phone.
He wants a decision now.

208
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,785
Plain.

209
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,789
Peanut. Plain.

210
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:10,294
There's the dynamic duo! I trust my
executive editors are late again...

211
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,005
... because they were out
promoting us at parties.

212
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,883
- You got it, Richard.
- Richard. You're my boss.

213
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,510
That's right, baby.
Who's your daddy?

214
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:19,887
Wayne Rink.

215
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,264
Morning.

216
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,270
Two words: summer, Saint Barts.

217
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,148
Oh, you're not gonna go
to Fire Island this summer?

218
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,026
- Are you insinuating I'm gay?
- It's a joke.

219
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:46,121
Is there anything else you
need from me, Miss Rink?

220
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,001
You mean like a favor?

221
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,795
Sure. Like a favor.

222
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,423
- I need to find this guy in New Jersey.
- Okay.

223
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,966
I have his number.

224
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:05,349
- Arlene, will you leave us, please?
- Sorry.

225
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,902
Jenna's a little hung-over today.

226
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,656
Rough.

227
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,158
Okay, children.

228
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:39,925
I wonder which one
Holly Housewife is going to go for.

229
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:43,011
The 1 0th or the 1 1th secret?

230
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,358
Seven months in a row now
they scoop us.

231
00:21:56,525 --> 00:22:00,988
I mean, it's like they've got
"Sparkle"-cams hidden in all our walls.

232
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,199
Richard, we're installing passwords.

233
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,577
We're building firewalls
on all the computers.

234
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,996
- Jenna fired Charlotte yesterday.
- Did you?

235
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,750
I guarantee she has friends
at "Sparkle". She always took notes.

236
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:16,420
- She was a secretary.
- Yeah, whatever.

237
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:21,842
Our party tonight is now huge.

238
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,136
We need to make
an unequivocal statement...

239
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:26,513
... that "Poise" is still hot
and happening.

240
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,975
Now, we need a newsstand
circ analysis done immediately.

241
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:33,979
I also strongly suggest we take apart
our F.O.B., overhaul the B.O.B...

242
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:37,316
... think about new heads, decks
and slugs. Jenna, what do you think?

243
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:40,777
Can I go to the bathroom?

244
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,726
It's the naked guy.

245
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:26,657
"Jenna, girl, margaritas anytime.
Love you, Madonna."

246
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm friends with Madonna?

247
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,753
Here are your messages.

248
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,089
And your mother called
from Barbados.

249
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:44,591
My mom called?
I wish you'd told me.

250
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,969
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Rink.

251
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:50,180
I thought you said never
to bother you with family calls.

252
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:53,642
- I did? I said that?
- Please don't fire me.

253
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,062
No, no, I won't. It's not your fault.
I forgot that I said that.

254
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,231
Next time my mom calls,
let me know.

255
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:00,899
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:04,862
Oh, I have that information
that you asked for.

257
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:06,989
Matt!

258
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:10,117
The phone number
you gave me was his parents'.

259
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:13,745
I told them that I worked for Visa
and he's in a lot of trouble.

260
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,290
You lied to the Flamhaffs!

261
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:21,211
He's in the Village.
21 2 Bank Street, apartment 2B.

262
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,715
- Which village?
- The-- Greenwich Village.

263
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,509
Oh, right. Cool.

264
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,513
Wait! Should I cancel
your 2:30 meeting?

265
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:37,436
Sorry.

266
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,231
Excuse me?

267
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,650
Sir?

268
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,071
Hello?

269
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:16,808
<i>Yeah, yeah. Hello. Yeah.</i>

270
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:19,186
Hi, this is Jenna
and I'm looking for Matt.

271
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:22,648
I don't know if you're him,
but if you lived on Spruce Street...

272
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:26,485
... and if your favorite shirt is a gray
velour one, I need to speak to you.

273
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:30,656
<i>Hello? Hello? Hello? You know what?
I got none of that.</i>

274
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:35,285
<i>If you're here from Ming Gardens,
ring twice. If not, I really don't want it.</i>

275
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:46,004
You're not Chinese.

276
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:48,715
- Matt?
- Yeah.

277
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:54,179
You're tall. You're different.

278
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:58,225
- Yeah.
- You don't know me?

279
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:00,727
That's weird, because
yesterday you were there.

280
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:03,272
No, it wasn't yesterday,
because I'm not 13.

281
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,566
- Jenna.
- Yes!

282
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:08,527
- Jenna Rink.
- Yes! Matt, it's me!

283
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:18,871
- Hey.
- Oh, Matty!

284
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:20,873
Come on in.

285
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:27,838
You still take pictures?

286
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:31,842
Yeah. You know, it pays the bills.

287
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:34,178
Hey, Jenna, what are--?
Why are you here?

288
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:38,015
Matty, I told you. Something
really weird is happening.

289
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:41,351
Yesterday was my 1 3th birthday
and then....

290
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,146
And then today I woke up
and I'm this.

291
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:47,191
And you-- I mean, you're that.
You get it?

292
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:52,070
Are you high? You been smoking pot?
Doing X? Falling into a K-hole?

293
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:57,075
- Are you doing drugs?
- No. No. Look...

294
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:01,580
... I was sitting in my closet
and I skipped everything.

295
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,875
I mean, it's like a weird dream.
I can't remember my life.

296
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,002
You need to help me
remember my life.

297
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:09,421
- Me? I can't do that.
- Why not?

298
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,175
I don't know anything
about you, all right?

299
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:16,178
I haven't seen you since high school.

300
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:20,891
- What?
- We're not friends anymore, Jenna.

301
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,770
- Matty, you're my best friend.
- No.

302
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:29,733
Okay. It's cool.

303
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,653
- It's cool.
- Is it warm in here?

304
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,573
It's-- Maybe I should open
a window.

305
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,910
I need fresh air and a glass
of water and a fluffy pillow.

306
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:43,247
Have a seat. I'll get you some--
You want a glass of water?

307
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,999
- You want ice in that?
- I want a fluffy pillow!

308
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,253
A fluffy pillow, coming right up.
Sorry.

309
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,715
You all right?

310
00:27:56,009 --> 00:28:00,848
Jenna, I think you should go back to
your apartment. I'll help you find it.

311
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:06,812
We went separate ways. We went
to different colleges, different careers.

312
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:10,065
Well, what about Christmas?
Didn't you wanna see me then?

313
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:14,653
I think I saw you through a frosted
window once, six years ago.

314
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,030
- Six years ago?
- Yeah.

315
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,283
Wasn't I home last Christmas?

316
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,703
I don't know. Doesn't your crowd
do Saint Barts for Christmas?

317
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,663
I don't know.

318
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,082
Is this you?

319
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:31,253
Yeah. This is where I live now.

320
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:40,596
Okay, so nice seeing you.

321
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:44,725
Good luck.

322
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:49,021
- Okay?
- Okay.

323
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:52,107
- Bye.
- Bye.

324
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:57,529
Matt.

325
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,991
Who is Saint Bart?

326
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:12,211
The most depressing years of my life.
Our high school yearbook.

327
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,837
Matt, was I a Six Chick?

328
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:16,673
Yeah, you were pretty
much their leader.

329
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:23,055
There's Tom-Tom. I wonder
what happened to her.

330
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:27,059
Last I heard, you were still good
friends. I think you even work together.

331
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:30,062
Lucy. Oh, my God, yes.

332
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:34,358
She's Lucy Wyman now.
She looks so different.

333
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:38,695
Yeah, she's pretty big into the
whole plastic surgery movement.

334
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,532
- I was the prom queen.
- Yep.

335
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,369
- And I went with Chris Grandy.
- Yep.

336
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:49,706
Oh, this is incredible. I can't believe it.
I got everything I ever wanted.

337
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:53,794
Yeah, Jenna, you got it all.
Congratulations.

338
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,048
It's your phone.

339
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:07,975
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Gramercy calling to confirm...</i>

340
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,477
<i>...  your limousine pickup
for 8:30 this evening.</i>

341
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:14,273
My-- Yes, my limousine for 8:30.

342
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,942
I will be prepared to take
my ride at that time.

343
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:19,236
Oh, can you tell me where
I'm going?

344
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:23,657
<i>- The Palace, 27 Wall Street.
- Thank you.</i>

345
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:27,327
I'm going to a party in a limo!

346
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:32,541
Great. Looks like you're back to your
old self. I should probably go.

347
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:36,128
- You don't wanna go to the party?
- No, I gotta work. Thanks.

348
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:38,630
Shoot, I forgot you have a job.

349
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:41,758
- It's kind of cool we both have jobs.
- Totally.

350
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:46,388
Well, if you decide you want to come,
it's gonna be fun. 27 Wall Street.

351
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:49,892
Okay, great. Thanks, Jenna.
Bye-bye.

352
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:52,186
Matt.

353
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:57,149
- Yeah.
- What if this isn't just a dream?

354
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:01,028
What if what I wished for
actually happened?

355
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:05,824
Then you got everything you ever
wanted. You might as well enjoy it.

356
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:09,119
All right, Jenna.

357
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,668
- Matty.
- Yeah.

358
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:20,506
<i>- Arrivederci.
- I'll see you.</i>

359
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:23,217
- Matt.
- Yeah.

360
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:25,928
<i>Au revoir.</i>

361
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:03,817
- I'm Jenna, by the way.
- Yeah, I know. I'm Becky.

362
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:06,028
How old are you, anyway?

363
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:08,864
- Thirteen.
- Me too.

364
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:11,283
Used to be.

365
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,205
Why are you talking to me?

366
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:20,709
- Why not? We are neighbors, right?
- But you usually ignore me.

367
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:27,090
- I like your shoes.
- Thanks.

368
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:28,509
I like your dress.

369
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:32,179
It's because I've got these
incredible boobs to fill it out.

370
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,099
- I like your bag.
- Thanks.

371
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:39,144
You should come by sometime.
I've got a zillion of them.

372
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:42,356
- Really?
- Yeah, it'd be totally cool.

373
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,733
Hey, Becky?

374
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,195
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

375
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:51,698
Can you tell I'm wearing underwear?
Because I totally am.

376
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:55,410
I think that's kind of the point.

377
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:22,229
Try it. It's soft-shell crab.

378
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,827
Thanks.

379
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:51,300
Hi, Tom-Tom.

380
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:54,553
Oh, God, no one's called me that
since I had my nose job.

381
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,681
- You had a nose job?
- Yeah, and yours is better.

382
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:00,100
Anything to drink, ladies?

383
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:04,188
- An apple martini.
- Can I have a lemonade, please?

384
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:08,442
Oh, wait. Make it
a piña colada, not virgin.

385
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,819
Do you wanna see my ID?
Totally have it.

386
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,738
There you two are.

387
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:15,782
Lucy, very nice.

388
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,993
Sort of a dangerous mermaid look.

389
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,205
And you.... Barbie meets Britney.

390
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,540
You look just
"scrum-didlee-umpcious"!

391
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,584
I know. I mean, thank you.

392
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:28,837
Everybody Wang Chung tonight,
right?

393
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:33,425
Here you go.

394
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:39,223
Thank you.

395
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:43,018
- I'm sorry, it's late.
- We're keeping you up, are we?

396
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:45,646
It's only 1 1 :00. Stay a while.

397
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:56,240
It's 11:00 on a school night
and I'm at a party. It's so cool.

398
00:35:56,448 --> 00:36:00,035
It's 11:00 and people are leaving.
This is a disaster.

399
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:01,662
It is?

400
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,665
Speaking of disasters,
what is she doing here?

401
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:07,251
- Who?
- "Sparkle's" editor in chief, Trish Sackett.

402
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,920
Twelve o'clock and headed our way.

403
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:15,509
Hi, girls. Our J. Lo issue is selling
like hotcakes. How's yours doing?

404
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:19,763
My God, are things so bad you had
to come to our party to eat free food?

405
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,974
Put some crab
in your purse for later.

406
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,811
You might want to keep some
of that biting wit for your magazine.

407
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:29,147
Or you could change the name
to something more appropriate...

408
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:33,652
... like "Poison" or "Pitiful".
Whatever's more pathetic.

409
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:35,320
You know what?

410
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:40,701
You are rude and mean and sloppy
and frizzy. I don't like you at all.

411
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:43,579
Well, fortunately,
I don't care about being liked.

412
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:46,123
- I care about winning.
- This is delicious.

413
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,669
Ladies.

414
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,136
Do I smell?

415
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:01,263
Do I have bad breath?

416
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:06,226
- Am I malodorous in any way?
- No.

417
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:10,189
People seem to be running for the exit
like someone set off a stink bomb.

418
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,607
I don't smell anything.

419
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:13,984
I think he means
the party is a stinker.

420
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:18,614
A dud. A flop. A zero
on a scale of one to 1 0.

421
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:21,825
Maybe if somebody
played something else.

422
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,453
- Something with a melody.
- Play whatever you want.

423
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:29,124
All I know is if those people don't
start dancing really, really soon....

424
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:33,045
Here's to early retirement.

425
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:51,123
Matty! Matty, come here.

426
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,420
- Hey.
- Matty, come here.

427
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,630
"Thriller." Matty.

428
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,758
Me? No, no, no, no.
Take that thing away.

429
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:04,887
- "Thriller." Come on.
- No way.

430
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,972
Come on, man! Go!

431
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,141
Jenna, no way.

432
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:11,101
Come on, let's go.

433
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,936
I don't remember those moves.

434
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:16,732
I haven't done this in 1 5 years.
What are you, crazy?

435
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,449
Tear it up, dude!

436
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,833
- Come on, Matty.
- All right, all right.

437
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:40,672
Okay, here we go.

438
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:59,274
Go, Arlene!

439
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:06,573
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, Jenna!

440
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,308
Go, Richard!

441
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:55,706
- Jenna. I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- What do you--?

442
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:58,417
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. Don't.

443
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,794
Matt.

444
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,548
Groove on, baby!

445
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:12,222
I adore you!

446
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:39,500
- Miss, wait! Miss, wait!
- Your credit card. Your credit card!

447
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:22,668
- Thank you.
- To being 30.

448
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:25,712
- I've decided it's gonna be awesome.
- Of course it is.

449
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:29,299
You're thin, you're hot, you can
get any guy you want, "biatch."

450
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:33,303
Not to mention, biatch, the hottest
magazine editor in the world.

451
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,138
Second hottest.

452
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:37,391
- Tied for first?
- Deal.

453
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:41,019
And speaking of hot....

454
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:45,232
Mr. Hotty behind you is totally
scamming on you right now.

455
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:58,620
He is not. He's totally cute.

456
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,540
- Should I go talk to him?
- You're not married.

457
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,296
Good.

458
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:18,557
Hi.

459
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:22,895
Could I borrow your ketchup?

460
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,730
Sure.

461
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:29,902
I actually came over here...

462
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:32,321
... because I think you're really cute.

463
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:38,076
- So do you wanna go out sometime?
- Yeah. Can you drive?

464
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:42,206
Time to go. What, do you wanna
go to jail? I meant that guy.

465
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:44,166
The man? Oh, gross.

466
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:48,086
No more daiquiris for you tonight.

467
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:51,089
You can never find a taxi
in this neighborhood.

468
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:53,926
Oh, my God. It's the naked man.

469
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:56,595
- Hey, beautiful.
- He thinks I'm beautiful?

470
00:43:56,762 --> 00:44:01,141
- Well, he should. He's your boyfriend.
- My boyfriend?

471
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:05,562
Why is that lady asking
for my boyfriend's autograph?

472
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,022
Thank you so much.

473
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:09,233
He may not be
the best New York Ranger...

474
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:11,527
... but he's the Ranger
with the best ass.

475
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:14,696
Jenna?

476
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:17,699
- Oh, my God. Matt. Hi!
- Hey.

477
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:20,577
How are you?

478
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:23,914
I'm sorry about the other night.

479
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:27,543
- Beaver, is that you?
- Hey, Tom-Tom. How are you?

480
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:29,837
You lost all your baby fat.

481
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:33,799
- How does the Beave stay warm?
- Yeah, it's good to see you again too.

482
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:36,677
I almost didn't recognize you.
Did you get a nose job?

483
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:39,263
I can't believe you're here.
What're you doing?

484
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:43,767
I'm-- I'm actually-- I'm doing
some shopping with my....

485
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:46,144
Jenna, this is Wendy, my fiancée.

486
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,149
- I'm Jenna.
- Matt told me about...

487
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:53,986
... his blast from the past.
It was really sweet of you to stop by.

488
00:44:54,153 --> 00:44:57,364
Matty's the sweet one. I don't know
what I'd have done without him.

489
00:44:57,531 --> 00:45:00,325
- I'm sure you'll be fine.
- Are you a photographer too?

490
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:03,328
I see you guys have spent
so much time talking about me.

491
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:05,831
- Wendy's an anchorwoman.
- Anchorperson.

492
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,834
I do the weather for WWEN
in Chicago.

493
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:12,838
Matt and I were just talking about him
finally joining me in the Windy City.

494
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:17,676
- You're moving to Chicago?
- We were just discu--

495
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:20,179
We haven't really--
Is that Alex Carlson?

496
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:23,182
Jenna, sorry. Sorry I'm late.

497
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:24,683
Well, hi.

498
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:27,352
- Hey. Who are you folks?
- Hey.

499
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,023
I'm sorry. This is my good friend Matt
and this is his friend, Wendy.

500
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:37,321
- Fiancée.
- Right. So weird. And this is....

501
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:41,867
You're Alex Carlson. Nice to meet you.
You're a great hockey player.

502
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:43,535
- I'm a big fan.
- Thank you.

503
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:48,207
You want me to sign your shirt or
your forehead? Now, I don't do butts.

504
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,709
I'm just joshing you. Sorry.

505
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:54,963
I crack a lot of jokes after we win, on
account of I'm in such a good mood.

506
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:00,928
Okay, well, we should
probably get going.

507
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:03,597
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you folks.

508
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:06,892
Nice to see you folks. Bye.

509
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,065
You mind if I steal her
from you for the night?

510
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:16,360
Nope. I actually had my eye
on something better inside...

511
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:19,988
... so I'll see you guys later.
Have a good night.

512
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:22,866
Excuse me one second. Lucy?

513
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:27,287
Should I go to his place alone?

514
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:31,708
Yeah. Why not?
Go play. You deserve it.

515
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:34,753
Play. You mean
like games and stuff?

516
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:41,301
Yeah, games. All kinds of games.

517
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:56,066
I couldn't wait to see you tonight.

518
00:46:57,401 --> 00:46:59,278
You wanna play a game?

519
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:02,447
- Do you have Battleship?
- Yeah, I have Battleship.

520
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:05,534
I'll show you my destroyer.

521
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:09,580
- I call the red board.
- Well, I call the blue board.

522
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:19,882
What?

523
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:27,389
Okay. I know. I forgot.

524
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:32,144
I owe you one raunchy striptease.

525
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:44,615
Oh, God.

526
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,826
Oh, gross.

527
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:59,338
Who's got the moves
on the ice and off the ice, ice, baby?

528
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:03,842
Wait! Wait! Wait! I don't wanna see
that thing again. Put it away.

529
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:05,844
Put it away!

530
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:08,055
God.

531
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:17,648
We can play Monopoly!
We can play Parcheesi!

532
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:21,360
He didn't have Battleship.
He didn't have any games.

533
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:23,070
Boys are so stupid.

534
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:25,948
Becky, it's even worse than you think.

535
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:28,742
How come the ones
that you like never like you?

536
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:33,205
Well, you have to fight for what
you want. Rule number one:

537
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:35,624
Love is a battlefield.

538
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:39,920
That's deep. Really deep.

539
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:43,882
- Good luck with fractions.
- Have fun at work.

540
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:47,636
To the office, Tom.

541
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,266
"Fifty-seven ways to have an orgasm."

542
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:53,308
"Fifty-seven ways to have an orgasm."

543
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:57,855
- I didn't know there were 57.
- "T ouch-her-there underwear."

544
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:00,232
No.

545
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:02,818
"He loves you, but...."

546
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:05,404
- "He loves your butt."
- Yes.

547
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:08,282
- "He lies, he cheats...
- So typical.

548
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:11,410
... what are you doing wrong?"

549
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:19,793
There's no easy way of saying this,
so I'm just gonna come out with it.

550
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:25,632
The circs are in.
Our numbers are dismal.

551
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:31,180
We're below 600,000 total circulation.
"Sparkle" is closing in on a million.

552
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:37,436
I've come off the phone with corporate
and they have dropped the R word.

553
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:39,730
Redesign?

554
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:41,773
Redesign "Poise"?

555
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,568
Wait. "Sparkle" copies everything
we come up with...

556
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:46,904
... and we have to redesign?
That's bullshit.

557
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:53,035
Well, either we redesign and bring up
our numbers or they pull the plug.

558
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:55,579
Richard, redesign is a death sentence.

559
00:49:55,746 --> 00:49:59,541
No, it's not. It's a chance
to have some fun.

560
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:04,880
Let "Sparkle" have all our
secondhand, stale, grody ideas.

561
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:07,758
We'll open up the F.O.B.,
overhaul the B.O.B.

562
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:11,053
It's time for us to prove
we have some poise left.

563
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:16,225
Well, I shall be leaving it
to my dynamic duo...

564
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:18,894
... to come up with something
utterly fabulous.

565
00:50:20,604 --> 00:50:25,317
We have two weeks,
four hours and 30 minutes.

566
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:29,112
- I have your urgent messages.
- Let's hear them.

567
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,448
Well, okay.

568
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:34,326
Emily Pratt called
and wanted me to tell you:

569
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:38,372
"I can't believe you scooped my story
on Vivienne Tam, you backbiting bitch.

570
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:40,791
That was a new level
of sleaze, even for you.

571
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:43,335
I hope you die in one
of her casual pantsuits."

572
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:46,463
Oh, my God, that was so mean.

573
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:50,884
Miss Lewis called. She said,
"I hope you choke on your own bile...

574
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:55,013
... you pretentious, conniving snake."

575
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,474
- Maybe I should read them myself.
- Good.

576
00:50:57,641 --> 00:51:00,102
Oh, great.

577
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:07,276
<i>- Miss Rink's line.
- Put that little bitch on the phone now.</i>

578
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:10,237
Please don't take that tone.
I'm just her assistant.

579
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:11,655
<i>Tell her to call Todd.</i>

580
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:18,120
"Sweet bottom, you seem uptight.
Let me come over and give you my...."

581
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:29,089
- Yes.
- Alex is on line one, Miss Rink.

582
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:33,093
<i>Oh, gag me. Can you
please tell him I'm busy?</i>

583
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,014
Okay, but he wants to know
what time would be good for dinner.

584
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:40,559
How about in 1 0 zillion years?
Ask him how that works.

585
00:51:40,726 --> 00:51:44,021
<i>- Okay, I'll ask.
- Okay.</i>

586
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:50,360
<i>- Yeah?
- I'm sorry to bother you again.</i>

587
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,821
<i>- Pete Hansen is here to see you.
- Who?</i>

588
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:56,283
<i>Tracy from the
art department's husband.</i>

589
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:59,244
Oh, okay. Sure.

590
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:14,384
I was just dropping off Tracy's lunch,
thought I'd say hello.

591
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:20,182
You brought Tracy her lunch?
That's so sw--

592
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,521
What are you doing?

593
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:27,439
What's wrong, pooky?

594
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:29,316
"Pooky"?

595
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:33,028
Pukey. You're married,
and to a girl I work with.

596
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:37,074
Well, that didn't stop us from rattling
some desk drawers loose last week.

597
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:41,537
So come on.
Lie down and take a memo.

598
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:54,174
Listen, hire the best photographer,
and I don't want Jenna to find out.

599
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:56,343
- No. Roger that.
- Okay?

600
00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:00,472
God, what is up with her lately,
anyway? I mean, she seems so lost.

601
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:04,101
I have no idea. I'm getting
so sick of having her around...

602
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:06,603
... with this crazy new act
she has going on.

603
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:09,815
You know how she stole
Charlotte's idea and then fired her?

604
00:53:09,982 --> 00:53:12,317
I say we go ahead
with our own presentation...

605
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:14,278
... and let her fall on her ass.

606
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:16,613
Oh, God, yeah.

607
00:53:47,978 --> 00:53:50,522
Okay, you're not Cajun.

608
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:55,611
- Wanna go for a walk?
- Sure.

609
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:05,329
I still can't believe
you're getting married.

610
00:54:05,496 --> 00:54:08,290
In two weeks.

611
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:13,837
Is she your soul mate, Wendy?

612
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:19,927
My soul mate? I don't know if I believe
in those. I think that's kind of naive.

613
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:24,515
But you get goose bumps
when you're around her...

614
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:26,725
... and butterflies?

615
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:32,022
No, I haven't gotten crazy like that
about a girl since high school.

616
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:34,608
Matty.

617
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:39,696
What--? What happened to us?

618
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:42,366
I mean, how come
we never stayed friends?

619
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:46,578
I don't know. I forget.

620
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:49,122
No, what happened?

621
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:54,044
I don't know. I can pretty much
peg it to your 1 3th birthday party...

622
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:56,880
... when you were playing that game.
Spin the Rapist?

623
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:59,174
Seven Minutes in Heaven.
Everybody ditched.

624
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:01,677
And that is the last thing I remember.

625
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:05,389
We don't have to get into this.
It's a long time ago.

626
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:08,517
- It really doesn't matter anymore.
- It matters to me.

627
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:10,644
Just tell me.

628
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:15,482
You came out of the closet...

629
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:18,986
... and I started to sing
my birthday song to you.

630
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:22,197
And then you picked up
and threw at me...

631
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:24,408
... with impressive force, I might add...

632
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:27,995
... the dream house that I spent
three weeks building for you.

633
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:31,331
And then you just stopped
being my friend...

634
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:35,419
... and you never spoke to me
again after that, ever.

635
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:41,091
I'm so sorry.

636
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:44,678
Forget it, Jenna. It was a long
time ago. It doesn't matter.

637
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:48,390
Matt, stop being so nice to me.
I don't deserve it.

638
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:52,102
Do you know what
kind of person I am now?

639
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:55,189
Do you know who I am right now? I....

640
00:55:57,357 --> 00:56:00,194
I don't have any real friends. I....

641
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,322
I did something bad
with a married guy.

642
00:56:03,489 --> 00:56:06,408
I don't talk to my mom and dad.

643
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:10,204
I'm not a nice person.
And the thing is...

644
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:13,957
... I'm not 13 anymore.

645
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:20,339
Jenna.

646
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,774
Behind you.

647
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:14,912
Oh, it's good to be home.

648
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:26,298
- Daddy.
- Jenna?

649
00:58:26,465 --> 00:58:28,884
What in the world?

650
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:31,803
- Sweetheart.
- I missed you guys so much.

651
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,389
Are you all right?

652
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:40,539
Mom.

653
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:44,168
Do you ever wish you could go back...

654
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:45,961
... like to another time?

655
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:49,548
I wouldn't mind giving back
some of these wrinkles.

656
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:52,467
Okay.

657
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:58,557
If you were given one do-over,
anything in your life, what would it be?

658
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,523
Nothing.

659
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:09,693
- Really?
- Really.

660
01:00:09,902 --> 01:00:12,362
But did you ever make
a big mistake?

661
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:16,033
Or a huge one that could
change your life? What about that?

662
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:18,952
Well, Jenna, I know
I made a lot of mistakes...

663
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,663
... but I don't regret
making any of them.

664
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:23,749
How come?

665
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:26,585
Because if I hadn't have
made them...

666
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:29,713
... I wouldn't have learned
how to make things right.

667
01:00:38,222 --> 01:00:41,016
I'm sorry I missed last Christmas.

668
01:01:21,974 --> 01:01:24,434
Carrie, I'm heading out, okay?

669
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,106
I'm so exhausted.

670
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:31,108
- Jenna's working late.
- She has been.

671
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:43,871
- Hey.
- Hey.

672
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:47,708
I was gonna stop by your office.
I tried to call you a bunch of times.

673
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:51,837
- I didn't get any messages.
- I was in a hurry.

674
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:54,298
But I did try to reach you.

675
01:01:54,464 --> 01:01:58,760
I actually wanted to talk to you
about this whole redesign thing.

676
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:02,347
I hope you don't mind, but I've been
working on something on my own.

677
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:05,309
It's really last-minute.

678
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:09,188
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, of course not...

679
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:11,857
... because I'm doing the same thing.

680
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:27,372
- Hey, Jenna.
- Hey.

681
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:30,417
Someone's got
a big photo shoot going on.

682
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:32,294
- Yeah.
- What's happening?

683
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:35,380
- Did you bring them?
- Oh, yeah, I got a few.

684
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:38,050
- What are you doing?
- I'm hiring you.

685
01:02:38,217 --> 01:02:41,428
Actually, "Poise"
is hiring you for the week.

686
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:43,889
Here.

687
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:53,315
This is the first half.
The rest when we finish.

688
01:02:53,482 --> 01:02:56,860
I could really use this, but you
don't need to do me any favors.

689
01:02:57,027 --> 01:03:00,113
I'm asking you to do me a favor.
I love your work.

690
01:03:01,156 --> 01:03:02,908
I hope you'll do this with me.

691
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:10,541
You know, I've seen your magazine.
My stuff is not your style at all.

692
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:14,837
Exactly.

693
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:18,298
Who gets Francis?

694
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:22,010
There we go.
Okay, let's do it.

695
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:24,388
Up, up!

696
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:27,266
- Okay, everybody.
- Okay, everybody, climb up there.

697
01:03:27,432 --> 01:03:29,184
Lots of energy.

698
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:32,771
- All right. Nice. You're the real deal.
- Keep up the flag.

699
01:03:32,938 --> 01:03:37,067
All right. Jenna, this is
your class of 2004.

700
01:03:37,276 --> 01:03:39,528
All right, guys. Ready?

701
01:03:49,955 --> 01:03:53,041
Very good. Very good.

702
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:23,173
- They're beautiful.
- Yeah, they came out okay, huh?

703
01:05:23,382 --> 01:05:24,716
- I think so.
- Yeah.

704
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:27,511
- Do you?
- I do, yeah.

705
01:05:36,436 --> 01:05:38,772
Yeah, it's getting late.
I should get home.

706
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:41,024
It's getting pretty late here.

707
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:44,194
You know what I wish I had
right now?

708
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:46,155
No, what?

709
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:48,407
Razzles.

710
01:05:48,574 --> 01:05:50,617
Razzles?

711
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:54,204
I haven't had Razzles...

712
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:57,040
- ... in 1 5 years.
- Remember...

713
01:05:57,249 --> 01:06:00,002
- ... they're both a candy and a gum.
- That's incredible.

714
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:03,422
I can't believe they had them.
Okay, don't waste a minute.

715
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:06,592
It's been a long time. Careful.

716
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:09,720
Yeah.

717
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:13,891
What are you laughing at?

718
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:15,642
I don't know.

719
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:19,855
Life. Timing. Being here with you,
eating Razzles.

720
01:06:24,568 --> 01:06:27,446
I've had a really great time
working with you this week.

721
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:28,906
- Me too.
- And everything.

722
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:30,741
Yeah.

723
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:34,495
Hey, Matty.

724
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,915
Tell me something.

725
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:40,167
What color is my tongue?

726
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:42,586
- What?
- What color is my tongue?

727
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,755
It's red. I don't know. Red.

728
01:06:44,922 --> 01:06:47,090
"Red" red? Or tongue red?

729
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:49,468
Razzle red.

730
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:51,136
- Show me yours.
- What?

731
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:54,181
- Your tongue. I showed you mine.
- I'm not showing you.

732
01:06:54,348 --> 01:06:56,391
Show me your tongue.
I showed you mine.

733
01:06:56,558 --> 01:06:59,728
- I didn't ask to see yours.
- Matty, I need to see your tongue.

734
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:04,191
Razzle red.

735
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,780
You wanna know a secret?

736
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:12,866
Yeah.

737
01:07:13,033 --> 01:07:15,369
You're the sweetest guy
I've ever known.

738
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:22,501
I bet I can still beat you off the jump.

739
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:28,841
Whoever goes the furthest,
the other owes a drink.

740
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:31,176
- An Orange Julius.
- Upping the stakes.

741
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:34,429
And dinner Friday night at 8:00...

742
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:37,057
... at the 24th Street Diner...

743
01:07:37,224 --> 01:07:39,810
... to celebrate our redesign
being chosen.

744
01:07:39,977 --> 01:07:42,229
Deal. One.

745
01:07:44,189 --> 01:07:46,275
- Two.
- Two.

746
01:07:47,276 --> 01:07:48,986
- Three!
- Three!

747
01:07:52,156 --> 01:07:53,532
Are you okay?

748
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:55,826
I should've tucked and rolled.

749
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:57,661
I'm getting old.

750
01:07:57,828 --> 01:07:59,830
No, you're not,
because that means I am.

751
01:07:59,997 --> 01:08:01,415
Well?

752
01:08:07,671 --> 01:08:08,964
- Hey.
- Yeah?

753
01:08:09,131 --> 01:08:11,091
You got arm hair.

754
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:15,345
It's never quite got
that reaction before.

755
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:51,048
<i>It was like it wasn't even me.</i>

756
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:53,217
<i>Like I had just...</i>

757
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:56,720
<i>... watched us down below, kissing.</i>

758
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,933
Then I just floated home on a cloud.

759
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:05,729
That is so romantic.

760
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:11,276
- Look.
- You've got goose bumps.

761
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:14,071
I totally know. They won't go away.

762
01:09:14,947 --> 01:09:16,490
Do you love him?

763
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:18,534
Duh.

764
01:09:19,243 --> 01:09:20,953
When will you see him again?

765
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:23,705
I don't know, actually.
I don't know if I can.

766
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:27,209
- What? Why?
- It's complicated.

767
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:29,503
It's a grownup thing.

768
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:33,757
Well, at least you have
someone to dream about.

769
01:09:33,966 --> 01:09:36,885
Guys don't wanna jump your bones
when you're a metal-mouth.

770
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:40,139
What is that attitude?
We are young.

771
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:45,018
Heartache to heartache, we stand.

772
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:48,647
Love is a battlefield.

773
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:24,641
But I like it like this,
with freckle girl and the dog.

774
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:28,437
- These photos are unbelievable, Jen.
- Okay, here's the dog.

775
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:31,315
- Francis is the dog's name.
- Okay. What do you think?

776
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:35,944
Well, I think I'm gonna start reading
"Poise" for the first time in my life.

777
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:55,214
No, I got a place I rent in Brooklyn.

778
01:10:55,672 --> 01:11:00,135
That'll work? All right,
I'll see you then. Bye-bye.

779
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:08,018
Hey. I wasn't expecting to see you--

780
01:11:08,185 --> 01:11:10,938
Wendy. I thought you were
flying in tomorrow.

781
01:11:11,104 --> 01:11:13,690
What, are you expecting
someone else?

782
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:15,734
No. Hi.

783
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:17,861
I wanna take you to lunch. Hungry?

784
01:11:18,028 --> 01:11:21,406
Yeah, yeah. What a surprise.

785
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:23,158
Okay, where do you...?

786
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:25,661
- How was your flight?
- It was good.

787
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:28,705
<i>You can take pictures of
vitamin bottles anywhere.</i>

788
01:11:28,872 --> 01:11:32,042
And I was just thinking that we
should try to resolve this now.

789
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:37,214
Instead of being a commuter couple
during our first year of marriage.

790
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:40,551
What?

791
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:42,719
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

792
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:45,430
Could you...? I missed that.

793
01:11:46,723 --> 01:11:48,809
- Arlene, do you have any more--?
- Jenna.

794
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:52,271
My balls, excuse my French,
are in an iron vice.

795
01:11:52,437 --> 01:11:56,233
Corporate are twisting like a bunch
of dominatrixes on steroids.

796
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,736
Now Lucy's presenting her own
redesign. Tell me what's going on.

797
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:02,281
What is going on is you
will have more choices.

798
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:06,368
All respect to Lucy, I'm more anxious
to know what you're working on.

799
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:08,579
- Thank you.
- I'm not complimenting you...

800
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:10,289
... I'm trying to pressure you.

801
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:13,250
How long until your balls
get totally squished?

802
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:16,253
Hopefully never. I'm really rather
attached to my balls.

803
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,380
Can they hang in there till 5?

804
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:21,592
Jenna, you are not yourself
at the moment.

805
01:12:21,758 --> 01:12:26,096
Since when do you keep me out of
the loop? I'm really freaking out here.

806
01:12:26,263 --> 01:12:29,141
- The rest of the prints are ready.
- Goody. Hang in there.

807
01:12:29,308 --> 01:12:31,226
Why does nobody listen
to a word I say?

808
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:33,812
Arlene, aren't you coming?

809
01:12:33,979 --> 01:12:37,399
Oh, you're invited, are you?
Okay, bye-bye.

810
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:40,110
Oh, no, excuse me.
Go ahead.

811
01:12:40,986 --> 01:12:42,988
You know, what am I?
I'm just the...

812
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:46,950
... editor in chief. Whatever.

813
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:51,413
We've gotta go to 23rd, please,
between 5th and 6th.

814
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:55,083
- It's 29 West 23rd.
- You got it, lady.

815
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,878
The new and improved "Poise"
will explore the last frontier.

816
01:12:57,878 --> 01:13:00,631
The new and improved "Poise"
will explore the last frontier.

817
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:03,425
It will go heroin chic one better.

818
01:13:03,592 --> 01:13:05,177
It will OD.

819
01:13:05,344 --> 01:13:08,138
It will kill.

820
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:11,475
Cause of death? Chicness.

821
01:13:11,683 --> 01:13:17,022
The new "Poise" will go farther than
any fashion magazine ever before.

822
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:20,317
It will be deadly serious.

823
01:13:20,484 --> 01:13:22,986
Fashion suicide.

824
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:28,784
So, what do you think?

825
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:40,671
Thank you, sir.

826
01:13:40,838 --> 01:13:43,590
- How much time do we have?
- We have two minutes. Hurry.

827
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:52,015
Jeez. Such a bitch.

828
01:14:01,525 --> 01:14:03,527
I know this is different.

829
01:14:03,694 --> 01:14:06,280
I mean, from anything
we've ever done.

830
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:11,118
And I know you might hate it
and think I'm completely crazy.

831
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:14,872
But I won't care, even if I get fired.

832
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:19,835
And I don't mean that disrespectfully,
it's just that I've realized something.

833
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:24,214
Who are these women?

834
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:26,049
Does anyone know?

835
01:14:26,258 --> 01:14:28,802
I don't recognize any of them.

836
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:35,767
I wanna see...

837
01:14:35,934 --> 01:14:39,062
... my best friend's big sister...

838
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:43,650
... and the girls from the
soccer team.

839
01:14:44,193 --> 01:14:46,403
My next-door neighbor.

840
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:49,907
Real women who are smart and pretty
and happy to be who they are.

841
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:52,493
These are the women
to look up to.

842
01:14:57,372 --> 01:15:00,542
Let's put life back
into the magazine.

843
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:05,339
And fun and laughter and silliness.

844
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:11,512
I think we all-- I think all of us
wanna feel something...

845
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:15,933
... that we've forgotten
or turned our backs on.

846
01:15:16,809 --> 01:15:21,104
Because maybe we didn't realize
how much we were leaving behind.

847
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:30,864
We need to remember
what used to be good.

848
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:39,873
If we don't...

849
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:44,002
... we won't recognize it
even if it hits us between the eyes.

850
01:15:47,464 --> 01:15:49,299
I just....

851
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:54,972
Bravo!

852
01:15:59,143 --> 01:16:01,603
Brilliant.

853
01:16:03,564 --> 01:16:08,068
We will present this to corporate
first thing tomorrow morning.

854
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:16,451
- So who's this mystery photographer?
- Matt Flamhaff.

855
01:16:16,618 --> 01:16:18,537
Is he Arthur or Martha?

856
01:16:18,704 --> 01:16:20,372
Matt. He's Matt.

857
01:16:20,539 --> 01:16:24,084
No, no. Is he gay?

858
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:26,628
Are you gay?

859
01:17:36,949 --> 01:17:38,909
<i>- City and listing?
- Manhattan.</i>

860
01:17:39,076 --> 01:17:42,162
"Sparkle" magazine on Park Avenue.

861
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,749
- Sparkle magazine.
- Trish Sackett, please.

862
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:03,183
Jenna, I'm sorry to barge in on you like
this, but I really have to talk to you--

863
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,894
Hey, Beaver.

864
01:18:06,061 --> 01:18:08,730
I mean Matt. I'm sorry.

865
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:10,440
Old habits die hard, you know.

866
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:11,859
Fine. Is Jenna around?

867
01:18:12,025 --> 01:18:15,404
Are you here about your photos?

868
01:18:16,155 --> 01:18:18,824
No, actually, I'm not.

869
01:18:18,991 --> 01:18:21,076
I guess I should just tell you...

870
01:18:21,243 --> 01:18:24,496
... that Jenna's decided to go
in a different direction...

871
01:18:24,663 --> 01:18:28,876
... with a more established
photographer.

872
01:18:29,042 --> 01:18:34,756
She's gonna use the guy who shoots
the official photos of her sweetie pie.

873
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:38,594
So don't take it personally,
because there's just a little bias.

874
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:42,306
I'm sorry to be so honest
with you, because...

875
01:18:42,473 --> 01:18:45,142
... I think your pictures
are really cute.

876
01:18:45,309 --> 01:18:47,060
It was nice talking to you.

877
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:50,981
Hey, Matt. While I've got you here,
do you wanna sign a general release?

878
01:18:51,148 --> 01:18:53,442
Maybe we can use your
pictures in a catalog.

879
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:55,402
Fine.

880
01:19:57,589 --> 01:19:58,882
Hi.

881
01:19:59,049 --> 01:20:02,177
- Jenny, right?
- Jenna.

882
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:04,429
I was looking for Matt.

883
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:07,975
I wanted to tell him some really great
news about his photographs.

884
01:20:08,142 --> 01:20:09,393
Everybody loved them.

885
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,230
That's great. I'll tell him when he gets
back. He's out getting his tux.

886
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:16,233
- His tux?
- I know. Men.

887
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:18,152
Everything's the last minute.

888
01:20:18,318 --> 01:20:20,696
I mean, hello. We're getting
married tomorrow.

889
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:25,284
This'll be the cutest little backyard
wedding since I don't know when.

890
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:28,412
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. I'll tell Matt you stopped by.

891
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:30,747
- Okay.
- Bye.

892
01:20:40,674 --> 01:20:45,012
We wanna feel something
again that we've forgotten.

893
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:48,599
Because we didn't stop to notice
how much we were leaving behind.

894
01:20:49,433 --> 01:20:52,769
We need to remember
what used to be good.

895
01:20:56,773 --> 01:20:58,025
You ready?

896
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:01,987
The meeting's cancelled, Jenna.

897
01:21:02,154 --> 01:21:03,780
What, until tomorrow?

898
01:21:03,989 --> 01:21:05,449
It's over.

899
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:08,702
It's over?

900
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:11,872
Lucy....

901
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:15,250
She took all your designs
to "Sparkle". Everything.

902
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:17,461
She's their new editor in chief.

903
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:20,214
Your photos showed up
in "Sparkle Online" last night.

904
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,132
They're in outdoor ads everywhere.

905
01:21:22,299 --> 01:21:24,468
She can't take Matt's pictures.
Those belong to us.

906
01:21:24,635 --> 01:21:27,846
- She can't do it!
- She can, and she is.

907
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:30,516
She got him to sign this.

908
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:38,607
Lucy, you stole Matt's pictures.

909
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:42,402
Oh, which one do you wanna be
today, the pot or the kettle?

910
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:44,655
If you don't mind,
I'd like to be the pot.

911
01:21:44,863 --> 01:21:47,866
Maybe the kettle. It doesn't really
matter. They're both black.

912
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:51,578
- What are you talking about?
- I found this in your office yesterday.

913
01:21:51,745 --> 01:21:54,206
Does it look familiar?
It has your name on it.

914
01:21:54,373 --> 01:21:57,501
- You went through my things?
- Oh, give me a break.

915
01:21:57,709 --> 01:22:00,337
How horrible. How terrible.
I can't believe I did it.

916
01:22:00,546 --> 01:22:01,964
What is this?

917
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:05,175
You can wipe off the "Bambi
watching her mother get shot...

918
01:22:05,342 --> 01:22:08,220
... and strapped to the back of
a van" look from your face.

919
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:10,472
I talked to Trish Sackett yesterday.

920
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,725
It's okay, Jenna. I know all
about your little deal.

921
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:15,894
It's a sweet little deal, actually.

922
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:18,772
Editor in chief if you help them
hit a million copies?

923
01:22:18,939 --> 01:22:20,816
- So you'd give them tips.
- Oh, my God.

924
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:24,903
Not bad. I just wish I would
have thought of it.

925
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:27,823
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

926
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:31,160
Only, now I'm taking your job,
you stay here with the magazine...

927
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:33,412
... you single-handedly flushed
down the toilet.

928
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:35,414
What about Matt?

929
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:37,958
Why did he sign this?
What did you say to him?

930
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:40,294
Let's see. I think that I told him...

931
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:43,380
... you had decided to go
in a different direction.

932
01:22:43,755 --> 01:22:45,507
Which you are now.

933
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:52,639
I might have told him something else,
too, but I just can't remember.

934
01:24:05,212 --> 01:24:09,007
George Washington Bridge,
New Jersey.

935
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:21,603
Jenna.

936
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:24,648
- Jenna Rink.
- Yeah?

937
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:27,192
Chris Grandy.

938
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:29,486
So, what are you doing?
Are you married?

939
01:24:29,653 --> 01:24:33,282
Because if you're single,
I definitely want a number.

940
01:24:33,448 --> 01:24:34,741
We could get together.

941
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:36,618
I'm still living at home--

942
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:38,829
- Come on, Grandy! Come on.
- Holy Christ!

943
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:43,333
This is the tune we first
tangled tongues to.

944
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,836
What's the dude who sings this?

945
01:24:46,003 --> 01:24:49,298
- Rick Springsteen.
- It's Springfield, Grandy.

946
01:24:49,465 --> 01:24:51,133
I'm out of here.

947
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:54,761
I thought you wanted my number.

948
01:25:19,286 --> 01:25:21,205
I'll take these.

949
01:25:23,165 --> 01:25:24,583
Good afternoon.

950
01:25:26,793 --> 01:25:28,045
You remember, Wayne.

951
01:25:28,253 --> 01:25:31,882
It was with the Flamhaffs
at San Ysidro Ranch.

952
01:25:32,049 --> 01:25:34,760
San Ysidro Ranch.

953
01:25:35,427 --> 01:25:39,890
It's so pretty. It's perfect.
It looks great.

954
01:25:54,446 --> 01:25:56,657
Hi.

955
01:25:56,824 --> 01:25:58,408
Hey.

956
01:26:04,206 --> 01:26:08,126
I don't know what Lucy said to you
about me, but I want you to know...

957
01:26:08,293 --> 01:26:11,171
... that whoever that was she
was talking about...

958
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:14,007
... wasn't me.

959
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:18,345
It doesn't matter what Lucy said.

960
01:26:18,512 --> 01:26:22,307
I stopped trusting her after she stole
my Pop Rocks in the third grade.

961
01:26:24,184 --> 01:26:25,894
Matt.

962
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:33,277
I am not the awful person
that I know that I was.

963
01:26:33,443 --> 01:26:35,696
I don't even know that person.

964
01:26:37,197 --> 01:26:39,825
And I'd like to believe....

965
01:26:39,992 --> 01:26:43,704
I have to believe
that if you knew that...

966
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:47,958
... if in your heart, you really,
really knew that...

967
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:51,795
... you wouldn't be getting ready
to marry someone now.

968
01:26:52,004 --> 01:26:55,674
Unless that someone were me.

969
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:11,982
Jenna, I'm not gonna lie to you.

970
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:17,029
I have felt things...

971
01:27:17,196 --> 01:27:19,490
... these past few weeks...

972
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:23,952
... that I didn't know I could
feel anymore.

973
01:27:24,912 --> 01:27:28,874
But I have realized
in these past few days...

974
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:34,171
... you can't just turn back time.

975
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:38,091
Why not?

976
01:27:38,258 --> 01:27:39,885
I moved on.

977
01:27:40,052 --> 01:27:41,470
You moved on.

978
01:27:41,804 --> 01:27:45,057
We've gone down different paths
for so long.

979
01:27:45,224 --> 01:27:47,935
We made choices.

980
01:27:48,101 --> 01:27:50,938
I chose Wendy.

981
01:27:52,773 --> 01:27:55,567
That's her family down there.

982
01:27:56,193 --> 01:27:58,821
We care about each other,
you know?

983
01:28:00,697 --> 01:28:05,202
You don't always get the dream
house, but you get awfully close.

984
01:28:09,122 --> 01:28:11,458
Please don't cry, Jenna.

985
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:14,545
Oh, I'll be fine, I promise.

986
01:28:44,908 --> 01:28:46,910
Matty, can I have it?

987
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:48,745
Please?

988
01:28:48,954 --> 01:28:51,248
- You're not gonna whip it at me?
- No.

989
01:28:58,922 --> 01:29:02,217
Look, I won't have you be late.
Just go.

990
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:06,138
Go on. I'm fine. I'm just crying
because I'm happy.

991
01:29:06,305 --> 01:29:09,391
I want you to be so, so happy.

992
01:29:11,935 --> 01:29:14,062
I love you, Matt.

993
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:19,193
You're my best friend.

994
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:23,989
Jenna, I....

995
01:29:25,157 --> 01:29:27,701
I've always loved you.

996
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:33,076
Jenna's waiting for you in the closet.

997
01:31:44,129 --> 01:31:45,964
Matty.

998
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:55,182
You really know what you're doing.

999
01:31:55,766 --> 01:31:57,976
Come on.

1000
01:31:59,144 --> 01:32:01,855
- Sorry, I forgot my scarf.
- You know what?

1001
01:32:02,022 --> 01:32:06,193
You can be the pot and kettle
all by yourself from now on, biatch.

1002
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,820
Come on, Matt.

1003
01:32:07,986 --> 01:32:10,197
- What did you call me?
- We're gonna be late.

1004
01:32:10,364 --> 01:32:12,241
- For what?
- You'll see.

1005
01:33:05,752 --> 01:33:07,671
A Razzle, Mr. Flamhaff?

1006
01:33:07,838 --> 01:33:10,174
Thank you, Mrs. Flamhaff.
