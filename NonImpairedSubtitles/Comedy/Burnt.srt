They come, they eat, they go.

00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,440
But they have habits.
They have to stick to a routine

to give every restaurant
the same chance.

could even be a woman.

The first of the pair arrives early
and has a drink at the bar.

One orders the tasting menu,
the other one a la carte. Always.

697

They order half a bottle of wine.

698
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,114
They ask for tap water.
They wear business suits.

699

They're polite. But attention.

700
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,754
They may place a fork on the floor,

701
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,560
under the table to see if you notice,
and they wouldn't drop it

702
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,040
because that could make
a noise and make it too easy.

you can't take bad.

01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,800
How'd you find me?

939
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,998
Couldn't sleep, then I remembered
sole bonne femme needs sole.

940
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,270
Yeah, without skin.

941
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,920
Sweeney's Irish,
by the way, not Scottish.

942
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,032
It's my ex-husband's name.

943
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,793
Leon Sweeney.

944
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,437
Didn't work out, huh?

945
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,512
It could have done.

946
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,351
We were really good
for a long time, but...

947
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,838
You know, we drank too much,
and partied too much and...

948
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,350
I could stay up for days,
and he loved that about me.

949
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,200
Then I got pregnant with Lily and,

950
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,873
you know, I wanted to stop,
and he didn't.

951
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,031
- Didn't or couldn't?
- What's the difference?

952
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,640
Yeah.

953
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,393
I worked in places like this
all the time when I was a kid.

954
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,109
I saved up a bunch of money,
bought a one-way ticket to Paris.

955
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,756
Lied my way into Jean Luc's kitchen.

956
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,240
That's when Max was there, and Reece,
and, uh, Michel came later.

957
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,875
I didn't speak any French.

958
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,559
Worked 20-hour days, six days a week.

959
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,113
I was 19 years old.

960
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,554
I loved every minute of it.

961
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,714
The heat, the pressure, the violence,
the fucking screaming.

962
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,558
You know, all the cooks.

963
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,556
That kitchen is the only place
I've ever felt like I really belonged.

964
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,678
Why?

965
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,919
What happened in Paris?

966
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,953
I just fucked it all up.

967
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,155
Maybe it's...

968
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,558
Maybe I just wanted it really bad,
and then when I got it too early,

969
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,713
I didn't know how to hold on to it.
I tried to control everything.

970
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,436
Then when I wanted to escape from it...

971
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,389
Five o'clock's always the worst time
for thinking things.

972
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,870
I always think of things,
like I make a list of, like,

973
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,753
things and people
I always think about right now.

974
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,917
It's like my mom,
my grandmother, Jean Luc.

975
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,878
It's like a broken fucking record.

976
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,833
That woman at the party
was really pretty.

977
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,159
- Is she on your list?
- Nope.

978
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,912
Her perfume was amazing.

979
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,160
You smell okay.

980
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,835
(LAUGHS) Thank you.

981
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,318
What about Tony? Is he on your list?

982
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,880
Yeah, he's there.

983
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,793
I worry maybe I'm too hard on him.

984
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,997
At about 6:00, I decide it's okay.

985
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,554
(CHUCKLES)

986
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,878
And there's you.

987
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,073
- Wait, I'm on the list?
- Yeah, apparently so.

988
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,516
It's getting to be a long list.
No wonder I don't sleep.

989
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,956
Why are you thinking
about me at 5:00 a.m.?

990
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,551
I just think you and I
are exactly the same, you know?

991
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,273
All we want to do...

992
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,760
Thanks...

993
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,355
...is just fry some fucking fish.

994
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,994
(CHUCKLES)

995
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,511
HELENE: I'm thinking of doing that
sauce with a chicken stock base,

996
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,632
a white chicken stock,
just to lighten it up a bit.

997
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,235
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

998
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,873
Adam.

999
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,754
Yeah?

1000
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,636
(SOFTLY) This is a fucking stupid idea.

1001
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,757
(SOFTLY) It was your idea.

1002
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,400
(CHUCKLES)

1003
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,795
(CAR DOOR OPENS)

1004
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,750
No water bath, okay?

1005
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,360
Just slowly baste them
in butter on either side.

1006
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,749
What?

1007
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,435
Okay, and then confit
the rattes and then peel,

1008
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,559
emulsify in butter,
stock, truffles, okay?

1009
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,915
Who are they?

1010
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,992
Thirty seconds, no more.

1011
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:31,276
In Paris, it happened two times a week.
I used to worry, now I don't.

1012
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,432
Believe me, the only person

1013
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,069
who will kill Adam Jones is Adam Jones.

1014
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,840
Oh, Helene.

1015
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,196
"Oh, Helene" what?

1016
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,840
Adam?

1017
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,071
- (GROANS)
- Jesus.

1018
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,118
(SPITS, COUGHS) I'm okay.

1019
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,760
What the hell was that?
Who were those men?

1020
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,917
- I still owe some people some money.
- Just pay them.

1021
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,992
- It's a lot of money.
- You think you can walk?

1022
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,436
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You have to go and see a doctor, Adam.

1023
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,829
- No, service.
- No, you're not cooking, Adam.

1024
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,151
We can handle it, all right?
Just tell me quickly.

1025
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,800
Do you want me to baste them in butter?

1026
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,634
- Slowly, and then peel and emulsify.
- Jesus, you're as bad as he is.

1027
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,110
- KAITLIN: Tony. Tony!
- What?

1028
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,397
There's a man... There's a man
at the bar. He's wearing a suit.

1029
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,153
His friend arrived half an hour later.

1030
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,999
They left their drinks at the bar.

1031
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,393
WOMAN: They ordered
half a bottle of wine,

1032
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,593
two glasses of tap water, and there is now
a fork on the floor under their table.

1033
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,353
Michelin.

- Max, get my knives?
- Yeah.

1036
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,395
Where is it? Where's the order?

1037
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,960
- I said I'll handle it.
- Are they seated?

1038
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,554
Do we know what table they're at?

1039
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,955
- I'll handle it.
- Where's the order?

1040
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,120
- Where's the order?
- One taster, one a la carte.

1041
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,431
- Jesus, look at you. Adam.
- Be quiet.

1042
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,835
Just be fucking quiet.

1043
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,231
- MICHEL: Service.
- Is this it? Is this it?

1044
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,353
- Yeah.
- Okay, Michel, I want you to make

1045
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,954
the short ribs for the beef,
and I want you to make

1046
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,520
- the sauce for the sea bass.
- Adam.

1047
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,115
Let me finish and then you say
fucking, "Yes, chef!"

1048
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,551
Make the sauce for the sea bass.
I'm gonna portion out

1049
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,439
that fish and the beef.
Max, where are my knives?!

1050
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,195
- Yes, chef.
- Max. Max, give me the knives!

1051
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,795

1053
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,793
And remember, they're not
just watching their own table!

1054
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,231
They've got eyes on everything,
so everything has to be pitch perfect!

at that all the time, yeah?
