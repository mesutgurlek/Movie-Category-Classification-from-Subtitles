1
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:36,683
There's a bunch of birds in the sky

2
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:42,403
And some deers just went running by

3
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,721
Oh, the snow's pure and white

4
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:50,285
On the earth rich and brown

5
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:53,361
Just another Sunday morning

6
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:58,318
In my quiet mountain town

7
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:03,758
The sun is shining
And the grass is green

8
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:05,885
Under the three feet of snow I mean

9
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:09,325
This is the day
When it's hard to wear a frown

10
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:11,524
All the happy people stop
To say hello

11
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:14,328
-Out of my way!
-Even though the temperature's lo w

12
00:01:14,568 --> 00:01:16,524
It's a perfect Sunday morning

13
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:18,599
In my quiet mountain town

14
00:01:19,128 --> 00:01:20,561
Well, good morning, Stan.

15
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:22,844
-Mom, can l have $8 to see a movie?
-A movie?

16
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:25,721
lt'll be the best movie ever.
A foreign film from Canada.

17
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:28,766
-All right. But be back for supper.
-Thanks, Mom.

18
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:31,599
Oh, what a picture-perfect child

19
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:33,804
Just like Jesus he's tender and mild

20
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:37,324
He'd wear a smile
While he wore a thorny crown

21
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:39,798
What an angel with a heart
So sweet and sure

22
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:42,164
And a mind so open and pure

23
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:46,407
Thank God we live
In this quiet redneck mountain town

24
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:48,759
Dude! Dude, wake up!

25
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:53,360
Kenny, come on!

26
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:56,928
The Terrance and Phillip movie is out.
You wanna come?

27
00:01:58,288 --> 00:01:59,801
Where do you think you're going?

28
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,085
You have to go to church!

29
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:06,438
Well, fine.
Go ahead and miss church.

30
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:09,686
When you die and go to hell,
you can answer to Satan!

31
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,600
You can see your breath
Hanging in the air

32
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:15,804
You see homeless people
But you just don 't care

33
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:19,165
It's a sea of smiles
In which we'd be glad to drown

34
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:25,441
That's right!
It's Sunday morning

35
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:29,283
In our quiet little
White-bread redneck mountain town

36
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,716
-Ready, lke? Kick the baby!
-Don't kick the baby.

37
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:35,247
Kick the baby.

38
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:40,924
lke, you broke another window!
That's a bad baby. Bad baby!

39
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:42,487
We're going to
the Terrance and Phillip movie.

40
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:44,604
Oh, my God!

41
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:46,440
Kyle, where are you going?

42
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:49,122
-We're going ice-skating.
-Take your brother.

43
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:51,319
He's not even my real brother.
He's adopted.

44
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:52,478
Do as l say!

45
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:53,843
Okay, l'm sorry.

46
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:57,724
Look at those frail and fragile boys

47
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:00,004
It really gets me down

48
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:04,082
The world is such a rotten place
And city life's a complete disgrace

49
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:06,523
That's why I moved to
This redneck meshuggenah

50
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:10,807
Quiet mountain town

51
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,358
lke! Bad baby!

52
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:16,246
Brought to you by Snacky Smores...

53
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:18,325
... the fun of s 'mores in a cookie.

54
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:20,126
Mom, somebody's at the door!

55
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,598
-Coming, hon.
-l can't see the TV!

56
00:03:22,848 --> 00:03:25,920
It's been six weeks since Saddam
Hussein was killed by wild boars...

57
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:27,806
...and the world is
glad to be rid of him.

58
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:29,845
Eric, it's your little friends.

59
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:31,803
What are you doing here?

60
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:34,482
Sweet, dude. Yes!

61
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:38,117
Off to the movies we shall go

62
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,643
Where we learn everything
That we know

63
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:44,602
'Cause the movies teach us
What our parents don 't have time to say

64
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,163
And this movie's gonna
Make our lives complete

65
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:50,799
- 'Cause Terrance and Phillip are sweet
-Super sweet.

66
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:55,645
Thank God we live in the quiet little
Redneck Podunk white trash

67
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:58,846
U. S.A.

68
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,166
Can l have five tickets to
Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire ?

69
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:04,962
No.

70
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:07,604
What do you mean?

71
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:11,443
Asses of Fire is rated R by the
Motion Picture Association of America.

72
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:13,724
You must be accompanied
by a parent or guardian.

73
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:16,004
-Why?
-This movie has naughty language!

74
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:17,078
Next, please.

75
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:20,678
-This can't be happening.
-We have to see it.

76
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:22,844
Screw it.
lt probably isn't good anyway.

77
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:25,278
Cartman, what do you mean?
You love Terrance and Phillip.

78
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:27,200
But the animation's all crappy.

79
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:31,041
Wait. l've got an idea.

80
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:34,566
Hi. l want six tickets
to Asses of Fire.

81
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:36,884
This movie may not be appropriate
for the little ones.

82
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:39,164
He says this movie
isn't appropriate for you.

83
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:41,882
Mr. Homeless Guy,
if you don't want $1 0. . .

84
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:44,124
. . .to buy a bottle of vodka,
then be my guest.

85
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:45,477
Six tickets, please.

86
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:51,124
-Let me have some candy.
-Let's see.

87
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:52,761
l don't have any Jewish candy.

88
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:54,805
Like you need
all that chocolate, fat boy!

89
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:56,877
The movie's starting.

90
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:02,524
Hooray!

91
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:06,164
Terrance, what did the Spanish priest
say to the Iranian gynecologist?

92
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:07,761
I don 't know, Phillip. What?

93
00:05:10,648 --> 00:05:12,001
Where do they find this stuff?

94
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:14,000
You're such a pig-fucker, Phillip.

95
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:15,644
What did he say?

96
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,440
Why'd you call me a pig-fucker?

97
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:20,481
Well, let's see.
First of all, you fuck pigs.

98
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:21,484
Oh, yeah.

99
00:05:22,568 --> 00:05:24,798
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch.

100
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:27,687
You shit-faced cockmaster.

101
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,526
"Shit-faced cockmaster. "

102
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:32,167
You donkey-raping shit-eater.

103
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:33,397
"Donkey-raping shit-eater. "

104
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:38,446
-You'd fuck your uncle!
-You'd fuck your uncle!

105
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:41,078
Shut your fucking face
Uncle fucker

106
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:43,888
You're a cocksucking
Ass-licking uncle-fucker

107
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:47,001
Yes, it's true
Nobody fucks uncles quite like you

108
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:49,239
Shut your fucking face
Uncle fucker

109
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:52,002
You're the one that fucked your uncle
Uncle fucker

110
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:55,240
You don 't eat or mow the lawn
You fuck your uncle all day long

111
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:07,841
What's going on here?

112
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:12,803
-What garbage.
-What do you expect? They're Canadian.

113
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:24,280
Shut your fucking face
Uncle fucker

114
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:27,002
You're a boner-biting bastard
Uncle fucker

115
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:30,399
-You're an uncle-fucker I must say
-You fucked your uncle yesterday

116
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:34,807
Uncle fucker
That's U-N-C-L-E fuck you

117
00:06:35,048 --> 00:06:36,766
Uncle fucker

118
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:37,964
Suck my balls.

119
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:45,678
-That movie was fucking sweet!
-You bet your fucking ass it was!

120
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:47,486
Fuck, l wanna be
just like them.

121
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:49,400
Wait, where's your guardian?

122
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,803
l knew it! You paid a homeless guy
to get you in, didn't you?

123
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:56,642
Fuck off, you donkey-raping shit-eater.

124
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:59,482
Shut your fucking face
Uncle fucker

125
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:02,447
You're an ass-licking
Ball-sucking uncle-fucker

126
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,207
Where have you been all day?

127
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:15,321
Nowhere. We just went to go see
the Terrance and Phillip movie.

128
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:17,958
How'd you get in?

129
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:20,557
Stop crowding us,
shit-faced cockmasters!

130
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:24,198
You're all ass-ramming uncle-fuckers.

131
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:26,997
We've got to see this movie.

132
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:29,478
Terrance and Phillip are Canadian,
just like my brother.

133
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:34,127
There's the girl that I like

134
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:38,197
Tell about when Terrance called Phillip
a testicle-shitting rectal wart.

135
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:39,642
Now more than ever

136
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:41,526
She gives me butterflies

137
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:45,164
It makes my stomach queasy
Every time she walks by

138
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:46,727
Asshole, l'm talking to you.

139
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:49,562
I know I can be cool
If I try

140
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:53,281
Gross!

141
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:56,203
Wendy, let us try to jump
the hilly brush.

142
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:57,723
Who are you?

143
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:01,278
Gregory. l transferred from Yardale,
where l had a 4.0 grade point average.

144
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:02,917
Want to skate with us?

145
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:06,365
We've been skating all morning,
laughing and talking of memories past.

146
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:08,447
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie.

147
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:11,076
Try and catch me, Wendy.

148
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:14,127
Bye, Stan.

149
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:21,485
l saw the Terrance and Phillip movie.
Who wants to touch me?

150
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:23,406
l said, who wants to fucking touch me?

151
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:27,922
We gotta see the
Terrance and Phillip movie too.

152
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:33,006
l hate you, Kenny.

153
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:39,727
Shut your fucking face
Uncle fucker

154
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:42,243
You're a boner-biting bastard
Uncle fucker

155
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,684
Okay, children, let's take our seats.

156
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:47,839
We have a lot to learn today.

157
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:49,527
We sure do, Mr. Hat.

158
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:52,926
Let's start the day
with a few new math problems.

159
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:55,045
What is five times two?

160
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:58,997
Don't be shy.
Just give it your best shot.

161
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:01,441
-Yes, Clyde.
-Twelve?

162
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:05,317
Now let's get an answer from
someone who's not a complete retard.

163
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:07,798
Anyone? Come on, don't be shy.

164
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,118
l think l know the answer,
Mr. Garrison.

165
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:12,962
-Shut up, fat boy!
-Don't call me fat, you fucking Jew!

166
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,006
-Eric! Did you just say the F-word?
-"Jew"?

167
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,677
You can't say "fuck" in school,
you fucking fat ass.

168
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:20,244
Why the fuck not?

169
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:21,883
You said "fuck" again.

170
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:26,521
What's the big deal? lt doesn't
hurt anybody. Fuck, fuckitty, fuck.

171
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:28,838
How would you like to go see
the counselor?

172
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:31,039
How would you like to suck my balls?

173
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:33,567
What did you say?!

174
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:37,164
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
Actually, what l said was. . .

175
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:42,199
. . . "How would you like to suck my balls,
Mr. Garrison?"

176
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:44,403
Holy shit, dude.

177
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:51,207
l'm disappointed in you boys.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

178
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:53,086
l've called in your mothers--

179
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:54,727
-You called my mom?
-That's right.

180
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:55,917
Oh, no, dude!

181
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,483
-Mr. Mackey, can l ask a question?
-M'kay, what?

182
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:00,087
What's the big fucking deal?

183
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:04,518
l want to know where you heard
these horrific obscenities, m'kay?

184
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:08,118
-Nowhere.
-We heard them from Mr. Garrison before.

185
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:10,917
l seriously doubt
that Mr. Garrison ever said. . .

186
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:13,602
. . . "Eat penguin shit,
you ass-spelunker. "

187
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:15,878
Sweet.

188
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:22,445
Thank you for coming on short notice.

189
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:23,922
This isn't like you, Stanley.

190
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:27,245
What did my son say, Mr. Mackey?
Did he say the S-word?

191
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:28,967
No, it was worse than that.

192
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,038
The F-word?

193
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:33,400
Here's a short list of the things
they've been saying.

194
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:36,082
-Oh, dear God.
-What the heck is a rim job?

195
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:40,480
When you put your legs behind your head
and have someone lick your ass.

196
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:46,843
Tell Mr. Mackey this instant where
you heard all these horrible phrases!

197
00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:49,683
We all swore ourselves to secrecy.

198
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:51,441
-The Terrance and Phillip movie.
-Dude!

199
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:53,041
l wanna get out of here.

200
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:55,159
Terrance and Phillip? Those Canadians?

201
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:57,239
Excuse me.
What is Terrance and Phillip?

202
00:10:57,488 --> 00:11:00,639
Terrance and Phillip are two
very untalented actors from Canada.

203
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:03,043
Nothing but foul language
and toilet humor!

204
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,440
l'll send a warning to parents before
more children see Terrance and Phillip.

205
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:08,677
Everybody's fucking seen it.

206
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:12,684
l can't help myself. That movie has
warped my fragile little mind.

207
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:21,599
There's the girl that I like

208
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:25,928
Over there laughing with that smart--

209
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:28,688
You're holding up
the goddamn lunch line!

210
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:30,960
Hello, there, children.

211
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,436
-Hey, Chef.
-How's it going?

212
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:33,723
-Bad.
-Why bad?

213
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:37,278
We got busted for swearing.
We can't ever see that movie again.

214
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:38,358
That's too bad.

215
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:41,122
You should've seen Kyle when
his mom showed up. He was scared.

216
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,246
-Shut up, Cartman!
-l'd be scared. Your mom's a bitch.

217
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:45,961
Don't call her a bitch,
you fat fuck!

218
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,966
Don't call me fat,
you fucking son of a bitch!

219
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,517
Where did you learn to talk like that?

220
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:51,917
Pretty fucking sweet, huh?

221
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,802
How do you make a woman like you
more than any other guy?

222
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:57,756
That's easy.
You just gotta find the clitoris.

223
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:00,881
What does "find the clitoris" mean?

224
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:02,521
Forget l said anything.

225
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:04,599
Move along.
You're holding up the line.

226
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:06,918
Do you know where l can find
the clitoris?

227
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:09,284
-The what?
-ls that like finding Jesus?

228
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:10,762
Attention, students.

229
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:13,841
We are now enforcing a new dress code
at South Park Elementary.

230
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:16,403
Terrance and Phillip shirts are
not allowed in school.

231
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:20,283
Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip
shirt is to be sent home immediately.

232
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:22,967
Hooray!

233
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:30,524
The Canadian film Asses of Fire
is number one at the box office.

234
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:32,446
Is the film destroying
American youth?

235
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:34,997
Here with a special report is
a midget in a bikini.

236
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:38,684
The effects of the Canadian comedy
are far-reaching indeed.

237
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:43,126
All over America, children seem to be
influenced, like at this spelling bee.

238
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:45,245
This is for the silver medal.

239
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:47,320
Spell "forensics. "

240
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:49,804
Why should l fucking
have to spell "forensics"?

241
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:54,086
Here you go. S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S.

242
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:55,522
Forensics.

243
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:59,681
The devastating impact of the duo
can also be seen with their hit song...

244
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:02,004
... "Shut Your Fucking Face,
Uncle Fucker. "

245
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:04,244
Shut your fucking face
Uncle fucker

246
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:07,919
You're a boner-biting bastard
Uncle fucker

247
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,967
I told you that we won 't stop

248
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,647
I told you that we won 't stop

249
00:13:11,888 --> 00:13:12,843
Back to you, Tom.

250
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:14,447
Thanks. Shocking report.

251
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:16,923
The controversy began
in the town of South Park...

252
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:19,318
... where the PTA is trying
to ban the movie.

253
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:23,117
With us tonight is the head of the PTA,
Sheila Broflovski.

254
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:25,922
-And the Canadian minister of movies.
-Thanks for having me.

255
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:29,484
Parents are concerned about your
country's entertainment.

256
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:31,525
The film isn 't intended
for children--

257
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:33,520
But of course children will see it.

258
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:36,328
Can I finish?
We're surprised by your outrage.

259
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:39,128
-You just don 't care!
-Can I finish? Hello?

260
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:41,836
The U. S. has graphic violence
on TV all the time.

261
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:44,323
We can 't believe a movie
with foul language pisses you off.

262
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:46,325
-Because it's evil!
-Can I finish?!

263
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:48,240
Please can I finish?!

264
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:50,123
Okay, I'm finished.

265
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:53,718
This film isn 't the first
troublesome thing to come out of Canada.

266
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:55,321
Let's not forget Bryan Adams.

267
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:58,281
Our government's apologized
for Bryan Adams on several occasions.

268
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:02,117
You Canadians are all the same,
with your beady eyes and flapping heads.

269
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:03,881
I resent that! I find that racist--

270
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:06,278
Our children are now addicted
to your puke!

271
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:07,443
You are a racist!

272
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:12,398
It'll take us weeks to erase the damage
this film has done to our children.

273
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,198
Kids, l want to welcome you
to rehabilitation, m'kay?

274
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:20,837
Your mothers insisted you be taken
from your schoolwork. . .

275
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,517
. . .and placed into rehab to learn
not to swear.

276
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:25,281
l don't belong with these rogues.

277
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:27,922
l attended Yardale and had
a 4.0 grade point average.

278
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,477
-You're a fucking faggot.
-M'kay, you see?

279
00:14:30,728 --> 00:14:34,607
This is what l'm talking about.
We have to get you off of foul language.

280
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:36,964
-How are we gonna do that?
-Listen here.

281
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:39,923
There are times when you get
Suckered in

282
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:43,644
By drugs and alcohol
And sex with women, m 'kay?

283
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:46,038
But it's when you
Do these things too much

284
00:14:46,328 --> 00:14:50,879
That you've become an addict
And must get back in touch

285
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:54,001
You can do it
It's all up to you, m 'kay

286
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:58,238
With a little plan
You can change your life today

287
00:14:58,568 --> 00:15:00,684
Don 't spend your life
Addicted to smack

288
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:02,680
Homeless
Giving handjobs for crack

289
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:06,483
Follow my plan
And very soon you will say

290
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:08,047
It's easy, m 'kay

291
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:10,327
Instead of "ass" say "buns"

292
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:12,723
Like "Kiss my buns"
Or "You're a buns-hole"

293
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:14,327
Instead of "shit" say "poo"

294
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:16,723
As in "bull poo", "poo-head"
And "This poo is cold"

295
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,202
With "bitch" drop the "T"

296
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:20,757
'Cause "bich" is Latin
For generosity

297
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:22,123
Don 't say "fuck" anymore

298
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:24,444
'Cause "fuck" is the worst word
That you can say

299
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:26,684
So just use the word "m 'kay"

300
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:29,362
We can do it
It's all up to us, m 'kay

301
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:32,559
With a little plan
We can change our lives today

302
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,207
You can change it today

303
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,518
Don 't spend your life
Shooting up in the trash

304
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,520
Homeless
Giving handjobs for cash

305
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:41,407
Follow this plan
And very soon you will say

306
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:43,639
It's easy, m 'kay

307
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:45,204
Step one

308
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:47,086
-Say "buns"
-Like "Kiss my buns"

309
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:48,443
Or "You're a buns-hole"

310
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:49,916
-Step two
-Instead of "shit" say "poo"

311
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:52,517
-As in "bull poo"
-And "This poo is cold"

312
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:54,042
-Step three
-With "bitch" drop the "T"

313
00:15:54,248 --> 00:15:56,443
'Cause "bich" is Latin for generosity

314
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:58,041
-Step four
-Don 't say "fuck" anymore

315
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:00,125
It's the worst word
You can say

316
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:02,040
"Fuck" is the worst word
That you can say

317
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:04,557
We shouldn 't say "fuck"
Fuck no!

318
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:05,957
You're cured, you can go

319
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,204
Don 't spend your life
Shooting up in the trash

320
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:10,200
Homeless
Giving handjobs for cash

321
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:13,360
Follow this plan
And very soon you will say

322
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:15,081
It's easy, m 'kay

323
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:31,084
Now you're cured. Take the rest of the
afternoon off for personal reflection.

324
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:35,042
Find your own constructive way
to better yourself, m'kay?

325
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:39,123
I hope you've learned
something through this experience.

326
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:42,565
I did. I learned that you are
a boner-biting, dick-fart fuck-face.

327
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:46,405
Want to see the northern lights?

328
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,641
You burned yourself to death
by lighting your fart.

329
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:53,679
I sure did, Phillip.

330
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:57,884
Uncle fucker! Good night.

331
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:01,402
Oh, man. This movie rules.

332
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:05,201
Man, that movie gets better
every time l see it.

333
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:07,877
That part about lighting farts
is bullshit.

334
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,481
-You can't do that.
-Yes, you can.

335
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:10,837
No way.

336
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:15,598
Okay, Kenny. l'll bet you $1 00
you can't light a fart on fire.

337
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:23,804
-Holy shit, dude!
-Look out!

338
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:26,441
Shit! Shit!

339
00:17:26,688 --> 00:17:28,519
Help! Somebody do something!

340
00:17:28,768 --> 00:17:30,042
This stick is on fire!

341
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:37,441
Oh, my God! You killed Kenny!

342
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:38,558
You bastard!

343
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:41,163
l guess you can light a fart on fire.

344
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:46,038
Load that lV with 70cc's
of sodium Pentothal.

345
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:47,198
We called the parents.

346
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:50,361
Our moms will find out
we went to the movie again.

347
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:51,723
Vacuum!

348
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:54,004
Try to untangle his trachea
and esophagus.

349
00:17:55,128 --> 00:17:56,846
No, that doesn't go there!

350
00:17:59,488 --> 00:18:01,126
-Gross, Stan!
-That's sick!

351
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:02,887
-Watch his liver!
-l'll get it.

352
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:06,283
We have little time left.
We'll lose him soon.

353
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:07,603
His heart stopped.

354
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:09,845
Get it out of there.
Zap this, quick!

355
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:13,642
Who's making a potato?

356
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,357
My bad. l missed lunch.

357
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:18,036
Damn it, l'm not gonna lose this kid!

358
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:20,284
Close him up. We've done all we can.

359
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:22,917
The rest is up to God.

360
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:26,647
Kenny, can you hear me?

361
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:27,918
How are you feeling?

362
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,684
Great. Son, l have some bad news.

363
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:35,597
We replaced your heart with a potato.
You have three seconds to live.

364
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:40,362
-Fucking weak, dude!
-Oh, my God. They killed Kenny!

365
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:41,597
You bastards!

366
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:42,917
Damn it!

367
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:46,478
lt never gets any easier!

368
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:52,082
l bet him he couldn't do it.
l bet him $1 00.

369
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:55,559
-lt's not your fault.
-No, l'm stoked l don't have to pay.

370
00:18:55,808 --> 00:18:59,005
That's real nice! He was your friend,
you fat fuck!

371
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:01,967
So, boys, you saw that movie again?

372
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:04,526
Well, Kyle, l have had it!

373
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,918
You are grounded
for the next two weeks!

374
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:08,838
Grounded?

375
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,527
And you, Stan. Come on.

376
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:12,719
And you're grounded
for three weeks, Eric.

377
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,879
Why am l grounded more?
That's bullshit.

378
00:19:15,128 --> 00:19:16,038
What, what, what?!

379
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:18,637
What was that word, young man?

380
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:34,642
Little boy at peace

381
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:35,924
What is this place

382
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:38,520
Beyond the stars

383
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:41,398
Open up your eyes

384
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,247
What are these things

385
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:45,126
You're moving toward

386
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:47,798
Head so full of wonder

387
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,804
-Worries in the past

388
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:53,477
Could it be
That you are free at last

389
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:56,763
No!

390
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,806
Little boy, you're going to hell

391
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:08,526
You said bad words, threw rocks at birds
And now this is your hotel

392
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:11,117
This ain 't Disneyland, it's hell

393
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:14,639
Little boy, it's time for you to pay

394
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:17,762
For not going to church
And staring at boobs every day

395
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,602
Thought you were in bed
Instead you're in hell

396
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:25,120
No, hell isn 't good
Hell isn 't good, hell

397
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:31,887
Fuck-face, have you seen Gracie?

398
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:35,438
There is orderliness in the universe.

399
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:51,167
Parents, our children are
out of control!

400
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:55,037
This is what happens when toilet humor
is allowed to run rampant!

401
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:57,045
That's right.
Kenny set himself on fire. . .

402
00:20:57,248 --> 00:21:00,001
. . .because he saw Terrance and Phillip
do it in that dirty movie.

403
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,086
We must stop dirty language from
getting to our children's ears.

404
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,319
We must go fight the source of it!

405
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:06,927
But what is the source?

406
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:08,880
That's easy.

407
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:11,722
Times have changed
Our kids are getting worse

408
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:14,726
They won 't obey their parents
Theyjust want to fart and curse

409
00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:16,247
Should we blame the government

410
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:17,722
Or blame society

411
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:20,237
Or should we blame the images on TV

412
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:22,040
No, blame Canada!

413
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:23,283
Blame Canada

414
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:26,565
With all their beady little eyes
And flappin ' heads so full of lies

415
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:27,917
Blame Canada

416
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:29,447
Blame Canada

417
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:32,037
-We need to form a full assault
-It's Canada 's fault

418
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:35,723
Don 't blame me for my son Stan

419
00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:39,005
He saw the darn cartoon
And now he's off to join the Klan

420
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,676
And my boy Eric once
Had my picture on his shelf

421
00:21:41,928 --> 00:21:44,203
But now when I see him
He tells me to fuck myself

422
00:21:44,408 --> 00:21:45,841
Well, blame Canada

423
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:47,367
Blame Canada

424
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:50,128
It seems that everything's gone wrong
Since Canada came along

425
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:56,726
They're not even a real country anyway

426
00:21:56,928 --> 00:21:59,920
My son could've been a doctor
Or a lawyer rich and true

427
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:02,926
Instead he burned up like a piggy
On a barbecue

428
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:04,481
Should we blame the matches

429
00:22:04,688 --> 00:22:07,805
Should we blame the fire
Or the doctors who allowed him to expire

430
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:09,919
Heck, no!
Blame Canada

431
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,527
Blame Canada

432
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:14,726
-With all their hockey hullabaloo
-And that bitch Anne Murray too

433
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:21,487
The smut and trash we must bash
The laughs and fun must be undone

434
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:23,002
We must lament and cause a fuss

435
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,166
Before somebody thinks of blaming us

436
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,843
All right, you turds, listen up!

437
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:38,279
Your moms are at a meeting
and they put me in charge of you.

438
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:41,281
But you're still grounded,
so you're not allowed to have any fun!

439
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,563
Any questions?

440
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:44,042
Shelley, where's the clitoris?

441
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:48,922
You all sit there and keep
your mouths shut. . .

442
00:22:49,128 --> 00:22:52,598
. . .while l go listen to
my Britney Spears records.

443
00:22:54,328 --> 00:22:55,158
Okay, it's clear!

444
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:59,518
Our next guests have
the number one movie in the world.

445
00:22:59,768 --> 00:23:02,328
Please welcome Terrance and Phillip!

446
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:07,326
-Hello, Conan.
-Hello, Brooke Shields.

447
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:11,521
Some people claim that your Canadian
humor is just immature fart jokes.

448
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:14,680
That's not true.
Take this classic Canadian joke.

449
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,805
-Excuse me, Terrance.
-Yes, Phillip?

450
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:20,958
Gosh darn it!

451
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:24,245
-Good one. Cheers.
-Cheers, fuck-face.

452
00:23:24,448 --> 00:23:26,120
You can't say that on TV.

453
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:28,364
Now Terrance smells like my ass.

454
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,839
l farted once on the set
of Blue Lagoon.

455
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:37,643
Does it make you nervous to be
in America?

456
00:23:37,888 --> 00:23:41,039
Our organizations want you
arrested for destroying children.

457
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:43,887
-They'd have to find us first.
-You're right. Now!

458
00:23:45,768 --> 00:23:50,205
Mothers Against Canada is placing you
under citizen's arrest!

459
00:23:50,408 --> 00:23:51,966
-Mom?
-What's going on?

460
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:54,045
We have a court order for your arrest!

461
00:23:54,248 --> 00:23:55,647
Phillip, we've been ambushed!

462
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:57,247
Here you go, Conan.

463
00:23:57,448 --> 00:24:00,520
This little scrotum-sucker deceived us!
You are a bad man!

464
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:01,638
Don't listen to them.

465
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:04,203
You loved our movie, Conan.
We watched it together.

466
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:05,727
Remember? You laughed.

467
00:24:05,968 --> 00:24:07,879
What have l done?

468
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:18,765
Did you see that?
They arrested Terrance and Phillip!

469
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:24,878
As Canadian ambassador. . .

470
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:28,325
. . .l condemn America's actions
in apprehending Terrance and Phillip.

471
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,519
The entire economy of Canada relies
on Terrance and Phillip.

472
00:24:32,728 --> 00:24:34,320
Without them,
we'd have a recession.

473
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:37,445
What say you,
Mr. American Ambassador?

474
00:24:40,408 --> 00:24:41,363
Fuck Canada!

475
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:42,637
Fuck you, buddy!

476
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,440
Terrance and Phillip
will not be released.

477
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:47,367
They'll be put on trial
for corrupting America's youth.

478
00:24:47,608 --> 00:24:49,121
What's all the fuss about?

479
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:53,321
The fuss is aboot taking our citizens!
lt's aboot not censoring our art!

480
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:55,883
lt's aboot--
What's so goddamn funny?

481
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,401
Nothing. Could you tell us again
what your argument is all about?

482
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:04,078
This is not aboot diplomacy. This is
aboot dignity. lt's aboot respect.

483
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:05,727
Aboot realizing that humor--

484
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:10,763
Release them, or we'll
give you something to cry aboot!

485
00:25:23,568 --> 00:25:26,036
Pilot to bombardier.
We're nearing the target.

486
00:25:26,288 --> 00:25:27,641
Bomb's ready, buddy.

487
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:29,207
Baldwin residence.

488
00:25:29,768 --> 00:25:31,201
No, this is Billy Baldwin.

489
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:34,281
lf you want Daniel Baldwin,
call his extension, stupid!

490
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:37,122
Alec, do you know what sucks
about being a Baldwin?

491
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,683
-No. What?
-Nothing!

492
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:47,887
You missed me!

493
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:55,885
Your mothers are making me throw away
my lesson plan and teach theirs.

494
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:58,198
How come our moms arrested
Terrance and Phillip?

495
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:03,084
Your moms are just upset.
They're probably all on their periods.

496
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,204
Not cool.

497
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:07,406
Wendy and l think
that was a sexist statement.

498
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:11,323
Sorry, but l don't trust anything that
bleeds for five days and doesn't die.

499
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:14,921
Anyway, children, let's start off
with some vocabulary.

500
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,203
Attention, students.

501
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,278
What now?

502
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:21,885
Come to the gymnasium immediately
for a special announcement.

503
00:26:24,288 --> 00:26:26,597
-What's going on, Chef?
-Something big, children.

504
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:28,839
l can't find the clitoris.
You have to help.

505
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,407
Stan, the clitoris is--

506
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:32,803
Take your seats.
They're about to announce it.

507
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:35,767
This is a state of emergency.

508
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:39,398
Now to the White House for
an announcement from the President.

509
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:41,042
My fellow Americans...

510
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:45,804
...at 5 a.m. today,
a day which will live in infamy...

511
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:48,960
... the Canadians have bombed
the Baldwins.

512
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:53,844
In response to this, the U. S. has
declared war on Canada.

513
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:57,526
-Oh, no.
-War?

514
00:26:57,768 --> 00:27:00,566
-No, Gregory, no!
-This is bad. Hold on to me.

515
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:02,321
All the Baldwins are dead?

516
00:27:02,568 --> 00:27:05,241
It's time for us to send
a message to Canadians.

517
00:27:05,448 --> 00:27:08,645
In two days, the war criminals,
Terrance and Phillip...

518
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:10,486
... will be executed.

519
00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:12,397
They're gonna kill them?

520
00:27:12,648 --> 00:27:16,038
And now I'd like to bring up my newly
appointed Secretary of Offense...

521
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:18,045
...Ms. Sheila Broflovski.

522
00:27:18,448 --> 00:27:19,437
Holy shit, dude!

523
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:20,837
My fellow Americans...

524
00:27:21,048 --> 00:27:24,836
...our neighbor to the north
has abused us for the last time!

525
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:27,084
-I have a plan--
-Canadians want to fight us...

526
00:27:27,288 --> 00:27:30,121
...because we won 't tolerate
their potty-mouths.

527
00:27:30,368 --> 00:27:32,324
If it is war they want...

528
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,962
... then war they shall have!

529
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:38,600
Dude, this is fucking weak.

530
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:41,043
How could things be any worse?

531
00:27:51,768 --> 00:27:54,407
Fallen one, l am Satan.

532
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:57,116
l am your god now.

533
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,639
There is no escape.

534
00:28:04,928 --> 00:28:07,726
Now feel the delightful pain.

535
00:28:07,968 --> 00:28:08,844
Hey, Satan.

536
00:28:09,928 --> 00:28:13,204
Did you hear the news?
A war just broke out up on Earth.

537
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:16,879
Meet Saddam Hussein,
my new partner in evil.

538
00:28:17,688 --> 00:28:19,121
You're hogging all the fun.

539
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:22,767
Man, this is getting me so hot!

540
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:25,520
Would you let me do my job?

541
00:28:25,768 --> 00:28:27,918
Rub my nipples while l torture
this little piggy.

542
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:30,318
Could l talk to you over here?

543
00:28:32,448 --> 00:28:35,804
l don't see why you have to belittle me
in front of people like that.

544
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,276
Relax, guy.

545
00:28:37,528 --> 00:28:39,996
Sometimes, l think you don't have
any respect for me.

546
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:42,046
Come here, guy.

547
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:44,801
Who's my cream puff?

548
00:28:45,128 --> 00:28:47,244
-l am.
-That's my baby.

549
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:52,083
l don't wanna be at war.

550
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:54,125
You think they'll kill
Terrance and Phillip?

551
00:28:54,328 --> 00:28:57,286
Kyle, stop being a chicken shit
and stand up to your mother.

552
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,281
Smack her and say, "That's enough
of your shit, you bitch! "

553
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,160
Don't call my mom a bitch!

554
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,718
Stop it! This isn't helping.
We've gotta think. Let's see.

555
00:29:05,928 --> 00:29:09,557
-What would Brian Boitano do?
-Yeah, what would Brian Boitano do?

556
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:13,717
What's going on?

557
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:16,402
America thinks it has the right
to police the world.

558
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:20,277
Your government will kill two Canadians,
an action condemned by the U.N.

559
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:21,961
Home of the free, indeed.

560
00:29:23,568 --> 00:29:25,206
Let's play tetherball.

561
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:27,717
This is about freedom of speech!
About censorship!

562
00:29:27,928 --> 00:29:29,043
Be more political. . . .

563
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:31,204
There's the girl that I like

564
00:29:32,848 --> 00:29:36,443
Now it appears
That she likes another guy

565
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:40,402
It must be because
He's political and stuff

566
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:43,996
I bet I could be political too

567
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:45,920
What do you think, Stan?

568
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:48,238
Damn it!

569
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:51,241
-This is all Kyle's mom's fault.
-Shut up, Cartman!

570
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,046
Kyle's mom started that damn club.

571
00:29:53,288 --> 00:29:57,327
-All because she's a fat, stupid bitch.
-Don't say it, Cartman!

572
00:29:58,568 --> 00:30:00,286
Don't do it, Cartman.

573
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:03,486
l'm warning you!

574
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:06,479
l'm sick of him calling my mom a--

575
00:30:06,728 --> 00:30:09,083
Kyle's mom 's a witch
The biggest bitch in the world

576
00:30:09,328 --> 00:30:12,525
She's a stupid bitch
She's a bitch to all the boys and girls

577
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:15,198
Shut your fucking mouth, Cartman!

578
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:18,082
Monday and Tuesday she's a bitch
Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch

579
00:30:18,328 --> 00:30:22,116
On Sundayjust to be different
She's a super King Kamehameha bitch

580
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,921
Come on, you all know the words.

581
00:30:24,168 --> 00:30:25,237
Have you met Kyle's mom

582
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,722
She's the biggest bitch
In the world

583
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:28,805
She's a mean old bitch
And she has stupid hair

584
00:30:29,048 --> 00:30:29,958
She's a bitch bitch bitch

585
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:32,358
She's a stupid bitch

586
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:35,403
Kyle's mom 's a bitch
And she's just a dirty bitch

587
00:30:35,888 --> 00:30:38,482
Talk to kids around the world
It might go something like this

588
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:51,482
Have you met Kyle's mom

589
00:30:51,728 --> 00:30:52,922
She's the biggest bitch
In the world

590
00:30:53,128 --> 00:30:54,766
She's a mean old bitch
And she has stupid hair

591
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:55,878
She's a bitch bitch bitch

592
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:58,603
She's a stupid bitch

593
00:30:59,128 --> 00:31:01,801
Kyle's mom 's a bitch
And she's just a dirty bitch

594
00:31:02,088 --> 00:31:04,761
I really mean it
Kyle's mom

595
00:31:05,248 --> 00:31:09,036
She's a big fat fucking bitch

596
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:12,841
Big old fat fucking bitch
Kyle's mom

597
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:19,882
What?

598
00:31:21,328 --> 00:31:23,205
Oh, fuck.

599
00:31:23,488 --> 00:31:25,638
Everyone, settle down.

600
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:27,964
As we continue to send troops
into Canada. . .

601
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:31,524
. . .M.A.C. is also fighting the war
against potty-mouths here at home.

602
00:31:31,728 --> 00:31:35,721
Here to present the V-chip
is Dr. Vosknocker.

603
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:40,599
The machinery of the V-chip
is very simple.

604
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:42,446
lt is placed under the child's skin. . .

605
00:31:42,648 --> 00:31:46,607
. . .emitting a small shock of electricity
whenever an obscenity is uttered.

606
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:49,925
Wait a minute. This chip somehow knows
if the child is swearing?

607
00:31:50,128 --> 00:31:51,197
lt's like a lie detector.

608
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:53,842
Certain things happen to you
when you swear, just like when you lie.

609
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,326
The chip picks up on this and gives
the subject a little prick.

610
00:31:57,688 --> 00:32:00,327
Patient B-5, would you
step out here, please?

611
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:03,765
Patient B-5 here has been fitted
with the new V-chip.

612
00:32:03,968 --> 00:32:04,798
My head hurts.

613
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:08,603
Don't worry about that.
Now, l want you to say "doggy. "

614
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,798
Doggy.

615
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:11,760
Notice that nothing happens.

616
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:14,562
-Now say "Montana. "
-Montana.

617
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:15,604
Good.

618
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,036
Now, "pillow. "

619
00:32:17,328 --> 00:32:18,397
Pillow.

620
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,600
All right. Now l want you to say
"horse-fucker. "

621
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:24,320
Go ahead, Eric. lt's all right.

622
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:26,007
Horse-fuck--

623
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:28,801
That hurt, goddamn--

624
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:29,884
Fuck!

625
00:32:30,128 --> 00:32:32,801
Now l'd like you to say
"big, floppy donkey dick. "

626
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:36,486
Success!
The child doesn't want to swear!

627
00:32:36,728 --> 00:32:38,480
This isn't fair, you sons of bitches!

628
00:32:38,728 --> 00:32:42,846
We will start putting V-chips
in all our children next week!

629
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:48,600
Snacky Smores presents:
The March of War.

630
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:50,156
Let's hear it for our boys.

631
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,724
Clinton has called them
to fight the evil Canadians.

632
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:56,277
A full-scale attack was launched
on Toronto...

633
00:32:56,488 --> 00:33:00,481
...after the Canadians ' last bombing,
which devastated the Arquettes.

634
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,242
For security measures,
our great government is rounding up...

635
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,121
...all citizens with Canadian blood
and putting them into camps.

636
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:09,883
Canadian-Americans are to report
to one of these death camps right away.

637
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,487
Did I say "death camps"?

638
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:14,117
I meant happy camps,
where you will eat the finest meals...

639
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,478
...have access to fabulous doctors
and exercise regularly.

640
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:20,483
Meanwhile, war criminals Terrance
and Phillip are prepped for execution.

641
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:22,087
Their execution will take place...

642
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:25,644
...during a fabulous USO show,
with guest celebrities, including...

643
00:33:25,848 --> 00:33:27,804
...Big Gay Al and Winona Ryder.

644
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:31,796
Of course, the only way to see the
USO show is to sign up for the Army!

645
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:35,637
So join the Army and kill
some Canadian scum as we continue...

646
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:38,840
... the march of war.
Eat Snacky Smores.

647
00:33:41,928 --> 00:33:46,080
We must rid ourselves
of anything Canadian.

648
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,524
Don't you like
Terrance and Phillip anymore?

649
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:53,198
Course not! Mommy says l hate Canadians
because they made me have a dirty mouth.

650
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,124
Burn it all!

651
00:33:55,608 --> 00:33:57,200
-Hey, dudes.
-What's the matter, Cartman?

652
00:33:57,488 --> 00:34:01,003
lt's this V-chip. l hate it.
l can't say any dirty words.

653
00:34:01,328 --> 00:34:02,761
-So you can't say "fuck"?
-No.

654
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:04,481
-And you can't say "shit"?
-No.

655
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,681
You can't say, "l'm Cartman,
the fattest piece of shit in the world"?

656
00:34:07,928 --> 00:34:09,680
-Fuck you!
-Dude. Sweet!

657
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:13,085
This has gone far enough.
lt's time we talked to our moms.

658
00:34:13,288 --> 00:34:14,562
We're supposed to be grounded.

659
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:16,918
Come on, it's time for us
to get political.

660
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:20,006
Canada will no longer corrupt
our children!

661
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,482
Mom, can l talk to you?

662
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:24,327
Kyle, what are you doing here?
You are grounded.

663
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:26,724
Get back to the house
and stay there!

664
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:28,117
You too, Stanley.

665
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:31,326
You're going too far.
You can't kill Terrance and Phillip.

666
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,519
We must fight for
our children's futures!

667
00:34:33,768 --> 00:34:37,283
-You started a war. You have to stop it.
-To make them safe again!

668
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:39,718
Our children are precious.

669
00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:43,921
We must make a stand now!
Stop at nothing!

670
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,643
l told you she wouldn't listen.

671
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,038
We'll have to save
Terrance and Phillip ourselves.

672
00:34:48,328 --> 00:34:49,556
-What?
-Think about it.

673
00:34:49,848 --> 00:34:50,837
What would Brian Boitano do?

674
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:53,482
He'd rescue Terrance and Phillip
before they're executed.

675
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:56,288
We can't do anything.
Our moms' organization is too strong.

676
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:59,326
We'll round up all the grounded kids
and start our own organization.

677
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:01,399
An organization to help save
Terrance and Phillip.

678
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:03,564
Yeah, our own secret club.

679
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,157
-l guess that could work.
-We have to try.

680
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:09,121
What would Brian Boitano do
If he was here right now

681
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:12,599
He'd make a plan and follow through
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

682
00:35:12,808 --> 00:35:15,766
When Brian Boitano was in the Olympics
Skating for the gold

683
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:19,119
He did two salchows and a triple lutz
While wearing a blindfold

684
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:22,161
When Brian Boitano was in the Alps
Fighting grizzly bears

685
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:25,599
He used his magical fire breath
And saved the maidens fair

686
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:28,641
So what would Brian Boitano do
If he were here today

687
00:35:28,848 --> 00:35:32,284
I'm sure he'd kick an ass or two
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

688
00:35:32,528 --> 00:35:35,281
I want this V-chip out of me

689
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:38,366
It has stunted my vocabulary

690
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:41,878
And Ijust want my mom
To stop fighting everyone

691
00:35:42,128 --> 00:35:45,006
For Wendy, I'll be an activist
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

692
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:48,280
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do
He'd call the kids in town

693
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:51,844
And tell them to unite for truth
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

694
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:53,720
Someone say my name?

695
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:56,118
-Who are you?
-l'm Brian Dennehy.

696
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:58,284
What? No, not fucking Brian Dennehy!

697
00:35:58,488 --> 00:36:00,206
Get the fuck out of here.

698
00:36:01,848 --> 00:36:04,567
When Brian Boitano traveled through time
To the year 3010

699
00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:08,444
He fought the evil robot king
To save the human race again

700
00:36:08,648 --> 00:36:11,037
When he built the pyramids
He beat up Kublai Khan

701
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:16,164
Because Brian Boitano
Doesn 't take shit from anybody

702
00:36:16,888 --> 00:36:19,527
So let's all stick together
And unite to stop our moms

703
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:22,919
We'll save Terrance and Phillip too
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

704
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:27,320
We'll save Terrance and Phillip too
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

705
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:29,799
That's what Brian Boitano 'd do

706
00:36:34,728 --> 00:36:36,559
Hey, relax, guy.

707
00:36:36,768 --> 00:36:38,326
There's nothing on.

708
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,325
You get cranky when you're tired.

709
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:41,643
l'm not cranky.

710
00:36:41,848 --> 00:36:46,080
What started as a spat between the U. S.
and Canada is turning into WWIII.

711
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:47,596
World War lll?!

712
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:50,845
Terrance and Phillip will be put
to death for crimes--

713
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:55,722
lt has come to be.
The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh.

714
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:58,436
The time of prophecy is upon us.

715
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:01,924
l love when you get biblical.
You know exactly how to turn my crank.

716
00:37:02,128 --> 00:37:04,881
No, l'm being serious.
lt is the seventh sign.

717
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:05,918
What?

718
00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:07,083
Behold. . .

719
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:09,796
. . .the first signs of my reign
have all come true:

720
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:12,568
The fall of an empire,
the coming of a comet. . .

721
00:37:12,768 --> 00:37:16,477
. . .and now, when the blood of
these Canadians touches American soil. . .

722
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,966
. . .it will be our time to rise.

723
00:37:20,928 --> 00:37:23,761
Yeah, man, l'm getting so hot!
Let's fuck!

724
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:27,438
Do you always think about sex?
l'm talking about important stuff here.

725
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:30,686
l'm just excited about taking over
the world! Come on!

726
00:37:30,968 --> 00:37:33,118
ls sex the only thing
that matters to you?

727
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:34,887
l love you.

728
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:37,117
l want to believe that.

729
00:37:37,328 --> 00:37:40,126
What do you say we shut off
that light and get close?

730
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:47,276
You like that, don't you, bitch?

731
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:52,881
We can use my dad's computer to call
the kids together.

732
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:55,437
Before we put a message out,
do a search on "clitoris. "

733
00:37:58,168 --> 00:38:01,080
"Found: Eight million pages
with the word 'clitoris.' "

734
00:38:01,328 --> 00:38:05,367
l'll just try the first one.
"You must be 1 8 to enter this website. "

735
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:07,525
"Welcome to German Sick Fetish Video.

736
00:38:07,808 --> 00:38:10,606
lf you are under 1 8, do not--"
Well, okay.

737
00:38:13,568 --> 00:38:14,967
lt's a lady getting pooed on!

738
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,318
-ls it Cartman's mom?
-Very funny.

739
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:18,881
lt is Cartman's mom!

740
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:22,924
Son of a bit--!

741
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:25,600
lke, you're too young for this stuff.

742
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:26,644
Bullshitah.

743
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:28,281
What's she doing now?

744
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,047
Click it off, dude!

745
00:38:35,248 --> 00:38:36,840
What's wrong with German people?

746
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,881
Let's do what we came here to do
and put a message out.

747
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:42,397
l've gotta put out
an all-access e-mail.

748
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,077
-Goddamn, your mom sucks!
-Get to the message board!

749
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,637
Can't find a Canadian server.
l'll break into the mainframe.

750
00:38:48,568 --> 00:38:49,796
They've got an access code!

751
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:51,839
l'll try to re-route the encryptions.

752
00:38:55,608 --> 00:38:58,168
Here we go. "Want to help
Terrance and Phillip?

753
00:38:58,448 --> 00:39:02,282
Sneak out after you get tucked into bed
tonight and meet at Carl's warehouse. "

754
00:39:02,528 --> 00:39:04,484
-Tell them we'll have punch and pie.
-We're not.

755
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:07,282
More people will come if they think
we have punch and pie!

756
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:09,927
"Punch and pie.

757
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:13,040
This is top-secret.
The password is. . . . "

758
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:15,206
"La Rsistance. "

759
00:39:16,128 --> 00:39:17,959
So the draft will begin tomorrow...

760
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:20,523
...as more troops are needed
to invade the Canadian border.

761
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:23,720
The Canadian government pleads
for a peaceful resolution...

762
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:24,997
...but we're not listening.

763
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:26,563
Good night, hon.

764
00:39:26,768 --> 00:39:28,963
Mom, when will the war be over?

765
00:39:29,168 --> 00:39:33,639
l don't know, hon. Soon, we hope.
You want it to end quickly, huh?

766
00:39:35,368 --> 00:39:37,199
-Mom?
-Yes, hon?

767
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:41,083
lf you were in a German scheise video,
you'd tell me, right?

768
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,436
Sure, hon. Good night.

769
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:54,644
There's a ghost!

770
00:39:56,368 --> 00:39:57,437
Kenny, is that you?

771
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:01,567
Satan? Satan is coming here?

772
00:40:02,848 --> 00:40:04,964
Saddam Hussein?
That doesn't make sense!

773
00:40:08,488 --> 00:40:09,364
Eric, what is it?

774
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:10,842
l saw him! l saw Kenny!

775
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:12,367
You poor dear.

776
00:40:12,568 --> 00:40:14,160
You've been through so much.

777
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:17,121
l bet him he couldn't light a fart
on fire, and now he's pissed off.

778
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,000
l can't say "pissed off"?

779
00:40:21,048 --> 00:40:23,198
The execution of Terrance and Phillip
is imminent.

780
00:40:23,408 --> 00:40:26,445
Soon, Saddam and l will rule the world.

781
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,641
l got some new luggage
for our trip up to Earth.

782
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:31,917
Let's fuck to celebrate!

783
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:34,483
What's it like up on Earth?
Tell me about it again.

784
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,804
Let's not talk. Let's get busy.

785
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:38,601
Remember when you first got here?

786
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:41,721
We used to talk all night,
until the sun came up.

787
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:44,397
We would just lie in bed and talk.

788
00:40:44,688 --> 00:40:46,883
Because l was waiting to
get you in bed.

789
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:49,477
How come you always want to make love
to me from behind?

790
00:40:49,688 --> 00:40:52,202
ls it because you want to pretend
l'm somebody else?

791
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,558
Satan, your ass is gigantic and red.

792
00:40:54,848 --> 00:40:56,918
Who am l gonna pretend you are?
Liza Minnelli?

793
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:01,164
Don't get all pissy!

794
00:41:08,328 --> 00:41:11,001
Sometimes I think

795
00:41:11,248 --> 00:41:13,842
When I look up real high

796
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:16,921
That there's such a big world up there

797
00:41:17,168 --> 00:41:19,921
I'd like to give it a try

798
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:22,399
But then I sink

799
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:25,321
'Cause it's here I'm supposed to stay

800
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:28,036
But I get so lonely down here

801
00:41:28,248 --> 00:41:31,877
Tell me, why's it have to be that way?

802
00:41:33,088 --> 00:41:35,397
Up there, there is so much room

803
00:41:35,768 --> 00:41:38,328
Where babies burp and flowers bloom

804
00:41:38,568 --> 00:41:41,401
Everyone dreams, I can dream too

805
00:41:41,648 --> 00:41:42,763
Up there

806
00:41:43,048 --> 00:41:46,279
Up where the skies are ocean blue

807
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:49,958
I could be safe and live without a care

808
00:41:50,168 --> 00:41:52,807
Up there

809
00:41:53,568 --> 00:41:55,923
They say I don 't belong

810
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,676
I must stay below alone

811
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:00,966
Because of my beliefs

812
00:42:01,248 --> 00:42:04,524
I'm supposed to stay where evil is sown

813
00:42:05,928 --> 00:42:07,407
But what is evil anyway

814
00:42:07,688 --> 00:42:10,122
Is there reason to the rhyme

815
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:12,399
Without evil there could be no good

816
00:42:12,688 --> 00:42:16,522
So it must be good to be evil sometimes

817
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,528
Up there, there is so much room

818
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:23,276
Where babies burp and flowers bloom

819
00:42:23,568 --> 00:42:25,798
Everyone dreams, I can dream too

820
00:42:26,608 --> 00:42:27,438
Up there

821
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:31,245
Up where the skies are ocean blue

822
00:42:31,528 --> 00:42:35,157
I could be safe and live without a care

823
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,044
Live without a care

824
00:42:38,568 --> 00:42:41,685
If only I could live up there

825
00:42:43,288 --> 00:42:45,597
I want to live, I want to live up

826
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:54,156
I want to live up there

827
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:06,920
-You're late!
-l had to ride my bike here.

828
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,204
-My behind is killing me.
-Your "behind"?

829
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:12,047
l have to say "behind" because
l get shocked if l say "ass. "

830
00:43:12,368 --> 00:43:13,403
Did you bring the punch and pie?

831
00:43:13,608 --> 00:43:15,644
No. You guys, something happened.

832
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,202
l don't think Kenny's dead.

833
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,117
l saw him in my room.

834
00:43:19,328 --> 00:43:21,444
l know, Cartman.
l see Kenny every day.

835
00:43:21,648 --> 00:43:22,717
-You do?
-Sure, dude.

836
00:43:22,928 --> 00:43:25,920
On the face of every child,
on the smile of every baby.

837
00:43:26,328 --> 00:43:29,445
This was Kenny! He said that if
Terrance and Phillip die. . .

838
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:32,845
. . .Saddam Hussein and Satan will
come up and rule the world!

839
00:43:33,048 --> 00:43:34,401
Saddam Hussein?

840
00:43:39,088 --> 00:43:39,884
Who is it?

841
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:41,647
l'm here for La Rsistance.

842
00:43:41,848 --> 00:43:42,724
What's the password?

843
00:43:42,928 --> 00:43:44,043
l don't know.

844
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:45,363
Guess.

845
00:43:46,288 --> 00:43:47,482
Bacon.

846
00:43:50,368 --> 00:43:52,245
Viva La Rsistance !

847
00:43:52,528 --> 00:43:53,643
Oh, no! lt's that kid!

848
00:43:53,848 --> 00:43:55,201
This is the place.

849
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:57,959
Stan? You started La Rsistance ?

850
00:43:59,248 --> 00:44:01,045
You're more political than we thought.

851
00:44:01,288 --> 00:44:03,643
Let us get this meeting underway.
Many others are coming.

852
00:44:06,648 --> 00:44:07,763
A lot of people showed up.

853
00:44:11,008 --> 00:44:15,479
Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be
killed, and we think that sucks ass!

854
00:44:18,168 --> 00:44:20,636
We were to understand there'd be
pie and punch.

855
00:44:20,848 --> 00:44:21,678
There isn't any.

856
00:44:25,808 --> 00:44:27,958
Terrance and Phillip are
supposed to be killed. . .

857
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,318
. . .so we should prank call
a bunch of policemen. . .

858
00:44:30,528 --> 00:44:32,723
. . .and have pizzas sent to them
that they didn't order.

859
00:44:32,928 --> 00:44:34,805
Viva La Rsistance !

860
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:39,007
-May l?
-What?

861
00:44:39,608 --> 00:44:42,998
Terrance and Phillip are being held
in a camp two kilometers from town.

862
00:44:43,208 --> 00:44:45,847
They are to be executed tomorrow
during a star-studded USO show.

863
00:44:46,048 --> 00:44:46,924
Tomorrow?

864
00:44:47,128 --> 00:44:48,527
Once the show begins,
we'll have an hour. . .

865
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,923
. . .to get them out of their cell
and into this clearing.

866
00:44:51,168 --> 00:44:54,365
There, we will rendezvous
and take them back to Canada.

867
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:56,479
Dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.

868
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:58,719
Meet me at the rendezvous point
at 1 0 p.m.

869
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:01,601
Sneaking in and breaking them out
will be dangerous. . .

870
00:45:01,888 --> 00:45:02,764
. . .so l'll go myself.

871
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:05,403
No! We're going!

872
00:45:06,448 --> 00:45:09,520
We started La Rsistance. We'll get
them and meet at the rendezvous point.

873
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:12,117
This will be very dangerous.
Are you quite sure?

874
00:45:12,328 --> 00:45:13,158
Fuck that!

875
00:45:13,368 --> 00:45:17,486
Do you want that V-chip in you forever?
We'll go. Let's run through the plan.

876
00:45:27,168 --> 00:45:31,878
Oh, boy! Military action, Ned!
Let's kill us some goddamn Australians!

877
00:45:32,088 --> 00:45:34,124
l think we're fighting Canadians.

878
00:45:34,368 --> 00:45:36,245
Canadians, Australians,
what's the difference?

879
00:45:36,448 --> 00:45:40,680
This uniform makes me feel like
a tough, brute man, Mr. Hat.

880
00:45:40,888 --> 00:45:42,526
lt sure does, Mr. Garrison.

881
00:45:42,768 --> 00:45:44,520
l can't wait
for our first shore leave. . .

882
00:45:44,768 --> 00:45:47,726
. . .so l can get me
some fucking poon tang.

883
00:45:48,168 --> 00:45:52,127
Pay attention! Tomorrow night is
the USO show for all you troops.

884
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:55,525
There will be celebrities, followed by
the execution of Terrance and Phillip.

885
00:45:57,408 --> 00:46:01,287
After the show, we will finally be
sending ground troops into Canada.

886
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:02,643
So let's strategize.

887
00:46:02,848 --> 00:46:03,883
Map!

888
00:46:04,608 --> 00:46:06,519
Our sources have told us
that the Canadians. . .

889
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:09,606
. . .are preparing for our invasion,
so we must use caution.

890
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,878
Each battalion has
a specific code name and mission.

891
00:46:12,088 --> 00:46:13,760
Battalion 5, raise your hands.

892
00:46:14,368 --> 00:46:16,643
You will be the all-important
first attack wave. . .

893
00:46:16,848 --> 00:46:19,043
. . .which we will call
"Operation Human Shield. "

894
00:46:19,448 --> 00:46:20,517
Wait a minute!

895
00:46:20,728 --> 00:46:23,481
Keep in mind Operation Human Shield
will suffer heavy losses.

896
00:46:23,728 --> 00:46:25,480
Battalion 1 4?

897
00:46:25,728 --> 00:46:28,162
Right. You are
Operation Get-Behind-the-Darkies.

898
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,678
You will follow Battalion 5.
Try not to get killed, for God's sake.

899
00:46:31,968 --> 00:46:33,287
Are there any questions?

900
00:46:33,928 --> 00:46:34,724
Yes, soldier.

901
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:36,884
Have you ever heard
of the Emancipation Proclamation?

902
00:46:37,488 --> 00:46:38,762
l don't listen to hip-hop.

903
00:46:39,168 --> 00:46:43,047
After that, we will march into
the heart of Canada, and we will--

904
00:46:43,248 --> 00:46:44,840
I'm gonna get you!

905
00:46:45,048 --> 00:46:46,640
What's wrong with this thing?

906
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:49,001
lt's fucking Windows 98!

907
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:50,357
Get Bill Gates in here!

908
00:46:53,968 --> 00:46:57,643
You told us Windows 98 would be faster,
with better access to the lnternet!

909
00:46:57,968 --> 00:46:59,765
lt is faster. Over 5 million--

910
00:47:01,248 --> 00:47:02,761
All right, men, get lots of rest. . .

911
00:47:02,968 --> 00:47:05,528
. . .and prepare to. . . .

912
00:47:08,488 --> 00:47:10,683
After you have Terrance and Phillip,
make your way to this ridge.

913
00:47:10,888 --> 00:47:12,719
We will wait for you.
But not for long.

914
00:47:12,968 --> 00:47:14,720
So if you're not there at 1 0,
we'll have to leave.

915
00:47:15,368 --> 00:47:18,326
You're brave, but you'll need help
from someone who's done this before.

916
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:20,206
Here's the address of "The Mole. "

917
00:47:21,248 --> 00:47:24,957
He is an expert in covert operations.
Your first task will be obtaining him.

918
00:47:25,168 --> 00:47:29,525
Get lots of sleep. Tomorrow we will
all be risking our lives for freedom.

919
00:47:29,728 --> 00:47:33,323
God has smiled upon you this day

920
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:38,566
The fate of a nation in your hands

921
00:47:39,008 --> 00:47:41,238
And blessed be the children here

922
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:43,962
Who fight with all our bravery

923
00:47:44,248 --> 00:47:48,400
Till only the righteous stand

924
00:47:48,968 --> 00:47:52,040
You see the distant flames
They bellow in the night

925
00:47:52,248 --> 00:47:55,365
You fight in all our names
For what we know is right

926
00:47:55,568 --> 00:47:58,287
And when you all get shot
And cannot carry on

927
00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:01,162
Though you die, La Rsistance lives on

928
00:48:01,808 --> 00:48:04,641
You may get stabbed in the head
With a dagger or a sword

929
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:08,045
You may be burned to death
Or skinned alive or worse

930
00:48:08,248 --> 00:48:11,046
But when they torture you
You will not feel the need to run

931
00:48:11,248 --> 00:48:13,967
For though you die,
La Rsistance lives on

932
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:17,041
Blame Canada
Blame Canada

933
00:48:17,248 --> 00:48:20,160
Because the country's gone awry
Tomorrow night these freaks will fry

934
00:48:21,368 --> 00:48:23,962
Tomorrow night
Our lives will change

935
00:48:24,328 --> 00:48:27,047
Tomorrow night
We'll be entertained

936
00:48:27,368 --> 00:48:30,883
An execution, what a sight
Tomorrow night

937
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:33,722
Up there, there's so much room
Where babies burp and flowers bloom

938
00:48:33,928 --> 00:48:36,840
Tomorrow night up there is doomed
And so I will be going soon

939
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:39,164
Shut your fucking face
Uncle fucker

940
00:48:39,448 --> 00:48:42,281
You're a boner-biting bastard
Uncle fucker

941
00:48:42,728 --> 00:48:45,845
-Looks like we may be out of luck
-Tomorrow night, we're pretty fucked

942
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,403
Why did our mothers start this war
What the fuck are they fighting for

943
00:48:48,688 --> 00:48:50,326
When did this song become a marathon

944
00:48:51,568 --> 00:48:54,287
When Canada is dead and gone
There'll be no more Celine Dion

945
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:56,996
They may cut your dick in half
And serve it to a pig

946
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:59,961
And though it hurts, you'll laugh
And dance a dickless jig

947
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,918
That's the way it goes
In war you're shat upon

948
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:06,325
Though you die
La Rsistance lives on

949
00:49:18,808 --> 00:49:22,323
l'm so excited. Just one more day
until we can take over the world.

950
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:24,877
l don't know if l can sleep,
if you know what l mean.

951
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:28,683
This book talks about how people
communicate differently.

952
00:49:28,888 --> 00:49:32,005
l communicate by wanting you
to ask me questions, and you--

953
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:34,358
That is interesting. Let's fuck!

954
00:49:34,648 --> 00:49:38,323
Saddam, l'm trying to have
a nice conversation with you!

955
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:41,318
Now that is just not appropriate!

956
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:44,327
Come on, l'm just fucking with you!
lt's not real!

957
00:49:44,608 --> 00:49:47,680
-Well, that's still not appropriate.
-Hey, daddy.

958
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,684
lt's not real, either! Come on, guy!

959
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:59,881
Soon the world will belong to me.

960
00:50:02,328 --> 00:50:05,525
lt's Saddam.
He doesn't nurture my emotions.

961
00:50:05,768 --> 00:50:08,919
He just wants sex and can't learn
to communicate.

962
00:50:10,168 --> 00:50:12,887
You're right. l should leave him.
l'll tell him. . .

963
00:50:13,128 --> 00:50:15,596
. . . "Saddam, l'm going to Earth
to rule alone! "

964
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:18,800
l'm strong and l don't need him!

965
00:50:22,608 --> 00:50:24,485
Today's the day for the USO show

966
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:26,326
We're so happy we get to go

967
00:50:26,768 --> 00:50:28,679
I don 't know but I've been told

968
00:50:28,928 --> 00:50:30,327
Canadian pussy is mighty cold

969
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,484
Stay in the attic,
because if they find you. . .

970
00:50:32,768 --> 00:50:34,440
. . .they'll put you in
a concentration camp.

971
00:50:35,968 --> 00:50:37,924
Don't worry.
We'll put an end to this.

972
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:41,285
Then l'll make Mom come home,
and we'll all be a family again.

973
00:51:02,968 --> 00:51:04,606
We need to speak with The Mole.

974
00:51:04,968 --> 00:51:08,517
l'm sorry. The Mole is grounded.
He can't come out and play.

975
00:51:08,728 --> 00:51:09,763
-What?!
-He's a kid?

976
00:51:09,968 --> 00:51:12,004
He said very naughty things about God.

977
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:14,483
Can we just talk to him
for five seconds?

978
00:51:14,728 --> 00:51:17,640
Well, all right. Christophe!

979
00:51:19,248 --> 00:51:22,206
We're gonna rescue Terrance
and Phillip from the USO show--

980
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:23,844
Who sent you?

981
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:25,686
Gregory! He said
you could sneak us in.

982
00:51:25,888 --> 00:51:28,118
Are you telling me you intend
to break into the USO show. . .

983
00:51:28,368 --> 00:51:31,326
. . .filled with thousands of soldiers
and break out Terrance and Phillip?

984
00:51:31,568 --> 00:51:33,160
l thought it was a stupid idea too.

985
00:51:33,448 --> 00:51:36,724
We're La Rsistance. We wanna save
Terrance and Phillip and stop the war.

986
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:39,687
l can't help you.
l'm grounded for the next three days.

987
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,004
So are we. Our parents think
we're home right now.

988
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:43,527
-Why are you grounded?
-Why?

989
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:46,680
Because God hates me.
He has made my life miserable.

990
00:51:46,888 --> 00:51:49,356
So l call Him a cocksucking asshole,
and l get grounded.

991
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:51,240
-So will you help us?
-Very well.

992
00:51:51,448 --> 00:51:54,246
Meet me in the backyard
in five minutes. Viva La Rsistance.

993
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:56,120
We'll show God that we won't fucking--

994
00:51:56,328 --> 00:51:57,727
What? Christophe, get in here!

995
00:51:57,928 --> 00:51:59,281
Coming, mother.

996
00:52:00,528 --> 00:52:03,247
l must be strong. l must be strong.

997
00:52:03,728 --> 00:52:05,525
Saddam, l need to talk to you.

998
00:52:05,728 --> 00:52:09,323
Get packing, bitch. We have to go!
We're running out of time!

999
00:52:09,568 --> 00:52:12,640
Saddam, sometimes you can love
a person very much. . .

1000
00:52:12,848 --> 00:52:14,566
. . .but still know
they aren't right for you.

1001
00:52:14,768 --> 00:52:16,281
What are you talking about?

1002
00:52:16,528 --> 00:52:18,723
You treat me like shit!
l'm leaving you!

1003
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,805
l'm going up to Earth to rule alone.

1004
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:23,480
No! No, you can't do that!

1005
00:52:23,728 --> 00:52:25,764
l'm sorry, but l have to be strong.

1006
00:52:25,968 --> 00:52:28,482
Give me another chance!
l have to go to Earth!

1007
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,002
You don't have respect for me!

1008
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,563
Sure l do, guy.
Please just hear me out.

1009
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:39,605
Some people say that I'm a bad guy

1010
00:52:39,888 --> 00:52:42,356
They may be right
They may be right

1011
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:46,519
But it's not as if I don 't try

1012
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:49,117
Ijust fuck up, try as I might

1013
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:51,724
But I can change, I can change

1014
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:54,960
I can learn to keep my promises
I swear it

1015
00:52:55,168 --> 00:52:56,840
I'll open up my heart
And I will share it

1016
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,039
Any minute now, I will be born again

1017
00:53:00,528 --> 00:53:02,405
Yes I can change, I can change

1018
00:53:02,608 --> 00:53:04,997
I know I've been
A dirty little bastard

1019
00:53:05,568 --> 00:53:07,638
I like to kill, I like to maim
I'm insane, but it's okay

1020
00:53:07,848 --> 00:53:09,076
'Cause I can change

1021
00:53:10,528 --> 00:53:12,723
It's not my fault that I'm so evil

1022
00:53:12,928 --> 00:53:15,317
It's society, society

1023
00:53:16,328 --> 00:53:18,444
You see my parents
Were sometimes abusive

1024
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:20,798
And it made a prick of me

1025
00:53:21,288 --> 00:53:23,040
But I can change, I can change

1026
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:25,444
What if you remain
A sandy little butthole

1027
00:53:25,648 --> 00:53:29,118
Don 't be such a twit
Mother Teresa won 't have shit on me

1028
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:31,757
Just watch me change
Here l go. l'm changing!

1029
00:53:54,888 --> 00:53:56,526
You see, l've really matured.

1030
00:53:56,728 --> 00:53:58,002
All right.

1031
00:53:59,128 --> 00:54:00,561
Come on, we have to hurry.

1032
00:54:00,968 --> 00:54:01,878
l love you.

1033
00:54:05,688 --> 00:54:07,918
Ladies and gentlemen
of the American Army...

1034
00:54:08,168 --> 00:54:10,682
... welcome to the USO show.

1035
00:54:11,528 --> 00:54:14,122
Get ready for loads of entertainment
and fabulous celebrities...

1036
00:54:14,368 --> 00:54:18,122
...followed immediately by
the execution of Terrance and Phillip.

1037
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:26,443
This is where those military bitches
intend to kill Terrance and Phillip.

1038
00:54:26,648 --> 00:54:27,444
Oh, my God!

1039
00:54:27,648 --> 00:54:29,684
God? He is the biggest bitch
of them all.

1040
00:54:29,928 --> 00:54:32,522
Hurry. We rendezvous
with the other kids at 1 0.

1041
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:37,125
You realize we could be grounded
for two, even three weeks.

1042
00:54:37,328 --> 00:54:39,478
-We're willing to take that risk.
-Let's go.

1043
00:54:39,728 --> 00:54:43,403
And now, here are your hosts
for the evening, Sheila Broflovski...

1044
00:54:43,608 --> 00:54:45,564
...and Big Gay Al.

1045
00:54:47,768 --> 00:54:50,407
Al, tonight is a very special night.
Do you know why?

1046
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:52,280
They're having a sale at Merv's?

1047
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:56,327
No. Because we're going
to abolish Canadian smut.

1048
00:54:56,928 --> 00:54:59,761
That's right, Sheila.
Bring out the condemned.

1049
00:55:04,048 --> 00:55:06,960
Today is a great day for democracy!

1050
00:55:08,848 --> 00:55:12,921
This is worse than when you put your
dick in my mouth and took a picture.

1051
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:14,481
l know, Terrance. l know.

1052
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,721
While you're getting set up over there,
let's bring out our first act:

1053
00:55:18,968 --> 00:55:21,323
Yippie, the back-flipping dog!

1054
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:34,807
Be careful not to touch this wire.

1055
00:55:36,088 --> 00:55:37,919
Motherfuck--

1056
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,601
Fuck.

1057
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:47,322
The show has started.
We're running out of time.

1058
00:55:48,168 --> 00:55:49,237
Do you see Terrance and Phillip?

1059
00:55:49,448 --> 00:55:51,325
Yes, but they are heavily guarded.

1060
00:55:51,968 --> 00:55:53,447
Dig from here,
so as not to be seen.

1061
00:55:53,648 --> 00:55:55,081
Come on, bitches.

1062
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:58,320
Mole, do you know where
the clitoris is?

1063
00:55:58,568 --> 00:55:59,637
-The what?
-The clitoris.

1064
00:55:59,848 --> 00:56:02,123
l have to find it,
so l can get Wendy to like me.

1065
00:56:02,368 --> 00:56:03,960
Stop thinking with your dick!

1066
00:56:04,168 --> 00:56:06,443
Be on your toes, because l won't
be grounded again!

1067
00:56:06,648 --> 00:56:07,842
Not for you! Not for anybody!

1068
00:56:08,648 --> 00:56:11,401
Men, when you're out there
in the battlefield. . .

1069
00:56:11,608 --> 00:56:13,724
. . .and you're looking into
the beady eyes of a Canadian. . .

1070
00:56:14,008 --> 00:56:16,647
. . .as he charges you with
his hockey stick or whatever he has. . .

1071
00:56:16,848 --> 00:56:21,319
. . .and people are dying all around you,
just remember what the MPAA says:

1072
00:56:21,528 --> 00:56:26,443
"Deplorable violence is okay as long as
people don't say any naughty words. "

1073
00:56:26,768 --> 00:56:29,566
That is what this war is all about.

1074
00:56:30,968 --> 00:56:32,117
What?

1075
00:56:34,288 --> 00:56:35,323
Shit!

1076
00:56:37,248 --> 00:56:38,283
Move, move.

1077
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:42,724
We will split up here.
Let's synchronize watches.

1078
00:56:43,648 --> 00:56:45,479
-We don't have watches.
-You don't?

1079
00:56:45,728 --> 00:56:47,639
-You didn't say anything about watches.
-What do you think this is?

1080
00:56:47,848 --> 00:56:51,079
TV kiddie hour where we sit around
and lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy?

1081
00:56:51,288 --> 00:56:53,085
This is real life, with consequences
you take to the grave.

1082
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:54,801
-We don't have watches.
-Shit!

1083
00:56:55,008 --> 00:56:56,123
-Did you bring the mirror?
-Got it.

1084
00:56:56,368 --> 00:56:57,517
-And the rope?
-Check.

1085
00:56:57,728 --> 00:56:59,446
-And the buttfor?
-What's a "buttfor"?

1086
00:56:59,648 --> 00:57:01,559
For pooping, silly.

1087
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:06,763
l'll dig under the stage. With
that bedrock, l'll need more time.

1088
00:57:06,968 --> 00:57:09,436
Stan and Kyle, stall the show
anyway you can.

1089
00:57:09,648 --> 00:57:11,878
Keep that show going
until l get the prisoners.

1090
00:57:12,648 --> 00:57:14,400
Cartman, over there is
the electrical box.

1091
00:57:14,608 --> 00:57:17,122
Shut it off before l return
with Terrance and Phillip. . .

1092
00:57:17,328 --> 00:57:19,762
. . .or the alarm will sound
and l'll be attacked by dogs.

1093
00:57:20,008 --> 00:57:20,838
Got it?

1094
00:57:21,048 --> 00:57:23,482
You must shut off the alarms.
l fucking hate guard dogs!

1095
00:57:23,728 --> 00:57:25,844
l heard you,
you British piece of shit.

1096
00:57:26,048 --> 00:57:28,482
lf anything goes wrong, make a sound
like a dying giraffe.

1097
00:57:28,728 --> 00:57:30,081
What's a dying giraffe sound like?

1098
00:57:34,408 --> 00:57:35,966
-Let's go.
-Be careful, dude.

1099
00:57:36,168 --> 00:57:38,728
Was my mother careful when she
stabbed me in the heart. . .

1100
00:57:38,928 --> 00:57:41,681
. . .with a clothes hanger,
while l was still in the womb?

1101
00:57:45,688 --> 00:57:47,440
Damn, that kid is fucked up.

1102
00:57:47,688 --> 00:57:49,087
How are those chairs coming?

1103
00:57:49,528 --> 00:57:51,519
Al, we're minutes away.

1104
00:57:51,728 --> 00:57:56,438
Super. Here is pint-sized pixie
and darling of the indie movie scene. . .

1105
00:57:56,768 --> 00:57:58,838
. . .Winona Ryder!

1106
00:57:59,048 --> 00:58:00,481
Hi, guys.

1107
00:58:01,048 --> 00:58:02,686
l'm super-psyched to be here today.

1108
00:58:02,928 --> 00:58:06,284
What you're doing for our country
is so cool.

1109
00:58:06,488 --> 00:58:09,719
l mean war, man. Wow, war.

1110
00:58:09,928 --> 00:58:12,078
You know? Wow.

1111
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:16,918
Okay, and now for your enjoyment,
here's my famous Ping-Pong ball trick.

1112
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:25,918
Oh, my!

1113
00:58:26,688 --> 00:58:28,360
"Shut off the power, Cartman.

1114
00:58:28,568 --> 00:58:30,524
This is very important, Cartman. "

1115
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:33,441
-Did you hear what Winona Ryder's doing?
-We can't miss this.

1116
00:58:37,648 --> 00:58:42,119
There. l didn't miss one.
That's my Ping-Pong ball trick!

1117
00:58:45,608 --> 00:58:47,724
That's all the acts we have
for tonight. . .

1118
00:58:47,928 --> 00:58:50,442
. . .so let's just get on with
the execution!

1119
00:58:51,488 --> 00:58:53,638
-No, we have to stall him.
-More! More!

1120
00:58:53,848 --> 00:58:55,327
Yeah! More!

1121
00:58:55,528 --> 00:58:58,247
You big sillies.
You want to see more of me?

1122
00:58:58,448 --> 00:59:00,803
Yeah! Big Gay Al! Big Gay Al!

1123
00:59:02,608 --> 00:59:05,759
Well, l do have a little song l wrote
about the war.

1124
00:59:06,048 --> 00:59:07,401
But we haven't rehearsed.

1125
00:59:07,608 --> 00:59:09,041
Sing it!

1126
00:59:09,688 --> 00:59:10,643
l can't.

1127
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:12,201
Sing the fucking song!

1128
00:59:12,488 --> 00:59:15,002
All right. lf you insist,
l'll sing my song.

1129
00:59:15,288 --> 00:59:17,563
l believe it goes
a little bit like this.

1130
00:59:19,728 --> 00:59:21,605
Bombs are flying

1131
00:59:21,888 --> 00:59:23,526
People are dying

1132
00:59:23,808 --> 00:59:26,641
Children are crying
Politicians are lying too

1133
00:59:27,768 --> 00:59:29,759
Cancer is killing

1134
00:59:30,128 --> 00:59:31,607
Texaco 's spilling

1135
00:59:32,648 --> 00:59:35,082
The whole world's gone to hell
But how are you?

1136
00:59:36,328 --> 00:59:38,922
I'm super
Thanks for asking

1137
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,766
I couldn 't be better

1138
00:59:40,968 --> 00:59:42,196
I must say

1139
00:59:42,408 --> 00:59:43,602
I'm feeling super

1140
00:59:43,808 --> 00:59:45,605
No, nothing bugs me

1141
00:59:45,808 --> 00:59:47,127
Everything is super when you're--

1142
00:59:47,328 --> 00:59:49,637
Don 't you think I look cute
In this hat

1143
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:54,361
I'm so sorry, Mr. Cripple

1144
00:59:54,568 --> 00:59:57,207
But Ijust can 't feel too bad
For you right now

1145
00:59:57,408 --> 01:00:00,286
Because I'm feeling
So insanely super

1146
01:00:00,488 --> 01:00:03,605
That even the fact that you can 't walk
Can 't bring me down

1147
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:06,561
He's super
Thanks for asking

1148
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:09,441
All things considered
He couldn 't be better, he must say

1149
01:00:09,728 --> 01:00:10,843
I'm super

1150
01:00:11,048 --> 01:00:12,242
No, nothing bugs me

1151
01:00:13,328 --> 01:00:16,126
Don 't you think I look cute in this hat

1152
01:00:16,368 --> 01:00:18,928
These pants
This matching tie I got at Merv's

1153
01:00:19,368 --> 01:00:21,484
In the barracks
And the trenches as well

1154
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:25,158
-Stick 'em up!
-Big Gay Al says you have to tell

1155
01:00:25,448 --> 01:00:27,723
Yes, he's super
And he's proud to be gay

1156
01:00:28,488 --> 01:00:32,117
Everything is super
When you're gay

1157
01:00:35,888 --> 01:00:36,843
When you're gay

1158
01:00:39,088 --> 01:00:40,441
Again! Again!

1159
01:00:48,848 --> 01:00:49,963
Who's there?

1160
01:00:51,168 --> 01:00:52,442
Son of a gun! Heck!

1161
01:00:53,848 --> 01:00:55,201
They're coming?

1162
01:00:56,048 --> 01:00:58,039
But our moms won't listen to us.

1163
01:01:03,648 --> 01:01:07,323
Okay, everybody, just want to
thank our wonderful sponsors. . . .

1164
01:01:08,968 --> 01:01:10,003
He's almost got them.

1165
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,597
We're here to rescue you.
Follow me through the tunnel.

1166
01:01:13,088 --> 01:01:15,477
You guys! Seriously.
l saw Kenny again.

1167
01:01:15,728 --> 01:01:17,525
Did you shut the alarm off?

1168
01:01:20,568 --> 01:01:21,887
Oh, shit!

1169
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:25,722
Hear that?
Sounds like a dying giraffe.

1170
01:01:27,088 --> 01:01:27,838
Shit!

1171
01:01:28,048 --> 01:01:29,800
-A spy!
-Get him!

1172
01:01:30,928 --> 01:01:32,566
Shit! Shit!

1173
01:01:36,008 --> 01:01:37,157
Come on, Mole!

1174
01:01:37,648 --> 01:01:40,287
Shit! Shit!
Fucking guard dogs! Shit!

1175
01:01:40,968 --> 01:01:42,321
The alarms went off.

1176
01:01:42,568 --> 01:01:43,887
That was my bad. Sorry.

1177
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:46,524
Hold me. lt's so very cold.

1178
01:01:46,768 --> 01:01:48,486
There is no hope. Get out.

1179
01:01:48,728 --> 01:01:50,639
-We can't leave without you.
-lt's okay.

1180
01:01:50,888 --> 01:01:53,038
No, we can't.
We don't know where we are!

1181
01:01:53,288 --> 01:01:55,244
Where's your God
when you need him?

1182
01:01:55,448 --> 01:01:58,440
Where is your beautiful,
merciful faggot now?

1183
01:01:58,648 --> 01:01:59,603
Here l come, God.

1184
01:01:59,808 --> 01:02:01,480
Here l come, you fucking rat.

1185
01:02:01,688 --> 01:02:03,997
Now the light she fades

1186
01:02:04,368 --> 01:02:07,280
And darkness settles in

1187
01:02:07,528 --> 01:02:09,120
But I will find strength

1188
01:02:09,368 --> 01:02:11,836
-No, Mole, hang on.
-I will find pride within

1189
01:02:12,088 --> 01:02:14,602
-We'll get you home.
-Because although I die

1190
01:02:14,848 --> 01:02:17,408
-l can't face my mother.
-Our freedom will be won

1191
01:02:17,648 --> 01:02:18,603
Not alone.

1192
01:02:18,808 --> 01:02:21,003
Though I die

1193
01:02:21,248 --> 01:02:23,921
La Rsistance lives...

1194
01:02:24,488 --> 01:02:25,557
...on

1195
01:02:36,808 --> 01:02:37,923
Shit!

1196
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:42,286
Okay, here it is. The moment we've
all been awaiting: the execution!

1197
01:02:46,968 --> 01:02:48,924
The day is ours!

1198
01:02:50,168 --> 01:02:52,523
We have to tell them about
Saddam Hussein and Satan.

1199
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:56,283
-No. My mom can't see me here.
-You have to stand up to your mother.

1200
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:59,446
Gentlemen, do you have
any last words?

1201
01:02:59,648 --> 01:03:02,958
Last words? How's aboot,
"Get me the fuck out of this chair! "

1202
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:04,118
How's that?

1203
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:07,166
All right, anonymous, ready the switch.

1204
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:09,357
Wait!

1205
01:03:12,968 --> 01:03:14,321
Go on, dude, tell her.

1206
01:03:14,648 --> 01:03:17,082
-l can't.
-You can't kill Terrance and Phillip.

1207
01:03:17,328 --> 01:03:20,445
lf they die, Satan and Saddam Hussein
will take over the world.

1208
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:27,079
Throw the switch, Mr. Garrison.

1209
01:03:27,328 --> 01:03:29,637
l'm supposed to be anonymous.

1210
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,687
Goodbye, bastards!

1211
01:03:41,168 --> 01:03:44,205
The Canadians are attacking!
Run for your lives!

1212
01:03:44,728 --> 01:03:46,161
We have to shut off the power!

1213
01:03:47,528 --> 01:03:48,722
Fuck!

1214
01:03:50,408 --> 01:03:52,080
Some little fat kid saved us!

1215
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:01,405
Wait! We have to get you
to the rendezvous point.

1216
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:06,366
Ned, behind you!

1217
01:04:24,088 --> 01:04:26,363
Be not afraid.

1218
01:04:26,568 --> 01:04:27,478
Oh, my God!

1219
01:04:27,688 --> 01:04:29,599
Behold my glory.

1220
01:04:29,808 --> 01:04:30,923
What are you?

1221
01:04:31,128 --> 01:04:33,084
l am the clitoris.

1222
01:04:33,288 --> 01:04:35,483
The clitoris?
l found the clitoris!

1223
01:04:35,688 --> 01:04:39,761
Stan, you must not let Terrance and
Phillip's blood spill on the ground.

1224
01:04:40,048 --> 01:04:41,800
Tell me how to get Wendy to like me.

1225
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:43,964
There are more important matters
right now.

1226
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:47,564
l looked all over for you.
Tell me how to get Wendy to like me.

1227
01:04:47,768 --> 01:04:50,282
Dude, just have confidence in yourself.

1228
01:04:50,488 --> 01:04:52,444
Believe in yourself, and others
will believe in you.

1229
01:04:53,008 --> 01:04:55,681
Chicks love confidence.
Now go. Hurry!

1230
01:04:55,888 --> 01:04:58,356
The clitoris has spoken.

1231
01:04:58,568 --> 01:04:59,842
Stan, are you okay?

1232
01:05:00,048 --> 01:05:03,723
l see you failed. l should not
have sent a boy to do a man's job.

1233
01:05:04,848 --> 01:05:07,442
Come on!
We've got precious little time!

1234
01:05:10,688 --> 01:05:12,679
Die, Canadian, m'kay?

1235
01:05:16,008 --> 01:05:17,441
Did you hear that?
l farted.

1236
01:05:17,688 --> 01:05:19,485
You did? Just now?

1237
01:05:20,728 --> 01:05:23,447
-Terrance and Phillip!
-Let's get to the rendezvous point!

1238
01:05:23,648 --> 01:05:24,922
lt's Mr. Garrison.

1239
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:30,237
Children, take Mr. Hat.
Please get him out of here.

1240
01:05:30,648 --> 01:05:34,118
Holy shit!
This V-chip is getting all screwy.

1241
01:05:34,328 --> 01:05:35,920
Take cover in the trench!

1242
01:05:36,168 --> 01:05:39,797
Human Shield up front, then
Operation Get-Behind-the-Darkies.

1243
01:05:40,448 --> 01:05:43,758
Remember, Human Shield,
protect our tanks and planes too.

1244
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:49,527
Holy mother of Jehoshaphat!

1245
01:05:49,728 --> 01:05:50,558
Fire on my command.

1246
01:05:50,768 --> 01:05:52,963
All right, squad, just like l told you.

1247
01:05:54,128 --> 01:05:56,437
One. . .two. . .

1248
01:05:56,688 --> 01:05:58,246
Do some people gonna die?

1249
01:05:58,488 --> 01:05:59,523
-Fire!
-. . .three!

1250
01:06:00,808 --> 01:06:01,957
What in the--

1251
01:06:02,648 --> 01:06:03,683
Great plan, Chef.

1252
01:06:03,928 --> 01:06:05,646
Operation Human Shield, my ass!

1253
01:06:08,568 --> 01:06:10,559
My God, this is terrible.

1254
01:06:10,808 --> 01:06:12,400
This is what we wanted!

1255
01:06:12,648 --> 01:06:16,482
We wanted our children to be
brought up in a smut-free environment!

1256
01:06:16,728 --> 01:06:18,446
But we didn't want this.

1257
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:20,327
Where are you going?

1258
01:06:20,688 --> 01:06:22,406
We're going to find our boys.

1259
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:25,998
For God's sake, Sheila, we're
going to get them killed!

1260
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,877
All those times l said
you were a big dumb Jew?

1261
01:06:34,088 --> 01:06:36,477
l didn't mean it. You're not a Jew.

1262
01:06:36,888 --> 01:06:39,004
Yes, l am! l am a Jew, Cartman!

1263
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:40,960
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1264
01:06:41,928 --> 01:06:43,839
Why am l still holding this?

1265
01:06:44,328 --> 01:06:45,886
Mr. Hat! No!

1266
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:48,847
Fuck this. l'm getting out
before l get in trouble.

1267
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,316
l heard that.

1268
01:06:51,128 --> 01:06:53,961
l found the clitoris.
Now l can get Wendy to like me again.

1269
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,084
Swell, Stan.

1270
01:06:55,288 --> 01:06:58,837
l guess all's well that ends well.
We can go home now. Dipshit.

1271
01:06:59,528 --> 01:07:00,438
What's wrong?

1272
01:07:00,688 --> 01:07:04,522
We can't let Terrance and Phillip die,
or the whole world will end.

1273
01:07:05,768 --> 01:07:06,757
Terrance, look!

1274
01:07:06,968 --> 01:07:07,798
There they are!

1275
01:07:08,008 --> 01:07:09,487
Phillip, we're done for!

1276
01:07:09,728 --> 01:07:11,639
All right, men! Fire!

1277
01:07:11,888 --> 01:07:13,321
Goodbye, Terrance.

1278
01:07:18,008 --> 01:07:18,918
What is this?

1279
01:07:19,128 --> 01:07:20,038
Don't shoot!

1280
01:07:20,248 --> 01:07:24,207
l'll take care of this.
Kids, get out of the way now!

1281
01:07:29,888 --> 01:07:32,038
l'm not going to let you kill them, Mom!

1282
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:33,203
What, what, what?

1283
01:07:33,408 --> 01:07:35,319
l'm not moving!

1284
01:07:37,168 --> 01:07:40,365
Stand down. You can still see
fart jokes on Nickelodeon.

1285
01:07:40,568 --> 01:07:42,684
No! This is about
more than fart jokes!

1286
01:07:42,928 --> 01:07:45,283
This is about freedom of speech,
about censorship. . .

1287
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:47,519
. . .and stuff.

1288
01:07:47,728 --> 01:07:50,959
What about lke? Did you forget
your adopted son is Canadian?

1289
01:07:53,488 --> 01:07:56,048
l'm doing very important things.

1290
01:07:56,248 --> 01:07:58,443
But you never took the time
to talk to me.

1291
01:07:58,688 --> 01:08:01,646
Whenever l get in trouble,
you blame everybody else.

1292
01:08:01,888 --> 01:08:04,197
But l'm the one to blame.
Deal with me.

1293
01:08:04,408 --> 01:08:06,444
You keep fighting all these causes.

1294
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:08,167
But l don't want a fighter.

1295
01:08:08,368 --> 01:08:09,881
l want my mom.

1296
01:08:13,688 --> 01:08:15,041
Poor little fella!

1297
01:08:20,608 --> 01:08:21,643
Holy shit, dude!

1298
01:08:21,888 --> 01:08:23,321
Young man, you watch your mouth!

1299
01:08:31,648 --> 01:08:33,400
My time has come!

1300
01:08:33,648 --> 01:08:35,764
You are really fucked now!

1301
01:08:35,968 --> 01:08:38,118
lt's Saddam Hussein! Shoot him!

1302
01:08:39,688 --> 01:08:40,518
What a dumb ass!

1303
01:08:44,448 --> 01:08:46,643
You have spilled
the blood of the innocent.

1304
01:08:46,888 --> 01:08:49,641
Now begins 2 million
years of darkness.

1305
01:08:49,848 --> 01:08:52,078
Good job, Ms. Broflovski.
Thanks a lot.

1306
01:08:52,288 --> 01:08:55,439
l was trying to make the world
a better place for children.

1307
01:08:55,648 --> 01:08:58,879
And you brought enough intolerance
to allow my coming.

1308
01:08:59,088 --> 01:09:01,807
Now, everyone bow down to me!

1309
01:09:04,768 --> 01:09:05,837
Bend over!

1310
01:09:06,048 --> 01:09:07,606
What have we done?

1311
01:09:08,048 --> 01:09:10,687
Saddam, l'm the dark ruler, not you.

1312
01:09:10,888 --> 01:09:12,401
Relax.
Better seen, not heard.

1313
01:09:14,008 --> 01:09:15,043
l can't.

1314
01:09:15,288 --> 01:09:17,483
Let's start by building
a big statue of me!

1315
01:09:17,728 --> 01:09:19,684
There, where that fat kid is standing.

1316
01:09:19,928 --> 01:09:22,123
Don't call me fat, buttfucker!

1317
01:09:27,968 --> 01:09:29,526
Yeah, Cartman, do it.

1318
01:09:29,768 --> 01:09:32,441
Damn! Shit!
Respect my fucking authority!

1319
01:09:35,248 --> 01:09:37,398
You need to watch your mouth, brat!

1320
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:40,004
Dogshit taco!

1321
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:45,561
Quick, do something.

1322
01:09:45,808 --> 01:09:46,923
Try this on for size.

1323
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:51,086
Blood-drenched,
frozen tampon popsicle!

1324
01:09:53,288 --> 01:09:57,725
Buddy, l know l was mean before.
But don't worry, l can change.

1325
01:10:01,728 --> 01:10:02,717
Not!

1326
01:10:03,888 --> 01:10:05,924
Fuck, shit, cock, ass,
titties, boner. . .

1327
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:10,081
. . .bitch, muff, pussy, cunt,
butthole, Barbra Streisand!

1328
01:10:15,408 --> 01:10:17,842
What are you waiting for, bitch?
Destroy him!

1329
01:10:18,648 --> 01:10:20,639
You weak, stupid cum bucket.
Save me!

1330
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:21,877
That's it!

1331
01:10:22,768 --> 01:10:25,601
l have had enough of you!

1332
01:10:38,648 --> 01:10:42,880
He spent so much time convincing me
l was weak and stupid. . .

1333
01:10:43,088 --> 01:10:44,601
. . .that l believed it myself.

1334
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:46,646
l have you to thank, little one.

1335
01:10:47,168 --> 01:10:49,557
You showed me that l had
to get away from him.

1336
01:10:49,808 --> 01:10:52,686
Just make any wish you want
and l shall grant it.

1337
01:10:55,728 --> 01:10:57,559
-Are you sure?
-What did he say?

1338
01:10:57,808 --> 01:11:01,801
His wish is for everything to go back
to the way it was before this war.

1339
01:11:02,168 --> 01:11:05,240
Kenny, you realize that means
you'd go back too.

1340
01:11:05,488 --> 01:11:06,523
l know.

1341
01:11:14,648 --> 01:11:15,683
Very well, then.

1342
01:11:15,928 --> 01:11:17,600
l will pull my minions back.

1343
01:11:17,848 --> 01:11:21,523
l guess l'm destined
to live in hell alone.

1344
01:11:22,608 --> 01:11:23,404
Hello.

1345
01:11:23,608 --> 01:11:24,836
What's this?

1346
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:26,447
Hi, there, little guy.

1347
01:11:27,368 --> 01:11:29,438
Would you like to go to hell with me?

1348
01:11:29,688 --> 01:11:33,283
Sure. l bet we can be
best friends, Mr. Satan.

1349
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:35,917
Feel free to come back
and visit anytime.

1350
01:11:36,168 --> 01:11:38,045
l just might do that.

1351
01:11:38,288 --> 01:11:38,959
Thanks, Kenny.

1352
01:11:39,168 --> 01:11:42,001
Thanks for going back to hell for us.
You're a pal.

1353

Goodbye, you guys.

1355
01:12:01,968 --> 01:12:05,927
Wow. We were all dying
and now we're fine. That's super!

1356
01:12:06,168 --> 01:12:07,647
What the fuck's going on?

1357
01:12:11,848 --> 01:12:15,727
See, Mom? lt was Cartman's filthy
fucking mouth that saved us all.

1358
01:12:15,968 --> 01:12:18,880
l'm sorry l didn't pay attention
to you, Kyle.

1359
01:12:21,248 --> 01:12:22,567
But what about Gregory?

1360
01:12:22,808 --> 01:12:24,958
-l never cared for Gregory.
-You didn't?

1361
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,676
No, dude. Fuck Gregory!
Fuck him right in the ear!

1362
01:12:28,448 --> 01:12:29,483
Thank you, clitoris.

1363
01:12:29,728 --> 01:12:32,800
Everything worked out
What a happy end

1364
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:36,797
Americans and Canadians
Are friends again

1365
01:12:37,248 --> 01:12:40,877
So let's alljoin hands
And knock oppression down

Are now complete?
