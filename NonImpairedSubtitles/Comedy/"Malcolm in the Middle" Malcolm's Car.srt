1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,726
Look tickle monster!
He's going to get you.

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,269
Honey, you can stop looking for the car keys.

6
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:02,141
- You are going to be so proud of me.
- Why?

7
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:06,564
I spent the last five nights in a chat room
reeling in this creep named Heinrich.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,643
I got his address and showed up at his
house with a printed transcript of our conversations.

9
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:14,825
He calls me "Sugarbuns" 15 times on nine separate occasions.

10
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:15,581
Reese...

11
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:19,704
So the guy starts crying,
"What about my wife? What about my kids? I'll do anything."

12
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:21,502
Entrapment.

13
00:01:21,853 --> 00:01:23,377
It's not just for police anymore.

14
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:26,012
- Why do I care about this?
- The guy works at the racetrack.

15
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:28,771
He's going to make bets for us on the horses we pick.

16
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:30,751
Well, the horses you pick.

17
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:32,680
This is tomorrow's racing form.

18
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:38,170
You'll pick the winners and I'll place the bets,
we split the winnings 50-50, like brothers.

19
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:40,961
- That's kind of nice.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:45,903
I got to keep this guy on his toes. Time to leave a
suspicious message on his answering machine.

21
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:51,222
Wow, blackmailing a pervert to facilitate underage gambling.

22
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:52,803
How could this not work out?

23
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:58,303
It did work out. It's been four days and
Reese and I have already won almost $300.

24
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:02,000
I can't believe it. Reese's plans usually end up
with a missing toe or something.

25
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:04,552
Since when... do you...

26
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:05,702
buy lunch?

27
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:09,362
Oh, well, I've been making some extra money at work.

28
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:14,000
There's an incentive program at work,
we're given bonuses for finding

29
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:17,103
inefficiencism, it's really improve morale at the store.

30
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:20,163
You know, I actually enjoy going
to work now that everybody is...

31
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,600
Whoa! Jeez, are you okay?

32
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,273
Trying to finish...

33
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:25,843
what God started?

34
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:28,123
I'm sorry, I didn't see the curb. I was distracted by that...

35
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:39,193
Do you believe this?

36
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:40,662
What happened?

37
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:45,000
I was half way through my haircut when Troy
casually mentioned that his price had gone up

38
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:49,100
from $21 to $28. And he thought
I would just sit there and take it.

39
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:52,543
Well, I showed him, Hal.
I got up and I walked right out of there.

40
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:54,492
This is extortion, pure and simple.

41
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,253
What are you going to do about...?

42
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,902
- Here, even it up.
- What?

43
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:02,972
- I can't walk around like this. Cut it.
- No, I couldn't.

44
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:06,100
Hal, it doesn't have to look good.
Just hack this side off. Even it up.

45
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:18,293
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, Hal.
You've never done this before?

46
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:20,930
No, I guess I just have a knack for it.

47
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,961
Lois, I didn't think it was possible,
but you are even more stunning than ever.

48
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:27,723
Oh, Hal.

49
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:44,883
- What in the...?
- This is my new car. I bought it.

50
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:48,001
Now, I know what you're thinking,
but please just give me 45 seconds to explain

51
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,371
why this is the perfect car for me
and how it was such and insanely great deal

52
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,000
that I had no choice but to buy it.

53
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:55,601
Hey, there's some black gooey stuff leaking out of it.

54
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:58,202
I know it looks fast and dangerous, but that's a good thing.

55
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:02,003
Cops will have their eye on my car,
so I'll be extra motivated to drive safe and slow.

56
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:05,053
It didn't cost much, so I'll have
enough to pay for the first year's insurance.

57
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:08,200
Think of all the money you'll save from
less wear and tear on your car,

58
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:10,903
- since I won't have to drive it anymore.
- I can put my finger through the metal.

59
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:12,251
Dewey, get out of there!

60
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:15,140
I'll be able to work extra shifts since
I won't have to ride in with you,

61
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:16,900
which means I'll be bringing more money into the house.

62
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:18,400
Oh, and I love it.

63
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:21,201
I know you don't care, but it just needed to be said.

64
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:25,833
Malcolm, the fact that you even want this so bad
should have been your first clue that this is...

65
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:28,191
- Lois.
- Hal, he's not...

66
00:04:28,195 --> 00:04:33,002
Look, every boy has to go through this.
It's the only way they find out what's important in a car.

67
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:36,842
Look, let's go. I need to feather your neckline a little bit.

68
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:43,303
Where were you? We were supposed to meet
Heinrich right after lunch to get our bets in.

69
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:47,133
Today was totally wasted.
Although he did buy me a swimsuit.

70
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:51,341
I got a car, Reese. I finally have a car.
It's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

71
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:52,550
It's a piece of crap.

72
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:57,701
Don't listen to him. You're magnificent.

73
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:04,821
Lois, your hair looks beautiful.

74
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:06,880
She's right, Lois. It's fantastic.

75
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:09,102
Thank you. I've been getting compliments all day.

76
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:10,222
It looks so much better.

77
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:13,150
Yeah, I thought you were trapped
in the '70s with that old cut.

78
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:15,350
And your head doesn't look so boxy anymore.

79
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:23,253
Lois? What did you do to your hair?
I love it. Fred, isn't it fantastic?

80
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:23,821
Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,173
- Who's your stylist?
- My husband did it.

82
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:28,850
- Really? Where's his shop?
- He doesn't have one.

83
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:32,503
I just got the scissors out of the drawer and,
I don't know, he just got inspired.

84
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:33,770
Amazing.

85
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:37,601
Okay, ladies, we're agreed. Lois looks beautiful.
Now, let's get back to work.

86
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:39,250
I  got a job to do, too, honey.

87
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:41,351
Good evening, Fred.

88
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:46,000
There goes the soul of this store.

89
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,631
- And it keeps your nose from taking over your face.
- Yeah, thanks.

90
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:52,300
- So I'll see you tonight?
- I wouldn't miss it.

91
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:57,880
Lois, you've got to help me.

92
00:05:57,908 --> 00:05:58,303
What?

93
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:01,742
- I need you to cover the rest of my shift for me.
- Again? Craig, what's going on?

94
00:06:02,106 --> 00:06:04,450
Paula wants to surprise Fred for their anniversary.

95
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:07,882
He's a big golfer, so she wants to learn how,
so I've been giving her lessons.

96
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:08,951
You don't know how to golf.

97
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:13,551
True, but somehow she got the idea that
I only missed the cut at the Masters by three strokes.

98
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,880
- You lied to her?
- Lois, my job here is hanging by a thread.

99
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:21,080
I thought if I could help the boss's wife
surprise him with a game of golf,

100
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:26,192
they'd end up kissing on the 18th green,
and maybe I'd be in there somewhere getting the credit for it.

101
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:29,200
Or you could just work hard at your job
and then you wouldn't have to suck up.

102
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:32,431
Lois, I don't have time for your fantasies.
I'm in trouble here.

103
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:36,913
The first few lessons we worked on driving the cart,
but now she wants to know how to swing a club.

104
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:40,123
I need to take a lesson so I can
bluff my way through her lessons.

105
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,003
- Craig...
- Please, Lois.

106
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:45,811
I can't lose this job.
This is the only true thing on my resume.

107
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:47,852
All right, but I'm only...

108
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:48,490
< i>Feldspar!</i>

109
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:52,752
I want all those 50-pound bags of dog food out
on the floor before I get back from the warehouse.

110
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:53,610
I'm on it.

111
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,413
Thanks, Lois.

112
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:02,302
Sorry I'm late, Hal.
The grocery store was...

113
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:03,701
Hi, Lois.

114
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:07,001
- Hal, what are you doing?
- Just giving Margie a new look.

115
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:11,101
- I had to have him do me. Your husband's a genius.
- And I get to keep the hair.

116
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:16,850
Now where was I? Oh, my sister. Honestly, a beach
condo on her salary. Who is she trying to impress?

117
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:19,302
She's just so insecure, she always has been.

118
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,602
Every year she sends a Christmas card with a
picture of her family sitting on a sailboat.

119
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,541
It's not even theirs.

120
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:27,361
Uh, Lois. Do you have to do the grocery thing in here?

121
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:29,621
<i>So...</i>

122
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:33,582
They rent that boat from their horrible neighbors who,
P.S., don't even know how to sail.

123
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:45,603
What is your problem, you stupid car?
You're driving me nuts.

124
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,400
Where...  were you?

125
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:51,920
Oh, Stevie, good. Here, take this.
If it turns over, yank it out.

126
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:55,400
I waited... at the library.

127
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:59,650
You should have seen her today. I was at a light
and these jerks pulled up next to mewanting to race.

128
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:01,851
I hit the gas and she just flew.

129
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,863
I totally blew the doors off for four seconds
before she dropped an oil pan.

130
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:08,653
That's it!

131
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:15,601
Malcolm, we did it. We won over $250 from...
from the good grades program at school.

132
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:18,853
Awesome. That'll pay for this.

133
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:23,800
Isn't it beautiful? This is for you.

134
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:32,302
I e-mailed... my chess move... days ago.

135
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:34,490
Stevie, I don't have to do everything with you.

136
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,902
Tell you what. I'll take you for a drive. That'll...

137
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:51,523
What is your problem, you stupid car?!
You're driving me nuts!

138
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,762
So I'm thinking, I feel young,
so why not look young?

139
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:06,861
<i>So I got the Botox done to crow's feet and my forehead,
then I had my chin done and my tummy tucked.</i>

140
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:08,933
- <i>And I may notstop there.</i>
- Work it, girlfriend.

141
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:10,403
Oh, hi, Lois.

142
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:13,350
Can I talk to you for a minute?

143
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:15,842
Does your grandmother know you borrowed her hands?

144
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:19,664
I went to six different stores and could not
find that avocado oil you recommended.

145
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,282
Hal, this isn't working for me.

146
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:26,357
Well, that's because you don't
scrunch and sprits like I told you to.

147
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,823
No, this. Look. Craig is flaking out on me.

148
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:33,002
I'm pulling double shifts for him and every
time I come home, it's full of people.

149
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,700
I never have any time alone.
There is hair everywhere.

150
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:38,701
And I do not like the way you are standing lately.

151
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:44,501
Lois, these women are walking out
of here with a glow. It's wonderful.

152
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:47,780
Well, can't you at least some of
the money you're making to hire a cleaning lady?

153
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:51,321
- I'm not accepting money for this !
- What?!

154
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:56,710
I am transforming these women, Lois.
I won't soil that with money. And it's not just the hair.

155
00:09:57,107 --> 00:10:00,001
They confide in me, they need
someone to listen to their problems.

156
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:02,151
You wouldn't believe what some
of these women are going through.

157
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:06,021
Nancy, she's getting audited.
Margie's husband has a gambling problem,

158
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:08,611
and Paula in there, she is having an affair.

159
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:09,851
What?!

160
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:13,801
Yes, for the last five months. It's some guy
she's pretending to take golf lessons with.

161
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:21,541
Why do you keep doing this to me?

162
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:27,961
I fix your throttle leakage and your alternator dies.

163
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:30,922
I buy you a new alternator and your water pump explodes.

164
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:34,600
Every time I think I'm getting close, you find a new way to hurt me.

165
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:37,282
Hey, thanks for placing that bet today.

166
00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:40,201
I tried to get out of detention, but none of the fire alarms were working.

167
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:41,592
Where's the money?

168
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:42,892
I never made the bet.

169
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:43,841
What?

170
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:46,140
I didn't make the bet. I spent the money on something else.

171
00:10:46,627 --> 00:10:47,963
A car bra!

172
00:10:49,645 --> 00:10:50,161
What?

173
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:52,021
You had $200.

174
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:54,090
That horse came in at five to two.

175
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:56,520
I don't know what that is,
but I'm supposed to get half of it.

176
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:58,711
Sorry, man. But look how hot she looks.

177
00:10:59,347 --> 00:11:03,923
- Malcolm, you got to calm down. This car is messing you up.
- This car is not messing me up.

178
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:06,240
It's made me happier than I've ever been in my life.

179
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,771
Oh, Lois, thank God.

180
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:20,393
Fred asked me to scrub out the Dumpsters tonight, but Paula wants to work
on her short iron, so I had to schedule &an emergency lesson with the golf pro.

181
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:26,713
The guy charges, like, 90 bucks an hour. It's really eating away
at my savings, but I guess I have no one to blame but myself,
and, oh, my God, you know about the affair.

182
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:28,783
Damn it! Damn it!

183
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:30,922
- You do know, right?
- Yes, I know.

184
00:11:31,368 --> 00:11:32,032
Damn it!

185
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:35,311
Craig, how could you lie to me after all I've done for you?

186
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:39,350
I let you sleep on our floor when you though
your cat's ghost was trying to kill you.

187
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,572
- I settled that feud between you and the Girl Scout troop.
- They started it.

188
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:43,400
Shut up!

189
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:49,843
I do all this and you repay me by making me drag around
50-pound sacks of dog food so you can sleep with the boss's wife?

190
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:53,562
- That's inexcusable!
- I didn't plan this. It just happened.

191
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,721
One night after inventory, we stopped in the parking lot to talk.

192
00:11:56,845 --> 00:12:03,062
I bent down to pick up her keys, the next thing I know,
she's got me handcuffed in a shower in a motel out by the airport.

193
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:04,631
She's crazy, Lois.

194
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:06,780
But she makes me crazy, too.

195
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:07,421
Craig...

196
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:11,840
I'm not kidding. There is a dark, scary place inside
of me that I didn't even know was there,

197
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:18,831
but Paula knew it was there, and every night she takes me to that
scary place and shows me some new, terrible, delicious corner of it.

198
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:23,623
- You're not going to rat on me, are you?
- No, but you have to end this today.

199
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:26,780
I can't, Lois. I'm addicted.
I don't even know who I am anymore!

200
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:29,763
I know I've let you down,

201
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,792
but I want to thank you for helping me anyway.

202
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:37,042
- Craig, I never said I...
- If that homeless guy is still in the Dumpster, just
let him drink from the hose. He'll leave you alone.

203
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:44,292
Stupid car. That's four coats.
Now will you run?!

204
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:47,502
- Malcolm, your leopard-skin seat covers are here.
- Sweet.

205
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:49,291
I can't wait to see you in them.

206
00:12:54,318 --> 00:12:55,582
What's going on?

207
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:57,711
Malcolm, this is Mike.

208
00:12:58,046 --> 00:12:59,130
He's from AAA.

209
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:02,292
You're in a safe place with people who care about you.

210
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:03,523
Sit down, son.

211
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,123
What's all this about?

212
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:11,042
Stevie and Reese have something
to say and I think you should listen.

213
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:16,232
You've abandoned... your friends.

214
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:22,042
You didn't even notice my new... deck shoes.

215
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:25,270
- Stevie, I've just been busy, okay?
- Your car is ruining everything.

216
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:27,862
It's even affecting our illegal gambling.

217
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:29,542
I tried to pick a winner myself,

218
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:33,443
but since I'm an idiot,
I picked one that came in at over 600 to one.

219
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:38,782
I won $11,500 that I can't even touch
because I'd have to fill out a tax form!

220
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:43,473
$11,500 that's just sitting there
tormenting me because of that stupid car!

221
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:44,892
Stop calling it stupid!

222
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:48,241
That car isn't stupid.
That car is great.

223
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,312
It's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

224
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:54,473
- Really? Where'd you get that shiner?
- That was my fault. I wasn't being careful enough.

225
00:13:55,215 --> 00:13:58,331
Malcolm, we're here to help,

226
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:01,543
but the first step is for you to admit that you have a problem.

227
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:04,282
I did. That's why I'm in AAA.

228
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,192
There's thousands of us, Malcolm, and
we all know what you're going through.

229
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:16,380
I guess I didn't realizehow bad things had gotten.

230
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:20,923
I think I need to take a good long look at every...

231
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:30,562
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's it.

232
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:37,642
I didn't get... to read...

233
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:39,721
my poem.

234
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:45,672
And when Martha left the room,
Tina checked the price tag on the leather coat...

235
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:47,551
factory outlet.

236
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:49,983
Temperature good for you?

237
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:54,830
Perfect. As was the scalp massage.

238
00:14:55,715 --> 00:15:01,611
So all you have to do is cash in the ticket for me,
give me the $11,000, and you can keep $500.

239
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:03,450
- Deal.
- Thanks, man.

240
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:06,653
Well, I think it's important you have an adult you can trust.

241
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:12,173
This car is a tease.

242
00:15:12,448 --> 00:15:14,523
Yesterday, she gave me the ride of my life.

243
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:17,400
Her bra flew off before I even hit the freeway.

244
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:18,773
I was so happy!

245
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:22,981
And today, she won't even start.

246
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:24,732
It's like yesterday didn't even happen.

247
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:26,303
I can't take this anymore!

248
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:28,672
Please start!

249
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:33,323
Please, I'm begging you!
Just give me a little something, please?!

250
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:38,673
Oh, thank you so much!
I knew you'd come back.

251
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:40,923
We're meant to be together.
Don't you see?

252
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:19,051
Help! Somebody help me!

253
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,163
I'm stuck!

254
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,071
Help!

255
00:16:22,808 --> 00:16:26,510
There's a bit of a wait. We got slammed
with a wedding party and we're way behind.

256
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:34,430
Huh, The Human Volcano.
One of my favorites.

257
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:38,412
- Oh, it's so much better now that he can read minds.
- Exactly.

258
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:41,463
He used to just have heat grip.
How lame was that?

259
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:47,350
- You allergic to nuts?
- No.

260
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:49,772
All right.

261
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:55,783
What are you studying in school?

262
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:58,093
Regular stuff, I guess.

263
00:16:58,215 --> 00:16:59,483
I  don't really like school.

264
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,100
Everybody makes fun of me.

265
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:04,272
Yeah, I remember those days.
Kids can be so cruel.

266
00:17:04,986 --> 00:17:08,531
The smart kids, the loners, they were the meanest.

267
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:12,962
The worst is gym class.
My own team throws the ball at me in dodgeball.

268
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:17,993
Hey, you know how you can get out of gym?
Pretend to have asthma.

269
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:20,730
All you need is a fake inhaler.
Here, take mine.

270
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:22,923
It also gets me good seats on the bus.

271
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:23,780
Don't worry.

272
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:26,611
Things are going to be better for you from here on out.

273
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:28,282
My dad tells me the same thing.

274
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:30,020
Well, your dad's a smart man.

275
00:17:30,705 --> 00:17:32,430
Frank, your new haircut looks great.

276
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,892
Let me just get my purse and I'll drive
you back home to your parents.

277
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:37,822
Craig, you know Frank's parents, Fred and Paula.

278
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,691
Remember, Fred is our boss at Lucky Aide?

279
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:43,152
<i>And I believe you're giving golf lessons to his mom.</i>

280
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:44,910
Let's go, Frank.

281
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:48,200
And I promise I'll drive very safely
so we don't have an accident.

282
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,863
I wouldn't want to ruin your life
with my carelessness.

283
00:17:57,907 --> 00:17:59,092
I'm not going to make it.

284
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:02,391
Stevie was right about this car.

285
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:06,582
And so was Reese.

286
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:09,012
He was right about the car,

287
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:10,921
and the horse racing.

288
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:16,402
That makes it easier.

289
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:17,731
I don't...

290
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:20,102
want to live in a world...

291
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:23,393
where Reese is right.

292
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:32,361
You  really have to snap those sheets
if you want to get the hair off.

293
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:36,032
- Come on. Throw your fanny into it.
- Dad, seriously, you got to stop talking like that.

294
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:37,631
Oh, I'm sorry.

295
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:41,542
It's just so draining listening to all these
people with their tawdry little secrets.

296
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,300
Like that Paula woman, Fred's wife?

297
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:49,123
Not only is she cheating on her husband, now she's two-timing
on her golf instructor with her swing-dance teacher.

298
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:54,422
She is learning new moves every night if you
know what I'm talking about. She is so cold.

299
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:59,091
- Hey!
- Stevie, please, we're talking.

300
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:04,020
<i>And Sheila's husband Randy just got a new assistant.
She's 19 years old and she doesn't even know how to type.</i>

301
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:06,703
<i>The girl wears a halter top to the office.</i>

302
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:07,931
Halter tops?

303
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:11,391
Hello? Dukes of Hazzard on line three.
They want their costumes back.

304
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:20,200
Malcolm? Malcolm, are you all right?

305
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:21,593
What happened?

306
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:24,201
It's okay. It's okay, son. You'll be fine.
Just breathe deep.

307
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,532
Stevie...

308
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:30,213
you saved my life.

309
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:33,600
I treated you like dirt. You saved my life.

310
00:19:36,598 --> 00:19:38,442
Your wheel's kinda on my crotch.

311
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:40,350
Is it?

312
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:45,223
I can get off early, can't you just cancel your lesson?

313
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:48,830
I wish I could, but we're working
on the Texas Two-Step tonight.

314
00:19:48,898 --> 00:19:50,672
We never see each other anymore.

315
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,793
Lois, I see you more than
I see my wife these days.

316
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:56,530
Oh, Fred, things have a way
of changing for the better.

317
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:57,453
You'll see.

318
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:59,951
<i>Attention, Lucky Aide shoppers:</i>

319
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:03,832
<i>My name is Craig Feldspar and
I have a message for Paula Lynch.</i>

320
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:06,483
<i>Paula, I can't go on like this.</i>

321
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:08,673
<i>I'm going to do the right thing,</i>

322
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,733
<i>and make you my wife.</i>

323
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:17,010
<i>I just bought an $11,500 engagement
ring which I hope you'll accept.</i>

324
00:20:18,777 --> 00:20:22,032
You're cheating on me with Craig Feldspar?!

325
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,301
I think we're both victims here, Fred.

326
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:28,660
I'm going to go...

327
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:30,983
something that way.

328
00:20:31,757 --> 00:20:35,632
<i>Sure, it won't be easy for us, but the
path of true love never did run smooth.</i>

329
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:38,541
<i>We'll move in with my grandmother
and care for her together.</i>

330
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:43,363
Well, they're about to tow her away.
You want to come say good-bye?

331
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:44,073
No.

332
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:46,782
I know it's tough, son.

333
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:48,871
I thought I'd never get over my first car.

334
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:52,943
'64 Plymouth Fury who couldn't keep her top on.

335
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:56,050
Then some guy stole her from me.

336
00:20:56,456 --> 00:21:00,402
I saw her a few months later with a new
driver and a different paint job, but,

337
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:02,391
she  meant nothing to me.

338
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:03,973
I had moved on.

339
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:05,131
And so will you.

340
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:08,473
Are you cutting my hair?

341
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:09,460
No.
