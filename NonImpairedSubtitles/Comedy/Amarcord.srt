1
00:01:53,642 --> 00:02:01,484
"I REMEMBER"

2
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:09,575
The puffballs!

3
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,539
When the puffballs come,
cold winter's almost gone.

4
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:25,800
When the puffballs soar,
then winter's no more.

5
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:30,179
I've got the best one!

6
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:33,057
Ciccio, let's go to the seashore.

7
00:02:49,532 --> 00:02:53,744
In our town, the puffballs
and spring arrive together.

8
00:02:55,996 --> 00:03:01,836
These are puffballs that are
drifting around.

9
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:06,340
Soaring over the cemetery,
where all rest in peace...

10
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:11,637
Soaring over the beach-front
and over the Germans, just arrived,

11
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:14,640
who don't feel the cold...

12
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:17,226
Drifting, drifting...

13
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:19,186
Swirling...

14
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:21,939
Swirling... swirling...

15
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,609
Drifting, drifting, drifting!

16
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:30,197
I'm the last of fourteen children

17
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:34,160
by then my father had had enough,
so he called me "Definitivo. "

18
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:38,372
Had he had enough sooner, there'd
have been one less chatterer.

19
00:03:38,873 --> 00:03:39,999
Good evening.

20
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,834
See you in the square.

21
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:49,717
I've come for my sister. Is it
too early? -Your sister's here!

22
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:52,470
Fiorella, I've finished, come in!

23
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:56,265
I better calm you down,
you horny beast. What a body!

24
00:03:56,432 --> 00:04:00,394
The bonfire's bigger this year
than it was last year.

25
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:04,356
Going to the bonfire tonight?
What're you playing?

26
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:06,525
I've composed a brand new tune.

27
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:09,278
Listen to this.

28
00:04:26,587 --> 00:04:30,216
Now, Dad, we'll watch them
light the bonfire, then off to bed.

29
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:33,010
The doctor says you must
go to bed early.

30
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:36,097
The doctor's an asshole.
I'll go to bed when I please!

31
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:39,100
You'll end up in the hospital,
and this time I'll leave you there.

32
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:44,021
Blockheads! Numbskulls!

33
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:53,280
Let me through! That's my place!

34
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,578
You creeps!

35
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:02,748
Let me through!
Listen to this one!

36
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,294
A father can take care of
100 kids, but 100 kids

37
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:09,630
can't take care of one father.
That's the gospel truth.

38
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:12,716
I want to set off a firecracker.
- You stay here.

39
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:17,096
Hey, Giudizio, catch!

40
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:24,437
I can, I order and I want!
Viva Giudizio!

41
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:31,277
Volpina, have you made love today?

42
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:34,822
How many men did you service?

43
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:40,369
I bet you even dip a cock
in your morning coffee!

44
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:43,789
Here she is!

45
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,127
You're the greatest, Gradisca.
Greta Garbo's got nothing on you!

46
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,924
Let's go over there.

47
00:05:57,845 --> 00:06:00,139
Ronald Coleman, we're over here!

48
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:04,643
Giudizio, take this chair too.

49
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,646
Burn this one too!
Put it on top.

50
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:10,566
Sit the old witch in it.

51
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,570
I'll stuff that chair down
your throat! Take it home.

52
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,998
The old witch!

53
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,668
The old witch is here.

54
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:32,296
Let me wed her before you burn her!

55
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:40,846
What're you looking at?
- I wasn't looking.

56
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:42,681
Keep still!

57
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:49,438
Don't look, otherwise
you'll get too excited!

58
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:06,038
Bring the firecrackers!

59
00:07:06,205 --> 00:07:08,958
Let's light the bonfire
and burn the old witch.

60
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:34,734
Burn away, oh witch so old.
Burn the winter and the cold.

61
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:39,196
Here's spring!

62
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:42,283
I don't have a match.
- But your beloved has.

63
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:54,920
Viva the old witch!
Viva Giudizio!

64
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:59,508
I can, I order and I want!

65
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:09,935
Where's the ladder?

66
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:14,648
Want it? Take it!

67
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:19,779
Want it? Take it!

68
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:21,906
Hurry, I'm burning!

69
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:30,790
In America, I saw bonfires
106 meters high.

70
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:34,168
When were you there?
- My parents are American.

71
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:38,339
I'll break your neck!

72
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,674
You should hear what my father
can do with his ass!

73
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,177
Hurrah for spring!

74
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,476
It gives me a funny feeling.
Does it you?

75
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:54,146
Yes, but it's winter that's
dying and spring is now here!

76
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:57,149
I can feel spring
all over me already!

77
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,902
Our respects to you, milord.
Our respects to you, ma'am.

78
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:44,071
Our respects to you,
little countess.

79
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:54,582
Drink a little, it'll do you good!
Even your aunt's drinking, look!

80
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,402
Good old Lallo!
No one would know you're sixty.

81
00:10:24,153 --> 00:10:28,741
Just take a look!
Your brother really is an asshole!

82
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:30,159
He's only a youngster!

83
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:37,500
Now see the Malayan tiger leap!

84
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:42,671
Be careful!
You'll catch it when we get home.

85
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:46,133
The heel's come off.
He'll just have to do without one!

86
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,344
Where's that other
useless ass gone?

87
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:54,225
Ciccio, throw the big bang
on the fire!

88
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:58,312
Off to bed with you! I'll put you
all in boarding school!

89
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,863
Here's Scureza di Corpolò,
"The Fart. " Go to it, Scureza!

90
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:12,993
Scureza di Corpolò!
Bravo!

91
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:37,184
The origins of this town are lost
in the mists of time.

92
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:41,564
In the Municipal Museum,
there are stone implements...

93
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:43,858
All the best.
- My respects.

94
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:46,944
...that date back to
prehistoric times.

95
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:50,030
I myself have found some graffiti
of great age

96
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:52,533
on the walls of caves
in Count Lovignano's estate.

97
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,038
Be that as it may, the first
certain date is 268 B.C.

98
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:02,460
when this became a Roman colony
and the start of the Emilian Way.

99
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:04,170
Mr. Lawyer!

100
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:13,095
This, too, is characteristic
of the spirit of these people

101
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:16,557
who have Roman and Celtic blood
in their veins.

102
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:20,269
Theirs is an exuberant, generous,
tenacious nature.

103
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:29,236
Dante, Pascoli, D'Annunzio and
many others have lauded this land

104
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:33,365
while innumerable are its sons
who have contributed greatly

105
00:12:33,574 --> 00:12:36,744
to the arts, science, religion
and politics.

106
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,249
Who are you? Trying to be clever,

107
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,543
but too gutless to show yourself.

108
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,175
Come out and show yourself! I'll
explain everything face to face.

109
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:05,272
Mr. Lawyer!
- Sure... sure.

110
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:13,280
Shut up, you delinquents!

111
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,921
Shall we all take our places?
- If you insist, headmaster...

112
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:31,590
But I never come out well
in photographs.

113
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,970
You boys at the back...
get on the bench!

114
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:43,644
Now what, De Santis?
- It wasn't me, sir!

115
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:45,521
Aldina!

116
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:08,586
Doesn't it look like you?

117
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:14,216
What's happening?
- Gigliozzi! Be seated!

118
00:14:18,262 --> 00:14:23,184
Put it down her neck.
Hold it like that, please.

119
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:27,396
What is this?
- A stone.

120
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:31,192
Yes, but what is it?
- I know, it's for a slingshot.

121
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:33,444
Is it an elephant's testicle?

122
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:36,155
It is a pendulum.

123
00:14:36,655 --> 00:14:40,159
You certainly all know
a pendulum clock.

124
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:43,204
And how does it go?
tick... tock...

125
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:59,386
Where did Tiberius retire to when
he gave up leadership of the Empire?

126
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:01,180
To Capri.

127
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:13,359
When was Agrippina killed?
-69 A.D.

128
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:18,406
Why have you given me a zero?
Wasn't it 69?

129
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:24,870
It was 59 A.D.!
- Are you sure?

130
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:28,249
What do you mean, sure!
It was 59 A.D.!

131
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,626
Oh, damn it! I knew it was!

132
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:33,421
You'll drive me crazy!
Get back to your seat!

133
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:35,965
What have I done?
Why couldn't it have been 69?

134
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:45,683
There will come the day
when a renewed Italy

135
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,769
will take to the field of battle
on her own behalf

136
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:52,440
and not be defending her soil
for others, with their weapons.

137
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:56,485
Universal, being Spirit
incarnate in the State

138
00:15:56,652 --> 00:16:00,030
and cannot but enter into
the true nature of the Church.

139
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:03,951
This reconciliation between State
and Church occurred through

140
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:08,706
a Demiurge which brought order
to members of State and Church

141
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:13,627
demanding iron discipline
and the right to intervene

142
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:15,755
in all aspects of individual life.

143
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:19,258
He is God's chosen Son

144
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,844
because he has the same power
as the Father.

145
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:26,557
Then there is the Holy Spirit
to be placed on the same level

146
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:29,268
as the Father and the Son.
Is that clear?

147
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:32,938
This is why God is one
and also a Trinity.

148
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:39,695
I'll speak about the great Giotto...
- Whose balls exploded like this!

149
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:43,032
Do you know, boys and girls

150
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,494
why Giotto is important
in Italian painting?

151
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:53,042
I will tell you.
Because he invented perspective.

152
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,005
Remember, per-spec-tive!

153
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:04,471
Miss, can I leave the room?
Bobo's let a real stinker!

154
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:06,473
What do you mean?

155
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:13,939
You're nuts! It's not true,
I never fart! -You do! You do!

156
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:17,192
Alboin...

157
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,907
signed the peace.
Gigliozzi! Outside!

158
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:26,993
Now, this is not difficult.
Solve it.

159
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:42,884
Why have you stopped?
You were doing fine.

160
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:44,928
What did you want to do?

161
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:48,598
Give me a clue.
- Pass it to me.

162
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:53,979
Just think a moment.
X9 plus the square root of K3.

163
00:17:56,064 --> 00:17:57,607
It's so obvious!

164
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:02,696
Move over. What have you done here?

165
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,617
We'll go through it together.
What is written here?

166
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:12,706
What is written here, I say?
You must know how to read!

167
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:15,751
But I...
- Keep quiet!

168
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,304
X9 plus the square root of K3...

169
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:31,892
Here's the solution.

170
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:35,604
X1 = 140...

171
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:39,524
X2 = 3/5ths of the total,
less the difference.

172
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:41,109
Is that clear?

173
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:48,158
What have you done?
Are you crazy?

174
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:50,744
Janitor! Janitor!

175
00:19:06,718 --> 00:19:09,179
Greek is so beautiful, isn't it?
- You betcha!

176
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:11,807
Don't you think it is so musical?

177
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:16,394
Emarpszamen! Repeat after me.

178
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:23,110
Be quiet! Now try again.

179
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:26,405
Please, teacher,
could you be so kind...

180
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:29,491
Could I hear it again?

181
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:33,537
Certainly.
Look: Emar-pszamen.

182
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:36,915
Careful with the tongue...

183
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:40,627
it must go here,
against the palate...

184
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:43,130
then spit it out.

185
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:53,306
Silence!

186
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,194
Come on now.
Greek is so difficult.

187
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:07,988
How did you put your tongue?

188
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,076
Not that way, between your teeth.

189
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:15,954
Like this?
- Right!

190
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,672
Go back to your seat, damn it!
- I nearly got it, that time.

191
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:30,927
Who's that?
- It's Ciccio.

192
00:20:32,137 --> 00:20:36,266
Leave me the butt.
- Just one drag.

193
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,896
Is it true that Aldina's
ripped up your poem?

194
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:42,397
But, I've written another!

195
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:46,401
"What a kind, gentle maiden
art thou, Aldina.

196
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:51,782
"You set my heart beating
like a steam-hammer. "

197
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:58,121
It's pretty warm outside.
- I prefer Aldina's mother.

198
00:20:58,455 --> 00:21:00,540
Who'll be on the beach
this morning?

199
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:18,016
Fu-Manchu!

200
00:21:36,743 --> 00:21:39,371
Volpina! Come here!

201
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,213
What do you want here?

202
00:21:50,298 --> 00:21:52,092
I've lost my pussycat.

203
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:59,307
There's no cats here. Go home.

204
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:07,441
It's hot, isn't it?
Aren't you all hot?

205
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:12,195
What an odd girl you are.

206
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:15,949
Come on now, go home.
There's no cats here.

207
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:21,830
Boss, "Mortar" has written
another poem.

208
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:24,207
When do you manage to write
these poems?

209
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,544
"Mortar," let's hear this poem.

210
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:30,130
O.K., let's hear it.

211
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:35,510
What's its title?
- "Bricks. "

212
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:39,806
"My grandfather made bricks

213
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:42,267
"My father made bricks

214
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:46,229
"I make bricks too,
but where's my house?"

215
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:54,237
Bravo! I get your point!

216
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:58,116
It's quite right. But I, too,
was once a poor man

217
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:00,702
and I have gradually worked my way
up to master builder.

218
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:04,081
You can't get everything at once!

219
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:07,167
You have to be patient,
you have to work.

220
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:12,547
By working, one can. You must work.
- Aren't we working?

221
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:16,176
That's enough!

222
00:23:20,722 --> 00:23:22,224
No drinking before the soup!

223
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,186
Where have you read that?

224
00:23:26,353 --> 00:23:28,814
It blows up the stomach.
I read it in the Sunday paper.

225
00:23:29,481 --> 00:23:32,609
Keep your hands to yourself!
- There's a spoon missing.

226
00:23:33,652 --> 00:23:36,321
Is it hot, Lallino?
- A little.

227
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:41,868
I want a lot.
- You'll get your share.

228
00:23:43,703 --> 00:23:47,124
Would you like some more, Lallo?
There's some left, you know.

229
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:55,215
Is there enough salt?
- Yes, Grandpa.

230
00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:58,677
Give him a little.
- He's already eaten.

231
00:23:58,844 --> 00:24:02,264
My father's father was known
as "Big Meat. "

232
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:05,517
He lived to be 107
and he was still doing it!

233
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:14,401
And so?
- And so then...

234
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:19,823
When I was little, he taught me
you have to eat at 11 in the morning

235
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,119
before the sun burns your head,
and at 4 in the afternoon,

236
00:24:24,286 --> 00:24:28,790
otherwise food's like poison
that gets into your blood.

237
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,626
Aren't you eating?
- No!

238
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:36,339
What have you done to her?

239
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:38,759
Nothing!

240
00:24:39,468 --> 00:24:41,136
They've done nothing.

241
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:45,432
Bloody hell!
Get up at 4 in the morning...

242
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,100
Slave away all day like a mule.

243
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:52,439
Then come home to eat some bread
and see a bunch of long faces...

244
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:58,278
Well, now you'll see
no more of them!

245
00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:02,032
Ma'am, it's time to take
the boiler off.

246
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:08,080
What's the matter?
- Nothing!

247
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:10,874
Well, eat something, then.
- I don't want anything!

248
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,001
Why?
- Because I don't!

249
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:16,046
Shut the door, it's cold.

250
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:18,840
I'm still convalescent.

251
00:25:22,844 --> 00:25:24,971
Who can it be at this hour?
- How would I know!

252
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,808
Shall I see who it is?
- Yes, you go.

253
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:33,647
What do you think my bottom is?
Holy water?

254
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:36,525
Chicken always gets stuck
between my teeth.

255
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:39,319
Can I have some more, Dad?

256
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:43,490
A wing.
- Stop there! I'll give it to you!

257
00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:49,663
Have you put mint in it, Miranda?
- No, not mint! Sage!

258
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:53,792
But you realized there was
something different, didn't you?

259
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:55,961
Lallino has a good palate.

260
00:25:56,795 --> 00:25:58,922
Gina! Who is it?

261
00:26:04,553 --> 00:26:06,054
Mr. Biondi.

262
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:09,683
He's the bishop's cousin, isn't he?

263
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:13,895
What's all this?
Anyone'd think I never fed you!

264
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:17,190
Uncle, look!

265
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,152
If your dad sees you...!

266
00:26:20,902 --> 00:26:24,906
Uncle, do that trick for us.
Come on, just once.

267
00:26:26,742 --> 00:26:28,118
Look, Titta!

268
00:26:29,953 --> 00:26:31,788
Bravo!

269
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:35,500
It's difficult, isn't it?
- Well, you know...

270
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:51,057
Good wine, this Sangiovese.

271
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:55,604
Where were you last night?

272
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:59,316
At the cinema.
- What was on?

273
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:06,239
The Americans were trying to get
into Comanche territory

274
00:27:06,406 --> 00:27:09,284
and they'd built a bridge for
the railway, but the Indians

275
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:13,872
shot arrows at them from above.
It was a massacre, Dad!

276
00:27:14,164 --> 00:27:15,874
I'll massacre you,
you little criminal!

277
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:18,085
What's happened now?

278
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:19,586
I didn't do anything!

279
00:27:23,465 --> 00:27:24,549
I'll put you in the hospital
if I catch you!

280
00:27:24,716 --> 00:27:27,177
Aurelio, people are watching!

281
00:27:30,388 --> 00:27:34,434
Starting tomorrow, no more school,
no more allowance.

282
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:36,436
He can start working with me!

283
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:40,190
But will you pay me?
- With a hammer in the face!

284
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:43,902
You have to tell me
who fathered this piece of shit!

285
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:46,822
At his age, I'd been working
three years!

286
00:27:47,114 --> 00:27:49,741
Yeah, I know. And gave
all the money to Grandma!

287
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:52,327
That's enough now!
Let's all go and eat.

288
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:54,955
Good day to you.

289
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,877
Everyone in town laughs at us,
even the roosters.

290
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:07,342
In my own home, I'll do as I please!
- Listen to His Royal Highness!

291
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,972
Give me your brother's plate.

292
00:28:13,223 --> 00:28:15,976
Put that plate down.
- What has he done?

293
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:19,938
I'll show you what he's done.

294
00:28:20,105 --> 00:28:21,106
What has he done?

295
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:26,695
What has he done?
- I don't know.

296
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:32,159
This is Mr. Biondi's hat.
He was at the cinema last night.

297
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:34,202
Just smell it.
Know who did that?

298
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:37,539
That brat of a son of yours.

299
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:41,126
He pissed over the rail of the
balcony, right on Biondi's head.

300
00:28:41,293 --> 00:28:43,837
That cost me three bills!

301
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:46,631
I'm sure it was those juvenile
delinquents he hangs around with!

302
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,343
That's enough!
You've got to stop taking his side.

303
00:28:50,552 --> 00:28:53,096
He's getting worse and worse!

304
00:28:53,263 --> 00:28:56,725
They're a pair of little criminals!
You've educated them wrong!

305
00:28:56,892 --> 00:29:02,814
O.K., you do it!
Let's see how well you do!

306
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:08,987
I can't stand any more!
I'm going crazy! I'm going mad!

307
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:12,115
I'll kill the lot of you!

308
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:22,084
I'll put strychnine in your soup!
That's what I'll do!

309
00:29:27,547 --> 00:29:28,507
1... 2... 3...

310
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:38,016
But I'll kill myself first!
Right now!

311
00:29:39,393 --> 00:29:43,480
You'll see!
I'll kill myself first!

312
00:29:46,274 --> 00:29:47,734
Uncle, look at Dad!

313
00:29:56,868 --> 00:30:00,622
Why does everything happen to me?
What have I done?

314
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:14,469
God damn it all!

315
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:19,558
Have you hurt yourself?
- What are you doing on the floor?

316
00:30:42,664 --> 00:30:44,374
Good evening, headmaster.

317
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:54,426
There's Gradisca!
Where is she! Over there...

318
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:08,774
If you give the archbishop
permission

319
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,693
to sell holy pictures
in the schools,

320
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,905
we can settle the matter
between us.

321
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:30,879
When are you showing "The Vale
of Love" with Gary Cooper?

322
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:32,589
Next week, my dear.

323
00:31:34,341 --> 00:31:37,135
When can your little prince come
to bed with you?

324
00:31:37,552 --> 00:31:39,471
You'll get my bag round your ear!

325
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:43,183
Such behavior!

326
00:31:46,645 --> 00:31:48,313
Get lost, Giudizio!

327
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,024
It was lovely...
I really had a good cry!

328
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:54,611
Romanesque, 13th century,
perfect condition.

329
00:32:00,325 --> 00:32:03,161
Mullion window...
Excuse me, I'll continue later.

330
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:08,291
Lallo, read the telegram
"White Feather" got from Stockholm.

331
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:12,546
"Come immediately, I cannot live
without you. Inge. "

332
00:32:13,672 --> 00:32:15,715
Is she the bucktoothed one
from last summer?

333
00:32:15,882 --> 00:32:19,553
Are you going?
It'll be cold up there now!

334
00:32:24,057 --> 00:32:28,437
If I shot them,
they'd call me a murderer!

335
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:31,398
I'd throw them all
in quicklime!

336
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:37,946
Get the hell out of here!

337
00:32:39,114 --> 00:32:43,160
I couldn't leave Mamma behind
for those buck teeth.

338
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,580
Look at Madam's new girls.

339
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:51,877
Just look!

340
00:33:01,636 --> 00:33:03,054
See that big one with the hat?

341
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:08,935
I'm here!

342
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:11,313
Here I am, too!

343
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,695
With the sacred right of a place
in the sun...

344
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:22,365
He was a lovely man,
a lot like Wallace Beery.

345
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:25,577
Do you remember? With that beard,
he looked like a French duke.

346
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:46,848
That's a great load!

347
00:34:42,988 --> 00:34:45,574
Good night, King Vittorio,
good night, everybody!

348
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:51,371
This is the Victory Monument
we used to visit everyday.

349
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:54,124
And I dreamt about it
at night, too.

350
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,006
I'm going, Mamma.
- Make a good confession.

351
00:35:01,381 --> 00:35:03,884
If you've had a drink,
you can't receive Communion.

352
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:06,970
You can drink, but you can't eat.

353
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:10,932
You can't drink either.
And tell him you're a delinquent.

354
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:15,353
That you make your parents angry...
that you answer back.

355
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:18,940
And that you curse everything,
understand?

356
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:26,656
Who's the first?

357
00:35:41,713 --> 00:35:44,883
When did you last confess?
- Christmas.

358
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,054
Oh, lovely. Do you go to mass?
- Not when I've got the mumps.

359
00:35:49,221 --> 00:35:51,431
Do you honor your parents?
- Oh, yes.

360
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:57,104
Not like that! White flowers
on one side, yellow on the other.

361
00:35:57,813 --> 00:36:00,941
It's not the same thing,
it's all matter of aesthetics.

362
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:05,362
Well, do you honor your parents?

363
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:09,866
Oh, yes, but they don't honor me.
They beat me.

364
00:36:10,158 --> 00:36:13,120
You must annoy them.
Do you tell lies?

365
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:16,373
I have to. -Do you covet
what belongs to others?

366
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,042
The small flowers
in the small vases.

367
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:21,795
What do you covet?

368
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:26,883
My pal Bragger's got a raincoat
with a lot of metal buckles

369
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,553
Like the one the detective has in
the William Powell-Myrna Loy films.

370
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:32,556
Do you commit impure acts?
Do you touch yourself?

371
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:35,434
Do you know Saint Louis cries
when you touch yourself?

372
00:36:40,188 --> 00:36:42,858
Let him cry...
I'm not going to say whether I do

373
00:36:43,024 --> 00:36:47,487
because you'll only tell Dad.
Don't say you don't touch yourself.

374
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:53,618
Can you avoid touching yourself when
you see her at the tobacconist's

375
00:36:53,785 --> 00:36:56,621
as stacked as she is,
when she says "Export brand"?

376
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:03,962
And the math teacher who looks
just like a lion? Madonna...

377
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:08,383
How can you avoid touching yourself
when she looks at you that way?

378
00:37:10,844 --> 00:37:13,889
What do you think we come to see
on Saint Anthony's day when

379
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:16,892
there's the benediction of
the animals - the sheeps' butts?

380
00:37:39,664 --> 00:37:43,877
See how he's looking at me?
How can I tell him about Volpina

381
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:46,838
when I fixed her bike tires.

382
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:56,431
Did you know people kissed that way,
with tongues going in and out?

383
00:37:56,598 --> 00:37:59,226
I ask the questions, not you.
Go on.

384
00:38:00,143 --> 00:38:03,188
Then, there's Gradisca.
Last summer,

385
00:38:03,355 --> 00:38:06,358
I saw her going into the cinema.

386
00:38:06,775 --> 00:38:11,446
Not because... You see...
I'm crazy about Gradisca.

387
00:38:12,364 --> 00:38:14,449
I want a wife like her.

388
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:19,704
She was alone.

389
00:38:20,997 --> 00:38:23,166
She was there, in front of me.

390
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,467
I changed seats...

391
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,806
I changed seats again...

392
00:38:42,477 --> 00:38:43,520
then again.

393
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:51,153
And finally...

394
00:39:16,678 --> 00:39:18,305
"Looking for something?"

395
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,265
I sat there like an asshole.

396
00:39:20,682 --> 00:39:22,434
I could have jumped in the harbor.

397
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:28,732
Father Balosa can't understand
such things, so I said to him

398
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,319
that I'd touched myself once,
just a little,

399
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:34,029
but I repented immediately.

400
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:39,159
He was happy with that.
He gave me three Our Fathers,

401
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:40,869
Hail Mary's and Glorias
and that was it.

402
00:39:42,954 --> 00:39:45,791
Three Our Fathers, Hail Mary's
and Glorias.

403
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,675
Do you touch yourself?
Just look at those rings

404
00:39:55,884 --> 00:39:59,262
under your eyes!
Yes, you obviously do.

405
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:02,182
Yes, just once in the garage.

406
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,353
Keep still!
Always touching me.

407
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:14,945
Jean Harlow!
Gradisca!

408
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,781
The tobacconist's tits!

409
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,075
The girl at the circus!
- Which one?

410
00:40:20,242 --> 00:40:22,744
The one in the fishnet!
Aldina!

411
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:25,914
No, Aldina's mine!
I'll smack your face!

412
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:22,679
There he is!

413
00:41:55,378 --> 00:41:59,341
Comrades! Salute the Duce!

414
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:04,805
We hail the Duce with grateful
hearts and the Fascist salute!

415
00:42:06,515 --> 00:42:10,018
The greeting of imperial Rome

416
00:42:10,977 --> 00:42:12,270
which shows us

417
00:42:13,897 --> 00:42:16,566
the path of destiny to be
followed by Fascist Italy.

418
00:42:35,293 --> 00:42:38,422
Let me touch him!
I want to touch him!

419
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:42,134
Viva il Duce!

420
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,787
Ninety-nine per cent of the
population carry the party card.

421
00:43:11,246 --> 00:43:14,875
We have 1200 Young Fascists,
3000 Young Italian Girls

422
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:17,502
and 4000 Sons of the She-Wolf.
- A single Fascist heart

423
00:43:17,669 --> 00:43:20,589
but the work on the sea front
needs hurrying up.

424
00:43:20,756 --> 00:43:25,385
This marvelous enthusiasm makes us
young but so old at the same time.

425
00:43:25,594 --> 00:43:29,598
Young, because Fascism has
rejuvenated our blood

426
00:43:29,765 --> 00:43:32,392
with shining ideals that are
very ancient.

427
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:36,521
All I can say is...
Mussolini's got two balls this big!

428
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:43,236
Today, April 21st, we celebrate
the birth of Rome, the Eternal City.

429
00:43:43,612 --> 00:43:46,948
What does that mean? It means
we must respect the monuments,

430
00:43:47,115 --> 00:43:50,744
the ruins that Rome has left us.

431
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,790
That is what I am doing,
despite being razzed at night.

432
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:09,388
Why don't we see
on this glorious sun-filled day,

433
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:14,142
the Italian sun, to which
no one can apply sanctions,

434
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:16,895
is a Divine sign that the heavens
are on our side!

435
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:19,940
Miranda!

436
00:44:22,317 --> 00:44:24,403
Who locked the gate?
- I did!

437
00:44:24,569 --> 00:44:26,947
Why?
- You know why!

438
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:31,201
You've heard what's been going on
in the piazza all day.

439
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:35,872
Open up, I have things to do!
- You're staying at home!

440
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:40,001
If I want to be a widow,
I'll kill you myself.

441
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:42,254
I'll strangle you with
your neckerchief!

442
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:45,090
Think I'm scared of those
black-shirted lice?

443
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:47,342
Give me the key!

444
00:44:51,054 --> 00:44:58,019
Damn it all... why is it that
whenever there's a meeting going on

445
00:44:58,186 --> 00:45:01,690
I have to stay home!
That's the last straw!

446
00:45:15,704 --> 00:45:16,997
These youth are sturdy as rock!

447
00:45:17,873 --> 00:45:20,000
Yes, yes, sturdy as a rock!

448
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:26,214
One, two, three, four,

449
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:29,926
five, six, seven...

450
00:45:36,016 --> 00:45:37,309
Hail to the Duce!

451
00:45:54,534 --> 00:45:57,662
Young Fascist, Ciccio Marconi...

452
00:45:58,205 --> 00:46:03,168
do you wish to marry
Young Italian, Aldina Cordini?

453
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:08,006
And you, Young Italian,
Aldina Cordini...

454
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:13,637
do you wish to marry
Young Fascist, Ciccio Marconi?

455
00:46:14,262 --> 00:46:15,931
Bravo, Ciccio!

456
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:38,412
Camerati, they say bread and work,

457
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,706
but wouldn't bread and wine
be better?

458
00:46:49,631 --> 00:46:51,550
A Fernet... A coffee... Fernet!

459
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:54,094
Just a soft drink.

460
00:46:54,928 --> 00:46:57,931
For our "camerata the Federale"!
Three cheers!

461
00:47:06,148 --> 00:47:10,235
Difficult shot!
Difficult shot!

462
00:47:10,736 --> 00:47:12,529
Quite, Your Excellency,
a difficult shot!

463
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:27,211
I wouldn't like to go up
against him!

464
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,556
Who doused the lights?
Attilio, light a candle.

465
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,516
Light the candle.

466
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:46,064
There's a gramophone upstairs.

467
00:47:47,523 --> 00:47:48,858
What're you saying?

468
00:47:51,194 --> 00:47:52,028
Silence!

469
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:54,572
That's the Internationale!

470
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:58,576
What's the Internationale?
- The hymn of subversives.

471
00:47:59,035 --> 00:48:02,038
Where is it? Where's it coming from?
Where're you hiding, you miserable?

472
00:48:03,331 --> 00:48:04,373
It's incredible!

473
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:09,337
Let's see you, you coward!

474
00:48:13,966 --> 00:48:15,635
We await your orders, sir!

475
00:48:17,553 --> 00:48:20,181
Everyone's to go home!

476
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,434
Close the windows!

477
00:48:26,896 --> 00:48:30,233
Get inside you! Go home!

478
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:36,739
What're you doing there?
Get home with you!

479
00:48:53,881 --> 00:48:56,259
Hey! He's up there!

480
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,929
He's in the bell tower.

481
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:45,850
To arms, to arms, to arms

482
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:48,686
We are Fascists.
We fight against the Communists...

483
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:21,177
You're free.

484
00:50:22,428 --> 00:50:27,141
You can go home. You see!
The Fascists aren't all that bad.

485
00:50:27,517 --> 00:50:30,812
They've not even harmed
a single hair.

486
00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:34,982
We almost offered you coffee
as well.

487
00:50:35,525 --> 00:50:37,235
Good night, sunny boy!

488
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:41,864
Bring him here.

489
00:50:56,504 --> 00:50:57,755
Take your hat off.

490
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:02,051
I'm sorry, it's a habit...
even at home.

491
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:05,096
Why don't you use
the Roman style of greeting?

492
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,308
I didn't know it was mandatory.

493
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,519
I don't know anything
about politics.

494
00:51:12,395 --> 00:51:13,938
Sit down!

495
00:51:15,189 --> 00:51:17,275
So you don't know anything
about politics!

496
00:51:18,234 --> 00:51:20,695
Yet you have been heard to say:

497
00:51:21,863 --> 00:51:25,491
"If Mussolini continues like this,
I really don't know. "

498
00:51:26,743 --> 00:51:29,537
What do you mean by
"I really don't know"?

499
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,875
I never said anything like that.

500
00:51:34,417 --> 00:51:37,879
I generally only talk
about my work. Perhaps I said...

501
00:51:38,087 --> 00:51:41,716
I really don't know about politics,
how it works...

502
00:51:41,883 --> 00:51:45,136
Is that a threat?
- Certainly not!

503
00:51:45,428 --> 00:51:48,431
Lack of faith in Fascism?
- No, why?

504
00:51:49,098 --> 00:51:53,144
Subversive propaganda, perhaps?
- No, there's no reason for it.

505
00:51:56,773 --> 00:52:02,695
And you know nothing about
the gramophone? -The gramophone?

506
00:52:03,112 --> 00:52:05,323
Don't try to be a wise guy!
Answer!

507
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:11,913
They woke me from my sleep. I didn't
even have time to put my tie on.

508
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:20,379
Your tie or your anarchist's
neckerchief? -What neckerchief?

509
00:52:25,385 --> 00:52:29,597
Would you like to drink a toast
to the victory of Fascism?

510
00:52:32,225 --> 00:52:34,519
Well, really at this time...

511
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:36,270
At this time...

512
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:42,527
You fools!
Trying our patience in this way!

513
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:46,447
You must drink to a Fascist
victory, my friend.

514
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:49,450
We don't want to crack your
skulls to make you understand

515
00:52:49,617 --> 00:52:52,620
that Fascism is for your protection,
for your dignity.

516
00:52:52,954 --> 00:52:56,290
Go to hell, you ignorant
bunch of animals!

517
00:53:00,628 --> 00:53:02,964
This is castor oil.
- Drink it!

518
00:53:03,297 --> 00:53:06,968
Why should I drink it?
What have I done?

519
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:12,890
What are you doing?
Leave me alone! What are you doing?

520
00:53:14,934 --> 00:53:17,854
Be good! Open your mouth!

521
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:21,357
Open your mouth!
Don't make me angry!

522
00:53:22,483 --> 00:53:25,319
Drink it down,
it'll do you good!

523
00:53:25,528 --> 00:53:29,449
Just look at the state he's in...
a man of his age. It's shameful!

524
00:53:31,075 --> 00:53:33,369
What're you doing, vomiting
on my shoes?

525
00:53:34,412 --> 00:53:42,044
This is what saddens us, this utter
refusal to understand. Why?

526
00:53:44,505 --> 00:53:46,340
Why, I ask?

527
00:53:46,507 --> 00:53:48,885
There must be something wrong
with your head.

528
00:53:49,052 --> 00:53:51,721
Have some more...
it'll clear your ideas!

529
00:53:53,473 --> 00:53:55,475
You'll pay for this!
- Well, just send us the bill.

530
00:53:56,976 --> 00:53:58,561
Good Heavens, it's two o'clock!

531
00:54:03,149 --> 00:54:04,108
Aurelio!

532
00:54:11,282 --> 00:54:12,533
What's happened?

533
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,730
You won't listen to me!

534
00:54:44,816 --> 00:54:46,442
You'll see!

535
00:54:54,826 --> 00:54:56,411
Get up...

536
00:55:00,456 --> 00:55:02,333
Dry yourself.

537
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:07,922
Don't catch cold.

538
00:55:13,386 --> 00:55:14,637
Dad!

539
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:17,181
Go to bed!

540
00:55:18,516 --> 00:55:20,435
God, what a stink!

541
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:28,025
If the person who squealed
is the one I think it is,

542
00:55:28,234 --> 00:55:31,195
he'd better move
to another continent

543
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:34,532
because I'll eat his guts
I'll eat his balls!

544
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:39,287
Traitorous son of a bitch!

545
00:55:44,959 --> 00:55:46,294
The Grand Hotel.

546
00:55:46,919 --> 00:55:49,881
I call her the "Old Lady".

547
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:54,552
I come here every year
to sip the nectar of love.

548
00:55:55,261 --> 00:55:58,222
I give kindness
and I yearn for kindness.

549
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:01,893
I'm the only one in town
to visit the Grand Hotel.

550
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,687
They say Gradisca was here once.

551
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:08,107
It was because of that highly
improbable adventure

552
00:56:08,274 --> 00:56:10,777
that she came
to be called Gradisca.

553
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:15,531
Her real name is Ninola.
But three years ago...

554
00:56:15,698 --> 00:56:17,241
one winter night...

555
00:56:17,408 --> 00:56:19,285
Don't let us down, Ninola!

556
00:56:19,452 --> 00:56:21,370
The Prince is a handsome man,
you know.

557
00:56:22,121 --> 00:56:27,376
If he looks like he's satisfied,
mention the work on the harbor.

558
00:56:27,543 --> 00:56:29,754
It'll only take a word from him.

559
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:31,881
Be polite, speak Italian.

560
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,593
He's a real prince,
not just any old asshole.

561
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,138
It's a great opportunity
for you, too. The harbor.

562
01:00:02,216 --> 01:00:03,926
Oh, Mister Prince, sir...

563
01:00:06,137 --> 01:00:07,680
Gradisca!

564
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:12,477
That's how Ninola
came to be called Gradisca.

565
01:00:13,227 --> 01:00:15,688
I don't think there's a lot
of truth in this story.

566
01:00:15,855 --> 01:00:18,191
Nor in the one that Biscein tells.

567
01:00:18,691 --> 01:00:22,070
He's an inveterate liar.
He invents a new one each day.

568
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,697
A couple of years back...

569
01:00:24,864 --> 01:00:27,825
an Emir arrived
with thirty concubines.

570
01:00:28,409 --> 01:00:29,994
I saw him arrive.

571
01:02:16,809 --> 01:02:21,314
The Emir locked all thirty rooms
every night up tight.

572
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:26,277
That is quite true, but the rest
of Biscein's story has holes in it.

573
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,159
The silly man claims that
on that very night...

574
01:02:33,326 --> 01:02:36,245
Beans, olives,
toasted melon seeds!

575
01:03:00,728 --> 01:03:02,980
Here I am, here I am, girls!

576
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,153
Come on, Biscein!

577
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:20,581
Sweet Jesus, the pussy!

578
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:18,514
He claims that making no distinction
between the beautiful and the ugly,

579
01:04:18,681 --> 01:04:20,933
he polished off 28 of them
that night!

580
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,859
Uncle!

581
01:04:32,695 --> 01:04:36,783
Are you Polish? Because only Poles
have this fire in their eyes.

582
01:04:39,494 --> 01:04:41,079
My uncle dances very well!

583
01:04:55,093 --> 01:04:57,470
Commander!
Ladies!

584
01:04:59,722 --> 01:05:02,934
Then you must be Czech!
Because only Czech women

585
01:05:03,101 --> 01:05:04,560
have this fire in their eyes.

586
01:05:04,727 --> 01:05:07,688
I now Italian: "bellissima,"
"Buonasera"

587
01:05:07,855 --> 01:05:10,316
"Michelangelo," "Fanculo"
, "O sole mio. "

588
01:05:29,502 --> 01:05:30,670
Good evening.

589
01:05:48,104 --> 01:05:50,982
Uncle! Uncle!
- Get out of here!

590
01:05:51,149 --> 01:05:53,192
Jesus, the waiter-asshole...
asshole... asshole.

591
01:06:14,047 --> 01:06:15,840
Seen the sea?
- The sea?

592
01:06:16,716 --> 01:06:19,552
Come and take a walk with me.
Let's go!

593
01:06:24,807 --> 01:06:28,478
Leopardi wrote poetry.
Do you know Leopardi?

594
01:06:29,228 --> 01:06:31,481
No, this is my first time here.

595
01:06:33,566 --> 01:06:39,238
Dante Alghieri here,
Leopardi here, or even here!

596
01:06:39,572 --> 01:06:41,115
Oh, good!

597
01:06:43,743 --> 01:06:45,036
Skol!

598
01:07:00,343 --> 01:07:01,844
How did it go?

599
01:07:02,053 --> 01:07:06,015
Fine, it's always a pushover
with Germans.

600
01:07:07,392 --> 01:07:09,268
She's really fallen for me.

601
01:07:10,436 --> 01:07:14,065
And to prove it, she even
offered me posterior intimacy.

602
01:07:38,297 --> 01:07:40,341
Uncle! Uncle!

603
01:07:41,467 --> 01:07:43,469
Uncle Teo was Dad's brother.

604
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:47,306
We went to take him for a ride
every month, in the summer.

605
01:07:47,849 --> 01:07:48,891
He's coming.

606
01:07:56,607 --> 01:07:57,650
He's coming.

607
01:08:03,448 --> 01:08:04,782
Hello, Uncle!

608
01:08:05,616 --> 01:08:07,368
How are things, Teo?

609
01:08:07,827 --> 01:08:09,662
He's happy, Mamma.

610
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:12,248
He's looking well.

611
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,083
Yes, he's looking well.

612
01:08:15,835 --> 01:08:17,170
Watch your step.

613
01:08:19,505 --> 01:08:23,509
How are you?
- And how are you?

614
01:08:23,676 --> 01:08:25,428
I'm fine, I go to school.

615
01:08:28,014 --> 01:08:30,641
Guess where we're taking you today?

616
01:08:30,808 --> 01:08:32,185
To eat "passatelli" at the farm.

617
01:08:33,811 --> 01:08:35,605
What do you think of that?

618
01:08:36,147 --> 01:08:38,524
Look, Dad's here too.
He's a lovely lad!

619
01:08:39,942 --> 01:08:42,153
Give Dad a kiss.

620
01:08:44,155 --> 01:08:46,157
How's he?
- He's normal.

621
01:08:46,949 --> 01:08:49,202
He's grown, hasn't he?
He's in the fifth grade.

622
01:08:49,368 --> 01:08:51,621
And he got dead drunk
the other night.

623
01:08:54,165 --> 01:08:56,834
How are you keeping?
- I'm much better.

624
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:01,339
Mamma, the pastries!
Uncle, Mamma brought you pastries.

625
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:05,009
We'll be back before evening.

626
01:09:07,095 --> 01:09:08,388
Have a smoke on me.

627
01:09:15,186 --> 01:09:17,021
Is Father Pazzaglia still alive?

628
01:09:18,106 --> 01:09:20,566
He's been dead ten years now.

629
01:09:20,733 --> 01:09:22,860
He's been gone quite a time!

630
01:09:23,027 --> 01:09:25,696
He was alive last year.
- That was Father Amadeo.

631
01:09:27,615 --> 01:09:31,077
Is he dead as well?
- No, he's alive.

632
01:09:31,702 --> 01:09:33,413
Exactly, that's what I was saying.

633
01:09:34,205 --> 01:09:38,418
I saw him last year, walking
along with a bunch of flowers.

634
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,087
I wonder where he was going?

635
01:09:44,757 --> 01:09:47,593
Teo was a bright lad
when he was eight.

636
01:09:49,011 --> 01:09:50,930
I don't want
to offend you, Aurelio,

637
01:09:51,055 --> 01:09:53,641
but Teo was smarter than you
at school.

638
01:09:54,267 --> 01:09:57,186
I grant you that.
That's quite true.

639
01:09:57,353 --> 01:09:59,772
He still is, even now.

640
01:09:59,939 --> 01:10:03,151
Do you like being with us, Teo?

641
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:07,780
Uncle, the sea's over there.
It's like a blue streak.

642
01:10:09,282 --> 01:10:11,451
Dad, can I drive the horse?
- No!

643
01:10:12,368 --> 01:10:15,371
What can I do just sitting here,
then? Let me drive it!

644
01:10:15,538 --> 01:10:18,833
That'll be the first time a horse
was driven by a mule!

645
01:10:22,545 --> 01:10:24,255
That's a shorter road.

646
01:10:25,131 --> 01:10:28,426
An awful road, full of potholes,
enough to take this carriage.

647
01:10:29,135 --> 01:10:30,762
Is something wrong?

648
01:10:36,476 --> 01:10:39,395
Why do you carry those
in your pocket?

649
01:10:42,607 --> 01:10:44,108
These stones!

650
01:10:46,486 --> 01:10:50,239
Aren't they heavy?
- They're beautiful, stones are.

651
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,330
Stop the carriage!

652
01:10:58,915 --> 01:11:00,917
Teo needs to take a leak!

653
01:11:02,251 --> 01:11:03,169
If he has to...

654
01:11:06,589 --> 01:11:08,174
Watch how you get down.

655
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:12,428
You too?

656
01:11:13,971 --> 01:11:15,723
Don't be long, Grandpa,
I'm hungry.

657
01:11:16,974 --> 01:11:19,143
My father's father used to say:

658
01:11:19,602 --> 01:11:22,522
to be fit as a fiddle,
you have to piddle!

659
01:11:23,272 --> 01:11:26,484
To be fit as a frog,
pee often like a dog.

660
01:11:27,318 --> 01:11:29,320
How green!
How beautiful, Teo...

661
01:11:34,075 --> 01:11:37,662
How old's the mare?
- Three years and two months.

662
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:40,415
She's only got one vice,
she can't stand train whistles.

663
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:45,253
When I'm at the station stand,
it's really a job to hold her!

664
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:50,591
What'll you give her to eat today?
- Cappelletti.

665
01:11:50,758 --> 01:11:52,844
You forgot to unbutton your fly!

666
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,554
Uncle pissed in his pants!

667
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,684
They said he was normal!

668
01:11:59,892 --> 01:12:02,562
You didn't undo your fly!

669
01:12:03,563 --> 01:12:05,231
He forgot.

670
01:12:06,274 --> 01:12:08,109
It's really true.

671
01:12:08,276 --> 01:12:10,486
The sea looks like a blue streak.

672
01:12:10,653 --> 01:12:13,865
You pissed in your pants!
- Shut up!

673
01:12:14,866 --> 01:12:16,534
He didn't open the shop!

674
01:12:17,869 --> 01:12:20,121
It doesn't matter,
you can change at the farm.

675
01:12:25,585 --> 01:12:28,046
Come here, or I'll throw myself
under the wheels!

676
01:12:29,213 --> 01:12:31,299
Sit down, you criminal!

677
01:12:31,799 --> 01:12:33,468
Shall we move on?

678
01:12:44,979 --> 01:12:47,315
Ah, that was a fine meal!

679
01:12:48,066 --> 01:12:50,568
You all go and see the spring.

680
01:12:50,777 --> 01:12:54,739
My son Teo and I will stay here
and have another glass of wine.

681
01:12:55,281 --> 01:12:57,950
Fine, but just one and no more.

682
01:12:58,493 --> 01:13:01,829
Know what I'll do?
I'll have a nap.

683
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,834
Good. It won't do you any harm
here in the shade.

684
01:13:07,794 --> 01:13:10,004
The eggs's lovely, isn't it, Teo?

685
01:13:10,713 --> 01:13:15,635
Me too. When I see an egg,
I could look at it for hours.

686
01:13:16,344 --> 01:13:20,139
I ask myself how Nature manages
to make things so perfect.

687
01:13:20,765 --> 01:13:24,644
God made Nature,
not an ignorant lout like you!

688
01:13:25,228 --> 01:13:28,523
Oh, don't bust my chops!
See you later here.

689
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:33,653
I'm relying on you, Dad. Menghino,
how far away is this spring?

690
01:13:41,702 --> 01:13:43,704
Uncle, look, I'm hypnotizing it.

691
01:13:54,006 --> 01:13:57,301
Oliva, there's a toad!
It looks like Father Balosa!

692
01:14:06,018 --> 01:14:08,396
What's it like?
- Fantastic!

693
01:14:08,563 --> 01:14:11,733
It won't give you a hangover.
We'll put it here.

694
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:20,366
Throw that stone away!

695
01:14:21,409 --> 01:14:23,035
You naughty little boy!

696
01:14:26,622 --> 01:14:29,083
I know what your name is,
you delinquent!

697
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:37,300
Dad, Uncle Teo's up a tree!

698
01:14:38,384 --> 01:14:41,721
What's that? What's he shouting?
- I can't understand.

699
01:14:42,388 --> 01:14:45,016
Uncle Teo's up a tree!

700
01:14:47,894 --> 01:14:51,022
I want a woman!

701
01:14:53,191 --> 01:14:56,486
I want a woman!

702
01:15:02,742 --> 01:15:05,536
But where am I going
to get you a woman, my boy?

703
01:15:05,703 --> 01:15:07,413
Uncle's up there.

704
01:15:08,581 --> 01:15:10,500
I want a woman!

705
01:15:11,376 --> 01:15:13,086
There he is, up there!

706
01:15:16,047 --> 01:15:18,633
Come down, Teo,
you'll hurt yourself.

707
01:15:18,841 --> 01:15:20,968
Quickly, get a ladder!

708
01:15:21,469 --> 01:15:24,931
Is this how you keep an eye on him?
How did he get up there?

709
01:15:25,515 --> 01:15:29,560
I'll go up.
- I'll hammer you into the ground.

710
01:15:33,398 --> 01:15:37,902
How did he get up there?
If he falls he'll break every bone.

711
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,988
You go indoors and stop
playing the actress.

712
01:15:42,073 --> 01:15:43,991
How did he do it?

713
01:15:44,117 --> 01:15:46,619
We were having a drink,
and like a shot...

714
01:15:46,786 --> 01:15:49,622
He was away and up there
like a cat.

715
01:15:50,164 --> 01:15:53,668
What're you doing?
Throwing stones at your old dad!

716
01:15:53,835 --> 01:15:55,920
That's enough, now!

717
01:15:57,046 --> 01:16:01,634
Now, now! Don't you do the same!

718
01:16:02,093 --> 01:16:04,846
Come down, Teo,
your brother's angry.

719
01:16:05,513 --> 01:16:07,473
Come down, now!

720
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,935
I WANT A WOMAN!

721
01:16:12,562 --> 01:16:16,983
It's quite a normal urge. He's 42!
- Yes, but he'll fall down.

722
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:19,902
When I was 42... I'll tell you!

723
01:16:22,196 --> 01:16:25,283
Now, that's enough, Teo!

724
01:16:25,867 --> 01:16:27,869
Climb down, Teo!

725
01:16:28,035 --> 01:16:32,206
Good shot, Uncle,
right on his head!

726
01:16:35,001 --> 01:16:37,795
Right on the target.

727
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,802
Now, I'll come up,
but don't throw anything at me!

728
01:16:46,012 --> 01:16:47,847
We'll take some birds home.

729
01:16:48,473 --> 01:16:52,060
Do you want to kill us all?
- Now, I'm coming up.

730
01:16:53,478 --> 01:16:57,148
Yes sirree! If you throw
one at me, you'll hear about it!

731
01:17:01,486 --> 01:17:06,866
What a shot! Murderer! I hope
somebody kicks you in the nuts!

732
01:17:10,328 --> 01:17:14,290
Christ, what'll I do now?
Jerk off?

733
01:17:18,169 --> 01:17:21,130
I'm an asshole, a stupid asshole.

734
01:17:24,675 --> 01:17:26,302
Well, let's all go home!

735
01:17:26,469 --> 01:17:31,974
Driver, hitch up the horse,
we're going home!

736
01:17:32,558 --> 01:17:36,854
Are you going to leave him up there?
- Yes! Hitch up the horse. Let's go!

737
01:17:37,563 --> 01:17:40,191
As you wish.
- Dad! Titta!

738
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,945
Call your mother!
Where's your mother?

739
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:46,031
Leaving him there?
- He's all right up there.

740
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,533
Let's go! I want to go home.

741
01:17:47,741 --> 01:17:50,494
But he's my son!
Aurelio, listen to me.

742
01:17:50,661 --> 01:17:54,373
I want a woman!
- Miranda!

743
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:57,543
Teo, we're going. Come down!

744
01:18:00,796 --> 01:18:02,089
We're just pretending.

745
01:18:03,048 --> 01:18:07,803
Listen, Aurelio...
Send me up there. He'll come down.

746
01:18:15,436 --> 01:18:17,104
Everyone in the carriage!

747
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:21,108
We're leaving right away. Get in.

748
01:18:21,275 --> 01:18:26,238
Teo, what're you doing? Staying
there? We're going now. It's late.

749
01:18:27,448 --> 01:18:30,743
It's getting dark.
Who'll take you back?

750
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:34,580
You going to stay up there?
All right, then, ciao!

751
01:18:44,256 --> 01:18:45,424
Come down!

752
01:18:52,514 --> 01:18:56,560
Teo, Holy Mother of God!
Are you going to come down?

753
01:18:57,144 --> 01:18:58,729
We're leaving!

754
01:19:02,733 --> 01:19:04,777
Good-bye, Uncle!

755
01:19:25,172 --> 01:19:27,800
He'll kill the lot of us, today.

756
01:19:29,968 --> 01:19:33,222
Come on, let's have you all out!
Get out, now! No questions!

757
01:19:33,389 --> 01:19:35,307
What're you crying about?

758
01:19:36,141 --> 01:19:39,520
Now, you drive to the hospital
and call the attendants.

759
01:19:39,686 --> 01:19:41,814
And come back right away,
or I'll throw myself down the well!

760
01:19:43,357 --> 01:19:46,068
What're you crying about?
It's a big laugh, it's just comic!

761
01:20:04,336 --> 01:20:06,880
Listen to him, Miranda.
Poor lad.

762
01:20:09,133 --> 01:20:10,384
Do you feel better?

763
01:20:14,346 --> 01:20:18,851
I want a woman!

764
01:20:28,902 --> 01:20:32,281
I can't stand any more!

765
01:20:32,448 --> 01:20:35,033
Make him shut up!
I've had enough!

766
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,578
Dad... Dad...
- What do you want?

767
01:20:37,745 --> 01:20:39,496
Shall I go and call Volpina?

768
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:47,629
Look, Dad.

769
01:20:49,381 --> 01:20:50,799
Mamma, they've arrived.

770
01:20:53,552 --> 01:20:55,304
Good evening, Doctor.
- What's happened?

771
01:20:55,929 --> 01:20:59,725
He's up the tree.
- Nice place. Fresh air. All yours?

772
01:20:59,892 --> 01:21:01,727
It's only an old farm.

773
01:21:03,604 --> 01:21:06,732
He's been up there for five hours.

774
01:21:06,899 --> 01:21:09,485
You can't see him now,
because of the foliage.

775
01:21:09,651 --> 01:21:11,695
What have you done to him?
- Nothing.

776
01:21:11,862 --> 01:21:14,490
He's been shouting
and throwing stones.

777
01:21:14,656 --> 01:21:16,825
I hope he won't always be like
this... his whole life, Doctor.

778
01:21:16,992 --> 01:21:18,744
A dwarf nun!

779
01:21:22,998 --> 01:21:25,584
It'll be bad for him
and worse for us.

780
01:21:25,751 --> 01:21:27,211
Keep cool, she'll attend to things.

781
01:21:28,337 --> 01:21:30,422
Were you getting a bit of air?

782
01:21:32,591 --> 01:21:34,218
Is she going up?

783
01:21:35,803 --> 01:21:39,264
Come down! I'm not going
to play these damn silly games!

784
01:21:43,977 --> 01:21:46,438
Jesus, just look at that!
She's got him to come down!

785
01:21:48,774 --> 01:21:51,402
She's got him down
and he's quite happy.

786
01:21:55,197 --> 01:21:56,824
Teo, Teo...

787
01:21:57,825 --> 01:21:59,284
Here he is.

788
01:22:00,828 --> 01:22:03,247
So, have you been up
to your tricks again, have you?

789
01:22:03,414 --> 01:22:05,749
What were you doing up there?

790
01:22:05,916 --> 01:22:08,752
Counting how many stones
fig trees grow in this season.

791
01:22:08,919 --> 01:22:10,129
Take him home.

792
01:22:13,841 --> 01:22:17,678
Some days he's normal, some days
he isn't... just like all of us.

793
01:22:18,554 --> 01:22:21,515
Ciao, Uncle!
- Titta, take care.

794
01:22:27,187 --> 01:22:29,481
You can see Gigino's place
from up there.

795
01:22:30,441 --> 01:22:32,484
It's a long time since
I saw him.

796
01:22:37,239 --> 01:22:40,701
Between 11 o'clock and midnight,
in Caghetta's boat.

797
01:22:42,786 --> 01:22:46,373
It's thirty stories high
and has sixteen smokestacks.

798
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:49,460
Think what a pirate could do
with a ship like that!

799
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:21,366
Where's "Ronald Coleman"?
I don't see him.

800
01:23:21,950 --> 01:23:23,994
Gradisca! Hurray for Gradisca!

801
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:31,043
Hello, sister.
- Your steamboat. Climb aboard!

802
01:23:36,799 --> 01:23:39,635
Where're all these people going?

803
01:23:39,802 --> 01:23:45,015
Where're they going with hearts
all pounding? Where're they going?

804
01:23:47,017 --> 01:23:50,687
Today is a very important day for
our country, for our fatherland...

805
01:23:50,854 --> 01:23:52,773
Come on, we're off!

806
01:23:53,941 --> 01:23:56,193
If you drop me,
you'll have to pay for it all.

807
01:23:57,319 --> 01:24:02,616
I'd like to tell you, but I can't
because it's all still in the air.

808
01:24:04,076 --> 01:24:06,203
Where're these people going?

809
01:24:22,594 --> 01:24:24,888
How far out will it be?
- Eight kilometers.

810
01:24:25,055 --> 01:24:28,809
But thanks to Galileo, it will
seem like 400 meters to us.

811
01:24:28,976 --> 01:24:31,603
Marvelous! It'll seem like
it's coming straight at us.

812
01:24:49,371 --> 01:24:51,790
Mr. Lawyer, how much will it weigh?

813
01:24:53,042 --> 01:24:55,210
About two and a half times
the weight of the Grand Hotel.

814
01:24:55,669 --> 01:24:57,880
Plus the Arch of Augustus!

815
01:24:58,422 --> 01:25:01,633
"Go thou, Queen of the Sea

816
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,471
"Thou passeth and thy destiny

817
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:08,515
"I shall follow in the waves

818
01:25:08,682 --> 01:25:13,479
"Watching the glistening wake... "

819
01:25:13,687 --> 01:25:16,440
Get closer to your mother,
and you move nearer to your son.

820
01:25:18,859 --> 01:25:21,987
Suck me off! The water's
really freezing!

821
01:25:23,405 --> 01:25:26,492
My nuts has shriveled to the size
of two dried beans.

822
01:25:28,368 --> 01:25:31,038
You swam out?
- Sure!

823
01:25:31,205 --> 01:25:33,832
I did the Australian crawl.

824
01:25:38,545 --> 01:25:43,926
"I want to dance with you

825
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,306
"All night like this... "

826
01:25:49,473 --> 01:25:54,061
The third day I went there
with my boat, whistled as usual

827
01:25:55,229 --> 01:25:58,065
and out came the dolphin.

828
01:25:58,232 --> 01:25:59,983
It looked at me
and said "mamma"!

829
01:26:01,485 --> 01:26:03,570
What a load of bull!

830
01:26:03,737 --> 01:26:06,198
Dolphins are intelligent,
my dentist told me so.

831
01:26:09,368 --> 01:26:11,662
Look how many there are.

832
01:26:12,329 --> 01:26:14,873
Millions and millions
and millions of stars.

833
01:26:15,916 --> 01:26:17,835
Jesus Christ, you guys!
I wonder

834
01:26:17,918 --> 01:26:21,213
how the whole lot
stays up there in place?

835
01:26:23,215 --> 01:26:26,301
It's pretty simple for us.

836
01:26:26,593 --> 01:26:29,847
If we have to build a house,
so many bricks, so much lime...

837
01:26:30,055 --> 01:26:32,933
But up there, Sweet Jesus!
Where do you put the foundations?

838
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:35,936
They aren't just confetti,
you know!

839
01:26:38,313 --> 01:26:40,607
Are you asleep? Answer me!

840
01:26:41,775 --> 01:26:44,903
Are you cold? Want my jacket?
Come on, take my jacket.

841
01:26:46,405 --> 01:26:49,241
Put it round your shoulders or
you'll get a chill and complain.

842
01:26:49,616 --> 01:26:53,245
We've still a long time to wait,
haven't we? It's one o'clock.

843
01:26:53,412 --> 01:26:55,706
How would I know? They said
it'd be around midnight.

844
01:26:55,831 --> 01:26:57,666
Even if it's late, it's coming
from America, you know.

845
01:26:59,626 --> 01:27:01,128
Go fuck yourselves, all of you!

846
01:27:01,295 --> 01:27:03,172
He's a friend...

847
01:27:08,052 --> 01:27:09,470
He sent you best wishes.

848
01:27:11,638 --> 01:27:16,143
Every time I was full of hope,
but it never came to anything.

849
01:27:17,978 --> 01:27:19,229
And now...

850
01:27:20,397 --> 01:27:22,775
Know how old I am?
- Fifty-two?

851
01:27:22,983 --> 01:27:25,110
I'm not ashamed to tell the truth.

852
01:27:25,277 --> 01:27:29,448
In fact, I always add
a few years on. I'm thirty.

853
01:27:29,656 --> 01:27:32,242
That's surprising, my darling.
- I haven't given up hope.

854
01:27:32,409 --> 01:27:34,453
I thought you were seventeen age.

855
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:39,333
I want one of those long encounters
that last a lifetime.

856
01:27:40,959 --> 01:27:44,922
I want a family, children,
a husband

857
01:27:45,089 --> 01:27:50,260
to chat with in the evening
at supper, maybe,

858
01:27:50,427 --> 01:27:53,389
and to make love with now and then,
because that's important too.

859
01:27:54,473 --> 01:27:56,934
But affection is perhaps
even more necessary than love.

860
01:27:58,227 --> 01:28:00,938
I'm so full of affection.

861
01:28:01,939 --> 01:28:05,275
But who can I lavish it on,
who wants it?

862
01:28:05,442 --> 01:28:08,862
Why are you crying? Look at
the silly girl, she's crying!

863
01:28:09,029 --> 01:28:13,575
The girl is delicate
and sensitive, oh yes!

864
01:28:14,535 --> 01:28:19,456
She's right! Men are all the same!
- Don't cry, my darling!

865
01:28:43,939 --> 01:28:46,358
Here it is!
- Dad, Dad!

866
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:49,486
The Rex! The Rex!

867
01:28:50,946 --> 01:28:54,950
Hurray for the Rex! The greatest
thing the regime has built!

868
01:28:59,288 --> 01:29:03,250
As the representative of the Podesta,
I wish you a safe journey!

869
01:29:03,417 --> 01:29:04,960
Long live Italy!

870
01:29:05,419 --> 01:29:08,839
What's it like?
What's it like?

871
01:29:54,635 --> 01:29:56,261
Just look at this!

872
01:30:09,483 --> 01:30:11,652
Can't see a darned thing!

873
01:30:14,446 --> 01:30:16,448
I'll keep to the wall.

874
01:30:18,492 --> 01:30:21,370
The last fog like this was in '22.

875
01:30:25,874 --> 01:30:30,337
Careful now, stop.
There's a man here!

876
01:30:35,759 --> 01:30:37,720
Well, damn it all.

877
01:30:41,223 --> 01:30:45,811
Gina! Gina!

878
01:30:50,274 --> 01:30:55,028
Where am I?
I don't seem to be anywhere.

879
01:30:59,908 --> 01:31:04,538
If death is like this,
I don't think much of it.

880
01:31:06,707 --> 01:31:12,713
Everything's gone.
People, trees, birds, wine...

881
01:31:15,758 --> 01:31:17,009
Up yours!

882
01:31:24,767 --> 01:31:30,939
Dino, I can't even find
my house. Where am I?

883
01:31:31,482 --> 01:31:34,401
You are in front of your house.

884
01:31:34,568 --> 01:31:35,819
It's there...

885
01:31:48,123 --> 01:31:51,585
Where're you going in all this fog?
- To school. Ciao, Grandpa.

886
01:31:53,587 --> 01:31:54,922
Just think of that.

887
01:33:13,876 --> 01:33:17,087
I was in Norway. Two women...

888
01:33:18,005 --> 01:33:22,134
beautiful, huge, Norwegians!

889
01:33:22,843 --> 01:33:25,054
Beans, olives,
toasted melon seeds...

890
01:33:35,147 --> 01:33:37,232
It's open, you can get in.

891
01:33:38,275 --> 01:33:40,027
Last one in's a queer!

892
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:43,655
Naso, get an eyeful of this.

893
01:33:56,794 --> 01:34:00,172
It's gorgeous!

894
01:34:59,231 --> 01:35:00,899
Where are you, my love?

895
01:35:58,207 --> 01:36:00,918
It was number 18.
18... Campari.

896
01:36:01,418 --> 01:36:03,712
Aldina, do you want to know
who it was?

897
01:36:04,088 --> 01:36:05,672
We know, it was Campari.

898
01:36:06,048 --> 01:36:07,925
I knew him in the race at Monza.

899
01:37:18,579 --> 01:37:19,830
Aldina!

900
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:37,890
Be careful, Lallo!

901
01:37:40,893 --> 01:37:43,020
What is it?
- An ear.

902
01:37:43,812 --> 01:37:45,564
Look, an ear!

903
01:38:02,748 --> 01:38:05,584
Can I come in?
- I'm closed.

904
01:38:05,751 --> 01:38:07,086
Can I come in, miss?

905
01:38:08,128 --> 01:38:10,172
What do you want?
- A cigarette.

906
01:38:15,594 --> 01:38:18,764
Can I help you?
- You couldn't manage.

907
01:38:18,972 --> 01:38:24,103
What do you mean? I can lift 80
kilos. I can even lift my father.

908
01:38:27,022 --> 01:38:30,567
What do you weigh?
- I don't know.

909
01:38:31,902 --> 01:38:33,737
I could lift you, too.

910
01:38:53,841 --> 01:38:55,426
Let's see you.

911
01:38:56,093 --> 01:38:59,263
I really can.
- Let's see.

912
01:39:06,353 --> 01:39:08,605
You silly boy,
put me down, let me go!

913
01:39:10,733 --> 01:39:14,903
You're strong!
- I'll lift you again.

914
01:39:22,786 --> 01:39:24,163
Now that's enough.

915
01:39:36,091 --> 01:39:39,845
What're you doing?
You'll let me fall! You mad thing!

916
01:39:40,888 --> 01:39:42,347
Put me down, that's enough!

917
01:39:43,599 --> 01:39:45,642
You'll let me drop, you crazy boy!

918
01:39:47,978 --> 01:39:49,980
You really are mad...
What's happened to me? My head...

919
01:39:50,189 --> 01:39:53,067
See how many times I did it?

920
01:39:58,405 --> 01:40:04,536
Yes, my little darling...
Come here... you really are nice.

921
01:40:07,247 --> 01:40:10,751
Drive me crazy, just a little.

922
01:40:11,293 --> 01:40:14,505
What should I do?
- Suck!

923
01:40:15,923 --> 01:40:18,133
Come on...

924
01:40:22,554 --> 01:40:25,099
You can have this one, too...

925
01:40:25,933 --> 01:40:28,769
Don't blow! Suck!

926
01:40:28,936 --> 01:40:33,941
Is this right?
- Yes, darling, yes!

927
01:40:35,901 --> 01:40:38,070
You have to suck, you idiot!

928
01:40:38,946 --> 01:40:40,531
I can't breathe!

929
01:40:41,657 --> 01:40:45,369
Let me alone. Get out, now,
I've got to close up.

930
01:40:47,162 --> 01:40:49,748
What was it you wanted?
A cigarette?

931
01:40:50,624 --> 01:40:53,419
I'll give you one.
Now, beat it!

932
01:41:01,802 --> 01:41:02,803
I can't manage it.

933
01:41:07,099 --> 01:41:10,144
Come on, get out!
- Good night!

934
01:41:17,526 --> 01:41:19,194
Drink it. It'll do you good.

935
01:41:20,195 --> 01:41:22,406
It's hot!
- It has to be hot.

936
01:41:40,549 --> 01:41:41,800
There's a fly.

937
01:41:42,176 --> 01:41:45,095
Where is it?
- It was there.

938
01:41:48,766 --> 01:41:51,060
The only house with flies
in winter...

939
01:41:52,019 --> 01:41:55,939
How did it happen with you and Dad?

940
01:41:56,815 --> 01:42:02,029
What? -How'd you meet,
fall in love, get married?

941
01:42:05,866 --> 01:42:09,995
What's all this about?
Anyway, who remembers!

942
01:42:10,704 --> 01:42:13,457
Your dad's not a great one
for compliments.

943
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:16,543
He was a laborer at Saludecio,

944
01:42:17,544 --> 01:42:21,840
my folks had a bit of money and
they didn't think much of him...

945
01:42:23,717 --> 01:42:26,762
Well, we eloped

946
01:42:26,929 --> 01:42:31,892
without saying a word to anyone.

947
01:42:33,227 --> 01:42:35,729
When did he give you
your first kiss?

948
01:42:36,563 --> 01:42:38,899
What kind of a question is that?

949
01:42:40,401 --> 01:42:42,820
I don't even know whether
there was one.

950
01:42:44,071 --> 01:42:47,908
The first time, he raised his hat,
and that's all.

951
01:42:49,159 --> 01:42:51,745
It was the most one could do
in those days.

952
01:42:51,912 --> 01:42:56,667
It's not like now,
when all kinds of things go on.

953
01:42:57,376 --> 01:43:01,547
But I never manage anything.
- Stay covered, you're all sweaty.

954
01:43:01,755 --> 01:43:04,883
What do you mean "manage,"
and you still in short pants?

955
01:43:05,092 --> 01:43:08,887
Well, get me some long ones then,
like the other kids!

956
01:43:09,054 --> 01:43:11,140
What others? Gina!

957
01:43:12,349 --> 01:43:15,144
She told me I wasn't to send
any more love letters.

958
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:19,064
Go and ask the doctor
to come as soon as he can.

959
01:43:19,898 --> 01:43:22,901
Get him to examine you
at the same time.

960
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:24,236
Run along...

961
01:43:27,448 --> 01:43:31,243
But I'll send letters
just when I like.

962
01:43:35,914 --> 01:43:39,460
In Africa! I'll become
a doctor and go to Africa!

963
01:43:40,085 --> 01:43:41,754
That'll teach her!

964
01:43:55,851 --> 01:43:57,895
It's snowing outside!

965
01:44:07,988 --> 01:44:09,865
It's true, it's snowing!

966
01:44:12,576 --> 01:44:14,453
Professor Fighetta, up yours!

967
01:44:15,704 --> 01:44:18,415
If it goes on like this, there'll
be no school for a few days.

968
01:44:18,916 --> 01:44:21,502
The mountains are all white.

969
01:44:21,668 --> 01:44:24,254
Let's go and see the snow
on the sea.

970
01:44:24,671 --> 01:44:26,882
It's wet, it won't stick.

971
01:44:36,892 --> 01:44:39,478
Go away!
Get the hell out of the way!

972
01:45:04,628 --> 01:45:07,840
Stop there! The sparrows!

973
01:45:32,906 --> 01:45:34,700
Wait, I'll come with you.

974
01:45:49,089 --> 01:45:51,258
Titta! Look how it's coming down!

975
01:45:55,512 --> 01:45:56,513
Let's open the window.

976
01:45:58,557 --> 01:45:59,767
Lovely!

977
01:46:04,605 --> 01:46:05,981
Me too!

978
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:14,740
It's still snowing! Four days
this goddamn stuff's been around!

979
01:46:23,457 --> 01:46:26,001
This will go down as
the Year of the Big Snow.

980
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:28,879
Since the last Ice Age,

981
01:46:29,129 --> 01:46:33,509
it never snowed so heavily
in our town.

982
01:46:38,806 --> 01:46:41,600
That must've been a boy,
not the other person.

983
01:46:42,267 --> 01:46:45,854
As I was saying...
the exceptional years were

984
01:46:46,021 --> 01:46:49,024
1541... 1694...

985
01:46:49,191 --> 01:46:52,695
1728... 1888...

986
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:57,074
when oddly enough,
it snowed on July 13th.

987
01:47:44,329 --> 01:47:45,497
Where's she?

988
01:47:54,757 --> 01:47:58,802
How's your mother?
- Better now.

989
01:48:00,054 --> 01:48:03,099
She's still in hospital,
but she's off the critical list.

990
01:48:03,558 --> 01:48:07,645
That's good, poor woman.
Give her my regards.

991
01:48:08,521 --> 01:48:10,482
Your mother's a kind lady.

992
01:48:10,690 --> 01:48:13,276
She always gave me soup

993
01:48:13,443 --> 01:48:18,156
and wine. She's good...

994
01:48:53,691 --> 01:48:54,901
How are you feeling?

995
01:48:56,569 --> 01:48:59,364
I've brought you some flowers.
- Thank you. How are you?

996
01:49:01,074 --> 01:49:04,536
Hello, Aurelio. They're lovely!

997
01:49:05,578 --> 01:49:08,540
I was just looking out,
now I'll go back to bed.

998
01:49:09,457 --> 01:49:13,044
But I'm feeling better today.
What lovely colors!

999
01:49:13,962 --> 01:49:15,714
Are you hot, with this?

1000
01:49:16,381 --> 01:49:18,883
Have you eaten?
- Yes.

1001
01:49:36,234 --> 01:49:41,114
Are you still annoying your father?
- He whips so hard!

1002
01:49:41,823 --> 01:49:43,825
I'll finish up, stupid!

1003
01:49:54,544 --> 01:49:57,797
There's a nice garden here,
I didn't know.

1004
01:49:58,923 --> 01:50:01,509
It looks as though it's in bloom,
with the snow.

1005
01:50:01,676 --> 01:50:03,261
It's still snowing.

1006
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:11,311
In one way you're lucky to be here
warm in bed, with this weather.

1007
01:50:13,521 --> 01:50:17,609
He's tired, poor man,
when he gets home.

1008
01:50:17,776 --> 01:50:20,737
You shouldn't answer back,
you're a grown up now.

1009
01:50:22,989 --> 01:50:26,076
Don't throw ice! It hurts!

1010
01:50:30,497 --> 01:50:34,042
Wind and rain, go home again.
I don't want to feel the pain.

1011
01:50:39,714 --> 01:50:41,341
Idiot! No!

1012
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:45,929
A quite difficult shot, Excellency!

1013
01:50:56,147 --> 01:50:58,066
No! Not at Gradisca! No!

1014
01:51:03,571 --> 01:51:05,532
Enough! I give up!

1015
01:51:06,366 --> 01:51:09,327
If you break my windows,
I'll break your skull!

1016
01:51:17,877 --> 01:51:18,878
Who is it?

1017
01:51:26,052 --> 01:51:27,345
What is it?

1018
01:51:35,937 --> 01:51:38,565
Look, it's the Count peacock!

1019
01:51:41,443 --> 01:51:44,571
There it is!
It's coming down!

1020
01:51:53,288 --> 01:51:54,914
Shall we catch it, boys?

1021
01:52:11,181 --> 01:52:14,434
I don't understand.
What's happened?

1022
01:52:14,642 --> 01:52:17,062
I'll tell you in the car, Uncle.

1023
01:52:17,562 --> 01:52:19,981
Why in the car?
Where're we going?

1024
01:52:20,523 --> 01:52:23,234
Quite near. To Aunt Zaira's farm.

1025
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:26,488
A relative's come from America
and wants to say hello to you.

1026
01:52:27,572 --> 01:52:30,992
Well, why doesn't he
come here, then?

1027
01:52:31,368 --> 01:52:33,119
Who is this relative?

1028
01:53:01,064 --> 01:53:02,607
My aunt is dead.

1029
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:10,407
Bear up.

1030
01:53:17,122 --> 01:53:22,752
No, don't do that...
Open up!

1031
01:53:26,089 --> 01:53:27,549
No, I won't!

1032
01:53:54,451 --> 01:53:56,870
Lallo! He's fainted.

1033
01:53:57,203 --> 01:53:58,997
Dad, Uncle's feeling poorly.

1034
01:54:03,334 --> 01:54:05,628
Take him to the whorehouse, then!

1035
01:54:09,883 --> 01:54:11,468
Make the sign of the cross.

1036
01:54:34,532 --> 01:54:36,242
How do you feel now?
- Better!

1037
01:54:39,371 --> 01:54:42,374
Don't take it so hard...
be strong!

1038
01:55:11,069 --> 01:55:14,030
Now everybody in line.
Where're the orphans?

1039
01:56:23,141 --> 01:56:24,893
Stop that!

1040
01:57:58,028 --> 01:58:00,196
Hurray for the bride and groom!

1041
01:58:02,991 --> 01:58:04,451
Give me your arm, Naso.

1042
01:58:06,077 --> 01:58:09,539
Make way, make way,
my breasts are full of milk!

1043
01:58:11,624 --> 01:58:17,088
I raise my glass
to the newly weds and say...

1044
01:58:18,423 --> 01:58:20,633
May bride and groom find
marriage glowing in Battipaglia.

1045
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:23,845
When you're drunk,
you can even rhyme!

1046
01:58:29,142 --> 01:58:32,103
Gradisca's getting married
and going away!

1047
01:58:34,105 --> 01:58:38,276
We're sorry if we made you angry,
and we hate to see you go!

1048
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:43,239
You'll miss us badly!

1049
01:58:48,745 --> 01:58:51,206
Silence is golden,
but words are silver.

1050
01:58:51,414 --> 01:58:54,084
May this married couple live
happily ever after!

1051
01:58:55,001 --> 01:58:56,461
Where's the bride?

1052
01:58:57,587 --> 01:59:01,883
Our Gradisca is going away because
she's found her Gary Cooper.

1053
01:59:02,509 --> 01:59:05,970
It's true that Gary's cowboy,
while Matteo is a carabiniere

1054
01:59:06,137 --> 01:59:09,766
but love's always love.
Good luck, Gradisca!

1055
01:59:10,892 --> 01:59:13,436
Long live the bride and groom!

1056
01:59:13,645 --> 01:59:16,314
You have crowned
your dream of love.

1057
01:59:16,856 --> 01:59:19,984
Now it's your duty
to have many children.

1058
01:59:21,986 --> 01:59:24,948
For your family, for the church
and for your country!

1059
01:59:27,992 --> 01:59:32,205
Now we're all together...
one more toast before we leave.

1060
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:37,085
Photograph! Photograph!

1061
01:59:37,252 --> 01:59:39,754
Now we'll take the photograph.

1062
01:59:40,463 --> 01:59:42,090
A mirror!

1063
01:59:44,008 --> 01:59:45,760
Everybody get behind the bride!

1064
01:59:47,011 --> 01:59:50,306
She's lovely, our Ninola!
- Why're you crying?

1065
01:59:50,473 --> 01:59:53,393
I'm not, now.
- Get closer together.

1066
01:59:53,518 --> 01:59:55,520
The carabiniere
must move back a little.

1067
01:59:57,397 --> 01:59:58,773
Stand in the light.

1068
01:59:59,357 --> 02:00:01,651
Hold it!
It's raining.

1069
02:00:02,652 --> 02:00:08,116
Smile.
- O.K., O.K. Another one.

1070
02:00:09,534 --> 02:00:13,163
Don't fall all over us,
you drunken lout! -Gangway!

1071
02:00:15,749 --> 02:00:19,335
Let's move into the sun, the bride
in the center. Ready for a photo?

1072
02:00:26,885 --> 02:00:29,262
I've made up another rhyme
that goes like this.

1073
02:00:30,138 --> 02:00:33,391
Though the world may be full
of beautiful things

1074
02:00:33,558 --> 02:00:38,354
Full of towns that are attractive,
even more than here,

1075
02:00:38,521 --> 02:00:42,233
A drop of water'll be good
for you... you'll get a bath.

1076
02:00:42,567 --> 02:00:43,860
Get up!

1077
02:00:44,402 --> 02:00:48,406
It's stopped raining, sit down.
Play!

1078
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:51,659
A wet bride is a lucky bride!

1079
02:00:56,915 --> 02:00:58,541
Viva I'Italia!

1080
02:01:06,216 --> 02:01:11,388
How will you live,
so far away from here?

1081
02:01:13,598 --> 02:01:16,393
Good-bye to you all!
Go home!

1082
02:01:18,144 --> 02:01:20,230
Biscein bids you good-bye!

1083
02:01:31,116 --> 02:01:33,076
Naso, I'm going home!

1084
02:01:35,412 --> 02:01:38,164
Wait for me, I'll come with you!

1085
02:02:02,605 --> 02:02:03,732
My bouquet! Wait!

1086
02:02:05,066 --> 02:02:08,528
Good-bye! I love you all!

1087
02:02:11,156 --> 02:02:14,617
Gradisca's going!
- She's leaving!

1088
02:02:21,833 --> 02:02:25,336
Good-bye, Gradisca!

1089
02:02:49,152 --> 02:02:50,820
The puffballs!

1090
02:03:01,081 --> 02:03:02,374
Where's Titta?

1091
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:05,210
Shall we go fishing in the harbor?

1092
02:03:09,881 --> 02:03:11,758
Titta's went away some time ago.
