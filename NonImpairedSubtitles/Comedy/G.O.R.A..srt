1
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,029
Commander Logar,
they're speaking English.

2
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,038
Can we have it in Turkish
from the start?

3
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,036
Sure thing!

4
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,799
I'd believe it if it were possible
however, this is no good.

5
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,468
What's no good, man?

6
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,558
Look dear, I've been a publisher
for 12 years now.

7
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,512
I've never seen
such a nonsense.

8
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,633
Are you listening?

9
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,310
Forget about publishing, this
is a UFO, something I've witnessed.

10
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,670
I've seen this, shouldn't
I have taken a picture?

11
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,000
Besides, I have a friend who made love
to an alien, I'll bring him to you.

12
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,796
Bring him, the other one too.
We'll create some synergy here.

13
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,877
- But these are fake.
- Hake?

14
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,435
Fake man fake... Phony.

15
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,234
It says here Kütahya Porcelain.
Look.

16
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,437
Well, I shot this in Kütahya.
There's nothing wrong with it.

17
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,875
Idiot. Why are you
using a magnifier?

18
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,231
I've been on the road
for ten hours.

19
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,839
Which way are you going, son?

20
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,828
Hah! Just what I needed!
I'm going a long way pops. Move on.

21
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,196
- Give me a lift to...
- To where?

22
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,709
- Aren't you going this way?
- Alright, hop in.

23
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,755
Close the door...

24
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,230
- What's in the can?
- Pickles.

25
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,557
Let me turn it like this so it won't
fly away. It's a cabrio after all.

26
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,833
You're well informed.

27
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,397
Would you mind
if I played some music?

28
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,238
- What kind of music?
- What?

29
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,193
- What kind of music?
- You are something...

30
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,194
I don't like foreign music. They might be
swearing at my mom. How shall I know?

31
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,597
- How old is your mother?
- My mom is alive and healthy at 93.

32
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,759
Fine. This band is very young, so they
wouldn't know your mother, don't worry.

33
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,830
Oh boy! Look at that view!

34
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,510
- Get out!
- What's up son? I hope nothing's wrong.

35
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,557
Get out. Stop talking.

36
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,428
Move.

37
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,229
Turn towards me.

38
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,552
Raise your arm.
We're gonna lose the light.

39
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,477
You talk too much.
Do something useful for a change.

40
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,035
- Shall I turn it like this?
- No, just hold your arm straight!

41
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,119
Innocent villager sees a UFO.
You're the man!

42
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,311
Our esteemed
Japanese guests...

43
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,989
...this is a really
historical place. Translate.

44
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,198
Yes, but...

45
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,192
Please, these are very sensitive,
newly painted.

46
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,315
What's he saying?

47
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,830
He wants you to
talk about the pictures.

48
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,799
What's there to talk about?
They're pictures after all.

49
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,237
Let's lead them
to my carpet shop.

50
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,195
What's he saying?

51
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,913
My group is getting annoyed.

52
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,236
- Well, don't translate everything.
- How could I possibly not?

53
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,677
Translate this then: Apple pie and tart
make me fart hard.

54
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,270
You are really
killing tourism!

55
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,115
Cut it short.

56
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,471
Now we're going straight
to my shop.

57
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,633
We'll have a look at the carpets.
My shop is right nearby.

58
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,199
We'll get out...

59
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,918
Chill out, man!

60
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,436
Tourist or not,
I'll smack you one on the eye.

61
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,318
What's this talk
you rude bastard!

62
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,790
Lay down and I'll
show you what's really rude.

63
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,598
Dumb ass!

64
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,751
Don't make me go
Ninja on you!

65
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,158
Don't make me go
Ninja on you!

66
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,198
What's this, are you acting up?
You clown, come on.

67
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,110
Stop hitting! Give me my glasses.

68
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,756
You'll achieve nothing by yelling
in Japanese. Bastards!

69
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,194
They make videos at home
and come over...

70
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,392
...to tour the country! Bastards!
And then we'll have a tourism boom.

71
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,278
That's some boom!

72
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,079
Arif.

73
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,591
Treasury officials asked for you.
What's up?

74
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,475
I was to receive a commendation from
the ministry. Are they gone?

75
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,148
Yeah. Hold on a minute.

76
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,958
Look at this stuff. How is it?

77
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,877
This should be painted in grey.
There's no name on it, right?

78
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,673
- No.
- Boss?

79
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,711
English customers
are asking for you.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,639
Good. Come over some time,
we'll create some synergy.

81
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,911
- What synergy, dude?
- Boss, the English...

82
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,879
Has Prince Charles popped up?
What's the big deal?

83
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,751
Well, of course!

84
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,950
Order tea.
Don't stare like an ox.

85
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,952
Fuck it, order anyway.

86
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,758
This one's crappy.

87
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,991
What are you going to say about this?

88
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,228
Don't ask the chick.
Why are you asking her?

89
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,269
Lady?

90
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,149
Nuri!

91
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,709
Look.

92
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,159
This carpet here...

93
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,716
...has an authentic design
and is very valuable.

94
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,514
This pattern is called "Hand
on the waist". Trust me on this...

95
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,716
...the kid who wove this
went blind.

96
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,912
The price is $5000,
including surgery.

97
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,239
What did you give me to drink?

98
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,596
Arif Isik. December, 8th, 1968.

99
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,593
You have been abducted by
the Goran Military lmport Unit.

100
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,513
- Excuse me?
- Go on.

101
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,593
From now on you are
property of the Goran Union.

102
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,798
- Transportal initiative transport...
- What are you talking about, lady?

103
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,595
My dear Earthling, I think you
don't get it. You've been abducted!

104
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,235
Get out of here man.
The outfit is fine...

105
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,034
...but we did these jokes
when we were kids.

106
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,953
Nice idea, nice location
but you can't fool me.

107
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,795
- What's going on, Cheeba?
- Unbelievable. I guess he's in shock.

108
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,037
Really? Are the force shields active?

109
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,073
Sure they are.
You don't give up, do you?

110
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,190
He'll recover in the cell.
Take him away.

111
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,431
Dude, listen! Don't get on my nerves.

112
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,229
It's no good with lights and all.
Are you going to buy the rug or not?

113
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,590
Plackumates, take him to his cell.

114
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,195
Bugger off! Tufan, is that you, dog?
Take off your glasses!

115
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,799
Take him away!

116
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,079
What was the technique?

117
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,356
Put a little effort into it, man!

118
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,708
Step back!

119
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,796
- Calm down.
- Shut up!

120
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,355
You freaked out, ha?

121
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,309
What now?

122
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,709
Are you going to kill us
with a flashlight?

123
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,069
Flashlight?

124
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,315
Oh shit...

125
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,633
Get this trash out of here!

126
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,911
Don't let me see you fraternizing
with prisoners again.

127
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,559
Get back to work.

128
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,632
- Engage MFD drives.
- Engaged.

129
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,518
- Open the parallel port.
- Open.

130
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,278
- Is the joystick connected?
- Yes.

131
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,913
- Is targeting stabilized?
- Ready.

132
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,793
Lieutenant Zurka,
lower all shields.

133
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,873
Right away, sir.

134
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,833
What's going on there?

135
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,589
A Colombian
is causing trouble.

136
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,479
Why do you cause trouble
you worthless Earthling? Search him!

137
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,511
Powdered sugar, huh?

138
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,632
Get him out of here.
Send this to the kitchen.

139
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,231
Commander Logar,
the cargo is ready.

140
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,429
The numbers?

141
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,591
20 Americans, 5 of them black.

142
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,588
5 Japanese, one Colombian,
1 Danish, 3 Indian.

143
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,115
- Fine...
- And one Turk.

144
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,591
One day all Earthlings will work
under my command like dogs, Kuna.

145
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,319
We'll gather all of them.

146
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,755
Those days will come to pass, sir.
Commander Logar...

147
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,511
Why do you hate Earthlings
so much?

148
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,071
Why?! Why?!

149
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,399
This is a hatred, Kuna. A hatred
I may never be able to overcome.

150
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,719
Years ago, something which happened
to my grandfather Commander Kubar...

151
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,478
has affected me so greatly, that I can't
seem to shake my taste for vengeance.

152
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,473
Earthlings make me sick...

153
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,548
July 14th, 1789- AKSARAY

154
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,509
What we do to these uncivilized
monkeys can never be enough, Kuna.

155
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,155
Commander Logar.
An object is approaching.

156
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,554
Who are you?

157
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,352
Get out, out!

158
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,196
Come on, come on.
Get a signal.

159
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,715
You were supposed to have
coverage everywhere. Come on!

160
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,034
Hello?

161
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,870
Hello, Muhittin,
This is Arif.

162
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,469
Bring in everybody,
even the US President.

163
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,676
I've been abducted by aliens.

164
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,270
What? Yes, by them.

165
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,832
Stop that! Arif, cut the crap,
where are you? What are you doing?

166
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,749
Muhittin, this is not a joke.
Aliens, I said. I'm in a spaceship.

167
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,838
- What ship?
- Muhittin, speak up.

168
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,668
Go to the police, to the station.
Hello!

169
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,758
The signal is breaking up.
Call me back.

170
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,077
He must be drunk or what.

171
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,234
Hello, Muhittin, Muhittin.
It's no joke. I'm telling you, aliens!

172
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,558
Oh merciful and most gracious...

173
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,558
- Do not fear.
- You don't say!

174
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,919
My God, what kind of a test
are you putting me through?

175
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,237
Listen carefully.
The Force is inside you.

176
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,879
Don't lose control.
You'll get away and find me.

177
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,835
Who are you? I can't even tell
if you're a genie or a human.

178
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,669
Damn!

179
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,076
Damn!

180
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,955
Stop it. Listen,
you're the chosen one.

181
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,438
Find me when you land on Gora.
Got it?

182
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,310
Find me.

183
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,108
Daddyo, did you
run out of chosen ones?

184
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,749
- Who are you? What's going on?
- The signal is fading, find me.

185
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,991
The phone has no signal,
the dude has no signal.

186
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,317
What's a chosen one?
I left the shop unattended.

187
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,553
Arif, you shit for brains!

188
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,078
Prisoner, turn around.

189
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,880
Want me to lay down naked too?
What are you talking about, man?

190
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,157
Don't cause trouble, turn around.

191
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,594
OK!

192
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,957
Look, pal, I know
my way around.

193
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,709
You look like a nice person, take this,
there has been a misunderstanding...

194
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,912
...let's forget it.
I want good treatment.

195
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,675
I'm Arif. Take this and say,
"Mr Arif wants some olives...

196
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,913
...a loaf of bread, some cheese
and toilet paper.

197
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,032
Come on, take it!

198
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,389
Whoa! There are families who live
a whole month on that money!

199
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,189
Could you get at least
a charger for my mobile?

200
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,636
Yo, man in black!

201
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,549
Is the ship drifting
a little to the left, Kuna?

202
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,712
- Which ship, dude?
- Dude?

203
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,755
Commander Logar,
an object is approaching, Sir.

204
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,276
That's our planet, moron!
Who are you?

205
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,953
Get out, out!

206
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,676
I want a nice landing, Kuna.

207
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,829
Whoa!

208
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,508
- Prisoner, come with me.
- Out! Out!

209
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,069
Alright, I'm coming.
Get out. Please!

210
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,028
Listen, if you tell anyone
what you saw back there...

211
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,192
...we'll be on real bail terms. Got it?
That's a human urge.

212
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,914
Those bastards have abducted
the whole world.

213
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,470
The ship has landed.
Anyone stepping out of line...

214
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,473
...or over reacting
will be severely punished.

215
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,038
I don't speak German.

216
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,796
I don't speak German, OK?

217
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,389
He has stunned the guy.
It doesn't kill, it only stuns.

218
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,596
That's a stunner,
they've used it on me too.

219
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,795
Hello, hang up, I'll call you.
I can't talk right now.

220
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,075
- Get back in line!
- Don't get so anal about everything!

221
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,073
Get back in line here,
he's putting the blame on me!

222
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,673
Move on a little.

223
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,396
- Commander Logar.
- Superior Tocha.

224
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,755
Welcome.

225
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,675
My respects, Mulu.

226
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,154
Welcome.

227
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,991
You've gathered the whole world again.
Didn't you have enough slaves, Logar?

228
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,910
What happened to your face
Rendroy?

229
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,072
- What's with my face?
- That's what I mean. What?

230
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,034
Superior Tocha.

231
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,193
Allow me to present you some
presents I brought from the Earth.

232
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,555
Kuna!

233
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,315
This is yours, sir. Pish...

234
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,750
Pishmaniye. Cotton candy from zmit.

235
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,553
Here you are.

236
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,033
- Mulu.
- You're kind as usual, Logar.

237
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,197
Vunar, this is for you.

238
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,560
Enverina, we lost your
present on the ship.

239
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,438
We didn't notice.

240
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,636
And this is yours Rendroy,
it's supposed to bring fertility.

241
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,358
You're very kind, Logar. Keep this,
I have three from birth.

242
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,995
Your daughter Ceku
is not here to welcome me.

243
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,760
- Yes, she doesn't feel well.
- Really?

244
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,033
Let's go.

245
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,438
What time is it, pal?

246
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,511
That idiot, Superior Tocha
is 420 years old, Kuna.

247
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,155
He should give way
to the young.

248
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,273
Ceku didn't come to meet you,
she shows no interest, huh?

249
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,910
She's going to. Let's see
what she's done while we were away.

250
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,037
- Get me 216.
- Yes, sir.

251
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,994
Hi, brother.

252
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,109
Hello.

253
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,236
You two, come over.

254
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,708
Us?

255
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,038
Space has always been
the unknown to me.

256
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,678
The movies, science-fiction novels.
Arthur C. Clarke. Chariots of the Gods.

257
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,999
I can't believe I'm here.
Space Odyssey.

258
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,519
- Idiot.
- Idiot.

259
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,829
Next.

260
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,709
You've turned this place into a
government office. "Go here, no there."

261
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,391
Greetings,
shall I sit or stand?

262
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,513
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

263
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,792
I'll tell. We bought the goods
from Black Faik.

264
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,350
We reloaded the truck
in Karabük.

265
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,312
I was driving the truck
till Adana.

266
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,437
- What are you talking about?
- And you?!

267
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,596
You've abducted me,
you'll do the talking.

268
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,119
I'm confused anyway.

269
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,873
- Aggressive.
- Aggressive.

270
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,599
Yeah, aggressive.

271
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,233
Is that it?

272
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,873
Commander Logar?

273
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,315
216, come on, fill me in.

274
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,195
- She missed you a lot.
- Really? That much, huh?

275
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,114
Well, she kept on
saying your name.

276
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,389
Let me see.

277
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,033
Logar, you...!

278
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,151
Good.
Did she mention marriage?

279
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,755
I saw her preparing
her dowry.

280
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,997
- Is she in her room?
- Yes.

281
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,873
Great. Take this my boy. I brought it
for you from Earth, you'll be friends.

282
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,909
Thank you very much
Commander Logar.

283
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,955
I have the batteries. Come to me
when you want to play, alright?

284
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,437
Concentrate on your work now.

285
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,077
Is the beautiful Ceku
thinking about me?

286
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,794
No.

287
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,954
I've come a long way.
No welcome?

288
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,832
From slave gathering?

289
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,110
Yoga didn't do you any good,
you're tense.

290
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,595
I've brought you
a present from Earth.

291
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,353
Really? What is it?

292
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,312
World peace.

293
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,314
An authentic carpet, the kid who made
this went blind. A valuable piece.

294
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,197
I don't want any presents from you,
Logar, why don't you leave me alone?

295
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,072
Aren't you the most
beautiful girl on Gora?

296
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,918
- Because of my father?
- What?

297
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,352
- Will you please leave me alone?
- But the present...

298
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,232
I don't like carpets, Logar.

299
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,874
Don't insult me in front
of my troops.

300
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,556
It's highly decorative,
enjoy it.

301
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,398
Nice stuff,
I should get one too.

302
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,115
All prisoners should shower within
3 minutes and go to the dining hall.

303
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,318
I'm sure they'll give us
little pills instead of food.

304
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,874
You're drawing too much attention,
stop that.

305
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,557
- Do not fear.
- Dude, you're crossing the line here.

306
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,469
Brace yourself.
Don't go with the flow.

307
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,598
Find me. My name is Garavel.
Find me!

308
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,598
Goodness gracious.
Forgive my sins.

309
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,553
I almost got taken,
covered in soap.

310
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,434
I'm never picky when it comes to food.

311
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,752
Eat food, evade beating.
That's the motto. Pour it in.

312
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,152
Can I have more sauce?

313
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,396
That's your share. Move on.

314
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,275
Just a minute, weren't you
the man who distributed soap?

315
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,950
- Cut it short, move on.
- Are you Turkish, buddy?

316
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,039
Get moving.

317
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,591
Everybody speaks Turkish, I don't
understand who is a Turk and who's not.

318
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,797
Get a load of that pimp,
as if he's at the beach.

319
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,473
Hello.

320
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,868
God Almighty, save me from
this place before I kill someone.

321
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,513
Is this place taken?

322
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,752
We have to escape.

323
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,836
Together, what do you say?

324
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,795
I chose you
because you're different.

325
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,392
First of all, you're Japanese,
you're smart.

326
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,959
If we combine our efforts
we can make it back to Earth.

327
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,833
- What do you say, Samurai?
- Samurai?

328
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,959
- Yes.
- Our efforts?

329
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,953
- Don't let on.
- Together?

330
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,992
Combined.

331
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,517
Our efforts?

332
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,189
Cut it short. Let's get to know
each other, I'm Arif.

333
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,036
And I'm Mehmet, from Zeytinburnu.

334
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,555
I work in a leather factory
in Kazlçesme.

335
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,792
Leather jackets or shoes and such?

336
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,149
Thanks.

337
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,239
From there.

338
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,399
From there.

339
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,039
Step aside.

340
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,034
Is this rose for me?

341
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,349
Yes, dear.

342
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,557
What's your point in sending this?

343
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,076
To get close and nice.
To socialize.

344
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,670
You mean to create a synergy
against the aliens?

345
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,832
Don't get mad,
come over here. Sit.

346
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,914
You are something.
A real Cosby Show!

347
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,710
Americans have a saying,
do you know it?

348
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,909
What's that?

349
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,754
Shut up,
stop being a jerk!

350
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,190
Smarten up,
act like Earthlings!

351
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,317
Be worthy of our planet!

352
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,593
Low class jerks! Let me go,
don't stress me out man!

353
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,398
- Superior Tocha.
- Welcome, Logar.

354
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,956
You can't possibly know
how I envy you.

355
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,830
You're like my own children,
you'll lead Gora into better days.

356
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,469
Thanks.

357
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,879
I've grown old. I intend to marry
my daughter to a young Goran...

358
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,796
...and transfer all my authority
to him. What do you think?

359
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,556
A classical
but perfect idea, Sir.

360
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,438
I wanted to talk to you
about this matter.

361
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,794
For Gora's future I have Vumar's
son Timar in mind. How's that?

362
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,157
- Vumar's son Timar?
- But, Sir...

363
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,237
Vumar's son Timar is...

364
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,029
God knows what they
say about me.

365
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,356
I put forward myself
for this noble duty.

366
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,353
- Your daughter and I are in love.
- She's burning with love.

367
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,637
- She never mentioned anything.
- That she's burning?

368
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,473
I wanted you to hear it from me. I'd be
honored to be your son-in-law.

369
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,798
I don't believe in love, Logar.

370
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,470
Vumar's son Timar is a great
hero for the Gorans.

371
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,678
I rather entrust Gora's future...

372
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,036
...to a hero, instead of a lover.

373
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,990
Really?

374
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,316
- Commander Logar!
- Yes, my dear.

375
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,830
- An object is closing in, Sir.
- Who's this?

376
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,038
Excuse me. Who are you?

377
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,311
Get out! Out! Out!

378
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,388
Out...

379
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,591
See you later, Superior Tocha.

380
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,233
Good bye.

381
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,393
Arif, buddy?

382
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,470
Yes?

383
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,836
We did you wrong today. Forgive us.

384
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,950
It's alright, forget it.

385
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,078
We're in space, everybody is confused.
It's not a big deal.

386
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,756
- Is everything fine now?
- Sure, man.

387
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,596
You do that guy one more wrong
and you'll get a feel of this.

388
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,557
You are really a phenomenon,
always up to something.

389
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,634
Was this your bed?
Sorry, pal.

390
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,151
Sit down. Here, you
left these in the examination room.

391
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,797
I really appreciate it.

392
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,313
Let's get acquainted.

393
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,838
Arif Isik. All sorts of
carpets, kilim, travel.

394
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,631
- Here.
- Fine. I'm Bob Marley Faruk.

395
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,237
- Are you Turkish, Bob Marley?
- Yes.

396
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,198
Great. Have one.

397
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,678
- I don't smoke.
- Really?

398
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,199
- Can you give me that one there?
- This one?

399
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,438
- Here.
- Thanks.

400
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,833
- How long have you been here, Bob?
- 8 years.

401
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,714
Holy sh... what was that?

402
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,999
I'm sorry.

403
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,509
8 years? I wouldn't stay
here 8 minutes.

404
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,398
You've disappointed me.

405
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,555
I had a bar in Kusadas. There was
great music, reggae.

406
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,791
- But it didn't fly?
- Nope.

407
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,071
I was in debt up to my ears.

408
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,995
The creditors came to kill me.
So I tied a rock on my neck.

409
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,549
I was about to jump from the jetty...

410
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,228
...and bang, I was in a spaceship.

411
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,115
Then a completely different world,
would you return?

412
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,789
Well...

413
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,432
Let's suppose I did return.
The creditors arrive:

414
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,958
"Where have you been Bob?"

415
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,835
"I was abducted by aliens and
so on." Would they buy it?

416
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,639
- They wouldn't.
- Nope.

417
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,916
Then there's the media.

418
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,839
You're making the headlines each day,
'The Man Abducted by Aliens"

419
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,789
- This seems to rub you wrong.
- You got that right.

420
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,917
I have nothing against space
but the attitude is wrong.

421
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,033
You expect something more civilized
when you think of aliens.

422
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,435
- You're a prisoner here
- So?

423
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,114
Don't make me mad.
You're a prisoner. I'm comfortable.

424
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,311
That's because I work in the kitchen.

425
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,830
If I were in the quarries...
They work you to death there.

426
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,191
They implant a chip and
you walk around like a monkey.

427
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,518
What's this man, quarry, chips...?
Is this being alien or human?

428
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,075
If you'd like I can get you
a work in the kitchen too?

429
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,748
What kitchen, pal? Is there no way
out of here?

430
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,437
- You have to find a ship.
- Easy. What's a space ship, anyway?

431
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,114
Alright, calm down, have patience.

432
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,796
These are the final finishes.
It's finished, here.

433
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,114
- Is this some kind of a joke?
- Of course it is.

434
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,588
I mean it's impossible
to get away.

435
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,111
Quit saying that.
There's gotta be a way.

436
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,478
Excuse me Bob but you seem to be
a little oblivious to sci-fi.

437
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,957
I'm oblivious to sci-fi?
I'm oblivious, huh?

438
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,552
You don't know who you're talking to,
so you talk nonsense.

439
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,438
What's your point?

440
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,670
I was the first Turk
to write a science fiction scenario.

441
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,433
You said you had a bar.

442
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,669
That was after
I got fed up with the movie business.

443
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,036
So you got fed up with the movies?

444
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,238
It was years ago.

445
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,079
In the last days
of the sex movies.

446
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,279
I was looking for
something new in movies.

447
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,709
- September 12th, 1980
- No, sir, impossible.

448
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,635
My name is Ersan Kuneri,
I'm no porno producer.

449
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,799
I said they'll make love in underwear.
Of course.

450
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,557
The cook, the servant, the gardener. All
of them. It takes place at a mansion.

451
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,429
The cook does the gardener, the
gardener the driver, the driver, servant.

452
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,311
Yes, get it printed,
I'll send a poster immediately.

453
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,552
The title is
"Group Discount".

454
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,799
Stand straight,

455
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,718
Raise your chin.

456
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,790
Good.

457
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,196
Yes.

458
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,314
This, this, this.

459
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,871
Who are you?
Get out, out!

460
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,634
Be yourself,
don't imitate anyone!

461
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,677
Mr Ersan.
Should Faruk come in?

462
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,433
Keep him waiting.
Wait a second.

463
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,875
This, this.
Do you have blue underwear?

464
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,230
- Yes.
- Write down, brings his own underwear.

465
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,950
You, from Tophane, I want you to
make love like an animal, not human.

466
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,798
- Like a beast!
- Always.

467
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,191
Alright then, the movie's name is,
"Jackhammer." Beat it.

468
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,879
Send Faruk in.

469
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,159
Mr Faruk.

470
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,798
Hi, Mr Ersan.

471
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,355
I see a tank outside.
Was there a parade today?

472
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,074
Nothing important.
I have great ideas.

473
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,794
A fresh approach in movies,
science fiction. What do you say?

474
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,559
Science? Give me that.

475
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,519
Americans are into this thing,
there's lot of money in this.

476
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,795
Any sex?

477
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,116
No, it's about a robot's
adventures.

478
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,437
The title is "6 Million Dollar Man."
How's that?

479
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,876
6 million?
Do you want to ruin me?

480
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,957
Foreign currency
is prohibited.

481
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,758
We could change the title.

482
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,713
- Like?
- Lunar Lust. How's that?

483
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,876
It can't be on the moon.
We have to shoot in one week.

484
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,476
We'll do it. A robot falls in love
with an astronaut.

485
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,792
Nice...
Lunar Lust. Nice.

486
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,833
Could I have an advance,
I'll scout for a location.

487
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,150
Let's celebrate this.
I have Kent, Marlboro.

488
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,192
Mr Ersan,
the police is here.

489
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,119
They want to entertain you
for possessing foreign cigarettes.

490
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,311
That's not entertain,
that's detain. Let's go.

491
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,118
There's no escape from law.

492
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,995
Ersan... The film.
Science-fiction. What now?

493
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,557
That film is not going to happen.

494
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,873
Let's go to bed now. Don't ever
mention science-fiction to me again.

495
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,870
Thanks. They bring me
everything from Earth.

496
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,190
Hey, whoa! Slice it carefully!

497
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,910
These guys have chips,
half of their brain is gone.

498
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,550
Hand it over,
let me do that.

499
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,233
Come on, you've wasted it.

500
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,913
But the guys are okay.

501
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,596
So it seems. You have it nice going
here but please think about...

502
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,950
...this escape business.

503
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,715
Cut the crap and let me
tell you how to escape.

504
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,154
Yeah.

505
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,193
First try the ventilation shafts
from the kitchen.

506
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,353
- Ventilation?
- Yes.

507
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,159
Did you all run away too?

508
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,676
Whoa, don't cut in here.
So you think you're smart, huh?

509
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,429
Why smart, man?
I came to get food.

510
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,269
And there's another thing,
that could do.

511
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,078
What's it? Tell me?

512
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,075
Close it.

513
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,234
Close it.

514
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,872
You are way too curious.
I'm out of here.

515
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,271
Can we flee
right through there, buddy?

516
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,231
Why do you take off the helmet?

517
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,154
If that doesn't work, there's
molecular transportation.

518
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,358
- No wonder. What's that?
- Beaming, you know.

519
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,837
Do I know? If there's beaming
I'll be directly at home.

520
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,711
Beaming is a risky business, you have
to enter the exact coordinates.

521
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,480
I'm willing to risk it.
I have to get out of here.

522
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,917
It's impossible to flee.
You don't get it, do you?

523
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,348
Sorry, Bob but...

524
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,598
...you call yourself Bob Marley but have
no hint about the philosophy behind it.

525
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,757
Just wearing that cap is not enough.

526
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,632
And what is
that philosophy?

527
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,631
Get me a stick
and a piece of cloth.

528
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,072
I'll show you beaming...

529
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,440
You'll see... You know
nothing about Arif yet.

530
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,074
Don't lose hope.
The Force is inside you.

531
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,950
Yeah, right! Inside. Just appear
in light, no help at all.

532
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,958
Just show off, bastard!

533
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,310
I'll show you all,
you bastards...

534
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,350
Beaming, yeah? Beaming.
There we are.

535
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,918
What are you doing here?

536
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,076
I don't have bucket, if I had one
I could do something.

537
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,474
What do you mean?

538
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,148
Commander Logar instructed me
to clean this place.

539
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,918
Move!

540
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,628
Why then? You've turned
the planet into a shithole.

541
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,149
Behave like women for a change
and clean this place.

542
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,513
What are you doing here?

543
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,399
Ma'am, I beg you, just let me
wipe off the dust of the beaming room.

544
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,669
Move.

545
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,316
Some guy came and said "The prisoner
shall wipe the dust of that place."

546
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,557
I swear. He said "No beaming,
only dust."

547
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,270
Don't squeeze my arm.
He only said cleaning.

548
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,032
Damn you all...

549
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,555
To hell with such a beaming...

550
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,394
Leave me alone!

551
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,198
Oh, I'm exhausted. Sometimes
I forget that you're a robot.

552
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,670
Come on, I'm useless as a robot now.

553
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,072
I go wild when I'm with you,
otherwise I have direct robot logic.

554
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,679
The music was fantastic.

555
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,230
Wasn't it? I've downloaded
3000 of them from the Internet.

556
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,875
Look, what I have.

557
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,278
Oh, I don't believe it. A Turkish movie
where the girl goes blind.

558
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,675
No, in this movie the boy goes blind.

559
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,032
Why don't they use microlaser on the
girl's cornea, in that movie?

560
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,196
Come on Ceku,
is that the way to watch movies?

561
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,116
Just look at the emotions. The sacrifice
of the boy, his kiss in the final scene.

562
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,958
Let's play "Kiss like the Earthlings".

563
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,639
No, my circuits
still waggle from the dance.

564
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,432
Come on, please.

565
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,868
Okay, okay.

566
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,154
- The Earthlings are fun, aren't they?
- With their music, dance and everything.

567
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,468
- Will you tell my fortune?
- Is it cold now?

568
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,755
Move a little.

569
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,197
- You know I don't do this for everyone.
- I know.

570
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,197
- Promise in God's name.
- Come on.

571
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,916
Let's see. There's someone.

572
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,190
- Really?
- Oh, that's me.

573
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,837
- Come on, tell something.
- Be quiet.

574
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,157
Look, in the near future.
Do you see, all in black.

575
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,080
With long hair.
Could that be Logar?

576
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,840
- Yuck! In my fortune?
- I see a wedding.

577
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,633
There's someone else. He's
a little chubby, very straight words.

578
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,355
He has lots of people around him.
He will do you a favor.

579
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,711
Don't forget, the letter R is in his
name or surname. Don't forget.

580
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,478
Rinse this out.

581
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,477
He asked about you the minute
he arrived.

582
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,874
What did you say?

583
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,640
I talked very directly. I said
"You have other things on your mind."

584
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,230
"Don't push her." I said. "She's not
willing, so why do you push her?"

585
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,035
"Nothing good comes from force,
it will cause bigger problems...

586
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,708
...in the future." I said.
But he wouldn't listen.

587
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,552
Are you an oracle?

588
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,753
Commander Logar?

589
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,715
Commander Logar,
I was only joking.

590
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,076
Take this battery powered
doll away.

591
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,316
Put him together with
those dogs from Earth.

592
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,516
You scum, he was my best friend.

593
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,070
You force me to be evil,
do you understand?

594
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,710
I love you, I'm jealous of you.
Be it a robot or even my father.

595
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,194
So, you love me?

596
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,595
I want this,
can you do it?

597
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,389
216!

598
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,716
Disgusting Earth
customs.

599
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,155
The prisoners to be implanted
a chip today are:

600
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,434
Jack Bailey.

601
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,958
Chris Lover.

602
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,796
Guenter Westinghouse.

603
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,991
José Gabriel Estevez.

604
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,037
Will U. Marry Mee.

605
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,191
Akimi Noname.

606
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,512
The Japanese guy is gone too.

607
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,796
I see no rebellion here.

608
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,315
We won't get anywhere
just with my resistance.

609
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,391
- Black won't move there.
- Really?!

610
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,431
But you moved
the white bishop here...

611
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,716
Now start with black-white
in front of this guy.

612
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,516
Give me 5, Julio. Let's start again,
that paging has confused me.

613
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,277
I'm confused.
If only we had a camera.

614
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,637
I'd take pictures of this place.
Would be a super document on Earth.

615
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,638
Let me go, man!

616
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,758
There's another one.
Welcome to the circus.

617
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,559
Get a load of that guy.

618
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,792
Don't leave me here,
don't leave me with them!

619
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,117
Don't cry,
we experienced the same.

620
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,755
Don't shout, you're drawing
too much attention.

621
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,791
He's a robot.

622
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,716
Take him with you to the kitchen,
he'll make a nice kitchen robot.

623
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,799
Don't cause trouble.
He's a robot, an android.

624
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,436
Really? Hi, Robot.

625
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,630
Hi.

626
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,114
Are you a robot?

627
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,309
Yes.

628
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,914
So, what are you doing here?

629
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,872
Commander Logar has punished me.

630
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,350
Commander Logar?
I'm going to kick his butt.

631
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,438
Here, have one.
What's your name?

632
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,676
216.

633
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,791
216? What's that?

634
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,234
Updated model of 215. 2. Generation,
16th segment, improvable intelligence.

635
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,751
And high mobility,
7 hours audio and video recording.

636
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,909
Audio recording? Does that mean
that you can receive from anywhere?

637
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,077
What kind of a talk is that?

638
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,430
Well, what else should I ask a robot?

639
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,753
Would you like a drink?
Are you hungry?

640
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,113
Such a pity...
He's a prisoner, like us.

641
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,954
A robot, but still miserable.
Does this thing come out?

642
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,713
I'm totally detachable.

643
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,269
Really? That's sad, man.

644
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,955
Hey, folks. Why don't you
say welcome? The guy's crying.

645
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,679
- Welcome, pal.
- Welcome.

646
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,076
Maybe he's programmed to cry.

647
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,231
This is so sad, look at him.

648
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,034
I'm Faruk, Bob Marley Faruk.

649
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,150
Hi.

650
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,470
Can you shoot pictures
as well?

651
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,999
Excuse me?

652
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,316
Never mind.
Say welcome, people.

653
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,752
Don't discriminate.
Robot or not, everyone's equal.

654
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,074
- Welcome. I'm Arif...
- Hi, 216.

655
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,996
Do I eat red meat?

656
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,958
I'm sorry, sir.

657
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,558
Why aren't you eating, Ceku?

658
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,994
I have no appetite.

659
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,390
I have some news
which will revive your appetite.

660
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,874
Logar is dead?

661
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,951
My funny daughter.

662
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,230
You'll marry Vumar's son Timar.

663
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,873
Vumar's son Timar?

664
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,470
Yes, Timar. Moreover,
Vumar's son Timar.

665
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,912
Logar said that you two
were in love but...

666
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,153
I don't love Logar, nor any other
Goran man.

667
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,311
I don't intend to marry.

668
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,637
We have a situation,
we have to meet immediately.

669
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,869
What happened?

670
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,998
It's very serious,
we should go to the big hall.

671
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,831
If it even comes close to our
planet, it could extinct life on Gora.

672
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,678
What's going on Superior Tocha?

673
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,275
A big danger, Logar... A fireball.

674
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,712
A fire shaped ball
or a ball shaped fire, right?

675
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,635
We decided to use
the sacred stones.

676
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,793
Do you approve
as the military wing?

677
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,470
Is there no other option? I think that
the stones should be the last resort.

678
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,999
We have no choice.

679
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,595
It's natural that I think different
cause I'm a soldier.

680
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,553
I know very well how to send that
fireball back to where it came from.

681
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,749
We don't doubt your courage, Logar
but we have to try the sacred stones.

682
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,598
You know better, sir.

683
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,959
Bring the sacred stones.

684
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,559
So be it.

685
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,596
The manual is missing.

686
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,789
How does that feel, huh?

687
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,679
How come?

688
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,315
I guess this is the end.

689
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,152
We're doomed.

690
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,431
I want full authority, Superior Tocha.

691
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,995
- What can you do?
- "What can you do?"

692
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,272
Give me one hour.

693
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,919
Logar, lo...

694
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,470
What are we going to do?
Shall I get the ship ready?

695
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,274
Pull yourself together! Which ship?
Be smart, come.

696
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,957
Are we going to sit and
watch the fireball get closer?

697
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,630
It's such a pity that the manual
to the sacred stones is missing.

698
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,150
Sure is, isn't it?

699
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,032
What are you doing, Logar?

700
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,958
What do you think, you idiot?

701
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,834
Do you believe that my dad
sent that fireball?

702
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,072
You are playing with fire.

703
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,197
Don't play word games with me,
jackass!

704
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,629
Jackass?

705
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,673
There's no other way to get attention
from that geezer Tocha and his girl.

706
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,638
I've set it up like a clock...

707
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,473
- You see this?
- Yes.

708
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,830
I'll stop the fireball with this.

709
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,719
And that old fart is going to give his
daughter to me. And Gora.

710
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,713
You're amazing, Logar.

711
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,399
Am I?

712
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,315
Notify that geezer
about our conditions immediately.

713
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,470
Yes, sir.

714
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,438
We don't have much time.

715
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,149
Logar, be careful with that shot.

716
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,873
Am I being a handful?

717
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,319
Ceku, I can't believe it's you!

718
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,636
Your prediction came true,
I'm getting married.

719
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,875
What?

720
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,034
With whom?

721
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,035
Everything's messed up. A fireball
is approaching Gora, 216.

722
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,880
This could be our last meeting.

723
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,992
My father made a deal with
Logar, if he can stop the fireball...

724
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,830
...l'll have to marry him.
Either way I'm dead.

725
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,999
Don't talk nonsense!

726
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,629
- I miss you, 216.
- Me too.

727
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,359
Visiting hours are over.

728
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,834
Please, don't be sad.

729
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,308
Don't forget me, 216.

730
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,959
Maybe he can't stop it.

731
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,357
"Maybe he can't stop it"?!

732
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,589
Turn that off. What's this crap?

733
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,233
Come on, brother.

734
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,989
- The guys are watching...
- Don't you feel no shame at all?

735
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,073
Arif, Bob, you're all gonna die.

736
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,510
We're not living anyway.
What happened?

737
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,188
Turn on the TV. A big fireball
is approaching Gora...

738
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,675
The planet could go up in smoke
in one hour.

739
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,270
- Let it burn. It's the Gorans' concern.
- We are on Gora, dude.

740
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,915
Yeah, right. Let's see what it is.

741
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,357
The approaching fireball
is 10.000 vedon in diameter...

742
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,160
...and can wipe Gora off
the celestial map.

743
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,915
The Goran Administrative Council stated
that the manual of the sacred stones...

744
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,429
...is missing and therefore
Commander Logar's...

745
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,632
...destruction system
will be used.

746
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,313
This is The Fifth Element...

747
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,432
Since the meteor shower
4000 years ago...

748
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,750
This is The Fifth Element.
Bruce Willis' movie.

749
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,951
There's this fireball
and he places the sacred stones...

750
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,709
That's it. Bruce Willis,
that short, bald fella...

751
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:49,596
The leaders of Gora and Commander
Logar are in the Sacred Chamber.

752
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,394
Dear Gorans!
I'm Commander Logar!

753
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,998
I'm always ready to sacrify my life
for Gora!

754
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,596
Due to a big misfortune
we can't use the sacred stones...

755
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,516
...but with this hyper optic vascular
freezer that my engineers prepared...

756
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,432
...I will save you
from this disaster...

757
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,676
Bullshit. First of all
there's no such gadget...

758
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,440
He just needs
to put the stones in their places.

759
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,988
Shut up Arif.

760
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,197
Hyper optic vascular freezer!

761
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,789
What?

762
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,918
We are all very tense
and sad.

763
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,517
Now I'll stop this damned fireball
and invite you all to my wedding.

764
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,717
- Watch out for your heads.
- He's just boasting.

765
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,473
For Gora!

766
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,232
Just shake it a little bit.

767
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,238
Logar, are you playing with us?

768
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,391
I'm doing the best I can, sir.

769
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,393
- Did you play with its batteries?
- Maybe it was left turned on?

770
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,352
Come on, come on.

771
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,152
He's not going to stop it.
Robot, I have an idea.

772
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,079
Can you take me there?

773
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,675
- Try the ventilation.
- I won't fall for that again!

774
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,717
Sacred Chamber.
Come with me.

775
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,191
Don't panic, don't panic.

776
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,957
Shame on you!

777
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,355
- Perhaps a part fell off?
- Which one?

778
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,154
If we turn it off and on again
it could get charged.

779
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,431
The fireball is coming, man!

780
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,990
So what?
Did my father send it?

781
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,797
- Take off your glasses.
- Here. So what?

782
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,198
- Commander Logar.
- Yes, dear.

783
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,954
- An object is approaching, sir.
- Who are you?

784
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,118
Get out! Out! Please, go!

785
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,479
Get out of my way, shorty!

786
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,354
Greetings, chiefs!

787
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,913
Who the hell are you?
Get him!

788
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,269
Logar!

789
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,951
Shut up, blockhead.
We know what you are.

790
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,479
Do you want to
save your planet?

791
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,635
Who are you?

792
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,035
Whoopy Who.
What difference does that make?

793
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,754
Bring the sacred stones. I know
how to get rid of the fireball.

794
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,154
Are you an oracle?

795
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,033
What oracle, man... Captain,
tell that schmuck to shut up.

796
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,395
If he had some brain...

797
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,710
...he'd understood that those
stones symbolize the 4 elements.

798
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,592
- Symbolize?
- Yeah, sure.

799
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,314
The 4 elements of nature.
Fire, water, earth, wood.

800
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,629
Wood?

801
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,472
Why, are you offended?

802
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,154
4 elements of nature...

803
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,078
Fire, earth and water is easy...
Just get me some wood.

804
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,355
Wasn't it air?

805
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,159
I said elements of nature.

806
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,713
He could be right, sir.

807
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,393
This is a prisoner from Earth...

808
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,272
Are you going to
trust him with Gora's future?

809
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,359
No, he'll trust you. Folks,
don't piss me off, bring the stones.

810
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,158
Are you sure you can stop it?

811
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,032
Never mind that.
I have a condition.

812
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,635
After I save the planet
you'll release me and my friends.

813
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,073
Deal!
Bring in the stones.

814
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,436
You brought this guy to Gora, right?

815
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,398
Forget it, may be
he can't stop it.

816
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,596
"Can't stop it"?
What did I just say?

817
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,833
We're done for.

818
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,438
Yes, 4 elements of nature.

819
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,993
10 minutes to impact.

820
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,639
Don't tense me out here...!

821
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,074
4 elements of nature...

822
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,158
Fire, water, earth, wood.
Now get me some wood.

823
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,916
Would this do the job?

824
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,113
Here we go.
Our first element.

825
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,750
Wood.

826
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,228
No, earth.

827
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,194
Our second element, wood.

828
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,472
Nope. Fire. Just a sec.

829
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,634
And our 3. element... Wood.

830
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,669
Listen, are you sure it's not air?

831
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,029
No, water. Just a minute!

832
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,599
He spat on the sacred stone!

833
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,916
What was I supposed to do,
dig for water?

834
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,709
And our last element... wood!

835
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,077
No... It's air.
Someone said just air!

836
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,794
It's not wood.
Don't make up elements.

837
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,949
Air.

838
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,153
Well, we've learned and saw
many elements.

839
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,796
Now, the trickiest part. You'll
have do find me a girl.

840
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,032
I'll kiss her in the middle of
4 elements and the fireball will stop.

841
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,759
For example this girl.

842
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,359
What the hell
are you saying, you moron?

843
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,154
The girl will come here!
Otherwise I'll turn off the elements!

844
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,750
Father!

845
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,712
Superior Tocha,
I won't allow this.

846
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,434
What's going through your mind Logar,
shall we all die?

847
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,278
Folks, the fireball!

848
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,438
Let her do it.
We'll take care of him later.

849
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,631
Come on or I'll turn it off.

850
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,595
Your name?

851
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,676
Ceku.

852
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,911
I'm Arif. Are you from around here?

853
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,189
Yes.

854
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,956
Are you in school? Which year?

855
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,870
Your dress is beautiful,
are you princess?

856
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,155
Sort of.

857
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,392
I have to kiss you.

858
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,715
I know.

859
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,194
Shall I?

860
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,719
One minute to impact.

861
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,912
Just a minute. Actually...

862
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,875
Kissing a stranger,
I don't know but maybe...

863
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,157
It's strange but
you know, the fireball...

864
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,799
Do you love your planet?

865
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,029
Yes.

866
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,949
I love my planet too.
I love it very much but...

867
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,238
10... 9... 8...

868
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,750
7... 6... 5...

869
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,749
4... 3... 2... 1...

870
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,877
Enough of this nonsense!
Plackumates, arrest him.

871
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,356
What for?
I saved the planet.

872
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,958
Don't believe this trash!

873
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,668
You think you're smart,
don't you earthling?

874
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,592
You want to take over Gora.

875
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,637
Didn't we have a deal?

876
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,549
This fool has cast dust in your eyes.
I have to consider Gora's security.

877
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,432
I'll take interrogate later.
Take him away!

878
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,949
Some ailen you are.
You're breaking our bargain.

879
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,556
Now that we got rid of the fireball
sent by that stupid Earthling...

880
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,509
...l'd like to invite you all to my
wedding. He didn't hurt you, did he?

881
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,991
Forget about the deal.
There will be no wedding.

882
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,394
Really?

883
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,517
Then I will put these photos
all around Gora City.

884
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,872
Please, don't exaggerate.

885
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,758
Bravo, Arif! You saved us all.

886
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,275
Yeah, sure. You saw
how I was treated.

887
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,959
That was an awesome kiss
with the girl.

888
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,191
Drop it Japanese.
Don't get on my nerves...

889
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,034
I'm so sorry Arif.
If I had known they would do this...

890
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,476
- Where have you been?
- Ventilation.

891
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,069
You, Robot, except you
all of these guys are useless.

892
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,998
You, and the girl.
Forget the rest.

893
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,270
- Did you see how she looked at you?
- No. How did she look?

894
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,553
We've seen it all on TV,
she was really checking you out.

895
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,593
Shame on you. You should have zapped
when you saw us kissing.

896
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,518
Give me a smoke.

897
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,152
Are they marrying that girl
to that pinhead?

898
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,549
She doesn't want to.

899
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,075
Well, how could she?
This is weird.

900
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,033
That girl is alien
and that pimp too.

901
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,190
Then they say that
aliens are evil. She's like an angel.

902
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,072
You know the line,
an alien says...

903
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,788
..."Hi Earthling, we are friends."
If that girl said this, it would be OK.

904
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,275
But that fag... Look how
he makes me curse like sailor.

905
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,239
I shouted there. I was the one
who placed the stones...

906
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,510
...but he puts on airs
as if he is the commander.

907
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,715
He is commander!

908
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,474
Could be, but first he needs to
be human. What's with those airs...

909
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,558
And he says "Take him away."
I'm going to take him out for sure.

910
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,797
No, pal... This is not alienity.
It should come from inside.

911
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,514
The other guy is an animal.
The girl is like an angel.

912
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,948
Was this no goal either?

913
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,351
Did I miss again?

914
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,716
Was this no goal too?

915
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,150
- Was this no goal?
- It was!

916
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,032
I entrust myself to your
justice and humanity, your Honor.

917
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,998
Ceku, my child.

918
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,116
I'm in love, mom.

919
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,958
With the earthling?

920
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,316
Was it that obvious?

921
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,753
Just like me.

922
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,588
Look, mom. Arif is mine...
I fell in love with him first.

923
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,554
I'm not talking about Arif, Ceku.

924
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,553
I happened to fall in love
with a non-Goran too.

925
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,155
You loved someone
from another planet?

926
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:52,160
Yes. I was even sure
that he was madly in love with me.

927
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,598
I don't know how to put this.

928
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,993
- Your father is not Tocha.
- What?

929
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,556
Tocha is not your real father.
Your father was very different.

930
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,029
He stood out from the rest.

931
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:12,955
Papa!

932
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,391
It's not me. Your father
is an earthling, Ceku.

933
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,476
What?

934
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,472
Rendroy is the only one
who knows our secret.

935
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,439
Your father has been a fugitive
outside Gora for years.

936
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,428
He always wanted to take us
to Earth... but in vain.

937
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,875
Tell me where my father is.

938
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,558
In Negney. What are you doing?

939
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,114
I'm going to my father.

940
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,437
I would rather return to Earth with
my dad, than marry that lowlife Logar.

941
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,074
Negney is outside
Gora's defensive shield.

942
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,794
Ceku, you can't go alone.

943
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,555
Then you will help me, Rendroy.

944
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,794
Such a girl and when you
look at her from a distance...

945
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,157
...she's too tolerant to be an alien.
For instance, we kissed.

946
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,834
- She didn't do anything...
- She was saving her planet, man.

947
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,670
There was an
electricity between us!

948
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,150
Something happened.
Would she have kissed you?

949
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,390
Of course.

950
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,956
Get out of here. I wouldn't kiss you
even if the Earth was in flames.

951
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,476
What, are you pissed off?

952
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,476
Arif Isik, Arif Isik,
You have a visitor.

953
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,479
The girl is here!
I swear this is the girl.

954
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,835
How do I look?

955
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,354
Alright, stand up straight!

956
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,154
Oh boy, I'm shaking.
Give me that rose. I'm off.

957
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,436
Hi!

958
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,760
Was it you, creature? What evil
are you planning for me this time?

959
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,639
First of all I'd like to
apologize as a Goran.

960
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,268
What's up?

961
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,989
Don't think I approve of
Logar's attitude.

962
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,992
You are a big hero, Arif.

963
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,028
Take this pass-card,
it will get you out of here.

964
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,079
If this is another trick
I won't forgive you.

965
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,316
Don't be ridiculous...
We don't have time...

966
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,830
This card will take you
to the waste disposal unit.

967
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,793
You have to flee before
Logar takes care of you.

968
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:06,955
Ceku, will wait for you outside. Take
care of her, don't leave her alone.

969
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,914
Creature, you are the only
human among them.

970
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,032
You are a decent lad, thanks.
I have a question...

971
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,920
- What happened to your face?
- What's with my face?

972
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,439
That's what I'm asking.

973
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,597
My goodness,
there's something with it.

974
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,359
Anyway, take care.

975
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,430
Bye.

976
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,113
This dog will get
no bread nor water.

977
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,196
If Rendroy said this
you can trust him.

978
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,671
He's different from the rest,
indeed he's from Anarsha.

979
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:39,237
Arif, smarten up.
Which waste depot, which girl?

980
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,551
They are pulling your leg.

981
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,314
But he says that
Rendroy is from Anarsha.

982
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,793
The Anarshan never tell lies. And
they are the best at keeping secrets.

983
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,479
Move on, everything's fine.
Look, I have the pass-card...

984
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,228
I'm out of here.
Who ever wants, can come too.

985
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,715
I'm in.

986
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,956
I'll come with you to the exit.
Maybe I can be of help.

987
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,279
That's the spirit. Do your thing,
don't let the door zap us.

988
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,349
Come.

989
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,871
The guy's at the door. What now?

990
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,391
Distract him, I'll come from behind.

991
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,914
What kind of an idea is that?

992
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,115
Let's go!

993
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,273
- Hello there, sir.
- What are you doing here?

994
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,269
Come dear.
Hello, again.

995
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,996
Our friend is ill.
He has only 3 months to live.

996
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:02,109
We collect money for his operation
and we're selling these postcards.

997
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,037
Everyone, from the cook,
up to the Superior bought one...

998
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,992
- Pay whatever you like.
- What cards? Which superior?

999
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,873
This superior...

1000
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,389
Bastard. He puts us through an
interrogation for a small donation.

1001
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,712
Open up. Would you like postcards?

1002
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,271
- Let's go!
- So long, I'm not coming.

1003
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,949
Bob, be smart...
we can go back to Earth.

1004
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,634
Do you really think that you can
get to Earth?

1005
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,670
Don't be shy... listen to the man.
Flee at once and find me.

1006
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,909
Who's that?

1007
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:39,277
This is nothing alike
your science-fiction movies. Let's go.

1008
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,318
He kept saying "Come, come."
His name is Garavel.

1009
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,755
- Garavel?
- This is all in vain.

1010
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,838
So, would he appear in
a corona of light if it were in vain?

1011
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,479
We have to find the girl first.

1012
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,109
There's a girl, too.
You're making this too complicated.

1013
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,079
Don't complain about everything.
You're spoiling the adventure.

1014
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,959
- I don't like adventures.
- So, you don't like adventures?

1015
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,077
Let me give you
a brief insight then.

1016
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,833
You're writing scripts
for adult movies.

1017
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,350
You have a reggae bar in Kusadas.
You're in another galaxy, as prisoner.

1018
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,919
You have robot friends.

1019
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,634
You get little pills as food.
And, you don't like adventure?

1020
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,632
Congratulations!

1021
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,438
Why are you laughing?

1022
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,598
Maybe he's programmed to laugh.
Give me 5. Let's go.

1023
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,039
Come, this way.

1024
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,718
Oh no. The other way.

1025
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,356
So, you like adventure, huh?

1026
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,279
Let's not argue, please.
I didn't go in because I got spooked.

1027
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,357
216, Arif, I'm here.

1028
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,917
"216 and Arif!"
I have only devorative purposes.

1029
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,838
Ceku, my dearest!

1030
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,789
How are you...
Thanks for rescuing me.

1031
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,713
- We'll talk about that later, let's go.
- Let's go then, honey!

1032
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:01,359
And I'm Bob Marley Faruk,
nice to meet you. For crying out loud.

1033
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,478
We'll exit here. The atmosphere
could burn your lungs.

1034
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,915
- Why should it?
- What do I know? Ask her.

1035
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:11,275
Come on.

1036
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:15,314
- What's going on?
- You're against everything!

1037
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,112
You go ahead.
They may look at your...

1038
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,792
Why do you say such things?

1039
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,396
The atmosphere is beautiful.

1040
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,949
- We made it!
- Yeah, right.

1041
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,913
- I can almost see Taksim Square.
- Jeez!

1042
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,037
There should be a bar around here.

1043
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,116
Ceku, this is crazy.

1044
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,958
Are we going to waste town?

1045
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,111
We have to find Chungo.

1046
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:37,118
Come and get it.
Quality on the cheap.

1047
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,874
Hold on a little.
The signal is breaking up.

1048
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,513
Hello, Muhittin. Yes, dear.

1049
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,872
What? Hereke carpet. Say 5000 $ .

1050
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,515
It cost us 3500, man...
Is he tourist?

1051
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,309
Alright, sell it for 5000...
Yeah, sell it.

1052
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,074
Just a call
from work.

1053
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,828
- Arif, let's buy this one.
- Okay, take it.

1054
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,312
- Changing room?
- At the back.

1055
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,150
- He's happy.
- How much did you pay?

1056
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,515
Not much.

1057
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,916
Hey, buddy. I have very smooth
second hand lightsabers.

1058
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,674
- Come on, beat it.
- Sorry Faruk, didn't recognize you.

1059
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,276
- Who was that?
- I don't know him...

1060
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,194
What's up Bob?

1061
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,108
Oh, Bob, how are you pops?

1062
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,759
Faruk,
are you staying for tonight girl?

1063
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,832
She must have mixed me up.

1064
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,152
- So you never went out, huh?
- Okay, just a couple of times.

1065
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,833
How can we find him?
What was his name?

1066
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,510
On Earth we would have
asked the barmen.

1067
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,553
Shall I ask?

1068
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,115
Don't even speak. They'll
tear you apart twice here.

1069
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,233
There he is!

1070
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,874
Garavel.

1071
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,639
Who's Garavel?

1072
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,873
- You told us to come, here we are.
- Who are you? Get lost.

1073
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,114
- Aren't you Garavel?
- No. Beat it!

1074
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,079
- Garavel? We're looking for Chungo.
- Who's looking for Chungo?

1075
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:19,199
- Rendroy... We're heading for Negney.
- I'm Chungo. Are you Ceku?

1076
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,316
How could I've known,
they all have hoods.

1077
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,870
Let's get to business Chungo.
Rendroy sent us. We're off to Negney.

1078
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,310
You said 2 people.
Are you 4 now?

1079
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,114
4 people. 3 adults
and one robot

1080
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,673
First the money.

1081
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,119
Here you are.

1082
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,272
That's dollars. It's no good.
Buy yourself candy with it.

1083
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,517
What else?

1084
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,999
- Well, I have 20 million Turkish Lira.
- Turkish money is fine.

1085
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:56,876
- I don't trust this guy.
- These? These are junk, man.

1086
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,313
- Pal, is their nitrogen tank full?
- Nitrogen, my ass. Come.

1087
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,952
What nitrogen?

1088
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:08,357
I'm using technical words so
he doesn't think we're gullible.

1089
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,158
216, ride with me.

1090
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,358
I can't ride with you.
You drive like crazy. Arif

1091
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,992
Bob, did you ever use one of these?

1092
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,596
I used to drive a taxi in Istanbul.

1093
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,592
Well, take it easy!

1094
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,752
We made it guys!

1095
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,629
Sit down!

1096
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:53,673
Arif, listen to that fellow.
Robot says he's hungry.

1097
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,476
You are some fox.

1098
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,355
We'll stop by the Churo trees.

1099
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,876
Commander Logar,
the Plackumates are ready.

1100
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,195
Bring them on...

1101
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,989
- So this is the summer outfit?
- Yes, Sir.

1102
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:21,439
Nice. Turn around. Attention... March!

1103
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,068
Bataillon, stop!

1104
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,070
Isn't this too flashy, Kuna?

1105
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,754
- I think it's perfect for the summer.
- Alright.

1106
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,312
- Commander Logar.
- Yes, dear?

1107
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,312
3 prisoners escaped, sir.

1108
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,794
Excuse me?

1109
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,118
Colonel Zoran gave fugitive alert.

1110
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,278
Earthling Arif, 216
and one from the staff broke out.

1111
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,629
What are you talking about?

1112
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,717
Not me, she gave the report.

1113
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,638
Logar, where's my daughter?

1114
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,193
What do you mean, Sir?

1115
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,719
Ceku is missing!

1116
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,678
- Kuna!
- Logar!

1117
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,669
Give me that.

1118
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,718
Clear the way.

1119
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,917
You're going to burn,
you're going to die!

1120
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,270
- Are you an oracle?
- Don't cause tension!

1121
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,950
Buddy, I've got very nice
second hand lightsabers.

1122
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,750
- Who am I?
- Commander Logar.

1123
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,514
- Repeat.
- Commander Logar.

1124
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,477
Have you seen them around here?

1125
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,553
Just like this?

1126
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,193
Commander Logar.

1127
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,438
Look here, Earth money.
Where did you find this? Speak.

1128
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,433
- Alright, stop. I'll tell everything.
- Shut up dog! Don't answer back.

1129
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,272
What have you done?

1130
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:23,229
Don't know. When things got tense
I got carried away a little.

1131
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,113
- Take off your glasses.
- Yeah, so what? I lost my temper.

1132
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,117
- Commander Logar.
- Yes, dear?

1133
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,272
- An object is approaching, Sir.
- Who are you?

1134
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,318
Get out! Out! Out.

1135
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,678
Shoot everything that moves.
Burn this place down.

1136
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,634
Burn it!

1137
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,869
- Ceku, are you cold?
- A little.

1138
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,716
If you're cold I could
set this whole place on fire.

1139
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,439
Oh, Arif!

1140
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,756
Robot, you don't know
what you're missing.

1141
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,674
That's some great garlic sausages.

1142
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,918
Look at the fruits of that tree.
Sausages.

1143
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,916
We're out in space. Did nothing
else startle you?

1144
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,355
Bob, what's inside that?

1145
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,876
Just plain meat.
It sure is hot.

1146
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,270
Yuck! You're eating meat?

1147
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,349
I'm going to ask you something.
Where are we going now?

1148
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,318
Bit by bit to Earth?

1149
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,999
Ceku, shall I tell them?

1150
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,839
Buddies, we will first find
Ceku's father.

1151
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,073
Ceku's father is a fugitive from Earth
who lives in Negney. Are you surprised?

1152
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,068
Was Superior Tocha
not you real father?

1153
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,390
My mother Mulu told me everything.

1154
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,637
We'll find my father and flee from
this damned place. Are you with me?

1155
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,193
I'm in.

1156
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,193
Oh my dearest.
How much you suffer.

1157
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:10,153
We have to find that beaming guy.
He'll settle everything.

1158
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,391
We'll find him. We'll find
Ceku's father too.

1159
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:16,918
You saved us from that prison, we'll
even find your primary school teacher.

1160
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,910
I foretold you that
someone would help you out.

1161
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:23,198
- It turned out to be true. Arif
- Bravo, Arif.

1162
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,437
Who says there's no life
in space? Here!

1163
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,951
Yeah, hit on her.

1164
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:35,871
Can't I have a little romance here?
Take this. I'll take a leak.

1165
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,432
There are no creatures
around here, right?

1166
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,191
During introduction,
you ask for their sign.

1167
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,677
Mine is Taurus. Or who's
your favourite philosopher?

1168
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:53,232
Socrates. These kind of things. I could
have done this but I don't favor it.

1169
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,392
So strange.
You're in a different galaxy.

1170
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,637
On a total foreign planet but you
don't seem to mind it.

1171
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:04,909
That's philosophy. I'm in tourism, so
we work with foreigners all the time.

1172
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,759
I know foreign languages,
so I can socialize.

1173
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:11,589
If I stayed here for 3 month
I could learn...

1174
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,593
- Do you know English?
- English? No.

1175
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,519
English is a must.
How come you don't know?

1176
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,270
English, let me give you an example.
I love you is English.

1177
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,918
I love you. Don't get me wrong,
it's an example.

1178
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:31,473
It means I love you. I means I...
Iove means you...

1179
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:35,508
...and love means you.
But it's not that simple.

1180
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,990
There are different
conjugations in English.

1181
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,439
So it's complicated.

1182
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,235
Are you going back to Earth
when you find your dad?

1183
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,113
I don't know. Can I
adapt to Earth?

1184
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,430
Earth should adapt to you.

1185
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,551
What's Earth,
just a planet.

1186
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,235
- Does it have satellites?
- Satellite?

1187
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,750
The Earth. Yes, it has one.

1188
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,437
It's very beautiful, moonlight.
Romantic. You take your drink.

1189
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,075
- So, Earth is beautiful.
- It is.

1190
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:09,996
- What about the Earthman?
- This is the difficult part.

1191
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,599
But you'll tell the truth.

1192
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,837
Well, should I speak about myself
or about men from Earth?

1193
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,110
Do Earthmen differ that much?

1194
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,709
There's at least 5000
different type of people.

1195
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,630
The Brad Pitt type,
you know, baby face.

1196
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,070
And there are those like me, who are
appealing to women.

1197
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:35,237
I'm different, really.
For a regular guy...

1198
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:40,355
...sex comes in first place,
for me second, even third.

1199
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,794
Really?

1200
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,195
I don't know.
Maybe it's just me, I don't know.

1201
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,630
- You're so sweet.
- You too.

1202
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,677
Now stop.
I don't want to brag.

1203
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,155
What about love? Do men
fall in love on Earth?

1204
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,439
- They are loyal to their love.
- Do you have a lover?

1205
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:01,397
No, not on Earth.
Nor on another planet.

1206
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,634
I'm in love with you Arif.

1207
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,392
I have feeling towards you too.
But let's first get to Earth.

1208
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,320
It's not just me. There are
1000 different type of people.

1209
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,358
Have a look.

1210
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,833
- No, we had garlic sausages.
- What's that got to do with it?

1211
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:23,277
On Earth, when you eat
sausage you don't kiss...

1212
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,879
Pardon.

1213
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:34,394
Bob, can you come here a second?

1214
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,357
Over here. Can you come
here for a second?

1215
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,236
- Bob, what do you think you're doing?
- What's going on?

1216
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,038
You didn't let me
enjoy a little romance.

1217
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,595
- What did I do?
- Didn't you let one rip?

1218
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,119
- Who, me?
- No, me.

1219
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,829
- There was only two of us.
- There's the girl and the robot.

1220
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,475
- Did the girl fart then?
- Maybe it was the robot.

1221
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:08,070
- Bob, you're going to far.
- Maybe he's programmed to fart.

1222
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,678
He brags that he's a fine robot.
It must have been him.

1223
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,549
We're on another planet and
besides, you're peeing on my foot...

1224
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,116
Plackumates!
Arif, Bob! Run.

1225
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,155
Run!

1226
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,954
They're shooting at us!

1227
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,189
Arif!

1228
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,518
Run towards the trees.

1229
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,110
Where's Ceku? Where is she?

1230
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,958
To the waterfall!

1231
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,151
- Where?
- Waterfall!

1232
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,915
Let me go!

1233
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:30,910
Our defiant girl is back.
Who was rough to you.

1234
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,318
Where are her accessories?

1235
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,591
They were killed in the Churo forest.

1236
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,349
What a lovely place to die.

1237
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,836
Ceku, Ceku.

1238
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,199
You're a dog!

1239
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,353
You ate sausages.

1240
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,749
Ceku, my daughter.

1241
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,798
Mom, get me out of here.

1242
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,152
Mulu, is the wedding dress ready?
You see, we're running out of time.

1243
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,950
Your daughter used her adventure
bonus, I don't want any more games.

1244
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,757
Don't look like that.

1245
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,829
If I hadn't farted
we all would be dead by now.

1246
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,516
We have to find Garavel.

1247
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,474
Would it be ok if he found you?

1248
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,719
Hold on! You think everyone
with a hood is Garavel.

1249
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,478
Will you allow me to make a test?

1250
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,988
Damn...!

1251
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,199
That's him! We're saved.

1252
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,556
- Give me 5.
- We're saved!

1253
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:54,515
My real name is Hursit
but they call me Garavel here.

1254
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,510
He's a robot,
he doesn't drink. Thanks.

1255
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,995
- A 211?
- Oh no, 216

1256
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,991
Good upgrade.

1257
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,114
Thanks.

1258
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:10,518
- How long have you been here?
- It's been 24 years.

1259
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,430
You must have had a hard life.

1260
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:16,875
Pardon!

1261
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,509
Drink your tea and rest.
We have plenty to do.

1262
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,631
I have to touch and sniff you
so that I can recognize you.

1263
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,197
This guy's a serious case.

1264
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,989
- Why sniffing?
- I'm blind.

1265
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:35,318
But a big trauma would
open your eyes, wouldn't it?

1266
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,878
What kind of a bullshit is that?

1267
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:47,071
You are very different from your movies.
In Turkish movies it went like that.

1268
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,238
10 years ago I lost my eyes
during an acid rain.

1269
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,153
Now knock it off
and let me sniff you!

1270
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,791
You, come over here!

1271
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:03,837
- Your name?
- Faruk, Bob Marley Faruk

1272
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,230
Okay, go. Now you!

1273
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,119
216. Go!

1274
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:18,149
- Do I smell too?
- I can smell everything. You!

1275
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,794
Arif Isik, all kinds of
carpet, kilim, travel.

1276
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,791
We've come a long way.
Don't let the smell mislead you.

1277
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,718
Ok, I got what I wanted.

1278
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,797
Now watch me.

1279
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:47,435
Bob, you're there.
Arif, there. 216, there.

1280
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,996
- Correct?
- Yes, Master! Bravo!

1281
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,678
- Can we talk for a sec?
- What?

1282
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,428
Mr Garavel, how long
have you been living here?

1283
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,438
This guy's a nutcase.

1284
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,069
And he's not blind at all,
he can definitely see.

1285
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,391
Come on. Let go, for God's sake.

1286
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:10,274
Ceku's picture. You're Ceku's
father. We found you.

1287
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,671
Give me that.

1288
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,715
Yes, this is Ceku.

1289
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,316
But I'm not Ceku's father.

1290
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,469
Guys, please. I hope
I don't end up being her father...

1291
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,036
Tell us who Ceku's father is.

1292
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,912
Ceku's father is...

1293
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:46,631
...Colonel Pilot Riza Küçükdurmaz.
He's Ceku's father...

1294
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,031
In 1979 we were together during a
reconnaissance flight.

1295
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,477
We disappeared in a light beam
and came here.

1296
01:30:56,120 --> 01:31:01,911
Riza was rebellious and tempered.
He always had and escape plan.

1297
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:06,675
- Just like I would do.
- My circuits are running wild.

1298
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:14,756
He always wanted to take his daughter
to Earth. Being a fugitive is hard.

1299
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:19,793
We managed to build a ship
but Riza was at the end of his days.

1300
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:24,028
- Don't tell me he's dead.
- He's dead man. Dead as meat.

1301
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,231
My condolences.

1302
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:31,196
It was 2 years ago.
First I didn't know what to do.

1303
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:34,518
I sent out signals to
Gora prisoner ships.

1304
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,473
Many times... Then I found you,
thanks to your mobile...

1305
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,756
- You were talking to someone.
- Muhittin.

1306
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:44,352
Whoever! I needed someone
who wanted to return to Earth.

1307
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,200
Finally I got your signal
and contacted you.

1308
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,556
That's why you called me
'chosen one'.

1309
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,118
Whatever!
I gave my friend my word.

1310
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,352
Do you understand what this means?
I gave him my word!

1311
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,915
Alright, I get it.

1312
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,311
It's too late for me.

1313
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,079
I won't make it.

1314
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,596
Would you take Ceku to Earth?

1315
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,151
Sure, man. I would go with her
to hell and back.

1316
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:16,596
You didn't disappoint me Arif. How
about supper before we start training?

1317
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,918
We have raki too.

1318
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,116
I could drink a big bottle.

1319
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,356
Cut it out, he's blind.

1320
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,635
If you don't settle for less,
you won't get more.

1321
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,518
Did you pick this
by sniffing?

1322
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,830
- Why, is it bad?
- Nope, but...

1323
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,559
Let me share it.

1324
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,599
- Amazing.
- Yeah!

1325
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:40,869
Bravo, Master.

1326
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:44,470
Technique. Ambition.
Will power. Concentration.

1327
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,872
This is technique, did you see that?

1328
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,233
Robot... could you pass me that salt.

1329
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:54,799
I have it.
Speed, balance, timing.

1330
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,032
Cheers.

1331
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,513
I'm here!

1332
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,398
Yeah... but why?

1333
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:11,199
Here we go!

1334
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,110
I'm rebellious!

1335
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,311
How do I get here in seconds?

1336
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,156
Knowledge, experience.
Discipline.

1337
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:25,078
- Arif, he's insane.
- Never mind. Bottoms up!

1338
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:34,558
Determination.
Desire. Ability.

1339
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,394
Thanks for the food.
Now excuse me.

1340
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:42,553
- Eating less, improves intelligence.
- I don't eat at all.

1341
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,634
Who the hell are you?
Yeah, the robot. Ok.

1342
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:50,959
Now excuse me Mr Garavel.
Good night.

1343
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,674
Did you see that?
They are afraid of me.

1344
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:57,032
You stayed. Why?
Because you are the one!

1345
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,993
- Red or blue?
- What "red or blue"?

1346
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,838
Don't try too fool me.
Is this not Matrix?

1347
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:08,709
What mattress?
These are my blood pressure pills.

1348
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:14,348
You're a strange guy Master Garavel.
How are we going to go back to Earth?

1349
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,598
We'll take out what's in you
and then stick it back in.

1350
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,599
What's with these
word play?

1351
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,478
Arif, you're here.

1352
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:24,432
Hey, a camera!

1353
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:27,792
Just let me take a long shot,
as a memory.

1354
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,595
I'll sniff it
and remember you.

1355
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,748
I can only think of Ceku.
We're going to rescue her, right?

1356
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,468
Don't worry,
we'll take care of it all.

1357
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,832
Get some sleep now.
Tomorrow will be a hard day.

1358
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,230
That camera came in handy.
I don't have a single picture in space.

1359
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,038
- Where are you?
- Here, here.

1360
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,992
Did you ever see Ceku
before today?

1361
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:50,878
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't sniff her by chance?

1362
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:53,674
- What's this crap?
- Fine then. This way.

1363
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:54,520
I can't believe they're dead.

1364
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,240
I can't believe they're dead.

1365
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:58,959
Arif told me that he was
loyal to his love.

1366
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,754
I know, he'll come
and rescue me.

1367
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,468
Don't take it so hard
on yourself.

1368
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:08,315
Sometimes we have to
accept our faith.

1369
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:14,228
On Earth the brides say:
"I cry but go anyway."

1370
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,833
How true it is.

1371
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,479
Don't be so disgusting, Logar.

1372
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:20,280
I came for the wedding gown fitting.
What's disgusting about that?

1373
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:23,318
- Why are you doing this?
- Cause I'm a psychopath.

1374
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,432
Please don't, Commander Logar!

1375
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,677
This is a joke knife. Look.

1376
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:40,158
But I have a real one if you want.
Enough with games, put it on.

1377
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,157
This is the ship that will
take you to Earth.

1378
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,472
KA-FA 1500

1379
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:49,675
Yes.

1380
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,555
- The turbines are not original.
- Get a shot of me with the ship.

1381
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:57,314
Master Garavel, are the papers
of the ship alright?

1382
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,750
We have a long way ahead.
I wouldn't like any trouble.

1383
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:02,634
Yes, everything's fine.
Did you ever fly a KA-FA 1500?

1384
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,794
- To be honest... no.
- Come with me.

1385
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,512
Look... how's that?

1386
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:15,949
Nice... What is it?

1387
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,676
I built it... an upload system.
Don't ask me how it works.

1388
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:24,317
It takes 6 hours to explain. With this
I can make you a real space fighter.

1389
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,591
- Sit.
- You swear?

1390
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,316
Let's see what we have.

1391
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,991
KA-FA 1500...

1392
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:40,438
Hold on... How about
a little action?

1393
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:42,636
Let's load Kung-fu.

1394
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:45,957
To me? Ok, do so.
What else do you have?

1395
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:52,510
Aikido, karate, Jiu-Jitsu, Highschool
Physics, Tao Sex, Best of Journey.

1396
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,837
Have you got a sampler?

1397
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,631
- Sure.
- Give me the sampler.

1398
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,154
Tie him up.

1399
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,596
Man, this is a Commodore 64, right?

1400
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:11,832
Bob, turn the camera off.
Don't waste the tape.

1401
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,873
Get the helmet.

1402
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,634
Good.

1403
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:30,989
Good.

1404
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,758
You won't feel any pain.

1405
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,389
After the upload you'll be
a perfect warrior.

1406
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:43,070
I've got nothing to do with war. Just
give me enough to rescue Ceku.

1407
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,838
- Are you ready Arif?
- Yeah!

1408
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,352
Here it comes!

1409
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,231
Here it comes!

1410
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:19,959
Ok, take it off.

1411
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,869
The Force should be used
in the right place and time.

1412
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:46,876
Don't forget, you should
never play with food.

1413
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:56,033
I told you, it was a great upload.
His body has adapted to it.

1414
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,957
Use your wrist.

1415
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:16,800
Are you sure you're not
getting a free paint job here?

1416
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:20,471
Don't forget, you can use
your powers for good as well.

1417
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,837
How am I going to use
Karate for good?

1418
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:25,996
I'm going to knock
the shit out of them.

1419
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:29,596
Nonsense! These exercises
will be fruitful later on.

1420
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,950
Master Garavel,
these fruits are not ripe.

1421
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:37,274
Gather them. You were unripe too,
now you're ripe. Come on.

1422
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,357
Just run in circles around me, man!

1423
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,830
I'm doing that.
What else should I do?

1424
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,192
Turn that off.

1425
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:10,636
You are some pinhead.

1426
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,714
When I bend back like this
run in a full circle around me.

1427
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,595
I didn't understand that part
so I ran like this.

1428
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,195
- A full circle. That's it.
- Bob holds it the wrong way.

1429
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:23,358
- Turn it on again!
- What's going on here?

1430
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:27,439
Stop playing!
We've got business!

1431
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:35,758
Take your position!

1432
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:36,756
Ready?

1433
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,871
1, 2, 3!

1434
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:42,075
Odd or even!

1435
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,395
Even!

1436
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,113
Go on!

1437
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:46,548
- Did we guess right?
- Yes, you did.

1438
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,034
Give me five, Bob!

1439
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,436
- Don't be a spoilsport.
- Why, man?

1440
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,109
Sit down.

1441
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,432
Let's say, this is Ceku's room.

1442
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:08,274
The nearest plackumat is at the
end of the corridor. What do we do?

1443
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,639
A- Beat him up.

1444
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:14,913
B- Ignore him.

1445
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,631
C- We scram.

1446
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,672
- Sir.
- Sir. Sir.

1447
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:21,873
Yes, Faruk.

1448
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,436
B- Ignore him.

1449
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:27,198
A- We beat him up.

1450
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:28,509
Bravo, Arif!

1451
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:32,076
If I had been uploaded that much
I would have known it too.

1452
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,311
- You know the machine...
- Stop talking!

1453
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,713
Robot, do you have the plans?

1454
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,592
- Yes, sir
- Good.

1455
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,310
When you arrive at Gora go directly
to her room. No adventures!

1456
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:46,836
Would we get extra credit if we give
that pimp with the cap a good beating?

1457
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,796
What extra credit?

1458
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,833
Ok, you can leave now.
Arif, continue with your exercises.

1459
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,791
- Let's go, Robot.
- Have a nice day, sir.

1460
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:15,794
Bravo! Ceku will love
you much more like this.

1461
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:18,634
I don't intend to boast.
As soon as we're back on Earth...

1462
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:22,196
...l'll get it all deleted.
- Do you think it will be easy?

1463
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,199
- What?
- Rescuing Ceku from Gora.

1464
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,431
Don't worry. Just give me
that goddamn tool.

1465
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:36,395
Step aside!

1466
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:42,279
Mr Garavel, Arif and
Bob are calling you.

1467
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,956
- Alright.
- Good.

1468
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:49,075
Dude, I can't move in these tights.

1469
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:52,630
It looks good on you. Your shoulders
are in the open. Leave it like this.

1470
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:55,678
Master Garavel, how's this
outfit for the raid?

1471
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:01,513
The outfit is very important
for a superhero, Arif.

1472
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:05,355
- But this is a little...
- I think it's too sexy.

1473
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:07,073
Sexy. Go, change.

1474
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,148
How's this?

1475
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:12,355
Well...

1476
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:13,834
Nope. Next.

1477
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:15,439
And this?

1478
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:19,511
- The helmet doesn't look good.
- The helmet is no good they say. Next.

1479
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:22,918
Is this too
gentlemanlike?

1480
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,599
A little classic.

1481
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,034
Too classic. Next.

1482
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:29,955
Next!

1483
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,233
Because of this?

1484
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:34,479
How's this one?

1485
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,119
Super.

1486
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:37,640
Good.

1487
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:40,360
Good.

1488
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:45,275
Now go my boys!
Go and bring Ceku!

1489
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,754
Thanks for everything Master Garavel.
We'll be here with Ceku in 12 minutes.

1490
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,951
Good, you're quick. Have
a nice journey. Come back quick.

1491
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,315
Let's go!

1492
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,236
Good luck!

1493
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,159
Bob, are you ready to shoot
the sci-fi of your life?

1494
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:51,714
Start recording.

1495
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:54,675
Let's go!

1496
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,078
Bob, be careful with the camera.
Or else Mr Garavel will kill us!

1497
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,753
Move on!

1498
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,152
Let me shoot you.

1499
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,479
This is great.

1500
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,354
- You again?
- Oh my!

1501
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,510
Why "Oh my"?
Is this guy "Oh my"?

1502
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,475
- Bravo Arif
- Ceku's room.

1503
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,114
Ventilation.

1504
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,436
Come on. Shoot everything.

1505
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,550
Great! This color really becomes you.

1506
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,478
I'll make you one too.

1507
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,715
Be careful! Are you going to
stitch it on me?

1508
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:27,157
Commander Logar, alarm in D corridor.
3 of our men are missing.

1509
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,829
Why do you bother me
with that, you idiot?

1510
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:33,197
I don't want to pay attention
to anything but my wedding suit.

1511
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:34,515
I said careful.

1512
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,439
Look Kuna, I don't want trouble
in the last minute. Soldier, get out!

1513
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:42,629
I said out! I'm sick, I'm psycho, ok?
Get out!

1514
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,111
Get out! Out!

1515
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:50,878
- Commander Logar.
- Yes, dear?

1516
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:52,917
An object is approaching, Sir.

1517
01:46:56,040 --> 01:47:00,556
Out! Get out, all of you!
Get out!

1518
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:03,678
Come closer, come.
Sit down.

1519
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:11,679
Take off your glasses.

1520
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,229
- What's your name?
- Tihulu.

1521
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:30,349
Why do you constantly say
"An object is approaching?"

1522
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:32,477
Are you an oracle?

1523
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,236
Why are you doing this?

1524
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:42,758
Who are you?

1525
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,591
Let me have it. I want to
shoot a little too.

1526
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:51,634
Hold on. Something very
weird is going on here.

1527
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,199
What is it, man?

1528
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:59,070
Oh boy, Logar. You're
having a wedding, right?

1529
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,911
You'll get a perfect
wedding gift from me!

1530
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,594
I can't believe my eyes!

1531
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,638
I didn't know that
you were so nervous.

1532
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,990
I am.
You can ask Kuna.

1533
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,918
He is very nervous.

1534
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:12,593
- Commander Logar!
- Yes, dear?

1535
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,030
Are you really going to
make me Patrol Chief?

1536
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,071
Yes. I'm going to make all of you.

1537
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:19,038
What's going on there?

1538
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:23,598
Bob, your film took a weird turn.
It's not sci-fi anymore.

1539
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,753
Again 'oh my'!

1540
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:58,553
You, dude in black!
Come here.

1541
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:02,832
Come, keep coming like that!

1542
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,633
Did I use my fists
on the other one?

1543
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:06,558
- Yes, your fists.
- Then you'll get a kick.

1544
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:20,551
- Arif, Ceku is not here!
- What do you mean?

1545
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:24,438
Oh, my carpet! Take it with you.
I've got nothing to give away.

1546
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:28,635
Oh, shit!

1547
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,593
Arif? Guys?

1548
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:31,915
Where's Ceku?

1549
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:34,350
- She thinks you're dead.
- I swear we're not.

1550
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,596
- They are in the ball room.
- I know the way.

1551
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,553
- Ventilation.
- Oh man, what a ventilation.

1552
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,989
- This is the ballroom.
- Good.

1553
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:18,431
The bride's relatives are here as well.

1554
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:20,511
Are your power shields up?

1555
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:27,790
Beautiful.
Out, out, out!

1556
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:29,593
Dear Gorans...

1557
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:32,559
Commander Logar Trihis...

1558
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,760
...and his future wife
Ceku Lamtschina.

1559
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:48,874
Throw the bouquet.

1560
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:59,072
Dear Gorans. Commander Logar
will give us a little harp concert.

1561
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:01,597
Commander Logar Trihis!

1562
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:10,274
Make it big,
so that everyone can see.

1563
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:11,788
Arif, be careful!

1564
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:18,874
- My composition is called "You're mine".
- Applause!

1565
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:29,596
- What was I going to play?
- "You're mine".

1566
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:57,793
Applause!

1567
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:02,835
Shall I do an encore?
Shall I?

1568
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:17,198
Greetings! Is this dude
having his circumcision ceremony?

1569
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,238
- Arif!
- Ceku, honey.

1570
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,273
Plackumates, arrest him!

1571
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,671
OK. Excuse me, honey.
Come over!

1572
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:27,075
Come, come!

1573
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:45,157
Logar, you idiot!
I'm at the limit of heroism...

1574
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:48,000
...that's possible
in these kind of movies.

1575
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:50,470
Don't cause unnecessary trouble
and don't make me beat you.

1576
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:51,914
I'll take Ceku and leave.

1577
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:53,759
You moron! How dare you
ruin my wedding?

1578
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:55,189
Don't enrage me, dude!

1579
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:58,080
Dear Gorans, I'll show you
his real face.

1580
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:59,992
Bob! 216!

1581
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:10,160
Bob, go forward, man! What's this?

1582
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:13,995
60% of the Gorans are idiots.

1583
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:20,311
Tocha too. A little blackmail with
photomontage, and he obeyed.

1584
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:25,149
When I'm the Superior I'll get rid
of them all! The council too.

1585
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:28,438
I sent a fireball
and they all chickened out.

1586
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,432
- Did you send that fireball?
- No, my father.

1587
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:32,275
This is montage!

1588
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:35,155
Yeah, we saw you mounting.

1589
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:36,959
Plackumates, arrest him!

1590
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:40,749
We'll burn down the planet!

1591
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,317
You scum!

1592
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:50,913
Thanks, pal.

1593
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:04,832
Commander Logar, I'm detaining you
with charges of treason against Gora.

1594
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,918
That's not detain,
it's entertain.

1595
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:10,799
- Logar, what are you doing?
- What do you think?

1596
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,233
- I always wanted to do this.
- Bravo, Bob!

1597
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:20,273
Get them out of here.
They'll stand trial.

1598
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:23,750
You are a great man, Earthling.

1599
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:27,197
You saved us again
from a big disaster.

1600
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,870
On behalf of all Gorans
I'd like to thank you.

1601
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:31,553
Don't mention it,
Superior Tocha.

1602
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,910
We did learn a lot from you,
my friend!

1603
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,678
So did I.

1604
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:38,235
I learnt to look at life
from a different angle.

1605
01:54:38,440 --> 01:54:40,476
I starved, was pushed
and held captive.

1606
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,518
But I didn't give up. I was
oppressed because I was from Earth.

1607
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:46,757
I found struggle,
I found love, romance.

1608
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:51,638
Look how similar we are and
how we all strive for love, right?

1609
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,195
Hollywood, this goes to you.

1610
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:57,239
For decades you've
mispresented the aliens to us.

1611
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:02,355
But don't forget, a human is a human
even if he's an alien.

1612
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:04,551
- Mother Mulu, may I?
- Speak out Arif.

1613
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:06,671
Superior Tocha...
Ceku and I are in love.

1614
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,470
We will return to Earth and
build there a new world.

1615
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:12,716
A new world within that world.

1616
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,188
As you wish.

1617
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:16,952
Shall I get a ship prepared?

1618
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:19,549
We have one, don't worry.
Bob, 216.

1619
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:23,238
We'd like to give you the key to Gora.

1620
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:26,354
- Is it made of gold?
- Yes.

1621
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:30,152
- Stop!
- Who are you, basketball player?

1622
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,197
- Give me that tape!
- Which tape, man?

1623
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:34,237
Give it to me!

1624
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:36,948
That tape is the only proof
of our space adventure.

1625
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,634
- I have a family. Now, give it.
- What are you saying, fireball?

1626
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:45,197
- Run, if you're smart.
- Let him go Arif. He's just a kid.

1627
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:49,319
- Kid? He has a beard,
- Our love is proof enough.

1628
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:50,675
My love!

1629
01:56:00,280 --> 01:56:02,635
When you pass the heat
during atmosphere entry...

1630
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:04,273
...everything is okay.

1631
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,869
- I put the carpet into the ship.
- Great. Thanks!

1632
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:09,514
Guys, the ship is only for two.
So, excuse us, ok?

1633
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,469
Tocha is our friend now. We can come
and go whenever we want.

1634
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,153
Respect! You're
just as cool as Bob Marley.

1635
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:22,556
Don't worry. You won't regret it.

1636
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:25,674
Here, this is for you.

1637
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,474
What's this?

1638
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:29,716
Your dad's belongings.

1639
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,831
Thank you, Gravel.

1640
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,434
You can't find this kind of friendship
even on Earth. Robot.

1641
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:41,715
- Arif, I'll never forget you.
- You are really a robot man!

1642
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:47,673
Master Garavel!

1643
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:49,831
Give us your blessing.
You've helped us a lot.

1644
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,672
You have my blessing!

1645
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,392
- No way!
- Bravo!

1646
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:56,874
It's education, pops.

1647
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:59,839
- What's this?
- A camera. Does it have film?

1648
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:01,229
I don't know.

1649
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:03,795
There is. Go over there.

1650
01:57:10,840 --> 01:57:12,432
We're very lucky!

1651
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:15,434
Say cheese!

1652
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:21,109
No, this is no good either.
It is fake.

1653
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:24,193
- Hake?
- Fake. It's phony.

1654
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:27,712
I'd like to ask a question.

1655
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,073
You either don't take this serious
or you're playing with me.

1656
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:35,358
This space thing
is nothing like this.

1657
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:38,631
Cut the crap, look.

1658
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:43,233
This is me, this is Ceku,
this 216, the robot. Look!

1659
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:46,354
This is Bob Marley Faruk
and this is Master Garavel.

1660
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:48,312
This photo was taken on Gora.

1661
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:52,274
500.000$ minimum. 500.000$,
here you see the ship.

1662
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:55,353
KA-FA 1500. Don't tell me
about the ship I came back with.

1663
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:57,431
With the Goran girl!

1664
01:57:58,200 --> 01:57:59,918
Goran?

1665
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:03,799
Nutcase!

1666
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:10,791
Asim, I want a lemonade
and two Goran toast.

1667
01:58:11,240 --> 01:58:13,435
Do you want something, buddy?

1668
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:19,310
You'll never understand this.

1669
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:22,437
I'm not touching you this time.

1670
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:27,558
Pearls before swine.

1671
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:32,351
- What happened?
- They moved.

1672
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:34,352
- Who?
- My 'hala'.

1673
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:37,359
I wanted you to meet them
while you were here.

1674
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:41,439
- What's 'hala'?
- Hala and her family, relatives.

1675
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:44,638
Hala means the sister of the father.
I'll teach you all these.

1676
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:47,718
Teyze is the sister of the mother.
Görümce, elti... Something like Rendroy.

1677
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,069
What's wrong?

1678
01:58:51,320 --> 01:58:54,551
Arif, do you think
that I can adapt to the Earth?

1679
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:57,957
Of course. Just get over with this
galactic tension.

1680
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:01,237
It's only a planet.
Adapt to it!

1681
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:03,756
- Shall I go with light speed?
- Yeah, sure.

1682
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:08,793
Oh boy!
