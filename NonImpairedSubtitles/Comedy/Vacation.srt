1
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,642
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain, Rusty Griswold.</i>

2
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,407
<i>Hope you've enjoyed your 18-minute
flight from South Bend.</i>

3
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,882
We'll be touching down at Chicago's
Midway very shortly.

4
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,441
We'd like to thank you for flying
with us today...

5
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,366
...because at Econo Air, we're working
hard to win back your trust.

6
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,561
- Harry, you mind taking over while I hit the lav?
- Sure thing, Rusty.

7
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,131
Thank you very much.

8
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,570
- Oh, and Rusty.
- Mm-hm.

9
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,964
I wanna thank you for going to bat
for me last week.

10
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,360
I was happy to do it.

11
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,842
Just because corporate says
you're too old to fly doesn't make it true.

12
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,082
You're more qualified than us younger guys.

13
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,481
- Means a lot to me.
- Sure thing.

14
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,240
- Oh, and Rusty.
- Mm-hm.

15
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,082
I wanna thank you for going to bat
for me last week.

16
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,645
Yeah.

17
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,410
You bet.

18
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,801
Dad, is that the pilot?

19
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,086
It sure is.

20
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,686
- He just came from the cockpit.
- Whoa.

21
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,044
- Hey there, little guy.
- Hi.

22
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,929
Is this your first time on a plane?

23
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,445
We were planning on driving...

24
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,843
...but, uh, Tyler here has been begging us
to go on his first airplane.

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,160
- Oh, is that right?
- Uh-huh.

26
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,011
Do you think I can be a pilot
when I grow up?

27
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,003
Heh. Yeah, well, I don't see why not.

28
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,721
You just have to study hard
and listen to your parents, all right?

29
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,490
- Okay, heh.
- Sorry about that.

30
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,449
- Little bit of rough air.
- It's okay.

31
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,681
Yeah, yeah.

32
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,365
Don't worry about it, heh.

33
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,567
Hey, we call that "turbulence," all right?

34
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,245
That's when the plane passes...

35
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,131
So sorry.

36
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,806
Okay, you folks enjoy the
rest of your flight.

37
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,487
Let me give you a hand.

38
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,883
Can you please stay the fuck away from us?

39
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,248
Harry, you took us up to 60,000 feet.
What are you doing?

40
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,481
Oh, Rusty.

41
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,440
I wanna thank you for going to bat
for me last week.

42
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,001
Or the time that Pan Continental put us up
at the Ritz in Barcelona.

43
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,891
You know, I'll tell you one thing
about the Spanish women:

44
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,441
- They, uh, love them some airline pilots.
- Heh. They do.

45
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,921
I never took the uniform off,
except when I did.

46
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,726
Ladies.

47
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,528
All full.
You have to wait for the next one.

48
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,250
- But I was...
- You were what?

49
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,885
I'll catch the next one.

50
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,122
See you around, Econo Air.

51
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,690
- The third time this month.
- I know.

52
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,127
Do something about him.
He's always picking on me.

53
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,284
I know he is. I'm so sorry, honey. Hey.

54
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,608
- Hi. What's going on here?
- You'll see.

55
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,967
Kevin, get down here, please.

56
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,044
- Look what he did to my guitar.
- Aw. Again?

57
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,567
God. You told Mom and Dad?

58
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,085
You have such a vagina.

59
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,089
Okay, enough, enough. Now, young man...

60
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,760
...we talked about the bullying
of your older brother.

61
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,447
That's right. We don't make fun of
someone just because they're different.

62
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,406
- I don't have a vagina.
- I'm just saying, if you did...

63
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,564
...it wouldn't be okay for Kevin
to tease you about your vagina.

64
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,041
Why are you making it sound
like I have a vagina?

65
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,931
I know you don't have a vagina.
I'm not doing that.

66
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,766
- Kevin, apologize to your brother, please.
- Fine. I'm sorry.

67
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,001
Now go to your room.

68
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,646
Ah. I was in my fucking room.

69
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,963
- Whoa, hey, Kevin? Get back down here.
- Ah.

70
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,687
Now listen.

71
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,047
There are a lot of boys who are born
with vaginas.

72
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,486
It's very hard for them.

73
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,644
- Honey. Why?
- It's a teachable moment, hon.

74
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,644
Gender fluidity, right?
It's a very serious issue.

75
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,326
- I'm not gender-fluid.
- It doesn't matter if you are.

76
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,801
The point is
your mom and I would love you...

77
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,167
...even if you were completely blank
down there.

78
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,243
Okay, this is not the point.

79
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,811
Kevin, just go to your room.

80
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,360
Hey, James, don't get your
gender fluid on me.

81
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,284
- Awesome.
- Stop. It's not a fluid.

82
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,090
And what about my guitar?

83
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,730
It's ruined.

84
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,525
Let me have a look.

85
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,610
There you go. That'll do for now.

86
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,525
Now get washed up. The Petersons
are coming over for dinner.

87
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,641
Okay, baby.

88
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,643
Oh, gosh. I'll get you a new guitar, okay?

89
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,963
- Oh, use the Vitamix. The dry bit.
- Just grind it. Yeah.

90
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,726
Sheila.

91
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,680
- So do you have to work tomorrow?
- So, um, Sheila.

92
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,570
- I want to go to the movies with my friends.
- Sheila.

93
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,326
- What?
- Do you like school this year?

94
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,527
It's okay.

95
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,041
"So do you like school this year?"

96
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,931
That's seriously
what you sound like. Just shut up.

97
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,522
God, I'm telling you, Russ,
you've gotta get one of these go-kart kits.

98
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,727
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

99
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,406
Gary and I spent the last two months
building this.

100
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,730
We took her out this morning
for the first time.

101
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,848
Holy moly.

102
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,722
- Fun?
- No, no, it was terrible. Oh, yeah, it was fun.

103
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,605
Hot damn, it's a go-kart.

104
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,969
G-man, get over here.

105
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,162
- G-man, G-man, G-man.
- Uh-oh.

106
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,402
Oh, my God, my G-man. I love him.

107
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,410
Get in there. What?

108
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,283
What? What?
Get in there. Get in there.

109
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,126
Oh, man. I love you so much.

110
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,206
Tell Mr. Griswold how dope our go-kart is.

111
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,365
It's got a Zanardi chassis and
a four-stroke Briggs & Stratton engine.

112
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,723
- Wow, and you guys built this together?
- We worked on it every day...

113
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,248
...after homework and toothbrushing.
I love... Get over here, man.

114
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,482
Work it, Sugar Ray. Come on, Sugar Ray.

115
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,529
He's working me over.

116
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,490
I'm gonna eat your face!

117
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,005
Kevin, James, get over here.

118
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,247
No.

119
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,765
Come on, heh.
Oh, there you are.

120
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,684
- Dad, stop. What are you doing?
- Come on, man, we're sparring.

121
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,611
- We do this all the time.
- No. We never do this.

122
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,202
- Hey, don't hit your old man.
- I don't wanna be a part of this.

123
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,645
What are you doing?!

124
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,723
- This is how accidents happen.
- Sacrifice!

125
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,770
Dad, let go of me. Stop.
Why did you do that?

126
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,881
I'm sorry, man. Come on.
I was just fooling around.

127
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,769
- That wasn't fun.
- Like we always do.

128
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,331
We never do that.

129
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,324
Hey, what do you say
you and I build a go-kart together?

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,206
If we have to.

131
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,886
Yeah, all right, G-man, heh!

132
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,281
Get out of here. Get out of here, G-man.

133
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,447
Did you just steal my son's nickname?

134
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,447
I'm not sure about... Oh, shoot. Dang it.

135
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,082
Wow, your ring is getting loose,
there, Deb. Are you losing weight?

136
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,322
Yeah. I am. You know what I've been doing?

137
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,527
Spinning.

138
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,087
Yeah, it's a great stress reliever.

139
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,925
I'm gonna tell you what's
an even greater stress reliever.

140
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,889
And that is a week in Paris.

141
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,486
Oh, my gosh! I saw that on Instagram.

142
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,130
All your pictures were so great.

143
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,560
- So you did see them.
- Yeah.

144
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,008
Funny, because I was gonna ask
how come you didn't like any of them.

145
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,844
What do you mean? I just said I did.

146
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,970
All my other friends, uh, who saw my
Paris pics, they clicked "like."

147
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,925
You were the only one who
didn't click "like."

148
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,886
Oh. I guess I just didn't get around
to actually clicking "like" on them.

149
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,765
Okay, because look at this one.
Now, in this one we have...

150
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,167
...Sheila and Gary wearing berets.
- I know.

151
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,051
- Right?
- Heh. I like that one so much. It's so cute.

152
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,248
- But you didn't "like" it.
- Okay.

153
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,562
Here are the four of us
at the Arc de Triomphe.

154
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,560
Didn't "like" that. Didn't "like" my children.
Didn't "like" my man kissing on me.

155
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,327
I promise you the second you guys leave
I am gonna go upstairs online...

156
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,205
...and I am gonna click "like"
on every single one of them.

157
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,610
Honestly, honey, it really makes
no difference to me.

158
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,690
So are you guys going anywhere
special this summer?

159
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,842
No. I wish. Yeah. No.

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,801
We are renting the same cabin that we've been
renting for 10 years in Cheboygan, Michigan.

161
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,401
The boys call it "Che-boring," Michigan.

162
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,970
- Isn't that funny?
- Why don't you just go someplace else?

163
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,489
No, we can't. Rusty loves it so much. I'd break
his heart if I told him we hate the cabin.

164
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,211
- Oh, boy. I understand.
- Yeah.

165
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,849
I understand.
Well, you know what the good news is?

166
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,121
Hmm?

167
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,211
Honestly, even if you go there and you
don't have a great time, baby...

168
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,762
...at least you know
that I will click "like" on all your photos.

169
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,524
Jesus Christ, Nancy.

170
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,887
<i>Look!</i>

171
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,526
<i>Look!</i>

172
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,360
<i>What the fuck is this?!</i>

173
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,887
<i>Louie!</i>

174
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,049
<i>What the fuck is this?! Hey, madam.</i>

175
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,841
<i>How much capellini are you throwing away?!</i>

176
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,210
<i>What are you doing, Melinda?!
What are you doing?!</i>

177
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,125
Guys, I have exciting news.

178
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,407
James has AIDS?

179
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,528
What? No. That's horrible.

180
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,882
- I'd be excited.
- Well, what is it? What is it?

181
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,805
- The four of us are gonna take a little trip.
- Paris.

182
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,962
Hmm. No, much better.

183
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,249
We're driving to Walley World.

184
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,522
- What?
- This family's in a rut.

185
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,524
We gotta shake things up, right?
Spend a little quality time.

186
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,809
It wouldn't hurt for the boys
to learn to get along a little better.

187
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,361
- Uh, by locking them in a car together?
- Yeah.

188
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,966
- This is some bullshit right here!
- Hey, language.

189
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,164
Well, it is. I'm gonna miss the first
week of wrestling practice.

190
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,402
We'll find a wrestling range
along the way, heh.

191
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,971
That's not even a thing.

192
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,283
And, Dad, no offense,
I just don't wanna do my first big road trip...

193
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,363
...to some corporate theme park,
you know?

194
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,209
I'd like to explore the real America,
like Jack Kerouac or the Merry Pranksters.

195
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,522
- Don't say weird shit!
- Ah. Ow!

196
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,324
Kevin, bullying! Guys, come on.

197
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,723
My trip to Walley World when I was a kid
was the best time I ever had.

198
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,930
So you just wanna redo your vacation
from 30 years ago?

199
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,401
Don't you think that's gonna be
kind of a letdown?

200
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,962
No, no, no. We're not redoing anything.
This will be completely different.

201
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,444
For one thing, the original vacation had
a boy and a girl. This one has two boys.

202
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,366
And I'm sure that there will be lots
of other differences.

203
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,524
- I've never even heard of the original vacation.
- Doesn't matter.

204
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,684
The new vacation
will stand on its own, okay?

205
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,087
Come on, honey.

206
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,402
What do you say?
We can drive out and fly back.

207
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,249
Oh, what the heck, heh.

208
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,926
Couldn't be as bad as
that stupid cabin, right, honey?

209
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,491
- That's the spirit.
- All right.

210
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,284
Ugh. Fuck me.

211
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,807
Are we gonna drive all that way
in your little car?

212
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,965
Not exactly.

213
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,363
Come on, guys, heh. How come you didn't
follow me just then?

214
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,206
- Oh, you wanted us to?
- Yeah, that's why I dangled the key like that.

215
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,010
- Oh, well...
- Why else would I...?

216
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,003
You could've just said, "Come with me."

217
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,129
Look what your dad rented.

218
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,280
What the hell is that?

219
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,487
Kevin.

220
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,362
- That's a 2015 Tartan Prancer.
- Did you say "Tartan," honey?

221
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,409
Yeah. Tartan's the Honda of Albania.

222
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,329
Why'd you get an Albanian car, Dad?

223
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,687
Renting a family car
on Memorial Day weekend...

224
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,765
...doesn't leave you with a lot of options.
But this baby is pretty sweet.

225
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,481
It's got all the latest Albanian technology.
Check it out. Plug-in hybrid.

226
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,529
Oh, wow, eco-friendly. Good.

227
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,641
So any time we run out of juice,
we can just pull right over, and plug in.

228
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,689
I don't know what that is.

229
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,888
Never seen an outlet for that, heh.

230
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,366
Should it retract, or...?

231
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,205
You would think
it would retract. It just...

232
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,771
No, it doesn't.

233
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,291
Cupholder?

234
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,286
I think you coil it. You just coil it like that.
Right? Then you close it right up.

235
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,363
Doesn't matter. Still got two gas tanks.

236
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,887
- Why two?
- Carry twice as much gas.

237
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,601
- Why not just have one big tank?
- It's twice the gas, buddy.

238
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,603
Actually the same volume. Two small...

239
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,410
It has six ashtrays.

240
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,806
Six, wow.

241
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,803
Hope you guys like smoking.

242
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,444
- Right?
- Yeah.

243
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,489
What's with all the mirrors?

244
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,287
Safer.

245
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,171
But...

246
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,961
Oh. And this is amazing. I can control
the entire car from the fob.

247
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,164
- What do all the buttons mean?
- No clue. But we'll figure it out.

248
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,561
Honey, is that a swastika on there?

249
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,768
Yeah. We won't use that.

250
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,566
This is my favorite part.

251
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,204
- Slam the door on my arm.
- Heh. What?

252
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,887
It has a sensor. It won't let you
slam the door on your arm or leg.

253
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,850
- I'm not doing that.
- The rental guy showed me. Just do it.

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,365
- Okay.
- Do it!

255
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,171
- Do it.
- This is kind of fun.

256
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,367
Slam it.

257
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,721
All right. There you go.

258
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,491
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, my God!

259
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,130
- Oh, my gosh!
- Goddamn it!

260
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,130
Oh, my God! Why did you have me do that?!

261
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,443
Oh, I didn't have the sensor activated.

262
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,331
- Okay.
- I'm an idiot.

263
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,562
- Do it again.
- No, absolutely not.

264
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,087
- It'll be fine. I just activated it.
- I won't do it.

265
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,765
- Don't be chicken.
- Fine.

266
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,728
- Shit!
- Heh.

267
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,241
- Why did you do that?
- Really?

268
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,640
You're right. I'm sorry, heh.

269
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,481
- Ugh! Nobody slam their arm in the door.
- Can I slam it on James' balls?

270
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,206
- You admit I have balls?
- They hang out of your vagina.

271
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,442
- Stop that. Please.
- Plenty of time for that.

272
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,450
- Go get packed. We're hitting the road today.
- Okay.

273
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,080
Guess we're leaving today.
All right. Let's go, guys.

274
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,531
Huh.

275
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,650
Hey, honey. What's all that?

276
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,007
Well, uh, this is my dream journal...

277
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,491
...whimsy log...

278
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,880
...wish diary...

279
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,087
...my poems.

280
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,201
And, uh, this bad boy is going to be a
stream-of-consciousness travel log, so...

281
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,006
Yeah.

282
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,403
Come on, honey. Every boy that age
has a stack of diaries.

283
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,250
Okay, gang.

284
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,802
Seat belts on.

285
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,846
Two full tanks of gas.

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,331
Honey, GPS check?

287
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,806
Yes, yes. Roger that. Okay.

288
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,842
<i>Your destination is 2560 miles ahead.</i>

289
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,571
Walley World, here we come.

290
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,330
Well, we're almost out of gas.

291
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,362
What? How is that possible?
We've been driving for less than an hour.

292
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,322
Dad, what's so special about Walley World?

293
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,165
I mean, we have plenty of
theme parks at home.

294
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,281
Well, Walley World is home of
the one and only Velociraptor.

295
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,204
What the hell is that?

296
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,330
It's only the newest, scariest
roller coaster in the country.

297
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,645
Four hundred and fifty feet tall,
110 miles an hour...

298
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,962
...triple corkscrew loop.

299
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,050
Yeah. Oh, hey, look at this.

300
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,851
Looks like we got ourselves
a little old convoy.

301
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,365
Let's say hi.

302
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,406
- Oh, my goodness. It has a CB radio in it?
- Yeah, comes standard in all Prancers.

303
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,403
- This way we can talk to truckers.
- Okay.

304
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,040
Now, guys, you just have
to speak their lingo.

305
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,005
I'm gonna ask him if there's any
police up ahead.

306
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,123
Breaker 1-9 to Rubber Ducky.

307
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,806
You got any Smokey the Bears
in your kitchen? Over.

308
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,327
<i>You're clean and green
for the next 20 klicks.</i>

309
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,084
- Ha-ha. He replied!
- I know!

310
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,847
- What did that even mean?
- I have no idea, but who cares?

311
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,731
- He seems nice.
- He does seem nice, doesn't he?

312
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,723
Copy that, good buddy. Over.

313
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,087
- Can I try, Dad?
- Yeah, course.

314
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,049
When you finish talking, say "over."

315
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,850
- Okay. Cool.
- Okay.

316
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,087
Breaker 1-9, my friend Jessie says
all truck drivers are rapists.

317
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,004
- Are you a rapist?
- Kevin, no, no.

318
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,366
Sorry. Over.

319
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,522
- No, no, no.
- What are you doing?

320
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,286
- What? It's a question.
- Well, you're ruining it.

321
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,607
Sorry about that there, good buddy.

322
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,687
You know how little boys are
when their mouths get going, heh. I don't...

323
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,808
Not to imply that you are...

324
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,485
...fond of when little boys' mouths
get going in any way.

325
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,923
I am not suggesting that
you are a sex offender.

326
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,570
- Or a pedophile.
- Okay, no.

327
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,286
Yeah, so that's the CB radio, guys.

328
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,124
Neat, huh?

329
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,762
- Hey, Dad, what's a pedophile?
- Hmm. Well, Kevin, when a man and a boy...

330
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,208
- ...love each other very much...
- No. No.

331
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,682
- I have to piss.
- Me too.

332
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,888
Go with him, please,
and keep an eye on him.

333
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,371
- Okay.
- Thank you.

334
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,889
- Look at that. The boys are bonding already.
- Mm-hm.

335
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,445
Isn't this the best?

336
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,090
Yeah.

337
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,647
Do you remember, back when you were
just getting your pilot's license...

338
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,450
...and you and I would sit there...

339
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,128
...and we'd talk about all those, like,
overseas trips we would take and stuff?

340
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,361
Yeah, of course that's when I thought
I was gonna fly for one of the big guys.

341
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,444
I know it's not the most glamorous
airline, but Econo Air...

342
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,085
...it's been pretty good to us.

343
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,929
As far as I'm concerned, right here
with you and the boys, this is paradise.

344
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,683
- There was a hole in the side of my stall.
- You found a glory hole.

345
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,764
- Russ, no.
- All right, let's hit the road.

346
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,488
Go to sleep! Go to sleep!

347
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,162
- What's wrong with you?!
- I wanted to see...

348
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,164
...how long you could
hold your breath before you black out.

349
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,766
Don't do that. I could have died.

350
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,285
Whatever.

351
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,002
Goddamn it. Kevin!

352
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,248
Hey, honey, Why'd we get off the highway?

353
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,609
Thought it would be fun for the kids
to see where you went to college.

354
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,684
Oh, God. Why would that be fun
for them, honey?

355
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,810
You could give us a tour.
One of them could study there one day.

356
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,002
Oh, no. No way, man.

357
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,004
I've got my sights set on something
a little more Ivy League.

358
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,527
Oh. Little fucker.

359
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,246
- What, Ma?
- I love you. That's what I said.

360
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,084
- I love you too.
- I said, I love you.

361
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,810
Let's just see how far it is.

362
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:42,041
<i>- You are 9.2 miles from destination.</i>
- All right. Check the best route.

363
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,691
Oh, I changed the language.

364
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,211
That's not it, heh.

365
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,286
What is that?

366
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,163
- Uh, I don't know. Korean?
- Oh, God, it's horrible. Just please turn it off.

367
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,051
The menu's all in Korean now.
I don't know what to press.

368
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,282
Why is it so much angrier
than the other voices?

369
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,520
Why don't we just...?

370
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,166
Honey, it doesn't like
when you touch it, okay?

371
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,891
Just leave it alone. Let it calm down.

372
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,844
Wow, this place has not changed a bit.

373
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,402
- Isn't that sorority row?
- Hmm.

374
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,130
Let's go check out your house.

375
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,449
Oh, no, honey. Don't you think we
should get back on the road?

376
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,682
No, come on. It'll be fun.

377
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,081
It's just a boring old house.

378
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,005
Yeah, that's what's up.

379
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,004
I cannot believe that they
are still doing this.

380
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,211
What is it?

381
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,211
Uh, it is the Tri-Pi Chug Run.

382
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,562
You have to chug a big pitcher of beer...

383
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,769
...and then you have to get through
the course as fast as you can.

384
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,321
And you did this?
Because you hardly drink.

385
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,881
No, yeah. But, honey,
it's for charity, see?

386
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,331
Hi. Would you like to donate
to ass burgers?

387
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,284
Oh, no. We're just stopping by.

388
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,602
I was a Tri-Pi a long time ago, so...

389
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,327
In fact, the Chug Run was my idea.

390
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,608
- It was?
- Yeah.

391
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,049
- Wait, are you Debbie Fletcher?
- Yeah.

392
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,721
Oh, my shit.

393
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,008
Oh, my shit! I can't believe it's you!

394
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,401
Guys, come here! Bring over the book!

395
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,524
- It's Debbie fucking Fletcher.
- How do you know who I am?

396
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,650
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?
You're like a legend at Tri-Pi.

397
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,565
- You're Debbie Do-Anything!
- Debbie Do-Anything?

398
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,768
- Go play.
- Yeah, look.

399
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,844
- See?
- Oh, God.

400
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,083
- Is it true you climbed the clock tower naked?
- Of course not.

401
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,402
Did you really show your tits
to anyone who asked?

402
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,642
- Honey, we should go.
- Hang on.

403
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,725
- I heard you stuck a finger in the dean's dick.
- Did you really burn down Taco Bell?

404
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,524
I heard you fucked Anthony Hopkins.

405
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,967
I heard that, if people bop you
on your head...

406
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,043
...gold coins come out of your butt.

407
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,043
- Okay, ladies, heh.
- What?

408
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,806
I think I know my wife pretty well, and she
wouldn't have done any of those things.

409
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,090
But you know what? What's important is not
whether I did them or I didn't do them.

410
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,847
What's important is that you guys are
idolizing very bad behavior here.

411
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,731
Uh, ew, you don't sound
like Debbie Do-Anything.

412
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,450
I had a feeling she was all hype.

413
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,682
Bet she didn't even come up
with the Chug Run.

414
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,444
Hey, wait a minute. Excuse me.

415
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,763
I did come up with the Chug Run, all right?

416
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,001
And I ran it.

417
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,520
- Sure you did.
- No, I did.

418
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,404
- In 16 seconds, okay?
- Okay, hon.

419
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,480
- Prove it.
- She can't do it now. She's old.

420
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,721
Excuse me, girl?

421
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,526
I didn't mean it like that.
I just mean... you're old.

422
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,161
Oh, yeah.

423
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,891
Never heard that laugh before.
I don't like it.

424
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,121
Hold my bag. Uh-uh.

425
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,568
Why? You're not actually
going on this thing.

426
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,202
Yes, I am. This Chug Run raised
thousands of dollars for charity, all right?

427
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,166
I might not have gotten good grades while
I was here, but at least I did something.

428
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,762
It sounds like you did a lot.
You stuck your finger in the dean's penis.

429
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,130
It's not important what I stuck my finger in
and what I burnt down. What is important...

430
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,250
- ...is that these bitches are disrespecting me.
- "Bitches"?

431
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,606
Bring it on.

432
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,528
No one's calling me old. Fuck you.

433
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,729
All right, boobs, pitcher. Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.

434
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,881
Tri-Pi, motherfuckers!

435
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,644
Oh, Jesus Christ.

436
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,330
Three! Two! One!

437
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,165
Oh, honey.

438
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,000
What's Mom doing?

439
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,891
She's, uh, teaching
these bitches a lesson.

440
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,244
This is the best thing I've ever seen.

441
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,721
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

442
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,046
Why is she puking so much?

443
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,164
It's for ass burgers.

444
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,687
Tri-Pi, motherfuckers.

445
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,926
Mom, you should try and stay hydrated.

446
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,971
What? What are you doing?

447
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,730
How about some tunes?

448
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,801
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

449
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,724
I love this song.

450
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,645
Guys, it's Seal.

451
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,083
Heh. Everybody sing it with me.

452
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,571
<i>There used to be a graying tower
Alone on the sea</i>

453
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,767
Come on, guys.

454
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:08,609
<i>You became
The light on the dark side of me</i>

455
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,000
Deb?

456
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,649
<i>Love remained
A drug that's the high and not...</i>

457
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,847
Guys? No?

458
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,168
<i>Did you know that when it snows</i>

459
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,520
Kevin? James?

460
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,846
<i>My eyes become large</i>

461
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,365
Is this a man or a woman singing?

462
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,171
It's a man. And the coolest man ever.

463
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,810
He overcame lupus.

464
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,286
<i>Baby I compare you to
a kiss from a rose on the gray</i>

465
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,205
I can't believe
no one in this family wants to sing.

466
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,522
<i>...stranger it feels, yeah.</i>

467
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,960
<i>Batman Forever?</i>

468
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,526
<i>...that your rose is in bloom</i>

469
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,806
Val Kilmer.

470
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,442
<i>A light hits the gloom on the gray</i>

471
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,440
He's come back to kill us.

472
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,483
- Gun it, Russ!
- Gunning it.

473
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,640
You gotta go faster, Dad!
Go faster!

474
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,240
- The Prancer doesn't go any faster!
- What do we do?!

475
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,209
Maybe if I press this rabbit button...

476
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,806
- ...it'll give it a boost or something.
- Yes, try it.

477
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,651
- Why is there a button for that?
- And why is it a rabbit?

478
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,881
Okay...

479
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,929
- Uh, rocket. Here you go. Try that.
- Yes.

480
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,647
What? What's happening?

481
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,404
- Why am I swiveling?
- I don't know!

482
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,050
- Grab the wheel!
- It won't stop!

483
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,124
- Hit the gas! Hit the gas!
- Okay, I'm trying to hit...

484
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,249
We're gonna die!

485
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,723
- Okay, I got the wheel. I got the wheel.
- Okay, okay.

486
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,845
Okay, what are we gonna do?

487
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,929
- I have an idea.
- What?

488
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,770
- Handbrake turn.
- What?

489
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,931
Pull the wheel left, yank the handbrake,
do a 180, cross the median, drive past him.

490
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,686
- You know how, Dad?
- If Vin Diesel can do it, so can I.

491
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,002
- Why are you as good as Vin Diesel?
- Hang on.

492
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,927
That's not what I was trying to do.

493
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,481
- Everybody okay?
- Oh, shit!

494
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,603
- Go, Dad! Go, go!
- Oh, my God.

495
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,050
- Oh, shit!
- Goddamn it.

496
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,491
All right, boys. This is you.

497
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,166
- I call both beds.
- You get one bed.

498
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,527
If you need anything, Mom and I
are next door.

499
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,729
Oh, uh, I think I saw a hot tub, Dad.
Is it okay if I take a soak?

500
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,204
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

501
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,522
But if anyone tries to
shove you in their car...

502
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,808
...give them a good scratch
like I showed you.

503
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,007
- I will.
- All right.

504
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,321
- Attaboy.
- Thanks.

505
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,530
So...

506
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,282
...how come you never told me about
the whole Debbie Do-Anything thing?

507
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,528
Heh. Come on, that was so long ago.

508
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,126
Yeah, but it's part of who you are...

509
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,964
...and I wanna know all about you.

510
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,363
All right. Well, that's fair.
What do you wanna know?

511
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,522
How many guys did you sleep with
before me?

512
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,250
No, no, no.

513
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,129
- No, no, no.
- Oh, come on.

514
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,203
Come on. That's not important.

515
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,886
- No, I know. But I'm just...
- You really need to know?

516
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,730
- It just...
- Oh, okay.

517
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,684
- I'm just curious.
- Okay, okay.

518
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,481
Um, let's see.

519
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,681
And then...

520
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,124
Kind of taking you a little while, heh.

521
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,681
Okay, uh, so around...

522
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,360
- Th...
- Three.

523
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,204
Three. That's actually reassuring,
because, heh, it's the same as me.

524
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,721
No, didn't say three.

525
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,489
Thirteen? Thirteen?

526
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,802
- Nope.
- And it's not three?

527
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,200
It's around 30.

528
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,725
Thirty! Phew.

529
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,571
Wow, holy cow.

530
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,485
See, now I feel like you're judging me.

531
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,880
I'm Judging me.

532
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,407
- Your number is so much higher than mine.
- Yes, it is a big number...

533
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,166
...but it doesn't matter.
Honey, it doesn't matter.

534
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,085
You're so cool. I feel like a loser.

535
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,720
You are not a loser, okay?

536
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,885
Yeah? Because, uh, I had to work
pretty hard just to get those three.

537
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,601
Had to take care of Jenny's grandfather
for months before she slept with me.

538
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,445
- And he was racist.
- Please, don't base it on me.

539
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,170
I was, like, crazy back then.

540
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,728
I was completely immature and acting out...

541
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,645
...and just really, like,
free with my body...

542
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,962
...and that's just not who I am anymore.

543
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,525
That's not who we are.

544
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,365
Well, we're pretty free with our bodies.

545
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,931
But you have to admit...

546
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,168
...I feel like we've gotten...

547
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,283
...like, less free with our bodies.

548
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,647
But we have sex every week
with our bodies.

549
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,330
We do. But...

550
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,689
I mean, it's gotten a little routine, babe.

551
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,050
You know, you always are lighting
that same Yankee Candle and everything.

552
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,206
And I don't know, it might be nice to mix
it up a little bit every once in a while.

553
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,521
Okay? No big deal.

554
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,648
I'm gonna go take a shower, okay?

555
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,689
I'm gonna take one with you.

556
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,684
- Hmm?
- Uh... We'll have sex in it.

557
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,444
Yeah. In the shower.

558
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,762
How's that for getting free
with our bodies, Debbie Do-Anything?

559
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,524
- I like that.
- Yeah.

560
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,250
Oh, Russ.

561
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,488
Just be careful not to drop the soap.

562
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,971
Oh, I won't.

563
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,521
What?

564
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,443
- This is fun and different.
- I know. It is.

565
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,570
You are so cute when you get
excited about stuff.

566
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,167
You're, like, so cute always.

567
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,641
Aw, honey.

568
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,610
Oh, my... Holy shit! Are those mushrooms?!

569
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,886
Looks like somebody...

570
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,929
- ...blew their head off in there.
- Oh, God.

571
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,450
So should we, uh...?

572
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,329
Should we get in or...?

573
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,249
No, right, heh?

574
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,007
Yeah. I'm gonna see if there's
something to clean that with.

575
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,242
Hmm. Maybe the housekeeping left a...

576
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,244
Oh, well, here's a Brillo Pad.

577
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,811
I'll just...

578
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,450
- Russ.
- Yeah.

579
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,886
That's not a Brillo Pad.

580
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,326
It's a ball of pubic hair.

581
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,644
- Oh, my gosh.
- There's so much of it.

582
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,043
Who has that much pubic hair?
It's not even possible.

583
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,567
No, not one person.
That's all different colors.

584
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,602
That's from like 30 different guys.

585
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,444
Oh, shut up, Russ.

586
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,051
No. I'm sorry.

587
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,044
<i>Through the curtains hanging in the window</i>

588
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,245
<i>In the evening on a Friday night</i>

593
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,727
You're pretty good.

594
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,687
Jeez, sorry.

595
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,161
I, uh, heh, didn't mean to scare you.

596
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,649
- Hi.
- Hi.

597
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,122
- You were in the Jeep.
- And you were in that plastic bag.

598
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,928
That was my stupid brother.

599
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,923
Gotcha. Big brothers suck.

600
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,161
Oh, no.

601
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,641
Yeah, big, heh.

602
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,961
I'm Adena.

603
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,846
James.

604
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,008
- I have a penis.
- What?

605
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,685
It's on your guitar.

606
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,202
- Same brother.
- What an asshole.

607
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,964
Yeah.

608
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,804
You wanna go in?

609
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,325
Absolutely.

610
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,243
Well, what have we here?

611
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,607
Little Romeo and Juliet situation?

612
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,920
My name's Russ. Pleased to meet you both.

613
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,482
I'm just a stranger, passing through town.

614
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,247
But I couldn't help noticing how
incredibly handsome this young man is.

615
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,243
What's your story? You got a girlfriend?

616
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,686
No.

617
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,569
What? No girlfriend?

618
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,047
Cute boy like that?
Somebody's gonna snatch you up.

619
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,884
- Do you want me to call the cops?
- No.

620
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,605
And he plays guitar?

621
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,171
Dream boy.

622
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,086
- Make a muscle.
- I'd...

623
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,400
- Do it.
- ...rather not.

624
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,204
Take your shirt off. Make a muscle.

625
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,169
- I really don't want to.
- Don't be shy.

626
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,200
- Show us what you're working with.
- All right.

627
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,965
Um, I should go.

628
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,648
Are you sure that you'll be okay?

629
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,040
I think so.

630
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,611
Okay.

631
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,646
Bye.

632
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,287
Dang it.

633
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,644
- Dad, why would you do that?
- Saw you talking to her.

634
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,883
- Figured you could use a wingman.
- I didn't need a wingman.

635
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,761
- Well, heh, looks like you did. She left.
- That's because you were approaching...

636
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,968
You know, James, when I was your age...

637
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,643
...Grandpa Clark sat me down
and we had a little chat.

638
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,044
Seeing you with that girl made me
realize that we haven't had that chat yet.

639
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,690
- We don't need that chat.
- Yeah?

640
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,248
Come on, I know it's embarrassing,
but it'd be a lot more embarrassing...

641
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,244
...if you found yourself tummy to tummy
with a lady friend...

642
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,244
...and didn't know what goes where.
- I know what goes where.

643
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,526
- You do?
- Uh-huh.

644
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,966
- You sure?
- Yep.

645
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,964
All right, all right.
Well, I just want you to know...

646
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,170
...I'm here to answer any questions
you might have about that stuff.

647
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,840
No matter how uncomfortable it seems.

648
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,405
Yeah, okay.

649
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,609
- Yeah, right. Here it comes.
- Yeah. All right. Okay.

650
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,688
Uh, there were some kids at school
who were talking about...

651
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,921
...rim jobs.

652
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,323
- Hmm.
- So, what's that? What's a rim job?

653
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,443
- Rim jobs.
- Yeah.

654
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,161
- Is that R-I-M?
- Mm-hm.

655
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,643
Rim job. Country of origin.

656
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,207
I don't know. Um, America.

657
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,010
Can I hear it in a sentence?

658
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,248
- What's a rim job, Dad?
- Oh.

659
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,042
Well, rim job.

660
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,927
I would guess a rim job is when you
kiss someone with your mouth closed.

661
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,731
Right? So you're only using
the rim of your mouth.

662
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,891
- That's it?
- Sure.

663
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,169
It felt like it was something way dirtier.

664
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,288
No, I mean, what else could it be?

665
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,326
Any other questions?

666
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,084
I guess not.

667
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,645
Good talk, James.

668
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,165
Now, I hope you're not too old
to let your dad give you...

669
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,810
...a good-night rim job.

670
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,251
Looks like we might get to
Aunt Audrey's before dinner.

671
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,004
Will Uncle Stone be there?

672
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,242
Yeah, I suppose he will.

673
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,563
- Uncle Stone is cool.
- You have to be cool to be a celebrity.

674
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,009
Heh. He's not exactly a celebrity.

675
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,208
I mean, he's a local weatherman.
That's all.

676
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,204
Uh, actually, Audrey said that
the networks are interested in him.

677
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,407
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

678
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,965
All right. Well, good for him.

679
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,488
- Think Uncle Stone will let me ride his horse?
- I don't see why not.

680
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,007
- Do you think I can shoot his guns?
- No, you cannot.

681
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,281
Too bad. I would've shot you
right off that fucking horse.

682
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,603
I never would've imagined my sister
marrying such a conservative.

683
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,287
Yeah, but just because Stone's
political beliefs are different than ours...

684
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,727
...doesn't mean he's not good-looking. I...

685
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,649
A good person.

686
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,331
- You said it.
- Uh, honey...

687
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,527
Hey, look at that!

688
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,490
Hot springs up ahead.
We've always wanted to do that.

689
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,762
Oh, honey,
we don't wanna be late to Audrey's.

690
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,082
So we're a few minutes late.

691
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,040
We're on vacation. Right? Come on.
Let's have some fun.

692
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,807
Okay.

693
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,808
- Oh. Look at the line.
- This will take forever.

694
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,282
Come on, guys. How often do we get
to soak in hot water?

695
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,930
Every time we take a bath.

696
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,528
No, this is different, okay?
This is natural.

697
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,160
This water was heated
in Mother Nature's bowels.

698
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,651
Oh. Gross.

699
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,088
There's gotta be another way in.

700
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,725
I'm gonna ask this gentleman.
I bet he'd know.

701
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,365
Excuse me, sir.

702
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,851
- Hi there.
- Hey. Hi.

703
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,170
Hey, we were wondering. ls there
another entrance to the hot springs?

704
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,561
Like a secret entrance the locals use?

705
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,884
- Line can get pretty long this time of year, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, it sure can.

706
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,451
Yeah, I'll tell you what you'll do.

707
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,683
Uh, can you see that dirt road?
That path there on the left?

708
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,446
- Yeah.
- If you just follow that all the way up...

709
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,443
...that'll take you to the hot springs.

710
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,489
All right, perfect. Thank you.

711
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,610
Oh, no, no. You bet.
Y'all have a good time.

712
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,728
- Oh, will do, heh.
- Heh.

713
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,490
Hey, what's your pet rat's name?

714
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,324
Is my pet what?

715
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,246
What the fuck? What the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

716
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,761
I don't know him.

717
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,166
Honey, are you sure about this?
I mean, nobody else is going this way.

718
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,810
Yeah, well, most people think
inside the box.

719
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,681
But you know who thinks outside the box?

720
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,683
Uncle Stone?

721
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,491
Me. Your father.

722
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,242
Um, honey, I don't see any hot springs.

723
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,324
Well, the guy said it was
right at the end of this road, so...

724
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,690
Well, the guy also did not know he had
a rat on his shoulder, so there's that.

725
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,927
Hold on.

726
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,280
Wow, honey, this is beautiful.

727
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,886
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

728
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,605
All right, everyone.

729
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,240
In your bathing suits. Now! Heh.

730
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,366
Looks like we found our
own private hot spring.

731
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,602
- I say we call it "Griswold Springs."
- Heh.

732
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,371
- The water's perfect.
- Oh, my God. It's so nice.

733
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,284
Why does it smell like rotten eggs?

734
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,920
- That's the sulfur, buddy. It's natural.
- Yeah.

735
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,162
Yeah. And it's really good for you too.

736
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,051
Actually, the minerals that are
in this mud here...

737
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,123
...they draw toxins out of your body.

738
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,807
Can you believe that?

739
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,121
Cool, right?

740
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,247
Oh, wow.

741
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,567
Mm. This is perfect.

742
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,644
It's exactly what we needed.

743
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,041
Oh, yeah. Good call, Griswold.

744
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,882
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

745
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,281
- Oh, yeah. That's it.
- That's it. That's it.

746
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,966
I can feel my body detoxifying.

747
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,207
You know...

748
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,767
...it tastes a little shitty, but I think
that's part of it. That's okay.

749
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,485
This is wonderful.

750
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,682
That is the stuff.

751
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,761
What is that, honey?

752
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,843
On your ear. What's on your ear?

753
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,241
What is that?

754
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,966
It's an ear!

755
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,009
Look, James. Found a dart.

756
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,565
Are you crazy?

757
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,326
Oh, my God!
Everybody out of Griswold Springs!

758
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,448
- Get out of the poop!
- That was nasty!

759
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,687
All over me!

760
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,089
I don't like Griswold Springs.

761
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,487
Is that our car alarm?

762
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,721
What?

763
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,689
Ugh. How come that local guy didn't tell us
there are thieves in these woods?

764
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,927
Oh, right.

765
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,407
He took my guitar.

766
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,449
Oh, my God. He took all our money, Russ.

767
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,369
All right, not a best-case scenario.

768
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,851
But, hey.

769
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,604
He left your book.

770
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,128
So, I guess we get the last laugh.

771
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,327
Oh, really, honey?

772
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,727
We're naked and covered in human waste.

773
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,884
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
We don't know that it's human.

774
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,290
This is so embarrassing.
I feel like your cousin Eddie's family.

775
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,081
It's no big deal. We'll just tell
Stone and Audrey what happened.

776
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,810
Kids, remember what happened?

777
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,401
We pulled over to rescue a baby
from a burning car...

778
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,564
...and somebody stole all of our stuff
while we were distracted.

779
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,331
And why are we naked
and covered in feces?

780
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,005
I don't remember.

781
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,481
That's right. We don't remember.

782
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,565
Oh, my God.

783
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,569
Oh, come on.

784
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,490
- What're we gonna do?
- Can you give me a hand with this? Please?

785
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,246
Just... Yeah.

786
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,925
Oh, gosh.

787
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,526
- I can't. I can't get it off.
- Just use your spit.

788
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,846
Oh, okay.

789
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,601
Focus on the balls.

790
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,922
If you guys wanna stop, that'd be good too.

791
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,167
Stay on the balls. I've got the shaft.

792
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,201
Hi, y'all!

793
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,644
Hey. Oh, my goodness. Hi.

794
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,165
What happened?

795
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,086
Well, that's a...

796
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,009
It's a crazy story...

797
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,889
Dad got scammed by a guy at a park.

798
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,247
- Kevin.
- Same old Rusty.

799
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,890
You'd buy water from a faucet.

800
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,128
Anyway, you guys look disgusting.

801
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,681
I have some clothes
I was gonna give to the church...

802
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,928
...if you guys wanna borrow some of those.

803
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,570
- Great. Thank you, Audrey.
- Yeah.

804
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,728
- Come on inside.
- All right.

805
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,609
Boy, y'all stink.

806
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,129
Oh, I don't like that.

807
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,323
Man, this place makes our house
look like shit.

808
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,845
Well, Kevin, that's only because a dollar goes
much further out here than it does in Chicago.

809
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,131
Especially when you make a
lot more of them, heh.

810
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,440
Just messing with you.

811
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,683
Shoot, you boys are growing faster
than a weed under a faucet.

812
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,605
- You still rassling, son?
- Uh-huh.

813
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,484
Uh-huh. Oh, come on.
Show me what you got.

814
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,331
- Hey, Kevin. Get off your brother, please.
- They're just having themselves a rassle.

815
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,529
- It's what brothers do.
- Hey, oh, look at you guys.

816
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,167
Hot damn. Debbie Griswold.
You just keep getting prettier.

817
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,482
- Oh, stop.
- No, I mean it.

818
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,890
You could make hot water
come out of the cold faucet.

819
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,530
Oh, heh. That's very sweet.

820
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,286
You know, I remember the night
you first wore that dress.

821
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,721
- You remember that night?
- I remember that night.

822
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,645
- I'll never forget that night.
- Neither will I, baby.

823
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,131
You're my fucking husband.

824
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,368
Oh, betcha, I am. I'm your caveman.

825
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,649
I'll rip you in half.

826
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,648
I wanna have all your babies.

827
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,928
On, baby.

828
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,326
I hit the fucking jackpot with you.

829
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,403
Oh, God, what I'm gonna do
to you tonight.

830
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,401
Who wants to see Stone's man cave?

831
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,527
Yeah.

832
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,165
Is this Charlton Heston?

833
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,322
Yep, Chuck was a good friend.

834
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,729
I can't tell you how many nights
we spent drinking bourbon together...

835
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,848
...crying about the state of this country.

836
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,606
It's true, they did.
They literally cried together.

837
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,843
Hmm. Somehow I don't see you
crying, though, Stone.

838
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,525
Yeah, that's, uh...

839
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,489
That's kind of embarrassing, right?

840
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,930
Not embarrassing to me.

841
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,169
Even the strongest faucet
sometimes lets out a few drops, heh.

842
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,561
What is with these faucets?

843
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,404
Everyone thought that F-4 twister...

844
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,006
- ...was gonna bypass Harris County.
- Not my Stone.

845
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,882
I had a feeling that that low-pressure system
was gonna make a beeline for Mission Bend.

846
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,605
Thanks to my report, those people had
an extra 15 minutes to evacuate.

847
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,168
- Ah.
- Governor Perry said he saved 2000 lives.

848
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,130
That's how many we lost at Pearl Harbor...

849
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,489
...so basically he stopped Pearl Harbor.

850
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,371
That's when the national news called.
Now, between us...

851
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,040
...it's looking good. Ain't it, honey?

852
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,521
Course none of that would've been
possible without my sugar mama here...

853
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,524
...working day and night to put me
through meteorology school.

854
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,809
I liked working, baby.
I didn't mind it one bit.

855
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,082
Well, you never have to
do it again, darling.

856
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,890
But it kind of gave me purpose.

857
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,849
Nope, never again. That is a promise.

858
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,046
Wow, Uncle Stone, I may not agree
with your politics...

859
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,249
- ...but that doesn't mean I don't admire you.
- Well, thank you.

860
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,291
But the man you should admire the most
is sitting right next to you.

861
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,524
But there's nobody there.

862
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,160
Oh, I don't mean that chair.
I mean your pa right here.

863
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,560
Okay, heh.

864
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,768
- He doesn't save anybody's life.
- Doesn't he?

865
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,525
Well, every time he flies that little plane
of his, he's saving lives by not crashing.

866
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,806
And in my book...

867
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,646
...that makes him a hero.

868
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,761
Thank you.
You know, a lot of people actually...

869
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,323
Not to mention, he also snagged himself
one sweet slice of foxy pie in your mama there.

870
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,484
You gotta stop that today. Stop it.

871
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,046
You know what I always wanted
to know was...

872
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,803
...when did you first know the weather?

873
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,207
You all right, Deb?

874
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,323
- What?
- Hey, there's a cow.

875
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,564
Oh, not a cow. That's a steer.

876
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,770
That there is $6000 worth of juicy,
purebred Angus beef.

877
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,443
It's Stone's new passion, raising cattle.
He's even named them.

878
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,087
Uh-huh.
Old Sebastian here loves him some ribs.

879
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,441
Here you go, boy.

880
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,762
Yeah. Oh, that's it.

881
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,130
- Dad, isn't that...?
- Cannibalism? Yeah.

882
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,126
You boys get up early tomorrow, you can watch
me herd these suckers into the corral.

883
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,163
- Oh!
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

884
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,731
You herd them yourself?

885
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,490
Heh, I'm a man, aren't I?

886
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,051
Yes.

887
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,687
Uh, hey, Stone, not sure if you need
a hand out there, but I'd love to help.

888
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,128
Sure thing. If you're up for it
I can always use an extra set of hands.

889
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,762
Well, I was born with
an extra set of hands.

890
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,523
That's an odd thing to say, heh.

891
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,447
But I reckon this'll be
the highlight of your trip.

892
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,207
Well, the real highlight, of course,
will be when we get to Walley World...

893
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,405
...and I take my family
on the Velociraptor.

894
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,246
I think it is so weird. I don't know
why you want to go back to Walley World...

895
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,845
...after Dad flipped out there.

896
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,170
Audrey, Dad flipped out because
he loved us and wanted us to be close.

897
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,130
And we were.
And that's all I want for my family.

898
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,444
You're such a clown.

899
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,965
You're a clown.

900
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,929
Babe, baby, I think Rusty's right.

901
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,483
You know, family is the most
important thing there is.

902
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,489
Little something...

903
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,721
Maybe we'll take baby Cooper
on a trip this summer.

904
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,166
Yeah, not to Walley World.

905
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,010
- Oh, God, no.
- Because that'd be stupid.

906
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,367
That'd be stupid.
How about Paris?

907
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,210
And then we get back
I can maybe get a part-time job?

908
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,284
Well, not while there's breath
in my body, sweetheart.

909
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,691
You know, honey, I am really happy
for your sister.

910
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,927
- Yeah?
- Seriously.

911
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,924
She and Stone seem really in love.
It's nice.

912
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,084
These pants Stone gave me are really
stretched out in the crotch.

913
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,402
Weird. Why would they be
stretched out in the...?

914
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,210
- God, I don't know.
- Holy shit.

915
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,647
How much you think they paid
for this house?

916
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,442
Whoa. Oh, okay, whoa.

917
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,762
Oh, should I see if Audrey has
a Yankee Candle?

918
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,571
Fuck the Yankee Candle.
I wanna do this now.

919
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,963
- Oh, God, you're so sexy. Oh, my God.
- Oh, what has gotten into you?

920
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,446
What? What, what?

921
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,885
This is because of him, isn't it?

922
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,411
What? Who?

923
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,810
Because of who?

924
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,331
Because of Stone.

925
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,801
- What?
- That's why you're jumping my bones.

926
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,048
- You're thinking of him.
- That's ridiculous.

927
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,248
Then how come the one night
we're with him...

928
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,883
- ...you turn into some kind of sexual character?
- I don't know where you're going with this...

929
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,407
- Where's your wedding ring?
- Oh, my God.

930
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,927
Before we got here, you took off
your wedding ring?

931
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,048
No, I didn't, Rusty. It was loose.

932
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,645
You remember how loose it was?

933
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,882
And I must've just dropped it somewhere.

934
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,089
What was the plan? Show up
with no ring, he'll think you're single?

935
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,891
How will he think I'm single
if I'm here with my husband?

936
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,724
I don't know. It was your plan.

937
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,962
It was not my pl... Okay.

938
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,371
Yes, Stone is an impressive man, okay?

939
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,449
But I married you, Rusty.

940
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,841
And I am so sorry that I lost my ring...

941
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,931
...but I would never, ever, ever
take it off on purpose.

942
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,961
I know, I know. I just...

943
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,766
I freaked out. I'm sorry. I just...

944
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,320
We'll get you another ring.

945
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,170
I liked that one.

946
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,324
Hey, y'all decent?

947
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,931
- Yes. Hi.
- Hey.

948
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,846
Okay. Just wanted to make sure y'all
had everything you needed for the night.

949
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,686
Yep.

950
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,806
All right.

951
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,769
Man, it sure is beautiful here
this time of year, ain't it?

952
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,121
And quiet. Listen.

953
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,211
You hear that?

954
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,801
- No.
- Exactly. It's perfect silence.

955
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,240
Hmm.

956
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,082
Yeah, yeah.

957
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,165
Well, uh, TV remote.
Okay, let me show you.

958
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,448
I've got, uh, channels...

959
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,051
...and the volume.

960
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,565
On. Off.

961
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,003
- Pretty straightforward.
- Yeah.

962
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,367
- Yeah.
- Great.

963
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,567
All right.

964
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,520
Well, uh, if you get thirsty,
there's fresh milk in the fridge...

965
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,684
...and have yourselves a good night.

966
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,968
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

967
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,322
- Night, Stone.
- Good night, Stone.

968
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,166
Man.

969
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,251
Yeah.

970
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,521
Okay.

971
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,250
He totally just came in here
to show off his six-pack.

972
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,691
Hey, morning.

973
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,882
Ugh, barely.

974
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,769
How come you gotta do this at 6 a.m.?

975
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,127
Well, I gotta be at the station by 7:30...

976
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,931
...for Stone Crandall's AccuWeather Report.

977
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,603
Hey, you ever ride one of these things?

978
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,011
No, never have.

979
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:57,882
But, uh, can't imagine it's more
complicated than an Airbus A318.

980
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,566
Heh, yeah, well, that's the spirit.

981
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,042
Now, the key here is to move
back and forth along the edge of the herd.

982
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,329
You keep your distance, though.
You don't want to spook them.

983
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,130
Got it.

984
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,645
Okay.

985
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,801
Are there helmets?

986
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,442
Yeah, I keep them with the tampons.

987
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,445
Just basic safety.

988
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,285
This is exciting!

989
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,211
It's my favorite way to start the day.

990
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,449
This, and making love to your sister.

991
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,320
Thank you for that.

992
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,491
Come on, let's go!

993
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,527
It looks like we got us
a couple of mavericks.

994
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,524
You take the one on the left.
I'll take the one on the right.

995
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,523
Unless you need my help with yours.

996
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,125
No, I think I got it.

997
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,328
Last one to the corral's
a rotten cowpoke.

998
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,885
Let's go!

999
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,122
Go! Get up! Get up! Get up! Let's go!

1000
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,847
Whoa!

1001
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,526
Hey!

1002
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,160
Holy shit!

1003
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,961
Oh, my gosh!

1004
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,810
Is the cow okay?

1005
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,083
No, the cow's not okay, Russ.
You drove plumb through him.

1006
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,810
Oh, no, Sebastian.

1007
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,611
Gross.

1008
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,846
Hey, gang, uh...

1009
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,921
Maybe for lunch we could find
a burger place.

1010
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,964
You know, like a, uh...

1011
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,246
Like a drive-through burger place.

1012
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,527
I don't know, Dad. I think we should, uh...

1013
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,921
...steer clear of that.

1014
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,726
- Good one, James.
- All right, enough, you guys.

1015
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,327
Dad hit a cow, okay? Let's just move on.

1016
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,968
- Oh, I got one.
- Yeah? Let's hear it.

1017
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,442
James is a piece of shit.

1018
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,682
You kind of missed the point there, buddy.

1019
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,765
- Hey, hey.
- What? What is it? What's wrong?

1020
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,126
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

1021
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,770
- No, nothing's wrong.
- Okay.

1022
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,968
- Well, what?
- I have an idea.

1023
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,130
And it's gonna sound crazy,
but hear me out, okay?

1024
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,930
- Okay.
- Okay.

1025
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,007
We're right near
the Four Corners Monument...

1026
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,084
...which is where four states
come together in one spot.

1027
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,846
- So?
- Let's go have sex on it.

1028
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,521
What? Heh.

1029
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,486
Yeah, that way we can make love in
four states at the same time.

1030
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,721
Wait.

1031
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,730
You're serious?

1032
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,489
Yeah. I mean, you're the one who
said we should mix it up.

1033
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,644
What's more mixed-up than sex
on a public monument?

1034
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,682
Um, pretty sure Debbie Do-Anything
would do it.

1035
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,962
Okay, well, Debbie Do-Anything
was a dumbass.

1036
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,168
Maybe that's what we need.

1037
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,402
To be dumbasses together.

1038
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,050
What about the kids?

1039
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,450
Well, Kevin's kind of a dumbass.

1040
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,766
No, no, honey.

1041
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,002
What are we gonna do about them?

1042
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,442
They're fine. They're fast asleep.

1043
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,967
We'll be back
before they know we're gone.

1044
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,886
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1045
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,610
All right, let's do it.

1046
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,206
Mom?

1047
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,287
Dad?

1048
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,724
- James?
- Mom?

1049
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,563
- Adena?
- Are you, like, stalking me or something?

1050
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,802
No. What? No.

1051
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,689
I'm kidding.

1052
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,921
- Relax, heh.
- Oh!

1053
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,402
Hey, what happened with that perv
who was hitting on you in Arkansas?

1054
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,369
That was actually my dad.

1055
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,402
He was trying to be my wingman.

1056
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,801
Oh, my God.

1057
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,961
He's a really shitty wingman.

1058
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,441
So no guitar tonight?

1059
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,810
It got stolen.

1060
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,930
That sucks.

1061
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,689
I really liked hearing you play.

1062
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,167
You did?

1063
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,971
Yeah, I've always had a
thing for musicians.

1064
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,768
Well, good...

1065
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,890
...because I've always had a thing for...

1066
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,005
...pretty girls.

1067
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,205
Well played.

1068
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,727
See? You don't need a wingman.

1069
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,685
Here it is.

1070
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,804
Oh, my God. This is so illegal.

1071
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,770
- I know, it's so hot, right?
- Yeah.

1072
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,365
I am hard as a faucet right now.

1073
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,930
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh. No. I like it.

1074
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,127
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1075
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,327
- Yeah?
- I do.

1076
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,921
- You like it when I slap that ass?
- I do, I do, heh.

1077
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,368
- Good. I'm gonna beat the shit out of your ass.
- Whoa, Russ.

1078
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,409
Okay, right here?

1079
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,485
- We're about to have sex outside.
- I know. Heh, I know.

1080
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,211
- Do you want me to put a finger in?
- In what?

1081
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,486
- Never mind.
- Okay, okay.

1082
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,371
Y'all wanna keep it down?

1083
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,126
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Hey, watch it, man!

1084
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,760
- Get your leg off me!
- You're so slippery and sweaty!

1085
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,003
If you're here to have sex on the Corners,
we're next. Get in line.

1086
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,685
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, God.

1087
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,690
Oh, God!

1088
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,209
Oh, God! They're in every state!

1089
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,771
So many boobies out here!

1090
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,410
You two! Freeze!

1091
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,766
Go, go, go!

1092
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,967
Hands up!

1093
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,963
- Run! Honey, run!
- Get your shoe!

1094
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,441
Drop the flashlight!

1095
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,525
You do know public indecency
is a crime in the state of Utah?

1096
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,727
Yes. Sorry, officer.

1097
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,009
- See, we're married, and we wanted to just...
- Save it for the judge.

1098
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:04,404
It makes me sick how you deviants show up
and desecrate this holy place every night.

1099
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,006
- Turn around. Hands behind your back.
- What?

1100
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,810
Not so fast, Tommy.

1101
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,440
Shoot for sherbet.
What are you doing here, Kyle?

1102
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:15,207
These people are clearly in the state
of Colorado. That's my jurisdiction.

1103
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,169
Juris-dick in my ass, Kyle.

1104
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,045
Look at her left foot.
Smack-dab in Arizona.

1105
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,090
You weed-legalizing,
Mile-High piece of shit.

1106
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,289
- Hey, there's no reason for that language.
- Sorry, Officer Mormon.

1107
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,925
You don't like that? I have an idea.

1108
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,487
Why don't you plug up your ears
with Mitt Romney's dick?

1109
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:31,886
- Ha, ha.
- Hey.

1110
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,368
Oh, looks like New Mexico decided
to wake up from his siesta.

1111
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,524
- What's the trouble?
- Tell you what the trouble is, dreamcatcher.

1112
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,081
You are wearing entirely too much
goddamn turquoise.

1113
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,605
Hey, we can do this without...

1114
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:46,287
- ...disrespecting each other's traditions.
- Oh, go fuck your wives, Tommy.

1115
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,886
This is what I'm telling you.
Every night we do this.

1116
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,931
You know what this border represents?
It's just an idea. That's all I'm saying.

1117
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,846
- If it's just an idea, then I'll just get the perp...
- Ah! My house!

1118
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,286
- Hey!
- Stay out of my state.

1119
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,171
- What are you gonna do now?
- Get your feet off of my state!

1120
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,651
You wanna stomp on my foot?!

1121
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,370
- You back...
- Is that what you want?

1122
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,005
Hey, I wasn't even in it!

1123
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,686
Don't you kick in here! Don't start...

1124
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,046
How about this, then, huh?

1125
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,328
- We got a live weapon!
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1126
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,926
- Think I'm afraid of that?
- I'm not afraid of you.

1127
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,560
- How about that, huh?
- Oh, yeah, like I'm afraid?

1128
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,205
- Are we...? I don't want it in my mouth.
- Let's not do that.

1129
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,409
- I'll take that all in, dude.
- That's enough! Everyone get down!

1130
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,962
- Get down on the ground! Get down!
- Get down! Get down on the ground!

1131
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,566
I'm cooperating!
I'm the one who's cooperating!

1132
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,570
- You get down too. You get down too.
- Get down on the ground!

1133
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,125
- Hands where?
- Your right side.

1134
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,691
- Sides or front?
- Side to side.

1135
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,285
- Let's do this.
- Everyone down?

1136
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,681
- Okay.
- I think I'm done.

1137
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,091
You can really see all the stars out here.

1138
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,121
Yeah.

1139
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,484
So, what do you feel like doing?

1140
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,206
Heh. I don't know.

1141
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,682
Can I give you a rim job?

1142
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,969
- Whoa.
- No.

1143
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,280
- What?
- I don't know.

1144
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,920
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

1145
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,770
What did you wanna do?

1146
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,288
I don't know. I thought maybe we could...

1147
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,601
...kiss or something?

1148
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,808
Well, yeah, that's what I thought I...

1149
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,803
Yeah. Okay.

1150
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,126
Ow.

1151
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,089
Where's Mom and Dad, dork?

1152
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,282
I don't know.
Just go back inside the thing.

1153
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,442
You were about to let that dingus kiss you?

1154
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,250
Shut up, Kevin.

1155
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,051
- Who is that?
- My stupid little brother.

1156
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,567
I thought you said he was your big brother.

1157
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,882
- I... Damn it!
- Dingus.

1158
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,089
- Why do you take that from him?
- Am I supposed to hit him back?

1159
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,083
- He's a little kid.
- He's a little shit.

1160
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:02,087
- You don't have to let him push you around.
- I kind of thought I was taking the high road.

1161
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,608
Yeah, that seems to be working out for you.

1162
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:07,960
You know what?

1163
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,570
Fuck it.

1164
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,487
Okay, so you wanna do this now?

1165
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,563
Bring it, bitch.

1166
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,447
Wait, what?

1167
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,806
No, no, no.

1168
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,161
Wow, this is so easy.
You are such a little boy.

1169
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,524
Unh! There's gonna be a few changes,
all right? No more bullying.

1170
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,047
- Stop it. I'm telling Mom.
- Shut your mouth.

1171
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,361
You gonna stop bullying?

1172
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,090
You're hurting my tummy.

1173
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,527
Say you're gonna stop,
you little piece of...

1174
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,728
- ...ass.
- Wait, what?

1175
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,769
- "Piece of ass"?
- You know what I mean.

1176
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,488
What are you doing to my face?

1177
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,045
- This hurts, doesn't it?
- Dude.

1178
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,647
- How do you like your ears getting messed up?
- It's really not that bad.

1179
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,883
- I'll tap you on the forehead.
- That's not how you beat someone up.

1180
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,565
Very dehumanizing.

1181
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,563
Your forehead's gonna be so sore.

1182
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,609
Stop it! What are you doing?!

1183
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:04,207
- How do you like your lips getting tickled?
- This is really weird.

1184
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,089
Just smush your cheeks.

1185
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:10,131
- You gonna stop bullying?
- Fine, I'll stop bullying. Just stop doing this.

1186
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,646
Thank you, Adena.

1187
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,086
This has been...

1188
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,124
...the best night of my life.

1189
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,809
Weird fucking family.

1190
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,564
Well, that was awful.

1191
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,808
At least the kids never woke up.

1192
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,930
Passengers on the left side
of the Prancer will notice...

1193
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,327
...the Grand Canyon out the window.

1194
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,609
That's right.
Last stop before Walley World.

1195
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,767
So, guys...

1196
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,083
...when we visited the Grand Canyon
when I was a kid...

1197
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,322
...we barely had a chance to look at it.

1198
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,244
This time...

1199
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,801
...we're gonna do a whole lot more
than look.

1200
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,881
- Oh, cool.
- Sweet.

1201
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,089
Hi, folks! Hi!

1202
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,203
All right, let's see, who do we got here?

1203
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,771
You must be...

1204
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,570
...the Fung family.

1205
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,921
Huh?

1206
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,122
I'm just messing!
You're the Griswolds, right?

1207
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,566
Yes, that's right.

1208
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,611
Heh, right. The little guy's face
was like, "Fungs?"

1209
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,881
Anyway, I'm Chad. I'm gonna be your guide.

1210
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,771
- Okay. Hi, Chad.
- You couldn't have come on a better day.

1211
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,160
I'll get you all geared up.

1212
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,482
And, guess what, the river's
running way high...

1213
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,206
...so I think we're in for
a pretty sweet ride, guys.

1214
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,885
- Let's roll.
- All right.

1215
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,610
Let's do this.

1216
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,770
Okay, gang, joke time is over.
Let's get serious for a second.

1217
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,651
Go over a couple safety procedures
before we hit the water.

1218
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,930
First off, do any of you know this river?
Because this is actually my first time.

1219
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,568
I'm kidding, ha, ha.

1220
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,242
Been doing this about three and a half years.
Know the river inside and out.

1221
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,767
Got my guide certificate from
a Cracker Jack box.

1222
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,760
Guys, it's a joke.
See the little kid's face? He's all:

1223
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,962
"A Cracker Jack box? A what?!"

1224
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,322
All you gotta do is
follow my instructions...

1225
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,086
...and we got a 50-50 chance
of coming back alive.

1226
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,526
I'm kidding, guys.
See the little kid's face, he's all:

1227
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:38,570
"I'm coming back alive! I don't wanna die!"

1228
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,480
Sorry, hang on a second.
I'm getting a call from my fiancée here.

1229
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:45,524
Just got engaged two weeks ago,
so I think I'm gonna take this...

1230
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,729
...or the river's not gonna be the only
hot water I'm in today.

1231
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,845
River's actually very cold.

1232
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,047
Hey, boo.

1233
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,770
- Wow, this is awesome.
- Ah.

1234
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,891
We're about to set sail through one of
America's greatest aquatic treasures.

1235
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,367
- Kevin, don't hit your brother.
- I didn't.

1236
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,691
You heard what he said
about the "aquatic treasures," right?

1237
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,087
- Yeah.
- And you didn't wanna hit him?

1238
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,044
- Well, that's progress.
- Wow.

1239
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,124
I don't understand, though.
Like, what are you even saying?

1240
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,249
But just like that?

1241
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,767
I love you. You love me.

1242
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,208
Tanya, please. Please, just let's
think about this for a second, honey.

1243
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,609
You're all that I have in this world.
Tanya, no, babe.

1244
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:30,401
No, Tanya, no. Please, don't hang up.
No, no! Goddamn it!

1245
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,722
Who's ready to go on the river?

1246
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,651
Um, are you okay, Chad?

1247
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,165
Oh, yeah.

1248
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,607
Turns out I'm not engaged anymore.

1249
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,841
So...

1250
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,166
All aboard.

1251
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,330
I don't know about this, Russ.

1252
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,410
Oh, come on.

1253
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,920
He's kidding.

1254
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,162
<i>Get it together!</i>

1255
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,920
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1256
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,609
<i>Everybody out of the boat.</i>

1257
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,690
Can we go home now?

1258
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:52,927
What?

1259
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,929
We're a day away from Walley World.

1260
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,004
Dad, I don't think any of us
really care about Walley World.

1261
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,084
The boys are right, Russ. I mean,
we almost died back there.

1262
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,641
I mean, isn't it time that we just
cut our losses?

1263
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,726
I cannot believe what I'm hearing.

1264
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,411
Oh, my God.

1265
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:14,090
Huh! All right, that has to be a sign, right?
We were meant to finish this trip.

1266
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,442
Come on, guys, everybody sing it with me.

1267
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:22,642
<i>There used to be a graying tower
Alone on the sea</i>

1268
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,361
We're losing the station.

1269
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,090
- We're not losing anything.
- Yes...

1270
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,083
We just have to listen a little harder!

1271
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:32,962
<i>Love remained A drug...</i>

1272
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,929
Okay, no, no, no. It's gone. It's gone.

1273
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,366
- Just let it go.
- Fine.

1274
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,922
Just thought we could all sing Seal
together like normal families do.

1275
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,124
- Oh, crap.
- Now what?

1276
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,329
- We're almost out of gas.
- Oh, my God.

1277
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,567
It's all right.

1278
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:51,520
I'm sure we will find a place to fill up
around here before we run out.

1279
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,561
Man.

1280
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,730
No signal at all.

1281
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,241
Wonder if the Prancer has
roadside assistance.

1282
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,206
- How would we even call them?
- Maybe it's one of the buttons on the fob.

1283
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,567
Seriously? You're gonna keep
pressing buttons?

1284
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,690
- Well, we never tried the top hat.
- Oh, jeez.

1285
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:12,881
Oh, my God!

1286
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,647
Well, now we know what the top hat does.

1287
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:21,121
I'm not gonna do the swastika.
All that's left is the muffin.

1288
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,971
Come on, muffin.

1289
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,880
- What?
- It started.

1290
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,445
- Yes.
- All right.

1291
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,887
Oh, must be the extra gas tank.

1292
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,087
- Right?
- The muffin.

1293
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,844
Dad to the rescue.

1294
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,650
Thank God. Wait, where's it going?

1295
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,961
Wait! Wait a minute!

1296
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,880
- Make it stop!
- I don't know how!

1297
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,371
I'll hit the muffin again!

1298
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:07,283
- All right, we can handle this.
- Oh, no, no, no. Please, don't say that.

1299
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,762
Do not say that we
can handle this, Russ. Okay?

1300
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,445
- We can.
- No, we can't!

1301
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,886
We can't!

1302
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,123
From the moment we left for this trip,
nothing has gone right.

1303
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,891
Can you please just admit that
this was a mistake?

1304
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,000
But it wasn't. Right? We all wanted to go.

1305
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,361
- I didn't.
- Me neither.

1306
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,567
Me neither.

1307
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,801
You wanted to go.

1308
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:32,010
All right, I think tempers are getting
a little hot right now. We just have to, uh...

1309
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,165
We just all have to...

1310
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,045
Fuck me!

1311
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,646
I give up!

1312
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,002
All I wanted to do was take
my fucking family...

1313
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,004
...on a fucking trip to Walley World,
and ride the fucking Velociraptor!

1314
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,965
Ow. There's a rock in that.

1315
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,329
I guess I'm the asshole for trying to
bring my family closer together.

1316
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:58,047
What do I get? Kids who don't wanna be
with me, and a wife who's miserable.

1317
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,804
- Russ...
- Oh, come on, Debbie.

1318
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:04,409
You know it's true. You think you settled
for me. You think I'm a loser regional pilot.

1319
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,846
Well, guess what.

1320
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,651
I get offers from international
carriers all the time...

1321
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,882
...and I turn them down. Why?

1322
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,765
I don't wanna be away from you
and the kids that long.

1323
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,291
I'm an idiot.

1324
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,729
I should take one of those jobs
and fly off to the Pyramids of Zambezi...

1325
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,321
...and the Lost Gardens of...

1326
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,766
...wherever the fuck!

1327
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,686
Just forget it.

1328
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,127
Forget this whole stupid trip.

1329
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,644
You people are on your own.

1330
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,041
I'm sure you'll find a better
husband and father.

1331
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,965
A cowboy with a huge six-pack...

1332
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,122
...who will take you to Paris...

1333
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,770
...and wrestling...

1334
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,085
...and books.

1335
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,361
What...?

1336
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,211
Wait, where are you going?

1337
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,050
Fuck if I know!

1338
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,921
Ow. God!

1339
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:53,409
These tumbleweeds are all filled
with things that are hard!

1340
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:02,687
What the...?

1341
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,730
Oh, no.

1342
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,761
Help.

1343
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,360
Help.

1344
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,320
Help!

1345
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,090
Help!

1346
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,567
Stop!

1347
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,210
Come on. Go, go, go.

1348
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,245
Help!

1349
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,527
No!

1350
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,771
Help!

1351
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:44,651
- Don't you kill him!
- Dad!

1352
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,251
I'm so sorry.

1353
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,846
When I called you a pedophile, I was...

1354
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,047
No! No, no, no!

1355
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,010
No! Not in front of my family!

1356
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,720
Your wife left this in a
truck stop in Missouri.

1357
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,724
Thought you might want it back.

1358
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,045
Oh, my God.

1359
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,765
Wait, wait.

1360
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,490
Is that my ring?

1361
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,691
This man's been trying to return it
to us the whole time.

1362
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,208
I don't know how I could ever thank you.

1363
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,850
No thanks necessary.

1364
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,929
It was on my way.

1365
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,246
So you're not a rapist?

1366
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,488
Looks like your car's pretty messed up.

1367
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:26,801
Where you headed?

1368
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,040
Um...

1369
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,364
Home, I guess.

1370
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:35,888
Well, I can take you as far as
San Francisco. Will that help?

1371
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,764
Yeah. Yeah, that'll work.

1372
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,247
Thank you.

1373
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,646
All right, come on, guys.

1374
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:44,881
Thank you.

1375
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,487
- He still didn't answer me.
- Oh, Kevin.

1376
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,285
Well, thanks for the ride.
Really appreciate it.

1377
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,887
You never told us why you keep
that teddy bear on the front of your truck.

1378
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,725
- Oh, yeah.
- It makes the kids feel more comfortable.

1379
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,405
Oh, yeah? You have kids?

1380
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,806
Nope.

1381
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,090
Right. Take care.

1382
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,004
Well, I guess that's that.

1383
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,925
Yeah. We'll get a flight home tomorrow.

1384
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,686
Do not stay here.
Worst bed and breakfast we've been to.

1385
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:38,606
They ought to shut this place down.
The owner is a lunatic.

1386
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,929
You all come back now, you hear?

1387
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,165
Hey, look who made it.

1388
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,721
Ellen! Oh, there you are. They're here.

1389
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,001
Hi, Dad.

1390
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,128
- We were so happy to get that call.
- Hi.

1391
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,725
How was your trip?

1392
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,564
- It's a long story.
- Give me a hug.

1393
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,842
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Oh. Come here, you two.

1394
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,765
Oh, my gosh. You're getting so big.

1395
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,400
- Come on, let's go inside.
- Grandpa, you don't have to.

1396
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,045
- No, I can do it. Really.
- Russ.

1397
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,521
- Clark.
- Oh, no. I got this.

1398
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:07,920
I'm fine.

1399
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,049
This really hurts.

1400
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:13,124
Then the muffin made the car explode,
but it didn't matter.

1401
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,846
Our luggage and all of our stuff
was already stolen...

1402
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,083
- ...by the guy with the rat on his shoulder.
- Even took my guitar.

1403
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,049
Oh, James, that's terrible.

1404
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,806
A musician without his instrument is
as bad as...

1405
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,843
...a shoemaker without a toilet seat.

1406
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,883
Ah, I may have something for you.

1407
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,325
It's very fragile. Look.

1408
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,761
- You take care of that.
- Wow, Grandpa.

1409
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:46,524
Thank you so much.

1410
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,170
- Cool.
- Yeah.

1411
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,364
Doesn't look like much,
but that's a very special guitar.

1412
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,410
- It was given to me by Bob Dillon.
- The Bob Dylan?

1413
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,891
No, a Bob Dillon.

1414
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,088
D-I-L-L-O-N.

1415
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,884
- An accountant friend of mine.
- Oh.

1416
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,447
But it was given to him by Jimmy Hendricks.

1417
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,807
- The Jimi Hendrix?
- No.

1418
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,203
So how's the B-and-B business going?

1419
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,648
Oh, we love it, are you kidding?
It's a great fit for us. We love visitors.

1420
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,810
We love having people around
to care for. We're people people.

1421
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,328
- Hey, guys. You mind if we join you?
- We're occupied right now. Beat it.

1422
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,931
Ah, it's getting late. Go to bed, okay?

1423
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,730
- Okay.
- Yeah. I'll run you upstairs.

1424
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:29,601
- Good night, Grandma and Grandpa. Thank you.
- Nighty-night. Sleep tight.

1425
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,485
Ah, well,
you've certainly had an adventure.

1426
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,007
Well, yes.
"Adventure" is one way to put it.

1427
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,443
- How's Audrey?
- Oh, she's great.

1428
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,491
Yeah, she and Stone, they seem
to be very happy.

1429
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,051
Key word there is "seem."

1430
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,204
- What do you mean?
- Their marriage is a sham.

1431
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,647
- What?
- Well, they sleep around on each other.

1432
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,167
- Been doing it for years.
- Oh, my gosh.

1433
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:57,611
I just wish Audrey had found a more
solid marriage like you and Rusty.

1434
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,202
Hey, Russ, can we talk?

1435
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:19,203
I knew we had some problems.
Is it this bad?

1436
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,767
Is our marriage dying?

1437
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,206
No.

1438
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,331
No, a marriage only dies
when you stop trying.

1439
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,801
And you have never stopped trying.

1440
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,210
I just think...

1441
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,850
...maybe I did.

1442
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,407
What do you mean?

1443
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,402
I've only been thinking about
myself, you know?

1444
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,609
I wanted to change the routine,
and go on exotic trips and...

1445
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,167
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.

1446
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:50,049
I was crazy to think I could make us
closer by locking us in a car for a week.

1447
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,168
No, but you were doing that for us.

1448
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:57,770
You have been trying so hard to make
this trip memorable for me and the kids...

1449
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,491
- ...and I didn't appreciate that.
- But why would you?

1450
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:03,803
I mean, I've put you through
some serious shit.

1451
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,611
Literally, a pool of shit in Arkansas.

1452
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,523
You deserve better.

1453
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,562
What, better than you?

1454
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:19,323
How many men would sacrifice their
careers for their family like you have?

1455
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,927
Oh, I didn't sacrifice anything.

1456
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,567
I have everything I've ever wanted.

1457
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,128
- Debbie.
- Yeah?

1458
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:42,210
Will you continue to be my wife?

1459
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,328
I wondered when you'd
give that back to me.

1460
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,642
I was wondering if you still wanted it.

1461
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,961
I do.

1462
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,007
Wait a minute.

1463
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,286
Are we gonna do this?

1464
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,807
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna
pound the shit out of you.

1465
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,121
- Russ.
- What?

1466
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,725
Lock the door.

1467
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:06,724
I'm gonna lock the shit out of that door.

1468
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,480
- Hey, Dad.
- Morning, Rusty.

1469
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:16,850
Could you drive us to the airport this afternoon?
There's a flight back to Chicago at 4.

1470
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,411
Chicago?

1471
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,289
What about Walley World?

1472
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,808
Oh, no. We've, uh, had enough.

1473
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:27,760
- This trip's been a nightmare.
- Well, that's what family vacations are.

1474
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,321
- But you can't give up, Russ.
- Well, why not?

1475
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:35,520
I mean, they always say "it's not
the destination, it's the journey," right?

1476
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:36,920
The journey sucks.

1477
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,651
That's what makes you appreciate
the destination.

1478
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,207
You had a dream to take your family
to Walley World.

1479
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,488
Never let that go.

1480
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,165
I know I didn't.

1481
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:53,250
How would we even get to
Walley World? We don't have a car.

1482
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:54,845
Hey, come on.

1483
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,045
You leave that to me.

1484
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,804
Oops, wrong door.

1485
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,882
Could I, uh, take the Nissan?

1486
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,611
Ha, ha. No, no.

1487
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,481
Wait, Dad, I thought we were going
to the airport.

1488
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,371
Boys, when your father makes you
a promise, he keeps it.

1489
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,568
- That's not right.
- This sucks.

1490
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:13,002
- Wow, this place is huge.
- Ha, ha.

1491
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:14,844
This is dope as fuck.

1492
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,161
Kevin.

1493
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,922
Told you you guys would love it, right?

1494
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,646
Hey, Dad.

1495
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,651
- It really is dope as fuck.
- I know, right?

1496
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,961
- Guys!
- Oh, wait!

1497
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,571
There she is.

1498
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,370
The Velociraptor.

1499
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,810
- I can't believe we actually made it.
- Heh, I know.

1500
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,761
- You guys ready for the ride of your life?
- Oh, yeah.

1501
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,247
- If I'm being honest, it looks a little daunting.
- Ah!

1502
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,926
- Come on. Race you to the ride.
- Yeah, go, go! Faster!

1503
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,320
Come on!

1504
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,922
Two more hours, guys.

1505
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,608
Oh, my gosh.

1506
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,240
- All right, guys. Get psyched.
- Yes.

1507
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,846
This is it.
This is why we came all this way.

1508
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,890
Excuse us.

1509
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,971
- What was that?
- Last ride tonight. Park's closing.

1510
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:27,531
- No, we were next.
- What?

1511
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,721
- That's not okay.
- Should be a misunderstanding.

1512
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,525
Hey, excuse me.

1513
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,404
You just cut in front of us.

1514
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:39,129
No, see, we bought the Platinum Pass
so we get to skip the lines.

1515
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,691
Fifth time today on this one.

1516
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:45,721
Right, well, we just drove 2500 miles
to ride this ride...

1517
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:47,969
...so you can't just take our spot.

1518
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,045
Wait a minute, you...

1519
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,526
Econo Air.

1520
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:52,841
Yeah?

1521
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,886
Good to see you.
All right, I'll tell you what.

1522
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:59,567
Why don't you and your family
go fuck yourselves?

1523
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,001
I'm sorry, guys.

1524
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,681
Oh, my God!

1525
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,366
Okay.

1526
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,125
You're a dead man.

1527
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,042
- Get off!
- Oh, it's on.

1528
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:27,247
Kevin, no!

1529
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,291
No, you're not gonna fight.

1530
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:35,205
- I'm not gonna stand here like a little bitch.
- What?

1531
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:36,801
Oh, shit.

1532
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,964
No, Kevin. Kevin, no. Kevin, come on.

1533
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,642
You people are fucking crazy.

1534
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,690
- What kind of a family are you?
- We're the Griswolds.

1535
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,365
See you around...

1536
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,363
...you piece of ass.

1537
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,211
- Let's do this.
- All right.

1538
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:32,046
- I haven't been in a fight like that for years.
- First car, all right.

1539
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,207
Man, our family fucked that family up.

1540
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,125
- We did.
- Did you see how I scratched that girl's arm?

1541
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,806
Oh, I saw it, honey.
You gave her a good scratch.

1542
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,247
My fingers still hurt a little,
but I'll be okay.

1543
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,447
Oh, boy. Here we go.

1544
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,642
- Hold on.
- Oh, gosh!

1545
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:18,321
<i>There used to be a graying tower
Alone on the sea.</i>

1546
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:26,284
<i>You became
The light on the dark side of me</i>

1547
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:32,846
<i>Love remained
A drug that's the high and not the pill</i>

1548
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,651
<i>But did you know
That when it snows</i>

1549
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:41,648
<i>My eyes become large
And the light that you shine can be seen?</i>

1550
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,482
- Russ?
- Yeah?

1551
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,530
Is it supposed to stay upside-down
like this?

1552
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,409
Yeah, I don't think so.

1553
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,681
Oh.

1554
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,769
Dad, are we stuck?

1555
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,690
Looks that way, pal.

1556
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,882
My eyes, they're starting to bulge.

1557
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,963
I'm sure they'll have us down any minute.

1558
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,361
Well, guys, what'd you think
of Walley World?

1559
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,166
Yeah.

1560
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,890
Listen, boys, I can't tell you how much it's
meant to me to spend all this time with you.

1561
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,488
I love you more than anything in the world.

1562
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:49,843
And if I could, I'd spend
every single day with you.

1563
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,484
So we'll see you in a week.

1564
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,410
- Wait, what's going on?
- Petersons will pick you up at O'Hare...

1565
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,450
- ...and you'll stay with them.
- Where are we going?

1566
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:02,610
Someplace I should've taken you
a long time ago.

1567
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,047
How did you get free tickets to Paris?

1568
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,049
I used my connections as a pilot.

1569
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,527
Oh, you're amazing, heh.

1570
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:14,171
Well, you are my queen, and you
deserve to be treated like one.

1571
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,809
I know it's not exactly first-class...

1572
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,487
- ...or coach...
- Honey...

1573
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:28,326
- ...it's perfect.
- Yeah?

1574
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,721
So...

1575
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,360
...how long is the flight?

1576
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:42,851
Twelve hours.

1577
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:45,651
Perfect.
