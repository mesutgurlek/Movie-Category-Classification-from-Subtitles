Hello, sir.

48
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,667
Um, I have an idea.

49
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,709
Do you have next week's crossword?

50
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,176
Indeed I do, but better yet...

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,942
I have many and a brilliant plan.

52
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,609
Instead of doing just one crossword per week,
I could go daily.

53
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,652
- I could do five per week-
- I'm sorry...

54
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,188
but we just don't
have space for that kind of content.

55
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,588
I know, but, sir, the crossword...

56
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,661
is everyone's favorite part of the newspaper.

57
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,730
<i>And we could be just like the New York Times...</i>

58
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,957
where the puzzle gets harder as the week goes.

59
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,364
So on Monday,
a day that traditionally bites the big one-

60
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,698
<i>This isn't the New York Times.
We're a local paper.</i>

61
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,295
- Our readers just wanna have fun.
- Oh.

62
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,934
Oh! Well, sir, if fun is what they want...

63
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,205
then Mary Horowitz has their fun.

64
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,247
Ta-da! For Saint Patty's Day.

65
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,213
Top o' the morning to ya.

66
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,877
<i>Leprechaun. - Wonderful.
You guys are such a beautiful couple.</i>

67
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,422
Congratulations, man.

68
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,424
<i>I know. Who would have ever thought?</i>

69
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,255
- Mary.
- Yes?

70
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,262
Do you ever stop working
long enough to, you know, like, go out?

71
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,264
- Mm-mmm.
- Uh, spend time with friends?

72
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,664
- Nope.
- Go on a date?

73
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,295
Mm-mmm. Oh. Uh, well,
I have a- a date this evening, sir.

74
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,737
- Oh?
- Yes. A-A blind one.

75
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,470
My parents set it up.
So I was obviously going to cancel.

76
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,102
Go on out on your date.

77
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,579
You know, have some fun with him, and-

78
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,650
Have you moved back into your apartment?

79
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,652
Uh, no. Still fumigating.

80
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,722
But I'm just waiting for
the chemicals to settle...

81
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,291
so I don't get the- the old brain cancer.

82
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,691
Though if I don't move out of my parents' home
soon, I'll be forced to get a lobotomy.

83
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,786
- So it's brain cancer, lobotomy, brain cancer-
- Mary.

84
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:28,924
Mary, less work, more of everything else.

85
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,935
Just enjoy being normal.

86
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,398
Martin, I need that feature
on the pumpkin shortage.

87
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,476
Is it ready?

88
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,212
Be normal.

89
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,046
Normal.

90
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,747

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,153

94
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,730
<i>The key to surviving those tough days
is to pick yourself up...</i>

95
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,493

96
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:06,368
<i>For me, that's imparting thejoy
of crosswording to all mankind.</i>

97
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,531
<i>Ah, crosswording...</i>

98
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,168

00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,405
I like your protective ensemble.

100
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,641
Bunker gear, if you will.

101
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:20,241
So, if these kids set you on fire,
you're good to what- 300 degrees?

102
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,253
If I survive this- Phew!

103
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,823
I'm supposed to go on a blind date tonight.

104
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,824
Yeah. Steve.

105
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,726
Steve. Yeah.
His mother probably thinks he's gay.

106
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,823
So, my parents are no doubt pimping me out
to test his sexuality. Thanks.

107

Yeah. I mean, wouldn't you?

109
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,373
Yeah? Though I-I could use a little-

110
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,376
if you know what I'm saying.

111
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,345
Yeah. Been a long time.

112
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,279
Mary Horowitz.

113
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,116
Yes. Yes. That is-That's me.

114
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,782
Here's a treat, students.

115
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:03,624
<i>Miss Mary Horowitz is the crossword

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,790
You know the crossword puzzles that you see
each week in the newspaper?

117
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,595
Well, it's her job to create them.

118
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,761
Isn't that fun?

119
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,705
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

120
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:19,801
people do crossword puzzles all the time...

121
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:25,043
but they don't often think of the person
who made all the words fit together.

122
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:30,214
<i>Crossword constructors have
above-average intelligence...</i>

123
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,382
and it helps if they can spell.

124
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,255
Okay. Um-

125
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,993
Okay. That's good.

126
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,396
Imagine, if you will, a world.

127
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,237
- A world-
- Daniel. You have a question.

128
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,504
You make a living doing that?

129
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,512
Well-

130
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,775
One puzzle a week
can't make you enough to live on.

<i>How do you pay your rent?</i>

Oh, uh-

00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:06,424
Well, my parents have graciously permitted me
to bunk at their abode...

<i>Temporarily, yes, I live at home.</i>

136
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,328
But, then again, so do all of you.
So there. Now-

137
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,997
- You don't have a husband, do you?
- Or a boyfriend.

138
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,370
Kids, come on.

139
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,311
No. Not-Not at- Not at this time.

140
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,150

Mary? How'd it go?

157
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,901
Smashing success.

158
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,769
<i>Or as they say in old Paris,
coup de maître, meaning "masterstroke. "</i>

159
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,433
<i>- Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs and, uh,
get ready. - Good.</i>

160
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,704
Oh. So you're going ahead with the date?

161
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,915
Yes. Of course.

162
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,784
Look how excited I am. Better get going...

163
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,052
if I'm gonna fall in love and get proposed to...

164
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,060
register at Barnes and "Normal"...

165
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,653
<i>have a beautiful wedding
with an accordion band and little, tiny...</i>

166
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,030
plastic bride and groom on top of a cake,
posing like this.

167
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,770
I'm gonna go.

168
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,205
<i>I just want her to be happy.</i>

169
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,606
Yeah.

170
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,871
Go out and have some fun.

171
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,140
Mm-hmm.
You ever wanna see any grandchildren...

172
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,443
you're gonna have to burn those damn boots.

173
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,146
Carol, I have a date.

174
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,452
A blind one.

175
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,458
But...

176
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,361
if this Steven is anything better than
excessively hideous...

177
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,990
I think we really should try and make it work.

178
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,127
Because, if society wants me to be normal...

179
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,104
then normal we shall be, right?

180
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,175
Yes.

181
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,734
Oh, and, Carol, I really would appreciate
your support on this too.

182
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,440
And by "support," I don't mean that.

183
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,018
<i>Mary?</i>

184
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,087
Knock, knock, knock.

185
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,521
Oh. Look at you.

186
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,526
Already have- repeatedly.

187
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,562
Mar. He's hot.

188
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,894
Please don't mean on the inside.

189
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,261
<i>- I'm a cameraman for CCN-
- Mm-hmm?</i>

190
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,362
<i>- a news program.
- We don't really watch-</i>

191
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,408
<i>- Work with a guy called Hartman Hughes.
Ever seen him? - No. Can't say I have, but-</i>

192
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,490
Hey, Mary. I'm Steve.

193
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,750
Carol. Carol, I bring news.

194
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,388
There's been a-
There's been a most unexpected turn of events.

195
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:44,333
My date is substantially
better looking than one might have predicted.

196
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:48,100
And you know what? Colin Powell once said,
"There's no secret to success. "

197
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,107
Well...

198
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,111
clearly he doesn't understand the power
of spectacular skivvies.

199
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,613
There she is!

200
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,813
Oh, wow.

201
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,755
Nice boots.

202
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,727
Thank you.

203
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,662
You ready?

204
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,757
Mmm.

205
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,768
<i>- So nice to meet you.
- Yeah.</i>

206
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,135
- Oh, yeah. It's raining outside.
- Hold this. The door.

207
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,231
<i>- Let me get that door for you.
- Thanks again.</i>

208
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,072
<i>Good luck. Shalom.</i>

209
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,616
I have to admit, at first I wasn't so sure
about this whole blind date thing...

210
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,380
but now I'm surprised
our parents didn't set it up earlier...

211
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,388
especially knowing my mother.

212
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,583
Must be some kind of conspiracy.

213
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,129
Oop. You good?

214
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,569
Oh, he's so not gay.

215
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,137
Oh, man, it's coming down.

216
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,442
It's really coming down, huh?

217
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,315
I thought maybe we could go to, uh, Ernesto's.

218
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,484
They've got great tamales.

219
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,787
And they have this drink
called, uh, "El Gallo Negro. "

220
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,361
<i>It means "the black rooster. "</i>

221
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,862
You have, like, two of those drinks,
it's like you- -

222
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,262
Oh. You okay? You okay?

223
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,874
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

224
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,910
Wait, wait.
What-What about-What about your parents?

225
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,912
- What about my parents?
- Your mom.

226
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,710
Mmm. She's married,
and you're not her type. Mmm.

227
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,048
No, I just mean-
I just mean we're right in front of home.

228
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,088
Whoa. I just-

229
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,784
I just mean we're right in front of their house.

230
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,192
And I have no problem with that whatsoever.

231
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,824
Oh, Steven. Oh, Steven.

232
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:59,701
- Is that Steven with
a "V" or Stephen with a "P-H"?

233
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,898
- It's with a "V."
- I thought so.

234
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,271
- Yeah.
- Thought so. You know, There's over...

235
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,401
a million Stevens with a- a "V" in the country.

236
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,345
It's much more popular than the "P-H" way.
Twice as popular, in fact.

237
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,382
I think it was the Brits who prefer their P-H's.

238
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,714
Yeah. Not as much
as their fish and chips. -

239
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,850
Steven, we really should
commend our mothers...

240
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,256
- for predicting our all-encompassing
compatibility. - I got it.

241
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,124
I mean, we're-we're both
professionally compatible...

242
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,393
you in TV,
and- and me in, uh-you know, in newspapers.

243
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:31,697
I'll help you. Also noticing we're both
quite sexually compatible.

244
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,103
I don't know if you noticed like I noticed,
but we're both wearing blue...

245
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,107
- and what are the chances of that?
- Ooh.

246
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,676
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

247
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,870
Of course, the chances are
probably pretty good- -

248
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,540
<i>given that blue is one of the most popular
of the three colors.</i>

249
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,243
Do you, uh- Do you like crosswords?

250
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,910
Sure I do.

251
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,544
- Really?
- Yeah.

252
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,919
You know how when the perfect clue
gets stuck in your brain...

253
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:56,620
and it just explodes
into this bouquet of mixed emotions?

254
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,061
I'm - I'm aroused.
I'm intrigued. I'm a- I'm amused.

255
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,497
- I'm perplexed. I'm
- I'm just like all these things. - Uh-huh.

256
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:07,095
- Yeah? - Yeah. Can- Let's go back to the,
uh- the aroused.

257
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,003
- Okay. Okay. Wow. Steven.
- Whoa.

258
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,906
- Oh.
- It's like we're two rare Earth elements...

259
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,945
just brought together by the Norns.

260
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:18,676
- It's just-That's Scandinavian for the Destinies.
- Oh.

261
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,948
And now I'm going to eat you like a
mountain lion. -

262
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,148
You know what? I'm sorry.

263
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,815
- It's my phone.
- What are you doing?

264
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,894
- I didn't hear it ring. That's odd.
- Vibrate. It vibrated.

265
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,155
- I didn't feel it.
- Oh, probably because of all the grinding.

266
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,254
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

267
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,856
- I'll get over here.
- Yeah?

268
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,163
What? Yeah. What's up?

269
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,795
- All right. I'm coming.
- Oh! Already?

270
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,636
- Okay. Okay. I can hurry. I can hurry.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

271
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,369
I- I gotta go to work.

272
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,605
<i>- There's breaking news.
- Oh. Oh!</i>

273
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,547
<i>- Gosh, I'm so sorry.
- Well, it's-it's okay. It's-</i>

274
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,484
I gotta go to, uh, Boston.

275
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,817
Wow. Boston, huh?

276
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,118
That's a spectacular city.

277
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,352
Known not only for its- its tea...

278
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,225
but, uh, for Sam Morse,
who invented the Morse code.

279
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,299
<i>- Get out of here.
- Yes. Do you want some help?</i>

280
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,698
No. You know, it's so- it'd be so much more
interesting staying here and everything.

281
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,170
Like, I really wish you could be there.

282
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,707
<i>- Life on the road sure is tough.
- Oh. I- I-</i>

283
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,004
But you have a job to do.

284
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,144
Oh. He likes Twinkies.

285
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,679
Okay. It's been fun.

286
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,561
<i>- Okay. That's for you.
- Oh. Gracias.</i>

287
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,188
Yeah.

288
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,671

289
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,175

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,992
<i>Yes. Okay. So, lunch meeting
at thatJapanese restaurant at 1:30, okay?</i>

308
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,766
And I need to- I-This crossword is bullshit.

309
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:58,036
Anyway, he said he was gonna change,
and I, for one, believe him, so-

310
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,077
This doesn't make any sense.

311
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,444
- Well, to me, it does.
- Oh. Yeah. Of course.

312
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,040
- This is lame.
- Have you tried six down?

313
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,814
<i>These clues suck!</i>

314
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,585
I can't get any of these!

315
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,662
Oh, thanks.

316
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,995
Don't even bother. I don't know what the deal is,
but it looks like every single clue is-

317
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,092
"All About Steve"?

318
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:29,272
- Steve's eye color.
- Steve's car odor.

319
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,832
Steve's lips taste like-

320
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,175
Mint explosion.

321
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,006
Mary, who's Steve?

322
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:42,178
- Oh. An extraordinary-
- No, no. That's not what's important.

323
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,688
What's important is what you've done
with this crossword puzzle. I mean, it's - it's -

324
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,658
- It's inspired.
- No.

325
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,489
- Romantic.
- No.

326
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:54,498
Oh, you're a tough one today. Let's see. Um-

327
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,500
It's unprofessional.

328
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,196
Un- No.
That's not the word.

329
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,671
Um, okay. Let me think. You are-

330
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,211
Mmm.

331
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,245
You've tarnished the paper's reputation.

332
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,408
<i>I mean, I really thought that you would've known
better than to pull something like this.</i>

333
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:16,318
Do you have any idea
how many readers you've let down?

334
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:20,084
Uh, 7,402, but-

335
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,217
- Mary.
- Yes?

336
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,066
Mary, we're gonna have to let you go.

337
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:34,100
Oh.

338
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:37,038
<i>I could make it up to you...</i>

339
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,769
by doing a fishing themed crossword.

340
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:42,505
I know how you love the- the piscatology.

341
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:51,017
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:55,558
We can, um-

343
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,560
Yeah, we'll just, uh-We'll-

344
00:19:57,662 --> 00:19:59,562
I'll call you, and we'll just-

345
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:09,101
<i>Police tell us that the chief suspect in the case
is one Mr. Mark McLaglen.</i>

346
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:11,402
Okay, guys. You're set.

347
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:14,603
Tucson's affiliate's on site now.
Remote van's waiting for you at the airport.

348
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:16,771
- Okay.
- But I get an Escalade, right?

349
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:21,550
Dan, we talked about this.
Nick Vasquez gets an Escalade.

350
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:25,452
- Nick Vasquez has six Emmys.
- Stolen from me.

351
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:29,287
<i>- He was robbed, Dan. All six times.
- Thank you, Stevie.</i>

352
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:32,191
I mean, he can't help it
if he's considerably older than Vasquez.

353
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:36,596
By "older" he means
experienced, Marlboro Man handsome.

354
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,760
Um, I'm pretty sure I meant old.

355
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:43,101
<i>Wh-Wh-Wh-Whatever.
Which one of you geniuses can explain this?</i>

356
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:45,573
...little feller just needs to stiffen up.

357
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:48,577
<i>With the two purple flowers-</i>

358
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,671
- I'd, uh, be happy to, Dan.
- Look at how the blue brings out my eyes.

359
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:55,115
Yeah. What I was going for here was-
Oh, look at that smooth push-in.

360
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:57,779
<i>Western motif, sort of the iconic flower.</i>

361
00:20:57,888 --> 00:21:01,187
<i>Then I needed a backdrop, like a
mountainous range. Boom! Two mountains.</i>

362
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:03,419
In Hollywood, they call that a Mae West,
'cause Mae West had-

363
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:07,122
Keep talking, fellas. Keep talking your way
right back to the Weather Channel.

364
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,665
Right back to 10 degrees in Buffalo...

365
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,930
where you'll be spending most of your days
taking close-up shots of kids' snotsicles.

366
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,903
Well, give us something good, Danny.

367
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:20,068
- I mean- we're fighter pilots, man.
- Yeah, we really are.

368
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:23,112
It's like sending an F-16
to kill your neighbor's dog.

369
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:25,114
<i>It's a waste of our energy.</i>

370
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:28,447
And I need one big report, man,
to get that anchor desk.

371
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:30,543
Get out of my office.

372
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:34,648
<i>This is a big report, so don't screw it up with
any more stupid pranks this time, Hartman.</i>

373
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:37,159
And you, Angus,
you're responsible for these guys.

374
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:39,923
Make sure they don't embarrass me in Tucson.
They screw around, you're out.

375
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:43,125
Yes, sir. - Remember the Escalade.

376
00:21:44,468 --> 00:21:46,368
- Starling, how you doing?
- Whatever.

377
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,335
- Jackie, looking sweet. Paula.
- In your dreams.

378
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:52,170
I can feel your love darts coming over this way.

379
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,301
- Mom. I'm working. What's up?
- You're the man, Hartman Hughes.

380
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:56,312
No, I haven't read it. Why?

381
00:21:56,414 --> 00:22:00,350
<i>Uh, okay. Hey.
Does anybody have a Sacramento Herald?</i>

382
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:02,351
<i>- Yeah. Right here.
- Right. Yeah, I got it.</i>

383
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,444
Yes, I ate lunch. What section?

384
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:09,584
Oh, wow. This is all about me.

385
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:15,590
Wait. This is all about me.

386
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:46,195
Yes.

387
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:50,496
Oh. Ow, ow, ow.

388
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:53,764
Doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt.

389
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:56,601
But obviously the gods have seen-

390
00:22:56,707 --> 00:22:59,005
Where are you?

391
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,136
Ooh. Hi. There you are.
Okay. Do you know what's at work here?

392
00:23:02,246 --> 00:23:05,511
<i>Pistas. Indicios. Anhaltspunkte.</i>

393
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:07,709
Clues. They're just-They're-They're everywhere.

394
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:10,651
One, I was thinking of not going on the date,
but then the good children...

395
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:13,918
of, uh, Youngstrum Academy kindly-
You know, they-they persuaded me to go.

396
00:23:14,024 --> 00:23:16,492
Two, my date duly arrives.

397
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:20,291
<i>And lo, not only is he, uh, muy caliente,
but he likes my red boots.</i>

398
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:24,059
<i>Three, Steve says it would be great...</i>

399
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:26,102
if I could be on the road with him.

400
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:29,070
<i>But, of course, I cannot because I have a job.</i>

401
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:32,267
Four, only days later,
I learn I no longer have a job...

402
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:37,336
which is obviously just the final clue
leading to the blindingly simple answer:

403
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:40,178
Onward, Mary Horowitz.
Onward. Go be with Steve.

404
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:42,946
What do you mean you don't have a job?

405
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:46,318
Missing the point, Father. Uh, the clues
have been deciphered. I must journey forth.

406
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,325
Journey forth where?

407
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:52,787
Father, you're making me crazy.

408
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:57,899
Ah. Voilà, Papa.

409
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:01,199
If it is news, Steven is there.
Auf Wiedersehen.

410
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:04,934
This is Hartman Hughes reporting from the edge.

411
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,067
Anybody seen Vasquez? Huh?

412
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:09,078
- Anybody seen Vasquez?
- No.

413
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,671
Too much of a pussy to come
to a dangerous hostage crisis.

414
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:14,182
Thirty seconds. -
Just gonna bring you around on the left.

415
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:17,880
Well, I wanna open up on the dust,
then we're gonna hit a 45 up to your right side.

416
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:21,685
All right. Steve, but I'm gonna indicate
down the street. I'm gonna come around the left.

417
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:23,817
- And right here.
- Ten seconds-you're on with Paula.

418
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:27,056
She still mad at you
for giving thoseJenny Craig gift certificates?

419
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:30,531
- And five, four- - Fact I was looking at
her ass to begin with is a compliment.

420
00:24:33,337 --> 00:24:37,103
Paula, I've just arrived
at Wild Willy's Old Western Town...

421
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,870
beloved tourist attraction in Tucson, Arizona.

422
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:43,913
On a typical day, this street would be busy...

423
00:24:44,014 --> 00:24:48,348
with families eager to enjoy
the Wild West life experience.

424
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:52,081
Tragically, today,
the man who plays Wild Willy the Outlaw...

425
00:24:52,189 --> 00:24:54,714
has taken his role to heart...

426
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:57,225
and captured eight of his coworkers,
taking them hostage...

427
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,558
<i>and holding them in the saloon...</i>

428
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:03,565
a mere 85 yards away from where I stand now.

429
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,658
Shots have been fired, Paula!

430
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:08,761
<i>Let's go handheld, Steve!</i>

431
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:15,608
<i>It's unclear at this moment
who the shot was intended for...</i>

432
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:19,205
or how many lives have perhaps been lost.

433
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:21,807
Okay. Breaking news, Paula.

434
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,683
We have our first confirmed kill:

435
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:26,756
a horse.

436
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:32,193
<i>One of many that live here
at Wild Willy's Old Western Town.</i>

437
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:35,129
First victim of this senseless tragedy.

438
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:42,134
It's at moments like this I'd like to believe
that there's a heaven just for horses-

439
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:45,073
rolling meadows, lush grasses...

440
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:49,612
<i>the spirits of deceased horses
galloping to and fro.</i>

441
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:52,773
Long may you roam...

442
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:57,384
in heaven, O noble horse.

443
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:00,891
<i>Not dead.</i>

444
00:26:05,162 --> 00:26:08,620
And yet, the horse not quite dead, Paula.

445
00:26:08,732 --> 00:26:10,597
<i>Not quite dead at all.</i>

446
00:26:13,137 --> 00:26:16,664
He's apparently a trained horse, Paula.

447
00:26:16,774 --> 00:26:18,935
Trained to drop down-

448
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:23,309
during Wild Willy's
Old West shoot-out routine.

449
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:25,382
<i>This particular horse...</i>

450
00:26:25,482 --> 00:26:29,111
also sensitive to trucks backfiring on Route 20.

451
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:31,244
Well-

452
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:35,291
in the midst of tragedy, a blessed miracle.

453
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,691
<i>Cut. - Damn it, Steve!
Do you think this is funny?</i>

454
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:43,256
You guys could see the horse is alive, and
you're giving me the "bring 'em the tears" signal?

455
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:45,267
No, no. This is the "bring the tears" signal.

456
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:47,360
This is "Hey, the horse is up. It's galloping. "

457
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:50,940
Yeah.

458
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:53,008
<i>You know my favorite answer?</i>

459
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,078
<i>"Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. "</i>

460
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:57,545
<i>It's a lung disease. Ooh! Fontana, California.</i>

461
00:26:57,648 --> 00:27:00,014
Y- You know what they make there? No?

462
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:02,017
No? They make-They make steel.

463
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,952
Yeah. Do you know how they make it? No?

464
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:08,183
I won't bore you with the whole story,
just the-just the best parts...

465
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:12,023
like- like how it's made from, uh,
molten pig iron, which-

466
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:16,361
which does not, as everyone might think,
have anything to do with pigs or swines or hogs.

467
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:20,130
It's -It's a raw iron made from iron and coke.

468
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:23,331
<i>And by coke, I mean the, uh,
carbonaceous residue, not the-not the cola.</i>

469
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,340
Or the booger sugar.

470
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:28,843
<i>It's-It's a method perfected
by Sir Henry Bessemer, a Brit.</i>

471
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:33,178
Oh. And Bessemer is also a town in Alabama.
Yea!

472
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:35,683
<i>Yep. And you know what they have there?
No? No?</i>

473
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:39,813
Hitler's typewriter.
Hitler's typewriter.

474
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:42,221
That guy was such an asshole.

475
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:46,228
<i>Anyone up for a potty break?
It's not good to hold it. -</i>

476
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,161
We're gonna take five minutes here.

477
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:55,728
Establishments in desolate areas like this
are usually run by family members that are, uh-

478
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:01,776
No! No! Stop!

479
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,749
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

480
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,679
Crap. Crap.

481
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:26,025
<i># I want to hit the road #</i>

482
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:29,663
Yes. Hi. Uh, Do you know when
the next bus to Tucson goes through here?

483
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:32,298
'Cause I kind of just-just missed mine.

484
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:39,046
I'm headed that way.

485
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:41,049
Oh. That's nice.

486
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:45,788
<i>So, you ever kill any animals?</i>

487
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:49,586
<i>Set a trash can full ofkittens on fire?
You know, something like that.</i>

488
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,285
No.

489
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:53,863
No? Okay.

490
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:55,898
What about humans? That had to-

491
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,260
Would I tell you if I did?

492
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:04,066
Touché, sir. Touché.

493
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:07,337
<i># Hit the road and drive for miles #</i>

494
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:12,307
<i># I'm gonna hit the road
and I'm not gonna-#</i>

495
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:14,714
<i>You can wait for that next bus if you want.</i>

496
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:28,765
Uh- Uh-

497
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:33,997
Roughly 9.85.
I will give this to you and just-Thank you.

498
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:37,173
Stop! Stop!

499
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:55,084
May I see your license, please?

500
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:04,866
Norman James Durwood?

501
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:07,869
Mary Magdalene Horowitz. Nice to meet you.

502
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:10,496
Good to meet you, I think.

503
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:14,737
<i>Norm, if you are going to rape and murder me...</i>

504
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:17,678
you are going to have to cut my body up
into a million chunks...

505
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:19,681
and scatter me all over four states...

506
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:21,546
because this appendage...

507
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:24,985
will lead homicide detectives right to you.

508
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:27,716
<i>And that would be no bueno. I think we're good.</i>

509
00:30:31,562 --> 00:30:35,191
no pencils.

510
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:38,928
Doing a crossword with a pencil is like
screaming with your lips duct-taped together.

511
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:41,834
<i>It is weak.
If you're going to do a crossword puzzle...</i>

512
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:45,272
you need to do it fearlessly
and with abandon and with a pen.

513
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,536
I prefer medium felt-tip blue.

514
00:30:47,644 --> 00:30:51,102
It's about choosing your path, Norm,
and just committing to it.

515
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:55,043
<i>Well, I figure that when you miss a bus...</i>

516
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:57,177
maybe you weren't meant to take it.

517
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:02,620
Hmm.

518
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:05,593
<i>Are you familiar with, uh-
with, uh, moon blindness, Norm?</i>

519
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:08,062
<i>- It's like this awful eye pus that starts to ooze-
- You know...</i>

520
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:10,895
quiet time might be real good right about now.

521
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:14,597
Oh. Okay.

522
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:18,274
<i>Quiet. Silencio.</i>

523
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,343
<i>Ruhe.</i>

524
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:24,638
Hey, Norm.

525
00:31:24,748 --> 00:31:25,976
Mary?

526
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,745
Thanks for not raping me.

527
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:32,985
My pleasure.

528
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:40,862
<i>Howdy, partners!
Welcome to Wild Willy's Ol' Western Town!</i>

529
00:31:40,964 --> 00:31:44,400
<i>Howdy, partners! Welcome to
Wild Willy's Ol' Western Town!</i>

530
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:50,632
All righty. Give my love to the kids.

531
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:53,801
Good luck. And if that Steve
shows you any disrespect-

532
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,811
Disrespect. Well, if you mean unmannerly...

533
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,972
tactless and vulgar,
he is a straight man, Norman.

534
00:31:58,081 --> 00:32:00,572
Some things can't be helped.
But if you mean that he's someone-

535
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:02,276
See ya, Mary.

536
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:07,255
See ya, Norm.

00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:58,468
<i>They're all safe.
The man surrendered.</i>

548
00:33:01,044 --> 00:33:02,602
<i>Crap.</i>

549
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,345
<i>- Adiós.
- Adiós, señora.</i>

550
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:16,591

551
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:18,024
<i>- Baby Peggy...

552
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:19,254
<i>- in Oklahoma...
- ùS/?</i>

553
00:33:19,696 --> 00:33:20,890
<i>Poor little thing.</i>

554
00:33:20,998 --> 00:33:24,525
<i>Oh. Oh. Gracias. Gracias, señor.</i>

555
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:26,158

00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:27,497
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

557
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:30,367
...Guadalupe Aguero, or to us, Baby Peggy...

558
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:34,706
a third leg.

559
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:37,746
Shortly after the birth,
her poor immigrant parents separated.

560
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:42,046
Now with joint custody, one parent
wants the abnormal baby to keep the third leg.

561
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:44,780
- The other wants it gone.
- After months of legal wrangling...

562
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:46,788
the judge has ordered in favor of the mother.

563
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,858
Amputation surgery is scheduled for tomorrow...

564
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:51,018
but the father, Mr. Aguero,
isn't about to give up.

565
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:55,224
As his lawyers work to secure an injunction...

566
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:59,268
the father continues to rally support
around the rogue leg.

567
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:03,328
I'm quoting. " If God didn't want my daughter
to have a third leg...

568
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,432
he wouldn't have stuck one
between the other two. "

569
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:09,671
So, for now, the fate
of the precious child's third leg...

570
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,806
is in the hands of a judge.

571
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:16,044
Hartman Hughes,
reporting from Oklahoma City...

572
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:20,112
near the leg,
and as always, from the edge.

573
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:23,283
- Cut.
- Okay. What do you think?

574
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:25,793
In the next segment,
I was thinking about saying...

575
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:29,263
"Baby Peggy is in
a three-legged race against time. "

576
00:34:29,366 --> 00:34:32,335
- What do you think?
- Okay.

577
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:34,461
- Wanna do some one-on-ones?
- Do it.

578
00:34:34,571 --> 00:34:38,405
Okay.
Just intelligent arguments from both sides.

579
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:40,408
Intelligent arguments, guys!

580
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:45,072
I was born with a vestigial penis.
That means a penis hanging outside the body.

581
00:34:45,182 --> 00:34:48,549
You know, like yours. I'm talking about
a ding-a-ling. Know what I'm saying?

582
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:52,884
And it was pretty good size. I was kind of
proud of it. I got to be in seventh grade.

583
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:56,686
I used to work it, hang it on the side
in gym class. I got all the attention.

584
00:34:56,793 --> 00:35:01,059
<i>Now there's just a big old scar.
Can you feel it? Can you feel that scar?</i>

585
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:04,395
Right? Okay. So, they cut it off, then-

586
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:06,935
What? What happened? H- I wasn't finished.

587
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:10,700
- That was unbelievable. - Yeah, that
was the, uh, highlight of my morning.

588
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:14,276
- Vasquez.
- Where?

589
00:35:14,377 --> 00:35:17,175
<i>Oh. That's a new Escalade.</i>

590
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,771
<i>He's got three security guards.</i>

591
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:22,351
Look at that. He brought toys.

592
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:28,515
Ooh, that's that guy from the news.
Hey. You with the baby. Hey.

593
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:33,119
Son of a bitch.
He's got a three-legged doll baby. Angus!

594
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:25,842
What?

595
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:29,417
Oh, no.

596
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,511
<i>#Love him, I love him, I love him #</i>

597
00:36:32,622 --> 00:36:36,251

598
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:39,886
<i># I will follow him #</i>

599

<i># Follow him wherever he may go #</i>

600
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,865
- Hi!
- Oh!

601
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:48,096
- Hey.
- Hi. Hi.

602
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:49,638
Hey. Oh.

603
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:52,367
- How are ya? Hey!
- I'm good. Surprise!

604
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:54,602
Yeah, I didn't - I-Yeah.

605
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:57,646
- Look at you, here.
- Sorry it took me so long.

606
00:36:57,747 --> 00:37:00,215
- It did. It did.
- Yeah.

607
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:02,547
- Oh, I brought your-
I brought your umbrella back.

608
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:05,246
- And I got a surprise-
- Oh. I have a lot, but that's fine.

609
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:07,915
that I know you love.

610
00:37:08,024 --> 00:37:11,721
Oh. Wow. That's, uh-

611
00:37:11,828 --> 00:37:14,388
That's -Wow. That's scary thoughtful.

612
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:17,227
- Thanks. Thank you.
- I-I-I know you love them. Twinkies.

613
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:21,168
- So, you-you-you came here all
the way just to see me? - Yes, sir.

614
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:23,637
"Ask and you shall receive. "
You know who said that?

615
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,368
- No.
- Jesus.

616
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:29,809
Did Jesus tell you to come here?

617
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:33,815
Jesus ask me to come here.

618
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,112
- No. You did.
- Oh. No. No.

619
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:37,846
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

620
00:37:37,954 --> 00:37:39,649
- Yes, you did.
- I don't think so.

621
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:41,883
Yes. Right after you fondled my breasts.
Remember?

622
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:44,222
- Who?
- You. Remember?

623
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:46,522
- Oh.
- "Oh, life on the road sure is awful.

624
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,326
Sure would be great if you could
be out there with me. "

625
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:51,332
Oh, yeah.

626
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:53,664
With your big old hands.
Just grabbed my little puppies and-

627
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,295
- Yeah.
- went to town.

628
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:58,670
- It felt good.
- Good.

629
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:00,800
- Yeah.
- Uh, well, that's great.

630
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:04,437
Yeah. It will be great,
because you are making journalistic history-

631
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:07,573
- Oh. That's sweet of you to say.
- and I will be right by your side...

632
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:09,982
for- for support and encouragement...

633
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:11,986
and whatever, like...

634
00:38:12,088 --> 00:38:15,489
- nurturing and-and coddling you
as a man should require. - Okay.

635
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,822
I'm -I'm pretty much a one-man team. It's just-

636
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:20,953
It's - It's just me and, uh, my camera.
God, yeah.

637
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:22,964
- You know what? And yes.
- Can't believe it.

638
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:25,500
You know,
the news- the news needs you. Look.

639
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:27,661
Because I-I bet my left ovary...

640
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:31,332
that that- that's Baby Peggy's daddy
leaving the hospital to avoid the press.

641
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:33,966
- Right there. Look.
- Oh, no, that's a nurse.

642
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:37,012
- No. Right- - No, they're all dressed
like- There's a lot of nurses.

643
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:41,743
- 'Cause we're at a hospital. - But a- But a
nurse not wearing sterilized nonslip footwear?

644
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:45,184
<i>- What?
- Look.</i>

645
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:47,654
Oh! Ho-Holy shit! You're right.

646
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:51,022
- Yeah. I- I should, uh-Thank you.
- Go, Steven with a "V."

647
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:53,823
First priority, your-your occupation.

648
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,830
Second priority, fornication!

649
00:38:57,934 --> 00:38:59,959
Fornication.

650
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,970
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes. Ooh. Sorry?

651
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:04,006
- Only media are allowed up here.
- Oh. Absolutely.

652
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:06,371
My credentials, kind sir.

653
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:09,878
<i>- "Cruciverbalist"?
- S/.</i>

654
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:13,437
You gotta stay down there with your friends.

655
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,882
My friends.

656
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:18,988
<i>Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!</i>

657

<i>Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!</i>

658
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:25,353
<i>Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!</i>

659
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:28,727
Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!

660
00:39:28,832 --> 00:39:32,233
- Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!
- Again!

661
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:34,303
<i>Don't make us beg! Save the third leg!</i>

662
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:39,400
<i>Okay, guys. That's 30. That was fantastic.</i>

663
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,710
<i>Hi there. I like your boots.</i>

664
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:46,373
Oh. Thanks.

665
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:49,543
Are you pro-leg or anti-leg?

666
00:39:49,652 --> 00:39:51,643
Neither really.

667
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:54,656
Well, um, this is the pro-leg group over here.

668
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:59,058
Oh, we are supporting Baby Peggy's dad
in the fight to save the baby's third leg.

669
00:39:59,162 --> 00:40:02,222
- Oh, wow. - Um, over there-Well,
those are the anti-leggers.

670
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:05,995
Well, is the, uh- is the additional leg
functioning or nonfunctioning?

671
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:10,937
Because if it has full mobility, it's both
a physical asset and a medical phenomenon.

672
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,941
Those are a lot of words.

673
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:16,341
- And they're kind of big. I don't understand.
- Sorry.

674
00:40:16,446 --> 00:40:19,938
In addition to promoting a righteous cause...

675
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:22,142
the pro-leggers have better snacks.

676
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,022
Okay. I'm, um...

677
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:29,023
definitely pro-leg then.

678
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:32,094
Yea!

679
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:34,925
Come around.
You can help light the rest of the candles.

680
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:37,397
Okay. Okay.

681
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:41,695
Love those boots.

682
00:40:41,805 --> 00:40:44,535
<i>Angus. Footage of the dad leaving the scene.</i>

683
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:47,337
<i>- Nice work.
- Right?</i>

684
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,674
- How'd you get that?
- Uh-

685
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:55,175
This is Hartman Hughes reporting from the edge.

686
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:01,823
You remember the blind date I went on?

687
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:03,950
- Yeah. The one who did the crossword.
- Yeah.

688
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,960
She followed me here.

689
00:41:06,062 --> 00:41:08,553
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

690
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:12,726
I mean, I saw her at the bridge, and I- I think
she's with the protesters. She has red boots.

691
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:14,565
- Is she attractive?
- I mean, who cares?

692
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:18,163
I've been married to the same woman
for nine years. I care.

693
00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:21,300
- I think she thinks that I invited her here.
- Did you?

694
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:24,039
No. I mean, well-

695
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:26,047
Kind of. I mean-

696
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:29,550
But I was just trying to be nice, you know,
to get her out of my truck.

697
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:32,018
You could have tried "Get out of my truck. "

698
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:34,555
I can't be held responsible
for being a nice guy, right?

699
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:38,093
No. Of course not.
Unless she's doing a crossword all about you...

700
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:40,856
and following you
across the country like a stalker.

701
00:41:40,964 --> 00:41:43,432
Stalker?

702
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:45,763
- Who has a stalker?
- Steve does. Big-time.

703
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:48,394
- No, no, no, no. What?
- Big-time.

704
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:50,939
Really? What's going on with that?

705
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,340
<i>No, I was telling him about Mary. Remember
Mary, the blind date my parents set me up on?</i>

706
00:41:55,445 --> 00:41:57,379
She was on me like a mountain lion in the truck.

707
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,074
Great in theory, but... wouldn't stop talking.

708
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:02,083
She was like a talking encyclopedia.

709
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:06,044
So, uh, is she here, or-

710
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:08,020
No. No, no, no. I think she went up-

711
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:10,422
Red boots, with the protesters. Hot.

712
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:12,495
Red boots?

713
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:14,893
- You bang a fireman?
- No.

714
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:17,762
No, I did not bang a fireman.

715
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:20,028
Hmm.

716
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:23,469
All right.
I'm gonna go outside...

717
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:26,736
and get some, uh, snacks.

718
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:29,243
<i>- You want anything?
- Oh, man. I could use a club soda...</i>

719
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:31,973
<i>with shaved ice with a twist oflemon.</i>

720
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:40,349
- Awesome. He's getting me drinks.
- You think that's where he's going?

721
00:42:40,456 --> 00:42:42,890
- Yeah! - That's not where he's going.
I don't know what he's up to.

722
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:44,755
He's always thinking about something.

723
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:48,295
<i>- # Save the leg, my friend #
- This glue is making me high.</i>

724
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:51,799
<i>- # Save the leg # - It's the,
uh- It's the methylbenzene in there, Winston.</i>

725
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:53,801
<i>- Give me that.
- # Save the leg, my friend ##</i>

726
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:56,167
Here.

727
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:58,240
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hi.

728
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:00,241
- Uh, can I help?
- Oh, sure.

729
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:03,676
Mary, have you met Howard?
Howard, Mary. Mary, Howard.

730
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,841
- How do you do?
- Uh, I'm not quite sure what you mean.

731
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:10,419
Uh-

732
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,114
I'm just gonna sit down.

733
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:15,690
- So, what can I do?
- Can you, um- Can you do the ribbon?

734
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:18,488
- Yes.
- Okay. Here's scissors if you need them.

735
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:23,464
- Mary.
- Oh, hey. That's that news guy.

736
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:25,193
Hartman Hughes.

737
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:28,099
So, this is the pro-legger camp.

738
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:30,172
- Yeah.
- Handsome group.

739
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:32,173
<i>That's right.</i>

740
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:34,607
You folks are all for
keeping Baby Peggy abnormal.

741
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:37,942
- Abnormal?
- Extra legs equals extra awesomeness.

742
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:39,981
<i>Yeah.</i>

743
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:43,109
- She'd just be like the tree frog.
- Come again?

744
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:45,346
A trematode parasite causes polymely-

745
00:43:45,455 --> 00:43:48,049
that means "extra limbs" - in-in tree frogs. Yeah.

746
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:50,557
Happens all the time. It's -It's totally normal.

747
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,026
<i>- In some ponds,there's a quarter
of the tree frogs- - Hartman Hughes!</i>

748
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:55,120
with extra limbs,
and sometimes they found that if-

749
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:57,131
You know, over at the media tent...

750
00:43:57,233 --> 00:43:59,599
we're gonna take a break in a few minutes...

751
00:43:59,702 --> 00:44:02,466
and, uh, sure enough like you to join me.

752
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:05,905
Oh.
I can't. Um, I have flute lessons.

753
00:44:09,012 --> 00:44:12,573
Will Steve be there?

754
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,341
- Who do you think sent me?
- Oh.

755
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:18,886
<i>All right, girl. You go, girl.</i>

756
00:44:18,988 --> 00:44:21,513
Go on to that media tent with your bad self.

757
00:44:21,624 --> 00:44:23,524
<i>Go get your man, honey.</i>

758
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:25,560
<i>- I'll be right back.
- Holler if you need backup.</i>

759
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:29,428
- Did Steve tell you all about the
crossword I did for him? - Oh, yeah.

760
00:44:29,532 --> 00:44:32,296
There's no words to describe
how much it meant to him.

761
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:34,597
Oh, but there are. There are always words.

762
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:36,604
- You know-
- Yes?

763
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:39,641
It's easy to see
why he fell for you the way he did.

764
00:44:39,742 --> 00:44:41,710
Oh.

765
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:44,913
So, he, uh- Oh, yeah.

766
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:48,006
he told you all about
the incredible connection and intensity...

767
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:50,017
- and je ne sais quoi?
- Oh, yeah.

768
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:52,087
He told me about the quoi.

769
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:54,452
He wouldn't shut his piehole about the quoi.

770
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:58,015
But, you know, his bliss is tempered with fear.

771
00:44:58,127 --> 00:44:59,685
- Oh.
- When you saw him today...

772
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:03,027
did he seem like a man
whose heart and loins were full of joy?

773
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:05,600
<i>Um-</i>

774
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,466
I- I-I-I don't know. I don't know if- if-

775
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:10,471
- Mmm, no.
- No.

776
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:12,473
- It's because he's afraid, Mary.
- Oh.

777
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:15,635
He's afraid you're gonna... break his heart.

778
00:45:15,745 --> 00:45:18,646
But I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that to Steve. I could never do that.

779
00:45:18,748 --> 00:45:21,239
- I'm incapable-
- Shh.

780
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,012
You rest those pretty little mouth pillows, huh?

781
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,884
You're gonna need 'em later
for all sorts of naughtiness.

782
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:29,549
What I need to know from you right now...

783
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:34,289
are you gonna stick around long enough
to help us work through Steve's fear?

784
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:36,297
- Oh. Of course. Of course. Yes.
- Ah.

785
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:39,459
- If he tells you to go, you don't go.
- Mm-hmm. No? Okay.

786
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:44,472
Mm-mmm. He starts throwing words around
like "cuckoo" and "loony" and "crazy"...

787
00:45:44,574 --> 00:45:46,474
- that's his fear talking.
- Oh.

788
00:45:46,576 --> 00:45:48,476
- All right?
- Okay. Okay. Yes.

789
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:52,446
If he tries to run away, I want you to grab him.

790
00:45:52,548 --> 00:45:55,642
- Okay. - And with the strength
that God gives you, hang on.

791
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,242
- Be calm and focused.
- Okay. Okay.

792
00:45:57,353 --> 00:45:59,253
- You wanna know why?
- Why? Yeah. Why?

793
00:45:59,355 --> 00:46:01,687
You're the rock in this relationship.

794
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,691
I'm the rock.

795
00:46:03,793 --> 00:46:07,285
- You're the glue that holds it together.
- I'm the glue. Okay.

796
00:46:07,396 --> 00:46:10,331
Right here. Look at me. Focus.

797
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:14,302
Are you gonna soldier on...

798
00:46:14,403 --> 00:46:16,303
no matter what happens?

799
00:46:16,405 --> 00:46:18,635
Of course.

800
00:46:18,741 --> 00:46:20,641
- Of course.
- Good.

801
00:46:20,743 --> 00:46:24,201
- You know what I see in those big,
beautiful eyes?

802
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:27,214
Plica semilunaris secretions?

803
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:29,216
Do I have something in my eye?

804
00:46:31,287 --> 00:46:33,346
Bravery.

805
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,723
Hmm. Well, I'm a little nervous.

806
00:46:37,827 --> 00:46:42,355
- Now you go get your Steve on.
- Okay. Okay.

807
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:45,127
<i>- You said she was hyper?
- Yeah, she's really hyper.</i>

808
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:47,566
That's good. That's good.
The calm and focused ones...

809
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,036
they keep all that bottled up inside,
and before you know it-

810
00:46:52,575 --> 00:46:55,544
You know? But as long as she's hyper,
you don't have to worry about it.

811
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:57,840
One thing she isn't is calm.

812
00:46:57,947 --> 00:47:00,211
- Dude.
- Something you wanna tell me?

813
00:47:00,316 --> 00:47:02,409
- Dude. Is that her?
- Hmm?

814
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:04,486
Is that her?

815
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,924
Oh.

816
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:10,993
Want some?

817
00:47:14,997 --> 00:47:16,828
Okay.

818
00:47:16,933 --> 00:47:19,834
- How'd she get in here?
- I don't know. She's calm.

819
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:25,437
Boy, did I miss you, Steven with a "V."

820
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:28,772
- Let's go for a talk outside.
- Okay. Walkie-talk.

821
00:47:28,878 --> 00:47:30,778
- Right out here.
- Okay.

822
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,848
All right.

823
00:47:34,016 --> 00:47:36,780
- Oops. Yes?
- Okay.

824
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:38,911
- You can't stay here.
- Sure I can.

825
00:47:39,021 --> 00:47:41,216
- No.
- That's the beauty of my job. I can send in...

826
00:47:41,324 --> 00:47:44,293
- crossword puzzles from anywhere in the world.
- No. Listen. Listen. Okay.

827
00:47:44,393 --> 00:47:46,953
- Listen to me.
- Mm-hmm?

828
00:47:47,063 --> 00:47:49,031
I don't want you here. Okay?

829
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:51,031
But you said.

830
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:53,465
I said- I know- I'm a guy. Okay?

831
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:55,867
We say things we don't mean.

832
00:47:55,972 --> 00:47:59,135
Well, then, how do I know
you mean what you're saying now...

833
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:02,700
- when you said you didn't mean what you said?
- That's crazy.

834
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:05,542
Well, see, that's your fear talking.

835
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:08,208
Why are you so calm?

836
00:48:08,317 --> 00:48:11,616
How come you're not more hyper?
That's freaking me out a bit. I gotta be honest.

837
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:13,985
- Steve, it's all gonna be okay.
- I know it is, if you-

838
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:15,990
Maybe even wonderful.

839
00:48:16,092 --> 00:48:18,617
- Hartman Hughes told me everything.
- What?

840
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:20,628
- I talked to Hartman Hughes.
- When did you talk to him?

841
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,721
- It doesn't matter.
- Did he- Did he come get you?

842
00:48:22,832 --> 00:48:24,732
- Steve.
- Where is he? Hughes.

843
00:48:24,834 --> 00:48:28,930
Steven, Steven, Steven, Steven. Come here.
Look at me. You here? Are you here with me?

844
00:48:29,038 --> 00:48:30,938
- Okay.
- Focus. Right here. Okay? Look at me.

845
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,840
"Intimate relationships
cannot substitute for a life plan...

846
00:48:34,944 --> 00:48:37,845
"but to have any meaning or validity at all...

847
00:48:37,947 --> 00:48:41,280
a life plan must include intimate relationships. "

848
00:48:41,384 --> 00:48:43,079
Do you know who said that?

849
00:48:43,185 --> 00:48:44,618
- Jesus?
- Harriet Lerner.

850
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,654
- Oh.
- Psychologist, lecturer and author...

851
00:48:46,756 --> 00:48:50,749
<i>of the timeless classic
Franny B. Kranny, There's a Bird in Your Hair!</i>

852
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,693
- I was gonna run for governor, but-
- Hey, Hughes.

853
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:55,024
<i>- Come here.
- Hey.</i>

854
00:48:55,131 --> 00:48:57,827
- Come here.
- Steve.

855
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,925
- Yes, sir.
- This another one of your pranks? Huh?

856
00:49:00,036 --> 00:49:03,836
I don't know what you're into, lago,
but you better tell her the truth, okay?

857
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,432
I'm a newsman.
I'm incapable of saying anything but the truth.

858
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:12,674
Okay. Well, then tell her you lied and-
and that I really-

859
00:49:12,782 --> 00:49:14,682
I don't want you here. I'm sorry.

860
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:16,376
Okay.

861
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:26,057
Sorry. Just...

862
00:49:26,162 --> 00:49:28,562
<i>things didn't work out.</i>

863
00:49:28,664 --> 00:49:30,598
You're gonna find a great guy.

864
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,167
Baby.

865
00:49:32,268 --> 00:49:34,395
What is that?

866
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:37,563
I want you guys to have a baby.

867
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:39,038
Why?

868
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:40,802
You guys belong together.

869
00:49:42,111 --> 00:49:44,170
- I'm gonna hit you, man.
- Aw, come on.

870
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,646
You're not gonna hit the face of CCN-

871
00:49:46,749 --> 00:49:51,186
Stop it! "Victory attained through violence
is tantamount to defeat, for it is momentary. "

872
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:53,414
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Do you know who said it? Gandhi. Gandhi.

873
00:49:53,522 --> 00:49:55,752
- What are you afraid of?
- What am I afraid of?

874
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:58,793
You don't want her to know about
"I heart Mary" carved in a tree trunk?

875
00:49:58,894 --> 00:50:00,885
Why are you putting stuff like that in her head?

876
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,897
- You said that?
- No, I never said that.

877
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:05,365
Maybe you're afraid the great Hartman Hughes
is gonna steal her away.

878
00:50:05,468 --> 00:50:08,869
- You're crazy!
- I'm like Helen ofTroy. No fights!

879
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:11,997
Hey, guys!
Baby Peggy's parents settled.

880
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:15,600
- Steve, your camera.
- Oh, Jesus, Angus!

881
00:50:15,711 --> 00:50:17,235
- Sorry. Sorry.
- See what happens?

882
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:18,904
You mess with me, you mess with my boy.

883
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,449
- Mary, stay! Mary, stay!
- But you-

884
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,415
<i>- Mary!
- Call the station.</i>

885
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,412
<i>- Mary!
- We're live in two minutes!</i>

886
00:50:26,522 --> 00:50:28,251
Tissue.

887
00:50:28,357 --> 00:50:31,952
With mere hours to spare,
the Agueros reconciled...

888
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:36,589
agreeing to halt surgery until Baby Peggy
is old enough to decide for herself.

889
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:40,465
It's time for the Agueros
to be a family once again.

890
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:43,504
So today, like the noble tree frog...

891
00:50:43,606 --> 00:50:46,200
whose third leg is nothing if not natural...

892
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:50,074
<i>Baby Peggy marches on
with her three-legged life.</i>

893
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:52,079
Steve! I'm coming. Excuse me.

894
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:54,581
<i>Medical emergency.
Thank you. Please allow me through.</i>

895
00:50:54,683 --> 00:50:56,446
Possible concussion, could faint at any time.

896
00:50:56,552 --> 00:50:59,248
- Steve, I'm coming.
- No, no. Ma'am, you can't go back there.

897
00:51:04,727 --> 00:51:06,752
<i>Are you all right?</i>

898
00:51:06,862 --> 00:51:09,092
Could someone please help him?

899
00:51:09,198 --> 00:51:12,725
Maybe apply a vasoconstrictor
or a nasal tampon? Please.

900
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:16,566
She trying to kill me? She's trying to kill me.

901
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:20,574
This is Hartman Hughes report-

902
00:51:20,676 --> 00:51:22,576
What the hell was that?

903
00:51:22,678 --> 00:51:24,908
It's this girl who Steve invited, sir.

904
00:51:25,014 --> 00:51:28,814
I didn't invite her. She's stalking me.

905
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:31,478
Never mind.

906
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:33,714
There's a hurricane off the coast ofTexas.
Get to it.

907
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:35,723
I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.

908
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:38,692
If you three weren't the closest crew to
Galveston, you'd be hitchhiking home by now.

909
00:51:38,794 --> 00:51:40,694
- Yes, sir.
- Get off the phone.

910
00:51:40,796 --> 00:51:43,321
Did you hear that about the tree frog?

911
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:46,094
Every time she speaks, I smell anchor desk.

912
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:49,035
I get it, Hartman. You're trying
to get back at me, but Mary's not the way.

913
00:51:49,138 --> 00:51:51,163
She's insane. She tried to kill me.

914
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:52,604
Hartman, something's wrong with her.

915
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,903
- You didn't see that?
- You fell down. Boo-hoo.

916
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:57,069
I fell down? My legs were
taken out from under me.

917
00:51:57,179 --> 00:51:59,374
What are you talking about? She's stalking me.

918
00:51:59,482 --> 00:52:01,313
<i>- Dude, she's not stalking you.
- Steve!</i>

919
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:04,614
Oh, shit!
Tell her I'm not here. Tell her I'm not here.

920
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,017
- Steve. Hi, guys.
- Hello, Mary.

921
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,716
Hi. I'm so sorry I was detained.

922
00:52:08,824 --> 00:52:11,190
<i>I was questioned by authorities about an
apparent crime against one of your coworkers.</i>

923
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:13,056
But all's been resolved. Steve.

924
00:52:13,162 --> 00:52:15,790
Considering you almost cost us our job,
maybe now's not a great time.

925
00:52:15,898 --> 00:52:19,163
I'm so sorry.
I could call your employer and apologize.

926
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:21,065
I can actually apologize
in 17 different languages.

927
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:24,003
Huh.

928
00:52:24,106 --> 00:52:27,507
So, Mary, we're going to Galveston.
There's a big storm there.

929
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,305
- What do you know about Galveston?
- What are you doing?

930
00:52:29,411 --> 00:52:32,812
Great. Galveston.
Well, Galveston's the South's new gay mecca-

931
00:52:32,915 --> 00:52:34,906
one of the country's
top 10 gay-friendliest cities.

932
00:52:35,017 --> 00:52:37,144
- Huh. Gay friendly, Angus.
- Yeah. Hi, Steve.

933
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:38,720
Is she running alongside the van?

934
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:40,516
<i>- What else you got?
- Oh.</i>

935
00:52:40,623 --> 00:52:42,921
<i>- Biggest natural disaster in American history.
- Really?</i>

936
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:46,324
Over 6,000 dead in Galveston alone. Yeah.
Ten- Can I have that?

937
00:52:46,428 --> 00:52:50,387
<i>- Ten nuns and 90 orphans.
- Angus, go faster.</i>

938
00:52:50,499 --> 00:52:53,593
- Ask her why she's following me. Please.
- Why are you stalking him?

939
00:52:53,702 --> 00:52:57,570
I'm not-
I'm not stalking. No, I'm not stalking.

940
00:52:57,673 --> 00:52:59,868
Stalking's an obsessive pursuit of prey.

941
00:52:59,975 --> 00:53:02,102
But you're kind of
following alongside his van.

942
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:03,678
Who wouldn't?

943
00:53:03,779 --> 00:53:08,182
Steven is a smart, decent, loving-
If he allows himself, right?

944
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:11,014
Loving, talented human being
with deep-seated fears.

945
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,055
<i>- I'm not going anywhere, Steve.
I'm your rock. I'm your glue. - Mary.</i>

946
00:53:14,156 --> 00:53:16,386
- Steve, hi.
- Go home. Go.

947
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:21,124
Oh.

948
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,596
You should come!

949
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:31,239
<i>You know what
word you never see in crosswords?</i>

950
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:35,106
<i>"Go. " That or any other two-letter words.</i>

951
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,475
<i>The word "go"- not fun.</i>

952
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,481
<i>The word "vamoose"- now that's super fun.</i>

953
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:45,145
<i>Yes. Crosswords are a lot like life in that way.</i>

954
00:53:45,254 --> 00:53:47,745
<i>They're only boring
if you have no sense of adventure.</i>

955
00:53:47,856 --> 00:53:51,292
We didn't get to light all the candles, Howard.

956
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:53,361
- That's okay. We can save them.
- Okay. Ooh.

957
00:53:53,462 --> 00:53:55,623
Hi, Mary. Where you been?

958
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:59,030
I'm -I'm going to-
I'm going to go meet Steve at his next job.

959
00:53:59,134 --> 00:54:00,829
- Oh.
- Yeah. Galveston.

960
00:54:00,936 --> 00:54:02,733
Yes, it's a storm.

961
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:06,399
<i>Could you sign my autograph
book before you go?</i>

962
00:54:06,508 --> 00:54:09,306
Yeah, if I, uh- If I had a- a car...

963
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:12,312
<i>on my way to Galveston,
I could go through Durant, Oklahoma...</i>

964
00:54:12,414 --> 00:54:15,144
where they have the world's largest peanut.

965
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:18,448
I love peanuts, especially the giant ones.

966
00:54:18,554 --> 00:54:20,954
- Yeah, well, who doesn't?
- I know.

967
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:23,115
Love them.

968
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:25,090
<i>- There you go.
- I'll drive.</i>

969
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:29,097
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

970
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:33,228
All right. Vamoose.

971
00:54:37,973 --> 00:54:39,873
Vamoose indeed.

972
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:44,876
- So, uh, what kind of car do you have?
- A Gremlin.

973
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,345
- What year?
- '76.

974
00:54:46,448 --> 00:54:48,916
- Did you replace the two-wire
ignition connector? - Yes.

975
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:52,476
The reverse doesn't work, and sometimes
it stalls. But otherwise, it's good as new.

976
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:53,748
This storm could be nasty.

977
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:55,619
Are we sure that we wanna drive into it?

978
00:54:55,724 --> 00:54:57,624
Come on. How bad could it be, right?

979
00:54:57,793 --> 00:55:00,762
<i>Storm Watch!</i>

980
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,822
<i>Hurricane LaQuisha expected to make landfall
by tomorrow morning.</i>

981
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:07,527
And what makes this situation
even more frightening-

982
00:55:07,636 --> 00:55:10,332
that area ofTexas currently in the midst...

983
00:55:10,439 --> 00:55:13,738
of the worst tornado season in history.

984
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:16,402
And here's where things get interesting.

985
00:55:16,512 --> 00:55:18,878
<i>Add a looming cicada migration...</i>

986
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:22,417
<i>and no one knows just how devastating
this storm could be.</i>

987
00:55:22,518 --> 00:55:26,215
Did you know that back in the '80s when
everyone's concern was with the aerosol cans...

988
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:29,849
it was actually the cows and their gases...

989
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:33,018
which were actually
doing the most damage to the ozone layer?

990
00:55:35,731 --> 00:55:38,996
<i>- # Turn off your radio #
- # Come on, come on #</i>

991
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:42,195
<i># You're gonna feel all right #</i>

992
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:45,740
<i># Let's do the panic tonight ##</i>

993
00:55:49,912 --> 00:55:52,847
A little wrinkled old lady.

994
00:55:52,948 --> 00:55:56,076
Yeah, that's Mother Teresa.
She's my best seller.

995
00:55:56,185 --> 00:55:58,278
<i>- I'm an apple sculptor.
- Really?</i>

996
00:55:58,387 --> 00:56:00,821
I love apples.

997
00:56:00,923 --> 00:56:02,618
- Yeah?
- I do.

998
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:05,455
Well, I went to school for physics,
but I got bored.

999
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:10,362
So I, uh- So now I just make these and
sell them on AppleHeadsRule. com.

1000
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:12,297
<i>Here, let me show you another one.</i>

1001
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:14,301
<i>- Oh! Clay Aiken!
- Yeah, it's Clay Aiken.</i>

1002
00:56:14,403 --> 00:56:17,338
I love him!

1003
00:56:17,439 --> 00:56:19,407
You know, I was sitting at home...

1004
00:56:19,508 --> 00:56:23,444
just thinking that I had
everything I needed right there.

1005
00:56:23,545 --> 00:56:28,608
And then I just thought,
maybe there's more, you know?

1006
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:31,117
Maybe this is the road I'm supposed to be on.

1007
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:38,316
Maybe it is.

1008
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:41,988
<i>And now we go out to Hartman Hughes,
who's enjoying some fresh air.</i>

1009
00:56:42,097 --> 00:56:44,531
Hartman, not getting too wet, are you?

1010
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:49,593
Paula, the only thing keeping me
from falling into the bottomless depths...

1011
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:52,230
of these shark-infested waters...

1012
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:54,673
is this flimsy two-by-four railing.

1013
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:58,508
<i>And the Galvestonians here
are hoping that this storm...</i>

1014
00:56:58,614 --> 00:57:02,243
will not surpass the storm of 1900...

1015
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:05,650
when 6,000 people lost their lives-

1016
00:57:05,754 --> 00:57:09,485
nuns, orphans washed out to sea.

1017
00:57:10,526 --> 00:57:14,155
This is Hartman Hughes in Galveston...

1018
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:18,290
in the middle of a mild storm...

1019

<i>reporting from the edge.</i>

1020
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:24,937
All right. Good work.

1021
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,940
- Good job.
- Happy to help!

1022
00:57:28,444 --> 00:57:31,777
- Holy shit! There's Mary!
- Where?

1023
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:38,285
- You know, you're an asshole!
- Hmm!

1024
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:40,752
You know what? I love dressing up. I do.

1025
00:57:40,856 --> 00:57:43,484
But, guys, those panties are short on sparkle.

1026
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:45,719
Thank the good Lord for the BeDazzler.

1027
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:52,493
Guys? Hold on!

1028
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:54,535
- Oh, crap!
- Oh, God!

1029
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,637
<i>Okay, reverse! Reverse!</i>

1030
00:57:59,741 --> 00:58:01,675
The car won't start! Reverse doesn't work!

1031
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:03,404
- Oh, my God!
- Put it in drive!

1032
00:58:03,512 --> 00:58:06,310
- I can't! It's stalled!
- Okay. Oh, God!

00:58:06,415 --> 00:58:09,976
<i>It will not start. What are we gonna do?</i>

1034
00:58:10,085 --> 00:58:11,552
Okay, okay. Uh- Uh-

1035
00:58:11,653 --> 00:58:13,245
<i>- Crap!

1036
00:58:13,355 --> 00:58:16,085
- Okay. Okay.

1037
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,818
Guys, come on!

1038
00:58:17,926 --> 00:58:19,826

1039

Ow, ow, ow!

00:58:27,803 --> 00:58:30,567
Come on! Keep running!

- Come on!
- We have to hurry!

1042
00:58:33,976 --> 00:58:37,571
Everybody get in!
Get in and go all the way down! Hurry!

1043
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:38,976
It's blocked!

1044
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:41,606
We're gonna be okay though.
We're gonna be fine.

1045
00:58:41,717 --> 00:58:43,446
Yea! Ponchos!

Oh. Oh! Oh!

Insecta Hemiptera

1052
00:58:58,834 --> 00:59:00,233
Cicada.

1053
00:59:00,335 --> 00:59:02,701
This species only comes around every 17 years!

1054

<i>Add these very, very smart
cicadas to a tornado...</i>

1055
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:09,405
it's like a once-in-a-lifetime natural miracle!

1056
00:59:09,511 --> 00:59:12,639
- Do you know how lucky we are?
- Cool.

1057
00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:22,217
Shit!

<i>Curse words.</i>

<i>Swearing, profanity, expletives-a good old cuss.</i>

1060
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:31,891
<i>Maybe these words aren't
such a good idea in some places...</i>

1061
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,468
<i>such as crosswords or kindergarten...</i>

1062

<i>but when amongst friends and in a sewer...</i>

1063
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,672
<i>it's perfectly acceptable

1064
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:52,909
My car.

1065
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,763
- Storm's over. What else is happening?
- All quiet.

1066
01:00:06,868 --> 01:00:08,995
Hey, Chris, any celebrities
arrested for drunk driving today?

1067
01:00:09,104 --> 01:00:11,504
Give me the phone.

1068
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:14,701
Angus, how in the hell
do you miss a "tornadocane"?

1069
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:18,439
- Please, give us another chance. - If you
keep this up, you're leaving me no choice.

1070
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:21,311
- Please, sir, I- - Get me downed street signs,
damaged boats, drowned puppies-

1071
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:22,747
whatever.

1072
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:25,479
And then I want you all in my office
Tuesday morning at 9:00.

1073
01:00:25,587 --> 01:00:27,179
Sir, I'm sorry, sir, I-

1074
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:29,189
They're through, all of them. Finished.

1075
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:34,729
Find out if Vasquez is happy at NNC.

1076
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,458
We need to go shoot some B-roll
of the storm damage.

1077
01:00:37,566 --> 01:00:39,261
I'm not scared of love.

1078
01:00:39,368 --> 01:00:41,632
I went on one date with her, Mom.
I went on one date with her.

<i>B- roll?</i>

1080
01:00:44,873 --> 01:00:47,671
A complete waste of my handsome gifts.

1081
01:00:47,776 --> 01:00:50,040
Where's a decent tragedy

1084
01:01:27,382 --> 01:01:29,577
No!

1085
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:31,619
You can knit this handy purse.

1086
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,881
- But my favorite project-
- Sorry. We're gonna have to interrupt.

1087
01:01:33,989 --> 01:01:36,856
Breaking news from Silver Plume, Colorado.

1088
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:40,917
A group of hearing-impaired children
have plummeted into an abandoned mine shaft.

1089
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:43,725
- Yeah, I just heard.
Who are we sending to cover it?

1090
01:01:43,832 --> 01:01:46,266
What?

1091
01:01:46,368 --> 01:01:48,928
<i>- ... blissfully unaware of what lay ahead.
- Is there no one else?</i>

<i>- Judy, John, back to you.
- Now that's a great story.</i>

Angus, where'd you get those?

1098
01:02:04,986 --> 01:02:08,422
- Hmm?
- Mary could have planted those.

1099
01:02:08,523 --> 01:02:11,856
- Think she poisoned our chips?
- Well, can you prove that she didn't?

1100
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,428
Huh? Did you buy them? I didn't buy them.

1101
01:02:14,529 --> 01:02:17,089
Did you buy-
You don't buy anything. Did you buy them?

1102
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:20,100
<i>You know, poisoning is the number
one murder method for crazy women.</i>

1103
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:22,102
Are you kidding me?

1104
01:02:22,204 --> 01:02:24,069
- Nope.
- Hey!

1105
01:02:24,172 --> 01:02:27,801
Everything's gotta go out.
We gotta flush it. We gotta flush it, guys.

1106
01:02:27,909 --> 01:02:30,173
Give a hoot. Don't pollute.

1107
01:02:36,585 --> 01:02:38,485
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

1108

You know, my old man was
a combat journalist in 'Nam.

<i>Hard to fill those boots, huh?</i>

1110
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:48,854
Got killed before I ever had a chance

1111
01:02:50,332 --> 01:02:52,459
Yeah, if I ever get that anchor desk...

<i>What are you writing?
You're not telling her where we're going?</i>

I'm making some notes! Leave me alone!

1121
01:03:15,157 --> 01:03:16,988
- Stop it! - No way!

1122
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:20,528
Steve! Steve! Steve! Steve!

1123
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:23,223
Oh, Jesus! She's got a machete!
Where the hell did she get a machete?

1124
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:25,799
<i>Oh, man! She's gonna pluck my eyes out, man!</i>

1125

1128
01:03:33,608 --> 01:03:36,076
I'm not gonna be able to walk!
She's gonna make me eat my legs!

1129
01:03:36,178 --> 01:03:38,009
She's gonna make you eat your legs?

1130
01:03:38,113 --> 01:03:40,172
- Yeah, I read about it!
- Oh, really?

1131
01:03:40,282 --> 01:03:42,250
What, some sort of pimento leg loaf?

<i>You look like an orange with lips!</i>

1140

You look like a wrinkled peach!

And you! Geraldo! Lose the wig!

1142

<i>Who you fooling?
Oh, that's a great disguise, Einstein.</i>

<i>Mary is not a psycho. You're the psycho.</i>

You know what one of my favorite ingredients
of crosswording is? Perseverance.

1157

If you quit a puzzle, you can't finish it.

1158
01:05:27,255 --> 01:05:29,155
Sure, every once in a while,
you run into a doozy...

that you don't think you could ever solve
in a million years...

Eventually.

Worst thing you can do is leave it unfinished.

It's never the solution, is it?

1164

- You know what my
favorite part of a crossword is?

1165

When you realize you know something
you didn't think you knew.

Maybe.

Hey, what's he doing with his hands?

1175
01:06:38,193 --> 01:06:40,093
Son of a bitch.

Three, two, one.

1180
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:55,904
Elation here in Colorado...

and yet danger lurking at every corner...

1182

as rescuers bring the "besmudged"
little cherubs up one at a time.

1183

Thank God they're all right.

1184
01:07:10,191 --> 01:07:12,250
Thank you, God.

1185

01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:15,344
"How do I keep my family safe
from abandoned mines?

1209
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:18,078
<i>"Is my bedroom-and more to the point-</i>

1210
01:09:18,186 --> 01:09:19,483
Holy shit.

1211
01:09:19,587 --> 01:09:22,818
<i>"my king-sized bed- on top
of an abandoned mine?</i>

on top of an abandoned mine?

1213
01:09:26,861 --> 01:09:29,659
<i>- Are abandoned mines always unsafe?"
- Did you see that?</i>

1214
01:09:29,764 --> 01:09:32,756
- Mary's in the hole.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1215

<i>Somebody else went in!</i>

1216

<i>Cut! Get over there!</i>

1217
01:09:37,772 --> 01:09:39,501
- Get back from the tape now!
- What?

1218
01:09:39,607 --> 01:09:41,268
<i>Come on, handheld. Come on, let's go!</i>

1219
01:09:41,376 --> 01:09:43,207
Did somebody fall in the mine?

1220
01:09:46,281 --> 01:09:49,341
Tell her help is on the way.
We're working on getting a new crane.

1221
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:51,782
We just need her to confirm she's conscious.

1222
01:09:51,886 --> 01:09:53,854
Here. Give me that.

1223
01:09:53,955 --> 01:09:55,855
<i>All rescue personnel on scene...</i>

1224
01:09:55,957 --> 01:09:59,358
<i>apparently we have another victim
who has gone into the hole at the mine.</i>

1225
01:10:15,343 --> 01:10:17,971
Okay, I am not afraid.

1226
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:22,448
I'm not afraid, nor am I affrightened.

1227
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:24,450
Okay.

1228
01:10:30,358 --> 01:10:32,258
Uh-

1229
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,260
Hello!

1230
01:10:34,362 --> 01:10:36,762
It is me, Mary Horowitz.

1231
01:10:36,864 --> 01:10:40,095
Yes, I seem to have fallen into the mine.

1232
01:10:40,201 --> 01:10:43,034
Hello? Everyone?

1233
01:10:43,137 --> 01:10:46,732
It's, uh, me, Mary Horowitz. Hello?

1234
01:10:46,841 --> 01:10:49,605
People, please move back.

1235
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:52,271
<i>- Back up! Back it up.
- This ground is unstable.</i>

1236
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:56,476
So she just dove in that hole, like a gopher.

1237
01:10:56,584 --> 01:10:59,849
No, dude, not like a gopher.
Like a human being.

1238
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:02,081
She was running after me,
and she fell in the hole.

1239
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:04,317
<i>That's the way to get
your heads out of your asses.</i>

1240
01:11:04,425 --> 01:11:07,258
That shot of Steve's girlfriend
falling into the pit is priceless.

1241
01:11:07,362 --> 01:11:10,263
We've got the inside advantage here,
so let's use it.

1242
01:11:10,365 --> 01:11:12,663
Get Steve ready to go on
and talk about his girlfriend...

1243
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:14,997
as soon as we get the graphics together.

1244
01:11:15,103 --> 01:11:17,765
Fifteen minutes.

1245
01:11:17,872 --> 01:11:20,136
- Here he comes!
- You people are ruining the ferns!

1246
01:11:20,241 --> 01:11:23,904
Can you comment on the rumors that Mary's fall
into the mine was a suicide attempt?

1247
01:11:24,012 --> 01:11:27,345
Well-That's ridiculous. Not our Mary.

1248
01:11:27,448 --> 01:11:31,885
The word "depression" is not in her vocabulary.

1249
01:11:31,986 --> 01:11:35,387
All right, obviously it is in her vocabulary.

1250
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:37,390
But no. No.

1251
01:11:37,492 --> 01:11:39,892
She-She never lets anything get her down.

1252
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:42,656
Still living at home at her age-
clearly not a normal situation.

1253
01:11:42,764 --> 01:11:44,129
Not normal?

1254
01:11:44,232 --> 01:11:45,790
We-We love having her here.

1255
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,492
<i>Sir, I'd like to ask another question.</i>

1256
01:11:47,602 --> 01:11:49,900
- Yes. Yes, we love having her here.
- Yes, we do.

1257
01:11:50,004 --> 01:11:51,995
Fumigation can't be rushed.

1258
01:11:53,908 --> 01:11:56,342
One more question!

1259
01:11:56,444 --> 01:11:58,742
Now, I don't wanna speculate here...

1260
01:11:58,846 --> 01:12:00,871
<i>- but if the ground did collapse...
- Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

1261
01:12:00,982 --> 01:12:02,882
<i>could that not result in death...</i>

1262
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:06,852
<i>or, at the absolute least,
horrible disfigurement?</i>

1263
01:12:06,954 --> 01:12:11,220
I don't wanna speculate either,
but, yes, absolutely, it could.

1264
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:13,988
And as we await the tragic
fate of Mary Horowitz...

1265
01:12:14,095 --> 01:12:17,861
attention now on the boots she was wearing
when she slipped into the mine...

1266
01:12:17,965 --> 01:12:21,093
a story I couldn't tell
until I'd walked a mile in Mary's shoes.

1267
01:12:21,202 --> 01:12:22,669
Take a look.

1268
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:27,730
It's hour one, and it's as if
my feet have been placed in vise grips.

1269
01:12:29,377 --> 01:12:33,074
We're at the two-hour mark,
and, actually, right now I feel pretty-

1270
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:35,945
Oh!

1271
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:39,213
<i>Light source.</i>

1272
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,346

1274
01:12:53,267 --> 01:12:55,997
Oh. Voilà. Yes.

1275
01:12:56,104 --> 01:12:58,072
Yes, it's perfect. Yes. This is per-

1276
01:13:00,408 --> 01:13:02,433
Ah! Oh!

1277
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:06,070
<i>Oh, my God. They forgot one.</i>

1278
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,273
You scared the crap out of me.

1279
01:13:10,318 --> 01:13:13,515
Hi. I'm -I'm sorry.

1280
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:16,146
Uh, can you, uh-

1281
01:13:16,257 --> 01:13:20,091
Can you- Can you hear me? I mean, at all?

1282
01:13:21,195 --> 01:13:23,254
Do you have sensory-neural hearing loss...

1283
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:25,332
or do you have conductive?

1284
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:28,425
Because if-if it-

1285
01:13:28,536 --> 01:13:30,436
She doesn't hear me. Okay.

1286
01:13:30,538 --> 01:13:32,631
You know, I understand
a little bit of sign language...

1287
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:35,300
so if you wanna-you know? No? Okay.

1288
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,504
Um, "Deaf people can do anything
except for hear. "

1289
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:40,410
Do you know who said that?

1290
01:13:40,515 --> 01:13:44,076
Dr. Jordan-
first deaf president at Gallaudet U.

1291
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:47,586
Yeah. Maybe you'll go there one day.

1292
01:13:47,688 --> 01:13:49,986
If we both don't perish in here.

1293
01:13:51,726 --> 01:13:54,490
Hold on. I'll be right back.
You stay here, okay? Okay? Right.

1294
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:00,861
<i>Well, Paula, apparently they're gonna
keep it old-school and simple-</i>

1295
01:14:00,968 --> 01:14:03,129
a piece of paper, a number two pencil.

1296
01:14:03,237 --> 01:14:05,728
This is Hartman Hughes reporting from the edge.

1297
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,637
Cut. Corbitt wants you on next.

1298
01:14:07,742 --> 01:14:09,972
I told you I am not her boyfriend, Angus.

1299
01:14:10,077 --> 01:14:12,841
Yeah, but you're the one that encouraged her
to come here to begin with.

1300
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:15,438
- You're the one that asked her to come here,
not me! - Guys! Guys!

1301
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:18,451
NNC has got their hands
on everything but her panty size.

1302
01:14:18,553 --> 01:14:20,020
- What?
- Our Mary?

1303
01:14:20,121 --> 01:14:23,750
<i>- Yes.
- Son of a bitch. Vasquez scooped us?</i>

1304
01:14:27,728 --> 01:14:30,060
Behold, notice of our imminent rescue.

1305
01:14:30,164 --> 01:14:32,655
Oh, okay. Okay.

1306
01:14:32,767 --> 01:14:35,565
This is good news. This is good news, okay?

1307
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:38,332
They're going to tell us something wonderful.

1308
01:14:38,439 --> 01:14:42,398
And it says, "Mary, are you" -

1309
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:44,478
Oh.

1310
01:14:50,485 --> 01:14:52,385
That's a good sign right there.

1311
01:14:52,487 --> 01:14:54,717
Oh, God!

1312
01:14:57,859 --> 01:15:00,623
What's it say, son?

1313
01:15:00,728 --> 01:15:02,628
Millions of people are watching.

1314
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:04,220
Um, okay.

1315
01:15:04,332 --> 01:15:07,267
"I think you mean, am I conscious?
Not, am I conscience?

<i>"'Conscious'means alert and awake.</i>

1317

"'Conscience' is your inner morality gauge...

harming helpless animals and whatnot. "

1320
01:15:22,183 --> 01:15:24,344
Can we leave her down there?

1321

"To answer your question, yes, I am conscious.

I found one. She's fine,
other than not being able to hear, I mean. "

1326
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:45,598
They missed a child? Can't these people count?

1327
01:15:45,706 --> 01:15:47,765
Thank God for this woman Mary Horowitz.

1328
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:50,400
Let's bring up that picture of her again.

1329
01:15:50,511 --> 01:15:52,411
Yesterday, Mary Horowitz.

1330
01:15:52,513 --> 01:15:55,607
Today, Mary Horowitz- hero.

1331
01:15:55,716 --> 01:15:57,707
<i>- This just in-
- I'm coming to save you!</i>

1332
01:15:57,818 --> 01:16:00,912
speculation as to whether or not Mary
intentionally heaved herself into the mine...

1333
01:16:01,022 --> 01:16:03,047
to save the poor deaf child...

1334
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:06,854
after rescuers ignored her
desperate, desperate pleas.

1335
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:09,058
<i>Paula, I'm here with Steve Muller.</i>

1336
01:16:09,163 --> 01:16:11,654
Steve's girlfriend, Mary Horowitz...

1337
01:16:11,766 --> 01:16:15,224
struggling for her life
down in the abandoned mine, as we speak.

1338
01:16:15,336 --> 01:16:18,931
She's not my girlfriend, and I'm not
gonna say that just to get ratings. Okay?

1339
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,474
Yeah, and the truth is
I don't really even wanna do this.

1340
01:16:21,576 --> 01:16:24,841
<i>Mary Horowitz,
described as "freakishly intelligent. "</i>

1341
01:16:24,946 --> 01:16:28,211
These words also described
Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber.

1342
01:16:28,316 --> 01:16:31,479
However, you never know about these people.
They're clean-cut-

1343
01:16:31,586 --> 01:16:34,384
But people deserve to know the truth about her.

1344
01:16:37,091 --> 01:16:40,117
I mean, she sees things that other people don't.

1345
01:16:40,227 --> 01:16:44,357
And she's kind, and-
and I think she means well...

1346
01:16:44,465 --> 01:16:48,959
even though, when she does things,
they're just a little unusual.

1347
01:16:50,304 --> 01:16:52,363
And she's smart. She's supersmart.

1348
01:16:52,473 --> 01:16:55,237
And not in a freakish way. In-

1349
01:16:55,343 --> 01:16:58,710
Like, she has a gift.
I mean, she knows everything...

1350
01:16:58,813 --> 01:17:03,375
everything but whom not to trust
and how not to get hurt and-

1351
01:17:05,453 --> 01:17:07,421
and how to survive us.

1352
01:17:10,891 --> 01:17:13,018
And she doesn't pretend to be
somebody that she's not.

1353
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:19,191
And she certainly doesn't
deserve to be where she is now.

1354
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,995
<i>Maybe if I just do this, I can-</i>

1355
01:17:21,102 --> 01:17:23,696
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1356
01:17:28,843 --> 01:17:31,710
Yeah. The tracks down there just-

1357
01:17:31,812 --> 01:17:33,803
just keep going and going down and-

1358
01:17:33,914 --> 01:17:38,442
- If we just concentrate
on this and that and that, then we'll-

1359
01:17:38,552 --> 01:17:40,452
But not to- not to worry.

1360
01:17:40,554 --> 01:17:43,148
I'll- I'll get us out of here.

1361
01:17:44,592 --> 01:17:46,958
Hope that crane gets here soon.

1362
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:49,655
I hope so too.

1363
01:17:49,764 --> 01:17:51,664
'Cause if there's carbon monoxide down there-

1364
01:17:51,766 --> 01:17:53,666
But the air's coming through the top.

1365
01:17:53,768 --> 01:17:57,397
Even at concentrations of five ppm,
they could suffocate.

1366
01:18:04,779 --> 01:18:07,509
I am so sorry.

1367
01:18:11,686 --> 01:18:16,214
She has stolen a little piece of my heart.

1368
01:18:16,323 --> 01:18:20,589
<i>- What'd the site engineer say? - The stress
fractures are worsening by the minute.</i>

1369
01:18:20,695 --> 01:18:23,562
The longer they're down there,
the greater the chance of collapse.

1370
01:18:23,664 --> 01:18:25,188
They thought the air quality was bad...

1371
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:27,233
try a 50-foot span of rock and earth
dropping down there.

1372
01:18:27,334 --> 01:18:28,801
Oh, Jesus.

1373
01:18:28,903 --> 01:18:31,736
That's a bunch of horseshit.
She's gonna be fine.

1374
01:18:31,839 --> 01:18:34,205
Odds are she won't. We gotta go on.

1375
01:18:34,308 --> 01:18:36,674
What are we gonna say?
Say she's not gonna make it?

1376
01:18:36,777 --> 01:18:38,938
Her whole family is watching, Angus. Christ.

1377
01:18:39,046 --> 01:18:41,344
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Hughes.

1378
01:18:41,449 --> 01:18:43,349
All right, two minutes. That's it.

1379
01:18:43,451 --> 01:18:46,011
Some blind date, huh?

1380
01:18:48,255 --> 01:18:50,155
Here's a candle.

1381
01:18:52,059 --> 01:18:54,027
Hi, Winston.

1382
01:18:56,664 --> 01:19:01,101
I think I'll feel better
if I pretend that it's Mary's surprise party.

1383
01:19:05,005 --> 01:19:09,499
I'm making an apple head for Mary
for when she gets out.

1384
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:13,512
<i>- And she's gonna get out.
- # And I don't know #</i>

1385
01:19:13,614 --> 01:19:19,280
<i># Why life, it seems to be #</i>

1386
01:19:20,755 --> 01:19:26,785
<i>- This one's gonna work.
- # So hard for dreamers #</i>

1387
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:29,863
<i># Like you and me #</i>

1388
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:33,798
<i>Rescuers are desperate
for the crane to reach them within the hour.</i>

1389
01:19:33,901 --> 01:19:36,961
Helicopters are out of the question
because of all the power lines.

1390
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:39,164
Hope is fading fast.

1391
01:19:39,273 --> 01:19:42,936
The earth tremors
are getting stronger. They have to get out soon.

1392
01:19:43,043 --> 01:19:48,982
<i># Is everywhere ##</i>

1393
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:51,779
The other side. Oh!

1394
01:19:51,886 --> 01:19:54,377
Ouch too.

1395
01:20:01,996 --> 01:20:06,490
I can't do this. I can't get us out of here.

1396
01:20:10,004 --> 01:20:12,234
Guess what.

1397
01:20:12,339 --> 01:20:15,502
Mary Horowitz doesn't have the answers.

1398
01:20:15,609 --> 01:20:17,907
Or a job.

1399
01:20:21,015 --> 01:20:23,848
And-And my job mattered!

1400
01:20:26,921 --> 01:20:30,118
<i>I was the Sacramento Herald's
crossword constructor...</i>

1401
01:20:30,224 --> 01:20:33,284
and I threw it all away- for what?

1402
01:20:38,165 --> 01:20:41,862
"Mary, Steve wants you to come be with us.
He needs you. "

1403
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:45,063
Really? Methinks the media lies.

1404
01:20:45,172 --> 01:20:48,005
A little.

1405
01:20:48,108 --> 01:20:50,668
Words, people. Words.

1406
01:20:52,046 --> 01:20:55,573
There are meaningful words,
there are pointless words...

1407
01:20:55,683 --> 01:20:58,743
and then there are words that hurt.

1408
01:21:02,556 --> 01:21:06,083
"Mary, why can't you be like every other girl?"

1409
01:21:06,193 --> 01:21:10,186
<i>"Mary, where do you get
all that useless information?"</i>

1410
01:21:10,297 --> 01:21:12,424
"Mary, why do you talk like that?"

1411
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:15,195
<i>"Mary, Mary!" You know, it's just-just-</i>

1412
01:21:15,302 --> 01:21:17,327
Oh, oh! Oh! Oh!

1413
01:21:17,438 --> 01:21:20,100
And the pièce de résistance, yes.

1414
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:24,439
"Mary, why do you wear
those stupid red boots all the time?"

1415
01:21:24,545 --> 01:21:26,638
You wanna know why? Huh?

1416
01:21:26,747 --> 01:21:28,908
Do you wanna know why?
Okay, I will tell you why.

1417
01:21:29,016 --> 01:21:32,508
<i>I wear them because they make my toes feel...</i>

1418
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:36,249
like 10 friends on a camping trip.

1419
01:21:36,357 --> 01:21:38,257
That's why I wear them.

1420
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:45,855
We're finished.

1421
01:21:45,966 --> 01:21:48,935
The ground is gonna collapse.
We're gonna perish.

1422
01:21:49,036 --> 01:21:51,004
I just wanna go home.

1423
01:21:55,843 --> 01:21:57,743
Sorry.

1424
01:22:02,483 --> 01:22:06,715
<i>"I don't know what you're saying,
but you talk too much. "</i>

1425
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:10,984
I know.

1426
01:22:13,294 --> 01:22:15,194
I know.

1427
01:22:30,544 --> 01:22:33,570
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to step back.

1428
01:22:33,681 --> 01:22:36,241
<i>- Hughes!
- Not now.</i>

1429
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,443
<i>You wrote the note telling Mary to come here.</i>

1430
01:22:40,354 --> 01:22:43,517
You brought her here. And if she dies-

1431
01:22:49,797 --> 01:22:52,459
This is just a fence.

1432
01:22:52,566 --> 01:22:55,057
Being on that side of it
doesn't make you any better.

1433
01:23:01,742 --> 01:23:04,006
You did that.

1434
01:23:04,111 --> 01:23:06,375
...cheated on her taxes-
... and the red boots-

1435
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,005
<i>Does she think herself some kind of superhero?</i>

1436
01:23:09,116 --> 01:23:11,209
Mary-

1437
01:23:13,087 --> 01:23:14,884
she did this.

1438
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:14,975
He was my ticket to normal.

1439
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:17,380
Yeah.

1440
01:24:17,484 --> 01:24:20,647
"Why would you want to be normal?"

1441
01:24:23,757 --> 01:24:27,488
I don't. I don't.

1442
01:24:29,229 --> 01:24:31,129
These will keep you warm.

1443
01:24:32,699 --> 01:24:34,599
Yeah.

1444
01:24:34,701 --> 01:24:40,435
"Maybe someone will figure out how to save us. "

1445
01:24:44,578 --> 01:24:47,274
Maybe. Maybe.

1446
01:24:52,786 --> 01:24:54,686
Say that again.

1447
01:24:56,223 --> 01:24:58,123
"Maybe someone" -

1448
01:25:02,763 --> 01:25:06,426
"Maybe. " "Maybe. "

1449
01:25:10,771 --> 01:25:14,764
Little deaf girl,
it's time for us to go home.

1450
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:18,778
Why aren't they doing anything?

1451
01:25:20,981 --> 01:25:23,609
How much- How much do you weigh?

1452
01:25:26,386 --> 01:25:29,549
Fifty pounds, give or take? Okay.

1453
01:25:30,557 --> 01:25:32,616
See.

1454
01:25:34,561 --> 01:25:37,052
Okay, just get it right down here.

1455
01:25:37,164 --> 01:25:39,132
Just get all over the joints.

1456
01:25:39,233 --> 01:25:41,133
When I got kicked out of Girl Scouts...

1457
01:25:41,235 --> 01:25:43,430
and all the other girls were
learning how to sell cookies...

1458
01:25:43,537 --> 01:25:47,837
I was at home- ow- reading physics books.

1459
01:25:47,941 --> 01:25:50,842
Voilà.

1460
01:25:50,944 --> 01:25:54,038
<i>Hartman.
What are you doing? I told you two minutes.</i>

1461
01:25:54,148 --> 01:25:56,480
It's my fault Mary's in the hole.

1462
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:58,312
But like Patton said...

1463
01:25:58,418 --> 01:26:01,649
"A bad plan violently executed today...

1464
01:26:01,755 --> 01:26:04,223
is better than a great plan tomorrow. "

1465
01:26:09,296 --> 01:26:11,526
So, I'm gonna pull the lever,
push the cart...

1466
01:26:11,632 --> 01:26:13,998
and up we go, okay?

1467
01:26:16,537 --> 01:26:19,335
I'm coming, Mary Horowitz! I'm coming!

1468
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:22,602
I'm coming to save you!

1469
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:25,269
What the-

1470
01:26:26,446 --> 01:26:28,471
One, two-

1471
01:26:35,556 --> 01:26:39,287
Oh! Okay! Pretty good drop.

1472
01:26:39,393 --> 01:26:41,361
You guys doing all right?

1473
01:26:41,461 --> 01:26:45,295
Mm-hmm. But we were just on-on, you know-

1474
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:47,890
Something just touched me! Something bit me!

1475
01:26:48,001 --> 01:26:51,960
Something- Help!

1476
01:26:52,072 --> 01:26:54,097
There's something in that water.

1477
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:57,609
Something ni-nibbled at my leg.

1478
01:26:57,711 --> 01:27:02,045
Hartman Hughes just jumped-
I repeat, jumped into the mine.

1479
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:04,777
<i>Grabbing on to a hose
that was attached to nothing...</i>

1480
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:07,752
he literally dove right into the mine.

1481
01:27:07,854 --> 01:27:10,220
All eyes now not only on Mary Horowitz...

1482
01:27:10,324 --> 01:27:13,657
but also CCN reporter Hartman Hughes.

1483
01:27:15,195 --> 01:27:17,595
Why the hell didn't I think of that?

1484
01:27:17,698 --> 01:27:21,964
Did you check the perimeter for spiders?

1485
01:27:22,069 --> 01:27:23,969
Uh, yes. Yes, I did.

1486
01:27:25,272 --> 01:27:28,799
It's really... scary down here.

1487
01:27:32,512 --> 01:27:35,538
You know, if my old man could see me now.

1488
01:27:39,086 --> 01:27:41,919
I'm sorry.

1489
01:27:42,022 --> 01:27:45,185
I mean, I got you into this.

1490
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:47,487
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1491
01:27:47,594 --> 01:27:49,494
Thanks.

1492
01:27:54,635 --> 01:27:58,571
Um, how much do you weigh?

1493
01:27:59,706 --> 01:28:03,039
<i>And as this pulls back and pulls us upwards...</i>

1494
01:28:03,143 --> 01:28:07,477
I'll be cradling her here,
and I'll be cradling you here.

1495
01:28:07,581 --> 01:28:12,951
Maybe you-you would like
to be holding us like this when we go up.

1496
01:28:13,053 --> 01:28:16,784
No, no. It's your plan,
and I don't wanna take the credit.

1497
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:23,120
- I'd like to take the credit.
- Okay. All right.

1498
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:27,098
- I don't know.
He said something about Patton and a bad plan.

1499
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,361
<i>Did you see the cable just move?
- Please do notjump into the mine!</i>

1500
01:28:29,469 --> 01:28:31,164
Get the camera right now.

1501
01:28:31,271 --> 01:28:32,966
We- Steve!

1502
01:28:33,073 --> 01:28:35,041
<i>You! Sir!</i>

1503
01:28:35,142 --> 01:28:37,440
That cable's moving. Looks like they're coming
up. Is there anything I can do to help out?

1504
01:28:37,544 --> 01:28:40,513
- We're doing everything we can.
- I know, but can it take all that weight?

1505
01:28:43,016 --> 01:28:44,847
<i>- Foot in the stirrup?
- Yes.</i>

1506
01:28:44,951 --> 01:28:46,009
- Okay.
- All set.

1507
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:47,882
- All right.
- Okay.

1508
01:28:50,157 --> 01:28:52,250
- You ready?
- Are you ready?

1509
01:28:52,359 --> 01:28:55,089
- Yeah. I just hope this works.
- Yeah, you and me.

1510
01:28:55,195 --> 01:28:57,459
- Hold on.
- What's up?

1511
01:28:57,564 --> 01:29:00,795
Oh. Thank you. Appreciate that.

1512
01:29:00,901 --> 01:29:03,028
