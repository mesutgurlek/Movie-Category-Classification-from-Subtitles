Did you see the way
he went sailing right out there?

11
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,999
- He just went sailing out there.
- It was terrible. Just terrible.

12
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,238
- He must've been doin' over 80.
- An ambulance. We oughta call one.

13
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,156
- Oh, look at that car!
- He must've gone by you doin' 90mph.

I wasn't doing... He was passing me!

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,034
- I never saw such a crazy guy in my life!
- Let's get down there!

16
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,636
- We're goin' down there.
- Russell, remember your condition.

17
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,671
Achhh!

18
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,872
Boy, the way he just sailed out there!

19
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,235
Look out, look out, look out, look out.

20

- There's nobody in the car!
- Huh?

21
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,836
- What do you mean?
- There he is!

22
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,036
Holy smoke!

23
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,356
- How about that? This guy is still alive.
- Is he hurt?

24
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,357
Maybe we oughta call an ambulance.

25
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,155
I don't know how he survived,
the way he went sailing right out there.

26
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,353
Look, I'm not a doctor, but I have
some medical experience. I'm a dentist.

27
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,835
Do you think you're hurt... real bad?

28
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,672
Is he kiddin'?

29

You move me, I'll break up in little pieces.

But what a deal!

32
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,035
Look, there's this dough, see?

33
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,994
There's all this dough! 350 Gs!

34

Do you hear what I'm sayin'?

35
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,760
350 Gs!

36
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,798
In the park, in Rosita.
Rosita Beach State Park.

37
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,878
Just south of Dago in Santa Rosita.

38
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,840

...a big W!

45
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,913
And it's been there...
it's been layin' there for 15 years!

46
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,430
- We oughta get him outta here.
- He's very sick. He may die.

47
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,233
Listen. I tell ya I'm givin' it to ya.

48
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,999
And don't let 'em kid ya.
Don't let 'em kid ya.

49
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,796
Don't let 'em give you the business, see?
Because it was mine, and I paid for it.

50
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,071
Paid for every lousy buck of it! Ya hear?

51
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,998
But watch out. Watch out for the bulls.

52
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,079
Lousy, stinkin' bulls are everywhere.

53
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,270
Bulls all over the place.

54
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,470
You just drive down and dig it up.

55
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,878
Dig it all up! <i>(coughs)</i>

56
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,514
And then... And then you fix yourselves
all up. Fix yourselves all up.

57
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,519
Walk down the street like a king,
back to the old neighbourhood.

58
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,234
See the fellas, the dames...

59
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,319
The dames, all with a big hello...

60
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,878
...a big hello for old Smiler.

61
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,476
"Good old Smiler."

62
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,397
"Everybody's friend."

63
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,670
Everybody's...

64
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,348
- Aunt Belle, I didn't mean to do it!
- Holy mackerel! Take it easy, mister.

65
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,314
Please! Please say it don't make
any difference, Aunt Belle!

66
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,749
Please! You gotta say it!

67
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,316
You gotta tell me
it don't make any difference!

68
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,957
For heaven's sake, tell him!

69
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,150
It... It don't make any difference.

70
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,039
That guy is dead. You better believe it.

71
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,358
Oh, I believe it. But if he jumps up again
like he did before, I'm gettin' outta here.

72
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,678
- Boy, what a routine he went through.
- Somebody oughta cover him up.

73
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,589
Don't look at me, pal.
All I got is this sweater.

74
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,790
Never mind. I got a blanket in the truck.

75
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,710
- D'you think it was true, what he told us?
- No, he was just ravin', man. He flipped.

76
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,392
Hey, this must be the police. You think we
oughta tell 'em what he was talkin' about?

77
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,592
No. They'll ask us questions.
We'll be here all day.

78
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,271
- We gotta be in Vegas this afternoon.
- I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma.

79
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,073
My wife and I are
on a second honeymoon and...

80
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,988
My wife is up there with her mother,
and we're on our way to Lake Mead.

81
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,112
What's all the arguing about?
We'll just clam up...

82
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,595
...and this way, we get outta here.

83
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,319
Uh, are you a police officer? I...

84
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,836
Yeah!

85
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,631
- How long ago did this happen?
- About five minutes ago, Officer.

86
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,276
Did any of you actually see it happen?

87
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,359
- Well, uh, he passed me on a curve and...
- Did anybody actually see it?

88
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,553
Well, he was passing me when he sailed
right out there. Right up there.

89
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,468
- Who was the first down to him?
- Well, we all... <i>(all talk together)</i>

90
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,318
Was he dead?

91
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,396
Was he already dead?

92
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,312
I said, was he already dead
when you got down here?

93
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,111
Practically.

94
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,629
He was still alive? Did he say anything?

95
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,991
Did he say anything before he died?

96
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,237
- What about?
- What do you mean, what about?!

97
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,432
Did he say anything
or didn't he say anything?

98
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,038
Well...

99
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,550
- He...
- He was raving, Officer.

100
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,514
- What about, raving?
- He said... What he said was sort of...

101
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,710
- It was sort of...
- Embarrassing.

102
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,796
What was? Come on, come on.

103
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,480
He thought that this fella was his aunt.

104
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,591
- His aunt?
- Yeah, his Aunt Belle.

105
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,836
He must've had an aunt named Aunt Belle.

106
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,036
All right!

107
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,357
Did he make any kind of statement?
Any last messages?

108
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,268
- He didn't make that clear, at all.
- No, he didn't make anything clear.

109
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,551
- Look, Officer, can we get going?
- Just a minute, just a minute.

110
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,989
I'd better get your details, just in case.

111
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,190
My wife and I don't know
where we'll be...

112
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,232
I don't know if we can stick around.
We're doin' Las Vegas.

113
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,113
We don't know how long
we're gonna stay or...

114
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,834
I got this van of furniture.
I gotta get to Yuma...

115
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,350
Be reasonable, Officer. We stopped
to help the guy. We was too late.

116
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,836
- So let us get outta here, OK?
- We've got our own lives to live.

117
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,236
- Like, we ain't had breakfast yet.
- All right, take it easy.

118
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,715
I'm gonna have to get <i>your</i> name anyway.

119
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,636
Hold it.

120
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,597
Me?

121
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,076
- Why?
- In case the coroner wants a statement.

122
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,596
J Russell Finch,
2790 Penrose Boulevard, Fresno.

123
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,713
I won't be home for a couple of weeks,
but you can get me through my office.

124
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,879
- Where is your office?
- The Pacific Edible Seaweed Company.

125
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,753
It's in Fresno. You can
call me through my secretary.

126
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,155
- The ambulance is on its way.
- On its way.

127
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,236
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

128
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,635
We'd better shift those cars
from the curve.

129
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,709
I guess that's all we can get from this
group. Thank you, gentlemen, very much.

130
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,157
Well...

131
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,669
There's an unexpected twist for you.

132
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,758
They're not gonna like this
down at Santa Rosita.

133
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,996
- Culpeper's gonna scream.
- Yeah.

134
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,192
- Say, we'd better get our story straight.
- What story?

135
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,438
He woke up as usual. He started driving.
He stopped at a place for breakfast.

136
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,994
He went to the gents.
He climbed out the window.

137
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,829
So what? Not even Culpeper will say
we should've been in there with him.

138
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,953
The thing that got me was the way
he went sailing right out there.

139
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,152
If I have to climb much more,
I'll be layin' down there with him.

140
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,236
Poor soul.

141
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,716
<i>(all)</i> Well...

142
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,274
Melville, what happened?

143
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,631
We couldn't do anything.
Just nothing we could do. Come on.

144
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,716
<i>(older woman)</i> Well?

145
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,634
- It was a terrible thing.
- Oh, Russell, I feel sick.

146
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,878
- Easy, honey. These things happen.
- What kind of an attitude is that?

147
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,278
The whole country is full of people
who, when these things happen...

148
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,119
...say "These things happen."
That's why they happen!

149
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,949
- Let's try not to get upset.
- Come on, Russell.

150
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,230
We gotta have control
of what happens to us!

151
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,079
If we left it up to you,
we'd never hear the last of it!

152
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,398
- <i>(woman contínues to rant)</i>
- <i>(Russell)</i> You're right, you're right.

153
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,352
And do you know what all those halfwit
morons up in Sacramento do about it?

154
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,870
They just sit there,
with their big feet up on their big desks...

155
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,639
...and milk 15 million people
of as much graft as...

156
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,878
Listen. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I've gotta say something.

157
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,912
- What's the matter, Melville?
- I'm watching something.

158
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,794
Hey, Benjy, turn around.
Sit still. Play it straight.

159
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,672
They can't kid me. They all went for it.

160
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,916
Yeah? So what are you
gonna do now, huh?

161
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,591
I want you to tell me everything
that man told you, word for word!

162
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,836
But do you think he really meant it?

163
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,235
Monica, I don't know about anybody else
but some of 'em believed it...

164
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,713
...like those two back there.

165
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,592
Don't look over there!

166
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,951
I know where it is. It's under a big W,
he said. Under a big W.

167
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,355
Like a windmill or
a waterfall or something.

168
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,119
Ooh, I hope it's not under a waterfall.

169
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,595
Please, think of something
that starts with a W.

170
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,994
Wealth.

171
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,076
Which.

172
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,831
Where. Work! That's it: Work.
I gotta work on where it is.

173
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,078
Dr Carroll said Russell
was to have no undue excitement...

174
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,395
...for two weeks because of his condition.

175
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,432
That's why we came on this trip -
so Russell could just relax.

176
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,109
- He should have told the police.
- What's the police got to do with it?

177
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,190
- Mother, they were chasing the man.
- Why shouldn't they? He was speeding!

178
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,869
- I'm only thinking of Russell's condition.
- His financial condition.

179
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,554
Because that's the only
condition that he has.

180
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,309
Emmeline, do you know exactly why
your husband had a nervous breakdown?

181
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,831
It's because he has sunk $40,000 -
including $15,000 of <i>my</i> money -

182
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,191
...into a company that makes
seaweed for people to eat!

183
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,312
And not only does nobody like it,
but it costs over $4 a can!

184
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,431
- Yeah, but...
- Yeah, but what?

185
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,792
Most people like it, and I like it, and
I'm workin' hard to keep the cost down.

186
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,278
Yeah, like the day that you ran out of your
office and stood in the street screaming!

187
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,879
- Mother!
- Emmeline, shut up!

188
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,592
- But, Mother...
- And you too!

189
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,235
Maybe he was playing
some kind of a trick on everybody.

190
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,990
- He might have been a practical joker.
- Oh, Monica... Practical...

191
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,635
What kind of a man would play
a practical joke on complete strangers...

192
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,320
...with every bone in his body broken?

193
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,352
- Watch! Watchtower!
- No.

194
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,358
- Wall. Walnut tree!
- No, no!

195
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,515
- Walnuts!
- No!

196
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,392
- In bags.
- No!

197
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,431
Why are we doing only 35?
Step on it and see what happens!

198
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,790
- Mother.
- They'll all see what we're doing.

199
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,277
- Go ahead. What have you got to lose?
- Mother, he's not that good a driver.

200
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,589
Aha.

201
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,630
Aha!

202
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,836
Gonna leave the big boy behind, huh?

203
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,716
<i>(tyres screech)</i>

204
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,110
What are you doing?
Why are we slowing down?

205
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,629
It's no use. We can't lose 'em this way.

206
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,990
Oh, the inside of my stomach!

207
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,795
What's that idiot in the truck tryin' to do?

208
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,911
What is he doin' back there?

209
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,796
I bet he's runnin' out of gas. Good!

210
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,958
- What happened to you?
- Havin' trouble with your engine?

211
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,992
- What'd you do, run out of gas?
- Did ya bend your tailpipe?

212
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,032
Oh, no. It was just one of my tyres.

213
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,549
I thought... Aw, shucks.

214
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,433
OK, so I was tryin' to... Oh, rats.

215
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,074
Look, I think we're making
a very big mistake.

216
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,236
- I absolutely agree.
- So?

217
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,750
- It's silly, running around like this.
- We're gettin' nowhere.

218
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,869
He's right.

219
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,471
So why don't we just discuss this thing
and reason something out calmly...

220
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,828
- I'm with you.
- Fine.

221
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,190
...and we can come to some conclusion.

222
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,151
- Yeah, let's do that.
- <i>(car horn)</i>

223
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,751
Yeah. That way nobody'll have
an advantage on one another. It's fair.

224
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,839
- We better get the cars off that curve.
- Yeah. Let's talk over there.

225
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,076
- OK.
- Fine. See you over there.

226
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,156
Over there. Over there.

227
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,396
You're through to Homicide.

228
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,396
Santa Rosita Police Station.

229
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,518
Detective Division?
I'm connecting you now.

230
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,437
Santa Rosita Police Station.

231
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,516
Detective Division. Matthews.

232
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,435
No, Sheriff, the chief isn't here.
He's a little late this morning.

233
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,075
- So I'll stay late after school. Who is it?
- Sheriff, Crockett County.

234
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,795
Oh? That's where the Smiler is.
I wonder if anything happened.

235
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,593
Gertie, will you put that call through here?

236
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,995
How about a little coffee, Schwartz?

237
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,436
Hello, Sheriff? Culpeper.

238
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,553
- Did he make a break? What happened?
- Afraid we got some bad news for you.

239
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,513
- Grogan's cashed in his chips.
- He what?!

240
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,154
<i>Crashed hís car about 20 mínutes ago.</i>

241
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,836
<i>He was makín' a break, all ríght.</i>

242
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,555
Well, how did it happen?
<i>Where</i> did it happen?

243
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,431
On 39, about 18 miles
east of Danby Junction...

244
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,074
<i>... and 9 míles west of Valley Center.</i>

245
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,758
Were there any witnesses?

246
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,269
<i>A few people went down</i>
<i>to see íf they could help.</i>

247
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,437
- Was he killed outright?
- I don't know, but I can find out.

248
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,312
<i>Yeah, do that. See what they saíd.</i>

249
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,396
Thanks very much, Sheriff.

250
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,957
Well, a great way to start the day.

251
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,637
You wait for 15 years to solve a really
important case, and just when you get...

252
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,108
It's all right, Chief. I'll get it for you.

253
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,436
He did it again.

254
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,278
<i>(heehaws)</i>

255
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,516

256
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,234

257
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,316
<i>(síren)</i>

258
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,472

<i>van. Item: One red Volkswagen...</i>

259
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,556
- It's them.
- Call it in.

260
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,876
2-1-6-2, 2-1-5-8. Say, we just made all four
of 'em parked along the side of the road.

261
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,389
They're just standing there talking. Over.

262
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
<i>(Sheríff) Sammy, let that ambulance go.</i>
<i>And stay by the radío.</i>

263
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,190
The man said there was a certain
amount of money buried in this park.

264
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,151
That's right. It was under a big W.

265
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,556
- Say, what is a big W?
- If we find out, we'll send you a wire.

266
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,113
<i>(Benjy guffaws)</i>

267
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,550
It's only a possibility
that this man was telling the truth.

268
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,800
And if it was the truth, then it is a fact
that this place is almost 200 miles away.

269
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,229
I suggest that we quietly
get into our cars...

270
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,069
...and drive down there
at a safe, sound speed...

271
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,760
...keeping each other
in sight of each other.

272
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,350
And when we get there, we dig up
the money - if there is some money there -

273
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,711
...and if we do find it, we share it
amongst us in a simple manner.

274
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,230
- He's got a point.
- I think we should go to the police.

275
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,510
- Why the police?
- It's OK. She's with us.

276
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,313
Now what's with this
fair shares for everybody?

277
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,356
Look, ma'am. We arrived in four vehicles.
We should split it up in four quarters.

278
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,789
Quarters? What are you talkin' about?

279
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,390
You three each get a quarter,
and Benjy and I have to split a quarter?

280
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,710
- That's right.
- What are you tryin' to pull?

281
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,718
- It seems fair to <i>me.</i>
- Naturally it'd seem fair to <i>you.</i>

282
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,470
- It just cheats <i>us,</i> that's all!
- $350,000 divided by four is...

283
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,518
- It's... 87,500 bucks.
- Sure, that's what it is.

284
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,076
So you three would get 87,500 bucks
and Benjy and I have to split it.

285
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,237
Five of us were at the wreck.
We should split it five ways.

286
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,718
- He's right. We should split it five ways.
- I'm perfectly willing to discuss five ways.

287
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,116
Five shares, each share
would be 70,000...

288
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,038
70,000 bucks?! Holy mackerel!

289
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,039
Do you realise how many loads I'd have
to haul from Modesto to Yuma to get that?

290
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,674
- You're overlooking one little thing.
- Yeah.

291
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,711
- What little thing?
- Yeah. What?

292
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,229
Can't you count?
There were eight of us there!

293
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,194
- Yeah. There were eight of us there.
- My wife and I would be happy with...

294
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,790
You'd be happy with two eighths
instead of a quarter? How big of you.

295
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,753
Hold it. Let's just put it back
the way it was before.

296
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,078
Either one quarter for each car,
includin' the van, or one fifth for each guy.

297
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,794
- One quarter or one fifth.
- Just because this old bag...

298
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,876
How dare you?!

299
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,872
Chief, we got a situation here
that is absolutely incredible.

300
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,037
- Now, Smiler Grogan... Remember him?
- Oh, yes.

301
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,754
Smiler Grogan spent the night here. See?

302
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,316
He made his break this morning,
he drove up this way...

303
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,318
...got to here, where
he crashed and killed himself.

304
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,716
But before he died,
some people stopped to help him.

305
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,912
And they are now stopped here, talking.

306
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,600
I think they're arguing about something.

307
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,392
And a Crockett County unit
has got 'em under observation.

308
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,432
Now, we give shares
to everybody and for everything.

309
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,870
Now, there are eight of us.
That's eight shares for that.

310
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,391
Then there were four vehicles. Four
shares for that. That's 12 shares already.

311
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,229
Then five of us went down to the wreck.
We give five shares for that.

312
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,112
So that makes it 17. Right?

313
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,472
Now we add the same number of shares
as there were people in each vehicle.

314
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,149
That's three for your group, two
for yours, two for us and one for you.

315
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,510
That adds up to 25 shares.

316
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,839
Now, 25 into 350,000 is...
$14,000 per share.

317
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,078
Now, that would mean you would get
three shares for being three people...

318
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,431
...one share for the car,
one share for looking at the wreck...

319
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,199
...and three shares
for being three people in the car...

320
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,950
...which would give you a total of
eight shares, giving you $112,000.

321
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,470
And that covers everything -
including the emancipation of women!

322
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,556
Wait a minute. As I understand it...

323
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,832
...I got one share for bein' one person,
one share for goin' down the hill...

324
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,919
...one share for the truck, and
one share for bein' a person in the truck.

325
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:10,319
But no matter how you figure it out,
I still don't get as much as anybody else.

326
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,556
Look, let me explain it once more.

327
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,470
Their group, those three of them,
they get 112,000. Right?

328
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,831
Those over there, them, they get 97,000.

329
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,520
We, us, we get 84,000.

330
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,475
And you, by yourself,
you get $56,000... alone.

331
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,637
- And that's tax-free money.
- What do you mean, tax-free?

332
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,958
I mean, if we go down to this park
and we uncover the money and we...

333
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,471
I'm sure <i>he's</i> not gonna declare anything.
I know <i>he's</i> not gonna declare anything.

334
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,397
And <i>I'm</i> not gonna declare...

335
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,909
What are you talkin' about, declare it?

336
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,511
I mean, it's like nontaxable income.
It's like a... like a gift.

337
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,110
But sure, if we find the money,
we still have to report the taxes.

338
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,674
Otherwise it's stealing
from the government!

339
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,792
Oh, brother. Look, can you
explain it to him, please?

340
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,151
Who, me? Well...
see, if we find the money...

341
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,750
...there may be no taxes to pay on it,
just because we did find the money.

342
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,589
- But what he was trying to say is...
- Listen, everybody has to pay taxes.

343
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,838
Even businessmen that rob and steal
and cheat from people every day.

344
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,916
Even <i>they</i> have to pay taxes.

345
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,953
I give up. Anybody got
a fairer plan, go ahead.

346
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,073
There were eight of us there,
so that simply means eight shares.

347
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,919
- Three for us, two for you...
- Aw, this is hopeless!

348
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,952
We're gonna get noplace
listening to this old bag.

349
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,675
Lady, are you tryin' to split us up
so it becomes every man for himself?

350
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,156
- And every woman for himself?
- One more remark from you, buster...

351
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,589
- Let's get outta here.
- Please don't argue.

352
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,397
Look! We figured it 17 different ways.
And every time, it was no good.

353
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,195
Because, no matter how we figured it,
somebody didn't like how we did it.

354
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,108
So now there's only one way
to figure it, and that is...

355
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,074
...every man - including
the old bag - for himself!

356
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,270
So good luck, and may the best man win!

357
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,837
Right! Except you, lady.
May you just... drop dead!

358
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,155
All right. We all agree on that.

359
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,589
Now let's be sensible about this thing.

360
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,109
There's money in this for all of us. Right?

361
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,949
There's enough for you,
there's enough for you...

362
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,438
...and for me, and for you,
and there's enough for...

363
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,634
Ooh, Melville, my shoe!

364
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,716
Get in the car!

365
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,031
2-1-5-8, 2-1-6-2. Four cars under
observation now passing this checkpoint.

366
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,152
Lead car is the Plymouth station wagon.
Next, the Ford van...

367
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,716
<i>... the VWand the Chrysler lmperíal</i>
<i>convertíble, all doíng about 50.</i>

368
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,435
- Yep. They're on their way.
- <i>(Culpeper) Goíng ín the same dírectíon?</i>

369
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,190
That's right. And, according to my boys,
they're all on reckless drivin' charges.

370
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,757
None of those people must suspect for a
minute that anybody is interested in them.

371
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,829
<i>Sheríff, wíll you call Captaín Hardesty and</i>
<i>see how many helícopters we can have?</i>

372
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,032
Well, I'll see what we can do
and I'll call you back.

373
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,149
Now, where have I always told you
that the Smiler hid the dough?

374
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,236
- I know, I know.
- Where?

375
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,998
Right there.

376
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,758
That's right, yeah.

377
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,553
So, if these merrymakers
decide to go for it...

378
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,036
...they'll go to the crossroads
and turn south.

379
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,913
But why did Smiler head east
when he made his break...

380
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,352
...if the money is down here somewhere?
- Oh... Aloysius!

381
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,552
The guy was just bein' clever.

382
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,719
Five'll get you ten: They go
to the crossroads and turn south.

383
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,432
You got yourself a bet.

384
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,515
Mount Shasta National Forest.
Are we near...

385
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,359
That's on the top.
Look down near the bottom.

386
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,876
- Are we near Oregon?
- That's 700 miles from here!

387
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,552
Don't pass him, Ding!

388
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,120
Ding, you're gonna lose your licence.

389
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,798
We're the ones with the Imperial
and we're running last?

390
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,797
I can't pass 'em on the curves.

391
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,878
Oh, go on. Go ahead.
Look, there's a space.

392
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,560
What are you waitin' for -
an engraved invitation?

393
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,910
<i>(Fínch)</i> Get over! Get over!

394
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,315
<i>(tyres screech)</i>

395
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,516
<i>(car horn)</i>

396
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,795
I said it before and I'll say it again:

397
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,559
I didn't wanna move to California.

398
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,955
- Did you find it yet?
- I can't find it anywhere.

399
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,992
Look, you take the wheel.
Give me the map.

400
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,195
It must be here. Right over here! Valley
Center! There's an airfield marked...

401
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,673
Melville!

402
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,718
- Pull it off!
- Get it off me!

403
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,628
<i>(Benjy)</i> Don't go in there!
Swing over! Watch out!

404
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,316
- Take it off!
- Get it off!

405
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,396
I've had enough!

406
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,749
- They'll hire planes.
- Never mind. Let's go.

407
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,156
- But they'll be there hours before...
- I said never mind! Let's go!

408
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,077
Nobody's gettin' <i>me</i> up in the air.

409
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,910
<i>(crash, bang, shatter)</i>

410
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,600
I wanted to give 'em reasonable shares.
No. They wanted every man for himself.

411
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,518
Now I'll show 'em what kind of a man
they're dealing with.

412
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,076
<i>(bang)</i>

413
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,397
It's stalled, Benjy.
We got dust in the carburettor.

414
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,953
<i>(engíne faíls)</i>

415
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,956
Boy! When the people who own this stuff
see this, I sure hate to think what...

416
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,036
Never mind, never mind.

417
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,948
Here's the bike. Get to a phone
and hire the best car that you can find.

418
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,514
But... this is a girl's bike!

419
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,551
This is for a little girl!

420
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,319
I've got to put all this stuff back
and lock up the van.

421
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,830
We'll put everything away.
Will you please hurry?

422
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,712
OK.

423
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,116
I gotta admit...

424
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,796
...I feel kinda silly.

425
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,876
You know what I mean?

426
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,316
Well, will you take us or won't you?

427
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,955
- For $250, I guess I will.
- Good. Then you take care of the plane.

428
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,516
We'll leave our car here and get it
tomorrow. I'll give you a cheque.

429
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,315
- Cheque?
- A traveller's cheque. Bank of America.

430
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,635
- Oh, boy.
- Hey!

431
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,355
- Are you a pilot? Is there a plane around?
- Right both times.

432
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,156
- Where's an airplane? I don't see any.
- There's only one, and we've chartered it.

433
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,669
- You made a deal with them?
- Right.

434
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,360
Is there anywhere
we can charter another plane?

435
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,153
- The nearest place is in North Valley.
- Where's that?

436
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,552
On the other side of Valley Center,
about 12 miles, 15 miles. Excuse us.

437
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,875
Filibuster! Filibuster!

438
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,956
Stick around and watch us take off.

439
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,389
Listen, dentist. I hate dentists.

440
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,274
I hate you so much that I'm not able
to tell you how much in front of your wife.

00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,752
Had an accident?

445
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,474
- Anyone hurt?
- No, but we've got to get to a phone.

00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,716
- Can you give us a lift?
- A lift?

447
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,638
Of course! I should be
absolutely delighted!

448
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,392
Oh, upsy-daisy. I'm afraid
you caught me on the hop there.

00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,717
- Madam, do be careful of the cactus...
- Oh!

I say, I'm most frightfully sorry.

451
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,709
You see, I've been gathering
some samples of desert flora.

- Where shall I put this?
- <i>(sníggers)</i> Oh, boy.

00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,828
It certainly is. Look,

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,598
Of course. With pleasure.

456
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,030
I say, jolly nasty accident there.
Jolly lucky nobody was hurt.

457
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,391
Where did you get that funny accent?
Are you from Harvard?

458
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,114
Harvard? Oh, rather not. I'm English.

459
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,913
- Sounds so foreign.
- Really?

460
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,352
Oh, we haven't introduced ourselves.
I'm Algernon Hawthorne. Colonel.

461
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,631
- You're a colonel?
- Well, lieutenant colonel, actually.

462
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,390
My name is Finch. This is my wife and
this is my mother-in-law, Mrs Marcus.

463
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,034
Oh, do stuff those things
in the back, will you?

464
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,230
Cactus is rather a hobby of mine.

465
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,318
Spent the last ten days
gathering some for my collection.

466
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,510
Nothing spectacular, actually.

467

<i>Cereus, Echínocactus, Opuntía,</i>
and that sort of thing.

468
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,355
Been enjoying a spot of leave
from Vandenberg.

469
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,393
- From what?
- Vandenberg. The missile place.

470
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,637
Been attached there for the last
ten months. Liaison work.

471
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,149
All very hush-hush and whoosh-whoosh.

472
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,636
That sort of thing, you know.

473
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,636
Please, will you look at the road?

474
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,076
Yes. Whoosh-whoosh.

475
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,432
- Don't stop! Keep moving!
- Mother!

- Shouldn't we stop...

Keep moving!

Can't we just go on with our second
honeymoon and forget all about this?

481
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,871
Honey, please. Darling,
believe me, everything is all right.

482
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,116
You think I'd take a chance with you?

483
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,711
If there was any danger in flying in this...
This is a plane that's really built...

484
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,796
Look, when was this plane built?

485
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,878
- 1916.
- 1916.

486
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,913
1916. I mean, these planes
are tried and true.

487
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,713
There's nothing experimental
about these planes.

488
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,990
So come on! Let's have
one big adventure!

489
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,317
Come on! Get up there and
have some fun! Come on, here we go.

Oh, all right. Thanks.

Are you sure you can't rent us
that truck out there? I'll pay.

494
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,877
I told you, mister. We can't.
This is our first week open.

495
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,390
How could we do without our truck?
We're in business.

496

If we tell the Englishman about...

497
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,398
How can you admit
we're involved in anything so hideous?

498
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,479

- He would be if he drove us there.

499
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,831
And if we don't tell him all about it,
he won't drive us there.

500
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,996
Oh, you're such a genius.

Listen! Only ten per cent! There's no
reason why he should expect any more!

Thanks for stoppin'.
Listen, can you give me a lift?

503
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,711
What's with the little kiddy bicycle?
Are you some kind of a nut?

504
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,150
No. I had an accident.
Look, I gotta get to Santa Rosita fast.

- Wait a minute. Let me just think.

506
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,116
I gotta tell somebody. Look,
can you spare a couple of hours?

Couple of hours? You've been out in the

ain't gonna believe it coulda happened.

But there was an accident
a little while back, about 20 miles back.

It involved $350,000.

If the spare is flat, don't fix it.
Gimme a new tyre.

Ain't got a new tyre? Then fix the spare.
But don't look at me. Move it.

I'm proud of you, kid.

Hey, how many people has he killed?

592
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,953
Don't be morbid. Just tie him up until
the boys in the white jackets get here.

- This is a club. We don't do charter work.

Hey, whose plane is that over there?

596

It belongs to Tyler Fitzgerald.
But he's not going anywhere today.

597
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,272
- Is he here?
- Mr Fitzgerald's in the billiard room.

598
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,436
He's... asleep. Nobody can talk to him.

599

- Can we just ask him a question?
- <i>(phone ríngs)</i>

Wake up, please, Mr Fitzgerald.

You know Rosita Beach?
You're the only one who can get us there.

- Yes, a matter of life and death!

615
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,074
- Our grandmother is dying.
- Who's dying?

616
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,998
Our grandmother is dying
and she sent for us.

617

Yeah. She's in Rosita Beach, see?
She's dying, and we're up here...

...and she'd kinda like to have us
be with her when she goes.

Otherwise, she won't go.

- Oh, she'll go, but...
- Sorry, sir. They forced their way in.

621
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,950
No, we didn't. Let me introduce myself.
I'm Dingy Bell. This is Benjy Benjamin.

- Oh, stop with that already!

Look, sir. We'd like for you
to help us out by taking us down...

- Wait a minute. Just a minute!

- Yes, I... I can't see.
- What?

626
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,437
Something's happened to my eyes.
I... I... I can't see.

627
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,199
- You can't see? He can't see.
- Must be an eye cold.

628
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,029
- George... George, I can't see!
- One minute, Mr Fitzgerald.

We wanna make sure
he doesn't get loose.

633
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,154
I'll kill that dirty, rotten bum
when I get my hands on him.

634
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,678
What's the matter?
How come I'm all tied up like this?

635
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,555
- Just sit there. Everything'll be all right.
- Friends will come and take care of you.

636
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,035
What friends? What are you talkin' about?

637
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,835
- Get this stuff off me. Turn me loose.
- Take it easy, pal. You've been sick.

638
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,873
Who's been sick? And where's
that bum with the glasses, huh?

639
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,992
Now just sit still because
the doctor's gone to get help.

640
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,669
What doctor? I don't know no doctor.
Are you guys crazy?

What's all this got to do with you,
if you don't mind tellin' me?!

729
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,509
Well, if you have quite decided
to withdraw from this affair...

730
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,838
...I might reasonably expect you to return
my keys so that at least <i>I could press on.

731
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,159
You keep outta this! Now, for the last time,
are we gonna call Sylvester or not?

732
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,876
No, we are not! And I'll tell you why not.
Because your son Sylvester...

733
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,039
...is an irresponsible, unreliable,
loudmouth, no-good bum...

734
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,711
...who, if he isn't a crook, it's only because
he hasn't the brains or ambition to be one.

735
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,353
I say, good show!

736
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,870
Now, if you wanna come with us,
come with us. But you don't have to.

737
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,195
But you've got to give us those keys...

738
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,437
...or you'll force us to take 'em from you!
- Hear, hear!

739
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,753
Give us those keys. I don't care where
you have them, I'm gonna get 'em.

740
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,871
- How dare you?
- Give us those keys.

741
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,390
- Give us the keys.
- You take one more step towards me...

742
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,308
- I'm warning you, you're gonna be sorry.
- I've waited for this for years.

743
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,635
You're gonna get it, but good!

744
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,678
- Emmeline!
- Emmeline, stay in the car!

745
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,228
Russell! Don't! Mother!

746
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,354
Let me down! You two'll be sorry!

747
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,597
Russell, you wouldn't!
You couldn't! You shouldn't!

748
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,230
Let me go! Let me get outta here!

749
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,396
I got 'em. I got 'em. Here they are.

750
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,912
I'm sorry we had to do it,
but that was the only way.

751
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,515
Don't hit Hawthorne that way! Ow!

752
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,676
Now, madam, please!

753
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,552
You forced us. You forced us.

754
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,037
I'm sorry, but you forced us. Now do us
a favour. Will you get back in the car?

755
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,469
- Get away! Don't touch me!
- We had to do it.

756
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,556
- You saw it, honey.
- Russell, let me go!

757
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,194
Just wait. You can't
manhandle a decent woman!

758
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,836
You're gonna go to jail for assault!
I'll sue you for everything you've got!

759
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,794
- Take your hands off my daughter!
- If we <i>are</i> going, we must get cracking.

760
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,956
- Russell, how could you?
- We had to do it.

761
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,913
- Mr Finch.
- Please, don't go. We'll be right with you.

762
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,235
You see, we had to do it. She made us.

763
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,316
Let's forget it. Let's be reasonable.

764
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,159
- He's gonna leave. Please get in the car.
- Not me.

765
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,511
We are wasting so much time.
Give me the keys.

766
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,636
<i>(engíne splutters)</i>

767
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,756
<i>(car horn)</i>

768
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,519
The cars are going faster than we are!
Can't you make this go a little faster?

769
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,679
Wide open, I can.
But wide open eats up a lotta gas.

770
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,155
Then open up wide.
I'll pay extra for the gas.

771
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,750
- That'll cost you about $50.
- OK. I'll pay when we land.

772
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,950
- Now.
- I gotta pay now?

773
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,469
- Now.
- All right, I'll pay you now.

774
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,639
- Melville...
- What?

775
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,149
A bug! Get him off! Argh!

776
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,158
- Hey! Take it easy!
- <i>(squeals)</i> Get him! Get him!

777
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,157
Hey! You're breakin' up the airplane!

778
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,714
- Is it down there?
- <i>(stamps foot)</i>

779
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,876
- You're breaking the floor!
- <i>(ríp)</i>

780
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,718
- Argh! Help!
- Melville!

781
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,152
None of these ten people
have any record at all.

782
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,798
Yet we could book 'em for withholding
information, causing accidents...

783
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,390
...reckless driving, theft,
three cases of assault and battery...

784
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,875
- Captain Culpeper?
- Yeah? Got my home?

785
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,399
Yes, sir.

786
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,318
Sheriff, excuse me, will ya? Another call.

787
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,112
Take the sheriff.

788
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,119
- I'll take it in here.
- Transfer it to Captain Culpeper's office.

789
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,597
- Hello. Ginger?
- <i>Daddy? It's Bíllíe Sue.</i>

790
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,190
Oh. Let me speak with your mother,
will you, sweetheart?

791
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,391
<i>(Gínger) Well?</i>

792
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,999
Ah, dear.

793
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,476
Tell me something, Ginger.
How does it feel being married...

794
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,354
...to the most brilliant personality
in the law-enforcement industry?

795
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,835
<i>Are you referríng to yourself?</i>

796
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,794
Ginger, I want you to prepare yourself
for a little shock.

797
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,912
- When I tell you what has happened...
- <i>So tell me! I've got thís bíscuít dough...</i>

798
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,396
The Smiler Grogan case is solved!

799
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,192
<i>The what?!</i>

800
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,279
<i>Now, what the hell</i>
<i>ís the Smíler Grogan case?</i>

801
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,070
The tuna factory robbery.

802
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,670
The case I've been talkin' about
for the last 15 years.

803
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:06,191
Now listen. All I want you to do is
make all the necessary preparations...

804
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,198
...for a little flight to Hawaii,
Sunday morning.

805
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,993
- <i>So what's the gag?</i>
- It is no gag.

806
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,554
<i>Are you seríous about flyíng to Hawaíí?</i>

807
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,796
<i>(chuckles)</i>

808
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,388
Flight 7, Sunday morning.

809
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,988
- <i>Are we takín' Bíllíe Sue?</i>
- No!

810
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,758
It's just the two of us,
for about three weeks.

811
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,916
We're gonna celebrate, Ginger.

812
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:33,717
My feeling is that, after 27 years...
we've earned it.

813
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,836
- What's the matter?
- I need help. Could you give me a lift?

814
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,476
My wife is sick. The doc sent me after
some medicine, and I just ran out of gas.

815
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,556
Yeah! Get in!

816
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,749
<i>(both)</i> You?!

817
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,555
- Wait. We're in trouble.
- Everybody is. Get out of the way, lady.

818
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,639
<i>We</i> didn't want to leave you back there.
It was my son-in-law and the Englishman.

819
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,115
What Englishman?
Will you get out of the way?

820
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,789
Look, you leave us here and you know
what you're gonna get out of all this?

821
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,832
- Nothin'! My daughter and I will get it all!
- Yeah? How?

822
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,758
I'll call my son. He lives
10 miles from Rosita Beach.

823
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,078
He's gonna drive there and get the money,
and we're gonna have it! That's how!

824
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,397
I <i>was</i> gonna offer <i>you</i> a share,
just for takin' us to a phone.

825
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,149
But since you're not interested,
we'll just wait for another car.

826
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,670
We're makin' a mistake.
We better go back for my mother-in-law.

827
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,199
- Go back?!
- Yes.

828
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,276
- You're not serious?
- Don't you see?

829
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,679
She'll phone my brother-in-law. He'll get
there first. The rest of us won't get a dime.

830
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,756
You can believe that.

831
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,717
But look here.
Even if she does get all the money...

832
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,479
...surely it won't affect our agreement.

833
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:15,755
She wouldn't break her word. I'd still be
entitled to ten per cent as agreed, surely.

834
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,988
Surely(!)

835
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,076
Come on. Let's go.

836
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,671
- <i>Operator.</i>
- Santa Rosita 7-1-9-6-5.

837
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,679
And then that dirty, rotten, slimy bum
double-crossed me.

838
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,792
When I get ahold of that smart aleck,
what I'm gonna do to him!

839
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:57,074
If you're there, I just hope that you turn
away, that you just look the other way.

840
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,076
- Well, did you get him?
- Maybe he went out for the papers.

841
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,273
- We can keep on tryin'.
- Just supposin' we never do get him.

842
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,550
We just might be the last ones there.

843
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,636
Just a minute. Just a minute!

844
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,228
Down there? You must be kiddin'!
It's too steep!

845
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,715
I drive my jeep down here
every day. Let's go!

846
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,319
Yeah, let's go, let's go.

847
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,916
You can turn around here. I sure
appreciate this, mister. Thanks.

848
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,996
Yeah, yeah. Swell.

849
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,516
Hi, Eddie.

850
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,838
I gotta get outta here.
Ask your father to come and show me.

851
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,837
There must be a way to get outta here!

852
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,076
Come on! Hurry up!

853
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,589
I could show you a way out.
There's another way around to the road.

854
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:11,872
Another way to the road? You know
another way? Good. Come on in. Show...

855
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,072
Look, show me how to get outta here,
I'll give you a dollar.

856
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,236
- Three dollars!
- Three?! Why, you...

857
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,194
Yeah, all right. I'll give you three dollars.
Come on, hop in the car.

858
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,788
Hurry, will ya, kid? I gotta get outta here!

859
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,916
- They're gone.
- Well, they got a lift.

860
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,759
We only passed a few cars
and they weren't in any of them.

861
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,192
Somebody must've taken them the other
way. Let's go back to where we phoned.

862
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:50,279
That's miles in the wrong direction.
Besides, we can't be sure they'll be there.

863
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,551
I don't know. I must find my wife.
I don't know what to do.

864
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,390
Look, surely the most sensible thing
is for the two of us to press on!

865
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,557
For all we know, your brother-in-law
may be away somewhere.

866
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,434
And even if he were the first there,
he still has to find the money, hasn't he?

867
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:10,111
Now, I earnestly recommend that
we press on with all possible dispatch.

868
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,879
<i>(mímícs)</i> We'll press on
with all possible dispatch.

869
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,630
And I don't really think that personal
rancour is going to help the situation...

01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,870
OK. Come on, hurry up. Let's go.

872
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,673
We're here. We got here first. Let's go.

873
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,394
Come on. I gotcha, I gotcha. I gotcha.

874
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,717
Attaboy, baby.
We made it. We're here first.

875
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,115
Take care of my car until we get back.

876
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,755
Come on, let's go. Come on, baby!

877
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,236
Over there?

878
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,078
There?!

879
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,156
Down there?!

880
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,634
That'll be $2.90.

881
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,558
Here's $3, keep the change,
but wait for us, OK?

882
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,636
Oh, sure!

883
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,636
Come on. Let's go.

884
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,320
- We're closed. It's 12 o'clock.
- They're closed.

885
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:52,672
Wait a minute! All we want
is a pick and a shovel.

886
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,715
- Mr Dinckler's inside.
- Dinckler! That's it. We'll get Dinckler.

887
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,035
Aha!

888
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,118
Downstairs! Come on!
It must be here someplace.

889
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,196
Down here.

890
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:11,236
Look for a pick and a shovel. Right?
A pick and a shovel. Must be someplace.

891
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,920
That's all I need.

892
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,595
A pick and a shovel. I found it!

893
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,072
Got it.

894
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,794
I got it! I found it!

895
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,472
Ohh.

896
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,991
I've no wish to quarrel with you...

897
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,999
...but, as a representative of Her Majesty's
armed forces, I take exception...

898
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:43,672
You want me to tell you somethin'? As far
as I'm concerned, the British are finished.

899
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:49,557
If it hadn't been for lend-lease, giving you
billions you never even thanked us for...

900
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,719
...the whole phony outfit would've sunk
under the Atlantic years ago.

901
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,877
- <i>(brakes sharply)</i>
- Hey. What are you stopping for?

902
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,639
- Get out of this machine.
- Get out? I can't...

903
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,399
It's my machine. I'll do
as I bloody well please! Out!

904
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,398
I'm awfully sorry.
I've been very edgy today.

905
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,478
If I've said anything about England,
I apologise.

906
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,791
Glad to hear you say so.

907
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,879
I must say, if I had the misfortune to be
a citizen of this benighted country...

908
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,879
...I should be most hesitant in offering
any criticism whatever of any other.

909
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,959
Wait a minute. Are you saying
something against America?

910
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,437
Against it? I should be astounded
to hear if anything could be said <i>for</i> it!

911
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:31,758
It's the most unspeakable matriarchy
in the whole history of civilisation!

912
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:37,113
Look at how your wife and her strumpet
of a mother push <i>you</i> through the hoop.

913
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:41,233
American men have been totally
emasculated. They're like slaves.

914
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:46,559
They die from coronaries as their women
sit under hair dryers eating chocolates...

915
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:50,798
...and arranging for every second Tuesday
to be some sort of Mother's Day.

916
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:54,515
And this positively infantile
preoccupation with bosoms!

917
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,474
In all my time in this wretched country,
what has appalled me most...

918
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,160
...is this preposterous
preoccupation with bosoms!

919
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,192
They've become the dominant theme
in American culture.

920
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:07,471
In literature, in advertising, in everything.

921
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,673
I'll wager you anything, if American
women stopped wearing brassieres...

922
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:15,839
...your whole national economy
would collapse overnight!

923

How the hell did they get locked
in a basement? We'd better let 'em out.

925
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,196

oughta be able to get themselves out.

After all, if you help them,
you're not bein' fair to the others.

But the moment anybody gets to
where they're goin', we'll pick 'em up.

Pike, with the furniture van.

There's a fortune in cash, and

Now stop it. Stop it, Monica!

1170
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:23,308
It's only a couple of pieces
of small dynamite.

1171
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:26,000
And they're 70 feet away
in the other room.

1172
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,715
And this is a strong counter.
We can't possibly get hurt from there.

1173
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:51,916
Please, Melville, go and stop it. Stamp
on it. You know how I hate explosions.

1174
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:57,114
Look, all I wanna do is blow a little hole
in the wall, and then we'll be outta here.

1175
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:10,430
Something's happened to the fuse.

1176
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,028
- What could possibly have...
- Hold it. Shh!

1177
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,071
Listen.

1178
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,998
The fuse has gone out.
I can't hear it any more.

1179
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,910
- Stay down. Don't get up.
- I just wanna take a look. OK?

1180
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,115
Huh! Oh, now I see.

1181
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:34,276
It's the fire-extinguisher stuff.
It got all over the fuse and put it out.

1182
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:38,029
Melville, don't go in there.
You'll be killed. You'll be blown to bits!

1183
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:42,676
Monica, for heaven's sake! I just
wanna go in there to take a look!

Why do you always imagine
I can't do things for myself?

He knocked himself out...

...because he drank a case of bourbon
and he fell down and hit his head.

Nobody's flyin' the plane.

1214
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,310
Sir? Tower here. Emergency.

1215

We're gonna try and talk 'em down, sir.

1217
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:17,349
It's a Twin Beech. There was one here
this morning. Who's got a Twin Beech?

1218
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:22,031
Colonel Wilberforce. He was over at
Maintenance. Get him over here, fast.

1219
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:24,913
Rancho Conejo Tower.
Don't talk. Just listen.

You'll be perfectly all right
as long as you follow instructions.

1225
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:45,154
The man at the controls
should have the radio.

- Here. Put 'em on.
- No! I don't wanna!

that was flyin' should be talkin' on this.

1228
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:57,474
I have to do everything? You want me
to fly the plane, work the radio...

1229
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,158
What are you - the hostess?!

- He's sittin' in there, rigid-like.

1232
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:07,791
If he catches you at that keyhole,
<i>you'll</i> be rigid-like.

1233
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,230
- He said he didn't want to be disturbed.
- He keeps lookin' at the wall.

1234
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:16,718
He'll have to be disturbed if anything
develops. I'll bet you we could get...

1235
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,350
- Everything's under control, Chief.
- Hm?

1236
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,835
- Are you OK, Chief?
- Hm?

Yes. Why? How's everything going?

Oh, something's bound to happen soon.
Take a look at this.

1239
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:35,149
Those two in the basement started a fire
and set off fireworks, but didn't get out.

You know what I believe I'd like?

1252
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:44,315
A chocolate fudge sundae,
with whipped cream and a cherry on top.

1253
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:03,512
Dingy, don't let this worry you:

I don't think he's gonna help us, Dingy.

1259

Yes, he is, Benjy. He'll help us.
Just have confidence in him.

1260
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:23,311
He's a colonel. Listen to him.

1261
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,953
Steady, men.

1262
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:28,311
I'm told that neither of you
has had any flying experience.

1263
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:33,355
And before I say anything else, I want to
congratulate you on having done so well.

1264
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,311
Uh, so far.

1265
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:39,399
Now, first of all, men,
I'll explain what we intend to do.

1266
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:43,035
You can't land the airplane
until you've made your approach.

1267
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:45,037
And you can't make your approach...

1268
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:49,597
...until you've made a long, slow
turnaround down to the south.

1269
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:55,078
And we've got to be clear on a few things
before you can start that long, slow turn.

1270
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:59,876
Now, the stick that you're holding there...
Uh, that is, I assume that...

1271
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,675
Men, are you holding that stick?
Is somebody holding that stick?! Over.

1272
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:08,191
<i>(Benjy) What stíck? Oh, the wheel!</i>
<i>I'm holdíng ít. We're both holdíng ít!</i>

1273
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:11,710
Oh, good. For one second, I was afraid...

1274
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:16,038
Never mind. I'll explain the controls.
It's important for you to understand them.

1275
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:20,711
- Because if you don't, I'm afraid...
- <i>(plane drowns hím out)</i>

1276
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:41,115
- Do you want a lift?
- Yes. Thank you very much.

1277
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:45,199
It's awful nice of you to stop.
I'm just going as far as Santa Rosita Park.

1278
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:48,835
- Oh, that's out of my way.
- We're blocking the traffic. Move it.

1279
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,916
- Let's move it.
- All right.

1280
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:07,996
There we are. Just go and hide
behind the counter and I'll light the fuse.

1281
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:12,193
Melville, would you do just one thing
for me before you use the dynamite?

1282
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:15,039
Try hitting the door just once more.

1283
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:19,039
Oh, honey, I broke my back on that door.
That's a hard door.

1284
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,352
OK. Where's the sledgehammer?

1285
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:37,118
Hey, this staircase isn't safe.
The fire burnt it all out.

1286
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:39,196
Please?

1287
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,676
All right.

1288
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:54,835

1292

Monica... now let's forget
about the door, huh?

1293
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,791
- Look out!
- What?

1294
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,399
- They've spotted us.
- Who have?

1295
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,875
- Don't stop drivin'. Keep goin'!
- What is it?

1296
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,958
- That helicopter. They've seen us.
- What helicopter?

1297
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:31,917
- That's a police helicopter.
- Yeah. They always use 'em.

1298
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,792
- Who do?
- Who do you think?

1299
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,356
Look. I don't wanna talk about this
but I gotta. They got me hemmed in!

1300
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,630
- Who have?
- Will you shut up and listen?

1301
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:43,548
I'm gonna break a rule that says
we must never reveal our true identity.

1302
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:46,114
But this is a desperate situation.

1303
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,629
- What is?
- Will you shut up and listen?

1304
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:52,719
I haven't got much time. So if you love
your country, if you're a patriot...

1305
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:54,273
...you'll listen hard.

1306
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:59,918
I gotta get to a phone, and you gotta make
a call to the Central Intelligence Agency.

1307
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,156
- What on earth?
- Listen!

1308
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:05,670
You tell 'em that you heard from X-27.
You got it? X-27.

1309
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:10,749
X-27 told you to tell them they've made
three attempts on my life today already.

1310
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,154
Can you handle a gun?

1311
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:15,590
Now look. Ah! There's a cafe.
Pull in. You'll use that phone.

1312
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:19,918
- I don't think I wanna get involved.
- Shut up! You're in no danger. Pull in.

1313
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,590
Now get to a phone, tell the operator
"emergency priority" and ask for the CIA.

1314
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,199
All right. Jump out.

1315
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:36,915
Come on! You're in no danger!
They don't know you! You're all right!

1316
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,076
I'll duck the car and come back for you.

1317
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:45,036
For God's sakes, don't stand in the street.
They'll spot ya! Move it! Go! Hut! Go!

1318
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:01,433
Sylvester! It's Sylvester!
Turn around, you idiot!

1319
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:04,518
What do you wanna stop him for?
He's goin' the wrong way.

1320
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:06,995
It's my son. Do as you're told, stupid.

1321
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:27,631
They're nuts! Call in and say the tow truck
turned around and is followin' the Dodge.

1322
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,876
2-1-7-1 to 2-1-5-9.

1323
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,591
This is stupid. You call me a stupid idiot?

1324
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,711
Let me tell you - <i>you're</i> a stupid idiot.

1325
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:40,958
- But he'll go all the way to Plaster City.
- So he goes all the way to Plaster City.

1326
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:47,110
I'm turnin' this thing around. Now, you
wanna catch him, you get out and run.

1327
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:10,191
Let's stop arguing, please. We're only
together because they only had one car.

1328
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,039
Let's get there, even if we are last.

1329
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:16,197
Whatever the outcome of the day,
I shall never forget...

1330
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:19,676
...that you hit me when
I wasn't even looking.

1331
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:20,949
Yeah.

1332
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,916
Hey, Russell! Russell!

1333
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:46,875
- How can you possibly be so slow?
- I've had just about enough out of you.

1334
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,470
- You should've turned around quicker.
- Why don't you shut up?

1335
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:53,831
Russell! There!
It's Russell and Mr Hawthorne!

1336
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,679
- Stop 'em! Catch 'em!
- Are we gonna start that again?

1337
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,109
Faster! Step on it!
Blow the horn, ya big dope!

1338
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:03,153
- Why do you want these guys anyway?
- You gotta keep up with 'em!

1339
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,794
Go faster! Mother, it's Sylvester!

1340
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,354
Well, stop him! Don't let him get away!

1341
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:11,116
<i>(car horn sounds repeatedly)</i>

1342
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,989
I say, what's that chap
honking his hooter for?

1343
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:18,918
It's probably some road hog
who thinks he owns...

1344
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,393
- What?!
- What?

1345
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:23,353
I gotta ask you somethin'
about Mama! Russell, wait!

1346
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,119
It's my brother-in-law! What's he doin'...

1347
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,800
Be careful of him. He's not normal.

1348
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,872
You're getting me...
Boy, are you buggin' me, man!

1349
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,357
When I get... I'm gonna nail...
Ooh! I'm gettin' bugged now! Whoa, man!

<i>(car horn)</i>

1351
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:43,037
Russell, if you don't pull over, I'll kill ya!
I'm warning you, pull over and stop!

1352
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,355
I said stop! All right, you asked for it.

1353
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:53,836
<i>(all yellíng together)</i>

1354

I said stop! Are you crazy?
We'll get killed! Pull over!

1355

Don't you know what I mean?
I - said - stop - that - car!

1356
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:23,392
When I get my hands on you, Russell,
I will kill you!

1357
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:26,389
Aaarghh!

1358
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,231
Aaarghhh!

1359
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,994
I've never seen anything like this bunch.

1360
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:56,839
He ran right into 'em.
He ran 'em right off the road!

1361
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:01,155
- You guys come outta there!
- <i>(Algernon)</i> The fellow's beside himself!

1362
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,748
Sylvester, what are you trying to do?
Let's go.

1363
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:07,429
- What did you do to my mother?!
- We wouldn't harm your sweet mother.

1364
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:09,551
- Move!
- What did you do to my mother?!

1365
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:11,750
I didn't do anything! Let me explain!

1366
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:14,110
Now look here!

1367
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:18,313
She phoned me. What she told me was
so horrible, I thought she'd gone nuts!

1368
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:21,750
- But it was true, wasn't it?
- No. Whoever said that, she was a liar.

1369
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,438
- It's not true!
- It is!

1370
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,516
Now look here!

1371
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:30,994
- Are you English? Just answer me!
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

1372
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:35,079
- Why? Don't you like the English?
- <i>(roars)</i>

1373
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:39,793
She said that you and an Englishman...
I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!

1374
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:43,230
- Sylvester, don't choke me!
- What did you do to my mama!

1375
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,475
Emmeline!

1376
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:45,953
- Sylvester!
- Mama!

1377
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,593
Why couldn't you listen?

1378
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:50,678
Why couldn't you shut up?
I was tryin' to tell you to listen!

1379
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,633
Have a care! That chap's
run absolutely amuck!

1380
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,357
Very soon we'll have them in position.

1381
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:59,199
Very soon, men,
we'll have you in position.

1382
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:01,675
- You're doin' a great job, Colonel.
- Thank you.

1383
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:04,030
Why don't we just shoot 'em down?

1384
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:07,314
None of these people must suspect...

1385
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:11,115
...that they have ever been
under observation.

1386
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:15,119
Now, none of them have ever seen me.
None of them know me.

1387
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:17,800
So I'll be moving in alone.

1388
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:21,952
The minute I move in,
I'll give you the word.

1389
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,116
And when you pass the word...

1390
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:28,476
...I don't want to have another policeman
within miles of me.

1391
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,556
- Right?
- Right.

1392
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:33,438
I, uh...

1393
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,872
I won't like it...

1394
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,116
...if I see another policeman.

1395
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:43,392
And I give you my word, I wanted to stop
for ya, my wife wanted to, he wanted to.

1396
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,795
But my mother-in-law
made us drive by you.

1397
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:48,070
Anything you'd have to say about her...

1398
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:51,158
...you don't have to explain to me.
You know what I mean?

1399
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:55,239
It's like if she were a star of a real
crummy horror movie, I'd believe it.

What's the matter, Chief?
You forgotten somethin'?

1409

No. I don't think I've forgotten a thing.

- Nothing.

Are you sure he didn't say
something else and you've forgotten?

1524
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:51,275
Look, he said it would be buried
under a big W and that we'd see it.

- We're wasting time.

- I don't know, but he hasn't got a shovel.

He's here! That's his car!
Wait till I get my hands on that phony.

02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,673
So let's get sensible
and get this thing organised!

1584
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:43,394
- Did you all hear what Mama said?
- Yeah.

1585
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:44,873
Come on, Mama.

1586
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:49,312
Now wait a minute. Did any of you...
anybody see a guy with glasses...

1587
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,874
...with a real sneery
expression on his face?

1588
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,992
I mean, this guy was ugly.
I mean, like, real ugly.

1589
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:03,268
And if you help me dig it up,
you can have half and I'll have half.

1590
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:05,789
Is that OK? I mean, is that fair?

1591
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:09,069
Because if I have half of the money...

1592
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:12,909
...I can go away somewhere
where nobody can find me.

1593
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:16,953
Not Russell, or my mother,
or Sylvester - anybody.

1594
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:20,275
You don't know what that'd mean.

1595
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:25,155
Why, if I had enough money, I might even
be able to live in a convent or something.

1596
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:27,350
- In a convent?
- Uh-huh.

1597
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:29,830
Now, we all know
that we're all here. Right?

1598
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:34,397
It seems intelligent to me that we should
all share in one equal share apiece.

1599
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,112
- Is that right?
- He's right.

1600
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:38,595
- So we all know that! Look...
- <i>(clunk)</i>

1601
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:41,436
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah!

1602
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:43,710
It's him, all right. Yeah!

1603
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:47,469
You got this wrong! I came to apologise!

1604
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:49,875
Forgive and forget! I'm your friend!

1605
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:52,270
Oh, no, you got me... Oh, he's so neurotic!

1606
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,516
- Can't you do something?
- I'll get ya!

1607
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:58,997
- He's very neurotic. I'm your friend!
- If I get my hands on you, I'II...

1608
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:11,719
Why, that's it!

1609
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,637
Sure! Look!

1610
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:15,910
It's the big W, I tell ya!

1611
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:17,996
It's the big W!

1612
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:22,036
Look at this! Look at it!

1613
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:24,116
<i>(all talk excítedly)</i>

1614
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:33,314
I'm sorry, Mrs Finch.
I'm afraid it's too late.

1615
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:35,396
I think they've found it.

1616
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:43,716
Folks, isn't this great?!

1617
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:47,039
Congratulations. Well done!

1618
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:50,709
Listen. I think the big boy here
should get an extra share from all of us.

1619
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:52,831
After all, it was he who found it.

1620
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:56,191
Yes, I insist. He gets an extra share.

1621
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:59,357
- <i>(Fínch)</i> Yes. He deserves an extra share.
- Well, I...

1622
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:03,029
- Let's start diggin'.
- If somebody comes, what'll we tell 'em?

1623
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:06,869
We could say we're here
with an anthropological expedition.

1624
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,310
We tell 'em to hit the road
or we'll beat their brains in!

1625
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,996
Well, it was a nice dream.

1626
02:05:14,120 --> 02:05:16,076
It lasted almost five minutes.

1627
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:27,756
- Don't bug me, I said!
- Tell him to dig!

1628
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:31,395
<i>(whísperíng)</i> Faster.
Come on, Sylvester. Dig, dig.

1629
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,715
Faster. Faster.

1630
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:36,274
Faster. Dig. That's it. Dig.

1631
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:30,155
Faster.

1632
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:46,235
Hey, come on. There's not enough room!
There's not enough room! You two, out.

1633
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:55,876
Wait a minute! There's not enough room!

1634
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,594
- And you're buggin' me!
- What do you mean, buggin'?

1635
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:00,438
- Cut out.
- What is this "cut out"?

1636
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:03,358
- Out, baby. Out, baby, out!
- Don't call me "baby".

1637
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:05,436
- Quit arguing!

1640
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:22,716
It sounded like it hit a chest.

1641
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:24,796
<i>(all talk at once)</i>

1642
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:34,028
Scrape the dirt away.
Get the dirt out of it. Use your hands.

1643
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:40,272
It's a satchel!

1644
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:43,836
- I got it. I got it.
- Open it. Open it up.

1645
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:45,916
Quick! Come on!

- <i>(Benjy)</i> Bingo!
- That's it!

1647
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:52,953
I say, chaps, shouldn't we
find a spot of cover?

1648
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:55,833
- No! There's nobody around.
- Come on. Count it out.

1649
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:58,076
- What are we waiting for?
- Wait a second!

1650
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:02,432
Everybody's gonna get somethin', so no
arguments, cos we'll get an equal share!

1651
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:05,309
He's right. That's the only way to do it.

1652
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:08,079
Shares for everybody!
Now, how many are we?

1653
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:12,999
One, two, three, four, five...

1654
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:14,951
...six, seven, eight...

1655
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:19,589
...nine, ten, eleven, twelve...

1656
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:22,632
...thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

1657
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:27,311
- Fifteen of us. That's fifteen equal shares.
- Why, you dirty double-crosser!

1658
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:30,989
- You cut yourself in twice!
- You can't get away with that!

1659
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:34,556
Grab him! Grab him! Get him!

1660
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:40,511
You didn't cheat anybody but yourself
because now <i>you're</i> out!

1661
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:42,596
Listen. Listen!

1662
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:46,076
You can't cut me out now!
Not after what I've been through!

1663
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:48,593
All right. OK.

1664
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:52,633
I'm warnin' ya, if I don't get a share,
I'm gonna go straight to the police!

1665
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:54,990
- The police?
- Look here, you rotter...

1666
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:58,635
Yap yap yap yap! That money
had to come from somewhere!

1667
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:03,117
It come from that poor old man who died
up on the mountain this morning.

1668
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:06,949
- You wasn't even there, so shut up!
- All right. OK. You asked for it.

1669
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:08,957
I'm gonna go straight to the police!

1670
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:11,594
Why would the police
be interested, Mr Meyer?

1671
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:14,154
Are you kiddin'? Isn't it obvious?

1672
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:16,236
How do you think money gets...

1673
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,992
- How did you know my name?
- Do you know this crook?

1674
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:26,797
Well, I've never actually met him, Mr Pike,
but I've come to feel that I know him.

1675
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:30,717
How do you know <i>my</i> name?
I don't believe I've met you.

1676
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:35,119
Yeah. Who are you? We thought he came
with you. Didn't he come with you?

1677
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:38,198
He didn't come with <i>us.</i>
We thought he came with <i>you.</i>

1678
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:41,710
- <i>(Díng)</i> No!
- If he didn't come with you or with us...

1679
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:44,192
...well, then, who are you?

1680
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:48,598
I'm Captain Culpeper
of the Santa Rosita Police Department.

1681
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:56,233
- <i>Wíll you come to the poínt?</i>
- I'm comin' to the point.

1682
02:09:56,360 --> 02:10:00,069
The point is that I happen to have
enough stuff in my private files...

1683
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:05,752
...stuff relating to civic building, road
contracts, harbour and cannery projects...

1684
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:09,873
Enough stuff to put you, the DA,
myself and a two-thirds majority...

1685
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,673
...behind bars for the next 20 years.

1686
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:16,713
And I give you my word that
that's exactly where everybody is going...

1687
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:19,638
...unless certain things
start happening now!

1688
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:21,034
<i>Líke what, for ínstance?</i>

1689
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:25,836
I want the pension for Culpeper's grade
trebled! Not doubled - trebled!

1690
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:28,394
I want Culpeper to retire with honour.

1691
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:32,559
I want it on paper and signed
that that's exactly what's gonna happen...

1692
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:35,240
...and I want that paper in my hands
in 15 minutes...

1693
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:38,909
...or I'll have all the reporters in town
in here in 20.

1694
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:43,113
Now, you know the word for this,
Your Honour. It's called blackmail.

1695
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:04,394
Sir, could you possibly see your way
clear to... give us a break?

1696
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:06,511
You kiddin'? Him give you a break?

1697
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:12,318
We had a rough day already. We was all
covered in dirt and fell down in a plane...

1698
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:15,637
...and my grandmother's dying in Oxnard.

1699
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:19,031
I know we don't deserve
any kindness, Captain, but...

1700
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:23,711
...if you could help us, I'm sure we'd all
be inspired to go on and live better lives.

1701
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:26,753
Well, there is one thing.

1702
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:29,189
I don't know whether it would help or not.

1703
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:33,518
But... if, instead of <i>my</i> turning you in...

1704
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:36,108
...you went and turned yourselves in...

1705
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:39,869
...juries sometimes look
very favourably on things like that.

1706
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,195
You... You'd let us do that?

1707
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,709
What are we waiting for?
Let's turn ourselves in.

1708
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:49,311
You're a fine human being, sir. After all,
why should you care if we get a break?

1709
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:54,560
Well, Mr Meyer, no matter what you've all
done today, you're not really criminals.

1710
02:11:55,800 --> 02:12:01,716
So, if you like, you can all hop into those
two cabs and drive over to Santa Rosita...

1711
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:04,832
...and, uh... just walk in.

1712
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:08,509
- Then let's do that.
- But we can't all get into the two cabs.

1713
02:12:08,640 --> 02:12:12,713
You can't take the stolen vehicles. Those
have to stay here to be picked up later.

1714
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:15,400
Well, let's go before he changes his mind.

1715
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:17,476
<i>(all talkíng at once)</i>

1716
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:25,675
Drive carefully. They may be
the last passengers you'll ever carry.

1717
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:28,598
Oh, funny. That's funny.
Funny, right? Funny?

1718
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:31,393
You could be the most comical cop
I ever met.

1719
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:33,272
Yeah!

1720
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,956
- Culpeper.
- <i>Yes, sír?</i>

1721
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:03,995
Everything is under control here.

1722
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:09,638
It'll take a little longer because there was
a joker that nobody knew about. Right?

1723
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:11,398
<i>Yes, sír.</i>

1724
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:14,512
So don't make a move of any kind
until you hear from me.

1725
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:16,392
