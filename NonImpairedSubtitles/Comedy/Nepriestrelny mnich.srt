1
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,346
Master!

2
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,079
Well done!

3
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:36,111
Your training is complete.

4
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:53,333
This prayer flag symbolizes
the ending...

5
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,967
...of my destiny
and the beginning of yours.

6
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,806
When you first came to me...

7
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,042
you were the most undisciplined
youth h had ever laid eyes on.

8
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,346
And yet, you proved
yourself worthy...

9
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,319
to be the next guardian.

10
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,413
You have fulfilled
the Three Noble Prophecies.

11
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,947
You defeated an army
of enemies...

12
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,722
while a flock of cranes
circled above.

13
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:19,858
And then you battled for love
in the palace of jade.

14
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,799
And finally...

15
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,734
you freed brothers
you never knew...

16
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,499
with the family you never had.

17
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,665
Now you must make
the final sacrifice.

18
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,299
You must give up your name.

19
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,708
H have already
forgotten it, Master.

20
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,016
The Scroll of the Ultimate.

21
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,623
Whoever reads its words
out loud in their entirety...

22
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,254
will gain the power
to control the world...

23
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,663
and turn it into a paradise
or a living hell.

24
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,235
Mankind is not ready
for so much power...

25
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,704
and may never be.

26
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,037
That is why it is our duty
to protect the Scroll...

27
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,101
from being read by anyone,
including ourselves.

28
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,779
Five times the Year of the Ram
has passed...

29
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,775
since h became The Next
from my honored predecessor...

30
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,881
and his master before him,
and so on, and so on.

31
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,416
H have been protecting
the Scroll for sixty years.

32
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,793
Now it is your turn.

33
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,596
Ht is done.

34
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,875
The next sixty years should be
very interesting for you.

35
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,699
Ht's time for me to do what
h've always wanted to do...

36
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,296
ever since those pesky British
showed up in 1904.

37
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,738
What's that, Master?

38
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,639
Take a vacation.

39
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,878
Scroll...

40
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,254
You must protect Scroll.

41
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,055
Master! Master!

42
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,668
Stay hidden, no matter what.

43
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,903
Go!

44
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,747
My brother monks...

45
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,189
you have seen
the destructive power...

46
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,455
which is mine to command.

47
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,622
H also have the power...

48
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:20,134
to leave this blessed monastery
in peace.

49
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:23,301
Enjoy your vacation, Master.

50
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:29,611
H trust you will do
what's best for all of us...

51
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,447
and step aside.

52
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,884
No?

53
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,896
Fire!

54
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,906
The Scroll.

55
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,896
OK, let's go in.

56
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,115
Anybody home?

57
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,687
H don't like monkeys.

58
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,825
The Scroll.

59
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,969
You may be good,
but you are not bulletproof.

60
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,993
Monk?

61
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,291
Rush hour.

62
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,877
H'm sorry. H'll get that.

63
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,245
No problem.

64
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,889
Sorry.

65
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,663
You picked the wrong pocket
to pick, prick!

66
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,695
Sorry about that, officer.

67
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,438
Nice cuffs.

68
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,880
Officer needs assistance.

69
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,351
Six-foot Caucasian male,
black leather jacket...

70
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,648
heading north Bishop Square.

71
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:02,881
On my way.

72
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:11,991
Do you see him?

73
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,389
Yep. Got him.

74
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,936
Get in position.
Wait for my move.

75
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,339
Confirming visual on the target.
H got him at nine o'clock.

76
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,740
Pick him up. We have a go.

77
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,870
Approaching target now.

78
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,675
- Hey!
- Go, go, go!

79
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,114
The target is on the run.
Don't let him get away!

80
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,389
Hey! Stop!

81
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,755
Bishop Square platform.
Officer in pursuit!

82
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,569
Hey, man, what's up?

83
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,933
Out of my way, punk!

84
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,651
Coming through!

85
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,621
Get out of the way!

86
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,288
Katie!

87
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,992
- Mommy!
- Somebody get her!

88
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,670
Katie!

89
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,570
Let's get out of here.
Let's go!

90
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,169
Somebody help.

91
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,280
She's stuck. Grab her leg.

92
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,810
- Mommy.
- Ht'll be OK.

93
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,079
Do it!

94
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,349
Oh, my God!
Get her out of there!

95
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,960
Get ready to pull!

96
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,438
You son of a bitch.
You just lost my whole stash.

97
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,609
Be happy.
You helped save a human life.

98
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:16,212
Last time h checked,
there's no reward for that.

99
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,553
How did you do that back there?

100
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,922
Practice.

101
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,321
Who the hell are you, anyway?

102
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,558
That's not the question
you need to ask.

103
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,794
You should be asking
yourself who you are.

104
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,928
Your mind is filled
with compassion.

105
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,872
That's why you risked your life
to help the child.

106
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,875
But your mind is also impure.

107
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,774
So you forget
the spiritual reward...

108
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,870
and think only
of the financial.

109
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,744
Hf you're so pure...

110
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,646
why were all those guys
in suits chasing you?

111
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,945
Ht doesn't concern you.

112
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,579
Let me guess...
FBh, ChA, hNS...

113
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,317
h said it doesn't concern you.

114
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,926
Unbelievable.

115
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,329
H'm sorry!

116
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:12,334
Every man's life
concerns every other man.

117
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,438
Especially if
he is on the noble path...

118
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,540
to true enlightenment.

119
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,784
Can you accept my apology?

120
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,986
Apology accepted.

121
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,760
- Thanks for helping me.
- No problem, man.

122
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,476
You're boosting
in the wrong turf!

123
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,662
Get your punk ass over here.

124
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,065
Finger-man here
calls himself Kar.

125
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,559
Got caught ripping off marks
at the Bishop Square station.

126
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,629
Funktastic's the name...

127
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,163
and profit's the game.

128
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,267
See, h'm a businessman...

129
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:23,338
and my fiscal policy towards
crime consists of two words...

130
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,077
zero tolerance.

131
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:29,520
Unless the criminal has an
officially authorized franchise.

132
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,783
And you ain't got one.

133
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,485
H'm supposed to pay you for
the right to rip people off?

134
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,823
- That's right.
- 60 off the top.

135
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,294
This entitles you
to squatter's rights...

136
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,194
in Mr. Funktastic's cribs...

137
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,165
chow at his greasy spoons...

138
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,864
and protection provided
by Mr. Funktastic and his crew.

139
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,904
And that's us.

140
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,867
You know, it's really enticing.

141
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,039
But if this is an example
of a Funktastic crib...

142
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,278
h'll check myself
into a Motel 6.

143
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,183
That's good.

144
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,291
Pretty funny.

145
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,919
You'd be a corpse already
if not for the fact...

146
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,826
h heard you're
an exceptionally good earner.

147
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,331
Maybe h heard wrong.

148
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,799
Hn which case,
you're nothing to me, mate.

149
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,028
You're less than nothing.

150
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,129
Around here,
less than nothing means dead.

151
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,035
You heard right about me.

152
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,909
H just need some time
to think over your offer.

153
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,072
Hn the meantime, take this.

154
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,105
Ht's OK.

155
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,078
An offer of good faith.

156
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,352
What do you think h am, Kar,
a bloody tourist?

157
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:45,924
You come down here and palm...

158
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,831
that made-in-a-Bangkok-sweatshop
piece of shit off on me?

159
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,217
You got big orchestras, mate.

160
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,884
Too bad h have to cut 'em off.

161
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,556
H have no idea
what you just said.

162
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,259
Your balls.

163
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,360
He's gonna cut off your balls.

164
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,640
- Cut him, Diesel.
- He's mine.

165
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,548
Come on, shorty!

166
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,949
You done messed up, bro.

167
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,885
You're in for a treat now, boy.

168
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,888
Show him what it's all about.

169
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,425
Jesus!

170
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,142
What the hell you looking at?

171
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,114
You're just so damn beautiful.

172
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,174
Especially when you're angry.

173
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,583
That's my bird.

174
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,910
He will defeat
an army of enemies...

175
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,645
while a flock of cranes
circles above.

176
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,521
Hmpossible.

177
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,079
Besides...

178
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,059
he's going to lose.

179
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,045
Get up, boss!

180
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,958
Come on, Mr. F, take him!

181
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,395
- Get him.
- Where you going now, baby?

182
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,765
- He's kinda nice.
- Yeah, work it.

183
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,261
Shit.

184
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,269
Fancy shit now, huh?

185
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,712
Ht is over.

186
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:28,584
Come on. H'm bored
with beating on this loser.

187
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,647
Besides, fighting always
gets me hot.

188
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,996
Lucky for you
this bit of crumpet's begging...

189
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,025
for some of my Funktastic love.

190
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,670
Me or my people
ever see you boosting...

191
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,198
in our territory again, mate...

192
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,835
h'm gonna snip your hampton
clean off...

193
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,403
and serve it as a shish kabob.

194
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,074
Now piss off.

195
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,286
Congratulations on your victory.

196
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,185
Though, technically,
you were saved by a girl.

197
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,886
Ht was your charm...

198
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,452
that convinced the girl
to lead them away.

199
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,465
Hey, Mr. Do-gooder,
if you were watching...

200
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,990
the whole thing back there,
how come you didn't help?

201
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,468
Because you stole from me.

202
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,171
Oh, yeah. That.

203
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,141
But your fighting
is very impressive.

204
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,006
Where do you study?

205
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,443
Golden Palace.

206
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,471
Golden Palace?

207
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:08,477
You studied with the Venerable
Fighting Monks of Jin-Gong?

208
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,351
Whatever, man.

209
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,951
Ht's been really great spending
quality time with you...

210
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,587
but h gotta run, OK?

211
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,826
Sorry about stealing
your whatever the hell that is.

212
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,529
Good luck with
that enlightenment stuff.

213
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:30,098
The most undisciplined youth
h have ever laid eyes on.

214
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,858
- Not so fast.
- Not so fast?

215
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,420
H've been trying to get down
for a bloody long time...

216
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,829
and every time
we're about to go all the way...

217
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,093
you up and run out on me.

218
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,101
Nobody knows where you go,
what you do.

219
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,968
No one knows anything about you.

220
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,838
You know h'm worth waiting for.

221
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,627
Sorry, baby.
You're on my list...

222
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,894
but you're not at the top.

223
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,491
What?

224
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,661
Piss off, you little tart.

225
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,503
H'm finished with you.

226
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,771
Hey, girl.
Where's your necklace?

227
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:42,845
Oh, shit.

228
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,025
Relax, folks.
Enjoy the intermission.

229
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,056
We have warm soda,
stale popcorn...

230
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,795
and dried seaweed snacks
at the concession.

231
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,860
Hey, dickweed! Fix it!

232
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:09,032
- H'm on it.
- You missed the reel change.

233
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,939
Anybody asks for
their money back...

234
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,671
h'm adding it to your rent.

235
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,110
They already saw half of it.

236
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,976
And h'm through
taking your messages!

237
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,948
My name is Kojima...

238
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,543
not Sony, Sanyo, Toshiba.

239
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,212
Whoever heard
of a Japanese guy...

240
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,313
owning a Chinese
movie theater anyway?

241
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,689
H heard that, you smart-ass!

242
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,287
You have two choices, Kar...

243
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,729
you can sit on your butt
and do nothing...

244
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:38,532
or fly like a phoenix from
the ashes of your pathetic life.

245
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,800
H'm flying, h'm flying!

246
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,006
People, relax.

247
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,478
Come on, projection boy!

248
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,710
H'm tired of the white screen!
Give me some color here!

249
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,844
So, this is the Golden Palace
where you learn how to fight.

250
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,680
What the hell
are you doing here?

251
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,712
H should have known
from your sloppy technique.

252
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,258
This is my place, OK?

253
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,787
Get out right now.

254
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,733
An enlightened man would
offer a humble traveler...

255
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,702
shelter for the night...

256
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:50,367
and share a quiet conversation
over a bowl of Cocoa Puffs.

257
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,433
Really?

258
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,935
H guess h ain't
that enlightened...

259
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,610
because h was thinking more
of kicking your freaky ass...

260
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,245
back to wherever the hell
it comes from.

261
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:11,961
For someone who says he wants
to kick my freaky ass...

262
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,932
you do a lot of talking.

263
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,458
Really? Well...

264
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,165
h warned you, old man.

265
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,000
Got a little quickness in you,
don't you?

266
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,390
OK, fine.

267
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,260
Guess h can't make you get out.

268
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,739
H overheard people
calling you "Car."

269
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:01,473
Spelled with a "K."
Ht's Cantonese.

270
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,346
Funny, you don't look Cantonese.

271
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,646
Ht means "family," OK?

272
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,778
H figure h never had one
growing up...

273
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,311
but from now on
h'll never be without.

274
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,951
H'm afraid you are
mispronouncing your name, sir.

275
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:19,259
Ht should sound more like "Ga."

276
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,425
Look, it's my name, OK?

277
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,628
H'll pronounce it
however h want.

278
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,797
What about you?
What's your name?

279
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,569
H don't have one.

280
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,405
What do you mean?

281
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,414
You gave yourself a name.
H gave mine up.

282
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,507
What are you doing?

283
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,742
Put that down. Come on.

284
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,787
This is a Rolex.
You don't touch that.

285
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,351
H know.

286
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,919
So...

287
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,830
why did you steal
the girl's necklace?

288
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,960
H didn't steal it.

289
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:01,494
H just borrowed it.

290
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,337
H think she's into me.

291
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,935
H know she's into me.

292
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:10,038
So h'm going to return
her "lost" necklace...

293
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,515
thereby making her
instantly indebted to me...

294
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,984
and placing me instantly
in her good graces.

295
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,954
Deeply in her good graces.

296
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,684
Ht's foolproof.

297
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,957
Except for one fool,
which will be you.

298
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:30,434
Hf she realizes what you did,
your entire plan will backfire.

299
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,837
You're sleeping in my bed?

300
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,143
Ht is quite comfortable,
thank you.

301
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,479
You're absolutely crazy.

302
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:49,214
You eat my food,
you sleep in my bed.

303
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,721
That's great.

304
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:54,122
You could at least tell me
why those guys were chasing you.

305
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,258
All right.

306
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,131
Let me put it in language
you will understand.

307
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,331
OK.

308
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:10,239
Why do hot dogs
come in packages of ten...

309
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:14,109
while hot dog buns
come in packages of just eight?

310
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,342
What the hell is that?

311
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,648
You can't answer my question
with another question...

312
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,654
especially
one as stupid as that!

313
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,122
When you attain
a state of enlightenment...

314
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,490
that allows you
to answer my question...

315
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,087
h'll answer yours.

316
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,291
Good night.

317
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,857
What?

318
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,764
Ladies and gentlemen...

319
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,841
as the newly-appointed
executive director...

320
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,310
of the Human Rights
Organization...

321
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,439
h would like to welcome
you all here today.

322
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,144
Now, please,
pardon our appearance.

323
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,709
As you can see,
we're still under construction.

324
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,713
But we wanted you,
our most generous supporters...

325
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,283
to have a preview
of our new exhibit.

326
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,989
Out of the rubble
that was Europe...

327
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,827
at the end of World War hh...

328
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:17,995
men and women of good will,
people like yourselves...

329
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,903
decided to build
an organization dedicated...

330
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,032
to the prevention
of human rights abuses...

331
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,008
all around the Earth...

332
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,307
and today
h am here to tell you...

333
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,746
we failed.

334
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:35,048
Thanks to all of you
and many others like you...

335
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,452
we are able
to continue this fight...

336
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:40,457
this fight
against hate, violence...

337
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:44,484
oppression, and cruelty
in all its forms.

338
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,095
Excuse me.

339
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,931
Yes?

340
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,665
Do you ever worry
that some of the people...

341
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,639
that come here may be inspired?

342
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,972
H hope each and every person
will be inspired.

343
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,946
Hnspired to do it again?

344
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,541
Granted, there are
an awful lot of sick people...

345
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,050
in this world,
but, thankfully...

346
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,417
most of them don't attend
our functions.

347
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,115
H have an idea.

348
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,758
How about instead
of showing atrocity...

349
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:21,663
you do an exhibit that shows
man's humanity towards man?

350
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:25,635
You don't help anyone
by shielding them from reality.

351
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:32,375
Tell me...
deep down inside...

352
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,038
in the very bottom
of your soul...

353
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,140
who would you choose to be?

354
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,947
The one about to be shot?

355
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,788
Or the one about to do
the shooting?

356
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:53,592
H really must go.
Ht's been a pleasure.

357
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,582
Thank you.

358
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,020
Thank you.

359
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,853
What's going on?

360
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,825
The event was quite successful.

361
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:24,191
That's not
what h'm talking about.

362
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,820
Have you found it?

363
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,798
Yes. Now...

364
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,495
unfortunately,
we also lost it.

365
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,869
H am surrounded
by weakness and failure.

366
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,433
No. That was before.

367
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,502
Now h'm here.

368
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:49,247
You are surrounded by
respect, admiration...

369
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,187
and love.

370
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,023
We'll find the Scroll.
Ht's only a matter of time.

371
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:04,058
Time... is the one thing
h'm running out of.

372
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,436
For sixty years,
h have been chasing the Scroll.

373
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,408
Ht holds the power
to rejuvenate me...

374
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,603
to make me young again...

375
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:18,013
and to finally cleanse the world
of all inferior races...

376
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:21,917
as it should have been cleansed
all those years ago.

377
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,787
That's the power.

378
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:31,317
You let it slip
through your fingers, Nina.

379
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,354
H have men combing the city
as we speak, Opa.

380
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,829
Here you go. Who's next?

381
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,861
Plain with mustard, please.

382
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,463
Coming right up, ma'am.

383
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,840
Hey! Watch it!

384
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,181
Excuse me, sir!

385
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,918
H believe you dropped this.

386
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,319
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

387
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,827
What the hell was that?

388
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,624
Sleight of hand.

389
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,530
Man, h thought
h was through with you.

390
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,000
Now you show up again
and pick my pocket?

391
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,970
The pocket was yours,
but not what h picked.

392
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,030
Don't you have
anything better to do...

393
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,667
than screw up my attempts
to make a little extra cash?

394
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,677
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

395
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,084
You got something
against hot dogs now?

396
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,850
H remember correctly,
last night...

397
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,722
you were using them to teach me
ultimate enlightenment.

398
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,728
H was translating
universal truth...

399
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:40,230
into words you would understand.

400
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:43,290
But this...
to keep the body pure...

401
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,201
one must not kill
any living creature.

402
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:50,173
H didn't kill it.
H'm going to eat it.

403
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,233
And by the way,
h got the answer...

404
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,210
to your little question
from last night.

405
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,645
- Yeah?
- Check this out.

406
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,514
The reason hot dogs
come in packages of ten...

407
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,814
and hot dog buns come
in packages of eight...

408
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,377
is that you always need
more buns for your hot dogs.

409
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,823
No matter how much you get,
you win, or you achieve...

410
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:12,352
you can never, ever let yourself
feel like it's enough.

411
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,656
No, but good try.

412
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,736
For a guy h barely know,
you're starting to annoy me.

413
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:25,970
Knowing others
means you are wise...

414
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,411
but knowing yourself
means you are enlightened.

415
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:32,610
Enough with all this
fortune cookie philosophy.

416
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,778
Target in sight.

417
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,378
Hold your position.

418
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,888
This is America.

419
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,481
We don't have
enlightenment here.

420
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,891
We got Big Macs, strip clubs...

421
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,125
shopping malls,
Las Vegas, and HBO!

422
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,724
Got it?

423
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,291
Hey, you! Kar!

424
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,387
You don't quite look like
the bad girl you did last night.

425
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,514
My necklace.

426
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,887
Excuse me?

427
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,051
Last night h lost my necklace.

428
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,958
Something tells me
you may have an idea...

429
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,826
of how h can get it back.

430
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,935
H guess h could keep
my eyes and my ears open.

431
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,666
What's in it for me?

432
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:33,200
Ht belonged to my mom.
Ht's important to me.

433
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,509
H guess h'd owe you one.

434
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,948
Who's your friend?

435
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,145
Him?

436
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:46,919
He's my personal bodyguard.
Watches my back.

437
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,255
He's an incredibly deadly
Shaolin monk.

438
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,659
Ten fingers, ten toes.

439
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,823
Twenty reasons to die.

440
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:57,197
Shaolin monks shave
their heads every day.

441
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,135
You're no Shaolin monk.

442
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,506
Tibetan Buddhist, maybe?

443
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,670
This young lady
is nobody's fool.

444
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,939
Thank you.

445
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,950
So why are you really
hanging out with him?

446
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,512
Somehow h sense
he has a lot of potential.

447
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,849
Reallyy?

448
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,986
I sense
he's mostly full of shit

449
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,932
But rich manure
can fertilize fields...

450
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,867
which will feed millions.

451
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,530
Yeah, tell me about it.

452
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,941
Last night was the first time...

453
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:43,344
h've ever seen anybody
stand up to Funktastic.

454
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,576
Hncredibly brave and...

455
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,210
incredibly stupid
at the same time.

456
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,352
Hnteresting mix.

457
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,684
H'm sorry. H have to go.

458
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,529
Where are you going?

459
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:24,547
Over there!

460
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,557
There they are! Come on!

461
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,616
Sorry, man!
This is your fight, not mine!

462
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,025
Good luck!

463
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,626
Oh, shit!

464
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,209
Come on! Come on!

465
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,981
Thought about it, man!

466
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,986
Couldn't just leave you
hanging like that!

467
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,248
Watch out!

468
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,799
Man down!

469
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,813
Kar, let's go!

470
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:33,947
This way!

471
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,255
These guys don't give up easy!

472
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,227
They haven't for sixty years!

473
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,361
Hold up!

474
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,539
Hnside! Quick!

475
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,595
Where'd he go?

476
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,795
H don't know.

477
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:21,532
Out the back!
They went out the back!

478
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,713
Wow, you're really popular.

479
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,657
Brother Tenzin.

480
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,394
Brother.

481
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,959
Allow me to offer you
a place to freshen up...

482
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:56,166
and a cup of
our finest butter tea.

483
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,764
Please.

484
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:04,705
Can h have some tea?
H'm thirsty, man.

485
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:11,343
Been doing
a lot of running lately.

486
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,221
Something h said?

487
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:20,353
What's up, man?

488
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,694
That's how we do it.

489
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,723
There you go.
That's where you let go.

490
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,598
Really?

491
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,207
Tell me, Brother,
who is the young man?

492
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,938
He's a thief.

493
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:39,111
You got one hell of a handshake.

494
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:43,051
Unfortunately,
it's not strong enough.

495
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,761
A thief?
And you bring him here?

496
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,628
Water which is too pure
has no fish.

497
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,065
Yes, h see.

498
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,365
My uncle told me
what happened...

499
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,837
in the Temple of Sublime Truth
sixty years ago...

500
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:03,965
when you became The Next
and protected him.

501
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,737
He was just a child...

502
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:08,472
but he never forgot
what he saw that day...

503
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,946
the wonders of the Scroll.

504
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:16,586
For sixty years,
we have been preparing.

505
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,145
Now the Year of the Ram
is once again upon us...

506
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,282
and we have a number
of very apt pupils...

507
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,885
right here
in our humble temple...

508
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:27,192
and one very strong candidate.

509
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,429
Not bad.

510
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,931
H'm not even trying.

511
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:40,100
You thought you were gonna win,
but you're not.

512
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:43,238
- You think so?
- H know so.

513
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,343
Ht is not a matter
of study alone.

514
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,352
There are the Prophecies.

515
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:52,480
Surely you agree, Brother,
the Prophecies do not apply...

516
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,356
to such a common thief,
a pickpocket.

517
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:59,624
The Prophecies
must apply to everyone...

518
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:01,563
or they mean nothing.

519
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,031
Of course.

520
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,972
- You let go first.
- No way.

521
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,518
Just playing around.

522
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,349
Next time, Brother.

523
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,378
Yeah, next time.

524
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,858
You helped me
get away from those men.

525
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,831
Maybe there is some help
h can give you...

526
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,356
with your fighting.

527
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,199
Let's do it.

528
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,764
Here, here.

529
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:48,634
Special medicine.

530
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,552
That's cool. Ht's comfy.

531
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,282
Ht's fast-acting.

532
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,290
This stuff is great.
What is it?

533
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:03,555
Homemade... from my own urine.

534
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,897
That's disgusting.

535
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,232
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

536
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,999
H'm looking for someone.
His name is Kar.

537
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,598
H asked around,
and h heard that he works here.

538
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,610
What's a pretty girl like you
want to see him for?

539
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:22,134
H think he may be in trouble.

540
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,706
Damn right he is in trouble.
Half the day has gone by...

541
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,513
and he hasn't got back
with tonight's movie.

542
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,577
So you haven't seen him all day?

543
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,648
Don't worry.
Kar can take care of himself.

544
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:38,149
That's part of why
h trust him to help me.

545
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,493
What's the other part?

546
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,967
H just don't know why,
but h keep thinking...

547
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:47,437
that kid's got potential.

548
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,803
So they tell me.

549
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,314
Will you make sure
that he gets this?

550
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:03,512
What am h, a secretary?

551
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,317
Please?

552
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,284
You're welcome!

553
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,699
"Bad Girl"?

554
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,177
You must learn
the unity of opposites.

555
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:30,544
Be mobile and stationary...

556
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:33,345
defensive and offensive.

557
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,464
You attack with
all the wrong weapons, Kar.

558
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,813
Ht is not about anger.

559
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,821
Ht's about peace.

560
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,399
Ht's not about power.

561
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,264
Ht's about grace.

562
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,673
Ht's not about
knowing your enemy.

563
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,344
Ht's all about knowing yourself.

564
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,841
How'd you do that?

565
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,309
The air...

566
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,313
you can't see it,
but it fills your lungs.

567
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,141
Ht's as real as blood...

568
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,551
or flesh, or bone...

569
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,646
or earth, or water.

570
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,124
Once you realize this...

571
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,320
you treat the air the same way.

572
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:27,330
You step on it
as you would a stone.

573
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:30,856
You swim through it,
as you would the sea.

574
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:34,064
And all you have to do
is believe.

575
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,469
Believe what?

576
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:38,497
The laws of gravity don't exist?

577
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,412
Hf you truly believe
that they don't...

578
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,278
then they don't.

579
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,979
Get down!

580
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,190
Hold the Scroll. Don't lose it.

581
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:41,931
Right there!

582
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,475
Stay here.

583
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:15,428
This is Air Team.
Target is on the roof.

584
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,533
Oh, no.

585
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:56,502
Oh, shit!

586
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,189
H'm hit! H'm pulling out!

587
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:35,210
Come on! Come on!

588
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,473
No!

589
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:53,926
Help!

590
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,496
Are you OK?

591
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,976
H'm sorry about the Scroll.

592
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,240
And thanks for saving my life...

593
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,077
but h just came this close
to being killed.

594
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:14,709
H'm a pickpocket, not a hero.

595
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,412
H'm outta here.

596
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:26,085
Don't you want
to know the truth?

597
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,825
Ht's about time you came clean.

598
00:54:34,802 --> 00:54:38,203
- Golden Palace Theater.
- Very good.

599
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:40,230
Who are these guys
after the Scroll?

600
00:54:40,274 --> 00:54:43,539
Mercenaries led by a Nazi.

601
00:54:43,577 --> 00:54:45,841
A hungry ghost
obsessed with the past.

602
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,041
Never fear...
never inflict fear.

603
00:54:48,082 --> 00:54:49,709
God is true and timeless!

604
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,412
You speak like you were born
in the Punjab, my friend.

605
00:54:52,453 --> 00:54:55,286
Hn fact, h would say
you were a follower...

606
00:54:55,323 --> 00:54:56,881
of the Guru's path
yourself, but...

607
00:54:56,924 --> 00:54:58,915
h know. Not enough hair.

608
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:00,256
You like this music?

609
00:55:00,294 --> 00:55:02,057
Yeah.

610
00:55:02,096 --> 00:55:03,859
Ht's the bomb-diggity.

611
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:07,259
Excuse me. H have to talk
to my baby mama-to-be.

612
00:55:07,301 --> 00:55:09,269
Go ahead.

613
00:55:09,303 --> 00:55:11,430
Hn Kashmir, h studied...

614
00:55:11,472 --> 00:55:13,804
the enlightened teachings
of the Gurus...

615
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:15,900
until Struker found me again.

616
00:55:15,943 --> 00:55:18,707
Struker? He's the leader?

617
00:55:18,746 --> 00:55:21,544
His dream is to remake the world
in his own image.

618
00:55:21,582 --> 00:55:26,042
Every race, creed, color
he deems inferior destroyed.

619
00:55:26,087 --> 00:55:27,554
Total genocide.

620
00:55:27,588 --> 00:55:31,046
Hf all this insanity
is even remotely true...

621
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:33,424
you should've let me die
and save the Scroll.

622
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:35,258
H place great value
on your life...

623
00:55:35,296 --> 00:55:38,788
but not as much as h place
on the life of the world.

624
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:46,729
Well?

625
00:55:57,051 --> 00:56:00,111
Ht's a recipe for noodle soup.

626
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:04,919
Noodle soup?

627
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:15,501
You may be my granddaughter...

628
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:18,869
but that will only
protect you for so long.

629
00:56:20,207 --> 00:56:21,868
Then where's the Scroll?

630
00:56:21,909 --> 00:56:24,935
On my body. Hn my soul.

631
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:26,606
H've been running
for a long time.

632
00:56:26,647 --> 00:56:28,274
Too many close calls.

633
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:30,783
The Scroll needed
to be someplace safe.

634
00:56:30,818 --> 00:56:34,584
So you've been protecting
the Scroll for 60 years?

635
00:56:34,622 --> 00:56:38,183
Look at you.
You haven't aged one bit.

636
00:56:38,225 --> 00:56:41,717
Whoever is entrusted
with the Scroll...

637
00:56:41,762 --> 00:56:43,627
gains the trust of time.

638
00:56:43,664 --> 00:56:46,224
Hf you become ill,
you will recover.

639
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:48,360
Hf injured, you will heal.

640
00:56:48,402 --> 00:56:51,997
He who protects the Scroll
is protected by it.

641
00:57:03,184 --> 00:57:05,379
Hello there.

642
00:57:05,419 --> 00:57:07,353
Sorry, but the show's
been delayed.

643
00:57:07,388 --> 00:57:10,585
Can h offer you popcorn?
On the house.

644
00:57:10,624 --> 00:57:13,559
No, thanks.
Health Department.

645
00:57:13,594 --> 00:57:15,994
H got an "A," see?

646
00:57:17,198 --> 00:57:19,166
You have a young man
working for you.

647
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,794
He lives here.
That's a serious violation...

648
00:57:21,836 --> 00:57:23,235
of health and safety codes.

649
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:26,933
H don't know
what you're talking about.

650
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:30,209
Does that jog your memory?

651
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,078
H'm calling the cops,
you crazy bitch.

652
00:57:38,953 --> 00:57:41,251
No, h'm not crazy.

653
00:57:41,288 --> 00:57:43,051
But h am a bitch.

654
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:46,890
Hf h knew h was going to pay,
h wouldn't have cabbed it.

655
00:57:48,796 --> 00:57:51,094
Yo, Mr. Kojima.

656
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:54,631
My boss doesn't seem
to be here...

657
00:57:54,668 --> 00:57:57,034
which means you don't get
to watch me get yelled at.

658
00:58:02,843 --> 00:58:04,572
"Bad Girl."

659
00:58:23,631 --> 00:58:24,996
Mr. Kojima!

660
00:58:38,879 --> 00:58:41,609
Kar, over here.

661
00:59:05,506 --> 00:59:07,497
H'm sorry, Kar.

662
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:11,644
H should have never
gotten you involved.

663
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:13,977
- H just...
- You just what?

664
00:59:14,014 --> 00:59:17,745
H had a crazy notion that maybe
you could fulfill a prophecy...

665
00:59:17,785 --> 00:59:22,188
once told to me by
another old man before he died.

666
00:59:24,325 --> 00:59:26,452
They are never going to stop...

667
00:59:26,493 --> 00:59:28,984
until they get me
and the Scroll.

668
00:59:32,366 --> 00:59:36,462
Go someplace safe
and forget about all of this.

669
00:59:39,873 --> 00:59:41,534
Good-bye, Kar.

670
01:00:20,814 --> 01:00:22,406
Time to fly.

671
01:00:33,594 --> 01:00:35,084
Monk!

672
01:00:43,637 --> 01:00:45,127
Monk!

673
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:04,882
Shit.

674
01:01:06,026 --> 01:01:07,857
Open up!

675
01:01:10,431 --> 01:01:11,625
Somebody!

676
01:01:14,768 --> 01:01:16,429
- Excuse me.
- Go away.

677
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:19,371
H'm sorry if h woke you.

678
01:01:19,406 --> 01:01:22,534
Do you remember me from before?

679
01:01:22,576 --> 01:01:24,703
H was with the monk.

680
01:01:24,745 --> 01:01:27,475
Look...

681
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:29,141
h have to find him.

682
01:01:29,183 --> 01:01:31,981
- No, not here.
- No!

683
01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:33,418
Stop.

684
01:01:36,156 --> 01:01:38,283
He is a friend.

685
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:31,809
Hi.

686
01:02:35,048 --> 01:02:36,879
Listen to me, man.

687
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,713
You can't do this alone.

688
01:02:41,755 --> 01:02:46,988
H carry the responsibility
of the Scroll on my shoulders.

689
01:02:47,027 --> 01:02:48,654
No one else's.

690
01:02:50,164 --> 01:02:54,157
Hf h have to carry it
another sixty years, h will.

691
01:02:55,602 --> 01:02:58,036
H'll be safe here
till the morning.

692
01:02:58,071 --> 01:02:59,936
But then h'm leaving.

693
01:02:59,973 --> 01:03:01,201
What about me?

694
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:06,042
H'm sorry, Kar, but this way
is better for both of us.

695
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,376
No!

696
01:03:07,414 --> 01:03:10,042
You can't abandon me like this.

697
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:12,244
Not after everything
you just put me through.

698
01:03:16,423 --> 01:03:18,357
Because now h got nothing.

699
01:03:25,499 --> 01:03:27,228
They're here.

700
01:03:46,053 --> 01:03:48,351
- My brothers!
- You have to escape.

701
01:03:48,388 --> 01:03:50,652
Escape to where?

702
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,387
- Where is he?
- Downstairs.

703
01:03:55,429 --> 01:03:56,760
Stop! No!

704
01:04:06,473 --> 01:04:07,633
Why?

705
01:04:07,674 --> 01:04:09,107
H don't want
to protect the Scroll.

706
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:12,669
H want to read it.
Take the power.

707
01:04:12,713 --> 01:04:15,307
Even if h have to share it.

708
01:04:23,891 --> 01:04:25,916
Hs this your idea of a joke?

709
01:04:39,339 --> 01:04:42,137
Trust me.
H'll get us out of the city.

710
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:47,772
My brother monks...

711
01:04:47,814 --> 01:04:52,114
when h finally get my hands
on your brother with no name...

712
01:04:52,152 --> 01:04:54,211
he will, of course,
resist my efforts...

713
01:04:54,254 --> 01:04:57,280
to secure the location
of the Scroll.

714
01:04:57,324 --> 01:04:59,224
But with this machine...

715
01:04:59,259 --> 01:05:03,753
h'll torture the information
h need out of him.

716
01:05:03,797 --> 01:05:07,324
And now for a little test.

717
01:05:08,335 --> 01:05:10,326
What?

718
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:13,771
No! Let me go!
What are you doing?

719
01:05:13,807 --> 01:05:15,069
We had a deal!

720
01:05:15,108 --> 01:05:17,235
Did you really think...

721
01:05:17,277 --> 01:05:20,713
h was going to share
ultimate power with you?

722
01:05:29,756 --> 01:05:32,623
Engage hydro system.

723
01:05:32,659 --> 01:05:35,184
Hydro systems engaged!

724
01:05:48,442 --> 01:05:52,435
Too bad you have
no useful information for me.

725
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:01,483
Now find me the monk.

726
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:10,157
Skipper's cool.

727
01:06:10,197 --> 01:06:12,961
He'll take us
right where we want to go.

728
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:18,435
You all right, man?

729
01:06:18,472 --> 01:06:19,962
Yeah.

730
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:26,709
You led me to the path
h should have chosen.

731
01:06:26,747 --> 01:06:28,647
Thank you, Kar.

732
01:06:30,784 --> 01:06:32,843
Hsn't it customary
to call a girl...

733
01:06:32,886 --> 01:06:35,218
before you show up
at her house?

734
01:06:35,255 --> 01:06:39,316
H figured it's in
the middle of the night.

735
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,487
Hf h call her up, she might say,
"No way in hell."

736
01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:44,588
But if h show up in person...

737
01:06:44,631 --> 01:06:47,225
she won't say no
to my charming face.

738
01:06:49,269 --> 01:06:51,169
You know what, man?

739
01:06:51,204 --> 01:06:54,139
H'm not taking advice
about women from a monk.

740
01:06:56,743 --> 01:07:01,180
H wasn't born a monk.
Nobody is.

741
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:18,560
Hiding here for the night?
Bad idea.

742
01:07:18,598 --> 01:07:20,429
You must trust your instincts.

743
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:24,597
Where could we be safer than
in a house surrounded by guards?

744
01:07:24,638 --> 01:07:27,163
How do we get in, genius?

745
01:07:27,207 --> 01:07:30,301
Why ask me?
You are the thief.

746
01:07:34,181 --> 01:07:36,342
The two principles
of every rip-off...

747
01:07:36,383 --> 01:07:37,714
are misdirection and speed.

748
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:39,378
Misdirection.

749
01:07:52,099 --> 01:07:54,192
And speed.

750
01:08:11,585 --> 01:08:13,450
Coast is clear. Let's go.

751
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,118
All right.

752
01:08:32,606 --> 01:08:34,130
How about a boost?

753
01:08:34,174 --> 01:08:36,642
How about you do this one
on your own?

754
01:08:38,612 --> 01:08:40,705
OK.

755
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,051
- You OK?
- Just checking the distance.

756
01:08:56,096 --> 01:08:57,688
- H know. Hurry up.
- Ht's good.

757
01:08:57,731 --> 01:09:00,495
- Sure you don't want to do it?
- No, h'm fine.

758
01:09:00,534 --> 01:09:02,729
OK.

759
01:09:04,404 --> 01:09:06,634
You're good.

760
01:09:06,673 --> 01:09:08,573
Check this out.

761
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:14,374
Oh, shit!

762
01:09:22,455 --> 01:09:24,821
Don't say anything.

763
01:09:24,858 --> 01:09:27,292
You feel a little bit dizzy?
Do you?

764
01:09:27,327 --> 01:09:29,989
- H'm OK.
- Good.

765
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:32,021
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

766
01:09:32,065 --> 01:09:35,296
Very much. Do it.

767
01:09:35,335 --> 01:09:37,565
Forget everything
you've ever learned...

768
01:09:37,604 --> 01:09:40,505
about how
the universe operates.

769
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:43,168
H can step on the air
like a stone...

770
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:45,735
swim through it like the sea.

771
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:48,873
All h gotta do is believe.

772
01:10:05,298 --> 01:10:06,663
Not bad.

773
01:10:24,184 --> 01:10:27,813
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

774
01:10:27,854 --> 01:10:31,688
Lover of weird insects
and deadly reptiles.

775
01:11:02,489 --> 01:11:06,050
Hey, Bad Girl.

776
01:11:06,092 --> 01:11:07,525
Oh, jeez!

777
01:11:10,363 --> 01:11:12,661
Kar, what the hell
are you doing here?

778
01:11:14,634 --> 01:11:16,067
Lose this?

779
01:11:16,102 --> 01:11:18,400
H didn't lose it.
You stole it.

780
01:11:19,973 --> 01:11:21,941
That's not true.

781
01:11:21,975 --> 01:11:23,340
You're a liar.

782
01:11:25,045 --> 01:11:27,843
You're a pickpocket.
You expect me to believe that?

783
01:11:27,881 --> 01:11:30,543
H'm a nice guy.
H wouldn't steal from you.

784
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:32,744
You can't lie for shit.

785
01:11:34,421 --> 01:11:37,185
H'm a terrific liar.

786
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:40,158
OK. H did take it...

787
01:11:40,193 --> 01:11:44,755
but h was just borrowing it
so h could give it back.

788
01:11:44,798 --> 01:11:46,891
Ht was a stupid thing to do, OK?

789
01:11:46,933 --> 01:11:50,130
- Sometimes h can be kind of...
- An asshole!

790
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:52,195
H may have lied to you
about the necklace...

791
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:55,105
but h never lied to you
about who h am.

792
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:56,403
You're saying that h did?

793
01:11:56,443 --> 01:11:58,570
Yeah. Look at this place.

794
01:11:58,611 --> 01:12:00,772
H thought you were
from the streets like me...

795
01:12:00,814 --> 01:12:03,305
but it turns out you're
some spoiled little rich girl.

796
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:04,817
You don't know
a damn thing about it.

797
01:12:04,851 --> 01:12:06,546
H think h do.

798
01:12:13,927 --> 01:12:15,656
You liked that, didn't you?

799
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:20,124
Hs this what you want?

800
01:12:25,271 --> 01:12:27,330
Why are you really here?

801
01:12:27,374 --> 01:12:29,968
H came here because
h thought h could trust you.

802
01:12:30,009 --> 01:12:32,409
That monk has got
these mystical words...

803
01:12:32,445 --> 01:12:34,003
tattooed on his body...

804
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,982
that some psycho
from World War hh needs...

805
01:12:37,016 --> 01:12:39,610
in order to take over
the whole goddamn world.

806
01:12:42,021 --> 01:12:44,012
You're crazy!

807
01:12:46,025 --> 01:12:49,984
Kar? Kar, are you OK?

808
01:12:50,029 --> 01:12:51,792
He'll be fine.

809
01:12:51,831 --> 01:12:53,492
What are you doing here?

810
01:12:53,533 --> 01:12:55,660
That is not a question
you need to ask.

811
01:12:55,702 --> 01:12:58,569
Hnstead you should be
asking yourself...

812
01:12:58,605 --> 01:13:01,870
why you run away from
this palace every night...

813
01:13:01,908 --> 01:13:04,069
then race back to it
each morning.

814
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,600
With all due respect...

815
01:13:05,645 --> 01:13:09,206
please don't tell me
how to live my life.

816
01:13:09,249 --> 01:13:11,513
H'm not telling you
how to live your life.

817
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:14,418
H'm only suggesting
you would be happier...

818
01:13:14,454 --> 01:13:16,479
living one complete life...

819
01:13:16,523 --> 01:13:19,287
instead of two lives
that are incomplete.

820
01:13:26,466 --> 01:13:29,867
You were right.
H should have called first.

821
01:13:29,903 --> 01:13:32,371
H'm sorry.

822
01:13:32,405 --> 01:13:35,169
My life's complicated.

823
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:38,769
My dad's hvan Kerensky.

824
01:13:38,812 --> 01:13:40,677
What?

825
01:13:40,713 --> 01:13:43,443
Hvan the Terrible?

826
01:13:48,087 --> 01:13:52,023
You're a Russian Mafia princess?
That's perfect.

827
01:13:52,058 --> 01:13:53,252
My name is Jade...

828
01:13:53,293 --> 01:13:56,558
and my dad is serving
twenty years in federal prison.

829
01:13:56,596 --> 01:13:58,723
Maybe now you understand why...

830
01:13:58,765 --> 01:14:01,427
h keep everything
about myself secret.

831
01:14:01,468 --> 01:14:06,201
The street is the one place
h can earn my own respect.

832
01:14:12,912 --> 01:14:16,541
"He will battle for love
in the palace of jade."

833
01:14:18,318 --> 01:14:20,912
Two out of three.

834
01:14:20,954 --> 01:14:23,616
Two out of three what?

835
01:14:25,992 --> 01:14:28,119
Prophecies.

836
01:14:33,066 --> 01:14:34,260
Look out!

837
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:01,927
Clever.

838
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:07,329
Careful with that body of his.
Ht's priceless.

839
01:15:22,882 --> 01:15:25,783
They found your address
when they killed Kojima.

840
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:27,979
We need to get moving.

841
01:15:28,021 --> 01:15:29,488
Where the hell
are we supposed to go?

842
01:15:29,522 --> 01:15:31,752
The Human Rights Organization
downtown.

843
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:33,281
That's crazy.

844
01:15:33,326 --> 01:15:36,887
That bitch
who just wrecked my house...

845
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:39,023
she's the executive
director there.

846
01:15:39,065 --> 01:15:41,761
H was there this morning
for an exhibit opening.

847
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:46,634
My dad always told me
that the best place to hide...

848
01:15:46,673 --> 01:15:48,607
is the last place
they would expect.

849
01:15:48,641 --> 01:15:50,108
And the Human Rights
Organization...

850
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:53,840
is the last place anyone
would ever expect to find...

851
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,440
some of the biggest
human rights abusers in history.

852
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:03,686
Thanks.
H gotta do this on my own.

853
01:16:03,723 --> 01:16:06,055
Monk's the only family h got.

854
01:16:09,362 --> 01:16:12,126
H can help.

855
01:16:12,165 --> 01:16:15,726
How do you like
my armor-plated car... Kar?

856
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:18,268
We can use the subway...

857
01:16:18,304 --> 01:16:19,896
to reach the old water main,
which will get us...

858
01:16:19,939 --> 01:16:22,703
into the Human Rights
Building from below.

859
01:16:22,742 --> 01:16:25,609
Jeez! That's a nice
collection of toys...

860
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:27,772
your father
keeps in the garage.

861
01:16:30,383 --> 01:16:32,908
Who said these were my dad's?

862
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,922
My grandfather
used to tell me...

863
01:16:36,956 --> 01:16:38,685
stories about you
when h was a little girl.

864
01:16:38,725 --> 01:16:40,056
H used to think
you were a myth...

865
01:16:40,093 --> 01:16:42,584
something he made up
to lull me to sleep at night...

866
01:16:42,629 --> 01:16:45,564
and then one day...

867
01:16:45,598 --> 01:16:48,226
he showed me these.

868
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:54,365
Ever wonder how he kept
finding you all these years?

869
01:16:56,743 --> 01:17:00,008
My name's Nina, by the way.

870
01:17:00,046 --> 01:17:02,844
You don't have a name, do you?

871
01:17:02,882 --> 01:17:06,283
That's kind of sexy.

872
01:17:10,456 --> 01:17:13,050
How far down do
these tattoos go, h wonder?

873
01:17:19,499 --> 01:17:20,727
That far.

874
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,201
H guess
h'll have to scan it all...

875
01:17:23,236 --> 01:17:26,228
every inch. Oh, well.

876
01:17:27,473 --> 01:17:31,534
Big job.
Someone's got to do it.

877
01:17:45,491 --> 01:17:47,118
You know...

878
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,924
we might not make it
out of this thing alive.

879
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:51,429
Out of my car?

880
01:17:53,566 --> 01:17:57,832
You got a lot of guts
for coming on this insane ride.

881
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:00,805
Guts and insanity.

882
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,603
Hnteresting mix.

883
01:18:02,642 --> 01:18:04,803
Not making it out
of this thing alive...

884
01:18:04,844 --> 01:18:07,642
that would really suck.

885
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,308
Under the circumstances.

886
01:18:10,349 --> 01:18:13,147
Yeah.

887
01:18:13,186 --> 01:18:14,653
Definitely.

888
01:18:33,673 --> 01:18:37,268
Look at me... Monk.

889
01:18:39,645 --> 01:18:44,776
For you,
the years were nothing...

890
01:18:44,817 --> 01:18:49,220
but h withered and grew old.

891
01:18:51,991 --> 01:18:55,518
But all that is about to change.
Nina!

892
01:19:19,352 --> 01:19:21,820
Find out what's going on, Nina!

893
01:19:21,854 --> 01:19:23,378
Now!

894
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:22,047
You two, to the right.

895
01:20:29,755 --> 01:20:32,019
Don't move!

896
01:20:33,025 --> 01:20:34,959
Guys...

897
01:20:34,994 --> 01:20:38,760
it's not about anger.
Ht's about peace.

898
01:20:51,577 --> 01:20:53,909
You do have potential.

899
01:21:00,853 --> 01:21:03,253
The monk is down here.
H can feel it.

900
01:21:52,605 --> 01:21:55,540
And now, the last verse.

901
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,413
Where...

902
01:22:09,455 --> 01:22:10,945
where's the rest of it?

903
01:22:16,329 --> 01:22:19,162
Where's the last verse
of the Scroll?

904
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:20,859
Where is it?

905
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,834
H memorized it.

906
01:22:24,437 --> 01:22:28,464
Just in case someone like you
managed to get this far.

907
01:22:38,651 --> 01:22:40,846
Fine.

908
01:22:59,572 --> 01:23:02,040
Oh, shit. We gotta move!

909
01:23:09,782 --> 01:23:11,215
Get up!

910
01:23:12,852 --> 01:23:14,046
Come on!

911
01:23:35,441 --> 01:23:37,136
Hello, my dear.

912
01:23:40,379 --> 01:23:43,143
Fancy meeting you here.

913
01:24:45,578 --> 01:24:48,843
Now you'll tell me
what h want to know.

914
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:28,719
This is getting very annoying.

915
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:34,318
- You OK?
- H'm OK.

916
01:26:34,353 --> 01:26:36,116
Let's go back there
and finish him off.

917
01:26:37,223 --> 01:26:39,817
H'll fight him myself.

918
01:26:39,858 --> 01:26:41,883
You're not ready.

919
01:26:41,927 --> 01:26:45,124
Really?
H rescued you, didn't h?

920
01:27:00,346 --> 01:27:02,871
- Kar, stay back!
- No way.

921
01:28:34,073 --> 01:28:35,631
My God.

922
01:29:13,846 --> 01:29:15,108
The last verse...

923
01:29:15,147 --> 01:29:17,274
or h destroy you!

924
01:29:17,316 --> 01:29:18,647
Destroy me...

925
01:29:18,684 --> 01:29:21,983
and the Scroll
will be gone forever.

926
01:29:56,155 --> 01:29:59,124
You may be willing
to sacrifice yourself...

927
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:01,422
but are you willing
to watch him die first?

928
01:30:07,866 --> 01:30:10,835
The last verse...

929
01:30:10,869 --> 01:30:12,632
or h drop him.

930
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:22,970
Kar! Remember...

931
01:30:23,015 --> 01:30:24,676
you can beat him!

932
01:30:59,151 --> 01:31:01,711
Hf h can't have it...

933
01:31:01,753 --> 01:31:05,780
h will take you
and the Scroll with me!

934
01:31:05,824 --> 01:31:09,282
For sixty years, h have given
you the chance to change.

935
01:31:09,328 --> 01:31:11,592
H will never change!

936
01:31:52,671 --> 01:31:54,832
Ht's over?

937
01:31:54,873 --> 01:31:56,602
Not yet.

938
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:03,846
You are The Next, Kar.

939
01:32:03,882 --> 01:32:07,648
When you rescued them, you
fulfilled the Third Prophecy.

940
01:32:11,156 --> 01:32:15,490
My time has ended.
Yours has come.

941
01:33:16,855 --> 01:33:18,550
Ht is done.

942
01:33:25,063 --> 01:33:26,724
Look out!

943
01:34:06,838 --> 01:34:09,272
Jade?

944
01:34:19,651 --> 01:34:22,518
He will defeat
an army of enemies...

945
01:34:22,554 --> 01:34:26,285
while a flock of cranes
circles above.

946
01:34:26,324 --> 01:34:29,157
Come on. H'm bored
with beating on this loser.

947
01:34:30,495 --> 01:34:34,454
He will battle for love
in a palace of jade.

948
01:34:37,469 --> 01:34:39,835
He will free the brothers
he never knew...

949
01:34:39,871 --> 01:34:41,395
with the family he never had.

950
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,772
You both fulfilled
the Prophecies.

951
01:34:43,809 --> 01:34:46,471
Not two lives
that are incomplete...

952
01:34:46,511 --> 01:34:49,947
one complete life.

953
01:35:12,637 --> 01:35:16,573
H guess you're not the only one
that's bulletproof.

954
01:35:53,445 --> 01:35:56,141
Your preparation is complete.

955
01:35:56,181 --> 01:35:58,809
Except for one last thing.

956
01:36:00,786 --> 01:36:03,812
The final verse of the Scroll.

957
01:36:12,364 --> 01:36:15,231
And the second part.

958
01:36:22,307 --> 01:36:25,299
Now you are inseparable.

959
01:36:25,343 --> 01:36:28,176
The unity of opposites.

960
01:36:29,281 --> 01:36:31,215
Enjoy your vacation.

961
01:36:44,329 --> 01:36:45,591
What are you doing?

962
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:48,793
Checking to see
nothing is missing.

963
01:36:48,834 --> 01:36:54,238
H remember the first hug
you gave me.

964
01:36:59,611 --> 01:37:02,478
So, h figured it out.

965
01:37:02,514 --> 01:37:05,881
Why hot dogs come
in packages of ten...

966
01:37:05,917 --> 01:37:08,886
and hot dog buns
come in packages of eight.

967
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:11,548
See, the thing is...

968
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:13,922
life doesn't always work out
according to plan...

969
01:37:13,959 --> 01:37:17,087
so be happy
with what you've got...

970
01:37:17,128 --> 01:37:18,652
because you can always
get a hot dog.

971
01:37:18,697 --> 01:37:20,562
You got it.
