Look at it.
A bit much.

325
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,770
'cause he's gonna give a speech
that makes all of weed legal,

drug lords out of business.

We're a bunch of best friends hanging out.
It's like a sleepover.

Okay, food. How are we
gonna deal with this?

772

Um...

773
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,326
Can I have that Milky Way?

774
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,845
No, you can't have
the Milky Way.

775
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,086
That's my Milky Way.
There's a bunch... What?

776
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,571
I went out this morning,

777
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,723
specifically bought this Milky
Way to eat after my party.

778
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,801
That's weird.

779
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,325
It's not weird.
It's my special food.

780
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,050
I like it. Back me
up on that, Seth.

781
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,406
I don't think you should get
the whole Milky Way.

782
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,527
I want some of the Milky Way.

783
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,331
I'd be pretty bummed if I don't at
least get a bite of the Milky Way.

784
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,447
Oh! Now Craig wants
a bite of the Milky Way.

785
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah, I want a bite of the Milky Way.
It's a fucking Milky Way.

786
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,725
A fifth of everything is
what's fair and reasonable.

787
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,609
Everyone gets
a fifth of everything.

788
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,250
I want one-fifth
of your T-shirt!

789
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,084
I want the bottom part,
the belly.

I'm not sporting
a crop top in your house.

791
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,250
I'll cut that shit off
and make a headband.

You couldn't handle my midriff.

793
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,964
Guys, the only issue is,
I kind of need the Milky Way.

794
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,201
For fuck's sake.

795
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,611
No, for real,
I have low blood sugar,

796
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,681
and if my endorphins
drop too low,

797
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,761
I'm gonna be
a nightmare to be around.

What? Your LBS starts acting up,

you can have a finger
scoop of Nutella, okay?

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,281
One finger scoop of Nutella.
Fair.

I'm sure it would
have something to do

I had no interest

Maybe this was meant to be.

Maybe this horrible, horrible,
deadly earthquake happened

828
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,367
so we could become closer
as a group of friends.

You're actually alive.
Thank God!

1181
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,845
I hid in a drainpipe for days.

1182
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,810
Like, three or four.
I don't even know how many.

1183
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,370
And then I stopped
hearing people,

1184
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,124
and I started hearing
growling noises.

1185
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,602
Out there, in your travels, uh,

1186
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,966
did you see anything
that you would describe

1187
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,565
as Apocalyptish?

1188
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,369
I mean, no,

1189
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,247
but, uh, I would say it's completely
obvious what's going on here.

1190
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,886
I mean, it's a zombie invasion.

said it's been zombies.

1192

zombies the whole time.

1193

You never said zombies.

haven't been proven right.

1196
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,891
Honestly, I'm just so relieved
that you guys are here,

She's British, right?

She's not even a full seven.
She's, like, halfa seven.

This is a fucking

I, for one, am very excited.

1215

I'm a massive <i>Harry Potter</i> fan.

1216

What? Yes. I love
fucking <i>Harry Potter.</i>

1217
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,445
I cannot wait till she wakes up

1218
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,204
and I can ask her all these
amazing questions about

1219
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,486

those motion pictures.

in the room.

1223

Whoa. Jay, don't talk
about Craig like that.

right here, man. Yeah.

00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,048
I'm not calling
Craig an elephant.

1226

1234
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,481
She's like a little sister.

1235
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,005
I think that she needs...

1236
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,809
It's important
that she feels safe.

1237
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,370
Yeah.
And comfortable.

1238
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,805

1240
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,725
Well, I'm just saying,

1241
