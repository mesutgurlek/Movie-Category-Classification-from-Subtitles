1
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,619
Baldrick,

2
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,496
what are you doing out there?

3
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:04,748
I'm carving something on this bullet, sir.

4
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,417
What are you carving?

5
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,420
I'm carving "Baldrick", sir.

6
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,421
Why?

7
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,131
It's a cunning plan, actually.

8
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:13,632
Of course it is.

9
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,092
You see, you know they say

10
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,679
that somewhere there's a bullet
with your name on it?

11
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,598
Yes?

12
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:24,310
Well, I thought if I owned the bullet
with my name on it,

13
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:28,772
I'd never get hit by it,
'cos I won't ever shoot myself.

14
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,274
Oh, shame.

15
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,611
And the chances
of there being two bullets

16
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,739
with my name on them
are very small indeed.

17
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:41,076
That's not the only thing around here
that's "very small indeed".

18
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:44,622
Your brain, for example,
Is so minute, Baldrick,

19
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,124
that if a hungry cannibal
cracked your head open,

20
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:52,379
there wouldn't be enough inside
to cover a small water biscuit.

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,716
Tally-ho, pip-pip,
and Bernard's your uncle.

22
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,468
In English we say, "good morning".

23
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,596
- Look what I got for you, sir.
- What?

24
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:02,806
It's the latest issue of "King & Country".

25
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:04,683
Oh, damn inspiring stuff!

26
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:07,853
The magazine that tells the tommies
the truth about the war.

27
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:09,980
Or alternatively,
the greatest work of fiction

28
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:14,568
since vows of fidelity were included
In the French marriage service.

29
00:02:14,777 --> 00:02:15,903
Come, come, sir.

30
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:17,571
Now, you can't deny that this fine newspaper

31
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,031
is good for the morale of the men.

32
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:20,074
Certainly not,

33
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:24,286
I just think that more could be achieved
by giving them some real toilet paper.

34
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:25,579
I'm not with you at all, sir,

35
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:28,958
what could any patriotic chap
have against this magnificent mag?

36
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,710
Apart from his bottom?

37
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:33,254
Well, look at it.

38
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:37,591
I mean the stuff's about as convincing
as Dr. Crippen's defence lawyer.

39
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:39,718
The British tommies are all portrayed

40
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,930
as six-foot six with biceps
the size of Bournemouth.

41
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,598
Thoroughly inspiring stuff.

42
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,311
And look, sir, this also
just arrived for you this morning.

43
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:52,690
Hmm, do you know what this is, Lieutenant?

44
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,609
- It's a good old service revolver.
- Wrong.

45
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,361
It's a brand new service revolver,

46
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,865
which I've suspiciously been sent
without asking for it.

47
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:02,867
I smell something fishy,

48
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:07,830
and I'm not talking about the contents
of Baldrick's apple crumble.

49
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:10,666
That's funny, sir, because we didn't order

50
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,751
those new trench-climbing ladders either.

51
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:14,753
- New ladders?
- Yeah, came yesterday.

52
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:17,548
I issued them to the men,
and they were absolutely thrilled.

53
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:18,591
Isn't that right men?

54
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:19,842
Yes, sir,

55
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:22,553
First solid fuel we've had
since we burned the cats.

56
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,139
Something's going on,

57
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:28,017
and I think I can make
an educated guess what it is.

58
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:30,352
Something which you, George,
would find hard to do.

59
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:32,021
Ah, true, true.

60
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,607
Where I was at school,
education could go hang

61
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:37,651
as long as a boy could hit a six,
sing the school song very loud,

62
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,237
and take a hot crumpet
from behind without blubbing.

63
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,697
I, on the other hand,

64
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:43,616
am a fully-rounded human being

65
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,993
with a degree from the University of Life,

66
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:48,162
a diploma from the School of Hard Knocks,

67
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:52,249
and three gold stars from the Kindergarten
of Getting the Shit Kicked Out of Me.

68
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,211
And my instincts lead me to deduce

69
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:58,547
that we are at last about to go over the top.

70
00:03:58,797 --> 00:04:00,424
Great Scott, sir, you mean...

71
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,510
You mean the moment's
finally arrived for us

72
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,304
to give Harry Hun a darned good
British-style thrashing,

73
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:06,805
six of the best, trousers down?

74
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:10,559
If you mean are we all
going to get killed, yes.

75
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:13,354
Clearly, Field Marshal Haig is about to make

76
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:14,563
yet another gargantuan effort

77
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:17,858
to move his drinks cabinet
six inches closer to Berlin.

78
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,151
Right!

79
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:20,402
Bravo-issimo!

80
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:22,488
Well let's make a start, eh?

81
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:24,990
Up and over to glory,
last one in Berlin's a rotten egg.

82
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,536
Give me your helmet, Lieutenant.

83
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:43,092
Yes, some sort of clever hat camouflage
might be in order.

84
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:44,426
Permission to speak, sir.

85
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:48,138
Granted, with a due sense
of exhaustion and dread.

86
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,517
I have a cunning plan
to get us out of getting killed, sir.

87
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,519
- Ah, yes, what is it?
- Cooking.

88
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:54,979
I see.

89
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:59,650
You know staff HQ
is always on the lookout for good cooks?

90
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,236
Well, we go over there,
we cook 'em something,

91
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,405
And we get out of the trenches that way.

92
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:07,157
- Baldrick, it's a brilliant plan.
- Is it?

93
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:08,242
Yes, it's superb.

94
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:10,661
Permission to write home
immediately, sir!

95
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,581
This is the first brilliant plan
a Baldrick's ever had!

96
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,374
For centuries we've tried,

97
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:19,044
and they've always turned out
to be total pig swill.

98
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:21,755
My mother will be as pleased as punch.

99
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:25,801
Hmm, if only she were
as good-looking as punch, Baldrick.

100
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,262
There is, however,
one slight flaw in the plan.

101
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:29,305
Oh?

102
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:33,350
- You're the worst cook in the entire world.
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

103
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:37,771
There are amoeba on Saturn
who could boil a better egg than you.

104
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:43,569
Your filet mignons in sauce béarnaise
look like dog turds in glue.

105
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,613
That's because they are.

106
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:47,489
Your plum duff tastes like

107
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,492
it's a molehill decorated
with rabbit droppings.

108
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:51,994
I thought you wouldn't notice.

109
00:05:52,244 --> 00:05:56,165
And your cream custard has
the texture of cat's vomit.

110
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:58,000
Again, it's...

111
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:01,378
If you were to serve
one of your meals in staff HQ,

112
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,464
you'd be arrested for
the greatest mass poisoning

113
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:07,384
since Lucretia Borgia invited
500 of her close friends around

114
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,637
for a wine and anthrax party.

115
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:12,890
No, we'll have to think
of a better plan than that.

116
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,477
Right, how about a nice meal,
while you chew it over?

117
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,103
What's on the menu?

118
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:19,855
Rat.

119
00:06:20,105 --> 00:06:21,690
Sauté or fricassee?

120
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:25,861
Oh, the agony of choice.

121
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,112
Sautéed involves... ?

122
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:29,490
Well, you take the freshly shaved rat,

123
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,493
and you marinade it
in a puddle for a while.

124
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,495
Mm-hmm, for how long?

125
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:36,497
Till it's drowned.

126
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:39,333
Then you stretch it out
under a hot light bulb,

127
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,836
then you get within dashing distance
of the latrine,

128
00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:44,004
and you scoff it right down.

129
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:46,799
So that's sautéing. And fricasseeing?

130
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:48,133
Exactly the same,

131
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:50,678
just a slightly bigger rat.

132
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:53,472
Well, call me old Mr. Unadventurous,

133
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:55,975
but I think I'll give it a miss this once.

134
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,059
Fair enough, sir.

135
00:06:57,268 --> 00:06:59,645
- More for the rest of us. Eh, sir?
- Absolutely, Private.

136
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:01,605
Tally-ho, barf barf!

137
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,944
Hello, the Savoy Grill.

138
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:08,904
Oh, it's you... .

139
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:10,072
Yes... .

140
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:11,991
Yes, I'll be over in 40 minutes.

141
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:13,367
Who was it then, sir?

142
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:14,618
Strangely enough, Baldrick,

143
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:17,454
it was Pope Gregory IX,

144
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:21,250
inviting me for drinks
aboard his steam yacht "The Saucy Sue",

145
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,294
currently wintering in Montego Bay

146
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,879
with the England cricket team

147
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:26,964
and the Balinese Goddess of Plenty.

148
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:30,467
- Really?
- No, not really.

149
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:32,094
I've been ordered to HQ.

150
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:34,471
No doubt that idiot General Melchett

151
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:37,474
is about to offer me some
attractive new opportunities

152
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:41,937
to have my brains blown out for Britain.

153
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:51,155
What do you want, Darling?

154
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,159
It's "Captain Darling" to you.

155
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,493
General Melchett wants to see you

156
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,329
about a highly important secret mission.

157
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,624
- What's going on, Darling?
- Captain Blackadder to see you, sir.

158
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:03,459
Ah, excellent.

159
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,378
Just a short back and sides today,
I think, please.

160
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,923
Er, that's Corporal Black, sir.

161
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:11,008
Captain Blackadder is here
about the other matter, sir,

162
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,301
the secret matter.

163
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,971
Ah, yes, the special mission.
At ease, Blackadder.

164
00:08:16,222 --> 00:08:21,268
Now, what I'm about to tell you
is absolutely tip-top-secret.

165
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,646
- Is that clear?
- It is, sir.

166
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:26,440
Now, I've compiled a list of
those with security clearance.

167
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,901
- Have you got it Darling?
- Yes, sir.

168
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:29,944
Read it, please.

169
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:31,445
It's top security, sir,

170
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,113
I think that's all the captain needs to know.

171
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:35,324
Nonsense! Let's hear the list in full!

172
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:37,201
Very well, sir.

173
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:39,954
<i>List of personnel cleared
for Mission Gainsborough,</i>

174
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:43,082
<i>as dictated by General C.H. Melchett.</i>

175
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:45,960
<i>You and me, Darling, obviously.</i>

176
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,461
<i>Field Marshal Haig,</i>

177
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:48,754
<i>Field Marshal Haig's wife,</i>

178
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:51,090
<i>all Field Marshal Haig's wife's friends,</i>

179
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,425
<i>their families, their families' servants,</i>

180
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,719
<i>their families' servants' tennis partners,</i>

181
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,304
<i>and some chap I bumped into</i>

182
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:59,431
<i>in the mess the other day
called Bernard.</i>

183
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:03,477
So, it's maximum security, is that clear?

184
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:04,979
Quite clear, sir.

185
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:08,148
Only myself and the rest of the English-
speaking world is to know.

186
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,275
Good man.

187
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:11,443
Now, Field Marshal Haig

188
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,530
has formulated
a brilliant new tactical plan

189
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,908
to ensure final victory in the field.

190
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,619
Ah. Would this brilliant plan involve us

191
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,246
climbing out of our trenches

192
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,040
and walking very slowly
towards the enemy, sir?

193
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:26,792
How could you possibly
know that, Blackadder?

194
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,294
It's classified information.

195
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:31,130
It's the same plan that we used last time,

196
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,841
and the seventeen times before that.

197
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:36,427
E-e-exactly!

198
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,180
And that is what is so brilliant about it!

199
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,433
It will catch the watchful Hun
totally off-guard!

200
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:44,435
Doing precisely what we have done

201
00:09:44,643 --> 00:09:45,352
eighteen times before

202
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:48,439
is exactly the last thing
they'll expect us to do this time!

203
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,984
There is, however, one small problem.

204
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:55,404
That everyone always gets slaughtered
in the first ten seconds.

205
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:56,322
That's right!

206
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:58,199
And Field Marshal Haig is worried

207
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:00,659
that this may be
depressing the men a tadge.

208
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,996
So he's looking to find
a way to cheer them up.

209
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:07,917
Well, his resignation and suicide
would seem the obvious solution.

210
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,336
Interesting thought.
Make a note of it, Darling.

211
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,087
Take a look at this...

212
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:15,382
I'm sure you know it ..."King & Country".

213
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:18,844
Ah, yes, without question
my favourite magazine...

214
00:10:19,094 --> 00:10:22,223
soft, strong and thoroughly absorbent.

215
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:24,141
Top-hole, Blackadder,

216
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:28,312
I thought it would be right up your alley.

217
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:32,816
Field Marshal Haig's plan is this:

218
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:37,196
To commission a man to do
an especially stirring painting

219
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:38,989
for the cover of the next issue,

220
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,909
so as to really inspire
the men for the final push.

221
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,621
What I want you to do, Blackadder,
is to labour night and day

222
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:48,958
to find a first-rate artist
from amongst your men.

223
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,000
Impossible, sir.

224
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,210
I know from long experience

225
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,379
that my men have all the artistic talent

226
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:56,882
of a cluster of colour-blind hedgehogs...

227
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:00,052
in a bag.

228
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,929
Hmm, well that's a bit of a blow.

229
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:04,390
We needed a man to leave
the trenches immediately.

230
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,517
- Leave the trenches?
- Mm-hm.

231
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:08,561
Yes, I wonder if you've enjoyed,

232
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:10,980
as I have sir, that marvellous painting

233
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,400
<i>in the national portrait gallery,
Bag Interior,</i>

234
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,528
by the colour-blind
hedgehog workshop of Sienna.

235
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:21,031
I'm sorry, are you saying
you can find this man?

236
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,075
I think I can.

237
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,494
And might I suggest, sir,
that, having left the trenches,

238
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:29,373
it might be a good idea
to post our man to Paris

239
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,625
in order to soak up a little
of the artistic atmosphere...

240
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,836
perhaps even Tahiti...

241
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:36,922
so as to produce a real masterpiece.

242
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:38,924
Yes, yes, but can you find the man?!

243
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:41,385
Now, I know I can, sir.

244
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:43,137
Before you can say "Sunflowers,"

245
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:47,057
I'll have Vincent Van Gogh
standing before you.

246
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:52,605
No, don't stop, sir.

247
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:54,273
It's coming, it's definitely coming.

248
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:57,401
I, hmm, yeah, er, hm.

249
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,405
I just wonder whether two socks
and a hand grenade

250
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:02,865
is really the sort of thing

251
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:04,992
that covers of "King & Country" are made of.

252
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:08,204
They will be when I've painted them
being shoved up the Kaiser's backside.

253
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:12,374
- Ah, now, now, this is interesting.
- What is?

254
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,336
Well, Private Baldrick is obviously
a bit of an impressionist.

255
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:19,465
The only decent impression he can do
is of a man with no talent.

256
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:20,966
What's it called, Baldrick?

257
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,594
"The Vomiting Cavalier"?

258
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,347
No, sir, that's not supposed to be vomit.

259
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:29,892
- It's dabs of light.
- No, it's vomit.

260
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:33,896
- Yes, so, why did you choose that?
- You told me to, sir.

261
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:35,189
Did I?

262
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,566
Yeah, you told me to paint
whatever comes from within,

263
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:40,361
so I did my breakfast.

264
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:43,364
Look, there's a little tomato.

265
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:44,406
Hopeless.

266
00:12:44,657 --> 00:12:46,700
If only I'd paid attention
in nursery art class

267
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:48,369
instead of spending my entire time

268
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:52,998
manufacturing papier maché Willies
to frighten Sarah Wallis.

269
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:53,999
You know, it's funny,

270
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,502
but painting was the only thing
I was ever any good at.

271
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:58,337
Well, it's a pity you didn't keep it up.

272
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:00,631
Well, as a matter of fact, I did, actually.

273
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,216
I mean... I mean normally

274
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,634
I wouldn't show them to anyone,

275
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:05,511
'cos they're just embarrassing daubs really,

276
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,264
but you know, ah,
they give me pleasure.

277
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:10,474
I'm embarrassed to show them
to you now as it happens,

278
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,935
but there you go, for what they're worth.

279
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:16,480
To be honest, I should have
my hands cut off, I mean...

280
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,523
George! These are brilliant!

281
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:19,942
Why didn't you tell us
about these before?

282
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,026
Well, you know,

283
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:23,320
one doesn't want to blow
one's own trumpet.

284
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:25,865
You might at least have told us
you had a trumpet.

285
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,869
These paintings could spell my way out
of the trenches.

286
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,203
Yours?

287
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:34,498
That's right, ours.

288
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:36,458
All we have to do
is paint something heroic

289
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,878
to appeal to the simple-minded tommy.

290
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:40,671
Over to you, Baldrick.

291
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:44,925
Um, how about a noble tommy, standing,

292
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:46,969
with a look of horror and disgust,

293
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:49,346
over the body of a murdered nun,

294
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:51,098
what's been brutally done over

295
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:53,309
by a nasty old German.

296
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,310
Excellent.

297
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,605
<i>I-I can see it now:
the Nun and the Hun.</i>

298
00:13:57,813 --> 00:13:58,856
Brilliant!

299
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,107
No time to lose.

300
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:03,068
George, set up your easel,
Baldrick and I will pose.

301
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,154
This is going to be art's greatest moment

302
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:07,907
since Mona Lisa sat down
and told Leonardo da Vinci

303
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:10,743
she was in a slightly odd mood.

304
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:12,828
Baldrick, you lie down
in the mud and be the nun.

305
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:14,747
I'm not lying down there, it's all wet.

306
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:16,040
Well, let's put it this way:

307
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:17,333
Either you lie down and get wet,

308
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,294
or you're knocked down
and get a broken nose.

309
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:22,087
Actually it's not that wet, is it?

310
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:23,047
No.

311
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:27,551
Who are you going to be then, sir?

312
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:28,802
The noble tommy?

313
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:31,388
Precisely, standing over
the body of the ravaged nun.

314
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,681
I want a wimple.

315
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:34,934
You should have gone
before we started the picture.

316
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:36,936
You know, the funny thing is,

317
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:40,439
my father was a nun.

318
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:41,774
No, he wasn't.

319
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:43,400
He was so, sir.

320
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:45,819
I know, 'cos whenever he was up in court,

321
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,988
and the judge used to say, "Occupation?"

322
00:14:48,197 --> 00:14:51,951
He'd say, "None."

323
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:54,537
Right. You're ready?

324
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:55,871
Just about sir, yes.

325
00:14:56,121 --> 00:15:00,626
Um, if you just like to pop
your clothes on the stool.

326
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:02,169
I'm sorry?

327
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:04,296
Just pop your clothes
on the stool over there.

328
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:10,010
You mean, you want me..."tackle out"?

329
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:12,012
Well, I would prefer so, sir, yes.

330
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:14,932
If I can remind you
of the realities of battle, George,

331
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:16,892
one of the first things
that everyone notices

332
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:19,854
Is that all the protagonists
have got their clothes on.

333
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,272
Neither we nor the Hun

334
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:23,482
favour fighting our battles au naturel.

335
00:15:23,732 --> 00:15:26,527
Sir, it's artistic license.

336
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:29,280
It's willing suspension of disbelief.

337
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,282
Well, I'm not having
anyone staring in disbelief

338
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:33,576
at my Willie suspension!

339
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:38,622
Now, get on and paint
the bloody thing... sharpish!

340
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,128
Brilliant, George, it's a masterpiece.

341
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:45,963
The wimple suits you, Baldrick.

342
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:48,090
But it completely covers my face.

343
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:49,592
Exactly.

344
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:52,595
Now, then, General Melchett
will be here at any moment.

345
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:54,722
When he arrives,
leave the talking to me, all right?

346
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,682
I like to keep an informal trench,

347
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:57,808
as you know,

348
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,560
but today you must only speak

349
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:03,522
with my express permission, Is that clear?

350
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:05,941
Is that clear?

351
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:07,985
Permission to speak.

352
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,612
Yes, sir, absolutely.

353
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:12,573
Attention!

354
00:16:12,781 --> 00:16:16,619
Dugout, attention!

355
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,413
Excellent, at ease.

356
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:20,456
Now, then, Blackadder,

357
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:21,749
where would you like me to sit?

358
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:23,792
I thought just a simple trim
of the moustache today,

359
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:24,960
nothing drastic.

360
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:27,254
We're here about the painting, sir.

361
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:28,797
Oh, yes, of course.

362
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:31,217
Good Lord, George! Ha ha ha!

363
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:35,429
How are you, my boy?

364
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,765
I said how are you?

365
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:39,266
Permission to speak.

366
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:40,851
Absolutely top-hole sir,

367
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,229
with a ying and a yang and a yippetty-doo.

368
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,605
Splendid!

369
00:16:44,855 --> 00:16:46,690
And your Uncle Bertie sends his regards.

370
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:48,734
I told him you could
have a week off in April.

371
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:50,819
Don't want you missing
the boat race, do we?

372
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:52,238
Permission to speak.

373
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:53,864
Certainly not.

374
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:55,699
Permission to sing boisterously, sir?

375
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,159
If you must.

376
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:58,994
# Row, row, row your punt #

377
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:00,871
# Gently down the stream #

378
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:06,544
# Belts off, trousers down,
isn't life a scream? #

379
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:10,172
Fabulous.

380
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:12,800
University education, you can't beat it.

381
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,929
Bravo! Now, what have we here?

382
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:17,847
Name?

383
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:19,223
Permission to speak.

384
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:20,224
Baldrick, sir.

385
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,226
Ah, tally-ho, yippety-dip,

386
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,019
and zing zang spillip.

387
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,983
Looking forward to bullying off
for the final chukka?

388
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,902
Permission to speak.

389
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,530
Answer the general, Baldrick.

390
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,073
I can't answer him, sir,

391
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,242
I don't know what he's talking about.

392
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,663
Aah, are you looking forward
to the big push?

393
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:46,041
No, sir, I'm absolutely terrified.

394
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,212
Ah, the healthy humour of the honest tommy.

395
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:53,841
Ha ha ha, don't worry my boy,
If you should falter,

396
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:57,011
remember that Captain Darling
and I are behind you.

397
00:17:57,261 --> 00:18:00,848
About thirty-five miles behind you.

398
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:03,225
Right, well, stand by your beds.

399
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:05,853
Let's have a look
at this artist of yours, Blackadder.

400
00:18:06,103 --> 00:18:08,022
- Next to me, Darling.
- Thank you, sir.

401
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:10,232
So, ah, have you found someone?

402
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:13,736
Yes, sir, I think I have.
None other than young George here.

403
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:15,988
Oh, bravo!

404
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:17,198
Well, let's have a shufti then.

405
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:20,409
It's simply called "War".

406
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:23,329
Damn silly title, George.

407
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:25,748
Looks more like a couple of socks

408
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:27,666
and a stick of pineapple to me.

409
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,210
Ah, permission to speak, sir?!

410
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,171
Uh, I think not, actually.

411
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:34,173
Quite right!

412
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:35,674
If what happens
when you open your mouth

413
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:37,593
Is anything like what happens
when you open your paintbox,

414
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:39,220
we'll all be drenched in phlegm!

415
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:43,015
Oh, no, this isn't what we're looking for
at all, is it, Darling?

416
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:45,184
- No, sir.
- No sir!

417
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:48,229
There is this, sir.
It's Private Baldrick's.

418
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:52,358
He's called it
"My Family And Other Animals."

419
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,902
Oh, good Lord, no!

420
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:58,239
Well, I'm afraid that's about it, sir,

421
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:02,201
apart from this little thing.

422
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:04,620
Ah, now that's more like it!

423
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,205
Who painted this, Blackadder?

424
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:07,915
Well actually, it was me.

425
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:10,626
Permission to speak
really quite urgently, sir!

426
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:13,295
Damn and blast your goggly eyes,

427
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:15,631
will you stop interrupting, George?!

428
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:16,715
This is excellent!

429
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:20,594
Congratulations, man.
It's totally inspiring!

430
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:22,930
Makes you want to jump over the top

431
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,808
and yell, "Yah boo, sucks to you, Fritzie!"

432
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:27,560
Thank you, sir.

433
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:29,270
Are you sure you did this, Blackadder?

434
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,563
Of course I'm sure.

435
00:19:30,813 --> 00:19:36,360
- I'm afraid I don't believe you.
- How dare you, Darling?

436
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,237
General, I can't let that slur pass.

437
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,198
What possible low, suspicious,
slanderous reason

438
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,576
could this office boy have

439
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:45,744
for thinking that
I didn't paint the picture?

440
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,413
Three reasons, as a matter of fact.

441
00:19:47,663 --> 00:19:52,376
- Firstly, you're in it.
- It's a self-portrait.

442
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,170
Secondly, you told us you couldn't paint.

443
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,173
One doesn't like to blow one's own trumpet.

444
00:19:57,423 --> 00:19:58,757
- Permission...
- Denied.

445
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:00,384
And thirdly,

446
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:04,471
it's signed "George."

447
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:14,398
Well spotted.

448
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:19,028
But not signed George,
dedicated to George.

449
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:21,155
King George.

450
00:20:21,405 --> 00:20:22,823
Gentlemen, The King.

451
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:25,784
The King!
- Where?

452
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:28,037
Bravo, Blackadder, I have absolutely

453
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,705
no hesitation in appointing you

454
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:31,499
our official regimental artist.

455
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:33,751
You're a damn fine chap,

456
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:37,129
not a pen-pushing,
desk-sucking blotter-jotter

457
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:38,172
like Darling here.

458
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,173
Eh, Darling?

459
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:40,216
No sir.

460
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:41,133
No sir.

461
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:43,511
Well, accompany us back
to HQ immediately.

462
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:46,013
Ten shun!

463
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:47,848
Permission to jolly well speak
right now, sir,

464
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:50,142
otherwise I might just
burst like a bloody balloon!

465
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:55,022
Later, George. Much later.

466
00:20:55,272 --> 00:20:58,108
Congratulations on your
new appointment, Blackadder.

467
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,276
Thank you, sir.

468
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:01,946
And may I say, Blackadder,
I am particularly pleased about it.

469
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:03,155
Are you?

470
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:04,615
Oh, yes.

471
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:08,244
Now that you are
our official war artist,

472
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:09,954
we can give you the full briefing.

473
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:11,497
The fact is, Blackadder,

474
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:13,541
that the King & Country cover story

475
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,918
was just a cover story!

476
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:19,129
We want you, as our top painting bard,

477
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,589
to leave the trenches...

478
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,799
Good.

479
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:23,384
- Tonight
- Suits me.

480
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:27,471
And go out into No-Man's Land.

481
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:32,142
- No-Man's Land.
- Yes.

482
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:34,770
- Not Paris.
- No.

483
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,897
We want you to come back

484
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:38,941
with accurate drawings
of the enemy positions.

485
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:42,361
You want me to sit in No-Man's Land

486
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:45,531
painting pictures of the Germans?

487
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:47,491
Precisely... good man!

488
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,702
Well, it's a very attractive proposition,

489
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,871
but unfortunately, not practical.

490
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:53,497
You see, my medium is light.

491
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,708
It'll be pitch-dark...
I won't be able to see a thing.

492
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,585
Ah... that is a point.

493
00:21:57,835 --> 00:21:58,627
I tell you what...

494
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:00,546
We'll send up a couple of flares.

495
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:03,257
You'll be lit up like a Christmas tree.

496
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:07,344
Oh, excellent. Glad I checked.

497
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:10,347
All right... total and utter quiet.

498
00:22:10,598 --> 00:22:13,893
So, for instance, if any of us
crawl over any barbed wire,

499
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:15,978
they must on no account go...

500
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:17,104
Aaahhh!!!!

501
00:22:17,354 --> 00:22:19,690
You just crawled over
some barbed wire, sir?

502
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:20,858
No, Baldrick,

503
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:22,943
I've just put my elbow
in a blob of ice cream.

504
00:22:23,194 --> 00:22:23,944
Well, that's all right.

505
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:26,113
Now, where the hell are we?

506
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:28,115
It's a bit difficult to say.

507
00:22:28,365 --> 00:22:30,701
We appeared to have crawled into an area
marked with mushrooms.

508
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:33,078
And what do those symbols denote?

509
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:35,623
That we're in a field of mushrooms?

510
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:37,750
That is a military map,

511
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,378
It is unlikely to list
interesting flora and fungi.

512
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:43,797
Look at the key and you'll discover

513
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:45,633
that those mushrooms aren't for picking.

514
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:47,676
Good Lord, you're quite right, sir.

515
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:49,345
It says "mine".

516
00:22:49,595 --> 00:22:51,347
So these mushrooms

517
00:22:51,597 --> 00:22:55,434
must belong to
the man who made the map.

518
00:22:57,686 --> 00:23:01,065
Either that, or we're in the middle
of a mine field.

519
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:02,525
Oh, dear.

520
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:04,276
So he owns the field as well?

521
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:09,824
They're firing, sir, they're firing!

522
00:23:10,074 --> 00:23:12,368
Yes, thank you, Lieutenant.

523
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:16,038
If they hit me, you'll be sure
to point it out, won't you?

524
00:23:16,288 --> 00:23:18,541
Get on with your drawing
and let's get out of here.

525
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,584
Surely we ought to
wait for the flare, sir,

526
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:22,294
you see, my medium is light...

527
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:25,422
Just use your imagination,
for heaven's sake!

528
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:27,633
Wait a minute... that's the answer.

529
00:23:27,883 --> 00:23:30,427
I can't believe I've been so stupid!

530
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:31,720
That is unusual,

531
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:33,848
'cos usually I'm the stupid one.

532
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:35,140
Well, I'm not over-furnished

533
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:37,101
In the brain department.

534
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:38,561
Well, on this occasion,

535
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:40,062
I've been stupidest of all.

536
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:41,730
Oh, now, sir,

537
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:43,691
I will not have that.

538
00:23:43,941 --> 00:23:45,693
Baldrick and I will always be

539
00:23:45,901 --> 00:23:47,069
more stupid than you.

540
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,320
Isn't that right, Baldrick?

541
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:50,030
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

542
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:52,366
Yeah... stupidy, stupidy, stupidy!

543
00:23:52,616 --> 00:23:53,701
The stupidest stupids

544
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:55,369
In the whole history of stupidityness!

545
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:03,794
Finished?

546
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:05,838
I think the obvious point is this...

547
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:07,381
We'll go straight back to the dugout

548
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:09,091
and do the painting from there.

549
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,759
You do the most imaginative,

550
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,012
most exciting possible drawing

551
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,097
Of German defences
from your imagination.

552
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:16,807
I say, now, that is a challenge.

553
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:20,060
Quite. Come on, let's get out of here.

554
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:21,937
Oh, sir, just one thing...

555
00:24:22,188 --> 00:24:23,981
If we should happen to tread on a mine,

556
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:26,775
what do we do?

557
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:29,069
Well, normal procedure, Lieutenant,

558
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,614
is to jump 200 feet into the air

559
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:36,827
and scatter yourself over a wide area.

560
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:40,706
Are you sure this is what you saw,
Blackadder?

561
00:24:40,956 --> 00:24:42,333
Absolutely.

562
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,126
There may have been
a few more armament factories

563
00:24:44,376 --> 00:24:46,879
and not quite as many elephants,

564
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:49,924
but that's generally it.

565
00:24:50,174 --> 00:24:52,801
Well, you know what this means.

566
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:55,721
If it's true, sir, we'll have to
cancel the push.

567
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:57,431
Exactly.

568
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,142
- Damn!
- What a nuisance.

569
00:25:00,392 --> 00:25:03,229
Exactly what the enemy
would expect us to do,

570
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:06,065
and therefore, exactly what we shan't do!

571
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,025
Ah. Now...

572
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:10,778
If we attack where the line is strongest,

573
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:12,488
then Fritz will think
that our reconnaissance

574
00:25:12,738 --> 00:25:13,948
is a total shambles.

575
00:25:14,156 --> 00:25:16,951
This will lull him into a sense
of false security,

576
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:18,786
and then next week we can attack

577
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:21,330
where the line is actually badly defended,

578
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,499
and win the greatest victory

579
00:25:23,707 --> 00:25:26,043
since the Winchester flower arranging team

580
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:30,756
beat Harrow by 12 sore bottoms to one!

581
00:25:31,006 --> 00:25:35,052
Tell me... have you ever
visited the planet Earth, sir?

582
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:38,806
So, best fighting trousers on, Blackadder!

583
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:40,349
Permission to shout "Bravo"

584
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:41,684
at an annoyingly loud volume, sir!

585
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:42,935
Permission granted.

586
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,019
Bravo!!!!

587
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,480
That's the spirit!

588
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,232
Just your kind of caper, eh, Blackadder?

589
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:49,441
Oh, yes.

590
00:25:49,692 --> 00:25:52,862
Good luck against those elephants.

591
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:56,699
Get me a chisel and some marble,

592
00:25:56,949 --> 00:25:57,616
will you, Baldrick?

593
00:25:57,867 --> 00:25:59,577
Taking up sculpture now, sir?

594
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:02,329
No, I thought I'd get my headstone done.

595
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,831
What are you gonna put on it?

596
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:05,958
<i>Here lies Edmund Blackadder,</i>

597
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:09,086
<i>and he's bloody annoyed.</i>

598
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:10,921
We're going over, are we, sir?

599
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,425
Yes, we are, unless I can think
of some brilliant plan.

600
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:18,012
Would you like some rat au vin
to help you think?

601
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:19,889
Rat au vin?

602
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:21,849
Yeah, it's rat, and it's been...

603
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:24,643
...run over by a van.

604
00:26:24,894 --> 00:26:26,562
No thank you, Baldrick.

605
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:30,024
Although it gives me an idea.

606
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:31,442
Telephone, please.

607
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:34,069
I suppose Blackadder and his boys

608
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:36,280
will have gone over the top by now, sir.

609
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,199
Yes. God, I wish I was out there with them,

610
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:40,701
dodging the bullets,
instead of having to sit here

611
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:41,952
drinking this Chateau Lafitte

612
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:46,499
and eating these fillet mignons
with sauce bernaise.

613
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:48,000
My thoughts exactly, sir.

614
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,085
<i>Damn this Chateau Lafitte.</i>

615
00:26:50,336 --> 00:26:52,588
He's a very brave man, Blackadder,

616
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:55,007
and of course that lieutenant
of his, George.

617
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:57,009
Cambridge man, you know.

618
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:01,847
His uncle Bertie and I
used to break wind for our college.

619
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:05,309
Slightly unusual taste,
this sauce bernaise.

620
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:09,563
Yes, and to be quite frank,
these mignons are...

621
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:11,148
are a little... well...

622
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:13,275
What?

623
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:14,902
Well, dungy.

624
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:16,987
What on earth's wrong with our cook?

625
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:19,990
Well, it's rather strange story, sir.

626
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:21,826
Oh? Tell, tell.

627
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:24,995
Well, sir, I received a phone call
this afternoon

628
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:29,208
from Pope Gregory IX
telling me that our cook

629
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:31,502
had been selected for
the England cricket team

630
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:34,171
and must set sail
for the West Indies immediately.

631
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,548
Really?

632
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:38,008
Barely a moment later,
the phone rang again.

633
00:27:38,217 --> 00:27:40,845
It was a trio of wandering Italian chefs

634
00:27:41,053 --> 00:27:43,973
who happened to be in the area
offering their services.

635
00:27:44,223 --> 00:27:46,308
So I had the quartermaster
take them on at once.

636
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,895
Oh? Jumping Jupiter!

637
00:27:50,145 --> 00:27:54,775
Are you sure these are real raisins
In this plum duff?

638
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:57,987
Oh yes, I'm sure they are, sir.

639
00:27:58,237 --> 00:27:59,989
Everything will be all right

640
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:03,409
once the cream custard arrives.

641
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:07,663
Jolly good fun, sir, but dash it all,

642
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:09,748
we appear to have missed the big push!

643
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:12,668
Oh, damn, so we have.

644
00:28:12,877 --> 00:28:15,379
One thing puzzles me, Baldrick...

645
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:17,965
How did you manage
to get so much custard

646
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:22,678
out of such a small cat?
