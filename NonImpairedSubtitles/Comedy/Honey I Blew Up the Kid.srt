1
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,400
- Good morning, folks. How you doing?
- Morning, Ozzie.
- Morning, Ozzie.

2
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:37,797
I hear he's some kind of inventor.

3
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:07,486
Nick, breakfast.

4
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:15,198
- Nick!
- I'm coming.

5
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:20,399
Your hands are
getting bigger now

6
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:23,479
Your arms and legs
are longer now

7
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:27,719
You even sense your insides
grow when Mom and Dad

8
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,118
- Wayne.
- Yeah, honey?

9
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,596
- Where's the baby?
- He's in the playpen.

10
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:37,839
- He gets out of the playpen.
- No, I fixed it.

11
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:42,239
Sweetheart, I hate to remind you, but
the last time you fixed the playpen...

12
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:44,283
he still got out of it.

13
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,165
Well, he won't get out this time.

14
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:50,319
Hiya.
Will you, big buddy, huh?

15
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:53,080
I'm certainly capable of fixing
a playpen, aren't I?

16
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,601
- You're just a little baby, after all.
- Your hat?

17
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:58,520
- It's my helmet.
- New one?
- Yeah, it's a new one.

18
00:04:58,607 --> 00:05:01,167
See, it shaves me.
See that?

19
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,442
There.

20
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:06,837
Amy, it's decided.
I'm going with you. Period.

21
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:09,999
Mom, in the first place, I'm not
the first girl who has ever gone
away to college.

22
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,885
- And in the second place, we're...
- Mom.
- Excuse me.

23
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:15,640
Amy, I'm gonna help you
get settled in. That's it.

24
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:18,446
- Want a noise? Noise?
- Yeah, yeah, I want to hear a noise.

25
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,483
- This one?
- Yeah. Now, this time...
- This one.

26
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,683
Okay.

27
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:28,323
- Hear it?
- Yep, I heard it.
- More?

28
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:29,840
Sure.

29
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:33,442
- Mom, let's say you were a girl.
- I think I can visualize it.

30
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,519
Would you think I was a nerd?
Just by looking at me, I mean.

31
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:39,838
It's a rhetorical question, Mom.
It doesn't require an answer.

32
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:43,078
- Am I any girl in particular?
- No.

33
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:47,445
Just a girl I might, I don't know,
ask to go to the movies or something.

34
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:51,440
Nicky, you are turning into
a very handsome young man.

35
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:54,405
- You're gonna be just like your dad.
- Honey...

36
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,923
can you help me adjust
this servo regulator?

37
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,001
Now, if you and Nicky want to get out
by yourselves while I'm gone...

38
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:07,682
the baby-sitter's number's
in the kitchen.

39
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,679
- What's with him?
- I think there's a girl.

40
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,883
Nick? Our Nick?

41
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:15,606
You know, he's growing up,
in case you haven't noticed.

42
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:25,160
Uh-oh.

43
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:29,717
- I'll fix it.
- I'll fix you, you little punk!
- Nick, stop!

44
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,639
- Adam, no.
- Sorry, Mama.

45
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,356
Yes, I should hope so.
Come on.

46
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:41,879
- Oh, man.
- You're getting to be a big boy.

47
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,958
How do you keep getting
out of there, anyway?

48
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:50,323
I think maybe we should forget
about the playpen idea.

49
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:53,922
I said I could fix it.
I'm not stupid.

50
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:57,357
I never said you were stupid.

51
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:01,204
Taxi's here.

52
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,998
So what's for breakfast?
Anything good?

53
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:12,284
Mmm, fantastic.

54
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,676
The taxi's gonna
take Mommy to the airport.

55
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,362
And then Mommy's gonna show Amy
her new room at school.

56
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:20,403
Hopefully they'll tire
him out at day care.

57
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:22,603
So when I get home,
he'll take a late nap.

58
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:24,166
- No nap!
- Honey...

59
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:28,035
- we don't say the "n" word
around two-year-olds.
- Adam.

60
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:32,166
- Coloured car.
- Okay, now, Adam's lunch
is in the freezer...

61
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:35,080
- Adam.
- And I put the baby-sitter's
number on the refrigerator.

62
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,443
- Is there something I'm forgetting?
I'm sure I'm forgetting some...
- Diane, Diane, relax.

63
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:42,042
Don't you think I can handle
things around here?

64
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,641
Of course you can, honey.

65
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,959
Break it up, guys.

66
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:51,402
Don't worry, Dad. She'll get there,
realize there's nothing to do...

67
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:53,557
turn around,
and come right back.

68
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,040
Bye.

69
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,406
- Bye, Nick.
- Come on, Amy. We gotta get going.

70
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:06,318
Oh. Don't forget to drop Nick and
Adam off on your way to work.

71
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:09,763
Gosh, the time. I got to get you
to work. I got a big test today.

72
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:12,407
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Mama.

73
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:18,606
Come on. Come on.

74
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,406
Come on. Come on.

75
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:25,202
You can do it.
Atta girl.

76
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:37,444
Szalinski test number 1277.

77
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:40,200
Crystal Group 5.

78
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,323
Shouldn't we wait
for Szalinski?

79
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:45,558
Maybe this will teach him
to be here on time.

80
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:48,844
Szalinski isn't running the show.
I am.

81
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:53,239
- This better work this time,
so concentrate.
- Ten seconds.

82
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:57,525
Nine, eight, seven, six, five...

83
00:08:57,607 --> 00:09:02,397
four, three, two, one, zero.

84
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:17,478
Here.

85
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:39,556
Sorry, everybody. There were some large
cumulonimbus clouds blocking the sun,
and l-I lost power.

86
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:43,435
And my son got a job for the summer...
Wet and Wild. I had to drop him off.

87
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:45,961
What's that stuff on your face?

88
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:51,283
- Oh, excuse me, Dr Hendrickson?
- I'm sick and tired of this!

89
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:56,077
Now, we have had some success
replicating Szalinski's experiments
shrinking matter.

90
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,362
But reversing the process,
enlarging matter...

91
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:01,678
has seen us run up
one blind alley after another.

92
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,123
Clifford Sterling demands results.

93
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:09,041
His board of directors demands results,
the United States government
demands results...

94
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:11,277
- and as project director, I...
- Excuse me, Dr Hendrickson.

95
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:15,599
I beg your pardon, Wayne.
As project co-director,
I intend to deliver results.

96
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:18,326
- L-I've been doing some work on my own
on the problem, sir.
- Yes, Wayne.

97
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:22,116
- I think you'll find
if you look at these calculations...
- Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

98
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:25,085
When you licensed your device
to Sterling Labs, you were promised...

99
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,477
that the finest minds in the country
would be working on it, and they are.

100
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:29,761
- I know that, sir.
- Good, good.

101
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:32,998
But l-I think if you look at these
notes, you'll find that although...

102
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:04,678
- Mandy?
- Yeah, Rick?

103
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:07,156
- Nick.
- Nick.

104
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:13,886
Hey, Nick, your dad's here
in his spaceship. The Dweezil Wheels.

105
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,003
Hey, Nicky!
Want a ride?

106
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:21,921
- Hey, look. It's the Nerdmobile.
- Hey, look at that.

107
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:23,918
- Oh, man.
- Have a nice flight.

108
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,800
- Thanks a lot, Dad.
- For what?

109
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:31,685
Nothing.

110
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:37,162
- Dad, were you ever popular in school?
- You bet.

111
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:40,159
I was president of the astronomy club
two years in a row.

112
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:43,239
We were happenin' guys.

113
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,363
So Mom tells me that
there's some girl?

114
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:47,358
What?

115
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:51,884
No. No, I was...
I was just wondering.

116
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:02,042
How was your flight?
Uh-huh. N-No, fine.

117
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:04,561
No, we just got home.
We're fixing dinner now.

118
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:11,562
What noise? Uh, it was just
a bad connection, that's all.

119
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:15,161
The baby?
Well, h-he's fine.

120
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:19,923
He's in the playpen.
No, I fixed it. He can't get out.

121
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,921
- Ice cream.
- How's Amy's dorm?

122
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:27,760
Uh-huh. Yeah.

123
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,883
Hey, stop it.

124
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:32,765
Nothing. Just the dog. Uh-huh.

125
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:34,803
No, everything's fine.

126
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,196
Boy, you worry too much.

127
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,478
What? The chicken?

128
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:43,718
Well, the chicken you left us
really looks fine, honey.

129
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:52,558
So I was thinking,
with Mom and Amy out of town...

130
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:56,037
that this would give us guys
a chance to, uh, talk about, uh...

131
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:58,163
you know, the birds and the bees.

132
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:06,958
Here, Nicky.

133
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:25,446
You know what I was thinking,
Big Bunny? What?

134
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:29,759
I was thinking we got to be nice to
our brother Nick. You know why? No, why?

135
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:34,363
Well, because he moved away to
a new place now, and he's got to make
all new friends, just like me and you.

136
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,926
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

137
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:37,838
- Shall we sing a song now?
- Yeah.

138
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:39,838
- What song shall we sing?
- "ABCs."

139
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:41,724
- How about "Twinkle, Twinkle"?
- "ABC."

140
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:43,718
- "ABC"?
- Yeah.

141
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,196
- Twinkle, twinkle...
- "ABCs"!

142
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:48,118
- Let's sing
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."
- "ABCs."

143
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:52,758
"ABCs"? Okay, first "ABCs."
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, H-l-J-K-L-M-N-O-P

144
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:54,963
Now "Twinkle, Twinkle," okay?

145
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,117
Okay.

146
00:13:57,207 --> 00:14:02,679
Twinkle, twinkle little star

147
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,803
How I won...

148
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:09,124
What you are

149
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:12,085
lt'll be a hell of a thing
for you, Charles, if it works.

150
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,965
It'll work.
I'll make it work.

151
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:19,757
Over the years, I've seen
Clifford Sterling attach himself
to one crazy idea after another.

152
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:24,159
I have to tell you,
the board of directors is very worried.

153
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:26,807
If you'll pardon me a moment.
Hendrickson.

154
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,720
Hello?

155
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:32,446
- What was that?
- It was a balloon popping,
Dr Hendrickson.

156
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:34,597
I got the idea while
singing my kid to sleep.

157
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:36,564
You see, if you hit a balloon
with too much force...

158
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:39,445
you don't allow the molecules time
to expand, and the balloon pops.

159
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:41,961
- Problem?
- No, Szalinski.

160
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,526
Oh, him.

161
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:48,318
Why Clifford insists on keeping
him involved is absolutely beyond me.

162
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:51,558
If I were running this project
by myself right now,
we'd be neck-deep in apples...

163
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,319
the size of Buicks.

164
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:55,682
There are those of us on
the board who would agree with you.

165
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,564
...fundamental integrity
of the atomic substructure...

166
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:01,356
Clifford Sterling just may have
outlived his usefulness...

167
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:05,565
to the corporation,
to its stockholders.

168
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:09,879
I should think his successor
would be a foregone conclusion...

169
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:14,006
especially if you're the one to
actually make this thing work.

170
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,476
...thereby allowing the
molecules time to expand...

171
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,637
without tearing the atomic fabric.

172
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:20,445
Hello?

173
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:22,324
Szalinsk... Szalinski...

174
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:25,046
why don't you write up this, uh,
balloon research of yours?

175
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:29,245
- I can do the math and have it
on your desk tomorrow.
- No, that's not necessary.

176
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:33,002
All right, have a good
weekend, Szalinski.

177
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:35,157
"Have a good weekend, Szalinski"?

178
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:42,082
- Hello?
- Hi, may I please speak to Mandy?

179
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,556
Sure.
Mandy, phone.

180
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:46,922
- Hello?
- Hi, Mandy?

181
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:55,758
I'll fix it.

182
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:59,280
- Daddy!
- Hey, what are you doing up, little guy?

183
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:05,243
- Hey, Nick, want to do
something with me tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.

184
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:08,797
Okay. Come on, fella.
One more story.

185
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:12,436
Then tomorrow, you want
to come with me and Nicky
down to the lab and we'll play?

186
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:19,083
Okay, guys.

187
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,078
See, Adam, this is
where Daddy works.

188
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,317
- Want me to take that?
- Yeah.

189
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:29,682
- Got to be a little bit
discreet about this.
- Huh?

190
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:33,316
- Mr Szalinski.
- Hi, Smitty.
- Hello. You working today?

191
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:36,399
Uh, just gonna tidy up a little bit.

192
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:44,438
- Wow.
- Wow.

193
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:46,882
- This is some lab.
- Some lab.

194
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:49,003
Way better than what we had
in the attic, huh?

195
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:51,681
- Way better.
- Way better.

196
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:55,686
Yes, would you connect me
with Dr Hendrickson, please?

197
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:05,356
Call up a command directory
labeled "primary laser drive."
Tell me what it says under "intensity."

198
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:13,446
- It says "access denied."
- Access denied?

199
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:20,957
Got to figure out some way how
to lower the intensity of the laser.

200
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:24,044
Hey, Dad.

201
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:28,084
We could diffuse it maybe.

202
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,444
That's a good idea.

203
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:43,156
- Now we'll set final target.
- Target what, Dad?

204
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:50,687
- Hey, can I borrow this, pal?
- No.

205
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:55,158
Come on. Let me see if I can make
Big Bunny really Big Bunny, huh?

206
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:05,756
Yes, sir. I thought it was unusual,
him being in here on a Saturday.

207
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:09,123
No, you did the right thing
letting me know. Thank you.

208
00:18:11,487 --> 00:18:13,318
Well, that's it for me.

209
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:16,717
Hey, you're gonna have
to wear some glasses.

210
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,638
There you go.

211
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:39,519
Thirty seconds.

212
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,642
Twenty-five seconds.

213
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:47,762
Twenty seconds.

214
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:53,396
19, 18, 17, 16...

215
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:56,285
15, 14, 13...

216
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:59,165
12, 11, 10...

217
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:03,399
9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

218
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:06,763
- Dang! Power surge!
- 3, 2, 1...

219
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,644
- Quick, the abort switches!
- Zero.

220
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:22,320
Unable to abort.

221
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,560
Joe, what's happening up here?

222
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:46,043
Uh, Mr Szalinski.
Uh, your security clearance...

223
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:48,163
denies you access
to the equipment...

224
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:50,203
without Dr Hendrickson's
permission.

225
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:52,926
- You are aware of that, right?
- Yeah, Smitty.

226
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,158
Uh, Mr Szalinski...

227
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:00,807
I'm sorry I had to, uh, uh...

228
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:06,801
That baby of yours.
Sure starting to get big.

229
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:08,366
See you, Smitty.

230
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:18,435
I'm bigger.
Bigger, bigger, bigger.

231
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:22,998
Dad, how come you got to ask
somebody's permission to work
on your own invention?

232
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:27,160
Well, Nick, Dad's a member
of a team now, and I'm working
with some real talented people.

233
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:31,160
But, Dad, it's your invention.
They didn't have the idea, you did.

234
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:58,963
Okay, bud. Looks like Daddy...

235
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:01,686
needs to spend a little quality time
with Nick, okay?

236
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:05,680
So I'm gonna get you a baby-sitter.
You're gonna have yourself a good time.

237
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,598
- Nick.
- Yeah.

238
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:15,480
You puttin' on
a little bit of weight?

239
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:26,918
I'm big.

240
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:32,440
You know what? Daddy's gonna
make you a nice quick lunch.

241
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:34,836
Maybe kind of
a low-cal thing.

242
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,395
What do you think, huh?
It's gonna be good.

243
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:41,082
Okay, you know what?
Sit down and hang onto him.

244
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,362
This guy's gonna keep you company,
and I'm gonna make...

245
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:45,403
Uh, baby-sitter,
baby-sitter, baby-sitter.

246
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:51,279
555-5654.

247
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:56,405
Okay, so lunches.
Whoa. How about that, huh?

248
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,842
- Yeah?
- Hi, is this Mandy Park?
- Yeah.

249
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:03,363
Uh, hi, this is, uh, Wayne Szalinski.
Can you come over about 3:30 for us?

250
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,086
Uh, 3:30?
Sounds okay, Mr Schlitzminski.

251
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:10,206
- Uh, Szalinski, dear.
- Szalinski, right. That's what I said.

252
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,597
I, like, charge $2.50 an hour.
Unless, of course,
I actually have to do anything...

253
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:17,441
like change diapers
or clean up or something,
in which case, the price goes up.

254
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:20,121
Oh, no. All you have to do
is just-just watch him, really.

255
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:22,198
- Okay, see yOu at 3:30.
- Okay.

256
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:26,200
Okay.

257
00:22:27,287 --> 00:22:29,721
Okay. Are these Quark's
or yours?

258
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:34,243
You just stay here, okay?

259
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:37,478
- She sounded great on the phone.
- I want to go to a restaurant.

260
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:40,206
You want to go to a restaurant?
But I just made this stuff.
It's gonna be good.

261
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:43,279
I want to go eat in restaurant.

262
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:47,599
Well, um, I'll be the waiter, okay?
And, uh, let me take your order.

263
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:49,598
- What would you like?
- I want the duck.

264
00:22:49,687 --> 00:22:53,805
Duck. The duck...
The duck is not very good tonight.
Uh, can I recommend the special?

265
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:57,004
- Okay.
- Okay, fine. We have soup du jour.

266
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:59,555
We have hamburger.
We have French fries today.

267
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:02,400
- Would you like 'em?
- Okay.
- All right.

268
00:23:02,487 --> 00:23:04,318
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

269
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:31,281
Hey, Nick, want to go to a movie?
Just the two of us.

270
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:33,597
Yeah, there's a movie at the Desert Six
I wanted to see.

271
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:36,565
Great. Come on.
It'll take our minds off everything.

272
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:40,765
- I'll check show times.
- Okay, and then maybe afterwards,
we can get a bite to eat or something.

273
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:44,365
Big, Big Bunny.

274
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:54,804
What's that?

275
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,998
What's gotten into him?

276
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:11,527
- Dad, how?
- Where were you in the lab this morning?
Were you watching Adam?

277
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:14,565
- He was off to the side.
- But at the moment of discharge,
where was he?

278
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:18,322
Just before, I know,
he was off to the side. Wasn't he?

279
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:20,762
Somehow, I don't think so.

280
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:30,886
Boo.

281
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:43,605
Don't worry, Adam.
Daddy's going to make everything okay.

282
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:52,883
Okay, we got to get him back to the lab,
analyse the data
and reverse the process.

283
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:54,400
- One thing, Dad.
- What?

284
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:58,560
Do you think the security guard might
get suspicious with us walking in
with a seven-foot baby?

285
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:00,319
Good point.

286
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:30,561
This will cover your head and your hair.
Here, Adam, put this on.

287
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:36,279
There. He looks like
a badly dressed beekeeper.

288
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:40,565
All right. Okay.
Now just act natural.

289
00:25:40,647 --> 00:25:43,036
Come on, bud.
Atta boy.

290
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:49,717
Smitty! Smitty! Um, I forgot the,
um, the keys, uh, to my van,
and I couldn't-couldn't start the van.

291
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:52,526
It's in the lab.
It's in the lab, but I'm not going
to use anything in there...

292
00:25:52,607 --> 00:25:55,917
because of my security, you know,
access... a-access thing,
which you mentioned earlier.

293
00:25:56,007 --> 00:25:57,838
So I'm just gonna get
the keys in the lab now.

294
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,598
Adam.

295
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:08,283
Come on, down.

296
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:14,040
- Szalinski.
- Go back up.

297
00:26:14,127 --> 00:26:16,357
Just stopped by to do
some, uh, computations...

298
00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:18,961
in the... in the database.

299
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:23,438
- The database has been erased.
Our entire experiment, gone.
- Get back! Back!

300
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:25,961
- Erased?
- All 38 gigabytes.
- It can't be.

301
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:29,437
Sure it can, if the main controller was
trying to compensate laser intensity...

302
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:32,121
for this, which you jammed
into the filter pack, you idiot...

303
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:35,802
causing a power surge
through the entire main drive system.

304
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:39,402
- Who was that?
- Who?

305
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:42,160
- The guy in the hat.
- Uh, a-a friend of mine.

306
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:44,602
- Well, what language was he speaking?
- Yugoslavian.

307
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:48,680
- You let a foreigner into the lab.
- He's not a foreigner. He's my wife's
Uncle Yanosh from Yugoslavia.

308
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:51,884
He's family, and he just wanted to see
the lab, and I... and I brought him here.

309
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,923
The man's a genius.
Did you see the size of his head?

310
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:57,522
- 225, the IQ on that man.
An extended brainpan.
- Extended brainpan?

311
00:26:57,607 --> 00:27:00,201
- Bafroom.
- No bathroom right now, Adam.

312
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,120
- Did he say "bathroom"?
- Bafoon. Bafoon. Yugoslavian.

313
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:05,038
It's a term of, uh, of appreciation.

314
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:08,437
"Bafoon: Thank you for bringing me down
here on a Saturday to the lab...

315
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:11,041
to look around,"
that's all.

316
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:14,324
- How long before we can restore
the system from the backups?
- Well, that doesn't concern you.

317
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:16,921
You're off the project.

318
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:19,441
- You don't have the authority
to make that decision.
- Well, maybe I don't.

319
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:22,166
So why don't you call Clifford Sterling
personally and plead your case.

320
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:25,842
However, after this morning's little
escapade, and the time and money
it'll cost Sterling Labs...

321
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:27,963
I don't think the old man
will have a great deal of sympathy.

322
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:32,757
So I hope you'll spare yourself
the embarrassment of having
to be escorted to the gate.

323
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:41,482
Start working data restoration backwards
from 8:56 this morning...

324
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:43,956
to the exact time
the system crashed.

325
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:46,925
I want to know
what he was up to.

326
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:56,362
Why didn't you tell 'em, Dad?
I mean, at least then...

327
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:59,564
they'd know that you were able to
make it work when nobody else could.

328
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:03,117
Look, Nick. Remember we made you kids
promise never, ever to tell anyone...

329
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:05,846
- you were accidentally shrunk
and lost for two days?
- Yeah.

330
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:09,681
That's because we didn't want
you guys to become specimens,
to undergo countless tests...

331
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:13,885
to go through endless observations
and who knows what else.

332
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:17,960
What about Adam?
What are we going to do?

333
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:22,165
I don't know.
What I do know is...

334
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:26,445
we got to figure some way to fix this
before your mother gets home.

335
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:33,879
Hi, guys.
I'm home.

336
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,241
Where'd this come from?

337
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:50,201
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

338
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:52,755
We could drive to Mexico,
Dad, and hide out.

339
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:55,805
Come back when he's bigger.
I mean, older.

340
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:59,641
- Maybe she wouldn't notice then.
- No.

341
00:28:59,727 --> 00:29:01,718
Honesty's the best policy, Nick.

342
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:05,083
I'll just explain.

343
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:09,126
Sure. It's not the first time
something like this has happened...

344
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:11,675
to our family.

345
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:15,157
- I'll just tell the truth.
- Then beg for mercy.

346
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:16,999
Coloured car.

347
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:32,204
- What was that all about?
- Um, I had a little trouble
with the van.

348
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:35,962
L-l-I thought I put it in, uh, in-in
park, and it went into reverse...

349
00:29:36,047 --> 00:29:38,117
'cause the "P" and the...
and the "R" look...

350
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:43,201
- You're back early.
- Yeah, l-I took a cab from the airport.
You know, it really was silly.

351
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:48,315
- Amy didn't need me at all.
Who's the man in the loud sport coat?
- Stop. No. No, those are Nick's.

352
00:29:48,407 --> 00:29:51,205
Well, Diane, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about. Now, the-the...

353
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:53,960
- Sit down.
- Mom.
- Sit down!

354
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:57,198
You know how sometimes
the-the things that I invent...

355
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:59,642
don't always work
the way they're supposed to?

356
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:04,243
Sweetheart, you can tell me.
How bad can it be?

357
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:07,797
After all, it's not like you did
something to one of the kids again.

358
00:30:10,327 --> 00:30:13,160
- Wayne, where is Adam?
- Well, uh...

359
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:17,718
Who is that man in the van?
And where did this bunny come from?

360
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:20,765
- All right, I confess. I did it.
- Did what?

361
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:22,758
Peekaboo.

362
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:26,203
I blew up the baby.

363
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:31,716
Mama fall down.
Mama?

364
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:34,837
- How'd she take it?
- About like usual.

365
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:37,122
Mama sleeping?

366
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:40,756
- I'll kill Wayne.
- You don't want to kill Wayne.

367
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:42,997
I want to kill Wayne.

368
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:46,079
- What's he doing?
- He's playing with his toys.

369
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,964
Well, make him stop.

370
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:51,924
"Make him stop."

371
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:56,366
Why didn't I think of that?

372
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:58,278
Adam.

373
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,835
Adam, stop fooling around!

374
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,963
- Catch.
- Adam.

375
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:06,357
- That was a real rocket.
- Let's go for a walk, Adam.

376
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,915
- Play ball, Nick.
- Don't throw things at Nick!

377
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:11,567
- Catch it.
- This is your last warning.

378
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:16,045
Okay, I'll give you
one more warning.

379
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:26,964
Honey, shh, shh.
It's not as bad as it seems.

380
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:30,244
It almost couldn't be,
could it?

381
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:32,477
Well, I finally
got him in his room.

382
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:36,685
Tell him to stay inside,
and close the door.

383
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,837
I did close the door.

384
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:43,006
He just opened his door.

385
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:48,285
- And he decided to share it with us.
- I break off.
- Oh, baby.

386
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,676
Adam, put the door down,
sweetheart.

387
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:53,076
Why don't you give
the door to Daddy, Adam?

388
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:56,045
- Give Daddy the door, Adam.
- I fix it, I fix it.

389
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:59,039
Wait till the Vista Del Mar
Standards Committee sees this.

390
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,880
Maybe we shouldn't bother with it.
It's just a mailbox.

391
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:06,765
Little things have a way of
becoming very big things, Patty.

392
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:10,047
- Let go of the door, Adam.
- No, my door.

393
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,004
- Stop before someone gets hurt.
- Let go!

394
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,398
I fix it!

395
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:28,116
Don't fix it, Adam.
Just put down Mommy's coffee table.

396
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:31,483
- Be careful, baby.
- Slow down, Adam. Ad-Ad-Adam.

397
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:36,046
- Not my antique chair!
- Gentle. Gentle.

398
00:32:36,127 --> 00:32:39,563
- They remodelling in there?
- Come back. Come back here.

399
00:32:39,647 --> 00:32:43,117
Adam. Adam!

400
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:46,517
- Adam, sit down. Sit down, Adam.
- He's on this side.

401
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:49,599
- He's yours.
- Oh, Adam.
- This is not a game.

402
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:52,565
- What do we do when we catch him?
- Adam, Adam, hang on.

403
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:55,957
Okay, wait. Okay.
You guys go that way. I'll go this way.

404
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:01,723
Hi, little guy.

405
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:05,197
Adam, put Daddy down!
Adam, put Daddy down!

406
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:10,196
- Guitar.
- Not my room!

407
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:14,439
Adam. Adam, put down my guitar.
Put it down.

408
00:33:14,527 --> 00:33:16,358
- Get back here.
- Come on.
- Get back.

409
00:33:16,447 --> 00:33:18,642
- All right, now.
That's enough, fellas. Stop.
- Adam, sweetheart.

410
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:21,605
- He's got my guitar!
- Nicky, he's just a baby.

411
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:24,201
He's not a baby.
He's a monster.

412
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,923
He's gonna break my guitar!

413
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:32,639
- Come back here. Come back here!
- Come back, Adam.
Give me back my guitar!

414
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:34,638
Give it back, you brat!

415
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,878
Other way.

416
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:40,925
- Guitar all gone.
- Got it. Here, hide it.

417
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:48,597
He targeted something.
But it's gonna take a lot more enhancing
to figure out what.

418
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:50,723
I can do it.

419
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:53,605
- What do you suppose this is here?
- Condensation on the lens?

420
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:56,247
- No, no, it's much too solid.
- How can you be sure?

421
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:59,524
I'm sure. It's not amorphous.
It's a mass. I can see.

422
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:03,761
Play in here with Daddy.

423
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:05,917
- Play what?
- Play anything.

424
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:10,046
- This should distract him.
- Great!
- That's what it's all about

425
00:34:10,127 --> 00:34:13,164
You put your right foot in
You put your right foot out

426
00:34:13,247 --> 00:34:16,762
You put your right foot in
and you shake it all about

427
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,805
- You do the Hokey Pokey
and you turn yourself around
- Yeah!

428
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:22,481
- Dance, Adam.
- That's what it's all about

429
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:25,525
- Good. This foot, Adam.
- You do the Hokey Pokey

430
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,997
- Isn't this fun, Wayne?
- That's what it's all about
- Clap your hands. Clap your hands.

431
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:32,159
- You put your left foot in
- Put your left foot in. Good boy, Adam.
- You put your left foot out

432
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:35,956
- You put your left foot in
and you shake it all about
- Why are you closing the shutters?

433
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:39,642
So one of the neighbours doesn't
look in, see a seven-foot baby
and call the National Inquirer.

434
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:42,878
- That's what it's all about
- Doorbell.
- Who's that?

435
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:46,084
- One of the neighbours.
- So far, your plan's working perfectly.

436
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:50,476
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hello.

437
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,842
We heard shouting
and a lot of noise...

438
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:55,805
so we were just wondering
if everything was all right.

439
00:34:55,887 --> 00:35:00,244
Oh, yes, everything's fine.
We were just entertaining.

440
00:35:00,327 --> 00:35:03,000
- Uncle Yanosh.
- Uncle Yanersh.

441
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:05,078
You put your whole self in
You put your whole self out

442
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:07,283
Not too hard.
You're denting the floor.

443
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:10,006
- Bye.
- Dad, help me. He's got me.

444
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:13,523
He's breaking my ribs.
Oh, don't do that, Adam.

445
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:18,198
My God, it appears
to have three eyes.

446
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:20,403
A new life-form of some sort?

447
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:22,443
Try scaling up the window.

448
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:28,077
- This could be big.
- This could be very big.

449
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:35,877
Well, I think you did a great job with
these. This should really distract him.

450
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,606
- Well, he likes noise.
- Here you go, honey.

451
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:42,805
Yeah. You know what, Nicky?
I don't care what you say.

452
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:46,482
It's still a playpen,
and a playpen's a playpen to Adam.

453
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:51,482
Yeah, but you have to admit, Mom,
not many guys could come up with
something like this in half an hour.

454
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:54,598
- Cuckoo.
- No. No. Adam.

455
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:56,882
Sweetheart, no, no, no.
Stay away from that, sweetheart.

456
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:58,878
Adam, please,
please don't touch that.

457
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:01,481
Adam, no, don't touch
Mommy's cuckoo.

458
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:06,038
Come on away from there, Adam.
Come over here and play with Nicky.

459
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:08,561
Play with Nicky, Adam.

460
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:11,878
When you get a minute,
you might take a look at this.

461
00:36:13,727 --> 00:36:15,080
Wayne?

462
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:18,284
Well, some of the numbers indicate
that on an atomic...

463
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:22,645
- Please, honey, the truth, okay?
- The truth, Diane, is that...

464
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:26,845
without the access to the data
at the plant, I don't know
that there's anything I can do.

465
00:36:26,927 --> 00:36:30,556
I know what's happening,
but I don't know why.

466
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:34,560
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Hey, Mom, look.
I finally found a way to keep him quiet.

467
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:38,401
There were 12
ice cream bars in there.

468
00:36:40,127 --> 00:36:43,403
- Well, he's ruined his dinner.
- Not necessarily, Mom.

469
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:46,957
At his body weight,
he should be able to metabolize...

470
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:49,800
Maybe I should just shut up about it.

471
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:55,882
Okay, boys, we're going out.

472
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,322
- Diane, what are you doing?
- I'm taking him to the lab.

473
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:00,477
Maybe there's somebody there who...

474
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:02,876
Who knows what they're doing?

475
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:06,926
I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry,
but all I care about right now...

476
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:09,646
is getting my baby
to shrink back to normal size.

477
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,321
- Come on, Nicky.
Help me get him out to the van.
- Shrink?

478
00:37:12,407 --> 00:37:16,923
Diane, wait! I got an idea.
My original machine...
it's in the lab security warehouse.

479
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:18,565
Yes!

480
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:20,717
This'll have to be
a covert operation.

481
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:23,924
Diane, you come with me.
Nick, you stay with the baby.

482
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:27,716
- Oh, no.
We are not leaving them here alone.
- Diane, you can't take him to the lab.

483
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:31,117
There's no telling what Hendrickson
will do if he gets his hands on him.
Look at him.

484
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,085
He's exhausted.
He can take a nap while we're gone.

485
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,397
No nap!

486
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:42,517
Look who I got:
Really Big Bunny.

487
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:47,087
Hi, Adam.
Hello, Adam.

488
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,044
You're real tired,
aren't you, Adam?

489
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:51,766
Yeah, he looks real tired to me.

490
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:54,759
Should we sing the song?

491
00:37:54,847 --> 00:37:58,726
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

492
00:37:58,807 --> 00:38:02,925
How I wonder what you are

493
00:38:03,007 --> 00:38:07,159
Up above the world so high

494
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:10,842
Like a diamond in the sky

495
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:15,318
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

496
00:38:15,407 --> 00:38:17,398
- How I won...
- Mine!

497
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:21,366
- Let go!
- Gimme!
- Adam Szalinski, you let go
of that bunny right now!

498
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:24,723
Put Daddy down, Adam.
It's not nice to hurt Daddy.

499
00:38:24,807 --> 00:38:26,399
Sorry, Mama.

500
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:29,206
Okay, I'm bringing up
the structural overlay.

501
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:34,123
Dr Hendrickson, we can make out hair,
bone and metal, all sort of intertwined.

502
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:37,483
I think you should take
a look at this. Yes, sir.

503
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:40,525
- He's on his way.
- We'll show him
the keratin analysis first.

504
00:38:40,607 --> 00:38:42,882
- Structural overlay first.
- It's not clear enough.

505
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:46,801
- I think it is.
- Why don't we see what he thinks?

506
00:38:55,447 --> 00:38:57,881
Don't worry.
We'll be back in an hour. Come on.

507
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,764
Bye-bye.

508
00:39:59,207 --> 00:40:02,597
This is our latest image, superimposing
structural and keratin analysis.

509
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:06,600
- And as you can see, there appears to...
- All right. Just move over.

510
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:10,283
It's a baby and a stuffed bunny.

511
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,917
Szalinski.

512
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:18,044
I'm gonna pay him
a little visit.

513
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:22,996
- Back to work.
- I knew it was a baby.
I just wasn't sure it was a bunny.

514
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:47,644
This'll just take a second. They stored
all my stuff in one large crate.

515
00:40:47,727 --> 00:40:50,525
- It should be easy to spot.
- Oh, Wayne?

516
00:40:55,727 --> 00:40:59,800
- Maybe it's in
alphabetical order or something.
- What if it's not?

517
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:03,277
All I wanted to do was
take Nick to the movies. Uh-oh.

518
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:05,005
What?

519
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:26,886
Doorbell.

520
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:36,037
Twinkle, twinkle lit...

521
00:41:38,727 --> 00:41:40,638
- Bunny.
- Wait here.

522
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:54,595
- Mandy.
- Rick.

523
00:41:55,567 --> 00:41:59,242
- Nick. Nick Szalinski.
- Right.

524
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:03,400
- I'm here to baby-sit.
- We don't need a baby-sitter.

525
00:42:06,287 --> 00:42:08,039
Adam, no!

526
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:13,164
Very funny. Now can I come in?
I'm already charging you.

527
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:16,922
We changed our mind, that's all.
We don't need a baby-sitter.

528
00:42:17,007 --> 00:42:21,205
I don't think so. Look, I was promised
three hours at $2.50 an hour.

529
00:42:21,287 --> 00:42:23,960
- Plus the extra if I'm grossed out.
- Uh, listen, Mandy.

530
00:42:24,047 --> 00:42:27,084
Take it from me. You don't want
to baby-sit. Not this baby.

531
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:29,442
I'm really sure I can
handle some stupid baby.

532
00:42:45,047 --> 00:42:49,802
Wayne, we've gotta get back to the kids.
This is just taking too long.

533
00:42:57,647 --> 00:42:59,877
Honey, it's up here!

534
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,117
See if you can find
a forklift.

535
00:43:04,527 --> 00:43:08,156
Mandy, believe me,
I have everything under control.

536
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:11,922
Now, if you promise not to scream,
I'll take the gag out of your mouth.

537
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,838
Promise?

538
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:21,597
- Help me! Someone help me!
- Mandy! Mandy, no!
- Please, somebody help me! Giant baby!

539
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:23,518
You're scaring him.
Stop.

540
00:43:23,607 --> 00:43:25,643
- Mandy, stop. Calm down.
- Help me!

541
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:28,599
What's that?

542
00:43:28,687 --> 00:43:31,838
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Giant baby! Help!

543
00:43:31,927 --> 00:43:33,724
- The Slitzitskis.
- Giant baby!

544
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:40,566
Wayne, this is a solar van.
We're inside.

545
00:43:40,647 --> 00:43:43,445
There's a switch, honey, marked
"batteries."Just be careful
not to switch it to...

546
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:47,642
high.

547
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:54,165
No! No!

548
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,318
Hold on!

549
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:07,198
Can we try again?

550
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:15,924
Good.
Now, despite what he looks like...

551
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:17,963
Adam is just a little kid.

552
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,880
He's-He's in there watching TV,
not hurting anyone.

553
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:24,357
Summertime.
The active woman.

554
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,036
She knows what it is
to have a headache.

555
00:44:28,127 --> 00:44:31,802
Everybody's doin'
a brand new dance now

556
00:44:31,887 --> 00:44:35,038
- Come on, baby, do the locomotion.
- Let's welcome 'em.

557
00:44:35,127 --> 00:44:38,483
I know you'll get to like it
if you give it a chance now

558
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:42,606
Come on baby
Do the locomotion

559
00:44:42,687 --> 00:44:44,166
Sorry.

560
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:48,838
...learn than your ABCs

561
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:53,284
So come on, come on and do
the locomotion with me

562
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:56,518
So, two years ago, he made
you and your sister tiny.

563
00:44:56,607 --> 00:45:00,156
- And the guys next door.
- Then he made you regular size again.

564
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:03,319
- And now he's made
your baby brother big.
- Right.

565
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,564
And you don't, like, think
that's unusual.

566
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:17,846
Oh, my God.
He's out and he's bigger.

567
00:45:19,087 --> 00:45:21,885
- You got to help me, okay?
- This wasn't in the job description.

568
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:24,925
- We'll pay you overtime.
- Okay.

569
00:45:28,487 --> 00:45:31,001
There's no way I'm changing
those diapers.

570
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:32,918
Come on.

571
00:45:33,007 --> 00:45:37,717
- Adam! Adam!
- Adam! Adam!

572
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:44,636
Adam, where are you?
Come on!

573
00:45:44,727 --> 00:45:46,558
Julia, be quiet and sit down.

574
00:45:46,647 --> 00:45:50,196
Now, for the famous
Chinese blocks trick.

575
00:45:50,287 --> 00:45:52,278
Shazam.

576
00:45:55,247 --> 00:45:58,398
Okay.
Now for my next trick.

577
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:02,245
Adam!

578
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,678
Now for the disappearing
bunny trick.

579
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:10,555
Watch carefully.
The hand is quicker than the eye.

580
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:14,640
Shazam. Can anyone tell me
where the bunny is?

581
00:46:14,727 --> 00:46:17,639
- There!
- You think it's still on my head?

582
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:22,644
Big Bunny.

583
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,965
Bye.

584
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:40,966
- There he is! Come on!
- I don't care if Clifford's
at the Rand Institute this weekend.
I want him notified.

585
00:46:41,047 --> 00:46:44,881
I also want the board of directors
in on this. Hey, what the...

586
00:46:47,727 --> 00:46:51,402
Contact the federal marshals.
Get 'em out here. I want something
large enough to hold...

587
00:46:51,487 --> 00:46:53,762
to hold something large.

588
00:46:58,647 --> 00:47:01,525
Big Bunny.
Big, Big, Big bunny.

589
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:03,484
In big trouble.

590
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:07,765
- Wait. You hold it right there.
- Hey!

591
00:47:07,847 --> 00:47:09,883
I'm just the baby-sitter.

592
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:23,927
Yeah, an hour tops. Sure.

593
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,760
- Wayne, how's it coming?
- Just about got it, honey.

594
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,917
Hold on. I'm taking a short cut.

595
00:47:45,807 --> 00:47:47,559
What do I do?

596
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:52,005
Okay, let's see
if this thing works.

597
00:48:02,407 --> 00:48:05,399
Wayne Szalinski, you unshrink
those policemen right now.

598
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:26,402
It works!

599
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:35,446
- They're getting away.
- I think they're out
of our jurisdiction.

600
00:48:40,927 --> 00:48:42,326
Hold it.
You can't go in.

601
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:44,875
It's okay, Officer.
That's our house.

602
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:54,156
Excuse me.

603
00:48:54,247 --> 00:48:57,319
- Where are my boys? Where are they?
- Hold on, folks. Hold it.
Hold it just a minute.

604
00:48:57,407 --> 00:49:01,844
Preston Brooks, US Marshals.
Now, we found this guy down the street
hiding in a garage.

605
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:06,478
The children are perfectly safe,
Mrs Szalinski. We just needed
to get the baby some more room
so he wouldn't hurt himself.

606
00:49:06,567 --> 00:49:08,876
Of course, the mutated child
will have to undergo immediate testing.

607
00:49:08,967 --> 00:49:12,084
That's my kid you're talking about!
Let go of me!

608
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:15,159
- Hold on, Mr Szalinski.
- Let go of me!

609
00:49:21,607 --> 00:49:23,916
You can't keep him
in that truck.

610
00:49:24,007 --> 00:49:26,282
Don't worry.
It's all fixed up.

611
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:28,676
As far as your brother's concerned,
it's one big playpen.

612
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:31,440
- That's what I mean.
- I'd listen to him if I were you.

613
00:49:31,527 --> 00:49:34,803
Look, Miss. When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

614
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,845
Mama, help.

615
00:49:38,927 --> 00:49:40,758
Out! Out!

616
00:49:48,247 --> 00:49:51,717
He's got a 40-inch neck.

617
00:49:51,807 --> 00:49:55,038
- Adam's going to be fine, Quark.
- The parents are here.

618
00:49:55,127 --> 00:49:58,756
We'll bring them to meet
the child when he's secure.

619
00:49:58,847 --> 00:50:02,044
- I can authorize that!
- Marshal Brooks?

620
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:04,516
I'm afraid I have to insist
that these two be taken into custody.

621
00:50:04,607 --> 00:50:07,963
- On what charge?
- Theft. Malicious mischief.

622
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,685
Child endangerment.

623
00:50:15,727 --> 00:50:18,036
If you'll excuse me.

624
00:50:21,047 --> 00:50:25,086
Clifford.
Well, I hardly know what to say.

625
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,761
I tried to warn you about Szalinski
from the very beginning.

626
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:29,917
Yes. Yes, you did, Charles.

627
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:33,522
If it's any consolation to you,
the board of directors believed
that you were right all along.

628
00:50:33,607 --> 00:50:38,806
Dr Sterling. Dr Sterling, sir.
I can reverse my son's growth.
Just give me a chance, sir.
I can get him back to normal.

629
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:42,084
- You can?
- Yeah, with what, Szalinski?
Coca-Cola bottles?

630
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:44,965
Hmm? Maybe some, what,
chewing gum and twine?

631
00:50:45,047 --> 00:50:48,596
- Just who do you think you are,
talking to him like that?
- Diane, let me handle this.

632
00:50:48,687 --> 00:50:51,247
- Who do you think you are,
talking to me like that?
- Clifford...

633
00:50:51,327 --> 00:50:53,443
the situation demands
that I bring in the people...

634
00:50:53,527 --> 00:50:56,485
with the expertise
and the credentials.

635
00:50:56,567 --> 00:50:59,684
Wait a second. You think I'm just
some guy from Fresno...

636
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:02,600
who tinkered with crackpot
ideas in his attic?

637
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:04,598
Well, let me tell you something.

638
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:07,076
This whole country is built on
the shoulders of people who tinkered...

639
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:10,603
with crackpot ideas in attics
and basements and backyards.

640
00:51:10,687 --> 00:51:14,646
- Alexander Graham Bell
working in a two-room flat.
- Young man, don't presume...

641
00:51:14,727 --> 00:51:17,116
to stand there and lecture me
about great minds...

642
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,004
and great inventors.

643
00:51:19,087 --> 00:51:21,920
Whatever I've been over the years,
I've never been a fool...

644
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:24,567
or been involved
with anyone else who is.

645
00:51:24,647 --> 00:51:27,320
I certainly don't intend
to start now.

646
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:30,840
- Charles?
- Yes, Clifford?
- You're fired.

647
00:51:30,927 --> 00:51:33,999
- What?
- You're fired.

648
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:39,604
So Szalinski, what have you got in mind,
so we can get that kid of yours...

649
00:51:39,687 --> 00:51:41,279
back to normal size by bedtime?

650
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:45,155
- Well, sir, the prototype's in the van...
- Hold on, folks. We've got a problem.

651
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:48,284
Your son's escaped,
and he's over 50 feet tall.

652
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:51,200
That's impossible.
My son's only 14 feet tall.

653
00:51:51,287 --> 00:51:53,198
- I'll drive.
- That's still pretty tall.

654
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:59,440
Yes, get me Terence Wheeler.
This is an emergency.

655
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:04,116
- He broke out?
- He busted out of the truck
and knocked it completely over.

656
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:07,119
- What's he doing now?
- He's just standing there.
But he's smiling.

657
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,517
- Now, Adam, sit down.
- Nick, I don't think sitting's
such a good idea.

658
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:12,404
Ooh, toys.

659
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:18,278
- He did what?
- Put your son and the baby-sitter
in his pocket and left.

660
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:20,483
He's always doing that. I find
the strangest things in his pockets.

661
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:24,606
- Wayne, what do you suppose
is causing this growth phenomenon?
- I don't know.

662
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:27,679
They were transporting him
along Copper Mine Road.

663
00:52:27,767 --> 00:52:30,327
- That runs alongside high-voltage lines.
- Oh.

664
00:52:30,407 --> 00:52:32,796
And yesterday when I gave him lunch,
he was right near the microwave oven.

665
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:36,118
- And you said the baby grew
while he was watching TV.
- Of course!

666
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:40,041
- I don't understand any of this.
- Electromagnetic flux.

667
00:52:40,127 --> 00:52:43,244
Around every operating
electrical device, there's a flux.

668
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:47,115
- Like an electromagnetic force field.
- That's what's causing the baby to grow.

669
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:51,564
Would this electromagnetic, uh...
Would it surround neon lights too?

670
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:55,765
- Yeah, why?
- Your kid. He's headed toward Las Vegas.

671
00:52:56,807 --> 00:52:58,843
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

672
00:53:02,727 --> 00:53:05,400
You are not fired,
not by a long shot.

673
00:53:05,487 --> 00:53:10,038
This is the opportunity
I've been waiting for. At last!
Sterling has gone too far this time.

674
00:53:13,287 --> 00:53:17,075
The board is getting together tonight.
Until then, I want you on this.

675
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:19,681
Whatever it takes, just get
the situation under control.

676
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:22,804
Yeah, I did have one thought, sir,
but I'll need military cooperation.

677
00:53:22,887 --> 00:53:25,924
Fine. I'll get the clearance. Charles,
Just-Just-Just handle this for us.

678
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:28,885
We'll... We'll do
the right thing by you.

679
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:48,681
Police reports just in say that
some kind of large creature...

680
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:52,760
has just escaped from a government
caravan and is heading toward the city.

681
00:53:58,127 --> 00:54:01,722
Mrs Szalinski, if he heads for
the lights, he has to come this way.

682
00:54:01,807 --> 00:54:05,766
- According to my calculations,
he's gotta hold still for 12.2 seconds.
- What?

683
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:08,077
His increased mass requires
a longer period of exposure.

684
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:12,445
How do you expect
to get a two-year-old to hold
still for 12 point anything seconds?

685
00:54:12,527 --> 00:54:16,156
She's right, Doctor,
we tried to have his picture
taken a month ago. Total bust.

686
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:19,683
We're just pulling up now, Dan.
There are a lot of police cars gathered.

687
00:54:19,767 --> 00:54:23,680
- We'll find out what's going on.
- Call the paramedics now!

688
00:54:23,767 --> 00:54:26,406
All right, here's a shot.
Okay.

689
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:29,320
This is Constance Winters
reporting live from the site...

690
00:54:29,407 --> 00:54:33,241
of what will certainly become the
most important news story of the decade.

691
00:54:33,327 --> 00:54:36,842
Dan, I'm seeing a giant.

692
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:43,678
Oh, my God.

693
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:52,565
Oh, Adam.

694
00:54:52,647 --> 00:54:57,004
- Well, honey, he looks okay.
- Let me see.

695
00:54:57,087 --> 00:55:01,603
Do you think this is gonna
affect him for life? I mean,
something like this could ruin a kid.

696
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:05,965
Honey, it might give him
a different perspective,
help him see the big picture.

697
00:55:06,047 --> 00:55:09,756
Baby.
There they are!

698
00:55:09,847 --> 00:55:12,964
- Let's move into position!
- I'm with you, pal!

699
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:34,237
- Help!
- Get us down from here!
- Get us down!

700
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:37,080
- We're up here!
- We're up in the pocket!
- This is Constance Winters...

701
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:41,479
reporting live
on the progress of the giant baby
who has just been identified...

702
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,956
as Adam Szalinski
from Vista Del Mar.

703
00:55:48,407 --> 00:55:50,716
- Let's go.
- The governor's on the phone
for you, sir.

704
00:55:52,007 --> 00:55:54,646
Yes, Governor.
He's a pretty big baby.

705
00:55:57,527 --> 00:55:59,836
I can get rope guns.
We can shoot ropes over him.

706
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:02,680
Absolutely not. You are not
shooting anything at my baby.

707
00:56:02,767 --> 00:56:06,885
- Baby? Look at him.
- Hey, we're his parents, okay?
We'll handle this.

708
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:10,004
- Diane?
- Yeah, Wayne?
- How do we handle this?

709
00:56:14,527 --> 00:56:17,564
- Ready!
- Watch out! Look out! Look out!

710
00:56:17,647 --> 00:56:21,196
Mommy. Mom!

711
00:56:21,287 --> 00:56:24,404
- Nicky, are you okay?
- Adam, put your brother down.

712
00:56:24,487 --> 00:56:27,479
- Adam, baby, Mommy's here.
- Nicky, I'm gonna get you
out of here right away!

713
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,876
Okay, Dad, but hurry!

714
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:33,118
We can get a fire truck in here
and run a ladder up to 'em.

715
00:56:33,207 --> 00:56:35,562
That ladder wouldn't even
reach beyond his knees.

716
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:45,121
Adam, now sit down
really slowly.

717
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:48,483
I got it! Big Bunny.
I need Big Bunny.

718
00:56:48,567 --> 00:56:50,398
- I need something called Big Dummy?
- No, Bunny!

719
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:53,160
- Bunny?
- It's his favourite toy!

720
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,442
It's the kid's favourite toy.

721
00:57:05,967 --> 00:57:08,686
A helicopter is approaching
with what looks like...

722
00:57:08,767 --> 00:57:11,725
a giant stuffed animal of
some sort hanging from it.

723
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:16,323
- Thanks.
- Honey, this is dangerous!

724
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:19,205
- Don't worry.
- Pilot's ready for you, Wayne.

725
00:57:19,287 --> 00:57:22,484
It's all primed. Be ready
to activate as soon as he's down.

726
00:57:22,567 --> 00:57:24,478
I'll be fine.

727
00:57:28,327 --> 00:57:32,366
I'm positive my dad will
have a plan to get us...

728
00:57:32,447 --> 00:57:34,563
Tell me I'm not seeing this.

729
00:57:34,647 --> 00:57:38,242
Twinkle, twinkle little star

730
00:57:38,327 --> 00:57:42,002
How I wonder what you are

731
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:45,921
- Up above the world so high
- I told you my Dad would have a plan.

732
00:57:46,007 --> 00:57:50,000
- Like a diamond in the sky
- Bunny.

733
00:57:50,087 --> 00:57:53,762
Twinkle, twinkle little star

734
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:59,519
How I wonder what you are

735
00:57:59,607 --> 00:58:04,362
- Radio it in! Radio...
- Twinkle, twinkle little star

736
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:10,317
How I wonder what you are

737
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:14,719
Oh, I'm tired.
Are you tired, Big Bunny?

738
00:58:14,807 --> 00:58:18,163
Oh, yeah, I'm really tired.

739
00:58:18,247 --> 00:58:21,159
I can't remember
when I was this tired.

740
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:25,320
- Get ready, Dr Sterling.
He's getting blinky.
- Yeah, me too.

741
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,318
- I don't know what to do.
- He's getting sleepy!

742
00:58:27,407 --> 00:58:29,477
It's working.
Your husband's a genius.

743
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:33,845
I got an idea.
Why don't we all have a nice...

744
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,360
- No!
- Long...

745
00:58:35,447 --> 00:58:37,961
- Don't say it!
- Nap?

746
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,607
- Brace yourself!
- No nap!

747
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:45,238
Whoa! Help! Help! Hang on!
Get me away from him! Move me away!

748
00:58:45,327 --> 00:58:47,636
No nap!

749
00:58:47,727 --> 00:58:50,036
- I get it! No nap!
- Hold on, Dad!

750
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:53,119
- Take me up or put me down!
Take me away!
- Roy, let's move in closer!

751
00:58:53,207 --> 00:58:56,119
- I'm gonna jump! I'm gonna jump!
- Release the bunny.

752
00:58:57,927 --> 00:59:00,521
- Whoa!
- Dad!

753
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:02,757
Release it now!

754
00:59:05,047 --> 00:59:07,515
- Run!
- Run!
- Whoa!

755
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:11,721
- Dad, this is Mandy.
- Hi...

756
00:59:11,807 --> 00:59:16,483
Stay right there, kids. There's
absolutely nothing to worry about.

757
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:19,365
I feel a whole lot better.

758
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:27,076
- That's my dad.
- He seems really nice.

759
00:59:31,607 --> 00:59:34,246
Run, Dad!
Watch out for his foot!

760
00:59:37,727 --> 00:59:40,116
Are you all right?
Nice try, buddy.

761
00:59:40,207 --> 00:59:45,156
- He's headed for the strip.
- You little devil.

762
00:59:52,847 --> 00:59:56,362
He's heading toward the city. We'll
follow and bring you a live update.

763
00:59:56,447 --> 01:00:00,360
Adam Szalinski, this is your
Mommy talking. You stop right now!

764
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:04,360
Afraid that won't do any good,
Mrs Szalinski. I'm sure he expects
his mommy to be bigger than he is.

765
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:08,565
To him you're just...
Well, you're nothing more
than a little talking doll.

766
01:00:11,087 --> 01:00:13,760
Nothing can stop him now.

767
01:00:15,127 --> 01:00:18,403
I don't know what
these guys are gonna want, but
we'll have to cooperate with 'em.

768
01:00:18,487 --> 01:00:20,921
- All right, go brief the men.
- Yes, sir.

769
01:00:21,007 --> 01:00:24,522
Dr Hendrickson. Captain Ed Myerson,
Nevada State Militia.

770
01:00:24,607 --> 01:00:27,644
- Captain, let's hope
we can wrap this up quickly.
- Just so you're aware, sir.

771
01:00:27,727 --> 01:00:30,605
My orders state we do nothing
without final authorization.

772
01:00:30,687 --> 01:00:34,396
Frankly, Captain, I'm not under
the jurisdiction of the state militia.
Your orders mean nothing to me.

773
01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:36,398
A giant infant is
heading toward the city.

774
01:00:36,487 --> 01:00:39,957
The baby is over 50 feet tall and
appears to be growing even bigger
at an alarming rate.

775
01:00:40,047 --> 01:00:44,006
- All right, let's move it, Captain, now.
- Lf it's okay with you,
I'll just sit tight.
- Scientists say this may be caused by...

776
01:00:44,087 --> 01:00:46,203
More on this story
as it develops.

777
01:00:50,087 --> 01:00:52,317
There's something down
by my foot.

778
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:54,523
- Look at this.
- Wow.

779
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:56,996
Let's see what else is down here.

780
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:01,597
Cereal. Hey cool, want some?

781
01:01:01,687 --> 01:01:03,962
No, thanks. I'm on a diet.

782
01:01:04,047 --> 01:01:05,958
Have a raisin.

783
01:01:06,047 --> 01:01:09,517
Please clear the streets
for your own safety.

784
01:01:09,607 --> 01:01:13,122
Please stay indoors!
This is an emergency!

785
01:01:13,207 --> 01:01:15,880
All pedestrians
are in grave danger.

786
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:18,117
Please clear the streets!

787
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:25,398
This is the Emergency Broadcast System.
This is not a test.

788
01:01:25,487 --> 01:01:28,081
A human baby of abnormal proportions
is approaching the city.

789
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:32,957
The giant appears
to be growing at a tremendous rate
and has now reached 100 feet.

790
01:01:33,047 --> 01:01:35,038
What's happening here?
Is Wayne Newton in town?

791
01:01:35,127 --> 01:01:38,597
No, they don't do this for Wayne Newton.
It must be somebody bigger.

792
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:42,362
Listen, babe, there's nobody bigger
than Wayne Newton in this town.

793
01:01:44,207 --> 01:01:47,404
- Of course, I could be wrong.
- Peekaboo.

794
01:02:12,527 --> 01:02:14,438
Is he growing
or are we shrinking?

795
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:18,600
It's amazing! He's doubled in size
in just a few minutes.

796
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:30,764
Adam! Put us down!
You put us down now!

797
01:02:31,807 --> 01:02:34,605
Howdy, partners.

798
01:02:34,687 --> 01:02:36,962
Welcome to downtown Las Vegas.

799
01:02:50,527 --> 01:02:52,643
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

800
01:02:56,327 --> 01:02:58,397
He's toddling down the centre
of Fremont Street.

801
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:00,762
He knows not to go in
the street by himself.

802
01:03:00,847 --> 01:03:02,758
There's no telling
how huge he might get.

803
01:03:02,847 --> 01:03:06,396
Especially if he touches
any of those lights.
We've got to get him away from them.

804
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:08,921
But how? There's nothing
that's gonna make him leave.

805
01:03:09,007 --> 01:03:11,396
Unless he sees something
that he wants more.

806
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:16,925
- Tell your men to pull over.
I think Wayne's got an idea.
- Follow that ice-cream truck.

807
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:28,959
We'll need a really big loudspeaker.
Who can drive an ice-cream truck
real fast?

808
01:03:29,047 --> 01:03:33,518
- I can burn rubber.
- Well, start burning it.
We'll be with you on the walkie-talkie.

809
01:03:33,607 --> 01:03:37,361
- Preston Brooks, US Marshals. We're
commandeering this vehicle. Come on.
- Hey, wait a minute!

810
01:03:42,407 --> 01:03:46,241
- What's that?
- It's a tranquillizer cannon.
It's used on large mammals.

811
01:03:46,327 --> 01:03:48,602
Cartridges can incapacitate
a target in seconds.

812
01:03:48,687 --> 01:03:52,077
It's like a normal injection, but
on a slightly larger scale, of course.

813
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:55,921
Frankly, sir, I have kids myself
and that just doesn't seem
like the type of...

814
01:03:56,007 --> 01:03:59,841
Well, naturally, Captain.
This is just a... a last resort.

815
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:06,796
Reporting live from the famous Glitter
Gulch where certainly the biggest story
of the year is unfolding.

816
01:04:06,887 --> 01:04:10,323
Casino owners are understandably upset.
They've been ordered
to evacuate the area.

817
01:04:10,407 --> 01:04:12,875
The answers to many of our questions lie
with two key players in this drama...

818
01:04:12,967 --> 01:04:14,878
- Dr Clifford Sterling
of Sterling Laboratories...
- What we do know is that a baby...

819
01:04:14,967 --> 01:04:19,324
by the name of Adam Szalinski
has somehow measured over 100 feet tall.

820
01:04:19,407 --> 01:04:22,240
Stop the clapping.

821
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:28,957
- I got a plan.
- Great. 'Cause I'm
starting to get airsick.

822
01:04:29,047 --> 01:04:33,245
We'll pull the thread out
of the bottom of the pocket and
use it as a rope to slide down.

823
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:36,444
The scene here is one
of total confusion and chaos.

824
01:04:36,527 --> 01:04:38,836
But so far all the casinos
are still standing.

825
01:04:50,607 --> 01:04:52,598
Watch out!

826
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:07,516
- Hi.
- Hey! Hey, don't! What are you doin'?

827
01:05:07,607 --> 01:05:09,996
Stop! Stop! Stop!

828
01:05:13,767 --> 01:05:16,565
We'll have to jump.

829
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:20,196
Hold on.

830
01:05:20,287 --> 01:05:24,041
Don't look down. Watch out
for the gearshift. Jump!

831
01:05:26,967 --> 01:05:30,164
- Go!
- I'm trying!

832
01:05:30,247 --> 01:05:32,044
- Truly, I'm trying.
- Stayin'alive

833
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:35,881
- Hurry! Hurry, do something!
- Stayin'alive
- I'm used to an automatic.

834
01:05:35,967 --> 01:05:38,162
- Stayin'alive
- We've gotta get out of here.

835
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,757
Toy car!

836
01:05:42,847 --> 01:05:45,042
Buckle up!

837
01:05:55,527 --> 01:05:58,360
- Adam, get him away from me!
- Adam!

838
01:05:58,447 --> 01:06:01,598
Adam! Adam! Don't eat us!

839
01:06:01,687 --> 01:06:03,200
Whoa!

840
01:06:07,927 --> 01:06:10,805
We're here live in Glitter Gulch,
standing just below Adam Szalinski...

841
01:06:10,887 --> 01:06:14,118
who has lifted a small yellow
sports car into the air...

842
01:06:14,207 --> 01:06:16,277
with three unidentified
persons in it.

843
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:19,518
From what I can make out,
it looks like two young teenagers,
a boy and a girl...

844
01:06:19,607 --> 01:06:22,440
and a man dressed
in an Indian costume.

845
01:06:22,527 --> 01:06:27,647
- What's he doing?
- He's taking something out
of his pocket. A peppermint!

846
01:06:29,767 --> 01:06:31,837
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

847
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:43,917
Howdy, partners.

848
01:06:51,327 --> 01:06:54,046
That car is like a toy to him.

849
01:06:54,127 --> 01:06:57,164
I hope this thing
has air bags!

850
01:07:01,207 --> 01:07:05,644
- Do something, Nick! Tell him to stop!
- I can't! He's too big!

851
01:07:05,727 --> 01:07:07,957
We gotta get him away from those lights
before he touches any of them.

852
01:07:08,047 --> 01:07:10,083
Brooks, what's happening
with that ice-cream truck?

853
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:12,556
- We're almost set.
- Roger.

854
01:07:13,847 --> 01:07:16,486
- No!
- Watch the tree!

855
01:07:26,207 --> 01:07:29,165
Oh, no!

856
01:07:29,247 --> 01:07:31,477
Just a big baby
with his toy.

857
01:07:38,007 --> 01:07:40,077
Coming through!

858
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:41,839
Get out of the way!

859
01:07:41,927 --> 01:07:44,566
- Come on, Adam, put it down.
Put it down.
- Come on, sweetheart. Put it down.

860
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:51,403
What's he doing now?

861
01:07:51,487 --> 01:07:55,605
Put us down!
Put us down!

862
01:07:55,687 --> 01:07:57,518
He put it down.

863
01:07:57,607 --> 01:08:00,360
Pick us up!
Pick us up!

864
01:08:05,687 --> 01:08:09,839
Oh, my God! We're gonna die! We're gonna
die! We're gonna die in a convertible!

865
01:08:09,927 --> 01:08:12,487
- What about that truck?
- Brooks? What's happening there?

866
01:08:12,567 --> 01:08:15,081
Okay. We're set.

867
01:08:17,887 --> 01:08:19,718
- No! Wait!
- Hold it! Hold it!

868
01:08:19,807 --> 01:08:21,798
We need him to get the kids down.

869
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:25,398
Cut it off!

870
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:30,198
- I can't stand it.
- Oh, my God!

871
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:35,918
Whatever you do,
don't look down!

872
01:08:36,007 --> 01:08:39,079
- Nick, don't let go! Please!
- I won't.

873
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:41,362
I'm gonna pull you
back up, okay?

874
01:08:41,447 --> 01:08:43,438
- Nick! Mandy!
- Hold on!

875
01:08:43,527 --> 01:08:46,485
- But you gotta help.
- Okay!

876
01:08:46,567 --> 01:08:49,798
Get the car, Adam!

877
01:08:51,367 --> 01:08:53,164
Adam! Pick up the car!

878
01:08:53,247 --> 01:08:56,683
- Adam, get the car!
- Come on, Adam. Come on.
- Come on, sweetheart.

879
01:08:56,767 --> 01:08:58,644
Come on. I got you.

880
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:03,001
Car fall down!

881
01:09:10,327 --> 01:09:12,522
Lock your door.

882
01:09:33,807 --> 01:09:35,798
Thank you, Adam.

883
01:09:39,887 --> 01:09:42,799
- He put 'em in the pocket!
- Honey, we can't wait any longer.

884
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,117
Let's do it.

885
01:09:47,367 --> 01:09:50,643
Everyone stand by now.
Attention, all casinos, wait
for my signal to turn off your lights.

886
01:09:50,727 --> 01:09:53,321
Marshal Brooks,
bring on the truck.

887
01:10:02,127 --> 01:10:04,277
Nick, come on.

888
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:13,284
Ready, set, go, Union Plaza.

889
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:18,397
Go, Golden Gate.

890
01:10:18,487 --> 01:10:20,955
Las Vegas Club.

891
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:24,005
Now, hit the searchlights.

892
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:28,597
Go, Brooks!

893
01:10:30,047 --> 01:10:32,515
Lucky Lady. Jackpot.

894
01:10:32,607 --> 01:10:35,485
- Come on, Adam.
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, baby. Go for it.
- Go for it.

895
01:10:35,567 --> 01:10:38,127
Glitter Gulch. Golden Goose.

896
01:10:38,207 --> 01:10:42,280
- Ice cream.
- Coin Castle.

897
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:46,076
Binion's Horseshoe. Vegas World.

898
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:48,044
This must be another
one of my dad's plans.

899
01:10:48,127 --> 01:10:49,924
- Star Palace.
- Great.

900
01:10:50,007 --> 01:10:53,556
4 Queens. The Fremont.

901
01:10:56,687 --> 01:11:00,885
- It's working, Wayne.
- Go, Adam!
- He really likes ice cream.

902
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:09,964
- Yes!
- It's working!

903
01:11:13,607 --> 01:11:15,563
- Ice cream!
- Where are you guys?

904
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:18,525
This kid's gaining on me.

905
01:11:28,127 --> 01:11:31,005
We have clearance, Captain.
Move it.

906
01:11:46,727 --> 01:11:50,163
Brooks said he caught the ice-cream
truck just outside of town.

907
01:11:50,247 --> 01:11:52,397
Next thing I know, he grabbed
it right off the truck.

908
01:11:52,487 --> 01:11:56,275
- What'd he do with it?
- What do you think he did with it?

909
01:11:56,367 --> 01:11:58,881
- You got another idea?
- I will. Come on. Let's go.

910
01:11:58,967 --> 01:12:02,118
- Dr Sterling?
- Wayne!

911
01:12:02,207 --> 01:12:06,962
Do you remember how we got Adam to
hold still to have his picture taken?
I put him in my lap and I held him.

912
01:12:07,047 --> 01:12:09,845
- Yeah?
- Honey, he needs me.

913
01:12:09,927 --> 01:12:15,399
The problem is, to Adam, his mommy
is somebody much bigger than he is.

914
01:12:17,047 --> 01:12:19,117
- No, Diane. It's a crazy idea...
- Wayne!

915
01:12:19,207 --> 01:12:22,882
For almost 20 years I've watched
you have one crazy idea after another.

916
01:12:22,967 --> 01:12:25,640
It's my turn
to have just one.

917
01:12:37,407 --> 01:12:38,999
Fire!

918
01:12:44,647 --> 01:12:47,207
- My guitar.
- Uh-oh!

919
01:12:47,287 --> 01:12:49,437
- What now?
- Adam, don't touch that guitar!

920
01:12:54,087 --> 01:12:57,397
I am pre-heating the lasers now,
600 volts.

921
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:02,403
Diane, I should be
doing this, not you.

922
01:13:02,487 --> 01:13:04,603
There's one thing
every little kid knows.

923
01:13:04,687 --> 01:13:07,440
Daddies mean fun.
Mommies mean business.

924
01:13:07,527 --> 01:13:09,882
But-But-But this was never meant
to do anything like this.

925
01:13:09,967 --> 01:13:12,003
Too little power and you'll
grow too slowly like Adam.

926
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:14,806
- And too much power...
- I trust you, Wayne Szalinski.

927
01:13:19,767 --> 01:13:21,917
Wayne, time to get large.

928
01:13:24,727 --> 01:13:26,718
Here's your soda, sir.

929
01:13:26,807 --> 01:13:29,526
- What do you need a Coke bottle for?
- I don't.

930
01:13:29,607 --> 01:13:31,677
- Just the bottom.
- Oh.

931
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:44,524
Tom, I'm here just outside the Hard Rock
Cafe. The giant baby is approaching.

932
01:13:44,607 --> 01:13:48,725
Hello? I can't hear you.
Turn off the lights?

933
01:13:48,807 --> 01:13:51,640
A giant what? Baby?

934
01:13:57,087 --> 01:14:00,204
Guitar!

935
01:14:00,287 --> 01:14:03,723
- Oh, my God!
- Let's get out of here!

936
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:21,519
For your own safety,
please stay indoors.

937
01:14:21,607 --> 01:14:23,643
Adam! Don't touch the guitar!

938
01:14:25,487 --> 01:14:28,206
I'll save ya!

939
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:31,643
No, Adam!
Adam, put down the guitar.

940
01:14:37,967 --> 01:14:41,243
Can't this thing go any faster?
The kid might be growing again!

941
01:14:41,327 --> 01:14:44,205
This is as fast as we
can go safely, Doctor!

942
01:14:48,647 --> 01:14:52,640
Constance Winters live across
the street from the Hard Rock Cafe.

943
01:14:52,727 --> 01:14:55,878
He thinks the guitar
is a real musical instrument.

944
01:14:55,967 --> 01:14:57,923
He's trying to play a tune!

945
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:13,716
- Bring me into range and hold it steady.
- Doctor, wait a minute.

946
01:15:13,807 --> 01:15:16,799
Now, if we hit him and he stumbles,
he could fall into the crowd.

947
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:20,118
Well, we'll just have to hope
that doesn't happen.

948
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:35,485
Adam, put down the guitar
and get the aeroplane.

949
01:15:35,567 --> 01:15:37,922
Aeroplane. Hi.

950
01:15:38,007 --> 01:15:41,158
Hold it. Steady.

951
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:47,677
- They're shooting at Adam!
- I assume that little manoeuvre
was an error, Captain.

952
01:15:47,767 --> 01:15:51,043
Now steady, or I'll make sure this
is the last mission you ever fly.

953
01:15:51,127 --> 01:15:53,846
Hey! Pick on somebody
your own size.

954
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:02,085
Ow!

955
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,559
All right, let's go again.

956
01:16:37,007 --> 01:16:38,599
Dan, the...

957
01:16:38,687 --> 01:16:42,316
Hold it stead...

958
01:16:42,407 --> 01:16:45,240
Back off!

959
01:16:45,327 --> 01:16:47,477
Yes, ma'am.

960
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,841
You tell 'em!
That's my mom!

961
01:16:53,927 --> 01:16:58,159
- I need a vacation.
- Whoa. Look at that mother.

962
01:17:15,807 --> 01:17:18,799
- Come here, baby.
- Mama!

963
01:17:20,647 --> 01:17:22,877
Come to Mommy.

964
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,797
Come here, baby.
Come to Mommy!

965
01:17:30,887 --> 01:17:35,165
Mom! Easy, Mom!

966
01:17:35,247 --> 01:17:37,602
Everything's gonna be okay,
sweetie.

967
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:42,764
- Mommy's here.
- Everything it's got, Doctor!

968
01:17:42,847 --> 01:17:44,758
Roger!

969
01:17:47,927 --> 01:17:53,479
- You crying?
- Yeah. It's okay to cry
when you're so happy.

970
01:17:55,287 --> 01:17:59,075
The bearings in the generator are
about to burn out. We better do it.

971
01:18:03,687 --> 01:18:08,158
Okay, now, look at Daddy.
Smile for Daddy.

972
01:18:09,247 --> 01:18:12,364
- There he is.
- Daddy.

973
01:18:12,447 --> 01:18:15,359
Wayne, 1450!
It's all she can take!

974
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:21,843
- Say cheese, Adam.
- Cheese, Adam.

975
01:18:24,727 --> 01:18:27,002
Come on, Wayne.

976
01:18:38,367 --> 01:18:41,643
- Look, Adam, there's Daddy.
- Daddy!

977
01:18:41,727 --> 01:18:44,605
Honey, you did it.

978
01:18:44,687 --> 01:18:46,484
Adam!

979
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:48,797
Adam.

980
01:18:48,887 --> 01:18:51,799
- You gave us quite a scare, little man.
- I knew you could do it, honey.

981
01:18:51,887 --> 01:18:54,162
There he is!
Let me through!

982
01:18:55,727 --> 01:18:58,878
Well, Szalinski, you pulled it off.
Who would have thought?

983
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:04,246
Dr Hendrickson,
that looked like some sort of rifle
that you were shooting at my baby.

984
01:19:04,327 --> 01:19:08,002
They were tranquillizer cartridges. They
wouldn't have hurt him, I assure you.

985
01:19:08,087 --> 01:19:12,000
Oh. Tranquillizer cartridges.

986
01:19:16,687 --> 01:19:19,326
- Never cross Mommy.
- We got an emergency here.

987
01:19:19,407 --> 01:19:24,242
Dr Hendrickson needs help.
He's overcome with the prospect
of having to find a new career.

988
01:19:24,327 --> 01:19:28,002
Hey, big fella, is this
what you were lookin' for?

989
01:19:30,927 --> 01:19:34,124
Wayne! Nick and Mandy!

990
01:19:34,207 --> 01:19:37,244
- Weren't they in Adam's pocket?
- In Adam's pocket!

991
01:19:41,247 --> 01:19:42,965
- Don't tell me.
- Oh, my God.

992
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:46,517
Honey, I shrunk the kids.
Nobody move!

993
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:50,998
Don't worry. I have highly specialized
equipment to deal with this.

994
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:54,796
I'll need the helmet
and I'll need the dog.

995
01:19:54,887 --> 01:19:56,764
Good morning, Las Vegas.
All vehicles are asked...

996
01:19:56,847 --> 01:19:59,805
to stay clear of the Hard Rock Cafe
where inventor Wayne Szalinski...

997
01:19:59,887 --> 01:20:02,765
is conducting a one-man search
to find some missing children.

998
01:20:02,847 --> 01:20:06,999
It was Szalinski's matter-expanding
machine that was responsible
for last night's amazing events.

999
01:20:07,087 --> 01:20:10,875
Dr Clifford Sterling
has just announced...

1000
01:20:10,967 --> 01:20:14,801
I guess your father's about
the most famous guy in the world today.

1001
01:20:16,087 --> 01:20:18,555
And I guess you're
about the bravest.

1002
01:20:21,407 --> 01:20:23,398
That's for saving my life.

1003
01:20:23,487 --> 01:20:26,001
It wasn't much.

1004
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,681
I don't mean your life wasn't much.

1005
01:20:29,847 --> 01:20:32,520
What I did wasn't so much.

1006
01:20:34,007 --> 01:20:36,475
Ours if we want it

1007
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:40,276
Tonight has our initials on it

1008
01:20:40,367 --> 01:20:42,722
How long do you think
it'll take before they find us?

1009
01:20:42,807 --> 01:20:46,641
I think it may be a while
before they find us.

1010
01:20:50,647 --> 01:20:54,322
You're kind of different, Nick.
Like your dad.

1011
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:58,002
We're not all that different.

1012
01:20:58,087 --> 01:21:01,966
Yeah, you are.
But when you think about it...

1013
01:21:02,047 --> 01:21:04,959
I guess the world needs people
who are different.

1014
01:21:05,047 --> 01:21:08,562
People who see things a little
differently, I guess you could say.

1015
01:21:08,647 --> 01:21:12,117
We'll appear sometime

1016
01:21:12,207 --> 01:21:15,324
Maybe tonight is yours and mine

1017
01:21:21,047 --> 01:21:24,164
- Are they okay?
- Yep. I think we better give 'em
a couple of minutes though.

1018
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:28,126
- What are we gonna do about that?
- Adam, look!

1019
01:21:33,127 --> 01:21:35,277
Big, Big, Big Bunny.

1020
01:21:38,207 --> 01:21:40,118
What are we gonna do with this?

1021
01:21:40,207 --> 01:21:43,165
Don't worry. I'll think of something.
Don't I always?

1022
01:21:44,607 --> 01:21:47,405
- Don't you trust me?
- I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

1023
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:50,001
Oh, come on. When have I ever...
