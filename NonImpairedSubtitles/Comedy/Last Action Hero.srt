1
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:10,629
This is one hell of a way
to spend Christmas.

2
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,885
- Mulcahey!
- Sir.

3
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:20,103
Secure the sidewalk.
No one gets in or out.

4
00:01:37,883 --> 00:01:42,891
<i>I have a present for you!
Pigs!</i>

5
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:53,951
Let the children go!
Damn you, Ripper!

6
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:21,746
Slater!!

7
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:27,423
Do no even think it, Slater.
Wait for the hostage negotiator.

8
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:30,261
Goddamn it, Jack,
I am talking to you!

9
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:34,142
The last time you pulled this
jive, jitterbug, tough gonad shit -

10
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:37,022
- people lost bodyparts!

11
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:42,531
If you go in there,
you will lose your badge!

12
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,036
Jack, as Mayor of this city, -

13
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:49,042
- you and I have had our tiffs,
but this is the Lieutenant Governor.

14
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:53,716
- When the Governor gets here, call me.
- Do not let Slater in.

15
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:57,180
Repeat: Do not let him in!

16
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:00,018
Piece of cake.

17
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,236
Do you want to be a farmer?
Here is a couple of acres.

18
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:11,829
<i>- Dekker, the next one I will hurt.
- Slater, do not go in there!</i>

19
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:21,846
Check fire. There is a plain-clothes
officer in the building.

20
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:29,316
- Jack, what kept you?
- Dad!

21
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,247
Andy is getting nervous.
I promised him you would come.

22
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:44,300
I gave him my word he could
watch you die. Lose the cannon.

23
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,849
Has he hurt you, Andrew?

24
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:54,275
Did you say hurt, Jack?
What do you know about hurt?

25
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:59,617
- You put me in a cage for ten years.
- You deserved the death penalty.

26
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,580
Yes, whatever.

27
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,421
Things crawl around in my head
and sit on my chest when I wake up.

28
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:10,676
Do you know what it is like?

29
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:17,939
Your illegal search rendered
the bloody axe inadmissable. Remember?

30
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:22,279
Now lose the gun.

31
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:35,760
All right, I am unarmed.
Let the boy go.

32
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:42,187
Just one gun, Jack?
You must be kidding.

33
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,521
- Is that all, sport?
- Yes, that about does it.

34
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:11,193
Then step away.

35
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,118
Chop-chop.

36
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:22,628
Unless you consider this a weapon.

37
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:34,231
Brilliant, Jack. Brilliant.
I surrender.

38
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:36,903
- That is a live grenade.
- Sure.

39
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:43,038
You will sacrifice your son to get me.
I am flattered, but I doubt it.

40
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:48,964
Andy, pick up the grenade.
Go on.

41
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:56,435
Show it to me.

42
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:06,451
Jack, that toy cannot
hurt the boy.

43
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:10,709
But this one can.

44
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:32,077
Focus!

45
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:37,252
Come on, focus!

46
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:42,177
People are trying to sleep.

47
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:47,561
The film is out of focus.
The film... Never mind.

48
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:51,442
Nick!

49
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:15,440
Nick, are you okay?

50
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:20,532
The climax is on the fritz.

51
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:35,432
I never used to do that, Danny.

52
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:42,068
It is okay. I have seen this Slater
six times. I was just worried.

53
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:46,491
The new Jack Slater opens
this weekend.

54
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:54,380
Like I did not know that.
"They killed his cousin. Big mistake!"

55
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,301
"Jack Slater IV."

56
00:07:57,552 --> 00:08:03,311
I am checking the print tonight.
Midnight. Just myself.

57
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:11,073
I could get you admittance,
if that sort of thing appeals to you.

58
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:15,206
See it before it opens?
Who do I have to kill?

59
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:22,259
Just get to school.
You will only be four hours late.

60
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:52,100
<i>Treachery, conspiracy, sex,
sword fights, madness, ghosts.</i>

61
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,855
<i>And everybody dies.</i>

62
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:58,235
Shakespeare's "Hamlet"
could not be more exciting.

63
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:03,202
And though he may seem
incapable of taking action, -

64
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:10,297
- he is one of the first
action heroes.

65
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:17,851
You will now see a scene from
the film by Laurence Olivier.

66
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:22,192
You may have seen him in the
Polaroid commercial -

67
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:28,535
- or as Zeus in
"Clash of the Titans".

68
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,752
<i>O bosom black as death.</i>

69
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:41,348
<i>Help angels.
All may yet be well.</i>

70
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:44,604
<i>Now he is praying.</i>

71
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:49,153
<i>And now I will do it.</i>

72
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:08,560
<i>- And so he goes to heaven.
- Do not talk, just do it.</i>

73
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:14,236
Hey, Claudius.

74
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:21,038
You killed my father.

75
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,045
Big mistake.

76
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:29,136
<i>Something is rotten
in the state of Denmark.</i>

77
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:35,146
<i>And Hamlet
is taking out the trash.</i>

78
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:45,830
- Stay thy hand, fair prince.
- Who said I am fair?

79
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:56,263
<i>No one is going to tell
this sweet prince goodnight.</i>

80
00:10:56,514 --> 00:11:01,481
To be... or not to be.

81
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:05,780
Not to be.

82
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:26,855
The whole morning?
He was not?

83
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:32,824
No, he was not at school today.
He is sick as a lamb.

84
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:38,625
Tell me the story of your life
starting this morning, first period.

85
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,255
And make it good.

86
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:49,393
Something along the lines of:
"I cut so I could donate a kidney."

87
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:55,278
Were you at the movies again?
That crazy guy is an accessory.

88
00:11:55,528 --> 00:12:00,786
- Nick is not crazy.
- Damn it, Danny!

89
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:10,386
I lied to a principal. And what for?
So you can go to the movies?

90
00:12:10,637 --> 00:12:12,389
Sorry.

91
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,561
I did not choose this.

92
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:21,446
I did not ask to become a widow
before the age of forty.

93
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:23,282
I know that.

94
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:27,498
Give me a hug.

95
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,920
- I will not cut again.
- Let me hear the "P" word.

96
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,135
I promise.

97
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:41,104
Jesus! I am late.
I have to get to work.

98
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:45,236
Lock the top lock
the minute I close the door.

99
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:51,913
And do not open for anyone.
Bye. I love you.

100
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:47,713
Are you alone?
Okay. Move it!

101
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:57,271
Do yourself to the drain.

102
00:13:59,274 --> 00:14:02,947
Tough guy.

103
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:10,376
Do it.
I will make it easier for you.

104
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:15,050
Go ahead.

105
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:19,266
Do it.

106
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,820
What is it with you?
You have junk!

107
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:33,664
No jewelry, no VCR.
A shit TV worth twenty bucks.

108
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,671
Go fish, amigo.

109
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:44,390
Remember your mom says
you are to go straight home.

110
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,649
She will be there
when the shift is over.

111
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,659
If we find the guy,
I will give you a call.

112
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:35,434
- I almost gave up on you.
- I am sorry.

113
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:50,374
- What do you think?
- I have never seen anything like it.

114
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:57,011
- It is not too tight, is it?
- No. It is the style.

115
00:15:57,261 --> 00:16:04,105
I always wanted to be a magician.
But my hands were too tiny.

116
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:10,115
My father worked here
and got me my first job. Usher.

117
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:19,589
I worked myself up to projectionist.
It is not much, but it is showbiz.

118
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:26,184
So, is the print ready?

119
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:32,027
Just a minute, young man.
Are we not forgetting something?

120
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:39,623
You have to have a ticket to see
a movie. And I have just the one.

121
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:48,554
When I was your age, Harry Houdini
played here and I met him backstage.

122
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:52,602
And he made a gesture
like this.

123
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:57,402
And all of a sudden
this was in his hand.

124
00:16:57,652 --> 00:17:02,578
And he said to me:
"This is a magic ticket."

125
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:08,420
"I got it from an Indian magician,
who got it from a Tibetan magician."

126
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:14,513
"It is a passport to another world.
It was mine."

127
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:18,812
"And now it is yours."

128
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:24,947
And now it is yours.

129
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,291
- What does it do, Nick?
- I never had the courage to find out.

130
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:37,593
I have always wanted to try,
but I was afraid it would not work.

131
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:44,355
At your age Houdini was like a god
to me. What if he was faking?

132
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,445
And then again...

133
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:55,540
- What if it did work?
- What if it did?

134
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:00,005
Houdini said something else.
He said:

135
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:10,148
"This ticket has a mind of its own.
It does what it wants to do."

136
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:15,114
That always made me edgy.

137
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:22,918
I guess there is only one way
to find out then. Right?

138
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,848
Please retain your stub, sir.

139
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:37,902
- Shall we see if Slater wins?
- Jack Slater cannot lose.

140
00:18:38,152 --> 00:18:42,868
Never has, never will.

141
00:19:23,978 --> 00:19:28,861
<i>Oh, Frankie.</i>

142
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:38,001
Frankie, why do you
keep on with the insults?

143
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:44,846
- I would not insult you, Mr. Vivaldi.
- When you lie, that is an insult.

144
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:51,315
You are Jack Slater's favourite cousin.
You talk all the time.

145
00:19:51,565 --> 00:20:01,206
I must know what Slater knows
and you are going to tell me.

146
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:04,502
Does he know
that me and Torelli -

147
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:10,804
- have just signed
a secret pact to control -

148
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:15,647
- all drugs
in Southern California?

149
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:23,618
We mostly talk
muzzle velocities. Guns.

150
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:41,105
Meet Mr. Benedict.

151
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:46,698
The genuine article.
And you better believe it.

152
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:54,544
Sometimes he likes to bake
while he shoots people.

153
00:20:55,044 --> 00:21:01,389
I am saying that Mr. Benedict
can take you out as easy as cake.

154
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:06,063
Pie, you Sicilian schmuck.

155
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:14,076
The man is a surgeon.

156
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:21,505
Do you want me to make him
operate on you?

157
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:25,845
I swear I do not know.

158
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:37,573
Dump him at his place.
But take it easy.

159
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:46,755
He bought it. He actually believes
me and Torelli are banding together.

160
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:54,393
The beauty part is, nobody knows
different. Until after the funeral.

161
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:59,275
Then everybody knows.

162
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:10,795
Everybody knows
Tony Vivaldi is number one.

163
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:16,888
You are going to pay.

164
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:22,439
Is this right?
It does not look like a crack house.

165
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:30,578
Do you want 60 guys dancing on
the lawn throwing cocaine around?

166
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,481
- What is up, guys?
- Quiet. This is a drug bust.

167
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:51,487
Drug bust? You must be joking.

168
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:57,748
My cousin Frank lives here.
The only drugs he has is aspirin.

169
00:22:57,998 --> 00:23:01,629
If you touch that front door,
you are going to need them.

170
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:08,181
It must be a mistake.
We received an anonymous tip.

171
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:14,024
Frank?

172
00:23:30,051 --> 00:23:33,390
Jack, listen to me.

173
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,186
- Who did this?
- Listen to me.

174
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:39,608
This is important.

175
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:48,874
Tony Vivaldi and the Torelli mob
are joining forces.

176
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:53,757
I am out of here.

177
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:06,235
Sorry, Frank.

178
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:31,236
It is a bomb!

179
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:44,590
He is okay. Minor wound.
Both cops dead.

180
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:06,334
Two days to retirement.

181
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:21,167
Nick?

182
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:51,634
- Who the hell are you?
- Do not shoot me! I am a kid.

183
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:05,573
- How did you get here?
- I do not think you want to know.

184
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:10,833
Close your eyes, stay flat
and do not move!

185
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:31,658
You are driving with no hands!

186
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:37,918
You have to practice
and never do it in heavy traffic.

187
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:50,982
I iced that guy,
to cone a phrase.

188
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:57,576
Wait... The bad puns,
the voice, the hard rock.

189
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:03,085
This is really happening.

190
00:28:04,713 --> 00:28:10,681
This is not happening.
Repeat: This is not...

191
00:29:38,534 --> 00:29:42,250
I threw up. Sorry.
I thought I was going to die.

192
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,593
I am sorry to disappoint you, but you
will live to enjoy the fruits of life.

193
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:56,106
Acne, shaving, premature
ejaculation and divorce.

194
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:22,107
Does this suck weenie or what?

195
00:30:22,774 --> 00:30:25,946
This is a movie set.

196
00:30:26,196 --> 00:30:33,292
This is a movie. That is how
the scenery changed, right?

197
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:46,731
You are going to play chicken, right?
Just like Jack Slater.

198
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:53,825
Fasten your seat belt, please.

199
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:59,710
Your fingers?
Cross as many as you can.

200
00:31:40,528 --> 00:31:47,372
I am in the movie.
Holy cow, I am in the movie.

201
00:31:51,212 --> 00:31:56,512
Nick, Houdini was not faking.

202
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:29,693
Jack, did you see that?

203
00:32:34,534 --> 00:32:41,254
I was just in a real police station.
And this is much nicer.

204
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:46,178
Slater, it is your ex-wife
on line two!

205
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:49,892
You stay.
She is always calling me.

206
00:32:50,143 --> 00:32:53,858
Hello, sweetheart.
It is nice to hear your voice.

207
00:32:54,108 --> 00:33:01,912
- Oiler! You team up with Waterman.
- Give me a partner, Sarge.

208
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,797
That is right.

209
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:14,725
Of course.
No, just as you said.

210
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:21,236
Krause!
You team up with the rabbi.

211
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:35,301
- How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
- Practice!

212
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:39,892
John Practice, you S.O.B.
Why are you not in Washington?

213
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:44,274
The Bureau thinks there is
something going on between...

214
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:48,072
Vivaldi is joining forces
with Torelli.

215
00:33:48,322 --> 00:33:53,957
- How do you do that?
- I do not sit around eating donuts.

216
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:58,506
Those are government donuts.
I have to call D.C.

217
00:33:58,756 --> 00:34:01,344
Good for you.

218
00:34:01,594 --> 00:34:05,852
Watch it, Jack.
He killed Mozart.

219
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:09,983
- In a movie?
- "Amadeus". It won 8 Oscars!

220
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:13,990
I saved him in 'Nam,
so I will be on the lookout.

221
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,831
Now, no more movies.

222
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:23,005
Slater!!

223
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:27,721
The city council is chewing my eggs
off for your plane crash!

224
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:32,103
The mayor is parading up my
Lincoln Tunnel for that beach stunt!

225
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:34,858
Everybody wants to know
what it will be!

226
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:39,240
- Do I make myself clear?!
- I am just doing my job.

227
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:42,829
You have given us the worst
reputation in the country!

228
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,668
The Chamber of Commerce is doing
cartwheels in my cocoa factory!

229
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,050
Ratcliff, you are on duty
with the cat.

230
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,181
Hiya, Toots!

231
00:34:55,099 --> 00:35:00,107
- Join me for a flea bath later?
- Touch me again and I will kill you!

232
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:03,363
- I can prove this is a movie.
- Who are you?

233
00:35:03,614 --> 00:35:05,742
It is a cartoon cat.

234
00:35:05,992 --> 00:35:11,084
He is supposed to be back.
He was only suspended a month.

235
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:17,846
Listen to me. An animated cat
just walked into the squad room.

236
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:22,478
- He will do it again tomorrow.
- That cat is one of my best men.

237
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:25,984
Who is that smiling twerp?

238
00:35:26,234 --> 00:35:30,199
I love the way you fight, knowing
how you really feel about each other.

239
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:34,623
How do I feel about this
sack of puppy poo?

240
00:35:34,874 --> 00:35:38,296
You are dearest friends.
After your wife left you -

241
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:42,386
- Jack told everyone he drove
her to the diphtheria clinic.

242
00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:45,141
When he came back, you said:

243
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:50,900
"You saved me from humiliation.
You are my dearest friend."

244
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,821
- You promised not to tell.
- I did not.

245
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:56,910
- Then how did he know?
- "Jack Slater I".

246
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,875
- Won what?
- No, the first Jack Slater.

247
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,461
You told your dad?

248
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:07,802
I told no one.
I do not know this kid.

249
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:14,021
He seems to know
a lot about us.

250
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,903
The state of New York has
never heard of you, Mr. Madigan.

251
00:36:18,153 --> 00:36:19,614
- What is your name?
- Danny Madigan.

252
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:23,621
- Where are you from?
- How did you get in my car?

253
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:32,301
I fell off a bridge into your car.
He saved my life.

254
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:36,141
Truth at last.
Now why were they after you?

255
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:39,146
My cousin Frank found out
some drug information.

256
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:45,115
Do not believe
what Vivaldi told him.

257
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:49,539
- How do you know about Vivaldi?
- I know what is going on.

258
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:55,047
- If you would just listen...
- I have the perfect listener for you.

259
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:57,594
Meet your new partner.

260
00:36:57,844 --> 00:37:02,143
Oh no... Better to die.

261
00:37:02,393 --> 00:37:06,567
You will love it, Jack.
We are perfect buddy material.

262
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:10,908
I teach you to be vulnerable,
you teach me to be brave.

263
00:37:11,158 --> 00:37:19,213
I am Jack Slater's new partner.
We work together in this film.

264
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:22,718
You know I am right.
If this was the real world, -

265
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:28,436
- they would not make us partners,
but send me to a social worker.

266
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:32,735
How do I know they tortured Frank
and stashed him behind his door?

267
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:36,449
I saw it on screen.
This is a movie.

268
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:40,081
You are very clever, and I would
be roaring with laughter, -

269
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:43,044
- but they killed my cousin.
And that is a...

270
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:47,927
"Big mistake." That is what
you were going to say, right?

271
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:53,895
- How would I know that?
- No one likes a smart-ass.

272
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:59,320
Then shoot me. Point your gun
at my head and pull the trigger.

273
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:04,245
Come on. Do it.
I double dare you.

274
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:09,504
But you are not going to do it.
You do not kill kids in the movies.

275
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:13,553
Because you are the good guy.

276
00:38:13,803 --> 00:38:17,726
You really believe you are
inside a movie, do you not?

277
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:24,821
You have ten minutes to prove it.
And then I shoot you.

278
00:38:30,456 --> 00:38:33,628
- Schwarzenegger films?
- Foreign films are in the back.

279
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:41,515
- No, this guy is an action star.
- Down the centre on the left.

280
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:50,697
No, it is not possible.

281
00:38:50,948 --> 00:38:55,538
What? He is fantastic.
It is his best performance ever.

282
00:38:55,789 --> 00:39:01,131
- It was you in that movie.
- You were in a movie?

283
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:07,141
Yes, called "Girl of My Dreams".
It starred you.

284
00:39:07,392 --> 00:39:12,066
We had a very romantic
scene together.

285
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:16,991
- What is the store's phone number?
- 5552310.

286
00:39:17,241 --> 00:39:19,787
What is your home number?

287
00:39:20,037 --> 00:39:23,167
You can give it to him.
I am a police officer.

288
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:26,756
- 5553812.
- Amazing.

289
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:31,682
I will bet that everyone
has a 555 number.

290
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:36,982
There can only be 9999 numbers
that start with 555.

291
00:39:37,232 --> 00:39:42,491
- How many people live in L.A.?
- Eight or nine million.

292
00:39:42,742 --> 00:39:45,830
That is why we have area codes.

293
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,960
- Is this your kid?
- Oh no.

294
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,384
He is a mental patient
that I am taking downtown.

295
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:59,060
What about this girl?
She is too attractive to work here.

296
00:39:59,311 --> 00:40:05,613
I agree. I think she should work
with us. Undercover of course.

297
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:09,661
The point is there are
no unattractive women here.

298
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:13,709
Where are the ordinary women?

299
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:18,884
- Nowhere. This is a movie.
- No, this is California.

300
00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:24,519
And thanks. It was sweet
the way you got that girl's number.

301
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:28,275
Okay, Mr. Non-believer.
I will take you to the house -

302
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:35,745
- where your cousin Frank was tortured.
I have seen it on screen.

303
00:40:35,996 --> 00:40:37,499
It is like that one.

304
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:42,716
But on the other side of the road.
It has an ocean view.

305
00:40:42,966 --> 00:40:48,057
There is something
you do not understand.

306
00:40:48,308 --> 00:40:56,613
This ticket is magic. Any second
we will drive right into a theatre.

307
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:01,455
Maybe I need to warm it up.

308
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:06,547
Of course. My decoder ring has
to warm up all the time.

309
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:11,263
The house looked European.
Like a postcard from Italy.

310
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:13,058
Like that one.

311
00:41:13,308 --> 00:41:20,820
In fact, just like that one!
The bad guys are in there.

312
00:41:21,029 --> 00:41:26,120
- I think you should wear this.
- I have not earned it yet.

313
00:41:26,371 --> 00:41:32,506
You just solved the entire case
and revolutionised police training.

314
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:38,307
I have studied human character,
terrorist psyche, fingerprints.

315
00:41:38,557 --> 00:41:43,691
I have taken courses in surveillance,
hostage negotiation and psychology.

316
00:41:43,942 --> 00:41:46,446
And all I had to do was drive
around the neighbourhood -

317
00:41:46,696 --> 00:41:51,037
- and point at a house and say:
"The bad guys are in there."

318
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:53,374
Trying to be funny?

319
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:57,339
Yes. I am the famous comedian
Arnold Braunschweiger.

320
00:41:57,589 --> 00:42:02,556
<i>- Schwarzenegger.
- Gesundheit.</i>

321
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:16,871
May I help you?

322
00:42:17,122 --> 00:42:21,588
Yes. Could I speak to
the drug dealer of the house?

323
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:30,310
We are out killing drug dealers.
Do you have any in the house?

324
00:42:32,397 --> 00:42:36,863
Be ready for anything.

325
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:39,575
Where are you going?

326
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:44,124
I will be back.
You did not know I would say that.

327
00:42:44,374 --> 00:42:48,590
- You always say that.
- I do?

328
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:55,852
Everybody waits for you to say it.
It is like your calling card.

329
00:42:55,894 --> 00:42:59,441
You are interested in
drug dealers?

330
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:04,407
Jack, that is the henchman
with the glass eye.

331
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:10,084
- Are you a henchman?
- No, I only go as far as lackey.

332
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:13,924
- Anything else?
- Take off your sunglasses.

333
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:18,598
- Who is asking?
- The Tin Man.

334
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:23,982
- I suggest you hit the bricks.
- No. They are the wrong colour.

335
00:43:24,232 --> 00:43:31,661
Oh, dear. Let us change them.
Would arterial red suit you?

336
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:41,303
Make no mistake.
They are very well trained.

337
00:43:42,763 --> 00:43:49,608
I snap my fingers again and tomorrow
you emerge from several canine rectum.

338
00:43:49,816 --> 00:43:53,740
Or you and Toto can go back to Oz.
Questions?

339
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,164
Yes. Two of them.

340
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:02,086
Why am I wasting time on
a putz like you -

341
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:07,888
- when I could be doing something
dangerous like rearranging my socks?

342
00:44:08,138 --> 00:44:17,153
And how will you snap your fingers
after I rip off both your thumbs?

343
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:25,166
Have a nice day.

344
00:44:29,632 --> 00:44:38,605
He had one with a bull's-eye earlier.
He calls his boss a Sicilian schmuck.

345
00:44:52,086 --> 00:44:56,677
How did Slater find out?
Will you tell me?

346
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:02,019
I want him to join me, but he
keeps going after the bad guys.

347
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:05,859
Where is it written
that I am a bad guy?

348
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:13,121
Find out who talked and have
him killed. Then, Slater.

349
00:45:13,747 --> 00:45:19,130
- What is it with you?
- We should call off the funeral.

350
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:23,638
Are you crazy?
When I say blood bath, there is...

351
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:27,144
A blood bath.

352
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:34,239
I will find out more about
Slater's short friend.

353
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:39,790
- He must be guilty of something.
- Yes, of acting like an asshole.

354
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,128
If I arrest him,
I have to arrest Congress.

355
00:45:43,379 --> 00:45:46,802
- Why did your park there?
- In case my ex-wife is here.

356
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,891
She is not.
Her name was not in the credits.

357
00:45:51,141 --> 00:45:55,065
- Who does the doctor treat?
- Patients.

358
00:45:55,315 --> 00:45:59,155
- What is the elbow of my jacket doing?
- Wearing thin?

359
00:45:59,406 --> 00:46:02,411
Bingo!

360
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:05,874
That was a stretch.

361
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:11,676
- Do you drive this on the weekends?
- No, that is my girl's car.

362
00:46:11,926 --> 00:46:14,347
Knock on the door.

363
00:46:14,598 --> 00:46:21,817
Your ex-wife is not home.
Her name was not in the credits.

364
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,408
Meredith?

365
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:30,165
- I hope you mean Whitney.
- Sorry. Whitney.

366
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:35,131
You are not Skeezy, are you?

367
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:38,303
Daddy!

368
00:46:38,553 --> 00:46:42,560
- Stop it, Daddy!
- You have gained some weight.

369
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:48,195
Hi. I am Danny Madigan
and my life has not been long yet.

370
00:46:48,445 --> 00:46:53,787
But from now on,
it will all be downhill.

371
00:46:54,037 --> 00:46:55,623
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

372
00:46:55,874 --> 00:46:59,546
So, who is your friend?
He is cute.

373
00:46:59,797 --> 00:47:03,387
No, he is hopelessly insane.

374
00:47:03,637 --> 00:47:06,642
He probably loved you in
"Gone With the Wind".

375
00:47:06,892 --> 00:47:09,981
- This is her first movie.
- Do you see?

376
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:12,986
- Who is Skeezy?
- It is a sorority thing.

377
00:47:13,236 --> 00:47:16,825
They assign you a freshman
and when he comes by you kiss him.

378
00:47:17,075 --> 00:47:20,415
- Do you have to kiss him?
- Dad, come on!

379
00:47:20,665 --> 00:47:27,927
If the phone rings for me, I will be
out of the shower in less than an hour.

380
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:31,391
What a cutie.

381
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:36,274
That is old evidence.
Counterfeit case. Looks real, right?

382
00:47:36,524 --> 00:47:42,951
It turns funny colours when you
burn it. I used it for alimony.

383
00:47:50,047 --> 00:47:53,928
What is wrong?

384
00:47:57,392 --> 00:48:03,069
You do not happen to have
a cigar, do you?

385
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:10,455
"I will be back." I know.

386
00:48:27,985 --> 00:48:32,617
Dad! Dad!

387
00:49:04,754 --> 00:49:09,094
He would have been your age.

388
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:17,941
I know. The Ripper pulled him
down off the roof three years ago.

389
00:49:17,941 --> 00:49:24,870
- Your dad saw everything.
- How do you know all that?

390
00:49:25,037 --> 00:49:29,836
Your dad is in the papers a lot.
I like crime stories.

391
00:49:30,087 --> 00:49:35,930
- That is Skeezy.
- I will get rid of him.

392
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:45,570
Hello, Toto.

393
00:49:48,993 --> 00:49:53,250
There and there and there.

394
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:57,799
Let go of me!

395
00:49:59,928 --> 00:50:07,190
- Good evening. Is Uncle Jack here?
- He is off tracking a lead.

396
00:50:07,315 --> 00:50:11,238
Joe, would you teach her
the virtue of silence?

397
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:14,995
Benedict, if you harm
a hair on her head...

398
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:18,459
Stop!

399
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:38,075
You were saying?

400
00:50:39,285 --> 00:50:46,421
Now, I believe it was
Sherlock Holmes who said:

401
00:50:46,671 --> 00:50:49,927
"Eliminate all logical
solutions to a problem -

402
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:54,476
- and the illogical becomes
invariably true."

403
00:50:54,727 --> 00:51:03,199
I know your name is Daniel Madigan,
but how do you know mine?

404
00:51:04,535 --> 00:51:10,461
Slater showed me some mugshots.
We made your face easy.

405
00:51:10,711 --> 00:51:15,428
Daniel Madigan from New York.
A long way from home.

406
00:51:15,678 --> 00:51:18,808
- When did you get here?
- Just.

407
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:23,023
Then how do you know
what I said on the terrace?

408
00:51:23,274 --> 00:51:25,236
I heard a recording.

409
00:51:25,486 --> 00:51:30,911
- Are there microphones in the statues?
- You would not believe how many.

410
00:51:31,162 --> 00:51:36,254
- And the eye I was wearing?
- I saw it.

411
00:51:36,504 --> 00:51:40,511
I saw it in a movie. There were
micro-cameras in the statues.

412
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:48,191
I have killed people smarter
and younger than you.

413
00:51:54,785 --> 00:52:00,920
This is between you and Slater.
Take the money in the desk -

414
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:07,806
- and leave me and Meredith...
Whitney, alone.

415
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:13,899
Holy shit, boss.
It looks like two K in here.

416
00:52:14,149 --> 00:52:19,116
Just a minute. Give it to me.

417
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:33,014
These bills are marked, right?
You tried to sucker me with them.

418
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,061
Burn it.

419
00:52:36,311 --> 00:52:39,567
- Burn it?
- Yes, burn it.

420
00:52:39,817 --> 00:52:45,869
Do not play games with grown-ups.
You will get hurt.

421
00:53:06,236 --> 00:53:09,700
Big mistake.

422
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:31,194
Great, is it not?
I will hurt you a little bit.

423
00:53:31,444 --> 00:53:40,376
Freeze! Lose the guns or I redecorate
in brain matter grey. Got it?

424
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:45,717
Kill me and I will kill him.

425
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:54,232
Leave it. Get the door.

426
00:54:01,578 --> 00:54:04,833
Boss?

427
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:47,862
Do not give up your day job.

428
00:55:18,288 --> 00:55:21,876
Jack!

429
00:55:24,923 --> 00:55:29,389
Do not leave home without it.

430
00:55:37,235 --> 00:55:43,621
- Where are you going?
- I have to catch the red-eye.

431
00:55:52,302 --> 00:55:56,851
I do not believe this.
I am in the movie and...

432
00:55:57,101 --> 00:56:01,275
I am missing the action!

433
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:07,118
Get the hell out of here!

434
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:24,897
Back up the top!

435
00:56:30,782 --> 00:56:37,459
Next time we get thicker armour.
Like a tank.

436
00:56:55,906 --> 00:56:59,413
Chicken it is.

437
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:14,228
This is going to work.
It is a movie. I am a good guy.

438
00:57:16,983 --> 00:57:27,209
I am a comedy sidekick.
Oh, shit! It is not going to work!

439
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:59,262
- I think I scared them.
- You did great. Come on.

440
00:57:59,512 --> 00:58:01,473
Benedict has the ticket.

441
00:58:01,724 --> 00:58:07,817
Too bad.
I wanted it for my collection.

442
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:47,148
<i>You are travelling through
another dimension.</i>

443
00:59:47,398 --> 00:59:52,824
My name is Skeezy.
S-K-E-E-Z-Y.

444
01:00:39,317 --> 01:00:43,116
Say this.

445
01:00:45,161 --> 01:00:50,670
- Grow up.
- Just say this one word.

446
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:56,095
- Is it another movie proof?
- Maybe.

447
01:00:56,345 --> 01:01:01,688
- I do not want to say it.
- Say what?

448
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:08,742
You cannot say it, because
this movie is PG-13. Admit it.

449
01:01:08,992 --> 01:01:13,666
Slater. The guy with the missing eye,
I saw his licence plate.

450
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:17,422
Good for you.

451
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:25,770
- You mean the guy with the glass eye?
- No, when he ran it was missing.

452
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:29,943
It has got words.

453
01:01:30,277 --> 01:01:34,743
"Vengeance is..."

454
01:01:34,993 --> 01:01:37,288
No!

455
01:01:50,227 --> 01:01:54,024
Did you catch that?

456
01:02:00,285 --> 01:02:02,205
Some of it may be English.

457
01:02:02,455 --> 01:02:04,876
See if this is clear enough:

458
01:02:05,126 --> 01:02:10,594
Give me your badge!
And you will not get it back.

459
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:26,203
Wohlschläger, team up with
the digitalised Humphrey Bogart.

460
01:02:35,509 --> 01:02:38,640
Are you making some changes?

461
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:43,857
Why not come and work the funeral
with me? I would not miss it.

462
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:49,407
Torelli has spent a bundle. He has
a helicopter circling the building.

463
01:02:49,658 --> 01:02:53,331
A rooftop funeral in Long Beach.
How is that for taste?

464
01:02:53,581 --> 01:02:57,505
- Who died?
- Leo the Fart. Shot yesterday.

465
01:02:57,755 --> 01:03:00,426
Somebody tried for Torelli
and missed.

466
01:03:00,677 --> 01:03:06,269
Leo was tough. Only he could not
sneak up on you.

467
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:13,197
If you change your mind,
I will be in front of the hotel.

468
01:03:29,015 --> 01:03:34,482
- Where are we, anyway?
- Home.

469
01:03:47,503 --> 01:03:49,841
How did you know
there was a guy in there?

470
01:03:50,091 --> 01:03:55,308
There always is. It costs me
a fortune in closet doors.

471
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:58,689
Like in "Slater II -
The Sagittarius Strangler".

472
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:03,781
Soon you will meet the Madigan
Strangler. I just got fired.

473
01:04:04,031 --> 01:04:10,583
What you find so entertaining is my life.
I am not even a cop anymore.

474
01:04:10,834 --> 01:04:16,343
He only took your badge, because you
destroyed more of the city than usual.

475
01:04:16,593 --> 01:04:22,979
Jack, you are everybody's hero.
It will all be okay again. Trust me.

476
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:30,826
No, Danny. It is getting harder.
I only wanted to be a decent cop.

477
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:35,082
But I kept getting involved
in crazy adventures.

478
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:39,131
But the craziest part is,
I kept surviving.

479
01:04:39,381 --> 01:04:45,683
These are the sequels.
They have to get harder.

480
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:49,940
Look on the good side.
You have a great daughter.

481
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:54,364
And your ex-wife would not call
if she did not want you back.

482
01:04:54,615 --> 01:04:58,830
Do you think she cannot tell
the real voice from a taped one?

483
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:06,509
I pay a cashier to call me at work,
so the guys think I have a life.

484
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:12,186
My ex-wife is happily remarried.
She never calls.

485
01:05:12,436 --> 01:05:17,611
And Whitney. Why can she not be
a normal teenager?

486
01:05:17,861 --> 01:05:22,535
On prom night she stays home
to field strip an AK-47.

487
01:05:22,786 --> 01:05:29,297
She will die a young maid.
I am going to buy it soon, too.

488
01:05:29,547 --> 01:05:35,474
No way. You cannot die
until the grosses go down.

489
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:39,773
Vivaldi said something would
happen at a funeral.

490
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:43,320
We should look into
this funeral.

491
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,198
Whatever.

492
01:05:45,448 --> 01:05:49,539
Jack, it is a funeral
for a guy named Fart.

493
01:05:49,789 --> 01:05:51,333
Funeral?

494
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:58,262
Someone tried to kill Torelli,
but hit Leo the Fart instead, right?

495
01:05:58,512 --> 01:06:06,191
Wrong. Did Benedict take the shot?
Most likely. Would he miss? No way.

496
01:06:06,442 --> 01:06:11,826
- Unless he wanted to miss.
- Did he mean to miss? Why?

497
01:06:12,076 --> 01:06:16,959
Because Leo the Fart was
very, very fat. Get it?

498
01:06:17,209 --> 01:06:18,628
No, I do not.

499
01:06:18,879 --> 01:06:23,345
They broke in, cut Leo open
and stuffed him with T.N.T.

500
01:06:23,595 --> 01:06:29,813
He goes off at the funeral and
takes out the whole Torelli mob.

501
01:06:30,064 --> 01:06:35,198
That is what this is all about.
Vivaldi will blow up that funeral.

502
01:06:35,448 --> 01:06:40,039
It would not be a bomb. We have had
a dozen explosions in this movie.

503
01:06:40,289 --> 01:06:43,461
Do not start that again.

504
01:06:43,711 --> 01:06:46,132
- Nerve gas!
- What are you talking about?

505
01:06:46,383 --> 01:06:50,348
Some nerve gas has been stolen
from military trucks.

506
01:06:50,598 --> 01:06:55,690
They could have put it inside him.
Do you know what that means?

507
01:06:55,940 --> 01:07:01,199
Leo the Fart will pass gas
one more time.

508
01:07:14,011 --> 01:07:15,472
Mr. Torelli.

509
01:07:15,723 --> 01:07:21,023
I hope it is all right I am here.
I do not want to be a fourth wheel.

510
01:07:21,274 --> 01:07:25,071
Fifth wheel.

511
01:07:26,449 --> 01:07:34,336
Did you hear that, Benedict?
Family. Go pay your respects.
