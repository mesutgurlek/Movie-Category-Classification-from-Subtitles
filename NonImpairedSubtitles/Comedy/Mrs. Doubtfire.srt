1
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,237
Salutations, snack.

2
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:24,604
On second thought...

3
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,875
9-1-1!

4
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:31,987
Police! Civic authorities! ASPCA! ASAP!

5
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:34,682
Murder! Betrayal! Kidnapped!

6
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:36,451
No, birdnapped!

7
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:40,425
A cup of garlic, a twist of parakeet.

8
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,021
Eat your heart out, Julia Child.

9
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,595
Excuse me, but isn't it customary
for the jailbird to get one telephone call?

10
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:51,733
In your case, I think not.

11
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,469
Afternoon snacks have few civil liberties.

12
00:01:54,577 --> 00:01:56,670
But I'm not wholly without heart.

13
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:59,479
How about a nice soothing cigarette?

14
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:08,153
Oh, I will not do this. I cannot!

15
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:12,687
Oh, what a foul way for a bird to die!
I don't want to get beak cancer.

16
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:15,289
No! My lungs are blackened!

17
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:18,094
Here we go again. Cut, cut, cut! Roll it back.

18
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:20,863
- Help me...
- What are you doing? Daniel...

19
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:23,871
That line is not in the script.
Why did you add it?

20
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:27,443
- I wanted to comment on the situation.
- What situation?

21
00:02:27,777 --> 00:02:31,713
Shoving a cigarette into Pudgie's mouth
is morally irresponsible.

22
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:35,648
This is a cartoon,
not a friggin' Oprah Winfrey Special.

23
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:39,848
Lou, millions of kids see this cartoon.
It's like telling them "Light up."

24
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:43,653
You can't put words in Pudgie's mouth
if his mouth isn't moving.

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,389
It's voice-over. An interior monologue.
Maybe even the voice of God.

26
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,531
Pudgie, don't smoke.

27
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:53,727
- Actors.
- What? Let's ask the technicians.

28
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:58,000
Do you think it's morally right
to promote smoking to the youth of America?

29
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,747
- They're biased. That's a mistrial.
- This session costs the studio thousands.

30
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:08,544
If you want a paycheck, stick to the script.

31
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:12,678
If you want to play Gandhi,
then do it on somebody else's time.

32
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:21,560
Then I've got to do what I've got to do.

33
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:24,565
That's very funny.
Where the hell are you goin'?

34
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,295
If you leave, you're not comin' back in.

35
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:30,338
I'm not takin' any crap from you, pal.

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,500
Well, in the words of Porky Pig:

37
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:38,138
Piss off, Lou.

38
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:13,346
- So what about that history test?
- Don't ask.

39
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,287
- Did you have fun in school?
- I painted a picture of a rainbow.

40
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:24,158
- Dad?
- Daddy!

41
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:26,619
Daddy!

42
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:34,197
- I thought you couldn't pick us up.
- Well, I got off early.

43
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:38,797
- You mean you got fired?
- No, I quit. For reasons of conscience.

44
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:39,875
Actors.

45
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:46,107
Dude, congratulations
on your 12th birthday. Got a surprise for ya.

46
00:04:46,282 --> 00:04:48,307
- A stripper?
- Ooh, please!

47
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:50,281
- Two strippers?
- Hoo-hah, boy!

48
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,717
- A party?
- Yes!

49
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:53,879
No. No parties.

50
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:57,584
Mom said you couldn't have one
because of your report card.

51
00:04:57,693 --> 00:05:02,653
Mom's not gonna be
home for another four hours, is she?

52
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,036
Prepare yourself... for the wild kingdom.

53
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:32,820
Coming up toward the very end.
There she goes. And she wins that race.

54
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,954
Come on off now. Here we go.

55
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:38,891
You want to feed him?

56
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:42,428
See if this guy will.

57
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:44,901
Sorry.

58
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,335
Get out!

59
00:06:15,238 --> 00:06:19,174
<i>- Gregory, Henderson and Hillard.</i>
- Miranda Hillard, please.

60
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:26,371
I know what you're going for with these
murals, but perhaps if they weren't so large.

61
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:29,178
And let's do steel windows, not wood.

62
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:33,277
Eliminate the Oriental rug.
Let's try an Aubusson carpet.

63
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,890
- More pink than red.
- Good idea.

64
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:38,017
Union Square Inn. This is better.

65
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:43,360
More Arts and Crafts. A Dirk Van Erp lamp,
a Stickley chair. Don't be seduced by chintz.

66
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:46,230
Excuse me. Miranda,
can I speak to you for a minute?

67
00:06:46,402 --> 00:06:48,632
- Yes. Excuse me.
- Certainly.

68
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:50,796
Just be one minute.

69
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,841
I just got off the phone
with a Stuart Dunmeyer.

70
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:58,538
- Stuart Dunmeyer?
- He said you were acquaintances.

71
00:06:58,648 --> 00:06:59,945
Stuart Dunmeyer?

72
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:04,179
He's putting millions into restoring
the old Wellman mansion on Nob Hill.

73
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:09,247
- He wants to make it into a $500-a-night B&B.
- Yes, I read about it.

74
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:12,451
- He's been doing very well.
- That's him.

75
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:16,031
And he specifically asked for you, Miranda.

76
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:17,723
He did?

77
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,927
- I told him you'd call first thing tomorrow.
- Yes, I will.

78
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:25,529
Miss Hillard? The operator
has a Gloria Chaney on hold.

79
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:28,940
- She says it's an emergency.
- Excuse me.

80
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:31,545
Gloria?

81
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:46,960
- Oh, my God!
- Is this your residence, ma'am?

82
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:49,088
Yes, I'm sorry to say it is.

83
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:53,362
Are you aware it's illegal to possess
barnyard animals in a residential area?

84
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:57,404
- What if you're married to one?
- We're also responding to a noise violation.

85
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,840
I'm going to respond myself.
I'm awfully sorry about this.

86
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:04,003
You ate my begonias! God!

87
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:07,473
Get out of my way!

88
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:08,466
Miranda! Whassup?

89
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:11,310
You're home early, girlfriend.

90
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:13,848
Havin' a birthday in the house.

91
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,517
What the hell is going on around here?

92
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:19,246
Don't get mad, honey. Listen.

93
00:09:19,355 --> 00:09:24,122
You're home a little early. I was gonna
clean it all up before you got home.

94
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:29,295
Honey... What are you looking for?

95
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,864
I'd be careful. That pony had a lot of water.

96
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:44,875
Party's over.

97
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:52,112
She called you
and you bust the birthday party. Great!

98
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:55,918
Don't you dare
make me out to be the monster here, Daniel!

99
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,687
You have all the fun
and I get whatever's left over.

100
00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:03,163
- You chose the career.
- I have no choices here. I have no choices!

101
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:06,723
Even when I try to do something fun,
you do it ten times bigger!

102
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:10,533
I bring home a cake and gifts.
You bring the goddamn San Diego Zoo!

103
00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:14,769
- And I have to clean up!
- It's not toxic waste, just a few party plates!

104
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:17,846
Why am I the only one
that feels there has to be rules?

105
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,312
Why do you always
make me out to be the heavy?

106
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,180
I don't. You do it yourself quite naturally.

107
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:27,119
- You set me up every time to be the bad guy.
- Oh, lighten up, will ya?

108
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:31,523
You spend too much time with
those corporate clones you used to despise.

109
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:34,460
I spend too much time with you, Daniel.
It's over!

110
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:36,622
It's over.

111
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:43,336
Come on, Miranda. We've got problems,
but who doesn't? We could work 'em out.

112
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:47,335
We've been trying to work them out
for 14 years.

113
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:52,244
Come on, please. Listen.
Maybe we need some help, OK?

114
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:55,441
Maybe a family therapist
will help us do this together.

115
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:57,575
It's too late for that.

116
00:10:57,686 --> 00:11:02,248
Well, let's take a vacation with the kids,
as a family. Get you away from work.

117
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:05,758
You're a different person.
You really are. You're great.

118
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:09,297
Our problems would be waiting for us
when we got back.

119
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:12,799
We'll move, and hopefully
our problems won't follow us.

120
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:15,097
Daniel, please don'tjoke.

121
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:18,373
OK.

122
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:25,046
We've just grown apart. We're different.

123
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:29,243
- We have nothing in common.
- Oh, sure we do. We love each other.

124
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:38,585
Come on, Miranda. We love each other.

125
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:45,324
Don't we?

126
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:51,631
I want a divorce.

127
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:55,100
No.

128
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,681
We can't. We're a family. You know?

129
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:08,614
I'm so sorry.

130
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,489
Yeah, Ma, he told me all about it.

131
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,959
Yeah, Ma. I heard, I heard.

132
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:58,707
- Well, yeah, he's here.
- No.

133
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:02,336
Ma, he's not really in the mood to talk.

134
00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:05,902
Yeah, depressed.
I mean, his marriage is ending.

135
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:10,213
My marriage is not ending. It's just on hiatus.

136
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:15,354
Ma, I think he's in a little bit of denial.

137
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:19,120
No, we're taking good care of your little boy.
Don't worry, Mom.

138
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:22,561
- Hi, Evelyn. Thanks for the jam.
- She says you're welcome.

139
00:13:22,665 --> 00:13:26,101
That beige concealer.
When are we gettin' more of it?

140
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,829
- Next week.
- You hear that, Ma? Next week.

141
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:30,733
Wait, hang on.

142
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,569
- Enough already. It's a man.
- How would you know?

143
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:35,371
Bitch.

144
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:38,810
No, Ma, not you. I was talkin' about the dog.

145
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:42,545
Ma, listen. We got people
waitin' for us on the set.

146
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:46,417
Oh, yeah. It's a busy life, Ma.
Places to go, faces to paint.

147
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:49,056
Yeah, I'll tell him, Ma.

148
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:50,988
Don't worry, I'll tell him.

149
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:52,560
Yeah. Hold on, Ma.

150
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:55,730
She wants to know
if you want to come stay with her.

151
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:59,631
- No way.
- He says he'll think about it, Ma.

152
00:14:00,469 --> 00:14:02,596
I will. All right. I love you, too.

153
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,764
Bye, Ma.

154
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:10,037
Hey, listen, you know you can always
stay with us just as long as you want.

155
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:14,548
Thank you, but I'm OK, really.
I mean, this is just a temporary thing.

156
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,380
I know Miranda. It's gonna blow over.

157
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:27,791
Mr and Mrs Hillard, although these custody
proceedings tend to favor the mother,

158
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:33,198
we also realize, perhaps now more than
ever, that it is not in a child's best interest

159
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:36,465
to deprive him or her
of an obviously loving father.

160
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:44,903
However, since at the present time Mr Hillard
has no place to live and no employment,

161
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,176
it is the court's ruling
to award sole custody to Mrs Hillard.

162
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:51,514
- Congratulations.
- No.

163
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:55,181
Mr Hillard will have visitation rights
every Saturday.

164
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,656
- Can't you do something?
- He's made his decision.

165
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,093
Isn't it traditional
to say "I object" or something?

166
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,925
Your Honor, please.

167
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:06,496
Every Saturday? That's one day a week.

168
00:15:06,635 --> 00:15:08,933
That's not enough.

169
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:14,236
I have to be with my children. It's not
a question. I have to be with them, sir. Please.

170
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:17,835
I know it seems like a lot,
but for me it's not enough. Really.

171
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:22,645
I haven't been away from 'em for more than
one day since the day they were born.

172
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:26,619
- Mr Hillard, this ruling is only temporary.
- Oh, good.

173
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:29,885
I will assign a court liaison
to oversee your case.

174
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:33,291
There will be a continuance
of these proceedings in 90 days.

175
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:36,330
- I'm giving you three months, Mr Hillard.
- Thank you.

176
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:41,061
Three months in which to get ajob,
keep it and create a suitable home.

177
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:43,763
If this proves to be a possibility for you,

178
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:49,708
I will consider ajoint-custody arrangement
when we reconvene. We're adjourned.

179
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:54,647
Well, it looks like there is
a little light at the end of our tunnel.

180
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:28,680
- That's all my stuff.
- This is all my fault.

181
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,586
God, no. Why would you think that?

182
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,211
I should have never had a birthday, Dad.

183
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:37,223
- This never would have happened.
- Yes, it would.

184
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:40,590
It was an accident waiting to happen, OK?

185
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:43,220
You did nothing wrong. You got that?

186
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,492
OK, gimme five.

187
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:55,167
You're the man of the house now.

188
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:57,369
Don't be messy.

189
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:01,573
- You can't go now.
- Honey, I have to.

190
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:06,951
We're in the middle of <i>Charlotte's Web.</i>
Who's gonna finish it?

191
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:10,114
Well, Grandma will finish it for you.

192
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:17,055
She's not as good. She always skips parts,
and she never does the voices.

193
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,258
She smells funny, too.

194
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:23,527
That's the formaldehyde.
That's why Granny's so well preserved.

195
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:27,407
Hey, come here.

196
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:33,744
It's the same as always.
We just have a really big backyard, OK?

197
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:36,818
- I love you.
- I love you.

198
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:44,024
I'll miss you. Saturday comes real quick.

199
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:48,892
- I'll miss you.
- Ditto.

200
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:51,227
Oh, Dad...

201
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:55,627
- Take care of her.
- OK.

202
00:17:57,873 --> 00:17:59,898
Goodbye.

203
00:18:05,113 --> 00:18:07,604
Thanks for the time, warden.

204
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:15,014
Bye, Dad.

205
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,768
As your court liaison,
I will be looking at two things.

206
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:43,112
- Your living environment...
- It's more like a habitat, really.

207
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:49,856
And I will be coming by on Monday
and Friday evenings to inspect it.

208
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,926
Well, I'll put on a chicken.

209
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:54,787
And there's always the job issue.

210
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:00,527
This is the nearest employment office. I took
the liberty of making an appointment for you.

211
00:19:00,636 --> 00:19:04,333
- Thank you.
- By the way, do you have any special skills?

212
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:06,531
Oh, yes. I do.

213
00:19:06,642 --> 00:19:08,667
I do voices.

214
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:11,372
What do you mean, you do voices?

215
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,580
Well, I do voices.

216
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:15,614
Yes!

217
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:18,584
We're looking for intelligent life.
Oops, mistake!

218
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,985
Happy to be in America.
Don't ask for a green card.

219
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:24,592
I want you in the worst way.

220
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:28,423
This is certainly a rough meeting.
It's not going very well for me.

221
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:32,192
Hey, boss, give her a chance.
She's gonna loosen up any moment.

222
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:36,236
Look at me, Moneypenny.
I want to undo that bow and get to know you.

223
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:38,805
I'm crazy to make a deal with you!

224
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:41,774
Nancy and I are still looking for
the other half of my head.

225
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:45,643
They're doin' it! I'm sittin' on a gold mine!

226
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:48,147
Don't make me smack you, sweetheart.

227
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:51,146
I do a great impression of a hot dog.

228
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:56,950
Mr Hillard, do you
consider yourself humorous?

229
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,118
I used to.

230
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:02,355
There was a time when I found myself funny.

231
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:05,592
But today you have proven me wrong.
Thank you.

232
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:09,996
Listen, bottom line...

233
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:14,673
I need to be with my children,
and I'll do anything to do that.

234
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,835
You just tell me what to do.

235
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:37,429
- Excuse me. You Tony?
- That's me.

236
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:40,467
Hi. I'm Daniel Hillard, the actor.

237
00:20:42,004 --> 00:20:44,666
Follow me.

238
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:50,475
Oh, films! Will I be
introducing these movies on air?

239
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:53,045
- Not exactly.
- What do I do?

240
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:56,379
You take all these cans.
You box 'em and you ship 'em.

241
00:20:56,485 --> 00:21:00,080
Then you box those cans over there.
Ship them. Then more will come in.

242
00:21:00,522 --> 00:21:03,082
You box those, you ship those.

243
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:05,250
Any questions?

244
00:21:06,428 --> 00:21:08,487
After you box 'em...?

245
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,825
You ship 'em.

246
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:12,991
Lots of luck, smartass.

247
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:19,505
I think I made a friend.

248
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:28,848
- Miranda.
- Stu!

249
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:36,623
Hello, Miranda.

250
00:21:36,758 --> 00:21:39,420
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

251
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:46,262
Mr Dunmeyer's come by
to look over your sketches.

252
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:51,231
Let me show you to the conference room.

253
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:55,170
As you probably know,
the estate was built in 1876.

254
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,770
These sketches are meant to reflect
your desire to have it completely restored.

255
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:01,883
You look better than ever.

256
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:07,444
The lobby will resemble a music salon with
inspiration from the French Second Empire.

257
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:10,457
I was thinking a 17th-century grand piano...

258
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,120
I've been following your career
these past couple of years.

259
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:19,132
A tufted sofa, a Flemish tapestry,
a brass-bound Regency-style table...

260
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:22,965
I'd love to get reacquainted. Catch up.

261
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:26,772
Mantel clocks.

262
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:29,706
Fringed, upholstered chairs, heavy drapes.

263
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:32,405
Can we talk? Over dinner, maybe?

264
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:37,685
Stuart, thank you. I...

265
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:40,947
I'm at the beginning of a divorce.

266
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:44,516
It just didn't work out.

267
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:47,959
- Oh, Miranda, I'm sorry.
- You don't have to say that.

268
00:22:48,063 --> 00:22:52,693
No, really. I mean, I never
held any grudges or anything. I just...

269
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:56,031
Well, I always hoped you'd find happiness.

270
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:58,630
Oh, God, that's so nice.

271
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:03,142
I was just worried my coming in here
might scare you off the project.

272
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:05,304
No, no. Of course not. I...

273
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:08,612
I'm a professional. I'm...

274
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,949
I was flattered that you thought of me
after all these years and everything.

275
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:16,649
Yeah, everything.

276
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,988
Well... Ancient history.

277
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:22,358
Yeah.

278
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:30,066
I'm late. I've got a meeting over at the bank.

279
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,670
Can we talk maybe later in the week?

280
00:23:36,811 --> 00:23:39,575
- Sure.
- Good.

281
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:42,172
It's good to see you again.

282
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:06,365
Good, huh?

283
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,571
I know the place
doesn't look like much now, but...

284
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:15,172
It'll be OK. How do you like it?

285
00:24:16,651 --> 00:24:19,119
- Nice.
- It's OK.

286
00:24:19,254 --> 00:24:21,222
Detestable.

287
00:24:22,557 --> 00:24:24,650
Hey, just give me some time.

288
00:24:25,126 --> 00:24:28,027
I'm not too comfortable
with this new lifestyle.

289
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:30,029
Neither are we.

290
00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:33,056
I know it's hard, sweetie.

291
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:36,668
Can't you just tell Mom you're sorry?

292
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:41,642
Wish I could.

293
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:44,075
You know, grown-up problems...

294
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:47,012
They're a little more complicated, Nattie.

295
00:24:50,252 --> 00:24:52,447
How is the old battle-axe?

296
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:55,454
- Your mom.
- She's fine.

297
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:58,048
Oh. I'm glad to hear that.

298
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:04,029
I'd hate to think that she came down
with amoebic dysentery or piles.

299
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:06,362
What's amoebic dysentery?

300
00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:10,695
It's an infection in your tummy
where you get diarrhoea for ever.

301
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:14,707
- Diarrhoea for ever?
- And your body dries up and you die.

302
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:18,074
- You die?
- You don't have to be so graphic with her.

303
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:23,640
- I read about it in a science book.
- Why would you want Mommy to die?

304
00:25:24,152 --> 00:25:27,121
Oh, honey, I don't want Mommy to die.

305
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:30,156
Then why did you say that?

306
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:36,461
Look, Dad, you're not trying very hard.

307
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:40,728
We only get to come here once a week.
That's not very much.

308
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:44,566
You're right. I'm sorry. I'll try harder.

309
00:25:45,707 --> 00:25:49,473
Nattie, I'll think good thoughts, OK?

310
00:25:49,778 --> 00:25:54,477
- About Mommy?
- I'll try. I really will.

311
00:25:54,582 --> 00:25:58,484
- And call her a princess.
- Oh, yes.

312
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:03,282
And right now I feel like a toad.

313
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:06,757
Daddy's a toad.

314
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:16,929
- That's Mom.
- Can't be. She's an hour early.

315
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:19,398
Come on, Nattie, we gotta go.

316
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,334
No, no! Come on, sit down.

317
00:26:22,444 --> 00:26:24,173
Sit down!

318
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:27,510
You don't have to run off
when she honks the horn.

319
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:30,311
Come on, you're on my time now.

320
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:33,410
You're my goddamn kids, too!

321
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,424
Come on.

322
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:51,532
Hi.

323
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:54,808
Oh, Daniel... Charming.

324
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:58,572
Thank you, Miranda.
I was going for a refugee motif.

325
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,046
Fleeing-my-homeland kind of thing.

326
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:03,214
But look at you!

327
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:08,085
This lovely <i>Dances With Wolves</i> motif.
What's your Indian name: Shops With A Fist?

328
00:27:08,423 --> 00:27:11,824
- Are my children ready yet?
- No, our children are not ready yet...

329
00:27:11,926 --> 00:27:16,056
...because you are an hour early
and you were late dropping them off.

330
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:22,067
Daniel, I don't have time for this. I have to
drop something off at the newspaper office.

331
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:25,434
Newspaper? Are you taking out
one of those personal ads?

332
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,239
"DWF seeks WWM with BMW,
into light B&D"?

333
00:27:30,478 --> 00:27:32,776
I'm placing an ad for a housekeeper.

334
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:37,280
Housekeeper?
Why do you need a housekeeper?

335
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:43,051
I need someone to be there when the children
get home from school, to clean, start dinner...

336
00:27:43,158 --> 00:27:46,525
- How much are you gonna pay?
- $300 a week. Is that all right?

337
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:51,896
May I see the ad?

338
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:56,868
- I have a right as their father. Please?
- All right. Anything else you wanna see?

339
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:59,633
- Are you offering?
- Not any more.

340
00:27:59,741 --> 00:28:01,265
What's the change?

341
00:28:01,376 --> 00:28:04,345
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah, Mommy. We're fine.

342
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,505
Miranda, why not let me
take care of the kids?

343
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:13,485
I'll pick 'em up after school, be with them,
then drop them off at your house after work.

344
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:15,146
- That'd be great!
- Please!

345
00:28:15,323 --> 00:28:17,951
- Look. The kids love it.
- Mommy, please!

346
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:20,652
I'll think about it.

347
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:27,834
We're his goddamn kids, too.

348
00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:34,439
Kids say the darndest things.

349
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:41,046
Thank you. Any other choice phrases
you'd like to teach our five-year-old, Daniel?

350
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:45,452
Come on, everybody get their coats.

351
00:28:45,553 --> 00:28:48,886
- Put them on and let's get out of here.
- OK, Mom.

352
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,484
I would say go to the bathroom before we go,
but I don't think that's a good idea.

353
00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:00,935
Don't forget anything.
I don't wanna come back.

354
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:03,060
Come on, let's go.

355
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:06,598
- See you Saturday.
- Say goodbye to your father.

356
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:08,766
Goodbye, Daddy.

357
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:12,809
- Here's your ad.
- I'll get my purse.

358
00:29:12,947 --> 00:29:14,972
Yeah, you'd better.

359
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:32,891
Hello. Are you calling
in response to the ad?

360
00:29:34,602 --> 00:29:39,005
- Who was your previous employer?
<i>- I was in a band. Severe Tyre Damage.</i>

361
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,631
- In a band?
- I just wanna know one thing.

362
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:46,839
Are your kids well-behaved, or do they need,
like, a few light slams every now and then?

363
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:50,613
- I'll have to get back to you.
<i>- Wow!</i>

364
00:29:53,888 --> 00:29:58,791
<i>Ja,</i> my name is llsa Himmelman. I want
to know how many children do you have?

365
00:29:58,893 --> 00:30:02,420
- I have two girls and a boy.
<i>- Oh, a boy!</i>

366
00:30:02,564 --> 00:30:06,227
I don't work with the males
cos I used to be one.

367
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,164
Yikes.

368
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,365
Hello.

369
00:30:16,044 --> 00:30:20,743
Leyla, get back in your cell!
Don't make me get the hose!

370
00:30:20,848 --> 00:30:21,837
Hello?

371
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:29,756
I am job.

372
00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:34,855
- Do you speak English?
- I am job.

373
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:38,097
I'm sorry. The position has been filled.

374
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:40,700
Oh, what a nightmare!

375
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:45,231
Let's go in for the kill.

376
00:30:53,848 --> 00:30:56,043
Hello?

377
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,244
I'm calling in regards
to the ad I read in the paper.

378
00:31:01,356 --> 00:31:05,258
Yes. Well, would you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

379
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,619
Oh, certainly, dear.

380
00:31:07,729 --> 00:31:12,689
For the past 15 years I've worked for
the Smythe family of Elbourne, England.

381
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,859
That's Smythe, not Smith, dear.

382
00:31:15,536 --> 00:31:22,271
<i>And for them, I did housecleaning, cooking,</i>
<i>and took care of their four glorious children.</i>

383
00:31:22,377 --> 00:31:27,610
<i>I grew quite attached to them after 15</i>
<i>years, but they grew up, as children tend to.</i>

384
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:32,846
Oh, but listen to me. I am going on when you
should be telling me about your little ones.

385
00:31:32,954 --> 00:31:36,048
- Well, I have two girls...
<i>- Oh, two precious gems.</i>

386
00:31:36,157 --> 00:31:38,318
<i>No doubt the jewel of your eye.</i>

387
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:42,725
- And one boy.
- Oh, the little prince. How wonderful.

388
00:31:43,264 --> 00:31:46,256
I must tell you,
a little light cooking is required.

389
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,336
Oh, I don't mind that, dear.
I'd love some heavy cooking.

390
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,930
But I do have one rule: They'll only eat
good, nutritious food with me.

391
00:31:54,075 --> 00:31:58,273
And if there's any dispute, it's either
good, wholesome food or empty tummies.

392
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:01,280
That's my rule.
I hope it's not too harsh for you, dear.

393
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:03,678
No!

394
00:32:03,785 --> 00:32:08,051
Would you mind coming on an interview?
Say, Monday night at 7.30?

395
00:32:08,156 --> 00:32:10,954
- Oh, I'd love to, dear.
<i>- Wonderful.</i>

396
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:15,986
I'm at 2640 Steiner Street.

397
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,325
Steiner. Oh, how lovely.

398
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,495
- Could you tell me your name?
- My name?

399
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:25,731
I thought I gave it to you, dear.

400
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,273
No.

401
00:32:32,146 --> 00:32:34,774
- Doubtfire.
- I beg your pardon?

402
00:32:35,116 --> 00:32:38,279
Doubtfire, dear. Mrs Doubtfire.

403
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:42,880
- Well, I look forward to meeting you.
- Oh, lovely, dear. Me, too.

404
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,424
- Bye-bye.
- Ta-ta.

405
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,155
Showtime.

406
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,137
- Daniel, hi.
- Could you make me a woman?

407
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:03,501
Honey, I'm so happy!

408
00:33:03,611 --> 00:33:06,205
- Oh, come here.
- I knew you'd understand.

409
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:11,245
- Is this gonna hurt?
- Don't whine. Just relax.

410
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:14,320
- Are you sure?
- Just remember, pain is beauty.

411
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:18,188
OK, take a deep breath. Instant eye lift.

412
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:21,988
And the strings are under the wig.

413
00:33:22,497 --> 00:33:27,730
- The man has five-o'clock shadow at 8.30am.
- All right, we'll start with make-up.

414
00:33:27,835 --> 00:33:31,362
- I'm not gonna wax.
- Don't worry. We'll just lightly spackle.

415
00:33:31,472 --> 00:33:34,964
- I feel like Gloria Swanson.
- You look like her mother.

416
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:37,837
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr DeMille.

417
00:33:38,813 --> 00:33:42,146
OK, everyone. Let's pray.

418
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:48,950
I hope you are using Jungle Red.
That is the color I love.

419
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,081
- Matches your lips.
- God bless you.

420
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:54,558
I'm feeling fabulous
because I met this beautiful Cuban.

421
00:33:54,662 --> 00:33:57,062
Every night is like the Bay of Pigs.

422
00:33:57,198 --> 00:34:00,099
I can't lie to you. It's beautiful with him.

423
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:04,898
I don't know. This would scare the children.
Maybe this is too much for them.

424
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:07,771
I think we have to go to the next level.

425
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:09,672
Latex.

426
00:34:10,645 --> 00:34:13,273
<i>Oy,</i> it was such a <i>shandeh.</i>

427
00:34:13,414 --> 00:34:16,906
I should never buy <i>gribbenes</i> from a <i>mohel.</i>
It's so chewy.

428
00:34:17,051 --> 00:34:20,282
- No, I feel like Bubbee. This is not working.
- Don't worry.

429
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:24,881
It's a work in progress and you're my brother.
I will never let you be embarrassed.

430
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:27,517
- God bless you.
- We'll have to do the entire face.

431
00:34:27,662 --> 00:34:30,130
But look at this nice thing we have here.

432
00:34:50,651 --> 00:34:52,642
It's not working. I need to go older.

433
00:34:52,753 --> 00:34:56,450
Older? Like Shelley Winters older
or Shirley MacLaine older?

434
00:34:56,557 --> 00:35:00,049
- What's the difference?
- Some Scotch tape and red hair dye.

435
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:03,858
- What about Joan Collins?
- I don't think I have the strength.

436
00:35:03,965 --> 00:35:06,024
But I have some plaster.

437
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,321
Are we close?

438
00:36:11,432 --> 00:36:14,765
Any closer and you'd be Mom.

439
00:36:30,851 --> 00:36:32,910
That's disgusting!

440
00:36:34,655 --> 00:36:37,715
The most revolting thing I've ever seen.

441
00:36:37,825 --> 00:36:39,588
Awesome.

442
00:36:41,762 --> 00:36:43,855
What is this? Turn it off, will you?

443
00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:47,330
Come on. I want you
to meet this lady with me.

444
00:36:47,435 --> 00:36:50,996
I want you to be polite to her, then...
tell me what you think.

445
00:36:51,105 --> 00:36:55,439
Everybody stand over here
and help me decide what to do.

446
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:02,772
Hello. Mrs Hillard, I presume.

447
00:37:02,883 --> 00:37:05,010
Yes. I'm Miranda Hillard.

448
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,417
Euphegenia Doubtfire.

449
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:09,853
Yes. Won't you please come in?

450
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:12,391
Thank you, dear.

451
00:37:12,994 --> 00:37:15,895
- And these must be the cherubs.
- Yes.

452
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:20,058
- This is Natalie.
- Oh, hello, Natalie.

453
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:22,431
- Are you wearing bug spray?
- Nattie!

454
00:37:22,536 --> 00:37:27,166
It's quite all right, dear. No offense taken.
I was a little liberal with the atomizer.

455
00:37:27,274 --> 00:37:31,506
And at my age, it's like a good Stilton.
Everything has its own aroma.

456
00:37:31,645 --> 00:37:36,082
I admire that honesty, Nattie.
That's a noble quality. Never lose that.

457
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:39,880
It often disappears with age
or entering politics.

458
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:43,718
Look at that face.
You remind me of Stuart Little,

459
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:47,294
one of the most honorable creatures
in all of literature.

460
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:51,694
- Do you know that book, <i>Stuart Little?</i>
- Yeah! It's one of my favorites.

461
00:37:51,832 --> 00:37:55,734
Mine, too! Maybe I could read it to you -
if I get the position.

462
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:59,271
- That would be wonderful.
- And who is this strapping young lad?

463
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:01,637
- This is Chris.
- Hello, Christopher.

464
00:38:01,742 --> 00:38:03,539
Hello.

465
00:38:03,677 --> 00:38:07,443
Jeez, you're big for a lady.
You could play for the 49ers.

466
00:38:07,548 --> 00:38:11,450
Well, I was a fullback.
But that's European football, dear.

467
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:14,020
- Soccer?
- Yes. You play soccer, too?

468
00:38:14,155 --> 00:38:16,350
- Yeah!
- Oh, isn't that amazing?

469
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:21,018
Yes, I was captain of the women's team.
We won three university championships.

470
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:23,221
Oh, but that was decades ago!

471
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,767
But I was more disciplined then. I always
put my studies ahead of my athletics.

472
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:31,565
I'm sure you're the same
and you've done all your homework already.

473
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:35,334
- Well, not exactly.
- Really? Oh. That's a pity.

474
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:40,937
Young men who don't do their studies
often miss out on more amusing activities.

475
00:38:42,016 --> 00:38:44,746
- And who is this young lady?
- This is Lydia.

476
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:48,779
Hello, Lydia.

477
00:38:50,991 --> 00:38:54,449
This isn't fair, Mom.
Why do we need a housekeeper anyway?

478
00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:57,053
- This is all I need.
- Why can't Dad do it?

479
00:38:57,298 --> 00:39:02,964
Dear, I don't think it's appropriate to argue
with your mother in front of a stranger.

480
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:06,505
I just don't see why
we can't spend the extra time with Dad.

481
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:10,771
Maybe she's right, dear. Maybe their father
would be a more appropriate person.

482
00:39:10,911 --> 00:39:13,379
No, I don't think so.

483
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:18,008
It's not my fault, honey. If he would
get ajob and a decent apartment...

484
00:39:18,152 --> 00:39:21,417
- You see, he's the kind...
- Excuse me, dear.

485
00:39:21,555 --> 00:39:24,683
I'm sure you'd want the children
to step out of the room

486
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:27,727
before you verbally bash their father. Hm?

487
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:30,524
If I did that, I might never see them again.

488
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,598
- I'm sorry. You're right.
- No harm done.

489
00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:40,366
- You're absolutely right.
- I'm not a therapist. I just see what I see.

490
00:39:40,474 --> 00:39:43,534
Why don't you guys go on upstairs?
I'll be up in a minute.

491
00:39:43,644 --> 00:39:46,772
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

492
00:39:46,881 --> 00:39:48,940
You too, Lydie.

493
00:39:55,055 --> 00:39:57,182
- Oh, they're a spirited bunch.
- Yes.

494
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,657
- Especially Lydie. She's got daggers for you.
- I know.

495
00:40:00,794 --> 00:40:04,560
- They're very upset with me right now.
- Probably the divorce.

496
00:40:04,665 --> 00:40:06,724
How did you know?

497
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:10,065
You can sense it, dear -
the way she talks about her father.

498
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:15,801
I don't think he's in the Navy, the way she's
saying she misses him. It's like he's nearby.

499
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,878
- Yes.
- Oh, that's so sad.

500
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:20,742
- Would you care to have a cup of tea?
- I'd love that.

501
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:23,681
- It's right in here.
- What a lovely home you have.

502
00:40:23,817 --> 00:40:26,081
- Did you decorate this yourself?
- Yes, I did.

503
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,748
Oh, it reeks of taste! Isn't this lovely, dear!

504
00:40:30,858 --> 00:40:33,952
- Here's my résumé.
- Oh. Thank you.

505
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:37,428
- Let me start this tea.
- Oh, no, dear. Let me get that for you.

506
00:40:37,531 --> 00:40:43,663
You've had a hard day. You just sit yourself
down on that stool and leave the tea to me.

507
00:40:43,804 --> 00:40:46,637
Thank you. That's very nice of you.

508
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,799
Oh, not at all, dear.

509
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:51,776
- Oh. What a wonderful résumé.
- Thank you, dear.

510
00:40:52,146 --> 00:40:54,614
"Expert in first aid and CPR."

511
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:56,774
And Heimlich manoeuvre, dear.

512
00:40:56,884 --> 00:41:00,376
You can never be too prepared
when little ones are around.

513
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:04,253
They'll swallow anything.
You've got to be ready to pop it out.

514
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:07,419
Oh, let's see.

515
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:11,389
What a perfectly appointed little cubby!

516
00:41:11,498 --> 00:41:15,628
Look at this. Everything
has its place and name tag.

517
00:41:15,736 --> 00:41:18,671
How precise! It's lovely.

518
00:41:18,772 --> 00:41:20,831
My husband never appreciated it.

519
00:41:20,941 --> 00:41:23,000
Oh. Poor dolt.

520
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:26,079
That's not the reason
you divorced him, was it?

521
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:28,141
No.

522
00:41:29,183 --> 00:41:33,051
It's so sad, because marriage
can be such a blessing.

523
00:41:33,153 --> 00:41:35,678
So can divorce.

524
00:41:36,757 --> 00:41:43,890
Daniel is a very difficult man to live with.
But the children are crazy about him.

525
00:41:43,998 --> 00:41:47,764
You don't have to be a psychic to sense that.

526
00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:51,969
My, you certainly do know your way
around a kitchen!

527
00:41:53,941 --> 00:41:57,968
It's just because everything is so accessible.
You designed it.

528
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:02,640
I'm amazed there isn't a little label there
that says "spoons".

529
00:42:05,152 --> 00:42:07,916
You remind me of someone.

530
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:11,483
Really? Who?

531
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,790
I feel like I've known you for years.

532
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:20,198
Maybe we knew each other in another life.

533
00:42:22,036 --> 00:42:25,369
I would love for you
to come and work with us.

534
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:28,099
- So would I.
- Great!

535
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:30,267
It would be an honor.

536
00:42:31,045 --> 00:42:33,377
To us.

537
00:42:33,547 --> 00:42:37,108
To us. The start of a business relationship.

538
00:43:07,448 --> 00:43:09,541
Good evening, dear.

539
00:43:11,352 --> 00:43:13,377
Evening, ma'am.

540
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:21,456
Cold night, isn't it?

541
00:43:21,628 --> 00:43:23,789
Yes, it is.

542
00:43:24,164 --> 00:43:28,260
Hope you have somethin' nice and warm
to go home to.

543
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:43,240
My back.

544
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:48,981
Jesus! If I find the misogynistic bastard
that invented heels, I'll kill him.

545
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,949
God...!

546
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:02,229
Excuse me.

547
00:44:02,336 --> 00:44:04,304
Mrs Sellner!

548
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:07,804
Have we met?

549
00:44:07,908 --> 00:44:11,071
No. But Danny's told me all about you.

550
00:44:11,945 --> 00:44:14,573
I'm his sister.

551
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:17,644
His... much older sister.

552
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,418
- You have his eyes.
- Only if he fills out a donor card.

553
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:29,458
- Is Mr Hillard in? I have an appointment.
- Do you? Oh, that's wonderful.

554
00:44:29,563 --> 00:44:32,088
Let me go up and get him
and he'll be right down.

555
00:44:32,232 --> 00:44:33,790
- I'll come with you.
- No.

556
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:35,232
- Yes.
- Why?

557
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:41,296
Because I have an appointment on Monday
and Friday evenings to check the apartment.

558
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:44,275
I remember him saying something about that.

559
00:44:44,378 --> 00:44:47,870
Are you sure, dear?
It's three floors, hoofin' it all the way.

560
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:50,415
- If you can do it, I can.
- I'll bet so!

561
00:44:50,517 --> 00:44:52,542
- Is your ticker all right?
- Topnotch.

562
00:44:52,686 --> 00:44:56,281
Oh, good! Cos I don't want to jump-start ya.

563
00:44:58,892 --> 00:45:00,291
Damn door.

564
00:45:00,394 --> 00:45:03,420
Come in, please, dear. Sorry about that.

565
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,555
Here we are. Daniel's abode.

566
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:11,730
Oh, that's mine, dear.
I'm a messy house guest.

567
00:45:11,872 --> 00:45:14,932
Well, just make yourself at home.
I'll be right back.

568
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:17,100
He'll be back. I'll go get him.

569
00:45:17,211 --> 00:45:20,305
Don't be afraid. I'll be right there. Danny!

570
00:45:20,414 --> 00:45:24,145
Danny boy, where are you?
Oh, here he is, dear. I found him.

571
00:45:24,284 --> 00:45:26,912
Danny, there's a Mrs Sellner here to see you!

572
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,352
- Oh, is she here?
- Yes, she is.

573
00:45:29,823 --> 00:45:32,917
Mrs Sellner, I just got out of the shower!

574
00:45:33,026 --> 00:45:35,494
I think you'll be very pleased with me!

575
00:45:35,596 --> 00:45:38,997
I've been through
some really interesting changes!

576
00:45:39,132 --> 00:45:42,659
And I'm becoming a new man
and a model father!

577
00:45:43,837 --> 00:45:47,000
He'll be right there. He's just changing, dear.

578
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:51,568
I want to keep you abreast
of the changes in my career!

579
00:45:51,712 --> 00:45:56,274
There have been two big developments!
I'm finally starting to come into my own!

580
00:45:56,383 --> 00:46:00,717
Things are really starting to take shape,
and I'm blossoming! Really, I am!

581
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:06,383
Things were hairy for a while,
but I'm in great shape now!

582
00:46:06,527 --> 00:46:08,995
I'm my own man now! Oh, yes!

583
00:46:10,264 --> 00:46:13,165
A job I could really sink my teeth into!

584
00:46:13,267 --> 00:46:15,394
I'll be right there, Mrs Sellner!

585
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:22,541
So nice I don't have to
save face any more, Mrs Sellner!

586
00:46:25,812 --> 00:46:29,145
Mrs Sellner! How are you? Always ajoy!

587
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:32,514
If you wanted some cheese,
why didn't you just say so?

588
00:46:32,886 --> 00:46:36,378
Well, you'll be happy to know
that I now am holding down two jobs.

589
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:40,426
One for an educational film
and TV company - heavy responsibility.

590
00:46:40,561 --> 00:46:44,930
- And the other?
- Cleaning houses. Not mine.

591
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,864
- Big girl!
- Your sister is English?

592
00:46:49,002 --> 00:46:51,129
She's half-English, half-American.

593
00:46:51,238 --> 00:46:55,436
Half-sister, really. That makes her
an eighth English? I've never done the math.

594
00:46:55,576 --> 00:47:00,240
Let me see, my father was American.
He flew for the English during the war.

595
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,009
He was in London and...
he met this lovely Englishwoman.

596
00:47:04,117 --> 00:47:07,746
Well, my sister was the fruit of their passions.

597
00:47:07,854 --> 00:47:10,618
Sorry. My sister's, not yours.

598
00:47:10,724 --> 00:47:16,185
You see, she's not a very good housekeeper.
But she makes a fabulous cup of English tea.

599
00:47:16,296 --> 00:47:19,891
Really? Well, I would adore
a good cup of English tea.

600
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:23,400
Oh! Wouldn't we all! I'll go get her.

601
00:47:23,503 --> 00:47:26,199
Sis! Oh, sis!

602
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:28,365
Sis, are you in here?

603
00:47:28,475 --> 00:47:31,171
Tea? Cup of TNT.

604
00:47:48,895 --> 00:47:50,988
Sick. Mom!

605
00:47:55,669 --> 00:47:57,227
My face!

606
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:05,735
I've gotta go down and get it.

607
00:48:08,882 --> 00:48:10,474
Norman Bates!

608
00:48:32,272 --> 00:48:34,467
Miss Hillard?

609
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:37,668
- Yes, dear?
- I take sugar in my tea.

610
00:48:37,778 --> 00:48:39,837
Oh, your tea!

611
00:48:39,946 --> 00:48:42,506
I'll be right there with your tea!

612
00:48:45,886 --> 00:48:49,481
Coming right up, dear!
Sugar - one lump or two, dear?

613
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:52,888
- Two, please!
- Tea, sugar, hot water.

614
00:48:52,993 --> 00:48:56,451
You got it. Coming right your way, dear!

615
00:48:56,563 --> 00:48:58,690
I'll be right there with your tea!

616
00:49:01,768 --> 00:49:03,531
No! Stop!

617
00:49:12,245 --> 00:49:13,712
Oh, shit!

618
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,882
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, dear! I don't need a hand.

619
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,585
I need a face.

620
00:49:28,562 --> 00:49:32,293
- Are you sure?
- Oh, definitely!

621
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:41,738
I'm not a Muslim. I need a face! Oh, God.

622
00:49:44,878 --> 00:49:48,507
Miss Hillard? The water's boiling.

623
00:49:48,782 --> 00:49:50,044
Hello!

624
00:49:51,618 --> 00:49:56,646
Oh, I'm sorry to frighten you, dear.
I must look like a yeti in this get-up.

625
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,658
This is my nightly meringue mask.
Part of my beauty regimen.

626
00:50:00,794 --> 00:50:05,857
It's basically egg whites, creme fraîche,
powdered sugar, vanilla and a touch of alum.

627
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:11,266
There you go, dear. Oh! You've got your
cream and sugar. It's a little cappu-tea-no.

628
00:50:11,505 --> 00:50:13,598
One drop or two? Would you like another?

629
00:50:13,707 --> 00:50:16,335
Oh! There you go!

630
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:20,971
As you can see, I can't stay with you, dear.
I'm melting like a snow cone in Phoenix.

631
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:26,212
There we go again! I'll go get Danny.
He'll be right with you. Hold on.

632
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:29,550
- Danny!
- Coming, sis!

633
00:50:29,656 --> 00:50:33,217
- It was lovely to have met you!
- Lovely to meet you.

634
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:56,080
- Had a little accident.
- Be careful this time. She's an old woman.

635
00:50:58,151 --> 00:51:00,779
Why wasn't I an only child?

636
00:51:36,723 --> 00:51:38,918
- Sorry.
- That's quite all right.

637
00:51:50,103 --> 00:51:52,128
Ready? OK.

638
00:51:52,806 --> 00:51:54,330
Did you have fun?

639
00:51:54,474 --> 00:51:57,341
- What did you do?
- I painted a picture of a bunny.

640
00:51:57,477 --> 00:51:59,707
The teacher liked it.

641
00:52:01,214 --> 00:52:05,048
<i>Here it is, Mel. $1,000 worth of hair.</i>
<i>What am I supposed to do with it?</i>

642
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:07,984
<i>- Alan, I was wondering if...</i>
<i>- You want one of them?</i>

643
00:52:08,955 --> 00:52:12,083
<i>I'd rather make a coat for my wife.</i>

644
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:15,753
All right, everyone.
It's time to expand your minds.

645
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:21,163
- It's homework time. OK?
- Yeah, but... after <i>Dick Van Dyke.</i>

646
00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:25,264
No. Now.

647
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:26,897
No.

648
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:31,074
We always watch <i>Dick Van Dyke.</i>

649
00:52:33,546 --> 00:52:36,413
Really? Well, not any more.

650
00:52:37,851 --> 00:52:41,116
The only thing you'll be watching
is Deep Sea-N-N.

651
00:52:42,555 --> 00:52:43,954
Now,

652
00:52:44,524 --> 00:52:47,493
I know you're used to loosey-goosey.

653
00:52:47,594 --> 00:52:50,495
But I run a much tighter ship.

654
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:55,233
Between the hours of 3pm and 7pm,
I'm in charge.

655
00:52:55,802 --> 00:52:59,738
And when I'm in charge,
you will follow a schedule.

656
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,808
Those who do not follow the schedule
will be punished.

657
00:53:03,677 --> 00:53:06,737
- Punished?
- She's lying.

658
00:53:06,846 --> 00:53:08,905
She'd never punish us.

659
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:11,917
Don't... fuss with me.

660
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:46,450
This is exploitation. It's not fair.

661
00:53:46,586 --> 00:53:49,749
- Shut up, Lydie.
- Yeah. You got us into this.

662
00:53:49,856 --> 00:53:52,256
Ooh, my little ankle-biters.

663
00:53:52,392 --> 00:53:54,952
Do I sense dissension in the ranks?

664
00:53:55,061 --> 00:53:58,758
Are we ready for homework,
or shall we continue manual labor?

665
00:53:58,865 --> 00:54:03,700
- No. Anything but this.
- Then upstairs, my little nose-miners.

666
00:54:03,837 --> 00:54:06,897
Go. Flee before me!

667
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,304
Onward and upward!

668
00:54:09,442 --> 00:54:11,637
Go pump some neurons.

669
00:54:11,745 --> 00:54:13,804
Expand your craniums.

670
00:54:13,913 --> 00:54:15,972
- I miss Dad.
- Me, too.

671
00:54:16,082 --> 00:54:18,607
Me most.

672
00:54:20,353 --> 00:54:22,412
I'm here, guys.

673
00:54:23,623 --> 00:54:25,648
In some form.

674
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:30,588
Let's see.

675
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,026
OK. Pinch of basil.

676
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:41,064
Damn!

677
00:54:48,882 --> 00:54:50,907
Mayday!

678
00:54:51,584 --> 00:54:53,643
Oh, God! It's gonna blow!

679
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:58,048
Easy.

680
00:54:58,158 --> 00:55:00,217
Damn. Calm down.

681
00:55:01,394 --> 00:55:03,453
Come on.

682
00:55:04,164 --> 00:55:07,429
How is it? Oh, my God. It's clotted. Oh, God.

683
00:55:08,802 --> 00:55:11,737
This hollandaise smells like burnt rubber.

684
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:14,732
God, it's hot in here.

685
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,192
Look at this! My first day as a woman
and I'm getting hot flashes.

686
00:55:55,181 --> 00:55:57,547
- Hey, here's your food.
- How much is it?

687
00:55:57,717 --> 00:56:00,914
- 135.27.
- 135 dollars?! That's certainly...

688
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,079
And 27 cents.

689
00:56:03,189 --> 00:56:06,022
Four dinners. 20 bucks extra for rushing us.

690
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,095
Rushing? Well, you could have been
a little bit faster, dear.

691
00:56:10,196 --> 00:56:13,597
- There's 140. Do you have change?
- No.

692
00:56:13,766 --> 00:56:16,826
I thought you wouldn't.
Thank you very much.

693
00:56:47,233 --> 00:56:49,258
Hello!

694
00:56:50,803 --> 00:56:52,828
Hello! Anybody home?

695
00:56:55,408 --> 00:56:58,377
- Where were you guys?
- Upstairs, doing our homework.

696
00:56:58,478 --> 00:57:00,673
Mrs Doubtfire said we had to.

697
00:57:00,847 --> 00:57:03,407
Oh, she did, huh?

698
00:57:03,516 --> 00:57:06,485
Doing your homework. How great!

699
00:57:06,619 --> 00:57:08,382
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

700
00:57:08,488 --> 00:57:12,424
Look at this place! It looks wonderful!
All spick-and-span.

701
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:28,573
Dinner is served, madam.

702
00:57:29,475 --> 00:57:31,238
How lovely!

703
00:57:53,566 --> 00:57:55,466
Mrs Doubtfire?

704
00:57:55,568 --> 00:57:59,299
Lydia, dear. Get back inside
right now before you freeze.

705
00:57:59,439 --> 00:58:03,876
Look... I just want to apologize
for being such a pain today.

706
00:58:03,977 --> 00:58:07,674
- Oh, dear, it's all right.
- No, I'm really sorry.

707
00:58:08,982 --> 00:58:13,248
It's just... I'm still kind of messed-up.
About everything.

708
00:58:15,588 --> 00:58:17,647
We all are, sweetie.

709
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:20,221
What?

710
00:58:20,727 --> 00:58:25,096
I just mean I understand
the pain you're all going through.

711
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:29,158
Yeah.

712
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:32,230
Well, I also wanted to thank you.

713
00:58:32,805 --> 00:58:35,933
- For what?
- For making my mom so happy.

714
00:58:38,544 --> 00:58:43,481
She hasn't been in this good a mood since...
I can't even remember.

715
00:58:45,785 --> 00:58:47,844
It's been a long time.

716
00:58:47,987 --> 00:58:50,387
- It has?
- Yeah.

717
00:58:51,691 --> 00:58:53,716
Well, I gotta go back in, but...

718
00:58:53,893 --> 00:58:57,351
- Go.
- OK. Thank you.

719
00:58:57,997 --> 00:59:00,465
You're welcome.

720
00:59:03,503 --> 00:59:05,528
Bye.

721
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:13,470
Thank you.

722
00:59:26,459 --> 00:59:28,427
Oh, no.

723
00:59:29,529 --> 00:59:33,590
Well, milady! It's a pleasure to see you again!

724
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:35,758
A joy, as always.

725
00:59:54,287 --> 00:59:56,721
I like that Mediterranean look in women.

726
00:59:58,358 --> 01:00:00,383
Natural. Healthy.

727
01:00:01,994 --> 01:00:04,053
Just the way God made ya.

728
01:00:05,198 --> 01:00:09,760
He broke the mould when he made me, dear.
He made me very special.

729
01:00:10,236 --> 01:00:12,670
He sure did.

730
01:00:13,906 --> 01:00:16,397
Bless you.

731
01:01:33,786 --> 01:01:37,222
I am not a crook.

732
01:01:37,323 --> 01:01:39,689
"She kissed Stuart and thanked him."

733
01:01:40,526 --> 01:01:42,892
"'How was it down there? ' asked Mr Little,

734
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:46,522
who was always curious to know
about places he'd never been to."

735
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:48,531
"'Lt was all right,' said Stuart."

736
01:02:38,184 --> 01:02:39,947
Back off, asshole!

737
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:41,747
Beat it!

738
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:47,292
Broke my bag, the bastard.
