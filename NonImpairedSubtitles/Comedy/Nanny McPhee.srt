You can't be Bum, Aggy.
Sebastian's Bum. You're Poop.

318
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,754
Poop Bum.

319

Goodnight, Sebastian.

Goodnight, Tora.

Goodnight, Christianna.

Goodnight, Simon.

00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,358
There is something you should understand
about the way I work.

329
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,792
When you need me but do not want me,
then I must stay.

330
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,916
When you want me but no longer need me,
then I have to go.

331
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,953
It's rather sad, really, but there it is.

332
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,838
We will never want you.

333
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,390
Then I will never go.

334
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,998
- Goodnight, children.
- [Magical tinkling]

340
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,831
I did knock.

341
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,669
Of course. You weren't just
creeping up on me. What a suggestion.

00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,759
- The children are all in bed and asleep.
- Good. Really?

Hm.

344
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,076
- Good grief.
- I shall see myself to my room.

Goodnight, Mr Brown.

No, wait.

00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,878
What do you... I mean, how...
What are your terms?

348
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,517
Your children require five lessons.

349
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,679
Lesson one, to go to bed
when they're told, is complete.

350
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,032
As for my terms,
I take Sunday afternoons off.

Goodnight.

[Grunts] No.

Hm. I shall give you half an hour to be up,

washed, dressed, teeth cleaned, beds made

Chrissie, chalk. Eric, crayons. Lily, pepper.

How do you know
she won't do something horrid to us?

368
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,993
I worked it out.

369
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,318
She's a trained hypnotist.
That's how she made us do those things.

370
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,318
Don't look directly at her
and she can't hypnotise us.

I'm off to work early.
We're busy at the mortuary.

Some bout of influenza at Archway
is carrying off all the old folks... Ah-ah-ah!

Still, what's bad for them
is good for us. [Chuckles]

Well, I know. That, too. Of course.

378
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,990
- [Door slams]
- Odd. She normally says, "Have a nice day,"

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,192
or "Don't forget your jacket" if it's cold out.

Never mind.

will be staying in bed today.

The children? What, all day?
Are they ill? What's wrong?

388

Nothing. I know precisely what to do.
Please leave it to me.

You managed them splendidly last night.

If they are under the weather,

give them what they want,
ice-cream and jelly and suchlike.

My late wife was very particular.
If ever they were ill,

she used to wait on them hand and foot...
even if they weren't ill at all.

I shall be sure to give them
exactly what they need.

- Ooh, lovely, I shouldn't wonder.

[Woman] Cedric,
let me not beat about the bush.

Your children are out of control.

434
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,716
You need a wife
and your children need a mother.

435
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:55,313
If you do not remarry by the end of the month,

Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

Never mind. Less than a month to go.
There's nothing for it.

439
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,639
It'll have to be that woman...
the dreadful one.

440
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,998
Mr Jowls, do you recollect
that... enthusiastic lady?

441
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,637
Mrs Swiftly, was it? Or was it
Mrs Thadius something last year?

Mr Brown, in my hour of need.

- He was her third.

You don't happen to know
if... if she ever... ever, erm...

00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,229
remarried? You know, number four?

450
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,433
Mr Brown, you're not thinking what I think
you're thinking, are you, Mr Brown?

451
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,268
Good grief, no! No, no. No. No.

No. No, no... no. What a thought. No. No.

Actually, I'm not sure it is measles.

How can it be anything other?

458
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,394
The chalky-white faces, the livid spots,

459

- the temperatures of 120 degrees.
- [Sizzle]

Definitely.

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,153
You're looking very peely-wally.
Where's my tea? I must have tea.

625
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,952
Of course. This way. At once.

626
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,993
I smell damp.

627
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,749
[Sniffs] No, no... At least not noticeably.

628
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,394
Damp in the house.
Hence your pallid complexion.

629
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,555
Lovely hat.

630
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,435
A gift from the Duchess of Kent.
She has taste.

631
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,552
- I've always hated this room.
- [Chuckles]

632
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,239
- Milk?
- Certainly not.

633
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,670
Filthy stuff. Most unhealthy.

634
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,110
- Sugar?
- Six, if you please.

635
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,799
Six.

636
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,869
Let me not beat about the bush, Cedric.
You have too many children.

637
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,389
- Ah, that.
- Don't interrupt.

638
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,674
Your wife, my poor, weak-minded niece,
had no sense of proportion.

639
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,795
However, I know where my duties lie.
I gave her my word that I would help.

640
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,037
As you know, Cedric, my word is my law.

641
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,549
I now propose to help you further.

642
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,675
- Oh, thank you, Aunt Adelaide. Thank you.
- Don't interrupt. Sit down.

643
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,394
This is my proposal.

644
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,115
I shall relieve you of one of your children...

645
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,038
and give it a home with me at Stitch Manor.

646
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,276
[Thunderclap]

647
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,629
[gasps]

648
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,317
It will require sacrifice on my part.
I realise that.

649
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,231
But as my sainted father always said,
"Duty, Adelaide, always duty."

650
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,876
- You mustn't. I can't possibly...
- Thank me enough. I know.

651
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,675
You must feel quite overwhelmed
by the benefits of such a plan.

652
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,472
Your fortunate daughter,

653
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,116
for it must be a girl
and not one of those other things,

654
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,074
will receive private tuition
in literature, history, deportment

655
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,431
and above all, elocution.

656
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,794
If there's one thing I won't stand for,
it's loose vowels.

657
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,318
What did Papa say? He must have
told her not to even think of it.

658
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,875
He didn't say anything.

659
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,070
[Tora sighs]

660
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,511
Come on. Let's find the others.

661
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,156
I must be frank.
There is no question of your taking...

662
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,559
Hush now! I'm used to taking responsibility
for other people's mistakes.

663
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,197
Now, where is the bulk of your offspring?

664
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,194
- Ah. Here we are.
- [Oinks]

665
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,110
- Oh!
- Baaagh!

666
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,437
- It was a bee. A big bee. Erm...
- Good heavens!

667
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,516
Gone now. Phew.

668
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,757
- Hm.
- You're not well, Cedric.

669
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,236
The sooner you find a good wife, the better.

670
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,115
- [Brays]
- This'll put her off wanting any of you girls.

671
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,118
- [Oinks]
- Speak up, girl!

672
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,915
Oh! What an unfortunate face.

673
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,998
All those bristles.

674
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,397
It might be very hard
to get her decently betrothed.

675
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,591
[Oinking]

676
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,155
Do you not have a more comely girl?

677
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,510
[Panting]

678
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,598
[clucking]

679
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,076
- Erm... perhaps round the front of the house.
- Oh!

680
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,316
[Pig oinks]

681
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,996
- [brays]
- Chrissie, hurry up!

682
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,754
- Tie it, Chrissie.
- [Braying]

683
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,793
- [shrieks]
- [Simon] Eric, stop her!

684
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,877
- Chrissie, stop! She'll see you!
- Papa!

685
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,231
Cedric, I had no idea
that you had produced such a...

686
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,796
such an unattractive batch of females.

687
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,754
I shall leave directly. Get my hat.

688
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,474
Your hat? So soon?

689
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,478
- Really? No, you can't... I'll get it.
- Hewitt!

690
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,673
No!

691
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,878
- A-ha!
- [Gasps]

692
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,868
Oh, yes. You'll do perfectly.

693
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,790
A little timid, perhaps,
but we'll soon knock that out of you.

694
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,117
Come on, come on. It can't do any harm to try.

695
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,039
I can't find your... What are you doing?

696
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,470
- This is the chosen one. Get her ready.
- Papa, help!

697
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,639
- Chrissie? You're not listen...
- Shut up, Cedric, and do as you're told!

698
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,991
Nanny McPhee, we need you.

699
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:13,593
- Nanny McPhee, please, we need you.
- [Magical wind rushes]

700
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,634
- Where is my hat?
- [Donkey braying]

701
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,717
[brays triumphantly]

702
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,273
Hide!

703
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,797
My hat!

704
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,072
- How dare you!
- [Creaking]

705
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,956
- [crashing thud]
- [brays]

706

[chuckles]

707
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,393
- Oh, my, what a merry game.
- Yoo-hoo!

708
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,068
My, my, what a pretty girl you are.

709
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,078
[Donkey whistles merry tune]

710
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,714
Oh, this is the girl for me.

711
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,639
Run.

712
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,957
Such poise, such gaiety.

713
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,072
- Ah, there you are, staff.
- Yes, madam.

714
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,193
I'm taking this child with me. Get her ready.

715
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,550
[Blows smoochy kiss]

716
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,433
Very well, madam.

717
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,915
Sherry time.

718
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,315
[Magical breeze sighs]

719
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,399
Do not forget that someone
has to go with your great-aunt

720
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,989
and it cannot be the donkey, can it?

721
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,035
[Birds caw]

722
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,997
[Tora] Well, I'm the eldest girl. I'll go.

723
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,990
[Lily] No. I've always known
I was destined for tragedy. I'll go.

724
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,952
[Aggy] Aggy go.

725
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,596
[Eric] Don't be silly, Aggy.
You're not even a whole girl yet.

726
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,712
[Chrissie] No. She wanted me. I'll go.

727
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,956
[Sebastian] You can't all go.

728
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,513
Well, I am entirely satisfied.

729
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,077
I will keep my word, Cedric,
if you will keep yours.

730
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,795
You must give those children a mother
before the month is out.

731
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,353
No.

732
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,354
What?

733
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,678
You cannot order me around. And you
certainly can't take any of my children.

734
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,393
- L...
- [magical breeze blows]

735
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,195
Your carriage awaits, madam.

736
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,391
Is the chosen one seated?

737
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,592
- Lndeed she is.
- Good.

738
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,270
- All is prepared.
- Which chosen one? What's prepared?

739
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,153
Cedric, in view of this afternoon's
happy outcome,

740
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,875
I am willing to overlook
that last unattractive outburst.

741
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,435
- Nanny McPhee.
- Off we go, Hewitt.

742
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,393
- What have you done?
- I have done nothing, sir.

743
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,989
The children have decided
amongst themselves.

744
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,270
Decided what? What do you mean?

745
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,436
[Adelaide] There you are, dear.

746
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,712
- Not little Chrissie.
- [Coachman cracks whip] Yah!

747
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,392
Chrissie!

748

- [Coachman] Yah!
- [Whinnying]

Yah!

Chrissie!

752
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,838
Now, then, you'd better
tell me your name, little girl.

753
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,678
[Bleating]

- Yah!

- Christianna!
- Don't be shy, my dear. What is your name?

756
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,069
- [Shrill whinny]
- Yah!

757
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,079
Sit up straight and tell me your name.

758
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,311
No!

759
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,437
- Christianna!
- Papa!

760
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,313
Papa! Papa!

00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,718
Oh! [Murmurs]

Then... then who...?

763
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,255
Evangeline. My name's Evangeline.

And what a pretty name it is, too.

767
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,450
Evangeline...

768
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,533
Oh.

769
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,814
- [Horse whinnies]
- Yah! Yah!

[Tinkling breeze blows]

771
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,489
Time for bed.

772
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,375
- Thank you for saving me, Nanny McPhee.
- Hm.

00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,813
Yes. Thank you.

Thank you.

Hm.

778
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,573
Papa was going to let her take me.

779
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:35,410
No, Christianna.
Your father would never have allowed it.

780
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,529
- Goodnight, children.
- [Children] Goodnight, Nanny McPhee.

00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,376
[Magical breeze sighs]

782
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,015
She hasn't got any warts at all now.

783
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,973
Do you think she's using
some sort of cream?

784
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,497
[Clock chimes]

785
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,609
[magical wind rushes]

786
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,336
Thank you, Nanny McPhee.
You were a tremendous help.

787
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,768
Not at all.

788
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,971
You will find that lesson three,

789
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,456
to get dressed when they're told,
is complete.

790
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:38,654
Just to get dressed when they're told?
They've learned a great deal more than that.

791
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,290
I have five lessons to teach.

792
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,857
What lessons they learn is entirely
up to them. Goodnight, Mr Brown.

793
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,814
- Nanny McPhee...
- Yes, Mr Brown?

794
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:55,218
She will be all right, won't she?
Evangeline, I mean.

795
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,692
I can't help being concerned.

796
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,779
Aunt Adelaide can be so, erm...
Well, you saw.

797
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,369
She will certainly be all right.

798
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,014
Good.

799
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,975
I suppose she volunteered to go, did she?
Couldn't wait to be shot of us, I imagine.

800
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,932
Not quite.

801
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,619
It was Simon's idea.

802
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,209
He knew Evangeline
might like to educate herself

803
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,457
and that her going would save Christianna.

804
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,378
He's a very clever boy.

805
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:30,938
Good heavens. Simon, eh?
Well, good for him. Quick... quick thinking.

806
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,335
Goodnight, Mr Brown.

807
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,690
[Sighs deeply]

808
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,608
So that's it, then.

809
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,653
I shall have to marry... Quickly.

810

[clears throat]

813
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,497
Children, your father has asked me to tell you

814
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:50,409
there's a Mrs Quickly coming for tea tomorrow.

815
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,214
- Nanny McPhee?
- Yes, sweetheart?

816
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:59,618
Can you stop Papa
from marrying a horrible stepmother?

817
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,298
I'm afraid not.

818
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:08,620
- Even if you wanted to?
- Even if I wanted to.

819
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,496
I cannot interfere with affairs of the heart.

820
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,055
Perhaps Simon could talk to him about it.

821
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,376
He won't listen.

822

[Seagull cries]

823
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,650
You have a visitor, Mr Brown.

824
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,296
An especially eager visitor, Mr Brown.

825
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,690
Quickly by name...

826
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,969
Oh!

827
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,250
Simon, my boy.

828
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,610
Well, come in.

829
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,697
Come on, I won't bite.

830
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:09,499
- Father, we want to ask you something.
- Well, of course.

831
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,656
Of course. Anything at all. Ask away.

832
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,454
Who is Mrs Quickly?

833
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,615
[Chuckles feebly]
Good heavens, such a face. She's, er...

834
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,459
She's... she's a friend. She's... a friend.

835
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,491
Just a friend?

836
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,931
Well, my boy,
it's not exactly any of your business, is it?

837
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,290
It is if she's to be our new mother.

838
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,218
Who said anything about that?

839
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,218
It is true? You are going to marry her?

840
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,492
You go too far, Simon.

- You must not question...
- I didn't.

842

- Don't contradict me!
- I'm not!

843
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,938
You do not understand the adult world.

844
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,973
You know, there are certain things that...

Can I help you?

I... we... need you to help us
get rid of this woman, Mrs Quickly.

It will not surprise you to hear
that I cannot agree to that, Simon.

Then let us do whatever
we have to do to get rid of her.

let you do whatever you have to do.

Oh, you mustn't be so formal.

You must call me Auntie Selma.

Oh, dear me, one does work up
such a thirst in this heat.

Oh. Tea, of course. Do go through. I'll...

886

And leave these dear creatures?
How can you ask it of me?

00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,296
What a gentleman.

There, just as I thought. It's dusty.
It just needs a good old thump.

There. All thumped and ready to go.

Nothing is too much trouble for you.

on the sad day we buried Mr Quickly.

904
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,130
Even in my demented grief,
I said to my friend Letitia Carter...

905
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:38,697
Remember her? A pinker complexion
than my own. She takes too much sun.

906

second nature to him."

"He is a perfect gentleman."

and yet retiring in his manner..."

I don't know what came over me.

01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:04,453
I do. I understand. I never took you for such.

914
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:09,256
But now I see it.
Passion is clearly your nature, too.

915
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:14,375
I feel it. Who would have thought
we were such kindred spirits?

916
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:19,529
Passion is my life.
In fact, Mr Brown, what is life without it?

917
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:24,131
- Er...
- A grey wheel of habit, spinning idly on.

- Mmm!

[Mrs Quickly] Mmm!

- This is no time for food, Mrs Quickly...
- Selma.

01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:39,133
I couldn't possibly swallow it
under the circumstances.

922
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,649
You are tempestuous, Mr Brown.

923
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,892
- Tea?
- Yes, tea.

924
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,649
We must blanket the raw impulse
with that reliable beverage.

I like a bit of Spode. Tasteful.

Anyway, so essential
for upholding the normal...

- How right you are.

What is tea when we can drink
from the nectar of our emotions?

is in tatters on this rug.

Lovely rug. Is it Chinese silk?

01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:40,448
Must escape before all is lost.

940
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,934
Wait!

941
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:46,418
Heavens to Betsy! You are inflamed!

942
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:51,091
How does a lonely widow best you?
What defences does she have?

943
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,578
All it takes is one question, Cedric,
and I'm yours.

944
01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:00,854
- Ask me or you'll lose me forever.
- Oh, no... Absolutely.

945
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:03,528
[Mrs Quickly] Say it. Say it.

946
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:07,415
- Say it. Say it.
- No!

947
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:12,412
Oh! No! This is too much, sir!

948
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,776
You are a cad!

949
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,697
A bounder and a cad! [Sobs]

950
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:24,179
- [children giggle]
- Yeah!

951
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,177
[Simon] Papa's coming.

952
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,099
She's gone.

953
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:44,578
The only person in the whole world
who stands between all of us

954
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,340
and total ruin...

955
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:50,293
and she's gone.

956
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,816
What's ruin?

957
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:59,697
There's no time to mince words.
I can't support my own family.

958
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,336
I never have been able to.
There are so many of you.

959
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,576
But you're all so delicious.

960
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,056
When Aggy came along
and your mother was so ill, I said,

961
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:14,412
"We may have to stop now, dear,"
and she said...

962
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:17,009
She said, "l know."

963
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:27,332
The fact of the matter is,
your Great-Aunt Adelaide

964
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:31,294
has been supporting us for years
with a monthly allowance.

965
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,809
A little while ago, she told me

966
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:37,057
that I had to remarry
or the allowance would stop.

967
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:40,138
This woman today was my last chance.

968
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:42,376
Our last chance.

969
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,252
Ours?

970
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,175
When the money stops,
the house will be taken.

971
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:52,656
Some of you will perhaps
be put into the workhouse.

972
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:57,217
Some will be put into the care...
into the care of others.

973
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:01,935
I don't know how many of you
will be allowed to stay together.

974
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:10,496
I'm sorry to have failed you, children.

975
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:16,848
You deserve so much better.

976
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:25,499
- Do something.
- What would you suggest?

977
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:30,410
Change what happened.
Bang your stick. Make it undo itself.

978
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,736
I cannot. These were your actions.

979
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:36,455
Simon promised that you would
accept the consequences.

980
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:39,970
What shall we do?
Help us. Tell us what to do.

981
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:44,571
- You must undo it for yourselves.
- How? How?

982
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,010
Think.

983
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,939
You are very clever, children.

984
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,653
Think.

985
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,970
[Women cackle with laughter]

986
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:59,696
- So, 'e was keen?
- Oh, Letty, he was in a maddened condition.

987
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:02,937
He couldn't keep his hands off me.
But I held firm.

988
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:07,770
I said, "Shedric..." I mean, "Cedric,
I have my reputation to uphold."

989
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:10,778
"It's marriage or nothing.
What do you take me for?"

990
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,208
- [Knocking]
- "Some common...?"

991
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,934
- Tart?
- Not for me. I'm bloated.

992
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,415
- No. "Some common tart." You said...
- [knocking]

993
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:20,293
- Who's that knocking?
- [Lamb bleats]

994
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,456
- It might be him.
- Ooh!

995
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:27,411
If you've come to fumble
with my fastenings... Oh.

996
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:28,735
[Rattle jingles]

997
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:32,899
Mrs Quickly, we're very sorry about the tea
you had with our father.

998
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,615
Typical of a man, sending his little ones
to do the dirty work.

999
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,254
No. He doesn't know we're...

1000
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,849
I mean, he very much wants to marry you.

1001
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:45,939
I know what he wanted.
No wonder there's so many of you (!)

1002
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:50,452
Wait. Father wasn't being rude.
No one on earth could be less rude.

1003
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:53,777
He was protecting you from
the naughty things we were doing.

1004
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,972
- The toad in the teapot.
- And the wormy sandwiches.

1005
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,490
That was my idea! I mean, my fault.

1006
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,578
I have no idea to what you can be referring.

1007
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:07,739
Don't try to make excuses for him.
He's a flounder and a gad.

1008
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,296
He's not. He's a good man.
He was just trying to save us.

1009
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:16,130
If he doesn't marry, all the money will go.
We'll be thrown out onto the streets.

1010
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:20,049
- Money? What money?
- Our Great-Aunt Adelaide's money.

1011
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,649
Lady Adelaide Stitch.

1012
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:25,454
Lady? Ooh!

1013
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,577
- Mr Brown.
- Mrs Quickly.

1014
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:31,897
- Your children have explained it all.
- Explained?

1015
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:35,888
That their tricks during tea was a result
of their motherless condition,

1016
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,614
that they need a woman's presence
to calm them,

1017
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,459
and that you could benefit from that presence,

1018
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:43,730
pathetic and lonely as you are.

1019
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:49,731
And all it takes is one little question, Cedric.
[Clears throat]

1020
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,137
Oh. Oh, y... er... yes, of course.

1021
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,615
Erm... just give me... Yes.

1022
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:00,771
- Mrs Quickly...
- [whispers] Selma.

1023
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,777
Yes, I mean Selma.

1024
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:06,973
Would you do me the honour
of becoming my...

1025
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,253
- ..of becoming my...
- Wife.

1026
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:17,534
- Exactly. Wife. That's the word.
- Yes. Oh, yes, Cedric.

1027
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:21,139
Mmm.... mwa!

1028
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:25,613
Off you go now, dears.

1029
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:30,530
Let Daddy have a little moment to himself
with your new mummy.

1030
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:39,738
(Nanny McPhee) A bit big for this nightie, aren't
you, sweetheart? We'll have a new one made.

1031
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:51,136
I'm sorry.

1032
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:56,736
I should have told you. I can see that now.

1033
01:08:56,940 --> 01:09:00,649
If I'd discussed it with you before,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

1034
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:05,053
No, it was our fault.

1035
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:11,129
We should have known you had
a good reason for getting married.

1036
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:17,415
At least this way, we'll all be together.
That's what matters most, isn't it? Hm?

1037
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,851
I promise I'll never hide anything
that affects us from you again.

1038
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,018
I see you're more than capable
of understanding it.

1039
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,298
- Papa?
- Yes, my boy?

1040
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:32,573
Do you think Mama still thinks about us
where she is?

1041
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:37,410
I'm sure she does.

1042
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,256
I know she does.

1043
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:50,499
Now, Chrissie,
why don't you choose us a story?

1044
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,968
[Woman]  Tiptoe by

1045
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:58,570
-  Where my babies lie...
- Lesson four is complete.

1046
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:02,090
 In your tiny silver shoon...

1047
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,609
Lesson four?

1048
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,374
To listen.

1049
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:12,818
Well done.

1050
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:18,333
 Will you watch over, please

1051
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:21,612
 My wee ones

1052
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:25,096

 Loola-bye, oh, loola-bye

1055
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:50,777
 In your tiny silver shoon

- [church bells ring]
- [lamb bleats]

1057
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,298
[Mrs Quickly] The big day.
I do love my weddings.

1058
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,968
Mr Brown. What's he really like?

1059
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:03,774
No idea. Keen as mustard
to tie the knot, though.

1060
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:07,575
Had to sort this out quick.
Only got the sheep dipped yesterday.

1061
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:11,455
But he's easily controlled,
unlike his nasty little brood.

1062
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:14,049
However will you manage them, Selma?

1063
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:17,058
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.
Never you mind.

1064
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:20,093
I started off by giving them a good clean-up.

1065
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,450
Oh, don't they look lovely?

1066
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,973
Sebastian, your top button is undone.

1067
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:31,332
Lily, you have a little hair caught
in your crook. Eric, help her, please.

1068
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:34,259
Your father will be down in a moment.

1069
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:38,931
Now, that is an improvement.
Letty, go and keep a lookout.

1070
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,976
I say, whatever your name is,

1071
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:45,172
give me a second on my own
with the little darlings?

1072
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:54,610
Now, my dears, there's going to be
some changes made round here.

1073
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,450
I'm in charge of this household now

1074
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:02,972
and while I'm in charge,
you children will behave.

1075
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:06,775
Do you hear? Behave.

1076
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:11,178
- [Aggy jingles rattle]
- Behave.

1077
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:18,335
And we're not having any of that nasty noise
all the way through my nice wedding.

1078
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:23,250
- [Grizzles uncertainly, then sobs]
- Shut her up.

1079
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,732
Naughty.

1080
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:29,135
It's our mother's rattle. Give it back.

1081
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,410
I'm your mother now.

1082
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,811
Time to adapt.

1083
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:43,851
- [Magical breeze sighs]
- Hm.

01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,771
- Papa, Mrs Quickly...
- Sh!

1086
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,050
Yoo-hoo, Cedric.

1087
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:55,650
I realise the bride and groom
shouldn't meet until the ceremony,

1088
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,613
- but you and I are old hands at this.
- [Hoofbeats]

1089
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:02,779
- [horse whinnies]
- She's here! Lady Stitch!
