Say, uh, Daisy Lou,

6
00:00:56,374 --> 00:00:58,501
would you like to hear
a tune?

7
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:04,748
Eh, cousin...

You're wonderful!

11
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:25,428
Sweetheart,
I'll talk to him.

12
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,939
Son, your mother and me
would like for you

13
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:31,703
to cozy up
to the Finkelstein boy.

14
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:34,210
He's a bright kid,
and, uh...

15
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:36,770
he's going to
military school, and--

16
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:39,146
remember, he was
an Eagle Scout.

17
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:40,616
Arnold...

18
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:41,947
Will you shut up?

19
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,988
We're not going to have
a family brawl!

20
00:01:44,055 --> 00:01:45,454
...and a retard.

21
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,787
We've put up with
a hell of a lot.

Can this wait?

24
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:53,797
Build your goddamn
muscles, huh?

25
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:57,801
You know, you could build your
muscles picking strawberries.

26
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,803
You know,
bend and scoop...

27

28
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:04,241
Shit, maybe I could
get you a job

30
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,745
I got a buddy

31
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:10,246
Get you started.

32

Start
with strawberries,

33
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:15,752
you might work your way up
to these goddamn bananas!

34
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,754
When, boy?

35
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:21,258
When...are you going to get
your act together?

Don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you!

43
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:41,511
You get a goddamn job
before sundown,

44
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,778
or we're shipping you off
to military school

go up in smoke

I know, but listen,

102
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:26,909
I slept in a ditch
last night, man.

103

I almost froze
my balls off.

you had any.

like your car, man.

Wow! Did you do this
yourself?

108

Yeah, I customized
it myself.

Hey, man, how far
you going, man?

133
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:51,000
Right here
would be fine, man.

134
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:54,700
You ain't scared of a little speed,
are you, man?

135

Oh, you got some speed,
man?

no speed, man.

got, though, man?

Oh, wow.
All right.

Chinese eyes, man.

142
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,725
What kind of joint
is this, man?

143
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:14,920
It's a heavy-duty
joint, man.

144
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:17,122
It looks like
a toothpick, man.

145
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:19,631
No, it's not
a toothpick, man.

146

It is a toothpick,
man.

00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:23,226
No, man,
it's just...

148

It is a toothpick.

149
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:28,474
I must've got it in
the other pocket, man.

154
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:41,253
Light that
sucker up, man.

155
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,255
We'll go to the moon.

156

bigger than this, man.

to get out and walk?

to get high, man?

wooden balls, man?

Fire it up.

I hope the drums
don't mess up

164

165

too, man.

00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:12,309
We play everything from Santana
to El Chicano, man.

169
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:15,913
Hey, I'm just a love machine

170
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:19,356
And I don't work
for nobody but you

171
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:21,326
I'm just a love machine

172
00:11:21,395 --> 00:11:24,125
And I don't work
for nobody but you

173
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,664
Woman, my temperature rise

174
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:27,825
And then I go
for her thighs

175
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,334
And then I say...

176
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:31,735
(Singing In Spanish)

177
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:39,802
(Speaking In Spanish)

178
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,747
Is that a joint, man?

179
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:47,753
That there looks like
a quarter pounder, man.

180
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,914
There's a plane.

181
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,322
Hey, be careful
with that shit, man.

182
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:54,952
What, is it
heavy stuff, man?

183
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:57,223
Will it blow me away?

184
00:11:57,297 --> 00:11:58,764
You better put
your seat belt on, man.

185
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:00,231
I'll tell you that much.

186
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,167
I been smoking since
I was born, man.

187
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:05,170
I can smoke
anything, man.

188
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:07,206
I smoke
that Michoacan, man,

189
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:08,707
Acapulco Gold, man.

190
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,675
I even smoke that tied stick,
you know?

191
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:12,302
Tied stick?

192
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:15,177
That stuff that's
tied to a stick.

193
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:16,681
Oh, Thai stick.

194
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,479
That didn't even
do nothing to me.

195
00:12:18,552 --> 00:12:21,214
I could probably
smoke this whole joint

196
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:23,017
and still
walk away, man.

197
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,921
It wouldn't be
no problem at all, man.

198
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:29,188
Toke. Toke it out,
man.

199
00:12:29,262 --> 00:12:31,230
(Mumbling)

200
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,257
Kind of grabs you
by the boo-boo, don't it?

201
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:38,236
Hey, man...

202
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:39,738
What?

203
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:41,740
What?

204
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:44,242
Oh!

205
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:47,337
Hey, what's in
this shit, man?

206
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:50,247
Mostly Maui-wowie,
man.

207
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:51,750
Yeah?

208
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:54,753
But it's got
some Labrador in it.

209
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,254
What's Labrador?

210
00:12:56,323 --> 00:12:57,756
It's dog shit.

211
00:12:57,824 --> 00:12:59,121
What?

212
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:02,787
Yeah, my dog ate
my stash, man.

213
00:13:02,863 --> 00:13:04,194
Had it on the table,

214
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:06,494
and the little
motherfucker ate it, man.

215
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:07,692
Yeah?

216
00:13:07,768 --> 00:13:10,703
I had to follow him around
with a little baggie

217
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:12,705
for three days
before I got it back.

218
00:13:12,773 --> 00:13:14,707
Really blew
the dog's mind.

219
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:18,506
You mean we're smoking
dog shit, man?

220
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:21,570
Gets you high,
don't it?

221
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:22,808
(Radio)
...hoppin'an'a-boppin'

222
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:24,373
And a-singin'his song

223
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:27,113
All the little birds
on Jaybird Street

224
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:29,678
Love to hear the robin
go tweet, tweet, tweet

225
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:30,745
Rockin'robin

226
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:32,223
Tweet, tweet, tweet

227
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:33,486
Rock, rock,
rockin'robin

228
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,720
Tweet...

229
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:38,231
I think it's even
better than before, you know?

230
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:42,234
I wonder what Great Dane
tastes like, man.

231
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:44,736
Ah, man.

232
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:49,242
That's some
heavy shit, man.

233
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:51,243
Yeah.

234
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:01,185
Hey, man...

235
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:03,688
am I driving okay?

236
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:11,179
I think
we're parked, man.

237
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:12,168
I think
we're parked, man.

238
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:14,408
Oh, shit.

239
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:18,185
Goddamn, what was
in that shit, man?

240
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:21,689
I never had no dope
like that in my life.

241
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:24,191
I smoked a lot
of shit before, man,

242
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,250
but goddamn, man,
that's heavy shit.

243
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:27,693
You okay?

244
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:29,697
I can't breathe.

245
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:31,255
What's the matter?

246
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,961
I can't breathe,
man.

247
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:35,696
Well, just...

248
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:37,204
Well, here.

249
00:14:37,272 --> 00:14:40,207
Here, I got something
that will mellow you out, man.

250
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:41,708
You're just
freaking out.

251
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:43,677
I never smoked no shit
like that before.

252
00:14:43,745 --> 00:14:45,679
Take these, man.

253
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:47,715
This will
mellow you out, man.

254
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:49,216
What is this, man?

255
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:51,218
Just take them.

256
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:55,454
Hey, don't take
those, man.

257
00:14:57,793 --> 00:14:59,283
What?

258
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:01,295
I almost gave you
the wrong shit, man.

259
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:03,126
I already took them,
man.

260
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,065
Ho ho ho ho!

261
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:09,069
What do you mean
ho ho ho ho?

262
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:10,570
Wow, man!

263
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,163
What was that shit,
man?

264
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,674
You just ate
the most acid

265
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:17,678
I've ever seen
anybody eat in my life.

266
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:19,680
I never had
no acid before, man.

267
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:22,683
I hope you're not busy
for about a month.

268
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:24,844
Shit, I'm going
to die, man.

269
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,854
That stuff's going
to make me die, man.

270
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:28,355
No, that's
good acid, man.

271
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:30,186
It's going to make
me freak out, man.

272
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:33,193
I've seen those guys
that had too many acid.

273
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:35,491
Their heads look like
a pumpkin, man.

274
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:37,191
Relax, man.

275
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:41,133
Hey, mellow out, man!

276
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:43,194
Now just go, ommmmm...

277
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:44,704
What?

278
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:46,206
Do it, man.

279
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:47,241
Ohhhhh.

280
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:48,708
Ommmmm.

281
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:50,369
Ommmmm.

282
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:51,377
Oh, shit.

283
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:53,710
Mellowwwww.

284
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:55,113
Mel...

285
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:56,377
Mellow.

286
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:59,716
Mellowwwww.

287
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:01,153
Yeah.

288
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:02,656
You better now, man?

289
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:04,157
Yeah.

290
00:16:04,226 --> 00:16:05,750
You mellow?

291
00:16:05,827 --> 00:16:07,158
Yeah.

292
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:09,663
You feel all right,
huh?

293
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:11,255
Yeah.

294
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,664
Aaaaah!

295
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:16,170
What are you doing,
man?

296
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:17,671
Sometimes that helps,
man.

297
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:20,173
Can we get off
this street, man?

298
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:22,176
We're parked
in a bad spot.

299
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:23,677
That's heavy, man.

300
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:25,679
The cops
just went by, man.

301
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:27,180
They're right there.

302
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:28,682
We're being
pulled over, man.

303
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,183
That's heavy, man.

304
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:31,685
Aahhhh!

305
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:33,186
They're coming, man!

306
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:34,517
Ha ha ha!

307
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:36,180
This is cool, man!

308
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:38,192
I never had it before.

309
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,629
I didn't think it was going
to be like this, man.

310
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:45,188
Ha ha ha!

311
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:46,700
What's
the problem, son?

312
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:49,532
Ha ha ha!

313
00:16:49,604 --> 00:16:51,071
Aahhhh!

314
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:52,606
Roll down
your window.

315
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:55,142
(Knocking On Window)

316
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,111
Keep on knocking,
but you can't come in

317
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:00,113
Don't, man.
It's the cops.

318
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:01,546
Ha ha ha!

319
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:04,141
Wait, I gotta roll down
the window, man.

320
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:05,652
Weigh the anchor!

321
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,654
How much does it weigh?

322
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,155
I don't know.
I forgot.

323
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:10,657
You forgot?

324
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:13,660
I saw that
on a movie once.

325
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:16,162
Can I see
your license, sir?

326
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:17,664
What?

327
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:19,165
Your license.
Where's your license?

328
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:22,328
It's on the bumper.
Back there, man.

329
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:24,668
No. I mean your
driver's license.

330
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,172
Oh. Oh, yeah!

331
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:28,766
Yeah, I got
my driver's license, man.

332
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:31,403
Hee hee hee!

333
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:34,676
I just thought of
something real funny, man.

334
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:36,182
Here's your mama.

335
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:38,185
Ha ha ha!

336
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:43,019
Sir, what is
your name?

337
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:44,490
Wh-What?

338
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,924
What's your name?

339
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:52,199
Isn't it on there
on the license, man?

340
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:55,202
Yeah, that's it.
Pedro de Pacas.

341
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,704
Just wait here
a minute, huh?

342
00:17:57,772 --> 00:17:59,205
Hey, hurry back!

343
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:01,139
I miss you already,
darling.

344
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,268
I gotta get rid
of this dope, man.

345
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:05,108
Don't act the fool.

346
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,647
Oh, okay.

347
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:08,148
We're gonna
get busted.

348
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:10,150
Hee hee hee!

349
00:18:13,722 --> 00:18:15,155
I'm blind!

350
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:17,123
Oh, shit!
I'm blind!

351
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:18,659
(Babbling)

352
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:20,160
Ha ha ha!

353
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:22,696
Hey, hey...

354
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:25,699
I can see clearly now,
the rain...

355
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,167
Hee hee hee!

356
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:31,171
Hey, how long does
this shit last, man?

357
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:33,673
And what is
your name, sir?

358
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:35,175
You scared me, man.

359
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:37,177
I told you my name.

360
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:38,678
Sir, what's
your name?

361
00:18:38,747 --> 00:18:40,180
(Coughing)

362
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:43,513
The dude wants to know
your name, man.

363
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:46,019
(Vomiting)

364
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:50,023
Uh, his name is
Raaalph, man.

365
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:51,888
I was sitting in
the coffee shop

366
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,587
Just minding my own affair

367
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:54,855
When all of a sudden

368
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:57,830
This policeman
caught me unaware, man

369
00:18:57,899 --> 00:18:59,423
He said,
''Is your name Pedro?''

370
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:00,832
I says,
''Uh, yeah, I guess so''

371
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:02,927
He said, ''Then come with me''

372
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:05,063
'''Cause you're the man
we've been looking for''

373
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,234
I said, ''Hey, man,
I've been framed!''

374
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:12,006
''Hey, no, really, man,
I was framed!''

375
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,641
''Aw, I never
do nothin' wrong, man''

376
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:18,208
''But every time,
I get the blame''

377
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:19,878
''I been framed!''

378
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:22,717
They put me in the line-up

379
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,624
And let
the bright lights shine

380
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:27,024
There was
1 0 poor dudes like me

381
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:29,120
Standing in that line

382
00:19:29,197 --> 00:19:32,724
I knew I was a victim
of somebody's evil plan

383
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:34,291
When this
scroungy-looking dude

384
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:36,269
Came up and said,
''Yeah, that's him, man''

385
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:41,070
Hey, wait a minute, man,
I've been framed, man!

386
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:44,111
Oh, listen to me,Judge,
I was framed!

387
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:46,739
I never do nothin' wrong

388
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,976
Oh, but every time,
I get the blame

389
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,486
Hey, I've been framed!

390
00:19:52,554 --> 00:19:55,614
You boys are in
a lot of trouble.

391
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,217
That dude gave me the first,
second, and third degree

392
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:03,356
He said, ''Where were you
on the night of July 29?''

393
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:05,626
I said, ''Man,
I was home in bed''

394
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,292
He said,
''Judge, that man's lying''

395
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:10,826
I said, ''Wait a minute, man,
I was framed, man!''

396
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,930
Hey, don't do this to me,
man, really

397
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:15,305
Because I think
I've been framed, man!

398
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:17,139
I never do nothin' wrong

399
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:21,012
Aw, but every time,
I get the blame

400
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:23,346
Aw, I was framed!

401
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:25,750
Fucking vodka, man!

402
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,220
(Laughter)

403
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:35,228
Oh, shit.

404
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:36,729
Hey, I'm down here.

405
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:38,231
I didn't see you.

406
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:40,733
You can sleep in that bedroom
right there, man.

407
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:42,235
Oh, okay.

408
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:43,736
Yeah, it's cool there.

409
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:48,241
Check you
in the morning.

410
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:49,742
Listen, where's
the bathroom?

411
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:51,745
It's right there.
See that door?

412
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,246
See you tomorrow.

413
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:54,747
We got rehearsal.

414
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:56,249
Okay.

415
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:59,252
Listen, if you hear some noise
in the bedroom,

416
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,686
it's just me
and my old lady.

417
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:04,190
Next tune you hear will be
dueling bedsprings.

418
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:06,659
Check you
in the morning.

419
00:21:06,728 --> 00:21:09,196
(Drums Playing)

420
00:21:09,264 --> 00:21:13,530
(Man) Amigos, presenting
y'all's new uniforms.

421
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:15,694
All right!

422
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,203
Lookit here!

423
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:18,705
Check it out!

424
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:21,537
Hey, man, I can't
wear this stuff, man.

425
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:23,042
This is terrible, man.

426
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:25,045
Look, it don't even fit.

427
00:21:25,113 --> 00:21:28,048
No, baby, you clean
as Skeeter's peter.

428
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:30,880
You just don't understand
the new style.

429
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:32,385
It's too short, man.

430
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:35,217
We'll just make a few minor
adjustments, homes.

431
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,917
Hold it, man.

432
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:38,424
I can't wear this.

433
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:40,188
Aw, Curtis, man!

434
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:41,728
My man!

435
00:21:41,796 --> 00:21:43,229
Look at
these uniforms!

436
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:44,636
Didn't I put them
in the pocket?

437
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,603
Didn't I put them
in the pocket?

438
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,605
These are
outta sight!

439
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,198
I hope mine is
as bad as this!

440
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,210
You see the new cuts
on them?

441
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,838
All we need is rhinestones
and pointed shoes!

442
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,542
Hey, these uniforms
are lame, man.

443
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,482
What you mean lame,
sucker?

444
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,144
Pedro, where's
the white dude

445
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,052
you said was
playing drums?

446
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,555
That's him, man.

447
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,819
That's James,
the bass player, man.

448
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,053
What's happening?

449
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,925
Seriously, man,
these look like waiter uniforms.

450
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,124
- You don't like them, man?
- No.

451
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,133
I'll be in the kitchen.

452
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,862
He's right, man.
These are lame.

453
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,337
This is the new cut.
Y'all be bad.

454
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:24,170
If we're going
to wear uniforms, man,

455
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,211
let's everybody wear
something different.

456
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,711
Yeah, that's it.

457
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,973
Everybody wears
something different

458
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,571
but the same, you know?

459
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,584
I gotta get
out of this stuff.

460
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,176
Hey...

461
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,188
Get us something else,
man.

462
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,247
Pedro,
this is Curtis, baby.

463
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,723
Yeah, I know Curtis,
man.

464
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,783
I'm on top of it.
Rest easy.

465
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,192
Curtis is
on the case.

466
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,823
Hurry up, man.
We gotta go score a lid.

467
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,193
(Starts Car)

468
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,201
(Radio) ...and we'd like
to rock-'n'- roll

469
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,702
and play some great music.

470
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,704
I have a song by
the Search Boys.

471
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,206
The Search Boys are going
to go searching.

472
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:59,711
Don't ask me what they're
going to go searching for,

473
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,439
but they're gonna go searching.

474
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,946
So, let's do it.

475
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:06,143
I searching

476
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,676
I searching

477
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:15,352
I searching
every which a-way

478
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:19,386
I searching, brother

479
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,661
I searching

480
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:28,468
I'm a-searching
every which-away-ay-ay

481
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,534
But I'd like to go
to the mountain

482
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:37,981
You know I dream
these things someday

483
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,177
Oh, hear what I say

484
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,584
I hear what you say

485
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,987
Where the Kona Gold
or Maui-wowie

486
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,548
We sold each other and need

487
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,025
We need...

488
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:53,394
(Pedro) I can't believe we can't
find no grass nowhere, man.

489
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,400
(Man Stoner)
Too many people are smoking it now.

490
00:23:56,468 --> 00:24:00,336
It really makes it tough
on the rest of us.

491
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,963
Yeah.

492
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,133
The prices have
gone crazy, man.

493
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,677
Some people pay
1 00 bucks a lid, man.

494
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,144
Wow!

495
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,646
Who lives here, man?

496
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,148
That's
my cousin Strawberry.

497
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,649
He's probably got
some dope.

498
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,652
He's always got
the best smoke.

499
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,153
I hope so, man.

500
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,654
Yeah, well, he's cool.

501
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,156
He's a little weird.

502
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,158
He went over
to Vietnam, man,

503
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,161
and he came back
all weirded out, you know.

504
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,164
That Nam grass
will do it to you, man.

505
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,167
That stuff will
lay you out, man.

506
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,169
That's what lost the war.

507
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,171
Whatever you do,
don't say nothing

508
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,673
about his birthmark,
because he flips out.

509
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:39,176
I ain't going to talk about
nobody's birthmark.

510
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,178
Don't look at it,
either.

511
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,679
Come on.

512
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,682
You sure it's
a birthmark, man?

513
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,184
Sometimes that Nam grass
will do weird things

514
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,686
to your face, too,
you know.

515

(Knock Knock)

516
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,689
Who is it?

517
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:54,191
It's me--Pedro, man.

518
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,954
Pedro's not here.

519
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:59,087
No, I'm Pedro, man.
Open up.

520
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,529
What's the matter, man?

521
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,533
Somebody's messing
around, man.

522
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:06,628
Come on.
It's open, man.

523
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,439
Hey, Strawberry!

524
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,976
Strawberry's not here.

(Whistles)

526
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,145
Hey, it's a bird.

527
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,147
A bird is
answering the door.

528
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,648
Aw, wow!

529
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,150
What a trip.

530
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,651
Hey, fella.

531
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,914
Hey, Strawberry?

532
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,048
Wanna get high?
Wanna get high?

533
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,649
Must've had
a party here, man.

534
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,160
Wanna get high?

535
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,389
Wanna get high?
Wanna get high?

536
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,661
Hey, want something
to eat, man?

537
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,167
They got some pizza.

538
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,429
Strawberry?

539
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,164
Strawberry?

540
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:43,173
(Record Skipping)

541
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,175
Hey, Strawberry?

542
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,580
(Crash)

543
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,183
Oh, Strawberry.

544
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,186
Hey, what's
happening, man?

545
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,188
How you doing?

546
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,625
(Bird)
Starbuck! Starbuck!

547
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:02,625
Pedro?

548
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,662
Yeah, yeah, right.
Pedro, man.

549
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,129
This is my friend...

550
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,632
uh...

551
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,792
Strawberry.

552
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,132
(Man Stoner)
Hey, how you doing, man?

553
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:15,139
I'm doing, friend.

554
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,640
Um, oh, yeah!

555
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,141
Well, we were stopping by

556
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,304
to see if we could score
some smoke, man.

557
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,279
Nobody's got none,
you know?

558
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,781
So, like,
we was wondering

559
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,148
if we could score
some smoke from you.

560
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,652
Smoke?
You want some smoke?

561
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,154
I'll get you
some smoke, man.

562
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,656
All right. Yeah.

563
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:35,124
I told you we could
score some from him.

564
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,093
What you looking at,
man?

565
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,595
Oh, nothing!

566
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,961
I wasn't looking.
I was just...

567
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,796
I wasn't looking
at his neck, man.

568
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,803
Your friend
better stay here.

569
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:48,169
We're going to go see
some people of mine,

570
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,175
and they don't like
strange dudes.

571
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,676
They don't fuck around.

572
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,542
- Well, I'll stay here.
- Yeah.

573
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:08,125
Ah, look at that, man.
The great outdoors, huh?

574
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,661
Yeah, great outdoors.

Hey, how you doing?

583
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,577
I spilled--
I made a mess.

00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,122
I was just trying...

585
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,623
Oh, where have you been
all my life?

586
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,025
- We just come in...
- If you don't mind...

587
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,289
It's not really...

Oh, is that great?

596
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,594
What a rush, huh?
What's that stuff like?

597
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:52,595
Good shit.

598
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,109
The freak
with the top hat

599
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,609
is leaving
with the basketball.

600
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,804
Cover the freak.

601
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,312
He's covered.

602
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:12,316
Have the rest of the men
stand by.

603

Stand by.

I think we're onto something
really big, Harry.

605

This could be the bust
we've been waiting for.

614

Get me up past
that last hutch

615
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,143
and jettison me
into the paddies.

talking about paddies?

talking about?

bust your pad!

00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:55,815
Hey, there's coke
and everything, man.

660
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:58,512
Pedro, the place
is full of joints.

661
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:00,020
Come on back, man.

662
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:02,079
This could be it,
Harry.

663
00:32:02,157 --> 00:32:03,590
(Chambers Pistol Round)

664
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:05,091
Pass the word
along.

665
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,627
Tell the men

666
00:32:06,695 --> 00:32:09,425
it's time to
shoot the moon.

667
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:12,166
Shoot the moon!

668
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,168
No, you idiot!
Not out there!

669
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:16,704
On the microphone!
On the microphone.

670
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:19,297
Shoot the moon.
Shoot the moon.

671
00:32:19,374 --> 00:32:22,707
Hello? Can't hear you, man.
Just a minute.

672
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:26,510
Hello.

673
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:29,982
Hey, Pedro?
We get cut off?

674
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,954
We really did get cut off.

675
00:32:34,022 --> 00:32:35,683
(Rattles Door)

676
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:37,190
(Clicking Receiver)

677
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,523
Hey. Hey. Hello?

678
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:43,360
Shit, man. How am I going to
get him out of there?

679
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:45,331
Hey! Hey!

680
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,205
All right! Freeze!
This is a bust!

681
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:53,707
The party's over, folks.
You, out.

682
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:56,767
You, freak there
with the red coat--no, no.

683
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:04,610
Don't swallow the dope.
We know you're holding.

684
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:07,280
Just how well do you know
that freak with the basketball?

685
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:08,720
Which basketball?

686
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,816
Sergeant,
get a load of these two.

687
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:13,326
(Sergeant)
What's her problem?

688
00:33:13,395 --> 00:33:15,295
(Woman)
Can't you see she's sick?

689
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:16,728
She's sick, all right.

690
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:18,698
It's turning
blue.

691
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:20,701
Yeah?
That's high-grade stuff.

692
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:22,202
Could be Peruvian flake.

693
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,204
That's right.
Keep laughing, miss.

694
00:33:24,272 --> 00:33:25,705
Just keep on laughing,

695
00:33:25,774 --> 00:33:28,504
but this is not
a laughing matter.

696
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:30,010
This is serious!

697
00:33:30,078 --> 00:33:31,978
This stuff
destroys your mind!

698
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:35,244
Can't you see she's sick?
She's been through a lot.

699
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:36,750
She's all fucked up.

700
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:39,150
You watch
your language, miss.

701
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:43,055
Harry, remember to get
a lab sample of this stuff.

702
00:33:43,124 --> 00:33:46,059
You have the right
to remain silent.

703
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:48,425
If you refuse that right,

704
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:51,431
anything you say
may be used against you.

705
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:53,023
Have you got
the book?

706
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:54,125
No, sir.

707
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:57,035
Used against you in a...
in a court of law.

708
00:33:57,105 --> 00:33:58,538
Read the book!

709
00:33:58,607 --> 00:34:00,097
Thank you.

710
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:01,107
Jesus!

711
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:03,610
You have the right
to remain silent.

712
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:06,112
If you
give that right up....

713
00:34:06,181 --> 00:34:08,615
What's going on here?
Hey, who are you?

714
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:10,617
We're from
the finance company.

715
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:13,620
We came to reprocess
the furniture, man.

716
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:15,121
That?

717
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,627
Yeah. We gave them
a lot of chances to pay up,

718
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:21,628
but they didn't
pay up.

719
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:24,631
Boss says
it's got to go, man.

720
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,633
I'm just
doing my job.

721
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:29,135
All right! Everybody out!
Move everybody out!

722
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:30,569
That means you,
buddy.

723
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,938
What the hell
are you doing, Murphy?

724
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:37,445
All of you, come on.
Let's go. Get out.

725
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:38,638
Everybody.

726
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,145
- It's locked, man.
- Oh, yeah.

727
00:34:45,553 --> 00:34:46,679
Let go.

728
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:48,313
Let go, man.

729
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:51,524
What's going on, man?

730
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:53,026
It's a bust.

731
00:34:53,094 --> 00:34:56,860
We got to figure out some way
to get you out of here. Shit.

732
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:16,742
(Bird) All right, freeze.
This is a bust. Strawberry.

733
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:18,911
Ha ha ha ha!

734
00:35:18,987 --> 00:35:19,919
Single file.

735
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:21,717
I wasn't looking
at his neck.

736
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,722
I wasn't looking--

737
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:23,780
(Gunshot)

738
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:27,794
No, man.
The town's dry.

739
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:29,625
There ain't no dope
nowhere, man.

740
00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:31,632
I got to pee.

741
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,134
Hey, Pedro.

742
00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:37,638
Hey, Pedro, my man.

743
00:35:37,706 --> 00:35:39,139
What's happening,
Curtis?

744
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:40,640
What's going on?

745
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:42,142
How you doing, man?

746
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,144
Oh, I don't know.
Hey, this your ride?

747
00:35:44,212 --> 00:35:45,144
Yeah.

748
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:46,305
Wow.

749
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:48,144
I got it off

750
00:35:48,216 --> 00:35:49,649

751
00:35:49,718 --> 00:35:51,151
I mean, this bad
low machine is yours?

752
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:52,151
Yeah.

753
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,619
Oh, Pedro.
You got a taste of soul.

754
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:55,121
And style, too.

755
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,623
Yeah, I hear you.

756
00:35:56,691 --> 00:35:58,158
You know
what you need

757
00:35:58,226 --> 00:36:00,592
to go with
this bad ride?

758
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:02,061
A chick?

759
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,427
No, baby.
Check these out.

760
00:36:03,498 --> 00:36:04,430
Knuckles?

761
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:05,488
Genuine diamonds,
baby.

762
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:08,001
Those ain't
for-real diamonds, man.

763
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:11,004
What you--Hey, man!
Check this out. Step back.

764
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:13,438
Ain't for real?

765
00:36:13,508 --> 00:36:14,532
(Scratching)

766
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:18,067
What are you doing?
You scratched my window.

767
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:20,114
You know, it's cool.
It's cool.

768
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:21,614
You know
what I do need?

769
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:23,082
We been looking
for some smoke.

770
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:24,243
You got some?

771
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:27,117
Hey, man, I got some weed
straight from Turkey.

772
00:36:27,188 --> 00:36:28,621
It's what
set them Arabs off.

773
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,123
Arabs from Turkey?

774
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:31,783
Yeah, man.
They was from Turkey.

775
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,953
This stuff will put a hump
in a camel's back.

776
00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:35,155
No shit?

777
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,131
I wouldn't shit you, baby.
This is some bad weed.

778
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,632
You got it

779
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:41,635
It'll boogie-woogie
on your brain.

780
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:42,635
All right.

781

00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:48,642

784
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,586
(Man Stoner)
Man, this shit ain't shit, man.

785
00:37:01,656 --> 00:37:02,588
(Pedro)
What?

786
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:04,090
We smoked this whole lid,

787
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,617

00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:09,595
You mean

789
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:12,599
I ain't high.

Go in the kitchen.

799
00:37:28,103 --> 00:37:30,867
You must get high

800
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:32,372

He came through

805
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,575
If he sold you that,

806
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:44,676
Hey. Hey, man, hide.

807
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:50,789
Freeze, you chili-chokin'

00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:55,962
I'll check the rooms

810
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:58,022

00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:00,033
Hey, man.

It's a bust, man.
Get the seeds.

814
00:38:03,605 --> 00:38:04,629

Yeah.

816
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,038
Why, man? They can't

817
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:09,576
Then just

818
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:11,077
We ain't done

819
00:38:11,146 --> 00:38:12,579
It's a bust, man.

820
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:14,308
We're clean.
There's no weed.

821
00:38:14,382 --> 00:38:15,314
Shh...

822
00:38:15,383 --> 00:38:16,816
What's going on?

823
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:18,853
Oh, man.
It's just the migra.

824
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,319
Who?

825
00:38:20,388 --> 00:38:21,821
Oh, I forgot.
Shit.

826
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:22,822
Migra?

827
00:38:22,891 --> 00:38:24,825
They're looking
for illegal aliens.

828
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:26,827
I forgot
it's the wedding.

829
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:27,827
The wedding?

830
00:38:27,896 --> 00:38:28,828
Yeah.

831
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:30,558
So, who are these guys?

832
00:38:30,632 --> 00:38:32,566
They're the immigration.
You know, the migra.

833
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:34,226
They're going to
deport these dudes.

834
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:35,462
Deport them?

835
00:38:35,537 --> 00:38:36,936
Yeah.
See, my cousin

836
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:39,064
is getting married
down at TJ, man,

837
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,574
so he calls the immigration
on himself.

838
00:38:41,643 --> 00:38:42,575
But why?

839
00:38:42,644 --> 00:38:44,578
So he can get
a free ride, man.

840
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:46,841
They take the whole
wedding party,

841
00:38:46,915 --> 00:38:49,076
plus they even
get fed lunch, man.

842
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,583
So we're cool?

843
00:38:50,652 --> 00:38:53,086
Yeah. We got nothin'
to worry about, man,

844
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:55,179
unless you don't got
a green card.

845
00:39:03,598 --> 00:39:05,031
(Honking)

846
00:39:09,604 --> 00:39:12,038
Hello, Uncle Chuey.
This is Pedro.

847
00:39:12,107 --> 00:39:16,043
Hey, man, we got deported.
We're in Tijuana right now.

848
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:18,045
We need a way to get back.

849
00:39:18,113 --> 00:39:21,549
You got anything
needs to be picked up here?

850
00:39:21,616 --> 00:39:23,049
Oh, yeah?

851
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:25,052
Yeah. Yeah. Oh--
Hold on.

852
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:28,050
No. No. Gracias.

853
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:29,715
Okay, what's the address?

854
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:31,383
1 -8-1 -1 .

855
00:39:33,294 --> 00:39:35,057
(Honking)

856
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,064
Hey, toro.

857
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:40,067
Hey. Hey, man.
We got a ride.

858
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:41,568
Far out, man.

859
00:39:41,636 --> 00:39:43,570
My Uncle Chuey's
got a van

860
00:39:43,638 --> 00:39:45,572
we gotta smuggle
across the border.

861
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,073
What are we
smuggling?

862
00:39:47,142 --> 00:39:48,200
Upholstery, man.

863
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:50,574
He's got an upholstery shop
in Beverly Hills,

864
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:53,079
but he gets cheaper work
done here, man.

865
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:55,582
(Sergeant Stedenko)
The smuggling of marijuana

866
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,084
from Mexico
into the United States

867
00:39:58,153 --> 00:40:00,087
has reached
a dangerous high.

868
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:02,146
The methods have become
unbelievably devious,

869
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:03,656
and these seeds

870
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:06,091
may sow the destruction
of the human race.

871
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:09,096
Gentlemen, I don't think
we need to comment

872
00:40:09,164 --> 00:40:11,598
on the seriousness
of the situation.

873
00:40:13,735 --> 00:40:16,533
Harry, will you cool that?
Stop that, Harry.

874
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:20,607
Gentlemen,
we are on the threshold

875
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:24,111
of copping one of the largest
shipments of marijuana

876
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:27,945
ever to cross the Mexican border
into the United States.

877
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:29,449
The question is,

878
00:40:29,517 --> 00:40:33,453
how are they going to
transport it across the border?

879
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:35,455
- By boat.
- Carrier pigeon.

880
00:40:35,523 --> 00:40:36,455
Freight.

881
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:37,456
Piggyback.

882
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:38,457
Plaster casts.

883
00:40:38,526 --> 00:40:40,016
Long trucks.
Long trucks.

884
00:40:40,095 --> 00:40:41,619
Let me show you.

885
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:45,398
Inside TV sets.

886
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:48,903
No, Harry. No, no, no.
Not inside TV sets.

887
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,905
The TV set itself
is the marijuana--

888
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:55,409
the tube, the picture,
the aerial, the whole works.

889
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:59,413
How can you make a TV set
out of marijuana?

890
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:03,383
That's a good question, Harry.
I'll show you.

891
00:41:03,451 --> 00:41:06,386
Now, the weed
is separated from seed.

892
00:41:06,454 --> 00:41:09,389
The weed is then transformed
into liquid.

893
00:41:09,457 --> 00:41:10,981
The liquid is then acted upon

894
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:13,994
by a chemical
which makes it hard

895
00:41:14,062 --> 00:41:15,495
like a plastic.

896
00:41:15,563 --> 00:41:19,090
The plastic is then
transformed into a spray.

897
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:22,102
This spray, gentlemen,
is called fiberweed,

898
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,866
and it's pure marijuana.

899
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:27,237
Thanks to the efforts
of our undercover man

900
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:29,742
inside the dope factory,

901
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:32,109
we have some
very interesting facts.

902
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,614
That is quite a quantity
of marijuana, gentlemen.

903
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:36,274
It is not a lid
or kilo or gram.

904
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:38,114
How much do you think
is here?

905
00:41:38,186 --> 00:41:39,949
A million
pounds.

906
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:40,953
Harry?

907
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:42,455
A shit-load.

908
00:41:42,524 --> 00:41:43,957
Harry!

909
00:41:44,025 --> 00:41:47,825
We do know that
the dope factory's disguised

910
00:41:47,896 --> 00:41:49,329
as an upholstery warehouse.

911
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:54,634
Hey, this is
the street, man. Come on.

912
00:41:54,702 --> 00:41:56,636
How can you
eat this stuff?

913
00:41:56,704 --> 00:41:58,638
I love them.
Don't you like these?

914
00:41:58,706 --> 00:42:00,571
I told you not to
buy it, Man. God.

915
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,576
What did you
do that for, man?

916
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:04,077
I would have ate it.

917
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:06,079
A dog could be
in that stuff.

918
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:08,012
You got
the address?

919
00:42:08,082 --> 00:42:09,515
Good dog, man.

920
00:42:09,584 --> 00:42:11,074
Hey!

921
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:13,086
Son of a...

922
00:42:13,154 --> 00:42:14,849
1 -8-1 --

923
00:42:14,923 --> 00:42:17,858
Is that 7 or 1 ?
Ah, it's 7. Come on.

924
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:20,952
Let's go check
this place out.

925
00:42:31,172 --> 00:42:33,606
Hey, we're here
to pick up the van, man.

926
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:34,767
Shh!

927
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,607
(Whispering)
We're here to pick up the van.

928
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,112
Have a seat.

929
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,614
The boss will be
right back.

930
00:42:41,683 --> 00:42:44,151
Okay, the boss
will be right back, man.

931
00:42:49,724 --> 00:42:51,157
Those burritos, man.

932
00:42:51,226 --> 00:42:53,160
Hey, man,
where's the bathroom?

933
00:42:53,228 --> 00:42:54,661
Straight
in the back.

934
00:42:54,729 --> 00:42:56,492
Yeah. Thanks.

935
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:02,368
Come on, cheeks.
Come on. Tighten up.

936
00:43:02,437 --> 00:43:04,371
(Machines Make
Farting Sounds)

937
00:43:09,777 --> 00:43:11,768
Come on, cheeks.
Stay together.

938
00:43:11,846 --> 00:43:14,110
Let's stay together.

939
00:43:14,182 --> 00:43:16,082
(Loud Machinery Noise)

940
00:43:22,624 --> 00:43:25,252
Come on, cheeks.
Stay together. Oh.

941
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:26,258
(Sizzle)

942
00:43:26,327 --> 00:43:29,262
Oh, God.
I hope that was a fart.

943
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,594
Oh, shit. Ah...

944
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:33,099
excuse me, sir.

945
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:34,600
(Machinery Noise)

946
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:35,601
What?

947
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,604
Where's
the toilet?

948
00:43:37,672 --> 00:43:39,401
Over there.

949
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:47,613
Hey, excuse me.
Where's the toilet?

950
00:43:47,682 --> 00:43:50,116
Oh, thank you very much.

951
00:43:50,184 --> 00:43:51,617
Oh, shit.

952
00:43:57,292 --> 00:43:59,760
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

953
00:43:59,827 --> 00:44:01,226
(Muffled Voice)

954
00:44:06,634 --> 00:44:10,570
Man, did you eat
one of them burritos, too, man?

955
00:44:10,638 --> 00:44:12,071
Supposed to be eating

956
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,574
a little bit
of ice cream with it.

957
00:44:14,642 --> 00:44:17,076
Come on, ice cream!

958
00:44:17,145 --> 00:44:20,581
Even though we do not know
what we are looking for,

959
00:44:20,648 --> 00:44:24,846
we do know the approximate value
of the weed itself.

960
00:44:24,919 --> 00:44:27,888
Gentlemen, I would like
to hear your opinions.

961
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,583
A million?

962
00:44:29,657 --> 00:44:33,184
The television set alone
is worth close to a million.

963
00:44:33,261 --> 00:44:34,626
- A billion dollars.
- Now we're getting somewhere.

964
00:44:34,696 --> 00:44:36,630
I'm freezing
at 200 million.

965
00:44:36,698 --> 00:44:39,826
- Sarge, I think it's four billion.
- You're all wrong.

966
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:43,268
Nine billion big ones, boys.

967
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:46,205
And you know
what that means.

968
00:44:46,274 --> 00:44:47,707
The better the bust...

969
00:44:47,775 --> 00:44:50,710
- the bigger the boost.
- the bigger the boost.

970
00:44:50,778 --> 00:44:52,302
Excellent.

971
00:44:54,182 --> 00:44:57,618
Well, I guess
that about wraps it up.

972
00:44:57,685 --> 00:44:59,410
Any questions?

973
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:08,017
(Flies Buzzing)

974
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:03,505
(Pedro) Where'd you learn how
to roll them big joints, man?

975
00:46:03,574 --> 00:46:05,508
You like that, man?

976
00:46:05,576 --> 00:46:07,009
Whoa. They're heavy.

977
00:46:07,078 --> 00:46:11,014
I used to be a roadie
for the Doobie Brothers.

978
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:13,016
What a groovy gig.

979
00:46:13,084 --> 00:46:16,520
Yeah. That's how I learned
to play drums.

980
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:17,519
Oh, yeah?

981
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:19,021
Beating
on the drums.

982
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:23,026
Hey, I dig Mexico,
man.

983
00:46:23,094 --> 00:46:25,528
I'd like to
come back here

984
00:46:25,596 --> 00:46:27,530
When
we got more time.

985
00:46:27,598 --> 00:46:29,532
Are we at
the border already?

986
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,033
Looks that way, man.

987
00:46:31,102 --> 00:46:32,763
Shit. Hey, man,
get rid of the stuff.

988
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:34,031
Oh, yeah.

989
00:46:34,105 --> 00:46:36,539
Better get rid
of this shit.

990
00:46:36,607 --> 00:46:37,539
(Inhales Deeply)

991
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:40,543
Man, put it down.
Get rid of it.

992
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:42,272
We're at the border,
man.

993
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:44,177
Shit.

994
00:46:44,248 --> 00:46:45,545
Oh, lookit.

995
00:46:46,717 --> 00:46:48,048
(Puffing)

996
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:52,884
Hey, get rid of it!
Not that way, man.

997
00:46:52,957 --> 00:46:54,390
Throw it out!

998
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:55,892
Throw it out.

999
00:46:58,129 --> 00:46:59,221
(Honking)

1000
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,995
This is Toyota Kawasaki

1001
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:07,003
here at the Mexican-
United States border

1002
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:11,007
where a huge task force
of narcotic and customs agents

1003
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:13,009
is preparing a surprise welcome
for a vehicle

1004
00:47:13,077 --> 00:47:15,170
which they
say is constructed

1005
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:17,476
entirely of
high-grade marijuana.

1006
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:19,914
Don't make that face,
man.

1007
00:47:19,984 --> 00:47:21,417
You make me laugh.

1008
00:47:21,486 --> 00:47:24,421
Okay, just let me
do all the talking.

1009
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:25,922
Good afternoon,
sisters.

1010
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,981
Good afternoon,
officer.

1011
00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:30,254
How long have you
been in Mexico?

1012
00:47:30,328 --> 00:47:31,761
Okay, just be cool.

1013
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:34,764
How long have you guys
been in Mexico?

1014
00:47:34,832 --> 00:47:37,266
A week--
I mean, a day.

1015
00:47:37,335 --> 00:47:38,768
Which one is it,

1016
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:40,667
a week or a day?

1017
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:41,670
A weekday.

1018
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:43,536
You got
any narcotics

1019
00:47:43,608 --> 00:47:45,041
or marijuana
in here?

1020
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:46,041
(Coughs)

1021
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:47,543
Uh, not anymore.

1022
00:47:47,612 --> 00:47:51,173
You guys better step out
of that van.

1023
00:47:51,249 --> 00:47:52,944
Aah! I'm on fire!

1024
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:54,746
Oh, Sister
is on fire!

1025
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:57,811
(Dog Barking)

1026
00:47:59,257 --> 00:48:01,282
Hey, this looks
like a bust.

1027
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,520
Get Stedenko on the phone.
This may be it.

1028
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:06,757
Hey, come on.
What have we got here, Sister?

1029
00:48:06,831 --> 00:48:08,924
Hey, they're busting
nuns, man.

1030
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,991
Wow.
That's cold-blooded.

1031
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:12,535
Hey, let's watch.

1032
00:48:14,906 --> 00:48:16,999
Okay, up against the wall.
All of you.

1033
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:18,507
Spread them.

1034
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:20,134
Let's get up
against the wall.

1035
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:22,008
(Kawasaki)
Sergeant Stedenko,

1036
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,014
exactly what
are you looking for?

1037
00:48:25,082 --> 00:48:26,515
Dope, drugs,
weed, grass,

1038
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:28,017
toot, smack,
quackers,

1039
00:48:28,085 --> 00:48:30,019
uppers, downers,
all-arounders.

1040
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:32,521
You name it,
we want it.

1041
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,525
And how important
is it to you

1042
00:48:35,593 --> 00:48:36,992
to apprehend
the suspects?

1043
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:39,188
Critical-- The buying and selling
of dope in this country

1044
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:41,697
may be the last vestige
of free enterprise left.

1045
00:48:41,766 --> 00:48:43,199
There's rumor,
Sergeant,

1046
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:45,701
that the suspects
might be armed and dangerous.

1047
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:48,534
Do you expect
to see any violence here today?

1048
00:48:48,606 --> 00:48:50,039
I certainly
hope so.

1049
00:48:50,107 --> 00:48:51,870
Sergeant, have you yourself
smoked marijuana?

1050
00:48:51,943 --> 00:48:52,967
Only once.

1051
00:48:53,044 --> 00:48:54,534
Hey, look,
we're on TV, man.

1052
00:48:54,612 --> 00:48:55,544
Sergeant, telephone.

1053
00:48:55,613 --> 00:48:56,545
Hi, Mom.

1054
00:48:56,614 --> 00:48:58,047
This could be it.

1055
00:48:58,115 --> 00:49:00,379
(Man Stoner)
Why are there so many cops?

1056
00:49:00,451 --> 00:49:01,884
Let's find out.

1057
00:49:01,953 --> 00:49:04,319
Listen, I got to
go pee first.

1058
00:49:04,388 --> 00:49:05,980
Okay, don't go
scuba diving.

1059
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:14,297
So it was a station wagon,
huh, Harry?

1060
00:49:14,365 --> 00:49:15,798
Very devious.

1061
00:49:15,866 --> 00:49:18,801
And they almost
look like real nuns,

1062
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:20,302
don't they, Harry?

1063
00:49:20,371 --> 00:49:21,804
Down to
the stockings.

1064
00:49:21,872 --> 00:49:23,601
Very clever.
Very clever.

1065
00:49:26,577 --> 00:49:28,010
Not bad.

1066
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,013
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself,

1067
00:49:30,081 --> 00:49:31,514
you know that?

1068
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:34,016
Reminds me of a funny story
my dad told me.

1069
00:49:34,085 --> 00:49:36,019
The only kind of meat

1070
00:49:36,087 --> 00:49:39,022
a priest could eat
on Friday was nun.

1071
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,523
Inside!

1072
00:49:40,591 --> 00:49:43,526
Harry, get a sample
of that car.

1073
00:49:43,594 --> 00:49:45,027
Yes, Sergeant.

1074
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:48,523
(Whimpering)

1075
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:50,032
Start the interrogation,
Murphy.

1076
00:49:50,101 --> 00:49:51,534
I'll be right back.

1077
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:55,528
(Sniffing)

1078
00:49:55,606 --> 00:49:57,039
(Barking)

1079
00:50:07,618 --> 00:50:10,553
Hey, what's going on
out there, man?

1080
00:50:13,124 --> 00:50:15,558
Huh? Excuse me.
What's going on out there?

1081
00:50:15,626 --> 00:50:18,060
Don't worry about it, buddy.
It's nothing.

1082
00:50:18,129 --> 00:50:21,565
Just some people doing
what they're not supposed to do.

1083
00:50:34,779 --> 00:50:38,078
Son of a bitch.
Look at the--

1084
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:42,084
Some asshole
pissed on my leg!

1085
00:50:42,153 --> 00:50:44,587
Listen, our agent
just phoned from Mexico.

1086
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:48,091
It's not a bunch of nuns
in a station wagon.

1087
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:49,592
It's two hippies
in a green van.

1088
00:50:52,663 --> 00:50:54,858
Must be
some heavy shit.

1089
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:56,365
Let's go!
Come on!

1090
00:50:58,502 --> 00:50:59,935
Get that
siren up!

1091
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,544
Where would these
two creeps hang out?

1092
00:51:11,615 --> 00:51:13,549
Where do hippies
hang out today?

1093
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:16,552
Sunset Strip--
That's where they hang out.

1094
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,554
Yeah, we could
try there.

1095
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:20,055
If they're not there,

1096
00:51:20,124 --> 00:51:23,150
we could go up
to San Francisco.

1097
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:24,660
Imagine the field day

1098
00:51:24,729 --> 00:51:26,560
those two creeps
are gonna have

1099
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,564
when they find out
that van is made of grass.

1100
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:29,564
(Siren)

1101
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:30,759
Huh?

1102
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:32,393
(Stedenko)
I don't believe it. I really don't.

1103
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:33,903
You guys
are supreme idiots.

1104
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:36,405
How could you let
a big green van

1105
00:51:36,474 --> 00:51:38,066
slip right through
your fingers?

1106
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:39,575
Spend one week
at the border,

1107
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:41,076
and what do we
end up with?

1108
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:42,578
Busting
a bevy of nuns,

1109
00:51:42,646 --> 00:51:44,409
a guy
pisses on my leg,

1110
00:51:44,482 --> 00:51:46,848
and I lose my special canine
sentry dog--

1111
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:48,578
Best cop
I ever knew.

1112
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:50,347
See anything?

1113
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:51,353
Negative.

1114
00:51:51,422 --> 00:51:53,117
Well, use mine.
They're on the floor.

1115
00:51:57,161 --> 00:51:59,095
Oh, yeah.
These are great, Sergeant.

1116
00:51:59,163 --> 00:52:00,528
You can see everything.

1117
00:52:00,598 --> 00:52:02,031
What do you see?

1118
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,533
You know, there's a great
donut shop up there.

1119
00:52:04,602 --> 00:52:06,035
Do we have time--

1120
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:08,003
No! No!
I mean on the road!

1121
00:52:08,072 --> 00:52:11,064
Wait a minute.
There's the van.

1122
00:52:11,142 --> 00:52:12,370
There's the van!

1123
00:52:12,443 --> 00:52:13,705
Yeah, that's it.

1124
00:52:13,778 --> 00:52:15,040
(Man Stoner)
Hey, listen, man.

1125
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:16,545
When we get back to town,

1126
00:52:16,614 --> 00:52:18,707
let's get serious
about this group, okay?

1127
00:52:18,783 --> 00:52:20,216
Yeah, really, man.

1128
00:52:20,284 --> 00:52:22,377
Like, if we practice
all the time,

1129
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:24,045
we could have
a heavy band.

1130
00:52:24,121 --> 00:52:26,555
Let's not let anything
interfere with our music.

1131
00:52:26,624 --> 00:52:27,556
Yeah, that's right.

1132
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:28,922
Hey, you see
what I see, man?

1133
00:52:28,993 --> 00:52:30,620
Yeah...

1134
00:52:30,694 --> 00:52:32,127
Hey, they're
hitchhiking, man.

1135
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:33,128
(Honking)

1136
00:52:33,197 --> 00:52:34,129
(Siren)

1137
00:52:37,101 --> 00:52:38,932
(Stedenko)
There they go, Harry.

1138
00:52:39,003 --> 00:52:40,368
Keep your eye
on them.

1139
00:52:40,438 --> 00:52:43,874
(Man Stoner) Wonder
what they're doing way out here.

1140
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:45,374
I don't know,

1141
00:52:45,443 --> 00:52:48,378
but here comes
the Mounties to the rescue.

1142
00:52:48,446 --> 00:52:49,378
Holy...

1143
00:52:49,447 --> 00:52:50,471
Wow.

1144
00:52:50,548 --> 00:52:52,914
Turn around, Harry.
They're over there.

1145
00:52:52,983 --> 00:52:55,303
Keep your eye
on them, Harry!

1146
00:52:57,606 --> 00:53:00,473
Hey, man, you know
how to drive, man?

1147
00:53:00,542 --> 00:53:01,804
Sort of. Why?

1148
00:53:01,877 --> 00:53:03,174
Take over, man.

1149
00:53:03,245 --> 00:53:04,940
Hey, what are you
doing, man?

1150
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:05,945
Hi, ladies.

1151
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:06,946
Hi.

1152
00:53:07,015 --> 00:53:08,448
Hey, entrez vous,
alla yous.

1153
00:53:08,516 --> 00:53:09,448
Thanks.

1154
00:53:09,517 --> 00:53:11,951
There you go.
Watch your step.

1155
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,453
I'll watch
everything else.

1156
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:14,488
(Mumbling)

1157
00:53:14,556 --> 00:53:15,989
Hey,
what's happening?

1158
00:53:16,057 --> 00:53:18,491
How far are you
going, man?

1159
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,187
All the way.

1160
00:53:20,262 --> 00:53:21,490
All right.

1161
00:53:21,563 --> 00:53:23,497
We're going there
ourselves.

1162
00:53:23,565 --> 00:53:24,964
Come on over.

1163
00:53:25,033 --> 00:53:26,500
(Stedenko)
There they go, Harry!

1164
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:28,001
I see them.

1165
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:29,502
Shoot
their tires out!

1166
00:53:29,571 --> 00:53:31,004
Got it.

1167
00:53:31,072 --> 00:53:33,097
No, not yours.
Use my gun.

1168
00:53:33,174 --> 00:53:34,505
(Gunshot)

1169
00:53:44,252 --> 00:53:45,719
Oh, my God!

1170
00:53:45,787 --> 00:53:47,721
Damn it!
You stupid idiot!

1171
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:49,222
Look, you idiot!

1172
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:51,725
You are a stupid,
stupid man!

1173
00:53:51,793 --> 00:53:53,226
Get over here, Harry!

1174
00:53:53,295 --> 00:53:55,729
Get over here.
Give me that gun.

1175
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,964
When I think of
the time and money

1176
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:02,503
I've wasted
on your training,

1177
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,470
and you still turn out to be
a blithering idiot!

1178
00:54:04,539 --> 00:54:05,767
You're
an utter failure!

1179
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,205
You make me sick!

1180
00:54:07,275 --> 00:54:09,140
Have you anything
to say for yourself?

1181
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,404
In the car!

1182
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:12,912
God, I will never,
ever, never

1183
00:54:12,981 --> 00:54:16,610
take a baldheaded man
in the department again.

1184
00:54:37,672 --> 00:54:40,106
Wow.
This is a neat van.

1185
00:54:40,175 --> 00:54:43,110
Yeah. Want to see
the rest of it?

1186
00:54:43,178 --> 00:54:44,509
Sure.

1187
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,843
Okay, we'll go
right back there.

1188
00:54:46,915 --> 00:54:49,509
The rest of it
is right back there.

1189
00:54:49,584 --> 00:54:51,347
Go ahead.
Watch your step.

1190
00:54:51,419 --> 00:54:52,750
Yeah. There you go.

1191
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:54,948
Yeah,
right back there.

1192
00:54:55,023 --> 00:54:57,457
Hey, have fun at
Magic Mountains.

1193
00:54:57,525 --> 00:55:01,222
Oh, yeah. I see London.
I see France.

1194
00:55:01,296 --> 00:55:04,231
If I ain't out
in three weeks, man,

1195
00:55:04,299 --> 00:55:05,732
send a search party.

1196
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,826
Hey, hold on.
Don't start without me.

1197
00:55:20,482 --> 00:55:22,416
Want to do a lude?

1198
00:55:22,484 --> 00:55:23,917
(Loudly)
You got ludes?

1199
00:55:23,985 --> 00:55:25,816
No, I don't have
any ludes!

1200
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:27,320
I wish I had ludes.

1201
00:55:27,389 --> 00:55:29,482
I thought you said
you had some.

1202
00:55:29,557 --> 00:55:31,320
(Loudly)
No, I don't have some.

1203
00:55:31,393 --> 00:55:33,861
(Whispering)
I don't have enough.

1204
00:55:33,928 --> 00:55:35,293
Oh, right.
All right.

1205
00:55:35,363 --> 00:55:38,526
I wish I had some,
you know.

1206
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,000
I love a manly chest.

1207
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:43,503
Yeah. So do I...

1208
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:46,335
I mean, on a girl.

1209
00:55:46,408 --> 00:55:47,841
Attention,
all units.

1210
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:48,841
Attention,
all units.

1211
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,343
This is Sergeant
Stedenko.

1212
00:55:50,412 --> 00:55:51,845
Attention,
all units.

1213
00:55:51,913 --> 00:55:53,346
This is Sergeant
Stedenko.

1214
00:55:53,415 --> 00:55:56,851
We are changing
from a code 3 direct pursuit

1215
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:58,351
to a code 34 7--
completely lost

1216
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,115
due to
incompetence.

1217
00:56:07,128 --> 00:56:09,460
These chicks are going
to the Roxy, man.

1218
00:56:09,531 --> 00:56:11,965
They're having a battle
of the bands there, man.

1219
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:13,967
Debbie was telling me
all about it.

1220
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:16,094
The winner
gets a record contract.

1221
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:17,604
A battle
of the bands?

1222
00:56:17,672 --> 00:56:19,970
It's like the best thing
in the world.

1223
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,475
Everyone's going to be there
and everything.

1224
00:56:22,544 --> 00:56:24,478
The winner gets
a record contract, man.

1225
00:56:24,546 --> 00:56:26,980
That's not
going to mean dick

1226
00:56:27,048 --> 00:56:28,481
unless they promote you,
you know.

1227
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:31,314
We could enter our band.
We could win.

1228
00:56:31,386 --> 00:56:33,320
It's $ 1 00, too.

1229
00:56:33,388 --> 00:56:36,084
We couldn't enter.
We don't even know any tunes yet.

1230
00:56:36,157 --> 00:56:38,318
What do you mean?
We had two rehearsals.

1231
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:39,985
Besides,
it's just punk rock.

1232
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:41,995
You don't have to
know how to play.

1233
00:56:42,063 --> 00:56:44,463
You just got to be a punk.
We could do that.

1234
00:56:46,568 --> 00:56:49,002
We got to get loaded
first, though.

1235
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,503
Yeah, we should
get loaded.

1236
00:56:50,572 --> 00:56:52,005
We need
some smoke, man.

1237
00:56:52,073 --> 00:56:53,506
Jeez, we need to
score a lid.

1238
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:55,008
Stop,
and I'll call Gloria.

1239
00:56:55,076 --> 00:56:56,043
Who's Gloria?

1240
00:56:57,178 --> 00:56:59,772
Hi. You're looking good.

1241
00:56:59,848 --> 00:57:02,715
You want to go,
like, powder our noses?

1242
00:57:02,784 --> 00:57:05,719
Anyway, I want to
talk some business, okay?

1243
00:57:05,787 --> 00:57:07,721
Yeah.
I got the powder.

1244
00:57:07,789 --> 00:57:10,519
She's got the best stuff,
I'm telling you.

1245
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:14,952
Boy, she can
bust me anytime.

1246
00:57:15,029 --> 00:57:17,190
You should see
her summer whites.

1247
00:57:18,366 --> 00:57:19,458
In here.

1248
00:57:26,508 --> 00:57:28,100
Wow. That's heavy.

1249
00:57:28,176 --> 00:57:31,111
Yeah, man, but I bet
a lot of cops

1250
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:33,113
smoke dope now,
you know.

1251
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:35,615
No, I mean,
look at that, man.

1252
00:57:35,683 --> 00:57:37,776
Looks like a radio station.

1253
00:57:37,852 --> 00:57:40,116
The request lines
are now open!

1254
00:57:40,188 --> 00:57:42,622
KGFJ soul
radio-o-o-o-o-o!

1255
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,021
Do it now, man.

1256
00:57:44,092 --> 00:57:45,116
Request lines are now--

1257
00:57:45,193 --> 00:57:46,626
(Echoing)

1258
00:57:46,694 --> 00:57:48,628
It's open, man.

1259
00:57:48,696 --> 00:57:49,856
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1260
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,093
All right, Officer Clyde,
contact headquarters

1261
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:56,194
and give them
our present location.

1262
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:59,434
And then I'm going
to take off your dress...

1263
00:57:59,507 --> 00:58:00,940
(Panting)

1264
00:58:01,009 --> 00:58:03,944
and then I'm going
to take off your bra...

1265
00:58:04,012 --> 00:58:05,445
Ha ha ha!

1266
00:58:05,513 --> 00:58:08,949
and then I'm going
to take off your shoes.

1267
00:58:09,017 --> 00:58:10,450
Whew. Whew.

1268
00:58:10,518 --> 00:58:11,951
Hello, hello,
hello, hello, hello.

1269
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,544
Can you hear me?

1270
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:15,054
Hello, headquarters?
Hello, headquarters?

1271
00:58:15,123 --> 00:58:16,556
Come in, headquarters.

1272
00:58:16,624 --> 00:58:17,886
This is Officer Clyde.

1273
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:20,894
Use the code name.
The code name.

1274
00:58:20,962 --> 00:58:22,896
Headquarters.
Headquarters, come in, please.

1275
00:58:22,964 --> 00:58:24,329
This is code name
Hardhead.

1276
00:58:24,399 --> 00:58:26,833
Hat! Hard Hat.
Give me that.

1277
00:58:26,901 --> 00:58:28,334
Hello,
radio dispatch?

1278
00:58:28,403 --> 00:58:30,337
This is code name
Hard Hat.

1279
00:58:30,405 --> 00:58:31,963
Do you read me?
Over.

1280
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,837
Was that Lard Ass?

1281
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:35,432
Ha!

1282
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,842
Hard Hat.
Code name Hard Hat.

1283
00:58:37,912 --> 00:58:39,243
Do you read,
radio dispatch?

1284
00:58:39,314 --> 00:58:42,249
Hey, got something
for you, Lard Ass.

1285
00:58:42,317 --> 00:58:43,341
Hard Hat!

1286
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:45,352
Hard Hat!
Do you understand?

1287
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,285
Lard Ass! Lard Ass!

1288
00:58:47,355 --> 00:58:48,379
Hard Hat!

1289
00:58:48,456 --> 00:58:50,822
Radio dispatch,
do you know who this is?

1290
00:58:50,892 --> 00:58:52,860
No. Who is ''this is''?

1291
00:58:52,927 --> 00:58:54,360
This is
Sergeant Stedenko.

1292
00:58:54,429 --> 00:58:56,954
Oh, yeah?
You know who this is?

1293
00:58:57,031 --> 00:58:58,555
No.

1294
00:58:58,633 --> 00:59:00,533
Bye-bye, Lard Ass.

1295
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:07,368
(Tires Screeching)

1296
00:59:07,442 --> 00:59:09,376
(Horn Honking)

1297
00:59:20,955 --> 00:59:22,388
(Stedenko)
Attention, headquarters.

1298
00:59:22,457 --> 00:59:25,324
Attention, headquarters.
This is code name Lard--

1299
00:59:25,393 --> 00:59:27,827
This is code name
Hard Hat.

1300
00:59:27,895 --> 00:59:31,956
Any sighting of them
in the last half-hour?

1301
00:59:33,901 --> 00:59:36,335
They burnt the stash
they had.

1302
00:59:36,404 --> 00:59:37,837
Oh, no.

1303
00:59:37,905 --> 00:59:39,839
Yeah. Can you
believe it?

1304
00:59:39,907 --> 00:59:41,841
They burned the whole thing
yesterday.

1305
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:43,001
Oh, no.

1306
00:59:43,077 --> 00:59:45,341
They're expecting
a new one from Tijuana...

1307
00:59:45,413 --> 00:59:46,846
I was
in Tijuana once.

1308
00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:49,348
...worth millions
and millions of dollars.

1309
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:50,349
Ohh.

1310
00:59:50,418 --> 00:59:52,852
The cops are out
looking for it now.

1311
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,854
Jesus, I hope
they find it.

1312
00:59:54,922 --> 00:59:57,857
If they find it,
set aside some lids for me.

1313
00:59:57,925 --> 01:00:00,826
Well, you can believe
we'll have a party.

1314
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:06,992
Why don't we just,
like, split, okay?

1315
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:08,365
Glo, see you.

1316
01:00:08,436 --> 01:00:11,872
You want me to give your number
to that guy, let me know.

1317
01:00:11,939 --> 01:00:13,031
What's that?

1318
01:00:13,107 --> 01:00:15,871
I can't believe
they burned all this.

1319
01:00:15,943 --> 01:00:19,379
Hey, I got to
go to the bathroom.

1320
01:00:19,447 --> 01:00:21,881
I'll meet you guys
outside, okay?

1321
01:00:26,521 --> 01:00:27,818
(Whistling)

1322
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:29,322
Hey, homes.

1323
01:00:36,397 --> 01:00:38,331
Come on, man.

1324
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:40,333
(Whistling)

1325
01:00:41,903 --> 01:00:46,340
Sometimes when you got to go
really bad, you can't, you know?

1326
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:49,342
Come on, man.

1327
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:51,344
You wanted to go
out there.

1328
01:00:51,412 --> 01:00:54,347
I'll put you
back in the closet.

1329
01:00:56,918 --> 01:00:59,352
I think he's got
stage fright, man.

1330
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,853
Come on, man.

1331
01:01:03,925 --> 01:01:05,358
Ohh.

1332
01:01:07,428 --> 01:01:09,862
Ahh, yeah.
That's the one.

1333
01:01:09,931 --> 01:01:11,364
Oh, hey, man.

1334
01:01:11,432 --> 01:01:13,366
Thanks
an awful lot, man.

1335
01:01:13,434 --> 01:01:14,867
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1336
01:01:14,936 --> 01:01:17,370
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1337
01:01:17,438 --> 01:01:18,871
Come on! Look at--Hey!

1338
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,872
I'm sorry.

1339
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:21,636
Hey, come ba--

1340
01:01:21,709 --> 01:01:22,869
Jesus!

1341
01:01:22,944 --> 01:01:26,802
(Telephone Ringing)

1342
01:01:26,936 --> 01:01:31,032
(Pedro) Hey, everybody be quiet.
I'm calling home.

1343
01:01:31,107 --> 01:01:32,665
Hello. Who's this?

1344
01:01:32,742 --> 01:01:34,175
James! Man, hey, listen.

1345
01:01:34,243 --> 01:01:37,303
We got a gig
at the Roxy, man.

1346
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,904
So get the guys, okay?

1347
01:01:38,981 --> 01:01:41,313
All right, man.
Be sure to be there.

1348
01:01:41,384 --> 01:01:42,817
See you later.

1349
01:01:42,885 --> 01:01:44,819
All right.
It's together, man.

1350
01:01:44,887 --> 01:01:46,320
We're going to be there.

1351
01:01:46,389 --> 01:01:49,324
We're going to take
this battle of the bands.

1352
01:01:49,392 --> 01:01:50,825
(Engine Starts)

1353
01:02:05,808 --> 01:02:07,332
Does this show?

1354
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,344
Uh, yeah, they sure do.

1355
01:02:09,412 --> 01:02:11,346
No. I mean this,
this spot.

1356
01:02:11,414 --> 01:02:12,847
Let's see.

1357
01:02:12,915 --> 01:02:14,348
Yeah, a little bit.

1358
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:16,851
I'll take it out
for you.

1359
01:02:16,919 --> 01:02:17,851
Will you?

1360
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,854
Sure.Just take it off.

1361
01:02:29,865 --> 01:02:31,799
(Siren)

1362
01:02:36,372 --> 01:02:38,306
(Jade)
I can stay here.

1363
01:02:38,374 --> 01:02:40,808
I'll just
do it here, okay?

1364
01:02:40,876 --> 01:02:44,312
Oh, hey, hey, no, man.
Get in the back.

1365
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,814
Get in the back.
Get in the back.

1366
01:02:46,882 --> 01:02:47,814
Okay.

1367
01:02:47,883 --> 01:02:49,373
Get in the back.

1368
01:02:49,452 --> 01:02:51,181
Whoa!

1369
01:02:51,253 --> 01:02:52,311
Okay.Jesus.

1370
01:02:52,388 --> 01:02:54,219
Hey, Pedro?

1371
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:55,314
Pedro?

1372
01:02:55,391 --> 01:02:56,824
What's the matter?

1373
01:02:56,892 --> 01:02:58,257
Pedro!

1374
01:02:58,327 --> 01:03:00,158
You still like me,
don't you?

1375
01:03:00,229 --> 01:03:01,662
Pedro, come here, man.

1376
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,823
He is so sweet,
you know?

1377
01:03:03,899 --> 01:03:05,127
Pedro, get out here.

1378
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:08,329
Man, where'd you learn
how to drive?

1379
01:03:08,404 --> 01:03:10,338
We got stopped
by the cops.

1380
01:03:10,406 --> 01:03:11,839
I don't have a license.

1381
01:03:11,907 --> 01:03:13,841
Why didn't
you tell me that?

1382
01:03:13,909 --> 01:03:15,900
What are we going to do?

1383
01:03:15,978 --> 01:03:17,343
Oh, shit.

1384
01:03:17,413 --> 01:03:18,846
Change places
with me.

1385
01:03:18,914 --> 01:03:20,541
I don't think
he's seen us.

1386
01:03:20,616 --> 01:03:22,015
No, no. Sit down.

1387
01:03:22,084 --> 01:03:24,018
I've got my leg caught.

1388
01:03:24,086 --> 01:03:25,781
Man, like,
get over, man.

1389
01:03:43,372 --> 01:03:45,272
What do you guys want?

1390
01:03:45,341 --> 01:03:46,808
(Chuckling)

1391
01:03:46,876 --> 01:03:48,309
Nothing.

1392
01:03:51,881 --> 01:03:57,376
You mind if I have
a bite of your hot dog?

1393
01:03:57,453 --> 01:03:58,818
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, man.

1394
01:03:58,888 --> 01:04:01,584
You can have
the whole thing.

1395
01:04:01,657 --> 01:04:02,817
Thanks.

1396
01:04:02,892 --> 01:04:04,689
Want some Fritos?

1397
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:08,321
No. This is fine.

1398
01:04:08,397 --> 01:04:09,887
Thank you.

1399
01:04:12,902 --> 01:04:15,837
Hey, you guys have
a nice day.

1400
01:04:15,905 --> 01:04:17,338
Thank you.

1401
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:22,002
Hey, man.

1402
01:04:22,077 --> 01:04:23,169
What?

1403
01:04:23,245 --> 01:04:24,269
You're squashing
my nuts.

1404
01:04:24,346 --> 01:04:25,608
Oh.

1405
01:04:30,853 --> 01:04:32,286
Hey, did that
really happen?

1406
01:04:32,354 --> 01:04:34,686
What was that dude's
trip, man?

1407
01:04:34,757 --> 01:04:37,282
I thought we were
going to get busted.

1408
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:39,293
Shh. It might be
a trick.

1409
01:04:39,361 --> 01:04:41,386
Okay, sit there
and be cool.

1410
01:04:41,463 --> 01:04:42,794
Oh, shit.

1411
01:04:42,865 --> 01:04:44,298
Look at him, man.

1412
01:04:44,366 --> 01:04:46,857
I wonder what
he's been smoking.

1413
01:04:46,936 --> 01:04:50,201
Whatever it is,
I wish we had some, man.

1414
01:04:50,339 --> 01:04:51,306
No kidding.

1415
01:04:51,373 --> 01:04:53,307
We got to score some.

1416
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:54,808
Yeah, but where, man?

1417
01:04:54,877 --> 01:04:57,812
There's got to be
somebody in this town

1418
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,711
that's got
a lot of smoke.

1419
01:04:59,782 --> 01:05:01,306
(Siren)

1420
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:09,824
Ha ha ha!

1421
01:05:11,894 --> 01:05:15,227
I want all you mothers
off the street

1422
01:05:15,297 --> 01:05:19,028
All you lambs
off this bloody beat

1423
01:05:19,101 --> 01:05:21,831
Well, my freedom's
just begun

1424
01:05:21,904 --> 01:05:25,032
So if you can't rock,
you'd better run

1425
01:05:25,107 --> 01:05:28,372
A new age is on the rise

1426
01:05:28,444 --> 01:05:31,675
With safety pins
stuck in their eyes

1427
01:05:31,747 --> 01:05:34,341
The time has come,
let's get it down

1428
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:36,748
Let's find
the weirdest band in town

1429
01:05:36,819 --> 01:05:38,446
At the rock fight

1430
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,887
Tonight there's gonna be
a rock fight

1431
01:05:41,957 --> 01:05:45,324
A highfalutin,
tootin' rock fight

1432
01:05:45,394 --> 01:05:49,194
There might even be
a fistfight

1433
01:05:49,264 --> 01:05:51,994
At the rock fight

1434
01:05:52,067 --> 01:05:56,026
We'll be
rock-'n'-rollin' all night

1435
01:05:56,105 --> 01:05:59,905
Long-haired music
is what it's all about

1436
01:05:59,975 --> 01:06:03,206
Rock-'n'-roll
turned inside out

1437
01:06:03,278 --> 01:06:06,270
Who's that lady
that's lying on the floor?

1438
01:06:06,348 --> 01:06:09,511
Need some speed
to dance some more

1439
01:06:09,585 --> 01:06:12,679
Guitars wailin' out
a tune

1440
01:06:12,755 --> 01:06:16,418
Groovin',
howling at the moon

1441
01:06:16,492 --> 01:06:19,290
Oh, baby,
those purple eyes

1442
01:06:19,361 --> 01:06:22,387
Dimpled cheeks
and satin thighs

1443
01:06:22,464 --> 01:06:25,729
Don't take the kiddies
to the zoo

1444
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:28,929
Wait awhile,
I'm going to take you

1445
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:30,596
To the rock fight

1446
01:06:30,673 --> 01:06:34,234
Tonight there's gonna be
a rock fight

1447
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:37,107
A highfalutin,
tootin' rock fight

1448
01:06:37,179 --> 01:06:41,843
There might even be
a fistfight

1449
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:44,147
At the rock fight

1450
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:48,519
They'll be
rock-'n'-rollin' all night

1451
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:50,285
She was, like, nuts.

1452
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:53,795
You could always tell
if she was balling her old man.

1453
01:06:53,862 --> 01:06:55,796
Everyone would be
dozing off,

1454
01:06:55,864 --> 01:06:58,298
and all of a sudden
she'd start up.

1455
01:06:58,367 --> 01:07:00,267
First it would start like--

1456
01:07:00,335 --> 01:07:03,566
Ohh. Ohh. Ohh. Ohh.

1457
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:05,630
But then she'd
really get going,

1458
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:06,868
and she'd be more like--

1459
01:07:06,942 --> 01:07:09,467
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1460
01:07:09,545 --> 01:07:13,072
And she'd start going
like a motorboat, you know?

1461
01:07:13,148 --> 01:07:15,844
Fu-u-uck me, Alex!

1462
01:07:15,918 --> 01:07:17,818
Her boyfriend's name
was Alex.

1463
01:07:17,886 --> 01:07:21,083
Fu-u-uck me-e-e-e!

1464
01:07:21,156 --> 01:07:24,922
Fu-u-uck me-e-e-e!

1465
01:07:24,993 --> 01:07:26,756
Fuck me, Alex!

1466
01:07:26,829 --> 01:07:28,353
Fuck me, Alex!

1467
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:31,092
Fuck me, Alex!
Fuck me, Alex!

1468
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:33,100
Oh, I got a cramp!

1469
01:07:33,168 --> 01:07:34,760
Oh! Got a cramp!

1470
01:07:34,837 --> 01:07:36,099
Yeah! Yeah!

1471
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:38,605
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Oh, God!

1472
01:07:38,674 --> 01:07:41,268
Yeah. That's just like it.
You're doing good.

1473
01:07:41,343 --> 01:07:42,833
Ow! Ow!

1474
01:07:42,911 --> 01:07:44,879
Oh, yeah! Oh!

1475
01:07:44,947 --> 01:07:46,642
Ow! Ow!

1476
01:07:46,715 --> 01:07:49,309
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

1477
01:07:49,384 --> 01:07:50,851
Ow! Ow!

1478
01:07:50,919 --> 01:07:53,387
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1479
01:07:53,455 --> 01:07:54,854
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

1480
01:07:54,923 --> 01:07:55,890
There.

1481
01:07:55,958 --> 01:07:58,358
Oh, yeah!
That's just like it.

1482
01:07:58,427 --> 01:08:00,861
Then she'd have,
like, two tears.

1483
01:08:00,929 --> 01:08:03,796
Oh, it's better.
It's out. It's out.

1484
01:08:03,866 --> 01:08:05,356
Ahh, it's better.

1485
01:08:05,434 --> 01:08:07,766
Oh, that feels
better. Oh, God.

1486
01:08:07,836 --> 01:08:10,361
Shit.
I need some air.

1487
01:08:10,439 --> 01:08:12,373
(Cheering)

1488
01:08:18,413 --> 01:08:19,880
Right on, man.

1489
01:08:19,948 --> 01:08:22,382
I didn't know
your name was Alex, man.

1490
01:08:22,451 --> 01:08:23,884
Oh, I got a cramp.

1491
01:08:23,952 --> 01:08:26,819
Shit, I'd have
a cramp there, too.

1492
01:08:26,889 --> 01:08:28,117
What's going on
out here?

1493
01:08:31,059 --> 01:08:34,324
Hey! Hey! You don't even know
where you're going.

1494
01:08:34,396 --> 01:08:35,988
Wait for me.

1495
01:08:36,064 --> 01:08:38,328
Make way
for the new king.

1496
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,334
Goddamn.
You're a star, man.

1497
01:08:40,402 --> 01:08:42,165
Go ahead.
After you, King Salami.

1498
01:08:42,237 --> 01:08:44,330
They're going to be sorry.

1499
01:08:44,406 --> 01:08:47,967
Like, I know where
the best dressing room is.

1500
01:08:48,043 --> 01:08:50,068
Ooh, yeah, yeah!

1501
01:08:50,145 --> 01:08:52,773
Ba-ba-ba-ba,
ooh, yeah, yeah

1502
01:08:52,848 --> 01:08:56,181
Well, I'm living so fast

1503
01:08:57,519 --> 01:09:01,066
So you better
feel it, baby

1504
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,101
I got no place to go

1505
01:09:04,169 --> 01:09:07,696
I mean, it's so socko,
so socko

1506
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:10,037
So very socko

1507
01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:11,940
So socko

1508
01:09:12,011 --> 01:09:14,036
So very socko

1509
01:09:14,113 --> 01:09:16,104
So socko

1510
01:09:16,181 --> 01:09:18,172
So very socko

1511
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:21,014
Baby, I'm just so socko

1512
01:09:21,086 --> 01:09:22,314
So socko...

1513
01:09:36,568 --> 01:09:38,365
Acting like a bum...

1514
01:09:38,437 --> 01:09:42,271
The next day, he comes
up to me, and he says,

1515
01:09:42,341 --> 01:09:45,276
''Thanks for being there.
like, you saved my life.''

1516
01:09:45,344 --> 01:09:46,675
Just like Cher.

1517
01:09:46,745 --> 01:09:49,111
(Humming)

1518
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:53,409
Hey, man,
what are you doing?

1519
01:09:53,485 --> 01:09:55,282
Come on, man.
Get it together.

1520
01:09:55,354 --> 01:09:57,015
We're on
in two more bands.

1521
01:09:57,089 --> 01:10:00,422
You ought to hear what
these other groups are into.

1522
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:02,790
These kids
are into something heavy.

1523
01:10:02,861 --> 01:10:04,294
I've been writing
this new song.

1524
01:10:04,363 --> 01:10:08,299
Mama talkin' to me,
tryin' to tell me how to live

1525
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:09,425
(Humming)

1526
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:10,866
'Cause I don't
listen to her

1527
01:10:10,936 --> 01:10:14,303
'Cause my head
is like a sieve

1528
01:10:14,373 --> 01:10:16,898
Hey, man, are you awake?

1529
01:10:16,975 --> 01:10:20,103
I don't feel
so good, man.

1530
01:10:20,179 --> 01:10:22,807
Did you try
to give him some pills?

1531
01:10:22,881 --> 01:10:25,281
Yeah, I tried,
but I gave him ups.

1532
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,250
Shit, man. Come on.

1533
01:10:27,319 --> 01:10:29,583
Hey, how many
fingers you see?

1534
01:10:29,655 --> 01:10:30,713
Uh...

1535
01:10:30,789 --> 01:10:33,724
I think I fucked up.

1536
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:37,489
Oh, shit. Anybody got
any coffee or anything?

1537
01:10:37,563 --> 01:10:38,928
I got a popper.

1538
01:10:38,997 --> 01:10:43,297
We could either party later
or try to start his heart.

1539
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:45,768
Get on the level.
Get up.

1540
01:10:45,838 --> 01:10:47,271
Huh?

1541
01:10:47,339 --> 01:10:49,773
Okay, come on. Up.

1542
01:11:01,854 --> 01:11:04,288
Oh, shit.
Watch where you're going.

1543
01:11:04,356 --> 01:11:05,789
You're not dying.

1544
01:11:05,858 --> 01:11:07,792
You know
what I'm saying?

1545
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,795
While I got you here,
I was thinking

1546
01:11:10,863 --> 01:11:13,798
maybe we should have
some paper between us,

1547
01:11:13,866 --> 01:11:15,299
because in this business

1548
01:11:15,367 --> 01:11:17,301
a handshake
doesn't mean dick.

1549
01:11:23,876 --> 01:11:26,242
Everybody into the van.
Hurry! Hurry!

1550
01:11:26,311 --> 01:11:28,245
Come on. Come on.

1551
01:11:28,313 --> 01:11:30,747
All right.
Harry, come on.

1552
01:11:30,816 --> 01:11:32,750
Look at all these freaks.

1553
01:11:32,818 --> 01:11:35,252
(Horn Honking)

1554
01:11:36,822 --> 01:11:38,255
Zipping down.

1555
01:11:42,661 --> 01:11:44,595
Aha! There's one of them.

1556
01:11:44,663 --> 01:11:46,255
(Tambourines Playing)

1557
01:11:50,903 --> 01:11:53,838
You know, I would
totally die for you.

1558
01:11:53,906 --> 01:11:56,272
You know what I mean?

1559
01:11:56,341 --> 01:11:57,774
(Unintelligible)

1560
01:12:02,748 --> 01:12:05,410
Well, you dance
and rock all wrong

1561
01:12:05,484 --> 01:12:07,816
Summer of love
is 1 0 years gone

1562
01:12:07,886 --> 01:12:09,649
You know in 1 0 years, baby,
I'll be gone

1563
01:12:09,721 --> 01:12:12,121
But I'm now

1564
01:12:12,191 --> 01:12:14,455
Flowers in your hair

1565
01:12:14,526 --> 01:12:16,551
'Cause there's nothing
under there

1566
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:18,687
Peace and love
for free

1567
01:12:18,764 --> 01:12:21,198
They don't mean
a thing to me

1568
01:12:21,266 --> 01:12:23,029
Join our band

1569
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:25,126
Baby, we're through

1570
01:12:37,816 --> 01:12:40,751
I want to be like me.

1571
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:44,755
Like, I have my own special
way of looking and dressing.

1572
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:46,256
That's me.

1573
01:12:46,325 --> 01:12:48,259
Ladies and gentlemen,

1574
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:49,658
Taurus.

1575
01:12:54,766 --> 01:12:55,755
Piss off!

1576
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:02,936
Mother's nice,
and Daddy's nice

1577
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:05,476
Say it again,
and you say it twice

1578
01:13:05,544 --> 01:13:08,411
I'd be telling you
a pack of lies

1579
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,108
And you'd be burying me
through moonlit eyes

1580
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:13,811
But you are rocking out
in bi-school

1581
01:13:13,886 --> 01:13:16,719
I want to go
to your school

1582
01:13:16,788 --> 01:13:19,757
I don't want to go
to my school

1583
01:13:19,825 --> 01:13:22,316
'Cause I want to go
to bi-school

(Chanting)

01:13:24,296 --> 01:13:27,231
Everybody in, boys.
All the way down.

1586
01:13:27,299 --> 01:13:28,732
That's right, boys.

1587
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,234
We want to
talk to you boys

1588
01:13:31,303 --> 01:13:32,736
about joining
your order.

1589
01:13:32,804 --> 01:13:34,567
What size sheet
do you wear?

1590

Hey! Hold on.

1598
01:13:51,323 --> 01:13:53,257
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1599
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:55,759
Can I see
some tickets, guys?

1600
01:13:55,827 --> 01:13:57,260
We don't need tickets.

1601
01:13:57,329 --> 01:13:59,263
We are brothers
of the faith.

1602

We don't need tickets
to walk with love.

1603
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:03,266
We got to
see tickets.

1604
01:14:03,335 --> 01:14:06,031
All right. We are not
brothers of the faith.

1605
01:14:06,104 --> 01:14:07,435
We are police officers.

1606
01:14:07,506 --> 01:14:09,098
Sorry, man.
You got to have tickets.

1607
01:14:09,174 --> 01:14:10,300
Let's have some tickets.

1608
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:13,776
No. That is a gun.
That is not a ticket.

1609
01:14:13,845 --> 01:14:15,608
Did you bring the I.D.?

1610
01:14:15,681 --> 01:14:16,739
No. Uh-uh.

get in here right now.

This is very important.

Hey, Sarge.
The van.

1614

Huh? The van!

1615
01:14:37,469 --> 01:14:41,030
Jeez, no wonder
Anita Bryant's pissed off.

Hey! Hey! Wait a minute.

Hey, you!

Hey, where are you taking
this tow truck?

1620
01:14:49,815 --> 01:14:52,249
Where are you going
with our van?

1621
01:14:52,317 --> 01:14:54,182
Take a walk.

1622
01:14:54,252 --> 01:14:57,244
What do you mean,
take a walk? Who are you?

1623
01:14:57,322 --> 01:14:58,584
Who owns this van?

1624
01:14:58,657 --> 01:14:59,851
Who are you, anyway?

1625
01:14:59,925 --> 01:15:01,256
Sergeant Stedenko.

1626
01:15:01,326 --> 01:15:02,759
Sergeant Stedenko.
What van?

1627
01:15:02,828 --> 01:15:05,262
What do you mean?
This van right here.

1628
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,264
(Driver)
Let's see some I.D.

1629
01:15:07,332 --> 01:15:08,765
Hold it right there.

1630
01:15:08,834 --> 01:15:11,268
Hold it right there.
Come back here.

1631
01:15:11,336 --> 01:15:13,270
Tell him
we didn't do nothing.

1632
01:15:13,338 --> 01:15:15,772
You didn't do
a damn thing.

1633
01:15:15,841 --> 01:15:17,775
Take it easy!
Take it easy!

1634
01:15:17,843 --> 01:15:20,277
Hey, you know
who he is?

1635
01:15:20,345 --> 01:15:21,778
Tell him, boss.

1636
01:15:21,847 --> 01:15:23,280
Benny, shut up.

1637
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:26,193
We got to call
the paddy wagon.

1638
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:28,158
Moving right along,

1639
01:15:28,229 --> 01:15:30,663
we don't know
who they are,

1640
01:15:30,731 --> 01:15:33,165
but here's Alice Bowie.

1641
01:15:50,251 --> 01:15:52,219
Don't worry about it.

1642
01:15:52,286 --> 01:15:54,880
If you die,
I'm the manager.

1643
01:15:54,955 --> 01:15:57,685
(Band Warming Up)

1644
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,194
(Cheering)

1645
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:11,670
You'd better be good.

1646
01:16:11,739 --> 01:16:15,197
Look, I'm not just in it
for the money.

1647
01:16:15,276 --> 01:16:17,710
I really like it.

1648
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:19,939
Hi. Hi.

1649
01:16:20,014 --> 01:16:22,209
Jade East.

1650
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:29,715
(Cheering)

1651
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:33,158
(Booing)

1652
01:16:47,741 --> 01:16:49,709
You're the worst!

1653
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:52,439
You guys really
had a scheme going, didn't you?

1654
01:16:52,513 --> 01:16:55,676
Thought you'd
get away with it?

1655
01:16:55,749 --> 01:16:58,149
Almost $9 billion.

1656
01:16:58,219 --> 01:17:01,188
Nine billion big ones
to help disease young minds

1657
01:17:01,255 --> 01:17:03,689
with marijuana, smack,
toot, crackers, you name it.

1658
01:17:03,757 --> 01:17:06,191
Sarge, the wagons
are on their way.

1659
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,694
Do you realize
that this is the bust?

1660
01:17:08,762 --> 01:17:11,731
This is the one that will
send me to the top.

1661
01:17:19,773 --> 01:17:22,105
Nail it down, man.

1662
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:27,838
(Stedenko)
Harry?

1663
01:17:27,915 --> 01:17:29,212
What?

1664
01:17:29,283 --> 01:17:31,717
Are you sure
you talked to headquarters?

1665
01:17:31,785 --> 01:17:33,719
They said
they're on their way.

1666
01:17:33,787 --> 01:17:35,220
How about a cheeseburger?

1667
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:36,722
No. A sundae.

1668
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:37,722
Hot fudge?

1669
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:40,225
With some whipped
cream on top, nuts.

1670
01:17:40,294 --> 01:17:41,226
What's this?

1671
01:17:41,295 --> 01:17:42,728
They're anchovies.

1672
01:17:42,796 --> 01:17:44,388
Ah, good. Thanks.

1673
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:47,562
I'll buy you
something to eat.

1674
01:17:47,635 --> 01:17:48,693
I'm stoned.

1675
01:17:48,769 --> 01:17:51,237
Yes, you are
very, very stoned.

1676
01:17:51,305 --> 01:17:53,205
Look at this.

1677
01:17:53,274 --> 01:17:54,400
(Giggling)

1678
01:17:54,475 --> 01:17:56,739
Sick! You've got food
all over your uniform.

1679
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:58,641
You've got no self-control
whatsoever.

1680
01:17:58,712 --> 01:18:00,737
Come on, man!
Let's do it!

1681
01:18:00,814 --> 01:18:01,940
(Booing)

1682
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:05,284
Do something!

1683
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:13,359
(Cheering)

1684
01:18:22,036 --> 01:18:24,197
All right!
You guys ready?

1685
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:25,898
(Cheering)

1686
01:18:25,973 --> 01:18:27,804
1 , 2, 3!

1687
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:29,206
Yeah!

1688
01:18:59,707 --> 01:19:02,232
My mama talkin' to me,
trying to tell me how to live

1689
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:06,209
But I won't
listen to her

1690
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,214
Because my head
is like a sieve

1691
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,284
My daddy,
he disowned me

1692
01:19:17,358 --> 01:19:18,985
Because I wear
my sister's clothes

1693
01:19:21,362 --> 01:19:24,388
He caught me in the bathroom
with a pair of panty hose

1694
01:19:31,739 --> 01:19:34,572
My basketball coach,
he done kicked me off the team

1695
01:19:36,844 --> 01:19:38,675
For wearing
high-heeled sneakers

1696
01:19:38,746 --> 01:19:41,180
And acting like a queen

1697
01:19:45,052 --> 01:19:47,213
Why don't you guys
admit it?

1698
01:19:47,287 --> 01:19:48,720
You got the munchies,
right?

1699
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:52,054
I've never seen anything
so disgusting in all my life.

1700
01:19:52,126 --> 01:19:53,593
You've let me down, boys.

1701
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,560
Harry, are you
understanding me?

1702
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:57,563
I am stoned!
I am stoned!

1703
01:19:57,631 --> 01:19:59,064
So go with it.

1704
01:19:59,133 --> 01:20:00,725
Put it
in your sundae.

1705
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:03,235
Go with it?
Get away from...

1706
01:20:03,303 --> 01:20:05,737
You almost botch up
the entire operation,

1707
01:20:05,806 --> 01:20:07,239
you lose my best dog,

1708
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:09,241
two guys piss on my leg,

1709
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:11,243
and you tell me
to go with it?

1710
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:12,744
I'll go with it!

1711
01:20:12,813 --> 01:20:16,772
Go with it.
G-go with it.

1712
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:21,753
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1713
01:20:21,822 --> 01:20:24,188
I'm so bloody rich!

1714
01:20:31,298 --> 01:20:34,426
I only know
three chords!

1715
01:20:40,274 --> 01:20:42,936
You fools!

1716
01:20:59,293 --> 01:21:01,727
(Yelling Unintelligibly)

1717
01:21:29,656 --> 01:21:32,090
(Audience Chanting)
More! More! More!

1718
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:35,287
More! More! More!

1719
01:21:35,362 --> 01:21:37,193
More! More! More!

1720
01:21:37,264 --> 01:21:39,198
More! More! More!

1721
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:42,030
More! More! More!

1722
01:21:42,102 --> 01:21:43,797
(Humming)

1723
01:21:43,871 --> 01:21:46,362
My mama talkin' to me,
trying to tell me how to live

1724
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,203
(Humming)

1725
01:21:48,275 --> 01:21:50,209
Wow. Did you hear
that crowd?

1726
01:21:50,277 --> 01:21:52,268
They gave us
a standing ovation.

1727
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:55,210
We're going to have
a bad band.

1728
01:21:55,282 --> 01:21:59,150
We had them eating right
out of their hands.

1729
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:01,710
We're going to be
big, man, really big.

1730
01:22:01,788 --> 01:22:04,222
We'll be bigger
than Ruben and the Jets.

1731
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:06,725
All we got to do
is keep practicing,

1732
01:22:06,793 --> 01:22:07,725
just keep it together.

1733
01:22:07,794 --> 01:22:09,227
I feel good, man.

1734
01:22:09,296 --> 01:22:11,730
I wish we had something
to celebrate.

1735
01:22:11,798 --> 01:22:13,891
You got a joint
or anything?

1736
01:22:13,967 --> 01:22:15,059
Hey.

1737
01:22:15,135 --> 01:22:17,330
What? We getting
pulled over?

1738
01:22:17,404 --> 01:22:20,237
I just remembered.
I got some hash.

1739
01:22:20,307 --> 01:22:22,241
Oh, yeah?
Fire it up, homes.

1740
01:22:22,309 --> 01:22:24,072
I need a pin or something.

1741
01:22:24,144 --> 01:22:27,170
There's a pin right here
on my tutu, man.

1742
01:22:27,247 --> 01:22:30,182
Be brave and remind me
to take those back.

1743
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:32,684
We'll get charged
for an extra day.

1744
01:22:32,753 --> 01:22:34,186
I forgot all about this.

1745
01:22:34,254 --> 01:22:36,688
We're going to have
a limo, man,

1746
01:22:36,757 --> 01:22:39,555
and food backstage,
man, everything.

1747
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:42,686
We need a manager.
That's the only thing.

1748
01:22:42,763 --> 01:22:44,788
My cousin.

1749
01:22:44,865 --> 01:22:46,696
He doesn't have a job.

1750
01:22:46,767 --> 01:22:48,701
We'll make him
the manager.

1751
01:22:48,769 --> 01:22:51,203
He's got a van.
It'll be heavy.

1752
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:53,296
We'll be the heaviest
dudes, man,

1753
01:22:53,373 --> 01:22:56,035
Get all-new instruments,
man, everything.

1754
01:22:56,109 --> 01:22:57,201
All right.

1755
01:22:57,277 --> 01:22:58,710
What's this?

1756
01:22:58,779 --> 01:23:00,212
I think it's hash.

1757
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,009
It doesn't
look like much.

1758
01:23:02,082 --> 01:23:03,674
Where'd it go?

1759
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,240
I don't know.

1760
01:23:05,319 --> 01:23:07,184
Oh! Aah!

1761
01:23:07,254 --> 01:23:08,653
Hey, watch the road, man.

1762
01:23:08,722 --> 01:23:09,916
Aah! Aah!

1763
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:11,184
Oh, shit!

1764
01:23:11,258 --> 01:23:12,623
Hey! Hey!
Watch the road!

1765
01:23:12,693 --> 01:23:13,955
Aah! Ow!

1766
01:23:14,027 --> 01:23:15,221
Oh, shit!

1767
01:23:15,295 --> 01:23:17,729
Hey, man,
you dropped it in my lap!

1768
01:23:17,798 --> 01:23:19,231
Well, stop the car.

1769
01:23:19,299 --> 01:23:21,096
Reach your hand
down there.

1770
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:23,295
Stop the car. Here.

1771
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:24,663
Cabron,
my huevos is too hot.

1772
01:23:24,663 --> 01:23:26,324
Cabron,
my huevos is too hot.

1773
01:23:26,398 --> 01:23:28,127
Ydespues I choke

1774
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,258
Oh, shit!

1775
01:23:29,335 --> 01:23:31,701
Ytodo mis care

1776
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:33,670
Go up in smoke

1777
01:23:33,739 --> 01:23:36,401
Come on,
let's go get high

1778
01:23:36,475 --> 01:23:39,603
Up in smoke

1779
01:23:39,678 --> 01:23:44,081
That's where
I want to be

1780
01:23:45,918 --> 01:23:48,944
'Cause when I'm high

1781
01:23:49,021 --> 01:23:54,084
The world below
don't bother me

1782
01:23:55,728 --> 01:24:05,194
When life begins to be
one long and dangerous road

1783
01:24:05,271 --> 01:24:08,263
I take a toke

1784
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:12,936
And all my cares
go up in smoke

1785
01:24:14,947 --> 01:24:22,285
Hay gente que se mortifica
all the time

1786
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:32,619
Se hacen viejos
antes de su tiempo

1787
01:24:34,533 --> 01:24:42,133
But I say arabata
all the gusto you can find

1788
01:24:44,043 --> 01:24:51,006
Porque all of the time
get high, high

1789
01:24:51,083 --> 01:24:53,916
Come on,
let's go get high

1790
01:24:53,986 --> 01:24:57,183
Up in smoke

1791
01:24:57,256 --> 01:25:03,126
That's where
I want to be

1792
01:25:03,195 --> 01:25:05,857
'Cause when I'm high

1793
01:25:05,931 --> 01:25:11,267
The world below
don't bother me

1794
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:22,541
When life begins to be
one long and dangerous road

1795
01:25:22,614 --> 01:25:25,549
I take a toke

1796
01:25:25,617 --> 01:25:31,180
And all my cares
go up in smoke...

1797
01:25:32,658 --> 01:25:35,525
I take a toke

1798
01:25:35,594 --> 01:25:37,118
And all my cares

1799
01:25:37,196 --> 01:25:41,132
Go up in smoke
