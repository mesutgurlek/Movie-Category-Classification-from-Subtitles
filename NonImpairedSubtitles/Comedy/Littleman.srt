1
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.628
One, two, three...

2
00:00:50.794 --> 00:00:52.855
...three, three.

3
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.293
Yo, what comes after three?

4
00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:56.794
Four. Four comes after three.

5
00:00:56.967 --> 00:00:58.960
- I don't hear you counting.
- Four.

6
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.033
Four.

7
00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:04.733
- Five.
- Five.

8
00:01:04.908 --> 00:01:07.378
- Six.
- Six. Faster.

9
00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:10.310
- Seven, eight.
- Sims. Sims!

10
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.915
You're going home.

11
00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:22.252
I'll see you around, sweet mouth.

12
00:01:23.594 --> 00:01:25.256
Inmate on deck.

13
00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.126
- He'll be back.
- What's up, baby?

14
00:01:28.298 --> 00:01:29.824
See you around, big man.

15
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:32.764
Gate open.

16
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:57.556
Where the hell is this guy?

17
00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:09.803
Cal. Cal.

18
00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:17.113
- What an idiot.
- Let me pop this door for my man.

19
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.273
My main man,
just getting home from prison.

20
00:02:22.052 --> 00:02:25.651
- Percy.
- I'm sorry, Cal.

21
00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:27.451
You stupid?

22
00:02:29.126 --> 00:02:32.064
All right, wait. Hold up.
So they want us to steal a diamond?

23
00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:36.226
- How much your man Walken paying?
- Dig this. A hundred G's.

24
00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.369
A hundred G's?

25
00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.835
- That's good loot.
- Enough to get my label started.

26
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:44.207
Let me give you a taste
of my first single.

27
00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:48.408
- It's fire.
- Yeah.

28
00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:51.372
Never been shot before...

29
00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.988
...but I've been beat about the skull
and the neck area with a crowbar.

30
00:02:55.152 --> 00:02:56.917
Check the lyrics, check the lyrics.

31
00:02:57.387 --> 00:02:59.118
I'll take you to the butcher shop

32
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.822
Let you lick a big pork chop

33
00:03:01.992 --> 00:03:04.155
Girl, I know you like ham hocks

34
00:03:04.327 --> 00:03:07.630
If you're Jewish, I even got lox
Hey! Hey!

35
00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:09.864
Yo, camel-mouth.

36
00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:13.632
- That's 50 Cent.
- Cal, that's not 50 Cent.

37
00:03:13.804 --> 00:03:15.102
He talk about candy.

38
00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:17.673
I'm talking about meat.

39
00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:20.540
That's a whole other level. P-Unit.

40
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:22.874
You better off stuffing your money
in a mattress.

41
00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:25.813
Yeah. I bet you gonna
mess your money up...

42
00:03:25.982 --> 00:03:27.451
...on booze and cheap hookers.

43
00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:28.847
- So?
- What you need to do...

44
00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.489
...is iust find you a nice girl
and settle down, Cal.

45
00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:33.487
Come on, P,
you know that ain't happening.

46
00:03:33.657 --> 00:03:36.025
I mean, you being all short and all.

47
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.727
Let me tell you something
about love.

48
00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:42.460
I never had it. I don't want it.
I don't need it. All right?

49
00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:46.131
You ain't gotta keep hitting me, Calvin.
I'm not your child.

50
00:03:46.303 --> 00:03:50.209
How am I gonna be a hard-core rapper
if you keep putting your hands on me?

51
00:03:50.373 --> 00:03:55.475
Don't push me
Because I'm close to the edge

52
00:03:55.646 --> 00:03:58.516
Check this out. You hang in the back
until Vanessa gets here.

53
00:03:58.682 --> 00:04:00.275
When I give a signal, you come out.

54
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.510
That's cool. I got you.

55
00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:04.349
Hey, Jimmy, please, man.
This is the biggest day of my life.

56
00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:07.824
- It's gotta go off right, okay?
- Baby, what'd I tell you? I got you.

57
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:09.482
And can I say something?

58
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.426
- Congratulations, man.
- Thank you.

59
00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:15.431
You done stepped up to the plate.
Give me a hug, homeboy.

60
00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.765
Oh, man, you done did it,
you know.

61
00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:23.708
Hey, man, you ain't had to do this.

62
00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:26.267
You know, the valet tripping.

63
00:04:26.443 --> 00:04:28.914
- Made me park around the corner.
- Jimmy, get- Beat it.

64
00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:30.708
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Get on it.

65
00:04:35.318 --> 00:04:38.085
- Hi.
- Hey, beautiful.

66
00:04:39.623 --> 00:04:42.219
So I'm so glad
that you got out of work to be here.

67
00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:47.331
You think I wouldn't take off work?
And miss this? Are you crazy?

68
00:04:47.497 --> 00:04:49.228
Look at you, beautiful.

69
00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.269
- You are glowing. My God.
- Thank you.

70
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.437
It feels like it was iust yesterday...

71
00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.934
...sitting in this same restaurant,
when I asked you to marry me.

72
00:04:59.776 --> 00:05:02.613
I'm still working on that diamond.
I didn't forget the diamond.

73
00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:06.446
I know, baby. You are the sweetest,
most supportive man on the planet.

74
00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:09.210
Can I talk now?

75
00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:11.356
- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- Okay.

76
00:05:11.522 --> 00:05:14.254
So you know what I've been waiting
all week to find out.

77
00:05:14.424 --> 00:05:16.121
Yes. Yep.

78
00:05:16.292 --> 00:05:18.490
- Well, I got the news...
- Yeah.

79
00:05:18.662 --> 00:05:22.157
- ... and I'm-
- Pregnant. Yes! Yes!

80
00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:25.228
- Having my baby
- Oh, no.

81
00:05:25.402 --> 00:05:27.235
- Is so important to me
- No. No, no.

82
00:05:27.404 --> 00:05:29.306
- Darryl. Darryl.
- Baby.

83
00:05:29.472 --> 00:05:32.639
- There's nothing more special
- Darryl- No, honey, I'm not pregnant.

84
00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:34.643
- I'm not pregnant.
- Than to raise a family

85
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:37.282
- Excuse me, sir. Sir. Sir.
- I thought that you-

86
00:05:37.447 --> 00:05:38.575
- Hey.
- And-

87
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:40.217
- Sir.
- Jimmy.

88
00:05:40.817 --> 00:05:42.754
- And-
- Sir!

89
00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.415
No. Stop. No.

90
00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:47.753
I'm not pregnant.

91
00:05:48.792 --> 00:05:50.819
- No?
- No.

92
00:05:56.132 --> 00:05:57.123
You're not pregnant?

93
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.170
Baby, but you was nauseous
and throwing up all over the place.

94
00:06:00.336 --> 00:06:01.704
Well, I was very nervous.

95
00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.102
Baby, what are we doing here?

96
00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:06.437
Darryl...

97
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.408
...I got the promotion.

98
00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:12.018
And we're movin' on up
To the east side

99
00:06:12.182 --> 00:06:13.445
Jimmy.

100
00:06:13.617 --> 00:06:16.087
They'll be movin' on up
To that apartment in the sky

101
00:06:16.253 --> 00:06:20.159
- I'm gonna hurt him.
- Hey. Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy, stop.

102
00:06:20.323 --> 00:06:22.556
- Man- Man, you ain't got to do this.
- Hey...

103
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.030
- Okay, then. All right.
- Beat it.

104
00:06:27.497 --> 00:06:29.730
Congratulations.
I'm really proud of you.

105
00:06:32.302 --> 00:06:33.703
But?

106
00:06:34.572 --> 00:06:36.701
But I thought we was gonna
start a family.

107
00:06:38.108 --> 00:06:40.010
We will, baby.

108
00:06:40.477 --> 00:06:43.712
You know, with this promotion,
everything's on track now.

109
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.912
In a couple of years I'll be senior V.P.,
and I can take time off to have a child.

110
00:06:48.085 --> 00:06:50.055
A couple of years?
I don't wanna wait years.

111
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.555
Darryl, you know,
having a baby changes everything.

112
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.789
Hey, I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

113
00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.053
So no more late-night poker
with the guys.

114
00:06:57.828 --> 00:06:58.818
Cool.

115
00:06:59.462 --> 00:07:00.761
No more...

116
00:07:00.931 --> 00:07:02.662
...afternoon quickies.

117
00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:05.326
Stop right there.
We haven't had a afternoon quickie...

118
00:07:05.503 --> 00:07:06.835
...since your father moved in.

119
00:07:07.004 --> 00:07:10.603
That is not fair. My dad is getting old.
Sometimes he forgets things.

120
00:07:10.774 --> 00:07:13.074
I don't feel comfortable
with him living by himself.

121
00:07:13.243 --> 00:07:14.507
What about Whispering Glen?

122
00:07:14.678 --> 00:07:17.240
That place looked like a country club
inside the brochure.

123
00:07:17.413 --> 00:07:19.350
They got Viagra vending machines.

124
00:07:19.517 --> 00:07:20.507
You listen to me.

125
00:07:20.684 --> 00:07:24.248
Until he is a danger to himself
or others, he is staying with us.

126
00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:27.284
Now...

127
00:07:27.457 --> 00:07:29.120
...can we celebrate?

128
00:07:29.292 --> 00:07:34.291
Celebration, come on
We gonna celebrate tonight

129
00:07:34.464 --> 00:07:37.699
Come on, come on, let's celebrate
Let's not have a fight

130
00:07:37.868 --> 00:07:40.031
And I'm not talking tonight

131
00:07:40.203 --> 00:07:42.139
Remix!
Now just you ladies

132
00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:47.304
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate

133
00:08:00.057 --> 00:08:02.323
Hey, oblivious.
What are you doing?

134
00:08:02.492 --> 00:08:04.588
Getting ready to rob a iewelry store,
Calvin.

135
00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:06.253
I'm going straight Jesse James.

136
00:08:06.429 --> 00:08:09.664
Percy, put the gun away. Guns
is how you wind up back in prison.

137
00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:13.465
I'm telling you, I ain't going back
to jail. You understand?

138
00:08:13.637 --> 00:08:15.333
Now put the gun away.

139
00:08:15.773 --> 00:08:17.332
Why you gotta keep hitting me, Cal?

140
00:08:17.508 --> 00:08:20.172
Sometimes I gotta slap
some sense into you, Percy.

141
00:08:20.343 --> 00:08:21.402
Come on. Give me a hand.

142
00:08:25.616 --> 00:08:27.084
Now, would you trust the big man?

143
00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:30.010
I got a plan, yo.

144
00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:35.824
Now, this stone is a 3-karat,
G- color diamond.

145
00:08:35.992 --> 00:08:39.797
- VVS2, nearly flawless.
- It's been a pleasure, sir.

146
00:08:40.197 --> 00:08:41.757
Just be cool, Cal. I'm telling you.

147
00:08:42.065 --> 00:08:44.228
Oh, there she go. There's-

148
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.870
Go ahead. Do your thing, Cal.

149
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.050
Pardon me for iust a moment.

150
00:09:01.218 --> 00:09:03.450
- Do your thing.
- Yes? May I help you?

151
00:09:05.122 --> 00:09:08.823
Percy. CEO and A&R
of P-Unit Records.

152
00:09:08.992 --> 00:09:10.985
Here to pick up iewelry
for one of my artists.

153
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:13.488
Well, holler at your girl.

154
00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:16.231
Step this way, Percy P.

155
00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:18.392
I like the way you said
my name just now.

156
00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:20.128
Can I sit down? She's sitting down.

157
00:09:20.303 --> 00:09:22.638
Of course you may.
Would you like some gin and juice?

158
00:09:41.091 --> 00:09:43.562
Well, I'm gonna show you
some shiznit right about now.

159
00:09:46.897 --> 00:09:50.495
Yes. Come to daddy.

160
00:10:02.478 --> 00:10:04.712
Now that's what
I'm talking about, baby.

161
00:10:04.882 --> 00:10:07.011
So, what can I get for you
today, Percy P.?

162
00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:10.889
All of the above.

163
00:10:14.792 --> 00:10:17.194
I'll send one of my assistants
from P-Unit Records...

164
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.624
...to pick everything up.

165
00:10:18.796 --> 00:10:22.793
Just tell him to pull up to my bumper,
and I'll throw that junk in his trunk.

166
00:10:23.433 --> 00:10:24.595
Word?

167
00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:27.830
Let me get up out of here.
I gotta bounce.

168
00:10:28.004 --> 00:10:30.475
I got some people meeting me
down there, and I gotta...

169
00:10:30.808 --> 00:10:32.869
So I'm gonna leave, you know?

170
00:10:33.276 --> 00:10:36.545
- Okay? See you later, all right? Peace.
- Peace.

171
00:10:38.348 --> 00:10:39.874
Be cool. What's going on in there?

172
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.713
Has anyone seen my dog?

173
00:10:43.353 --> 00:10:44.378
Hi, puppy.

174
00:10:49.793 --> 00:10:51.318
He stole my dog.

175
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:54.721
Holy crap.

176
00:10:55.599 --> 00:10:57.501
The Queen's diamond. It's gone.

177
00:10:57.668 --> 00:11:00.434
Relax. We almost there, man.
We about to be paid, man.

178
00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:03.404
I need the police.
Yes, there's been a robbery.

179
00:11:05.743 --> 00:11:08.806
We did it. Modern-day
Butch Cassidy and Sundance.

180
00:11:08.979 --> 00:11:11.176
Come back here with my dog.

181
00:11:11.782 --> 00:11:14.344
- Get out of here, mutt.
- You just tossed a Chihuahua.

182
00:11:14.518 --> 00:11:17.353
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Gotcha that. We are gone.

183
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:18.819
Come on, Percy.

184
00:11:21.592 --> 00:11:24.119
- Oh, man.
- This ain't time to be doing doughnuts.

185
00:11:27.497 --> 00:11:28.796
I can't believe this, man.

186
00:11:29.132 --> 00:11:30.692
Damn it, Percy.

187
00:11:30.868 --> 00:11:33.772
You got a boot on the car,
and you about to get one in your butt.

188
00:11:33.937 --> 00:11:35.873
- She finally got me.
- Who?

189
00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:38.943
Nettie, down at Motor Vehicles.
Said I got her pregnant.

190
00:11:39.109 --> 00:11:41.546
I went to family court.
I had all my receipts.

191
00:11:42.513 --> 00:11:43.640
I'm out.

192
00:11:44.715 --> 00:11:47.379
- Hey, yo, Percy. You forgot something.
- What?

193
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:49.383
Me!

194
00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:53.282
- Come on!
- Sorry, Cal.

195
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:03.267
- They went that way.
- What'd he look like?

196
00:12:03.433 --> 00:12:04.993
- Black.
- I got him.

197
00:12:05.168 --> 00:12:07.297
- Dark or light?
- Medium.

198
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.964
Suspect is escaping on foot.
African-American male.

199
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.976
About 5'1 O", not real dark,
more of a mocha-caramel color.

200
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.546
What? You shot?

201
00:12:24.788 --> 00:12:27.692
Sweet beiesus.
My muscle, I think I pulled it.

202
00:12:27.858 --> 00:12:29.657
Quick. In here.

203
00:12:32.495 --> 00:12:34.523
Yo, quick, put me down.
We gotta split up.

204
00:12:34.698 --> 00:12:36.223
Okay.

205
00:12:44.608 --> 00:12:47.842
It's late because of the stress,
not because I'm pregnant.

206
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:51.507
Please, don't even say words like
"stress. " It's not good for the baby.

207
00:12:52.015 --> 00:12:54.212
Darryl, there is no baby.

208
00:12:54.384 --> 00:12:56.514
- Aisle two.
- Well, why didn't you just say that?

209
00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:11.502
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay, fine. Just humor me, okay?

210
00:13:11.668 --> 00:13:13.365
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

211
00:13:17.307 --> 00:13:21.247
- Enough.
- Okay, okay.

212
00:13:27.585 --> 00:13:29.213
I got one!

213
00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:37.620
- Come on, man.
- Do not resist. Do not resist.

214
00:13:37.794 --> 00:13:39.731
- I'm not resisting.
- Wilson. Wilson. Wilson.

215
00:13:39.897 --> 00:13:41.331
Come on. It's not our guy.

216
00:13:41.498 --> 00:13:43.731
What? You said African-American.

217
00:13:44.034 --> 00:13:46.334
Yeah, but I said
a mocha-caramel color.

218
00:13:46.504 --> 00:13:49.168
He's like a Starbucks black decaf,
maybe a little cream.

219
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.906
- It's not our guy. Sorry about that.
- Come on, man.

220
00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:54.740
- You sure?
- Yeah. He's okay.

221
00:13:57.648 --> 00:13:59.777
- Wilson!
- Well, he looked mocha to me.

222
00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:04.920
- Thank you.
- What?

223
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.527
He looked real shady. He gonna
do something else, and I'll be waiting.

224
00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:13.689
- You still got the diamond?
- No.

225
00:14:13.864 --> 00:14:15.663
- I had to ditch it.
- Where?

226
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.760
In her bag.

227
00:14:18.936 --> 00:14:20.336
Calvin, now what?

228
00:14:20.504 --> 00:14:21.597
We go get it.

229
00:14:24.508 --> 00:14:26.340
Let's go. Come on.

230
00:14:33.884 --> 00:14:35.786
Follow that car.

231
00:14:57.808 --> 00:14:59.003
Yo, there they are.

232
00:14:59.176 --> 00:15:00.405
- There is no baby.
- There is.

233
00:15:00.578 --> 00:15:03.048
- Honey, there is no baby.
- Well, there will be.

234
00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:05.550
Let's go.

235
00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:12.216
Daddy, we're home.

236
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.154
- There's my baby girl.
- Hi, Daddy.

237
00:15:18.095 --> 00:15:20.156
Who's the best daddy
in the whole, wide world?

238
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.699
- I am.
- I know you can do better than that.

239
00:15:22.866 --> 00:15:25.098
Who's the best daddy
in the whole, wide world?

240
00:15:25.268 --> 00:15:28.035
- I am.
- I can't hear you.

241
00:15:28.205 --> 00:15:30.368
I'm the best daddy
in the whole, wide world!

242
00:15:43.453 --> 00:15:44.854
So, what's the good news?

243
00:15:45.022 --> 00:15:46.456
Dad...

244
00:15:46.624 --> 00:15:48.058
...I got the promotion.

245
00:15:48.692 --> 00:15:52.723
Congratulations. Soon you'll make
enough money to leave that bum.

246
00:15:52.896 --> 00:15:54.593
Oh, Dad, he's not a bum.

247
00:15:54.765 --> 00:15:57.463
No? What kind of man
gives the woman he loves...

248
00:15:57.634 --> 00:15:59.228
...a wedding ring with no diamond?

249
00:15:59.402 --> 00:16:02.569
Hey, as soon as I make enough
money, I'm gonna buy her a diamond.

250
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.142
And I'm going to do the nasty
with Jennifer Lopez...

251
00:16:05.308 --> 00:16:08.212
...while Halle Berry tickle my butt.

252
00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:11.978
You know, for a moment
I thought you were gonna tell me...

253
00:16:12.148 --> 00:16:14.210
...you were gonna let this one
impregnate you.

254
00:16:14.384 --> 00:16:17.117
But I see now, this man
ain't got no bullets in the chamber.

255
00:16:17.287 --> 00:16:18.756
What's that supposed to mean?

256
00:16:18.922 --> 00:16:20.892
You heard me.
You're shooting blanks.

257
00:16:21.058 --> 00:16:23.723
- Cooking with a wet noodle.
- What?

258
00:16:23.894 --> 00:16:25.727
Can't hoist the mainsail

259
00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:29.300
My sperm have fallen
and it can't get up.

260
00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:31.459
I'll have you know,
I hit that every night.

261
00:16:31.635 --> 00:16:33.467
Hey, that's my daughter
you talking about.

262
00:16:33.637 --> 00:16:36.403
- Back up, old man.
- Okay, okay. Stop. Stop. Please.

263
00:16:36.574 --> 00:16:37.599
Gentlemen.

264
00:16:37.775 --> 00:16:42.717
Dad, we are going to have a baby
when the time is right.

265
00:16:43.514 --> 00:16:45.711
Play nice.

266
00:16:53.056 --> 00:16:54.251
It's still in the bag.

267
00:16:55.325 --> 00:16:58.229
Still in the bag.
Let's go get the rock.

268
00:16:58.394 --> 00:17:01.960
Yo, Percy, how many times
I gotta tell you? No guns.

269
00:17:02.132 --> 00:17:03.122
What we gonna do?

270
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.272
Walken is gonna kill us
if we don't give him the diamond.

271
00:17:06.436 --> 00:17:08.463
Then I guess we gotta find
a way to sneak in.

272
00:17:12.676 --> 00:17:15.442
Well, they did say
they wanted a baby.

273
00:17:16.379 --> 00:17:18.748
No. No.

274
00:17:18.915 --> 00:17:21.649
No. I ain't dressing up like no baby.

275
00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:25.556
Keep still, Cal. You heavy.
You gonna make me drop you.

276
00:17:25.722 --> 00:17:28.216
You drop me
and I'm gonna drop you.

277
00:17:28.391 --> 00:17:30.054
Now, look, you stay close.

278
00:17:30.226 --> 00:17:32.824
I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna
get the diamond, and I'm out.

279
00:17:32.996 --> 00:17:37.300
If you don't mind me saying, Cal,
you make a cute little baby.

280
00:17:37.467 --> 00:17:38.527
I'm out.

281
00:17:38.702 --> 00:17:40.968
You couldn't find
nothing better than a dog basket?

282
00:17:41.138 --> 00:17:44.578
You iust be cool. I told you,
this gonna be great, Cal.

283
00:17:48.546 --> 00:17:50.378
Just hold tight.
Everything gonna be fine.

284
00:17:50.548 --> 00:17:52.711
I'm gonna be over here
in the bushes.

285
00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:02.888
Move, dog.

286
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.087
Get out of here.
I'll make a coat out of you.

287
00:18:05.261 --> 00:18:07.597
Get out of here
before I feed you some chocolate.

288
00:18:08.264 --> 00:18:10.736
Get out of here, you fleabag.

289
00:18:10.901 --> 00:18:12.564
- Go.
- Get out of here.

290
00:18:12.736 --> 00:18:14.763
Wait, hold-
Wait. Muttley, wait. No, no.

291
00:18:30.621 --> 00:18:32.021
Honey.

292
00:18:32.189 --> 00:18:33.920
- Yeah?
- Come here.

293
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.124
- What is it, Darryl?
- Look.

294
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:40.794
Oh, my God.

295
00:18:40.964 --> 00:18:42.432
It's a baby.

296
00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:46.428
I know. And here's a note too.

297
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.967
"Plez luk tafter Kalvin.

298
00:18:49.139 --> 00:18:52.635
We wuzn't abele to keap em. "

299
00:18:52.809 --> 00:18:54.746
Poor guy.
His parents must've been retarded.

300
00:18:55.613 --> 00:18:57.206
Well, let's get him inside.

301
00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.749
- It's cold out here.
- Okay, okay. All right.

302
00:18:59.917 --> 00:19:01.112
Come on, little guy.

303
00:19:01.284 --> 00:19:03.151
- Yes.
- I got you.

304
00:19:05.989 --> 00:19:07.549
Oh, damn.

305
00:19:08.091 --> 00:19:10.220
- What in the hell is that?
- I don't know.

306
00:19:11.662 --> 00:19:13.062
Man.

307
00:19:13.463 --> 00:19:15.730
Dad, we found a baby
on the doorstep.

308
00:19:15.899 --> 00:19:18.598
- What? What is it? A boy or girl?
- Dada.

309
00:19:18.869 --> 00:19:20.235
I think it's a boy.

310
00:19:20.403 --> 00:19:22.567
Well, whatever it is,
it smell like piss.

311
00:19:23.707 --> 00:19:26.405
Yeah. I think Janet may have left
diapers here. Let's look.

312
00:19:26.577 --> 00:19:28.638
Doesn't your dad have some
diapers upstairs?

313
00:19:28.812 --> 00:19:31.408
I heard that. I don't wear diapers.
Who you talking about?

314
00:19:32.015 --> 00:19:33.507
Haven't worn a diaper in years.

315
00:19:33.684 --> 00:19:35.677
I think she put them in here.

316
00:19:43.059 --> 00:19:44.620
What is it?

317
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.693
That ain't no baby.
That's a porn star.

318
00:19:49.466 --> 00:19:52.438
What on girth is that?

319
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.639
I'm gonna call Child Services.

320
00:19:55.806 --> 00:19:56.865
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Do that.

321
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.373
Directory assistance.

322
00:20:04.548 --> 00:20:07.348
Yes, can I have the number
for Child Services, please?

323
00:20:07.518 --> 00:20:09.180
Connecting you.

324
00:20:10.053 --> 00:20:12.718
Child Services is now closed
for the weekend.

325
00:20:12.889 --> 00:20:16.420
We will re-open at 9 a. m.
Monday morning.

326
00:20:20.531 --> 00:20:21.965
They're closed for the weekend.

327
00:20:22.132 --> 00:20:24.899
The office doesn't open
until 9:OO on Monday morning.

328
00:20:25.736 --> 00:20:26.829
So, what do we do now?

329
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.641
I say, toss this creature back in
the Black Lagoon where it came from.

330
00:20:30.808 --> 00:20:31.969
Daddy, stop it.

331
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.873
Maybe we should call the police.

332
00:20:46.389 --> 00:20:49.726
- That doesn't sound good.
- No, we should take him to the doctor.

333
00:20:49.893 --> 00:20:52.729
Get him checked out.
Who knows what he's been through?

334
00:20:52.896 --> 00:20:54.364
- Okay?
- I'll go get the car keys.

335
00:20:54.532 --> 00:20:55.522
- All right.
- Okay.

336
00:20:56.366 --> 00:20:59.236
Now, when you get to the hospital,
don't stop. Don't stop.

337
00:20:59.402 --> 00:21:01.873
Toss that monster out the window
and keep moving.

338
00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:05.068
Hit the accelerator. I don't wanna
see that little ugly thing again.

339
00:21:06.544 --> 00:21:08.571
Stinky little thing.

340
00:21:09.346 --> 00:21:10.747
Was it a little cough?

341
00:21:10.914 --> 00:21:11.904
- No.
- No.

342
00:21:12.082 --> 00:21:15.544
No, this was like a grown-man,
smoker's cough.

343
00:21:16.452 --> 00:21:18.720
Well, it's probably nothing.

344
00:21:18.889 --> 00:21:21.382
Come on, let's get his shirt off.

345
00:21:23.761 --> 00:21:26.892
He's a strong little fella.

346
00:21:30.934 --> 00:21:33.565
Oh, my God. What is that scar?

347
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.697
From the look of it, I'd say...

348
00:21:35.873 --> 00:21:38.275
...this little guy has had
his appendix removed.

349
00:21:38.441 --> 00:21:40.274
Or he was
in one hell of a knife fight.

350
00:21:43.714 --> 00:21:45.342
What kind of person
tattoos a child?

351
00:21:45.516 --> 00:21:47.007
Oh, you'd be amazed. Come on.

352
00:21:48.018 --> 00:21:50.113
Open up. Open up and say:

353
00:21:50.287 --> 00:21:52.120
Come on. Come on. Come on.

354
00:21:56.459 --> 00:21:59.158
- Wha-? What is it?
- I've never seen a...

355
00:21:59.329 --> 00:22:00.559
...baby with bridgework.

356
00:22:01.632 --> 00:22:04.798
This child has the mouth
of a 40-year-old man.

357
00:22:05.268 --> 00:22:09.710
I can't tell whether these teeth
are coming in or falling out.

358
00:22:09.873 --> 00:22:11.502
Well, he's gonna be okay?

359
00:22:11.942 --> 00:22:13.240
He's fine.

360
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:17.715
His tonsils are a little swollen
and he might have a bit of a cold.

361
00:22:17.881 --> 00:22:18.871
As a precaution...

362
00:22:19.049 --> 00:22:21.816
...you should take his temperature
before you put him to bed.

363
00:22:21.985 --> 00:22:23.955
- All right. Thank you, Dr. Murphy.
- Okay.

364
00:22:24.121 --> 00:22:26.684
- Thank you very much.
- Bye.

365
00:22:27.524 --> 00:22:30.018
This is iust- It's horrible.
Look at this child.

366
00:22:30.193 --> 00:22:32.060
Let's turn him over
to the authorities.

367
00:22:32.228 --> 00:22:34.358
They can find his parents
and prosecute them.

368
00:22:34.531 --> 00:22:36.000
Are you crazy? We can't do that.

369
00:22:36.166 --> 00:22:37.931
This kid's been through the wringer.

370
00:22:38.101 --> 00:22:40.435
Besides, his birth parents
are probably crackheads.

371
00:22:40.604 --> 00:22:42.506
They're iust gonna
put them in rehab.

372
00:22:42.673 --> 00:22:45.668
Then they'll be back on the street,
selling him for a bag of rocks.

373
00:22:46.343 --> 00:22:48.576
What are you saying?

374
00:22:48.745 --> 00:22:50.978
I'm saying,
why don't we just keep him?

375
00:22:51.381 --> 00:22:53.112
- Just until Monday.
- No. No, Darryl.

376
00:22:53.283 --> 00:22:54.478
- Just until-
- He's a child.

377
00:22:54.652 --> 00:22:57.214
- I don't know what to do with a child.
- Just until Monday.

378
00:22:57.387 --> 00:22:59.254
And then we'll take him
to Child Services.

379
00:22:59.422 --> 00:23:01.586
They'll find a home for him.

380
00:23:01.758 --> 00:23:04.822
Besides, who could take
better care of this child than us?

381
00:23:07.798 --> 00:23:11.066
- Where is he?
- Oh, man.

382
00:23:16.874 --> 00:23:19.242
Where do you think you're going?

383
00:23:20.177 --> 00:23:21.440
Well, what do we got here?

384
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.645
- Is this your baby?
- Yes, thank you.

385
00:23:25.683 --> 00:23:28.085
Well, actually...

386
00:23:28.251 --> 00:23:30.916
- ... we found him-
- Mama.

387
00:23:36.026 --> 00:23:37.655
He called me Mama.

388
00:23:39.062 --> 00:23:40.087
There you go.

389
00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:45.998
Thank you, officer. Thank you.

390
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.071
You know, Percy,
I don't like having to look for people.

391
00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:53.536
Who, me? I wasn't hiding, Mr. W.

392
00:23:53.711 --> 00:23:55.043
Not Percy. Not the Kid.

393
00:23:55.212 --> 00:23:57.182
I was gonna come
soon as I got the diamond.

394
00:23:57.614 --> 00:23:59.083
So you don't have
my diamond, huh?

395
00:23:59.249 --> 00:24:00.718
No. I mean, I do.

396
00:24:00.884 --> 00:24:02.786
I don't have it on me now,
but it's safe.

397
00:24:02.953 --> 00:24:06.016
We got everything on lockdown.
Believe me. Trust me.

398
00:24:06.189 --> 00:24:08.455
You trying to hustle me, Percy?

399
00:24:08.926 --> 00:24:11.921
Hustle a hustler?
Ain't nothing happening, Mr. W.

400
00:24:12.328 --> 00:24:15.165
It's iust that the robbery didn't go
as smooth as we wanted to.

401
00:24:15.331 --> 00:24:18.498
And a situation had popped up,
so we had to split.

402
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:21.732
- But my partner, he-
- Your partner is not my problem.

403
00:24:21.905 --> 00:24:24.375
My problem is
I don't have my diamond.

404
00:24:24.775 --> 00:24:26.768
Now, I'm gonna give you 24 hours.

405
00:24:26.944 --> 00:24:30.212
After that, my problem becomes
Bruno and Rosco's problem.

406
00:24:31.448 --> 00:24:32.815
And they...

407
00:24:32.983 --> 00:24:34.543
...become your problem.

408
00:24:34.718 --> 00:24:36.084
You got a problem with that?

409
00:24:36.453 --> 00:24:38.686
Ain't got no problem with that, Mr. W.

410
00:24:38.855 --> 00:24:40.758
I got it all under control, I swear.

411
00:24:40.924 --> 00:24:43.087
Don't want a smudge on it,
not a speck, nothing.

412
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.321
Not a smudge.

413
00:24:45.729 --> 00:24:46.958
Okay, Mr. W.

414
00:24:47.998 --> 00:24:49.398
Get him out of here.

415
00:24:49.567 --> 00:24:51.537
- Get him out of here.
- Come on.

416
00:24:57.641 --> 00:24:59.668
Ain't nothing better
than the evening news...

417
00:24:59.843 --> 00:25:02.370
...and my favorite, milk and cookies.

418
00:25:03.113 --> 00:25:05.276
Damn, I forgot my milk.

419
00:25:05.448 --> 00:25:07.681
Jeez, man,
you can't be popping up like that.

420
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:09.916
For a moment
I thought you were Chucky.

421
00:25:10.453 --> 00:25:12.116
About to put you in a chokehold.

422
00:25:14.124 --> 00:25:15.718
What are you looking at?

423
00:25:16.627 --> 00:25:20.430
A man who exposed himself to
police oflicers in a doughnut shop...

424
00:25:20.598 --> 00:25:22.966
...claimed that voices
made him do it.

425
00:25:23.133 --> 00:25:26.003
Oh, honey, look how
comfortable he is with us.

426
00:25:26.169 --> 00:25:28.162
He is so cute.

427
00:25:28.338 --> 00:25:29.932
Oh, no, you don't.

428
00:25:30.107 --> 00:25:32.943
No, you don't. No, no, no.

429
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.977
- Dad.
- Come on, Pop, let him sit there.

430
00:25:35.145 --> 00:25:38.550
- Let him have a cookie.
- This is my throne, my sanctuary.

431
00:25:38.715 --> 00:25:40.709
This is my air, my end zone.

432
00:25:40.884 --> 00:25:43.947
- It's iust a cookie.
- Oh, it start with the cookie.

433
00:25:46.356 --> 00:25:50.387
Then they want to come to dinner.
Then they want to move in.

434
00:25:50.961 --> 00:25:54.731
Next thing you know,
they're married to your daughter.

435
00:25:55.298 --> 00:25:58.738
- Why he got to bring it back here-
- Already made that mistake once.

436
00:25:58.902 --> 00:26:00.131
- Come on, now.
- Honey.

437
00:26:00.303 --> 00:26:02.170
No more, my brother.

438
00:26:02.339 --> 00:26:05.540
Nobody makes a fool out of me.
I'm from Detroit.

439
00:26:07.511 --> 00:26:09.070
- Everybody's here.
- I can't wait...

440
00:26:09.245 --> 00:26:11.182
...for everybody to meet little Calvin.

441
00:26:11.982 --> 00:26:13.542
- I'm so excited.
- Yeah, yeah.

442
00:26:13.717 --> 00:26:17.349
Introduce him to everybody else, and
go over to somebody else's house.

443
00:26:21.391 --> 00:26:22.985
Cookie got a little bite to it.

444
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.397
- Hi. Come in, come in, come in.
- Hello, hello, hello.

445
00:26:26.564 --> 00:26:30.196
- Hello, hello.
- I'm so excited.

446
00:26:30.367 --> 00:26:31.597
- Hey.
- Hello.

447
00:26:31.768 --> 00:26:35.800
- Consuela, welcome. Come in.
- So where is the little one?

448
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.773
- Here's Calvin.
- Here's Calvin.

449
00:26:44.848 --> 00:26:47.284
- What a mess.
- Honey, that's not nice.

450
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.386
He's scary.

451
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.281
Yeah, well, I mean...

452
00:26:53.256 --> 00:26:58.198
- I mean, lucky he's not yours, right?
- Yeah.

453
00:26:59.863 --> 00:27:03.029
I iust think he is precious.
I think he is a precious gift from God.

454
00:27:03.634 --> 00:27:04.966
You know, God gives gifts.

455
00:27:05.135 --> 00:27:09.543
Sometimes he wraps them in a hurry.
Sometimes. Isn't he a precious gift?

456
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.044
Oh, yeah. He's adorable...

457
00:27:13.644 --> 00:27:16.444
...in a National Geographic
sort of way.

458
00:27:18.148 --> 00:27:19.913
What is he, a pygmy?

459
00:27:24.387 --> 00:27:26.620
Consuela, why don't you take
the kids to go play?

460
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:28.088
Yes, good idea.
Come on, guys.

461
00:27:28.258 --> 00:27:30.889
Tommy, show Nicholas
that scissor-lock thing...

462
00:27:31.061 --> 00:27:32.553
...we've been working on, huh?

463
00:27:34.698 --> 00:27:38.364
Hey, little man.
No hard feelings, right?

464
00:27:41.404 --> 00:27:42.737
Give me five.

465
00:27:49.412 --> 00:27:51.781
Hey, guess what, Calvin?
We brought you some stuff.

466
00:27:51.949 --> 00:27:54.512
We got you some stuff.
We got a box full of bottles, bibs.

467
00:27:54.685 --> 00:27:57.885
Oh, and all of the Dinosaurus Rex
tapes you could possibly want.

468
00:27:58.054 --> 00:27:59.820
Well, thank you. That's a lot of stuff.

469
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.987
He is so cute. I got your nose.

470
00:28:04.161 --> 00:28:07.361
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

471
00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.293
Oh, you got my nose.

472
00:28:11.468 --> 00:28:14.703
You got my nose. Yes, you do.

473
00:28:16.006 --> 00:28:18.807
He's got my nose. He's got my nose.
He's hurting-

474
00:28:18.976 --> 00:28:20.342
Darryl, he's hurting me.

475
00:28:20.511 --> 00:28:23.004
- He's hurting me.
- Okay, okay, okay.

476
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.047
Wow, is he strong.

477
00:28:25.649 --> 00:28:28.119
Yeah, tell me about it.
I still can't feel my hand.

478
00:28:28.285 --> 00:28:30.756
Okay, Darryl, I think you should
take the crib upstairs.

479
00:28:30.921 --> 00:28:33.221
- Yes.
- Ladies, will you help with this stuff?

480
00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:34.620
Okay.

481
00:28:34.792 --> 00:28:36.853
- Guys, help me grab this.
- I'll get this box.

482
00:28:37.027 --> 00:28:39.224
Let's go into the kitchen.
Come, Calvin.

483
00:28:39.395 --> 00:28:42.266
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, little pumpkin-butt.

484
00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:45.563
Janet, this fits perfectly.

485
00:28:46.036 --> 00:28:47.436
- Thank you.
- Let me see.

486
00:28:48.171 --> 00:28:49.970
I'm glad I kept it.

487
00:28:50.541 --> 00:28:53.341
Can't remember the last time
I could wear horizontal stripes.

488
00:28:54.311 --> 00:28:57.215
But, you know, here I go again.
How about you, woman of the hour?

489
00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.216
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Oh, thank you.

490
00:29:00.383 --> 00:29:02.752
It's awesome.
Was Darryl so excited or what?

491
00:29:02.919 --> 00:29:07.088
No, actually. He was disappointed.

492
00:29:07.257 --> 00:29:09.489
Baby up-up.

493
00:29:11.928 --> 00:29:14.901
He thought I was going to tell him
I was pregnant.

494
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.563
Okay, right.

495
00:29:21.739 --> 00:29:23.504
Little Ms. Corporate-Climber
pregnant?

496
00:29:23.674 --> 00:29:28.981
What? You guys.
I want to have a baby at some point.

497
00:29:29.145 --> 00:29:32.847
You could schedule one between
a conference call and a client meeting.

498
00:29:34.284 --> 00:29:37.951
Okay, you know, Darryl is the one
that I'm really worried about.

499
00:29:38.121 --> 00:29:40.524
Are you kidding me?
You're lucky he wants one at all.

500
00:29:40.691 --> 00:29:42.593
I had to promise Greg
I'd give him these.

501
00:29:44.695 --> 00:29:48.134
Okay, now. Okay, easy, fella.

502
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.774
This one's real grabby.
He must have been breast-fed.

503
00:29:55.372 --> 00:29:57.239
Is the baby hungry?

504
00:29:57.708 --> 00:29:58.767
He should be nursed.

505
00:29:58.942 --> 00:30:00.935
Baby like nursey-nursey.

506
00:30:01.579 --> 00:30:03.879
Well, are you sure
you should do that?

507
00:30:04.047 --> 00:30:06.678
Yeah. You don't have to be
the birth mother to breast-feed.

508
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.946
- Nursey-nursey?
- You want to nursey?

509
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:14.825
Okay.

510
00:30:18.896 --> 00:30:20.262
All right.

511
00:30:20.997 --> 00:30:24.733
- Drink up, precious.
- This one's real wriggly, huh?

512
00:30:24.902 --> 00:30:27.999
Come on. Come on, now. Suck it.

513
00:30:28.171 --> 00:30:32.943
Latch- Oh, that is not okay.

514
00:30:34.845 --> 00:30:36.108
Let's get these kids home.

515
00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:38.978
I have to take Nicholas and Chrissy
to Mommy and Me tomorrow.

516
00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:40.447
Oh, have fun.

517
00:30:40.618 --> 00:30:43.715
Don't worry about the nose.
He's adorable.

518
00:30:43.887 --> 00:30:46.723
- Thanks for all the stuff.
- Call if you need anything.

519
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.358
- Bye, good night.
- Good night.

520
00:30:48.525 --> 00:30:51.258
If you change your mind
about Consuela, you can take her.

521
00:30:51.428 --> 00:30:53.489
- Oh, thanks.
- I've got, like, all the chores.

522
00:30:53.664 --> 00:30:55.326
One for you...

523
00:30:56.667 --> 00:30:58.660
...and one for the baby.

524
00:31:17.287 --> 00:31:19.086
He's a little charmer, isn't he?

525
00:31:19.289 --> 00:31:21.522
Call me.

526
00:31:23.694 --> 00:31:26.187
I could have sworn he iust
stuck his tongue in my mouth.

527
00:31:34.404 --> 00:31:36.705
- Well, I- That was- I thought-
- That went well.

528
00:31:36.874 --> 00:31:39.037
- Yeah.
- I thought they thought he was cute.

529
00:31:39.209 --> 00:31:41.772
Great. You're wonder-
Oh, Calvin, you did so good.

530
00:31:41.945 --> 00:31:44.006
- Come on. Yeah.
- You did so well.

531
00:31:44.181 --> 00:31:47.119
If that lady touches you in a way
that makes you uncomfortable...

532
00:31:47.283 --> 00:31:48.776
...you let us know, okay?

533
00:31:48.952 --> 00:31:48.952
- Yeah. You're the charmer.
- Yeah.

534
00:31:51.421 --> 00:31:55.556
Does that warm water feel good?
Does it feel nice?

535
00:31:55.726 --> 00:31:57.923
Yeah. Look at you.

536
00:31:58.094 --> 00:32:01.728
Do you want some company in there
with you?

537
00:32:01.899 --> 00:32:03.197
I think we can work that out.

538
00:32:03.767 --> 00:32:06.465
Yeah? Yeah?

539
00:32:06.637 --> 00:32:08.003
Hey, Darryl?

540
00:32:08.171 --> 00:32:11.234
Hello. It's bath time.

541
00:32:14.044 --> 00:32:16.071
Come on, let's get clean.

542
00:32:17.047 --> 00:32:19.985
We gonna clean your little butt-butt.
Yes, we are.

543
00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:21.983
And then we gonna play
Snatch the Marbles.

544
00:32:22.152 --> 00:32:23.587
We're gonna fart in the tub...

545
00:32:23.754 --> 00:32:26.885
...and make our own
little Jacuzzi bubbles.

546
00:32:32.062 --> 00:32:35.466
Oh, the little baby.
Yes, you're so clean now.

547
00:32:35.632 --> 00:32:37.067
You're so nice and clean.

548
00:32:41.838 --> 00:32:44.709
Hey. Okay- Calvin.

549
00:32:44.875 --> 00:32:47.107
Okay, Calvin.

550
00:32:48.344 --> 00:32:49.814
Okay. Hey, Darryl?

551
00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.111
- All right, sweetie.
- Hello, little boy.

552
00:32:53.283 --> 00:32:54.946
Hi, cutie.

553
00:32:55.118 --> 00:32:57.350
Now it's time to get you
all dressed for bed, huh?

554
00:32:57.521 --> 00:33:00.321
Don't forget the doctor said
we need to take his temperature.

555
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.016
Okay.

556
00:33:02.225 --> 00:33:03.454
- Yeah.
- All right.

557
00:33:03.627 --> 00:33:05.095
Open up wide.

558
00:33:05.261 --> 00:33:08.132
- Darryl, what are you doing?
- I'm taking his temperature.

559
00:33:08.298 --> 00:33:11.829
Sweetie, he's a baby,
so that's a rectal thermometer.

560
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.669
Yeah. Go ahead.

561
00:33:14.838 --> 00:33:16.067
- You're such a-
- Okay, baby.

562
00:33:16.239 --> 00:33:18.266
All right. Here we go. There we-

563
00:33:19.476 --> 00:33:21.241
- Oh, shit.
- Darryl, what are you doing?

564
00:33:21.612 --> 00:33:24.310
Darryl, come on. Darryl, iust-

565
00:33:24.481 --> 00:33:26.782
- I'm trying to-
- Honey.

566
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.852
It's okay, Calvin. It's okay.

567
00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:31.285
- If he'll iust roll over here.
- Okay, good, good.

568
00:33:31.454 --> 00:33:33.151
- I could get him down like-
- No, no.

569
00:33:33.323 --> 00:33:36.660
- Wait, be gentle. Calvin, it's okay.
- He's a little strong.

570
00:33:36.827 --> 00:33:39.993
Okay, all right.
Nobody likes this, I know.

571
00:33:40.163 --> 00:33:42.657
I know, nobody- Nobody likes this.

572
00:33:42.833 --> 00:33:46.830
It's okay. It's okay.
Oh, yeah. There we go, son.

573
00:33:47.004 --> 00:33:50.739
- Here comes the choo-choo train.
- You're okay, baby. Oh, yeah.

574
00:33:56.446 --> 00:34:00.945
It's in the tunnel, son.
It's almost at your stop.

575
00:34:05.589 --> 00:34:07.752
There you go, little man.

576
00:34:08.125 --> 00:34:11.929
Now, this is gonna put you to sleep.

577
00:34:12.896 --> 00:34:14.489
All right, little buddy.

578
00:34:20.971 --> 00:34:22.702
Good night, baby.

579
00:34:29.312 --> 00:34:32.250
Like this thing's gonna
put somebody to sleep.

580
00:34:32.849 --> 00:34:34.820
I'm gonna wait for you
to go to sleep.

581
00:34:34.985 --> 00:34:37.455
I'm gonna get my diamond
and be out.

582
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:11.407
Come on, baby, be in here.
Come on.

583
00:36:13.016 --> 00:36:14.279
Come on.

584
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.513
Come on, where you at?
Where you at?

585
00:36:16.687 --> 00:36:18.246
There we go.

586
00:36:19.723 --> 00:36:24.130
Hi, beautiful. Yes.

587
00:36:39.677 --> 00:36:42.375
Man, this idiot better
pick up the phone.

588
00:36:56.927 --> 00:36:59.329
People calling here all kind of time.

589
00:36:59.495 --> 00:37:03.334
Like people don't live here. I mean,
you can't be calling nobody house...

590
00:37:04.134 --> 00:37:08.234
P- Unit Productions, in association
with Go Get a Girl Entertainment.

591
00:37:08.404 --> 00:37:10.740
- Hey, yo, Percy. It's me.
- Calvin?

592
00:37:10.907 --> 00:37:13.846
- What's going on?
- I need you to come pick me up.

593
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.881
- Now, look, I got the dia-
- Reach for the sky.

594
00:37:18.381 --> 00:37:20.078
Who you talking to, sonny boy?

595
00:37:25.255 --> 00:37:27.920
Oh, don't give me that old... crap.

596
00:37:28.091 --> 00:37:29.423
Hand me that damn phone.

597
00:37:30.694 --> 00:37:32.458
- Who is this?
- Me no speak no English.

598
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.893
Wrong number. Sorry.

599
00:37:34.064 --> 00:37:36.729
Who the hell's "No speak the English"?
Who the hell is this?

600
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.665
- Say something.
- What are you doing?

601
00:37:38.836 --> 00:37:41.136
I heard some noises,
came downstairs...

602
00:37:41.304 --> 00:37:43.365
...and caught this little hoodlum
on the phone.

603
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.068
- Must've looked for the safe.
- We don't have a safe.

604
00:37:46.243 --> 00:37:49.010
- He didn't know that.
- Dada.

605
00:37:50.013 --> 00:37:53.919
Pop, man. He's a baby.

606
00:37:54.084 --> 00:37:56.954
It's his first night in a new house.
Probably couldn't sleep.

607
00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.185
Look at you. You look crazy, man.
Holding a shotgun, wearing red socks.

608
00:38:01.358 --> 00:38:04.489
You look like Fred Sanford on crack.
Put that away, man. Go to bed.

609
00:38:04.662 --> 00:38:06.894
Oh, you are good.

610
00:38:07.063 --> 00:38:08.931
You are real good.

611
00:38:09.099 --> 00:38:11.296
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

612
00:38:11.735 --> 00:38:13.260
You gonna give me the finger?

613
00:38:13.436 --> 00:38:16.898
Where did you learn that, huh?
BET videos _fter Dark?

614
00:38:19.777 --> 00:38:21.040
Him scary.

615
00:38:21.211 --> 00:38:22.908
There we go.

616
00:38:23.079 --> 00:38:26.246
Don't pay him any mind.
He just a old, crazy man.

617
00:38:26.416 --> 00:38:29.981
I know iust what to fix you
so you can have a good night's sleep.

618
00:38:44.034 --> 00:38:46.972
Go. Boy, you must have
had a rough first night.

619
00:38:48.438 --> 00:38:50.499
That's because I'm new
at this dad stuff.

620
00:38:50.674 --> 00:38:53.304
Give me a minute,
I'll get it together.

621
00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:00.484
Man, can't imagine
what kind of life you must have had.

622
00:39:01.318 --> 00:39:02.548
I'll tell you this:

623
00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.282
This weekend is gonna be
the best weekend of your life.

624
00:39:05.455 --> 00:39:06.685
You know why?

625
00:39:06.857 --> 00:39:09.761
Because I'm gonna show you
how great it is to have a dad...

626
00:39:09.927 --> 00:39:13.628
...and you're gonna show me
how great it is to be a dad.

627
00:39:14.732 --> 00:39:17.704
Vanessa don't think I can do it,
but I know I got it in me.

628
00:39:17.868 --> 00:39:20.704
You know why? Because
I would never abandon my child.

629
00:39:22.305 --> 00:39:25.540
Ever. I'll always be there for him.

630
00:39:25.909 --> 00:39:28.904
And there'll never be a time
when my son can't come to me...

631
00:39:29.079 --> 00:39:31.447
...and talk to me
about anything in the world...

632
00:39:31.615 --> 00:39:35.555
...over a nice, warm cup of milk.

633
00:39:45.195 --> 00:39:47.860
What's so funny?
What are you all giggly for?

634
00:39:48.632 --> 00:39:50.659
You're drinking Janet's breast milk.

635
00:39:53.804 --> 00:39:58.177
Baby, you did the right thing,
letting him stay with us this weekend.

636
00:39:58.642 --> 00:40:00.474
Thank you.

637
00:40:02.045 --> 00:40:06.919
But you know, I still can't wait for us
to have one of our own.

638
00:40:08.318 --> 00:40:11.985
- Yes, I know.
- All right.

639
00:40:13.089 --> 00:40:15.857
You wanna know the nice thing
about you not being pregnant?

640
00:40:16.359 --> 00:40:17.885
What?

641
00:40:18.161 --> 00:40:20.222
We get to keep trying.

642
00:40:30.541 --> 00:40:33.604
Honey? What about the baby?

643
00:40:33.777 --> 00:40:36.578
He's asleep, don't worry about him.
You've got me.

644
00:40:36.747 --> 00:40:38.546
But, honey...

645
00:40:40.518 --> 00:40:42.282
...he's watching.

646
00:40:45.221 --> 00:40:48.353
He's too young to know
what's going on. Forget him.

647
00:40:51.929 --> 00:40:53.329
Okay.

648
00:40:54.698 --> 00:40:56.394
Okay.

649
00:41:10.914 --> 00:41:12.473
Good morning.

650
00:41:14.184 --> 00:41:17.088
More like, great morning.

651
00:41:17.253 --> 00:41:20.659
Looks like someone had a really good
night's sleep last night.

652
00:41:21.625 --> 00:41:23.253
Who could sleep?

653
00:41:23.426 --> 00:41:26.593
- You were an animal last night.
- Oh, well, you know-

654
00:41:26.763 --> 00:41:30.568
I don't remember the last time
we did it twice in one night.

655
00:41:30.734 --> 00:41:32.202
Twice?

656
00:41:34.805 --> 00:41:36.273
Hey, when did he get in the bed?

657
00:41:38.008 --> 00:41:41.344
I don't know. I don't know
how he gets out of that crib.

658
00:41:41.512 --> 00:41:43.140
He's such a crafty little fella.

659
00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.413
You want some breakfast?

660
00:41:49.587 --> 00:41:51.021
Some more ass.

661
00:41:53.557 --> 00:41:54.923
Twice?

662
00:42:13.511 --> 00:42:16.642
- How's my baby girl this morning?
- So good, Dad.

663
00:42:16.813 --> 00:42:19.216
- How are you?
- Mighty fine, thank you.

664
00:42:19.382 --> 00:42:20.851
No, no, no.

665
00:42:21.018 --> 00:42:23.386
Thanks very much, Jim.
And in other news...

666
00:42:23.554 --> 00:42:26.491
...police have a suspect
in yesterday's daring diamond heist.

667
00:42:26.657 --> 00:42:29.321
It is this man,
Calvin "Baby Face" Sims...

668
00:42:29.492 --> 00:42:31.690
- ... who was released-
- D. Rex, D. Rex, D. Rex.

669
00:42:31.862 --> 00:42:33.729
Stop that,
whatever you're talking about.

670
00:42:33.897 --> 00:42:36.664
D. Rex, D. Rex, D. Rex.

671
00:42:36.833 --> 00:42:38.063
Just be quiet.

672
00:42:38.435 --> 00:42:40.064
- D. Rex.
- Baby Face-

673
00:42:40.336 --> 00:42:43.400
Dad, let Calvin watch his show.

674
00:42:43.774 --> 00:42:47.178
You have to be the adult.
Let Calvin watch his tape.

675
00:42:47.343 --> 00:42:50.248
- I wanna watch the news.
- I don't care what you wanna watch.

676
00:42:50.413 --> 00:42:53.010
He was watching the TV first.

677
00:42:53.183 --> 00:42:54.652
I'll read the news.

678
00:42:54.818 --> 00:42:59.259
I tell you, the world is going to hell
in a handcart.

679
00:43:35.492 --> 00:43:38.430
Wow, Dad,
you really cleaned your plate.

680
00:43:38.596 --> 00:43:40.896
What?
That hobgoblin ate my breakfast.

681
00:43:41.965 --> 00:43:43.958
Oh, Daddy, don't be ridiculous.

682
00:43:44.134 --> 00:43:47.265
I ain't being ridiculous.
That little sucker ate my breakfast.

683
00:43:47.437 --> 00:43:50.968
I'm going to the diner, where I can eat
and watch the news in peace.

684
00:43:51.241 --> 00:43:54.737
Okay, Dad. Be careful.

685
00:43:54.911 --> 00:43:58.750
Why don't we get you some food?
You must be so hungry.

686
00:43:58.915 --> 00:44:01.386
It's time for you to eat something.

687
00:44:02.418 --> 00:44:04.913
- Morning, sweetie.
- Oh, good morning, baby.

688
00:44:05.088 --> 00:44:06.386
Hello.

689
00:44:06.557 --> 00:44:09.552
- I have your breakfast right here.
- Oh, goodie.

690
00:44:11.128 --> 00:44:14.829
Oh, sweetie, okay,
now your dad is really tripping.

691
00:44:15.265 --> 00:44:18.761
Last night, I caught him
holding little Calvin at gunpoint...

692
00:44:18.935 --> 00:44:21.429
...because he heard him
talking on the phone.

693
00:44:21.705 --> 00:44:23.504
That is- That's crazy.

694
00:44:23.807 --> 00:44:26.437
Well, you know...

695
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:31.643
...iust now he ate all of his breakfast,
and then he told me the baby ate it.

696
00:44:32.849 --> 00:44:35.754
- Can you say, "Whispering Glen"?
- No, Darryl.

697
00:44:35.919 --> 00:44:37.319
No nursing homes, okay?

698
00:44:37.487 --> 00:44:39.924
I don't wanna have this conversation
with you again.

699
00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:42.789
I have to go to work,
but the baby's food is here.

700
00:44:42.959 --> 00:44:45.089
- And I love you.
- I love you too.

701
00:44:45.262 --> 00:44:48.633
Have a good day. Kiss. Feed him.

702
00:44:49.633 --> 00:44:51.363
All right.

703
00:44:53.604 --> 00:44:56.906
Okay, okay, let's get you all fed.

704
00:44:57.074 --> 00:45:02.176
All right. Open up wide.
Here come the airplane.

705
00:45:08.185 --> 00:45:09.984
Oh, I see.

706
00:45:10.153 --> 00:45:12.316
You want to play a game
of peekaboo, huh?

707
00:45:12.488 --> 00:45:14.482
Okay, okay, okay.

708
00:45:14.658 --> 00:45:16.286
Peekaboo, I see you.

709
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.796
Peekaboo, I see you.

710
00:45:37.715 --> 00:45:40.881
You gotta be kidding me. God.

711
00:45:48.058 --> 00:45:49.652
Darryl?

712
00:45:50.894 --> 00:45:52.591
Where did I put it?

713
00:45:59.102 --> 00:46:01.265
Honey, I forgot my purse.

714
00:46:02.172 --> 00:46:04.165
Darryl. Darryl.

715
00:46:04.575 --> 00:46:07.945
Sweetheart.
You can't just fall asleep like this.

716
00:46:08.411 --> 00:46:12.181
Oh, honey, I know that you're tired,
but you have to watch the baby.

717
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:15.412
You take your eyes off him for a
minute, God knows what could happen.

718
00:46:15.586 --> 00:46:17.077
I was...

719
00:46:18.021 --> 00:46:20.515
- Darryl.
- I was...

720
00:46:20.691 --> 00:46:22.558
- What...?
- I don't-

721
00:46:22.726 --> 00:46:26.632
Honey, iust take him to the park
or something, okay?

722
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.362
Okay.

723
00:46:29.933 --> 00:46:31.265
What...?

724
00:46:38.942 --> 00:46:42.244
Peekaboo. Then I don't- What?

725
00:46:47.417 --> 00:46:50.048
We gonna play baseball.
We gonna play football.

726
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.124
And we're gonna play golf.

727
00:46:53.456 --> 00:46:56.360
And we're gonna shoot a plane.

728
00:46:56.527 --> 00:46:58.997
We're gonna have fun.

729
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.362
There we go.

730
00:47:04.535 --> 00:47:07.974
All right, son. Now, don't be afraid
to really swing that bat, okay?

731
00:47:08.138 --> 00:47:11.406
Now, the trick is to really
keep your eye on the ball, okay?

732
00:47:11.575 --> 00:47:13.100
Here we go.

733
00:47:18.315 --> 00:47:20.946
Yeah, you want that sucker
to really fly.

734
00:47:21.117 --> 00:47:23.247
You wanna give that thing a lot of air,
okay?

735
00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.117
There you go.
Give it some good pump.

736
00:47:25.288 --> 00:47:27.851
You want it to really fly.
You want it to blast off.

737
00:47:28.024 --> 00:47:31.521
Yeah, there you go.
No, no, no. You want to point that up.

738
00:47:31.695 --> 00:47:34.963
No. No, no, son. What are you-?
No, no, no. Don't push that button.

739
00:47:38.268 --> 00:47:41.468
Okay, so now, what you wanna do
is you wanna wind that baby up...

740
00:47:41.638 --> 00:47:43.666
...and you throw it
as hard as you can, okay?

741
00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:45.434
- Okay.
- All right. Come on.

742
00:47:49.446 --> 00:47:51.883
Look at that. Yeah.

743
00:47:52.916 --> 00:47:55.717
Yeah. Look at that sucker.

744
00:47:58.221 --> 00:47:59.554
Where'd it go?

745
00:48:09.499 --> 00:48:11.298
The ducks teach you playfulness.

746
00:48:11.468 --> 00:48:14.167
Here, you can borrow this if you want.
He'd love it.

747
00:48:14.337 --> 00:48:16.364
Hey, Dad-For-A-Weekend.

748
00:48:17.007 --> 00:48:18.236
How's it going?

749
00:48:18.408 --> 00:48:21.346
I think they designed all the toys
to hit you in the nuts.

750
00:48:21.912 --> 00:48:23.312
Oh, yeah.

751
00:48:24.147 --> 00:48:25.137
Get off.

752
00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:28.481
Richard, I bet my son could
kick the crap out of both your kids...

753
00:48:28.652 --> 00:48:31.316
...blindfolded,
one hand tied behind his back.

754
00:48:31.488 --> 00:48:34.950
Come on, Greg.
Nicholas is a sweet, sensitive kid.

755
00:48:35.125 --> 00:48:37.152
He's not a fighter.

756
00:48:37.327 --> 00:48:40.356
I'm telling you, Darryl, see, you gotta
be tough on kids nowadays.

757
00:48:40.531 --> 00:48:43.992
All right, the slightest bit of weakness
and they could end up...

758
00:48:46.436 --> 00:48:47.871
...like that.

759
00:48:48.038 --> 00:48:50.976
Well, I don't know about all that,
but I gotta be honest with you.

760
00:48:51.141 --> 00:48:54.204
I'm starting to dig this father thing.
It's kind of cool.

761
00:48:54.377 --> 00:48:58.112
It's kind of like I get to do all the things
that I never did with my dad.

762
00:48:58.281 --> 00:49:00.114
- You know?
- That's real cute.

763
00:49:00.651 --> 00:49:03.851
Really, I think I'm having
a positive influence on him.

764
00:49:05.355 --> 00:49:07.758
Cee-lo, that's right.
Dig up in your OshKosh...

765
00:49:07.925 --> 00:49:09.393
...your babyGap and pay the man.

766
00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.760
- That's right. Yeah.
- It's not fair.

767
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:14.593
Come on,
put your money in the pot.

768
00:49:14.765 --> 00:49:16.530
Whine to your mama,
don't whine to me.

769
00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.032
Right, good game, good game.

770
00:49:18.201 --> 00:49:19.693
Come here, you guys. Come here.

771
00:49:21.237 --> 00:49:23.401
Yo, y'all bring
your money tomorrow...

772
00:49:23.574 --> 00:49:26.443
...I'm gonna sell y'all some pictures
of some naked girls.

773
00:49:28.111 --> 00:49:30.776
What I say?
Y'all don't like big breasts?

774
00:49:30.948 --> 00:49:32.577
Daddy, can I have some ice cream?

775
00:49:32.749 --> 00:49:34.150
Sure, sweetie. What flavor?

776
00:49:34.317 --> 00:49:35.911
- Vanilla.
- You got it.

777
00:49:36.086 --> 00:49:37.555
- I think we'll go with you.
- Okay.

778
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:40.782
- You're getting big.
- Janet, do me a favor?

779
00:49:41.959 --> 00:49:44.327
- Could you watch Calvin for me?
- No problem.

780
00:49:45.395 --> 00:49:46.830
Calvin.

781
00:49:46.997 --> 00:49:48.260
Percy.

782
00:49:49.232 --> 00:49:52.672
- Cal, you get the diamond?
- Yeah, it's in the diaper bag. Come on.

783
00:49:52.836 --> 00:49:53.997
Hold hands.

784
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:56.699
Cal, which one is it?

785
00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:58.905
The one with the duck on it.

786
00:50:00.711 --> 00:50:04.343
- They all got ducks on them.
- I think it's that one.

787
00:50:04.848 --> 00:50:06.511
Come on.

788
00:50:07.283 --> 00:50:09.311
Hey, that guy's not even
here with a child.

789
00:50:09.486 --> 00:50:10.955
Hey.

790
00:50:12.288 --> 00:50:14.783
Hey, get away from him.
Girls, let's get him!

791
00:50:14.958 --> 00:50:17.451
- I'm out.
- There he is.

792
00:50:19.029 --> 00:50:21.261
Pumpkin, are you okay?

793
00:50:21.698 --> 00:50:23.327
- Did he touch you anywhere?
- No.

794
00:50:23.501 --> 00:50:25.664
No? Okay. Good.

795
00:50:25.836 --> 00:50:28.033
- Hey, is everything okay, Janet?
- It's not okay.

796
00:50:28.204 --> 00:50:30.870
Some sick pervert tried to run away
with this little guy.

797
00:50:31.041 --> 00:50:32.977
Hey, that psycho
took my diaper bag.

798
00:50:33.143 --> 00:50:35.204
- What?
- Damn.

799
00:50:36.379 --> 00:50:38.042
Pervert.

800
00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:43.319
Okay, we gonna get you home
where it's nice and safe, all right?

801
00:50:47.024 --> 00:50:49.723
Keys, keys. I want the keys.

802
00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.230
Keys, keys, I want keys.
Keys. Keys. Keys.

803
00:50:54.397 --> 00:50:56.527
No, no, no.
Daddy needs these to drive the-

804
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:58.225
- Keys.
- Oh, God.

805
00:50:58.401 --> 00:51:00.132
Keys. Give me the keys.

806
00:51:00.704 --> 00:51:03.300
- Oh, no. Here. Take that.
- No. Keys.

807
00:51:03.473 --> 00:51:05.375
- I want keys.
- Play with that for a while.

808
00:51:05.543 --> 00:51:07.877
- No, no, no. I need these.
- I want keys.

809
00:51:08.745 --> 00:51:10.146
- Want keys.
- Okay, here.

810
00:51:10.714 --> 00:51:13.344
- Keys.
- All right, all right.

811
00:51:13.517 --> 00:51:17.456
All right, you wait right there,
and I'll be right back, okay?

812
00:51:22.993 --> 00:51:24.656
Hey!

813
00:51:24.828 --> 00:51:26.262
My car. My kid.

814
00:51:27.565 --> 00:51:30.229
Hey, stop!

815
00:51:36.306 --> 00:51:38.333
Someone iust stole my car
with my kid in it.

816
00:51:38.509 --> 00:51:39.772
Hop in.

817
00:51:40.844 --> 00:51:43.212
- Thank you.
- Let's go get that son of a bitch.

818
00:51:53.624 --> 00:51:55.058
Damn.

819
00:52:07.104 --> 00:52:09.803
Man, my wife is gonna kill me
when she finds out about this.

820
00:52:09.973 --> 00:52:11.806
My advice to you
is don't tell her a word.

821
00:52:11.975 --> 00:52:13.808
I left Bobby Jr.
at an amusement park.

822
00:52:13.977 --> 00:52:16.447
Told his father he was at
summer camp. Bought me a week.

823
00:52:21.619 --> 00:52:24.682
Hello? I'm on my way.
I'll be there in about five minutes.

824
00:52:24.855 --> 00:52:27.291
I have the cupcakes. Yes.

825
00:52:27.457 --> 00:52:29.290
I didn't bring iuice.
You didn't tell me.

826
00:52:29.459 --> 00:52:32.056
- Don't talk to me that way.
- Excuse me.

827
00:52:32.696 --> 00:52:34.324
- I'm hanging up.
- Oh, my God.

828
00:52:34.497 --> 00:52:36.330
I'm hanging up. I'm hanging up.

829
00:52:37.968 --> 00:52:40.063
Watch the road, moron.

830
00:52:40.804 --> 00:52:43.138
Come on, baby. Let's go.
Let's do this.

831
00:52:51.114 --> 00:52:54.519
Oh, wow, you are really upset.

832
00:52:54.685 --> 00:52:58.351
It makes me feel so good to know that
there are people out there who care...

833
00:52:58.522 --> 00:53:00.617
- Mommy, Mommy...
- ... about their kids- What?

834
00:53:00.791 --> 00:53:01.781
as I do.

835
00:53:01.958 --> 00:53:03.895
- Mommy, Mommy.
- Just one second, honey.

836
00:53:04.061 --> 00:53:07.090
I'm fixing my makeup.

837
00:53:07.264 --> 00:53:09.427
- Mom.
- What?

838
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.832
I think Dillon did a doodie.

839
00:53:12.002 --> 00:53:14.701
- Mom, hurry up. Come on, hurry.
- Change him.

840
00:53:14.871 --> 00:53:17.810
Oh, wait, no. Wait.

841
00:53:19.276 --> 00:53:21.975
Oh, my God. Excuse me. A truck.

842
00:53:22.179 --> 00:53:24.514
Excuse me. A truck.

843
00:53:24.682 --> 00:53:26.652
There you go.
Can you hand me the powder?

844
00:53:26.817 --> 00:53:28.308
What? No, stop.

845
00:53:29.352 --> 00:53:30.946
We're gonna die.

846
00:53:37.795 --> 00:53:39.822
Oh, my God.

847
00:53:39.996 --> 00:53:42.194
Don't worry.
You'll get your little boy back.

848
00:53:42.365 --> 00:53:45.235
It ain't worth it. Let me out.

849
00:53:51.742 --> 00:53:53.005
Oh, no.

850
00:54:09.159 --> 00:54:12.256
- Suspect got away.
- Damn it!

851
00:54:13.163 --> 00:54:17.662
- But the kid's okay.
- I want my daddy.

852
00:54:19.035 --> 00:54:23.238
I want Daddy. I want my daddy.

853
00:54:23.406 --> 00:54:25.308
Thanks for everything.

854
00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:29.105
Oh, by the way, I run a carpool...

855
00:54:29.279 --> 00:54:32.274
...if the little one ever needs
a ride to preschool.

856
00:54:32.516 --> 00:54:34.280
- Daddy.
- That's my kid.

857
00:54:34.551 --> 00:54:36.749
Daddy. Daddy.

858
00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.359
- Are you okay, huh?
- Daddy.

859
00:54:40.658 --> 00:54:44.928
- Son's okay, but car's totaled.
- Screw the car. Long as he's okay.

860
00:54:45.095 --> 00:54:48.033
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry, little buddy.

861
00:54:48.198 --> 00:54:50.795
I would never want anything
to happen to you.

862
00:54:50.967 --> 00:54:52.835
I love you, man.

863
00:54:55.606 --> 00:54:57.199
- Mr. W.
- Yeah.

864
00:54:57.374 --> 00:55:00.312
Your boy came through. I got it.

865
00:55:02.613 --> 00:55:05.106
Bring it to me.
Watch my drink, babe.

866
00:55:20.496 --> 00:55:24.460
Keep looking. Keep digging in there.
It's in there. It's in there, baby.

867
00:55:25.468 --> 00:55:27.335
Look around in there.

868
00:55:28.371 --> 00:55:31.104
Mr. Dub,
could you dig deeper in there?

869
00:55:31.274 --> 00:55:32.573
Damn.

870
00:55:34.712 --> 00:55:36.476
Is that a dirty diaper?

871
00:55:37.748 --> 00:55:41.118
- Did I iust touch a dirty diaper?
- Wait a minute.

872
00:55:41.284 --> 00:55:43.551
Whoa, that baby had
lasagna last night.

873
00:55:43.721 --> 00:55:46.157
I know it's in here.
The diamond's in here.

874
00:55:46.323 --> 00:55:50.093
- He said the diamond's in there.
- Your 24 hours are up, Percy.

875
00:55:54.732 --> 00:55:56.759
And you haven't
delivered my diamond.

876
00:55:56.934 --> 00:55:59.097
Do you know
how that makes me feel?

877
00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:03.707
Please, Mr. Dub, give me a little
more time. I promise I'll get the rock.

878
00:56:03.874 --> 00:56:06.436
It makes me feel like
wanting to hurt you very badly.

879
00:56:06.977 --> 00:56:08.776
But I won't.

880
00:56:09.379 --> 00:56:12.511
Because that diamond
means more to me than your life.

881
00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:15.116
Now, you get out of here
and find me that diamond.

882
00:56:18.154 --> 00:56:21.754
- Get out of here.
- I promise you, okay? I got you.

883
00:56:23.093 --> 00:56:25.530
Follow him. Find his partner.

884
00:56:25.696 --> 00:56:29.226
Get me my diamond,
then stick them both in the ground.

885
00:56:29.833 --> 00:56:31.962
Aren't you taking this a bit far?

886
00:56:32.135 --> 00:56:34.663
I didn't even know they made
a LoJack for kids.

887
00:56:34.838 --> 00:56:38.470
No, I'm telling you, I'm not taking
any chances. This guy's tricky.

888
00:56:38.642 --> 00:56:40.008
Maybe I should skip the game.

889
00:56:40.176 --> 00:56:44.242
Are you crazy?
They're playing Detroit, D.

890
00:56:44.815 --> 00:56:48.687
Why don't we pack up the little ugly
son of a bitch and take him with us?

891
00:56:51.688 --> 00:56:53.556
You really think
that's the best idea?

892
00:56:53.724 --> 00:56:56.058
Yeah, Richard,
I do think it's the best idea.

893
00:56:56.226 --> 00:56:58.561
It's never too early
to become a Chicago fan.

894
00:57:00.497 --> 00:57:03.766
- You know what, I'm in.
- Yeah. Come on, let's go.

895
00:57:03.934 --> 00:57:07.498
Okay, but when the ladies ask,
I was the one that said no.

896
00:57:07.671 --> 00:57:08.900
I- No.

897
00:57:15.278 --> 00:57:17.749
Are you ready to see how exciting
a hockey game is?

898
00:57:17.915 --> 00:57:19.213
It's like boxing on ice.

899
00:57:19.382 --> 00:57:21.876
Five rows up behind the penalty box.
Who the man?

900
00:57:22.052 --> 00:57:23.544
- Yeah, boy. Yeah.
- That's right.

901
00:57:28.258 --> 00:57:31.025
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

902
00:57:31.695 --> 00:57:34.633
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, what are you watching?

903
00:57:37.334 --> 00:57:39.099
Did you see that play? Hey.

904
00:57:39.269 --> 00:57:41.364
What you got in your mouth there,
little fella?

905
00:57:42.072 --> 00:57:45.442
What you got in your mouth?
Open up. Open. Let me see.

906
00:57:46.176 --> 00:57:48.112
Oh, okay, it was nothing.

907
00:57:48.278 --> 00:57:50.214
Come on.

908
00:57:52.516 --> 00:57:53.506
T Man!

909
00:57:53.684 --> 00:57:55.654
- Come on.
- Here we go.

910
00:57:56.252 --> 00:57:57.517
Yeah.

911
00:58:00.156 --> 00:58:01.717
Yeah.

912
00:58:05.863 --> 00:58:08.459
- All right, who needs drinks?
- I'm good.

913
00:58:08.632 --> 00:58:14.337
Oh, wait. Yeah,
I guess I need another one, please.

914
00:58:16.073 --> 00:58:17.302
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

915
00:58:17.541 --> 00:58:20.034
How about you guys?
Anything to drink?

916
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:23.011
- Yeah, I'll grab a beer, sure.
- Me too, me too. Get me one.

917
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.174
- There you go.
- Thank you.

918
00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:29.880
- Okay. Here you go.
- Nice ass.

919
00:58:32.656 --> 00:58:34.022
Pig.

920
00:58:35.191 --> 00:58:36.923
Tramp.

921
00:58:47.771 --> 00:58:51.210
What the hell was that for?

922
00:58:51.742 --> 00:58:53.609
- What did I do?
- You know her?

923
00:58:53.777 --> 00:58:55.211
No, I don't know her.

924
00:58:56.479 --> 00:58:57.778
I don't know- I don't.

925
00:58:57.948 --> 00:58:59.645
- Hey, man. Get your own.
- Hey.

926
00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:01.544
- What?
- Beer. It's empty.

927
00:59:01.718 --> 00:59:04.121
- So get another one.
- I'm gonna-

928
00:59:04.287 --> 00:59:06.382
- Get off. Wait.
- What's your problem, man?

929
00:59:07.457 --> 00:59:09.792
- Come on, man. Come on, Miller.
- Miller.

930
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:14.800
You suck.

931
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.200
- You suck, man. You suck.
- Shut it, you losers!

932
00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:23.342
Want some of me? Come down here.
Come play with the big boys.

933
00:59:23.507 --> 00:59:26.741
- You're a bully. You're a bully, man.
- Yeah, I thought so, you princess.

934
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:29.711
- Come on, you.
- Pick on somebody your own size.

935
00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.873
Come on down here, then.

936
00:59:35.485 --> 00:59:37.182
Who did that?

937
00:59:39.856 --> 00:59:42.522
You. You're dead!

938
00:59:45.428 --> 00:59:46.897
He's gonna kill me.

939
00:59:48.098 --> 00:59:50.865
- Get out of my way.
- It wasn't me. It was the baby.

940
00:59:51.034 --> 00:59:52.503
- You're mine.
- Get him.

941
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:54.104
Hockey fight!

942
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:03.439
He's got my ear.
Get this baby off of me.

943
01:00:07.951 --> 01:00:11.857
- Hey. Hey, hey.
- Is that all you got?

944
01:00:15.993 --> 01:00:17.461
I don't know, baby.

945
01:00:17.628 --> 01:00:20.497
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm not ready to be a dad yet.

946
01:00:20.664 --> 01:00:23.328
It really wasn't your fault.

947
01:00:23.634 --> 01:00:25.695
It's so funny, man.
It just happened so fast.

948
01:00:25.869 --> 01:00:27.736
I took my eyes off him
for one second and:

949
01:00:27.904 --> 01:00:29.966
He would've never had
another birthday again.

950
01:00:32.308 --> 01:00:35.247
Hey. Why don't we do that?

951
01:00:35.411 --> 01:00:37.143
Why don't we throw him
a birthday party?

952
01:00:37.313 --> 01:00:39.785
Well, we don't know
when his birthday is.

953
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.579
So what?
We'll celebrate it tomorrow.

954
01:00:41.752 --> 01:00:45.282
We'll throw him a big birthday bash.
The biggest birthday party he ever had.

955
01:00:45.455 --> 01:00:47.425
That is a really good idea.

956
01:00:47.791 --> 01:00:51.731
And I got a little surprise for him.

957
01:00:51.895 --> 01:00:53.956
Does everyone know
what time it is?

958
01:00:54.131 --> 01:00:58.971
It's time to dance and sing,
and have lots and lots of fun.

959
01:00:59.136 --> 01:01:01.801
Hey there, boys and girls,
it's Dinosaur Rex...

960
01:01:01.972 --> 01:01:03.999
...your favorite prehistoric pal.

961
01:01:04.174 --> 01:01:06.269
Now, where's the birthday boy?

962
01:01:06.442 --> 01:01:07.969
- There.
- Yo, no, no.

963
01:01:08.211 --> 01:01:10.340
- Happy birthday.
- Hey, yo.

964
01:01:10.514 --> 01:01:11.812
Happy birthday, little buddy

965
01:01:11.982 --> 01:01:13.177
I got a nasty hangover...

966
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:15.115
...and a rock stuck in my gut...

967
01:01:15.285 --> 01:01:17.688
...that got my colon backed up
like rush-hour traffic.

968
01:01:17.854 --> 01:01:20.451
Now, either you're gonna stop
with your fruity kid songs...

969
01:01:20.624 --> 01:01:22.992
...or I'm gonna kick you
right in your furry balls.

970
01:01:23.527 --> 01:01:25.462
- All right?
- Well...

971
01:01:25.629 --> 01:01:27.826
...maybe we should talk
about manners.

972
01:01:27.998 --> 01:01:29.934
Now, manners are very important.

973
01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:34.040
When I was a tiny lizard, my mom
told me that if I had good manners...

974
01:01:34.204 --> 01:01:38.873
...one day I could grow up to be
president of the whole United States.

975
01:01:39.042 --> 01:01:41.410
But instead, you entertain
snotty-nosed kids...

976
01:01:41.579 --> 01:01:43.241
...in a crusty, blue dinosaur suit...

977
01:01:43.413 --> 01:01:46.750
...that smell like sweaty armpits
and baby urine.

978
01:01:48.018 --> 01:01:49.486
Far cry from president, buddy.

979
01:01:53.489 --> 01:01:55.654
I iust got out of rehab.

980
01:01:55.826 --> 01:01:57.989
Because of the new
"deadbeat dad" law...

981
01:01:58.161 --> 01:02:02.124
...my wife's garnishing 85 percent
of my dinosaur wages.

982
01:02:02.299 --> 01:02:06.205
So if I weren't afraid to lose this iob,
I'd kick your ass.

983
01:02:06.369 --> 01:02:09.638
Oh, you so pathetic you need
$4.50 an hour that bad?

984
01:02:09.807 --> 01:02:11.640
Come on, get your ass kicked.

985
01:02:15.646 --> 01:02:17.741
- Bring it on.
- Come on. Come on, then.

986
01:02:18.816 --> 01:02:21.913
- Hey.
- Oh, you mine now. You mine.

987
01:02:23.654 --> 01:02:26.022
Get him, get him, get him.

988
01:02:29.359 --> 01:02:31.022
You little bastard.

989
01:02:33.597 --> 01:02:35.931
That was a cheap shot.

990
01:02:37.934 --> 01:02:41.271
- You stink.
- I hate your show.

991
01:02:41.437 --> 01:02:44.103
It has been confirmed,
the driver of the stolen vehicle...

992
01:02:44.274 --> 01:02:47.805
...matches the description of
the suspect in Friday's diamond heist.

993
01:02:47.978 --> 01:02:50.346
- Police are looking to question...
- I knew it.

994
01:02:50.514 --> 01:02:52.005
...Calvin "Baby Face" Sims.

995
01:02:52.182 --> 01:02:55.587
Sims, who was recently released from
state prison, has thus far eluded-

996
01:02:55.753 --> 01:02:57.950
Hey, guys, what do you say
we liven this party up?

997
01:02:58.121 --> 01:02:59.954
We have a little
father-son football game.

998
01:03:00.123 --> 01:03:03.118
Football? Greg, I don't know.
I don't think that's a good idea.

999
01:03:03.293 --> 01:03:06.026
Nicholas is a little young
and small for football.

1000
01:03:06.196 --> 01:03:08.724
How about Simon Says instead?

1001
01:03:08.965 --> 01:03:11.733
You know, Richard, your son
practically squats to pee.

1002
01:03:12.302 --> 01:03:15.069
Come on, man.
Look, we gotta scar these kids for life.

1003
01:03:15.238 --> 01:03:17.071
All right?
We gotta toughen them up a bit.

1004
01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.641
You don't-

1005
01:03:19.276 --> 01:03:20.266
- Come on.
- Come on.

1006
01:03:20.443 --> 01:03:22.710
Darryl, you in,
or does Calvin have ballet class?

1007
01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.973
I'm down.

1008
01:03:24.447 --> 01:03:26.110
- All right.
- All right, let's do it.

1009
01:03:29.085 --> 01:03:32.058
Football? That's not in the books.
I've read all the books.

1010
01:03:32.222 --> 01:03:34.750
Yeah, you're wetting yourself here.
Go play football.

1011
01:03:34.925 --> 01:03:36.554
- You sure?
- Rich, let's go.

1012
01:03:36.727 --> 01:03:40.393
- It's 7-O already.
- All right. I'm playing football.

1013
01:03:40.564 --> 01:03:42.625
Take off the sli- Oh, my God.

1014
01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.032
Whoa, here we go.

1015
01:03:45.202 --> 01:03:48.299
P- U-T-I-T-I-N
Put it in

1016
01:03:48.505 --> 01:03:51.672
P- U-T-I-T-I-N
Put it in

1017
01:03:53.043 --> 01:03:56.642
You and me, this is father-son stuff.
Right here, huh? Here we go.

1018
01:03:56.814 --> 01:04:00.275
- Ready, set...
- I love you, baby.

1019
01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.113
Hike.

1020
01:04:02.285 --> 01:04:04.346
One Victoria's Secret. Two-

1021
01:04:05.522 --> 01:04:07.082
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

1022
01:04:07.257 --> 01:04:09.626
You want the hospital
or the graveyard, punk?

1023
01:04:10.126 --> 01:04:11.288
Yeah.

1024
01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:13.260
- Here we go.
- Are you okay?

1025
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:16.266
- I thought this was a touch game.
- You have his license number?

1026
01:04:16.433 --> 01:04:18.836
- What is he doing?
- Sorry, D, did I hurt your vagina?

1027
01:04:19.002 --> 01:04:22.908
Our team is what? Dynamite
Our team is what? Dynamite

1028
01:04:23.073 --> 01:04:24.872
- What's going on?
- Our team is

1029
01:04:26.076 --> 01:04:27.101
Dynamite

1030
01:04:27.277 --> 01:04:28.438
Break.

1031
01:04:30.814 --> 01:04:32.613
Run, Dad.

1032
01:04:35.786 --> 01:04:37.448
Nicholas, are you okay?

1033
01:04:37.621 --> 01:04:39.487
Game on.

1034
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:42.992
- Just stay down, son.
- Thattaboy. You did it.

1035
01:04:43.594 --> 01:04:46.360
Now, that's why we put creatine
in our corn flakes.

1036
01:04:46.997 --> 01:04:49.297
- You okay?
- Punch him, kick him

1037
01:04:49.466 --> 01:04:51.903
Stick him in the eye

1038
01:04:53.403 --> 01:04:55.396
Here we go, here we go.

1039
01:04:55.572 --> 01:04:57.702
All right, here we go.
Come on, boys.

1040
01:05:03.547 --> 01:05:06.678
- Yeah.
- Your husband is a brute.

1041
01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:08.478
- That's right.
- Yo, Greg, man.

1042
01:05:08.652 --> 01:05:10.314
You should be ashamed of yourself!

1043
01:05:10.487 --> 01:05:12.890
Hey, what are you doing, Greg?
Man, he's a kid.

1044
01:05:13.056 --> 01:05:15.857
Hey, Darryl, Darryl.
Shut your pie-hole, man!

1045
01:05:16.026 --> 01:05:18.759
- It's football. It's football.
- I know.

1046
01:05:18.929 --> 01:05:21.331
- Stop acting like a bitch.
- Why you starting, man?

1047
01:05:21.498 --> 01:05:24.733
Come on, let's go. Man, come on.
You guys suck.

1048
01:05:25.135 --> 01:05:27.264
It's time to kick some butt. Come on.

1049
01:05:28.005 --> 01:05:32.378
Ready, set, hike.

1050
01:05:34.812 --> 01:05:37.545
- I got him.
- Nicholas, block left. Come on.

1051
01:05:40.383 --> 01:05:42.786
- Tommy.
- How do you like them apples?

1052
01:05:42.953 --> 01:05:45.754
- Get him.
- Yeah, come on.

1053
01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:50.090
- Yeah.
- Yes. Yes.

1054
01:05:53.697 --> 01:05:57.569
Tommy, what's going on?
You call that a tackle?

1055
01:05:58.035 --> 01:05:59.732
Told you,
you gotta stay in the zone.

1056
01:05:59.903 --> 01:06:02.465
You gotta eat some lightning
and crap thunder, son.

1057
01:06:02.639 --> 01:06:05.406
You wanna get up?
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1058
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:10.878
- Come on. Come on, man.
- Shut up, Darryl. It's my son.

1059
01:06:11.748 --> 01:06:16.383
All right, it's do-or-die time.
Last point wins.

1060
01:06:17.253 --> 01:06:19.725
Nicholas, you ready?

1061
01:06:20.824 --> 01:06:24.764
Purple Haze. Purple Haze 15.

1062
01:06:25.095 --> 01:06:29.297
Ready, set, hike.

1063
01:06:30.501 --> 01:06:31.730
Follow me.

1064
01:06:33.837 --> 01:06:35.932
- Go, Nicholas. Go, Nicholas.
- Come on, come on.

1065
01:06:36.907 --> 01:06:38.466
- Bring it on.
- Go. Go.

1066
01:06:41.011 --> 01:06:43.345
- Go. Oh, my goodness.
- Come on, get up.

1067
01:06:44.515 --> 01:06:46.508
Go, Nicholas. Go, Nicholas.
Go, Nicholas.

1068
01:06:46.683 --> 01:06:49.246
- Come on.
- Tommy, hurry.

1069
01:06:49.419 --> 01:06:52.790
This team is dynamite
We're dynamite

1070
01:06:54.024 --> 01:06:57.896
- That's my son.
- That is my boy. That is my boy.

1071
01:06:58.061 --> 01:07:00.999
You did it, son.
You crapped thunder.

1072
01:07:01.164 --> 01:07:03.795
Nine months inside. Yes.

1073
01:07:04.367 --> 01:07:05.802
Dad, Dad.

1074
01:07:06.503 --> 01:07:09.704
- Yeah, son?
- You suck.

1075
01:07:10.306 --> 01:07:12.106
Son, Dad hurt his pee-pee.

1076
01:07:12.275 --> 01:07:13.972
- Get up, you pussy.
- I can't.

1077
01:07:18.148 --> 01:07:21.143
All right, everybody, here she comes.
Everybody, on three.

1078
01:07:21.484 --> 01:07:23.887
One, two, three.

1079
01:07:28.759 --> 01:07:30.455
They trying to punk me.

1080
01:07:32.596 --> 01:07:35.625
All these people trying
to make a fool out of me.

1081
01:07:35.799 --> 01:07:37.358
Trying to make me cry.

1082
01:07:37.635 --> 01:07:42.634
I didn't cry when I went to prison,
and I ain't gonna cry now.

1083
01:07:42.806 --> 01:07:47.578
I don't care if I never had a mother
who threw me a party.

1084
01:07:48.245 --> 01:07:53.278
Today is my birthday
and I'm gonna smile, damn it.

1085
01:07:57.087 --> 01:07:58.784
I wish I had a family.

1086
01:07:58.956 --> 01:08:02.919
Well done, baby. What is this, Dad?

1087
01:08:03.093 --> 01:08:06.065
I got a gift for the kid.
I know I've been a little tough on him.

1088
01:08:06.229 --> 01:08:09.224
But it ain't easy when I've been
the center of all the attention...

1089
01:08:09.399 --> 01:08:11.893
...and all of a sudden,
a kid walk in the house. A baby.

1090
01:08:12.068 --> 01:08:15.531
I want you to know now,
from now on, I'm here to help.

1091
01:08:16.239 --> 01:08:19.804
Now, Calvin, make a wish.

1092
01:08:19.977 --> 01:08:25.113
And I hope all of your wishes
come true.

1093
01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.520
Oh, great, you're here.

1094
01:08:38.762 --> 01:08:41.130
The bouncy's in the back.
Just go around the side.

1095
01:08:41.298 --> 01:08:42.767
No, I'm here to get my son.

1096
01:08:44.367 --> 01:08:46.064
Little dude. Little man.

1097
01:08:46.369 --> 01:08:47.998
- Son?
- That's right.

1098
01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:51.234
I didn't think I could do it,
but I got myself together, baby.

1099
01:08:51.407 --> 01:08:54.575
So if you iust give me the boy,
we're gonna slide out of here.

1100
01:08:54.745 --> 01:08:58.411
So you're the guy
who left his baby on my doorstep...

1101
01:08:58.582 --> 01:09:01.417
- ... in a dog basket?
- That's right, but that was a mistake.

1102
01:09:01.585 --> 01:09:03.417
The guy who gave
his own kid a tattoo?

1103
01:09:03.587 --> 01:09:06.114
Wait. I can explain that.
His mother was in the service.

1104
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:10.024
The person responsible for allowing
his baby boy to take a knife in the gut?

1105
01:09:10.193 --> 01:09:11.822
Wait. The boy needed discipline.

1106
01:09:11.995 --> 01:09:13.589
- You should be castrated.
- What?

1107
01:09:13.764 --> 01:09:15.631
Ain't nothing wrong
with my bowel movement.

1108
01:09:15.799 --> 01:09:18.429
I go two, three times a day.
Let me tell you something.

1109
01:09:18.602 --> 01:09:20.595
I ain't got to explain nothing.
I'm a grown-

1110
01:09:20.771 --> 01:09:24.073
You iust caught yourself the official
Brooklyn beat-down, homes.

1111
01:09:24.241 --> 01:09:26.404
You iust entered the dragon,
homeboy.

1112
01:09:26.577 --> 01:09:28.877
Word up. I'm gonna tap you
right on your Flintstone.

1113
01:09:29.046 --> 01:09:31.779
Here it come, homeboy.
Here it come, homeboy. Here it-

1114
01:09:36.419 --> 01:09:38.116
Who is Mike Jones?

1115
01:09:39.923 --> 01:09:41.984
Get the hell out of here.
And don't come back.

1116
01:09:44.961 --> 01:09:46.898
I want my mother.

1117
01:09:47.865 --> 01:09:51.497
Looks like Percy's partner
decided to keep the rock for himself.

1118
01:09:51.668 --> 01:09:54.539
- Better go tell Mr. Walken.
- Yeah.

1119
01:09:54.805 --> 01:09:58.677
There you go. Good.

1120
01:09:59.342 --> 01:10:00.811
- Come on.
- Honestly, Janet...

1121
01:10:00.977 --> 01:10:02.378
...I don't know how you do it.

1122
01:10:02.546 --> 01:10:04.709
- What's that, sweetie?
- All of this.

1123
01:10:04.882 --> 01:10:07.114
The parenting, the responsibility.

1124
01:10:07.284 --> 01:10:09.585
It's really no different
than any other career.

1125
01:10:10.287 --> 01:10:13.556
I mean, you have scheduling, you
have planning. Budgeting, of course.

1126
01:10:13.724 --> 01:10:16.354
I guess the big difference
is that my boss...

1127
01:10:16.527 --> 01:10:18.690
...I want to slather in kisses
all day long.

1128
01:10:19.062 --> 01:10:22.057
And I can, without being sued
for sexual harassment.

1129
01:10:23.867 --> 01:10:26.064
And you don't miss the iob at all?

1130
01:10:26.236 --> 01:10:29.072
You know,
sometimes I think I miss it...

1131
01:10:29.239 --> 01:10:31.710
...but then I remember
all they really liked about me...

1132
01:10:31.875 --> 01:10:33.708
...was the money
that I made for them.

1133
01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:39.119
You know? I mean, this...
This is real. These guys dig me.

1134
01:10:39.282 --> 01:10:43.382
I am a diva, a giant, a goddess.

1135
01:10:43.554 --> 01:10:46.024
I'm perfect. Aren't I perfect?

1136
01:10:48.692 --> 01:10:50.719
Mommy, I don't feel good.

1137
01:10:50.894 --> 01:10:53.194
What's the matter, honey?
You got a tummy ache?

1138
01:10:53.363 --> 01:10:56.928
Yeah? Think maybe it's from
eating 16 pieces of cake...

1139
01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:58.626
...and beef ierky...

1140
01:10:58.802 --> 01:11:01.068
...and a balloon? Yeah.

1141
01:11:02.806 --> 01:11:06.712
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1142
01:11:06.877 --> 01:11:08.368
Just a little teaspoon of this-

1143
01:11:08.545 --> 01:11:09.775
It is magic.

1144
01:11:09.947 --> 01:11:13.751
and he will poop very shortly.

1145
01:11:14.384 --> 01:11:16.047
It'll slide right out.

1146
01:11:18.054 --> 01:11:19.114
Good boy.

1147
01:11:19.523 --> 01:11:21.458
Well, maybe you should
take him home.

1148
01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:23.253
Yes, maybe we shall.

1149
01:11:23.426 --> 01:11:26.398
- You wanna go home?
- And you too. Yeah.

1150
01:11:27.731 --> 01:11:29.928
Oh, goodness,
what do you feed this kid?

1151
01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.535
What do I feed you?

1152
01:11:31.702 --> 01:11:33.638
- All right. I'll see you soon?
- Okay.

1153
01:11:33.804 --> 01:11:35.603
- Thank you.
- See you later. Come on, hon.

1154
01:11:35.772 --> 01:11:39.007
Such a good boy,
helping your mom.

1155
01:12:01.198 --> 01:12:03.761
Oh, sweetie. Wha-?

1156
01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.836
Oh, honey, what's wrong? Sweetie?

1157
01:12:08.005 --> 01:12:11.102
- Hey, little man, what's the matter?
- I don't think he's feeling well.

1158
01:12:11.274 --> 01:12:13.073
Are you okay?

1159
01:12:16.413 --> 01:12:19.044
What's the matter,
you gotta make a poo-poos?

1160
01:12:20.383 --> 01:12:23.823
You gotta make a poo-poo.
He gotta make a little poo-poo, yeah.

1161
01:12:26.724 --> 01:12:28.124
God.

1162
01:12:28.692 --> 01:12:30.855
What's going on, man, huh?

1163
01:12:44.808 --> 01:12:47.837
Ain't that cute.
He made a little surprise...

1164
01:12:48.011 --> 01:12:49.411
...for Mommy.

1165
01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:50.843
- Mom-? For me?
- Go ahead.

1166
01:12:51.014 --> 01:12:54.214
- Mommy take care.
- Darryl, why me? I did it last time.

1167
01:12:54.384 --> 01:12:56.286
Wash your hands
before you make dinner.

1168
01:12:56.453 --> 01:12:58.252
Come on, Calvin.

1169
01:12:59.056 --> 01:13:00.183
Come on.

1170
01:13:07.965 --> 01:13:09.901
Man, what a day.

1171
01:13:12.035 --> 01:13:14.598
- I can't believe you did this.
- Did what?

1172
01:13:14.772 --> 01:13:18.176
- This. Darryl, it's so beautiful.
- I did- I-

1173
01:13:18.341 --> 01:13:20.676
It's so romantic,
the way you put it in his diaper.

1174
01:13:20.844 --> 01:13:23.975
Then you made me change him
even though I didn't want to. Oh, so-

1175
01:13:24.715 --> 01:13:26.912
- No, but, honey-
- We should go out and celebrate.

1176
01:13:27.084 --> 01:13:28.713
- Somewhere nice? I'll change.
- Wait.

1177
01:13:28.885 --> 01:13:31.413
Thank you, baby.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

1178
01:13:31.589 --> 01:13:34.857
- I love it, I love it, I love it.
- I gotta talk to you.

1179
01:13:35.025 --> 01:13:36.858
- Baby, come here.
- Damn.

1180
01:13:40.196 --> 01:13:41.928
Are you sure you guys
are gonna be okay?

1181
01:13:42.099 --> 01:13:46.062
- We'll be fine, won't we, little boy?
- I love Papa.

1182
01:13:46.236 --> 01:13:47.865
- All right. Bye.
- Okay.

1183
01:13:48.038 --> 01:13:50.270
Y'all have a good time, now.
I know we will.

1184
01:13:52.543 --> 01:13:54.239
Bye-bye.

1185
01:13:54.745 --> 01:13:58.913
We going to have a good time.
He's a nice little boy too. Yes, indeedy.

1186
01:13:59.082 --> 01:14:02.020
He's a cute little boy too.
Look at the little baby.

1187
01:14:02.185 --> 01:14:05.920
Yeah, he's a good little boy.
One, two, three.

1188
01:14:08.125 --> 01:14:10.459
Now, you come clean,
you little punk. Who are you?

1189
01:14:10.628 --> 01:14:13.360
Where you from? What you all about?
What is all this?

1190
01:14:16.933 --> 01:14:19.929
Look here, old man.
You been a real pain in my butt.

1191
01:14:20.103 --> 01:14:22.471
And you're right,
I did rob that jewelry store.

1192
01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.612
And now there's some
real bad people after me.

1193
01:14:25.776 --> 01:14:27.939
And the people you love
are gonna get hurt...

1194
01:14:28.111 --> 01:14:29.580
...if I don't get that diamond.

1195
01:14:29.746 --> 01:14:34.313
And I don't want that to happen,
so you better just stay out of my way.

1196
01:14:40.323 --> 01:14:42.988
Hey, yo, Percy, it's me.
Be here in a hour.

1197
01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.791
- I'll have the diamond then.
- How can you do this to us?

1198
01:14:46.396 --> 01:14:48.560
We took you in,
thought you were a child in need.

1199
01:14:48.732 --> 01:14:52.296
- You turn out to be a lowlife thief.
- Look, I didn't mean for it to go this far.

1200
01:14:52.468 --> 01:14:54.565
I was iust trying
to get my diamond and be out.

1201
01:14:54.738 --> 01:14:58.803
- You ain't getting away with it.
- Then it's time to dance. Come on.

1202
01:15:00.043 --> 01:15:01.808
- Baby, I-
- Sweetheart...

1203
01:15:01.978 --> 01:15:04.006
...this means so much to me.

1204
01:15:04.181 --> 01:15:06.276
I know it's not real.
Look at the size of this.

1205
01:15:06.449 --> 01:15:08.442
There's no way
you could afford that, but...

1206
01:15:08.652 --> 01:15:13.150
Well, it's what the ring symbolizes
that makes it so special to me.

1207
01:15:13.323 --> 01:15:15.988
- Yeah, about that, baby. I didn't-
- Please. Let me finish.

1208
01:15:16.159 --> 01:15:20.327
Please. I know that you are
not the one who isn't ready. It's me.

1209
01:15:20.496 --> 01:15:23.094
I have always needed
for everything to fit my schedule.

1210
01:15:23.266 --> 01:15:26.637
And you have shown me that
sometimes life doesn't work that way.

1211
01:15:26.803 --> 01:15:30.676
It's unpredictable, and sometimes
you have to go with the flow and...

1212
01:15:30.841 --> 01:15:32.834
I'll never be ready
until it just happens.

1213
01:15:33.009 --> 01:15:36.312
- Vanessa, I iust wanna tell you-
- I think that we should just do it.

1214
01:15:37.347 --> 01:15:38.976
Do what?

1215
01:15:39.216 --> 01:15:40.515
Let's adopt him.

1216
01:15:40.684 --> 01:15:43.177
Tomorrow let's take the baby
to Child Services...

1217
01:15:43.353 --> 01:15:44.652
...and start the paperwork.

1218
01:15:44.821 --> 01:15:46.381
You mean we can keep him?

1219
01:15:46.557 --> 01:15:48.458
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1220
01:15:49.727 --> 01:15:51.663
So, what did you wanna tell me?

1221
01:15:53.964 --> 01:15:54.954
Nothing.

1222
01:15:55.132 --> 01:15:56.965
Nothing at all. Let's- Let's toast.

1223
01:15:57.467 --> 01:15:59.096
Okay.

1224
01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.370
You don't mess
with a man from Detroit.

1225
01:16:04.541 --> 01:16:05.703
I'm from Detroit.

1226
01:16:05.876 --> 01:16:08.073
The hell you doing?

1227
01:16:08.245 --> 01:16:10.147
- What's going on?
- Daddy, get off of him.

1228
01:16:10.313 --> 01:16:12.340
- Get off of the baby.
- Stop it.

1229
01:16:12.516 --> 01:16:14.007
Ain't no baby. That's a criminal.

1230
01:16:14.184 --> 01:16:17.350
I have had it with you.
I'm calling Whispering Glen.

1231
01:16:17.521 --> 01:16:18.784
Vanessa, I ain't crazy.

1232
01:16:18.956 --> 01:16:21.689
You see, I know what is
and I know what ain't is.

1233
01:16:21.858 --> 01:16:24.022
And he ain't is what he say he is.

1234
01:16:24.194 --> 01:16:26.391
You see, "is" is and "ain'ts" ain't.

1235
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:28.527
Check the teddy bear.
The teddy bear.

1236
01:16:28.699 --> 01:16:30.167
Teddy bear knows.

1237
01:16:30.333 --> 01:16:33.032
- Come on, then. Please.
- We'll take good care of your father.

1238
01:16:33.203 --> 01:16:35.264
Whispering Glen is a safe facility.

1239
01:16:35.438 --> 01:16:37.499
Give him
a couple of days to adjust...

1240
01:16:37.675 --> 01:16:40.009
- Let me go.
- ... and then come visit.

1241
01:16:48.084 --> 01:16:52.116
Vanessa, believe me.
"Is" is, "ain'ts" ain't.

1242
01:16:52.289 --> 01:16:54.259
Use the Taser if you have to.

1243
01:16:54.424 --> 01:16:55.893
Check the teddy bear.

1244
01:16:56.059 --> 01:16:57.551
The teddy bear.

1245
01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:01.597
I'm gonna go put him to bed.

1246
01:17:02.199 --> 01:17:03.725
Yeah.

1247
01:17:12.209 --> 01:17:13.199
Man.

1248
01:17:14.211 --> 01:17:17.582
How does one child turn a household
upside down in a weekend?

1249
01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:21.044
Look at this place. It's a mess.

1250
01:17:36.132 --> 01:17:38.000
Check the teddy bear.
The teddy bear.

1251
01:17:38.168 --> 01:17:39.694
Teddy bear knows.

1252
01:17:42.072 --> 01:17:43.632
Grandpa bad.

1253
01:17:43.807 --> 01:17:46.437
No. No, baby. No, no, no.

1254
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:49.103
Papa's not bad.
He didn't mean to hurt you. He just-

1255
01:17:49.847 --> 01:17:52.944
He's a little... Yeah.

1256
01:18:19.976 --> 01:18:22.676
Wow, look here, old man.
You've been a real pain in the butt.

1257
01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:25.613
And you're right,
I did rob that jewelry store.

1258
01:18:25.783 --> 01:18:28.379
And now there's
a lot of bad people a_er me.

1259
01:18:28.552 --> 01:18:30.145
People you love
are gonna get hurt...

1260
01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.880
...if I don't get the diamond back.

1261
01:18:32.055 --> 01:18:33.318
Vanessa.

1262
01:18:33.489 --> 01:18:34.652
Vanessa.

1263
01:18:35.358 --> 01:18:37.921
- Where's Calvin?
- I put him in the cr-

1264
01:18:38.095 --> 01:18:40.327
- Where's the diamond?
- It was-

1265
01:18:41.164 --> 01:18:43.361
- Gone.
- Damn. Pops was right.

1266
01:18:43.534 --> 01:18:46.403
- I'm calling the police.
- I'm gonna get my dad.

1267
01:18:48.105 --> 01:18:49.232
Dad!

1268
01:18:49.406 --> 01:18:51.775
Yes, I have some information
on a stolen diamond.

1269
01:18:52.576 --> 01:18:54.101
That's what I'm talking about.

1270
01:18:54.277 --> 01:18:56.110
We did it. We rich, baby.

1271
01:18:58.014 --> 01:19:01.215
- Yes. Just in the nick of time.
- We blinging.

1272
01:19:01.384 --> 01:19:03.354
Walken and his goons
is going to that house.

1273
01:19:03.754 --> 01:19:04.983
- What?
- Don't worry.

1274
01:19:05.155 --> 01:19:07.125
He thinks Darryl's my partner.

1275
01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:10.194
You idiot. Walken will kill him
if he don't have his diamond.

1276
01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.595
Exactly. Which means
he won't be coming after you.

1277
01:19:13.764 --> 01:19:17.203
It's perfect. We get away scot-free.

1278
01:19:19.402 --> 01:19:20.962
This is the time you hit me, right?

1279
01:19:24.307 --> 01:19:25.833
Let me pull over.

1280
01:19:28.846 --> 01:19:32.148
Don't start beating me
like I'm a R & B singer, man.

1281
01:19:33.784 --> 01:19:36.881
Police is here. Hey.

1282
01:19:38.021 --> 01:19:40.048
Hey. Can I help you?

1283
01:19:40.223 --> 01:19:42.193
Is this the guy that
double-crossed Percy?

1284
01:19:42.359 --> 01:19:43.589
Yeah, that's the guy, boss.

1285
01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.961
I don't know anybody named Percy.
You must got the wrong guy.

1286
01:19:47.263 --> 01:19:49.735
- Cut the crap. I want my diamond.
- I don't have it.

1287
01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:52.531
Too bad. I guess we're gonna
have to beat it out of you.

1288
01:19:52.703 --> 01:19:55.435
I iust called the police.
And they're on their way over here.

1289
01:19:55.806 --> 01:19:58.072
Really? That doesn't leave us
much time then.

1290
01:19:59.242 --> 01:20:01.907
- Take him.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait, guys.

1291
01:20:03.547 --> 01:20:04.708
Dada?

1292
01:20:07.484 --> 01:20:09.113
Dada.

1293
01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:11.079
Who's this little guy?

1294
01:20:12.389 --> 01:20:13.949
That's my son.

1295
01:20:16.593 --> 01:20:17.619
Take him upstairs.

1296
01:20:19.563 --> 01:20:21.999
- I wanna talk to you.
- Cute kid.

1297
01:20:22.165 --> 01:20:24.796
It's- Just- I don't have-
Listen. That's my nipple.

1298
01:20:29.806 --> 01:20:30.934
Time to take a nap.

1299
01:20:31.107 --> 01:20:32.702
Night-night?

1300
01:20:32.876 --> 01:20:35.814
And don't worry about any loud noises
you may hear downstairs.

1301
01:20:35.979 --> 01:20:38.245
It's iust us beating up your daddy.

1302
01:20:40.417 --> 01:20:42.011
Here you are.

1303
01:20:45.155 --> 01:20:47.318
Nighty-night.

1304
01:21:23.527 --> 01:21:24.859
Click.

1305
01:21:30.166 --> 01:21:32.730
Now tell me, where's my diamond?

1306
01:21:32.903 --> 01:21:34.201
I told you, I don't have it.

1307
01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:36.307
You don't tell me
where my diamond is...

1308
01:21:36.473 --> 01:21:40.106
...that cute little baby of yours
is gonna get hurt.

1309
01:21:46.517 --> 01:21:49.079
Moron, get the kid. Get the kid.

1310
01:21:50.788 --> 01:21:52.017
I want him.

1311
01:21:57.828 --> 01:21:59.296
There you are, little buddy.

1312
01:22:00.564 --> 01:22:01.964
Come on.

1313
01:22:02.132 --> 01:22:03.464
Come to Uncle Rosco.

1314
01:22:12.408 --> 01:22:14.038
Okay. Play nicey-nicey.

1315
01:22:43.907 --> 01:22:45.774
Okay, get your ass up.

1316
01:22:45.942 --> 01:22:48.915
Yeah, get up. I got you now.

1317
01:22:49.079 --> 01:22:50.605
Yeah. Yeah.

1318
01:22:51.447 --> 01:22:52.712
Ain't so tough now, are you?

1319
01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:58.883
Back up. Or I'll shoot you.

1320
01:22:59.289 --> 01:23:01.156
Shoot me, tough guy. Come on.

1321
01:23:03.827 --> 01:23:04.988
Oh, boy.

1322
01:23:05.162 --> 01:23:06.563
I'm surrounded by morons.

1323
01:23:07.064 --> 01:23:08.931
Here. You dropped your gun, sir.

1324
01:23:09.099 --> 01:23:11.570
Here you go. It's all yours.

1325
01:23:11.735 --> 01:23:13.602
- What are you gonna do?
- Wait, wait, I-

1326
01:23:13.770 --> 01:23:16.538
Come on, get out of here. Come on.

1327
01:23:20.977 --> 01:23:22.003
All right, dude.

1328
01:23:22.179 --> 01:23:26.644
You busted my Sergio da Vincis,
$62.50 designer frames.

1329
01:23:26.817 --> 01:23:29.812
Not cool. Not cool.

1330
01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.516
Okay, buddy.

1331
01:23:31.689 --> 01:23:34.091
We can either do this the easy way
or the hard way.

1332
01:23:34.925 --> 01:23:38.364
I think I like it the hard way.

1333
01:23:47.771 --> 01:23:49.262
Did we get him?

1334
01:23:49.973 --> 01:23:51.202
He's yours, man.

1335
01:23:59.482 --> 01:24:00.472
Dude...

1336
01:24:01.685 --> 01:24:03.552
...you iust woke the dragon up.

1337
01:24:03.721 --> 01:24:05.383
Prepare for pain.

1338
01:24:05.556 --> 01:24:08.356
It's time for the dragon
to go back to sleep.

1339
01:24:20.370 --> 01:24:22.169
What are you doing?

1340
01:24:24.508 --> 01:24:27.411
- Stop.
- You going down, Sasquatch.

1341
01:24:27.578 --> 01:24:29.376
Better not.

1342
01:24:48.932 --> 01:24:50.457
What the hell is going on here?

1343
01:24:50.634 --> 01:24:52.159
That ain't no baby.

1344
01:24:52.335 --> 01:24:53.531
- Who else is here?
- Nobody.

1345
01:24:53.704 --> 01:24:56.072
- Who's here?
- Nobody, I swear.

1346
01:24:56.239 --> 01:24:57.833
Come on.

1347
01:24:58.008 --> 01:25:00.342
Inside. Inside.

1348
01:25:01.578 --> 01:25:02.808
There's the little monster.

1349
01:25:03.413 --> 01:25:05.383
Listen, what does he got there?

1350
01:25:05.749 --> 01:25:08.242
- It's an airplane.
- Tell him to get rid of the plane.

1351
01:25:09.586 --> 01:25:10.646
Get rid of it.

1352
01:25:11.922 --> 01:25:14.188
Calvin, throw the plane.

1353
01:25:24.301 --> 01:25:25.291
What are you doing?

1354
01:25:31.608 --> 01:25:33.237
Don't move.

1355
01:25:34.512 --> 01:25:36.174
Save it, tough guy.

1356
01:25:36.346 --> 01:25:38.475
You're not gonna shoot me.

1357
01:25:39.049 --> 01:25:40.278
But I will.

1358
01:25:42.118 --> 01:25:43.246
Freeze! Police!

1359
01:25:43.419 --> 01:25:44.855
Freeze! Police!

1360
01:25:45.022 --> 01:25:47.015
I got this. You check the house.

1361
01:25:48.158 --> 01:25:51.096
Black cops, come with me.
White lady, you stay here.

1362
01:25:51.294 --> 01:25:53.321
I'm telling you, guys,
that ain't no baby.

1363
01:25:53.496 --> 01:25:55.729
He's the mastermind
behind the whole thing.

1364
01:25:55.899 --> 01:25:57.424
Get him out of here.

1365
01:25:57.601 --> 01:26:00.163
He's a stone-cold killer, that kid.

1366
01:26:01.572 --> 01:26:03.063
Would you get this thing off me?

1367
01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.645
Relax. Where you're going,
you might want to keep that on.

1368
01:26:07.210 --> 01:26:08.975
I don't wanna go to iail.

1369
01:26:09.145 --> 01:26:11.241
It's too dark. There's no TV.

1370
01:26:16.219 --> 01:26:17.916
Hey, where you going, little guy?

1371
01:26:21.358 --> 01:26:23.157
Ain't this your kid?

1372
01:26:23.326 --> 01:26:24.351
Dada?

1373
01:26:25.863 --> 01:26:25.863
Yeah, that's my son.

1374
01:26:28.098 --> 01:26:29.795
Now, Calvin...

1375
01:26:29.933 --> 01:26:32.199
...don't you have something
for the nice policeman?

1376
01:26:33.837 --> 01:26:35.704
- No.
- Come on.

1377
01:26:35.873 --> 01:26:38.811
You don't wanna go to prison
with the rest of the bad men, do you?

1378
01:26:44.548 --> 01:26:45.641
There we go.

1379
01:26:45.816 --> 01:26:47.877
Hey, the diamond.

1380
01:26:48.051 --> 01:26:50.818
Thanks, kid. Now your dad's
gonna get a big reward.

1381
01:26:50.987 --> 01:26:53.322
- A reward?
- Yeah, the insurance company...

1382
01:26:53.489 --> 01:26:56.189
...offered $ 1 OO,OOO
to whoever found the diamond.

1383
01:26:56.359 --> 01:26:57.953
A hundred thousand dollars?

1384
01:26:58.562 --> 01:27:00.030
God, that's gonna come in handy.

1385
01:27:00.196 --> 01:27:01.723
Shoot, I could get my car fixed...

1386
01:27:01.899 --> 01:27:03.630
...get a new wedding ring
for my wife...

1387
01:27:03.801 --> 01:27:07.137
...I could take a vacation,
buy a TV set-

1388
01:27:07.605 --> 01:27:09.507
And if there's
any change left over...

1389
01:27:09.673 --> 01:27:12.577
...I'll give a little something
to my son.

1390
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:15.575
Right. Well, we'll be in touch.

1391
01:27:25.923 --> 01:27:27.050
So...

1392
01:27:27.324 --> 01:27:30.125
Oh, come on.
Let's not get all mushy about this.

1393
01:27:30.293 --> 01:27:33.265
Let's iust shake hands
and part ways like men.

1394
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:35.366
All right? No hard feelings?

1395
01:27:35.766 --> 01:27:38.168
- Nah, no hard feelings.
- All right.

1396
01:27:38.335 --> 01:27:41.205
Besides, it was kind of cool
having a son for a minute.

1397
01:27:41.371 --> 01:27:44.366
See? There you go
with all that sentimental stuff.

1398
01:27:45.241 --> 01:27:46.836
If that's the game you wanna play...

1399
01:27:47.010 --> 01:27:49.914
...I guess it was cool
having you as a fa-

1400
01:27:50.313 --> 01:27:51.474
Oh, boy.

1401
01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:55.714
What I'm trying to say is,
I've never really had a daddy.

1402
01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.818
I guess what I'm saying is...

1403
01:27:57.988 --> 01:28:00.151
...you're gonna make a great father,
all right?

1404
01:28:00.323 --> 01:28:02.054
There, I said it. Are you happy now?

1405
01:28:03.493 --> 01:28:05.326
Now, I'm gonna walk out
that back door...

1406
01:28:05.495 --> 01:28:09.265
...and you ain't gonna
see me no more. Ever.

1407
01:28:10.266 --> 01:28:12.032
- But-
- Oh, it hurts.

1408
01:28:12.202 --> 01:28:14.035
- We-
- I know.

1409
01:28:14.204 --> 01:28:15.696
We'll never see each other again.

1410
01:28:15.873 --> 01:28:18.173
- But we-
- Maybe that's for the best.

1411
01:28:18.341 --> 01:28:19.503
You'll start a family...

1412
01:28:19.677 --> 01:28:22.581
...and you won't need
a lowlife criminal like...

1413
01:28:22.746 --> 01:28:24.579
...Calvin Sims around anymore.

1414
01:28:24.748 --> 01:28:28.278
Actually what I was gonna say is,
we don't have a back door.

1415
01:28:28.451 --> 01:28:30.786
Okay, well, then I'll go out the front.

1416
01:28:31.689 --> 01:28:34.216
- Fine.
- Well...

1417
01:28:34.825 --> 01:28:39.232
I'll be out of your lives for good,
never to return again.

1418
01:28:39.796 --> 01:28:41.390
Cool.

1419
01:28:45.002 --> 01:28:46.402
So long.

1420
01:28:46.570 --> 01:28:50.100
Farewell. Oh, God.

1421
01:28:53.176 --> 01:28:56.513
Aren't you gonna miss me?
Just a little bit?

1422
01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:00.175
- See you around, buddy.
- No?

1423
01:29:00.751 --> 01:29:01.946
Take care.

1424
01:29:02.452 --> 01:29:04.081
Goodbye.

1425
01:29:04.254 --> 01:29:09.458
It's so hard to say goodbye

1426
01:29:23.807 --> 01:29:25.936
Why?

1427
01:29:26.744 --> 01:29:30.844
Nobody loves Calvin.

1428
01:29:31.014 --> 01:29:33.007
Because I'm short.

1429
01:29:34.017 --> 01:29:37.114
- They think I'm ugly.
- Hey, little man.

1430
01:29:38.021 --> 01:29:39.718
Wanna share a glass of milk?

1431
01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:52.501
Enough of all this girlie stuff.
This ain't Brokeback Mountain.

1432
01:29:53.637 --> 01:29:56.199
Hey, how about we put a little
bit of liquor in that milk?

1433
01:29:56.372 --> 01:29:58.172
Forget that. Let's go to a bar.

1434
01:29:58.341 --> 01:29:59.503
All right. Bet.

1435
01:29:59.676 --> 01:30:02.170
- Are you over 21?
- And then some.

1436
01:30:02.378 --> 01:30:03.905
All right.

1437
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:08.278
Hey, I know this great strip club.

1438
01:30:08.719 --> 01:30:10.655
Don't say that loud.
My wife might get mad.

1439
01:30:10.821 --> 01:30:12.586
- Oh, sorry.
- Got change of a hundred?

1440
01:30:12.756 --> 01:30:15.056
- No, we steal it from Pops.
- All right. All singles.

1441
01:30:28.506 --> 01:30:31.238
You a cute little fellow.
Yes, you are.

1442
01:30:31.407 --> 01:30:34.175
Take after your mama.
You got a lot of grandpoppy in you too.

1443
01:30:34.344 --> 01:30:38.581
Yes, you do, little boy.
Look at the little boy.

1444
01:30:39.016 --> 01:30:40.747
Where's the bottle?
The kid is starving.

1445
01:30:40.917 --> 01:30:43.252
I'm coming. I'm coming. Old grouch.

1446
01:30:43.987 --> 01:30:45.285
Here he comes, little boy.

1447
01:30:45.455 --> 01:30:49.988
Don't worry.
We gonna get you some milk. Yeah.

1448
01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.593
That little guy's so cute...

1449
01:30:52.763 --> 01:30:54.960
...it's making me go soft.

1450
01:30:55.132 --> 01:30:57.466
He look iust like his daddy.

1451
01:31:00.037 --> 01:31:02.531
Howdy-do, little boy.

1452
01:37:49.229 --> 01:37:50.356
So...

1453
01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:53.431
Oh, come on.
Let's not get all mushy about this.

1454
01:37:53.601 --> 01:37:56.573
Let's iust shake hands
and part ways like men.

1455
01:37:56.737 --> 01:37:58.673
All right? No hard feelings?

1456
01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:25.361
There, I said it. Are you happy now?

1457
01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.633
Now, I'm gonna walk out
that back door...

1458
01:38:28.802 --> 01:38:32.572
...and you ain't gonna
see me no more. Ever.
