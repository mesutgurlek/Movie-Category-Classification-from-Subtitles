1
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:13,790
Watch that line, now.
Watch that line.

2
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:17,190
<i>- Po Lazarus</i>
<i>- Po Lazarus !</i>

3
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:20,190
<i>Po Lazarus...</i>

4
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:25,390
<i>Well, the high sheriff,
he told the deputy</i>

5
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:32,590
<i>Won't you go out
and bring me Lazarus ?</i>

6
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:38,190
<i>Well, the high sheriff,
he told the deputy</i>

7
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:45,990
<i>Won't you go out
and bring me Lazarus ?</i>

8
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:49,390
<i>Oh, bring him dead or alive</i>

9
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:51,190
<i>O Lord</i>

10
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:55,890
<i>Bring him dead or alive</i>

11
00:01:56,792 --> 00:02:01,590
<i>Well, the deputy,
he told the high sheriff</i>

12
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:08,390
<i>Well, I ain't gonna mess
with Lazarus</i>

13
00:02:09,492 --> 00:02:13,390
<i>Well, the deputy,
he told the high sheriff</i>

14
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:19,890
<i>Said I ain't gonna mess
with Lazarus...</i>

15
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:24,590
- Pick up that hammer, boy.
- Yes, sir, boss.

16
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:28,190
<i>Well, he's a dangerous man</i>

17
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:35,190
<i>O Lord, he's a dangerous man...</i>

18
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:39,890
Go on, hit it ! Go !

19
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:52,390
<i>One evening as the sun went down</i>

20
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:54,890
<i>And the jungle fire was burning</i>

21
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:57,490
<i>Down the track came a hobo hikin'</i>

22
00:02:57,692 --> 00:02:59,990
<i>And he said, boys, I'm not turning</i>

23
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:02,890
<i>I'm headed for a land
that's far away</i>

24
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:05,290
<i>Beside the crystal fountains</i>

25
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:10,190
<i>So come with me, we'll go and see
the big rock candy mountains</i>

26
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:12,790
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

27
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,390
<i>There's a land
that's fair and bright</i>

28
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,790
<i>Where the handouts grow on bushes</i>

29
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:20,490
<i>And you sleep out every night</i>

30
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:22,990
<i>Where the boxcars all are empty</i>

31
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:24,790
<i>And the sun shines every day</i>

32
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:28,190
<i>On the birds and the bees
and the cigarette trees</i>

33
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,390
<i>The lemonade springs
where the bluebird sings</i>

34
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:34,090
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

35
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:36,490
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

36
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:38,990
<i>All the cops have wooden legs</i>

37
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:41,590
<i>And the bulldogs
all have rubber teeth</i>

38
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:44,090
<i>And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs</i>

39
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,490
<i>The farmers' trees
are full of fruit</i>

40
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:48,890
<i>And the barns are full of hay</i>

41
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:51,190
<i>Oh, I'm bound to go
where there ain't no snow</i>

42
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:53,590
<i>Where the rain don't fall,
the wind don't blow</i>

43
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:57,190
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

44
00:03:57,392 --> 00:03:59,690
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

45
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:01,890
<i>You never change your socks</i>

46
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:04,390
<i>And the little streams of alcohol</i>

47
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:06,690
<i>Come a-trickling down the rocks</i>

48
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:09,090
<i>The brakemen have to tip their hats</i>

49
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,390
<i>And the railroad bulls are blind</i>

50
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:13,890
<i>There's a lake of stew
and of whiskey, too</i>

51
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:16,190
<i>You can paddle all around 'em
in a big canoe</i>

52
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:20,090
<i>In the big rock
candy mountains...</i>

53
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:24,490
<i>The jails are made of tin</i>

54
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:26,690
<i>And you can walk right out again</i>

55
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,190
<i>As soon as you are in</i>

56
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:31,390
<i>There ain't no
short-handle shovels</i>

57
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:33,790
<i>No axes, saws or picks</i>

58
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:36,290
<i>I'm a-goin' to stay
where you sleep all day</i>

59
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:38,390
<i>Where they hung the jerk
that invented work</i>

60
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:42,390
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

61
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:49,990
<i>I'll see you all this comin' fall</i>

62
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:54,090
<i>In the big rock candy mountains</i>

63
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:29,790
Say,

64
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:33,390
any of you boys smithies ?

65
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:37,890
Or if not smithies,
trained in the metallurgic arts,

66
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:42,790
before circumstances forced you
into a life of wanderin' ?

67
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:54,390
Jesus ! Can't I count on you people ?

68
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:56,290
Sorry, Everett.

69
00:05:56,492 --> 00:06:01,090
Well, all right.
If we take off through that bayou...

70
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,590
Wait a minute !

71
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,190
Who elected you leader
of this outfit ?

72
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:09,190
I figured it should be the one with
the capacity for abstract thought,

73
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:12,390
but if that ain't the consensus,
then hell, let's vote.

74
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:14,990
Suits me !
I'm votin' for yours truly.

75
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,990
Well, I'm votin'
for yours truly, too.

76
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:25,490
OK. I'm with you fellas.

77
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:51,390
Mind if we join you, old-timer ?

78
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:56,590
Join me, m'son. Join me.

79
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:00,790
You work
for the railroad, grandpa ?

80
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:03,190
I work for no man.

81
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:07,290
- Got a name, do you ?
- I have no name.

82
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:11,590
That may be why you had difficulty
finding gainful employment.

83
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,590
Y'see, in the mart
of competitive commerce...

84
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,590
You seek a great fortune,

85
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:19,190
you three who are now in chains.

86
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:21,990
You will find a fortune,

87
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:25,490
though it will not be
the fortune you seek.

88
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:27,790
But first...

89
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:33,590
first you must travel
a long and difficult road,

90
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:38,390
a road fraught with peril, mm-hmm.

91
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,590
You shall see things...

92
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,890
wonderful to tell.

93
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:47,390
You shall see a... a cow...

94
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:51,990
on the roof of a cotton house, ha.

95
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:56,390
And, oh, so many startlements.

96
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:59,590
I cannot tell you how long
this road shall be,

97
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:02,890
but fear not the obstacles
in your path,

98
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,390
for fate has...

99
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,690
vouchsafed your reward.

100
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:10,590
Though the road may wind,

101
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,290
yea, your hearts grow weary,

102
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:16,190
still shall ye follow them,

103
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:21,090
even unto your salvation.

104
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:36,090
No, the treasure's
still there, believe me.

105
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:38,590
But how'd he know about it ?

106
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:42,590
I don't know, Delmar. The blind
reputedly possess sensitivities

107
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,590
compensating for lack of sight,

108
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:47,390
to the point of developing
psychic powers.

109
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:50,990
Clearly, seeing the future
falls into that category.

110
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:55,090
It's not so surprising, then,
that one lacking earthly vision...

111
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:58,190
He said we wouldn't get
the treasure we seek,

112
00:08:58,392 --> 00:08:59,990
on account of our obstacles.

113
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:02,890
What the hell
does an ignorant old man know ?

114
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:05,790
Jesus, Pete. I told you
I buried it myself.

115
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,990
If your cousin still has this farm

116
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:11,390
and shoein' impedimenta
to restore liberty of movement...

117
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,490
Hold it right there !

118
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:18,290
You men from the bank ?

119
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:19,990
You Wash's boy ?

120
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:23,790
Yes, sir. Daddy told me to shoot
who's ever from the bank.

121
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:26,390
We ain't from the bank, young fella.

122
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:29,890
Yes, sir. I'm supposed to shoot folks
servin' papers.

123
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:33,590
- We ain't got no papers, neither.
- I nicked the census man.

124
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,890
Now, there's a good boy.

125
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:38,190
Is... is your daddy about ?

126
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:51,790
Hello, Pete.

127
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,990
Who are your friends ?

128
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,990
Pleased to make
your acquaintance, Mr Hogwallop.

129
00:09:57,192 --> 00:10:02,190
- My name's Ulysses Everett McGill...
- I'm Delmar O'Donnel.

130
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:03,990
How you been, Wash ?

131
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:06,990
Been what, 12, 13 years ?

132
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,790
Yeah...

133
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:15,590
I expect you want
them chains knocked off.

134
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:18,390
They foreclosed
on cousin Bishop.

135
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:21,390
He hanged hisself a year come May.

136
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:23,390
And Uncle Radcliffe ?

137
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:25,790
The anthrax
took most of his cows.

138
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,590
The rest don't milk.

139
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,490
He lost a boy to mumps.

140
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:34,390
Where's Cora, Cousin Wash ?

141
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:40,790
Couldn't say.

142
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:46,890
Mrs Hogwallop up and R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

143
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:50,090
She must have been
lookin' for answers.

144
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:53,490
Possibly. Good riddance,
as far as I'm concerned.

145
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:56,490
I do miss
her cooking, though.

146
00:10:56,692 --> 00:11:00,390
- This stew's awful good.
- Think so ?

147
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:03,190
I slaughtered this horse
last Tuesday.

148
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:07,890
I'm afraid
she's startin' to turn.

149
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:13,890
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

150
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:16,890
<i>My only sunshine</i>

151
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:18,790
<i>You make me happy</i>

152
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:21,290
<i>When skies are grey</i>

153
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:23,890
<i>You'll never know, dear</i>

154
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,590
<i>How much I love you</i>

155
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:31,390
<i>Please don't take
my sunshine away</i>

156
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:36,490
<i>That winds up the Pass The
Biscuits Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour.</i>

157
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:37,990
<i>This is Pappy O'Daniel</i>

158
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,990
<i>hopin' you been enjoyin'
that old-timey music.</i>

159
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:43,090
<i>And remember,</i>

160
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:46,590
<i>when you're fixing to
bake a mess of biscuits,</i>

161
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:48,590
<i>use cool, clear water</i>

162
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,790
<i>and good, pure,
Pappy O'Daniel flour.</i>

163
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:58,090
Well, guess I'll be turnin' in.
Say, uh, cousin Wash,

164
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,390
I suppose it'd be
the acme of foolishness

165
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:02,390
to ask if you had a hair net.

166
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:05,290
We got a bunch in yon bureau.

167
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,790
Mrs Hogwallop's, matter of fact.

168
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:12,390
Help yourself.
I won't be needing 'em.

169
00:12:12,592 --> 00:12:14,190
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

170
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:17,590
<i>My only sunshine</i>

171
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:20,190
<i>You make me happy</i>

172
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:21,890
<i>When skies are grey...</i>

173
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:24,190
All right, boys !

174
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:27,190
How's my hair ?

175
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:31,590
It's the authorities !
We got you surrounded.

176
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:33,690
Damn, we're in a tight spot.

177
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:36,790
Just come on out
and grab at air !

178
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:39,390
And don't try nothin' fancy.

179
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,990
Your situation
is pretty nigh hopeless.

180
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:45,790
- Damn ! We're in a tight spot !
- What in the Sam Hill... ?

181
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:47,690
Pete's cousin turned us in.

182
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:48,990
What the hell you sayin' ?!

183
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:50,990
Wash is kin !

184
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:52,290
Sorry, Pete !

185
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:55,990
I know we're kin,
but they got this depression on.

186
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,890
I got to do for me and mine.

187
00:12:58,092 --> 00:13:02,190
I'm gonna kill you,
Judas Iscariot Hogwallop !

188
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:06,590
You miserable,
horse-eatin' son of a...

189
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:08,390
Damn ! We're in a tight spot !

190
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,190
Damn his eyes !

191
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:14,090
Pa always said,
"Never trust a Hogwallop".

192
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,690
Come and get us, coppers !

193
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:21,590
You leave us no choice
but to smoke you out.

194
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:23,490
We're in a tight spot.

195
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:24,690
Light her up !

196
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:28,090
Hold up !
Ain't you ever heard of negotiatin' ?

197
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,590
We could talk this thing out.
I hate fire !

198
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:35,390
You lousy, yella-bellied...
Pete, we need one voice.

199
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:39,090
Careful with that fire !

200
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:41,590
Light the loft, son.

201
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,990
Aah ! I hate fire !

202
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:48,190
Gapped-toothed, carpetbaggin',
motherless spawn of hell !

203
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:51,090
Step back. Damn it. Look out.

204
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:52,990
Holy Saint Christopher !

205
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:55,590
Get away from that,
she's liquid fire !

206
00:13:57,192 --> 00:14:01,190
Take cover, boys ! It ain't popcorn !

207
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:13,290
Scatter, boys !

208
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:17,190
God damn it !

209
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,390
Get in, boys !

210
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:23,990
I'm gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-T !

211
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:27,790
Come on, boys, come on ! Come on !

212
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:31,990
What are you doing here ? You ought
to be in bed, clump snatcher.

213
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:35,190
You ain't the boss of me !

214
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:44,890
You candy-butted,
car-thievin' sos-and-sos !

215
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:47,090
I curse your name !

216
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:49,990
Go back home and mind your pa !

217
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,990
What's the damn problem ?

218
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:00,990
I can get the part from Bristol
in two weeks. Your pomade.

219
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:03,990
Two weeks ?
That don't do me no good.

220
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:06,590
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.

221
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:09,990
Hold on. I don't want this pomade,
I want Dapper Dan.

222
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,990
I don't carry Dapper Dan.
I carry Fop.

223
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:16,590
I don't want Fop, god damn it !
I'm a Dapper Dan man !

224
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,290
Watch your language,
this is a public market.

225
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:23,790
Now, if you want Dapper Dan,
I can have it in a coupla weeks.

226
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:27,390
Ain't this a geographical oddity !
Two weeks from everywhere.

227
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,390
Forget it.

228
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:33,290
Just a dozen hair nets.

229
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,090
Well, didn't look
like a one-horse town,

230
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:38,590
but try finding
a decent hair jelly.

231
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:42,790
- Gopher, Everett ?
- No transmission belt for two weeks.

232
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:45,590
Huh ? They dam that river on the 21st.

233
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:48,090
- Today is the 17th.
- Don't I know it.

234
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,790
We got but four days
to get to that treasure.

235
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:53,790
After that, it'll be
at the bottom of a lake.

236
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:55,790
We won't make it walkin'.

237
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:57,990
- Right...
- Gopher ?

238
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:00,390
But the old tactician's got a plan.

239
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:04,390
For the transportation,
not keeping my coiffure in order.

240
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:07,590
How's this a plan ?
How we gonna get a car ?

241
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:12,090
Sell that. I figure you can only have
painful association for Wash.

242
00:16:12,392 --> 00:16:16,690
"To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop,

243
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,290
from his lovin' Cora."

244
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:23,690
- "Amor fidel... is."
- It was in his bureau,

245
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:27,090
I reckon it'll fetch us enough
for a good auto voiture

246
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:28,990
and a little leftover besides.

247
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:31,590
Whoo ! You got light fingers, Everett.

248
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:35,390
- Gopher ?
- You miserable little snake.

249
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,390
You stole from my kin !

250
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:39,990
Who was fixin' to betray us.

251
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,190
You didn't know that at the time.

252
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:44,390
So I borrowed it till I did know.

253
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:46,490
That don't make no sense !

254
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:49,390
A fool seeks logic
in the chambers of the heart.

255
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:53,990
What the hell is that singing ?

256
00:16:55,392 --> 00:17:00,790
Appears to be some kind
of a... congregation.

257
00:17:00,992 --> 00:17:04,490
Care for some gopher ?

258
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,990
No, thank you, Delmar.

259
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:10,990
A third of a gopher'd
only arouse my appetite

260
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:13,490
without beddin' her back down.

261
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,890
Oh, you can have the whole thing.

262
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:18,890
Me and Pete already had one.

263
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:27,590
We ran across
a whole... gopher... village.

264
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:33,690
<i>O brothers, let's go down</i>

265
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:37,490
<i>Let's go down, come on down</i>

266
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:40,990
<i>Come on, brothers, let's go down</i>

267
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:45,190
<i>Down in the river to pray</i>

268
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:49,090
<i>As I went down
in the river to pray</i>

269
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:52,090
<i>Studyin' about that good old way</i>

270
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:55,590
<i>And who shall wear
the starry crown</i>

271
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:59,990
<i>Good Lord, show me the way</i>

272
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:03,590
<i>O fathers, let's go down</i>

273
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:07,290
<i>Let's go down, come on down</i>

274
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:10,690
<i>O fathers, let's go down</i>

275
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:14,990
<i>Down in the river to pray</i>

276
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:18,990
<i>As I went down
in the river to pray</i>

277
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:22,190
<i>Studying about that good old way</i>

278
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,590
<i>And who shall wear
the robe and crown</i>

279
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:30,290
<i>Good lord, show me the way</i>

280
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:33,790
<i>O mothers, let's go down</i>

281
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:37,190
<i>Come on down,
don't you wanna go down ?</i>

282
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:40,990
<i>Come on, mothers,
let's go down...</i>

283
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:44,190
Well, I guess hard times
flush the chumps.

284
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:46,390
Everybody's lookin' for answers.

285
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,790
Where the hell's he going ?

286
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:55,790
The Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

287
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:59,790
<i>Good Lord, show me the way</i>

288
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:04,290
<i>O sinners, let's go down...</i>

289
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:06,790
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

290
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:08,890
Delmar's been saved.

291
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:11,990
Well, that's it, boys.
I been redeemed.

292
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:16,290
The preacher done washed away
all my sins and transgressions.

293
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:19,190
It's the straight and narrow
from here on out.

294
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,890
And heaven everlasting's
my reward.

295
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:25,190
Delmar, what are you on about ?
We got bigger fish to fry.

296
00:19:25,392 --> 00:19:28,290
The preacher said
all my sins is washed away,

297
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:31,390
including that Piggly Wiggly
I knocked over in Yazoo.

298
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:33,590
You said you was innocent of that.

299
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,990
Well, I was lyin'.

300
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:39,790
And the preacher said that
that sin's been washed away, too.

301
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:43,190
Neither God nor man's
got nothin' on me now.

302
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:48,190
Come on in, boys.
The water is fine.

303
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,590
Come on, boy.
There, boy. Good doggy.

304
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:02,690
All right, boys, we got the scent.

305
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:08,790
- The preacher said it absolved us.
- For Him, not for the law.

306
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:11,590
I gave you credit for
more brains than Delmar.

307
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:15,690
- But witnesses seen us redeemed.
- That's not the issue, Delmar.

308
00:20:15,992 --> 00:20:19,090
Even square with the Lord,
Mississippi's hard-nosed.

309
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:22,590
You shoulda joined us, Everett.
It couldn'a hurt none.

310
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:26,090
Hell, it woulda washed away
the stink of that pomade.

311
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,790
Joining you fools in superstition ?
Thank you, anyway.

312
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:35,190
And I like the smell of my hair,
the pleasin' odour's half the point.

313
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,290
Baptism !

314
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:39,690
You two are
dumber than a bag of hammers.

315
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:41,790
You're my cross to bear.

316
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:46,690
Pull over, Everett. Let's give
that coloured boy a lift.

317
00:20:52,392 --> 00:20:54,690
You folks going past Tishomingo ?

318
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:57,690
Sure, hop in.

319
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:06,590
How you doin', son ? Name's Everett.

320
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:10,090
These two soggy sons of bitches
are Pete and Delmar.

321
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:13,990
Keep your fingers away from Pete's
mouth, he ain't eaten for 13 years,

322
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:16,390
'cept prison food and greasy horse.

323
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,390
Thanks for the lift, sir.
My name's Tommy. Tommy Johnson.

324
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,490
How you doin', Tommy ?

325
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:25,590
Say, I haven't seen a house
out here for miles.

326
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:28,290
Why are you
out in the middle of nowhere ?

327
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:31,090
I had to be at that crossroads
last midnight.

328
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:33,190
Sell my soul to the devil.

329
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,790
Ain't it a small world,
spiritually speakin' ?

330
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:39,990
Pete and Delmar just been saved.
I'm the only one still unaffiliated.

331
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:42,290
It's no laughin' matter.

332
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,290
What'd the devil give you for it ?

333
00:21:44,492 --> 00:21:47,790
Well, he taught me to play
this here guitar real good.

334
00:21:47,992 --> 00:21:52,090
Oh, son, for that you traded
your everlasting soul ?

335
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:53,790
Well, I wasn't usin' it.

336
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:57,990
I've always wondered,
what's the devil look like ?

337
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,590
Well, there are all manner
of lesser imps and demons,

338
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:05,290
but Satan hisself is red and scaly
with a bifurcated tail,

339
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:08,890
- and he carries a hayfork.
- Oh, no. No, sir.

340
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:12,390
He's white.
As white as you folks.

341
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:15,390
With empty eyes
and a big, hollow voice.

342
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:19,190
He travelled around
with a mean old hound, that's right.

343
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,290
He told you to go to Tishomingo ?

344
00:22:21,492 --> 00:22:24,190
Well, no, sir.
Why, that was my idea.

345
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:26,190
I heard there's a man there,

346
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:28,690
pays folks money
to sing into his can.

347
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:32,690
They say he pays extra
if'n you play real good.

348
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:34,690
Tishomingo, huh ?

349
00:22:34,892 --> 00:22:36,390
How much he pay ?

350
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:56,690
All right, boys, follow my lead.

351
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:02,890
Hello ?

352
00:23:03,192 --> 00:23:07,590
- Who's the honcho here ?
- I am. Who are you ?

353
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:12,090
Well, sir, I'm Jordan Rivers,
and these are the Soggy Bottom Boys,

354
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:14,190
out of Cottonillia, Mississippi.

355
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,690
Songs of salvation to salve the soul.

356
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,590
Uh, we hear that you pay good money
to sing into a can.

357
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:23,990
Well, that all depends.
You boys do Negro songs ?

358
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:28,890
Um... Well, uh, sir, we are Negroes.

359
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:32,990
All except for our accomp... accomp...
the fella that plays the guitar.

360
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:35,290
Yeah, well,
I don't record Negro songs.

361
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:38,790
No, I'm lookin' for
some old-timey material.

362
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:40,990
People can't seem to get enough

363
00:23:41,192 --> 00:23:44,490
since we started broadcasting it
on the Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour,

364
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:46,890
so thank you for stopping by, but...

365
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:51,790
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys have been
steeped in old-timey material.

366
00:23:51,992 --> 00:23:54,590
- Heck, we're silly with it.
- That's right.

367
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,790
Right. We ain't really Negroes.

368
00:23:57,092 --> 00:23:59,090
All except for our accompanist.

369
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:05,690
<i>I am a man</i>

370
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:08,590
<i>Of constant sorrow</i>

371
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:14,590
<i>I've seen trouble all my days</i>

372
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:18,990
<i>I bid farewell</i>

373
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,690
<i>To old Kentucky</i>

374
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:24,190
<i>The place where I</i>

375
00:24:24,392 --> 00:24:26,990
<i>Was born and raised</i>

376
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:29,890
<i>The place where he</i>

377
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:33,390
<i>Was born and raised</i>

378
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:37,790
<i>For six long years</i>

379
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:40,490
<i>I've been in trouble</i>

380
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:43,290
<i>No pleasure here</i>

381
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:46,790
<i>On Earth I found</i>

382
00:24:46,992 --> 00:24:51,090
<i>For in this world</i>

383
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,390
<i>I'm bound to ramble</i>

384
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,490
<i>I have no friends</i>

385
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:59,190
<i>To help me now</i>

386
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:01,890
<i>He has no friends</i>

387
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:05,490
<i>To help him now</i>

388
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,990
<i>Maybe your friends think</i>

389
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,690
<i>I'm just a stranger</i>

390
00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:15,290
<i>My face you never</i>

391
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:16,790
<i>Will see no more</i>

392
00:25:19,192 --> 00:25:23,790
<i>But there is one promise</i>

393
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:25,990
<i>That is given</i>

394
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,690
<i>I'll meet you on</i>

395
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:31,390
<i>God's golden shore</i>

396
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:34,190
<i>He'll meet you on</i>

397
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:39,190
<i>God's golden shore</i>

398
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:43,890
Whoo ! Hot damn, son !
You did sell your soul to the devil !

399
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:49,290
Boy, that was some mighty fine
a-pickin' and a-singin'.

400
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:50,790
I'll tell you what.

401
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:53,190
Ahem. You come on
in here, you...

402
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:57,690
you sign these papers here,
I'm gonna give you $10 apiece.

403
00:25:57,992 --> 00:26:03,890
Uh, OK, sir, but Mert and...
Aloysious'll have to sign x's.

404
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:07,990
- Only four of us can write.
- That'd be fine.

405
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:13,990
Hey, mister, I don't mean
to tell tales out of school,

406
00:26:14,192 --> 00:26:17,890
but there's a fella in there'll pay
you $10 if you sing into his can.

407
00:26:18,192 --> 00:26:21,090
I'm not hear to make a record,
you dumb cracker.

408
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:23,090
They broadcast me on the radio.

409
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:26,090
That's Governor Menelaus
"Pappy" O'Daniel.

410
00:26:26,392 --> 00:26:30,290
He'd sure like it if you ate his
farina and voted him a second term.

411
00:26:30,592 --> 00:26:33,090
- Finest in Mississippi.
- In any state.

412
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,490
Lord, yes. Every parish.

413
00:26:35,692 --> 00:26:38,390
Ain't you gonna
press the flesh, Pappy ?

414
00:26:38,592 --> 00:26:41,690
I'll press your flesh,
you dim-witted son'bitch.

415
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:45,590
Don't tell me how to court the
electorate. We ain't one-at-a-timin'.

416
00:26:45,892 --> 00:26:47,490
We're mass communicatin' !

417
00:26:47,692 --> 00:26:50,190
Oh, yes, that's a powerful new force.

418
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:51,790
Shake a leg, Junior.

419
00:26:51,992 --> 00:26:54,290
Thank God your mammy died
givin' birth,

420
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:55,990
she'd have died of shame.

421
00:26:56,192 --> 00:26:58,090
Well, hi there ! How you doin' ?

422
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:05,390
<i>Hard time yearnin'
where you go</i>

423
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:10,990
<i>Times is harder
than ever been before</i>

424
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:18,990
<i>And the people are driftin'</i>

425
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:21,590
<i>From door to door</i>

426
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:23,190
<i>Can't find no heaven</i>

427
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,590
<i>I don't care where they go</i>

428
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:39,190
<i>Say you had money</i>

429
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,790
<i>You better be sure</i>

430
00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:43,790
<i>These hard times will drive you</i>

431
00:27:43,992 --> 00:27:46,790
<i>From door to door</i>

432
00:27:58,092 --> 00:28:00,390
Let's bed down here for the night.

433
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:04,090
Yeah, it stinks in that old barn.

434
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:05,690
Suits me.

435
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:11,590
Pretty soon it'll be nothin' but
featherbeds and silk sheets.

436
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,290
A million dollars.

437
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:18,390
Million point two.

438
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:23,190
- 500,000 each.
- 400, Delmar.

439
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:29,790
Pete, what are you gonna do
with your share of the treasure ?

440
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:32,490
Go out west somewhere.

441
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:36,190
Open a fine restaurant.

442
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:39,590
I'm gonna be the maitre d'.

443
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:42,390
Greet all the swells.

444
00:28:42,592 --> 00:28:45,790
Go to work every day
in a bow tie,

445
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:47,990
tuxedo.

446
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:51,590
And all the staff
say "yes, sir" and...

447
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,090
"no, sir"...

448
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:56,590
and "in a jiffy, Pete".

449
00:28:56,892 --> 00:29:00,790
And all my meals for free.

450
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:05,390
What about you, Delmar,

451
00:29:05,592 --> 00:29:08,690
what are you gonna do
with your share of that dough ?

452
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,490
I'm gonna visit them
foreclosin' son of a guns

453
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:16,190
down at the Indianola
Savings and Loan.

454
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:22,190
Slap that money on the barrel head
and buy back the family farm.

455
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:26,790
You ain't no kind of man
if you ain't got land.

456
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:28,790
What about you, Everett ?

457
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:32,690
What you have in mind
when you stole it in the first place ?

458
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:38,990
Ahem. I... didn't have no plan.

459
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:41,990
Well, that hardly sounds like you.

460
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:45,390
All right, boys !
It's the authorities !

461
00:29:45,592 --> 00:29:48,090
Your situation
is purty nigh hopeless !

462
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:50,590
Damn, they found our car.

463
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,790
We ain't got the time
and nary the inclination

464
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,390
to chat with you boys any further.

465
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:58,690
Damn, we got to skedaddle.

466
00:29:58,892 --> 00:30:02,690
I left my pomade in the car.
Maybe I can creep up.

467
00:30:02,992 --> 00:30:07,090
Don't be a fool, Everett.
We got to R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

468
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:09,190
Where's Tommy ?

469
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:14,390
Already lit out,
scared out of his wits.

470
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:18,290
Let's go !

471
00:30:18,492 --> 00:30:20,390
Well, hell, it ain't square one.

472
00:30:20,592 --> 00:30:24,490
Ain't no one gonna pick up three
filthy, unshaved hitchhikers.

473
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:28,590
And one of them a know-it-all
who can't keep his trap shut.

474
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:32,890
The rancour reflected in that remark
I won't dignify with comment.

475
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:37,190
But I'll address your general
attitude of hopeless negativism.

476
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:40,090
Consider the lilies
of the goddam field.

477
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:43,190
Or, hell, look at Delmar
as your paradigm of hope.

478
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:44,990
Yeah. Look at me.

479
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:48,990
You may call it unreasoning optimism,
you may call it obtuse,

480
00:30:49,192 --> 00:30:52,290
but the plain and simple fact
is we got close to...

481
00:30:52,492 --> 00:30:54,990
three days before they...

482
00:30:59,592 --> 00:31:03,690
dam that river.

483
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:28,590
Is this the road to Itta Bena ?

484
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:31,390
Uh... Itta Bena ?

485
00:31:31,592 --> 00:31:35,790
Itta Bena ?
Stay on this here road.

486
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:39,190
That ain't right,
I was thinking of...

487
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:41,690
- Take this road.
- Nah, that ain't right.

488
00:31:41,892 --> 00:31:43,990
Seems to me there's a road...

489
00:31:44,192 --> 00:31:46,790
Cow road that used to lead
all the way...

490
00:31:47,092 --> 00:31:50,190
Well, most of the way...
Er, that ain't right, either.

491
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:57,090
- Hop in while you give it a think.
- Right. Delmar.

492
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:06,790
Any of you boys know your way around
a Walther PPK ?

493
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:12,290
Well, we can't help.
I don't believe it's in Mississippi.

494
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:15,990
Friend, some of your folding
money has come unstowed.

495
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:18,890
Just stuff it
down that sack, will you ?

496
00:32:19,192 --> 00:32:21,190
You boys aren't bad men, I take it ?

497
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:23,490
Well, it's funny you should ask.

498
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:27,590
I was bad till yesterday,
but me and Pete here been saved.

499
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:30,590
I'm Delmar,
and that there is Everett.

500
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:34,490
George Nelson. It's a pleasure.

501
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:38,690
Grab the tiller, will you, buddy ?

502
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:44,690
Hand me that chopper.

503
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:47,890
Say, what line of work
you in, George ?

504
00:32:49,992 --> 00:32:51,390
Come and get me, coppers !

505
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:55,690
You flatfooted, lame-brained,
soft-ass sons of bitches !

506
00:32:55,892 --> 00:33:00,790
Ah ha ! No one can catch me !
I'm George Nelson !

507
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:05,090
I'm bigger than any John,
live or limp !

508
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:09,990
I'm ten an' a half
feet tall !

509
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:16,790
Cows. I hate cows worse than coppers !

510
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:19,790
Oh, George... Not the livestock.

511
00:33:19,992 --> 00:33:25,090
Come on, you miserable salaried
sons of bitches ! Come and get me !

512
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:42,790
Come on, boys,
we're going for the record.

513
00:33:43,092 --> 00:33:44,490
Three banks in two hours !

514
00:33:51,692 --> 00:33:54,790
OK, folks, hold the applause
and drop your drawers !

515
00:33:55,092 --> 00:34:00,490
I'm George Nelson, and I'm here
to sack the city Itta Bena !

516
00:34:00,492 --> 00:34:02,690
He's a live wire, though, ain't he ?

517
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:05,890
All the money in a bag.
What are you lookin' at, grandpa ?

518
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:08,590
Pardon me, George,
you got a plan for escapin' ?

519
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:10,390
Sure, boys.

520
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:12,590
Here's my plan. Ha ha !

521
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:15,390
They ain't never seen
ordnance like this !

522
00:34:15,592 --> 00:34:17,390
Thank you, folks.

523
00:34:17,692 --> 00:34:22,490
And remember, Jesus saves,
but George Nelson withdraws !

524
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:24,590
Go fix the auto voiture, Pete.

525
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:27,690
Is it Babyface Nelson ?

526
00:34:27,892 --> 00:34:30,790
Who said that ?

527
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:34,690
What ignorant, low-down, slanderisin'

528
00:34:34,892 --> 00:34:37,990
son of a bitch said that ?!

529
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:42,590
My name is George Nelson, get me ?!

530
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,890
She didn't mean nothin'
by it, George.

531
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:49,090
George Nelson ! Not Babyface !

532
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:53,290
You remember !
And you tell your friends !

533
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,790
I'm George Nelson.

534
00:34:56,092 --> 00:34:59,190
Born to raise hell.

535
00:35:15,392 --> 00:35:18,390
Well, that was some fun,
now, wasn't it, George ?

536
00:35:18,692 --> 00:35:19,790
Yeah.

537
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,690
Almost makes me wish
I hadn'ta been saved.

538
00:35:22,992 --> 00:35:24,190
Jacking up banks.

539
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:27,790
I can see how a fella'd
derive a whole lot of pleasure

540
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:29,890
and satisfaction out of it.

541
00:35:30,092 --> 00:35:34,190
- It's OK.
- Hoo, dawgies !

542
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:40,090
Well...

543
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:43,990
I'm takin' off.

544
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:52,190
You boys might as well keep my...
share of the riches.

545
00:35:52,492 --> 00:35:57,190
Well, where
are you going, George ?

546
00:35:57,192 --> 00:36:00,190
I don't know. Who cares ?

547
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:05,790
Now, what do you suppose
is eatin' George ?

548
00:36:05,992 --> 00:36:10,490
Well, they say that with
the thrill-seeking personality,

549
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:12,390
what goes up must come down.

550
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:15,690
Top of the world one minute,
sad the next.

551
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:20,390
Yes, sir, it's as if
our old friend George is a alley cat

552
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:23,490
and his own damn humours
are swingin' him by the tail.

553
00:36:23,692 --> 00:36:27,290
I wouldn't worry, Delmar.
He'll be back on top again.

554
00:36:27,492 --> 00:36:32,990
I don't think we've seen
the last of George Nelson.

555
00:36:50,192 --> 00:36:53,090
<i>Don't be saps for Pappy.</i>

556
00:36:53,392 --> 00:36:55,590
<i>Homer Stokes for governor.</i>

557
00:36:55,792 --> 00:37:00,190
<i>Let's sweep this state clean.
Vote for Stokes, brother.</i>

558
00:37:00,492 --> 00:37:03,890
<i>...meet with the darkness
and strive</i>

559
00:37:04,092 --> 00:37:08,790
<i>The sunny side you also may view</i>

560
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,290
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

561
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:13,390
<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

562
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:16,790
Aw, shh. Hang on !
I'm gonna slap one on here.

563
00:37:16,992 --> 00:37:19,190
Folks, here's
my cousin Ezra's niece,

564
00:37:19,492 --> 00:37:21,290
Eudora from out of Greenwood,

565
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:24,490
doin' a little number
with her cousin Tom-Tom,

566
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:29,390
which I predict you
gonna enjoy thoroughly.

567
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:35,990
Now, what can I do you for,
Mr French ?

568
00:37:36,192 --> 00:37:39,190
How can I lay a hold
of them Soggy Bottom Boys ?

569
00:37:39,492 --> 00:37:42,790
Soggy Bottom.
I don't precisely recollect them.

570
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:46,390
They cut a record a few days ago,
an old-timey harmony thing,

571
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:48,590
with a guitar accomp... accomp...

572
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,790
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I remember them.

573
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:53,790
Coloured fellas, I believe.

574
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:56,390
Yes, sir, they a fine bunch of boys.

575
00:37:56,592 --> 00:37:59,890
They sang into yonder can,
then skedaddled.

576
00:38:00,092 --> 00:38:03,690
Well, that record is just
goin' through the goddam roof.

577
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:06,190
- They playin' it far away as Mobile.
- No.

578
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:08,290
Whole damn state's goin' apey.

579
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:11,690
Well, it was a powerful air.

580
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:15,290
Hot damn, we gotta find them boys
and sign 'em to a fat contract.

581
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:19,190
Hell's bells, Mr Lund, if we don't,
the goddam competition will.

582
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:22,590
Oh, mercy, yes, we got
to beat that competition.

583
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:24,290
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

584
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:26,190
<i>Fly away</i>

585
00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:30,890

Delmar ! Over here !

606
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:03,190
Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys
performing "Man of Constant Sorrow" ?

607
00:40:03,392 --> 00:40:05,990
No, ma'am. We got
a new shipment in yesterday.

608
00:40:06,192 --> 00:40:09,390
Sorry, but we just can't
keep 'em on our shelves.

00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:55,190
<i>I'll fly away, fly away...</i>

620
00:40:55,392 --> 00:40:57,190
How are you ?

621
00:40:57,392 --> 00:41:01,090
Delmar, come on. Go.

622
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:05,690
<i>...I'll fly away, fly away</i>

623
00:41:05,992 --> 00:41:08,790
<i>I'll fly away, fly away</i>

624
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:14,790
<i>In the mornin'</i>

625
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:25,190
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

626
00:41:25,392 --> 00:41:26,490
Shut up, Delmar.

627
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:39,790
Pull over ! Pull over !

628
00:41:45,192 --> 00:41:48,590
Guess old Pete's got the itch.

629
00:41:49,992 --> 00:41:53,890
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

630
00:41:54,192 --> 00:41:57,690
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

631
00:41:57,992 --> 00:42:01,090
<i>Your mama's gone away,
and your daddy's gonna stay</i>

632
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:07,390
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

633
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:11,790
<i>- Go to sleep, you little baby...</i>
- Howdy do, ladies ? Name of Pete.

634
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:15,390
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

635
00:42:15,592 --> 00:42:19,090
<i>Everybody's gone
in the cotton and the corn</i>

636
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:24,290
<i>Didn't leave nobody
but the baby...</i>

637
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:25,890
You gonna introduce us ?

638
00:42:26,192 --> 00:42:29,690
I don't know their names.
I seen 'em first !

639
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:33,190
<i>You're sweet, little baby</i>

640
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:37,790
<i>Honey in the rock,
and the sugar don't stop</i>

641
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:42,790
<i>Gonna bring a bottle to the baby</i>

642
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:47,790
<i>Don't you weep, pretty baby</i>

643
00:42:48,092 --> 00:42:51,390
<i>Don't you weep, pretty baby</i>

644
00:42:51,592 --> 00:42:55,390
<i>She's long gone
with her red shoes on</i>

645
00:42:55,592 --> 00:43:00,490
<i>Gonna need another
lovin' baby...</i>

646
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:04,890
Ladies, my name is
Ulysses Everett McGill,

647
00:43:05,092 --> 00:43:10,490
and, well, you three ladies
are about the... the prettiest...

648
00:43:10,692 --> 00:43:13,690
<i>You and me
and the devil makes three</i>

649
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:18,990
<i>Don't need no other
lovin' baby...</i>

650
00:43:19,192 --> 00:43:20,290
Water lilies, uh...

651
00:43:20,592 --> 00:43:24,890
<i>- Go to sleep, you little baby...</i>
- Corn liquor.

652
00:43:25,192 --> 00:43:28,290
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

653
00:43:28,592 --> 00:43:31,990
<i>You and me
and the devil makes three</i>

654
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:38,190
<i>Don't need no other lovin' baby</i>

655
00:43:38,392 --> 00:43:42,690
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

656
00:43:42,892 --> 00:43:46,190
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

657
00:43:46,392 --> 00:43:49,890
<i>Your mama's gone away,
and your daddy's gonna stay</i>

658
00:43:50,192 --> 00:43:56,290
<i>Didn't leave nobody but the baby</i>

659
00:43:56,492 --> 00:44:00,490
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

660
00:44:00,692 --> 00:44:04,490
<i>Go to sleep, you little baby</i>

661
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:08,190
<i>Come lay your bones
on the alabaster stones</i>

662
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:15,390
<i>And be my everlovin' baby</i>

663
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:57,190
Everett.

664
00:44:57,892 --> 00:45:01,390
- Everett.
- My hair !

665
00:45:01,592 --> 00:45:04,590
Look at this.

666
00:45:16,692 --> 00:45:18,390
Pete !

667
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,790
Where the heck are you ?!

668
00:45:22,992 --> 00:45:27,190
We ain't got time
for hide-and-seek !

669
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:29,990
We ain't got time for shenanigans !

670
00:45:30,192 --> 00:45:32,290
Sweet Jesus, Everett.

671
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:36,190
They left his heart !

672
00:45:57,992 --> 00:46:00,590
Delmar, what the heck's got into you ?

673
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:02,190
Can't you see it, Everett ?

674
00:46:02,492 --> 00:46:05,690
Them sirens did this to Pete.

675
00:46:05,992 --> 00:46:11,490
They loved him up
and turned him into a... horny toad.

676
00:46:15,592 --> 00:46:16,890
Pete !

677
00:46:33,692 --> 00:46:37,890
Pete, it's me... Delmar.

678
00:46:38,092 --> 00:46:41,390
It's me... Delmar.

679
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:44,790
- Everett.
- Delmar, what the... ?!

680
00:46:44,992 --> 00:46:48,290
What are we gonna do ?!

681
00:46:56,992 --> 00:46:58,490
I'm not sure that's Pete.

682
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:01,890
Of course it's Pete. Look at him.

683
00:47:02,092 --> 00:47:07,990
We got to find some kind of...
wizard can change him back.

684
00:47:09,992 --> 00:47:13,690
I'm just not sure that's Pete.

685
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:18,490
You can't display a toad
in a fine restaurant.

686
00:47:18,692 --> 00:47:20,190
Folks'd go off their feed.

687
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:23,990
Hey. I just don't think it's right
keeping him under wraps

688
00:47:24,192 --> 00:47:25,790
like we was ashamed of him.

689
00:47:25,992 --> 00:47:27,990
If it is Pete, I am ashamed of him.

690
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:32,090
He got what he deserved, fornicatin'
with some whore of Babylon.

691
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:34,590
These things don't happen
for no reason.

692
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:36,690
It's a judgment on Pete's character.

693
00:47:36,892 --> 00:47:41,290
Well, the two of us was
fixin' to fornicate.

694
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:44,090
You'll have to excuse
my rusticated friend,

695
00:47:44,392 --> 00:47:47,390
unaccustomed as he is
to city manners.

696
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:51,790
I guess we'll have
a couple of steaks

697
00:47:51,992 --> 00:47:53,890
and some, uh, gratin potatoes,

698
00:47:54,092 --> 00:47:56,590
and wash it down with
your finest bubbly wine.

699
00:47:56,892 --> 00:47:59,090
Oh, I don't suppose you have any...

700
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:03,590
Maybe the chef could prepare...

701
00:48:03,892 --> 00:48:07,190
Just bring us a couple
of leaves of raw cabbage.

702
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:09,190
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

703
00:48:09,392 --> 00:48:13,390
I don't believe I've seen you boys.
Allow me to introduce myself.

704
00:48:13,592 --> 00:48:17,390
Name of Daniel Teague,
known around here as Big Dan Teague,

705
00:48:17,692 --> 00:48:20,290
Or, pressed for time, Big Dan !
Tout court !

706
00:48:20,592 --> 00:48:24,790
Name's Ulysses Everett McGill.
My associate, Delmar O'Donnel.

707
00:48:24,992 --> 00:48:28,490
I detect, like me,
you're endowed with the gift of gab.

708
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:32,490
I flatter myself such is the case.
In my line, it's plum necessary.

709
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:35,990
The one thing you don't want...

710
00:48:36,192 --> 00:48:38,490
is air in the conversation.

711
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:41,790
Again we agree.
What kind of work you do, Big Dan ?

712
00:48:42,092 --> 00:48:44,390
Sales, Mr McGill, sales !
What do I sell ?

713
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:46,490
The truth, every blessed word of it.

714
00:48:46,692 --> 00:48:48,690
From Genesis down to Revelations.

715
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,490
Yes, the word of God,
which, let me say,

716
00:48:51,692 --> 00:48:55,390
there's damn good money in
during these times of woe and want.

717
00:48:55,592 --> 00:48:59,590
People want answers, and Big Dan
sells the only book that's got 'em.

718
00:48:59,892 --> 00:49:04,290
And what do you do,
you and your, uh, tongue-tied friend ?

719
00:49:04,592 --> 00:49:06,590
We...

720
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:08,390
We're adventurers, sir,

721
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:10,190
pursuing an opportunity,

722
00:49:10,392 --> 00:49:12,290
but we're open to others as well.

723
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:15,390
I like you.
I'm gonna propose you a proposition.

724
00:49:15,692 --> 00:49:19,990
You cover my bill for now,
get your dinner wrapped picnic-style

725
00:49:20,192 --> 00:49:22,590
and we'll retire
to more private environs,

726
00:49:22,892 --> 00:49:25,390
where I'll reveal how to make
vast amounts of money

727
00:49:25,692 --> 00:49:27,490
in the service of God Almighty.

728
00:49:27,692 --> 00:49:31,290
Well, why not ? I can use
some civilised conversation.

729
00:49:31,592 --> 00:49:33,690
Don't forget your shoe box, friend.

730
00:49:33,992 --> 00:49:37,090
Damn shame !
Goddam campaign is lagging !

731
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:41,590
We need a shot in the arm.
Hear me, boys ? In the goddam arm !

732
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:45,990
Election held tomorrow, that
sumbitch Stokes would win in a walk !

733
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:48,990
He's the reform candidate, Daddy.

734
00:49:49,192 --> 00:49:51,890
- Yeah ?
- A lot of people like that reform.

735
00:49:52,092 --> 00:49:54,190
Maybe we should get us some.

736
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:57,490
I'll reform you,
you soft-headed son of a bitch.

737
00:49:57,692 --> 00:50:00,290
How we gonna run reform ?
We're the incumbent !

738
00:50:00,492 --> 00:50:03,490
Is that the best you can
come up with ? Reform ?!

739
00:50:03,692 --> 00:50:06,090
Weepin' Jesus on the cross.

740
00:50:06,392 --> 00:50:07,790
That's it !

741
00:50:07,992 --> 00:50:10,590
Start drafting my concession speech
right now.

742
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:12,290
OK, Pappy.

743
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:14,890
I'm just making a point,
you stupid son'bitch.

744
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:18,390
- Give me back that hat !
- Pappy's just makin' a point.

745
00:50:18,592 --> 00:50:21,090
Shut up !

746
00:50:35,392 --> 00:50:39,190
Thank you for that fricassee.
I'm a man of large appetites.

747
00:50:39,392 --> 00:50:42,190
Even with lunch under my belt,
I was a mite peckish.

748
00:50:42,392 --> 00:50:43,390
Our pleasure.

749
00:50:43,692 --> 00:50:46,790
Thank you as well for
the conversational hiatus.

750
00:50:47,092 --> 00:50:49,990
I generally refrain
from speech during gustation.

751
00:50:50,192 --> 00:50:53,090
There are those who attempt
both at the same time.

752
00:50:53,392 --> 00:50:55,190
I find it coarse and vulgar.

753
00:50:55,392 --> 00:50:58,390
- Where were we ?
- Making money in the Lord's service.

754
00:50:58,592 --> 00:51:01,890
Friend, when you do speak,
it's to the point and I salute you.

755
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,890
Yes, Bible sales.

756
00:51:04,092 --> 00:51:08,190
The trade is not complicated.
There are two things to learn...

757
00:51:08,392 --> 00:51:09,990
One, find a wholesaler,

758
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,690
the word of God in bulk, as it were.

759
00:51:11,992 --> 00:51:15,790
Two, recognise your customer.
Who are you dealing with ?

760
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:18,790
It's an exercise in psychology,
so to speak.

761
00:51:19,092 --> 00:51:26,390
And it is that which I propose
to give you a lesson in right now.

762
00:51:26,592 --> 00:51:30,090
I like to think I'm an astute
observer of the human scene, too.

763
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:33,390
No doubt, brother.
I figured as much at the restaurant.

764
00:51:33,692 --> 00:51:38,590
That's why I invited you all out here
for this advanced tutorial.

765
00:51:38,892 --> 00:51:41,290
What's going on, Big Dan ?

766
00:51:41,592 --> 00:51:44,390
It's all about the money, boys !
That's it !

767
00:51:44,692 --> 00:51:49,190
Gol... durned... money !

768
00:51:49,392 --> 00:51:50,290
I don't get it.

769
00:51:53,492 --> 00:51:56,990
I'll just take your show cards.

770
00:52:05,192 --> 00:52:08,590
And whatever you got in the hole.

771
00:52:11,692 --> 00:52:15,990
What the...
there ain't nothin' but a damn toad.

772
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:21,890
No, you don't understand.
That's Pete.

773
00:52:24,192 --> 00:52:25,690
Pete.

774
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:29,690
You know these give you warts ?

775
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:38,090
End of lesson.

776
00:52:40,692 --> 00:52:42,990
So long, boys. Hee hee !

777
00:52:43,192 --> 00:52:45,290
See you in the funny papers.

778
00:52:45,492 --> 00:52:49,590
Y'all seen the end of Big Dan Teague.

779
00:53:10,492 --> 00:53:15,590
Where are they ? Talk,
you unreconstructed whelp of a whore !

780
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,590
Where they headed ?

781
00:53:17,792 --> 00:53:20,990
- Aah !
- Your screams won't save your flesh.

782
00:53:21,192 --> 00:53:23,590
- Aah !
- Only your tongue is, boy.

783
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:26,290
- Where they headed ?
- Aah !

784
00:53:37,792 --> 00:53:41,090
Whoa, hound.

785
00:53:47,092 --> 00:53:50,590
Sweet summer rain.

786
00:53:52,392 --> 00:53:55,590
Like God's own mercy.

787
00:53:55,792 --> 00:53:58,590
Your two friends
have abandoned you, Pete.

788
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:01,890
They don't seem to care
about your hide.

789
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:09,890
OK.

790
00:54:13,592 --> 00:54:16,990
Stairway to heaven, Pete.

791
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:20,490
We shall all meet by and by.

792
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:23,290
God damn it !

793
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:26,790
God forgive me !

794
00:54:26,992 --> 00:54:29,990
Hold.

795
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:43,390
Believe me, Delmar, he would
have wanted us to press on.

796
00:54:43,692 --> 00:54:47,590
Pete, rest his soul,
was one sourass son of a bitch

797
00:54:47,792 --> 00:54:50,790
and not given to pointless
sentimentality.

798
00:54:50,992 --> 00:54:53,890
It don't seem right getting
the treasure without him.

799
00:54:54,192 --> 00:54:57,090
Maybe it's for the best
he was squished.

800
00:54:57,392 --> 00:55:00,590
Why, he... was barely
a sentient being and...

801
00:55:00,792 --> 00:55:03,990
when we clean up and
get a little smellum in our hair,

802
00:55:04,192 --> 00:55:06,890
we're gonna feel
100% better about ourselves

803
00:55:07,192 --> 00:55:09,990
and about... life in general.

804
00:55:11,592 --> 00:55:15,090
Must be near Parchment Farm.

805
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:16,890
Sorry sons of bitches.

806
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:20,590
Seems like a year ago
we busted off the farm.

807
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,090
Pete got a brother ?

808
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:35,190
Not that I'm aware.

809
00:55:36,592 --> 00:55:38,690
Heat must be getting to me.

810
00:55:46,992 --> 00:55:50,990
<i>Oh, the storm and its fury
raged today</i>

811
00:55:51,192 --> 00:55:55,590
<i>Crushing hope
that we cherished so dear</i>

812
00:55:55,892 --> 00:56:00,790
<i>The cloud and storm
will in time pass away</i>

813
00:56:00,992 --> 00:56:05,990
<i>And the sun again
will shine bright and clear</i>

814
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:08,690
<i>Keep on the sunny side</i>

815
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:11,090
<i>Always on the sunny side</i>

816
00:56:11,292 --> 00:56:15,390
<i>Keep on the sunny side of life</i>

817
00:56:15,692 --> 00:56:17,690
<i>It will help us every day</i>

818
00:56:17,892 --> 00:56:19,990
<i>It will brighten all the way</i>

819
00:56:20,192 --> 00:56:24,590
<i>If we'll keep on
the sunny side of life</i>

820
00:56:24,892 --> 00:56:29,490
<i>If we'll keep on
the sunny side of life</i>

821
00:56:31,392 --> 00:56:34,990
That was wonderful.
That sure was. Yes.

822
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:38,190
Now, I know The Sunnysiders
would agree with me

823
00:56:38,392 --> 00:56:40,790
when I say that the great state
of Mississippi

824
00:56:41,092 --> 00:56:44,790
cannot afford four more years
of Pappy O'Daniel !

825
00:56:45,092 --> 00:56:47,690
Four more years of cronyism !

826
00:56:47,892 --> 00:56:50,690
Nepotism ! Rascalism !

827
00:56:50,892 --> 00:56:54,590
Of service to the interests !

828
00:56:54,792 --> 00:56:57,790
Now, the choice, she's a clear 'un.

829
00:56:58,092 --> 00:57:01,490
Pappy O'Daniel,
slave of the interests...

830
00:57:01,692 --> 00:57:05,790
Homer Stokes, servant of
the little man. Right, little fella ?

831
00:57:05,992 --> 00:57:07,190
He ain't lyin' !

832
00:57:07,392 --> 00:57:11,190
Ladies and gentlemen,
the little man has admonished me

833
00:57:11,392 --> 00:57:13,790
to grasp the broom of reform

834
00:57:13,992 --> 00:57:16,390
and sweep this state clean !

835
00:57:16,692 --> 00:57:19,590
It's gonna be,
"Back to the flour mill, Pappy" !

836
00:57:19,892 --> 00:57:22,090
The interests can handle themselves !

837
00:57:22,392 --> 00:57:26,090
Come Tuesday,
we're gonna sweep the rascals out !

838
00:57:28,092 --> 00:57:31,890
Clean government
is yours for the asking !

839
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,590
Folks,
now the little Wharvey gals !

840
00:57:38,192 --> 00:57:42,190
Wharvey gals ? Did he just say
"little Wharvey gals" ?

841
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,490
Come here, girls.

842
00:57:44,792 --> 00:57:46,490
What y'all gonna sing for us ?

843
00:57:46,692 --> 00:57:48,590
"In the Highways".

844
00:57:48,892 --> 00:57:51,890
- God damn it all !
- You know them gals, Everett ?

845
00:57:52,092 --> 00:57:53,290
<i>In the highways</i>

846
00:57:53,592 --> 00:57:55,090
<i>In the hedges</i>

847
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:57,590
<i>In the highways</i>

848
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:59,290
<i>In the hedges</i>

849
00:57:59,592 --> 00:58:01,790
<i>In the highways</i>

850
00:58:02,092 --> 00:58:03,790
<i>In the hedges</i>

851
00:58:03,992 --> 00:58:07,790
<i>I'll be somewhere
a-working for my Lord</i>

852
00:58:07,992 --> 00:58:09,890
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

853
00:58:10,092 --> 00:58:11,890
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

854
00:58:12,192 --> 00:58:15,890
<i>I'll be somewhere
a-working for my Lord</i>

855
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,990
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

856
00:58:18,192 --> 00:58:20,090
<i>I'll be somewhere a-working</i>

857
00:58:20,392 --> 00:58:25,390
<i>I'll be somewhere
a-working for my Lord</i>

858
00:58:25,692 --> 00:58:27,390
Hey, girls !

859
00:58:27,592 --> 00:58:29,790
Daddy ! Daddy !

860
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,990
Daddy ? He ain't our daddy.

861
00:58:34,192 --> 00:58:37,190
Hell I ain't.
What's this Wharvey ? You're McGills.

862
00:58:37,492 --> 00:58:39,690
Not since you
got hit by that train.

863
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:41,390
What ? I wasn't hit by a train.

864
00:58:41,592 --> 00:58:45,390
- Mama says you was hit by a train.
- Blooey ! Nothin' left.

865
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:47,290
Just a grease spot on the L & N.

866
00:58:47,592 --> 00:58:50,090
Damn it, I wasn't hit by any train !

867
00:58:50,292 --> 00:58:51,790
Mama's got us back to Wharvey.

868
00:58:51,992 --> 00:58:54,990
- That's her maiden name.
- You got a maiden name, Daddy ?

869
00:58:55,192 --> 00:58:57,190
Daddy don't have a maiden name...

870
00:58:57,392 --> 00:58:58,590
That's your misfortune.

871
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:02,290
- And now mama's got a new beau.
- He's a suitor.

872
00:59:02,592 --> 00:59:04,190
Yeah, I heard about that.

873
00:59:04,392 --> 00:59:07,390
Mama says he's bona fide.

874
00:59:07,592 --> 00:59:09,990
Mmm. He give her a ring ?

875
00:59:10,292 --> 00:59:11,490
Yes, sir. A big 'un.

876
00:59:11,692 --> 00:59:14,090
- Gold and gems.
- Mama checked it.

877
00:59:14,392 --> 00:59:16,190
- It's bona fide.
- He's a suitor.

878
00:59:16,392 --> 00:59:18,790
- What's his name ?
- Vernon T Waldrip.

879
00:59:18,992 --> 00:59:20,690
- Uncle Vernon.
- Till tomorrow.

880
00:59:20,892 --> 00:59:22,190
Then he's Daddy.

881
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,990
I am the only daddy you got.
I am the damn pater familias.

882
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:29,590
But you ain't bona fide.

883
00:59:31,392 --> 00:59:32,790
Where's your mama ?

884
00:59:33,092 --> 00:59:37,290
- At the five-and-dime.
- Buying nipples.

885
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:40,290
<i>This way</i>

886
00:59:40,592 --> 00:59:44,490
<i>To take me home</i>

887
00:59:44,792 --> 00:59:49,190
<i>Kiss me more...</i>

888
00:59:52,192 --> 00:59:55,790
- Daddy !
- Hello, sugar ! Ha ha !

889
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:57,690
How's my little girl ?

890
00:59:57,992 --> 00:59:59,490
Hi.

891
00:59:59,692 --> 01:00:02,090
- Who the hell's that ?
- Starla Wharvey.

892
01:00:02,292 --> 01:00:04,090
Starla McGill, you mean.

893
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,090
- You never told me.
- Cos you was hit by a train.

894
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:09,690
Why are you telling our gals
I was hit by a train ?

895
01:00:09,992 --> 01:00:12,390
Lots of respectable people
been hit by trains.

896
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:14,390
Judge Hobby was hit by a train.

897
01:00:14,692 --> 01:00:16,290
What was I supposed to say,

898
01:00:16,492 --> 01:00:19,090
that you were jailed
and I divorced you from shame ?

899
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:23,590
I take your point. But it puts me in
an awkward spot vis  vis my progeny.

900
01:00:23,792 --> 01:00:30,090
Hello, Penny.
Is this gentleman bothering you ?

901
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:32,090
You Waldrip ?

902
01:00:32,292 --> 01:00:35,390
Uh-huh. That's right.

903
01:00:47,392 --> 01:00:49,590
You been using my hair treatment ?

904
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:51,790
Your hair treatment ?

905
01:00:51,992 --> 01:00:55,190
Excuse me.

906
01:00:56,892 --> 01:01:00,790
I got news. In case you hadn't
noticed, I wasn't hit by a train,

907
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:03,290
and I have travelled
many a weary mile

908
01:01:03,592 --> 01:01:07,790
to be back with my wife
and my six daughters.

909
01:01:07,992 --> 01:01:10,990
- Seven, Daddy !
- That ain't your daddy, Alvanelle.

910
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,590
Your daddy was hit by a train.

911
01:01:12,892 --> 01:01:14,190
Penny, you stop that !

912
01:01:14,492 --> 01:01:16,290
You stop it ! Vernon here's got a job.

913
01:01:16,492 --> 01:01:19,590
Vernon's got prospects.
He's bona fide. What are you ?

914
01:01:19,792 --> 01:01:21,290
I'll tell you what I am...

915
01:01:21,492 --> 01:01:24,590
I'm the pater familias,
and you can't marry him !

916
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:26,690
I can, I am and I will, tomorrow.

917
01:01:26,992 --> 01:01:29,190
I gotta think about the Wharvey gals.

918
01:01:29,392 --> 01:01:31,490
They look to me for answers.

919
01:01:31,692 --> 01:01:33,890
Vernon can buy 'em
lessons on the clarinet.

920
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:37,790
The only good thing you
ever did was get hit by that train !

921
01:01:37,992 --> 01:01:41,990
Well, you lying, unconstant succubus.

922
01:01:42,192 --> 01:01:46,090
Whoa, whoa !
You can't swear at my fiance !

923
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:50,990
Oh, yeah ?
Well, you can't marry my wife !

924
01:02:11,692 --> 01:02:14,390
Who is that man ?

925
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:17,190
He's not my husband.

926
01:02:17,392 --> 01:02:22,990
Just a drifter, I guess.
Just some no-account drifter.

927
01:02:25,092 --> 01:02:28,890
And stay out of the Woolsworth !

928
01:02:33,192 --> 01:02:35,490
<i>I'll bet she does
imitations, too.</i>

929
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:38,590
Deceitful, two-faced she-wolf.

930
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:40,990
Never trust a female, Delmar.

931
01:02:41,192 --> 01:02:45,590
Remember that precept and your time
with me won't have been ill-spent.

932
01:02:45,892 --> 01:02:48,790
- OK, Everett.
- "Hit by a train".

933
01:02:48,992 --> 01:02:51,490
Truth means nothing to a woman,
Delmar.

934
01:02:51,692 --> 01:02:55,090
Triumph of the subjective.
You ever been with a woman ?

935
01:02:55,392 --> 01:02:58,890
Well, I've...
I got to get the family farm back

936
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,590
before I can start
thinking about that.

937
01:03:01,892 --> 01:03:03,690
That's right. If then.

938
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:07,790
Believe me, a woman's the
most fiendish instrument of torture

939
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:10,590
ever devised
to bedevil the days of man.

940
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:13,490
Everett, I never figured you
for a pater familias.

941
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:17,990
Ohh, yes. I have spread my seed.

942
01:03:18,192 --> 01:03:19,590
And look what it's...

943
01:03:21,492 --> 01:03:26,390
God damn it.
What the hell... ?

944
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:26,690
OK, boys.
Enjoy your picture show.

945
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:34,390
<i>I have no money, honey</i>

946
01:04:34,592 --> 01:04:36,690
<i>How can I change ?</i>

947
01:04:36,892 --> 01:04:42,190
Do... not... seek the treasure.

948
01:04:44,192 --> 01:04:50,090
Do not... seek the treasure.

949
01:04:50,392 --> 01:04:52,290
It's a bushwhack.

950
01:04:52,492 --> 01:04:55,290
They're fixin' an ambush.

951
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:59,590
Do not seek the treasure.

952
01:05:02,692 --> 01:05:07,990
We... we thought you was...

953
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:11,290
a toad.

954
01:05:13,892 --> 01:05:22,590
We... thought...
you... was... a... toad.

955
01:05:22,892 --> 01:05:26,890
Do not seek the treasure.

956
01:05:27,092 --> 01:05:31,290
Quiet there !
Watch the picture !

957
01:05:35,592 --> 01:05:36,990
I signed that bill.

958
01:05:37,292 --> 01:05:39,790
I signed a dozen agriculture bills.

959
01:05:39,992 --> 01:05:42,690
Everyone knows
I'm a friend of the farmer.

960
01:05:42,992 --> 01:05:45,690
What I gotta do,
start diddling livestock ?

961
01:05:45,892 --> 01:05:48,990
We can't do that, Daddy.
We might offend our constituency.

962
01:05:49,192 --> 01:05:54,390
We ain't got a constituency !
Stokes got a constituency !

963
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,590
Well, it's a well-run campaign.

964
01:05:56,792 --> 01:05:58,590
Midget and broom and whatnot.

965
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:01,590
- Devil his due.
- Hell of an organisation.

966
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,890
- Say, I got an idea.
- What's that, Junior ?

967
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:08,590
We can hire us a little fella
even smaller than Stokes's.

968
01:06:08,892 --> 01:06:10,990
You slump-shouldered sack of nuts !

969
01:06:11,192 --> 01:06:13,990
We'd look like a bunch
of johnny-come-latelys

970
01:06:14,192 --> 01:06:16,090
bringin' out our own midget.

971
01:06:16,392 --> 01:06:17,790
Don't matter how stumpy !

972
01:06:18,092 --> 01:06:22,590
That's the goddam problem, people
think Stokes has got fresh ideas.

973
01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:24,890
He's au courant
and we're the past !

974
01:06:25,092 --> 01:06:26,390
It's a problem of...

975
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:28,190
- Perception.
- Right.

976
01:06:28,392 --> 01:06:31,190
- He's pulling our pants down.
- Gonna paddle some behind.

977
01:06:31,392 --> 01:06:33,490
Ain't gonna paddle it. Gonna kick it.

978
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:37,190
- No, he's gonna paddle it.
- That's not a proper description.

979
01:06:37,492 --> 01:06:44,090
- That's how I'd characterise it.
- It's more of a kickin' situation.

980
01:06:57,292 --> 01:07:02,490
God... God forgive me.

981
01:07:02,792 --> 01:07:06,790
I could not gaze upon that fireshow.

982
01:07:07,092 --> 01:07:09,990
Pete.

983
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:14,590
- Hold still !
- Can't... stand much longer.

984
01:07:14,792 --> 01:07:17,590
It was... it was
a mo-moment of weakness.

985
01:07:17,892 --> 01:07:19,790
Quit babblin', we gotta skedaddle.

986
01:07:19,992 --> 01:07:21,990
That's all I got.

987
01:07:22,192 --> 01:07:23,790
They lured me out for a bathe

988
01:07:23,992 --> 01:07:27,290
and then they dunked me,
trussed me up like a hog,

989
01:07:27,592 --> 01:07:29,190
and turned me in for the bounty.

990
01:07:29,392 --> 01:07:31,990
Shoulda guessed it.
Typical womanly behaviour.

991
01:07:32,192 --> 01:07:34,590
We're lucky we left
before they came back.

992
01:07:34,792 --> 01:07:36,490
We didn't abandon you, Pete.

993
01:07:36,692 --> 01:07:38,790
We just thought you was a toad.

994
01:07:38,992 --> 01:07:41,290
No, they never did
turn me into a toad.

995
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:44,190
Well, that was our mistake, then.

996
01:07:44,392 --> 01:07:49,190
We was beat up by a Bible salesman
and banished from Woolworths.

997
01:07:49,392 --> 01:07:52,290
Everett, was it the one branch
or all of them ?

998
01:07:52,492 --> 01:07:55,190
Well, I ain't had it easy,
either, boys.

999
01:07:55,392 --> 01:07:59,890
Frankly, uh, well, I...

1000
01:08:00,792 --> 01:08:03,190
I spilt my guts about the treasure.

1001
01:08:06,192 --> 01:08:10,190
I'm awful sorry
I betrayed you, fellas.

1002
01:08:10,492 --> 01:08:13,990
Must be my Hogwallop blood.

1003
01:08:14,792 --> 01:08:16,590
That's all right, Pete.

1004
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:19,690
Awful white of you to take it
like that, Everett.

1005
01:08:19,992 --> 01:08:22,390
I feel wretched.

1006
01:08:22,592 --> 01:08:25,990
Spoiling your play for
a million dollar point two.

1007
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:29,090
You should rip out my guts.

1008
01:08:29,392 --> 01:08:31,490
No, that's all right.

1009
01:08:33,392 --> 01:08:37,990
You boys are true friends ! Ohh !

1010
01:08:37,992 --> 01:08:40,590
You're my beaucoup friends.

1011
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:44,590
Pete, I don't want you to
beat yourself up about this, eh ?

1012
01:08:44,792 --> 01:08:52,090
I can't help it, but
that's a... a wonderful thing to say.

1013
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:58,190
Yeah. Pete, uh...

1014
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:02,890
Well, fact of the matter is...

1015
01:09:04,992 --> 01:09:06,590
Damn it...

1016
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:09,990
There ain't no treasure.

1017
01:09:11,692 --> 01:09:13,890
Fact of the matter is
there never was.

1018
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:15,790
But...

1019
01:09:16,092 --> 01:09:21,690
So where's all the money
from the armoured car job ?

1020
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:24,390
I never knocked over no armoured car.

1021
01:09:24,592 --> 01:09:27,890
I was sent up for
practising law without a license.

1022
01:09:28,092 --> 01:09:29,790
- But...
- I had to bust out.

1023
01:09:29,992 --> 01:09:35,190
My wife wrote me she was
getting married, I gotta stop it.

1024
01:09:35,192 --> 01:09:38,190
I had two weeks left
on my sentence.

1025
01:09:38,392 --> 01:09:40,390
I couldn't wait, wedding's tomorrow.

1026
01:09:40,592 --> 01:09:48,390
My added time for the escape,
I don't get out now till 19... 87.

1027
01:09:48,592 --> 01:09:50,290
I am sorry about that.

1028
01:09:50,592 --> 01:09:55,590
I'll be... 84 years old.

1029
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:59,590
I guess they'll tack on
50 years for me, too.

1030
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:03,990
Boys, we was chained together.
I had to tell you something.

1031
01:10:04,192 --> 01:10:09,190
Busting out alone
was not an option. I'm sorry.

1032
01:10:09,492 --> 01:10:12,890
84 years old.

1033
01:10:12,992 --> 01:10:16,190
Well, I'll only be 82.

1034
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:19,090
You ! You ruined my life !

1035
01:10:19,392 --> 01:10:21,890
You ruined my life !

1036
01:10:22,192 --> 01:10:24,090
I do apologise, Pete.

1037
01:10:24,392 --> 01:10:28,490
84 years old !
I'm becoming Papillon !

1038
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:30,190
Delmar !

1039
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:37,890
Now, boys. Boys.

1040
01:10:50,592 --> 01:10:57,390
<i>Eeny meeny meiny mo</i>

1041
01:11:33,592 --> 01:11:38,790
<i>Oh death</i>

1042
01:11:38,992 --> 01:11:43,890
<i>Whoa death</i>

1043
01:11:44,192 --> 01:11:48,890
<i>Won't you spare me over
till another year ?</i>

1044
01:11:53,992 --> 01:11:56,790
<i>Well, I am death, none can excel</i>

1045
01:11:56,992 --> 01:12:01,190
<i>I'll open the door
to heaven or hell</i>

1046
01:12:01,392 --> 01:12:03,990
<i>Whoa, death, someone would pray</i>

1047
01:12:04,192 --> 01:12:08,790
<i>Could you wait to call me
another day ?</i>

1048
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:09,990
<i>Children pray...</i>

1049
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:14,590
That's Tommy.
They got Tommy !

1050
01:12:15,592 --> 01:12:16,790
Noose.

1051
01:12:17,092 --> 01:12:19,890
<i>No longer prayin'...</i>

1052
01:12:20,192 --> 01:12:24,390
Sweet Jesus, we got to save him.

1053
01:12:24,592 --> 01:12:27,190
<i>I'll fix your feet
till you can't walk</i>

1054
01:12:27,392 --> 01:12:32,290
<i>I'll lock your jaw
till you can't talk</i>

1055
01:12:32,592 --> 01:12:35,690
<i>I'll close your eyes
so you can't see</i>

1056
01:12:35,892 --> 01:12:40,190
<i>- It's very dark...</i>
- The colour guard.

1057
01:12:40,592 --> 01:12:43,990
<i>Death, I come to take the soul</i>

1058
01:12:44,192 --> 01:12:48,590
<i>Leave the body and leave it cold</i>

1059
01:12:48,892 --> 01:12:52,190
<i>Oh death</i>

1060
01:12:52,492 --> 01:12:56,590
<i>Whoa death</i>

1061
01:12:56,792 --> 01:13:02,290
<i>Won't you spare me over
till another year ?</i>

1062
01:13:03,992 --> 01:13:06,590
Brothers !

1063
01:13:06,892 --> 01:13:09,390
Oh, brothers !

1064
01:13:09,592 --> 01:13:17,190
We have all gathered here to preserve
our hallowed culture and heritage

1065
01:13:17,392 --> 01:13:23,190
from intrusion,
inclusion and dilution

1066
01:13:23,392 --> 01:13:26,090
of colour, of creed,

1067
01:13:26,392 --> 01:13:28,290
and of our old-time religion.

1068
01:13:28,492 --> 01:13:32,790
We aim to pull evil up by the root

1069
01:13:33,092 --> 01:13:38,790
before it chokes out the flower
of our culture and heritage.

1070
01:13:39,092 --> 01:13:42,690
And our women,
let's not forget those ladies, y'all,

1071
01:13:42,992 --> 01:13:45,690
looking to us for protection

1072
01:13:45,892 --> 01:13:50,490
from darkies,
from Jews, from papists,

1073
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:53,390
and from all those smart-ass folks

1074
01:13:53,592 --> 01:13:56,290
say we come descended from monkeys.

1075
01:13:56,492 --> 01:13:59,490
- That's not my culture and heritage.
- Yes !

1076
01:13:59,792 --> 01:14:01,090
Is it yours ?

1077
01:14:01,392 --> 01:14:03,390
No !

1078
01:14:03,592 --> 01:14:06,090
And so...

1079
01:14:06,292 --> 01:14:08,190
we gonna hang us a Negro.

1080
01:14:21,592 --> 01:14:26,390
I ain't never harmed you,
neither of you gentlemen.

1081
01:14:47,492 --> 01:14:51,190
I ain't never harmed nobody.

1082
01:14:52,892 --> 01:14:54,990
- Hey, Tommy.
- Huh ?

1083
01:14:55,292 --> 01:14:56,990
Tommy, we come to rescue you.

1084
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:59,190
That's mighty kind of you boys,

1085
01:14:59,492 --> 01:15:02,490
but I don't think nothing's
going to save me now.

1086
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:06,490
The devil's come
to collect his due.

1087
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:08,590
Don't be crazy, Tommy.

1088
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:10,490
You don't wanna get hanged.

1089
01:15:10,792 --> 01:15:12,790
Well, naw, I don't reckon I do,

1090
01:15:12,992 --> 01:15:16,890
but that's the way it's working out.

1091
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:19,890
Tommy, I got a plan.

1092
01:15:22,792 --> 01:15:25,190
No !

1093
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:31,090
The colour guard is coloured.

1094
01:15:33,192 --> 01:15:36,490
Who made them the colour guard ?

1095
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,190
Run, boys !

1096
01:15:46,592 --> 01:15:47,590
No, no, son !

1097
01:15:50,492 --> 01:15:54,990
Can't let that flag
touch the ground !

1098
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:19,590
Get your hands off me.

1099
01:16:19,892 --> 01:16:22,190
I can do this myself,
get away from me.

1100
01:16:22,492 --> 01:16:24,290
We should hire this man away.

1101
01:16:24,592 --> 01:16:26,790
- Good idea, Pappy.
- Hell of an idea.

1102
01:16:26,992 --> 01:16:30,590
- Can't beat 'em, join 'em.
- He'll join us, run our campaign.

1103
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:34,690
- Power, wealth...
- No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

1104
01:16:34,992 --> 01:16:38,490
- Not with his blandishments.
- And powers of persuasion.

1105
01:16:38,692 --> 01:16:41,690
- What's his name again ?
- The campaign manager ?

1106
01:16:41,892 --> 01:16:43,590
- Waldrip.
- Vernon Waldrip.

1107
01:16:43,792 --> 01:16:47,190
- Vernon T Waldrip.
- Hmm.

1108
01:16:52,092 --> 01:16:54,190
It's invitation only.

1109
01:16:54,392 --> 01:16:57,190
- We'll have to sneak in.
- Hold on.

1110
01:16:57,392 --> 01:16:58,790
Wait a minute.

1111
01:16:58,992 --> 01:17:01,190
Who elected you
leader of this outfit ?

1112
01:17:01,392 --> 01:17:05,390
Since we've been following your lead,
we got nothing but trouble.

1113
01:17:05,592 --> 01:17:08,290
I've gotten this close
to being strung up

1114
01:17:08,492 --> 01:17:11,390
and consumed in a fire
and whipped no end

1115
01:17:11,692 --> 01:17:13,390
and sunstroked and soggied.

1116
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:14,990
And turned into a frog.

1117
01:17:15,192 --> 01:17:16,590
He wasn't turned into a frog.

1118
01:17:16,792 --> 01:17:20,890
Almost loved up, though.

1119
01:17:21,192 --> 01:17:23,990
So, you're against me now, too ?

1120
01:17:24,292 --> 01:17:27,690
Is that how it is, boys ?

1121
01:17:28,392 --> 01:17:34,690
The whole world and God Almighty...
now you ?

1122
01:17:37,692 --> 01:17:39,390
I guess I deserve it.

1123
01:17:39,692 --> 01:17:43,090
Boys...

1124
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:46,190
I know that I made
some tactical mistakes,

1125
01:17:46,392 --> 01:17:49,390
but if you just stick with me,
I got a plan.

1126
01:17:49,592 --> 01:17:51,890
Believe me, we can fix this thing.

1127
01:17:52,092 --> 01:17:54,490
I'll get my wife back, we'll leave.

1128
01:17:58,392 --> 01:18:01,190
Goddam disgrace !

1129
01:18:01,392 --> 01:18:03,890
Made a travesty
of the entire evening.

1130
01:18:04,092 --> 01:18:07,790
Ohh ! What I wouldn't give
to get a hold of those agitators.

1131
01:18:07,992 --> 01:18:11,590
Whoever heard of such behaviour,
even amongst the coloured ?

1132
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:16,290
Mulattos, maybe. I suspect some
miscegenation in their heritage.

1133
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:19,090
Using a Confederate flag
as a missile !

1134
01:18:19,392 --> 01:18:22,490
Crazy ! No one's ever gonna believe
we're a real band.

1135
01:18:22,692 --> 01:18:25,490
I just gotta get close enough
to talk to her.

1136
01:18:25,692 --> 01:18:28,990
Comin' with us got more future than
marrying a guy called Waldrip.

1137
01:18:29,192 --> 01:18:31,590
I'm goddam bona fide.
I got the answers.

1138
01:18:31,892 --> 01:18:34,990
Everett, my beard itches.

1139
01:18:45,692 --> 01:18:50,090
"In the Jailhouse Now", fellas.
Neighbourhood of B.

1140
01:18:57,892 --> 01:19:01,790
Penny. Ahem.

1141
01:19:02,192 --> 01:19:06,790
- It's me.
- No.

1142
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,190
Honey !

1143
01:19:08,492 --> 01:19:11,990
<i>I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob</i>

1144
01:19:12,192 --> 01:19:14,790
<i>He used to steal, gamble and rob</i>

1145
01:19:14,992 --> 01:19:19,990
<i>He thought he was
the smartest guy around</i>

1146
01:19:20,192 --> 01:19:21,490
<i>Well, I...</i>

1147
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:26,290
We're leaving the state, pursuing
opportunities in another venue.

1148
01:19:26,492 --> 01:19:28,490
I got big plans.

1149
01:19:28,792 --> 01:19:31,390
Not minstrels,
I'm going to be a dentist.

1150
01:19:31,592 --> 01:19:35,990
I know this guy
who'll print me up a license.

1151
01:19:36,292 --> 01:19:39,290
<i>He's in the jailhouse now</i>

1152
01:19:39,492 --> 01:19:42,890
<i>Well, I told him once or twice</i>

1153
01:19:43,192 --> 01:19:47,090
<i>To stop playin' cards
and a-shootin' dice</i>

1154
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:50,690
<i>He's in the jailhouse now</i>

1155
01:20:10,392 --> 01:20:12,290
<i>Bob liked to play his poker...</i>

1156
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:16,490
Why, that is
an improper suggestion.

1157
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:21,590
I can't switch sides
in the middle of a campaign...

1158
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:25,190
especially to work for a man
who lacks moral fibre.

1159
01:20:25,392 --> 01:20:28,590
Moral fibre ?
Why, you pasty-face son'bitch.

1160
01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:30,290
I invented moral fibre.

1161
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:33,690
Pappy was displaying rectitude
when that egghead you work for

1162
01:20:33,992 --> 01:20:36,190
was still messin' his drawers !

1163
01:20:36,392 --> 01:20:39,090
- Psst ! Honey.
- Go away.

1164
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:41,590
I want to be what
you want me to be, honey.

1165
01:20:41,892 --> 01:20:44,590
I want you and the gals
to come with me.

1166
01:20:44,792 --> 01:20:49,390
<i>To stop playin' cards
and a-shootin' dice...</i>

1167
01:20:49,592 --> 01:20:52,890
What are you doing here, Pappy ?

1168
01:20:53,092 --> 01:20:55,090
Someone let on we were
giving out liquor.

1169
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:58,090
You'll laugh out the other side
of your face November.

1170
01:20:58,392 --> 01:20:59,990
Pappy'll be laughin' then.

1171
01:21:00,192 --> 01:21:03,790
- Not out the other side of his face.
- Just the regular side.

1172
01:21:17,192 --> 01:21:19,190
They're my daughters, too, Penny.

1173
01:21:19,492 --> 01:21:20,890
Ain't you ever heard of... ?

1174
01:21:21,192 --> 01:21:23,390
<i>In constant sorrow</i>

1175
01:21:39,992 --> 01:21:43,690
<i>I am the man</i>

1176
01:21:43,992 --> 01:21:46,490
<i>Of constant sorrow</i>

1177
01:21:46,792 --> 01:21:49,090
<i>I've seen trouble...</i>

1178
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:51,890
Hot damn !
It's the Soggy Bottom Boys !

1179
01:21:52,192 --> 01:21:56,590
<i>I bid farewell</i>

1180
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:58,690
<i>To old Kentucky</i>

1181
01:21:58,892 --> 01:22:04,290
<i>The place where
I was born and raised</i>

1182
01:22:04,492 --> 01:22:06,890
<i>The place where he</i>

1183
01:22:07,192 --> 01:22:11,290
<i>Was born and raised...</i>

1184
01:22:29,892 --> 01:22:32,190
Holy moly ! These boys are a hit !

1185
01:22:32,492 --> 01:22:34,790
But, Pappy, they's integrated.

1186
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:37,190
Wait a minute.

1187
01:22:37,392 --> 01:22:39,790
Folks don't mind they's integrated.

1188
01:22:39,992 --> 01:22:43,890
You's miscegenated.
All you boys is miscegenated !

1189
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:45,290
Gimme a microphone !

1190
01:22:45,592 --> 01:22:48,590
Gimme a microphone !
Gimme a microphone !

1191
01:22:48,792 --> 01:22:53,990
These boys is not white.
Hell, they ain't even old-timey.

1192
01:22:54,192 --> 01:22:56,590
I happen to know,
ladies and gentlemen,

1193
01:22:56,792 --> 01:22:59,490
that this band of miscreants,
this very evening,

1194
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:04,990
interfered with a lynch mob
in the performance of its duties.

1195
01:23:05,192 --> 01:23:06,590
It's true !

1196
01:23:06,792 --> 01:23:09,190
See, I belong
to a certain secret society.

1197
01:23:09,392 --> 01:23:12,290
I don't believe I gotta
mention its name, you know ?

1198
01:23:12,592 --> 01:23:14,890
Let 'em play ! Go on !

1199
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:18,490
And these boys here,

1200
01:23:18,692 --> 01:23:22,290
they trampled all over our
venerated observances and rituals.

1201
01:23:22,492 --> 01:23:25,290
This here music is over, all right ?

1202
01:23:25,492 --> 01:23:26,990
And I have... No ! Hey !

1203
01:23:27,192 --> 01:23:29,590
Hey, I ain't... listen to me.

1204
01:23:29,892 --> 01:23:31,790
Folks, listen to me. I...

1205
01:23:31,992 --> 01:23:34,990
These boys desecrated a fiery cross.

1206
01:23:36,292 --> 01:23:38,390
We's all havin' a good time !

1207
01:23:38,592 --> 01:23:42,490
And they's convicts, folks,
fugitives escaped off the farm.

1208
01:23:42,792 --> 01:23:46,390
Now, folks, these boys gotta
be remanded to the authorities.

1209
01:23:46,692 --> 01:23:47,890
Criminals !

1210
01:23:48,092 --> 01:23:50,390
And I have it
from the highest authority

1211
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:53,590
that that Negro
sold his soul to the devil !

1212
01:23:55,492 --> 01:23:58,490
Wait a minute, folks.
It's true !

1213
01:23:58,692 --> 01:23:59,490
It's true !

1214
01:24:00,792 --> 01:24:01,890
Wait a minute.

1215
01:24:02,092 --> 01:24:05,090
Is you is, or is you ain't
my constituency ?

1216
01:24:05,392 --> 01:24:06,290
No !

1217
01:24:06,592 --> 01:24:08,990
<i>Is you is, or is you ain't
my constituency ?</i>

1218
01:24:09,192 --> 01:24:11,190
No !

1219
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,890
Is you is...

1220
01:24:14,192 --> 01:24:18,390
Is you is,
or is you ain't my constituency ?

1221
01:24:18,592 --> 01:24:20,990
Oh, come on, folks.

1222
01:24:21,192 --> 01:24:22,590
No. It's Homer now.

1223
01:24:22,892 --> 01:24:24,790
I'm a friend of the little man.

1224
01:24:35,792 --> 01:24:38,890
This is not fair !
Hey ! Come on !

1225
01:24:41,992 --> 01:24:47,390
Come on, we got a little
misunderstanding here. God damn !

1226
01:24:51,892 --> 01:24:56,090
<i>It's fair to tell</i>

1227
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:58,790
<i>My only lover</i>

1228
01:24:58,992 --> 01:25:01,290
<i>I never expect</i>

1229
01:25:01,592 --> 01:25:04,990
<i>To see you again</i>

1230
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:09,490
<i>For I'm bound to ride</i>

1231
01:25:09,692 --> 01:25:12,290
<i>That northern railroad</i>

1232
01:25:12,492 --> 01:25:17,190
<i>Perhaps I'll die upon that train</i>

1233
01:25:17,492 --> 01:25:22,790
<i>Perhaps he'll die
upon his train...</i>

1234
01:25:23,092 --> 01:25:26,390
God damn !
Opportunity knocks !

1235
01:25:26,592 --> 01:25:28,790
Get out of my way !

1236
01:25:29,092 --> 01:25:31,490
<i>I'm just a stranger</i>

1237
01:25:31,692 --> 01:25:34,190
<i>In case you ever</i>

1238
01:25:34,392 --> 01:25:36,590
<i>See your man...</i>

1239
01:25:37,992 --> 01:25:42,490
<i>But there is one promise</i>

1240
01:25:42,792 --> 01:25:44,790
<i>That is given</i>

1241
01:25:45,092 --> 01:25:47,390
<i>I'll meet you on</i>

1242
01:25:47,692 --> 01:25:50,190
<i>God's golden shore</i>

1243
01:25:50,492 --> 01:25:52,990
<i>He'll meet you on</i>

1244
01:25:53,292 --> 01:25:55,790
<i>God's golden shore</i>

1245
01:25:55,992 --> 01:25:59,690
That's fine. That's fine !

1246
01:26:02,392 --> 01:26:04,790
Ladies and gentlemans,

1247
01:26:04,992 --> 01:26:07,190
here and listening at home,

1248
01:26:07,492 --> 01:26:10,490
the great state of Mississippi...

1249
01:26:10,692 --> 01:26:12,490
Pappy O'Daniel, Governor...

1250
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:18,390
wants to thank the Soggy Bottom Boys
for that wonderful performance.

1251
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:24,390
And it looks like the only man
in this great state

1252
01:26:24,692 --> 01:26:26,490
who ain't a music lover

1253
01:26:26,692 --> 01:26:30,190
is my esteemed opponent
in the upcoming, Homer Stokes.

1254
01:26:30,492 --> 01:26:32,890
There ain't no accounting for taste.

1255
01:26:34,392 --> 01:26:37,390
Sounded to me like he was harbouring
a hateful grudge

1256
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:39,290
against the Soggy Bottom Boys

1257
01:26:39,492 --> 01:26:41,890
on account of their
rough and rowdy past.

1258
01:26:43,992 --> 01:26:46,790
Looks like Homer Stokes
is the kind of fellow

1259
01:26:47,092 --> 01:26:49,290
who wants to cast the first stone.

1260
01:26:49,492 --> 01:26:52,090
Well, I'm with you, folks.

1261
01:26:52,292 --> 01:26:55,390
I'm a forgive-and-forget
Christian, and I say...

1262
01:26:55,592 --> 01:27:00,990
if their rambunctiousness
and misdemeanoring is behind them...

1263
01:27:01,192 --> 01:27:02,190
It is, ain't it ?

1264
01:27:02,392 --> 01:27:03,990
Yes, sir, it is.

1265
01:27:04,292 --> 01:27:06,090
Well, then, I say,

1266
01:27:06,392 --> 01:27:08,590
by the power vested in me,

1267
01:27:08,892 --> 01:27:13,090
these boys is hereby pardoned !

1268
01:27:15,692 --> 01:27:17,990
And furthermore...

1269
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:20,790
in the second
Pappy O'Daniel administration,

1270
01:27:21,092 --> 01:27:24,290
these boys is gonna be
my brain trust !

1271
01:27:28,492 --> 01:27:30,290
What's that mean, Everett ?

1272
01:27:30,492 --> 01:27:34,390
Well, it means you and me
and Pete and Tommy are gonna be

1273
01:27:34,592 --> 01:27:36,790
the power behind
the throne, so to speak.

1274
01:27:39,792 --> 01:27:44,190
So, without further ado,
and by way of endorsing my candidacy,

1275
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:45,990
the Soggy Bottom Boys

1276
01:27:46,192 --> 01:27:50,190
is gonna lead us all
in a chorus of "You Are My Sunshine".

1277
01:27:51,492 --> 01:27:54,090
Ain't you, boys ?

1278
01:27:54,092 --> 01:27:55,290
One of our favourites.

1279
01:27:55,492 --> 01:28:00,090
Son... you're gonna go far.

1280
01:28:00,092 --> 01:28:02,490
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

1281
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:04,990
<i>My only sunshine</i>

1282
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:07,690
<i>You make me happy</i>

1283
01:28:07,892 --> 01:28:10,090
<i>When skies are grey</i>

1284
01:28:10,392 --> 01:28:12,690
<i>You'll never know, dear</i>

1285
01:28:12,892 --> 01:28:15,490
<i>How much I love you</i>

1286
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,190
<i>Please don't take</i>

1287
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:21,790
<i>My sunshine away</i>

1288
01:28:24,092 --> 01:28:27,590
I guess Vernon T Waldrip
is gonna be going on relief.

1289
01:28:27,792 --> 01:28:30,490
Maybe I can throw
a little patronage his way,

1290
01:28:30,792 --> 01:28:33,590
get him a job digging
or rounding up stray dogs.

1291
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:36,190
So, is the marriage off,
Miss Wharvey ?

1292
01:28:36,492 --> 01:28:39,890
McGill. No. The marriage
will take place as planned.

1293
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,390
With a change of cast.

1294
01:28:41,592 --> 01:28:44,190
Me and the little lady
are gonna pick up the pieces

1295
01:28:44,392 --> 01:28:47,490
and re-tie the knot,
mixaphorically speaking.

1296
01:28:47,792 --> 01:28:49,790
You boys are invited, of course.

1297
01:28:49,992 --> 01:28:51,690
Hell, you're the best men.

1298
01:28:51,892 --> 01:28:54,090
I already got the rings.

1299
01:28:54,292 --> 01:28:57,790
- Where's your ring ?
- I ain't worn it since our divorce.

1300
01:28:57,992 --> 01:29:00,990
Must still be in
the roll-top in the old cabin.

1301
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:03,490
Vernon's was encrusted with jewels.

1302
01:29:03,692 --> 01:29:06,790
Now's the time
to buy it off him cheap.

1303
01:29:06,992 --> 01:29:10,590
We ain't getting married with
his ring. You said you'd changed.

1304
01:29:10,792 --> 01:29:13,190
- Just an old pewter thing.
- Ain't no wedding.

1305
01:29:13,392 --> 01:29:15,790
- It's just a symbol, honey.
- No wedding.

1306
01:29:15,992 --> 01:29:17,390
We'll fetch it with you.

1307
01:29:17,592 --> 01:29:20,390
It's just... Shut up, Delmar.
It's just a symbol.

1308
01:29:20,592 --> 01:29:23,990
I've spoken my piece
and counted to three.

1309
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:27,790
She counted to three. God damn it.

1310
01:29:28,092 --> 01:29:30,790
She counted to three. Son of a bitch !

1311
01:29:31,092 --> 01:29:33,490
You have any idea
how far that cabin is ?

1312
01:29:49,692 --> 01:29:50,890
George ?

1313
01:29:51,092 --> 01:29:52,690
Hello, boys !

1314
01:29:52,992 --> 01:29:56,990
These little men finally
caught the criminal of the century.

1315
01:29:57,192 --> 01:29:59,190
Looks like the chair
for George Nelson !

1316
01:29:59,492 --> 01:30:05,690
Yup, gonna electrify me.
I'm gonna go off like a roman candle !

1317
01:30:05,992 --> 01:30:09,290
20,000 volts chasing a rabbit
through yours truly !

1318
01:30:09,492 --> 01:30:13,090
Gonna suck all
the power right out of the state !

1319
01:30:13,292 --> 01:30:17,790
Gonna shoot sparks out of my head
and lightning from my fingertips !

1320
01:30:17,992 --> 01:30:22,190
I'm George Nelson,
and I'm feeling ten feet tall !

1321
01:30:22,392 --> 01:30:26,990
Looks like George
is right back on top again.

1322
01:30:27,192 --> 01:30:28,390
Cow killer !

1323
01:30:41,092 --> 01:30:44,590
Well, at least you boys get to see
the ancestral manse,

1324
01:30:44,892 --> 01:30:49,290
the home where I spent so many a
happy day in the bosom of my family

1325
01:30:49,492 --> 01:30:52,590
refugin', if you will,
with a mighty oak tree out front

1326
01:30:52,892 --> 01:30:57,190
and a happy little tyre swing on it.

1327
01:31:00,492 --> 01:31:05,290
Where's the happy
little tyre swing ?

1328
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:08,690
End of the road, boys.

1329
01:31:08,992 --> 01:31:10,990
- No. Wait a minute.
- Let's go, boys.

1330
01:31:11,192 --> 01:31:15,490
It's had its twists and turns,
now it deposits you here.

1331
01:31:15,792 --> 01:31:16,790
Wait a minute.

1332
01:31:17,092 --> 01:31:22,290
You have eluded fate and you have
eluded me for the last time.

1333
01:31:22,492 --> 01:31:25,390
- Tie their hands, boys.
- You can't do this, now.

1334
01:31:25,692 --> 01:31:28,390
Didn't know you'd be
bringing a friend.

1335
01:31:28,592 --> 01:31:32,490
He'll just have to wait his turn,
share one of your graves.

1336
01:31:32,692 --> 01:31:35,990
You can't do it, we just got
pardoned by the governor.

1337
01:31:36,192 --> 01:31:40,090
- It went out on the radio.
- Is that right ?

1338
01:31:42,992 --> 01:31:46,790
Well, we ain't got a radio.

1339
01:31:47,892 --> 01:31:51,590
God have mercy.

1340
01:31:54,692 --> 01:31:57,190
<i>You</i>

1341
01:31:57,392 --> 01:31:59,090
<i>Got to go</i>

1342
01:31:59,292 --> 01:32:01,990
<i>To that lonesome valley</i>

1343
01:32:02,192 --> 01:32:05,890
<i>You</i>

1344
01:32:06,092 --> 01:32:11,990
<i>Whoa, got...</i>

1345
01:32:12,192 --> 01:32:13,690
It ain't fittin'.

1346
01:32:13,892 --> 01:32:15,090
It ain't the law.

1347
01:32:15,392 --> 01:32:18,490
- The law ?
<i>- To go...</i>

1348
01:32:18,692 --> 01:32:21,690
The law is a human institution.

1349
01:32:21,992 --> 01:32:25,390
<i>Nobody else</i>

1350
01:32:25,592 --> 01:32:28,290
<i>Can go there for you, no...</i>

1351
01:32:28,592 --> 01:32:31,390
Perhaps you should start
making your prayers.

1352
01:32:36,392 --> 01:32:42,590
<i>Got</i>

1353
01:32:42,792 --> 01:32:44,390
<i>To go...</i>

1354
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:48,790
Oh, my God. Everett ?

1355
01:32:49,092 --> 01:32:52,390
Tommy, I'm sorry
we got you into this.

1356
01:32:52,592 --> 01:32:56,190
Good Lord... What do we do ?

1357
01:32:56,492 --> 01:33:02,290
<i>By yourself</i>

1358
01:33:05,892 --> 01:33:08,590
Oh, Lord...

1359
01:33:08,892 --> 01:33:13,590
Please look down
and recognise us poor sinners.

1360
01:33:15,092 --> 01:33:16,990
Please, Lord.

1361
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:20,890
I just want to see
my daughters again.

1362
01:33:21,192 --> 01:33:24,990
I've been separated
from my family for so long.

1363
01:33:25,192 --> 01:33:28,390
I know I've been guilty of pride
and sharp dealing.

1364
01:33:28,592 --> 01:33:30,790
I'm sorry I turned my back on you,

1365
01:33:30,992 --> 01:33:33,790
forgive me.

1366
01:33:33,992 --> 01:33:36,790
We're helpless, Lord.

1367
01:33:36,992 --> 01:33:40,390
For the sake of my family,
for Tommy's sake.

1368
01:33:40,592 --> 01:33:44,090
For Delmar's and Pete's.

1369
01:33:45,292 --> 01:33:49,190
Let me see my daughters again, Lord.

1370
01:33:49,592 --> 01:33:54,390
Help us, please.

1371
01:34:07,592 --> 01:34:11,590
<i>You got to go</i>

1372
01:34:11,792 --> 01:34:14,590
<i>To the lonesome valley</i>

1373
01:34:14,892 --> 01:34:23,790
<i>Yes, sir, you, whoa</i>

1374
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:29,090
<i>Got</i>

1375
01:34:29,392 --> 01:34:34,190
<i>To go</i>

1376
01:34:34,392 --> 01:34:37,590
<i>There</i>

1377
01:34:39,992 --> 01:34:43,590
<i>By</i>

1378
01:34:43,792 --> 01:34:46,190
<i>Yourself</i>

1379
01:34:46,392 --> 01:34:49,190
<i>Nobody else</i>

1380
01:34:49,392 --> 01:34:52,990
<i>Nobody else can go for you</i>

1381
01:34:53,192 --> 01:34:59,190
<i>You, whoa</i>

1382
01:35:01,392 --> 01:35:07,490
<i>Got</i>

1383
01:35:07,792 --> 01:35:11,690
<i>To go</i>

1384
01:35:11,992 --> 01:35:15,490
<i>There</i>

1385
01:35:17,992 --> 01:35:22,590
<i>By</i>

1386
01:35:22,792 --> 01:35:25,590
<i>Yourself</i>

1387
01:36:01,692 --> 01:36:05,390
- A miracle. It was a miracle !
- Delmar, don't be ignorant.

1388
01:36:05,592 --> 01:36:07,890
I told you they
was flooding this valley.

1389
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:11,390
- No ! That ain't it !
- We prayed to God and he pitied us !

1390
01:36:11,592 --> 01:36:12,990
Well, it never fails.

1391
01:36:13,192 --> 01:36:16,690
Again, you hayseeds
are showin' you want for intellect.

1392
01:36:16,992 --> 01:36:19,490
There's a perfectly
scientific explanation.

1393
01:36:19,792 --> 01:36:22,890
That ain't the tune you was singin'
back at the gallows !

1394
01:36:23,192 --> 01:36:26,090
Any human being'll cast about
in a moment of stress.

1395
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:28,190
No, they're flooding this valley

1396
01:36:28,392 --> 01:36:31,590
so they can hydroelectric
up the whole darn state.

1397
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:34,590
Yes, sir, the south is gonna change.

1398
01:36:34,792 --> 01:36:37,490
Everything's gonna
run on a paying basis.

1399
01:36:37,692 --> 01:36:41,890
Out with the spiritual mumbo-jumbo
and the backward ways.

1400
01:36:42,092 --> 01:36:47,090
We're gonna see a brave new world
where they hook us all up to a grid.

1401
01:36:47,392 --> 01:36:49,390
Yes, a veritable age of reason.

1402
01:36:49,592 --> 01:36:54,690
Like the one they had in France.
Not a moment too soon.

1403
01:36:57,592 --> 01:37:01,590
Not a moment too soon.

1404
01:37:01,892 --> 01:37:03,290
Hey, there's Tommy.

1405
01:37:03,492 --> 01:37:06,090
Tommy,
what you ridin' there ?

1406
01:37:09,492 --> 01:37:11,190
Roll-top desk.

1407
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:17,690
<i>My latest sun is sinking fast</i>

1408
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:20,090
<i>My race is nearly run...</i>

1409
01:37:20,392 --> 01:37:22,890
"All's well that ends well",
some poet said.

1410
01:37:23,192 --> 01:37:24,490
That's right, honey.

1411
01:37:24,792 --> 01:37:26,890
Don't mind telling you
I'm awful pleased

1412
01:37:27,092 --> 01:37:29,590
my adventuring days
have come to an end.

1413
01:37:29,892 --> 01:37:32,590
Time for this old boy
to enjoy some repose.

1414
01:37:32,792 --> 01:37:34,190
That's good, honey.

1415
01:37:34,392 --> 01:37:36,390
You were right about that ring, too.

1416
01:37:36,592 --> 01:37:39,390
Any other wedding band wouldn't do.

1417
01:37:39,592 --> 01:37:41,290
This here was fore-ordained.

1418
01:37:41,492 --> 01:37:43,190
Fate was a-smilin' on me.

1419
01:37:43,392 --> 01:37:45,090
That's not my ring.

1420
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:48,890
- What ? Not your ring ?
- That's one of Aunt Herlene's.

1421
01:37:49,192 --> 01:37:51,890
- You said it was in the roll-top.
- I said I thought it was.

1422
01:37:52,092 --> 01:37:54,490
- No, you said...
- Or under the mattress.

1423
01:37:54,792 --> 01:37:56,390
Or maybe in my chifforobe.

1424
01:37:56,592 --> 01:37:59,190
Well, I'm sorry, honey.

1425
01:37:59,392 --> 01:38:00,690
We need that ring.

1426
01:38:00,992 --> 01:38:03,290
It's at the bottom
of a durn big lake.

1427
01:38:03,592 --> 01:38:05,590
- Uh-uh.
- A 9,000 hectare lake.

1428
01:38:05,792 --> 01:38:09,190
I don't care if it's 90,000.
That lake was not my doing.

1429
01:38:09,392 --> 01:38:12,390
- I've counted to three.
- No, wait, honey.

1430
01:38:12,692 --> 01:38:15,390
Finding one ring
in the middle of all that water

1431
01:38:15,692 --> 01:38:21,890
- is one hell of a heroic task !
<i>- ...And gives me victory</i>

1432
01:38:22,192 --> 01:38:26,990
<i>O, come, angel band</i>

01:38:27,192 --> 01:38:28,990

1452
01:40:15,292 --> 01:40:20,990
<i>Whose blood
now cleanses from all sin</i>

1453
01:40:21,192 --> 01:40:26,990
