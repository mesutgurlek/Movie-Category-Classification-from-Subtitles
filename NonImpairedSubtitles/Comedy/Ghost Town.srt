1
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:01,607
Hello?
Is anybody there?

2
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:05,642
Hey, honey, what's up?

3
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:08,841
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?

4
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:12,352
No, I don't know! Sweetheart,
I don't have a clue what you're...

5
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:14,143
An apartment?

6
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:19,022
No, no! Of course I'm not
looking at an apartment!

7
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:21,721
Why would I be
looking at an apartment?

8
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:25,127
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.

9
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:29,932
Oldest trick in the book. Yeah.
Did a realtor call you? Yeah.

10
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:33,440
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says,
"Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.

11
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:35,634
"I'm looking at a... "

12
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:38,837
My card? My business card?
I don't know.

13
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:43,546
That I don't know. I don't know
why he has my business card.

14
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:44,982
Maybe he...

15
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:48,345
Maybe he or she, then.

16
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:51,788
Yeah.

17
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:54,157
Okay, surprise ruined.

18
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:55,627
No, no, it's all right.

19
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:57,687
It was gonna be for our anniversary,
but I...

20
00:01:57,765 --> 00:01:59,858
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom
in the West Village,

21
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:01,195
but you're gonna love it.

22
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:03,759
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

23
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,203
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up
for this thing at the Waldorf.

24
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:09,401
I got to go. I'll see you
at home tonight, okay, honey?

25
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:11,944
I love you, too.

26
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:14,412
It's okay. Big kiss.

27
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:16,506
All right, then. Bye-bye.

28
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:26,450
Hey, let me ask you a question.

29
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,654
You a real estate broker
or a professional fucking idiot?

30
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:33,832
Babe, I really think
we ought to let the super do that.

31
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:35,664
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.

32
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:38,204
No, I did not say
my wife needs to see the apartment.

33
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:41,708
I said Amber needs
to see the apartment. Amber.

34
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,869
Amber sound like the wife
of a man my age to you?

35
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:47,477
- Careful with my table!
- Yeah, picked it up right now.

36
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:48,606
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?

37
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,843
Okay, all right. I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?

38
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:52,943
Just keep it out of my way.

39
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:55,282
Well, it's not exactly a love nest

40
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:57,915
if my wife's there picking out
the goddamned curtains, is it?

41
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:59,959
Careful, just get the window,
get the window.

42
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:01,426
- Okay?
- Ready?

43
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:03,019
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.

44
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:06,191
No, I'm telling you right now,
stop talking.

45
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,790
Because I'm thinking.

46
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:11,895
No, I'm thinking! I don't...
You know what? Just kill it.

47
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:14,236
No, kill it. Kill the whole thing.

48
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:17,607
- There, good.
- See? DIY. "Do It Yourself. "

49
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:18,906
Oh, no!

50
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:24,817
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine

51
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:26,648
saying the seller's
had a change of heart,

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,120
and that the whole thing's...

53
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:31,248
- Oh, my God!
... dead.

54
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:39,029
You are not gonna believe
what almost just happened!

55
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:45,094
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!

56
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,737
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
- He ain't happy.

57
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:03,387
What?

58
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:10,527
You cannot be serious!

59
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:16,267
Not now.

60
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:34,537
Okay, go ahead and spit.

61
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:41,185
So, anyway, the very first scene
just takes your breath away.

62
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:43,849
You have to remind yourself that
you're in the theater watching a play.

63
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:47,257
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.

64
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:50,023
He wanted his father to see it with us.

65
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:53,926
That's better.

66
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:57,596
Anyway, I think he really,
really enjoyed the costumes...

67
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:01,470
Dr. Pincus? Hi.

68
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,839
I'm gonna need
the panoramic X-ray machine

69
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,104
for most of the morning tomorrow,

70
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:07,544
so if that fits in
with your appointments...

71
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:09,582
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.

72
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,844
Really?

73
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,546
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.

74
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:20,451
And?

75
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:25,764
No, I just thought that maybe
you were taking the day off to go and...

76
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:31,699
Right. Sorry to bother you.

77
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:36,875
You know, we brought some cake.

78
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:40,678
Mrs. Prashar and I
just had our baby, so...

79
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:45,278
Yeah, it's a girl,

80
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:52,053
and we're having a little cake and
I brought some pictures, so, if you...

81
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,956
That'd be delightful.

82
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:57,657
Start without me.

83
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:02,797
Great, great. Okay, so...

84
00:07:08,475 --> 00:07:10,705
What a cute baby. She is so cute.

85
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:12,938
- Yeah, she really is.
- How long was the labor?

86
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:14,776
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?

87
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,076
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

88
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:19,915
- That seems like a really long time.
- No, not really.

89
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,715
- It's not?
- Not really.

90
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:23,847
- See, that's, like, too long.
- It's so worth it.

91
00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:26,415
I'll just get a cat, you know?

92
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:30,589
Like, 10 hours is a long time
to get something, you know?

93
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:32,063
- Look at that.
- So cute.

94
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,205
Stop global warming?

95
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:57,480
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.

96
00:07:57,557 --> 00:07:59,354
Good evening, Doctor.

97
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:02,618
You know what? Let me just open it.

98
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:08,059
Hey! Can you hold the elevator?
Please?

99
00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:10,933
- Yeah. Holding.
- Thank you.

100
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,303
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold. Hey! Hey!

101
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,282
Good. Still some more.

102
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:46,123
Come on, come on, come on,

103
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:48,292
make it, make it, make it,
make it, make it, make it.

104
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:51,735
<i>Paging Dr. Michael,
Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.</i>

105
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:53,500
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.

106
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:54,631
I appreciate it.

107
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,768
- Spell it.
- P-I-N-C-U-S.

108
00:09:57,844 --> 00:10:00,438
- Date of birth?
- Why?

109
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:01,913
What day were you born?

110
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:04,780
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?

111
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:07,376
Let's leave it blank. Weight?

112
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:09,354
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.

113
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:11,083
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.

114
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:13,523
Number of alcoholic beverages
consumed per week?

115
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:15,959
- Why do you need to know that?
- Well, they want to know.

116
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,496
Well, I'm sure
"they" want to know a lot of things,

117
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:19,259
but I don't want my intimate details

118
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:21,527
auctioned off to the highest bidder,
willy-nilly.

119
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:22,795
I'll put zero.

120
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:24,860
- Marital status?
- Pass.

121
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,872
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.

122
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,205
- Food allergies?
- I'm not gonna be eating here.

123
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:33,246
- Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
- What a ludicrous question.

124
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:34,610
I'm not answering
any more of these, really.

125
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,308
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.

126
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:38,408
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.

127
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:43,252
- When was the last time you ate?
- A pertinent question at last.

128
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:45,223
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.

129
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:47,419
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...

130
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:50,588
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.

131
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:52,063
Did it work?

132
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:56,127
It was as advertised.

133
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:58,363
Did you evacuate your bowels?

134
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:01,464
I drank copious amounts
of drain-cleaning fluid.

135
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,406
<i>What followed was fait accompli.</i>

136
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:05,000
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...

137
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:10,243
I shat. Okay? Good. Again and again.

138
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:13,844
It was like a terrorist attack down there
in the darkness and the chaos,

139
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,751
the running and the screaming, okay?

140
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:18,313
- Fine with me.
- Good.

141
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,484
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.

142
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,051
Wait till they get you in the back.

143
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:26,757
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.

144
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,164
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.

145
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,065
We'll have you up
and on your feet in no time.

146
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:31,160
- Okay.
- Quick question.

147
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:33,330
I notice you requested
a general anesthetic.

148
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,897
It's not really typical
for this type of procedure.

149
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:37,534
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.

150
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:40,409
I have no intention of being around
when they go where they're going.

151
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,675
When does the surgeon arrive?

152
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:43,977
I'm the surgeon.

153
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,847
- Really?
- Yeah.

154
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,477
- Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.

155
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:50,022
I got a spray tan
on my way to work today.

156
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,923
- Looks natural.
- Yes. It's better for you.

157
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:55,086
It's moisturizing
and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...

158
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:56,253
Yeah.

159
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:58,524
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.

160
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:01,431
- I don't know if...
- No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!

161
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,162
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.

162
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:06,569
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.

163
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,404
- You gonna go darker?
- I think I am. I think I'd like to go darker.

164
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:11,103
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.

165
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:13,668
You could get your teeth whitened
like I did.

166
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:14,873
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.

167
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:18,076
Yeah, I don't like having trays
in my mouth and my teeth are small.

168
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:19,482
Sorry, you babbling idiots.

169
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:22,851
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?

170
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:25,152
Looks like the sodium thiopental's
really kicking in, huh?

171
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:28,194
- Makes people say crazy things.
- I haven't given it to him yet.

172
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,354
- Going in now.
- How old are you?

173
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,160
So are you here on a school field trip?

174
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,859
Not a real people person are you,
Dr. Pincus?

175
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:39,598
Not really. Given a choice between
a few people and loads of people,

176
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,971
I choose my cat. She hunts dwarves.

177
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,942
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.

178
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,477
You can see their little legs going.

179
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:48,343
Sounds like Norah Jones
when she plays the piano.

180
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:58,923
Wow, you must be excited
to get home and see your cat.

181
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:00,050
What cat?

182
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:01,991
I thought yesterday
you said you had a cat.

183
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:06,658
I despise cats. What sort of men
waste their affection on a cat? Pathetic.

184
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:09,167
I had a cat once,
when I was a little girl.

185
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:11,999
My father, right before he died,
he took me to the shelter and he said,

186
00:13:12,072 --> 00:13:13,369
"Debra, take a look
at all these lonely cats... "

187
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,305
What a wonderful man
he must have been.

188
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,467
Now, listen.

189
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:18,033
All those people in my room last night,

190
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:19,806
I thought I was dreaming at first,
but I wasn't.

191
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,369
Who were they?

192
00:13:22,082 --> 00:13:24,346
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.

193
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:28,080
- Here you go. Clean bill of health.
- All right, thank you.

194
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:31,280
Come back soon!

195
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:34,258
What a terrible thing to say
in a hospital.

196
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:48,967
Nice.

197
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:52,645
Fine example for healthcare workers.

198
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:55,909
Still, I suppose
smoking serves a purpose.

199
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:59,474
- Thins the herd. Weeds out the stupid.
- Are you speaking to me?

200
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:01,452
Yeah, but I was having a go at them,
not you.

201
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:02,783
Oh, good.

202
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:06,587
I picked one that should be
in a straightjacket. My mistake.

203
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,962
Show it some attention,
it follows you home. Unbelievable.

204
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:20,300
Sorry!

205
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:26,007
Did he see you, too?

206
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:32,315
- He can see us!
- Who?

207
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:33,682
That guy?

208
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:42,394
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?

209
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,098
Hey!

210
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,606
Hey, mister!

211
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:57,272
Please, just hold up!

212
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,968
- Idiot. Get out of the road.
- Wait! Hey!

213
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:03,072
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!

214
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,947
...of your time!

215
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:11,786
You can see me, huh?

216
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,523
And you're not like us.

217
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:18,689
I know you're not, because back there,
that cab almost hit you!

218
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:21,598
And he honked at you,
and he yelled at you!

219
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:24,831
I don't feel well. Why on earth...

220
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:27,231
Hey!

221
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,578
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.

222
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,447
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.

223
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,749
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.

224
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:44,051
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!

225
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:45,613
Hey, don't be scared! I'm a cop!

226
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:47,853
- He can see us?
- Who? That guy?

227
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:21,219
...from the moment I left the hospital.

228
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:24,058
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.

229
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,859
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.

230
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:31,336
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.

231
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:35,204
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know? Really.

232
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:38,941
Not having hallucinations,
I'd have thought.

233
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:42,311
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure?

234
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:44,009
- Did any...
- Did any what...

235
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,745
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?

236
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:49,219
- Why do you just keep talking while...
- I didn't hear what...

237
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:52,417
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...

238
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:55,655
- Did anything unusual happen...
- You kind of interrupted me a little bit.

239
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,320
- Just answer the...
- Just.

240
00:16:57,397 --> 00:16:59,160
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?

241
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:02,793
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper... Yes or no?

242
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:04,769
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure?

243
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:05,861
- Yeah.
- What?

244
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,964
- No.
- You said "yes" first.

245
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:13,411
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.

246
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:18,182
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure?

247
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:21,118
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...

248
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:23,212
Can you hold on a second?

249
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:27,048
Yeah, it's me.

250
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:31,494
Can you stop what you're doing
and come down here right away?

251
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:35,894
It's that thing that we talked about.

252
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,462
Yeah, well, you told me to call you
if it came back, and it came back, so...

253
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,905
Okay.

254
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:44,603
What was that? What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.

255
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:48,807
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.

256
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,681
You... Miss!

257
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:52,775
- Yes?
- Me!

258
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:55,480
- What the... What?
- Can you...

259
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,180
- Can I... Yes.
- Follow you?

260
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:59,019
- To the...
- To my office.

261
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:01,424
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.

262
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:05,790
What?

263
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:11,599
Did anything unusual... What?

264
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:15,907
Jesus Christ! Sorry, I wasn't...

265
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:20,273
We have a meeting in a couple minutes,
so we just have to be quick.

266
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:26,884
Did anything unusual happen
during my procedure? What's he...

267
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:29,285
Can you please define "unusual"?

268
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:34,025
Out of the ordinary,
bizarre, unanticipated.

269
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:39,454
No, this went well.

270
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:42,228
- It was good. Okay, normal.
- Right.

271
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:44,496
Yes, good. Well, the cessation maybe,

272
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,403
- but after that, you responded...
- The cessation of what?

273
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:49,964
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that

274
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:52,773
every medical procedure
doesn't follow the same path.

275
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:53,869
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.

276
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:56,278
There are subtle variations
in even the simplest surgical...

277
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:59,113
What would a subtle variation be
in my case, for example?

278
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:02,177
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.

279
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:05,418
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.

280
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:07,789
...medically, it's beginning...

281
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:13,060
Okay. Yeah.

282
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:15,123
- You died.
- I died?

283
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:17,362
- Little bit.
- For how long?

284
00:19:17,437 --> 00:19:19,337
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.

285
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:20,667
I died for seven minutes.

286
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,764
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...

287
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:23,934
That's really the only thing
that I can think of...

288
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,240
How did I die?

289
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:29,975
For the record, we did not recommend
that you use the general anesthesia.

290
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:33,883
When you use anesthesia,
there is a chance, although it is small,

291
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:36,922
of a biochemical anomaly.

292
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:39,787
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.

293
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,292
He does not work here anymore.

294
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,351
You'll be happy to know
that at Saint Victor's,

295
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,296
we have a very strict
three-strikes policy.

296
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:50,300
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?

297
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,236
Okay, let's all calm down.

298
00:19:53,306 --> 00:19:56,935
Let's just not overdramatize
the situation.

299
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,909
Why is he calming down?

300
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,471
Everybody dies.

301
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:09,010
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life,
and just the once and forever.

302
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,749
Everybody's different.

303
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:12,586
And you weren't even gonna tell me.

304
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:14,558
- No, we did tell you. We told you...
- No, you didn't.

305
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:16,527
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.

306
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:19,895
- No, I don't remember that.
- Yes. Yeah, we...

307
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:24,300
It says here that you gurgled to me

308
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,272
before you rolled your eyes back
in your head, a little bit.

309
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:36,442
Have you any idea
how much I'm gonna sue you for?

310
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:38,848
- Nothing, I'm afraid.
- He's perked up. Go on.

311
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:41,045
You signed a general release
and a quitclaim form,

312
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,247
relieving your surgeon,
your anesthesiologist,

313
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:46,018
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative
Institutional Health Partners

314
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:47,389
from any liability related

315
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,485
to your anesthetic-induced cessation
of heart function.

316
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:51,187
I definitely did not.

317
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:54,324
- Is this your signature at the bottom?
- When did I sign that?

318
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,834
Right after you passed
the post-operative responsiveness test,

319
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:58,803
legally mandated
by the state of New York.

320
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:01,032
Obviously I didn't know
what I was doing!

321
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:02,734
You knew enough to sign your name.

322
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:05,709
I dotted the "I" with
a little love heart!

323
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:08,212
You were happy to be alive, right?

324
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:12,843
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?

325
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:14,113
People.

326
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:33,361
Hey, got a sec?

327
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:40,011
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?

328
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,207
No. I'm not the guy.
It's another guy. Go away.

329
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:45,273
Real quick, got to
hit you up for a favor.

330
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:48,115
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there. Unbelievable.

331
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:51,088
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent. Thank you!

332
00:21:51,157 --> 00:21:52,749
Hey. Wait a minute. Wait, what?

333
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:55,157
- Drive!
- No, no, no.

334
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:57,059
- Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!

335
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,427
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.

336
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,398
That woman whose cab
you just snaked, that's my wife.

337
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:03,264
- That's perfect.
- My widow.

338
00:22:03,336 --> 00:22:07,170
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.

339
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,674
- Where do you want to go, pal?
- Tell him 54th and Madison.

340
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:11,607
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!

341
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:13,076
Okay, that narrows it down.

342
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:15,077
I don't want a Sapphire martini
up with olives.

343
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:17,342
Okay, that narrows it down.

344
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,043
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool
out of yourself.

345
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:21,143
You can't talk to me
when somebody's standing there.

346
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,882
- Campari and soda.
- Campari soda.

347
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,948
No.

348
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,361
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.

349
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:33,125
Pimm's Cup? Pimm's?

350
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,723
- Just get a real drink.
- Shut the fuck up!

351
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,461
Okay! Sorry.

352
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:40,471
Can I have the first thing I said?

353
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,871
Sapphire martini up with olives.

354
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:49,507
- Shut up.
- Wow. You need to adjust, right?

355
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:51,015
No, it's okay, it's okay.

356
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,551
It's okay. You need a little
time to adjust. I get it.

357
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,052
I haven't done jack in 14 months.

358
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:58,716
- I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
- I died today!

359
00:23:01,193 --> 00:23:02,854
What do you mean?

360
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:06,157
- I was dead. For seven minutes.
- Yeah?

361
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:08,899
And then when they brought me back,
I can...

362
00:23:08,968 --> 00:23:11,835
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.

363
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:13,667
I mean, they're everywhere,

364
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:16,367
and they're a noisy,
pushy, demanding bunch,

365
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:19,104
same as when they were alive,
and frustrated, too.

366
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:20,577
The dead have
a lot of unfinished business,

367
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:22,511
which is why we're still here.

368
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:24,776
And normally, we can't talk to the living

369
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,216
and, suddenly, you come along,
and you can imagine.

370
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:29,186
A lot of excitement.

371
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:31,416
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maître d'?

372
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:33,287
- I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
- You shouldn't.

373
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,691
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.

374
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:38,093
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.

375
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:39,495
- Drink your drink.
- I'm gonna drink my drink.

376
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:41,556
- All right.
- Just shut up.

377
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:44,235
Aesthetically pleasing.

378
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:47,030
Am I still dead?
I'm still dead, aren't I?

379
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:49,199
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.

380
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:52,244
I'm lying on the operating table,
they're gonna bring me around, and...

381
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:54,176
It's all gonna be a dream.

382
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:58,148
Yeah. Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.

383
00:23:58,217 --> 00:24:01,311
Have a drink. Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.

384
00:24:01,387 --> 00:24:04,584
- You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- I guess.

385
00:24:04,657 --> 00:24:05,885
What, have you got a signal?

386
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,983
- Not yet, but I keep trying.
- Not yet.

387
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,086
Thank goodness
I downloaded Tetris before I went.

388
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:13,222
Damn it! How'd you die?

389
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:15,461
Something went wrong
with the anesthetic.

390
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:17,627
I went in for a colonoscopy
and it went all...

391
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:18,727
Yeah, I never got one of those.

392
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:19,828
I don't think
you have to worry about it now.

393
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:22,203
- What kind of anesthetic did they use?
- They didn't want to use any.

394
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:23,263
- What?
- Yeah.

395
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:24,707
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

396
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:27,610
- Expected me...
- What about your ass feelings?

397
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,673
Don't actually say "ass feelings. "
I knew what you meant with that.

398
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:34,584
- If we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
- We're not gonna be hanging out!

399
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:36,450
May I ask you a question, young man?

400
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:39,650
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.

401
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:42,626
- She won't speak to her sister...
- Back off, Marjorie!

402
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:44,925
All right? I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.

403
00:24:44,997 --> 00:24:47,727
I certainly see no harm
in making a request of the young man.

404
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,529
How about the fact
that I found him first?

405
00:24:49,602 --> 00:24:53,663
Look what you did. You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.

406
00:25:06,652 --> 00:25:09,280
Yeah, very good. I know you're there.

407
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:12,051
Let's start over, huh? Come on.

408
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:13,955
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.

409
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:16,517
You do yoga? You do yoga?

410
00:25:16,595 --> 00:25:18,495
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.

411
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:20,759
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.

412
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,266
Did I say I was a perfect person?

413
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:24,928
- Come on, let's hail a cab. She's hot.
- You don't exist, okay?

414
00:25:25,004 --> 00:25:27,837
You're the bizarre aftereffects
of some poorly-administered anesthetic.

415
00:25:27,907 --> 00:25:30,205
I'm gonna go home to bed,
and when I wake up in the morning,

416
00:25:30,276 --> 00:25:32,176
with any luck, you'll be gone.

417
00:25:32,244 --> 00:25:33,905
That would be truly rotten luck
for my wife

418
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:36,140
who just needs a little bit of your help.

419
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:39,048
- If you would come through for me...
- I'm not listening anymore.

420
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:41,780
Hey, I don't want to play hardball
with you, but I will if I have to.

421
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:43,344
- It's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.

422
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:46,050
Pincus? Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.

423
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,615
- It's my wife, okay? She lives right...
- Widow.

424
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:49,593
She lives right here in this building,
all right?

425
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:50,890
She's getting married
in a couple of months

426
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:53,227
to a real scumbag lawyer,
a bad, bad guy.

427
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:54,323
Somebody's got to stop this.

428
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,732
What do you care?
You were having an affair.

429
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:59,896
Never been married, right? Okay.
You need time.

430
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:02,440
- It's all right, I can take a hint.
- It's not a hint.

431
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:05,443
- Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
- Just go to hell.

432
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:54,921
- What?
- Is this a bad time?

433
00:26:54,994 --> 00:26:56,757
My letter went under the carpet.

434
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:59,297
He lost something important,
and I know where it is.

435
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:01,925
She won't wear a helmet
because of me, but that's nuts!

436
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:07,262
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor,

437
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:10,638
did I accidentally give everybody
your home address?

438
00:27:16,682 --> 00:27:19,207
If you don't help her, she won't...

439
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:23,682
I got to tell you, nobody was
more excited than Naked Guy. He's...

440
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,022
Leave me alone.

441
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:37,332
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!

442
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:40,133
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry. Never mind.

443
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:45,175
- Bless you.
- Oh, God. Thank you.

444
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:51,739
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

445
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:53,678
- Bless you.
- Stop it.

446
00:27:53,752 --> 00:27:56,744
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you. Just...

447
00:27:56,822 --> 00:28:00,189
I'm not very well. It's not you.
It's a bit you.

448
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:04,924
Mainly... You can't... But you're adding.

449
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:11,235
Don't you see, Pincus,
there's a reason I'm here and this is it.

450
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:15,603
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen,
trying to get his hands on her money.

451
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:17,198
I left her a good chunk of change,
you know.

452
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:19,972
- My head. It's throbbing.
- I'm like her guardian angel.

453
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:21,535
You can be
the guardian angel's assistant.

454
00:28:21,614 --> 00:28:22,603
- Pass.
- What?

455
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:23,807
You don't want to help me
earn my wings?

456
00:28:23,882 --> 00:28:25,110
I don't care.

457
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:28,483
- You don't want to at least help Gwen?
- She's beyond help, okay?

458
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:29,919
She chose you, didn't she?

459
00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:32,549
And now she's got a new slimeball,
and if that doesn't work out,

460
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,525
I'm sure another Mr. Wrong
will come along,

461
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:35,821
'cause that seems to be her thing.

462
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:38,192
Now, leave me alone.

463
00:28:38,263 --> 00:28:40,424
I've got a crown at 8:00 a. m.

464
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:45,564
I see! I understand, I get it.

465
00:28:45,638 --> 00:28:48,937
- What? What do you get?
- You. Just this whole self-loathing thing.

466
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:50,976
- No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.

467
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:52,704
Frankie spent some time on the couch.

468
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:54,370
You know, dentists have
one of the highest suicide rates

469
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:55,504
of any other profession.

470
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:56,980
But this might really give you a chance

471
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:59,074
- to connect with another human being...
- Shut up. Shut up!

472
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:02,211
Okay? Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit! I like what I do.

473
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:03,982
Do you know why? It suits me.

474
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:06,115
Because 90% of the people
I come into contact with

475
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:08,125
have cotton wool
shoved in their mouths.

476
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:10,218
I'm not interested
in their political opinions.

477
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:12,160
<i>I don't care
what they thought of Spamalot.</i>

478
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:15,928
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!

479
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:18,732
You are a sad little man.

480
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:21,204
- And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
- No, no, I'm not a bigamist.

481
00:29:21,273 --> 00:29:22,638
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.

482
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:26,007
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.

483
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:29,536
Come on. You don't think
I'm gonna find you in a hotel?

484
00:29:33,252 --> 00:29:34,844
This is crazy, all right?

485
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,912
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal. Okay?

486
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,720
I'll talk to them for you,
get them to leave you alone.

487
00:29:40,793 --> 00:29:43,387
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.

488
00:29:43,462 --> 00:29:44,520
Did.

489
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:47,627
Look, you do this one thing for me,

490
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,601
you'll never see any of us
ever again, okay?

491
00:29:52,805 --> 00:29:54,329
Problem solved.

492
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:58,210
Yeah, okay.

493
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,608
<i>The mummy's been examined
by virologists,</i>

494
00:30:04,683 --> 00:30:06,947
<i>oncologists, forensic
pathologists,</i>

495
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:09,283
<i>searching for signs of foul play,</i>

496
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:13,950
but Pepi the Third's cause of death
at the relatively young age of 23

497
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:15,653
still remains a mystery.

498
00:30:15,728 --> 00:30:17,491
It can't be that hard
to break up a relationship.

499
00:30:17,563 --> 00:30:19,326
I used to screw
these things up all the time.

500
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:22,492
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to
seduce him and videotape it, you know?

501
00:30:22,568 --> 00:30:23,728
That woman lives in my building?

502
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:26,771
Or we send her an anonymous letter
from his other family.

503
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,500
- I've never seen her before.
- One of those things?

504
00:30:28,574 --> 00:30:31,202
- You stole her cab, remember?
- I've never noticed her, then.

505
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:33,676
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.

506
00:30:33,746 --> 00:30:35,771
What are you, a brain in a jar?

507
00:30:35,848 --> 00:30:37,816
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.

508
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:39,043
- Really?
- Yes.

509
00:30:39,118 --> 00:30:43,919
And the grand manner in which
Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved

510
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:48,221
also suggests that he was embalmed
by royal mummifiers,

511
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:51,729
as opposed to
curbside-marketplace perverts...

512
00:30:51,797 --> 00:30:53,196
Preservists.

513
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:55,226
That's awkward.

514
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,792
I suppose
the simplest way to break it up

515
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:01,738
would be to plant a seed of doubt
in her mind.

516
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:04,867
- Give her another option.
- I don't get it.

517
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:07,605
- Present her with an alternative.
- Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.

518
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,408
You mean hire
a good-looking male model...

519
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:12,143
Don't hire anyone. Don't...
No, don't need...

520
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:14,583
- Don't need a male model or a fireman.
- Somebody handsome, right?

521
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:17,451
Not too handsome. Not chiseled,
just approachable. Sort of...

522
00:31:17,523 --> 00:31:19,855
'Cause I was thinking, like,
rugged and somebody tough.

523
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:22,985
...round-faced,
if anything and sensitive.

524
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:24,722
Well, he's gonna have to have
a lot of cash, though.

525
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:26,287
If he's sensible with his money,

526
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:28,196
he's probably invested well,
and that would be attractive.

527
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:29,928
- Really?
- Yeah.

528
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:31,629
- She might like that.
- Yeah.

529
00:31:31,703 --> 00:31:33,466
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.

530
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,632
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no. Average.

531
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:38,403
- Really?
- Yeah. Bordering on the short.

532
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:41,269
Oh, my word, you mean you.

533
00:31:46,552 --> 00:31:47,883
- I'm... Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Forget it.

534
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:52,151
Don't walk away mad!
Come here! Pink-Ass!

535
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:59,186
I would like to elaborate further on
Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site. Here...

536
00:31:59,431 --> 00:32:00,989
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

537
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:04,968
That's okay. I mean, a lot of great ideas
sound completely ridiculous at first.

538
00:32:05,037 --> 00:32:06,231
Sorry I even brought it up.

539
00:32:06,305 --> 00:32:09,468
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.

540
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:11,338
I mean, all you're gonna have to do
is be charming enough

541
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,971
to give her a few second thoughts,
you know?

542
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,638
Be a challenge.

543
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,445
Almost impossible.

544
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:23,020
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.

545
00:32:23,088 --> 00:32:27,684
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.

546
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:33,992
- Really. I can do this. I can do it.
- Forget it.

547
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:35,863
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?

548
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:38,869
- Good God, no.
- No? You got a girlfriend?

549
00:32:38,937 --> 00:32:43,499
No, just between us, currently.

550
00:32:44,576 --> 00:32:49,479
- So you use hookers.
- No, I don't use hookers.

551
00:32:49,548 --> 00:32:52,483
We've also conducted
extensive CT scans

552
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:55,884
to search for orthopedic trauma,
which may have led to infection,

553
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:59,082
as you may remember was the case
with Tutankhamen

554
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:01,990
as shown here on slide 43.

555
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,288
Nope, nope, you know what?

556
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:04,920
It's possible
that she could actually go for you.

557
00:33:04,997 --> 00:33:09,491
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...

558
00:33:09,568 --> 00:33:10,865
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

559
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:14,064
- Twice a week. Free weights.
- Okay. All right.

560
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:16,766
- You got a nice, thick head of hair.
- Protein shampoo.

561
00:33:16,842 --> 00:33:18,139
- She's gonna like that.
- Yeah.

562
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,939
- Look after your scalp.
- Right.

563
00:33:20,012 --> 00:33:22,139
All we got to do is find a way
to get you two together, you know?

564
00:33:22,214 --> 00:33:27,151
At her apartment, you show up as
the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...

565
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:29,813
- You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
- No.

566
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:34,291
I was inclined to regard this injury
as the result of attempts by plunderers

567
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:37,055
to hastily remove
the wrappings from the mummy.

568
00:33:37,129 --> 00:33:38,153
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

569
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,697
I'm gonna go over there
when she's finished,

570
00:33:39,765 --> 00:33:42,427
and strike up a conversation with her.

571
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:45,331
- Yeah.
- I know.

572
00:33:46,972 --> 00:33:49,372
- What?
- I don't know.

573
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:52,102
I'm just thinking,
in the smock, better not.

574
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:53,508
- Yes. I came straight from work.
- Okay.

575
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:56,570
- I'm a dentist. This is what we wear.
- Yeah. Yeah.

576
00:33:56,648 --> 00:34:00,140
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.

577
00:34:01,153 --> 00:34:04,919
And remember that the show officially
opens on Friday, the 12th.

578
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,788
Thank you,
thank you very much for coming.

579
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,596
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.

580
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:19,967
- Oh, really? Did she?
- Oh, yeah.

581
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:23,866
Good, all right.

582
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:29,270
I owe you an apology.

583
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:35,575
Do you mean for stealing my cab
or for not holding the elevator?

584
00:34:36,254 --> 00:34:37,812
- Don't remember the second one.
- Oh, no, no. I know.

585
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,481
Maybe it was for that time that

586
00:34:39,558 --> 00:34:42,550
you told the super that
somebody down on nine was cooking

587
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:45,960
stenchy ethnic food
that stings the eyes?

588
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:48,329
- Was that you?
- It was tacos.

589
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,336
They told me that any complaints
would be kept anonymous.

590
00:34:52,437 --> 00:34:56,430
Or, you know, maybe it was for
the eight or ten times that I said,

591
00:34:56,508 --> 00:35:00,205
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever,
and you never even looked at me.

592
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:02,579
I'm a very private person.

593
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:05,639
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.

594
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:09,580
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.

595
00:35:12,824 --> 00:35:16,851
- I enjoyed your lecture very much.
- Thank you.

596
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:22,300
- Don't take the walk-outs personally.
- I hadn't noticed.

597
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:25,962
But, you know,
thank you for that encouragement.

598
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:28,973
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?

599
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:34,471
- Atrocious dental hygiene.
- I'm sorry?

600
00:35:34,546 --> 00:35:37,515
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.

601
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:39,277
He was no flosser.

602
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,010
Dental humor.

603
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:47,114
Is there something else?

604
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:56,132
Shoes. Your shoes are comfortable.

605
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:58,294
Bye.

606
00:36:02,374 --> 00:36:04,274
<i>I knew you were
gonna come off scary.</i>

607
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:06,503
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.

608
00:36:06,578 --> 00:36:09,172
- Right, and it scared her.
- I'm not scary!

609
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:10,839
Don't make eye contact.

610
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,180
Let me... No, no, no.
Let me preface this.

611
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:15,116
- What the hell is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.

612
00:36:15,187 --> 00:36:16,745
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- No, no.

613
00:36:16,822 --> 00:36:18,949
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.

614
00:36:19,024 --> 00:36:20,753
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.

615
00:36:20,826 --> 00:36:24,057
- Yeah, they suck.
- Would you quit banging that drum?

616
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:27,223
What's the drama? Some big, bad lady
went and broke your heart?

617
00:36:27,332 --> 00:36:28,526
Well, get over it. It's in the past.

618
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,897
You know nothing about my past,
do you?

619
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:32,334
I know you got to forget about this
and let it go.

620
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:33,769
It's not helping you out there.

621
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,306
Listen, the thing with women
is that they...

622
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:38,001
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.

623
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:41,511
You know, for the sake of time,
I'm gonna agree with that insane point,

624
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,810
and say, "Yeah, you do great
with women. You do great. "

625
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:47,079
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.

626
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:51,050
And she likes a man who's a man.

627
00:36:51,123 --> 00:36:54,320
She likes you to order for her
in a restaurant. And don't get bossy!

628
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:55,882
Don't ever tell her
to take it easy, Pincus.

629
00:36:55,961 --> 00:36:58,657
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.

630
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,062
I do know how to talk to people.

631
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:05,334
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you? Yeah.

632
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,160
Once you're with her,
you got to show her you care.

633
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,605
You got to be jealous,
got to be suspicious.

634
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:11,699
Why on earth would I do that?

635
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:13,209
'Cause it shows you're interested.

636
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:17,009
This is the worst advice
I've ever had in my life.

637
00:37:17,082 --> 00:37:19,710
But she's jealous, too,
and she's no dummy.

638
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:24,016
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise
one eyebrow and cock her head.

639
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:27,547
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.

640
00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:32,759
- Hi.
- I'm gonna get the next one.

641
00:37:32,831 --> 00:37:35,095
Don't be silly. Get in here.

642
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:36,964
I don't want to... Okay.

643
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:39,296
Pincus.

644
00:37:40,972 --> 00:37:44,965
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.

645
00:37:45,043 --> 00:37:48,035
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?

646
00:37:48,113 --> 00:37:52,482
Don't do this. And get that face off.
You're not... Don't do it!

647
00:37:53,418 --> 00:37:57,081
I've been thinking
about your decaying jawbone.

648
00:37:57,155 --> 00:37:58,349
Pitting is what I'm talking.

649
00:37:58,423 --> 00:37:59,754
Saw it on the slideshow,

650
00:37:59,824 --> 00:38:04,124
which would indicate to me,
a trained dentist, some bone loss,

651
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:07,563
and on the upper left
mandibular gum line.

652
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:08,826
The mummy.

653
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,028
Open invitation to a little vitis
called "Gingi. "

654
00:38:12,103 --> 00:38:13,502
Gingivitis?

655
00:38:14,372 --> 00:38:18,001
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...

656
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,841
Check out the mandibular bone loss,
if I...

657
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:26,077
But wouldn't that just be
ordinary wear and tear?

658
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:30,611
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.

659
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:32,281
I don't think so.

660
00:38:32,357 --> 00:38:35,019
How do the ladies resist
that rap of yours?

661
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,463
All right, all right.
Not a total disaster.

662
00:38:45,537 --> 00:38:47,801
Next time, you just got to listen
to what it is that I'm saying.

663
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:49,669
Excuse me?

664
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:54,337
Do you think maybe you could come by
someday and maybe examine him?

665
00:38:54,412 --> 00:38:56,573
Let's have a look, shall we?

666
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:03,377
- Okay.
- Okay.

667
00:39:03,455 --> 00:39:06,447
No, today's out, tomorrow is out. That.

668
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:10,688
Cannot move that. Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.

669
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:13,959
And that little puppy
is hunkered in good.

670
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:16,023
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.

671
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:22,829
I don't want to move that,
but I can't do that, either.

672
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:24,340
Busy bee.

673
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:27,037
- It's okay.
- It seems to me, I think, commitments

674
00:39:27,112 --> 00:39:28,773
abound.

675
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:35,486
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...

676
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:41,624
- For the love of God!
- 4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...

677
00:39:42,427 --> 00:39:46,454
- Great. Okay.
- Good. See you then.

678
00:40:01,246 --> 00:40:04,409
Way to go, Frank. Oh, God.

679
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,744
Oh, thank God you're back.

680
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:12,051
You left the newspaper
on a cell phone ad, you sadist!

681
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:14,091
- I'm sorry.
- No, forget it.

682
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,286
I'm not in the mood anymore.

683
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:20,160
Where have you been?

684
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:23,758
I sit around here all day long,
and you're out God knows where.

685
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:25,962
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.

686
00:40:26,037 --> 00:40:27,937
Hey, is that a new shirt?

687
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:30,668
Hey, it is a new shirt,
and it's got sleeves.

688
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:34,838
Well, well, well. Pinky's got himself
a brand new shirt for the big...

689
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:05,268
Hi. Hi.

690
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:08,678
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.

691
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:18,548
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?

692
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:22,024
You should have seen the state
he was in when we found him.

693
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:25,893
Blackened skin, multiple fractures
from extensive marauding,

694
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:27,363
fully retreated lips.

695
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:30,799
Five thousand years of acid reflux
will do that to you.

696
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:37,274
Deep down, you know, the preservation
was exquisite New Kingdom work,

697
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:40,038
and it's what's underneath that counts.

698
00:41:40,845 --> 00:41:44,144
First, they suctioned his brain out
through his nose.

699
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:46,649
And then they make a slit
in the side of the abdomen,

700
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:50,415
so that they can remove
the stomach, liver, intestines...

701
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:51,580
Beautiful.

702
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:54,090
...so that they could be separately
preserved in Canopic jars.

703
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,186
But what's really exciting about Pepi is
how they handled his organ.

704
00:41:58,296 --> 00:42:00,389
- His organ?
- Yeah, his dick.

705
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:03,693
I got it right here. You wanna see it?

706
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,598
Please.

707
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:11,439
There's nothing unusual
about the phallus itself.

708
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:13,170
- Sure.
- It's the way it was stored.

709
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:15,804
You know, normally, the penis
and the heart are kept together

710
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,871
and mummified along with the body,

711
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:19,075
but in Pepi's case,

712
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:24,452
they removed it and preserved it
in this separate gold-encrusted jar.

713
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:29,122
God. I can see why he was king.

714
00:42:29,194 --> 00:42:30,286
- You okay?
- Yeah.

715
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:32,955
I've got to get used to looking down
at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.

716
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:36,296
Oh, geez. I see he died happy.

717
00:42:37,936 --> 00:42:39,870
That's it. That's enough.

718
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:41,200
He must have had huge hands.

719
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:43,240
- No, no.
- Yeah.

720
00:42:43,308 --> 00:42:45,572
Is this here the pitting
that you were referring to?

721
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:49,943
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.

722
00:42:50,014 --> 00:42:52,574
We just assumed
that was post-mortal decay.

723
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,675
Don't be naive.

724
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:57,186
That is the work
of an untreated abscess.

725
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:00,656
That was a absolute magic carpet
of bacterial infection.

726
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:01,885
And that could have killed him?

727
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,622
Yeah, if it was severe, that would
have led to something more systemic,

728
00:43:04,696 --> 00:43:06,994
and as soon as the infection
hit the spinal column,

729
00:43:07,065 --> 00:43:10,159
he'd have pennies on his eyes
in no time at all.

730
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:12,760
Well, the mouth. A coin in the mouth.

731
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:14,862
It was a Greek tradition, you know,

732
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:18,102
to pay the boatman to ferry you across
the River Styx, but...

733
00:43:18,176 --> 00:43:20,144
I mean,
this is an amazing breakthrough,

734
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:22,406
and just in time
for our opening next Thursday.

735
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,641
- Hey, will you come?
- What?

736
00:43:24,716 --> 00:43:26,775
- Big opening with loads of people...
- Yeah.

737
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:28,443
- No. That's...
- You don't like crowds?

738
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,923
It's not so much the crowd as the
individuals in the crowd I don't like.

739
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:36,222
Well, if you change your mind,
you let me know.

740
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:41,297
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?

741
00:43:41,366 --> 00:43:44,529
Everybody waits until it's too late.

742
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:46,627
So you're a funny dentist.

743
00:43:48,606 --> 00:43:50,164
You wanna touch him?

744
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:52,539
- This is my lucky day.
- Yeah.

745
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,046
- No, no. Really, really touch him. Yeah.
- More, yeah.

746
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:58,138
- No, like...
- Down there.

747
00:43:58,216 --> 00:44:01,447
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow. Brilliant.

748
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:06,790
Don't you just love that smell?

749
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:10,426
It's not decay.
It's the resin. It's pine.

750
00:44:10,495 --> 00:44:13,430
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.

751
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:18,261
After a couple of hours,
the smell that was initially so sweet,

752
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:20,770
it triggers your vomit impulse.

753
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:22,897
Like visiting your grandmother.

754
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,841
Sugar-free treat?

755
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:34,309
Sure. Okay.

756
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:38,548
It's sweetened with Splenda.

757
00:44:43,962 --> 00:44:45,930
Surprisingly delightful.

758
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:50,761
- Have you lived in the building long?
- Four years and one month.

759
00:44:50,835 --> 00:44:53,827
Originally born and raised in England,
obviously, and then...

760
00:44:53,905 --> 00:44:58,433
- Why'd you move?
- London. Just too much.

761
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:03,037
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.

762
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:05,514
So you picked Manhattan?

763
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:09,747
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.

764
00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:12,815
- What's her name?
- Sarah.

765
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:13,879
- Wife?
- No.

766
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:15,425
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.

767
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:17,017
Still together?

768
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:20,696
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.

769
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:24,023
No, she died, actually. Quite sad.

770
00:45:24,102 --> 00:45:27,902
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?

771
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:29,963
She actually ate herself.

772
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:34,104
I made that up. I was joking.

773
00:45:34,946 --> 00:45:37,847
- But that's not funny.
- Funnier than the truth.

774
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:41,976
- Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
- Very boring and ordinary.

775
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:45,846
How long you been here?

776
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:48,622
Can you just hold on one second?

777
00:45:48,693 --> 00:45:51,787
This is so stupid,
but my keychain broke,

778
00:45:51,863 --> 00:45:54,354
and I can never find my keys.

779
00:45:54,432 --> 00:45:59,369
I moved back to the city about
a year ago, just after my husband died.

780
00:46:00,204 --> 00:46:02,934
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.

781
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,235
Thanks.

782
00:46:06,644 --> 00:46:10,774
I want to ask you something,
and you tell me if it's inappropriate.

783
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:12,542
Okay.

784
00:46:13,985 --> 00:46:15,077
Okay.

785
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:18,545
This tooth.

786
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:22,457
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...

787
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:26,657
- Should I make an appointment?
- No, just warm the drinks up.

788
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:30,064
Let's have a look.
Head back. Open wide.

789
00:46:30,134 --> 00:46:32,125
You want me to say, "Ah"?

790
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:36,468
Hey, Dentist!

791
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:37,838
I need you to clip a guy for me.

792
00:46:37,909 --> 00:46:40,036
- Can you tell what it is?
- It's bad molar contact.

793
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:41,135
You see, Dentist, in life,

794
00:46:41,212 --> 00:46:43,510
I accepted payment for a job
which I wasn't able to complete.

795
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:46,812
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?

796
00:46:46,884 --> 00:46:48,442
- You should come and see me.
- Should I?

797
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:49,543
- You have to finish it for me.
- Yeah.

798
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,487
There's a. 38 snub-nose taped
under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.

799
00:46:52,557 --> 00:46:55,492
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.

800
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,323
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.

801
00:46:58,763 --> 00:47:02,028
- What the...
- Is now a good time?

802
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,199
Is everything okay?

803
00:47:04,268 --> 00:47:06,532
- Yeah, it's just the...
- 'Cause you look a little... Oh, geez.

804
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:08,834
Oh, no, don't... Careful.

805
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:10,339
Look, right in the ear nearly.

806
00:47:10,408 --> 00:47:13,036
It's just... I saw you talking to
Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...

807
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:16,012
Hi, there. Hey!

808
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,571
Good. Another one.

809
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:22,107
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey! I didn't see you.

810
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:23,847
- Hi.
- Oh, alive.

811
00:47:24,388 --> 00:47:27,551
Why did this fellow have his hands
in your mouth?

812
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:31,722
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard,
my fiancé.

813
00:47:32,563 --> 00:47:33,791
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus,

814
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:35,662
that dentist that I told you about
in the building.

815
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:39,066
I think he's got a really terrific idea
about what might have killed Pepi.

816
00:47:39,137 --> 00:47:40,695
Really? That's fantastic.

817
00:47:40,772 --> 00:47:43,172
You know, I've been needing
to find a dentist, myself.

818
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:46,870
Why don't you join us for dinner
tomorrow night, Doctor? At Gwen's.

819
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:48,605
I'm making curry.

820
00:47:49,013 --> 00:47:51,413
- She's really cute.
- Don't...

821
00:47:52,116 --> 00:47:54,084
- Doctor?
- Yes, love to.

822
00:47:54,852 --> 00:47:57,719
- Great.
- I'm in 9F, right below you.

823
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:00,054
Thank you.

824
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:05,653
- I hope it was edible.
- Best curry I've ever tasted.

825
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,528
- Stop complimenting him!
- You're too kind.

826
00:48:10,268 --> 00:48:14,227
- Where did you learn to cook?
- Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.

827
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:18,241
I had a friend
who was generous with her time.

828
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:20,072
Richard's being modest.

829
00:48:20,144 --> 00:48:23,636
He worked for three years
with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.

830
00:48:23,748 --> 00:48:26,342
You still in the sex trade or...

831
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:30,212
That's inappropriate.

832
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:35,387
You know, Doctor,

833
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:39,190
I confess an ulterior motive
in asking you here tonight.

834
00:48:40,298 --> 00:48:41,390
As a dentist,

835
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:43,956
you could do an awful lot of good
in the developing world.

836
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:46,003
They're in desperate need
of modern dental care.

837
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:47,935
"Modern dental care. "
You believe this guy?

838
00:48:48,005 --> 00:48:51,270
Now, the political will is there,
the money's there.

839
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:53,333
What an act. So pompous!

840
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:56,808
- Sorry. What is that?
- My new puppy.

841
00:48:56,881 --> 00:48:58,906
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.

842
00:48:58,983 --> 00:49:01,281
- I need you to punch him.
- But what we really need...

843
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:02,979
- Come on!
... are boots on the ground.

844
00:49:03,054 --> 00:49:04,715
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!

845
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:07,121
How can teeth be self-righteous?

846
00:49:10,561 --> 00:49:16,227
Is a strange thing for a dentist
to burst out with over curry,

847
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,100
but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.

848
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:22,071
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.

849
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,575
What is essentially dentin and enamel

850
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:29,875
outcrops from various mandibles
are inanimate,

851
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:31,505
and therefore, have no moral code.

852
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:35,814
All they can do is chew and grind,
and that's passive.

853
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:39,550
It's mainly
the cheek muscles do that, from...

854
00:49:40,424 --> 00:49:42,051
What were you saying?

855
00:49:42,126 --> 00:49:46,654
I was... I was...
I was saying, we need...

856
00:49:46,731 --> 00:49:50,895
We need people like you
who can bring their expertise to bear

857
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:54,631
in places like Peru,
Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.

858
00:49:54,705 --> 00:50:00,473
Mainly those sort of really hot,
sticky places.

859
00:50:00,544 --> 00:50:03,775
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.

860
00:50:03,848 --> 00:50:08,785
I mean, what is the dental care like in,
say, I don't know, Palm Springs?

861
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:10,115
There's breezes.

862
00:50:10,187 --> 00:50:13,122
You know,
what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?

863
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:16,125
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.

864
00:50:16,193 --> 00:50:18,093
Shrugging and smiling.

865
00:50:21,966 --> 00:50:23,900
He's kidding, sweetie.

866
00:50:35,246 --> 00:50:37,544
I'm sorry, I have to take this.

867
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:41,015
Boy, he'd be handy
on a camping trip, huh?

868
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:42,552
Do you want some more wine?

869
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,214
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.

870
00:50:45,323 --> 00:50:46,415
Okay.

871
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:53,055
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.

872
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:55,361
- Shut...
- What?

873
00:50:55,433 --> 00:50:57,094
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?

874
00:50:57,168 --> 00:51:00,535
If I am, just give me a fake cough
and I'll...

875
00:51:02,173 --> 00:51:04,073
Okay, was that...

876
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:07,235
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay! I'm gone.

877
00:51:11,682 --> 00:51:16,551
Richard's a human rights lawyer, so,
well, he takes his job very seriously.

878
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,349
Oh, well, so you should
with human rights.

879
00:51:18,422 --> 00:51:20,219
I take human rights seriously.

880
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:25,058
You know, everybody's equal,
color, creed or circumstance.

881
00:51:26,163 --> 00:51:28,791
We're all the same on this planet.

882
00:51:30,968 --> 00:51:33,402
- Except the Chinese.
- What?

883
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:36,235
No, they are. They're the odd ones out
if you had to pick one.

884
00:51:36,307 --> 00:51:37,865
No, I'm not having a go.

885
00:51:37,942 --> 00:51:40,103
I'm just saying, you know,
not their faces.

886
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:42,077
I mean... No, no.
But they call each other

887
00:51:42,146 --> 00:51:43,306
- things like Kwok...
- Stop it. You're gonna...

888
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:45,941
...and that's their choice,
and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.

889
00:51:46,017 --> 00:51:48,611
And they... No.
Some people are called Pong...

890
00:51:48,686 --> 00:51:51,120
- Stop, please, stop.
... and there's about a million Wangs.

891
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:52,587
You can have... You have one kid,

892
00:51:52,656 --> 00:51:54,783
you can use all those names
on one little...

893
00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:58,056
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.

894
00:51:58,129 --> 00:52:01,587
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park
have been arrested in Shaolin.

895
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:04,065
I have to get down to the office.

896
00:52:05,436 --> 00:52:07,267
Well, they're being arraigned
in 30 minutes

897
00:52:07,338 --> 00:52:08,635
- and the government will only allow...
- Not again.

898
00:52:08,706 --> 00:52:10,936
...their attorneys to appear
by closed-circuit.

899
00:52:11,008 --> 00:52:12,134
- I'm sorry.
- I'm afraid I have to go.

900
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:13,767
Doctor, it's been a...

901
00:52:13,844 --> 00:52:18,941
Yeah, so you guys stay
and have fun and finish up.

902
00:52:24,088 --> 00:52:26,522
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?

903
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:29,286
- No, not at all.
- Okay, be right back.

904
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:37,363
When did you get your horse?

905
00:52:37,435 --> 00:52:38,868
A couple of months ago.

906
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:40,904
I found him at this shelter
in Long Island.

907
00:52:40,971 --> 00:52:43,269
They were gonna put him down.

908
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,831
Then they lost their nerve, did they?

909
00:52:48,546 --> 00:52:51,037
The smell? Yeah, I know.

910
00:52:51,115 --> 00:52:55,142
His mood levelers give him
this ulcerating skin rash.

911
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:06,329
Are you okay?

912
00:53:07,865 --> 00:53:10,527
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.

913
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:13,536
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.

914
00:53:16,474 --> 00:53:19,671
- Are you all right? Do you want to...
- Sorry.

915
00:53:20,845 --> 00:53:22,574
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.

916
00:53:22,646 --> 00:53:25,945
Do you want to maybe walk him now
or we could finish up and...

917
00:53:26,016 --> 00:53:30,715
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.

918
00:53:49,507 --> 00:53:52,738
Leonard, you good boy!

919
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,869
That is so healthy!

920
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:58,813
Good, good boy! That's a good boy!

921
00:53:58,883 --> 00:54:00,908
That's a good boy!

922
00:54:02,186 --> 00:54:04,416
You wanna finish dinner?

923
00:54:04,488 --> 00:54:07,082
I don't think I'm quite ready for
solid foods just yet.

924
00:54:07,158 --> 00:54:09,649
- I'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.

925
00:54:11,262 --> 00:54:13,594
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.

926
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:16,497
Or, no, have you ever been
to that new...

927
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:25,541
I know, yeah. No, I like Sting

928
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:27,543
because you can hear
he's educated in his lyrics.

929
00:54:27,611 --> 00:54:30,444
- Pimm's Cup for the lady.
- Thank you.

930
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:33,574
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.

931
00:54:33,651 --> 00:54:35,243
Thank you.

932
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:37,116
You know,
that was Frank's favorite drink.

933
00:54:37,188 --> 00:54:39,088
Oh, yeah, I forgot. Sorry.

934
00:54:39,156 --> 00:54:40,487
You forgot?

935
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:42,884
You forgot what?

936
00:54:44,094 --> 00:54:46,494
Forgot? Yeah.

937
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:48,691
You recently lost your husband,

938
00:54:48,766 --> 00:54:50,529
and the polite thing to do
in this situation

939
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:53,069
would have been to check
what the deceased's drink was

940
00:54:53,137 --> 00:54:57,597
as not to evoke any horrible memories.

941
00:54:57,675 --> 00:55:00,508
Why would you assume
that they were horrible?

942
00:55:00,578 --> 00:55:03,274
Painful. Not necessarily horrible.

943
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:07,977
Just all the memories, nonetheless,
of drink-related death memory.

944
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:12,219
I like a Pimm's Cup.

945
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:15,850
This is exactly the kind of girly drink
that Frank would have teased me about.

946
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:20,420
Once when we were in Anguilla,
I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.

947
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:23,364
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter,

948
00:55:23,434 --> 00:55:25,163
and he grabs him
by the lapels and he goes,

949
00:55:25,236 --> 00:55:26,999
"Hey, I'm the only one giving... "

950
00:55:27,071 --> 00:55:28,504
Oh, for God's sake!

951
00:55:28,572 --> 00:55:30,699
Sorry. Just running
on about my dead husband.

952
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:34,005
No, no, no, it wasn't you. No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate. It's...

953
00:55:34,078 --> 00:55:36,273
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.

954
00:55:36,347 --> 00:55:39,043
- Someone I really hate.
- Well, do you wanna leave?

955
00:55:39,116 --> 00:55:41,243
No, no, no. He should leave.

956
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:46,149
Let's do some... You were saying that
Frank had his flaws.

957
00:55:46,223 --> 00:55:48,157
- I was?
- Yeah, and that's really healthy

958
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:50,352
because you should not
romanticize the dead.

959
00:55:50,427 --> 00:55:52,588
You should remember their faults.

960
00:55:52,663 --> 00:55:55,689
Oh, well, I remember them.

961
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:58,326
Oh, good. Well, let's make a list.

962
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,835
What the hell do you think you're doing?

963
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:04,465
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me. I'm a dentist.

964
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:06,372
- Come on, then.
- Okay.

965
00:56:07,077 --> 00:56:09,170
His faults. Number one.

966
00:56:09,246 --> 00:56:12,044
Well, Frank could be
a little controlling.

967
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:13,573
Well, that's what made me successful.

968
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:15,448
But that's probably why
he was so good at his job, so...

969
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:18,420
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.

970
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:21,185
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.

971
00:56:21,258 --> 00:56:22,418
Regularly, I imagine.

972
00:56:22,493 --> 00:56:23,824
- No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious. "

973
00:56:23,894 --> 00:56:25,657
That didn't count, Pincus.

974
00:56:25,729 --> 00:56:28,425
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?

975
00:56:28,499 --> 00:56:32,367
Oh, be quiet! Let them talk.
You could learn something.

976
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,365
He had a shoe fetish.

977
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:38,499
That is so embarrassing,
because it starts on shoes,

978
00:56:38,575 --> 00:56:42,671
and go to gloves
and hats and socks, up the...

979
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:44,509
Right. "Pervert. "

980
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:48,540
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.

981
00:56:48,619 --> 00:56:51,349
- So do I.
- You mind?

982
00:56:51,422 --> 00:56:52,980
Because they're just doing a job,
aren't they?

983
00:56:53,057 --> 00:56:54,354
What a nasty piece of work.

984
00:56:54,425 --> 00:56:56,290
So what about
his physical characteristics?

985
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,328
I'll bet he was really into fitness,

986
00:56:58,395 --> 00:57:00,761
because he was
a scrawny little runt, was he?

987
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:02,822
No, but, you know,
he was actually starting

988
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,130
to get into yoga at the end there.

989
00:57:05,202 --> 00:57:08,831
- I'll bet he was.
- But he spent a lot of time at the gym.

990
00:57:08,906 --> 00:57:10,965
Yeah. Okay, this is shaping up nicely.

991
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:15,171
So now we've got
a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert

992
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:16,712
who's rude to waiters.

993
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,145
It's a good list.

994
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:20,740
I don't have to listen to this shit.

995
00:57:21,452 --> 00:57:22,783
Disloyal.

996
00:57:34,898 --> 00:57:37,264
Yeah, I think that's enough.

997
00:57:43,841 --> 00:57:45,741
I didn't know you knew.

998
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:51,981
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?

999
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:55,978
I didn't get the chance to say,
"Hey, go to hell,"

1000
00:57:56,053 --> 00:57:59,318
you know, "I want a divorce,"
like a normal person.

1001
00:58:06,563 --> 00:58:08,588
Well, I'm sorry. I...

1002
00:58:08,665 --> 00:58:10,997
- That must feel...
- Unfinished.

1003
00:58:26,183 --> 00:58:29,914
She used to travel
a lot for her work, Sarah.

1004
00:58:31,221 --> 00:58:35,157
And the trips got longer and longer.

1005
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:38,752
And then one trip,
she didn't come back at all.

1006
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:42,522
Married a man in Portland.

1007
00:58:45,169 --> 00:58:46,500
Sorry.

1008
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,539
Travel will do that to a relationship.

1009
00:58:56,447 --> 00:58:57,812
Yep.

1010
00:58:57,881 --> 00:59:01,282
I just got this amazing offer
to go map tombs

1011
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:04,514
in the Valley of the
Kings for six months.

1012
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:07,284
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.

1013
00:59:09,426 --> 00:59:11,155
Because of Richard.

1014
00:59:12,329 --> 00:59:13,523
Yeah.

1015
00:59:15,399 --> 00:59:17,424
- Good night.
- Good night.

1016
00:59:21,905 --> 00:59:25,705
Your story, it's not boring
and ordinary, by the way.

1017
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:29,206
I mean, we just get the one life,
you know?

1018
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:33,716
Just one. You can't live someone else's
or think it's more important,

1019
00:59:33,784 --> 00:59:35,809
just because it's more dramatic.

1020
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:37,717
What happens matters.

1021
00:59:38,622 --> 00:59:41,921
Maybe only to us, but it matters.

1022
00:59:43,494 --> 00:59:44,984
Good night.

1023
00:59:46,063 --> 00:59:47,428
Good night.

1024
00:59:58,775 --> 00:59:59,969
What?

1025
01:00:00,811 --> 01:00:02,642
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.

1026
01:00:02,713 --> 01:00:03,941
You're weaseling your way
right in there.

1027
01:00:04,014 --> 01:00:05,413
This is gonna work.

1028
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:09,248
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.

1029
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:12,045
You know he's a human rights lawyer.

1030
01:00:12,122 --> 01:00:13,487
Hey, when the devil shows up,

1031
01:00:13,557 --> 01:00:16,287
you think he's gonna have
little red horns and carry a pitchfork?

1032
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,294
No, he's gonna work for
Amnesty International,

1033
01:00:18,362 --> 01:00:20,330
and he's gonna give
all of his money to the homeless.

1034
01:00:20,397 --> 01:00:24,060
Well, if he did all that,
wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?

1035
01:00:24,134 --> 01:00:25,226
You know what I mean.

1036
01:00:25,302 --> 01:00:26,792
Pincus, I got better things
to do with my time.

1037
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,462
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.

1038
01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:30,769
What, exactly,
is your problem with Richard?

1039
01:00:30,841 --> 01:00:32,172
I told you!

1040
01:00:32,242 --> 01:00:34,301
The guy is setting her up
to rob her blind.

1041
01:00:34,378 --> 01:00:36,005
And what proof have you got? I don't...

1042
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,512
What are you basing this on?

1043
01:00:37,581 --> 01:00:41,142
I saw things with my own two eyes.

1044
01:00:41,218 --> 01:00:43,709
- Saw what?
- Just enough to know.

1045
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,811
Come on. What did he do?

1046
01:00:46,456 --> 01:00:49,550
Well, that's... He's...

1047
01:00:49,626 --> 01:00:52,026
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?

1048
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,426
- Yeah.
- And they're eating.

1049
01:00:53,497 --> 01:00:54,794
- Yeah.
- And the check came,

1050
01:00:54,865 --> 01:00:58,733
and this clown says
that his wallet is in his coat.

1051
01:00:58,802 --> 01:01:00,770
It's over at the coat check.

1052
01:01:00,837 --> 01:01:02,236
- How convenient, right?
- Right.

1053
01:01:02,306 --> 01:01:03,830
So he goes over to go get it,

1054
01:01:03,907 --> 01:01:06,307
makes a big show
about the whole thing, too,

1055
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:10,244
and she says, "No, no, let me get this. "

1056
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,650
- Yeah?
- And he accepted.

1057
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:20,049
There's nothing
wrong with him, is there?

1058
01:01:20,123 --> 01:01:22,614
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.

1059
01:01:22,693 --> 01:01:23,887
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1060
01:01:23,961 --> 01:01:25,895
Listen, he's a perfectly
lovely human being.

1061
01:01:25,963 --> 01:01:27,794
Pincus, there are other things!

1062
01:01:27,864 --> 01:01:30,230
- He took five grand from her.
- He what?

1063
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,325
Yeah. $5,000.

1064
01:01:32,402 --> 01:01:34,199
I saw her write the check
with my own two eyes,

1065
01:01:34,271 --> 01:01:37,468
put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...

1066
01:01:38,308 --> 01:01:40,242
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?

1067
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:41,971
Or shaking the money tree,
see what drops.

1068
01:01:42,045 --> 01:01:43,137
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1069
01:01:43,213 --> 01:01:44,510
- What was it, AIDS?
- No.

1070
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:46,014
Refugees?

1071
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,881
Orphans? Orphans. Good.

1072
01:01:48,952 --> 01:01:50,283
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.

1073
01:01:50,354 --> 01:01:53,619
- You really are. This guy, he's a lawyer.
- Yeah.

1074
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:57,490
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights
of the underprivileged. Come on!

1075
01:01:57,561 --> 01:01:59,495
There must be
something wrong with him.

1076
01:01:59,563 --> 01:02:02,088
There must be some reason
why all this is happening.

1077
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:05,396
Otherwise, what am I doing here?

1078
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:08,760
I'm out.

1079
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:11,706
What? No, no. What do you mean?

1080
01:02:12,876 --> 01:02:15,504
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere
with Gwen's life anymore.

1081
01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:17,069
And I can't lie to her.

1082
01:02:17,147 --> 01:02:18,876
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me,

1083
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:20,439
and I nearly confessed
to everything there and then.

1084
01:02:20,517 --> 01:02:22,542
You can't abandon her to this creep.

1085
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:24,484
- She loves him.
- She doesn't love him!

1086
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:26,749
I haven't seen her laugh
once with this guy!

1087
01:02:26,823 --> 01:02:28,552
He's a good man.

1088
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:32,061
You actually like him,
with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?

1089
01:02:32,129 --> 01:02:33,596
I hate him. Okay?

1090
01:02:33,664 --> 01:02:37,862
I want to run him over
with his own little stupid, electric car.

1091
01:02:37,968 --> 01:02:38,992
But he's what Gwen wants.

1092
01:02:39,069 --> 01:02:41,629
And after what
she's been through with you,

1093
01:02:41,705 --> 01:02:44,333
she deserves a bit of happiness.

1094
01:02:44,408 --> 01:02:46,376
You're in love with her.

1095
01:02:49,212 --> 01:02:51,840
You are. I knew it.

1096
01:02:55,786 --> 01:02:58,016
That little Grinch heart of yours
actually started beating,

1097
01:02:58,088 --> 01:03:01,023
and now you want to take it back
to your cave and crush it with a rock.

1098
01:03:01,091 --> 01:03:03,082
That's what you wanna do.

1099
01:03:03,894 --> 01:03:06,192
- I quit.
- You can't quit.

1100
01:03:06,263 --> 01:03:08,697
I'll make your life a living hell.

1101
01:03:10,901 --> 01:03:12,391
It already is.

1102
01:03:37,194 --> 01:03:41,153
There you go. That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.

1103
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:44,564
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.

1104
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:47,501
Come on. Come on, sweetie. Come on.

1105
01:03:47,571 --> 01:03:50,972
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk. Come on.

1106
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:55,273
God damn it. Come on. Come on.

1107
01:03:55,345 --> 01:03:59,076
You don't wanna wait until
it's too late, do you, sweetie?

1108
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:03,044
Wait.

1109
01:04:04,588 --> 01:04:08,149
Leonard! It is too late.

1110
01:04:14,331 --> 01:04:15,764
Too late.

1111
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:22,731
And so Alex says to me,

1112
01:04:22,806 --> 01:04:26,207
"Mommy, I know that babies come
from inside a lady's tummy,

1113
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:29,973
"but what I really want to know is,
how do they get there?"

1114
01:04:30,714 --> 01:04:32,443
Can you believe? And, of course,

1115
01:04:32,516 --> 01:04:33,778
- I have no clue what to say...
- Head back.

1116
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:35,681
...but I have to come up with something,
because his father...

1117
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:39,711
Oh, no talking,
not when we're popping this in.

1118
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:41,121
- Okay.
- Bite down there.

1119
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:43,659
There you go. Good.

1120
01:04:43,727 --> 01:04:45,627
Just leave that there.

1121
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:49,559
Isn't that good? So much better.

1122
01:04:49,633 --> 01:04:55,367
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting
my ears and we're all winners.

1123
01:04:57,908 --> 01:04:59,705
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.

1124
01:04:59,776 --> 01:05:01,710
Mr. Harriman's bridge
is on the verge of...

1125
01:05:01,778 --> 01:05:04,372
I thought I was through
for the day after this.

1126
01:05:04,447 --> 01:05:07,177
- You are through.
- What about the...

1127
01:05:10,387 --> 01:05:12,014
What about what?

1128
01:05:12,556 --> 01:05:14,251
- Frank.
- Who?

1129
01:05:15,158 --> 01:05:16,887
I don't know who you mean.

1130
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,757
What are you... Who? I've never...

1131
01:05:18,829 --> 01:05:22,060
Okay, my opinion is that
you didn't make sense just now.

1132
01:05:22,132 --> 01:05:23,656
Well, I don't know
who you're talking about.

1133
01:05:23,733 --> 01:05:26,930
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...

1134
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:28,630
- No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!

1135
01:05:28,705 --> 01:05:31,401
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.

1136
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,278
He's not in the office!

1137
01:05:50,694 --> 01:05:52,992
Well, then he must be upstairs.

1138
01:05:58,368 --> 01:06:00,461
Good afternoon, Doctor.

1139
01:06:00,537 --> 01:06:02,869
Good to see you. You look smart.

1140
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,071
Just been to the toilet.

1141
01:06:13,817 --> 01:06:15,910
Different route back, around the...

1142
01:06:15,986 --> 01:06:19,217
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought,
so I just took my time.

1143
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:21,985
I mean, you can take a long time
next time if you...

1144
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:26,360
Good. Okay.

1145
01:06:27,831 --> 01:06:29,196
That's set.

1146
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:32,298
Okay, it has to be...

1147
01:06:33,737 --> 01:06:35,034
Good.

1148
01:06:35,105 --> 01:06:37,801
Can you take a new walk-in
before you leave, Dr. Pincus?

1149
01:06:37,874 --> 01:06:40,308
He seems to be in a lot of pain.

1150
01:06:40,377 --> 01:06:42,242
Life is pain.

1151
01:06:44,014 --> 01:06:46,049
Does that mean yes?

1152
01:06:47,617 --> 01:06:50,814
So we have an emergency
on our hands. I'm Dr. Pincus.

1153
01:06:50,887 --> 01:06:53,321
- Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.

1154
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:56,318
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yep.

1155
01:06:56,393 --> 01:06:57,826
What seems to be the problem?

1156
01:06:57,894 --> 01:07:01,022
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.

1157
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:02,621
That was silly.

1158
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,529
Head back.

1159
01:07:05,602 --> 01:07:08,366
Let's have a look, shall we? Open up.

1160
01:07:09,973 --> 01:07:11,600
Oh, yeah, there it is.

1161
01:07:11,675 --> 01:07:13,666
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.

1162
01:07:13,743 --> 01:07:14,903
Have you been chewing seal hide?

1163
01:07:14,978 --> 01:07:16,843
Yeah, well,
I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard

1164
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:19,313
when I'm stressed and I'm...

1165
01:07:19,382 --> 01:07:21,475
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.

1166
01:07:21,551 --> 01:07:23,985
- I came home and Gwen was...
- What?

1167
01:07:25,155 --> 01:07:27,214
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.

1168
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:29,281
No, you were gonna
say something about...

1169
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:31,327
Well, she was just...

1170
01:07:33,263 --> 01:07:35,595
- No, forget about it.
- No, I can't forget about it.

1171
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:36,927
- Just...
- Well, it's nothing.

1172
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,092
- Can we just get this...
- Well, it is something

1173
01:07:38,168 --> 01:07:40,193
or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...

1174
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:41,703
- It's personal.
- I know that,

1175
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:43,363
but, I mean just to...

1176
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,566
I'd rather not talk about it.

1177
01:07:44,641 --> 01:07:47,132
- Why don't we just...
- "Finish what you started" is my motto.

1178
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:50,373
- I'm a good listener. Please.
- I'd rather not talk about it.

1179
01:07:50,447 --> 01:07:51,914
- Can we just...
- Well, can you wait a minute then?

1180
01:07:51,982 --> 01:07:53,813
- I'm in pain.
- Please.

1181
01:07:58,188 --> 01:07:59,780
Dr. Prashar?

1182
01:08:04,594 --> 01:08:07,563
Jahangir? That's his first name.

1183
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:13,465
You're from a scary country, aren't you?

1184
01:08:14,637 --> 01:08:16,036
Excuse me.

1185
01:08:16,673 --> 01:08:18,538
- I'm from India.
- Yeah.

1186
01:08:18,608 --> 01:08:21,099
So you're not a Christian, like us.

1187
01:08:22,846 --> 01:08:24,541
No, I'm a Hindu.

1188
01:08:27,884 --> 01:08:31,047
How would you extract information
from a hostile?

1189
01:08:34,524 --> 01:08:37,721
Well, as a Hindu person,

1190
01:08:37,794 --> 01:08:41,594
I would ask them politely.

1191
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,666
Yeah, I just need a technique.

1192
01:08:47,737 --> 01:08:51,229
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah. Okay.

1193
01:08:55,912 --> 01:08:57,072
So where were we?

1194
01:08:57,147 --> 01:08:58,842
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...

1195
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:02,009
- No, I wasn't. I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.

1196
01:09:02,118 --> 01:09:05,383
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.

1197
01:09:05,455 --> 01:09:11,155
All work and no play makes Jack
a valuable member of society.

1198
01:09:12,395 --> 01:09:13,760
Open up.

1199
01:09:16,066 --> 01:09:19,502
- That hurts.
- Did it? Well, take your word for that.

1200
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:22,663
But it almost certainly would
in this situation.

1201
01:09:23,673 --> 01:09:27,404
Do you know the worst thing
in the world for teeth?

1202
01:09:28,111 --> 01:09:29,874
- Sugar?
- Secrets.

1203
01:09:30,947 --> 01:09:32,778
If you tell me what's on your mind,
you will feel better.

1204
01:09:32,849 --> 01:09:35,750
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.

1205
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:38,754
I really would like to keep this
on a professional footing.

1206
01:09:38,822 --> 01:09:40,255
Yes, please.

1207
01:09:41,658 --> 01:09:44,650
We can play it any way you want to.

1208
01:09:48,465 --> 01:09:50,092
Actually.

1209
01:09:57,607 --> 01:09:59,575
That's not Novocain.

1210
01:09:59,642 --> 01:10:03,578
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.

1211
01:10:03,646 --> 01:10:07,241
Nitrous? I didn't know you guys
still used nitrous.

1212
01:10:07,317 --> 01:10:09,444
- Are there any side effects?
- A few.

1213
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:12,352
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.

1214
01:10:13,256 --> 01:10:14,883
But they all talk.

1215
01:10:22,065 --> 01:10:25,432
Hey, Frankie! Fancy seeing you here.

1216
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:29,199
You back on the job yet
or you need me to send more?

1217
01:10:29,272 --> 01:10:31,866
I got a couple Civil War
re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.

1218
01:10:31,941 --> 01:10:34,102
- They used live ammo.
- Didn't get the news.

1219
01:10:34,177 --> 01:10:36,441
Job's done. Richard's history.

1220
01:10:36,513 --> 01:10:39,141
- What?
- She dumped him last night.

1221
01:10:39,215 --> 01:10:42,275
- How do you know?
- He told me. The marriage is off.

1222
01:10:42,352 --> 01:10:43,876
So he's out completely?

1223
01:10:43,953 --> 01:10:46,547
Well, he wants to stay friends,
but she's done with him.

1224
01:10:46,623 --> 01:10:48,147
She said she was confused
about her feelings

1225
01:10:48,224 --> 01:10:51,125
and it wasn't right
to string him along, so...

1226
01:10:51,961 --> 01:10:53,428
Why would Richard tell you all this?

1227
01:10:53,496 --> 01:10:56,397
Because I gave him
700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.

1228
01:10:56,466 --> 01:10:59,731
- Is that a lot?
- No. It's not fatal till 750.

1229
01:10:59,802 --> 01:11:02,293
You know, I think this sounds
a lot like a premarital spat.

1230
01:11:02,372 --> 01:11:04,363
- I mean, young couples at this stage...
- No. Definitely not.

1231
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,668
- Very normal for them to start...
- No, no, no.

1232
01:11:05,742 --> 01:11:08,438
...to get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.

1233
01:11:08,511 --> 01:11:10,342
She's going there for six months.

1234
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:14,975
It's the real thing. She leaves Thursday,
right after the exhibition opens.

1235
01:11:16,486 --> 01:11:18,750
- Well, this is great news.
- Yeah.

1236
01:11:18,821 --> 01:11:22,518
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate,
I guess.

1237
01:11:22,592 --> 01:11:25,117
- I can't.
- Me, neither.

1238
01:11:25,195 --> 01:11:27,322
- Well, wait! What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

1239
01:11:27,397 --> 01:11:28,591
Is that from a jewelry store?

1240
01:11:28,665 --> 01:11:31,225
- Oh, my gosh. Is that for Gwen?
- It doesn't matter.

1241
01:11:31,301 --> 01:11:33,861
Well, whatever happened
to the "I will not interfere" thing?

1242
01:11:33,937 --> 01:11:35,837
There's nothing to interfere with now,
is there?

1243
01:11:35,905 --> 01:11:38,430
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.

1244
01:11:38,508 --> 01:11:39,702
And you think she's gonna love you?

1245
01:11:39,776 --> 01:11:42,506
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.

1246
01:11:42,579 --> 01:11:45,241
You said that if I broke up the marriage,
you'd leave me alone!

1247
01:11:45,315 --> 01:11:46,714
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!

1248
01:11:46,783 --> 01:11:48,683
Well, you should at least let me
help you pick out something!

1249
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:51,083
Do you have any idea how much
"Please forgive me" jewelry

1250
01:11:51,154 --> 01:11:52,621
- I bought her over the years?
- I can take it from here!

1251
01:11:52,689 --> 01:11:54,020
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,

1252
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:56,183
- you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank! Listen!

1253
01:11:56,259 --> 01:11:59,228
Our time together, as we both know,
has been rather unpleasant.

1254
01:11:59,295 --> 01:12:01,957
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man,

1255
01:12:02,031 --> 01:12:06,400
boorish, distasteful, uncouth,
uneducated, stupid, at least...

1256
01:12:10,807 --> 01:12:13,037
- You gonna finish?
- Done.

1257
01:12:14,377 --> 01:12:16,937
- Okay.
- The point is this,

1258
01:12:17,013 --> 01:12:19,743
we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?

1259
01:12:19,816 --> 01:12:22,546
One day, not too soon I hope,
we meet up again.

1260
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:26,111
- Until then, this is our fond farewell.
- Yeah, but...

1261
01:12:29,425 --> 01:12:31,393
But why am I still here?

1262
01:12:36,733 --> 01:12:39,031
Construction crane dropped
two tons of steel on us.

1263
01:12:39,102 --> 01:12:40,228
That must have hurt.

1264
01:12:40,303 --> 01:12:42,635
It was a hydraulic leak. An act of God!

1265
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:44,468
Why does he do those things?

1266
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,735
But the crane operator,
he thinks it's all his fault.

1267
01:12:46,809 --> 01:12:48,436
Oh, therapy time!

1268
01:12:58,054 --> 01:13:00,079
Don't panic. It's nothing.

1269
01:13:04,761 --> 01:13:06,160
A key chain.

1270
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,861
I needed a key chain!

1271
01:13:09,465 --> 01:13:11,490
- I love it!
- Oh, good.

1272
01:13:12,769 --> 01:13:16,261
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...

1273
01:13:16,339 --> 01:13:19,331
What a strange
and practical man you are.

1274
01:13:19,409 --> 01:13:22,606
It was down to that
or a set of socket wrenches.

1275
01:13:23,413 --> 01:13:25,040
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.

1276
01:13:25,114 --> 01:13:27,207
$140. The receipt's in the box.

1277
01:13:27,283 --> 01:13:30,252
No, well, you don't actually
have to tell people in that situation.

1278
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,811
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.

1279
01:13:32,889 --> 01:13:35,119
It's not like
it's Peruvian gold or anything.

1280
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:38,752
And the reason I say that
is because there was a set of earrings

1281
01:13:38,828 --> 01:13:40,887
made from Peruvian gold in the shop,

1282
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:42,430
and I thought, "Gwen would like those,

1283
01:13:42,498 --> 01:13:44,329
"but sorry,
a little bit out of my price range. "

1284
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,526
So...

1285
01:13:46,636 --> 01:13:49,104
What? Stop giving me the pirate look.

1286
01:13:49,172 --> 01:13:54,508
I just got you a gift and, you know,
nothing ostentatious or pushy.

1287
01:13:54,577 --> 01:13:56,977
Just a little gesture to let you know
I've been thinking about you,

1288
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:58,843
and I think you should accept it

1289
01:13:58,915 --> 01:14:02,874
in the spirit of friendship
with which it was given.

1290
01:14:02,952 --> 01:14:06,285
"Pirate look"? How could you
possibly know about that?

1291
01:14:06,356 --> 01:14:08,187
- I don't.
- You do.

1292
01:14:08,925 --> 01:14:11,291
- Common expression?
- No.

1293
01:14:11,361 --> 01:14:13,124
How do you know
about any of this stuff?

1294
01:14:13,196 --> 01:14:16,188
- Pirate look? Peruvian gold?
- Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.

1295
01:14:16,265 --> 01:14:18,529
And then the other night,
Frank's favorite drink?

1296
01:14:19,068 --> 01:14:21,127
Come on, take it easy.

1297
01:14:21,504 --> 01:14:23,699
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
- You hate that.

1298
01:14:23,773 --> 01:14:25,536
How do you know what I hate?

1299
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:27,633
Lucky guess. Can we start again?

1300
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:30,770
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.

1301
01:14:31,247 --> 01:14:32,976
She's leaving anyway in a few days.

1302
01:14:33,049 --> 01:14:35,176
Gonna have to go with the truth,
Dentist, no choice.

1303
01:14:35,251 --> 01:14:37,583
You've got about 10 seconds
to start talking, buddy,

1304
01:14:37,653 --> 01:14:39,018
and then I'm out of here.

1305
01:14:39,088 --> 01:14:41,852
How do you know
this stuff from my life with Frank?

1306
01:14:41,924 --> 01:14:43,482
- It'll sound crazy.
- Try her.

1307
01:14:43,559 --> 01:14:44,753
Try me.

1308
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:48,925
A couple of weeks ago, I went into
hospital for a routine operation,

1309
01:14:48,998 --> 01:14:53,458
but there was complications.
And I died. Just for a few minutes...

1310
01:14:56,139 --> 01:14:58,699
It's true! I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.

1311
01:14:58,775 --> 01:15:01,744
You know what? Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.

1312
01:15:01,811 --> 01:15:03,142
How else would I know
all the things I know?

1313
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:05,373
Well, you must have known Frank.

1314
01:15:05,448 --> 01:15:07,348
I don't know,
maybe you were his dentist.

1315
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:10,113
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.

1316
01:15:10,186 --> 01:15:12,450
- How do you get like you?
- Please.

1317
01:15:12,522 --> 01:15:16,424
One question, and if I get it wrong,
you'll never see me again.

1318
01:15:18,494 --> 01:15:21,986
Frank used to have this nightmare
over and over.

1319
01:15:22,064 --> 01:15:25,522
He'd wake up in tears and he never told
anybody else about it, but me.

1320
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:27,000
What was it?

1321
01:15:27,804 --> 01:15:29,101
Drowning.

1322
01:15:29,972 --> 01:15:33,339
I'd dream that I dove into the water,
and I went down deep,

1323
01:15:33,409 --> 01:15:36,003
but when I turned around
to make it back to the top,

1324
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:37,636
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.

1325
01:15:37,713 --> 01:15:39,305
Drowning. He dived into the water,

1326
01:15:39,382 --> 01:15:44,115
and it didn't matter how hard he tried
to get back to the surface, he couldn't.

1327
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,254
That's right, isn't it?

1328
01:15:47,757 --> 01:15:49,349
Not even close.

1329
01:15:52,028 --> 01:15:53,052
No!

1330
01:15:54,096 --> 01:15:56,462
You know the first time I met you?

1331
01:15:56,532 --> 01:16:01,868
And then the next 10 or 12 times
after that, I thought, "What a jerk. "

1332
01:16:02,405 --> 01:16:04,635
But then I got to know you
a little bit, right?

1333
01:16:04,707 --> 01:16:07,608
And I convinced myself
that I saw something human in you.

1334
01:16:07,677 --> 01:16:09,645
You know,
"Maybe he's just a little eccentric,

1335
01:16:09,712 --> 01:16:11,976
"needs a little work. "

1336
01:16:12,048 --> 01:16:15,381
But to use intimate details
about my dead husband

1337
01:16:15,451 --> 01:16:19,080
in order to get close to me,
or for God knows what other reason,

1338
01:16:19,155 --> 01:16:21,123
that's unforgivable.

1339
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:23,524
You're sick.

1340
01:16:26,295 --> 01:16:28,763
- I love you.
- Don't call me!

1341
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:37,636
You lied. Why would you do that?

1342
01:16:42,078 --> 01:16:44,478
Because you're
a heartless son of a bitch

1343
01:16:44,547 --> 01:16:47,983
who doesn't give a rat's ass
about anyone but himself.

1344
01:16:51,354 --> 01:16:53,652
She's already had one of those.

1345
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:57,192
See you around, Dentist.

1346
01:17:38,834 --> 01:17:40,802
- What?
- It's my daughter.

1347
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:42,428
Yeah, you mentioned
something about that.

1348
01:17:42,505 --> 01:17:45,065
She won't speak to her sister,
her only sister.

1349
01:17:45,141 --> 01:17:47,871
She's so angry about the necklace I left,

1350
01:17:47,944 --> 01:17:51,141
but I slipped a letter under her door
the day before I died.

1351
01:17:51,213 --> 01:17:53,477
It explained everything.

1352
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:56,313
But there was carpeting in the entryway.

1353
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:59,877
I didn't know
the letter went under the carpet.

1354
01:17:59,956 --> 01:18:01,184
She never got it.

1355
01:18:01,257 --> 01:18:03,691
My God, you're boring, aren't you?

1356
01:18:06,362 --> 01:18:09,331
My little boy has a stuffed animal,
a squirrel.

1357
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:11,161
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.

1358
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:15,135
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.

1359
01:18:15,204 --> 01:18:16,967
They don't know it's just
under the front seat of the car.

1360
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:18,904
It's right there, they just can't see it.

1361
01:18:18,975 --> 01:18:21,842
So now, he cries himself to sleep
without it every night,

1362
01:18:21,911 --> 01:18:24,379
because to him that toy is me.

1363
01:18:25,047 --> 01:18:26,742
I can't help you.

1364
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,982
You mean you won't help us.

1365
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:31,849
Isn't that the truth?

1366
01:18:31,921 --> 01:18:35,049
Yeah, I'll tell you
what else is true, shall I?

1367
01:18:36,292 --> 01:18:39,193
We live alone and then we die alone.

1368
01:18:39,762 --> 01:18:42,697
And, apparently, we stay alone.

1369
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,534
That's the truth, too, isn't it?

1370
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:50,658
- You idiot!
- I'm sorry!

1371
01:20:02,244 --> 01:20:04,303
Unbelievable! Come on.

1372
01:21:04,607 --> 01:21:06,598
- Hello.
- What a day.

1373
01:21:07,743 --> 01:21:11,076
Yeah, well, it appears that
winter is upon us.

1374
01:21:11,147 --> 01:21:12,978
- Hail.
- What?

1375
01:21:13,048 --> 01:21:15,846
It doesn't even have
the decency to snow.

1376
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:20,480
Is there any more stupid form
of precipitation than hail?

1377
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:26,492
- No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
- Jahangir?

1378
01:21:26,562 --> 01:21:28,462
- Yeah.
- We're friends.

1379
01:21:28,531 --> 01:21:29,623
- Well...
- Associates.

1380
01:21:29,698 --> 01:21:32,132
- Yeah.
- We have things in common.

1381
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:34,294
- Yeah.
- We share stuff and...

1382
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:36,600
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.

1383
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:37,696
- Yeah.
- We're close.

1384
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:40,606
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not close, but... What the...

1385
01:21:40,676 --> 01:21:43,236
Well, that's not the point, is it?

1386
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,811
Listen.

1387
01:21:46,882 --> 01:21:48,440
I met a woman.

1388
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:51,943
The kind of a woman that

1389
01:21:52,021 --> 01:21:55,115
makes you want to go back in time
to before you met her.

1390
01:21:55,191 --> 01:22:00,026
Whatever the hell life was like then,
it's not as bad as the hell now.

1391
01:22:01,831 --> 01:22:04,891
Knowing she's out there
and you can't have her.

1392
01:22:06,101 --> 01:22:08,569
What I'm trying to say is

1393
01:22:09,939 --> 01:22:12,999
could you write me
a prescription for Percocet?

1394
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,700
What?

1395
01:22:15,778 --> 01:22:17,268
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?

1396
01:22:17,346 --> 01:22:21,806
Legally. It's for my sleep
and to pretend she never happened.

1397
01:22:22,585 --> 01:22:24,052
Or Darvon.

1398
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:25,552
Or Vicodin.

1399
01:22:25,621 --> 01:22:28,749
Just like a 30 count, or 60,
if you don't want

1400
01:22:29,792 --> 01:22:32,920
me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.

1401
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:35,725
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.

1402
01:22:39,535 --> 01:22:41,002
Come with me.

1403
01:22:46,008 --> 01:22:47,100
- What are we doing?
- Just sit down.

1404
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:48,404
- No.
- Sit down.

1405
01:22:48,477 --> 01:22:50,274
- Why?
- Just sit down.

1406
01:22:57,019 --> 01:23:00,352
- Oh, look, never mind.
- This is important. Look.

1407
01:23:05,327 --> 01:23:07,454
- Brilliant.
- The other one.

1408
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:15,002
Yep. As mass-produced poster
slogans go, that's good.

1409
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:18,233
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life,
you're gonna have to stop,

1410
01:23:18,307 --> 01:23:21,003
and ask yourself the ultimate question.

1411
01:23:22,111 --> 01:23:23,703
"This business of

1412
01:23:24,847 --> 01:23:28,078
"being such a fucking prick,

1413
01:23:29,485 --> 01:23:31,680
"what is it really getting me?"

1414
01:24:05,454 --> 01:24:07,888
You said something about a letter.

1415
01:25:21,563 --> 01:25:23,360
You should try it on.

1416
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:43,209
Mom! Look what I found!

1417
01:25:43,285 --> 01:25:46,516
What? Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?

1418
01:25:46,588 --> 01:25:48,715
It fell out of his backpack.

1419
01:25:49,558 --> 01:25:50,957
Thank you.

1420
01:25:53,729 --> 01:25:55,094
Dr. Pincus?

1421
01:26:00,035 --> 01:26:02,333
Hi. Sorry, I didn't...

1422
01:26:06,141 --> 01:26:08,336
Thank you. Thank you so much!

1423
01:26:09,011 --> 01:26:10,706
I never realized.

1424
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:39,160
Thanks.

1425
01:27:42,037 --> 01:27:45,006
...many insights into the life
and death of King Pepi.

1426
01:27:45,073 --> 01:27:47,337
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1427
01:27:51,914 --> 01:27:54,474
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1428
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:55,642
Gwen!

1429
01:27:58,487 --> 01:28:00,079
What are you doing here?

1430
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:02,089
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.

1431
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:03,715
Please leave me alone.

1432
01:28:03,792 --> 01:28:05,692
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,

1433
01:28:05,761 --> 01:28:07,388
I think they've got it completely wrong.

1434
01:28:07,462 --> 01:28:11,228
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?

1435
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:15,134
Look at Pepi. Okay, they buried him with
everything a dead guy doesn't need.

1436
01:28:15,204 --> 01:28:17,502
Household pets, money.

1437
01:28:17,573 --> 01:28:21,202
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?

1438
01:28:21,276 --> 01:28:25,076
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.

1439
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:28,574
No, not why did they put it in a big...

1440
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:30,948
Why'd they put it in a jar at all? Why?

1441
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:32,077
What?

1442
01:28:32,154 --> 01:28:36,591
Why would they go to all that trouble for
someone they'll never see again?

1443
01:28:36,658 --> 01:28:38,057
Because they love him

1444
01:28:38,126 --> 01:28:40,492
and they want to make sure
he'll be okay.

1445
01:28:40,562 --> 01:28:42,086
Because if they know he's okay...

1446
01:28:42,164 --> 01:28:43,563
- Yes, they can let him go.
- You were fabulous.

1447
01:28:43,632 --> 01:28:46,362
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.

1448
01:28:46,435 --> 01:28:48,835
Exactly. They can let him go.

1449
01:28:49,738 --> 01:28:52,263
Frank's haunting you, Gwen. Let him go.

1450
01:28:52,341 --> 01:28:54,741
If he's haunting me,
then shouldn't he let me go?

1451
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:57,244
No. He can't. It's not him. It's you.

1452
01:28:57,312 --> 01:29:01,373
All this stuff about ghosts
having unfinished business,

1453
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:04,044
it's us that are unfinished.

1454
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:05,586
Let Frank go.

1455
01:29:06,255 --> 01:29:08,849
Let the pervert decay in peace.

1456
01:29:10,359 --> 01:29:12,623
Please, stop following me.

1457
01:29:17,599 --> 01:29:20,625
- It was wonderful! Thank you so much.
- Yes, it's nice to see you both.

1458
01:29:20,702 --> 01:29:21,794
That came out all wrong.

1459
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:24,236
I don't care how you knew
all that stuff about Frank, okay?

1460
01:29:24,306 --> 01:29:25,500
- I don't care.
- I told you, I'm trying to...

1461
01:29:25,574 --> 01:29:26,836
Maybe you guys were
a couple of buddies.

1462
01:29:26,908 --> 01:29:28,000
- How about that?
- No, no, no, no, no...

1463
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:29,304
Two regular guys while he was alive,

1464
01:29:29,378 --> 01:29:32,074
and you went out drinking
and went to strip clubs

1465
01:29:32,147 --> 01:29:33,444
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.

1466
01:29:33,515 --> 01:29:34,607
...and laughed at your wives...

1467
01:29:34,683 --> 01:29:37,777
- I swear.
- What was the matter with me?

1468
01:29:37,853 --> 01:29:39,514
Why didn't he love me?

1469
01:29:39,588 --> 01:29:41,556
I did love you. I still do.

1470
01:29:41,623 --> 01:29:43,215
He did love you.

1471
01:29:45,394 --> 01:29:47,453
Then why wasn't I enough?

1472
01:29:53,735 --> 01:29:55,259
You've got nothing to say to that,
have you?

1473
01:29:55,337 --> 01:29:56,895
- What?
- Useless.

1474
01:29:56,972 --> 01:29:59,133
Please. What do you think
I'm gonna do, change?

1475
01:29:59,207 --> 01:30:00,367
- Well...
- In all your life,

1476
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:03,036
have you ever actually known anybody
who's changed at all, ever?

1477
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:05,204
Why can't you make an effort,
just for a few seconds?

1478
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,304
I am who I am.

1479
01:30:06,381 --> 01:30:07,712
I suppose you're talking
to him right now?

1480
01:30:07,783 --> 01:30:09,944
- Is that what you want me to believe?
- What do you want to tell him?

1481
01:30:10,018 --> 01:30:12,919
- What do you want to say?
- I want an answer!

1482
01:30:13,588 --> 01:30:15,317
I want to know
why I wasn't enough for him.

1483
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:20,058
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.

1484
01:30:20,128 --> 01:30:22,528
I don't know why I did
the shit that I did.

1485
01:30:22,597 --> 01:30:25,122
And he doesn't know
why he did the things he did.

1486
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,634
And you don't get any smarter
just because you're dead.

1487
01:30:27,703 --> 01:30:30,228
You don't get smarter after you die.

1488
01:30:30,305 --> 01:30:33,832
But I did see one thing,
how much I hurt you.

1489
01:30:33,909 --> 01:30:37,470
But he's seen
how much he hurt you. And...

1490
01:30:42,551 --> 01:30:44,314
I'm so sorry, honey.

1491
01:30:46,788 --> 01:30:49,814
- What? What'd he say?
- He said he's sorry.

1492
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,325
That's it?

1493
01:30:54,396 --> 01:30:55,761
He's sorry?

1494
01:30:55,831 --> 01:30:58,129
Well, it was the way
he said it, it was...

1495
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,498
He's sorry. He's sorry.

1496
01:31:01,269 --> 01:31:04,670
- Heartfelt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Heartfelt.

1497
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:07,538
Good guess. I got to go pack.

1498
01:31:07,609 --> 01:31:10,100
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!

1499
01:31:11,179 --> 01:31:12,646
Gwen! Wait!

1500
01:31:13,382 --> 01:31:14,679
Why should I talk to you?

1501
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:16,980
You couldn't even get his dream right!

1502
01:31:17,052 --> 01:31:19,145
No, because he told me the wrong
dream to try to make me look bad.

1503
01:31:19,221 --> 01:31:20,620
He stitched me up.

1504
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:22,782
Then what's the right one?

1505
01:31:22,858 --> 01:31:23,847
Well, he's not here right now, is he?

1506
01:31:23,925 --> 01:31:25,324
- I can't check with him.
- Oh, that's convenient.

1507
01:31:25,394 --> 01:31:27,225
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.

1508
01:31:27,295 --> 01:31:29,286
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?

1509
01:31:29,364 --> 01:31:32,731
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.

1510
01:31:32,801 --> 01:31:34,166
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.

1511
01:31:34,236 --> 01:31:36,670
Gwen, I've lived more
in the last few days

1512
01:31:36,738 --> 01:31:42,074
that I've spent with you, since I died,
than I ever lived before I died,

1513
01:31:42,144 --> 01:31:45,910
back when I was living, the first time.
Right? Do you know what I mean?

1514
01:31:45,981 --> 01:31:47,073
Nope.

1515
01:31:47,149 --> 01:31:49,447
Right. I'm born and then...

1516
01:31:57,526 --> 01:31:59,585
Someone call an ambulance!

1517
01:32:00,562 --> 01:32:02,257
Try to get help!

1518
01:32:04,299 --> 01:32:06,290
Somebody do something!

1519
01:32:06,368 --> 01:32:07,801
Oh, my God.

1520
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:11,405
Now that is a real shame.

1521
01:32:11,473 --> 01:32:13,338
You were really getting
somewhere with her, too.

1522
01:32:13,408 --> 01:32:15,672
- What's happening?
- You ate it, pal.

1523
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,268
Goddamned MTA strikes again.

1524
01:32:17,345 --> 01:32:19,370
These drivers, I mean,
it's a menace, right?

1525
01:32:19,448 --> 01:32:21,143
No! No, I'm not dead!

1526
01:32:21,216 --> 01:32:23,047
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1527
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,551
I'm sorry, kiddo.

1528
01:32:29,257 --> 01:32:31,350
Come here, you. Kind of nice.

1529
01:32:31,426 --> 01:32:33,587
- Feels good.
- I was just getting started!

1530
01:32:33,662 --> 01:32:36,654
Everything else, every minute up till now
has just been a waste of time!

1531
01:32:36,731 --> 01:32:38,062
Just a warm-up!

1532
01:32:38,133 --> 01:32:39,327
Yeah.

1533
01:32:41,269 --> 01:32:44,102
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...

1534
01:32:44,172 --> 01:32:46,140
- Watching her cry.
- Do something!

1535
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:50,770
Knowing she needs somebody to
comfort her and knowing it can't be you.

1536
01:32:50,846 --> 01:32:52,746
Has anyone called 911?

1537
01:32:52,814 --> 01:32:55,214
- Wait a minute.
- You got to be kidding me.

1538
01:32:55,283 --> 01:32:56,375
Well, call them!

1539
01:32:56,451 --> 01:32:59,887
- Wait a minute.
- Space! Give me space!

1540
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:05,282
He's doing CPR. He knows CPR.
Of course! He knows CPR.

1541
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,794
Give him space, he needs space.

1542
01:33:07,863 --> 01:33:09,194
He's probably gonna
cut open your chest

1543
01:33:09,264 --> 01:33:10,959
and massage your heart back
to life with his bare hands.

1544
01:33:11,032 --> 01:33:14,160
Oh, Lord! Spare this man!

1545
01:33:14,236 --> 01:33:15,635
Okay, I really can't take
this guy anymore.

1546
01:33:15,704 --> 01:33:18,332
Honestly, really, I can't.

1547
01:33:18,406 --> 01:33:19,634
Come on!

1548
01:33:39,327 --> 01:33:42,524
Hey, Pincus, there's something
I should tell you.

1549
01:33:42,597 --> 01:33:45,122
It might come in handy
if you make it back.

1550
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,930
You're gonna help me? Why?

1551
01:33:48,737 --> 01:33:50,728
Those tears she's crying,

1552
01:33:54,442 --> 01:33:56,342
those are for you, now.

1553
01:34:01,583 --> 01:34:02,948
Listen up.

1554
01:34:06,288 --> 01:34:08,188
I think my ride's here.

1555
01:34:33,481 --> 01:34:35,972
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.

1556
01:34:36,618 --> 01:34:38,347
What happened?

1557
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,445
You crossed the street when it said,
"Don't walk. "

1558
01:34:40,522 --> 01:34:42,956
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.

1559
01:34:44,192 --> 01:34:45,284
Gwen.

1560
01:34:46,127 --> 01:34:47,424
Was there a woman here?

1561
01:34:47,495 --> 01:34:50,487
It's possible, but if she was unable
to provide proof of kinship,

1562
01:34:50,565 --> 01:34:53,830
security would have escorted her
off the premises.

1563
01:34:53,902 --> 01:34:55,494
Nice work, guys.

1564
01:35:00,075 --> 01:35:02,771
- You went darker.
- I went darker, yes.

1565
01:35:04,245 --> 01:35:06,736
Looks good. Makes your eyes pop.

1566
01:35:14,322 --> 01:35:15,880
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.

1567
01:35:15,957 --> 01:35:18,892
Remember, only floss
the ones you wanna keep.

1568
01:35:20,528 --> 01:35:21,790
Hi.

1569
01:35:32,807 --> 01:35:35,071
I didn't know you were back.

1570
01:35:35,143 --> 01:35:37,168
- Hi.
- Hi.

1571
01:35:37,245 --> 01:35:39,406
I thought you were in Egypt.

1572
01:35:39,814 --> 01:35:43,045
I felt like sticking around. You're okay?

1573
01:35:43,685 --> 01:35:45,983
Yeah. Under the circumstances.

1574
01:35:46,888 --> 01:35:49,686
You know, I tried visiting you
at the hospital, but they wouldn't...

1575
01:35:49,758 --> 01:35:51,658
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there

1576
01:35:51,726 --> 01:35:54,661
at Cooperative Institutional
Health Bastards.

1577
01:35:56,164 --> 01:35:57,756
You okay?

1578
01:35:57,832 --> 01:35:59,857
I have bad molar contact.

1579
01:36:01,202 --> 01:36:03,397
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.

1580
01:36:03,471 --> 01:36:06,031
I'm not. I actually made
the appointment with Dr. Prashar.

1581
01:36:06,107 --> 01:36:09,270
- Oh, no, of course. No... He's...
- Well, I didn't know...

1582
01:36:10,945 --> 01:36:12,708
He's a lovely man.

1583
01:36:12,781 --> 01:36:16,740
And he's a better dentist than me,
but don't tell him I said so.

1584
01:36:18,887 --> 01:36:22,152
Anyway, I'm glad to see
you're looking well.

1585
01:36:23,625 --> 01:36:25,058
And you.

1586
01:36:28,063 --> 01:36:30,429
He's eight years old.

1587
01:36:30,498 --> 01:36:32,864
- Sorry? What?
- Frank.

1588
01:36:32,934 --> 01:36:35,164
In his dream. The real one.

1589
01:36:35,236 --> 01:36:37,898
And he's walking in the woods
with his dad.

1590
01:36:37,972 --> 01:36:40,668
He's holding hands,
but then suddenly, his dad's not there.

1591
01:36:40,742 --> 01:36:44,337
He tries to find his way back
the way he came,

1592
01:36:44,412 --> 01:36:47,643
but he keeps ending up
back where he started,

1593
01:36:47,716 --> 01:36:49,616
and that's his nightmare.

1594
01:36:50,018 --> 01:36:53,385
That he's lost
and he can't find his way home.

1595
01:36:53,455 --> 01:36:54,888
That's it.

1596
01:36:56,391 --> 01:36:58,188
Do you still see him?

1597
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:00,925
He found his way home.

1598
01:37:01,796 --> 01:37:03,195
That's good.

1599
01:37:36,131 --> 01:37:37,996
It hurts when I smile.

1600
01:37:41,836 --> 01:37:43,235
I can fix that for you.
