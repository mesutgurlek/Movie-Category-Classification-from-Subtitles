1
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,080
Hi. Welcome to the future.

2
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,586
San Dimas, California, 2688.

3
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,418
And I'm telling you, it's great here.

4
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,191
The air is clean. The water's clean.

5
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,558
Even the dirt is clean.

6
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:52,161
Bowling averages are way up.
Mini-golf scores are way down.

7
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,570
And we have more excellent waterslides...

8
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,132
...than any other planet
we communicate with.

9
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,968
I'm telling you, this place is great...

10
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,109
...but it almost wasn't.

11
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,842
You see, 700 years ago,
the two great ones...

12
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,081
...ran into a few problems.

13
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,816
So now I have to travel back in time
to help them out.

14
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,752
<i>If I fail to keep these two</i>
<i>on the correct path... </i>

15
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,087
<i>... the basis of our society will be in danger. </i>

16
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,193
<i>Don't worry, it'll all make sense. </i>
<i>I'm a professional. </i>

17
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,065
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!

18
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:28,665
And I'm Ted... Hold on.
Bill, here, you take it.

19
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,069
Okay.

20
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,275
- And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.
- Yeah!

21
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,552
And we're Wyld Stallyns!

22
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,400
- Smell it, dude.
- Let's bail.

23
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,946
We blew it.

24
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,877
Guess we used too much power.

25
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,818
I liked it.

26
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:22,087
While I agree that, in time,
our band will be most triumphant...

27
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,130
...the truth is,
Wyld Stallyns will never be a super band...

28
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,223
...until we have Eddie Van Halen on guitar.

29
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,803
Yes, but I do not believe
we will get Eddie Van Halen...

30
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,498
...until we have a triumphant video.

31
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,508
It's pointless to have a triumphant video...

32
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,067
...before we even have decent instruments.

33
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,511
How could we have decent instruments
if we don't know how to play?

34
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,207
That is why we need Eddie Van Halen!

35
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,209
And that is why we need
a triumphant video.

36
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,551
Excellent!

37
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,358
- We're late!
- For what?

38
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,962
- For school, dude!
- Yeah.

39
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,338
Bill, I'm waiting.

40
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,636
He's dead?

41
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,786
What you're telling me, essentially,
is that Napoleon...

42
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,255
...was a short dead dude.

43
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,049
Yeah.

44
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,724
You totally blew it, dude.

45
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,155
- Ted, stand up.
- Stand up?

46
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,597
Yes, son. Stand up.

47
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,663
Now...

48
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,899
Who was Joan of Arc?

49
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,665
Noah's wife.

50
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,848
Listen, guys, don't forget:
Tomorrow, final report...

51
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,781
...1:30 to 3:30, okay?

52
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,954
Guys.

53
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,495
Mr. Ryan...

54
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:10,626
Before you say anything,
my distinguished colleague, Ted, and I...

55
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,294
...wish to express to you our thanks...

56
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,439
...for all the things
we have learned in your class.

57
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,874
And what have you learned?

58
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,848
We've learned
that the world has a great history.

59
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:30,881
Yes. And that thanks
to great leaders such as...

60
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,915
...Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc...

61
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,017
...and Socratic Method...

62
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,792
...the world is full of history.

63
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:47,732
It seems to me the only thing
you've learned is that Caesar...

64
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,872
...is a "salad-dressing dude. "

65
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,542
Bill, Ted, this is really quite simple.

66
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,048
You have flunked
every section of this class.

67
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,210
Now, unless you get an A plus
on your final oral report tomorrow...

68
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,149
...guys, I have no choice
but to flunk the both of you.

69
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,453
You know your topics.

70
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,662
So I would suggest
you at least cover those areas...

71
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,131
...if you want to pass the course.

72
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,796
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

73
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,732
Okay.

74
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:28,171
Your report
had better be something very special.

75
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,476
Man.

76
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,014
What are we supposed to know
for our report?

77
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm not sure.

78
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,761
One thing I know is that
Joan of Arc is not Noah's wife.

79
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:47,459
- Then who is Noah's wife?
- I don't know, Ted.

80
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,836
But I do know we're in serious trouble.
Listen to this:

81
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,899
"Express to the class
how an important historical figure...

82
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,704
"... from each of your time periods...

83
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,235
"... would view the world
of San Dimas, 1988."

84
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,778
We're in danger of flunking
most heinously tomorrow.

85
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,684
- Hi, Bill. Want a ride?
- Sure, Missy.

86
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,080
I mean, Mom.

87
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,563
- Your stepmom is cute.
- Shut up.

88
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,964
Remember when she was a senior
and we were freshmen?

89
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,537
I'll be right back as soon as I get my books.

90
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,248
- What are you doing home, Dad?
- I'm looking for my keys.

91
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,793
You haven't done anything with them?

92
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,392
No, sir.

93
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,831
I spoke to your principal today.

94
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,997
- He said you're failing history.
- Me and Bill...

95
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,507
He also said that if you fail history,
you flunk out of school.

96
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,673
You know what that would mean,
don't you?

97
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:11,072
That I would have to go
to Oates Military Academy, sir.

98
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,445
I spoke to Col. Oates this morning.

99
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,116
He's anxious to meet you.

100
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,432
Dude, we gotta pass,
otherwise there's no more band.

101
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,681
- Why?
- My dad's sending me to military school.

102
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,576
Where?

103
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,245
Alaska.

104
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,348
Alaska.

105
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:01,356
It is time. Their separation is imminent.

106
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,992
Be excellent to each other.

107
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,395
Party on, dude.

108
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,165
<i>Okay, Ted, George Washington. </i>

109
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,235
- One: The father of our country.
- Two: Born on Presidents' Day.

110
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,332
Three: The dollar-bill guy.

111
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,503
You ever made
a mushroom out of his head?

112
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,002
Alaska.

113
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,173
Okay.

114
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,117
Had wooden teeth, chased Moby Dick.

115
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,247
That's Capt. Ahab, dude.

116
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,158
Wait. Remember Disney World?

117
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,855
- Hall of Presidents?
- Yeah, good. What did he say?

118
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,398
"Welcome to the Hall of Presidents. "

119
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,562
Hi. I brought you guys some food.

120
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,483
It's your mom, dude.

121
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,681
How's it going?

122
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,215
Bad.

123
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:10,560
We're destined to flunk
most egregiously tomorrow.

124
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:15,295
And I am destined to end up
at Oates Military Academy.

125
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,165
And then we will never start our band.

126
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,473
Good.

127
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,742
- What are you guys studying, anyway?
- History.

128
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,111
Mr. Ryan?

129
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,318
Tell him hi.

130
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,651
Why don't you guys take a dinner break?

131
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,291
Thanks, Dad.

132
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,705
Now your dad is going for it
in your own room.

133
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,006
Shut up.

134
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,906
- Your stepmom is cute, though.
- Shut up.

135
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,282
- Remember when I asked her to the prom?
- Shut up!

136
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,383
1275.

137
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,362
Okay, the lady in that car over there...

138
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,866
...said that Marco Polo was
in the year 1275.

139
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,232
It's not just a water sport. I knew it.

140
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,599
Excuse me.
When did the Mongols rule China?

141
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,506
I don't know. I just work here.

142
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,684
- You want to try the Thrifty Mart?
- Sure.

143
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,636
Not bad.

144
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,810
Greetings, my excellent friends.

145
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,643
Do you know
when the Mongols ruled China?

146
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,988
Perhaps we can ask them.

147
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,760
Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

148
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,557
And Ted "Theodore" Logan.

149
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,833
Gentlemen...

150
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,536
I'm here to help you
with your history report.

151
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,175
- What?
- How?

152
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,871
I hate that part.

153
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,341
- Bill.
- What?

154
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,945
Strange things are afoot at the Circle K.

155
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,987
Dudes, you guys are going to
go back in time!

156
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,862
You are going to have the most excellent
adventure through history.

157
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,437
- Who are you guys?
- We're you, dude!

158
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,235
No way.

159
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,206
- No way.
- Yes way!

160
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,473
We know how you feel.

161
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,175
We didn't believe it either
when we were you...

162
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,082
...and we-us said
what we-us are saying right now.

163
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,619
Okay, wait.

164
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,512
If you guys are really us...

165
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,326
...what number are we thinking of?

166
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,556
Sixty-nine, dudes!

167
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:42,966
- Look, dudes, we gotta go.
- Yeah, we gotta get back to the report.

168
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,268
Rufus!

169
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,944
Listen to this dude Rufus.
He knows what he's talking about.

170
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,745
Right. And, Ted,
give my love to the princesses.

171
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,948
- Who?
- You'll see.

172
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,686
Gentlemen, is everything all right?

173
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,727
Yeah, except how come
the number we dialed...

174
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,261
Don't forget to wind your watch!

175
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,064
Thanks, Rufus.

176
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,266
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

177
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,847
Dude, are you sure
we should be doing this?

178
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,819
Ted, you and I have witnessed
many things...

179
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,722
...but nothing as bodacious
as what just happened.

180
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,627
Besides, we told ourselves
to listen to this guy.

181
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,597
What if we were lying?

182
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,169
Why would we lie to ourselves?

183
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,843
How are you going to help us?

184
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,507
Yeah, are you going to call someone
and get the answers?

185
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,780
Gentlemen, we're going to do
a lot more than that.

186
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,350
Excellent.

187
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,961
<i>Brace yourselves, amigos. </i>

188
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,403
Gentlemen...

189
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,367
We're history.

190
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,242
Rufus, where are we, dude?

191
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,049
These are the circuits of history,
gentlemen.

192
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,990
They'll take us
to any point in time we wish.

193
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,151
How?

194
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,223
Modern technology, William.

195
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:07,309
- That was most unprecedented, Rufus.
- Yeah.

196
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,054
But where are we, Rufus?

197
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,721
Austria, 1805.

198
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,253
The French have just invaded.

199
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,300
Bill, check it out!

200
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,659
We're in the middle of a war, dude!

201
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,814
<i>Amigos, time to depart. </i>

202
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,347
How's it going, dude?

203
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,623
Now where are we, dude?

204
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,857
It's my house.

205
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,458
Rufus, can we go
anywhere we want at any time?

206
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,364
You can do anything you want...

207
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,064
...as long as you remember this:
No matter what happens...

208
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,937
...you must get to that report. Got it?

209
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,970
<i>All right, amigos... </i>

210
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,171
...that book will give you the number
of anyplace you want to go.

211
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,618
Now, most important,
no matter what you do...

212
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:51,349
...no matter where you go,
that clock, the clock in San Dimas...

213
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,382
...is always running.

214
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,823
- Got it?
- Yeah.

215
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,323
All right, time for me to go.

216
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,822
- What do you mean, Rufus?
- Yeah, aren't you coming with us?

217
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,794
Gentlemen, you're on your own.

218
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,344
- Ted?
- What?

219
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,781
This has been a most unusual day.

220
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,227
- It's Napoleon.
- Who?

221
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,967
The short dead dude
from our history review.

222
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,368
I have a most excellent idea.

223
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,406
Grab his legs. We gotta get him inside.

224
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,241
I think I figured out
a way to pass our report.

225
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,441
How?

226
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:55,850
We got one historical figure here,
maybe we can go back and get more.

227
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,547
Yeah.

228
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,025
Deacon, you have to watch this guy.

229
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:05,553
His name is Napoleon.
He is a very famous French dude.

230
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,532
We've decided to collect
other important figures from history...

231
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,397
...for an oral report we are doing.

232
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,166
While we are gone,
you are not to let him out of your sight.

233
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:18,005
Here is some money.
Take him to the movies or something.

234
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,809
Napoleon?

235
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,680
I am Bill.

236
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:34,453
We'll take you back to France after
you tell us what you think of San Dimas.

237
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:38,224
- This is Ted's little brother, Deacon.
- Hi.

238
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,821
He'll take care of you.

239
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,266
- Ready, Ted?
- Ready, Bill.

240
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,766
Let's go back into history.

241
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,545
This should be most triumphant.

242
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,776
I want to speak with you, son.

243
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,346
Alone, please, Bill.

244
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,286
All right, sit down.

245
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,121
What am I going to do with you?

246
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,356
Great.

247
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,660
You lose my keys, you fail history.

248
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,994
You spend all your time
with your loser friend...

249
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,095
...planning a band that will never happen.

250
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,630
You're not to leave this house
until tomorrow morning.

251
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,401
Yes?

252
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,883
<i>Capt. Logan, this is Dep. Van Halen</i>
<i>down at the station. </i>

253
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,982
Dep. Van Halen?

254
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,758
I'm new, dude... sir.

255
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,991
Look, we found your keys...

256
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,395
<i>... and if you want them,</i>
<i>you better come and get them. </i>

257
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:55,631
When I get back from the station,
I want you packed and ready to go. Got it?

258
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,673
We are in serious trouble.

259
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:08,044
My dad already signed me up.
My plane leaves tomorrow night.

260
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,113
That's only if we fail, dude.

261
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,286
No way!

262
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:22,929
Okay, we got Sigmund Frood,
Beeth Oven...

263
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:27,199
Is there one for the Western Movement
in America in the 19th century?

264
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,198
Yeah.

265
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,208
Well, then...

266
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,077
Let's reach out and touch someone.

267
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,557
How's it going, Old West dude?

268
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,465
This is just like Frontierland.

269
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:34,004
Yeah, but you can get shot here.

270
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,138
- So just try to act natural.
- Okay.

271
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,580
- Howdy, partner.
- Howdy.

272
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,106
- Watch out for the horse crap.
- Thanks, dude.

273
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,947
- I'm totally thirsty.
- Me, too.

274
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,165
Two beers, please.

275
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:17,808
- He didn't even card us, dude.
- Yeah, we'll have to remember this place.

276
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,656
Who should we take with us?

277
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,199
- Who's he?
- He's Billy the Kid.

278
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:45,009
He's famous, dude. Let's bag him.

279
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,606
I need two men.

280
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,844
Who's with me?

281
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,578
We're with you, Billy the Kid.

282
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:08,755
Here's the deal. What I win, I keep.

283
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,459
What you win, I keep.

284
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,401
Sounds good, Mr. The Kid.

285
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:34,549
Dude, you've got to have
a poker face like me.

286
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,427
Three aces!

287
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,327
What the hell's going on here, Billy?

288
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,997
Are you a-cheatin' us, Kid?

289
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,803
Cheating? Me?

290
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,029
Excellent!

291
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:26,542
Look, we're totally weak.
We can't possibly fight you.

292
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:30,504
However, how would you gentlemen like...

293
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:35,612
...free passes to Waterloo,
home of excellent waterslides?

294
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,145
Nice try, dude.

295
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,798
Come on.

296
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,005
- Look.
- It's the Goodyear blimp.

297
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,485
I can't believe they fell for that.

298
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,921
- Let's get 'em!
- Let's kill them!

299
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,223
Come on!

300
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,763
- You guys saved my life.
- Nothing doing, Billy the Kid.

301
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,359
- Where are we going?
- The golden age of civilization.

302
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,735
- Where?
- Ancient Greece, dude.

303
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,003
Don't worry, we'll bring you back
as soon as you talk at our report.

304
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:33,800
What?

305
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,879
Socrates?

306
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:14,979
- We know that name.
- Yeah. Look him up.

307
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,919
It's under "So-crates. "

308
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,585
Yeah.

309
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,626
"So-crates:

310
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,863
"'The only true wisdom...

311
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,991
"'... consists in knowing
that you know nothing. "'

312
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,096
That's us, dude!

313
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,734
Yeah!

314
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,299
- Let's bag him.
- Yeah.

315
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,883
How's it going?

316
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:08,929
I'm Bill. This is Ted.
We're from the future.

317
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,776
Socrates.

318
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:15,941
Now what?

319
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,849
I don't know.

320
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,949
Philosophize with him.

321
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:32,486
"All we are is dust in the wind," dude.

322
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:41,730
Dust.

323
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,700
Wind.

324
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:45,965
Dude.

325
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,384
Let's get out of here, dude.

326
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,165
All right!

327
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,107
Not bad, eh, So-crates?

328
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,605
- Where are we, dude?
- England, 15th century.

329
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,747
We are in most excellent shape
for our report.

330
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,447
Yeah, all we need is one
more speaker from Medieval.

331
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,818
Excellent.

332
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,584
Billy, you are dealing with
the oddity of time travel...

333
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,685
...with the greatest of ease.

334
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,228
Excuse me.

335
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,757
Do you know where
there are any personages...

336
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,632
...of historical significance around here?

337
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,311
Check it out!

338
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,373
Must be the castle of King Henry.

339
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,641
Let's go, dude!

340
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,412
Billy, guard the booth.

341
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,054
And watch So-crates.

342
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,091
Who should we get for Medieval?

343
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,526
How about that gnarly old goat dude?

344
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,275
I'm in love, dude.

345
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:36,687
Those must be the princesses
you told yourself about at the Circle K.

346
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:42,225
We gotta go.
It's a history report, not a babe report.

347
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,360
But, Bill...

348
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,561
Those are historical babes.

349
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,725
Okay.

350
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:55,331
You're the ladies' man.
How are we gonna meet them?

351
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,247
Excellent!

352
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,718
- Bill.
- What?

353
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,989
- These are heavy.
- Yeah.

354
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,562
Heavy metal.

355
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,534
- We better go find the princesses.
- Yeah.

356
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,004
Watch it!

357
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,941
Who turned out all the lights?

358
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,781
- What?
- I'm Darth Ted.

359
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,614
I'm Luke Bill.
And you're not my father! No!

360
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,152
Come on!

361
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,488
Beat you, I will, yes!

362
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,168
- I totally conquered you, dude!
- No way!

363
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:02,967
Come on!

364
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,203
I'll never rule the universe with you!

365
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,845
- Bill!
- What?

366
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:13,782
- We totally know how to sword fight!
- Yeah!

367
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,843
Search the castle! There might be more!

368
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,208
Get out of here!

369
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,150
Bogus.

370
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,922
Heinous.

371
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,859
Most non-triumphant.

372
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,642
Don't be dead, dude.

373
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:59,254
You killed Ted, you medieval dickweed!

374
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,907
Ted! You're alive!

375
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:29,214
Yeah! I fell out of my suit
when I hit the floor.

376
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,287
Fag!

377
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:37,217
Dude, you totally boned that dude
in the head!

378
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,625
He's a total bonehead!

379
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:43,594
He's a fat old man. There must be a way
to escape before the night falls.

380
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:44,896
But how?

381
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,563
What's that?

382
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,937
Those boys. I can't believe they're here.

383
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,572
How's it going, ladies?

384
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,685
You're the ones
we saw in front of the castle.

385
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,114
I am Ted of San Dimas.

386
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:11,926
And I bring to you a message of love.

387
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:15,692
From who?

388
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,259
From myself.

389
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,028
And what is this message you speak of?

390
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:28,201
Lyrics, dude. Recite them some lyrics.

391
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,684
O you beautiful babes from England...

392
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,445
...for whom we have
traveled through time...

393
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,355
...will you go to the prom with us
in San Dimas?

394
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,690
We will have a most triumphant time.

395
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,224
Way to go, dude.

396
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,158
It's Father!

397
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,703
What does your father want?

398
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,270
We're to be married to
two horrible old men today.

399
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:05,542
No way!

400
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,376
Will you help us escape?

401
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,014
Of course, babes.

402
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,561
How's it going, royal ugly dudes?

403
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,631
I'm the Earl of Preston.

404
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:28,599
And I am the Duke of Ted.

405
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,521
Put them in the iron maiden.

406
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,320
Iron maiden? Excellent!

407
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:50,955
Execute them.

408
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,586
Bogus.

409
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,197
We'll save you, babes!

410
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,834
Witches! Heretics! I saw them!

411
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,039
They fell from the sky!

412
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,742
Heretics!

413
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,513
They fell out of the sky!

414
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:15,115
They had fire in their eyes
and they had horns!

415
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,259
Off with their heads!

416
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,237
- Bill?
- What?

417
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:39,234
I believe our adventure through time
has taken a most serious turn.

418
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,516
- Billy!
- So-crates!

419
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,288
Let's go!

420
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,928
Guards! After them!

421
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,460
- So-crates!
- Bye, babes!

422
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,591
Catch you later, evil dudes.

423
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,670
Kill them! Guards!

424
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,578
Hurry up!

425
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,115
Out of the way!

426
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,190
Dial fast, dude!

427
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,067
<i>The number you have</i>
<i>dialed is not in service at this time. </i>

428
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,004
<i>Please check your directory and dial again. </i>

429
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,404
<i>Party on, dude. </i>

430
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,775
Okay, I got one! Let's go!

431
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,945
You guys stay here.

432
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,684
Where are we, dude?

433
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,292
I don't know.

434
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:15,289
- Sure do play excellent music.
- Most outstanding.

435
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,748
- It's you.
- Yeah. It's us.

436
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,455
Who are we?

437
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,838
I think they want us to say something.

438
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,940
What should I say?

439
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,979
Make something up.

440
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,719
Be excellent to each other.

441
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,063
Party on, dudes.

442
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,704
Good one, dude.

443
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,306
Got to get back to our report.

444
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:14,317
Yeah. We'd take you with us,
but it's a history report...

445
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,148
...not a future report.

446
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,818
Later.

447
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:22,987
Later.

448
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,629
- Let's get back and do our report.
- Good idea.

449
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:51,850
- Dude! Where are we going?
- I don't know! I think the booth's broke!

450
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:55,550
We've got to keep dialing San Dimas
until we get back and get Napoleon.

451
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,427
Behold.

452
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:01,924
The Zyggie Pig.

453
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:05,662
The single greatest ice-cream spectacle
known to man.

454
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:10,173
"Eat the Pig, eat the Pig,
zyggie, zyggie, zyggie, zyg!"

455
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:15,668
<i>Embêtants!</i>

456
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,882
It's ice cream.

457
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,216
You eat it.

458
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,684
It's good.

459
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:27,981
<i>La glace. </i>

460
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,592
Whatever. Just eat it.

461
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:52,812
All behold!

462
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:56,785
- He ate the Pig, thus proving that he's...
- A...

463
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,846
"Zyggie piggy!"

464
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,073
What's that?

465
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,513
I don't know.

466
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,153
Shit!

467
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,079
Where did we land now?

468
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:59,345
Dude, it's Sigmund Frood.

469
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,951
How much time we got left?

470
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,083
Tons. Why?

471
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,617
Extra credit, dude.

472
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,123
How's it going, Frood dude?

473
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:25,036
What is this? Let go of me.
What are you doing?

474
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:07,349
<i>Was</i>? <i>Was ist los</i>?

475
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,645
Come on, So-crates.

476
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,567
Welcome aboard, Miss Joan of Arc.

477
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,332
My name is Ted and this is Bill.

478
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,965
Want a Twinkie, Genghis Khan?

479
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,862
Say please.

480
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,501
Come on, guys. Jump him!

481
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,439
Candygram!

482
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,422
Yes, what can I...

483
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,997
We've got plenty of time,
but we don't have any more room left.

484
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,269
- Ted, we're out of control.
- What?

485
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,503
Next place we stop...

486
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:18,173
...we gotta try and figure out
what's wrong with the booth.

487
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:28,917
Bill, I think I got an idea what's wrong.

488
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,352
What?

489
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,592
The antenna's broken.

490
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,896
Yeah. All right.

491
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:13,096
<i>Attends. </i>

492
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:18,696
<i>Crétin. </i>

493
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,994
Come on, let's ditch him.

494
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:46,067
<i>Attends!</i>

495
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:48,932
<i>Attends!</i>

496
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:55,174
<i>- Excusez-moi, monsieur. </i>
- Hold on there. Not so fast, buddy.

497
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,304
- "Buddy"?
- You ain't paid yet.

498
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,014
- Pay?
- Pay.

499
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,523
I don't want to see
you around here anymore! Beat it!

500
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:11,823
<i>- Vous me connaissez, monsieur</i>?
- Beat it, buddy!

501
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:14,556
<i>Idiot!</i>

502
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:32,675
Deacon!

503
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:46,920
Here is a treat to make
our minor prehistoric pit stop...

504
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,428
...a bit more enjoyable.

505
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,600
Why, thank you.

506
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,798
Thanks, guys.

507
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,103
I sure hope this works.

508
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,777
I think it's working, dude.

509
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,659
Just a little farther, I hope.

510
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,347
That's us. We're back in San Dimas!

511
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:16,450
Yeah. Only now it's not now,
it's last night.

512
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,809
Dude.

513
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,720
- What?
- Let's go talk to ourselves.

514
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,121
Excellent.

515
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:26,595
- What did we say, anyways?
- I don't know. Let's go find out.

516
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,496
Sixty-nine, dudes!

517
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,937
Look, dudes, we gotta go.

518
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,972
Listen to this dude Rufus.
He knows what he's talking about.

519
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:45,447
Right. And, Ted,
give my love to the princesses.

520
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,710
- Who?
- You'll see.

521
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:52,713
Gentlemen, is everything all right?

522
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,247
Yeah, except how come
the number we dialed for San Dimas...

523
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:59,090
...brought us here
instead of to tomorrow, Rufus?

524
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:02,222
Because in San Dimas
it is tomorrow, William.

525
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,665
You have to dial one number higher.

526
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:08,397
Yeah. Thanks, Rufus.

527
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:11,104
And hurry,
because you don't have much time.

528
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:14,075
What do you mean, Rufus?
We got 10 hours left.

529
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,878
You got two hours.

530
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:22,517
Ted, you forgot to wind your watch again.
And after you reminded yourself not to.

531
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:27,679
I better remind myself again.
Don't forget to wind your watch!

532
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:30,850
Thanks, Rufus.

533
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,963
Catch you later, Bill and Ted.

534
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,030
That conversation
made more sense this time.

535
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:42,094
- Watch the gonads, dude.
- Abe, you're too tall, man.

536
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,737
That's just the way I'm built.

537
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,181
Great, we made it!

538
00:55:57,586 --> 00:56:00,851
<i>Who's the señorita</i>? <i>She's cute. </i>

539
00:56:00,923 --> 00:56:02,652
It's his mom, dude.

540
00:56:06,295 --> 00:56:07,353
Hi, guys.

541
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:09,488
Hi, Missy, I mean, Mom.

542
00:56:11,266 --> 00:56:14,895
Miss Preston,
we'd like you to meet some of our friends.

543
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,167
Yeah, this is Dave Beeth Oven.

544
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:20,508
<i>Sie sind so schön, Madame. </i>

545
00:56:20,642 --> 00:56:24,510
And Maxine of Arc, Missy.

546
00:56:25,647 --> 00:56:27,171
Herman the Kid.

547
00:56:28,016 --> 00:56:29,415
Bob Genghis Khan.

548
00:56:30,419 --> 00:56:32,512
So-crates Johnson.

549
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:34,717
Dennis Frood.

550
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,421
And...

551
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:40,653
Abraham Lincoln.

552
00:56:41,597 --> 00:56:45,363
It's nice to meet you all.
There are sodas in the fridge.

553
00:56:47,336 --> 00:56:49,201
Can you give us a ride someplace?

554
00:56:49,271 --> 00:56:52,434
Bill, I'm not taking you anywhere
until you do your chores.

555
00:57:28,977 --> 00:57:30,638
Done!

556
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:34,713
This is the San Dimas Mall...

557
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:38,047
...and this is where
people of today's world hang out.

558
00:57:39,121 --> 00:57:41,589
All right, everybody,
watch your step getting off.

559
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:44,820
Beeth Oven,
make sure you don't get sucked under.

560
00:57:47,162 --> 00:57:50,393
Everybody get together.
Remember who your buddy is.

561
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:54,034
So-crates, watch out for your robe, dude.

562
00:57:56,772 --> 00:57:57,796
Okay.

563
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:00,507
Follow me.

564
00:58:00,576 --> 00:58:03,943
You got your Broadway down here,
you got your Sears over here.

565
00:58:04,546 --> 00:58:08,846
<i>The stratification of our society</i>
<i>is much like Marie-Antoinette's. </i>

566
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:10,441
<i>The few possess much... </i>

567
00:58:10,819 --> 00:58:14,186
<i>... while the masses possess little</i>
<i>but their television sets. </i>

568
00:58:14,323 --> 00:58:16,587
<i>This dichotomy led to a revolution... </i>

569
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:19,627
<i>... in which Antoinette</i>
<i>and her husband were beheaded. </i>

570
00:58:19,695 --> 00:58:22,255
<i>Today, leaders are impeached</i>
<i>rather than beheaded. </i>

571
00:58:23,232 --> 00:58:27,726
<i>Still, while in her day, Marie-Antoinette</i>
<i>said, "Let them eat cake... "</i>

572
00:58:27,803 --> 00:58:30,931
<i>... perhaps today she'd say,</i>
<i>"Let them eat fast food. "</i>

573
00:58:36,945 --> 00:58:40,437
- Enjoy!
- Okay, look around. See what you think.

574
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:43,282
We'll be back as soon as
we find Napoleon, okay?

575
00:58:44,052 --> 00:58:46,612
Come on, dude. We don't got much time.

576
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:48,781
Yes, but what do we eat?

577
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:51,020
You ditched Napoleon?

578
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:55,955
Do you realize you've stranded one of
Europe's greatest leaders in San Dimas?

579
00:58:56,031 --> 00:58:57,020
He was a dick!

580
00:59:01,436 --> 00:59:03,631
How are we going to find him?

581
00:59:06,241 --> 00:59:07,503
Okay, wait.

582
00:59:08,377 --> 00:59:11,505
If we were one of
the greatest generals in history...

583
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,872
...and we were stranded
in San Dimas for one day...

584
00:59:15,784 --> 00:59:17,445
...where would we go?

585
00:59:21,189 --> 00:59:22,451
Waterloo!

586
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:39,037
Eleven children, please. Are you okay?

587
00:59:43,412 --> 00:59:44,936
We're going.

588
00:59:46,248 --> 00:59:47,476
Come on.

589
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:52,252
<i>Mon Dieu. </i>

590
01:00:09,104 --> 01:00:11,072
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est ça</i>?

591
01:00:11,807 --> 01:00:14,207
Buddy, you're holding up the line!

592
01:00:18,013 --> 01:00:20,504
<i>- Sacrebleu. </i>
- Come on, buddy.

593
01:01:43,665 --> 01:01:45,098
<i>Fantastique!</i>

594
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:48,933
Come on, Napoleon.
Everybody's waiting for us at the mall.

595
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:58,639
<i>Why be soft and flabby</i>
<i>when you can be firm and trim</i>?

596
01:01:58,714 --> 01:02:00,511
<i>When you can have a body that cries:</i>

597
01:02:00,582 --> 01:02:02,550
<i>"Look at me! Admire me!"</i>

598
01:02:02,617 --> 01:02:05,518
<i>With our specialized weight-training</i>
<i>and aerobics program... </i>

599
01:02:05,587 --> 01:02:09,853
<i>... we can help you attain the kind of body</i>
<i>you've only dreamed of having. </i>

600
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:12,085
All right, let's go, ladies!

601
01:02:12,861 --> 01:02:16,092
You guys are looking great! Okay!

602
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:19,229
Jumping jacks! Up!

603
01:02:25,006 --> 01:02:26,268
You a musician?

604
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,242
Here. Try this.

605
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,503
What is this?

606
01:02:56,938 --> 01:02:59,634
- Oh, my God.
- What are they doing?

607
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:02,768
Yeah, don't you think? Look at his sandals.

608
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:06,547
I don't believe his clothes.

609
01:03:06,882 --> 01:03:09,874
- Weird.
- They're coming over to sit down.

610
01:03:12,454 --> 01:03:13,478
Hi.

611
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:15,220
I'm Billy.

612
01:03:15,957 --> 01:03:17,686
This here is So-crates.

613
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,624
- Socrates.
- We're from history.

614
01:03:22,697 --> 01:03:27,191
Hello. I'm Dr. Freud,
but you may call me Siggy.

615
01:03:27,736 --> 01:03:30,534
Oh, my God.

616
01:03:31,006 --> 01:03:34,806
You both seem to be suffering
from a mild form of hysteria.

617
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:38,004
- God!
- You are such a geek.

618
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:43,414
Way to go, egghead.

619
01:03:45,554 --> 01:03:48,546
- Geek.
- What is a geek?

620
01:04:21,489 --> 01:04:23,252
I need help. I got a live one here.

621
01:04:27,562 --> 01:04:30,895
Okay, I need the Lincoln hat
and the stupid beard back.

622
01:04:30,966 --> 01:04:34,402
You don't understand.
I'm Abraham Lincoln.

623
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:37,771
Yeah, right. Come on, mister!

624
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:40,433
- It's my hat and my beard!
- Come on!

625
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:51,418
Keep it up! You're looking great!

626
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:12,765
- Take it easy there!
- Stop! Hold it right there!

627
01:05:12,841 --> 01:05:14,468
Cut that guy off!

628
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:19,673
Stop him!

629
01:05:33,061 --> 01:05:36,030
- No, Sig! Over here!
- Excuse me, miss.

630
01:05:36,665 --> 01:05:39,065
- Move.
- Pardon me.

631
01:05:41,503 --> 01:05:45,098
<i>- I demand einen lawyer. </i>
- Don't get smart, buddy. Let's go.

632
01:06:01,923 --> 01:06:03,686
There they are!

633
01:06:12,133 --> 01:06:14,158
All right, come on, grandpa.

634
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,600
Bogus!

635
01:06:22,911 --> 01:06:24,469
That's enough.

636
01:06:32,988 --> 01:06:35,115
Mom, can't you go any faster?

637
01:06:50,905 --> 01:06:54,636
I want to know
why you claim to be Sigmund Freud.

638
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,405
Why do you claim I'm not Sigmund Freud?

639
01:06:57,545 --> 01:07:00,275
Why do you
keep asking me these questions?

640
01:07:01,316 --> 01:07:02,908
Tell me about your mother.

641
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,779
God.

642
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,512
- Would you like a couch to lie on?
- No, I don't want a couch to lie on.

643
01:07:15,964 --> 01:07:19,229
- All right. What's your name?
- Abraham Lincoln.

644
01:07:19,701 --> 01:07:22,693
That's L-I-N-C-O-L-N.

645
01:07:23,671 --> 01:07:25,366
I know how to spell "Lincoln. "

646
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:30,102
What's your birthday, Mr. Lincoln?

647
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:34,009
February 12, 1809.

648
01:07:37,419 --> 01:07:40,013
<i>Everything is different, but the same. </i>

649
01:07:41,222 --> 01:07:44,282
<i>Things are more moderner than before. </i>

650
01:07:44,492 --> 01:07:45,754
<i>Bigger... </i>

651
01:07:46,761 --> 01:07:48,695
<i>... and yet smaller. </i>

652
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:54,462
<i>There's computers. </i>

653
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:00,703
Take your time.

654
01:08:01,543 --> 01:08:04,011
<i>San Dimas high-school football rules!</i>

655
01:08:18,393 --> 01:08:21,123
I can't believe my dad arrested them all.

656
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:24,163
What are we going to do?

657
01:08:24,232 --> 01:08:27,599
You go in and talk to your dad.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

658
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:31,230
Missy, I mean, Mom,
please keep an eye on Napoleon.

659
01:08:33,808 --> 01:08:34,797
Stay.

660
01:08:39,547 --> 01:08:42,778
- Lock him up with the rest of the wackos.
- I am a lawyer, you know.

661
01:08:42,851 --> 01:08:45,615
- Dad!
- You pack your bags.

662
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:47,950
- What?
- You're going to military school.

663
01:08:48,022 --> 01:08:50,013
- But, Dad...
- I don't wanna hear it!

664
01:08:50,959 --> 01:08:53,587
You go home and you pack your bags now!

665
01:09:01,136 --> 01:09:02,797
- How'd it go?
- Bad.

666
01:09:02,871 --> 01:09:07,365
Our historical figures are all locked up
and my dad won't let them out.

667
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:09,304
Can we get your dad's keys?

668
01:09:09,377 --> 01:09:12,744
We could steal them,
but he lost them two days ago.

669
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:17,342
If only we could go back in time
to when he had them and steal 'em then.

670
01:09:18,553 --> 01:09:21,283
- Why can't we?
- 'Cause we don't got time.

671
01:09:21,456 --> 01:09:23,390
We could do it after the report.

672
01:09:24,592 --> 01:09:26,150
Good thinking, dude!

673
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:28,855
After the report,
we'll time travel back to two days ago...

674
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,898
...steal the keys and leave them here!

675
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:35,034
- Where?
- Don't know. How about behind that sign?

676
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:39,601
That way, when we get here now,
they'll be waiting for us.

677
01:09:41,476 --> 01:09:43,808
- See?
- Yeah!

678
01:09:43,945 --> 01:09:48,279
So, after the report, we can't forget
to do this, otherwise it won't happen.

679
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:51,910
But it did happen!
It was me who stole my dad's keys!

680
01:09:52,153 --> 01:09:54,212
That's exactly it. Come on.

681
01:09:57,926 --> 01:09:59,188
- Mom?
- Yes?

682
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:02,186
- Can you please bring the car around back?
- Sure.

683
01:10:03,898 --> 01:10:07,459
Come on. We've got some
historical figures to rescue.

684
01:10:08,369 --> 01:10:09,836
Over and out.

685
01:10:25,787 --> 01:10:28,278
How are we going to get past my dad?

686
01:10:29,257 --> 01:10:32,158
- You got a tape recorder at home?
- Yeah.

687
01:10:33,094 --> 01:10:37,030
- Remember to get the tape recorder.
- Yeah.

688
01:10:37,098 --> 01:10:39,191
Set a timer on it for...

689
01:10:40,268 --> 01:10:41,360
2:13.

690
01:10:41,603 --> 01:10:43,434
- Got it?
- Got it.

691
01:10:46,107 --> 01:10:48,803
- What am I going to say on it?
<i>- Dad!</i>

692
01:10:50,078 --> 01:10:51,102
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

693
01:10:51,746 --> 01:10:53,270
It's you, dude.

694
01:10:57,652 --> 01:11:00,018
- Ted?
<i>- I'm over here. </i>

695
01:11:02,624 --> 01:11:04,922
<i>Yeah, this way!</i>

696
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:28,371
Look! Check it out.

697
01:11:30,618 --> 01:11:32,245
"Dear Bill and Ted.

698
01:11:32,353 --> 01:11:33,980
"Good luck on the report.

699
01:11:34,055 --> 01:11:38,549
"Sincerely, Bill S. Preston, Esquire
and Ted 'Theodore' Logan. "

700
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,120
That was nice of us.

701
01:11:40,862 --> 01:11:42,056
"P.S.

702
01:11:42,697 --> 01:11:43,857
"Duck!"

703
01:11:49,137 --> 01:11:50,229
Excellent work, dude.

704
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:52,170
- Way to go!
- Come on.

705
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:08,545
<i>- Merci. </i>
- People, time is of the essence.

706
01:12:08,623 --> 01:12:12,059
I ask that you all work together
so that we can get down to the car.

707
01:12:12,126 --> 01:12:13,889
Very quiet. Quiet!

708
01:12:15,997 --> 01:12:18,659
Against the wall, everybody, please.
Single file.

709
01:12:19,467 --> 01:12:22,561
- Hurry up, Billy.
- How do we get out of here?

710
01:12:22,904 --> 01:12:24,428
<i>Over here, Dad!</i>

711
01:12:24,839 --> 01:12:25,965
<i>Down here!</i>

712
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,372
<i>Way to go, dude. You stalled him. </i>

713
01:12:28,443 --> 01:12:30,206
<i>What else do I say</i>?

714
01:12:30,278 --> 01:12:34,977
<i>And now, opening for Iron Maiden,</i>
<i>Wyld Stallyns!</i>

715
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,318
Come on, put your back into it.

716
01:12:41,989 --> 01:12:44,219
What in the hell do you think you're doing?

717
01:12:44,759 --> 01:12:49,219
- Trashcan. Remember a trashcan.
- Trashcan? What are you talking about?

718
01:12:49,697 --> 01:12:51,221
Get this thing off me!

719
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:55,601
Sorry, Dad,
but we got to go pass our history report.

720
01:12:56,704 --> 01:12:58,763
By the way, I found your keys.

721
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:01,506
Where are you? Get this off me!

722
01:13:08,549 --> 01:13:12,918
<i>In conclusion, I think Abraham Lincoln</i>
<i>would be most impressed... </i>

723
01:13:12,987 --> 01:13:16,514
<i>... with the world of San Dimas. </i>
<i>I know I am. </i>

724
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:30,402
Down the hall, to the left. Quiet.

725
01:13:31,939 --> 01:13:35,534
And I'm sure I speak
for Mr. Ward and Mrs. Rowe...

726
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:38,945
...when I say that your reports
were very entertaining...

727
01:13:39,013 --> 01:13:41,447
...and very informative for all of us.

728
01:13:42,016 --> 01:13:44,780
It seems we may be
one report short today...

729
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:47,384
...so we'll leave just a bit early.

730
01:13:49,323 --> 01:13:52,588
But once again, I want to thank you all
for your very hard work.

731
01:13:54,562 --> 01:13:56,621
Who turned out the lights?

732
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:01,398
<i>Hello, San Dimas. </i>

733
01:14:01,903 --> 01:14:05,703
<i>Please welcome,</i>
<i>for the final report of the afternoon... </i>

734
01:14:06,007 --> 01:14:08,032
<i>... from all throughout history... </i>

735
01:14:08,142 --> 01:14:11,339
<i>... some of the greatest people</i>
<i>who have ever lived... </i>

736
01:14:11,813 --> 01:14:15,647
<i>... in their 1988 world tour!</i>

737
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,482
How's it going?

738
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:27,324
I'm Billy the Kid.

739
01:14:40,675 --> 01:14:43,576
I'd like you all to put your hands together.

740
01:14:50,384 --> 01:14:52,909
Now, my good friends...

741
01:14:54,021 --> 01:14:57,252
...Bill S. Preston, Esquire...

742
01:14:57,391 --> 01:15:00,019
...and Ted "Theodore" Logan.

743
01:15:01,429 --> 01:15:02,828
Thank you.

744
01:15:04,232 --> 01:15:06,359
Hello, San Dimas High.

745
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:10,702
Mr. Ryan,
fellow distinguished classmates...

746
01:15:10,838 --> 01:15:12,931
...teachers, babes.

747
01:15:13,975 --> 01:15:18,935
- Our first speaker was born in 470 B.C.
- Hi! Long time no see.

748
01:15:19,814 --> 01:15:21,714
A time when much of the world...

749
01:15:21,782 --> 01:15:25,240
...looked like the cover of
<i>the Led Zeppelin album Houses of the Holy. </i>

750
01:15:25,653 --> 01:15:30,613
We were there. There were many steps
and columns. It was most tranquil.

751
01:15:31,492 --> 01:15:34,791
He is sometimes known
as the father of modern thought.

752
01:15:35,096 --> 01:15:39,032
He was the teacher of Plato,
who was in turn the teacher of Aristotle.

753
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:44,126
And like Ozzy Osbourne, was repeatedly
accused of corruption of the young.

754
01:15:44,939 --> 01:15:46,930
And since he doesn't speak English...

755
01:15:47,008 --> 01:15:49,909
...my friend Ted, here,
is gonna interpret for him.

756
01:15:49,977 --> 01:15:53,174
So please welcome,
to tell us what he thinks of San Dimas...

757
01:15:53,247 --> 01:15:56,808
...the most bodacious
philosophizer in ancient Greece...

758
01:15:57,151 --> 01:15:58,812
...Socrates!

759
01:16:01,489 --> 01:16:04,822
...totally out of control.
I've got a good idea where he gets it.

760
01:16:04,892 --> 01:16:09,852
If you and your wife used a little discipline,
your son wouldn't be such a bad influence.

761
01:16:09,931 --> 01:16:11,922
Is discipline your key to success with Ted?

762
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:14,866
Yes, it is! He's going to
an Alaskan military school.

763
01:16:15,303 --> 01:16:18,136
...loves you best...

764
01:16:20,775 --> 01:16:22,402
...in all the world.

765
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:25,312
What are they doing up there?

766
01:16:26,447 --> 01:16:29,905
He also loves baseball.

767
01:16:31,252 --> 01:16:34,949
Therefore, Ted's father's
own fear of failure...

768
01:16:35,256 --> 01:16:38,521
...has caused him
to make his son the embodiment...

769
01:16:38,693 --> 01:16:43,653
...of all of his own deepest anxieties
about himself.

770
01:16:44,632 --> 01:16:49,035
And hence,
his aggression transference onto Ted.

771
01:16:53,608 --> 01:16:54,597
Okay?

772
01:16:57,011 --> 01:17:00,003
Yes.
Thank you very much, Sigmund Freud.

773
01:17:03,751 --> 01:17:06,777
No, just got a minor Oedipal complex.

774
01:17:08,889 --> 01:17:11,551
It is indeed a pleasure
to introduce to you...

775
01:17:11,726 --> 01:17:14,854
...a gentleman we picked up
in medieval Mongolia...

776
01:17:14,929 --> 01:17:16,920
...in the year 1269.

777
01:17:17,498 --> 01:17:20,490
Please welcome,
the very excellent barbarian...

778
01:17:20,635 --> 01:17:23,126
...Mr. Genghis Khan!

779
01:17:26,507 --> 01:17:29,533
This is a dude who, 700 years ago...

780
01:17:30,044 --> 01:17:34,208
...totally ravaged China,
and who, we are told, two hours ago...

781
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:36,875
...totally ravaged
Oshman's Sporting Goods.

782
01:17:39,186 --> 01:17:42,917
A most bodacious soldier and general...

783
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:46,448
...Miss Of Arc totally rousted
the English from France.

784
01:17:46,894 --> 01:17:50,227
And then she turned this dude,
Dauphin, into a king.

785
01:17:50,464 --> 01:17:53,092
And all this by the time she was 17.

786
01:17:54,368 --> 01:17:57,735
<i> Je vais remporter un triomphe terrible... </i>

787
01:17:58,305 --> 01:18:00,773
<i>... en Russie... </i>

788
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:04,875
<i>... avec mes waterslides. </i>

789
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,379
The music of Ludwig von Beethoven.

790
01:18:12,987 --> 01:18:15,615
As you can see,
Genghis very much enjoys Twinkies...

791
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:17,817
...because of the excellent sugar rush.

792
01:18:18,225 --> 01:18:20,989
He also loves billiards.

793
01:18:23,097 --> 01:18:26,624
Beethoven's favorite works include
<i>Mozart's Requiem... </i>

794
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:30,193
<i>... Handel's Messiah,</i>
<i>and Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet. </i>

795
01:18:31,238 --> 01:18:35,971
To improve on the condition of her armies,
Joan of Arc plans on instituting...

796
01:18:36,043 --> 01:18:39,774
...a full-scale aerobics program
on her return to France.

797
01:18:40,181 --> 01:18:42,649
I don't think it's going to work.

798
01:18:46,687 --> 01:18:48,382
<i>Triomphe, Napoléon!</i>

799
01:18:54,962 --> 01:18:56,327
He loves...

800
01:18:57,832 --> 01:18:59,857
He loves San Dimas.

801
01:19:09,643 --> 01:19:12,168
And now, for our last speaker.

802
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:18,211
One of the greatest presidents
in American history...

803
01:19:19,353 --> 01:19:22,516
...Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

804
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:45,378
Fourscore and...

805
01:19:47,715 --> 01:19:49,307
...seven minutes ago...

806
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:53,349
...we, your forefathers...

807
01:19:54,555 --> 01:19:59,151
...were brought forth upon
a most excellent adventure...

808
01:20:00,694 --> 01:20:04,289
...conceived by our new friends...

809
01:20:05,733 --> 01:20:06,927
...Bill...

810
01:20:09,069 --> 01:20:10,400
...and Ted.

811
01:20:12,473 --> 01:20:15,408
These two great gentlemen...

812
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:19,270
...are dedicated to a proposition...

813
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,671
...which was true in my time...

814
01:20:22,883 --> 01:20:24,851
...just as it's true today.

815
01:20:28,956 --> 01:20:32,551
Be excellent to each other.

816
01:20:34,595 --> 01:20:35,755
And...

817
01:20:37,298 --> 01:20:39,095
...party on, dudes!

818
01:20:47,842 --> 01:20:49,605
No way!

819
01:20:59,854 --> 01:21:01,981
Thank you, San Dimas High.

820
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:34,815
We want more!

821
01:21:41,695 --> 01:21:42,855
Intro.

822
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:46,094
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

823
01:21:57,878 --> 01:21:59,470
What's up, Ted?

824
01:22:03,918 --> 01:22:05,886
We traveled through time.

825
01:22:05,953 --> 01:22:10,913
I mean, we met lots of great leaders
and we got an A plus on our history report.

826
01:22:12,426 --> 01:22:15,554
And look at us. Nothing's different.

827
01:22:18,565 --> 01:22:20,396
Maybe it's time we get Eddie Van Halen.

828
01:22:22,403 --> 01:22:24,564
Maybe we should start
learning how to play.

829
01:22:25,973 --> 01:22:27,565
Maybe you're right.

830
01:22:42,957 --> 01:22:46,154
Hello again, my excellent friends.

831
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:51,154
Congratulations on
passing your history report.

832
01:22:52,266 --> 01:22:55,099
Rufus, the babes.

833
01:22:55,169 --> 01:22:57,467
We looked all over England for you.

834
01:22:57,538 --> 01:23:00,371
Where'd you get those savory clothes?

835
01:23:01,442 --> 01:23:04,502
Rufus introduced us to
a place called the mall.

836
01:23:05,012 --> 01:23:07,344
And something called credit cards.

837
01:23:08,282 --> 01:23:12,616
I got them out of England just before
they had to marry those royal ugly dudes.

838
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,647
Way to go, Rufus.

839
01:23:24,465 --> 01:23:26,797
How can we ever thank you, Rufus?

840
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:30,336
You can start by signing this for my kids.

841
01:23:31,372 --> 01:23:34,500
- Why?
- They're big fans of yours.

842
01:23:34,908 --> 01:23:37,103
- What?
- Everyone is.

843
01:23:37,678 --> 01:23:42,081
Wyld Stallyns' music has become
the foundation of our whole society.

844
01:23:43,851 --> 01:23:45,341
No way!

845
01:23:45,753 --> 01:23:47,448
Yes way!

846
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:52,758
In fact, I believe you were there.
That futuristic place with the domes?

847
01:23:53,627 --> 01:23:55,288
And the totally excellent music.

848
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:58,755
They totally worshipped us there.

849
01:23:58,932 --> 01:24:00,126
I know.

850
01:24:00,267 --> 01:24:04,328
That's why I was sent to make sure
you passed your history report.

851
01:24:04,505 --> 01:24:08,635
If you guys were separated, it would have
been disastrous for life as we know it.

852
01:24:09,043 --> 01:24:13,707
You see, eventually, your music
will help to end war and poverty.

853
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:18,147
It will align the planets
and bring them into universal harmony...

854
01:24:18,318 --> 01:24:21,151
...allowing meaningful contact
with all forms of life...

855
01:24:21,622 --> 01:24:26,116
...from extraterrestrial beings
to common household pets.

856
01:24:26,493 --> 01:24:27,653
And...

857
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:30,822
...it's excellent for dancing.

858
01:24:34,301 --> 01:24:37,134
Why don't you have the ladies sign as well,
would you please?

859
01:24:37,204 --> 01:24:40,196
- After all, they are in the band.
- They are?

860
01:24:40,274 --> 01:24:42,902
Excellent!

861
01:24:43,343 --> 01:24:45,538
Where are you going, Rufus?

862
01:24:46,213 --> 01:24:48,078
I got a surprise for you.

863
01:24:57,291 --> 01:24:58,280
Here.

864
01:24:59,726 --> 01:25:01,956
That's to help you
as you start your new band.

865
01:25:02,362 --> 01:25:03,727
Thanks, Rufus.

866
01:25:03,797 --> 01:25:07,426
I just have one further humble request:

867
01:25:07,768 --> 01:25:11,260
If I might be so honored to jam with you?

868
01:25:12,306 --> 01:25:15,798
- Do you know how to play, Rufus?
- I play a little.

869
01:25:39,766 --> 01:25:43,429
- Most outstanding.
- Let's jam.

870
01:25:51,712 --> 01:25:54,306
- Bill, my friend?
- Yes, Ted, my friend?

871
01:25:54,381 --> 01:25:57,282
This has been a most excellent adventure.

872
01:25:58,252 --> 01:25:59,651
- One.
- Two.

873
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,620
One, two, three, four!

874
01:26:08,495 --> 01:26:10,224
They do get better.
