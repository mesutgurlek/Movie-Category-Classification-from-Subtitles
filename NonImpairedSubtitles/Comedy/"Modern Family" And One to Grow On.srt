1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:04,241
- Hey, honey.
- You're just in time for breakfast.

2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:05,807
We should probably go light on the food.

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:08,319
Something tells me we're not gonna
want to do this on a full stomach.

4
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:11,880
I can't believe there's such a thing as autopsy camp.

5
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:14,426
There is no such thing as autopsy camp.

6
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:17,827
I had to trick Luke 'cause I'm actually
taking him to a ballroom dance class.

7
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:19,455
He's been resisting,
but it's in his blood.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,058
I come from a long line of dancing Dunphys-
a kick line, actually.

9
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,928
Come on. We don't want to be late...

10
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:29,065
like the guy we're gonna see
on the table- Am I right?

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,576
- Of corpse you are.
- Mom, can you take me driving?

12
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,669
My test is coming up,
and I really need to practice.

13
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,236
Oh, honey, I would...

14
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,772
but I've got a big Closets and Blinds Union
meeting today.

15
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,046
There is no Closets and Blinds Union.

16
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,883
Driving with Alex is torture.

17
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:45,617
She drives so slowly,
I have to be the only parent...

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,625
who slams on the imaginary gas.

19
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,127
Hey, I'm not doing anything.
I guess I could take her.

20
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,323
Great! I'll go check the tire pressure
and the fluid levels.

21
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,332
Fun! Can't wait. Be out in a sec.

22
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,334
Okay, my rate just went up.

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,631
All right, but this buys your time
and your silence.

24
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,468
Alex can never know
how much I hate driving with her.

25
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,703
Mmm, she's in a hurry today.

26
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,041
Oh, that's just step one
of her nine-point safety test.

27
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:10,082
Step two is checking the horn to make sure
checking the horn didn't break the horn.

28
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:12,874
She should never drive.

29
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,484
♪ Hey, hey♪

30
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,580
♪ Hey, hey♪

31
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,682
♪ Hey, hey♪

32
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,658
♪ Hey, hey♪

33
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:22,887
♪ Hey,♪♪

34
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,429
Forget it. You tricked me.

35
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:30,765
I'm sorry, buddy, but no son of mine's
going to high school...

36
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:33,135
without at least knowing
how to do a proper box step.

37
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,333
Trust me. Dancers always get the girls.

38
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,672
Remember the great Kevin Bacon
from Footloose?

39
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,075
- More like Foot Loser.
- Careful!

40
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,570
All right. No more talking.

41
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,946
- We're doing this.
- Ugh!

42
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,578
You'll thank me someday. it gets better
when you find your signature move.

43
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,316
They used to call me King of the Dips!

44
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,259
Why can't we just repurpose some of
the stuff from Manny's party last night?

45
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,265
We got half a cake left.
The balloons are fine.

46
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:03,825
It's bad enough that both my sons
have to share the same birthday.

47
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,461
At least they deserve their own party.

48
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,028
You think Joe's
gonna mind day-old cake?

49
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,404
He can't even eat it.
He's got three teeth.

50
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,704
I'll remember that in 20 years
when you want cake.

51
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,676
He doesn't even know
the party's for him.

52
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,112
He understands more than you think.
Right, Andy?

53
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,706
Who, F-Joe here?

54
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,751
He is smart as a whip.

55
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,720
When we play peek-a-boo,
half the time he's ahead of me.

56
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,313
Not exactly Clash of the Titans.

57
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,188
Manny, whose coat is that?

58
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,694
Amy Martin left it here
last night after my party.

59
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,026
I was getting
some pretty strong signals from her.

60
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:35,431
I think she did it on purpose
so she'd have an excuse to come back.

61
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,628
Or because she couldn't get out
fast enough.

62
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,728
If she was a cartoon,
she'd have left her skin here.

63
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,295
What does that mean?

64
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,603
That Amy is out of his league.

65
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,473
He always does this
and ends up getting hurt.

66
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,035
You need to talk to him.

67
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,809
- And say what?
- Tell him to go for girls he stands a chance with.

68
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,713
I overheard him talking to Reuben.

69
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,719
There's some girl that really likes him,
but of course Manny's not interested in her.

70
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,311
He's got to go for the head cheerleader.

71
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,449
- How do you know that Amy's the head-
- I overheard that too.

72
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,960
For someone whose favorite words
at the movies are "What did he say?"...

73
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,156
you overhear pretty good.

74
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:12,402
Yes, Lily, I-I pinky-promise
that we'll be home in time for baby Joe's party.

75
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,803
Mm-hmm. I am.
I'm touching it to the phone.

76
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:18,241
Yeah, and butterfly kisses. Okay. Okay.

77
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,007
Little girls- so excitable.

78
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,572
I was wishing they had a gazebo,
and then they did!

79
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:28,017
Ever since I was a little boy,
I have dreamed-

80
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,988
dreamed of getting married
in a place exactly like this.

81
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,353
So, what date were you looking at?

82
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,552
March 28. That's the anniversary
of our first date.

83
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,960
Oh, wait- Um, I'm sorry.
Is this price per person?

84
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,020
Yes, excluding alcohol, cake and music.

85
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,532
What's that? The Mennonite package?

86
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,500
I think you'll find
our prices are competitive.

87
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,968
- Mmm.
- Well, I'm ready to commit.

88
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,631
Cam, Cam.

89
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,938
I'm sorry.
Can-Can we have a moment, please?

90
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:54,275
Okay. Well, let's hope he's not having
any last-minute jitters.

91
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:56,508
You're not having
last-minute jitters, are you?

92
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,811
No. No, but it's
a really large deposit...

93
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,943
and I want to make sure
we're absolutely certain about this place.

94
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,249
Well, I'm certain, and we've looked
at every possible venue.

95
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,551
And Pepper was, by far,
the least snarky about this one.

96
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:08,651
That's true. He doesn't throw
the word "adequate" around lightly.

97
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,696
- Okay, okay. it's this place.
- Okay.

98
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,698
Stop being so excited. We might be able
to get the price down a little bit.

99
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,427
Okay. Okay. Poker face, poker face.

100
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,196
- Now work on your poker voice.
- Poker voice.

101
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,972
So, we do like it.
We're just not sure that we love it.

102
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,531
Yeah, we're not sure we love it.

103
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,168
That's a relief. Because someone
just called. The room is booked.

104
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,610
- What?
- What? No, no, no!

105
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,648
Wait. Are you playing hardball?
Because we're playing hardball!

106
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:32,274
- We love it!
- Sorry.

107
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,683
A young lady planning a sweet 16
just booked your date.

108
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:38,884
After that, we don't have
another opening for... two months.

109
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,654
No. No, it has to be on our anniversary.

110
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,626
Wait, did Tracy McCoy book this room?

111
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:47,393
Tracy McCoy's a student of mine.
Okay. I may have a plan.

112
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,129
I am not having a wedding/
Hunger Games themed sweet 16 par-

113
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,603
Oh, you're tapping your fingers.
You really do have a plan.

114
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,333
Well, somebody smells good.

115
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,708
- What perfume is that?
- Every perfume!

116
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:03,442
Twenty of the sweatiest, geekiest girls
God ever fouled this planet with...

117
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,711
and just me dancing with all of them.

118
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:08,617
During the Charleston,
my hair got caught in one of their headgear.

119
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:11,520
- Wow, Charleston on the first day?
- Last day!

120
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:15,287
Just because you're a dancer doesn't mean
I have to be one too, cha-cha-cha.

121
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,453
Damn it!

122
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,157
I'm never gonna fall
for one of your lies again.

123
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:22,291
Just take me to autopsy camp.

124
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:25,166
Oh, shoot. Am I gonna get a ticket?

125
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:28,468
If there's any justice,
it'll be a big one, two, three and four.

126
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,564
Damn it!

127
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,008
- License and registration, please.
- Absolutely. There you are.

128
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,570
You know one of your taillights is out?

129
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:38,242
No, I did not. What a ding-dong.

130
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:41,149
- Wait right here.
- Will do. We'll be right here.

131
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,313
This is what you get for lying to me.

132
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,379
What choice did I have?
You used to be up for anything.

133
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,392
Now, no matter what I suggest,
it's no, no, no.

134
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,792
It's called growing up
and having your own interests...

135
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,228
like the minister's daughter
in your precious Footloose.

136
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:55,995
Wow. Using my own movie against me.

137
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,662
- Let's hear it for the boy.
- Please step out of the car.

138
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,002
- Oh, I believe you about the taillight.
- Out of the car!

139
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,338
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, but I have to place you under arrest.

140
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,139
Wait, what?

141
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,340
A car registered to you has accumulated
18 unpaid parking violations...

142
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,041
all on Campus Drive.

143
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,584
Oh, my God.
Those are my daughter's tickets.

144
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,243
He's got an answer for everything.

145
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:17,152
I got to take you down to the station house.
You can ride up front with me.

146
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,055
- Seriously, can't I just pay you for them now?
- At the station house, sir.

147
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:23,254
Can we at least not drive by
Middle Earth Comics and Trampoline World?

148
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:26,321
People look up to me in this town!

149
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,165
No, honey, Luke's fine.

150
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,732
And they won't take a credit card?

151
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,108
No, it's 1 ,600, cash only.

152
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:43,114
But, honey, it's Sunday. I can only get
a few hundred bucks from the A.T.M.

153
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,141
- Sir, your time's up.
- Honey, just use the emergency cash.

154
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,777
- Ticktock.
- B-but, Phil-

155
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:52,380
- Got to go!
- No, honey- I forgot the hiding place! Phil?

156
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,188
Phil has $1 ,000 hidden in the house...

157
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,560
and he's made up a crazy mnemonic device
to remember the location...

158
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,896
which he changes every month
to stay ahead of the bad guys.

159
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,059
What bad guys?

160
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,800
"Loot" rhymes with "coot,"
which takes us to...

161
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,672
this picture of your grandfather.

162
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:15,373
- "Moola" sounds like "coola."
- Not a word.

163
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:18,645
Money is in the air-conditioning vent.

164
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,512
This will all be over soon, buddy.
Just give me one last smile.

165
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:25,921
You too.

166
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,084
Mom's already on her way with the money.
Don't worry.

167
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,094
Oh, my God!
I don't want to go in there.

168
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,096
- You're going in here.
- I don't want to go in here!

169
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,928
Okay. This is where Sophie works.

170
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,490
- She's the one in the hat.
- Copy that.

171
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,594
Tracy works upstairs.
We'll meet in the food court in 30 minutes.

172
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,161
- Sound like a plan?
- A plan.

173
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,537
- Not sure if it's a finger-drumming plan.
- Get in there.

174
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,770
Two of my students,
Tracy and Sophie, B.F.F.'s...

175
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,643
were planning on having
a joint sweet 16 together-

176
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,615
until they got in a fight
over a boy, Rodney.

177
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:55,882
Now Tracy is planning on having
her own party at the Carriage House.

178
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,981
Our venue, our date. So, our solution-

179
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,889
Talk to them, patch things up...

180
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:04,020
so that they have their party
together again at the original location.

181
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,792
Friends fighting over a boy-
something we know a thing or two about.

182
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,959
Of course, usually it's gay men,
not teenage girls...

183
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,231
so we will have to adjust
our approach just a- Not at all.

184
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,795
I don't know.

185
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,103
- Mm-mmm.
- Uh, may I help you?

186
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,269
Mmm, yeah, uh, Sophie.

187
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,404
Um, I'm looking
for something for my niece.

188
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,278
She's been really bummed out lately.
Fight with her best friend.

189
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,148
- So I'm just- I'm trying to cheer her up.
- That's so nice.

190
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,586
Yeah. She's always saying to me,
"Uncle Mitch, you're so cool. You're so rad.

191
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,681
I'm so glad I talk to you
about my problems."

192
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,748
You know, I just-
I really get kids that age.

193
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,761
You know, she's- She's almost 16.

194
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:39,058
I'm almost 16.

195
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,621
Crazy.

196
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,934
Tracy? Tracy McCoy?

197
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,494
Mr. Tucker, hi.

198
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,631
I didn't know
you were old enough to have a job.

199
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,732
I didn't have a job until I was 16.

200
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,073
- Well, I'm almost 16, so-
- Crazy!

201
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,374
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh, I remember back then.

202
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,108
My friends and I had so much fun.

203
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,346
Well, when we weren't arguing
about silly things like parties and-

204
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:10,420
Okay, that's a lot of mirror-looking,
and that's me saying that.

205
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,657
Good, good.

206
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,665
Nice cruising speed.

207
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,826
Oh, look, there's that jogger.
Now we're in the lead.

208
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,166
Can we put the brakes on the sarcasm?

209
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,172
They're worn out.

210
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,936
- Hey, Mom.
- Haley, listen to me.

211
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:28,036
You did not pay a bunch of parking tickets,
and now your father is in jail.

212
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,048
And I have to go bail him out,
just as soon as I can get my hands...

213
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,015
on a giant pile of cash.

214
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,346
Cash- Ash! Oh!

215
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,117
Oh, God.

216
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,124
Oh! That was furry.

217
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,126
You are in so much trouble.

218
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,685
Oh, don't you think I know that?
What am I gonna do?

219
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,253
You're going to get what you deserve.

220
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,563
A parking violation
is second only to a moving violation...

221
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,569
which is grounds for the loss
of a driving privilege.

222
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,366
Privilege, not a right.

223
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,670
Oh, my God, shut up. This is why Mom
pays me to drive with you.

224
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,539
- What?
- Where do you think she's calling me from?

225
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,237
The Closet and Blinds Union?

226
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,476
Why would closet workers and blind people
even have a union together? Think!

227
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,782
Excuse me, waiter.

228
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,650
Could you please tell me
about the surf and turf?

229
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,216
Mr. Lobster says, "it's terrible!"
While Mr. Cow goes-

230
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,592
"Yeah, I think you should
probably just have the pasta."

231
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:18,652
Dada.

232
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,926
No, no, no, little man.

233
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,832
That's your dada right there
with the drinky.

234
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,428
- Over-explaining.
- Don't feel bad. He's just making sounds.

235
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,235
He may not even know
what the "D" word means.

236
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:33,540
I'm fine. He's one. I've watched him
pee into his own face and smile.

237
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,144
Hola, mi amor. I wanted to talk to you.

238
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,708
Uh, what are you doing?

239
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:43,254
I decided to top
Amy's little "forgotten coat" trick...

240
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,187
with a romantic gesture of my own.

241
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,419
- You see-
- Yes, about Amy-

242
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:53,056
I know that I don't know her, but she seems
like some of those girls that you have liked...

243
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,724
but they haven't always-

244
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,324
You may not know her, but I do.

245
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,960
I went on her Facebook page...

246
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,699
and I put one of her favorite things
in each of the pockets of her coat.

247
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:05,073
- So when she reaches inside-
- She'll find a small box of Dutch chocolates.

248
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,908
- Sweet, but-
- Raspberry Rhapsody lip gloss, anyone?

249
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,380
My favorite, but I still wonder-

250
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,644
Hello, Heavenly Soak bath salts.

251
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:16,586
- What next will she find?
- Only a lily of the valley scented candle.

252
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,281
I love it!

253
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,155
Ay. I wish she had more pockets!

254
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:27,460
"Bucks" rhymes with "nyuks"-
Three Stooges.

255
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,556
Damn it.

256
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:34,334
"Wampum," "pom-pom"-
Cheerleading costume.

257
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,965
Come on. Oh, my God, really?

258
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,708
"Bank," "sank"-
novelization of the movie Titanic

259
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,476
Then why do we keep that thing?

260
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,781
Oh, Phil, of course!

261
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,946
Of course, because "dough" rhymes with-

262
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,751
I don't care. I don't care.

263
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,121
Hi, buddy.

264
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,824
Hmm? Ah.

265
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,833
Who am I?

266
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,334
Who am I?

267
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,699
Come on.

268
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,263
He's your dad.

269
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,310
That's right. He's your dad.

270
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,845
Hi, Dad.
Hi, Dad.

271
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,279
You can do it. Come on. Say "Dad."

272
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,283
Come on.

273
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,475
Come on!

274
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,179
Andy!

275
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,484
Hey. How'd it go with Sophie?

276
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,991
I did my best, but I don't think
she's ready to forgive.

277
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,686
- Oh, damn it.
- I know.

278
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,697
- We're screwed.
- Yeah, thanks a lot, Sophie.

279
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,359
Well, Tracy really was out of line.

280
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,129
- Was she?
- Yeah.

281
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,865
- Or was Sophie, per usual, being a big drama queen?
- Drama queen?

282
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,999
No, Tracy was spreading rumors
that Sophie's boyfriend was still into Maya.

283
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,670
They weren't rumors.
She heard it directly from someone...

284
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,646
who saw Maya and Rodney
holding hands at the pier.

285
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,411
Cam, who? Dana!

286
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,543
Yeah, like she could be trusted.

287
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,178
This is Aidan all over again.

288
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,849
Mitchell, it's from Tracy.

289
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:03,361
"Mr. Tucker, thank you.
Talked to Sophie. Party's back on."

290
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,827
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, my gosh.

291
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,728
- You're an evil genius!
- You are!

292
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,996
You know what? I give Tracy a lot of credit
for admitting she was wrong. I do.

293
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,593
Yeah, even though it was Sophie's fault.

294
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,297
- No!
- Hmm?

295
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,932
- What?
- They're still using our venue.

296
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,635
No! Are you kidding me?

297
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,235
This is so frustrating.

298
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,974
Really? Are you sure
that's how you feel...

299
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,038
or do you need a little more time
to think about it?

300
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,607
Sounds like you're trying
to make a point there.

301
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,880
Wow, I'm surprised
you picked up on that so quick.

302
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,946
Yeah, you're definitely dancing around something.
I feel like it's speed-related.

303
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,514
Yeah, we lost the Carriage House...

304
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,186
because you, true to form,
couldn't make a timely decision.

305
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,195
We were out of the room for two sec-

306
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,594
What is this "true to form" business?

307
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,099
- 28 Richdale Road.
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

308
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,157
You hemmed and hawed
over our dream house...

309
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,261
and now somebody else
is eating breakfast in our nook.

310
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,636
I needed the weekend.
I never saw myself in a ranch.

311
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,107
And what about Las Vegas,
when you couldn't quite commit to the show?

312
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,043
- No, no, don't.
- No, no. No, it's fine.

313
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,570
We'll see 'em next time,
just as soon as that tiger un-eats Roy.

314
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:09,121
- I love the sign.
- I'm not sure.

315
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,254
First, I thought just a little accent
of color was all it needed...

316
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,560
but now I'm thinking balloons.

317
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,795
Jay, what do you like better?
The accent or the balloons?

318
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,930
- I've been asking myself that since I met you.
- ¡Ay.!

319
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:24,840
Can I just say I want this type of
playful banter in my relationship.

320
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,741
Long as you say it someplace else.

321
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,541
Good one.

322
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,479
What are you doing?
They're gonna be here any moment.

323
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,517
I've been combing through
Manny's yearbook.

324
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,415
I found a few girls
he might have a shot with.

325
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,613
Happen to know what Lisa Nagel's like
from the neck down?

326
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:40,180
- I didn't tell him what you told me to say.
- What? Why?

327
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:45,287
Because he told me what he's going to do
when Amy comes here, and it's beautiful.

328
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,662
I think he has a better chance
than you think.

329
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,098
He knows how to talk to girls.

330
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,260
He knows how to talk to a girl- you.

331
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,395
I hope you have
a recent picture of his heart.

332
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,805
You're gonna need it, putting the pieces back together.

333
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,501
I'll get it!

334
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,340
- Hey, Mandrake.
- Oh.

335
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,109
Ay. Phil. I heard about jail.
How are you doing?

336
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,979
It was rough.

337
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,213
Stayed in that cold cell a lot longer
than I needed to, thanks to my lovely-

338
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:13,315
- Your system is ridiculous, Phil.
- Quite simple, actually!

339
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,986
"Cheddah" rhymes with "heada."
Where do you rest your heada? On your pilla!

340
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,119
- Mmm!
- Help me out, buddy.

341
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,925
- I have no buddy.
- But- Luke?

342
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,932
I'll get it!

343
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,230
- Oh.
- Would you please just let it go?

344
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,571
I did let it go immediately. You're the one
who hesitated, like you do with everything.

345
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,406
- Ah.
- The whole way here.

346
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,309
Dad, before you get mad, I'm-

347
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:40,283
Oh, we passed "before I get mad" hours ago
when I was sitting in solitary for your crime.

348
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,786
It was only solitary
because no one else was in there.

349
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,879
You paid Haley to take me driving?

350
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,050
- Uh-
- That's right. Haley told me everything.

351
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,753
You made up a fake union
just so you wouldn't have to be with me?

352
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,592
Alex, I am so sorry.
Haley, I trusted you.

353
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:56,065
Good luck trusting anyone
in this family, especially Dad.

354
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,968
Usually when I drag you kicking and screaming
to something, you thank me afterwards.

355
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,528
This time, I was wrong.

356
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:04,268
- What did he do?
- He lied me into a dance class.

357
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,038
Luke, I am so sorry.

358
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:09,376
- Haley, you are in so much trouble!
- So much trouble.

359
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,074
Stop trying to make this her fault.

360
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,946
What kind of parents lie to their kids?

361
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,885
- What kind of lesson is that to teach all of us?
- Yeah, seriously, sometimes-

362
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,445
Hey, neither one of you
knows the whole story.

363
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,117
Ah, please. Let me tell them the truth.

364
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:25,220
Alex, the real reason
Mom doesn't want to teach you to drive...

365
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,231
is because she doesn't want you
getting your license.

366
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,426
- What?
- Think about it.

367
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,197
Mom driving you around
is kind of her favorite time with you.

368
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,636
It's the only place where your nose
isn't buried in a book...

369
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,799
and she can actually talk to you.

370
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,536
Sure, you're getting your license...

371
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,703
but she's losing her little girl.

372
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:44,715
- Mom, is that true?
- Come here.

373
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,445
And the only reason Dad lied to you is-

374
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,283
Should I tell him, Dad?

375
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,922
Fine.

376
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,220
- Dad was a huge nerd in college.
- Yeah.

377
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:58,421
He asked Mom out like, 10 times,
and she always said no.

378
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:02,262
Finally, he said, "I'll never bug you again
if you do one thing."

379
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,824
- Just one.
- "Dance with me."

380
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,927
- Just dance.
- He spun her around on the floor...

381
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:10,304
and expressed himself with his body
in a way he never could with words.

382
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,865
It was beautiful.

383
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,810
Mom finally saw the Dad
that we all know and love.

384
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,472
And you wanted to give that to me?

385
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,244
Come here. Oh!

386
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,081
Everybody, come for cake!

387
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,750
- We can discuss my punishment later.
- Yeah.

388
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,850
Did she learn that from us?

389
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:32,294
That can't be taught. it is a gift.

390
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,923
Yeah, she's still doing it,
following me around all moony-eyed.

391
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,524
She just won't get the message.

392
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,536
- But on the bright side, Amy's on her way over.
- We need to talk.

393
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,663
Got to go, Reuben.

394
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,639
- What's up?
- It's about your love life.

395
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,540
- Lot of people here, Jay.
- Consider it an intervention.

396
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,705
Now this whole Amy thing
is going nowhere...

397
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,375
but it sounds like you have
a girl that really likes you.

398
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,180
Now I know it's not everything you want.

399
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,278
Maybe she's a little thick in the middle.
I don't know.

400
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,822
But why don't you give her a try?

401
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,653
So you think
that's the girl I should go for?

402
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:05,321
She's obviously crazy about you.
What else do you even know about her?

403
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,490
Hi, Manny.

404
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,556
Well, she's six and related to me.

405
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,124
Shall I go on?

406
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,296
Okay, that explains all the outfits
she rejected this morning.

407
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,033
The point remains.
You could lower your sights a little.

408
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,770
- Good, we're still talking about this.
- Ay. leave him alone.

409
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:23,042
- When Amy comes, she's going to love her coat surprise.
- Who's Amy?

410
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,674
This girl Jay doesn't think is into me,
but she left her coat here.

411
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,878
- Why else would a person do that?
- By that logic, I love Denny's.

412
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:33,118
Even if she's not into me right away,
isn't it possible she could fall for me over time?

413
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,715
No, there's a thing called chemistry.

414
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,853
- People know right away.
- Not necessarily.

415
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,397
I didn't know immediately
that I liked you.

416
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,761
Well, maybe not the first minute.

417
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,301
- One month.
- A month? Yikes.

418
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,861
I'm with Manny. Some people can trust
their instincts and leap in with both feet.

419
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,873
Others need to take their time.

420
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,240
Okay, what Cam is so subtly implying
is that he knew instantly with me...

421
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,142
while I, as usual, took my sweet time.

422
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,614
Well, guess what.
I knew instantly with you. How about that?

423
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:02,483
- Actually, I didn't.
- Okay, well, yes, if you count that one disastrous brunch-

424
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,543
- Two months.
- Two months?

425
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,055
- Mm-hmm.
- Yikes!

426
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,955
Well, I'm in the Jay camp.
When you meet the right person, bang!

427
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:12,087
- That's what happened with- How long?
- Uh, six months?

428
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,756
Six months. Yikes.

429
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,792
- But you were preg-tically engaged to me by then.
- Mmm, nice save, Dad.

430
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,862
Wait a minute. I thought you fell
in love with him after he danced with you.

431
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,908
And that was six months in.

432
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,569
- Why did it take you so long to dance with me, Phil?
- I don't know, Claire.

433
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,806
You'd think I would've gotten to it
by then since we lived together.

434
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:32,145
I'm sorry. I've been berating you
about dragging your feet...

435
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,811
and when it comes to us,
I'm even more hesitatey than-

436
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,150
No, no, this is great, because that
makes our real anniversary...

437
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,883
two months later,
when we were both sure.

438
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:41,186
We can still book
the Carriage House for our wedding.

439
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,817
- Oh, my gosh, are you calling them?
- Yes.

440
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,384
- Yes!
- Although, I-I am-

441
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,724
- Call them.
- Okay.

442
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,765
So, you were living
with this guy the whole time-

443
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,322
Oh. Uh-

444
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,461
- Jay!
- Aw, how cute. He wants cake.

445
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,869
No, no, listen, listen, listen!
What's he saying?

446
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:55,929
Jay.

447
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,975
Jay! He's saying "Jay"!

448
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,170
- Oh.
- He knows me!

449
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,372
And that "Jay" word,
that's harder to say than "Dada."

450
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,574
He's a genius. Come here.

451
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,148
She's here!

452
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,622
- This is it, Manny!
- Go get her, buddy!

453
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,353
Hey, hey, hey. Listen, kid.
You might've been right...

454
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,328
about some people needing
a little more time before they come around.

455
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,160
I mean, look at peanut here.
Good luck, Manny.

456
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,167
Thanks, Jay.

457
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:26,603
So it took you six months, huh, Phil?

458
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,162
I can do six months.

459
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,334
I'll be here!

460
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,104
- I'm not loving this.
- Mm-mmm.

461
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,650
His door is still closed.
What is he doing in there?

462
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,385
I think we both know
what he's doing in there.

463
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,326
- He's been at it for hours.
- That's how I was at his age.

464
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,624
He's gonna wear himself out.
You should talk to him.

465
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,494
I don't want to embarrass him.

466
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:56,966
- So knock first.
- Maybe you're right.

467
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,900
I don't want him doing it wrong
and getting hurt.

468
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,835
Luke?

469
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,839
I'm coming in!

470
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,773
Hey, man. Buddy!

471
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,505
Dad? Get out of here!

472
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,638
Don't be embarrassed, son.
It's perfectly natural!

473
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,204
Get out!
