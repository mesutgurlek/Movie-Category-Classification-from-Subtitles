1
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:16,486
If yet your blood does not rage, then
it is waterthat flows in your veins.

2
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:21,922
For what is the flush of youth,
if it is not of service to the motherland.

3
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:04,630
Just a minute Mr. McKinley,
one revolutionary is meeting another.

4
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:12,705
Thank you.
Shall we go?

5
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,379
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

6
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:22,783
This isn't the end Mr. McKinley.
This is just the beginning.

7
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:27,121
There will be others after
we have gone. Many others.

8
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:16,535
Shove it.

9
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:54,243
Get out of the way! Scoot!

10
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:57,417
You come India first time madam?
<i>Yes!</i>

11
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:13,596
Sorry about the short notice.

12
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:17,760
Gosh! Your Hindi has
really improved.

13
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,436
Don't worry,
all the preparations are done.

14
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:37,685
Hey Sue, no need to worry...

15
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:42,219
...everything has been taken care of
posters have been put up everywhere.

16
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:43,963
It's also been announced on radio.

17
00:09:44,498 --> 00:09:46,557
...just see, they'll be lining
up forthe auditions.

18
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:50,697
What's wrong?

19
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:59,374
I didn't tell you.
The truth is that I've come alone.

20
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,980
...no money, no producer is going to arrive.

21
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:06,482
You knew it!

22
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:13,057
After Alice, there was a
call from a certain Beth Williams...

23
00:10:13,527 --> 00:10:16,985
...she informed me of the cancellation
of the show and also my services.

24
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:25,169
...did you abuse her in Hindi?

25
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:31,940
She wanted to know what it meant.
I explained to her in graphic detail.

26
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:39,277
You are amazing... Sonia.

27
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:06,702
This is Delhi University.
Let me help you with your luggage.

28
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:10,111
How much?
- Ma'am I'v<i>e</i> alr<i>e</i>ady told you.

29
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:17,117
Ravi, please get all the
luggage to our room.

30
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:44,580
Get some rest now.
I'll see you tomorrow...

31
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,348
...lf you need anything
you have my number.

32
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,257
Let's go Ravi.

33
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:56,786
I can't do this.

34
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:02,522
I can't do this.

35
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:11,866
I deserve a role because
I have dimples just like Priety Zinta.

36
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,179
Don't sing. Just recite "Vande Matram".
- Vand<i>e</i> Matram?

37
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:16,362
Raise your hand and say VANDE MATRAM!
VANDE Matram<i>!</i>

38
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,198
Speak loudly, VANDE MATRAM!
Vand<i>e</i> MATRAM.

39
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:22,864
Loudly and proudly, VANDE MATRAM!
Vand<i>e</i> MATRAM

40
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:25,374
VANDE MATRAM!
Vand<i>e</i> Matram...

41
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,708
I have dedicated my life
to the freedom of this nation.

42
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,051
I have dedicated my life
to the freedom of this nation.

43
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:34,554
I know you want me to get married.

44
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:38,216
...but FREEDOM is my bride.

45
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,058
I know... I know... that...

46
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,896
I know... that you want me to get married...

47
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,567
...but my bride is FREEDOM

48
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:57,899
...but my bride is FREEDOM.
Your obedient son, BHAGAT SINGH.

49
00:14:58,712 --> 00:14:59,406
BHAGAT SINGH.

50
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:00,571
Bhagat Singh.

51
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:02,411
Bhagat Singh.

52
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:07,419
My name is Bhagat Singh.

53
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:18,030
Tea!
Thank<i>s</i>.

54
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:23,762
Depressed huh?

55
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:27,866
One ortwo of them can
be used for minor roles...

56
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:32,275
...but no one's even close for
Azad or Bhagat Singh.

57
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:35,706
I guess it's all my fault.

58
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:39,713
No Sonia. You're my rock.

59
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,219
Sue, don't get so dejected.

60
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:50,126
Let's go and have some fun.
I'm in no mood Sonia.

61
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:18,988
Hey Aslam.

62
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:33,739
Aslam... Sue McKinley.

63
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:36,071
You too study at the University?

64
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:38,073
Wow! Her Hindi is great.

65
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:43,743
We live there, eat there but no one
has ever accused us of studying there.

66
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:13,275
What are those maniacs upto?

67
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:15,281
That's DJ...

68
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:16,947
DJ I love you!!!

69
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:19,552
That's Sukhi.

70
00:17:29,162 --> 00:17:30,561
DJ I love you!!!

71
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:33,395
I love you too baby!

72
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:48,808
Damn exhibitionists.

73
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:52,314
The idiots will never change.

74
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:57,152
Come on dude, let's rock it!

75
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:03,655
Sukhi I love you!

76
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:30,220
Is he OK?

77
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,357
That's his natural state.

78
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:39,590
Sukhi, all parts working?

79
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,731
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

80
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:49,234
Sue this is DJ.
DJ this is Sue.

81
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:50,034
Hi!

82
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:54,877
Sue? She's so pink her name
should be Gulabo (Rose).

83
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,217
She's quite hot...

84
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:00,886
Perfect forthis cold.

85
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:10,723
Karan you saved my life.
I love you!

86
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:12,727
Aslam...

87
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,230
...you too saved my life,

88
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:17,334
I love you too!

89
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:19,739
It's ok.

90
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:25,240
She must have saved my life too...

91
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:27,572
No! Sukhi!
She didn't save your life.

92
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:30,409
No problem. One day
she'll save my life.

93
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:36,689
Relax Dude!
She is your sister-in-law.

94
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:48,561
LOOSE CONTROL

95
00:19:56,876 --> 00:20:10,779
I'm a REBEL.

96
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:16,959
Th<i>e</i>r<i>e</i>'<i>s</i> ar<i>e</i>n't any <i>s</i>tud<i>e</i>nt<i>s</i> h<i>e</i>r<i>e</i>,
no t<i>e</i>ach<i>e</i>rs to <i>s</i>uff<i>e</i>r.

97

H<i>e</i>y G<i>e</i>niu<i>s</i>, go figur<i>e</i>.

98
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,983
Sukhi you just sit and
watch like a dumb-ass...

99
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:46,890
DJ doesn't waste a second.

100
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:48,424
He's a stud.

101
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:51,096
Hi! How's everybody?
Hi Rahul! What's up?

102
00:20:52,198 --> 00:20:53,495
Got a few gigs lined up.

103
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,327
How's your radio thing going?

104
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:58,332
Did anything work out?

105
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:00,670
All India Radio has
given me a night slot.

106
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:02,568
Cool...

107
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:07,904
Not really. When the whole world's
sleeping I'm on air.

108
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:09,911
But people stay up late...

109
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:14,414
Criminals, insomniacs,
watchmen and idiots!

110
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:17,587
Have yourfun at my expense.

111
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:19,183
Speaking of expenses...
Can I...

112
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:32,031
See you guys.
Got a cigarette?

113
00:21:38,244 --> 00:21:40,041
Fabulous!

114
00:21:40,747 --> 00:21:43,045
It's my Dad's money.
He's got lots of it...

115
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:53,392
Stop this Western music,
this obscenity!

116
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,887
How many times do
I have to make you understand this!

117
00:21:57,764 --> 00:22:00,062
Polluting the culture of this country...

118
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:03,561
Leave this place right now.
LEAVE!

119
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,069
Can't you understand, idiot!

120
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:10,902
This is your last warning...

121
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:16,672
...from now on, nobody plays
any Western music out here.

122
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:18,910
No lewd dancing!

123
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:25,182
Or I'll break your legs.

124
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,427
Who are you to warn us?
If you don't like it, don't come here.

125
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:30,596
You bloody Pakistani!

126
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:38,934
Let's finish it.

127
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,358
Last warning! Got it?

128
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:06,689
Long live India!

129
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,873
You touch Aslam and
see what I do to you...

130
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:19,135
...even your mother won't recognize you.

131
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,943
Ever seen a baboons arse? Yours will
be as red after I've finished with you.

132
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:29,814
Sir, I'm sure we can work it out.

133
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:39,153
Keep this...

134
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:48,667
Anyone hungry? I'm famished.

135
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:49,953
How're you?

136
00:25:51,497 --> 00:25:54,057
Hey honey! Come here you...

137
00:25:57,503 --> 00:26:00,301
If something happened to you,
I'd have killed you.

138
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:02,300
Is this any way to greet your boyfriend?

139
00:26:05,511 --> 00:26:05,977
How're you?

140
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:23,222
Hurry guys, I'm famished.

141
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:24,987
You won't get any food here.

142
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:31,666
Stay away!

143
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:34,339
...I carried you in my stomach
for nine months...

144
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,168
...and washed your bum foryears.

145
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:38,568
Get lost!

146
00:26:39,145 --> 00:26:42,342
Does anyone botherto check
if Mitro is alive or dead?

147
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:43,344
What's up?

148
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:45,350
You're drunk again.

149
00:26:45,718 --> 00:26:48,346
No. No. No.

150
00:26:48,621 --> 00:26:51,351
First give us food ma,
and then yell at us all night.

151
00:26:52,592 --> 00:26:55,186
None of you have eaten?

152
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:58,693
Sonia you've lost even more weight.

153
00:26:58,898 --> 00:26:59,523
Really... Mitro

154
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:03,532
The girls of today have
more bones and less flesh...

155
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:05,363
How will you bear children?

156
00:27:09,242 --> 00:27:12,939
Aslam, how are you my son?

157
00:27:13,145 --> 00:27:15,705
He is my true son
who bothers to check on me.

158
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:19,715
And you...

159
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:24,382
Look ma, what I brought foryou.

160
00:27:24,757 --> 00:27:28,056
Your daughter-in-law.
Her name is Sue.

161
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:30,889
What? Aforeigner?

162
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,332
Brought her especially from London.
That's why I was away for so long.

163
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:40,232
Give me your blessings Ma.

164
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,233
Your son's such a brat.

165
00:27:44,777 --> 00:27:50,738
God! She understands Hindi!

166
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:58,253
You really understand everything?
<i>Yes</i>.

167
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,524
I'm going off to sleep. Your beds are
all ready. No need to drive so late at night.

168
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,307
Sue, where are you?

169
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:52,038
Will you guys act in my film?

170
00:28:52,678 --> 00:28:53,303
What?

171
00:28:57,683 --> 00:29:01,483
Hey, why are you guys laughing?
I'm the hero of herfilm.

172
00:29:02,688 --> 00:29:04,485
Yeah we guys are champions
when it comes to acting...

173
00:29:04,857 --> 00:29:06,654
...clowning around is all they do.

174
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:12,593
The four of you will be
perfect forthe roles...

175
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:17,498
And Sonia will be my Durga Bhabhi.

176
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,394
She really knows Hindi!

177
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:23,340
All this talk of patriotism is boring.

178
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:27,603
Boring? These guys gave their
lives forthe freedom of your country.

179
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:30,515
What freedom? Have you seen
the state of this country?

180
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:33,685
Excuse me! I believe in this country, Karan.

181
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:38,683
Otherwise, why would
I be fighting for it?

182
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:43,017
Maybe because it's cool!
Being a pilot... flying an expensive plane.

183
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:44,522
You get to wear sexy jackets...

184
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,860
And the women...
women love men in uniforms.

185
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:51,535
Sure I love being a pilot.
Sure it's cool.

186
00:29:51,704 --> 00:29:55,538
But I also feel proud of my country,
and I can give my life for it.

187
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:59,369
Proud of what?

188
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:00,636
...this country's exploding population?

189
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:02,873
...or unemployment...
or corruption?

190
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:04,546
Which of these are you really proud of?

191
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,652
No country's perfect Karan.
We've got to make it better.

192
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:09,320
Right.

193
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:13,782
Ok, Ajay you make
this country perfect.

194
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,891
The minute I get my degree
I'm out of this dump...

195
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:20,565
You won't be able
to leave us and go.

196
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,229
She speaks Hindi so well!

197
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:31,469
Why didn't you tell me you idiot.
I was making a fool of myself.

198
00:30:37,717 --> 00:30:40,811
At least ask them once.

199
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,146
So you won't give up.

200
00:30:43,956 --> 00:30:47,255
Ok. But nobody will turn up.

201
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:54,430
I'll get them. That's a promise.

202
00:30:58,971 --> 00:31:00,939
Karan put your cigarette out.

203
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:05,100
Grandpa!

204
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:08,780
God bless you.
When did you come?

205
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:13,042
Just last night.

206
00:31:56,228 --> 00:32:00,130
Good morning Karan.
Back so early?

207
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:03,861
I didn't know you were in town.

208
00:32:05,404 --> 00:32:06,928
Just arrived an hour ago.

209
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:11,800
It was a long flight...
Everything Ok at college?

210
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:13,703
Everything's fine Dad.

211
00:32:13,913 --> 00:32:17,371
Have you decided which American
university you want to go to next year?

212
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:24,251
Michigan, Carnegie,
Mellon, Wharton...

213
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:25,390
I know the list.

214
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:31,225
Hello...

215
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:32,561
Karan wait!

216
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:38,893
I can't hearyou clearly
call me later.

217
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:43,164
I know that you know about the lists.

218
00:32:44,543 --> 00:32:46,511
But life doesn't just happen to you.

219
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,803
You've got to plan it...

220
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:52,645
Every second someone
is born in this country.

221
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,248
Nobody cares about them.
Neitherthe government nor God.

222
00:32:58,457 --> 00:33:04,191
Do something.
Or else you will be one of them.

223
00:33:04,463 --> 00:33:06,260
Please, don't start with your lectures.

224
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:11,592
SMS generation.
Any conversation that goes beyond...

225
00:33:11,804 --> 00:33:12,930
...four lines becomes a lecture.

226
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:21,279
Signal's weak here. Give me a second.
Excuse me Karan.

227
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:27,448
The deal is off then,
we are not interested...

228
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:34,454
You know Russian quality is doubtful,
they can't afford to be arrogant.

229
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:41,598
Anyway in the open market they'd not get
anything close to the price we're offering.

230
00:33:41,734 --> 00:33:46,569
And you know how many fathers
there are to every deal in India. Nothing.

231
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:56,979
Tell them we won't bargain,
they should wire the money to us.

232
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:24,975
I did try to warn you...
they won't turn up.

233
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:26,804
DJ promised me.

234
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:28,877
Oh! DJ promised you!

235
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:30,681
So you really are a filmmaker?

236
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:33,909
Karan... Why are you so late?

237
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:36,521
And where are the others?

238
00:34:39,558 --> 00:34:43,688
The Young Guns Of India.
Very dramatic.

239
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:49,561
Where are you going?

240
00:34:49,802 --> 00:34:52,327
Well that's one part cast.

241
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:56,434
I am sure Karan can tell us
where his friends are.

242
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,523
She's an eight. Yeah!

243
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:13,722
Wow! Nine.

244
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:15,325
What a girl!
Oy<i>e</i> Chotu...

245
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:17,256
...get me a cup of tea...

246
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:19,192
Two, looks like she's got the flu...

247
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:23,159
Six...

248
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:27,470
Ten!
What?

249
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:33,007
Dude... Iooks at those legs!

250
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:37,182
Shake it baby, shake it...

251
00:35:37,783 --> 00:35:38,442
Oh shit!

252
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,277
Don't be silly,
that's at least an eight.

253
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:43,216
Thought I'd find you
stuffing yourfaces.

254
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:46,084
You lazy good-for-nothings.

255
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:48,550
We were about to come... but...

256
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:50,728
...we are waiting for Karan actually.

257
00:35:51,163 --> 00:35:52,494
Oh! So you were waiting for Karan.
<i>Ye</i>ah<i>!</i>

258
00:35:53,132 --> 00:35:54,759
Karan was there on time.

259
00:35:56,602 --> 00:35:59,469
We are waiting for him here
and he was waiting for us there.

260
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:01,832
What confusion...

261
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:05,771
You're Ashfaqulla Khan.

262
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:08,503
You're Rajguru.
Th<i>e</i> h<i>e</i>ro right<i>!</i>

263
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:10,113
And you know who you are?

264
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:13,043
The Master of Disguise
and Deception.

265
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:14,412
Chandrashekhar Azad.

266
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:16,785
What lips...

267
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:19,883
Learn the lines properly,
we meet tomorrow.

268
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:23,188
8 a.m. Sharp!

269
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:25,659
Nine.
Sharp at <i>e</i>ight.

270
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:28,662
That's fine.
W<i>e</i>'v<i>e</i> alr<i>e</i>ady wa<i>s</i>t<i>e</i>d a day...

271
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,341
Aslam, your sister-in-law looks
even better when she's angry.

272
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:50,248
What are you doing Laxman?

273
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:54,622
Greetings Mishraji.

274
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:57,791
Party High Command is really
happy with your work.

275
00:36:58,297 --> 00:37:02,700
These demonstrations that you have
started against Western culture...

276
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:06,594
...they've helped us
overshadow other parties.

277
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:19,383
This is foryou.
And this is foryour boys.

278
00:37:20,452 --> 00:37:22,181
It's not necessary, Mishraji.

279
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,579
I'm not doing this for money.

280
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:27,651
I really believe in the
principles of my party.

281
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:30,061
That's fine Laxman...

282
00:37:30,696 --> 00:37:36,601
...but every movement
needs fuel... Keep it.

283
00:37:58,757 --> 00:38:03,285
There is nothing
you can do to break me.

284
00:38:03,662 --> 00:38:06,256
"Because I have made pain my friend."

285
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:10,562
"...As I hold Death's fingers."

286
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:26,007
DJ idiot, don't spoil my concentration.

287
00:38:30,389 --> 00:38:31,981
Look, Death's finger.

288
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:38,121
"I've committed my life
to the freedom of this country.

289
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,130
...I know you want me to get married,
but I have made freedom my bride..."

290
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:44,802
"Your obedient son, Bhagat Singh."

291
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:49,234
Who talks like this for
God's sake?

292
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:51,136
My bride is freedom...

293
00:38:51,443 --> 00:38:53,843
I think it's a good line for Sukhi...

294
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:55,741
Since no girl is ever going to marry him...

295
00:38:55,981 --> 00:38:58,347
Let freedom be his bride.

296
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,984
Laugh bastards, laugh.

297
00:39:25,277 --> 00:39:27,609
This is the sari round
of the Miss Freedom contest.

298
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:31,207
Just thought it would help
me get into the character.

299
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:39,183
Look guys this isn't going to work.

300
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:43,991
You have to work hard to bring
out the characters.

301
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:48,292
Unless you emote from within...

302
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:50,228
...you won't understand these characters.

303
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:55,004
Try... it will come from within you.

304
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:56,674
BURP

305
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:59,900
See, he's got a hold of his character already.

306
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:03,080
You understood the character pretty fast.

307
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,519
See! Now you look like a revolutionary!

308
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:12,147
Whateveryou say Gulabo,
you need me to create the mood.

309
00:40:13,025 --> 00:40:14,822
DJ watch it.

310
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,818
Now she's upset!

311
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:27,528
Those are the words of a 23 year old.

312
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:31,169
That's how old Bhagat Singh
was when he died: 23.

313
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:33,370
Those were different times Sue.

314
00:40:33,812 --> 00:40:39,011
Today, if you tell people that
you want to give your life foryour country...

315
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:40,573
...they'll call you nuts.

316
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:42,615
Exactly.

317
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:47,353
I don't think I can relate to this...

318
00:40:49,294 --> 00:40:50,625
That's it. Don't think.

319
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:55,691
Feel. Just read the words,
Feel them.

320
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:58,829
Why don't we try again?

321
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:00,996
Let's try again...

322
00:41:03,075 --> 00:41:07,205
I've committed my life to
the freedom of this country.

323
00:41:09,448 --> 00:41:14,750
...a job... a well settled life...
these things don't matter anymore.

324
00:41:15,587 --> 00:41:24,655
...I know you want me to get married,
but I have made freedom my bride...

325
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:42,174
I swear on Mother India...

326
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:57,758
This Aslam is a real stud...

327
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:04,833
Take a look at the packaging.
Poetry, palmistry!

328
00:42:05,804 --> 00:42:10,503
DJ, I'm scared at times that
I'll remain a bachelor all my life.

329
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,978
Trust me I won't let you die a bachelor.

330
00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:16,806
Promise?

331
00:42:17,716 --> 00:42:18,705
It's DJ's promise.

332
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:28,118
You'll be writing people's destinies...

333
00:42:40,038 --> 00:42:41,801
Your love line is very strong...

334
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:46,504
The man of your dreams will come
along in a black T-shirt and say:

335
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,183
Do I even have a love line?

336
00:42:55,387 --> 00:42:57,150
You must have washed it off in the loo.

337
00:42:57,355 --> 00:43:02,850
"Defence Minister Shastri has also been
implicated in the MIG-21 kickbacks scandal,"

338
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:06,997
This is really depressing.

339
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,225
"This is a blatant lie.
I am ordering an investigation."

340
00:43:10,836 --> 00:43:20,802
UTv

341
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:49,159
See you guys.

342
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:53,098
You're my buddy...
I'll drop you home.

343
00:44:53,305 --> 00:44:56,206
I don't need any help,
it's just two lanes away.

344
00:44:56,841 --> 00:45:00,277
We aren't so drunk...
that we've forgotten where you live.

345
00:45:13,592 --> 00:45:14,752
Idiots!

346
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:18,257
You're very lucky to
have friends like them.

347
00:45:24,302 --> 00:45:26,770
One day this will all end.

348
00:45:27,973 --> 00:45:29,770
We'll all go our separate ways.

349
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:33,435
But you can always keep in touch.

350
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:35,539
Doesn't happen.

351
00:45:36,748 --> 00:45:38,306
Life gets busy.

352
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:42,281
Too many problems.
Getting a job, a house, money.

353
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,966
In college we are the
masters of our destinies...

354
00:45:56,768 --> 00:45:58,963
But after college we have
to dance to fate's tune.

355
00:46:05,777 --> 00:46:11,409
You know Gulabo.
I passed out 5 years ago...

356
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,074
...but I still hang around...

357
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:16,578
I don't understand.

358
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:20,849
...I don't ever want to leave college.

359
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:22,551
Why?

360
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:29,533
At least in the campus
I'm someone... people know me.

361
00:46:30,702 --> 00:46:32,567
DJ's somebody...

362
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:39,967
People expect me to do
something big in life.

363
00:46:42,414 --> 00:46:45,645
But when I'm out on the streets...

364
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:51,716
I'll just be like the rest of
the slobs in this country.

365
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:04,660
Nameless. Faceless. Scared.
Just walking the streets...

366
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:09,130
It's the beer...
Everything came out.

367
00:47:13,244 --> 00:47:16,805
You know what else
I'm scared of?

368
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:20,108
Acting in yourfilm.

369
00:47:21,786 --> 00:47:24,346
Don't worry... you're in safe hands.

370
00:47:45,076 --> 00:47:46,008
Where have you been?

371
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:48,543
Hello Uncle... How are you?

372
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:58,084
We'll catch up tomorrow Aslam...

373
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,326
You've been drinking?

374
00:48:07,465 --> 00:48:10,662
Dad, you know I don't drink.

375
00:48:11,102 --> 00:48:14,469
Good-for-nothings...
What<i>e</i>v<i>e</i>r, th<i>e</i>y'r<i>e</i> my fri<i>e</i>nd<i>s</i>.

376
00:48:14,672 --> 00:48:18,403
Friends! They feel no
shame standing in front of...

377
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,374
...yourfather with alcohol on their breath.

378
00:48:21,713 --> 00:48:24,409
Why can't you get friends
in your own community?

379
00:48:25,116 --> 00:48:28,552
Why do you make friends with people
who corrupt you, disgrace your religion...

380
00:48:28,753 --> 00:48:30,448
This has nothing to
do with religion, Father.

381
00:48:30,655 --> 00:48:35,456
Shut up! Don't raise your voice
in the presence of yourfather.

382
00:48:36,928 --> 00:48:37,860
He's right.

383
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:45,228
This country has never accepted
Muslims and it never will...

384
00:48:45,804 --> 00:48:47,237
How can you be so passive!

385
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:51,808
Do you ever see me
mixing with a Hindu?

386
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:56,612
I'm not you and I don't want
to be like you brother.

387
00:48:58,349 --> 00:48:59,816
I can't fill myself with so much hate...

388
00:49:00,652 --> 00:49:02,882
Coward that's what you are.

389
00:49:03,087 --> 00:49:04,748
Stop it!

390
00:49:04,956 --> 00:49:07,982
I feel suffocated in this house.
It's the same old thing every single day...

391
00:49:19,971 --> 00:49:22,997
Carnivals will be held on our
graves every year,

392
00:49:23,775 --> 00:49:27,768
That's all that will be left of us,
when we die for our country.

393
00:49:27,979 --> 00:49:30,777
Well said Ashfaq Sahab...

394
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:33,614
If the English could hearyou they
would leave this country in a moment.

395
00:49:35,987 --> 00:49:37,113
So what has been decided?

396
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:44,186
We'll steal the Empire's money
from the train that passes Kakori.

397
00:49:45,163 --> 00:49:47,131
And with that money we will buy arms.

398
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:50,394
Bismil will explain everything.

399
00:49:50,602 --> 00:49:53,366
Yes Bismil... Where is my Ram?

400
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:58,368
Ljust can't find my
Ramprasad Bismil.

401
00:49:58,576 --> 00:50:00,043
Relax. We will find him.

402
00:50:00,245 --> 00:50:01,837
But where? How?

403
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:04,205
Very soon. Don't you wo...

404
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:08,879
You won't get Ramprasad
Bismil out here.

405
00:50:10,121 --> 00:50:12,214
You need a true Indian.

406
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:15,125
How can you find Indian
revolutionaries amongst...

407
00:50:15,894 --> 00:50:18,522
...people who want to be Westerners?

408
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,163
Ignore him. Let's go.

409
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:23,698
Ramprasad Bismil wished to
be reborn a hundred times...

410
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:29,000
...so that he could give his life for his
country a hundred times over.

411
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:30,435
Let's go Sue.

412
00:50:31,676 --> 00:50:35,339
So where do you think
I can find my Bismil?

413
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:42,245
I don't believe this.

414
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:50,384
This day, we walk along with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.

415
00:50:51,596 --> 00:50:57,193
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

416
00:50:58,002 --> 00:51:06,341
Mistake not our silence for submission.
For beneath lies lava, molten.

417
00:51:09,047 --> 00:51:18,513
O Martyr<i>e</i>, O m<i>e</i>n of valour.
On<i>e</i> day th<i>e e</i>n<i>e</i>my will <i>s</i>ing your prai<i>ses</i>.

418
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:23,656
We will show our mettle
when the moment of truth arrives...

419
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:29,163
...for courage lives in deeds,
not boastful lies.

420
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:33,330
We've gathered in the enemy's lair,
my friend...

421
00:51:33,538 --> 00:51:37,406
In the hope of dying for our motherland.

422
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:42,238
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

423
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:48,750
This day, we walk along with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.

424
00:51:49,787 --> 00:51:55,953
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

425
00:52:07,672 --> 00:52:10,539
Sue, this isn't London.
You don't know what kind...

426
00:52:10,742 --> 00:52:11,766
...of scum, men like Laxman Pandey are.

427
00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:15,935
Look Sue if he is a part of this,
then I can't do the film.

428
00:52:16,147 --> 00:52:18,945
If you have any problems
with me say it on my face.

429
00:52:19,417 --> 00:52:23,376
Don't stab me in the back like a coward.

430
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:26,383
Pandey leave!
We don't want trouble...

431
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:29,391
Speak you coward.
What were you saying?

432
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:33,258
Aslam, where are you going?

433
00:52:35,933 --> 00:52:36,865
Coward, what were you saying?

434
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:41,527
Hey you! How dare you hit Aslam?

435
00:52:50,748 --> 00:52:51,976
SUKHI

436
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,882
Thrash him.

437
00:53:15,373 --> 00:53:21,608
I'm sorry,
I took you guys in my film.

438
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:25,547
God knows what made me come here...

439
00:54:42,894 --> 00:54:45,829
You know we've got a problem
with Pandey. There's a lot of bad blood.

440
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:51,263
And if I stay, it's sure to happen again.
No, Su<i>e</i>.

441
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:52,593
We've worked it out.

442
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,394
You won't have any problems.

443
00:55:00,978 --> 00:55:06,473
Sue... we all know how much
this film means to you.

444
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,413
We want to help you finish
what you came here to do.

445
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:15,189
Everyone wants you to stay.

446
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:17,187
I want you to stay.

447
00:55:21,966 --> 00:55:26,596
Say something...

448
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:32,369
Don't worry, you're in safe hands.

449
00:55:35,246 --> 00:55:37,407
Come on... Get up... Come here.

450
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:56,566
She's not going anywhere.

451
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:02,633
Now just chill.

452
00:57:39,337 --> 00:57:49,303
UTv

453
00:58:02,426 --> 00:58:15,931
Tak<i>e s</i>om<i>e s</i>oil of my land,
th<i>e s</i>c<i>e</i>nt of thi<i>s</i> air...

454
00:58:16,073 --> 00:58:20,237
Add th<i>e</i> br<i>e</i>ath of my b<i>e</i>ing,
th<i>e</i> throbbing of my h<i>e</i>art...

455
00:58:20,444 --> 00:58:26,405
And th<i>e</i> z<i>e</i>al, that
rac<i>es</i> through my blood...

456
00:58:26,784 --> 00:58:31,244
Tak<i>e</i> all th<i>ese</i>, and <i>s</i>tir it.
Th<i>e</i>n watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i> colour...

457
00:58:31,455 --> 00:58:35,755
Tak<i>e</i> all th<i>ese</i>, and <i>s</i>tir it.
Th<i>e</i>n watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i> colour...

458
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,420
Watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out
th<i>e</i> colour of patrioti<i>s</i>m, my fri<i>e</i>nd.

459
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:56,279
Watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i> colour.

460
00:59:09,326 --> 00:59:11,123
Bismil's sent a message...

461
00:59:11,328 --> 00:59:12,625
...that the Lucknow train...

462
00:59:13,664 --> 00:59:17,122
...carrying the Empire's money...
will be looted by us in Kakori...

463
00:59:17,501 --> 00:59:19,128
...while eating Kakori kababs.

464
00:59:19,837 --> 00:59:23,136
And we will buy bombs with that money.

465
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,138
Leave her alone...
She will stop giving milk.

466
00:59:26,343 --> 00:59:29,972
Giv<i>e</i> colour to your dr<i>e</i>am<i>s</i>.
And thos<i>e</i> of your p<i>e</i>opl<i>e</i>.

467
00:59:30,848 --> 00:59:34,978
Giv<i>e</i> colour to your happin<i>ess</i>.
And your <i>s</i>adn<i>ess</i> too.

468
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:39,311
Giv<i>e</i> colour to g<i>e</i>n<i>e</i>ration<i>s</i>...
Giv<i>e</i> colour to th<i>e</i> fi<i>e</i>ld...

469
00:59:40,024 --> 00:59:42,322
Giv<i>e</i> colour to th<i>e</i> b<i>e</i>at of your h<i>e</i>art.
And that of your mu<i>s</i>ic.

470
00:59:42,526 --> 00:59:44,653
Giv<i>e</i> colour to <i>e</i>v<i>e</i>ry ch<i>ee</i>k.
Giv<i>e</i> colour to your <i>e</i>y<i>es</i>...

471
00:59:44,862 --> 00:59:46,989
Watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i>
colour of patrioti<i>s</i>m my fri<i>e</i>nd.

472
00:59:47,198 --> 00:59:48,995
Watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i> colour...

473
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:58,601
Tak<i>e s</i>om<i>e s</i>oil of my land,
th<i>e s</i>c<i>e</i>nt of thi<i>s</i> air...

474
00:59:58,843 --> 01:00:03,337
Add th<i>e</i> br<i>e</i>ath of my b<i>e</i>ing,
th<i>e</i> throbbing of my h<i>e</i>art.

475
01:00:03,547 --> 01:00:09,349
And th<i>e</i> z<i>e</i>al, that rac<i>es</i>
through my blood.

476
01:00:09,887 --> 01:00:14,187
Tak<i>e</i> all th<i>ese</i> and <i>s</i>tir it.
Th<i>e</i>n watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i> colour.

477
01:00:14,558 --> 01:00:18,688
Tak<i>e</i> all th<i>ese</i> and <i>s</i>tir it.
Th<i>e</i>n watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i> colour.

478
01:00:18,896 --> 01:00:21,524
Watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i>
colour of patrioti<i>s</i>m, my fri<i>e</i>nd.

479
01:00:21,732 --> 01:00:23,359
Watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i> colour.

480
01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:29,437
Hey Short-stuff!

481
01:00:29,807 --> 01:00:31,206
Did you get Bismil's message?

482
01:00:31,408 --> 01:00:32,705
No.
No<i>!</i> Th<i>e</i>n Li<i>s</i>t<i>e</i>n...

483
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:36,209
The train that's Kakori...
will be looted in eight days.

484
01:00:36,914 --> 01:00:38,541
It's loaded with the Empire's money.

485
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:40,216
Will you loot it?
No.

486
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:42,544
We will be buying arms from it.

487
01:00:43,087 --> 01:00:44,554
What will we buy?
Arm<i>s</i>...

488
01:00:44,755 --> 01:00:46,052
Yes... Very Good... go now.

489
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:50,382
On a <i>s</i>low fir<i>e</i>, won't you,
put thi<i>s</i> pa<i>ss</i>ion to cook.

490
01:00:50,828 --> 01:00:55,390
Th<i>e</i>n a<i>s</i> it <i>s</i>imm<i>e</i>rs,
add a babbling brook.

491
01:00:55,633 --> 01:01:01,230
Add a riv<i>e</i>r, and an oc<i>e</i>an.
Mayb<i>e</i> a pot of wat<i>e</i>r.

492
01:01:01,438 --> 01:01:04,896
Th<i>e</i>n <i>s</i>prinkl<i>e</i> a bit. Stir it all up.
And watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i> colour.

493
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:09,569
Watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out
th<i>e</i> colour of patrioti<i>s</i>m, my fri<i>e</i>nd.

494
01:01:11,282 --> 01:01:12,579
Bismil has sent a message...

495
01:01:13,617 --> 01:01:15,084
...the Lucknow train...

496
01:01:15,286 --> 01:01:16,913
...which carries the Empire's money...

497
01:01:17,288 --> 01:01:19,756
...will be looted by us in
seven days, in Kakori...

498
01:01:20,858 --> 01:01:22,758
And we will buy bombs with that money.

499
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:26,827
Now paint th<i>e</i> whol<i>e</i> town with it.
Paint your v<i>e</i>ry b<i>e</i>ing.

500
01:01:27,464 --> 01:01:31,423
Paint your <i>e</i>v<i>e</i>ry v<i>e</i>in with it.
Paint it with a <i>s</i>mil<i>e</i>.

501
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:36,095
Paint thos<i>e</i> childhood y<i>e</i>ars, won't you.
Paint th<i>e</i> flu<i>s</i>h of youth.

502
01:01:36,807 --> 01:01:41,267
Don't h<i>es</i>itat<i>e</i>, my fri<i>e</i>nd.
Paint your patrioti<i>s</i>m ov<i>e</i>r <i>e</i>v<i>e</i>rything.

503
01:01:41,478 --> 01:01:45,778
Watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i>
colour of patrioti<i>s</i>m, my fri<i>e</i>nd.

504
01:01:46,483 --> 01:01:50,783
Tak<i>e s</i>om<i>e s</i>oil of my land,
th<i>e s</i>c<i>e</i>nt of thi<i>s</i> air.

505
01:01:51,155 --> 01:01:59,756
Tak<i>e s</i>om<i>e s</i>oil of my land,
th<i>e s</i>c<i>e</i>nt of thi<i>s</i> air.

506
01:01:59,863 --> 01:02:04,596
Add th<i>e</i> br<i>e</i>ath of my b<i>e</i>ing,
th<i>e</i> throbbing of my h<i>e</i>art.

507
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:10,463
And th<i>e</i> z<i>e</i>al,
that rac<i>es</i> through my blood.

508
01:02:11,008 --> 01:02:15,308
Tak<i>e</i> all th<i>ese</i> and <i>s</i>tir it.
Th<i>e</i>n watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i> colour.

509
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:20,139
Watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i>
colour of patrioti<i>s</i>m, my fri<i>e</i>nd.

510
01:02:22,686 --> 01:02:35,497
Watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i> colour.

511
01:03:09,566 --> 01:03:17,200
Watch a<i>s</i> it bring<i>s</i> out th<i>e</i>
colour of patrioti<i>s</i>m, my fri<i>e</i>nd.

512
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:50,939
British Officers...
around 20 to 25 of them.

513
01:03:51,809 --> 01:03:55,108
We have to call it off! We've nearly
reached Kakori. Stop Ashfaq, quick.

514
01:04:03,987 --> 01:04:04,954
Ashfaq, stop!

515
01:04:07,991 --> 01:04:09,788
It's too late to back out now...
Come on... Move!

516
01:04:27,344 --> 01:04:27,969
Get inside!

517
01:04:42,326 --> 01:04:44,055
Keep the windows shut...

518
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:47,155
Come on!

519
01:04:48,365 --> 01:04:48,831
The keys!

520
01:04:49,366 --> 01:04:50,663
You won't get away with this.

521
01:04:51,101 --> 01:04:53,661
Give me the keys!
- I don't hav<i>e</i> it.

522
01:04:54,204 --> 01:04:55,671
Banwari get the sledge hammer.

523
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:01,839
I'll handle them.
You go get the money...

524
01:07:21,018 --> 01:07:23,486
I've committed my life
to the freedom of this country.

525
01:07:24,855 --> 01:07:29,155
Comfort, and other worldly
desires do not attract me.

526
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:34,160
I know you want me to
get married and settle down...

527
01:07:34,531 --> 01:07:36,658
...like all parents do.

528
01:07:37,034 --> 01:07:39,002
But freedom is my bride.

529
01:07:41,038 --> 01:07:46,499
I hope you'll forgive me.
Your most obedient son, Bhagat.

530
01:07:52,883 --> 01:07:53,508
Let's take a break.

531
01:07:58,555 --> 01:08:01,854
Breakfast?
No...

532
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:22,870
Put it there.

533
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:28,211
General Dyer? How can one even think
of doing something like this?

534
01:08:31,088 --> 01:08:35,548
I can't believe that he actually killed more
than 400 people at Jallianwala Baugh.

535
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,057
379... that was the official figure.

536
01:08:38,762 --> 01:08:41,060
Actually nearly 1000
people were butchered...

537
01:08:48,772 --> 01:08:54,574
Last year at the tomb of Peer Sai,
I prayed for Daljeet's well being.

538
01:08:55,112 --> 01:08:56,238
Who's Daljeet?

539
01:08:56,446 --> 01:08:58,573
We were the epitome of tolerance.

540
01:08:59,783 --> 01:09:04,584
Even an ant reacts. But we are conditioned
to take everything lying down.

541
01:09:05,355 --> 01:09:08,085
Rubbish! It's today's generation
which lacks the will to do anything

542
01:09:08,291 --> 01:09:09,918
Have you ever heard of
Shaheed Uddham Singh?

543
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:14,089
He went all the way to London
and killed that Dyer.

544
01:09:14,631 --> 01:09:17,600
...because he was also a part
of the Jallianwala Baugh massacre.

545
01:09:18,135 --> 01:09:21,764
Eat it Sonia.
The butter will strengthen your bones.

546
01:09:22,139 --> 01:09:26,098
In Punjab every mother sends
at least one son to the army.

547
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:29,278
Why should we retreat?
Sacrifice runs in our blood.

548
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:32,277
Only idiots like DJ retreat.

549
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:34,109
Why does it always come back to me?

550
01:09:34,317 --> 01:09:37,115
Shut up and eat your paratha.

551
01:09:37,387 --> 01:09:39,947
What is the most used word in this country?
ADJUST!

552
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:44,950
Six people sitting on a seat forfour... someone
will squeeze in and say - 'Please adjust! '.

553
01:09:48,832 --> 01:09:55,965
Hey! Why are you adjusting?

554
01:09:59,843 --> 01:10:01,140
Strange. Isn't it?

555
01:10:03,013 --> 01:10:08,474
We are being hunted like
animals in our own country...

556
01:10:11,354 --> 01:10:14,152
...Ashfaq you should cross the border
and get to Afghanistan...

557
01:10:15,192 --> 01:10:18,650
...We have many Muslim friends there.
You will be safe with them.

558
01:10:19,196 --> 01:10:20,663
After all, you're one of their own.

559
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:22,995
One of their own?
Hmm...

560
01:10:23,867 --> 01:10:24,993
Why don't you think of me
as one of your own?

561
01:10:29,206 --> 01:10:30,332
Ashfaq... I never meant...

562
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,000
...Ashfaq...

563
01:10:36,546 --> 01:10:38,673
I didn't mean to hurt you.

564
01:10:40,217 --> 01:10:42,685
This is your country as much as it is mine.

565
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:47,520
You have a right to fight and die for it too...

566
01:10:49,593 --> 01:10:50,855
...Forgive me.

567
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:52,688
Ram, let us not talk of dying...

568
01:10:53,063 --> 01:10:58,365
I pray, that we all live to see
our grandchildren grow up in a free country.

569
01:11:02,906 --> 01:11:04,032
Ram run!

570
01:12:19,649 --> 01:12:21,446
Where are your otherfriends?

571
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:23,786
Where's Azad?

572
01:13:13,203 --> 01:13:13,999
Banwari!

573
01:14:27,243 --> 01:14:29,575
I loved those songs and dances.
Do they happen in yourfilms?

574
01:14:29,946 --> 01:14:33,473
That's the reason we grow trees
in this country... to dance around them.

575
01:14:38,588 --> 01:14:41,056
So where are we going?

576
01:14:43,927 --> 01:14:46,555
Special day, special place!
Sp<i>e</i>cial DA<i>Y</i>?

577
01:16:02,338 --> 01:16:06,297
Ever since I was a kid
I used to come here...

578
01:16:07,544 --> 01:16:12,311
...to watch planes take off... and watch them
till they don't disappear in the sky.

579
01:16:16,519 --> 01:16:18,487
What the hell are they doing?

580
01:16:45,048 --> 01:16:46,310
I don't believe them.

581
01:16:46,449 --> 01:16:47,006
Men!

582
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:49,848
Come on, face it,
you'd love to do that really.

583
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:52,317
What? Take my shirt off
and howl at planes.

584
01:16:52,555 --> 01:16:54,352
I won't mind if you do.

585
01:16:54,891 --> 01:16:56,518
Dream on buddy...

586
01:17:04,067 --> 01:17:08,367
Boys and girls
and Sukhi...

587
01:17:08,571 --> 01:17:09,697
Why me all the time?

588
01:17:09,939 --> 01:17:11,372
I want to make a special announcement...

589
01:17:12,909 --> 01:17:16,868
I was wondering if you'd like
to spend the rest of your life with me...

590
01:17:17,747 --> 01:17:21,706
...that's in case you aren't
doing anything important...

591
01:17:25,822 --> 01:17:27,380
Will you please marry me?

592
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:58,077
UTv
