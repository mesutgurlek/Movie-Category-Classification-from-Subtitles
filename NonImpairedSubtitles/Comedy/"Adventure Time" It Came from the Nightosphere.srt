1
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:10,908
Thanks for helping me record, Finn.

2
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:12,346
No problem, Marceline.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,795
Now, I'm gonna sing something really
personal, so don't laugh at me.

4
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:18,842
I would never dream of it...
m'lady. (Laughs)

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,497
Now, start a slow beat, and keep it
steady, or it'll mess up
everything.

6
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:24,483
You got it!

7
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,823
Daddy, why did you eat my fries?

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,114
I bought them, and they were mine.

9
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:45,641
But you ate them, yeah, you ate my fries...

10
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:49,614
And I cried, but you didn't see me cry.

11
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:53,780
Daddy, Do you even love me?

12
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:56,154
Well, I wish you'd show it,

13
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:57,920
'Cause I wouldn't know it.

14
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,524
What kind of dad eats his daughter's fries,

15
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,809
And doesn't look her in the eyes?

16
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:05,028
Daddy, there were tears there.

17
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:07,518
If you saw them would you even care?

18
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:14,706
Huh? Finn, you messed the beat up!

19
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,673
Marceline, if you're
thinkin' about your dad

20
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:18,638
so much, then... why
don't you go see 'im?

21
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,125
He's not worth the effort.

22
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,508
Not worth what effort?

23
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:25,396
Well... first, I'd
have to draw a circle

24
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:28,374
with a happy face
in the center..

25
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:29,601
And then... uh... douse it with bug milk.

26
00:01:29,117 --> 00:01:30,117
Oh, yeah?!

27
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:38,454
And then you're supposed to chant something
like, "Maloso
vobiscum et cum spiritum."

28
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:42,085
But... I-I don't really wanna see him.

29
00:01:42,364 --> 00:01:44,816
I'm still mad about the
thing with the fries. Huh?!

30
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,889
Wwwwhhhat?! Whoa... whoa!! Aaagh!!

31
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:51,549
Marceline!

32
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:53,626
Finn... what the heck did you do?!

33
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:56,363
I... reunited you with your family?

34
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,603
Is this kid your evil servant?

35
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:02,834
I'm not evil, Marceline's dad. I'm super good!

36
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:03,975
"Super good?"

37
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:07,346
What're you doing?!

38
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:10,121
Stealing your soul.

39
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:17,041
Dad! Ugh! You always do stuff like this!

40
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:19,590
Haha! Oh, Marceline!

41
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,358
I never know what's gonna set you off!

42
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:23,570
Whoa! Is this the family axe?

43
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,251
Wha—? HEY!!!

44
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:26,492
Did you turn it into some kind of lute?

45
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:29,027
Give it back, and get out!!!

46
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:30,753
Okay, I'll go.

47
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:32,924
I've got business to attend to, anyway-

48
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:35,406
—sucking up all the souls in Oooooo...

49
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:37,027
WHA—Gh—NO!!

50
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:38,243
See you kids later!

51
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:42,955
My bass!

52
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:44,801
I've unleashed evil onto Ooo!

53
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,325
We've gotta stop 'im, Marceline!

54
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:49,618
Fine... but I'm only coming with you to get my bass back.

55
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,574
Hey! How do I kill this guy, anyway?

56
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:55,846
Finn! You can't kill my dad!

57
00:02:56,453 --> 00:02:58,779
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean—

58
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:03,436
No! You literally can't kill my dad! He's deathless!

59
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:04,554
Oh...

60
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:10,330
Huh? Who the fluff are you?

61
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:14,312
Um... Well, I'm sure not the guy who's gonna suck out your soul.

62
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:16,737
Good 'cause that's, like, my number one fear.

63
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,062
Really!? Well... I know a little exercise for that! Wanna try?

64
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,420
Wow...

65
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:25,139
First... close your eyes.

66
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:25,934
Okay!

67
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,880
AAH! You coulda killed me!

68
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,379
Ah, but I didn't! And now, aren't you thrilled just to be alive?

69
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:34,119
Yeah, I guess... So what?

70
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:38,209
So... This next part will be all the more... horrifying.

71
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:45,841
There!! Below us! A gathering of Fluffy People!

72
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:47,588
May-haps they've seen your father!

73
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:50,318
Marceline... release the Finn-bomb!

74
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:56,966
They're all freaked out!

75
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:58,508
It's because they're scared of him.

76
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,662
Hm. My dad's been here. Come on. Let's go.

77
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:07,502
No! We gotta help this guy.

78
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:10,326
I've got some soul food that Jake packed for me.

79
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,221
You like, uh, collard greens or country-fried steak?

80
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:19,457
Look. You wanna help him? Help me get my bass back.

81
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:20,635
How will that help hi—?

82
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:24,587
MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR, FINN!! And when I get it back...

83
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:29,125
I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere!

84
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:34,101
Oh, clam! But first you
gotta return the souls

85
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:35,825
your dad sucked back to
these sad, little husks.

86
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:36,838
Right, Marceline?

87
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,686
Uh, sure, yeah, yeah, we'll do that.

88
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:42,183
So I popped his head like a cork!

89
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:46,409
And I says, "That's what I think of expanding Earth theory!"

90
00:04:51,654 --> 00:04:52,279
Alright.

91
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,091
Huh?!

92
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,625
I've got a joke, too.

93
00:04:56,222 --> 00:05:01,720
What wears a dark suit, is completely evil, and is about to suck out all your souls?

94
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:02,880
Yo mama!

95
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,986
That's right! I'm your mama!

96
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:15,765
Red Rock Pass. If my dad wants to get through the mountains,

97
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,742
he'll have to come through here.

98
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:20,072
We can work together! And smash 'im with this rock!

99
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:21,485
And once he's smooshed,

100
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,791
all the souls will go back to their rightful bods.

101
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:36,530
Huh?

102
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:43,979
So, finally taking a run at your old man, huh?

103
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:47,586
Daddy...

104
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:49,989
Karate kick!!

105
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:54,295
Marceline!! Keep 'im right there!! HrrrrRAAAAGH!!!

106
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:00,680
Karate chop!!

107
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,179
You can't destroy me!

108
00:06:04,682 --> 00:06:07,726
No... D-dad... I-I don't wanna destroy you...

109
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:10,201
Look, just... stay out of my life!!

110
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:11,683
You're not even alive!

111
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,720
You blew it, dude. We're supposed to be a team—

112
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,932
a team whose sport is stop-your-dad-from-suckin'-souls... ball.

113
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,872
I just want my dad to care about me.

114
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:29,239
Of all history's greatest monsters, 
you are by far the most evil thing I've encountered.

115
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:32,121
Offer your soul to me, dark one.

116
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:33,084
Wenk wenk.

117
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:36,384
NO! You can't have my soul! I don't even...!

118
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:37,978
Look, just get in here.

119
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:40,353
Wenk wenk.

120
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:41,953
Keep your crummy soul!

121
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:46,100
Gunter! Who told you you could fly?!

122
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:46,463
Wenk.

123
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:52,918
 Huh? No one sucks the life from my penguins except me!

124
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,287
...And maybe polar bears, because that's just nature, Gunter.

125
00:06:57,056 --> 00:07:00,099
You darest encroach upon my domain?!

126
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:04,839
You've raised my frosty dander! And for that, I shall—

127
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,002
AAAAAOOOOOHHH!! I've soiled my tunic... completely by choice!

128
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:16,358
YES!!

129
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,114
Aw, man! He's growing huge!

130
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,432
I'm gonna take 'im down!

131
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:32,158
Finn, you're like an ant to him.

132
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,806
Oh, yeah? Well, this ant's about to get in his pants!

133
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:36,782
What?

134
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:37,500
Wha?

135
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:41,949
Because I'm going to make him uncomfortable
 while I release those souls!

136
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:45,156
RAAAAAAAAGH!!!

137
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:48,037
Give up those souls, Marceline's dad!

138
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:49,662
In the name of justice!!

139
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:50,275
Huh?

140
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:53,668
Oh, Marceline. Still following me?

141
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:56,631
I'll stop following you if you give me back my guitar!

142
00:07:58,162 --> 00:07:59,293
No, Marceline.

143
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:02,687
NO ONE FLICKS ME IN THE BUTT WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!!

144
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,381
Whoa, WHOA!

145
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:11,119
Whoooaa!!

146
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:13,636
The souls...

147
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:16,492
 Lumpy Space Princess! He got your soul, too?!

148
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:17,856
What? Nah.

149
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:21,137
I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here,

150
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,925
and I wasn't invited?!

151
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:26,140
I was all, "What the lump?" so I'm crashin' this party!

152
00:08:27,737 --> 00:08:30,612
Well, I'll save you... I'LL SAVE ALL OF YOU!!

153
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,663
IN YOUR FACE, DAD!

154
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:43,067
Give back that ax, Marceline! 
You don't respect it enough!

155
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:48,291
Well... you don't respect anything!
 Dad!! DAD!! I'm outta here!

156
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,993
BUT—!!

157
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:52,492
Fine!! Go!! I'm too busy sucking to deal with you!

158
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:56,025
NO, WAIT! Marceline!! Keep talking to 'im!

159
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:57,960
When he's talking, he can't steal souls!!

160
00:08:58,024 --> 00:08:59,712
I said I'm outta here!

161
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:02,305
Diversion... need... diversion.

162
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:07,009
Daddy, why did you eat my fries?

163
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,342
I bought them, and they were mine.

164
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,682
But you ate them, yeah, you ate my fries...

165
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:19,815
And I cried, but you didn't see me cry.

166
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:21,854
Daddy,

167
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,193
Do you even love me?

168
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:26,122
Well, I wish you'd show it,

169
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:27,379
Oh, my Glob, you guys! Drama bomb!

170
00:09:27,954 --> 00:09:30,710
Marceline, do you really feel this way?

171
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:31,979
Dad, I...

172
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:35,559
Marceline... of course I love you.

173
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:36,454
Dad...

174
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:38,829
I'm sorry I ate your fries. I didn't mean to hurt you.

175
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:41,353
It's okay, Dad. It's... it's really okay.

176
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:44,947
No, it's not okay. They weren't even very good. They were really cold.

177
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:48,859
I love you, Marceline. Don't you ever doubt that.

178
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:50,142
I love you, too, Dad.

179
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:52,171
Oh, Marceline, I am so—

180
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:54,492
YALALALALALALALALALALALALA!!!!!

181
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:05,204
MALOSO VOBISCUM ET CUM SPIRITUM!!

182
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:10,141
I'll see you in the Nightosphere, ya sick freak.

183
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,998
YES!!!!

184
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,823
Finn!! How could you do that?!

185
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:16,310
How could I... save the day?

186
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:20,160
How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad?!

187
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:22,134
How could I embarrass-save you??

188
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,754
WHOA! Marceline!

189
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,822
I'm glad he's back in the Nightosphere. 
That was emotionally exhausting.

190
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:34,154
I'm also exhausted emotionally. Or... wait. 
I mean, I mean physically.

191
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:42,997
I've been meaning to ask you... What's with that pocket on your shirt?

192
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,037
Oh, Jake's in here. 'Sup, Jake?

193
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:45,644
