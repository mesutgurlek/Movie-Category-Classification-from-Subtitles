1
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,759
Hey, good morning, New York.
Scott Zoe here...

2
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:55,013
...at 102.7, WNEW-FM,
where rock lives.

3
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,015
Beautiful autumn
day in the city...

4
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,977
...and a great record
coming your way too.

5
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,340
Ben!

6
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,303
Ben!

7
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,975
Get up, get up, get up!
Late, late, late!

8
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,604
Ben! Come on, honey. Get up.
We're seriously late.

9
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,734
You may think this is funny,
but this is so not...

10
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,818
...funny.

11
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,487
I'm not kidding
anymore, Ben.

12
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,449
You make yourself
appear right this instant.

13
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,208
The clock is ticking, Ben!
Come on now!

14
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,255
Anna?

15
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,715
Oh good, you're already up.

16
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,426
You forgot to wash my shirt.
I told you a hundred times.

17
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,762
Today is purple shirt
day at school.

18
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,014
I didn't forget.

19
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:23,060
Actually, I was up half the
night thinking about it.

20
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:23,936
Yeah, right.

21
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,981
And I concluded that
you are too special...

22
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,191
...to look like everyone else.

23
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,735
So, orangey-red.
That's your colour.

24
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,320
Few can carry it off.

25
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,238
Now...

26
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,282
- Would you help me find your brother?
- You lost Ben?

27
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,828
No.
I didn't lose Ben.

28
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,047
All right, Ben, fine.

29
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,716
You explain to your teacher
why you're late.

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,386
Your daddy said he had a very
important case this morning...

31
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,971
...and had to go to work early.

32
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,932
And he left us here
to be responsible...

33
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,392
...that we could...

34
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,768
Shit!

35
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,770
You're so not funny.

36
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,438
Not funny!
And you're also late.

37
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,483
And that means you have
to get dressed right now!

38
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,570
Stay. No, stay. Ben! Ben!

39
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,446
This is not funny!

40
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,324
We've got to get you dressed.
We're running so late.

41
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,285
This is not a game!

42
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,162
Come on. Help me out.
Ben!

43
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,374
Come on, Ben!
Really, we're so late!

44
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,501
But I don't want
to go to school.

45
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,546
Mommy!

46
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:33,964
Mommy!

47
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,591
Hi, sweetie!

48
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,803
Ben, you look like you're
having such a good time!

49
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,014
But we're running a little late.

50
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,891
Sweetie, I thought you're supposed
to be wearing purple today.

51
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,726
She forgot to wash it.

52
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,439
What a hug!

53
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,278
I'll handle it from here, Isabel.

54
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,198
I'm sure you will, Jackie.

55
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,833
Oh, my gosh!
She made you a lunch?

56
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,466
Okay, come on.

57
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,691
Mom, why do we have to
listen to this classical stuff?

58
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,860
Because I like it,
and I'm driving...

59
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,239
...and when you get your own
car, you can pick the music.

60
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,824
Why does Isabel wear
Daddy's underpants?

61
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,035
Doesn't she have
underpants of her own?

62
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,164
Huh, well, I saw a whopping pile of
laundry sitting on the washing machine.

63
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:53,168
- Perhaps her underpants are there.
- Yeah, right next to my purple shirt.

64
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,878
I'm never speaking to her again.

65
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,047
Never say never.
Here's your vitamins.

66
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,174
She's always
messing up my life.

67
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,343
It's not fair to say "always."

68
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,885
I hate her!
She's such a witch.

69
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,264
Hey! No name-calling.
Use your words.

70
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,140
I hate when you say that.

71
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,392
Now, that's a beginning.

72
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,561
" Hate" is a totally
acceptable word...

73
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,062
...you just be careful
when you use it...

74
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,857
...and only use it when
you truly detest something.

75
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,024
Like what?

76
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,818
Well, like...

77
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,530
...the planet Uranus. I hate that.
It's a terrible name for a planet.

78
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,240
Uranus!

79
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,201
- And the hokey-pokey.
- Hokey-pokey?

80
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,995
The hokey-pokey.
I hate the hokey-pokey.

81
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,539
Putting your foot in and out
at weddings. It's terrible!

82
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,628
I hate when you do that!
I can smell your breakfast!

83
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,589
Point well-taken.

84
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:46,430
Ladies, let's just calm
down. She'll be here.

85
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,849
Isabel, where are you?
Come on. Any word?

86
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,100
Yeah. She's on her way.

87
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,436
- She's on her way. I promise.
- Oh, really?

88
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,687
How do you know?

89
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,772
I'm here! I'm sorry I'm late.

90
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,357
What a crisis!

91
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,402
White pants, black top?
And the white or black bra?

92
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,237
And then I picked this...

93
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,573
- All righty.
- I'm here. I'm lame.

94
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,617
You got a Froot Loop
in your hair.

95
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,212
Get me a digital
camera right now.

96
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,672
Russell, get this out
of here, please?

97
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,382
Quikly.
Come on, boys!

98
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,140
Why is she shooting this?

99
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,976
Isabel, we have been
waiting for an hour.

100
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,146
I know. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

101
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,232
Why are you shooting this?

102
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,651
Because I'm brilliant.

103
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,694
And I see something you don't.

104
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,780
So stand back and trust me,
why don't you?

105
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,114
Oh, I trust you!

106
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,784
I just don't understand why are you
shooting the craft service guy...

107
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:53,080
...when I've got 5 male models
in very expensive suits over here?

108
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,708
Thank you, ladies. That's lovely.
That's a wrap, everybody!

109
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,086
No, it's not a wrap!

110
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,340
She's kidding! You are kidding,
aren't you, Isabel?

111
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,094
I'm not kidding actually. And if
you meet me here in an hour...

112
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,471
...l will prove to you
why you hired me...

113
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:12,099
...even though I
wouldn't sleep with you.

114
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,107
She's got such a
great sense of humor.

115
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,488
Wait.

116
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,909
Let's see...

117
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,536
...if I can save...

118
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,621
...both our jobs.

119
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,086
- Interesting.
- Look at that!

120
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,340
Wow! It's the
little guy in the suit.

121
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,426
- What do you think?
- I like it.

122
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,802
I like it. Good work.

123
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,804
I like it too. Very creative.

124
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,347
Thank you.

125
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,600
Congratulations, Duncan.

126
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,397
That suit takes
pounds off of him.

127
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,816
While change is exhilarating
for an adult...

128
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,694
...it can be quite a
challenge for a child.

129
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,656
I won't get that.

130
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,743
It's fine.

131
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,203
Change.

132
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,871
You were talking
about change.

133
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,040
Well, the fact that you
two are remarrying...

134
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,708
...obviously has Anna overjoyed.

135
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,669
And she's very excited about
the move to Switzerland.

136
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,339
She said we are remarrying?

137
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,510
And my concern is that Anna seems
apathetic towards her work...

138
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:32,012
...knowing she's leaving
before this semester.

139
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,723
- Mrs. Franklin, we are not...
- No plans on getting...

140
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,185
- Remarried. There's no move...
- To Switzerland.

141
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,437
Really?

142
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,605
Really.

143
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,317
Well, then, my
concern for Anna...

144
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,777
...is that she...

145
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,655
- Are you here?
- I'm here.

146
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,157
- 'Cause you don't seem like you're here.
- I'm here!

147
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,911
The judge is about to rule on a motion
that could make or break my case.

148
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:59,122
- But have I answered my beeper?
- So turn it off.

149
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:04,169
I'm wondering if there's anything
going at home that could possibly be...

150
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:07,464
...intensifying Anna's need
to create this fantasy.

151
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,758
I've been seeing another woman
through the past year.

152
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,261
Since we're divorced he's seen
a number of women, and...

153
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,762
Saw a few women when
we first split up...

154
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,889
...but I've been seeing one
woman for the past year.

155
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,766
After a lot of thought and
carefull discussion with her...

156
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,185
...and the kids - I might add -
she moved in last month.

157
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,646
- He's living with a woman half his age.
- Isabel's not half my age.

158
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,107
- We're not discussing your age.
- Then why bring it up?

159
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,525
When they go to your house,
they wanna be with you.

160
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,652
They want to be
with their father!

161
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,445
When they come to my house,
they want to be a part of my life.

162
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,364
Isabel's part of my life.

163
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:36,577
Mr. Harrison, I hear you talking
about your life, your needs, but...

164
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,371
...are you really in touch
with what Anna needs?

165
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:43,166
Anna needs a home where
she feels safe and loved.

166
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,168
What I'm trying to give her.

167
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:48,046
- I thought that's what she already had.
- I'd walk through fire for Anna.

168
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,799
Gladly. Any day of the week.

169
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,010
Except Thursday, when Isabel
forgot to pick them up.

170
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,971
Jackie, she was 5 minutes
late, for Christ's sakes!

171
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,890
She was 5 minutes late!

172
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,019
I'm wondering if Anna could be
responding to the underline hostility...

173
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,647
...that exists between your
girlfriend and Mrs. Harrison.

174
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,442
Well, of course she's
responding to it.

175
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,778
Mrs. Franklin, do you think
any of this is easy for us?

176
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,280
Do you think it's
easy for Jackie to...

177
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,200
...watch her kids looked
after by another woman?

178
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,492
Not to mention that...

179
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,621
...a woman who really has
no experience being a mother.

180
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:24,041
Of course Jackie's
going to be irrational...

181
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,375
...hostile...

182
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,877
...defensive.

183
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,796
Thank you, Luke.

184
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,762
I didn't say that.
Why would I say that...

185
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,597
...you and daddy were
getting back together?

186
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,432
Sometimes people
make up stories...

187
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,601
...about things that
they wish would happen!

188
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,978
I don't want that to happen.
Why would I want that to happen?

189
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,439
Okay, pick a card.
Any card.

190
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,358
Because you're upset.

191
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,693
You know, because
Isabel moved in and...

192
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,030
I'm not upset. I'm not
geting myself upset over her.

193
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,740
Ok. Tear it in half.

194
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,450
Look, sweetie.

195
00:10:58,534 --> 00:10:59,785
- If it means that...
- Again.

196
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,538
- If you really...
- Again.

197
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:03,997
If you want...

198
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,165
And again.

199
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:06,917
Time out.

200
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,420
If you don't want to talk
about this now, it's ok. Really.

201
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,506
You don't have to.

202
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,259
But don't look me in
the eye and lie to me.

203
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,302
It hurts my feelings,
I get angry, and...

204
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,348
Anyway, you're only allowed so many lies
before it starts showing in your face...

205
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,350
...and you wind up
looking like...

206
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:25,644
Like who?

207
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,022
Well, he's not President
anymore, so why be petty?

208
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,527
I'm sorry I said it.

209
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,196
I guess sometimes I just...

210
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,576
You know, sometimes I do
wish you and Daddy would...

211
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,077
Well, you know.

212
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:48,417
I figured if I said it out loud,
it just... might come true.

213
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,419
Yeah, I know.

214
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,107
It's not that I can't cook.
It's that I choose not to cook.

215
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,902
- There's a big difference.
- You don't have to cook.

216
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,446
Could we save
some of the wine?

217
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,159
- I need it for the sauce.
- Too late.

218
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,411
Hi, honey.

219
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,424
You better get it.

220
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,975
- Who's there?
- Nobody there.

221
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,357
I missed you today.

222
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,943
I missed you too.
I miss you every day.

223
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,319
How was your day, baby?

224
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,280
It was pretty good, except
I got to go back to Pittsburgh.

225
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:03,033
Yeah, I got to go
tomorrow till Sunday.

226
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,203
But I'll have to order in.

227
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,498
Well, we got the kids for
the weekend, so I figured...

228
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,750
...that you and the kids...

229
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,837
...and me could all go...

230
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,964
...to Pittsburgh together.

231
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,007
Never going to happen.

232
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:22,886
No? Come on! We could
get a great hotel room.

233
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,430
We could take in a
baseball game or something.

234
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,808
- What do you think?
- Pass.

235
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,478
All right. Then I'll
call the babysitter.

236
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,021
What for?

237
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:36,108
Well, I don't expect you
to handle them yourself.

238
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,405
What?

239
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:45,951
Can't handle them myself.
That's what you mean, isn't it?

240
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,161
No.

241
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:08,932
You don't trust me to be
alone with your kids.

242
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,017
- Yes, I do.
- No.

243
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,227
Of course I do.
It's just that...

244
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,813
- What?
- They're a handful.

245
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,525
Luke, by keeping me apart
from them, is like you saying...

246
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,986
..."Hey kids, this is fun.
Keep on hating her."

247
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,613
Oh, I don't say that.
They don't hate you.

248
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,156
- Really?

249
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,826
Look in their eyes, honey.
Look in your ex-wife's eyes.

250
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,455
Jackie's just protecting her kids.
What do you expect?

251
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,290
It's hard for her.
It's complicated.

252
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,375
You don't understand.
You don't have kids.

253
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,840
So... it's just complicated
for you and Jackie.

254
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:46,637
For me, it's pretty simple
because I don't have kids.

255
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,181
Look... I'm just trying to make
things work here and...

256
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,475
...trying to give you guys time
to get used to living together.

257
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,893
All right then.

258
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:57,689
Back off just a little bit,
and give me a chance, okay?

259
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,870
What is your problem, asshole?

260
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,164
You are my problem!

261
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,797
You're absolutely right, baby.

262
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,633
Your kids don't hate me.
I'm just...

263
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,260
I'm just paranoid.
Call your daughter.

264
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,559
I trust you.

265
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,768
Really?

266
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,979
I'll give you a chance
if you still want it.

267
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,691
- I do.
- Are you sure?

268
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,692
Yes.

269
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:43,986
Okay.

270
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,825
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

271
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,953
Don't fight with me
when I'm hungry.

272
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,292
So, how long will
you be out of town?

273
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,835
Till Sunday morning.

274
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,503
I'm worried.

275
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:02,379
About what?

276
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,882
About being alone
with her all weekend.

277
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,259
I mean... what if she
burns the place down?

278
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,511
Well, just keep an
eye on her and...

279
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,598
...make sure you boys got
the fire extinguisher's handy.

280
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,933
- You ready to launch her?
- Yeah.

281
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,311
Let's give her a good push.

282
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:23,192
So, why did she move
in with you anyways?

283
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,695
Because we love
each other, and...

284
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,947
...because we want to
share our life together.

285
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,283
You already had
a life with Mommy.

286
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:35,162
But Mommy and I weren't
getting along very well...

287
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:39,249
...and it wasn't fair to you
guys, us fighting all the time.

288
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,752
I fight with Anna all the time.

289
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,712
Can I move out?

290
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,340
No. But you guys
are brother and sister.

291
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,552
You were husband and wife.
Doesn't that mean something?

292
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:54,097
Yes...
It does.

293
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,352
But...

294
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,853
Well...

295
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,814
When you get older...

296
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:05,776
...your relationships get
a lot more complicated.

297
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,614
And there's all kinds of
feelings flying around.

298
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,408
And sometimes...

299
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,912
...some of those
feelings change.

300
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,127
But did you fall out
of love with Mommy?

301
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,591
Well...

302
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,095
Yeah.

303
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,681
I guess I did.

304
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,269
I still love your mom.

305
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:42,855
It just...

306
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:46,358
...became a different
kind of love, that's all.

307
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,362
We're still really good friends,
and we always will be.

308
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,700
Can you ever fall out
of love with your kids?

309
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,201
No.

310
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,414
That is impossible.

311
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,958
- Like Mission: lmpossible.
- Yeah.

312
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,545
Exactly like Mission: lmpossible.
Get over here.

313
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:14,595
Powdered lizard brains.

314
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,892
Crushed werewolf ears...

315
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,394
...and vampire eyes.

316
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,235
God!

317
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,160
Cool!

318
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,592
Check it out. Magic potion.

319
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,260
It's cocoa.

320
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,346
I put a spell on it.
Whoever drinks it...

321
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:00,265
...will go to sleep
for 1000 years.

322
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,267
Whatever.
Spill any on my drawing...

323
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,229
...I'll put you to sleep
for 1000 years.

324
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:09,316
You guys. I have a surprise
for you. Come over to the sofa.

325
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:10,901
Please.

326
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,948
With a little... enthusiasm.

327
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,157
Sit down.

328
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:19,826
All right.

329
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,411
And... close your eyes.

330
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,496
Please.

331
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,164
Okay.

332
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,085
Okay, now.

333
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,629
Don't open them until
I tell you to, okay?

334
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,006
And open!

335
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,301
- Uau!
- What do you think?

336
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,636
Will he eat my bunny?

337
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,930
No!
Puppies don't eat bunnies.

338
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,891
Anna, what do you think?

339
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,810
Well, I'm allergic to dogs.

340
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,772
Your daddy didn't
tell me that.

341
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:51,733
He doesn't know much
about me. He's never around.

342
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,323
Why don't we name the puppy?
Puppy needs a name.

343
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,075
I know. Isabel.

344
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,452
I beg your pardon?

345
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,288
Well, he kinda smells
like you, and...

346
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,165
...and I'm allergic to you too.
It fits perfectly.

347
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,761
Ben, why don't you name
that puppy? I'll be right back.

348
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,642
Listen, young lady, let's
get one thing straight.

349
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,311
Don't touch my things!

350
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,063
I would really like it
if we could get along.

351
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,149
- I don't have to listen to you.
- Yes, you do.

352
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,942
No, I don't.
You're not my mother.

353
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,236
Thank God for that!

354
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:49,082
What I meant, and perhaps
I didn't say it well...

355
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,419
...is you have a great mom.
You don't need another one.

356
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:55,881
But I... would like to be
treated with some respect...

357
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,258
...when you are in this house.

358
00:20:58,342 --> 00:20:59,593
This is my dad's house.

359
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,179
Well, it's my house too.

360
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,807
This is my room, so treat it
with respect and get out.

361
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,814
All right.

362
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,917
"Run, run, run
as fast as you can".

363
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,629
"You can't catch me,
I'm the Stinky Cheese Man".

364
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:39,716
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa?
I made it especially for you.

365
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:41,677
Yes, of course.

366
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,971
The special cocoa.

367
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,649
Delicious.

368
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,737
"A little boy looked up and
sniffed the air and said"...

369
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:04,575
No, now you're cheating. You
skipped the part about the cow.

370
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:10,205
It's bedtime. Can't we
finish this in the morning?

371
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,541
No. Now we have to start
from the beginning...

372
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,129
...and you have to read the whole
thing. I can't sleep otherwise.

373
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:18,547
Okay.

374
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,759
"Once upon a time...

375
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:26,638
...there was a little old woman
and a little old man... "

376
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:29,558
"Who lived together
in a little old house."

377
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,770
You're onto something. Why
don't you read to me a little bit?

378
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,731
"They were lonely.

379
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:40,903
So the little old lady
decided to make a man...

380
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:42,738
...out of stinky cheese.

381
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:47,910
She gave him a piece of bacon for
a mouth and two olives for eyes... "

382
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,010
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

383
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:09,014
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

384
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:13,685
Oh, my God!

385
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,566
What's the matter?

386
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:20,817
I...

387
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:22,653
...killed her.

388
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,157
Killed her! Killed her!

389
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:28,575
Killed her!

390
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,776
- Good morning.
- It is 7:23.

391
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,945
You were supposed
to be here at 6:30.

392
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,281
She has missed her
morning riding lesson.

393
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:10,242
No. It's Monday. Her riding
lesson is on Tuesday.

394
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:14,329
Except for the third Tuesday of the
month, which switches to Monday.

395
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:17,291
And in November, when
she rides on Thursdays.

396
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,168
It's not that difficult!

397
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:21,420
Don't you have some kind of
little black agenda book...

398
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,422
...that you can write
all this down in?

399
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,550
May I have a cup
of coffee, please?

400
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,594
We don't have coffee.

401
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,054
Good morning, Betty Ford.

402
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:34,474
Hey, monkey man. Hi, sweetie.
How are you doing?

403
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,732
Sweetie, go change your shirt.

404
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,151
What happened to Anna?
What did you do?

405
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,528
Maybe you could you just
back off me a little bit.

406
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:47,946
What happened?

407
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:50,991
Nothing happened. I...

408
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,620
Luke was in the shower
this morning and...

409
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:57,331
...Anna sort of...

410
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,918
...walked in without
even knocking.

411
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,504
I don't see why
that would upset her.

412
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,631
I mean, there are
people in our family...

413
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,425
...that have taken
showers before.

414
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:11,011
Well, I was in there with him.

415
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:19,269
And did either of you...

416
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:21,563
...talk to her
about it afterwards?

417
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:23,023
No.

418
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:25,692
I thought it would be
uncomfortable for her.

419
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,779
You mean for you.

420
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,200
A 12-year-old girl is trying
to cope with the fact...

421
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:37,454
...that her father is never moving
back in here with his family.

422
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:41,124
She sees her father naked in the
shower with another woman...

423
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,376
...for the first time...

424
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,712
...and you think it would
be better for her...

425
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,923
...if everyone just pretends
nothing happened?

426
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:52,261
I am so unbelievably sick
of your imperious bullshit.

427
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:54,096
I never said I was
June fucking Cleaver.

428
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,973
You don't use that
language in this house.

429
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:59,768
Every time life hits her hard, you wanna
have some 12-hour conversation...

430
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,356
...every third Tuesday of the month...
You go right ahead, lady. I have a life.

431
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:07,484
Oh, and I don't?
Because I have children?

432
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:14,491
You know, your problem is that
you are so self-involved...

433
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,285
...you couldn't be a mother.

434
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,580
Maybe the problem here
is your daughter.

435
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:22,291
And that she is a spoiled,
wiseass little brat.

436
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,293
Get out of my house.

437
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:25,836
Get out!

438
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:29,631
Are you sure? I didn't
see that on the schedule.

439
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:44,354
Honey, I've got your Halloween costume.
Let's see if it's the right size, ok?

440
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,440
A hippie?

441
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,902
Didn't you say you
wanted to be a hippie?

442
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,778
That was last month.

443
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,280
Oh!... well...

444
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:56,200
Okay, what do you
want to be this month?

445
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,202
Elvis.

446
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,037
Elvis? What kind of Elvis?

447
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,664
You mean, like,
black leather jacket Elvis?

448
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:04,374
Gold lamé Elvis.

449
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,250
Gold lamé Elvis?

450
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:08,962
That's pre-drugs, pre-chubby,
pre-army, pre-bad movie...

451
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:10,714
...all of that Elvis?
- Yeah.

452
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:11,798
Honey...

453
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,388
When Daddy was...

454
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:19,806
...washing Isabel...

455
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:23,727
...in the shower, what did
you think that was about?

456
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:26,813
Well, sex, of course.

457
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,489
Why does Isabel scream?

458
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:36,448
Scream?

459
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,408
During sex.

460
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,327
How do you know she
screams during sex?

461
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,621
I live in the same country.

462
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:51,213
- Why are you asking me?
- Just checking.

463
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,507
I like to talk to you
about stuff.

464
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,717
I like talking to you
about stuff too.

465
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,762
So, since Daddy's
gonna be working...

466
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:01,849
...you want to do something
on Saturday, just you and me?

467
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,601
Sure, but it'll have to
be in the evening...

468
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:08,188
...'cause I'm helping Bonnie Lyons
move into her apartment, and...

469
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,150
...so you're going to be with...

470
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:13,235
...Isabel.

471
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,070
Again?

472
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,780
That really sucks!

473
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:21,243
Well, you're gonna be at a professional
photo shoot in Central Park.

474
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,871
You guys are going to
have a lot of fun.

475
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:28,166
Switch your hands.
Top hand down, bottom hand up.

476
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,503
Dylan, can you take just one step up
for me please? Just one big step.

477
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:35,632
Rapunzel, would you reach
your hand out there again?

478
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:39,178
Wouldn't it be cool if her
hair came out of her armpits?

479
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:41,263
Oh, sick!

480
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:44,141
I think we can get this
finished before lunch.

481
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:48,187
Folks, we like this light. We'll try
and get this in before lunch.

482
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,856
Come on! It's been
5 hours, we're hungry!

483
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:53,108
Yeah, we're starving!

484
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:58,238
Get yourself another ice
cream, ok? And I'll be done soon.

485
00:28:58,322 --> 00:28:59,573
I promise.

486
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,201
We're rich!

487
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,421
Sleeping Beauty, wake up.

488
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,131
Where's your brother?

489
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,344
I don't know.

490
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:30,229
- What if he's kidnapped?
- He's not kidnapped! He's just...

491
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,314
He's hiding!
Ben!

492
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,483
- Maybe he's in the castle.
- That's a good idea!

493
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,236
Don't touch me!
You bring bad luck.

494
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,394
Okay, watch very carefully.

495
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,000
- Mommy!
- Hi, sweetie!

496
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:40,090
- Are you all right?
- I knew where I was all the time!

497
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:43,594
- We found him in the zoo.
- In the zoo? My God!

498
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:46,597
Hold his hand. Don't let
him out of your sight.

499
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,973
Jackie, I am so sorry.

500
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:51,268
I'm going to say this one
time, so listen carefully.

501
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:56,023
That woman is to have nothing
more to do with my children.

502
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:57,441
Our children.

503
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:00,110
Do you realize what could've
happened to your son?

504
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:04,114
How lucky we are the police found
him, instead of some lunatic?

505
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,283
Jackie, you don't
make it any worse.

506
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,160
Isabel is sorry.
She feels terrible.

507
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,953
- It could've happened to anyone.
- Not to me!

508
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,914
You've made mistakes.
People make mistakes!

509
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,124
Well, I am not gonna sit here
and wait for the next one.

510
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,417
I'm not gonna
watch our children...

511
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,419
...fall through the cracks
of this arrangement.

512
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:18,170
Just calm down.

513
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,380
I'm not going to calm down!
I'm going to a lawyer!

514
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,299
Don't do that! We promised
we'd never do that.

515
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,968
We've broken a lot of promises,
haven't we, Luke?

516
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:26,803
Don't take this out on him.

517
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,430
It's my fault.
Honey...

518
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,557
I'm so sorry!

519
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,894
But you're not making
this any easier on anybody.

520
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:36,647
It is not my job to
make it easier for you.

521
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:41,401
It is my job is to care of those children,
and they don't want to be with you!

522
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,821
I'm getting a court order,
and you are never...

523
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:49,201
...going to be with these children again
alone. Do you understand? Ever!

524
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:08,804
- Mommy...
- What, sweetie?

525
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:11,473
It's not Isabel's fault
that I ran away.

526
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:13,392
No, you're right.
That was your fault.

527
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:17,646
But It's her fault for not taking care of
my precious son as if it was her priority.

528
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:20,357
Which means, her
most important job.

529
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:23,193
Isabel's job is she works.

530
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,445
Mommies work too.
They work very hard!

531
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:26,738
In fact I work harder
as a mommy...

532
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,574
...than I ever did when
I had an outside job...

533
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:32,119
...I just don't get paid!
- Does Isabel make a lot of money?

534
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,289
People like Isabel who think
only about themselves...

535
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:37,791
...often do make a
great deal of money.

536
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:42,004
- I think she's pretty.
- Yeah!...

537
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:44,006
If you like big teeth.

538
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:48,218
- Mommy...
- What, sweetie?

539
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:51,430
If you want me
to hate her, I will.

540
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:19,708
What do you want?

541
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:24,171
Anna left her soccer stuff at the loft.
I figured she might need it this week.

542
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:25,255
Thanks.

543
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:32,054
- Did you talk to the lawyer?
- Yeah.

544
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:34,765
I have an appointment for
the day after tomorrow.

545
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,809
Don't do this.

546
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,480
You will tell me not to put the
kids in the middle of a war.

547
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:44,024
Luke... I'm doing this for
their own well-being.

548
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,651
Partly.

549
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:48,654
And partly you're doing it
because you're mad.

550
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:51,448
You know the kids
aren't in any real danger.

551
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,700
This is about Isabel
and you know it.

552
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:57,204
She made one mistake, but
she's trying! She's learning!

553
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,709
Slugs have a faster learning
curve, ok? Trees, clams...

554
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:05,963
Give her some time, will you?
Don't drive her away.

555
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:10,092
I'm supposed to
care about her?

556
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:12,678
You're supposed to care about
me, like I care about you.

557
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:14,888
Like you cared about me 2 years ago
when you walked out that door?

558
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,265
You kicked me out!

559
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:18,183
You were gone long before
I asked you to leave.

560
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,728
Don't give me this shit!
I was working, for God's sake!

561
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,984
I'm sorry. Look, wait
a second. Don't...

562
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:30,487
Please don't do this
thing with the lawyers.

563
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:35,367
The kids will be
okay, if we're okay.

564
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,247
I'd do it for you.

565
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:57,347
Okay. I'm going to give
you one last chance.

566
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:00,100
Thanks.

567
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:03,687
Thanks!

568
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:07,733
Good night.

569
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:34,259
This is the one that
I really like the best.

570
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:35,677
She's got a
really longing look.

571
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:38,555
- She's great in that.
- He couldn't be more flexed.

572
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:41,058
He's holding his
breath. C-14.

573
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:45,395
Don't you think this one is?
The way he's leaning back?

574
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,481
Kill that music, please.

575
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:49,858
That's passive.
This is dynamic.

576
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,735
He's going up.
He's gonna get that girl.

577
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:54,404
You're the photographer.
You're the genius.

578
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,657
Isabel, it's Anna's school.
They're looking for Luke.

579
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,622
Hello?

580
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:05,791
No, he's not here.
This is...

581
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:10,379
Are you sure you
have the right kids?

582
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:16,134
Because Jackie Harrison would
never forget to pick up her kids.

583
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,721
Are you absolutely
sure it's them?

584
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,309
Of course.
I'll be right there.

585
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:26,895
I will pick them up.
Thank you.

586
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,230
What?

587
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,983
Isabel, may I remind you that
the clients will be here at 4:30?

588
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,609
I know, so I have to hurry.

589
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,361
Everything is gonna be fine.
Don't worry. I'll be back.

590
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:37,990
And I will dazzle you with my
punctuality. To the button.

591
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,534
Isabel, don't do this!

592
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,301
Hi, guys.

593
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:01,972
Barbecue. I know
they're your fave.

594
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,729
How could she... just
forget us? I mean...

595
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:12,649
Yeah. That's something
you would do.

596
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,154
To tell you the truth...

597
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:21,742
...l did.

598
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:27,289
Your mother had to
help a friend with this...

599
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:28,540
...emergency...

600
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:31,084
...and so she called
me to switch days...

601
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:35,464
...but, I got caught up at work
and just forgot all about you.

602
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:37,716
Mommy!

603
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,718
My little chick!

604
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:43,889
How are you, sweetie? I'm sorry
you got stuck. Were you scared?

605
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,684
- You must be starving!
- Yeah.

606
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,061
Yeah? You hungry?

607
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:50,604
- You want a good meal?
- Yeah.

608
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,356
How'd you do
on your math?

609
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:55,150
Was it hard?

610
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:10,874
Who is it?

611
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,710
It's Jackie.
May I come in?

612
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,546
Sure.

613
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:27,391
I have another appointment
this afternoon, and l...

614
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:30,394
I need somebody...

615
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,980
...to take the
children to the park.

616
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:35,357
And have federal agents
jump out of the bushes...

617
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,776
...and serve me
with a court order?

618
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,988
How many years do you get in the state
for giving second-rate care to minors?

619
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:42,906
Whatever it is,
it's not enough.

620
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:46,326
Well, look. I'm on thin ice
already with my boss, alright?

621
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:49,872
When I ran out of here yesterday, I
actually thought he was gonna fire me.

622
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:51,999
I can get somebody else.

623
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,543
Wait. God!

624
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:59,214
I'll figure something
out. I'll do it.

625
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:05,596
After-school snack.

626
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,347
Refrigerate, if possible.

627
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:11,310
Band-Aids, Neosporin,
hand-wipes, Kleenex, Tylenol.

628
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:13,395
Why not just bring
the whole pharmacy?

629
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:16,523
Ben likes to be read to.
You know Dr. Seuss?

630
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:17,649
Not personally.

631
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:24,406
Do you have a word limit you have
to hit every day, or may I finish?

632
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:29,286
Here's the kid's schedule, my beeper
number, in case of emergency.

633
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,747
If not, I'll see you
at 5 o'clock at the park.

634
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,501
All I'm asking is that my children
still be alive when I get there.

635
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,879
Jackie, I wanted
to ask you...

636
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,088
...something.

637
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:46,762
There's a Pearl Jam concert on the
5th, and I would like to take Anna.

638
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,139
Is that a weekday?

639
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:53,519
I think it's a Thursday.

640
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:58,190
So you wanna take a 12-year-old girl to
a Pearl Jam concert on a school night?

641
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:04,488
I just thought it would be something
nice that she and I could do together.

642
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:06,406
It's ridiculous!

643
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,824
She's too young.

644
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:45,571
It spread?

645
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:47,155
But I did...

646
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,993
I did everything right!
Everything I was supposed to do.

647
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:55,038
We found some cells in your
lymph nodes. In three of them.

648
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,335
But you said the last time
that you got it all.

649
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:01,753
So If you were wrong
in the last time...

650
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,213
than there's a good chance
you're wrong this time...

651
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:06,884
...because the last time...
- Last time... was a year ago.

652
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:10,679
We found a tiny lump, we treated
it. We thought we got it all.

653
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:13,557
We were hopeful, but there
were no guarantees.

654
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,729
But people...
You...

655
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:22,608
We can beat it. I mean,
people beat it all the time, right?

656
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:25,569
- Every day, more and more.
- Ok! So, what's the plan?

657
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:28,197
What do we do?
Another round of radiation?

658
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,450
Chemotherapy.

659
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:34,995
That's necessary?

660
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:38,957
Let's give it
our best shot.

661
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:42,836
Right. Okay.

662
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:45,881
Excuse me. I got
to get the kids.

663
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:48,258
We'll discuss this at
your next appointment.

664
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:51,470
And you should share this
with your kids and ex-husband.

665
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:54,598
How would his worrying or my
kids worrying make any difference?

666
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,308
Sooner than later...

667
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,852
...you need to.

668
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:02,022
- Jackie!
- Ok.

669
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:04,024
- Think about it.
- Ok.

670
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:22,459
I see her.

671
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:29,424
- Hi.
- Hi.

672
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:32,177
- How are you?
- Thanks for coming.

673
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:34,972
You're welcome.
You look pretty!

674
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:36,431
Thanks.

675
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:39,852
Listen...

676
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:43,230
I'm glad you called, 'cause there's
something I wanna tell you too.

677
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:45,566
Oh! Ok.
Well, you go first.

678
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:47,484
Let me have a drink here.

679
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:58,078
I'm going to ask Isabel...

680
00:42:58,161 --> 00:42:59,663
...to marry me.

681
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:08,797
I know you don't
think much of her.

682
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,050
She's a special person.

683
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:14,178
She really is, Jackie.

684
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:19,057
Why are you
telling me this?

685
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:20,893
I want you to tell me
that it's ok.

686
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:23,228
- You don't need my approval.
- The kids do.

687
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:25,063
Good evening.

688
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:26,773
Would you and your wife
care to look at the menu?

689
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:28,442
I'm not his wife.

690
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:30,319
No, thank you.

691
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:35,073
Give me a drink though,
please. Whatever this is.

692
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:40,370
I think it's going to be
hard for the kids.

693
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:43,749
And I was hoping we
could tell them together.

694
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,627
And that would make it easier
for the kids? Or for you?

695
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:49,671
Because you know, you can't just
decide to be a "we" and "us"...

696
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:51,298
...whenever it's
convenient for you.

697
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,509
- We are...
- No, we're over. We are over.

698
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,470
We are still their parents
for the next 100 years.

699
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:14,613
Why?

700
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:20,035
Just tell me why you
think this marriage...

701
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,622
...is going to work
and ours didn't.

702
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:47,020
- What did you want to talk to me about?
- Nothing. It's...

703
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:50,482
I think we have...

704
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:54,903
...quite enough to deal with
just with your news.

705
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:16,091
Good morning.

706
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:17,885
Good morning, baby.

707
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:21,597
I've got something for you.

708
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,056
You do?

709
00:45:26,852 --> 00:45:29,521
But you have to
wake up to get it.

710
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:46,496
I'm awake.

711
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,689
You shouldn't have?

712
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,736
The first time
I got married...

713
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:20,280
...we'd been together
since college.

714
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:22,950
Marriage...

715
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:25,452
...just seemed like
the next step.

716
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:29,206
It was just something
that happened.

717
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:33,794
But I think for two people
to really love each other...

718
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:38,048
...to really commit
to each other...

719
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:40,092
...it has to be...

720
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:44,388
...it has to be
an act of will.

721
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:47,266
Or a decision.

722
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:52,229
And I think two people have
to live that decision every day.

723
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:57,359
Even when things are hard
and you feel like giving up...

724
00:46:57,651 --> 00:46:59,111
...you have to...

725
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:02,531
...hang on to that decision...

726
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:07,703
...that choice to...

727
00:47:07,786 --> 00:47:10,205
...to love each other.

728
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:12,708
Even if it's only
by a thread.

729
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:17,087
I...

730
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:19,882
...let that thread
break once.

731
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:23,218
This time, it won't.

732
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,272
Will you marry me?

733
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:36,273
Yes.

734
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:37,983
Yes, I will.

735
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:53,207
- Sweetheart, don't get upset.
- I'm not upset. Why would I be upset?

736
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:56,752
I mean... No one asked me
when you got a divorce.

737
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:58,921
No one asked me if
I wanted a new mother.

738
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,632
No one even asked
me if I liked her.

739
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:05,010
If you guys don't care about keeping
our family together, then why should I?

740
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:08,722
Anna, daddy and I tried
very hard. Really, we did!

741
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:11,767
No, you didn't! All you did
was name-call. I heard you.

742
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,103
You didn't even try
to use real words.

743
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:21,443
Baby, Isabel's not going to
take my place as your mom!

744
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:27,074
It's just that Isabel's going
to be in your life and...

745
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:29,701
...hopefully, you can
learn to accept her.

746
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:36,583
Sweetheart.

747
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:39,545
Honey.

748
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:45,133
You know, life is
full of hard things!

749
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:48,428
And sometimes it
isn't fair, and...

750
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:50,013
But you know
you have a choice.

751
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:54,476
You can either take the hard things
and make your life better, or...

752
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,436
...or you can make it worse.

753
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,146
Like how?

754
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:03,777
Like...

755
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:07,739
...trying to see the
good side of Isabel, and...

756
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:11,243
...what she brings to
your father's life, and...

757
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:12,953
...to yours!

758
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:16,456
You know, there comes
a time in every family...

759
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:19,209
...when you've got to be
there for each other.

760
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:24,339
I'll be there for you.

761
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,385
How about you, buddy?

762
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:30,679
Yeah.

763
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:32,723
You'll be there?

764
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:47,571
Damn it!

765
00:49:57,414 --> 00:49:58,540
What's the problem?

766
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:01,627
Nothing.

767
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:12,721
It looks good!

768
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:15,140
I can't get the
trees to look real.

769
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:19,645
Mind if I try?

770
00:50:21,522 --> 00:50:23,815
I already messed
it up anyway.

771
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:27,945
Let's see...

772
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:30,739
First a little
brush smooshing.

773
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:32,658
"Smooshing."

774
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,576
Very technical term.

775
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:52,636
Cool! Where'd you
learn how to do that?

776
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:55,681
I took an art class
when I was at NYU.

777
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:01,144
Why don't you
give it a try?

778
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:06,149
It helps if you
make that little...

779
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:18,453
Thanks.

780
00:51:20,163 --> 00:51:21,248
You're welcome.

781
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:34,469
I was thinking about what
you said about Isabel.

782
00:51:34,553 --> 00:51:36,805
You know, seeing the
good side of her, and...

783
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:38,682
You know, you're right!

784
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:41,018
She knows all about
clothes and stuff, and...

785
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:43,770
...she knows every rock
and roll song ever written.

786
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:47,107
I mean... She's kind
like a kid herself.

787
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:49,568
- Like a big sister.
- Yeah!

788
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:52,321
She knows the cool
junk food places to eat at.

789
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:54,114
I'll bet!

790
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:56,825
Once you get to know
her, she's kind of cool.

791
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:03,415
But don't tell her
I told you, I...

792
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:05,792
- I just...
- It's our secret.

793
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:08,045
Thanks.

794
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:11,048
Ben, wait up!

795
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:16,280
Did you have a good day?

796
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,699
You're one lucky boy
because... guess what?

797
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:22,202
You get to watch a tape tonight.
I'm going out. Colleen's baby-sitting.

798
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:23,579
Yeah! Cool!

799
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:24,997
And you...

800
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,832
...are wearing make-up.

801
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,918
Well, no.
Isabel gave it to me.

802
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:34,256
No, she just put a little on in
the car, playing around.

803
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:40,429
You don't usually see that color in the
afternoon, except on working girls.

804
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:42,472
Anyway...

805
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:44,183
...wash your face, because...

806
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:46,185
...you and I are going
out in 10 minutes.

807
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:48,187
On a school night?

808
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:50,898
Pearl Jam?!

809
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,903
- Oh mom, you are the coolest!
- You only live once, right?

810
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:58,822
Isn't my mom the coolest?

811
00:54:02,284 --> 00:54:04,119
It was a great idea.
Thanks.

812
00:54:06,163 --> 00:54:07,331
Have fun.

813
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:22,179
Chemotherapy. There's
a day's dose stored here.

814
00:54:22,262 --> 00:54:25,015
This is a portable IV. Feel it.

815
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:27,392
It's pretty light.

816
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:29,811
Yeah, nice and slim. You can
wear it everywhere...

817
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:31,730
...playing tennis, jogging...

818
00:54:31,813 --> 00:54:34,483
- You can hide it right under your clothes.
- That's cool.

819
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:37,861
Side effects?

820
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:41,990
Some days you'll experience
drowsiness, nausea...

821
00:54:42,074 --> 00:54:44,535
...and another days
you'll feel perfectly fine.

822
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:48,080
Am I going to
lose my hair?

823
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:48,830
Maybe.

824
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:52,000
Maybe not. It varies
with each person.

825
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:55,212
Let's do it!

826
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:56,380
Good.

827
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:58,006
When?

828
00:54:59,258 --> 00:55:01,718
I'm available
tomorrow evening.

829
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:04,555
Oh, tomorrow evening is bad.
It's spaghetti and meatball night.

830
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:06,098
Ben really looks forward...

831
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:09,059
Okay, tomorrow's
good! Fine.

832
00:55:19,528 --> 00:55:21,572
Hi, honey.
How you doing?

833
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:24,533
Mom, I've been
waiting for your call!

834
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:27,119
- Mom, you're not gonna believe it!
- What?

835
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:30,205
- I'm telepathetic!
- You mean, telepathic?

836
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:32,082
That's what I said.

837
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:34,084
I just discovered it today.

838
00:55:34,168 --> 00:55:36,128
I can read minds.

839
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:37,421
No way.

840
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:40,716
Yeah, I just tried it with Dad
and Isabel, and guess what?

841
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,050
What?

842
00:55:42,134 --> 00:55:45,345
I always knew exactly
what they were thinking!

843
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:47,222
That is incredible.

844
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:49,266
- Want me to read yours?
- Absolutely.

845
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:52,853
- Think real hard about something.
- I'm thinking.

846
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:54,897
- Close your eyes.
- Ok.

847
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:58,317
Concentrate.

848
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,110
I am concentrating.

849
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:05,490
You're thinking
about... me!

850
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:09,620
That is amazing!

851
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:11,371
What else?

852
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:15,250
And you're wishing you were
here instead of where you are.

853
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:18,086
That's for sure.

854
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,464
Where are you, anyway?

855
00:56:20,547 --> 00:56:23,383
I'm in bed, with the flu...

856
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:25,928
...and I'm green
and barfing.

857
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:27,387
I knew that.

858
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,390
And you're wishing you were
here making me spaghetti...

859
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:33,727
...so I wouldn't have to eat
Daddy's sucky lamb chop.

860
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:35,395
You're right about that.

861
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:38,232
- See? I'm pathatelic!
- Telepathic!

862
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:40,442
That's what I said.

863
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:46,448
- When am I going to see you?
- Tomorrow after school.

864
00:56:47,783 --> 00:56:49,993
I was wishing I'd
see you tonight.

865
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,705
Well, we'll just
gonna have...

866
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:56,375
...to have one of our dream
dates and meet somewhere special.

867
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,584
In our dreams!

868
00:56:57,668 --> 00:57:01,296
Where haven't we been in a
while? How about Disneyland?

869
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,632
No... last time, the
lines were too long.

870
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:07,636
The beach.

871
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,097
Yeah!

872
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,432
On a hot summer day.

873
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:15,269
With gigantic waves.

874
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:16,937
And boogie boards.

875
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,897
And corn dogs.

876
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:20,482
Awesome.

877
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:25,112
Cool. All right, now don't forget
to put on your sunblock, okay?

878
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:28,740
It's a dream, mom.
You don't need sunblock.

879
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:31,869
That's right. I forgot!

880
00:57:33,996 --> 00:57:36,665
- Mommy, you still there?
- Yeah.

881
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:38,417
Ben? Time for dinner.

882
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,377
I got to go.
See you tonight, okay?

883
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,045
All right.

884
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:44,381
- I'll see you in my dreams!
- Bye, mom.

885
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:46,049
- Bye.
- I love you.

886
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:12,618
She doesn't have that
killer instinct, does she?

887
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,536
Defense, fall back!

888
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:35,140
You feeling all right?

889
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:37,434
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm great.

890
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:39,353
You look a bit tired.

891
00:58:39,436 --> 00:58:44,274
I hate when people say that. It's a
polite way of telling you look like shit.

892
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:45,817
I didn't mean it like that.

893
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:48,946
I just have some
things on my mind.

894
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:56,328
You've been
really busy lately.

895
00:58:58,455 --> 00:59:00,249
Are you...

896
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:02,000
...seeing somebody?

897
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,632
No. I wish that was the
reason I was tired. I...

898
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:14,513
I've been spending a little
time with my old boss...

899
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:18,183
...trying to decide whether or not
I'll go back to Random House.

900
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:20,227
Really?
That would be great!

901
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:23,355
Oh, Ben.
Easy, easy, easy.

902
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,485
Ben, Ben, be
careful, sweetie.

903
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:31,488
You're a dead guy,
Captain Blood!

904
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:45,544
Ben, that was
really cool.

905
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:47,880
- Sweetie, can you move your leg?
- Yeah.

906
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:49,256
- Does it hurt?
- No.

907
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:50,716
Are you okay?

908
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:54,636
Yeah, but can I still go to
Tucker's party tomorrow?

909
00:59:56,513 --> 00:59:59,516
Probably. But we gotta get it cleaned
up, and have somebody to look at it, ok?

910
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,810
We'll go to the
emergency room.

911
01:00:13,906 --> 01:00:15,782
- Five stitches.
- Is he okay?

912
01:00:15,866 --> 01:00:17,826
- Yeah, he's doing fine.
- He's not crying?

913
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:21,455
- Can I see my son now, please?
- I need your insurance information.

914
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:22,831
I'll do this.

915
01:00:22,915 --> 01:00:24,750
He's in 152.

916
01:00:30,923 --> 01:00:34,092
- I don't see any broken bones.
- 'Cause you don't have any.

917
01:00:34,176 --> 01:00:37,554
And I'm very proud of you.
You were awfully brave today.

918
01:00:37,638 --> 01:00:38,931
It didn't hurt that bad.

919
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:42,142
Besides, it'll be pretty cool
to show my friends.

920
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:45,103
Hey, would you
do me a favor?

921
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:47,981
Maybe. Depends
what it is.

922
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:51,777
Will you ask Dad to give me
a white dove for Christmas?

923
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,028
We'll see.

924
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:54,154
Come on!

925
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:56,156
Every magician
needs a white dove.

926
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,950
A real one. They do!

927
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:00,160
Well, you know, hat's
a long way off...

928
01:01:00,244 --> 01:01:03,705
...and I think we should talk to
your mom and just see, okay?

929
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:06,041
Does it hurt again?

930
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:08,043
Lay back.

931
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:09,711
Take a deep breath.

932
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:15,342
Will you sing me a song?

933
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:18,178
My mom always sings
to me when I get hurt.

934
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,479
Hard to think of a
song on the spot.

935
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:36,989
If I needed you

936
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:40,284
Would you come to me

937
01:01:40,576 --> 01:01:44,121
Would you come to me

938
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:46,832
And ease my pain

939
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:50,294
If you needed me

940
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:53,922
I would come to you

941
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:57,718
I would swim the sea

942
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:01,180
For to ease your pain

943
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:05,976
- Feel better?
- Yeah.
