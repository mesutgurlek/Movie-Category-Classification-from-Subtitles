473
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:49,977
Yay, Greg!

474
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,879
I can't lose to Fregley again.

475
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:54,979
If I get beat by the weirdest kid in school,

476
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:57,547
nobody's ever gonna let me
sit at their table.

477
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:01,186
How are you going to beat him?
It's like he had superhuman strength!

478
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:04,088
I'm not gonna beat him.
I'm gonna gain 10 pounds this week

479
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:06,224
so I can move up to
the Bulldog weight class.

480
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:09,031
And then you and I can wrestle each other.

481
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,469
Ready?

482
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:12,563
- Can I throw at you now?
- Later.

483
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,837
You're better at riding than I am,
and I'm a better thrower.

484
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:17,272
(SlGHS)

485
00:28:28,923 --> 00:28:31,448
Greg, save some for everybody else,
honey.

486
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:33,494
GREG: Can't. I need to bulk up.

487
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:34,585
Why?

488
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:38,188
I think your body looks beautiful
just the way it is.

489
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:41,962
I heard he got his butt kicked at wrestling.
Now what is wrong with you?

490
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:45,403
Why would you sign up for something
you don't have to do?

491
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:47,837
You signed up for wrestling?

492
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:49,066
Kind of.

493
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,704
You never sign up for anything at school.

494
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,748
You fly below the radar.

495
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,841
That way you never raise
anyone's expectations.

496
00:28:56,918 --> 00:28:59,910
Thank you, Rodrick,
for those words of motivational wisdom,

497
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,979
but perhaps
a better way to look at it is that

498
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:05,253
it's a chance
to learn to excel at something.

499
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,625
Well, what could I learn at school
that I can't teach myself?

500
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:11,296
Well, Greg, I think it's great that

501
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:13,664
you took the initiative
to learn something new.

502
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:16,932
This is like the first step to responsibility!

503
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,566
My boss's son Will was smaller than you,

504
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:23,440
but he built himself up with the weights!

505
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,672
Yeah.
We could get you the same equipment.

506
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:30,184
You could train,
get the right nutrition, cardio.

507
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:34,113
<i>You'd be in tip-top shape just like Will.</i>

508
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:39,184
And it would only take, like, three months.

509
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:45,965
- Three months?
- Yeah.

510
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,560
I'll just stick to eating.

511
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,638
Well, I don't know
where you put it, Heffley,

512
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,236
but you gained 10 pounds
and joined the Bulldog class.

513
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:00,440
Yes.

514
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,615
I thought
you didn't gain any weight this week.

515
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:11,454
My mom's ankle weights.

516
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:17,525
All right, bulldog Heffley.
Meet your new opponent.

517
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:22,368
What? But this is boys' wrestling.

518
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,663
Ever hear of Title lX?

519
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:26,500
Her parents threatened to sue,

520
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:30,408
so you show her
what it's like to wrestle a real live boy.

(PATTY GRUNTS)

522

Come on! What you waiting for, huh?
Don't be such a wuss, Heffley.

523
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,714
- Make your move!
- She's a girl! Where do I grab her?

524
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:50,524
- Stay down!
- ANGlE: Patty, over here!

525
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:57,371
- Get off of me!
- Can I wrestle somebody good now?

(ALL LAUGHlNG)

527
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:09,981
Well, look who's in the paper.

528
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:15,845
Greg! You're famous!
Right on the front page!

529
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,666
And if I would have pinned her,
which I could have done easily,

530
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:30,226
you know I would have gotten in trouble
for hurting a girl.

531
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,569
Why does she even want to wrestle?

532
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,767
Who knows? Girls are very confusing.

533
00:31:34,842 --> 00:31:36,400
Like today,
I heard someone in the hallway say

534
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:40,470
that Bryce Anderson has a cute butt.
What does that even mean?

535
00:31:40,548 --> 00:31:42,982
A butt can't be cute. It's a butt.

536
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:46,212
I know, but that's what they were saying.

537
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,154
I don't see why girls our age
can't talk just like regular people.

538
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:57,955
So how are you gonna become
a class favorite now?

539
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:01,729
- Two words. Best Dressed.
- How are you going to do that?

540
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:05,802
Fashion is easy. You wear a shirt
and a tie, and kids are impressed.

541

Why would they put on two straps

two kids who were, I don't know,

00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,959
maybe in middle school,

they trick-or-treated at that house
on Halloween night.

But the house was full of devil worshipers

642
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,443
who put the kids
in these giant pizza ovens.

643
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:26,985
And they cooked them and they ate them.

644
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:30,289
But they forgot to turn off the ovens.

645
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:33,623
So the house burned down
with everyone in it.

How'd the trees get there?

MR. WlNSKY: I just took a call
from a Mrs. Irvine

930
00:56:58,959 --> 00:57:01,621
about what happened
to the kindergarteners last week.

931
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:04,459
She was very upset. And so am l.

932
00:57:05,332 --> 00:57:08,426
- What?
- You violated the sacred trust.

933
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:10,932
This...

934
00:57:13,307 --> 00:57:17,243
This badge is supposed to mean
something, and you just spat on it.

935
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,336
I can barely even look at you.

936
00:57:19,413 --> 00:57:21,745
- I really don't...
- Just save it.

937
00:57:21,949 --> 00:57:25,043
You are officially suspended
from Safety Patrol.

938
00:57:25,486 --> 00:57:28,751
And I expect a full apology
to the kindergarteners.

939
00:57:29,556 --> 00:57:30,853
Yes, sir.

940
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:44,204
- Hey. What did he have to say?
- I'm kicked off.

941
00:57:44,772 --> 00:57:46,933
I don't even know what he's talking about.

942
00:57:50,077 --> 00:57:51,305
Rowley?

943
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,349
- What?
- Nothing.

944
00:58:12,533 --> 00:58:16,560
You've been home for an hour
and haven't badgered me for any snacks.

945
00:58:16,637 --> 00:58:18,434
Are you feeling okay?

946
00:58:19,673 --> 00:58:23,370
Well, I'm kind of in a tough situation.

947
00:58:24,311 --> 00:58:25,903
I know something

948
00:58:25,979 --> 00:58:29,073
and if I tell the truth about it,
it could hurt somebody.

949
00:58:29,149 --> 00:58:32,277
But if I don't, it could hurt somebody else.

950
00:58:32,352 --> 00:58:37,688
Well, you have to trust your gut
and try to do the right thing,

951
00:58:39,293 --> 00:58:43,957
because it's our choices
that make us who we are.

952
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:47,659
Okay.

953
00:58:51,605 --> 00:58:53,038
<i>GREG: I was up all night,
tossing and turning,</i>

954
00:58:53,107 --> 00:58:55,507
<i>thinking about my mom 's advice.</i>

955
00:58:55,576 --> 00:58:58,511
<i>And I finally decided to do the right thing.</i>

956
00:58:59,813 --> 00:59:02,509
I'm sorry I terrorized you, children.

957
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,410
What?

958
00:59:05,152 --> 00:59:08,553
<i>I decided to let Rowley
take one for the team.</i>

959
00:59:11,759 --> 00:59:15,923
<i>But I'm not entirely sure
that was the right call.</i>

960
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:25,938
Hey, how's it going?

961
00:59:26,006 --> 00:59:30,067
Well, I was pretty upset
about being suspended from Safety Patrol,

962
00:59:30,144 --> 00:59:34,205
but then I just started drawing a bunch
of Zoo-wee Mamas and I felt better.

963
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:37,250
Look. I put you in this week's cartoon.

964
00:59:37,384 --> 00:59:40,182
And you even get to say,
"Zoo-wee Mama."

965
00:59:40,788 --> 00:59:43,313
Wow. That's really

966
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,420
nice.

967
00:59:48,729 --> 00:59:50,594
So, listen.

968
00:59:50,664 --> 00:59:54,191
It's kind of funny, you know,
the whole Safety Patrol thing.

969
00:59:54,268 --> 00:59:55,360
Yeah?

970
00:59:56,036 --> 00:59:57,867
Ready for the funny part?

971
00:59:57,938 --> 01:00:01,339
Well, I'm the one
who terrorized those kids!

972
01:00:04,178 --> 01:00:05,941
- What?
- Yeah,

973
01:00:06,013 --> 01:00:08,880
and I think we can both learn
some valuable lessons from this.

974
01:00:08,949 --> 01:00:13,318
Like, I should be more careful what I do
in front of Mrs. Irvine's house.

975
01:00:13,387 --> 01:00:15,446
And you, well,

976
01:00:16,557 --> 01:00:18,923
you should be more careful
who you lend your coat to.

977
01:00:22,429 --> 01:00:25,921
You know what, Greg?
You're not a good friend.

978
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:30,593
Whoa. How could you even say that?
I'm a great friend.

979
01:00:30,671 --> 01:00:33,834
If you were a great friend,
you would have told Mr. Winsky the truth.

980
01:00:33,907 --> 01:00:36,637
Okay, one thing.
You can't get mad about just...

981
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:39,304
You only care about yourself.

982
01:00:39,646 --> 01:00:41,546
You hated my cartoon.

983
01:00:42,616 --> 01:00:46,313
You made fun of my clothes.
You disrespected Joshie.

984
01:00:46,553 --> 01:00:49,989
You broke my hand
and you didn't even seem sorry.

985
01:00:50,057 --> 01:00:52,753
That broken hand was the best thing
that ever happened to you!

986
01:00:54,528 --> 01:00:56,155
Don't call me.

987
01:00:56,864 --> 01:01:00,197
Don't come by my house. We're done.

the silent treatment.</i>

at him, I didn't know what to say.

992

MR. WlNSKY: One of the kindergarteners
finally told their parents the whole story.

duties, effective immediately.
