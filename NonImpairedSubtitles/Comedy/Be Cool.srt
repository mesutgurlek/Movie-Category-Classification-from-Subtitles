0
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,602
Sequels.

1
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,106
It's the only time I gave in in my life.

2
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,339
But sometimes,
you gotta do it the studio way.

3
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,711
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:49,908
<i>- Get Lost?</i>
- Yeah.

5
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,245
I thought the first one
was pretty good.

6
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,150
<i>- Get Leo?</i>
- Terrific picture. Terrific!

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,619
And you know what else?

8
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:56,677
It was good.

9
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,314
You know what I'm thinking, Tommy?

10
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,552
I'm thinking of getting out
of the movie business.

11
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,390
Go back to my old job.

12
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,622
- What, being a shylock?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:04,788
Why?

14
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,263
'Cause at least they're honest
about being dishonest.

15
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:09,096
Come on. Why would you
wanna leave all this?

16
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:10,964
Hello!

17
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,536
See? I'm telling you, this town.

18
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,440
Look, Chil.

19
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,502
You and me, we come out
to Hollywood, sniff the air,

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,604
and now look at us, man.

21
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,581
We made it!
And you know why?

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,618
'Cause we knew how to hustle a deal.

23
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,279
Yeah, like I got hustled
into doing the sequel.

24
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,322
That sucks.

25
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,620
Do you know that unless
you're willing to use the R rating,

26
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,523
you can only say the F-word once?

27
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,891
- You're kiddin' me.
- No.

28
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,021
You know what I say?
Fuck that.

29
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,258
I'm done.

30
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,866
Before you skate out of the business,

31
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,630
I got a movie for you.

32
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,034
Oh, yeah? What?

33
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,335
About NTL.

34
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,999
What's NTL?

35
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,007
"What's NTL?"
What, are you joking?

36
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,807
- No.
- You're pulling my chain.

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,848
Nothing To Lose Records.
Hello. Come on.

38
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,315
It's, like, <i>the</i> indie label.

39
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,717
I sign bands, I produce their albums,
I sell the distribution to the majors.

40
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,723
- Now you wanna make movies?
- Yeah! Who doesn't?

41
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,123
All right, can you pitch it
in 25 words or less?

42
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,491
I can do it in one word... Me!

43
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,190
- You?
- Me! Hello! Me!

44
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,857
I couldn't get your mother
to watch that movie.

45
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,128
My life in the music business.

46
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,933
Come on! Gangsta rappers,
the Russian mafia, you know?

47
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,530
All that goddamn payola crap.

48
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,803
This place is
like the wild, wild west, man.

49
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,674
You're dodgin' the bullets,
you're taking the arrows.

50
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,940
And it's got a girl.

51
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,675
There always is.

52
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:30,841
Her name's Linda Moon.

53
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,078
She plays a girl who wants to
make it big in the biz,

54
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,088
and I am the record mogul
who makes it happen.

55
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,214
Anyway, it's a musical,

56
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,281
and Linda's been trying to get me
on the two-way ever since,

57
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,327
you know, she saw you
on <i>Charlie Rose.</i>

58
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,420
Where you were very smooth,
and found out that I knew you.

59
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,987
I said you would help her out,

60
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,863
and she left you on the list
at the Viper Room

61
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,425
expecting you to show up.

62
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,665
So, Tommy, how's your wife?

63
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,728
- Edie?
- Yeah.

64
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:54,795
Who gives a shit?

65
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,102
Don't be a buzzkill.

66
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,141
Where are you goin'?

67
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,703
I gotta go to the men's.
I just had two iced teas.

68
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,113
But how about... Hey, Chili,
how does the movie sound?

69
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,583
Well, you don't have a movie yet.

70
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,179
You've got a premise and a setting,
but you don't have character arcs or a plot.

71
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,019
Okay, but still. You know.

72
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,355
Hey, who's gonna play me?
Think about that.

73
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,190
How about Carrot Top?

74
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,300
<i>Do svidanhiya.</i>

75
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,010
Hey, Marla.
Long time no see.

76
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,203
Yeah.

77
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,576
How's organized crime treatin' ya?

78
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,080
A little more exciting now
that you're in town.

79
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,172
Oh, yeah?

80
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,241
So, Mr. Palmer, we've got reason
to believe that this was a mob hit.

81
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,449
Trust me, if this were a mob hit, they'd
have hired a man who knew how to shoot.

82
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,484
He hit him in the chest.

83
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,718
Finally.

84
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,226
After he shot up my Caddy.

85
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,284
What a shame.

86
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,229
Can you confirm that this fella was
wearing a toupee?

87
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,029
Stevie Wonder could confirm
that he was wearing a toupee.

88
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,498
So out of the blue, this Mr. Athens
just decides to look up your number

89
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,799
and give you a call?

90
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:07,999
I know what you're gettin' at, Marla.

91
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,405
You think I set him up.

92
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,239
The truth is Tommy wanted me
to do a movie about him.

93
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,711
But you can't do a movie

94
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,772
where the main character gets popped
in the first scene, now, can you?

95
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,444
Yeah. It's not a bad opening.

96
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,388
You know, you're right.
That worked for <i>American Beauty.</i>

97
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,522
<i>Sunset Boulevard.</i>

98
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:26,819
Or <i>Casino.</i>

99
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:29,986
Mr. Palmer.

100
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,258
I'm Glenn from Thrifty Executive Fleet.

101
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,300
May I escort you to your vehicle?

102
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,595
But of course.

103
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,726
Marla.

104
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,270
Detective.

105
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,773
There you go, sir.

106
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,442
W hat's that?

107
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,516
I asked for a Cadillac.

108
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,680
The Insight is the Cadillac
of gas-electric hybrid cars.

109
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,692
Not only is it fuel-efficient,
it's great for the environment.

110
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,450
- I got it.
- Thanks.

111
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,586
- Hey, Martin.
- Chili!

112
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,251
- How are you doin'?
- How are you doin', Chil?

113
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,693
- Good to see you, Martin.
- Good to see you.

114
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,855
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

115
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,954
You know Hy Gordon?

116
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,623
What's up, Chili Palmer?

117
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,300
He did the soundtrack for <i>Get Lost.</i>

118
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,632
What's up, man?

119
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,728
Sorry.

120
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,239
Hy's taking me around.
I'm doing a little research.

121
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,832
For my next part.
I'm gonna play Johnny.

122
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,007
The Man In Black.
Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.

123
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,514
- Oh, Johnny Cash.
- Yeah!

124
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,278
- But he's like six-feet-something.
- That's okay.

125
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,411
You don't... You know, low angles.

126
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,455
You know, the movies?

127
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,054
Hey, Chili, is that your car?

128
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,390
Yeah, it's an Insight.
It's the Cadillac of hybrids.

129
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,692
It's a little tight for a big guy like you.

130
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,096
Small price to pay
for the environment.

131
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,294
Fifty-seven miles to the gallon.

132
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,802
But what about speed?

133
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,064
No, Martin.

134
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,299
If you're important, people will wait.

135
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,363
Just one shot, Marty.

136
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,376
Marty, one smile for me, come on.

137
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,810
My love, yeah

138
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,280
You've got the best of my love

139
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,807
Demonstrated love and affection

140
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,619
That you give so openly, yeah

141
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,718
The way I feel about you, babe,
I can't explain it

142
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,629
Want the whole wide world
to see that

143
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,668
Oh, but in my heart

144
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,498
You're all I need

145
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:56,039
You for me and me for you

146
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,313
It's growing every day

147
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,858
You've got the best of me, yeah

148
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,294
You've got the best of my love

149
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,628
You got me, yeah

150
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,863
Givin' you the best of my love

151
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,997
You've got the best of my love

152
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,476
Givin' you the best of my love

153
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,144
You've got the best of my love

154
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,593
That's true.

155
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,495
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's what it's about.

156
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,659
You have to let it go halfway.
You can't be always tryin' so damn hard.

157
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,202
- Linda.
- Yo!

158
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,931
- Yo, I ain't sellin' that.
- Raji, no, I...

159
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,565
That ain't sexy. You better go
put your chick shit back on.

160
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,472
I can't put that on right now.
I have a meeting.

161
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,874
I'm telling you, there's people out here
paid to come see this shit.

162
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,036
Give me one second.

163
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,143
Baby, I just told you
to put your clothes on, didn't I?

164
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,912
- I can't!
- Did I not tell you that?

165
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,476
- Look!
- Don't "look" me again!

166
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,656
- Mr. Palmer?
- Call me Chili.

167
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,389
- It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

168
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,760
Please, have a seat.

169
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,357
- Can I get you something to drink?
- I have something coming.

170
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,663
- So, Tommy's gone?
- Yeah.

171
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,705
I can't believe it.

172
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,473
I guess this means
you're not doing the movie?

173
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,137
Well, I gotta be honest
with you, Linda.

174
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,181
I'm getting out of the movie business.

175
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,341
Here you go.

176
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,517
What's the matter?

177
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,416
I'm tired of this, Mr. Palmer.

178
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,856
Look, if I can get some cash,

179
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:58,090
I would buy my way out of my contract
and get out of music.

180
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,724
Are you kidding?
After what I just saw?

181
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,428
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it sucks.

182
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,370
Look, I could do the same thing topless
and make $2,000 a week with tips.

183
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,737
Well, why don't you do that?

184
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,606
I'm Baptist.
My father wouldn't approve.

185
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,702
So then you're like Aretha Franklin.

186
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,838
You learned to sing in church.

187
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,650
I learned from my father.

188
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,516
My dad was in a jazz band.
Nothing big, though.

189
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:26,690
See, everything I know about music
I learned from him.

190
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,525
I always thought we'd play together,
but then...

191
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,362
...then he died, so...

192
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,528
Yo, Linda! Yo!

193
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,194
I didn't dismiss you.

194
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,862
You're on my time.

195
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,506
That's my manager Raji
with Miss Bangkok.

196
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,575
I told him I want to quit

197
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,741
and he's, like, "You quit me, girl,
I'm gonna jack you up."

198
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,013
He talks like that?

199
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,819
He thinks he's black.
His real name is Roger Lowenthal.

200
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,325
He's partners with this guy
named Nick Carr.

201
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,226
He's this music promoter?

202
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,453
I know Nicky.

203
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,762
They caught me
straight off the bus from Texas.

204
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,361
Said they'd make me this big star
and like a fool, I believed 'em.

205
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,405
When you done turnin' tricks,

206
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,135
get your ass back over here!

207
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,904
I ain't done with you yet!

208
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,607
Look, I can't do five more years.

209
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,674
Not with these guys.

210
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,582
Who's the big guy?

211
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,213
That's Elliot Wihelm,
Raji's bodyguard.

212
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,122
He's got this thing
that he can raise one eyebrow,

213
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,557
give you that look.

214
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,851
He wants to be in movies.

215
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,293
What, that's it?
He just does the one eyebrow?

216
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,356
As far as I know, he's gay, too.

217
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,835
Word is he once threw a guy out of
a 30-story building for calling him a fag.

218
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,169
Well, he must've been mad.

219
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,642
Maybe if you didn't blow
all your energy bangin' tourists,

220
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,737
your voice wouldn't sound so flat.

221
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,278
Talkin' about a flat voice,
you know what I'm sayin'?

222
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,782
Yeah, that one was for me,
so you just relax.

223
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,621
You're gonna end up doing
fifty-cent lap dances at the First King

224
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,024
like Miss Bangkok.

225
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,426
Chil, wait.

226
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,021
You don't know these guys.
They're bad guys.

227
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,431
Trust me, Linda, I know 'em
a whole lot better than you do.

228
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,867
...doin' some ass-poppin'
all up and down a pole.

229
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,235
You'd be up in that place
goin' pop, pop, pop.

230
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,295
Pop, pop, pop.

231
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,431
What are you gonna say?

232
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,238
Nothing more than I have to, if that.

233
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,573
Ass-poppin'.

234
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,340
Snap, crackle, pop!

235
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,581
Chili, wait.

236
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,149
Man in the suit.

237
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,156
You in town
for some kind of convention?

238
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,790
No, but if I was,
you'd be the man to see, am I right?

239
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,163
Why would you say
somethin' stupid like that?

240
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,793
The way you're dressed,
you're either a pimp or a limo driver.

241
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,630
We've got jokes?

242
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,269
You some kind of weak-ass comedian?

243
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,275
Raji, look at me.

244
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,401
I'm lookin' at you, man.

245
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,640
You say you're looking at me,
but are you really looking at me?

246
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,474
I'm really lookin' at you.

247
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,849
You got somethin' stupid to say?

248
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,388
Say it, so I can be done with you.

249
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,445
Linda's quit.

250
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,549
- She's out of the Chicks.
- Man, miss me with that.

251
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,321
She's got five years left
on her contract.

252
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,588
Well, I just cancelled it.

253
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,425
You come walkin' out of the dark.

254
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,930
Who you supposed to be?

255
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,191
I'm the one settin' you straight.

256
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,997
I'm Linda's new manager.

257
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,331
Come on, honey.

258
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,273
- Elliot, light his ass up.
- Got it.

259
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,532
You're Elliot Wihelm, aren't you?
You're an actor.

260
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,736
Yeah.

261
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,337
I'm sorry. Chili Palmer.

262
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,403
I'm a producer.

263
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,915
I did the film <i>Get Leo.</i>
Do you remember?

264
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,974
Sure, yeah.
It's great to meet you.

265
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,849
You know, I walk into a club,
and I see a guy like you,

266
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,685
and I say, "He's got the look.
But does he have the talent?

267
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,088
Can he act?"

268
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,452
Watch this.

269
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,333
Elliot! Elliot!

270
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,831
Goddamn, what you doin', man?

271
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:58,927
What?

272
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,742
Breathe. Up. Up.

273
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,936
You okay?

274
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,342
Yeah.

275
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,710
You can do better than him.

276
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,409
Why don't you send me
some pictures, I'll give you a call,

277
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,950
set you up for an audition.

278
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,952
All right, I'm in the Will Smith building.

279
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,587
Linda, you better talk to me.

280
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,884
Good day.

281
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,289
It's like that, huh?

282
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,519
Okay.

283
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,755
Okay!

284
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,190
I got an audition, Raj.

285
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,133
I need to get my headshots.

286
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,853
Edie?

287
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,661
Chili? Is that you?

288
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:38,828
Yeah.

289
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:39,893
Man!

290
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,735
So glad you came.

291
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,777
Well, I'm sorry,
and if there's anything I can do...

292
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,636
Thanks.

293
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,839
So, how are you doing?

294
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,752
You know.

295
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,188
You were right there
when it happened, weren't you?

296
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,782
Well, I was in the men's.

297
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,654
But you were with him
in his last hour, right?

298
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:11,730
I... I've had him cremated,

299
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,934
and I wanted to do something special
with his ashes, you know.

300
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,373
Maybe something he'd like.

301
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,377
Do you got any ideas?

302
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,909
Well, nothing that makes sense.

303
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:31,219
Say, Edie, is that
an Aerosmith tattoo on your back?

304
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,316
Yeah.

305
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,553
You know I followed them
on tour, right?

306
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,417
I didn't know that.

307
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,929
I thought Joe Perry was so hot.

308
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,831
Yeah?
So you were a groupie?

309
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,425
No, man, much worse.
I did their laundry.

310
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,164
They travel
with their own washer and dryer.

311
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,172
I did everything
except Steven's stage clothes.

312
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,969
You know, he likes
to send those out.

313
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:57,481
So, Edie, I was thinking, you know, maybe
I could help you out with NTL Records.

314
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,451
What makes you think
I need your help?

315
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,045
Nothin'.

316
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:08,219
Look, Chili...
let me tell you somethin'.

317
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,386
I started NTL with Tommy.

318
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,451
Right.

319
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,054
- Equal partners.
- Yeah.

320
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,566
And who do you think
found the Dub MD's?

321
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,760
I did.

322
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,660
Tommy's gone.

323
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,968
And I'm devastated,
but I'm not about to roll over.

324
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,406
I can run my own label.

325
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,375
If anybody could, it's you.

326
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:28,906
Hey, Edie.

327
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,973
Why don't you get your clothes on
and let's get outta here, okay?

328
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,211
Make you feel better.

329
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,549
Besides, I wanna talk to you
about this girl Linda Moon.

330
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,919
- Linda Moon?
- Yeah. She's a singer.

331
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,480
Here, put this on.

332
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:46,959
You know, I never made it
with any of those guys from Aerosmith.

333
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,499
Yeah?

334
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,930
I played tennis
with Tom Hamilton once, though.

335
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,167
Christ.

336
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,004
I was just a girl then.

337
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,774
You'll always be a girl.

338
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,853
Chil, thank you.

339
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,159
- Who's this?
- That's Tiffany, Tommy's intern.

340
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,022
How ya doing?
What's that?

341
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,157
Pizza.

342
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,759
He means the urn, genius.

343
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,560
Tommy.

344
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,900
You know, the cops
came by NTL last night.

345
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,602
They were asking me about you.

346
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,201
Yeah? What'd you say?

347
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,838
Nothing. Just that you were
gonna make a movie about Tommy.

348
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,882
It'd have to be a short.

349
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,144
They take anything?

350
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,146
Some boxes, a few files.

351
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,781
But I think
what they were lookin' for was this.

352
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,385
Thanks.

353
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,052
Here.

354
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,824
- Where'd you get this?
- Some guy with a Russian accent.

355
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:56,890
It's NTL.

356
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,403
You know, about a month ago,
he starts coming by,

357
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,098
lookin' for Tommy.

358
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,370
Tommy's in the office, what,
like three hours a week?

359
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,037
So, this last time,
he takes a picture.

360
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,172
He comes in,
doesn't even ask for Tommy,

361
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,717
lights it on fire,

362
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,911
and just tosses it on my desk.

363
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,854
No questions, no nothing.

364
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,949
Two days later, he comes back
and this time, Tommy's in.

365
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,052
So I interrupt his meeting,
and I buzz him.

366
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,565
He comes flying out of his office,
walks up to the guy,

367
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,158
nails him right in the eye.

368
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,764
Just like that scene in <i>Get Leo.</i>

369
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,935
Then he tosses the guy on his ass
right in the middle of the street.

370
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,980
I'm like, "Tommy,
who the hell was that?"

371
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,241
Insurance salesman.

372
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:44,871
Okay.

373
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,479
An insurance salesman.

374
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,022
Insurance scam.
I mean, geez, even I know that.

375
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,556
Guy takes a picture
of your business,

376
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,252
says either you pay up
or he puts your place on fire.

377
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,524
Well, you know, Edie,
that was Tommy's specialty in Brooklyn.

378
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,791
He sold protection.

379
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,527
He could write a book
on the different ways to work it.

380
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,794
Did this guy have a toupee?

381
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,234
Not after Tommy hit him.

382
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,475
Good morning.
Carosell Entertainment.

383
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,345
You see the Chicks International?

384
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,809
I think these girls are gonna be big,
the next big act to break.

385
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,481
- Take my word for this.
- What's up, Nick?

386
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,922
I'm telling you!
This Linda Moon.

387
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,721
Is she a g-string diva or what?

388
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:29,954
They give you wood?

389
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,427
What's up, man?
I need to talk to you, Nick.

390
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,963
They give me mahogany.

391
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,020
Goddamn teak.

392
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,966
You could deck the QE 2
with the wood they gave me.

393
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,502
Who even cares if they can sing?

394
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,595
Look, man, Chili Palmer
came up in the club. I gotta...

395
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,503
You're still my bitch.
Love ya. Out.

396
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,132
Man, we gotta talk
about this Chili Palmer.

397
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,335
Robin, who's on three?

398
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,843
Robert's on three,
Marty's on four.

399
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,142
Don't be...

400
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,016
Marty, you pimp.
Make me smile.

401
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,110
Nick. Nick, for real.

402
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,121
Look, I'm serious, man.
I need to talk to you here.

403
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,453
- No. No, you did not.
- Can I talk to you for a minute, man?

404
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,886
Marty, hold on a sec, will you?

405
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,789
What do you want, Raj?

406
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,354
It says in the paper that Chili Palmer
used to be a gangster.

407
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,024
He was a hired hand.

408
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,227
You know him?

409
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,894
Tell me what you want, Raj.

410
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,338
Linda Moon says she's gonna leave
and have Chili Palmer be her manager.

411
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,705
She told you that?

412
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,107
No, man, <i>he</i> told me that.

413
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,269
What'd you do?

414
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,711
I told him she's got five years
on her contract, you know.

415
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,512
You feel you had to explain it to him?
You didn't kick his ass?

416
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,246
Man, he hit Elliot
right in the damn throat.

417
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,617
He broke him smooth down.

418
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,680
Wow. What a surprise.
Elliot's a faggot.

419
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,782
Pussy.

420
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,089
You think it's cool to have a queer
for a bodyguard?

421
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,219
What good is he?

422
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,458
Chili Palmer's no manager.

423
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,759
He's a talker.

424
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,595
You shoulda hit him in the mouth.

425
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,967
What he does is make movies
about shylocks, 'cause that's all he was.

426
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,096
A shylock.

427
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,867
That's right.
He did that movie <i>Get Lost.</i>

428
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,841
That's my shit, man.
That shit was tight.

429
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,571
There is no way
we are losing Linda Moon.

430
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,979
"A," she's under contract,
and "B," she's under contract.

431
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,176
So, what's crackin'?

432
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,879
You want Joe Loop.

433
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,217
Man, all I want is
for Chili Palmer to disappear.

434
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,883
You want Joe Loop.

435
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,565
Yeah. Joe Loop.

436
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,668
<i>Loop. Nick Carr said I should call.</i>

437
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,803
Yeah, sure.

438
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,278
<i>Well. I got something</i>
<i>for you to take care of</i>

439
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,815
<i>or do I need to call somebody else?</i>

440
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,373
No, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

441
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,249
I would love to.

442
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,197
Here's your breakfast, sweetie.

443
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,236
Pancakes again?

444
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,535
Panca... Yes, pancakes again.

445
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,066
Baby, would you tell this girl

446
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,737
when we were comin' up,
all we had was sugar sandwiches?

447
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,280
Please. She does not know
how good she has it.

448
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,044
She does not know
how good she has it.

449
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,279
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, Momy.

450
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,581
Bye, baby.

451
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,554
Deshawn, eat the pancakes, okay?

452
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,990
I put cinnamon on there,
there's butter, they're very good.

453
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,891
The strawberries are fresh.

454
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,361
Eat up.
We got ten minutes, okay?

455
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,761
I don't want you to be late.

456
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,433
Top of the morning, Marge.

457
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,770
Top of the morning, Sin.

458
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,883
Ain't this somethin'?

459
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,394
What's up, dawg?

460
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,405
Must you play into the stereotypes?

461
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,134
Turn that mess down.

462
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,470
This is the suburbs.

463
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,068
I'm on the damn Neighborhood Watch.

464
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,482
- Who did it?
- Not me.

465
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,478
You know, that bitch
owed me 300 grand.

466
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,579
I shoulda sent the coalition.

467
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,453
Now shit's gonna have to get ugly.

468
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,616
Ugly?

469
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,525
Why <i>you</i> trippin'?
It ain't like you need it.

470
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,859
Dabu, it's the principle.

471
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,923
Today it's 300 grand,
tomorrow it's three million.

472
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,729
I gotta send a message.

473
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,133
I feel ya, dawg.

474
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,895
You talk to the PD?

475
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,133
The police?

476
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,608
"The poli..."
The program director.

477
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,603
Check this out.

478
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,818
Well, hello, Mr. Program Director.

479
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,292
You see what happen
when you don't spin my records?

480
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,231
Good morning, guys!

481
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,093
Hey, y'all, speak to my daughter.

482
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,865
Good morning, Deshawn!

483
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,635
Deshawn, sweetie,
why don't you go back inside?

484
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,698
Okay?

485
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,639
Daddy's having a little meeting.

486
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,010
I'll take you to school in my car.

487
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,410
Bye, guys!

488
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,576
Good-bye, Deshawn!

489
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,142
Okay, boo-boo.

490
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,615
All right.

491
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,822
Play my records!
You hear me? Play! Play!

492
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:33,956
Play my records!

493
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,728
Play Dub Records! Dub MD's!

494
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,432
- Move yo' head. Move it.
- Stay still!

495
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:42,931
She gone?

496
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,305
I'm telling you, Edie,

497
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,970
she's got a voice,
she's got the attitude.

498
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,912
- You're gonna love her.
- Sounds like you love her.

499
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:53,417
Well, if you're asking me
if I think she's talented, yes.

500
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,718
I can't believe this.

501
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:00,690
Condolences on a two-way and
half of them are Tommy's ex-girlfriends.

502
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,055
Look, Chil, producing an album,
you know, it's not like making a movie.

503
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,155
Good.

504
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,599
I think movies are too corporate.
I like to be spontaneous and creative.

505
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,036
I'm just saying, you know,
the music biz is a bitch, you know?

506
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,005
It's dangerous.
It's rough out there.

507
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,439
Believe me, I know.

508
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,000
That's why I loved working at
MoMo's club, if you know what I mean.

509
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,804
What'd you do at MoMo's?
You book bands?

510
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,641
Not really.

511
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:28,218
- Were you a bouncer?
- Not really.

512
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,916
You really were a shylock,
weren't you?

513
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,358
Did I tell you
that she writes her own music?

514
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,932
Here she is.

515
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,370
Here we go.
You ready to show off?

516
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,570
Chili, look, I'm so sorry,
but my damn replacement didn't show up.

517
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,942
I ended up stuck in the drive-through.

518
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,241
It's all right.
Calm down, calm down.

519
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,406
Edie, Linda.

520
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:59,609
Linda, this is Edie Athens.
This is Tommy's widow.

521
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,117
Hi. Nice to meet you.

522
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:04,349
- Look, I'm really sorry about being late.
- Don't worry about it.

523
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,720
So Chili tells me
you've got a great voice.

524
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,883
Really?

525
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,153
Well, you do.

526
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,127
That is so sweet.
Thank you.

527
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,891
Is this where you play?

528
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,900
I can't really afford my own piano,
so they let me play here.

529
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,334
Come on, let's go hear you.
Yeah? Let's go.

530
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,315
Life is what you make it

531
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:17,088
At least that's what they say

532
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,722
Well, I think I'm gonna make it

533
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,790
Fulfill my dreams someday

534
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,597
I feel this fire growing

535
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,366
Deep inside of me

536
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,969
I'm so inspired knowing
that it's my destiny

537
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,946
I breathe like a champion

538
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,643
I dream like a champion

539
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,710
I see I'm a champion

540
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:45,347
It's meant to be

541
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,290
My will's getting stronger

542
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,385
I can't wait any longer

543
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:56,867
I'm singing a song
that's inside of me

544
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:02,567
'Cause I'm a believer

545
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,839
I know that I can make it
no matter what they say

546
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:14,147
'Cause I'm a believer

547
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,915
The future is now

548
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:25,020
It starts today

549
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,032
I'm impressed.

550
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,697
Did you write that song?

551
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,571
Yeah. It's called <i>I'm A Believer.</i>

552
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,202
Just tell us you got
nine more just like it.

553
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,376
Forty more.

554
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,574
But as long as I can do 'em my way.

555
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,309
I like that.

556
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,177
- Let's get you in the studio.
- All right.

557
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,551
Good girl.

558
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,715
You weren't kidding.
I mean, the girl's got something.

559
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,725
- She's amazing.
- I told you.

560
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,158
I mean, the only thing is, you know,

561
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,661
it costs a lot of money
to break someone, you know?

562
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,460
I mean, we gotta pay a mixer,
a publicist.

563
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,459
Hey, look.

564
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,470
- Steven Tyler's in town.
- Yeah.

565
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,768
Aerosmith playing
at the Staples Center.

566
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,970
Tell me <i>Dream On</i> is not the greatest
rock 'n' roll song you ever heard.

567
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,978
You know what we oughta do,
we oughta call him.

568
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,343
- Call who?
- Steven.

569
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,438
Why?

570
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,882
So he could listen to Linda's music,
he could see for himself it's terrific,

571
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,045
and maybe he'll help us launch her
at his concert.

572
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,923
- That's a great idea, Chil.
- Yeah.

573
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,891
Hey, and maybe
Bono and Sting'll come down

574
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,053
and we could all cut
a Christmas album.

575
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,653
You know him, don't you?

576
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,699
Know him? Steven Tyler.
Chili, I know his socks!

577
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,029
He's never gonna remember me.

578
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:40,502
Edie, you have a tattoo of Aerosmith
on your ass.

579
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,301
You can't get a meeting with him?

580
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:46,365
We want Steven Tyler,
we get Steven Tyler.

581
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,952
<i>I would let the music</i>
<i>do the talking to me</i>

582
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,623
<i>to tell me what lyrics to sing.</i>

583
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,964
<i>And even when I got caught up</i>
<i>in not having anything pre-written,</i>

584
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,095
<i>Which I never did. I would scat to it.</i>

585
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,204
<i>It's just the music.</i>
<i>It's the funhk.</i>

586
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,940
<i>It's the sound. It's the words.</i>
<i>It's the rhyme. It's the shit.</i>

587
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,642
<i>You can't be creative</i>
<i>unless you step outside a little bit.</i>

588
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,082
<i>It's...</i>

589
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,251
A little early, aren't you?

590
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,627
Open house is on Sunday.

591
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,740
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Hey, it's Chili Palmer.

592
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,868
<i>- Yo. Chil.</i>
- How soon can you get here?

593
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,882
2:00 A.M.
And there's traffic on the 405.

594
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,618
- Who's your friend?
- I don't know.

595
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,752
I come home and he's bleeding
all over my one-sheet.

596
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,386
Is this the guy that did Tommy Athens?

597
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,830
Nah. That guy had a black eye
and was wearing a rug.

598
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,096
This ain't no rug, pal.
This guy's got plugs.

599
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,900
I hate plugs.

600
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,633
It looks like doll's hair.

601
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,641
Personally, I think grafting's
the only way to go.

602
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,233
The look's more natural.

603
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,141
That's, of course,
'cause they use your own hair.

604
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,236
Very interesting.

605
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,473
Now are you gonna
help me out with him?

606
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,776
Is that why you called me here?

607
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,680
Yeah. You're a big guy.
I don't want to do it alone.

608
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:07,979
Come on, up.

609
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,383
Get this wallet outta here
before the cops come.

610
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,747
All right, set him down.

611
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,229
Here we go.

612
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,663
Ivan Surva...

613
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:24,696
He's Russian.

614
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,896
Been here for five months.

615
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,030
The guy that killed Tommy,
he saw you, right?

616
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,836
- Yeah.
- So you could I.D. Him.

617
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,500
Then he sees your picture
in the paper,

618
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:35,171
then he sends doll hair guy
here to take you out.

619
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,736
So while he was waiting for me,

620
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,374
he got depressed
and shot himself in the back?

621
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,042
Good point.

622
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,452
Who are all these people
trying to kill you?

623
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,452
I don't know.

624
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,518
But I'm in the music business now.
It could be anybody.

625
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,659
Mugambo, my brother,
you check out the Chicks?

626
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:03,096
I told you, bro.
This Linda Moon... she's a belter.

627
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,341
Mugambo, I gotta jump.

628
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,274
Love you, bro.

629
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,842
Get me Raji on the phone.

630
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,325
What's up?
It's Raji.

631
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,633
<i>Hey. Lowenhthal. Joe Loops</i>
<i>was supposed to kill Chili Palmer.</i>

632
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,366
<i>Instead. he killed</i>
<i>some goddamn Russian.</i>

633
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,465
For real?

634
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,534
<i>You two better work this shit out</i>
<i>or your ass is next.</i>

635
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,569
<i>Stupid-ass.</i>

636
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,315
I gotta tell you the truth.

637
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,255
I never seen a hit like this before.

638
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:58,227
I mean, you actually gotta get in line
to whack this guy.

639
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,196
How many men
have you whacked, Joe?

640
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,395
Why, you wanna be next?

641
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,430
I'm asking you
because you hit the wrong guy.

642
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,507
They serve one hell of
a stuffed cabbage here, you know that?

643
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,138
The thing that
you wanna remember though is

644
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,342
don't eat it too late
because it tends to stay with you.

645
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,009
Yeah. I'll definitely keep that in mind.

646
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,085
Where we at, Joe?

647
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,555
We ain't nowhere.

648
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,486
I now gotta go find the right guy.

649
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:34,290
The thing is it'll cost you
another five grand.

650
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,765
What are you talkin' about?
Man, I already paid you.

651
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,028
You're the one who did the wrong guy.

652
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,127
Well, whose fault is that?

653
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,838
It's your fault.

654
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,145
Tough shit.
That's the cost of doing business.

655
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,977
Look, you tell Nicky
that there's now a new contract,

656
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,846
and I need another five grand.

657
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,352
I can talk the deal with you,
'cause it's my contract, all right?

658
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,786
- That's why I'm here with you.
- You can't talk shit.

659
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,619
You're Nicky's girl.

660
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,454
Me and Nick are partners.

661
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,462
We discuss all facets
of the business together.

662
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,465
Be it music,
be it underworld, girls.

663
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,795
Let me ask you a question.

664
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,901
Nice get-up you got.

665
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,700
How come he calls you his bitch?

666
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:16,865
What?

667
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,739
His bitch.
Why does he call you his bitch?

668
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,336
What, mother...?!

669
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:22,470
Did I stutter?

670
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:27,712
What if I called you
a fat, stupid guinea bee-yatch?

671
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,884
Bee-yatch!

672
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:41,491
I'd take this baseball bat that I got
out in the back of my Cadillac,

673
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,399
and I'd swat you
across the mouth with it.

674
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:47,437
I said what <i>if</i> I called you that.

675
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,097
Hypothetically, just a scenario.

676
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,435
I wasn't actually saying it to you.

677
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,100
I'm always lookin' out.
I gotta operate.

678
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,575
I wanna make sure
I got the right guy.

679
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,407
Now I need the right guy
to get the right guy.

680
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,970
Now I want the five grand up front.

681
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,812
Tonight at the Mayan.

682
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,442
What? The what?

683
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,384
Take the wax
outta your goddamn ears.

684
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,819
The Mayan, downtown.

685
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,415
I never happen
to have heard of the Mayan,

686
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,790
so I was making sure
I knew where it was.

687
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,658
You mean there's something
you haven't heard of?

688
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,791
Okay, man.

689
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,391
All right, take off.

690
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,493
Are we cool?

691
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,338
Come on, man.

692
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,165
J. Leazy! What's up?

693
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,574
My man!

694
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,675
- All right. I feel that.
- Take off.

695
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,807
Mad respect for not giving respect.
I feel you.

696
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,178
Let me tell you something.
Don't do that "J. Leazy" shit.

697
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,551
That's what your name is.

698
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,112
I don't like that.
Don't do it.

699
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,159
I'll see you at the Mayan club, my man.

700
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,196
Mad respect to you, Loop.
Stone-face killer.

701
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,858
Next time try to find
something red to wear.

702
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,331
The future is now

703
00:37:56,407 --> 00:38:02,403
It starts today

704
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,879
How about that?

705
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,813
Yeah, that girl's voice
is off the chain.

706
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,852
But I gotta say, she needs a sound.

707
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,682
What are you saying?
That she can't sing?

708
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,019
No. Chili, that girl can totally sing.

709
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,990
- What do you mean?
- But is she a star?

710
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,027
I don't know what you're talking about.

711
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,358
Okay. Take <i>American Idol.</i> okay?

712
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,831
All those girls, they can sing, right?

713
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,595
But who cares, right?
Who are they?

714
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,502
And then you take, like, J. Lo, and it's
like that shit's been remixed so much,

715
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,198
I could be Jenny from the block.

716
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:30,968
Are you gonna produce this or not?

717
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,478
Well, leave it to Tommy.
I mean, the last of the great spenders.

718
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,035
No wonder he kept
the books locked up.

719
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,842
All right, because they're empty.

720
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,315
We don't own any of this stuff.
We're broke.

721
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,373
How can that be?

722
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,613
I mean, you must have made a pile
off of Dub MD's alone.

723
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,417
That's Weapons of Mass Destruction.

724
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,478
I know who they are.

725
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,855
Yeah, well, whatever we made off them,
I can't find it in the books,

726
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,121
which means we can't afford
to record her,

727
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,755
which means no masters,
which means no CDs,

728
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,595
which sure as hell means
no more NTL Records.

729
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,066
Hello?

730
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,230
So, what'd you think?

731
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,829
I would love to produce your record.

732
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:06,206
And because I am going
to produce it, it will rock.

733
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,471
That's great.

734
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,570
So Capitol can miss you
for a few days?

735
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,137
I think we can negotiate that.

736
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,274
Wait, you were with Capitol?

737
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,615
I was supposed to meet
an A<i>&</i>R guy over there,

738
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,746
but then I signed with Nick Carr.

739
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,523
Excuse me, Linda.

740
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:30,632
Did you just say
you're under contract with Nick Carr?

741
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,462
No, not anymore.

742
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,664
Actually, Chili told Raji
that it was cancelled.

743
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,109
Linda? Why don't you
take a break, honey?

744
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,269
All right.

745
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,360
Chili, it doesn't work like that, okay?

746
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,594
I mean, you've gotta
get the contract back from him.

747
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,602
Otherwise, he still runs the show.

748
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,932
Edie, I was a shylock.

749
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,529
I know how these things work.

750
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,508
I've known Nicky for years.
You'll get your contract.

751
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,142
Slight problem.

752
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,450
This could be ugly.

753
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,653
- Why is that?
- That's Sin LaSalle.

754
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,162
He manages and produces
the Dub MD's.

755
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,559
Tommy owe him money?

756
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,927
I would say yes.

757
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,061
- Tiffany, man the phones.
- Okay.

758
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,537
Hy, get in the office.
Look like you know what you're doing.

759
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,006
Edie, I want you behind the desk.
You're still the boss.

760
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,509
These guys need to see
that NTL is still in business.

761
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,205
Okay.
Where should I hide the books?

762
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,577
Leave them on the desk.

763
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,940
And whatever you do,
don't mention the Russians.

764
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,411
Don't mention the Russians.
Okay.

765
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,094
No. No, we're totally booked.
But that would've been good.

766
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,823
Hang on one second.

767
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,865
Sin, honey!
How are you?

768
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,599
Enough with the pleasantries.

769
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,265
Where's our money, Edie?

770
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,572
Sin.

771
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,171
Sin LaSalle. Man!

772
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,950
What's up?! Come on!

773
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,745
No?

774
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,346
Okay, you know what?
I totally get it, man.

775
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,914
I totally get it.
First of all, welcome to NTL.

776
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,892
Second of all,
I wanna introduce myself.

777
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,986
Hy Gordon.
I know who you are.

778
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,156
- See?
- Capitol Records.

779
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,861
Eight years ago,
you turned down our demo, Hyman.

780
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,766
You know what, Sin?
You know Capitol, man.

781
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,067
It's like art by comittee
over there, okay?

782
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:54,099
Personally, I totally, totally dug
all y'all's sound, all right?

783
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,510
Seriously, I'm thinkin'
about leavin' Capitol.

784
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:01,875
Look, Sin, you know,
Tommy left his will a mess.

785
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,419
You know, if you just give us
a few weeks...

786
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:06,388
Right. Then I'd call up
and the phone is disconnected.

787
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,226
Why don't you write us
a check for 300 grand

788
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,124
and we'll kindly be on our way.

789
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,289
Sin, you know we don't have
that kind of money on hand.

790
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,559
Then I need to check your books.

791
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,135
Be cool.

792
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,871
Be cool?

793
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,431
You don't know me.

794
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:28,069
I know you a whole lot better
than you think I do.

795
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,613
Ivy League rich kid.
Goes to Wharton.

796
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,308
Gets an MBA.

797
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,010
Puts on some Timberlands
and a throwback

798
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,484
and suddenly you got street cred?

799
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,290
Look, I'll tell you the truth, okay?

800
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,961
The Russians took it.

801
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,297
The what?

802
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,063
The Russians.
With one of those insurance scams.

803
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,469
You know, like "give us half a mil
and we won't kill you"?

804
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,904
And, Sin, you knew Tommy, right?

805
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,272
I mean, he never wanted any trouble.

806
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,072
I mean, he gave him
everything we have,

807
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,739
but these Russians,
okay, these monsters,

808
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,406
they're animals.

809
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,313
They kept on coming back
for more and more,

810
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,011
so Tommy told 'em get lost.

811
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,077
To make a long story short...

812
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,957
...I'm a widow now.

813
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,968
Oh, my God.

814
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,363
Excuse me, Chuckles.

815
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,233
It's my wife's cousin.

816
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,407
I really enjoyed that story, Edie.

817
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,379
I mean, Russians.

818
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:11,573
Russians.

819
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,048
I know it's hard, but...

820
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,550
I'm a highly educated man.

821
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:19,055
Sincerely, you don't expect me
to believe a story about some Russians.

822
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,757
Now, I suggest
that you open up those books

823
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,761
or things gonna get real ugly
up in here.

824
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,694
Sin, the books are
none of your business.

825
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,063
You'll get the money when NTL has it.

826
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,224
Dabu.

827
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,360
Thank you. Thank you!

828
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,496
Poppin' me is not gonna
do you any good.

829
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:38,541
But if you wait till Friday,
I get you your money plus the vig.

830
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,578
Plus the vig. All right.
All right, okay.

831
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,807
Everybody cool out.
Everybody calm down.

832
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:49,910
Calm down, calm down.

833
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,615
Wait, so you sayin' plus the vig?

834
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,918
Plus the vig.

835
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,892
All right. Okay.
All right, all right, cool.

836
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,188
All right, we gonna do this.

837
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,230
Dabu. Bu!

838
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,265
Never get to shoot nobody!
Never!

839
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,425
Don't never let me do
what I wanna do!

840
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,867
You know, it's a long day, man.

841
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:09,064
You'll get a chance
to kill somebody, all right?

842
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:12,131
Calm down.
We got some other stops to make today.

843
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:16,908
All right, so I'm not gonna
kill y'all today.

844
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,511
Now, I'll be generous.

845
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,450
But come Friday,
if you don't have my money,

846
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:26,455
the next meeting I arrange will be
between you and Tommy Athens,

847
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,457
if you get what I'm sayin'.

848
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:30,287
I feel ya.

849
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,860
You feel me. You...

850
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:41,331
Dabu.

851
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,130
Player.

852
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,814
The vig.
I mean, what's a vig?

853
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,822
Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?

854
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,358
You're gonna give him
your fancy equipment, okay?

855
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,586
Or you're gonna have a garage sale.

856
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,389
We're not selling anything.

857
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,788
Hey, where are you goin'?

858
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:09,059
Gotta see Nicky Carr.

859
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,897
Black Eyed Peas are playing tonight,
if you're interested.

860
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,308
You say there's a dark parking lot
by the Mayan, right?

861
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,215
Why you trippin' on me, Elliot?

862
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,482
Are you still crying
over that Chili Palmer shit?

863
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,819
No. He just... he said
he was gonna call me, that's all.

864
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,360
And did he call you back?

865
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,418
He's just messing
with your head, man!

866
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,226
Ain't no Samoan faggot
going by the name Elliot Wihelm

867
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,358
is gonna make it to the big screen.

868
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,561
Raisin' a goddamn eyebrow.

869
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,105
I understand shit like this
'cause I ain't a homo.

870
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,471
Once you turn faggot,
you lose all self-respect.

871
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,736
You're not wired right.

872
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,804
Man, what the hell
you stoppin' the car here for?

873
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:58,870
Man, you crazy?

874
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,280
You move the car,
we can all get to work.

875
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,817
Man, why you
stopping the car here, man?

876
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:02,874
What are you doin'?

877
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,114
- Get your ass back in the car.
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

878
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:06,281
Steering wheel's
in the front of the car, fool.

879
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,846
What's up? What?

880
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,654
You say it again and I quit.

881
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,489
What'd I say?
The faggot thing?

882
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:12,722
The homo?

883
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,991
Man, I'm walkin'.
I ain't even trippin', man.

884
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,533
I'm... What'd I say?
What'd I say?

885
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,126
Okay, Elliot, I know you frustrated
with all this bodyguard shit and whatnot.

886
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,468
I smell you, man.
I feel you pain.

887
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:25,007
This shit's temporary.
Stop crowdin' my shit.

888
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:26,667
When I signed you four years ago,

889
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,574
I said, "Man, that man can sing."

890
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,170
I said, "He's gonna be a big star."
A big star, man.

891
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:34,308
That's why I laid out all the paper
to put you up in a video.

892
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,511
I put paper down, man,
to put you in a video.

893
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:37,576
Right?

894
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,088
No one else
on this damn beach has a video.

895
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:41,249
Man, I love you like a brother.

896
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,589
I used to bag on you all the time.
Man, you trippin'.

897
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:45,818
Why you doin' that, man?

898
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,989
Wanna take a shot at me, kid?
Do it.

899
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,327
Do it!

900
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,827
I'm just sayin' if that's what this
is gonna be, then it's gonna be that.

901
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,737
But I would prefer to stay
on the same page.

902
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,900
Man, let your voice be your ladder.
Man, I'm serious.

903
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:01,069
This acting shit
got you acting crazy, man.

904
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,977
What's up?
You know I love you, man.

905
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,112
Come on, man.

906
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:09,743
E. Weazy!
Come on, baby!

907
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,945
E. Weazy!
Come on, baby.

908
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,582
E. Weazy.

909
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,285
Come on, I'm clownin', baby.

910
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,420
You know I'm clownin'.
Turn around 'cause you know I'm clownin'.

911
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,862
Come on, player, stop hatin'.
Stop hatin'.

912
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:25,493
Start participatin'.
Start participatin', star.

913
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,436
Come on, twinkle, twinkle, baby.
Twinkle, twinkle.

914
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:37,509
Come on, Larry.
You sound like an A<i>&</i>R guy.

915
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,812
I'm bangin' the phones
like a goddamn wild man.

916
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:47,318
Larry, I'll call you back.

917
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,925
I heard Sean Penn lives up here.

918
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:59,400
- You see him much?
- Not as much as I'd like.

919
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:03,463
How'd you get in here?

920
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,599
Your maid left the back door open.

921
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,238
- I don't have a maid.
- I can tell.

922
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,842
Come on. Get out of here
before I have to shoot you.

923
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:17,182
Nah, Nicky, sit down
and stop being such a hard-on.

924
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:25,524
So, Mr. Red Hot Chili Pepper.

925
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,526
I heard you were at the Viper Room.

926
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,498
So Raji told you about Linda Moon.

927
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,228
She's something else, huh?

928
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,031
The heart and soul of that group.

929
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:37,801
I'm telling you, bro,
the Chicks are gonna be big.

930
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:40,707
How's that?
By singing songs from the '70s?

931
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,142
Don't laugh.

932
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,203
You see, you're a movie guy,
so you don't know,

933
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:46,875
but the music biz,
it goes in cycles.

934
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:47,939
It's like Linda.

935
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,986
When I signed her,
girl power was dead.

936
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,419
It was the era
of the singer-songwriter.

937
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,081
But now the market's flooded.

938
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:57,320
What do the labels want?
Girl groups.

939
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:59,225
Nicky, look at me.

940
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,529
I am.

941
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,657
I want Linda's contract.

942
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,328
If you want to produce
Linda's album, great.

943
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,633
I'm sure you can even get
a buck a record.

944
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,196
But I got her booked
into some major gigs, bro.

945
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:13,799
And I'm two seconds away
from getting her a deal.

946
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:17,973
You mean you've had Linda for two years
and you've never gotten her a record deal?

947
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,516
Chili, a trio is not born overnight.

948
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,610
I've had her for three days,
and I already got her a label.

949
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,882
So it looks
like we don't need you, Nicky.

950
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,151
Let's get something straight.

951
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,018
This isn't the movies.

952
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:34,894
You can't tell everyone you're a wise guy
and charm their pants off.

953
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,956
This is the music business.

954
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,626
We're all wise guys.

955
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,262
All right, wise guy, I'll make you a deal.

956
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:46,433
Carosell, which is the dumbest name
I've ever heard for a company,

957
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,478
gives me Linda Moon's contract,

958
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,480
and if you ever threaten her
in any way,

959
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,381
you'll regret it
for as long as you live, if that.

960
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,842
That's some deal.

961
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,444
What's in it for me?

962
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:01,650
I'll just make-believe that that dead
Russian that I found in my house

963
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,420
had nothing to do with you.

964
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,460
You don't know
what you're doing, Chil.

965
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:11,401
What makes you even think
Linda could make it on her own?

966
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,827
She's got me.

967
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:22,036
He's gonna cry till I tell him
that I'll never roam

968
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:27,778
So, Chattanooga Choo-Choo,
won't you choo-choo me home?

969
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,281
So, you're like a rapper now?

970
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,945
Sniff Doggy Doo-doo.

971
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,418
You clownin' my gear again?

972
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,652
You know you like this, Joe.
Come on, Joe!

973
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,921
You know my style
makes the ladies smile.

974
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,454
They just started
<i>Chattanhooga Choo-Choo.</i>

975
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:42,930
I love that song.
I can't believe they did that.

976
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,227
Damn, man.
I wish I coulda heard that.

977
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,700
I like a good choo-choo song.

978
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,293
Look, do you want your money
or what, my man?

979
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,270
First off, I ain't your man,
you asshole.

980
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,000
You remember my driver Elliot.

981
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,042
Elliot, give this man the envelope.

982
00:51:58,381 --> 00:51:59,678
Ain't you gonna count it?

983
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,649
Nick ain't got the balls to stiff me.

984
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,152
I like that idea you had
about having a bat in the car.

985
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,689
I had my man Elliot
go out and get one.

986
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:15,489
A red bat!

987
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,127
You don't send a queer to get a bat.

988
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,695
They like these shiny queer things.

989
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,707
What you want... It's not your fault...

990
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:28,869
What you want is a wood bat.
See, like a Louisville Slugger.

991
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:30,640
Let me see.
Hold this for me, please. Thank you.

992
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,205
You see, a bat like this,
it messes up a kid's swing.

993
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,945
You gotta take too long of a swipe
across the plate, you see?

994
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,486
He never develops those fast hands

995
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,249
you're gonna need for the majors,
you understand?

996
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,914
I don't know how fast
it's gotta be for my needs,

997
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,219
you know what I'm sayin' to you?

998
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,852
I ain't gonna be up in no majors...
You like that one, huh?

999
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,387
Here's your sandwich.

1000
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,030
What's up?

1001
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:55,334
Raji, I think he's chokin'.

1002
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:58,499
You clownin' me?
Joe, are you clownin' with me?

1003
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:11,787
You don't ever disrespect me!

1004
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:12,980
One!

1005
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:14,683
Raji, Raji, Raji.

1006
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:20,490
Damn.

1007
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:22,656
He's dead.

1008
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:23,721
Man!

1009
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,401
Talk all that shit, man.

1010
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,539
This right here,

1011
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,909
this was the cost of doin'... business!

1012
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,386
All I want is some appreciation, Elliot.

1013
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,512
Chili Palmer don't realize
how hard I work for Linda Moon.

1014
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,454
I tried to make her a superstar!

1015
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:50,425
What do I expect in return?
What do I expect in return?

1016
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:54,156
My name on the damn CD so small
you can barely read the damn thing!

1017
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,665
And where's that at?
Where's that always at?

1018
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,567
On the back, at the bottom.
"Produced by Raji."

1019
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:02,730
In tiny little letters, man!

1020
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:05,240
And I will not let him
take that from me!

1021
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:06,969
Now it's time I got some respect!

1022
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,944
I will straight smoke Chili Palmer!

1023
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,655
I didn't take you
for a Black Eyed Peas fan.

1024
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:23,557
Well, when they hooked up
with Sergio Mendes, they won me over.

1025
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:27,160
Do you ever think
about becoming a singer?

1026
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,219
- A singer?
- Yeah.

1027
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,287
Me?

1028
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,492
Nah.

1029
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,471
But I was a real live
Vegas showgirl once.

1030
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,562
- Really?
- Yeah.

1031
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,904
As soon as I was
done washing clothes, I got lucky.

1032
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,409
One of those Tropicana revues,
you know?

1033
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:42,467
Thanks.

1034
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:48,742
Chili, I worked so hard starting NTL.

1035
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,685
I'm a bit too old to go back to Vegas.

1036
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,950
I want you to stop worrying.

1037
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,492
We're gonna meet Steven Tyler.

1038
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:03,064
You know, I would've liked
to seen you dance.

1039
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,758
Yeah?

1040
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,320
Well, you still can.

1041
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:27,151
Yeah? How's that?

1042
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,123
Do you dance, Chili?

1043
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:31,660
Me? I'm from Brooklyn.

1044
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,253
Okay, so we walk in the Staples Center
with Linda's CD.

1045
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,223
- Right.
- And then what?

1046
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:17,020
We put a gun to Steven's head

1047
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:19,653
and say, "Linda's playing
with Aerosmith."

1048
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,823
You really like the music business,
don't you, Chil?

1049
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,391
Love it.

1050
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,728
Me, too.

1051
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:32,973
Tommy and me,
we had a few records on the air,

1052
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:36,068
but I'd just like one time
to turn on the radio

1053
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:41,173
and say, "That's my song.
I produced that."

1054
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:44,686
Somethin', somethin' with soul.

1055
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:46,051
You know?

1056
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:52,694
Your hair's different, huh?

1057
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:56,424
Yeah.

1058
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,958
I had it trimed.

1059
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,706
Good night, Chili.

1060
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,007
All right.

1061
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,512
Drive safe.

1062
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,969
That's the pawn shop my friend
from the OC told me about.

1063
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:41,837
It's surrounded by the Feds.
They're watching these Russians.

1064
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:43,671
There he is.

1065
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:48,413
- Oh, yeah.
- His name's Roman Bulkin.

1066
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:50,910
What are you doin'?

1067
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,579
Are you crazy?
They know what you look like.

1068
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,021
What are you gonna tell 'em?

1069
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,719
No more than I have to, if that.

1070
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,959
<i>- Onhe twenhty-two. George.</i>
<i>- That's 4-8-8 Sunset.</i>

1071
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,559
<i>Subject's approaching</i>
<i>northwest corner.</i>

1072
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,908
You've got a lot of balls.

1073
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,881
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1074
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,480
There's half a dozen
undercover cops outside.

1075
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:29,786
Don't give 'em a reason to come in.

1076
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,451
<i>Nyet!</i>

1077
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,158
Now, did you take this picture?

1078
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:39,760
Go to hell, you greasy wop
son of a bitch.

1079
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:42,600
Now you're the one
that's gonna need protection.

1080
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:50,339
You go now.

1081
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,044
Is that chest hair real?
