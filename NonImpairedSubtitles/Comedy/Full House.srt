1
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:41,849
Alright girls now, not one word about your dad´s surprise party tonight, okay?!

2
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:43,953
That means you, Steph.

3
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,043
What makes you think I'm gonna tell him.

4
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:49,189
Because you blew dad's surprise party last year.

5
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,810
I was only four. Give me a break!

6
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:58,375
Steph, this is an important birthday. Your dad turns the big three- 0

7
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,250
How much more than five is the big three- 0?

8
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:03,044
Well, here I´ll show you.

9
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:04,734
This is you

10
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,412
And this is your daddy.

11
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:20,707
Wow, he´s almost the whole box.

12
00:02:22,732 --> 00:02:25,217
Make way, it´s a good year birthday glimpse.

13
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,359
I had to take a couple balloons off or else she would have been picked up by radar.

14
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:34,202
All right, your daddy is on the way down.

15
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:37,482
Stephanie, I heard about last year. Do not spoil the surprise party.

16
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:39,646
Man, one little mistake.

17
00:02:41,643 --> 00:02:42,644
Good morning everyone!

18
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:44,461
Happy birthday!

19
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,671
Okay, it´s been said.

20
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:50,779
Now we can just move on and forget the fact that

21
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:52,883
I´m… I´m…

22
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:54,361
Thirty!

23
00:02:55,567 --> 00:03:00,407
Thank you! Okay, anyway I don´t turn … turn…

24
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:02,413
Thirty!

25
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:06,955
Thank you! I don´t turn, what you just said, until 8.15.

26
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:09,062
Dad, it´s 8.20.

27
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:11,410
O, my God!

28
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:15,960
This is a present from Michelle, Steph and me.

29
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:21,549
Look at this, DJ, Stephanie and Michelle´s coupon- book.

30
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:25,564
This is great! And you made it yourselves. I love this!

31
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:28,522
DJ and Stephanie will change Michelle´s diaper.

32
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:30,134
I´ll hold on to this.

33
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:32,945
Sorry Jesse they are not transferable.

34
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:37,675
And a free car wash for my car "Bullet".

35
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,627
Do you realize I bought that car 10 years ago on my twentieth birthday.

36
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:46,801
You know, every time I get behind the wheel I put the top down and start blasting myself

37
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:49,383
with improvement tapes, I feel like a kid again.

38
00:03:50,674 --> 00:03:52,832
Boy, you were born to raise heck.

39
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:57,910
Dad, that must be another birthday surprise.

40
00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:04,736
Look at them run. Did I ever run like that?

41
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:07,802
You bet, you always ran like a girl.

42
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:12,383
Come on grandpa, I help you cross the living room floor.

43
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:16,383
You know, you shouldn´t be so cocky, just because you are 24 and I´m… I´m…

44
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:18,449
Thirty!

45
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:26,292
All right, girls tell our lucky contestant what´s behind door number one. Phana! Carol Marol!

46
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,241
I won a man?!

47
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:35,145
Not just any man. Jimmy, tell him what he has won!

48
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,659
Okay Bob! Danny Tanner, you´ll be riding in style because you have won your very own chauffeur- driver limousine for a day.

49
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:53,012
Yes, it´s a stretched limousine complete with a bar, TV, telephone and a year supply of calendars. One!

50
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:02,460
You guys have gone all out. This is terrific. But I wish you hadn´t gone to such a big expense.

51
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:08,148
We didn´t. I´m gonna fumigate his house for free. I can´t say it enough, God bless silverfish.

52
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:11,522
Hey girls, do you want to ride to school in a limo?

53
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:15,599
I´d love to ride in a limo. But can it take us somewhere else besides school?

54
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,615
Let´s hit the mal!

55
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:19,490
All right, Steph!

56
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:22,380
You´re going to school. Let´s go! Let's go

57
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:24,868
Thanks for a terrific birthday.

58
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:30,804
Okay, I want one thing. I want you to remember I do not want a party.

59
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:32,991
This will be our little secret.

60
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:36,447
I mean it, no party.

61
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:37,305
Fine!

62
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,742
Back to the party.

63
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:42,602
Well, Bob I think we´ll make up the decorations in to…

64
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:43,275
No, no, no, don´t with the voice.

65
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:47,275
Okay, food arrives at five. Belly- dancer arrives at 5.30.

66
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,358
Belly- dancer leaves at 6.

67
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:51,274
Guests arrive at 6.30.

68
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,149
Limo- drive standing here at home at 7.

69
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:56,744
What about his present?

70
00:05:56,945 --> 00:06:01,139
All right, the present. I´m leaving work early. I´m gonna take "Bullet". Get him fitted for seat covers. He is gonna love it. Come on!

71
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:08,978
Boy, he really loves this car.

72
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,868
Hey, who wouldn´t? I mean we´re talking about a car that goes from 0 to 60 in two weeks.

73
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,712
Now Steph, do it just the way I told you.

74
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:37,590
D.J. I´m old enough to carry a tray of apesisers… alebisers…cheese- sticks!

75
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,087
Excuse me, do you care about cheese?

76
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:44,487
Thank you, Stephanie!

77
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:48,618
Steph, it´s do you care FOR cheese?

78
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:51,579
She took one, didn´t she?

79
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,743
All right, good night! Thanks for dragging it home.

80
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:58,276
Sure pal, good luck!

81
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:01,654
Poor "Bullet".

82
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:06,933
Maybe Danny won´t notice.

83
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:10,885
Boy, am I in trouble. Joey!

84
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:16,027
Jesse, what´s wrong? I have never seen your face this shade of green before. This must be serious.

85
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:18,213
It is.

86
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:21,215
Uncle Jesse, is something wrong? I´m getting these vibes.

87
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:23,169
Yes, something is very wrong.

88
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,450
I knew it. This is great.

89
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:32,496
I´m sorry, but I´m developing woman´s intuition. It´s a big step in my life.

90
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:38,656
Listen, your father´s car has been in a little accident.

91
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:40,770
How little?

92
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:44,405
Big little. Follow me! You guys can take a look.

93
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,022
You´re dead meat!

94
00:07:55,018 --> 00:07:57,434
This is going to take all the fun out of those seat covers.

95
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:58,905
What are you going to do?

96
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,031
I´m gonna do what I have to do. I´m gonna tell him the truth.

97
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:09,514
When we´re in trouble we give dad "we´re the cutest little girls in the world look".

98
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:17,310
That may work for you girls, but I don´t have those cute little dimples.

99
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,436
Maybe if you put a pretty little bow in your hair or something.

100
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,169
Not funny.

101
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:26,472
Danny´s coming up the steps! Come on!

102
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,734
What do we do?

103
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:30,022
Okay, here´s the plan: First we hide the seat covers.

104
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,147
All right, hide the seat covers.

105
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:33,812
Now what?

106
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:39,116
It´s tough enough for Danny turning 30. It´s his birthday and you got to promise you are not going to ruin it for him.

107
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:39,899
Okay, I promise.

108
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:43,624
Then we have to make sure he has the best time he has ever had in his entire life.

109
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:44,485
Good, we do that.

110
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:49,296
Then in the after glow, you´ll set him down and gently rip his hear out.

111
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,471
Can´t you come up with a happier ending.

112
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:56,084
Yeah, the car- ferry shows up and makes everything wonderful.

113
00:08:58,148 --> 00:08:59,407
Sssch! Quiet everyone!

114
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:04,522
Let´s see, 15 of my friends´ cars parked right out front, I wonder…

115
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:11,348
I don't believe this!

116
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:18,252
Thank you, thank you! This is great! I love this! Everybody is here. This is so nice.

117
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:22,146
All my friends from the station are here. Are we running a test pattern tonight?

118
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:24,790
Cousin Ed! O, cousin Ed!

119
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:28,009
Caroline, why aren´t you out running your fishing- boat?

120
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:30,774
O, what?! And miss your nineteenth birthday party.

121
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,334
I´m so glad you are here.

122
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:35,984
Daddy, would you care for some cheese?

123
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,910
O, yes Stehpanie, thank you!

124
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:42,785
This is too easy, I´m ready for dip.

125
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:47,472
There you are you birthday- nuts. I thought I told you no party.

126
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,315
You say that every year.

127
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:51,541
This is the last surprise, isn´t it?

128
00:09:52,409 --> 00:10:00,002
Danny, I just want you to know that Jesse deserves the all the credit. This whole party was his idea, because he loves you.

129
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,129
Always remember that.

130
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,745
Jesse, I know you hate when I hug you…

131
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:10,253
Hey, I have an idea: It´s your birthday, what the heck, why don´t I hug you this time,

132
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:12,379
Brother in law!

133
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:14,677
Say cheese!

134
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,005
Cheese!

135
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:22,629
We´ll call this the "before picture!

136
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:31,684
Now Danny, if you don´t like it there´s no way I can return it, so you better like it.

137
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,399
Caroline, this is great.

138
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:42,599
The last time Danny went fishing on my boat he didn´t catch a thing, so I minored his bate.

139
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,163
Hey, I´m just out there for the fresh air.

140
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:48,818
Daddy, I found another present.

141
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:52,426
You never saw me!
