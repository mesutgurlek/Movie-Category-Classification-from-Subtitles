The Supreme Court ruled

a Hefty bag out of that yard...

464
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:04,762
that was bulky
and probably a little moist?

They could have been digging

The kid spotted us last night.
When we were sleeping, he got up.

493
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:28,725
He went to the garbage can,
he took the body and then he...

494

He buried him in the backyard.

- I hope nothing happened to him.

We got the goods on 'em, don't we?

Someday they're gonna dig up

I'm gonna help you

Come now, Mr Peterson.
You were in my basement.

The name was Knapp.
