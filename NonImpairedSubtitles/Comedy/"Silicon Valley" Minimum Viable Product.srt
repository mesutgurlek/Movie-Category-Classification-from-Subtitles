00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,180
Uh, I just, I don't want to
end up being a Hooli lifer.

162
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,760
You know, working here forever.

163
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,930
Yeah, working for the most
innovative company in the world,

164
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,190
with top pay and vested stock options.

165
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,950
I can totally see why
you wouldn't want that.

166
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,490
Yeah, you're like an
artist. An entrepreneur.

167
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,120
An iconoclast.

168
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,030
I don't know, maybe.

169
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,120
Dude, we're just messing with you.

170
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,630
But we really want to
help you with your site.

171
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,450
What's it called?

172
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,120
Pied Piper.

173
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,760
- Dude, sounds amazing.
- Yeah.

174
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,960
Why don't you shoot it over to
us and we'll give it a look.

175
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,640
Maybe we can help.

176
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,600
- Uh, really?
- Yeah.

177
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,970
Ok, yeah.

178
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,440
I mean it's always good
to have more eyes on it.

179
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,890
It's... sent it.

180
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,360
Oh, you're making fun of me.

181
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,730
- Dude, no.
- No, you are.

182
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,530
- Aw, Ricky, man.
- Ricky. Ricky, come back.

183
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,240
It's actually Richard, so that's...

184
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,320
- Pied wiper.
- Wide diaper.

185
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,990
Gates, Ellison,

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,500
Jobs, Dell.

187
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,250
All dropped out of college.

188
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,670
Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovation

189
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,760
because of drop outs.

190
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,180
College... has become a cruel

191
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,360
expensive joke on the poor

192
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,100
and the middle class

193
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,990
that benefits only the perpetrators of it.

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,110
- The bloated administrators.
- You are a dangerous man,

195
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,830
spewing ignorance!

196
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,250
I don't think so.

197
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm just saying people
should trust themselves

198
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,290
more than a system that happily
churns out unemployed debtors

199
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,620
and provides dubious value.

200
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,850
The true value of a college
education is intangible.

201
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,850
The true value of snake-oil
is intangible as well.

202
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,890
[Laughter]

203
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,000
Fascist.

204
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,140
Anything?

205
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,140
The usual riffs on twitter and instagram.

206
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,570
Nothing I'd fund.

207
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,870
- Hi, excuse me, Mr. Gregory?
- [Sighs]

208
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,980
I have an idea I'd love to
pitch you, if you have time.

209
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,150
Oh.

210
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,410
Well, that is before I just
give up and go back to college.

211
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,750
Don't! Do not do that.

212
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,420
Go work at Burger King.

213
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,800
Go into the woods and
forage for nuts and berries.

214
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,930
Do not go back to college!

215
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,430
I think I have been played.

216
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,390
Fine. Go ahead and pitch.

217
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,760
You have until I fasten
the seat-belt in my car.

218
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,590
Thank you so much.

219
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,110
Pied Piper is a proprietary
site that lets you find out

220
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,150
if your music is infringing
on any existing copyrights.

221
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,110
So, imagine you were a song writer, ok?

222
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,290
I don't think I could write a song.

223
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,320
Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.

224
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,360
I don't even think I could say,
"Pied Piper is a proprietary site."

225
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,580
Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.

226
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,080
Crunching all those songs

227
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,420
to find matches sounds like it would
take incredible processing power.

228
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,370
- I mean...
- Yes.

229
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,620
Yes, it does.

230
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,510
No, no. Its... I made an algorithm.

231
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,220
Look, why don't you send me a link to
your project and we'll take a look.

232
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,220
Ok, yeah, great.

233
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,690
I put the prototype up on github.

234
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,970
Pied Piper. I'll look it up.

235
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,440
It's like the fable with the kids

236
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,620
and then the rats and the music.

237
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,490
That is a narrow car.

238
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,960
Fucking billionaires.

239
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,170
Hey, wanna check out twig-boy's website?

240
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,250
Yes, I do.

241
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,670
You have to download your own media player?

242
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,890
Ahh.

243
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:29,350
Look at me, I traveled back to 2009.

244
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,930
Wait a sec.

245
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,580
What is this file size?

246
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,900
1.2 megabytes? No way.

247
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,940
Wow, that doesn't sound at all downgraded.

248
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,660
The file size is like, half.

249
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:48,040
And look how fast this search is.

250
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,340
Holy shit, how did it
find a match that fast?

251
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,540
It's like it's searching compressed files?

252
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,010
No way.

253
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,260
[Rock music playing]

254
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,630
Look at that weissman score.

255
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,380
2.89.

256
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,630
Hey, where have you two been?

257
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,900
We're playing the multi-channel
router team in five minutes.

258
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,110
Ok, how the hell did he do this?

259
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,400
And the compression is totally lossless.

260
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,650
And he's somehow figured out a way to
do a search on a compressed data space.

261
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,320
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

262
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,290
And I don't think he even
realizes what he has here.

263
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,250
He's using it for some
silly songwriter app.

264
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,090
All these guys are like that,
they're all about consumer facing.

265
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,960
Right, but you take something like this,

266
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,760
make it business facing
and use it for enterprise?

267
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,430
The applications could be endless.

268
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,970
Hey, I thought you were a satanist?

269
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,310
I'm a LaVeyan Satanist

270

271
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,560
Oh, some theistic tendencies.

272
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,980
Well then, what's with the cross?

273
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,260
It's an upside down cross.

274
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:00,020
Not from here it isn't.

275
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,910
Oh, I see, you know what you should do?

276
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,660
You should get another tattoo
that says, "this side up" on it.

277
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,290
How does this translate into Farsi?

278
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,910
That's not the language I speak.

So... what do you got?

282
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,870
Ok, here it is.

283
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,960
Bit Soup.

284
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,960
It's like alphabet soup but

285
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,440
it's ones and zeros instead of the letters.

286
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,560
'Cause it's binary. You know,
binary is just ones and zeroes.

287
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,940
Yeah, I know what binary is.

288
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,440
Jesus Christ! I memorized
the hexadecimal times tables

289
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,730
when I was 14 writing machine code!

290
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,030
Ok. Ask me what nine times f is.

291
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,490
It's fleventyfive.

292
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,620
I do not need you telling
me what binary is,

293
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,590
just like I don't need you thinking
about soup or taking pictures of it.

294
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,370
I need you thinking about
apps, software, websites.

300
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,840
It's probably those brogrammers.

301

how stupid my website is.

Hello, Richard Hendricks.
I'm a total fucking retard.

304
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,350
Uh. Hi, this is Jared
Dunn calling from Hooli.

305
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,690
I'm calling a behalf of Gavin Belson.

306
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,690
I didn't... hi.

307
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,160
Gavin is very excited about
your Pied Piper application

308
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,000
and we were wondering if you could come in

309
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,750
for a sit-down with us.

310
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,710
- <i> Are you available now.</i>
- Ok.

311
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,550
- Sure. Yes.
- <i> Ok, we'll be here.</i>

313
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,890
Uh, I have a meeting with Gavin Belson.

314
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,430
He likes Pied Piper.

315
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,300
- Holy shit.
- I own 10 percent of Pied Piper.

316
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,710
You said it was a shitty idea.

317
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,770
It was a shitty idea.

318
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,380
I'm not sure what it is now.

319
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,600
- What time's the meeting?
- Right now.

320
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,810
I'm gonna need a better shirt.

321
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,140
Holy shit.

322
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,460
What the fuck am I waiting for? See ya.

323
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,490
Well, it's like Gavin always says,
"it takes change to make change."

324
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,760
Yeah, I think I've seen
that written around.

325
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,720
- Hey.
- Hi.

326
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,840
Gavin is running 30 minutes late

327
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,430
but you should know he is very
excited to see you, Richard.

328
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,840
He's with his spiritual advisor.

329
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,560
He shouldn't be that much longer.

330
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,930
I'm a VP here and I only get to
see him about ten minutes a month.

331
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,180
But that 10 minutes is just incredible.

332
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,990
I heard Richard Hendricks was here.

333
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,110
Have you ever met Gavin before?

334
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,770
- No.
- No?

335
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,450
Oh, I told him, it's amazing.

336
00:15:54,450 --> 00:16:00,030
That hardly begins to describe it.

337
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,130
It's weird.

338
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,040
They always travel in groups of five.

339
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,590
These programmers, there's
always a tall skinny white guy,

340
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,760
short skinny Asian guy,

341
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,210
fat guy with a ponytail,

342
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,180
some guy with crazy facial hair

343
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,480
and then an East Indian guy.

344
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,050
It's like they trade guys until
they all have the right group.

345
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,390
You clearly have a great
understanding of humanity.

346
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,860
And Gavin said I'm not humiliating you,

347
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,900
I'm elevating you.

348
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,820
Ah, Gavin.

[Cell phone ringing]

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,000
This is Richard.

351
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,340
It's Peter Gregory.

352
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,070
Ah, no.

353
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,130
Come on, Big Head.

354
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,750
Yeah, I'm coming. Slow...

355
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,850
Why are you going that fast?

356
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,020
We've got a meeting with Gavin
Belson. Pick up the pace.

357
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:07,230
- We honestly don't.
- Come on.

358
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,030
I'm actually outside of Gavin Belson's
office right now, Mr. Gregory.

359
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,070
Uh, here he comes, so
can I call you back in...

360
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,000
So, Richard Hendricks is here!

361
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,360
There you are, Richard.

362
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,780
So sorry these gentleman
have kept you waiting.

363
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,250
- That's fine.
- So here's the thing.

364
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,470
I love what you did.

365
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,710
- Really?
- Fill him in, Jared.

366
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,550
Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possibly

367
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,760
the most progressive company in the world.

368
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,300
Part of that is Gavin's
commitment to social justice,

369
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,880
but part of it is his personal commitment

370
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,060
to the people that work at Hooli.

371
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,390
In that spirit Gavin is prepared to
give you a very substantial raise...

372
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,860
And a promotion to go with it.

373
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,890
I own 10 percent.

Erlich Bachman. This is Big Head.

376
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,410
I don't know what any of that means, but I'll
give you six hundred thousand dollars for it.

377
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,400
We have the reach and the resources
to take what you have done

378
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,370
and push it to the global level.

379
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,490
That is a generous offer.

380
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,080
Shit, sorry. Hello.

381
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,580
Really? No shit, that's...

382
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,260
Uh, yeah, yeah. No here.
It's Peter Gregory.

383
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,810
Not sure how he got my number?

384
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,140
Uh, this is Richard.

385
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,600
I'll give you three million
dollars for it right now!

386
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,150
Ah, Gavin Belson just offered me
three million dollars for Pied Piper.

387
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm prepared to give you three
hundred thousand dollars.

388
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,270
Peter Gregory just offered me 300, um...

389
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,030
Did you say thousand dollars?

390
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,740
For ten percent of your company.

391
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,360
Ok, four million.

392
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,680
200 thousand.

393
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,830
- For five percent.
- Huh?

394
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,960
You just went down.

395
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,630
No, you're still valued
at four million dollars.

396
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,010
But you own ninety-five percent of
a potential billion-dollar company.

397
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,650
<i>And not just that, I will
help you build this company.</i>

398
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,430
I will introduce you to
the people you need to know

399
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,770
and provide the counsel that you need.

400
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,190
I will take a small piece, but
the company will belong to you.

<i>Not Gavin Belson.</i>

- Um, you know.
- Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.

million dollars right now.

406
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,660

407

That is a lot of money.

409

I've got to go to the bathroom.

410
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,140
I've got to pee.

411
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,590
It's desperate. I'm bursting.

412
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,340
I'll be right back, but right now...

413
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,680
Ok, 10 million.

414
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,360
No. Maybe.

415
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,520
I didn't mean to snap at you.

416
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,270
I'll talk... in a bit.

417
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,310

I am the founder of Aviato.

420
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,530
And I own a very small
percentage of Grindr.

421
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,450
It's a men to men dating site

422
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,280
where you can find other
men within 10 miles of you.

Interested in having sexual
intercourse in a public restroom.

In the homosexual community
there's sometimes anonymous...

425
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,840
I know what Grindr is.

Yeah. You know, a while back,

435
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,990
we had a guy in here in almost
the exact same situation,

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,870
"take the money or keep the company."

437
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,040
What happened?

438
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,830
Well, a couple months later

439
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,210
he was brought into the ER with
a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

440
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,080
I guess he really regretted
not taking that money.

441
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,300
He shot himself because
he turned down the money?

442
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,970
Yeah.

443
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,270
Or no, he took the money.

444
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,260
Or no.

445
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,640
No, he did not. I don't... You know what?

446
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,270
I don't remember. But whatever it was,

447
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,060
he regretted it so much that
he ended up shooting himself.

448
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,400
- And now he's blind.
- He's blind?

449
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,320
Yeah, just fyi, if you're
ever gonna shoot yourself,

450
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,940
don't hold the gun up to your temple, ok?

451
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,070

452
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,610
both of his optic nerves and then,

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,190
you know, half of his face.

And then his wife left
him, because, you know.

- Yikes.
- Right.

456
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,530
He may have been a genius programmer

457
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,290
but not so much in human anatomy.

458

Or decision making, for that matter.

459
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,790
Now he's got to live with all that

460
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
and whatever terrible decision
he made about the money.

that links up to your
smartphone and it keeps track

464

of your vitals and it tells
you, even before it's happening,

What... how'd you know I was here?

479
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,010
Peter Gregory is invested in a company

480
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,430
that uses GPS in phones to track people.

481
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
That's creepy.

482
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,490
You don't know the half of it.

483
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,770
And neither does congress.

484
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,330
- Are you ok?
- Look, I don't want to waste your time.

485
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,860
I think I gotta take the
money from Gavin Belson.

486
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,080
At least this way when
I blow my eyeballs out

487
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,250
I'll have some money left for my family.

488
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,540
Jesus.

489
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,960
Sorry. That is a terrible doctor in there.

490
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,390
Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yours

491
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,550
is a compression algorithm that
blew our engineering team away.

492
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,890
And what do you think Hooli
is going to do with it?

493
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,020
I don't know. That's their business.

494
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,470
This is your baby.

495
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,890
Do you even realize the
impact that a compression

496
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,940
this good could have on the world?

497
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,310
Getting any file on your
mobile phone in an instant.

498
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,530
Navigation data for self-driving cars,

499
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,900
mobile medical imagery,

500
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,480
all transmitting with no quality loss.

501
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,650
This is game-changing.

502
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,240
Don't you want to be in the
driver's seat when that happens?

503
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,920
You really want to just turn it
all over to Hooli and walk away?

504
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,910
[Sighs]

505
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,170
Well, you are not making
this easier for me.

506
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,590
I'm not trying to.

507
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,140
I mean you're actually making it worse.

508
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,670
My hands are tingling. I have
this metal taste in my mouth.

509
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,340
Actually, I can't go back in
there, so I'm going to go home.

510
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,060
- Let me give you a ride home.
- Good to see you again.

511
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,820
Uh, ok. Thanks.

512
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,900
Dude, where have you been?

513
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,440
Why won't you answer your phone?

514
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,280
Man, this has grown way beyond angellist.

515
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,780
Andreesen, elevation and like a bunch of
other seed funds are piling onto this thing.

516
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,270
I mean, they've been calling Erlich.

517
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,120
He's out of control.

518
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,700
Yeah.

519
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,620
What if we took Peter Gregory's 200k

520
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,120
and built our own company?

521
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,460
[Gilfoyle] I'm sorry. You said we.

522
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,670
Who's that in reference to exactly?

523
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,870
You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.

524
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,510
I mean, right now Pied
Piper just does audio,

525
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,430
but I'm thinking of ways to
compress images, video...

526
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,310
I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.

527
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,010
Maybe this could be huge.

528
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,140
Look, guys, for thousands of years

529
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,640
guys like us have gotten
the shit kicked out of us.

530
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,860
But now, for the first time,
we are living in an era

531
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,940
where we can be in
charge and build empires.

532
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,730
We could be the vikings of our day.

533
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,870
- Vikings?
- How are you feeling?

534
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,950
You look super fucked up to be honest.

535
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,320
[Erlich] Who ate my fucking quinoa again?

536
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,990
So you're really about to go tell Erlich that
he's not going to get his one million dollars?

537
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,160
Yeah, I don't want to be
there when you do that.

538
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,670
I would like to be there when you do that.

539
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:11,750
No, just stay here, please.

540
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,750
Hey.

541
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,340
Um, so, I've been thinking about

542
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,510
this whole Peter Gregory,
Gavin Belson thing.

543
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,180
And, um, I think I'm going
to go with Peter Gregory.

544
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,190
- Uh, which I know means...
- Richard.

545
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,460
I know that you look at me, and see
a guy who has it all figured out.

546
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,530
And for the most part, you're right, I do.

547
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,950
When I sold Aviato,

548
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,750
it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes,

549
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,890
the universal respect of all the ladies.

550
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,710
But there's always been a hole in my heart.

551
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,220
Not a literal hole like you would find

552
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,380
in some babies with congenital diseases,

553
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,380
but a metaphorical hole.

554
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,880
I guess that hole is the "what if".

555
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,680
What if I didn't sell?

556
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,520
I'll never know.

557
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,220
And so I guess what I'm
saying to you now is,

558
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,470
you're like me, Richard.

559
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,560
You want to build something

560
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,280
and see it through.

561
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,650
So, just to be clear.

562
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,820
You're all right with
me saying no to a deal

563
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,900
that will net you a
million dollars outright?

564
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,750
No, Richard. I'm not all right with it.

565
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,070
I'm excited about it.

566
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,630

That's great.

570
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,670
Not partners, exactly.

571
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,660
But everything else is great.

What was that, 17?

578
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,490
- Pretty good.
- Hey, guys...

579
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,080
Guys, can I just kind of
say something real quick?

580
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,450
I know it's stupid but, um...

581
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,830
I just want to say, uh,

582
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,750
I'd like for this company
to be different than Hooli

583
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,630
and Goolybib and all the rest, you know?

584
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,840
Like, let's like not turn
this into a corporate cult

585
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,130
with bike meetings and voluntary retreats

586
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,840
that are actually mandatory.

587
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,850
And claiming to make the world
a better place all the time.

588
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,130
Let's, uh, let's just think different.

589
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,550
Don't think different. That's Apple.

590
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,690
Uh, umm...

591
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,470
Let's just... Let's just do it.

592
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,280
- That's Nike, man.
- I know that's nike.

593
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,140
- Yeah.
- Uh...

594
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,320
Fuck it. I don't know.

595
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,110
Let's just make it...
Let's just make it happen.

596
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,570
Yeah, agreed.

597
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,830
To his beneficence.

598
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,320
Peter Gregory?

599
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,990
- The Dark Lord.
- Of course, The Dark Lord.

600
