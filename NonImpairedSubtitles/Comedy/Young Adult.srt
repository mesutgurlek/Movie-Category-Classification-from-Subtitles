00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,048
You were pretty popular,
if I remember correctly.

162
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,184
You won "Best Hair."

Did I?
What did you win?

164

I didn't.

165
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,109
Uh, they usually give out,
like, 15 of those,

166
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,736
and only to the same five people.

167
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,615
Yeah, well, listen, Matt,
it was really nice seeing you...

What are you doing back

00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,537
Of course not. Gross.

00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,041
- No, I live in Minneapolis.
- Oh.

You're the hate crime guy.

Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?

Yes, Mavis. When I was a...

190
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,690
When we were seniors,

191
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,193
a bunch of jocks who thought
I was gay jumped me in the woods...

That's right.

With a crowbar. I totally remember that.

195
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,235
It was national news.

I mean, until people found out
that I wasn't really gay.

197

Then it wasn't a hate crime any more.

But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.

226

They just tend to happen in slow motion.

[Scoffs] I don't wanna step on
your Mercury High reunion. So...

Go, go, Injuns.

00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:08,255
Actually, uh, they changed the name
to "Indians" back in '99, remember?

It sucks, what happened to Matt.

That poor guy suffered so much
just for being gay.

326
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,472
He's not actually gay.

00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,722
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.

328
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,559
Didn't you call him a theater fag
all the time in high school?

329
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,693
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.

330
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,149
Well, whatever. [Laughs]

since then, though.

Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?

And we're getting
a new Chipotle at the mall.

And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.

You know, one of those Kentucky
Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...

- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.

That's genius. KenTacoHut. [Laughs]

Oh, sorry. I didn't...

00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,984
No, don't be sorry.
It's good. It's fine.

347
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,908
Well, that's Allen's loss.

It sucks to be Allen.

Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.

She's got band practice tonight.

00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,382
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.

playing here tomorrow night. [Laughs]

night to our house for a hang?

359
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,608
We can have dinner, and then
come here and see Beth's show.

00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,777
- I would love that.
- Yeah.

Oh, this is kind of silly,

362
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:09,244
but would you mind signing one

Sure.

I mean, it's not for me, obviously.

It's for my niece, Kendra.

She wants to be a writer someday.

367
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,717
Right, of course.

368
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,975
Um, but you know, my name isn't
actually on the books.

00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,135
I mean, it's on the title page
if you check inside.

But I'm basically a ghostwriter.

I do?

Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed,
you just got lucky.

that what you think you saw tonight

- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.

477
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,048
It's not a formal occasion.

478
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:39,962
I'm looking for something chic, clean,
but also a bit edgy.

479
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,257
OK. We have some adorable
new dresses that just came in.

480
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:48,054
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.

481
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,599
I'm going to a rock concert
with an old flame,

482
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,393
and I think there is a chance
we may reconnect.

483
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,153
Let's show him what he's been missing.

484
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,907
No, he's seen me recently. He knows.

485
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,120
But his wife hasn't
seen me in a while, so...

486
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,453
Well, it's the end of my shift,

487
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,744
and my son has to be
picked up from school.

488
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,288
So I'm just gonna send over
another associate.

489
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,297
She's up on all the trends.

490
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,628
Shawna!

491
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,474
Where are the Waverley Prep books?

492
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,886
They got their own
display table right there.

493
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,017
Wow.

494
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,150
They must be really popular.

495
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,902
[Man] Actually, we just got a lot of
surplus stock we're trying to clear out.

496
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,904
They were big a couple years ago,

497
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,282
but the computer says,
"Do not shelve," so...

498
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,779
Hey, are you writing in there?

499
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,495
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.

500
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,368
You're Jane MacMurray?

501
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,090
No. Jane MacMurray just created
the series. I wrote the book.

502
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,966
Mavis Gary-Crane. See?

503
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,385
Do you know Jane MacMurray?

504
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,970
Yes, I know her really well.

505
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,181
- I wrote the book.
- OK.

506
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,681
Do you want a signed copy
for your store?

507
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,271
No, that's fine.

508
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,687
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.

509
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,528
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed,
we can't send it back to the publisher.

510
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:28,320
Why would you be sending it
back to the publisher?

511
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,490
We're probably not gonna sell them.

512
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,408
The series is done.

513
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,380
Come on, I told you
you can't write in the...

514
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,841
Whatever, book man.

515
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,396
[Mavis] Kendal Strickland never
felt threatened.

516
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:59,276
If anything, she felt a deep sense
of pity for this rebound girl.

517
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,938
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off

518
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,778
That said, she couldn't help
her own popularity.

519
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,116
It wasn't her fault that one year
she was nominated homecoming queen...

520
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,406
...of a neighboring high school.

521
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:16,543
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.

522
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,624
Other girls were so insecure,

523
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,960
stressing about their faces
and their figures, not Kendal.

524
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:26,503
Hers was a gracious, effortless
beauty that glowed from within.

525
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,640
However; being that beautiful
could also be intimidating.

526
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,392
Some guys went for girls
who were more ordinary.

527
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,310
How could Kendal make sure her own
perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan...

528
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,229
...the love of her life?

529
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,741
- What up?
- Hey.

530
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,415
How are you?

531
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,706
- Ooh. How are you?
- Good, good.

532
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:06,001
Here's that book for your niece.

533
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,797
Oh, yeah. Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.

534
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,090
There is a character
in that one that's based on you.

535
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,342
- What?
- In the book.

536
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,513
I mean, I named him Ashby,
but it's so blatantly you.

537
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:21,100
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.

538
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,562
We're not even supposed to do that.

539
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,523
We're supposed to stick
to this character bible...

540
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,982
Hey.

541
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,698
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.

542
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,073
You, too...

543
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,152
Oh... [laughs]

544
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,906
There it is.

545
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,916
Adorable.

546
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,122
Thank you.

547
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,163
- [Baby coos]
- [Buddy, Beth] Aw...

548
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,341
- [Beth] You love it. You love it.
- [cradle playing soft music]

549
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,672
[Buddy sighs]

550
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,382
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?

551
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,263
Oh, just a water.

552
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,219
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.

553
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,056
It's fine. I'll just pump
and dump after the show.

554
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,813
Don't worry. I'm not trying
to get my kid hammered.

555
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,692
Wow, look at that.

556
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:08,856
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium. Always chills her out.

557
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,524
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:15,161
Yes, yes it does. [Chuckles]

559
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,866
Oh, starting to get smiles.

560
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:18,869
Cute.

561
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,079
She's, like, Buddy's clone.

562
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,793
No. I see you in there.

563
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:28,799
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.

564
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,926
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.

565
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,554
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

566
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,432
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.

567
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,468
I saw a nice article
about you in the Sun.

568
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,683
Yes, I'm an author
of a young adult series.

569
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,689
It's disturbingly popular.

570
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,976
[Chuckles]

571
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,150
I like your decor.

572
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:52,736
Is it shabby chic?

573
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,071
Pier One?

574
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,202
A little bit Goodwill.

575
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,489
Buddy and I used to go thrifting
all the time.

576
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,908
Remember that? The '90s?

577
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,792
[Chuckling]

578
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,376
Oh, my God, Beth. We had this huge
silly T-shirt collection.

579
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,132
It was just, like,
the dumbest thing ever...

580
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,259
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.

581
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,304
I used to sleep in his T-shirts
and boxers.

582
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,139
I think I still have a few.

583
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,807
Hey. I still have one of
my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.

584
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,475
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- [Buddy] What?

585
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,191
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.

586
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:32,355
[Beth laughs]

587
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,239
What's the chart?

588
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,617
Uh... Oh.

589
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:40,155
- Beth teaches special needs kids.
- Oh.

590
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,120
A lot of my kids
learn emotions cognitively.

591
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,535
It doesn't come naturally to them
the way it does for you and me.

592
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,420
So we need to show them
"this is what happy looks like,"

593
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,082
"this is what anxious looks like,"
and so on.

594
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,671
What about neutral?

595
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,758
I mean, like,
what if you don't feel anything?

596
00:45:56,921 --> 00:46:00,016
That's kind of how they are
a lot of the time.

597
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,474
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.

598

- Is that Mavis Gary?
- Yeah.

601
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,278
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.

602
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,951
Shots. [Laughs]

603
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,704
Psychotic prom queen bitch.

Really?

605
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,663
Come on, tequila time.

00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,539
Salt.

607
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,511
So... are they any good?

608
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,512
Yeah, they're all right.

609
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:42,676
Mm-hm. I knew it.
They're horrible. I knew it.

610
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:45,812
- Well, they have a lot of fun.
- Hm...

611
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,393
Hey, look. Freehauf's over there.

612
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:53,478
[Mavis] He's just always lurking, isn't
he? So creepy. Look at his face.

613
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,740
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.

614
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,026
- Think he owns any clown suits?
- [Mavis laughs]

615
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,946
- Oh, my God. You're terrible.
- Come on.

616
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,912
- Dark.
- No.

You have no idea. I have tons
and tons of work to catch up on.

788
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,344
Books still selling well?

789
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:55,560
It's like I can hardly keep up.

790
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,771
Is that the money you used
to invest in local real estate?

791
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,895
Huh?

792

I heard you were here to work on some
kind of real estate transaction.

793
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,654
I was just surprised you didn't
use Aunt Lena as your broker.

794

01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,573
The wedding photo. We are divorced.

813

We just thought it was a nice memory.

814

Of my failed marriage?

815
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,546
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.

816
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,581
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.

817
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,376
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.

818
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,296
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.

819
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,594
Have you seen any old friends
on this visit?

...I've been seeing
quite a bit of Buddy.

Oh, the old beau, huh?

01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:44,942
I remember you kids
were so cute in high school.

824
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:49,396
It's funny how those initial instincts
can be so right, you know?

825
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,657
I mean, you make all these mistakes
along the way,

826
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:55,160
but the world will make sure you end up
with the person you're meant to be with.

827
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,413
It's good to keep
those people in your life.

828
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,324
The people who really know you best.

829
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,992
Mm-hm.

830
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:06,876
And that new baby
of his is just darling.

831
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,464
Have you seen it? Up close?

832
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,003
[Mother] I suppose.

833

Is everything OK?

834
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:22,062
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.

835
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,352
It's just that Buddy used to say that...

836
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:32,898
...we would make
the cutest little babies, ever.

837

Hey, did you guys
ever sell my Cabriolet?

Oh, heavy. How are they?

Horrible. God, I've been through a lot.

- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?

845
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,526
Come on. Let's hit the woods
in the back of the school.

846
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,652
- And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...

- Come on!
- Fine.

Could you walk any slower?

849
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,573
[Mavis groans] Our school is so ugly.

850
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,867
It looks like a factory.

851
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:30,210
[Matt] it actually used to be a rubber
fabrication plant back in the '20s.

852
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:32,708
[Mavis] You know everything.

853
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:40,307
These woods were like Hump City
back in the day.

854
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,014
I remember being back here
with a few different guys.

855
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:46,142
I never knew you were such a slut.

I was normal.

857

Uh... So how are things
with old Buddy, huh?

858
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,030
How's the master plan unfolding?

859
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,071
Well, actually, he called me today

860
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:07,494
and asked me if I wanted to participate
in his baby's naming ceremony.

861
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,336
I don't know.

862
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,715
There's still so much
that's unspoken, but...

863
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,376
...he's involving me
in his child's life.

864
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,591
Buddy is a married man.

865
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,300
By all accounts, happily.

866
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,467
Yeah, happily married men
go to bars alone

867

with their ex-girlfriends
all the time.

868
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:29,056
They call them privately, and they
make out with them on porches.

869
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,975
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.

870
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:36,022
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.

871
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,490
He gave me his sweatshirt.

872
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:42,118

They probably noticed in space.

insane wearing it.

what Buddy's doing with you,

that happened 20 years ago.

You lean on that crutch,
and you lean on excuses,

879
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,886
and you and I both know
you use this whole thing

880
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:06,302
as an excuse to do absolutely
nothing with your life.

881

to blow during lunch...

It really is a shame
that you're like this,

901
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,221
because if you had
a good personality,

902

none of this other stuff
would bother people.

Why don't you use my crutch
again as a metaphor?

That was brilliant. That was masterful.

Kendal Strickland was let down.

908
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:58,212
For all the good they did, beauty and
popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.

Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?

910

Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march
of being special a little too well.

She was used to blazing her own trail.

It was obvious that Ryan

And perhaps that was unfair
to his new girlfriend,

Was it fair that people misjudged
Kendal's intelligence

01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:29,736
just because she was so beautiful?

Was it fair everyone thought her life
was so easy, when it was anything but?

No. Life wasn't fain

and make things right.

01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,478
Uh, yeah. Ooh! [Laughs]

942
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:08,396
Are you having fun? Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.

943
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,563
I think we should talk privately.

944
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,824
Sure, yeah. Um...

945
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,780
Here, follow me.

946
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,416
OK.

947
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:33,048
OK, so what's going on?

948
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,718
There are so many things
I know we both wanna say.

949
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,976
OK, well, we don't
have to say them all now.

950
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,808
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.

951
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:47,021
You're so thoughtful,
even during all this.

952
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,402
Well, hey, she pushed it out. [Chuckles]

953
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,861
I just want you to know that I'm feeling
everything that you're feeling.

954
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:58,202
Buddy, these last few days have been
some of the best in my life.

955
01:09:58,903 --> 01:09:59,950
They have?

956
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,624
You don't have to pretend.

957
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,620
I know what's in here...

958
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,837
...and I know what's in here.

959
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:17,881
Buddy... you're my moon, my stars.

960
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,173
You're my whole galaxy.

961
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,469
Mavis!
What are you doing?

962
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,392
[Scoffs]

963
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:31,818
OK.

964
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,860
You don't have to be afraid. It's OK.

965
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,995
You can come to the city with me,
like we always planned.

966
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,373
What the hell are you talking about?

967
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:46,660
We can work this out. You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.

968
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:50,672
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know. We can beat this together.

969
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,215
[Sighs]

970
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,721
You're better than this.

971
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,557
I have to go.

972
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,439
I think you should leave.

973
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,197
Hey, look who's up.

974
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,279
Hey, let me take her.

975
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:21,444
Let me... Come here.

976
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:22,954
There you are.

977
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,331
There you are. Oh...

978
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:27,709
[Buddy chuckles]

979
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,414
Can you do me a favor?

980
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:30,999
We need everybody outside.

981
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:34,712
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.

982
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,090
[Woman] Those are delicious.

983
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,391
[Jan] Hey, listen up, everyone!

984
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,402
I think Buddy has
a little surprise for Beth,

985
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:59,156
so if you could all just come outside
and gather around the garage.

986
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,317
Come on, let's go.

987
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,217
Mavis?

988
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:19,753
- What?
- Are you OK?

989
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,967
I'll be fine if I can
get a real drink around here.

990
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,800
Uh... There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.

991
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,014
You know what?

992
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,803
Oh, my God.

993
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,597
[Beth] uh... I'll...

994
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:35,230
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.

995
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:36,895
Fuck you!

996
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,860
You fucking bitch.

997
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:46,033
[laughing] Oh, my God.

998
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,657
You should see your face.

999
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,500
It's a joke.

1000
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:54,128
Are you just gonna stand there
like a big lump?

1001
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,339
I love your sweater.

1002
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,257
I'll get you a rag.

1003
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,715
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got
so many of those lying around here.

1004
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:04,097
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.

1005
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,677
You know, the funny thing is,

1006
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,184
I could have had this party
a long time ago.

1007
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,970
This exact same party. Yeah.

1008
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,014
Buddy and I were
together for four years,

1009
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,648
and we were inseparable. Jan knows.

1010
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,400
Right, Jan? Tell them!

1011
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,277
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.

1012
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,655
It is silk. It's fucked.

1013
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:21,860
Mavis, sweetheart.

1014
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,025
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.

1015
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,363
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.

1016
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,076
And we were gonna keep it!

1017
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,789
Mm-hm. We were gonna have a little baby,

1018
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,794
and a little naming party,

1019
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:39,423
and a Funquarium, and all of that.

1020
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,676
And then 12 weeks into it...

1021
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:45,964
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.

1022
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,717
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.

1023
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:55,478
Maybe if things were just
a little bit more hospitable

1024
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,143
down south in my broken body,

1025
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,562
Buddy and I would be here
right now with a teenager,

1026
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:02,526
and probably even more kids,

1027
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,782
because we always
found each other. Always!

1028
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,784
Right, Jan? Tell them!

1029
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,204
What the fuck?

1030
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,707
[Drums playing]

1031
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,294
It's a new drum set for Beth.

1032
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,339
What's wrong?

1033
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,517
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

1034
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,519
My God! What is wrong with you?

1035
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,146
Are you like one of those little kids

1036
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,398
who need a fucking chart
to learn feelings?

1037
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,025
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?

1038
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,686
That's enough, Mavis. You're drunk.

1039
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:43,229
Oh, I've been drunk
since I've been back, Mom,

1040
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:46,024
and nobody gave two shits until
this one got all bent out of shape.

1041
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,740
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?

1042
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:55,284
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.

1043
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,959
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.

1044
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:03,549
We all do, Mavis.

1045
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,632
It's obvious you're having
some mental sickness,

1046
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:07,841
some depression.

1047
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:10,006
You're very lonely and confused.

1048
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:14,177
So Beth made me invite you here,
even though I knew it was a mistake.

1049
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:16,186
I knew it.

1050
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:21,980
You're lying.

1051
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:24,694
He's not.

1052
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:39,623
Well. What about now?

1053
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:42,334
You hate me now?

1054
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,165
Hm?

1055
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,127
'Cause it should be easy,
'cause I fucking hate you.

1056
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:56,435
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?

1057
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,266
Mavis, honey.

1058
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:03,686
You know, I came back for you.
For you!

1059
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,438
And I hate this town!

1060
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:09,983
It's a hick, lake town
that smells of fish shit!

1061
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:11,822
But I came back.

1062
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,536
I just wanted you to know that.

1063
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,965
[Knocking on door]

1064
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,551
I screwed up.

1065
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:38,519
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?

1066
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,236
You're scaring me.

1067
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,028
I'm crazy.

1068
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:00,874
And no one loves me.

1069
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,082
You don't love me.

1070
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:06,964
Guys like me...

1071
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,376
...are born loving women like you.

1072
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,427
I went to Buddy's house.

1073
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:17,925
What happened?

1074
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,776
[Sobbing] I ruined my dress.

1075
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,774
[Sniffles]

1076
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:41,658
Um... I'll get you...

1077
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:43,952
I'll get you a shirt.

1078
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:47,455
No, I want yours.

1079
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:52,050
You want the shirt I'm wearing?

1080
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,960
[Whispers] Hide me.

1081
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:48,565
[Matt] It's OK.

1082
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,060
It's OK.

1083
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,660
Why Buddy?

1084
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:56,629
He's a good man. He's kind.

1085
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:02,215
Are other men unkind?

1086
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,638
He knew me when I was at my best.

1087
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:13,559
[Sighs]

1088
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:18,072
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.

1089
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,487
Not then.

1090
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:24,737
You know, I saw you every day.

1091
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:32,000
You had this little mirror
in your locker,

1092
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:34,584
shaped like a heart...

1093
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,173
...and you looked in that mirror
more than you ever looked at me,

1094
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,514
and I was at my best.

1095
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,438
[Breathes deeply]

1096
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:55,460
Good morning.

1097
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:57,792
Hi.

1098
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,003
Coffee?

1099
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,085
Sure.

1100
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:16,769
Do you still write those books?

1101
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:17,933
No.

1102
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,062
The series is over. It got cancelled.

1103
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:26,108
I'm actually writing
the last one right now.

1104
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:28,489
What happens?

1105
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:32,243
I don't know.

1106
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,372
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?

1107
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,587
She married Buddy Slade from school.

1108
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,844
Um, yeah. I know that Beth.

1109
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,721
What do you think of her?

1110
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:54,512
Um...

1111
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,437
I don't really like her.

1112
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:03,570
I mean, I think that
you're way prettier than she is.

1113
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:10,035
What happened to your dress?

1114
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,869
I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong?

1115
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,413
Shit.

1116
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:22,581
What's wrong? What did I say?

1117
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,427
[Sniffles]

1118
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:28,587
I have a lot of problems.

1119
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,516
Can't you get a new dress?

1120
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,302
It's really difficult
for me to be happy...

1121
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:43,732
...and then for other people,

1122
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,646
it just seems so simple.

1123
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:47,981
I know.

1124
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:55,157
They just grow up,
and they're so... fulfilled.

1125
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:57,784
I don't feel fulfilled.

1126
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:00,044
- Well...
- And frankly,

1127
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:03,251
if you don't feel fulfilled
with all the stuff that you have...

1128
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:14,675
I need to change, Sandra.

1129
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,976
- No, you don't.
- What?

1130
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:23,688
You're the only person
in Mercury who could write a book,

1131
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,273
or wear a dress like that.

1132
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:29,235
I'm sure there's plenty
of other people who could...

1133
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,742
Everyone here is fat and dumb.

1134
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,527
Don't say that.

1135
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:38,036
I mean, you think so?

1136
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,668
Everyone wishes that
they could be like you.

1137
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,122
You know, living in the big city,

1138
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:48,384
all famous and beautiful
and all that.

1139
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:50,715
I'm not really famous.

1140
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,630
Well, you know, special or whatever.

1141
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:56,220
I mean, some days, when I have
a slow shift at work,

1142
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:58,351
I'll sit and think about you,

1143
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,684
living in your cool apartment,
going out and stuff.

1144
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,107
It seems really nice.

1145
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:07,861
Yeah. But...

1146
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:12,984
Most people here seem
so happy with so little.

1147
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:17,826
It's like they don't even seem to care
what happens to them.

1148
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:21,288
That's because it doesn't
matter what happens to them.

1149
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:25,249
They're nothing.

1150
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,381
Might as well die.

1151
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,305
Fuck Mercury.

1152
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:46,774
Thank you.

1153
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:54,529
[Chuckles] I needed that.

1154
01:25:57,778 --> 01:25:59,325
You're right.

1155
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,328
This place blows.

1156
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,839
I need to get back to Minneapolis.

1157
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,543
Take me with you.

1158
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:14,760
Excuse me?

1159
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,927
Take me with you.

1160
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,309
You know, to the Mini Apple.

1161
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:25,143
You're good here, Sandra.

1162
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,061
Oh.

1163
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,321
[Lock beeps]

1164
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,698
Dolce.

1165
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:46,243
I'm so sorry.

1166
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:49,417
My baby. Come here.

1167
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:54,585
[Mavis] Graduation turned out to be
a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.

1168
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:57,470
While honored to be
the valedictorian of her class,

1169
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:59,723
there was an unmistakable
air of sadness

1170
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:02,430
over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.

1171
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:06,893
Who could have imagined when Ryan
and his girlfriend set sail that day,

1172
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,934
it would be the last time
anyone ever saw them?

1173
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,232
Good boy.

1174
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:15,068
Poor Ryan...

1175
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,573
Lost at sea.

1176
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:22,863
They don't need those back.

1177
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:26,617
You can put them in a scrapbook,
or whatever.

1178
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:32,539
Just so you know, those doughnuts
are for Honors Members only.

1179
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:51,601
[Tires screech]

1180
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:05,993
[Mavis] Kendal felt the weight of her
high school years lifting off of her

1181
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,579
as she emptied out her locker.

1182
01:28:08,742 --> 01:28:12,246
Sure, she'd think about Waverley
from time to time.

1183
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:15,507
Cheer squad, the debate team,

1184
01:28:15,665 --> 01:28:17,918
sneaking into the woods
for a drink after class.

1185
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,131
But her best years
were still ahead of hen

1186
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:27,761
Kendal Strickland was
ready for the world.

1187
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,806
It was time to look to the future.

1188
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,358
A new chapter.

1189
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:36,736
As she boarded the train for Cambridge,

1190
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:40,490
she took one last look
at her small town and blew it a kiss...

1191
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:42,276
[alarm chirps]

1192
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:46,538
...thinking, "Life, here I come."
