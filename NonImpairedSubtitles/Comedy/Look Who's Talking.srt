1
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:42,647
I think your bookkeeper
paid for the flatware twice.

2
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:46,802
Albert, stop.
I can't do this any more.

3
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:49,767
Mollie, I love you and you love me.

4
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:54,445
Albert, you're great in bed
and you're my biggest account . . .

5
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:56,918
. . . but you're married!

6
00:01:57,089 --> 00:02:03,244
And I'll never fall in love with
anyone else while I'm seeing you.

7
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:07,368
You know I'm leaving Beth.
It just takes time.

8
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:13,798
Every time I say the word divorce,
she loses five pounds.

9
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:17,166
I'm sorry she's bulimic.

10
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:21,641
- I can't wait for you forever.
- It's going to work out soon.

11
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:27,918
The doctor prescribed new pills
and she's starting ballet classes.

12
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:34,324
- It'll be like the playwriting.
- She knows this can't make her fat.

13
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:37,845
She said
writing made her ass spread.

14
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:42,639
Which is insane, she's got
a great ass for a 40-year-old.

15
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:46,882
I'll tell Mr. Ross to give
your account to someone else.

16
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:53,648
I won't let him. I'll never let
anyone else touch my books.

17
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:04,281
God, Mollie, I'm going to burst
if you don't kiss me soon.

18
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:48,120
Follow me. I know where I'm going.
I've got the map. Come on.

19
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:54,125
Come on, keep up, you kids.
Here we go.

20
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,724
Wait a minute, I see something.

21
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,245
I think this is it,
right over here.

22
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,766
This is definitely it.
This is the place.

23
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:09,397
Jackpot!

24
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:14,723
Right down here, kids.
Here we go.

25
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:22,523
Dig in, you kids. Here we go.

26
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:25,965
It's kind of tough here.

27
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:31,121
Oh, oh . . .

28
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:34,167
I'm in!

29
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:04,802
Are you okay?

30
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:08,166
- I broke up with George.
- Who?

31
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:15,804
George. I met him in Joe Allen's.
He turned out to be stupid.

32
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:24,800
You look lousy, doll.

33
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:30,805
- Stomach flu. It's going around.
- Nobody has the stomach flu.

34
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:34,678
They don't?
You want to hear about Albert?

35
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:38,444
- Listen to me.
- I am.

36
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:43,558
Albert's shrink said his wife would
never recover if he kept seeing me.

37
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:48,007
- He's decided to leave her.
- Albert's leaving his wife?

38
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:54,404
No, he's leaving his shrink. She was
really an obstacle between us.

39
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:58,562
Leaving his shrink?
He's supposed to leave his wife.

40
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:05,043
He's going to. He can't leave her
while she's sick. She's bulimic.

41
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:10,599
Don't give me that look.
It's a very serious disease.

42
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:44,565
What in the . . . Wait a minute.

43
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,483
I've got two of these things.
Look at that, they match.

44
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:54,121
- You ate all that already?
- How weird, I don't like ice cream.

45
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,521
- There he is.
- This is sick.

46
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:03,638
He looks so sweet with the kids.
If only Beth would stop throwing up.

47
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:09,566
Miss Popularity, you can't expect to
find a husband if you never go out.

48
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,359
- You're in every night of the week.
- Ma, it's tax season.

49
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:17,601
I was studying to pass a CPA exam, -

50
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:22,399
- and I still managed
to catch your father.

51
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,323
What if Daddy was married
when you first met him?

52
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,799
- I wouldn't have fallen for him.
- You can't control that.

53
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:36,599
Why not?
Listen, take your father here . . .

54
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:41,638
His favourite food was cheesecake,
and what did the doctor tell him?

55
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:47,008
- "Cut back on cholesterol."
- Now he doesn't eat cheesecake.

56
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,684
Ma, that doesn't make any sense.

57
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:54,888
You never used to like my food.
Something's wrong.

58
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:58,246
- Nothing's wrong.
- Louie, something's wrong.

59
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:02,197
- I didn't eat breakfast.
- Something's wrong.

60
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:10,204
No.

61
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,800
Oh, no!

62
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:18,678
- Yes!
- Oh, no!

63
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:24,287
- This wasn't a planned pregnancy?
- This wasn't even a planned affair.

64
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,761
Well . . .
Iet's see how far along we are.

65
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:39,120
Time out! Holy cow,
what was that? Who's that?

66
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,406
How could this have happened?

67
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:47,040
- How old are you now, Mollie?
- 33.

68
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:51,327
Remember,
your biological clock is ticking.

69
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:06,322
Beth finally agreed to a divorce.
Mollie, I'm so glad you waited.

70
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:11,438
I knew if I was patient,
this day would come.

71
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:18,566
Remember your biological clock.

72
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:38,400
My biological clock is ticking . . .

73
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:42,164
I know, I've already said that.
I didn't plan on this.

74
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:46,083
I'm not asking for anything.
I don't want to trap you.

75
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:51,767
But this baby . . . it's you and
me, and I'm not getting an abortion.

76
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:57,959
I wasn't going to ask you to.
This will be an incredible baby.

77
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:03,522
He'll have your sweet face
and my business sense.

78
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:08,126
- We'll get little Armani diapers.
- It will be a great kid.

79
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:12,202
Having my baby
what a way to say you love me

80
00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:16,806
Albert, you're making me sick.
I hate that song.

81
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:21,357
Stop singing.
She gets sick, I get sick.

82
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:24,965
What are you going to tell people?

83
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:28,007
That I got artificially inseminated.

84
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:33,641
What?
How could you do such a thing?

85
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,848
I went to the clinic
and bought some frozen sperm.

86
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:43,800
- I inserted it, now I'm pregnant.
- Where's the frozen pop?

87
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:49,566
- There's no frozen pop.
- There's no husband.

88
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:53,358
I control my life
and I want to have a baby.

89
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:57,920
This kind of thing a girl does
if she's very ugly or a lesbian.

90
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,526
This is not the act
of a beautiful intelligent girl.

91
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:06,967
You never liked
any of my boyfriends, anyway.

92
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:11,884
- Where did this sperm come from?
- A medical student.

93
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:16,327
He goes to Columbia.
His parents live on the lsland.

94
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:20,767
His father's in piece goods.
His mother works in cosmetics.

95
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:24,558
So you're making fun of me.
Wait, you'll see.

96
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:28,278
Someday you'll have children.

97
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:45,044
Look . . . an arm. It's an arm.

98
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:51,045
Look . . . isn't it cute?

99
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:13,126
Here's the head . . . isn't it?

100
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:29,281
Get some apple juice down here!

101
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:39,117
- Thirsty?
- Go ahead.

102
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:44,682
"The sex organs are moulded
out of similar tissue folds."

103
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:48,808
"By the second trimester
they are identifiable."

104
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:52,484
Look, another arm
coming in down there . . .

105
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,927
How am I going to get that
in my mouth?

106
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:02,963
Miss, excuse me . . .

107
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:07,445
- What can I do for you?
- Albert is expecting me.

108
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:13,320
He's in with his decorator.
You can wait over there.

109
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:21,639
- I think you're going to enjoy it.
- I'm sure I will.

110
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:25,927
- Remember to dust it every day.
- See you later.

111
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:29,479
Hi, come on in.

112
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:42,006
Albert, was that woman pretty?

113
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:46,959
- No, you're pretty.
- I look like a big, fat pilgrim.

114
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:50,519
How do you like the desk?

115
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:54,602
- It's made of stone.
- It's all right.

116
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:59,160
It's going to be great in here.
This is all going.

117
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm having a custom-made mural
of an ancient Navajo design.

118
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:08,485
Leather craftsmen in Mexico
are going to make all new couches.

119
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:15,639
- What do you think?
- I like the deco stuff.

120
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:20,929
- Don't gain too much weight.
- My doctor says my weight is fine.

121
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:27,688
Beth only gained 21 pounds.
She jogged three miles a day.

122
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:31,398
- Maybe you should marry her.
- Don't start.

123
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:37,724
- I've got problems, too.
- Sorry. I'm afraid of giving birth.

124
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:41,962
- I've never been real big on pain.
- You been to Lamaze?

125
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:45,644
I quit.
It's just a bunch of breathing.

126
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:49,882
It's so much better for the baby.
When Beth had Priscilla . . .

127
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:53,928
I'm so sick of hearing about Beth!

128
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:58,241
How could you be in love with her
and then in love with me?

129
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:01,765
I have a degree.
She took belly-dancing lessons.

130
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:07,322
When I found out I was pregnant,
I decided to make out a will.

131
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:12,483
When Beth had the girls, she had
a reading of their past lives.

132
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:18,997
- And you're still with her!
- Oh yeah? Look at this receipt.

133
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:23,003
- Galleria Apartments.
- I moved out. I did it.

134
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:26,206
I put down a deposit this morning.

135
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:30,959
I can't believe it!
Should I come by tonight?

136
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:34,838
You'd better not.
We've still got to be careful.

137
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:39,321
Albert, I'm so happy!

138
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:47,885
I wonder if this store
has a bathroom. I have to go again.

139
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:54,679
I love this . . . Look,
it takes two of them to cover me.

140
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:58,762
- Yeah, but you're having a baby.
- You try it on.

141
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:03,241
- Should I have a baby with Neal?
- Do you love him?

142
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:06,128
No.

143
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:11,841
Try some of that
Nobel Prize winners' sperm.

144
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,001
Don't you want a smart baby?

145
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:20,960
That's all I need. A baby
telling me what an idiot I am.

146
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:26,601
- I found a nice family man.
- Except it's someone else's family.

147
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:31,399
That's why he left.
He loves me and we're having baby.

148
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:36,597
It sounds like the people
in the next compartment are.

149
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:49,525
- Mollie!
- Albert!

150
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:54,968
- Let me explain . . .
- These dresses aren't paid for.

151
00:16:55,129 --> 00:17:00,886
- Don't take this shit from him.
- I'm going to call the cops.

152
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:03,688
After you. Thank you.

153
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:07,967
- Albert, what's going on?
- Mollie, I've fallen in love.

154
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:11,804
Beth knows.
I'm going to live with Melissa.

155
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:16,759
I don't know if it'll last.
It just happened.

156
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:20,046
Why didn't you say anything to me?

157
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:23,997
You were so close
to the end of your pregnancy.

158
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,842
I don't believe this is happening.

159
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:31,366
This sounds awful, but
I'm going through a selfish phase.

160
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:35,522
- A selfish phase?
- I admit the timing is bad.

161
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:39,602
- A selfish phase?
- It just happened.

162
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:43,842
A selfish phase!
Albert, you dick.

163
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:48,878
- You lousy prick!
- Leave him alone.

164
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:52,644
- Come on.
- Here.

165
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:55,642
Hey, what the . . .

166
00:17:56,449 --> 00:18:01,398
- Wait, please, I'm in labour.
- I was here first.

167
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:07,479
Asshole! Taxi! Please . . .

168
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:16,401
St. Jerome's Hospital.

169
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:19,723
Oh, shit!

170
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:28,806
- Slow down! It can take hours.
- So can the midtown traffic.

171
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,248
Pull over till the ludes wear off.

172
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:48,362
God, you idiot!

173
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:52,078
Come on, move it.

174
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:59,760
Christ, this traffic . . .
We're going as fast as we can.

175
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:05,479
Hold onto my hand. Bear down, that's
what they say in the hospital.

176
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:12,441
- Come on, move it.
- God, my water just broke.

177
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:17,888
- Hey, buddy, move it.
- You can't get through here.

178
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:22,247
- I've got an emergency.
- Sorry, buddy, move it.

179
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:30,002
Just relax.
Hold on, we're almost there.

180
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,366
Look out! You're going to hit . . !

181
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:40,646
Hold on!

182
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:45,407
You stupid son of a . . !

183
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:49,807
- Are you doing your Lamaze?
- Look out!

184
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:57,601
- Breathe deep.
- Don't try to help, just drive!

185
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:02,598
You've got to use Lamaze.
My sister-in-law used it.

186
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:06,967
- It's better for the kid.
- All men are stupid idiots.

187
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:13,404
- Should I call your husband?
- I don't have a husband.

188
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:17,562
- I was artificially inseminated.
- Are you a lesbo?

189
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:39,801
Stupid jerk! My kid will probably
be brain damaged because of you.

190
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:45,886
Don't touch me! I'll have this baby
without you touching me.

191
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:52,564
- Excuse me, I'm in labour.
- Do you have your medical card?

192
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:57,439
- I left it at home.
- I have to have your medical card.

193
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:02,637
- This is my first baby.
- She's getting close. Upstairs.

194
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:07,644
You didn't finish this.
I cannot do my job . . .

195
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:14,044
- Put these on over your clothes.
- I'm not the father.

196
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:20,045
- Nurse, another one's coming.
- Deep breaths, come on.

197
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:23,406
Okay, this'll pass. Watch the head.

198
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:27,608
God! I need some drugs.

199
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:32,081
- Slow down your breathing.
- Fuck my breathing!

200
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:37,562
- You've got to calm down.
- Get me some drugs.

201
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:42,405
- No, you don't want drugs.
- I do. I'm going to split in two.

202
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:46,881
By the time they
take effect she could be delivering.

203
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:51,964
- But what about now?
- I'm waiting for a doctor.

204
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:58,006
Are you a doctor? Come on.

205
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,408
- Water break?
- Half an hour ago.

206
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:09,802
- Are we doing our Lamaze breathing?
- I dropped out of Lamaze.

207
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:13,848
I'll go to summer school
if you make the pain stop.

208
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:18,525
- How about some Demerol?
- God, that'd be great!

209
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:23,479
I'd like some of that.
Give me a lot of it.

210
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:26,880
So it doesn't wear off
during the birth.

211
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:32,840
I think maybe I'm in a bit more pain
than most of your patients.

212
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:36,319
Be sure and give me enough.

213
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:41,722
- There we go.
- Thank you a really lot.

214
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:45,802
That is a little more like it.

215
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:49,803
Hey, here's Mr. Hand here.

216
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:56,083
Now that is very cosmic.
I don't understand . . .

217
00:22:56,249 --> 00:23:00,686
What's that light down there?

218
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:05,478
That's it, breathe!

219
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:10,200
Attagirl, push. One more.

220
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:14,408
Stop with that pushing!
I'm falling!

221
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:21,845
Help!

222
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:27,879
No, put me back in! Let go
of my head and put me back inside!

223
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:30,040
It's a boy.

224
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:33,007
It's a boy.

225
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:38,197
Who are you?
Lady, I'm freezing. I'm so cold.

226
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:41,918
Get that thing away from me.

227
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:46,082
- You want to do the cord?
- No, you take this one.

228
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:49,480
I need that!

229
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:54,359
Lady, a blanket,
something, I'm frosty out here.

230
00:23:57,129 --> 00:24:00,838
No, don't do that!

231
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:08,564
Where are we going now?
Hey, don't drop me.

232
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:13,484
Oh, very nice . . .

233
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:24,324
I don't know about you,
but I'm beat.

234
00:24:24,489 --> 00:24:28,118
So you're the one
that's been kicking me.

235
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,759
You're the one
that ate the spicy food.

236
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:39,846
This is the weirdest thing that's
ever happened to me . . . so far.

237
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:48,646
I don't get it. I just don't
get it. Where did I go wrong?

238
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:54,202
Where are my thumbs?
I want to suck my thumbs.

239
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:59,887
- I have to get my own place.
- I've been reincarnated so quickly?

240
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:03,359
What a surprise!

241
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:08,125
Who stole my sucking thing?
I need my sucking thing!

242
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:11,361
I just remembered
I hate childhood.

243
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:22,761
Look at all those daddies.

244
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:29,448
Making goofball faces
and taking pictures of their babies.

245
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:32,601
You won't find your father here.

246
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:36,444
I really messed things up for you.

247
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:41,683
Don't be upset.
I'm going to find you a daddy.

248
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:45,637
And not just some handsome guy
I'm in love with.

249
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:52,806
You're all that matters to me.
I'll get you the best daddy ever.

250
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:03,681
Out, down, in, out . . .
Well, we got that.

251
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:07,125
What have you got there?
A hand?

252
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:10,201
Yeah, two of them.

253
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,801
Oh, my God!

254
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:31,082
"On the third or fourth day
your breasts may swell slightly."

255
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:35,720
Slightly?
I look like a Russ Meyer movie.

256
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:45,522
Workman.

257
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:50,558
- Oh, no! Sorry.
- Real nice.

258
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:57,044
- You got your figure back.
- This is not my figure.

259
00:26:57,209 --> 00:27:01,248
Sorry I hit you and yelled at you,
but I was in a lot of pain.

260
00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:07,245
I still owe you that cab fare,
but somebody stole my purse.

261
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:11,721
- How do you like New York so far?
- It's my kind of town.

262
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:17,441
I'll get you the rest later . . .
Wait a minute . . .

263
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:22,808
- How did you know where I lived?
- You left it in the cab.

264
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:26,120
Thanks.

265
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:31,204
You should look through that thing.
You've still got your diaphragm.

266
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:39,926
Don't smoke that around my baby.

267
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:45,243
There's a 62% higher rate of cancer
in people who live with smokers.

268
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:50,563
What are you trying to say?
You don't want me to move in yet?

269
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:55,120
Do you think the drugs
had any effect on him?

270
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:59,441
- How did you know I had drugs?
- I don't. I didn't.

271
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:02,806
You can tell in his eyes.
He looks stoned.

272
00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:10,398
- He does not. He looks perfect.
- You don't look so hot yourself.

273
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:16,485
If you tried passing a watermelon,
how hot would you look?

274
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:20,847
Ouch! I should call
my mother more often. Get it?

275
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:25,719
- Do you want a sub?
- No, will you just watch him?

276
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:31,122
Don't take him out of his chair
and don't touch him a whole lot.

277
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:34,917
Hi, Mikey. I'm James.

278
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:41,085
- Good to meet you.
- Do you mind if I suck on that?

279
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:47,768
- How long have you been here?
- About five years.

280
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:54,721
- Were you born in New York?
- Are you with the census bureau?

281
00:28:54,889 --> 00:29:01,840
How do you like the outside world?
It's weird, isn't it?

282
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:07,766
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- Here, your first lesson in coffee.

283
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:12,878
- Can you say black coffee?
- No.

284
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:18,328
Regular coffee has two sugars and
milk . . . which they have forgotten.

285
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:25,361
Can I borrow some of yours?
Coffee regular, I love it.

286
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:28,839
That's breast milk.

287
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:33,843
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You're on your own.

288
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:36,967
I'll see you guys later.

289
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:43,443
I'm going to take my sub and
my breast milk and get out of here.

290
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:47,602
I've got something
cold and wet in my shorts.

291
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:52,559
Could you get somebody for me?
Fellas?

292
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:58,884
You guys are no help. I'm cold and
wet and there's nothing I can do.

293
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:03,804
It's okay, Mikey. Mommy's here.

294
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:09,202
That Mommy person's here again.
She's okay. I like her.

295
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:15,966
I start crying
and she comes in with a bottle.

296
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:19,121
Crying, I can handle that.

297
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:03,247
Taxi!

298
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:09,445
Taxi!

299
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:34,002
"80% of all women experience
post-partum depression."

300
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:36,160
I won't.

301
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:44,966
Like a lot of parents, I can't
always be there on birthdays.

302
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:50,920
Help, somebody burp me
before I blow up.

303
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:59,087
That's it! You have some exotic
disease and I look like a zombie.

304
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:04,277
And your father deserted us so he
could pork his interior decorator.

305
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:08,488
I think you can safely say
that it can't get any worse.

306
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:13,325
- Hello!
- I was wrong.

307
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:18,324
Where's my grandson?

308
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:20,923
There he is.

309
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:28,885
- Mikey, do you know who I am?
- No, actually, I don't.

310
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:33,679
- I'm your grandma.
- Okay, if you say so.

311
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:37,205
- Yes, I am.
- What do you want from me?

312
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:45,001
- Who's got a wet tushy?
- I give up.

313
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:53,881
After a new diaper, I like
some of that white stuff on me.

314
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:58,918
If you had a man instead of a frozen
pop, all this would be put together.

315
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:04,004
You make it sound like I had
an affair with a frozen dessert.

316
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:07,844
- You look awful.
- Thank you.

317
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:11,001
You're using too much powder.

318
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:17,244
Why don't you get out of the house?
I'm going to give Mikey a bath.

319
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:19,877
A what?

320
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:24,199
She's gone!

321
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:35,608
Who would you want
as your child's father?

322
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:39,364
Someone with a small mouth
and good hair . . .

323
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:45,764
- A guy to help raise your child.
- Are there men who do that?

324
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:50,525
I'm looking for a guy
who's not married, -

325
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:55,558
- not into drugs, not a deadbeat,
but not a workaholic.

326
00:33:55,729 --> 00:34:01,759
- And cute.
- Cute is of no importance.

327
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:04,602
You're my first date
since my baby was born.

328
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:08,239
This looks delicious.

329
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:13,437
What is this?
I asked for well done. This is raw.

330
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:17,602
I asked for no dressing,
this is covered with slop.

331
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:23,480
Are you deaf or something?
Who do I have to kill to get a roll?

332
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:30,487
What's this "C" in algebra?
How many times did we go over it?

333
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:33,163
Are you an idiot?

334
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:40,326
Dating is difficult, but you've got
to take a chance in life sometime.

335
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:44,402
I'm not so sure about that.
Excuse me.

336
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:50,565
This fork and this plate are dirty,
and there's something in the water.

337
00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:53,402
Check your water.

338
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:59,883
Mikey, what is this mess?
Sort out these socks.

339
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:04,327
Why are school shirts
mixed up with after-school shirts?

340
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:07,242
Straighten this up properly.

341
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:17,042
- Hi.
- Hey.

342
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:21,327
- Somebody call for a cab?
- Yeah, small world.

343
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:25,687
More mail for Vincent Ubriacco.
I don't even know this guy.

344
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:31,003
Let me have them. Put them up here,
the postman will take care of them.

345
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:37,438
- It's good seeing you again.
- You, too. See you.

346
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:45,041
- You're stealing my mail!
- I'm not stealing your mail.

347
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:48,918
- You put it in your pocket!
- These are mine.

348
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:54,209
- I sent them here. I'll explain.
- I'm going to call the police.

349
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:58,362
My grandfather Vincent
needs an old-age home -

350
00:35:58,529 --> 00:36:04,399
- and there's a place in Manhattan,
but he needs to be a resident.

351
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:07,561
You want to use my mailing address?

352
00:36:07,729 --> 00:36:13,281
I could have you arrested. Screwing
with the mail is a federal offence.

353
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:17,124
Stealing mail is,
not screwing with it.

354
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:22,568
- Can I get the other letters?
- No, I don't want to get involved.

355
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:27,325
I went out of my way
to bring you back your purse.

356
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:32,722
Thank you very much,
but this happens to be illegal.

357
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:37,883
You're not going to get caught.
I'll do something for you, okay.

358
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:41,803
- I'll baby-sit.
- Come on . . .

359
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:46,918
- You don't know about babies.
- My sister has kids.

360
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:51,640
- I know a lot about babies.
- All right, Friday night.

361
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:57,202
- No can do, Friday's out.
- Then forget the whole deal.

362
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:02,762
- Okay, Friday, but that's it.
- And during my aerobics classes.

363
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,046
- One aerobics class.
- Saturday.

364
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:08,564
Can't do. I teach.

365
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:11,880
What do you teach?
Taxi driver's ed?

366
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:15,724
- That's not funny.
- Here's the deal.

367
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:21,088
Friday nights, two aerobics classes,
and you can't bring chicks over.

368
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:25,720
You're pushing it.
All right, it's a deal.

369
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:28,767
- Sucker.
- Good.

370
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:33,047
- Don't force-feed him like that.
- I'm not!

371
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:38,363
- Why don't you take a nap?
- He doesn't need a nap.

372
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:42,966
- He knows when he's tired.
- I'm not tired at all.

373
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:47,559
If he doesn't take a nap -

374
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:52,439
- he will wake up and want
to eat when it's time to sleep.

375
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:56,124
- Who says?
- All those doctors.

376
00:37:56,289 --> 00:38:00,965
- They just want to sell books.
- Dr. Spock is not like that.

377
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:05,964
Dr. Spock loves us. He protested
during the Vietnam war.

378
00:38:06,129 --> 00:38:10,168
I'm sorry I said anything
about Dr. Spock.

379
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,766
I can't believe she's getting
upset about a Vulcan.

380
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:21,448
- Have you got any other letters?
- They're in the hallway.

381
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:37,963
Mommy's asleep. Watch this.

382
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:09,044
What do you say you and me take
a ride so your mother can sleep?

383
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:15,364
- Is that a deal?
- Just bring the milk.

384
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:19,568
See that? That's my cab.

385
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:24,200
I do this to make money,
but not for long.

386
00:39:28,129 --> 00:39:31,883
Okay, this is called driving.

387
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:36,088
When you get older,
I'll teach you how.

388
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:40,800
First, you put the little stick
in the hole.

389
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:45,167
Then you move your foot
back and forth. Okay, what next?

390
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:48,082
You move the big circle around.

391
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:52,447
No problem, I can do this.
I can drive.

392
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,964
- Hey.
- Hey, Jimmy.

393
00:40:17,129 --> 00:40:20,280
That silver plane is a VJ-1 0.

394
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:23,361
That big plane is a Viscount.

395
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:27,408
- Hey, Carrie.
- What a sweetie.

396
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:31,005
- Is it yours?
- Yeah, but he needs a mother.

397
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:36,727
I'm kidding. Is this my schedule?

398
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:42,202
- There's nothing on it.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:47,124
Do these things come in different
sizes? What are these, jumbos?

400
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:52,409
- What are you staring at?
- Lunch.

401
00:40:56,969 --> 00:40:59,767
Mikey?

402
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:05,126
Mikey?

403
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:20,044
I want to report a missing baby.

404
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:24,725
Maybe he was kidnapped,
or maybe he's with a complete idiot!

405
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:27,767
Hey, Grandpa.

406
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:30,397
That's Grandpa.

407
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:33,561
Do I know you?

408
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:44,845
- Jimmy!
- Grandpa.

409
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:50,003
- I don't remember your baby.
- It's a friend of mine's.

410
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:54,640
- You sure it isn't yours?
- I've got more teeth than him.

411
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:59,246
What are those hairy jobs
over your eyes?

412
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:03,880
Let me see those things.
There we go. How does that feel?

413
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:08,839
- Mikey, lay off him.
- What a crack-up.

414
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:12,841
- Honey, I'm home.
- Me, too.

415
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:20,085
- Hey, you're up.
- My baby! Honey, honey . . .

416
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:23,241
Mommy and her baby . . .

417
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:29,326
Idiot! I called the police.
I was worried out of my mind.

418
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:34,404
- You knew I was with him.
- You might be a kidnapper.

419
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:39,438
- I was baby-sitting for you.
- That means the baby stays here!

420
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:42,442
Damn it! I got a splinter.

421
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:45,521
Let me see it.

422
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:49,921
- Have you got a needle?
- In there.

423
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:55,082
Sit down.

424
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:58,800
Oh, stop.

425
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:03,247
If you don't hold still,
I can't do this. It doesn't hurt.

426
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:06,845
It hurts. Don't do it that way.

427
00:43:07,009 --> 00:43:11,799
- You're poking me!
- Hold still while I get it out.

428
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:16,008
- It can't hurt that much.
- How would you know?

429
00:43:16,169 --> 00:43:22,244
- Look at that. That's a big one.
- I've never had one that big in me.

430
00:43:24,889 --> 00:43:29,758
- All better.
- Mikey needs a nap.

431
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:36,918
Mikey, I've got to go.
See you.

432
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:44,803
Ready? High-five.
Low-five. Baby-five. Bye.

433
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:50,521
- Bye.
- My little angel-head.

434
00:43:56,609 --> 00:44:01,046
- Mollie, who was that?
- The babysitter.

435
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:06,602
The babysitter?
He's not the frozen pop, is he?

436
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:10,557
- Ma!
- All right, give me the baby.

437
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,839
- Ma . . .
- What?

438
00:45:22,009 --> 00:45:26,878
- You ever get bored with Daddy?
- How can I get bored with Daddy?

439
00:45:35,289 --> 00:45:38,008
Mikey needs a father.

440
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:42,959
- I just can't find the right guy.
- Mikey will like whoever you like.

441
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:47,600
- I don't like anybody.
- You know what the secret is?

442
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:53,287
Find someone you have something
in common with, like Daddy and me.

443
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:59,524
We both like to go to the movies.
I know someone perfect for you.

444
00:45:59,689 --> 00:46:08,006
He's in Daddy's firm. He's handsome
and smart. You'll love him.

445
00:46:09,009 --> 00:46:12,763
Hello! Rosie didn't tell me
you were beautiful.

446
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:17,241
I'm surprised, that's usually
the first thing she says.

447
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:19,525
Come on in.

448
00:46:19,689 --> 00:46:25,685
This is my son Michael. I'll get
dressed. Make yourself comfortable.

449
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:29,808
- Hi, little guy.
- Who's this yutz?

450
00:46:29,969 --> 00:46:33,439
Are you watching some TV?

451
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:37,761
Don't touch that.
I don't want to watch football.

452
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:42,366
Hey, it's the bear show.
Look at that.

453
00:46:42,529 --> 00:46:48,126
- Leave it on football.
- Leave it alone.

454
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:52,282
- That guy's a good actor.
- Cut it out. It's the play-offs!

455
00:46:56,529 --> 00:46:58,759
You dick.

456
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:07,444
- Baby! Hot mama!
- You're such a goofball.

457
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:11,443
- Don't I look good?
- You look slightly cute.

458
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:15,727
- What are you all dressed up for?
- I've got a hot date.

459
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:19,518
You'd better call her.
I'm going to be late.

460
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:24,126
Yeah, right. You've got a date
with an accountant. 9:30 tops.

461
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:27,918
- Don't count on it.
- Besides, my woman will wait.

462
00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:32,162
Harry, this is the babysitter.
I'll just get my coat.

463
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:37,926
- I'm just watching the game here.
- Yeah, I've got money on this game.

464
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:42,480
So you're an accountant?
You and Mollie will get along great.

465
00:47:42,649 --> 00:47:47,040
- She's a CPA.
- I know, her mom told me.

466
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:50,918
It's got to be tough
being a mom and a CPA.

467
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:57,528
But Mollie is tough. She hates it
when guys open doors for her -

468
00:47:57,689 --> 00:48:02,160
- or pick up the tab.
It really pisses her off.

469
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:07,039
- She's liberated?
- Come on. A guy babysitter?

470
00:48:07,209 --> 00:48:12,283
Come here, Mikey.
Say bye-bye to Mama.

471
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:16,203
- Do this.
- Jeez!

472
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:20,282
Give it back.
This is really embarrassing.

473
00:48:20,449 --> 00:48:23,805
May I just say one thing?

474
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:27,359
- You look better without it.
- I think so, too.

475
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:30,248
- Sexy.
- Yeah.

476
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:35,085
- All right, I'll leave it off.
- Great.

477
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:41,768
Bye-bye. See you.
Mikey, high-five.

478
00:48:41,929 --> 00:48:45,444
- Yeah, all right.
- Who was that clown?

479
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:51,087
It was very uncomfortable.

480
00:48:51,249 --> 00:48:56,801
A kind of bloated, gassy . . .
belchy sensation.

481
00:48:57,129 --> 00:49:02,078
I'd sit down in the bathroom . . .
and nothing would happen.

482
00:49:02,249 --> 00:49:05,047
Nothing would come out.

483
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:10,363
I called my doctor about two . . .

484
00:49:10,529 --> 00:49:13,680
. . . three weeks after this started.

485
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:19,481
He said I'd better come in
and have an ultrasound.

486
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:23,924
- What was I saying?
- Ultrasound.

487
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:28,640
So I went in for the ultrasound
and they checked it out.

488
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:33,929
It wasn't gallstones.
They didn't know what it was.

489
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:39,800
The doctor said I'd better have
an upper G. I. So I went in again.

490
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:44,679
- Have you ever had a barium enema?
- Not recently.

491
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:48,683
It's disgusting,
but I did get to see my colon on TV.

492
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:54,719
Is it true that colons
look 1 0 pounds heavier on TV?

493
00:49:54,969 --> 00:49:56,925
How so?

494
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:05,040
They never do that for me.

495
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:18,642
Get on my knee.

496
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:29,328
- Hold it. Okay.
- Get down, Mikey.

497
00:50:33,049 --> 00:50:36,724
Yeah, I can do that.

498
00:50:38,009 --> 00:50:41,843
Let's walk.

499
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:48,682
I'm dancing. I'm bad.

500
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:52,125
- Check me out now.
- Jump.

501
00:50:56,329 --> 00:50:59,480
Hey, can I get paid?

502
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:14,281
Two, please.

503
00:51:19,129 --> 00:51:22,326
Are you ready?

504
00:51:26,009 --> 00:51:29,684
I'm gonna throw up,
but I like it!

505
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:32,841
Okay, shake it up.

506
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:37,247
Right on.

507
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:43,479
Ready? Shake it, Mikey.

508
00:51:45,129 --> 00:51:48,439
Let's go.

509
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:54,839
Aeroplane.

510
00:51:56,369 --> 00:51:59,520
Mikey's a plane.
Look at that boy.

511
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:03,841
All right.

512
00:52:07,049 --> 00:52:10,041
Finally, I passed the stone.

513
00:52:10,209 --> 00:52:14,088
It's the most excruciating thing
you can have, next to giving birth.

514
00:52:14,249 --> 00:52:17,719
- I had a really good time tonight.
- I bet you did.

515
00:52:17,889 --> 00:52:24,727
A lot of guys would feel threatened
by a woman always wanting to pay.

516
00:52:24,889 --> 00:52:28,165
- What?
- Your babysitter told me.

517
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:31,048
- He did, did he?
- Yeah.

518
00:52:31,209 --> 00:52:35,441
- Come here.
- No, I really have to go up.

519
00:52:35,609 --> 00:52:41,400
- Come on, Mollie, it's early.
- Yeah, but I'm broke.

520
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:44,083
Jerk.

521
00:52:49,409 --> 00:52:53,084
Shit!

522
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:09,884
I'm home.

523
00:53:10,049 --> 00:53:14,839
You can go on your date now.

524
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:45,205
- Hey, Mikey!
- Sarah, how are you doing?

525
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:48,361
- I want to talk to you.
- Sorry, got to go.

526
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:53,881
Right back at you, babe.

527
00:53:54,049 --> 00:54:00,238
- Hiya, Mickey.
- Look at that hat.

528
00:54:01,729 --> 00:54:06,484
- Megan, good to see you.
- Mikey, where've you been?

529
00:54:06,649 --> 00:54:10,801
- Did you get your hair cut?
- Yeah, what do you think?

530
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:14,678
I hate it.
My mother did it herself.

531
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:18,398
It looks great.

532
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:21,561
I used to have curls at the end.

533
00:54:21,729 --> 00:54:25,517
- I remember.
- I was the one with the cute curls.

534
00:54:25,689 --> 00:54:30,080
- Now they're gone.
- You're still cute.

535
00:54:30,249 --> 00:54:34,959
- I look like a boy. No offence.
- Nice talking to you.

536
00:54:39,649 --> 00:54:45,884
How many babies does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

537
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:51,646
- How many?
- What's a light bulb?

538
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:56,600
I don't get it.

539
00:54:56,769 --> 00:55:00,967
Where's she going?
Who's that big guy?

540
00:55:01,129 --> 00:55:06,965
- Who is he?
- That's okay. That's her daddy.

541
00:55:07,129 --> 00:55:09,962
What's a daddy? What do they do?

542
00:55:10,129 --> 00:55:14,998
The big men types
who hang around with the mommies.

543
00:55:15,169 --> 00:55:18,684
I get it. Maybe I'll ask James
to be my daddy.

544
00:55:27,169 --> 00:55:31,765
We 'll eat all the pudding now . . .

545
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:38,846
- I still ain't eating it.
- Yummy.

546
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:46,478
All right, don't look at Mommy.

547
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:03,087
You've got to love her.

548
00:56:20,649 --> 00:56:24,119
Watch this, Mikey.

549
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:37,599
- Now that's entertainment.
- Not in front of Mikey.

550
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:42,638
- Look at the look on his face.
- He looks like his father.

551
00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:46,119
You said
you were artificially inseminated.

552
00:56:46,289 --> 00:56:51,124
I was, but I never make that face.
I assume his father does.

553
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:55,248
You know what I thought
you'd enjoy doing today?

554
00:56:55,409 --> 00:57:00,244
- Go to my grandfather's new home.
- You thought I'd enjoy that?

555
00:57:00,409 --> 00:57:05,119
Yeah, you'd enjoy it . . .
Maybe you'd sign a few papers.

556
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:09,805
You are such a baby. If you want me
to do something, just ask.

557
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:15,601
Would you please come with me
to sign these papers?

558
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:19,682
- That's how you handle a woman.
- Really?

559
00:57:24,529 --> 00:57:28,522
You want to go to lunch
at North Eastern Life lnsurance?

560
00:57:28,689 --> 00:57:32,762
- Employees get free lunches.
- We'll get caught.

561
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:36,808
I must know 20 ways
to get a free lunch in this town.

562
00:57:36,969 --> 00:57:39,961
- You do this a lot?
- Sure.

563
00:57:40,129 --> 00:57:46,318
I don't pay for L. D.'s, either.
Long distance phone calls.

564
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:49,447
I go up to a company receptionist.

565
00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:56,401
I pretend I'm a lost messenger,
and they let me use their phone.

566
00:57:57,209 --> 00:58:01,805
I wouldn't be driving this cab
if I made more instructing.

567
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:07,282
- What do flight instructors make?
- If I hustle, about 1 , 1 00 . . .

568
00:58:07,449 --> 00:58:13,126
. . . a month.
But I get to accumulate air time.

569
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:20,957
- Give me my bag!
- He's not stealing our bags.

570
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:25,008
- I've got my teeth in there.
- They're coming with us.

571
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:28,764
Tell him not to touch my teeth.

572
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:36,197
Welcome, gramps.

573
00:58:36,369 --> 00:58:41,489
- Are we stopping for a bite to eat?
- No, this is your new place.

574
00:58:41,649 --> 00:58:45,437
- They got good shrimp here?
- And lobster.

575
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:49,158
This is it. Enjoy your stay.

576
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:52,366
Grandpa, this is great.

577
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:57,649
You've got a terrific view.
No roommate to bug you. Television.

578
00:58:57,809 --> 00:59:00,607
Can I talk to you for a minute?

579
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:06,048
He's got a sweet tooth.
Give him one candy bar a day.

580
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:12,398
- Just don't let him find the bag.
- No problem.

581
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:14,639
That smells good.

582
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:20,884
- Grandpa, that smells good.
- I'd like to see you eat it.

583
00:59:21,049 --> 00:59:23,609
Watch this.

584
00:59:26,049 --> 00:59:29,519
Let me try that.

585
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:35,602
- What do you want?
- Mollie helped us get this place.

586
00:59:35,769 --> 00:59:42,004
The woman has thousands more nerves
in the sexual organs than the man.

587
00:59:42,169 --> 00:59:47,084
- I bet the kid's not even yours.
- That's it! Be nice.

588
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:54,118
He's worse at this than I am.
Let me give you a hand.

589
00:59:54,289 --> 00:59:57,361
Come on, taste it.

590
00:59:57,529 --> 00:59:59,406
Open wide.

591
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:06,121
- Thank you for helping me.
- You're welcome.

592
01:00:06,289 --> 01:00:10,077
- You want to go flying?
- That would be way too expensive.

593
01:00:10,249 --> 01:00:15,767
- Maintenance flights are free.
- You get everything for free.

594
01:00:15,929 --> 01:00:20,400
Free phone calls, free lunches . . .
You're a scam artist.

595
01:00:20,569 --> 01:00:26,678
I've got the town wired. If we were
poor, we'd still live like kings.

596
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:30,524
- Fly with me.
- I'm not that kind of person.

597
01:00:30,689 --> 01:00:35,285
- Come on. Are you scared?
- No, I'm not scared!

598
01:00:36,289 --> 01:00:40,919
- Where are the parachutes?
- There are no parachutes.

599
01:00:41,089 --> 01:00:46,447
Didn't you ever see
"The Buddy Holly Story", "La Bamba"?

600
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:51,160
There's one big difference.
They were rock legends. You're not.

601
01:00:53,369 --> 01:00:57,248
- Is your wing smoking?
- No . . . Oh, my God!

602
01:00:57,409 --> 01:01:02,164
- It was just a joke to relax you.
- I'm just so nervous.

603
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:05,127
I feel so out of control.

604
01:01:05,289 --> 01:01:11,125
I'll give you your first lesson.
Put your hand on my stick.

605
01:01:11,289 --> 01:01:15,919
- I'm not touching your stick.
- This is not a sexual thing.

606
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,683
That feels good, baby.

607
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:22,683
Get familiar with the stick.

608
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:27,764
- There you go, you're flying.
- I'm flying!

609
01:01:27,929 --> 01:01:33,765
I'm doing a good job. This is easy!
What a good sensation!

610
01:01:33,929 --> 01:01:39,526
- It's like great sex, isn't it?
- I personally wouldn't remember.

611
01:01:39,849 --> 01:01:44,365
- He's pretty tired.
- He's had a busy day.

612
01:01:48,049 --> 01:01:53,442
- Do you want a drink?
- Do you want to watch a movie?

613
01:02:47,009 --> 01:02:49,079
Stop it!

614
01:02:49,289 --> 01:02:54,443
Stop yelling or your father will
give you something to yell about.

615
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:58,204
Knock it off!

616
01:02:58,369 --> 01:03:03,238
Princess,
you're making my mouth water.

617
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:05,525
I'm hungry.

618
01:03:05,689 --> 01:03:11,559
Hold your horses, or I'll knock you
from here to kingdom come.

619
01:03:11,729 --> 01:03:15,961
You know that dumpster behind
the supermarket? Look what I found.

620
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:21,567
A perfectly good head of lettuce,
just peel off the outer layers.

621
01:03:21,729 --> 01:03:27,679
Who wants a surprise?
Could be lunch meat or peaches.

622
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:33,481
The point is this: Just because
it's free, don't mean it's no good.

623
01:03:33,649 --> 01:03:38,928
- Do we live like kings, or what?
- We sure do.

624
01:03:47,969 --> 01:03:50,483
Again!

625
01:03:50,649 --> 01:03:53,607
Wait a minute.

626
01:03:53,769 --> 01:03:57,762
- I'm sorry, I really do want this.
- I do, too.

627
01:03:57,929 --> 01:04:00,397
- It's Mikey.
- He's asleep.

628
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:07,168
I have to be very clear
on the choices I make for him.

629
01:04:07,329 --> 01:04:14,041
I can't make any more mistakes
that are going to hurt Mikey.

630
01:04:14,209 --> 01:04:19,727
- But I'm crazy about Mikey.
- I know that I was leading you on.

631
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:23,962
You're such a good kisser and
I haven't had sex in a long time . . .

632
01:04:24,729 --> 01:04:29,359
Goodbye. Please . . . Goodbye.

633
01:04:29,529 --> 01:04:35,286
- Mollie, could I talk to you?
- Hold just a minute, please.

634
01:04:35,449 --> 01:04:40,523
Just between you and me,
what's with you and Chubby Charles?

635
01:04:40,689 --> 01:04:43,283
What do you mean?

636
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:47,965
Pearlman's doing the bank recs.
Rubenstein's doing the quarterlies.

637
01:04:48,129 --> 01:04:52,566
Now Albert's returns are due.
So what's with you?

638
01:04:52,729 --> 01:04:58,759
I traded Rubenstein two accounts
for the Chubby Charles account.

639
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:02,001
I can't do it anymore . . .
It's personal.

640
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:06,526
We're accountants . . .
we're not personal.

641
01:05:06,689 --> 01:05:10,398
- I don't . . .
- You've worked for him for years.

642
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:13,766
Now, with all the new tax laws,
you desert him.

643
01:05:13,929 --> 01:05:18,081
- You don't understand . . .
- I want you up there tomorrow.

644
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:24,279
Don't give me that look.
And you, get back to work.

645
01:05:27,729 --> 01:05:33,201
Please, give me a second chance.
This has been like a bad dream.

646
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:36,600
I felt so guilty
leaving Beth and the girls.

647
01:05:36,769 --> 01:05:43,208
You've been such an asshole,
I'd have to torture you.

648
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:46,839
That's okay. I want you to.

649
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:50,399
- Mollie, Mollie . . .
- What?

650
01:05:50,569 --> 01:05:54,528
- I'll burst if I don't kiss you.
- Tough!

651
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:02,564
Albert can see you now.

652
01:06:07,809 --> 01:06:11,688
- Mollie, how's Mickey?
- Mikey.

653
01:06:11,849 --> 01:06:14,761
- Is he talking yet?
- No.

654
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:18,683
Crawling?
I remember Astrid crawling . . .

655
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:22,398
I'm not interested in your stories.

656
01:06:22,569 --> 01:06:29,008
- I've been meaning to talk to you.
- I'm here to do your taxes.

657
01:06:31,089 --> 01:06:34,877
Eyelash tinting,
body wraps, facials . . .

658
01:06:35,049 --> 01:06:39,804
- You can't deduct any of this crap.
- And the exercise instructor?

659
01:06:39,969 --> 01:06:47,080
Not unless she suffered any injury.
What's the little woman been up to?

660
01:06:47,249 --> 01:06:51,561
Is Priscilla sick?
These doctor bills are for her.

661
01:06:51,729 --> 01:06:54,846
Therapy.
Beth communicaes with the dead.

662
01:06:55,009 --> 01:06:58,126
It really frightens Priscilla.

663
01:06:58,289 --> 01:07:04,000
We're all seeing a psychiatrist now.
I've been learning a lot.

664
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:08,799
- I'm happy for you, Albert.
- I know you've been through a lot.

665
01:07:08,969 --> 01:07:14,601
You've got to believe I love you.
I never meant for this to go bad.

666
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:19,797
- It just turned out that way.
- It took $20,000 to find that out?

667
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:24,963
- Do you have a picture of Mickey?
- Mikey!

668
01:07:25,129 --> 01:07:28,963
- I think about you two every day.
- You'd never know it.

669
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:32,599
I try to call, but I can't do it.

670
01:07:32,769 --> 01:07:37,285
I'm too ashamed.
I'm afraid of what you'll say.

671
01:07:37,449 --> 01:07:40,919
I've been so confused.

672
01:07:51,809 --> 01:07:55,165
- He has my eyes.
- I know.

673
01:07:55,329 --> 01:07:59,766
It's confusing loving someone
who looks like someone you hate.

674
01:07:59,929 --> 01:08:02,159
Could I see him?

675
01:08:05,489 --> 01:08:09,607
All right.
I'll be home this evening.

676
01:08:09,769 --> 01:08:14,684
Next time you talk to your mom,
put in a good word in for me.

677
01:08:14,849 --> 01:08:17,568
Hit me. Hit it again.

678
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:20,880
- No . . . yeah?
- Hit it again.

679
01:08:21,049 --> 01:08:26,362
- I know what I'm doing.
- Damn! You won again.

680
01:08:26,529 --> 01:08:32,240
I told you I could play. I've been
thinking about this daddy business.

681
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:35,799
I want you to be my daddy.
I'll tell Mommy.

682
01:08:38,089 --> 01:08:41,206
- Who is it?
- Mollie?

683
01:08:44,649 --> 01:08:48,688
- Is Mollie here?
- No, she's at aerobics class.

684
01:08:50,009 --> 01:08:54,480
- Is Mikey here? I'm his father.
- His father?

685
01:08:54,649 --> 01:08:58,881
- Are you the sperm donor?
- I'm the kid's father?

686
01:08:59,049 --> 01:09:04,885
- He's from artificial insemination.
- I've known Mollie for years.

687
01:09:05,049 --> 01:09:08,485
- I have a key.
- We're changing it.

688
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:13,283
- What?
- That's my kid in there. Let me by.

689
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:17,158
If you are the father,
answer me a few questions.

690
01:09:17,329 --> 01:09:22,005
- When was he born?
- July third.

691
01:09:22,169 --> 01:09:25,684
What's his favourite toy,
Fred or Barney? Fred?

692
01:09:25,849 --> 01:09:30,798
No, Barney. How many diapers
does he go through a day? Six.

693
01:09:30,969 --> 01:09:35,360
- A father should know.
- How much is she paying you?

694
01:09:35,529 --> 01:09:39,317
- Go play some video games.
- Don't give me that shit.

695
01:09:41,209 --> 01:09:45,327
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

696
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:49,402
Go for the body!

697
01:09:54,169 --> 01:09:57,878
Get out of here!

698
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:04,442
Yes, that feels good.

699
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:14,280
- What happened?
- Who's Albert?

700
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:18,840
- Why, was he here?
- Is he Mikey's father?

701
01:10:20,409 --> 01:10:25,722
- You lied about the insemination.
- He was married.

702
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:30,565
Do you love him?

703
01:10:30,729 --> 01:10:34,039
- What?
- Do you love him?

704
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:37,087
I don't know who I love.

705
01:10:37,249 --> 01:10:41,720
The only thing that matters to me
is who's best for Mikey.

706
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:48,840
Albert is successful, responsible
and he's good to his other kids.

707
01:10:49,009 --> 01:10:54,402
- I don't want him seeing Mikey.
- Don't start pulling this on me.

708
01:10:54,569 --> 01:10:59,359
- He has a right to see his son.
- Where has he been all year?

709
01:10:59,529 --> 01:11:04,967
- You are not his father.
- I'm the closest thing he's got.

710
01:11:05,129 --> 01:11:08,519
Look at you. You're like a big kid.

711
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:13,399
Are you responsible enough
to be a father?

712
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:17,039
Is getting pregnant by a married man
responsible?

713
01:11:17,209 --> 01:11:19,882
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

714
01:11:20,049 --> 01:11:25,840
I've seen you use Mikey to push guys
away, and now you're doing it to me.

715
01:11:26,009 --> 01:11:30,082
- Get out!
- I live here!

716
01:11:36,969 --> 01:11:41,440
Can a person past
a certain age change?

717
01:11:41,609 --> 01:11:44,169
Daddy's lipids fell to 1 85.

718
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:49,357
I'm not talking about cholesterol.
Can someone become nicer?

719
01:11:49,529 --> 01:11:51,645
I don't know.

720
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:56,087
When you met Daddy at that dance,
did you know he'd be a good father?

721
01:11:56,249 --> 01:12:02,279
- I liked the look of his uniform.
- They all wore uniforms.

722
01:12:02,449 --> 01:12:05,521
I didn't like
the sailors' bell-bottoms.

723
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:11,798
You had no idea if he was
a mature responsible person.

724
01:12:11,969 --> 01:12:17,362
If I thought like that, we wouldn't
have had so much fun the first week.

725
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:22,762
You're grossing me out.
Don't talk about sex and Daddy.

726
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:27,279
Hi, Lupe.

727
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:31,727
I just want to talk to Mikey
for a minute.

728
01:12:33,169 --> 01:12:36,957
Hey, Gerber-face, high-five.

729
01:12:39,569 --> 01:12:45,087
Look, Mikey . . . I don't know
if I can keep coming to see you.

730
01:12:45,249 --> 01:12:48,446
- What's the matter?
- It's your mom.

731
01:12:48,609 --> 01:12:53,160
She's got this crazy idea
that I wouldn't make a good father.

732
01:12:53,329 --> 01:12:57,845
She probably wouldn't
have picked my father, either.

733
01:12:58,009 --> 01:13:04,164
I think he did an okay job.
Want to hear some fatherly advice?

734
01:13:05,329 --> 01:13:09,242
Hi, Lupe.

735
01:13:09,409 --> 01:13:16,121
- The man's in the baby's room.
- Okay, I'll write you a check.

736
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:22,205
He said, "Don't hit girls,
even if they're asking for it."

737
01:13:22,369 --> 01:13:24,485
What about pushing them?

738
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:32,124
He'd say, "Finish your meat,
you know how much that cost? "

739
01:13:32,289 --> 01:13:37,761
The one that sticks out the most
was probably . . .

740
01:13:37,929 --> 01:13:42,684
"lf your friend jumps off a bridge,
does that mean you've got to?"

741
01:13:42,849 --> 01:13:49,288
To this very day,
I still use that piece of advice.

742
01:13:50,649 --> 01:13:53,561
It doesn't amount to much.

743
01:13:53,729 --> 01:14:01,158
A good father keeps the mother happy
so she doesn't drive the kids crazy.

744
01:14:01,329 --> 01:14:05,288
She called me a big kid . . .
She's probably right.

745
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:09,442
You're one year old
and my best friend in the world.

746
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:13,204
Anyway . . .

747
01:14:15,569 --> 01:14:19,960
- I'll miss you.
- Don't be sad. Here, take this.

748
01:14:25,089 --> 01:14:31,358
- No, I want you to have it.
- Okay, thanks.

749
01:14:31,529 --> 01:14:34,919
He'll take good care of you.

750
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:44,326
- We're going to see Daddy today.
- I was just thinking about James.

751
01:14:44,489 --> 01:14:50,359
- The blue or the lamb?
- They both look pretty lame.

752
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:54,158
- The lamb?
- Not lamb, lame!

753
01:14:54,329 --> 01:14:58,641
Please don't make me wear clothes
with animals on them.

754
01:14:58,809 --> 01:15:03,121
I don't like this.
It makes me look stupid.

755
01:15:03,289 --> 01:15:08,568
- You look great.
- I feel like a retard.

756
01:15:12,249 --> 01:15:15,798
Look at this room.
Look at these guys.

757
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:19,166
I bet I could take those apart.

758
01:15:19,329 --> 01:15:24,608
Little metal things . . . I'll stick
them in those little holes.

759
01:15:25,489 --> 01:15:30,643
Mollie, hi. This must be Mikey.

760
01:15:30,809 --> 01:15:35,758
Hiya, fella. What are you doing?

761
01:15:35,929 --> 01:15:40,002
- Aren't you a handsome . . .
- Milk in the eye.

762
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:42,364
Bull's-eye!

763
01:15:42,529 --> 01:15:47,444
It's all right.
It's just milk, it won't stain.

764
01:15:48,889 --> 01:15:54,919
- He's beautiful. He looks like you.
- A lot of people say that.

765
01:15:55,089 --> 01:16:00,322
I know the circumstances
you had him under were terrible.

766
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:05,279
- But I know it wasn't a mistake.
- I bet he's glad to hear that.

767
01:16:05,449 --> 01:16:09,488
You will never escape me.

768
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:13,437
- Mikey, don't do that!
- What did I do?

769
01:16:13,609 --> 01:16:20,959
Some people don't have the strength
to get out certain situations.

770
01:16:21,129 --> 01:16:25,042
What are you trying to say?
Mikey, don't touch that.

771
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:31,159
I'm saying I still love you
and I still want you.

772
01:16:31,329 --> 01:16:37,279
- And what about Mikey?
- Count on me. Whatever he needs.

773
01:16:38,329 --> 01:16:40,718
He needs a father.

774
01:16:40,889 --> 01:16:46,885
I'm living alone for the first time
in 1 7 years. I'm in therapy.

775
01:16:47,049 --> 01:16:52,282
I can't be anybody's father now.
I need to be by myself.

776
01:16:52,449 --> 01:16:57,648
- I've raised my kids.
- Raised them? They're 1 1 and 9!

777
01:16:57,809 --> 01:17:02,564
- Have they moved out?
- Too much fruit!

778
01:17:02,729 --> 01:17:07,007
It wouldn't be fair to Mikey.

779
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:11,447
- Is he taking a dump?
- No, he's thinking real hard.

780
01:17:14,489 --> 01:17:19,927
- I'll get you cleaned up.
- Use the washroom in the back.

781
01:17:20,089 --> 01:17:25,766
- He'll ask about his daddy.
- I want James to be the daddy.

782
01:17:25,929 --> 01:17:30,923
Don't do that here.
That's a $1 0,000 desk!

783
01:17:31,089 --> 01:17:35,719
- Now it's junk!
- I thought you'd understand.

784
01:17:35,889 --> 01:17:42,601
Of course I understand. You're going
through a selfish phase.

785
01:17:42,769 --> 01:17:47,604
I know you will understand that I'm
going through a destructive phase.

786
01:17:52,489 --> 01:17:55,287
Let's trash the place.

787
01:18:02,129 --> 01:18:05,565
I'm sorry about that stupid outfit.

788
01:18:05,729 --> 01:18:10,678
I'm sorry I made you meet
that mean man. Never again.

789
01:18:10,849 --> 01:18:16,606
Every time I take you someplace,
people are crazy about you.

790
01:18:16,769 --> 01:18:22,366
Yet the person who has a genetic
bond to you treats you like a jerk.

791
01:18:22,529 --> 01:18:26,363
Everybody loves you.
All the kids at the playground.

792
01:18:26,529 --> 01:18:29,441
Ma loves you. Rona loves you.

793
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:34,763
James loves you.
Mikey, do you love James?

794
01:18:37,249 --> 01:18:42,528
- Give him a call.
- Do you want to play telephone?

795
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:45,442
Hello?

796
01:18:45,609 --> 01:18:50,558
It's for you. You take this one,
I'll take the other one.

797
01:18:50,729 --> 01:18:55,803
This is Lou Franklin,
I'm phoning about your grandfather.

798
01:18:55,969 --> 01:18:59,678
He's become abusive and violent.

799
01:18:59,849 --> 01:19:05,242
- Should I call Health & Welfare?
- No, I'll come and pick him up.

800
01:19:15,409 --> 01:19:18,924
- What's going on?
- I'm a hostage.

801
01:19:19,089 --> 01:19:21,967
He's a mean old bastard!

802
01:19:22,129 --> 01:19:26,202
- Look what he did to my arm?
- Don't talk to him like that.

803
01:19:26,369 --> 01:19:30,044
- They're hiding Dora.
- They are not.

804
01:19:30,209 --> 01:19:35,966
- Then where is she?
- Sit down. I'll find her for you.

805
01:19:36,129 --> 01:19:41,806
Let's get your face cleaned up.
You want to look good for her.

806
01:19:42,609 --> 01:19:48,366
You're my favourite daughter-in-law.
You're smart and a good person.

807
01:19:48,529 --> 01:19:53,205
That's why Jimmy loves you so much.

808
01:19:55,689 --> 01:20:00,205
- There you go.
- Let's go find James.

809
01:20:00,369 --> 01:20:04,362
I'll show you some pictures.

810
01:20:05,369 --> 01:20:10,045
Grandpa, did you eat all these
candy bars today?

811
01:20:10,209 --> 01:20:14,521
- The bastards stole my candy.
- We'll get some more.

812
01:20:14,689 --> 01:20:18,238
- Where's the director's office?
- Down the hall.

813
01:20:18,409 --> 01:20:22,527
- We're busy.
- I'll keep my eye on them for you.

814
01:20:22,689 --> 01:20:26,125
I'll be back in a minute.

815
01:20:26,289 --> 01:20:33,127
This isn't his usual behaviour.
My husband made arrangements.

816
01:20:33,289 --> 01:20:37,726
It isn't the orderly's
responsibility to control his diet.

817
01:20:37,889 --> 01:20:41,040
He requires a private nurse.

818
01:20:41,209 --> 01:20:50,322
No, he doesn't. The orderly was told
to give him one candy bar a day.

819
01:20:50,489 --> 01:20:54,277
- He said no problem.
- That was Bill.

820
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:59,842
Bill always says no problem.
The man can't speak English.

821
01:21:01,689 --> 01:21:05,318
- So can Grandpa stay?
- Of course.

822
01:21:05,489 --> 01:21:11,803
- Thank you.
- Thanks for coming down so fast.

823
01:21:14,009 --> 01:21:18,002
- Hi.
- Hi.

824
01:21:18,169 --> 01:21:23,801
- Your grandfather can stay.
- You didn't have to do that.

825
01:21:23,969 --> 01:21:28,918
- I wanted to do it.
- Let me give you a ride home.

826
01:21:29,089 --> 01:21:31,398
- Don't bother.
- Fine!

827
01:21:31,569 --> 01:21:35,960
D.J. , it's time for lunch.
Let's go.

828
01:21:36,129 --> 01:21:40,247
- Are you okay with him?
- Get the hell out of here.

829
01:21:42,249 --> 01:21:46,447
Steven and Paulie,
they're your cousins.

830
01:21:47,809 --> 01:21:52,246
- Hi, Vince.
- Hello, Esther.

831
01:21:56,729 --> 01:22:01,757
Esther . . . I'd like you
to meet my grandson.

832
01:22:02,849 --> 01:22:06,205
Hey, there goes James.

833
01:22:06,369 --> 01:22:10,965
Where's he going?
Maybe he's going downstairs.

834
01:22:11,129 --> 01:22:16,283
- They took me to the beauty salon.
- Where's the elevator.

835
01:22:16,449 --> 01:22:19,521
Going down.

836
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:23,204
I'll just press all these.

837
01:22:24,529 --> 01:22:29,080
Perfect! I'll just hitch a ride
with the fruit cups.

838
01:22:31,769 --> 01:22:35,478
There we go. Take her away, boys.

839
01:22:37,209 --> 01:22:41,282
- Mikey.
- Grandpa, where's Mikey?

840
01:22:41,449 --> 01:22:47,558
- He was just here.
- How long ago did he leave?

841
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:51,642
- I'll check the hallway.
- I'm calling the police.

842
01:22:53,009 --> 01:22:55,967
Hi, toots. Anyone seen my dad?

843
01:22:56,129 --> 01:23:02,079
- That's lda's grandson.
- Come on, I'm in a hurry.

844
01:23:02,249 --> 01:23:07,767
- Here, fella, go find your grandma.
- Thanks for nothing.

845
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:13,287
When the police get here,
will you show them these pictures?

846
01:23:13,449 --> 01:23:16,566
All right, I'm on the case now.

847
01:23:18,809 --> 01:23:22,518
That is exactly what I need.

848
01:23:22,689 --> 01:23:27,763
I could find him in one of those.
Let's see if I remember this.

849
01:23:27,929 --> 01:23:32,684
I'll set this thing down right here
and get that door open.

850
01:23:32,849 --> 01:23:36,046
What was it James said?

851
01:23:36,209 --> 01:23:40,248
Stick this in here . . .
There it goes.

852
01:23:40,409 --> 01:23:43,924
Move the circle around
and we're off.

853
01:23:44,129 --> 01:23:46,324
Mikey!

854
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:49,128
Mikey!

855
01:23:52,769 --> 01:23:57,365
- He's in the back of that car.
- Let's get the cab.

856
01:23:57,529 --> 01:24:01,078
- Hey!
- Stop!

857
01:24:09,489 --> 01:24:12,561
I got this driving thing knocked.

858
01:24:17,769 --> 01:24:20,602
Move it!

859
01:24:21,929 --> 01:24:26,798
There he is. Look at me.
Hey, James, I'm driving!

860
01:24:28,089 --> 01:24:34,358
James . . . where's he going?

861
01:24:38,049 --> 01:24:41,041
- What are you doing?
- I'll cut him off.

862
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:43,518
You'll lose him.

863
01:24:45,609 --> 01:24:49,443
I know this alley
like the back of my hand.

864
01:25:04,209 --> 01:25:09,078
Mikey! He's gone!

865
01:25:09,249 --> 01:25:11,399
Mikey!

866
01:25:11,569 --> 01:25:16,768
- You had a little boy in there.
- What are you talking about?

867
01:25:16,929 --> 01:25:19,602
He's about this big.

868
01:25:19,769 --> 01:25:24,365
- This is a good place to spot him.
- Mikey!

869
01:25:24,529 --> 01:25:27,680
Mikey, stop!

870
01:25:27,849 --> 01:25:31,080
- James, is that you?
- Mikey, don't move.

871
01:25:31,249 --> 01:25:34,605
James, Mommy . . .

872
01:25:34,769 --> 01:25:37,044
Here I come.

873
01:25:37,209 --> 01:25:40,565
- Mikey!
- I'm coming.

874
01:25:50,769 --> 01:25:56,207
- Did you see what just happened?
- Give me my baby.

875
01:25:59,169 --> 01:26:03,879
Are you all right, honey?
Let me see you.

876
01:26:04,049 --> 01:26:07,121
He doesn't have a scratch on him.

877
01:26:07,289 --> 01:26:10,042
I finally got you both together.

878
01:26:10,209 --> 01:26:13,884
I better take
him to the hospital anyway.

879
01:26:14,049 --> 01:26:18,042
Ma, I want James to be the daddy.

880
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:22,521
- Thanks for all your help.
- I'll take you home now.

881
01:26:24,049 --> 01:26:30,124
- Dada.
- I think he called you Dada.

882
01:26:30,289 --> 01:26:32,803
No, I'm talking
to hear myself speak.

883
01:26:32,969 --> 01:26:37,281
- He thinks you're his father.
- I've spent a lot of time with him.

884
01:26:37,449 --> 01:26:41,681
He probably thinks
we're going to end up together.

885
01:26:50,409 --> 01:26:54,038
I hope
they don't get stuck together.

886
01:26:58,169 --> 01:27:02,685
Should I tell them
I need a new diaper?

887
01:27:02,849 --> 01:27:04,805
No, I'll wait.

888
01:27:56,609 --> 01:28:00,841
- Hi, honey.
