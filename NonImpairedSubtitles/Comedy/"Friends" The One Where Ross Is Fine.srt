1
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,371
Okay, Ross.

2
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:19,109
I realize that you didn't expect
to walk in and see that, but...

3
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:22,846
- Let me explain, okay?
- We weren't doing anything!

4
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,657
Rach, he just saw us.

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,465
But what you saw,
that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.

6
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,294
- That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
- Dude, chill!

7
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,664
Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,741
...but we didn't plan it.
The only reason that that happened...

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,673
...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.

10
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:49,576
Yeah, you started it!
I have got to chill.

11
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:56,450
Look, we probably should have talked to
you about this before it ever happened.

12
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:00,081
- But...
- Oh, we feeI so terrible about this, Ross.

13
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,491
Yeah. But it did happen.

14
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,462
So...

15
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,160
Ross?

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,141
Ross?

17
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,642
Can we just close the door?

18
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,488
Ross, say something.

19
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,126
Anything.

20
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,730
So you two are...?

21
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,323
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,461
And have you had...?

23
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,629
- No. No, no, no.
- No. No.

24
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,138
But if I hadn't walked in here,
would you...?

25
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,276
Probably-
No. No.

26
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,613
Ross, this is not how we wanted you
to find out about this.

27
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,751
You have every right
to go nuts.

28
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,182
I'm not going nuts.
Do you see me going nuts?

29
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,255
No, but you know what I mean.

30
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,361
If you two are happy...

31
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,728
...then I'm happy for you.

32
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,729
I'm fine.

33
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,200
- Really?
- Absolutely.

34
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,740
I'm fine.

35
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,668
Totally fine.

36
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,281
I don't know why it's coming out
all loud and squeaky...

37
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,474
...because, really, I'm fine.

38
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:14,056
I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised
to see you guys kissing.

39
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,559
I mean, at first I was like:

40
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:23,362
But now that I've had time
to absorb it...

41
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,262
Loving this.

42
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,535
- Ross-
- It's all working out.

43
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,308
Me and Charlie.
And you two.

44
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,609
- You know what we should do?
- Calm ourselves?

45
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,716
No.

46
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,983
We should all have dinner.

47
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,216
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
I'll cook!

48
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,093
Look, don't you think
that would be a little weird?

49
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,196
Weird? What? What's weird?

50
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,663
The only thing weird would be
if someone didn't like Mexican food...

51
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,859
...because I'm making fajitas!

52
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,605
I do like fajitas.

53
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,849
God, this adoption stuff
is so overwhelming.

54
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,578
There's inter-country adoption,
dependency adoption.

55
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,657
There's so many ways to go, and this is,
like, the biggest decision of our lives.

56
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,453
There's a hair in my coffee.

57
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,890
Hey, guys.

58
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,227
Have you seen Frank Jr.?
He's meeting me here with the triplets.

59
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,460
It's funny,
every time you say "triplets"...

60
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,105
...I think of three hot,
blond 19-year-olds.

61
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,705
That's sweet.

62
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,876
Drink your hair.

63
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,135
Hey, what's all this stuff?

64
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,008
They're brochures
from different adoption agencies.

65
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,582
Babies! Oh, this one is so cute.

66
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,583
Get this one.

67
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,117
That's not really how it works.

68
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,087
- Oh, how does it work?
- I don't know!

69
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,296
If you're having a hard time,
you should talk to my friends...

70
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,626
...Bill and Colleen. They adopted
a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,461
Thanks, that would be great.

72
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,899
Hey, honey,
wouldn't that be great?

73
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,508
All right, all right.
Remember what we talked about.

74
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,670
When we're in a public place,
there are certain rules.

75
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,915
That's not what we talked about!

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,617
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi.

77
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,653
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

78
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,348
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi. Hey, how you doing?

79
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,360
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten
so big. Which one is which again?

80
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,497
Well, that's Frank Jr. Jr...

81
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,794
...pulling the tampons out
of the lady's purse.

82
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:41,100
And that's Chandler
climbing on Chandler.

83
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,576
That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.

84
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,910
She's got quite an arm there,
doesn't she? Yeah.

85
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,074
Hey, guys, come give me a hug.

86
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,148
Triplets, hug your aunt!

87
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,917
It's like hugging fresh cookies.

88
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,323
Oh, okay.

89
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,225
I'm gonna eat you!

90
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,026
So how you been, Frank?

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,102
Oh, good, you know. Life is all right.
Just taking it day by day.

92
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,931
Seems like somebody needs something.

93
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,166
Oh, no. He's just trying
to pull my shoulder out of it's socket.

94
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,668
- Oh, my God.
- No, it's fine.

95
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,473
After I black out,
he tries to put it back in, so...

96
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,007
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No.

97
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,920
Can I just say, I know we're doing this
for Ross and that's cooI.

98
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,720
But if it was up to me, this is not what
we'd be doing on our first date.

99
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,055
Well, what would we be doing?

100
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,358
I'd take you out
for a romantic night.

101
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:45,561
Some champagne, fancy dinner,
feeI you up on the carriage ride home.

102
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,206
FeeI me up?

103
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,205
In a carriage.

104
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,473
Well, maybe we can have our date
later on tonight.

105
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,242
You know, after this,
we'll go back to our apartment...

106
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,578
Right, right. Yeah.

107
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:05,156
We could put on some music,
light some candles, and then...

108
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,618
You want to say feeI me up,
don't you?

109
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,853
I just think it's something we should do.

110
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,487
- Hey, Charlie!
- Hi.

111
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,462
- Hi.
- Hey.

112
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,862
So...

113
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,829
- ... dreading this?
- Oh, you bet.

114
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,938
So did you bring
a little something for Ross?

115
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,737
Actually, it's some stuff you left
at my apartment.

116
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,642
Well, thanks.

117
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,339
And you can just give me
my stuff whenever you want.

118
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,281
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.

119
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,455
I thought I heard voices.

120
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,453
Hi, Charlie.

121
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,196
Hey, Joey.

122
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,525
And, oh, you're gonna have
to introduce me to your new girlfriend.

123
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,499
I'm just kidding. I know RacheI.
I know...

124
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,308
Come. Please come in.
Come in.

125
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,711
Okay.
Well, we brought you some wine.

126
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,510
That is so thoughtfuI.

127
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,881
She's a keeper.

128
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,159
- And what did you bring me, huh?
- Actually, that's-

129
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,351
Underwear, a toothbrush...

130
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,656
...and a Van Halen CD.

131
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,459
I can use all these things!

132
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,168
Gosh, Ross, you know,
you seem a little-

133
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,737
What? Fine? Because I am.

134
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,239
Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't-?
You see?

135
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,536
Who else is fine?

136
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,510
Come on.

137
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,774
Listen. Why don't you try to relax.
Maybe have a drink.

138
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,849
You know what,
that is a very good idea.

139
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,613
I'm gonna go make
a pitcher of margaritas.

140
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,084
Oh, God.

141
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,057
So adorable.

142
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,200
Look at them,
sleeping there like angels.

143
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,099
Yeah, I really cherish
these moments...

144
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,799
...because before you know it,
they're gonna be awake again.

145
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,303
Well, they may be a handfuI...

146
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,470
- ... but they're so cute.
- Yeah.

147
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:12,208
Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
they did the funniest thing.

148
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,445
I haven't slept in four years.

149
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,554
That's a long time.

150
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,023
You just don't know
how hard it is, Phoebe.

151
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,991
There's just so many of them.

152
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,824
You know, two I could handle.

153
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,557
Two's great.
You just hold one in each hand.

154
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,101
What do I do when the third one runs
at me with his bike helmet on?

155
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,104
I got no more hands
to protect my area.

156
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,272
There's three of them, Phoebe.
Three.

157
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,501
Yeah, I know, Frank.

158
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,978
I counted them when they
were coming out of my area.

159
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,346
Sometimes, I think that-

160
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:52,151
Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
It's too horrible. No.

161
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,990
What?

162
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,321
No, no, I can't.

163
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,092
Oh, my God, Frank.
Are you thinking of leaving?

164
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,431
Because I didn't have those triplets
so you could run out on them.

165
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,937
Oh, no, I would never do that.
No. I just...

166
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,738
...was thinking that, you know,
maybe you could take one.

167
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,608
What?

168
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,116
You can't separate them, that's terrible!
Which one?

169
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,648
Thank you so much for seeing us.

170
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,021
Phoebe has told us great things
about you guys.

171
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,822
Please, we're happy to help.

172
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,621
We went through the same thing
when we were adopting.

173
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,895
So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees
and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

174
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,539
I mean, you have a lovely home.

175
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,013
We appreciate anything
you can tell us.

176
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,639
Well, actually,
I think this might help.

177
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:53,876
It's pretty much...

178
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,214
- ... all the information you need.
- Oh, my God.

179
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,222
Everything is broken into categories,
then cross-referenced.

180
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,225
Then color-coded to correspond
with the forms in the back.

181
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,520
Thank you.

182
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,023
I think I just had a tiny orgasm.

183
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,672
I know the process is frustrating,
but it's so worth it.

184
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,899
Adopting Owen was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

185
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,339
That's great. Can I see the book?

186
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,606
You want me to wash
my hands first, don't you?

187
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,841
Please. It's just so pretty and white.

188
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,188
Bathroom is down the hall to your left.

189
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,952
I would have told him to do it too.

190
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,251
Can I adopt you?

191
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,724
- Hey, you must be Owen.
- Yeah.

192
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,457
I'm Chandler.
Hey, I was in the Scouts too.

193
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:46,230
- You were?
- In fact, my father was a den mother.

194
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,905
You know how to use a compass?

195
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,640
I have a badge in it.

196
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,074
- You do? That's fantastic.
- You want to see it?

197
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,646
I'd love to, but I gotta get back
to your parents.

198
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,114
They're telling us
about how they adopted you.

199
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,912
What?

200
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,722
What?

201
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,155
I'm adopted?

202
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,458
I got nothing.

203
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,869
I'm adopted?

204
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,142
No.

205
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,237
I didn't say that. I said...

206
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,745
...you're a doctor.

207
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,508
A doctor.

208
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:37,054
Hey, doctor, my arm hurts.
Can you fix it for me?

209
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,684
I can't believe I'm adopted.

210
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,886
So you're not gonna fix my arm?

211
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:53,399
Well, that first batch of margaritas
was not so great...

212
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,007
...but this second batch is good.

213
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:02,044
Well, maybe the next batch,
we could all get some.

214
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,613
Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?

215
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,048
You know, just the four of us.

216
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,050
Just hanging.

217
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,182
Dude, are you okay?

218
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,291
And when are the fajitas
gonna be ready?

219
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,819
I'm fine, okay? I'm great.

220
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,966
I'm just-
I'm just proud of us.

221
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,569
You know?
There's no weirdness, no tension.

222
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,761
No awareness.

223
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,874
We make a great foursome.
We should do more stuff together.

224
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,745
Let's take a trip!

225
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,244
We could all go on your boat.

226
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,214
Joey has this amazing sailboat.

227
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,718
Actually, Ross, I sold the boat
two years ago.

228
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,981
Oh, no. Idiot!

229
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,692
Well, yeah, but I could get another one.

230
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,455
- This trip sounds great.
- Yeah?

231
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,326
Okay, where do you think we can go?

232
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,730
My fajitas!

233
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,599
Look, Charlie,
I just want you to know...

234
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,871
...Ross is just having a little trouble
adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.

235
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,276
You know, he normally
doesn't drink like this.

236
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,746
You know what, this is nothing.
My father is a raging alcoholic.

237
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,117
I'm sorry, have I made
this evening uncomfortable?

238
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,695
Fajitas! Be carefuI!
Very hot plate! Very hot!

239
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,856
Ross, you don't
even have oven mitts on.

240
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,201
That is gonna hurt tomorrow.

241
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,699
Okay, well, this is crazy.

242
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,403
We can't seriously be talking about me
taking one of your kids, can we?

243
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,139
Oh, no, of course we're not.

244
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,977
- That's insane.
- I know.

245
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,618
Alice would never go for it.

246
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,051
She's pretty tired too.
I think we could get her on board.

247
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:57,095
Well, just for argument's sake,
you know, hypothetically...

248
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,356
...which one
would you be willing to give up?

249
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,957
Frank Jr. Jr.?

250
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,365
Well, it'd be great for my shoulder.

251
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,198
You'd be getting a really good one.

252
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,670
He's really funny.

253
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,105
Like, the other day,
he made up this joke:

254
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,939
What's green and says,
"Hey, I'm a frog"?

255
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,508
A talking frog.

256
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,950
Oh, no, you can't have him,
he's too funny.

257
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,658
Well, all right, that's fine.
What about Leslie?

258
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,986
Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.

259
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:32,858
She's the only one that knows how
to burp the alphabet.

260
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,894
All right, so that leaves Chandler.

261
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,332
No, no, you can't have Chandler.
No, no. She's my little genius.

262
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,005
I got big hopes for her.

263
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,904
She's gonna be a doctor
or a realtor.

264
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:51,412
Wow, Frank,
I think we just ran out of kids.

265
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,676
Oh, I think you're right.

266
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:02,320
Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think
I can give one of them up.

267
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:06,225
I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
but they're my babies.

268
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:12,032
I'm sorry, Frank,
I didn't realize things were so bad.

269
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,435
You know, I'll help out more.
I can baby-sit anytime you want.

270
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,268
You name the day and I'll be there.

271
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,843
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, that's not good.

272
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,940
But I can move some stuff around
and I'll be there.

273
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,310
You and Alice just take
the whole day together.

274
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,510
You'd do that for us?

275
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,951
Are you kidding?
That's what sisters are for.

276
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,362
Oh, look at them.

277
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,265
I love you so much.

278
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,063
Oh, crap, don't wake up!
Don't wake up!

279
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,103
- Where are Bill and Colleen?
- Kitchen, getting something to eat.

280
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,802
Can you believe
how nice they are?

281
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,311
We have to leave.

282
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,885
Why?
What did you do in the bathroom?

283
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,886
I didn't get to the bathroom.
I bumped into Owen on the way.

284
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,786
He didn't know he was adopted.
There's a slight chance...

285
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,324
...I may have told him.

286
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,025
Oh, my God, where's my purse?
No, I can replace everything in there.

287
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,631
- Get that binder and let's go!
- Hi.

288
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,335
Some little snacks for everybody.

289
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,495
You don't have to eat the sour worms.
Those are for Owen.

290
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,563
I'll go get him in a second.

291
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,074
By the way, you should know,
we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

292
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,939
But kids are so intuitive.

293
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,446
Don't you think, on some leveI,
he already knows?

294
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,983
- I'm adopted?
- See? Intuitive.

295
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,512
What? Where did you hear that?

296
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:38,848
He told me.

297
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,019
And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

298
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,258
Which, technically,
now you should give back.

299
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,236
You told him he's adopted?

300
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,032
I'm sorry. You should have
a sign out there or something.

301
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,368
Or at least whisper it to people
when they come in the door.

302
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,036
"Owen doesn't know he's adopted,
and he also thinks Santa is reaI."

303
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,010
He isn't?

304
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,550
We have to get out of here, baby.

305
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,419
What is the matter with you?

306
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,649
All right, look, I know
what Chandler did was not the best...

307
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,728
...but anyone would assume that
a 12-year-old has been told he's adopted.

308
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,457
- Yeah, he's 8.
- Wow, he's tall.

309
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,459
What country did you get him from?

310
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,965
Everyone, I would like
to make a toast...

311
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:33,076
...to RacheI and Joey.

312
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,106
And to love.

313
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,184
Ah, love!

314
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,553
L- O-V-E. Love.

315
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,852
L is for "life. "

316
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,621
And what is life without love?

317
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,225
Oh, my God, are we supposed
to answer?

318
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:00,000
O is for:

319
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,134
"Oh, wow!"

320
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:09,639
The V is for this...

321
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,808
...very surprising turn of events...

322
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,680
...which I am still fine with,
by the way.

323
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,549
E...

324
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,160
...is for how...

325
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,267
...extremely normaI I find it...

326
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,562
...that you two...

327
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,070
...are together.

328
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,734
And that one day
you might get married...

329
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,916
...and have children of your own.

330
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,520
- Dude, are you okay?
- Totally.

331
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,525
Ross, you don't seem okay.

332
00:19:56,728 --> 00:20:00,186
I'm sorry, it must be
the pressure of entertaining.

333
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,364
I think everyone would
feeI better if we had some flan.

334
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:11,205
Wait, Ross. Ross, I-
I have to take off.

335
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,275
- No!
- I'm sorry.

336
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,039
I have an early class in the morning.

337
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,616
But this has been lovely.

338
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,420
Wasn't it? And you thought it
would be awkward with Joey.

339
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,990
And that you never
really liked RacheI.

340
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:32,320
You are on fire!
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

341
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,192
- Okay.
- All right.

342
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,496
God, RacheI, what Ross just said,
that's just-

343
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,037
That's okay.
Girls tend not to like me.

344
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,703
Fine.

345
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:50,575
Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.

346
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,581
Hey, that rhymes.

347
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,989
You know what, Ross,
I think we're gonna take off too.

348
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:05,085
Of course. God, I'm so stupid.

349
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,788
You guys are a couple now.

350
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,433
I mean, you probably
just want to be alone.

351
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:13,264
- No, it's just getting late-
- It's fine. It's totally fine.

352
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,373
I've got plenty of margaritas.
It's all good.

353
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,379
I don't even know what that's for.

354
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,481
You know what?

355
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,817
I think I'm gonna stay here
and make sure he's okay.

356
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,156
- That's probably a good idea.
- I'll see you in the morning.

357
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,821
Okay.

358
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,126
Yeah, you know, Joey, I-

359
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,794
I don't think he's ever
gonna be okay with this.

360
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,200
It doesn't look good, does it?

361
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,523
I guess I made Tater Tots.

362
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,859
Ross, oven mitts!

363
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,006
Morning.

364
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,874
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

365
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:34,980
- Did you stay here all night?
- Yeah.

366
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,580
So you took off my pants and shoes?

367
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,349
No. No, no.

368
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,656
You actually did that when you
were dancing to the Chicago soundtrack.

369
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,930
Look, Ross...

370
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,572
...about RacheI and I. Listen, you don't
have to worry about that...

371
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,038
...because nothing's gonna happen.

372
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,574
What do you mean?

373
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,773
She and I said from the beginning...

374
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,882
...we weren't gonna do anything
unless you were okay with it.

375
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,540
And clearly-

376
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,448
What are you talking about?
I'm fine.

377
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,254
- Are we still doing this?
- No.

378
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:17,690
It's okay, Ross.
You know, I totally understand.

379
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,627
Of course you're not fine. You're...

380
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,963
You're Ross and RacheI.

381
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,096
Yeah, except we're not.

382
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,406
I mean, we haven't been
a couple in, like...

383
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,677
...six years.

384
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,879
My God, is that right?

385
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,119
Has it been that long?

386
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,388
That's what I hear, yeah.

387
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,693
This is crazy.
I mean, six years...

388
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:55,128
...and because of me,
you guys aren't gonna be together?

389
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,433
Can I ask you something?

390
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,070
Really...

391
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,531
...what is this thing
with you and RacheI?

392
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:09,344
Come on, you know me.
You know...

393
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:11,773
Joey.

394
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,550
I'm crazy about her.

395
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,422
And she feels the same way?

396
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,500
I think so.

397
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,732
Well, then...

398
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,103
...maybe it's time
we all moved on.

399
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,238
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean,
you're not okay with it, so-

400
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,747
No, but I want to be.

401
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,378
I will be.

402
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,051
Besides, I'm with Charlie, right?

403
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,718
Oh, my God,
I'm still with Charlie, aren't I?

404
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,592
- She didn't see the dance, did she?
- No, no, no.

405
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,432
No, that was-
That was just for me.

406
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,803
Hey, you...?

407
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,910
You sure about this?

408
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,774
Yeah, I'm sure.

409
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,414
And...

410
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,343
...we're okay?

411
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,624
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

412
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,825
We just want to give
you a heads up.

413
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,335
- Bill and Colleen hate us.
- Why?

414
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,939
Owen didn't know he's adopted
and Monica told him.

415
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,666
What?

416
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,971
- He didn't know? He's 12.
- No, he's only 8.

417
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,205
I'll bet he's Russian.

418
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,475
Still, he had to find out sometime.

419
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:56,815
How would you like it if someone told
the triplets that you gave birth to them?

420
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,723
I'm gonna go tell Emma
she was an accident.
