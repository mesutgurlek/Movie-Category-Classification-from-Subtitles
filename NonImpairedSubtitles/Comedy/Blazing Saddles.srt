1
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,402
Come on, boys!

2
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:48,240
The way you're lollygagging around here
with them picks and them shovels...

3
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:51,313
...you'd think it was 120°...

4
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,015
It cant' be more than 114.

5
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:01,595
Dock that Chink a day's pay
for napping on the job.

6
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:09,033
Now, come on, boys, where's your
spirit? I don't hear no singing.

7
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,072
When you were slaves,
you sang like birds.

8
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,270
Go on. How about a good
old nigger work song?

9
00:03:25,154 --> 00:03:29,420
"I get no kick from champagne.

10
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:37,094
"Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.

11
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,529
"So tell me why should it be true...

12
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:48,600
"... that I get a belt out of you?

13
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,978
"Some get a kick from cocaine. "

14
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,086
What the hell is that shit?

15
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:07,694
I meant a song. A real song.

16
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,324
Something like...

17
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:14,462
"Swing low, sweet chariot... "

18
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,404
Swing low? Sweet chariot?

19
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,107
Don't know that one, huh?

20
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,641
How about "De Camp Town Ladies"?

21
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,340
"De Camp Town Ladies"?

22
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,781
Ah, you know.

23
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:39,588
"De Camp Town Ladies sing this song,
doo-dah, doo-dah.

24
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,129
"De Camp Town race track five
miles long, all the doo-dah day!

25
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,296
"Gonna run all night,
gonna run all day.

26
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:52,301
"Bet my money on the bobtailed
nag, somebody bet on the bay!"

27
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:05,819
What in the wide, wide world
of sports is going on here?

28
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,717
I hired you people to try to get
a little track laid...

29
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,152
...not to jump around like a
bunch of Kansas City faggots!

30
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:15,324
Sorry, Mr. Taggart. I, I guess
we kind of got caught up.

31
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:18,998
Dummy, the surveyors say they may
have run into some quicksand up ahead.

32
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,330
Better check it out.

33
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,736
Okay, I'll send down a team of
horses to check out the ground.

34
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:28,737
Horses! We can't afford to lose
any horses, you dummy!

35
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:30,903
Send over a couple of niggers.

36
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,409
You and you.

37
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:42,086
Sir, he specifically requested
two niggers...

38
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:47,388
...but to tell a family secret,
my grandmother was Dutch.

39
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,922
Get on that hand car and take it
down to the end of that line!

40
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,734
Just trying to help you out.

41
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,235
I didn't know your grandma was Dutch!

42
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,774
"Oh, de Camp Town Ladies sing
this song, doo-dah, doo-dah.

43
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:11,110
"Camp Town race track five
miles long, oh, doo-dah day.

44
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,451
"Going to run all night,
going to run all day.

45
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,626
"I waged my money on the bobtail nag,
somebody bet on the bay!"

46
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,790
Am I wrong...

47
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,298
...or is the world rising?

48
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:33,973
I don't know, but whatever
it is, I hate it.

49
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:38,907
Let me ask you something.

50
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:44,480
What is it that's not exactly water,
and it's not exactly earth?

51
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,020
Quicksand!

52
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:55,097
Oh, shit, quicksand!

53
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,723
Goddang, now we are in trouble!

54
00:06:58,468 --> 00:06:59,799
They're in trouble!

55
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,870
Get your rope there.
Get over there quick.

56
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:19,645
Dang, that was lucky.

57
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:23,115
Doggone near lost a $400 hand cart.

58
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:34,662
Yeah, we can take it right off to the,
just a little bit to the left of that hill.

59
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,530
But we're going to die, Bart.
They're going to leave us here to die!

60
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,776
Take it easy, Charlie.
My foot is on the rail.

61
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,786
Then maybe down that canyon.
I think it's pretty level off there.

62
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:55,491
We can't swing back to the right
'cause of that hill there.

63
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,055
That looks like the way
we'll have to go from here.

64
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:02,055
Yes, we'll put her right down
through there over that ridge.

65
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,200
Well, boys, the break is over.

66
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,803
Don't just lay there getting a suntan.

67
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:14,166
Won't do you any good, anyhow!

68
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,577
Take that shovel and put
her to some good use!

69
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:28,015
What?

70
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:29,658
Don't do that now!

71
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,961
I have to.

72
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:38,097
Send a wire to the main office
and tell them I said... OW!

73
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:44,099
Send wire, main office,
tell them I said, "Ow". Gotcha.

74
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,683
And right here, Mr. Lamarr, is
where we ran into quicksand.

75
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:57,042
Quicksand. Splendid.

76
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,112
And so the railroad has got
to go through Rock Ridge.

77
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,618
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge. Splendid.

78
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:05,621
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

79
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:08,054
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge.

80
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:09,864
Be still, Taggart. Be still.

81
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,134
My mind is aglow with whirling,
transient nodes of thought...

82
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,634
...careening through a
cosmic vapor of invention.

83
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,634
Ditto!

84
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:26,404
Ditto? Ditto, you provincial putz!

85
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,239
I'm sorry, sir.

86
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,453
A plan. We need a plan.

87
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,082
What in the hell was that?

88
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:43,658
We can't hear ourselves think!

89
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,134
Sorry, your Worship, but I've got
two men home sick with the flu...

90
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:54,773
...and it's utter chaos down here.

91
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,142
I'll try to keep it
as quiet as possible.

92
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,474
But as you can see...

93
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,342
...this one is a doozey.

94
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:09,922
Yes, the Doctor Gillespie killings.
Well, do your best.

95
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:16,521
Now, let's see. Where were we?

96
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,833
Rock Ridge.

97
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:23,136
Yes, when that railroad
goes through Rock Ridge...

98
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:26,635
...that land will be worth
millions, and I want it!

99
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,776
I want that land so badly,
I can taste it.

100
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,484
There must be a way.

101
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:39,815
Clumsy fool!

102
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:44,017
Wait a minute! There might
be a legal precedent.

103
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,897
Of course! Land-snatching!

104
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:52,094
Land. La-land. "See 'Snatch'."

105
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:59,096
Haley vs. United States.
Haley, seven. United States, nothing.

106
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:02,172
You see, it can be done.
It can be done.

107
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:06,938
Unfortunately, there is one thing that
stands between me and that property.

108
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:08,614
The rightful owners.

109
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:12,282
There must be some way of scaring
them off, driving them out.

110
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:14,881
Getting rid of every human being
alive in that...

111
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:17,782
It's down the hall and to the left.

112
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:20,392
I've got it!

113
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:21,458
What? What?

114
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:24,694
I know how we can run
everybody out of Rock Ridge.

115
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:28,637
We'll kill the first-born male
child in every household!

116
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:31,904
Too Jewish.

117
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:39,306
We'll work up a Number Six on them!

118
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,110
I'm afraid I'm not familiar
with that one.

119
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,481
That's where we go
riding into town...

120
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:45,650
...and a-whapping and a-whooping
every living thing...

121
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:48,485
...that moves within an inch
of its life!

122
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:50,658
Except the women folks, of course.

123
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:51,982
You spare the women?

124
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:56,321
No, we rape the shit out of them
at the Number Six dance later on!

125
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:58,826
That's marvelous! That's so creative!

126
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:01,727
Why, Taggart, you've been hurt!

127
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:05,165
That uppity nigger hit me
on the head with a shovel.

128
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,906
I'd sure appreciate it, sir, if
you could find it in your heart...

129
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:13,238
...to hang him up by his
neck until he was dead.

130
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:15,072
Got him locked up downstairs.

131
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:17,579
Consider it done, stout fellow.

132
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:28,220
I've got a special.
When can you work him in?

133
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:32,931
I couldn't possibly fit him in
until Monday, sir. I'm booked solid.

134
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:34,759
Monday. Splendid.

135
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,472
Thank you, sir.
And don't you worry.

136
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,315
We'll make Rock Ridge
think it's a chicken...

137
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:50,247
...that got caught in a tractor's nuts!

138
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:58,925
It's all right, Taggart. Just a man
and a horse being hung out there.

139
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:08,728
"There was a peaceful town
called Rock Ridge,

140
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:13,070
"... where people lived in harmony.

141
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:18,137
"They never had no kind of trouble.

142
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:22,645
"There was no hint of misery.

143
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,425
"The town saloon was always lively...

144
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:35,430
"... but never nasty or obscene.

145
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,431
"Behind the bar stood Anal Johnson.

146
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:42,994
"He always kept things nice and clean!

147
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:48,205
"And all at once the trouble started.

148
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:51,369
"A pack of murderers and thieves...

149
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,506
"... like swarms of locusts
they descended...

150
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:57,642
"... their aim to make
the townsfolk flee. "

151
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,005
Well, that's the end of this suit!

152
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:39,427
Have you ever seen such cruelty?

153
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:46,824
"Now is a time of great decision.

154
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:53,498
"Are we to stay or up and quit?

155
00:14:56,378 --> 00:15:00,371
"There's no avoiding this conclusion.

156
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:07,845
"Our town is turning into shit!"

157
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:18,756
Well, I don't have to tell you
good folks...

158
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:22,368
...what has been happening
here in our beloved town.

159
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:27,538
Sheriff murdered, crops burned...

160
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:31,570
...stores looted, people stampeded...

161
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:33,710
...and cattle raped!

162
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:40,615
Now the time has come to act.
And act fast!

163
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,051
I'm leaving.

164
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:50,392
You get back here, you old
pious, candy-ass sidewinder!

165
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:54,796
There ain't no way that nobody
is going to leave this town!

166
00:15:56,605 --> 00:16:00,234
Hell, I was born here
and I was raised here...

167
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,840
...and goddamn it,
I'm going to die here!

168
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:06,773
And no sidewinder,
bushwhacking, hornswoggling...

169
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:11,416
...cracker croaker, is going
to ruin my biscuit-cutter!

170
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,027
Now who can argue with that?

171
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,930
I think we're all indebted
to Gabby Johnson...

172
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:29,168
...for clearly stating
what needed to be said.

173
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,198
I'm particularly glad that
these lovely children...

174
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,035
...were here today to hear that speech.

175
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:37,840
Not only was it authentic
frontier gibberish...

176
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:41,947
...it expressed a courage
little seen in this day and age!

177
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:45,285
What are we made of?

178
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,820
Our fathers came across the prairie...

179
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,954
...fought Indians, fought drought,
fought locusts, fought Dix!

180
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:56,958
Remember when Richard Dix came in here
and tried to take over this town?

181
00:16:57,966 --> 00:16:59,627
Well, we didn't give up then...

182
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:04,233
...and by gum, we're not
going to give up now!

183
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:11,138
Olson Johnson is right!

184
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:16,711
What kind of people are we, anyhow?
I say we stay and fight it out!

185
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:22,519
Dr. Samuel Johnson is right about
Olson Johnson's being right.

186
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:24,758
And I'm not giving up
my ice cream parlor...

187
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,522
...that I built with these two hands
for nothing or nobody!

188
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:30,825
Howard Johnson is right!

189
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:39,200
Well, if we're going to stay, and
I think it's a big mistake...

190
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:44,678
...we're going to need a new sheriff.
Now, who is it going to be?

191
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:48,876
Why don't we wire the governor
to send us a sheriff?

192
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:51,448
Why should we get our own men killed?

193
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,356
Howard Johnson is right.
We'll wire the governor.

194
00:17:56,792 --> 00:18:01,092
Then let us pray for the deliverance
of our new sheriff.

195
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:04,130
Will the congregation please rise?

196
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:10,465
I shall now read from the books
of Matthew, Mark, Luke...

197
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,030
...and duck!

198
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,277
We've got to do something at once!

199
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,521
Governor, may I disturb
you for a moment, sir?

200
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:35,860
If you will just sign this, governor.
Right here.

201
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:37,596
Yes, what the hell is it?

202
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:39,298
Well, under the provisions
of this bill...

203
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,599
...we would snatch 200,000 acres
of Indian territory...

204
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:44,973
...which we have deemed unsafe
for their use at this time.

205
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,008
They're such children.

206
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:49,869
200,000 acres!
200,000 acres!

207
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:52,004
What will it cost, man?
What will it cost?

208
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:55,777
A box of these.

209
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:59,118
Are you crazy? They'll never go
for it, and then again they might.

210
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:02,048
The little red devils, they
love toys. May I try one?

211
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:06,556
These things are defective.

212
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:11,565
Right as usual, sir.

213
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:13,566
Show-off!

214
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,961
Just sign this, sir. Right here.

215
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,772
Okay, give us a hand here.

216
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,965
Work, work, work.

217
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:24,143
Hello, boys, have a good night's rest?
I missed you.

218
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,970
Just one more bill for you to sign, sir.

219
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:28,305
What is this?

220
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,984
This is the bill that will convert
the State Hospital for the Insane...

221
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,756
...into the William J. Le Petomane
Memorial Gambling Casino for the Insane.

222
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,920
Gentlemen, this...

223
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,556
...this bill will be
a giant step forward...

224
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:40,925
...in the treatment
of the insane gambler.

225
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,920
Yes, bravo! Beautiful.

226
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:47,429
Thank you, Hedy. Thank you.

227
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,761
It's not Hedy. It's Hedley.
Hedley Lamarr.

228
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,404
What the hell are you worried about?

229
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:55,773
This is 1874.
You'll be able to sue her.

230
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:08,987
All right, help me in with this.

231
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:11,656
Just, ah, think of your secretary.

232
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,991
Ah, that was a very good suggestion.

233
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:17,798
Okay, is that it? Anything else?

234
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,361
Just this urgent telegram
from Rock Ridge.

235
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:21,962
It arrived last Friday.

236
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:24,463
Read it, read it.

237
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:29,905
"Sheriff murdered. Church meeting
bombed. Reign of terror must cease.

238
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:31,846
"Send new sheriff immediately. "

239
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,645
Holy underwear!

240
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:37,541
Sheriff murdered. Innocent women
and children blown to bits!

241
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:40,344
We've got to protect our
phony-baloney jobs, gentlemen.

242
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:44,018
We must do something about this
immediately, immediately, immediately!

243
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:48,560
I didn't get a "hrumph" out of that guy!

244
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:50,057
Give the governor a "hrumph. "

245
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,325
You watch your ass.

246
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:54,903
Gentlemen, please, rest your sphincters.

247
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,067
Well put.

248
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,400
As Attorney General, I can assure you...

249
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:03,202
...that a suitable sheriff will be found
to restore the peace in Rock Ridge.

250
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:04,876
Meeting is adjourned.

251
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:08,580
Oh, I am sorry, sir. I didn't mean
to overstep my bounds. You say that.

252
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:09,576
What?

253
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:10,748
- Meeting is adjourned.
- It is?

254
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:12,784
No. You say that, governor.

255
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,452
- What?
- Meeting is adjourned.

256
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,182
It is?

257
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:18,416
Here, play around with this for a while.
They are sweeping the country.

258
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:21,623
Why don't you give these out
to some of the boys...

259
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:23,660
...in lieu of pay? Here you go.

260
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:28,593
And one for Miss Stein,
my beloved secretary.

261
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:32,031
Play with these, boys,
in lieu of the other things.

262
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:35,099
This friggin' thing is warped.

263
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:39,044
Why do I always get a warped one?

264
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:46,620
A sheriff! But law and order
is the last thing I want.

265
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,054
Wait a minute. Maybe I could
turn this thing to my advantage.

266
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:58,726
If I could find a sheriff who so
offends the citizens of Rock Ridge...

267
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:02,126
...that his very appearance
would drive them out of town...

268
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,467
But where would I find such a man?

269
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:09,136
Why am I asking you?

270
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,951
Welcome to Hanging House.
Not to worry...

271
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:25,619
...everyone is equal in my eye.

272
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:45,373
Oh, not my ear!

273
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:50,316
Governor!

274
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:53,948
Official business, sir.

275
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:55,482
Is it important?

276
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,288
It's very crucial.

277
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,616
Be with you in a minute.

278
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:02,520
Throw something on
and stay in that position.

279
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:09,126
Forgive me, I was just, ah, walking
the parapet, taking a look around.

280
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,335
What can I do for you?

281
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:12,003
Governor, as per your instructions...

282
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:14,769
...I'd like you to meet
the new sheriff of Rock Ridge.

283
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,001
I'd be delighted... Wow!

284
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:20,381
I've got to talk to you. Come here.
Have you gone berserk?

285
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:23,111
Can't you see that man is a nig...

286
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:29,686
Wrong person. Forgive me.
No offense intended.

287
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:34,793
Have you gone berserk?
Can't you see that man is a nig?

288
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:36,594
Don't worry, sir.

289
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:39,193
Now, Hedley, I've always
trusted your judgment before...

290
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:41,497
...but haven't you taken a giant leap
away from your good senses?

291
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:43,901
Please, don't fly off the handle, sir.

292
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:46,404
I'm about to make you
an historic figure.

293
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,707
Maybe even get you a cabinet post.

294
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:51,239
A cabinet post!

295
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,744
Did you say that?

296
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:54,412
Wonderful!

297
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:58,947
Yes, the first man ever to appoint
a black sheriff! Just think, sir...

298
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:00,615
...Washington, Jefferson...

299
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:01,581
...Lincoln.

300
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:03,015
Le Petomane!

301
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:06,356
Sir, you have the seeds
of greatness in you.

302
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,763
Nurse them, caress them,
pour water on them.

303
00:24:10,398 --> 00:24:12,457
Don't short-change yourself, sir.

304
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,364
It will never work.
They'll kill him dead in one day!

305
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,937
One day is all we'll need to secure your
name in the annals of Western history.

306
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:23,836
And to get for you
a nomination for, dare I say...?

307
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,075
Dare, dare!

308
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:26,437
The Presidency!

309
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,915
Hail to the Chief!
Hail to the Chief!

310
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,888
"Four score and seven years ago...

311
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,357
"... our forefathers
brought forth on this... "

312
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,788
Are you coming back?

313
00:24:46,134 --> 00:24:46,964
In a moment, dear.

314
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:52,400
Gentlemen, affairs of state must take
precedent over the affairs of state.

315
00:24:53,175 --> 00:24:54,642
Yes, of course, sir, we understand.

316
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:56,469
Will you make all the arrangements?

317
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:58,142
I will make all the arrangements.

318
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,812
Especially the funeral.

319
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:05,949
Good luck, good luck, boys.
Wonderful working with you. Good luck!

320
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:14,215
Hurry up, get those flags up.
He'll be here soon.

321
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,024
I just got a telegram from
the governor's office.

322
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:19,954
The sheriff will be here at noon!

323
00:26:20,695 --> 00:26:24,187
Noon! I'd better rehearse my speech!

324
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:29,601
"As Honorary Chairman of
the Welcoming Committee...

325
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:34,601
"... it is my privilege to extend to you
a laurel and hearty handshake!"

326
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:37,339
Wonderful!

327
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,509
Excellent!

328
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,845
Can you see him yet?

329
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,110
The sheriff is coming!

330
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,683
Ring out the church bell!

331
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,708
Hey, the sheriff is a n...

332
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:11,776
What did he say?

333
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:13,580
The sheriff is near!

334
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:18,652
No, no, dag blame it, gol darn
it, the sheriff is a n...

335
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,039
As Chairman of the
Welcoming Committee...

336
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:48,044
...it is my privilege to extend a laurel
and hearty handshake to our new...

337
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,148
...nigger.

338
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,908
Excuse me while I whip this out.

339
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:33,320
"By the power vested in me by...

340
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,928
"... the Honorable
William J. Le Petomane...

341
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,099
"... I hereby assume the duties...

342
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:47,537
"... of the Office of Sheriff in and for
the Township of Rock Ridge. "

343
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:51,204
Gentlemen, let us not allow anger
to rule the day.

344
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,170
As your spiritual leader,
I implore you...

345
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:56,882
...to pay heed to this good
book and what it has to say.

346
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:03,053
Son, you're on your own!

347
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:08,757
Hold it!

348
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:12,259
The next man makes a move,
the nigger gets it!

349
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:19,567
Hold it, men. He's not bluffing.

350
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:22,775
Listen to him, men.
He's just crazy enough to do it.

351
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:26,478
Drop it! Or I swear I'll blow this
nigger's head all over this town!

352
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:32,848
Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate!
Do what he say! Do what he say!

353
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:52,631
Isn't anybody going to
help that poor man?

354
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:55,598
Hush, Harriet. That's a
sure way to get him killed.

355
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,504
Help me, help me...

356
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:01,179
...somebody help me!

357
00:30:03,852 --> 00:30:04,511
Shut up!

358
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:13,417
Oh, baby, you are so talented.

359
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:16,123
And they are so dumb!

360
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:25,628
Goddamn it!

361
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:27,202
I said, "Order"!

362
00:30:28,543 --> 00:30:33,207
You know, Nietzsche says,
"Out of chaos comes order. "

363
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:35,510
Oh, blow it out your ass, Howard!

364
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:40,444
Now everyone be quiet...

365
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:45,986
...whilst we listen to Harriet van
Johnson, our esteemed schoolmarm...

366
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:52,493
...as she reads a telegram that she
herself has composed to the governor...

367
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:58,799
...expressing our feelings
about the new sheriff.

368
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:08,872
"To the Honorable William J.
Le Petomane, Governor. "

369
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:10,707
Louder! Speak up! We can't hear you!

370
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:14,585
I'm not used to public speaking.

371
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:21,555
"We, the white, God-fearing
citizens of Rock Ridge...

372
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:26,765
"... wish to express
our extreme displeasure...

373
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:29,092
"... with your choice of sheriff.

374
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:32,706
"Please remove him immediately.

375
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:38,342
"The fact that you
have sent him here... "

376
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,844
"... just goes to prove that you are
the leading asshole in the state. "

377
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:10,577
The drunk in number two must be awake.

378
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:17,750
Are we awake?

379
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,780
We're not sure.

380
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:27,524
Are we black?

381
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:28,918
Yes, we are.

382
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:35,095
Then we're awake.
But we're very puzzled.

383
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:39,903
I think I better straighten myself out.

384
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:44,536
Need any help?

385
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:49,180
All I can get.

386
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:03,589
That's okay. Sit down over here.

387
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:16,833
Hey, maybe you should
eat something first.

388
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:20,176
No, thanks. Food makes me sick.

389
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:34,090
A man drinks like that and doesn't eat,
he is going to die.

390
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:37,594
When?

391
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:41,832
What's your name?

392
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:45,998
Well, my name is Jim,
but most people call me...

393
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:49,805
...Jim.

394
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,416
Okay, Jim, since you are my
guest and I am your host...

395
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:59,515
...what is your pleasure?
What do you like to do?

396
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:02,983
Oh, I don't know. Play chess...

397
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:06,117
...screw.

398
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:08,826
Well, let's play chess.

399
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:13,629
Checkmate.

400
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:17,533
Checkmate.

401
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:20,640
Why, you devious son-of-a-bitch!

402
00:34:21,509 --> 00:34:22,635
Happy days!

403
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,183
Man, why do you do that to yourself?

404
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:37,684
Oh, you don't really want to know that.

405
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:39,157
I do, I do!

406
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:41,286
Well, if you must pry.

407
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,788
I must, I must!

408
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:47,060
I don't know if you ever
heard of me before, but...

409
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:52,167
...I used to be called the Waco Kid.

410
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:57,472
The Waco Kid. He had the
fastest hands in the West!

411
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:00,475
In the world!

412
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:03,743
Well, if you're the Kid,
then show me something.

413
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:10,185
Maybe a couple of years ago I could
have shown you something, but today...

414
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:13,819
...look at that.

415
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,492
Steady as a rock.

416
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:18,190
Yes, but I shoot with this hand.

417
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:23,397
See, I knew you weren't the Waco Kid.
You were just pulling my lariat.

418
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,518
See that king?

419
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:44,223
Put your hands on both sides of it.

420
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,721
Now when I say, "go,"
you try to grab it first.

421
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,535
Man, that's no contest.
You're a mile away.

422
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,234
Anyway, when you hear the word
"go," you just try to grab it.

423
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:06,305
Ready?

424
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:28,699
You looking for this?

425
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:37,841
Well, raise my rent!
You are the Kid!

426
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:41,205
Was. Yeah, I was the Kid.

427
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:45,083
What happened?

428
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,886
Well, it got so that every
piss-ant prairie punk...

429
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,186
...who thought he could
shoot a gun...

430
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:54,292
...would ride into town
to try out the Waco Kid.

431
00:36:57,231 --> 00:37:00,530
I must have killed more men
than Cecil B. DeMille.

432
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:03,198
It got pretty gritty.

433
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:06,733
I started to hear the
word "draw" in my sleep.

434
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:10,735
Then one day...

435
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:16,376
...I was just walking down the street
and I heard a voice behind me say...

436
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:22,116
..."Reach for it, mister!"
I spun around.

437
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:26,887
And there I was face to face...

438
00:37:29,363 --> 00:37:32,025
...with a 6-year-old kid!

439
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,837
Well, I just threw my guns
down and walked away.

440
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,943
The little bastard shot me in the ass!

441
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:53,479
So I limped to the nearest saloon,
crawled inside a whiskey bottle...

442
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,785
...and I've been there ever since.

443
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,158
Have a drink.

444
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:15,002
Anyway, that's all ancient history.
Now you tell me your story.

445
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:19,642
What's a dazzling urbanite like you
doing in a rustic setting like this?

446
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:22,279
If you really must pry.

447
00:38:23,284 --> 00:38:24,808
I must, I must!

448
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:32,319
Well, back in '56...

449
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:36,456
...my folks and I were part
of this long wagon train...

450
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:38,020
...moving West.

451
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:53,844
Well, not exactly part of it.

452
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:58,911
You might say we were bringing up
the rear, when suddenly,

453
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,881
...from out of the West,
came the entire Sioux Nation!

454
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:07,160
And let me tell you, baby,
they were open for business!

455
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:15,065
Naturally, the white folks
didn't let us travel in their circle...

456
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:16,594
...so we made our own.

457
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,707
Shvartzes?

458
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:05,647
Luzem gayen!

459
00:40:10,424 --> 00:40:12,255
Cop a walk. It's all right.

460
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,323
Thank you.

461
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:17,659
Abi gezunt. Take off.

462
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,504
They're darker than us!

463
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,276
And the rest is history.

464
00:40:36,117 --> 00:40:37,277
Impressed?

465
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,657
Always like to keep my audience riveted.

466
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,138
How about some more beans,
Mr. Taggart?

467
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:43,245
I'd say you've had enough!

468
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:51,487
I understand there's a new sheriff
in town. Who wants to kill him?

469
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:01,566
Why don't we give him to Mongo?

470
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,430
Holy shit, that's too cruel!

471
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:11,705
I'll be danged! That is a unique idea!

472
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,354
Down, boy, down, boy,
down, Mongo!

473
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,283
Hey, it's me. Taggart.

474
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:26,453
Here, smell. Smell.

475
00:42:30,397 --> 00:42:32,228
That's a good Mongo.

476
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:37,628
Hey, how about it? How would you
like to mutilate that new sheriff?

477
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,303
Have a cigar.

478
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,312
Oh, by the way,
I got a note this morning.

479
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,518
From who?

480
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:33,020
Well, I'm not sure.
It was addressed to the Deputy Spade.

481
00:43:37,298 --> 00:43:40,131
Well, once I establish
myself in this town...

482
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:43,800
...Deputy Spade might turn
out to be a groovy position.

483
00:43:53,947 --> 00:43:56,973
Listen, Bart,
I want you to do me a favor.

484
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,152
I don't want you going
out there this morning.

485
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:02,785
You can't win these people
over, no matter what you do.

486
00:44:03,157 --> 00:44:04,715
They're just not going to accept you.

487
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:18,394
I'm glad those fingers ain't loaded!

488
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,703
Just like old times.

489
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:32,679
Like I told you, once you establish
yourself, they've got to accept you.

490
00:44:34,188 --> 00:44:35,177
Catch you later.

491
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:40,921
Good luck.

492
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,559
Ah, good morning, ma'am.

493
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,430
And isn't it a lovely morning?

494
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,708
Up yours, nigger!

495
00:45:01,382 --> 00:45:04,442
What did you expect?
"Welcome, sonny. "

496
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:07,118
"Make yourself at home. "

497
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:13,286
"Marry my daughter. " You've got to
remember these are just simple farmers.

498
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,960
These are people of the land.

499
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,196
The common clay of the new West.

500
00:45:22,936 --> 00:45:23,960
You know.

501
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,129
Morons!

502
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:32,943
What the hell is that?

503
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,320
Mongo! Santa María!

504
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:55,634
I believe in it.
And if any one of you...

505
00:45:55,803 --> 00:45:57,395
...friends and neighbors,
kind of gather around and...

506
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,939
Holy shit!

507
00:46:05,112 --> 00:46:09,811
And they say that now in Paris,
France, even as we speak...

508
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:14,151
...Louis Pasteur has devised
a new vaccine...

509
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:17,154
...that will obliterate anthrax
once and for all.

510
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:25,329
Hey, you can't park
that animal over there!

511
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,791
It's illegal.

512
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:39,035
Think of it, gentlemen. Hoof-and-
mouth disease a thing of the past!

513
00:46:39,847 --> 00:46:43,283
Never mind that shit,
here comes Mongo!

514
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,887
I don't know what it is.

515
00:46:58,031 --> 00:46:59,999
Sheriff, Mongo's back!
He's breaking up the whole town!

516
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,967
You've got to help us, please!

517
00:47:02,035 --> 00:47:04,333
Did you hear that? Now it's "please. "

518
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:09,131
This morning I couldn't get the time
of day. Who is this Mongo, anyway?

519
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:12,502
Well, Mongo ain't exactly a "who. "
He's more of a "what. "

520
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:13,878
What he said.

521
00:47:14,214 --> 00:47:15,306
Well, I don't know...

522
00:47:15,883 --> 00:47:18,181
Oh, thank you very much!

523
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,648
The fool's going to...

524
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:24,490
I mean, the sheriff's going to do it.

525
00:47:30,497 --> 00:47:34,763
No, no, don't do that! If you shoot
him, you'll just make him mad.

526
00:47:46,213 --> 00:47:47,544
Candygram for Mongo!

527
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:01,520
Me, Mongo.

528
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,122
Sign, please.

529
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:15,701
Mongo like candy.

530
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:24,874
A little further down, to the right.

531
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,212
I thought sure that Mongo
would mash him up...

532
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:30,279
...into little bitty sheriff meatballs.

533
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,390
I just don't understand it.

534
00:48:32,726 --> 00:48:33,886
Be still, Taggart.

535
00:48:34,928 --> 00:48:37,556
My mind is a raging torrent...

536
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:39,798
...flooded with rivulets of thought...

537
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,233
...cascading into a waterfall
of creative alternatives.

538
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:46,664
Gol darn it, Mr. Lamarr...

539
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,441
...you use your tongue prettier
than a $20 whore.

540
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:58,378
Wait a minute, that's it!

541
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,817
And it will work!

542
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,680
You bet it will! What will work?

543
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:06,615
Elementary, cactus-head!

544
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,291
The beast has failed.

545
00:49:08,428 --> 00:49:11,295
And when the beast fails,
it's time to call in beauty.

546
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,259
Beauty?

547
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,934
She's never failed me before.
She'll turn him into jelly!

548
00:49:20,273 --> 00:49:22,264
She'll bring him to his knees!

549
00:49:24,811 --> 00:49:27,746
Where's my froggie?
Where's my froggie?

550
00:49:28,081 --> 00:49:30,208
I don't know.
I didn't see it when I came in.

551
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,074
Damn your eyes, look for it!

552
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,092
Oh, there it is.

553
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:51,566
That was a close one! Daddy loves
Froggie. Froggie love Daddy?

554
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,306
I don't know how you did it.

555
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:05,114
He was nothing.

556
00:50:05,452 --> 00:50:07,977
The bitch was inventing
the candygram.

557
00:50:08,055 --> 00:50:10,546
They probably won't give me
credit for it.

558
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:21,333
Good evening, sheriff.

559
00:50:21,668 --> 00:50:24,102
Sorry about the "Up yours, nigger. "

560
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:28,170
I hope this apple pie will in some
small way say thank you for your...

561
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:32,171
...ingenuity and courage in
defeating that horrible Mongo.

562
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:35,170
Thank you. Much obliged.
Good night.

563
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,419
Of course, you'll have the good taste
not to mention that I spoke to you.

564
00:50:54,935 --> 00:50:59,372
I'm rapidly becoming a big
underground success in this town.

565
00:50:59,706 --> 00:51:03,540
See, in another 25 years you'll be able
to shake their hands in broad daylight.

566
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,378
Well, I'm not going to
hold my breath for it.

567
00:51:06,747 --> 00:51:11,150
Come on, I don't want to be late.
Lili von Shtupp is opening tonight.

568
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:13,216
Lili von who?

569
00:51:28,068 --> 00:51:32,164
Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome.
Come on in.

570
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:39,678
It's Hedley. For you, my dear.

571
00:51:41,114 --> 00:51:44,049
Oh, how ordinary.

572
00:51:47,888 --> 00:51:50,755
Oh, Lili, Lili, Lili, legs, Lili, Lili!

573
00:51:52,425 --> 00:51:55,417
I can't find the words to
truly express my joy...

574
00:51:55,629 --> 00:51:57,688
...at the rekindling of our association.

575
00:51:58,465 --> 00:52:01,093
Bullshit, what's the job?

576
00:52:03,436 --> 00:52:05,097
I love it when you talk dirty.

577
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,515
Come on, Lamarr, let's get down to
bwass tacks.

578
00:52:20,654 --> 00:52:22,815
What do you want me to do?

579
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:28,326
I want you to seduce and abandon
the sheriff of Rock Ridge.

580
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:30,089
You think you can do it?

581
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,300
Is Bismark a hewwing?

582
00:52:34,668 --> 00:52:37,796
Oh, Lili, you're magnificent! Kiss me!

583
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:54,612
And now, folks, the gal
you've all been waiting for...

584
00:52:55,055 --> 00:52:59,754
...the Bavarian Bombshell herself!
Let's hear it for Lili von Shtupp!

585
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:16,172
"Here I stand, the goddess of desire...

586
00:53:16,843 --> 00:53:20,779
"... set men on fire.
I have this power.

587
00:53:22,582 --> 00:53:26,040
"Morning, noon and night,
it's drink and dancing...

588
00:53:26,553 --> 00:53:31,217
"... some quick romancing,
and then a shower.

589
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:35,851
"Stage door Johnnies
constantly surround me...

590
00:53:36,196 --> 00:53:39,688
"... they always hound
me with one request.

591
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,895
"Who can satisfy their lustful habit?

592
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:50,469
"I'm not a rabbit. I need some rest.

593
00:53:58,418 --> 00:54:00,010
"I'm tired...

00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,685

603
00:54:49,169 --> 00:54:51,160
"... and always too soon. "

604
00:54:52,105 --> 00:54:53,436
Right, girls?

605
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:58,537
"I'm tired.
Tired of playing the game.

606

Goddamn it, I'm exhausted!

609
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,960
Hello, cowboy, what's your name?

610
00:55:17,097 --> 00:55:19,998
"Tex ma'am"? Tell me, Tex ma'am...

611
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,766
...are you in show business?

612
00:55:22,102 --> 00:55:22,761
Nope.

613
00:55:23,003 --> 00:55:25,972
Well, then, why don't you get your
friggin' feet off the stage?

614
00:55:39,853 --> 00:55:44,517
Hello, handsome. Is that a 10-gallon
hat, or are you just enjoying the show?

615
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,435
Oh, Miss Lili, oh, my lovely lady!

616

of men again and again.

628
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,054
"They sing the same tune!

629
00:56:59,065 --> 00:57:02,398
"They start with Byron and Shelley...

630
00:57:02,735 --> 00:57:06,899
"... then jump on your belly,
and bust your balloon.

631
00:57:13,746 --> 00:57:16,408
"Tired of playing the game.

632
00:57:18,118 --> 00:57:20,780
"Ain't it a friggin' shame?

633
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,020
"I'm so... "

634
00:57:24,824 --> 00:57:29,523
Let's face it. Everything
below the waist is kaput!

635
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:05,923
What does it say?

636
00:58:06,766 --> 00:58:11,226
"I must see you alone in my dwessing
woom right after the show. "

637
00:58:26,386 --> 00:58:28,718
Wie gehts, meine schatzie?

638
00:58:29,689 --> 00:58:30,747
Faw out!

639
00:58:35,895 --> 00:58:39,228
A wed wose. How womantic!

640
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:42,328
Have a seat, shewiff.

641
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:49,899
Won't you excuse me for a moment...

642
00:58:50,076 --> 00:58:53,068
...while I slip into something
a little bit more comfortable?

643
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:57,849
Bitte, baby.

644
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:08,418
Why don't you loosen your bullets?

645
00:59:14,734 --> 00:59:17,294
Ahh, I feel wefweshed!

646
00:59:18,238 --> 00:59:20,229
Isn't it bwight in here?

647
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,547
There! Isn't that better?

648
00:59:31,884 --> 00:59:33,977
Pardon me, I'll be back in a moment.

649
00:59:38,057 --> 00:59:38,921
How is it going?

650
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:43,662
He's like wet sauerkraut in my hands.
By morning he will be my slave.

651
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:44,759
Splendid.

652
00:59:45,298 --> 00:59:46,788
Oh, just let me have a little feel.

653
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:50,464
Where were we? Where are you?

654
00:59:52,572 --> 00:59:54,733
Let me sit down next to you.

655
00:59:57,243 --> 00:59:58,574
Tell me, schatzie...

656
00:59:59,479 --> 01:00:03,916
...is it, ah, twu what they say
about the way you people are gifted?

657
01:00:06,452 --> 01:00:09,615
Oh, it's twu, it's twu!

658
01:00:15,828 --> 01:00:17,921
Vill you care for
another schnitzengruben?

659
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:22,325
No, thank you. Fifteen is my
limit on schnitzengruben.

660
01:00:23,169 --> 01:00:25,763
Well, then, how about a little...?

661
01:00:29,275 --> 01:00:32,608
Baby, please, I am not from Havana.

662
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,877
Excuse me, honey...

663
01:00:35,348 --> 01:00:39,114
...besides, I'm late for work.
I've got some heavy chores to do.

664
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,381
Vill I, vill I see you later?

665
01:00:43,323 --> 01:00:47,657
That all depends on how much
Vitamin E I can get my hands on.

666
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,188
Nein, nein, achtung!

667
01:00:49,962 --> 01:00:52,692
No, no, you mustn't go! I need you!

668
01:00:52,865 --> 01:00:55,857
I never met nobody like you!
I can't live without you!

669
01:00:58,705 --> 01:01:02,698
Please, you're making
a German spectacle of yourself.

670
01:01:05,211 --> 01:01:06,872
Auf wiedersehen, baby.

671
01:01:14,153 --> 01:01:16,212
Oh, what a nice guy.

672
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:27,730
Oh, deary, dear.
Look what the cat dragged in.

673
01:01:41,013 --> 01:01:42,844
What's happening in the clean world?

674
01:01:43,716 --> 01:01:44,683
Bad news.

675
01:01:45,385 --> 01:01:49,754
I've got a writ here for Mongo's
release signed by Hedley Lamarr himself.

676
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,857
Why would a dude like
Hedley Lamarr care about Mongo?

677
01:02:00,933 --> 01:02:01,763
It's legal.

678
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:08,038
Oh, those schnitzengrubens
can wipe you out!

679
01:02:15,581 --> 01:02:16,912
Wake up time!

680
01:02:23,222 --> 01:02:25,884
Okay, Mongo. You're free to go.

681
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:28,651
Mongo no go.

682
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:34,989
Oh, come on, Mongo.
You're a free man.

683
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:41,467
Mongo stay with Sheriff Bart.
Sheriff first man ever whip Mongo.

684
01:02:43,276 --> 01:02:47,178
Mongo impressed, have deep
feelings for Sheriff Bart.

685
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:51,509
Oh, you better watch out, big fella.

686
01:02:52,084 --> 01:02:54,814
I think Mongo's taken
a little fancy to you.

687
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:00,486
Mongo straight.

688
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,662
Maybe you know why a high-roller...

689
01:03:07,733 --> 01:03:10,031
...like Hedley Lamarr is interested
in Rock Ridge.

690
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:15,102
Don't know. Got to do
with where choo-choo go.

691
01:03:18,611 --> 01:03:22,672
Mongo, why would Hedley Lamarr care
about where the choo-choo goes?

692
01:03:23,649 --> 01:03:24,775
Don't know.

693
01:03:26,686 --> 01:03:30,884
Mongo only pawn in game of life.

694
01:03:34,694 --> 01:03:36,184
I think this might be a good time
to mosey out...

695
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:38,694
...to where they're building
the railroad...

696
01:03:38,965 --> 01:03:40,626
...and maybe do a little snooping.

697
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,332
Damn, damn, damn!

698
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:32,111
Hey, how are you doing Bart?
Get down off that horse!

699
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:41,193
Oh, you shifty nigger!
They said you were hung!

700
01:04:41,527 --> 01:04:42,585
And they were right!

701
01:04:42,929 --> 01:04:45,864
Look at that star, hoo-ee!
Civil service!

702
01:04:49,602 --> 01:04:51,092
Wait. Back off, scamp.

703
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:54,262
You are addressing the duly appointed
sheriff of Rock Ridge.

704
01:04:55,207 --> 01:04:58,074
Rock Ridge? Hey, the railroad
is going through there!

705
01:05:14,093 --> 01:05:17,494
Back up off your brother!
Don't mess up your brother!

706
01:05:35,081 --> 01:05:36,912
Holy mother of pearl!

707
01:05:37,783 --> 01:05:40,809
It's that nigger that hit me
on the head with the shovel!

708
01:05:41,587 --> 01:05:44,988
Now what the hell do you think you're
doing with that tin star, boy?

709
01:05:45,324 --> 01:05:49,988
Watch that "boy" shit, redneck! You're
talking to the sheriff of Rock Ridge.

710
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,123
Well, now if that don't beat all!

711
01:05:54,967 --> 01:05:57,265
Here we take the good time
and trouble...

712
01:05:57,336 --> 01:05:59,668
...to slaughter every last Indian
in the West, and for what?

713
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,604
So they can appoint a sheriff
that's blacker than any Indian!

714
01:06:06,779 --> 01:06:08,178
I am depressed.

715
01:06:08,648 --> 01:06:12,049
Excuse me, Mr. Taggart, sir, but I
sure do hate to see you like this.

716
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:15,013
What if me and the boys were to
shoot that nigger dead?

717
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:17,180
Would that pep you up some?

718
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,315
Well, it might help.

719
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,386
All right, boys. On the count of three.

720
01:06:22,128 --> 01:06:24,460
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

721
01:06:25,364 --> 01:06:27,025
Don't pay no attention to that alky.

722
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,531
He can't even hold a gun,
much less shoot it.

723
01:06:32,705 --> 01:06:34,468
Like I said. On the count of three.

724
01:06:36,876 --> 01:06:37,535
One...

725
01:06:39,845 --> 01:06:40,504
...two...

726
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,039
...three!

727
01:06:53,826 --> 01:06:58,490
Well, just don't sit there looking
stupid, grasping your hands in pain.

728
01:06:59,331 --> 01:07:02,892
How about a little applause
for the Waco Kid?

729
01:07:14,013 --> 01:07:16,777
All right, I'm through being
Mr. Goodbar!

730
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:19,647
The time has come to act
and act quickly!

731
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,116
All my plans have backfired!

732
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,552
Instead of the people leaving,
they're staying in droves!

733
01:07:23,889 --> 01:07:27,916
Vhy don't you admit it?
He's too much of man for you. I know.

734
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,125
You going to need an army to beat him!

735
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:32,186
You're finished.

736
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:37,195
Fertig! Fahrblunged! Fahrcocked!

737
01:07:43,676 --> 01:07:46,338
Shut up! You Teutonic twat!

738
01:07:47,747 --> 01:07:49,442
I must think.

739
01:07:58,023 --> 01:08:02,323
Wait a minute. She said army.
Of course!

740
01:08:02,928 --> 01:08:07,592
An army of the worst dregs ever
to soil the face of the West!

741
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:15,604
I've decided to launch an attack that
will reduce Rock Ridge to ashes!

742
01:08:16,275 --> 01:08:17,606
What do you want me to do, sir?

743
01:08:18,043 --> 01:08:21,376
I want you to round up every vicious
criminal and gunslinger in the West.

744
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,469
Take this down.

745
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:28,085
I want rustlers, cutthroats,
murderers, bounty hunters...

746
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:32,686
...desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs,
nitwits, half-wits, dimwits...

747
01:08:32,992 --> 01:08:37,588
...vipers, snipers, con men,
Indian agents, Mexican bandits...

748
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:41,195
...muggers, buggerers,
bushwackers, hornswagglers...

749
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:45,368
...horse thieves, bull dykes, train
robbers, bank robbers, ass kickers...

750
01:08:45,504 --> 01:08:47,904
...shit kickers and Methodists!

751
01:08:50,476 --> 01:08:52,307
Could you repeat that, sir?

752
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:03,452
Where's everybody going?

753
01:09:05,457 --> 01:09:06,219
Read this.

754
01:09:16,936 --> 01:09:20,497
Well, can't you see that's the
last act of a desperate man?

755
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:25,804
We don't care if it's the First Act of
Henry the Fifth! We're leaving!

756
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:30,473
Now, wait a minute!
Wait just one doggoned minute!

757
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:36,414
Just give me 24 hours to come up
with a brilliant idea to save our town.

758
01:09:36,989 --> 01:09:39,856
Just 24 hours, that's all I ask.

759
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:41,451
No!

760
01:09:42,528 --> 01:09:44,462
You'd do it for Randolph Scott.

761
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:53,070
All right, sheriff. 24 hours.

762
01:10:53,632 --> 01:10:54,326
Next!

763
01:10:55,868 --> 01:10:56,835
Qualifications?

764
01:10:57,369 --> 01:10:59,633
Rape, murder, arson and rape.

765
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,636
You said rape twice.

766
01:11:02,574 --> 01:11:03,563
I like rape.

767
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,745
Charming. Sign right here.

768
01:11:10,215 --> 01:11:11,546
Take that badge.

769
01:11:15,654 --> 01:11:16,586
Qualifications?

770
01:11:17,289 --> 01:11:20,417
Arson, armed robbery, mayhem.

771
01:11:20,793 --> 01:11:24,285
Wait a moment. What have
you got in your mouth?

772
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:29,594
Nothing, eh? Lyle.

773
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:33,633
Gum!

774
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,933
Chewing gum on line, eh?

775
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:40,174
I hope you brought enough
for everybody.

776
01:11:42,081 --> 01:11:43,912
I didn't know there was
going to be so many.

777
01:11:49,455 --> 01:11:51,446
Boy, is he strict!

778
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:54,687
We've got to get in there close
and find out what's happening.

779
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:57,688
There's our ticket!

780
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:06,062
Hey, boys!

781
01:12:07,706 --> 01:12:09,139
Look what I've got there!

782
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:13,107
Hey, where are the white women at?

783
01:12:27,693 --> 01:12:29,456
Man, that was pretty! I liked that.

784
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:34,429
Be ready to attack Rock Ridge at
noon tomorrow. Here's your badge.

785
01:12:38,237 --> 01:12:41,035
We don't need no stinkin' badges!

786
01:12:43,175 --> 01:12:43,834
Next!

787
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:45,340
Qualifications?

788
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:47,510
Stampeding cattle.

789
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,470
That's not much of a crime.

790
01:12:49,815 --> 01:12:51,146
Through the Vatican!

791
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:52,639
Kinky!

792
01:12:56,021 --> 01:12:58,319
Why, Rhett, how many times
have I told you...

793
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:00,688
...to wash up after
weekly cross-burning?

794
01:13:01,326 --> 01:13:02,452
See, it's coming off.

795
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:08,622
And now, for my next impression,
Jesse Owens!

796
01:13:10,402 --> 01:13:11,664
Catch them!

797
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:17,041
Hold up, men,
we'll head them off at the pass!

798
01:13:18,343 --> 01:13:22,677
Head them off at the pass?
I hate that cliché!

799
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,224
Say, "hello. "

800
01:13:42,734 --> 01:13:43,496
Hello.

801
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:46,470
Listen to me, and listen to me good.

802
01:13:46,605 --> 01:13:48,937
I want you to get
all the brothers together...

803
01:13:49,274 --> 01:13:53,233
...round up all the lumber, canvas, paint
and nails you can lay your hands on...

804
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:58,243
...and meet me tonight 3 miles
due east of Rock Ridge at midnight.

805
01:13:59,051 --> 01:13:59,813
You understand?

806
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,383
Say, "goodbye. "

807
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:04,382
Thanks a lot, brother.

808
01:14:33,418 --> 01:14:36,512
All right, folks, I know you're a bit
confused wondering what you're doing...

809
01:14:36,588 --> 01:14:38,818
...out in the middle of the prairie
in the middle of the night.

810
01:14:38,957 --> 01:14:40,083
You bet your ass!

811
01:14:41,326 --> 01:14:42,293
I'm hip.

812
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:44,553
Now, before the sun comes up...

813
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:50,631
...we're going to build on this sight an
exact replica of the town of Rock Ridge.

814
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:57,131
Every building, every storefront,
every rock and every tree...

815
01:14:57,476 --> 01:15:00,877
...right down to the orange roof
on Howard Johnson's outhouse.

816
01:15:02,481 --> 01:15:03,470
I get it!

817
01:15:03,815 --> 01:15:06,545
And tomorrow when Hedley Lamarr
and his men come riding in...

818
01:15:06,685 --> 01:15:07,879
...to destroy the real Rock Ridge...

819
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,011
...they'll actually be destroying
the fake Rock Ridge!

820
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:12,522
But they'll think
it's the real Rock Ridge!

821
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,491
But we'll know it's the fake Rock Ridge!

822
01:15:14,826 --> 01:15:18,159
How're we going to do it? We don't
have the time nor the people.

823
01:15:18,497 --> 01:15:20,761
Wrong! There's why.

824
01:15:23,635 --> 01:15:25,535
Who the hell are they?

825
01:15:29,408 --> 01:15:34,107
Railroad workers. They've agreed
to help us make our dream come true.

826
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:37,081
And all they ask in return
is a little plot of land...

827
01:15:37,216 --> 01:15:39,207
...they can call their own to homestead.

828
01:15:39,551 --> 01:15:40,677
What do you say?

829
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:51,653
We'll give some land to the niggers
and the chinks...

830
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:54,492
...but we don't want the Irish!

831
01:15:59,938 --> 01:16:01,030
No deal.

832
01:16:02,074 --> 01:16:05,635
Ah, prairie shit! Everybody!

833
01:16:10,449 --> 01:16:11,416
Oh, Lord...

834
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:17,315
...do we have the strength to carry on
this mighty task in one night?

835
01:16:20,058 --> 01:16:22,390
Or are we just jerking off?

836
01:16:33,138 --> 01:16:37,802
Okay, okay, we have done it.
Now, let's see what we have done.

837
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:22,747
Men, you are about to embark
on a great crusade...

838
01:17:23,755 --> 01:17:26,246
...to stamp out runaway
decency in the West.

839
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:29,188
Now you will only
be risking your lives...

840
01:17:29,628 --> 01:17:34,190
...whilst I will be risking an almost
certain Academy Award nomination...

841
01:17:35,367 --> 01:17:36,800
...for Best Supporting Actor.

842
01:17:37,703 --> 01:17:39,694
Now raise your right
hand for the pledge.

843
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,038
Right!

844
01:17:44,876 --> 01:17:47,640
And repeat after me. I...

845
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:50,214
...your name...

846
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:51,879
...your name...

847
01:17:52,217 --> 01:17:55,277
Schmucks!
... pledge allegiance...

848
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:56,951
...pledge allegiance...

849
01:17:57,322 --> 01:17:58,880
...to Hedley Lamarr...

850
01:17:59,224 --> 01:18:00,782
...to Hedy Lamarr...

851
01:18:01,126 --> 01:18:02,115
That's Hedley!

852
01:18:02,461 --> 01:18:03,655
...that's Hedley...

853
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,723
...and to the evil...

854
01:18:06,064 --> 01:18:07,554
...and to the evil...

855
01:18:07,899 --> 01:18:09,560
...for which he stands!

856
01:18:09,901 --> 01:18:11,300
...for which he stands!

857
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:16,334
Now go do that voodoo
that you do so well!

858
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:32,252
Hold the happiness. We are in trouble.

859
01:18:33,658 --> 01:18:36,126
Yep! We forgot one little detail.

860
01:18:36,361 --> 01:18:40,092
Nothing is missing. Everything is here,
down to the last hitching post.

861
01:18:40,665 --> 01:18:42,826
People. There are no people.

862
01:18:43,168 --> 01:18:45,602
Now don't panic. Don't panic.

863
01:18:46,371 --> 01:18:49,169
We just made a perfect copy
of Rock Ridge.

864
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:52,932
Now all we've got to do is make
perfect copies of ourselves.

865
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:56,440
But they'll be here in half an hour.

866
01:18:56,782 --> 01:18:58,943
Right, so we've got to
start working fast.

867
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:03,048
You men start working on the dummies.
Jim and Mongo, come with me.

868
01:19:03,622 --> 01:19:07,285
I've got an idea that will
slow them down to a crawl.

869
01:19:07,626 --> 01:19:08,524
All right, let's go!

870
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,726
Yeah, that's nice.

871
01:19:40,892 --> 01:19:45,556
Le Petomane Thruway! Now what
will that asshole think of next?

872
01:19:48,166 --> 01:19:50,157
Has anybody got a dime?

873
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:55,033
Somebody's got to go back
and get a shit-load of dimes.

874
01:20:04,249 --> 01:20:08,185
Hurry up. Speed it up or we're
never going to get to Rock Ridge!

875
01:20:08,753 --> 01:20:11,517
Come on, move them through!

876
01:20:17,762 --> 01:20:19,696
Well, they're through the tollbooth.

877
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,691
Look at this, they're buying it!

878
01:20:35,046 --> 01:20:38,482
All right, here we go.
Hold your ears, folks!

879
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:40,542
It's show time!

880
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:46,120
Nothing!

881
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:47,720
What are we going to do?

882
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:51,458
Any minute now they're going to discover
the town is fake and pull out!

883
01:20:53,965 --> 01:20:56,490
You think you could squeeze off
a little shot from here...

884
01:20:56,568 --> 01:20:58,559
...and set off the dynamite down there?

885
01:20:59,671 --> 01:21:01,002
I'll give it a try.

886
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:14,983
Oh, Lord, keep this man's eye keen...

887
01:21:15,253 --> 01:21:17,244
...and may God grant...

888
01:21:29,434 --> 01:21:30,662
It's a fake!

889
01:21:31,002 --> 01:21:32,594
We've been suckered in!

890
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:53,224
Okay, folks, let's wipe them out!

891
01:22:17,816 --> 01:22:19,249
Forgive me, Lord!

892
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:24,405
"Throw out your hands,
stick out your tush.

893
01:23:24,482 --> 01:23:26,473
"Hands on your hips,
give them a push.

894
01:23:26,785 --> 01:23:30,118
"You'll be surprised, you're doing
the French Mistake. Voilà!"

895
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:34,122
All right, cut!

896
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:40,219
Wrong!

897
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:46,893
Just watch me. It's so simple!

898
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:48,569
You sissy Marys!

899
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:53,609
Give me the playback.
And watch me, faggots!

900
01:24:06,991 --> 01:24:07,923
Have you got it?

901
01:24:08,259 --> 01:24:09,487
Yessssssss.

902
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,157
Sounds like steam escaping!

903
01:24:12,697 --> 01:24:15,860
Action! Okay, wait until I get out.

904
01:24:46,631 --> 01:24:50,567
Cut! What in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

905
01:24:50,902 --> 01:24:52,802
This is a closed set!

906
01:24:53,872 --> 01:24:56,534
Piss on you!
I'm working for Mel Brooks.

907
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:58,809
Not in the face!

908
01:25:00,745 --> 01:25:01,677
Thank you.

909
01:25:02,213 --> 01:25:05,182
They've hit Buddy!
Come on, girls!

910
01:25:14,893 --> 01:25:16,554
You vulgar shit!

911
01:25:16,995 --> 01:25:19,657
Why, you miserable pansy!

912
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,996
I'm parked over by the commissary.

913
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:34,367
You brute, you brute,
you vicious brute!

914
01:25:36,114 --> 01:25:38,105
All right, all right...

915
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:54,725
How many days do you have left, Joey?

916
01:25:55,099 --> 01:25:57,567
They lose me right
after the bunker scene.

917
01:26:00,138 --> 01:26:01,230
What the hell is that?

918
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:09,912
Get your pies for the great pie fight!

919
01:26:14,152 --> 01:26:17,053
This is our Studio commissary
where some Hollywood stars...

920
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:18,816
...come to eat. Keep in line.

921
01:26:26,331 --> 01:26:28,925
And now we'll go to the
Special Effects Department.

922
01:26:33,838 --> 01:26:37,035
Yankee bean soup, cole slaw
and tuna surprise.

923
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:18,471
Taxi!

924
01:27:23,922 --> 01:27:25,480
Drive me off this picture!

925
01:27:54,919 --> 01:27:56,011
You dropped your beads.

926
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:57,343
One, please.

927
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,521
Uh, student.

928
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:02,014
Are you kidding?

929
01:28:04,595 --> 01:28:05,755
Pain in the ass.

930
01:28:06,397 --> 01:28:08,729
Look, Herman,
I'm in Hedy Lamarr's shoes!

931
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:09,863
Hedley!

932
01:28:38,963 --> 01:28:39,793
Freeze it!

933
01:28:40,798 --> 01:28:43,062
Okay, Lamarr, go for your gun.

934
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:46,461
Wait, wait, I'm unarmed.

935
01:28:46,971 --> 01:28:49,906
All right, we'll settle it like men.

936
01:28:51,476 --> 01:28:52,443
With our fists.

937
01:28:53,811 --> 01:28:57,611
Sorry, I just remembered. I am armed.

938
01:29:05,189 --> 01:29:09,853
How did he do such fantastic stunts
with such little feet?

939
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:17,494
You shot the bad guy!

940
01:29:20,038 --> 01:29:21,505
Well, what do you want to do now?

941
01:29:22,206 --> 01:29:24,538
Come on, let's check out
the end of the flick.

942
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:28,207
I sure hope there's a happy ending.
I love a happy ending.

943
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:36,845
Sheriff, you can't go now.
We need you.

944
01:29:37,555 --> 01:29:41,116
My work here is done.
I'm needed elsewhere now.

945
01:29:41,893 --> 01:29:44,862
I'm needed wherever
outlaws rule the West.

946
01:29:45,196 --> 01:29:49,189
Wherever innocent women and children
are afraid to walk the streets.

947
01:29:49,867 --> 01:29:52,631
Wherever a man cannot
live in simple dignity.

948
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:56,701
Wherever people cry out for justice.

949
01:29:57,542 --> 01:29:58,873
Bullshit!

950
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,010
All right, you caught me.

951
01:30:03,114 --> 01:30:06,345
To speak the plain truth, it's getting
pretty damn dull around here.

952
01:30:07,085 --> 01:30:10,316
Good luck, Bart, and God bless you.

953
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,891
'Bye, baby brother.

954
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:20,725
Keep the faith, brothers!

955
01:30:37,215 --> 01:30:38,705
Where are you headed, cowboy?

956
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:41,344
Nowhere special.

957
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:49,019
Nowhere special.
I always wanted to go there.

958
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:51,790
Come on!

959
01:31:23,127 --> 01:31:26,893
"He conquered fear and
he conquered hate. "

960
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:30,564
"He turned our night into day. "

961
01:31:40,565 --> 01:31:43,365
