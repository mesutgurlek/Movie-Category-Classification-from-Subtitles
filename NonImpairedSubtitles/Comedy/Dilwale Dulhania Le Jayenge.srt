1
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,953
London. The greatest city
in the world.

2
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:47,830
For 22 years, I've lived here

3
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:50,699
Every morning I take a walk
down this street

4
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:54,096
Every morning, the street asks me
my name...

5
00:00:55,305 --> 00:01:00,709
Chaudhary Baldev Singh? Who are you?
Where are you from? Why are you here?

6
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:06,711
Do I have a reply? After half
a lifetime spent here...

7
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:10,216
this land still remains alien
to me; and I to it

8
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:17,694
No one here knows me. None except
these doves. Because they're like me

9
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,825
Neither do they belong to a country.
Just drop down where you find food

10
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,234
Have your fill, then fly on

11
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:31,835
When shall I fly? I don't know.
Of necessity, my wings are clipped

12
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,109
I'm shackled to my bread.
But someday I'll surely go...

13
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:43,718
to my land. To my Punjab

14
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:59,768
"When the koels sing in spring,
it's time again for memories"

15
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:12,377
"It's time again for swinging
under the boughs"

16
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:17,719
"Come home o'wanderer,
your heart beckons"

17
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,995
"The mute soil doesn't
read your letters"

18
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:47,332
"Come, kiss your soil, bring back
the earth to life"

19
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:54,376
"Yes, you have your dreams;
but we are yours too, your kin"

20
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,846
"You are so forgetful,
but we miss you so..."

21
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:04,990
"Come home o'wanderer,
your land beckons"

22
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,386
Glory to The Goddess

23
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,987
Yes Lajjo, I'm here safe and sound.
- Good

24
00:04:56,679 --> 00:05:01,878
Why is my little one giggling away?
- Mom! Every day for 20 years...

25
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,417
Dad has been walking down
the very same street...

26
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:07,746
to his very same destination.
Yet every day, you call him up...

27
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,125
just to ask him, "Have you reached?"
- You won't understand

28
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:17,859
Just assume it's a habit.
- Habit left unchanged...

29
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:22,869
tends to become necessity-like.
- Philosophy, again? You're twelve

30
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,736
Talk like a 12-year old!
Why all this big talk?

31
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:30,606
There's no childhood, no adulthood.

32
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:35,748
One is as grown-up as one feels

33
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:41,285
All right! I lose! Now go to school,
chew yourteacher's brains, okay?

34
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:46,022
Why d'you forget
the almonds everyday?

35
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:48,630
What to do?
Just assume it's habit

36
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:50,999
Will you get out?

37
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,880
"This is the first time
it's happening in 18 years"

38
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:16,886
"Some stranger I have never seen,
comes to my mind"

39
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:19,017
That's my diary!
- So what...?

40
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,164
Only I can read it.
- That was so funny

41
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,631
Let me read some more.
- No way! This is a private diary.

42
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:29,297
Why hide anything from me?
When a girl is grown up...

43
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:32,641
her mother becomes her friend.
Show that to me

44
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:35,640
You won't tell anyone, will you?
- Never

45
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:41,206
All right. I'll read. You listen.
- Very well

46
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:54,954
"This is the first time
it's happening in 18 years"

47
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:59,695
"Some stranger I have never seen,
comes to my mind..."

48
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:05,701
"shadow-like before my eyes"

49
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,169
"Someone raps on my heart"

50
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:15,314
"Deep eyes want me to give myself up"

51
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:20,649
"When I look at my hands,
there I see a face etched"

52
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,958
"A silken breath brushes my cheeks"

53
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:29,689
"My hair still smells
of the odour on his hands"

54
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,165
"Yes, it's happening for
the first time in 18 years"

55
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:39,231
"I've never seen this stranger
who comes to my mind"

56
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,846
Simi, you've begun
writing quite well...

57
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:51,119
and the boy seems lively.
Who's he?

58
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:55,249
Ma, I've yet to set my eyes on him

59
00:07:55,925 --> 00:08:01,864
So there's no one? I was wondering.
One doesn't find such boys nowadays

60
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:06,431
And you dream of someone
you haven't even seen! Quite mad

61
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,704
No Ma. This is no dream

62
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:18,110
I may not have met him, seen him.

63
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:23,712
But he's there. Out there, somewhere

64
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:56,776
"The one who comes in my dreams..."

65
00:08:57,387 --> 00:09:00,788
"the one who teases me..."

66
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:13,799
"just ask him to face me, once"

67
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:05,316
"What's he like? Who is he?
Who knows where is the one..."

68
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:17,997
"my lips will say yes to?"

69
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:21,133
"Is he someone I know?
Is he a stranger?"

70
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:25,870
"Is he for real,
or just a legend?"

71
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,744
"He stares at me,
from far, far away"

72
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,016
"Tell him not to rob me
of my sleep"

73
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:38,882
"The one who comes in my dreams..."

74
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,886
"the one who teases me..."

75
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:47,424
"just ask him to face me, once"

76
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,758
"Some kind of spell is overcoming me"

77
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,938
"Oh what do I do?
My heart yearns so"

78
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:42,941
"My heart tells me it's mad for you.
Then why do you keep hiding from me?"

79
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,755
"He makes me blossom,
it's all his fault"

80
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,954
"Tell him, I'm asking for the Moon"

81
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:55,956
"The one who comes in my dreams..."

82
00:11:56,766 --> 00:12:00,099
"the one who teases me..."

83
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:12,811
"just ask him to face me, once"

84
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,235
Raj! This partying all night!
Party all night and you don't sleep

85
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:46,245
And how do you get up in the morning?
Late for graduation! Hurry!

86
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:55,023
Is it a holiday...?

87
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:04,296
What Raj...?
Late for your graduation?

88
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,768
What to do? Last night...

89
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:11,103
What's wrong with him?
Has he had one too many beers?

90
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,698
I hear someone has failed.
The Dean has decided...

91
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:16,812
to announce his name in public

92
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:51,643
You've made Dharamveer Malhotra stand
an inch and a half taller in his shoes!

93
00:13:55,117 --> 00:14:00,054
I don't think you heard it right.
- I knew, someday you'd make me proud!

94
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:06,190
And not only me, the whole dynasty is
proud of you! Look, they smile at you

95
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:10,997
My great grandfather Diwan Brijnath
never went to school

96
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:15,728
His son, my grandfather
Diwan Dwarkanath failed...

97
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:19,602
his fourth standard examinations.
My father, your grandfather...

98
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,633
Diwan Pushkarnath, failed
his eighth standard examinations

99
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:22,902
And I, your father,
failed to matriculate

100
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:29,175
Not having an education, failing,
are family traditions. I'm happy...

101
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:32,776
that you have kept tradition alive,
and indeed you're two steps ahead

102
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:36,049
We failed back home in India.
You came to London and failed!

103
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,325
Are you really happy?
- Glad

104
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:47,324
Education is all useless.
Filling your head with books...

105
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:48,670
won't fill your pockets

106
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:53,672
Look at me. Runaway peasant-boy from
Bhatinda-turned millionaire in London

107
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:58,713
So, whatever happens is for the good.
Join my offices from tomorrow

108
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,372
Offices? From tomorrow?
- Today, if you wish

109
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:03,844
I can't attend office now.
- Why not?

110
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,720
Pops, you're a man of experience

111
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:11,655
You know what amount of hard work
it takes to fail. And I'm tired, Pops

112
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:15,655
I want a little rest, you know,
like a long European holiday

113
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:20,796
Long European holiday? How long?
- Month or month and a half

114
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:25,064
Will you hold this for me?
And turn around

115
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,813
Moron! Did I bring you up
to see this day?

116
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,990
No, don't drop that

117
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,133
Are you all right, Pops?

118
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:02,269
Pops, you're right. I ought
to take care of your business

119
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:06,742
You've become so old.
- You tell your fatherthat?

120
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,955
Pops, I've decided against Europe.
I'm joining the offices from tomorrow

121
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:20,995
In this house, only your father
decides. You're going to Europe

122
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:24,994
No. I've had enough of a good time.
My years of youth are over for me

123
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:29,603
Never say your youth is over.

124
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:38,871
All my life I've slogged to give
you whatever I couldn't do

125
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:45,753
When youth came and went,
I never got to know

126
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,024
But I wasn't sad, because I knew
that my son will have my years

127
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:56,756
If you think you've had enough
of a good time...

128
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,627
if you think the years of youth
are over for you, well no problem

129
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:07,201
Just go and live my years for me

130
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,767
Ajit's letter?

131
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:43,170
Lajjo! Look, what's here
Letter! From my friend

132
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:46,214
From Ajit

133
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:48,817
Just smell it, lady!

134
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,819
The fragrance of Punjab!

135
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,815
The flavour of mustard curry
on leavened maize bread

136
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:59,358
Those long tailed shirts,
the short knickers

137
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:05,962
"My dear friend Baldev,
We're fine here"

138
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:10,161
"We hope to God that you, your wife
and the children are well too"

139
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,038
"You will be pleased to hearthat
my son has graduated in arts"

140
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:19,040
"He has joined my business.
By God's grace, it's time now...

141
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,043
for us to let our childhood
friendship mature into a relationship

142
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:27,915
Let's make good the promise we made
to each other 20 years ago. I hope...

143
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,958
you will come here at the soonest
for Simran's wedding to Kuljit

144
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:34,823
Read on

145
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:42,092
She's shy! See Lajjo?

146
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:45,703
That's our etiquette, our culture

147
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:51,705
My daughter is still so shamefaced.
I'm not a failure

148
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:56,375
In the heart of London,
I've kept India alive!

149
00:18:57,653 --> 00:19:02,113
Still staring? Lajjo, your daughter's
wedding! Celebrate it with sweets

150
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,717
Chutki! I'm so happy today

151
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:08,158
Can I say one thing?
- Say fourthings

152
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:13,000
lt'd be betterto ask Simran once.
- What are you saying?

153
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,201
Ever since she was a baby, she has
known that she is engaged to Kuljit

154
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:21,165
That she knows. But 20 years...
- Don't you worry!

155
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:24,775
Simran is going to be so happy...

156
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,905
you'll pray that she never
gets the evil eye!

157
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:33,319
I'll write to Ajit right away.
God! At last, comes the day

158
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:50,705
Simran, what are you doing?

159
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:57,378
I had forgotten, Ma. I haven't
even the right to dream

160
00:19:58,314 --> 00:20:02,250
No my child, of course
you may dream

161
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,253
But don't expect them
to come true

162
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,783
And who know, Kuljit might be
the man of your dreams

163
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:15,926
I don't care.
I've bought yourtickets.

164
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,065
You're coming to Europe with me
- I can't

165
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:22,801
Babuji won't let me go to college
alone. Will he let me go away...

166
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,906
touring Europe for a month?

167
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:30,974
I have lots of work here.
- You've known me for years

168
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,114
Can't you make up an excuse?

169
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:37,374
An excuse, I can find. But I don't
feel like lying to Babuji

170
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,380
You must come. Dolly and Payal
are coming too

171
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:48,122
Let me talk to Ma tonight

172
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:51,995
Europe?
- Yes

173
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:54,732
With friends?
- Yes

174
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,238
For a month?
- Yes

175
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,403
Chutki, call the doctor. Tell him
that our Simran has gone stark mad

176
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,211
Will you at least take a look?
- Check out your brains first

177
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:15,690
You talk of travelling by Eurail?
If he hears, he'll bring the roof down

178
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:21,254
A lone girl mustn't travel like this.
- Mom, I'm not going to be alone

179
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:25,995
My friends are going to be with me.
- No good arguing with me

180
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:29,398
I'm not going to object. But you
will need his permission

181
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:31,872
Ask him when he's home

182
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:37,878
God, please keep Babuji
in a nice mood

183
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:03,666
It's just beer. It's over there.
- I told you. The store is shut

184
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,941
Get out

185
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:13,881
Got the beer?
- Didn't find any

186
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,610
Can't even do such a simple job?
- That was an angry man

187
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:20,148
I'll get it.
- You won't

188
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:31,291
Can I have an Aspirin?
- The store is shut

189
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,329
My head is about to crack up!
It's sinusitis

190
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:37,036
If I can't find an Aspirin,
I'll faint.

191
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:39,207
All the other stores are shut

192
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:45,075
Please let me have one Aspirin. One
Hindustani ought to help another

193
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:01,089
Glory to The Goddess.
- Here you are

194
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:10,298
I'm feeling bad about forcing you to
open your store for a small medicine

195
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:14,642
I'd like to buy some otherthings
from you

196
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:22,946
I'll pick up some beer.
Not for myself.

197
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,677
My friends out there, they drink

198
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:29,223
Put it down.
- Why sir?

199
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:33,690
Are you trying to con me? You aren't
getting anything. Put it down

200
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:36,364
You're getting worked up
over nothing. This is for your profit

201
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:40,701
Will you put it down?
- Not that umbrella

202
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:46,974
Here you are. A pound extra?
No two. Keep it, okay?

203
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,244
Shameless!

204
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:55,111
You call yourself a Hindustani?
You give India a bad name

205
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:58,849
You're a liar and insolent!
Get out of here

206
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:04,154
I'm off. I'll keep this

207
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:17,104
Rev up!

208
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,029
Babuji

209
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:03,915
What is the matter? You're late.
- Bloody shameless scoundrel

210
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:11,256
They call themselves Hindustani! Blot
on India! Ought to drown themselves

211
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:16,989
Rascals! No shame, no decency.
How to respect their elders...

212
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:19,861
they don't even know.
- Have you had a fight?

213
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:27,167
Scum! He came for beer. I told him
the store is shut. He took it perforce

214
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:31,043
He even broke the statue of
The Goddess! Bloody half-caste!

215
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:35,311
I say Lajjo, thank God that
you and your daughters...

216
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:37,175
haven't been marred
by this Britishness!

217
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,652
Else, you would've been nowhere!

218
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:43,691
Damn these scoundrels!

219
00:25:46,395 --> 00:25:52,197
Set sail in stormy waters, and
you're in danger of sinking

220
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:49,249
You were so little when we brought
you here. And now...

221
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,388
They said that a grown-up daughter
is a burden on a man

222
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:01,269
But a daughter like you, makes
a father's chest swell with pride!

223
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:05,873
You're my good girl

224
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,213
Will you give something if I ask you?
- Whatever you wish

225
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:20,213
I want to take a look at Europe

226
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:30,862
Eurail is offering a month's tour.
All my friends are going

227
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:41,870
Please don't be cross. I have
never disobeyed you, Babuji

228
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:47,612
I'll be going away to a land
I have never seen

229
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:53,278
The man I'm going to marry
is a complete stranger. But...

230
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:58,150
I have no complaints. You must've
considered it in my best interests

231
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,758
But I won't get a chance
like this ever again.

232
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,935
I don't even know whether
I'll ever come back...

233
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,870
whether I will have
these friends later on

234
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:18,741
Besides, it's only for a month. In
a month, I will have lived a lifetime

235
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:27,280
For the sake of my happiness, won't
you let me have a month of my life?

236
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:34,627
Please Babuji, give me one month

237
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:50,039
Go. Live it up

238
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,348
My baby

239
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:00,821
Where's Simran?

240
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:04,355
Where might she be?
- Has she slipped in the loo?

241
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:08,689
I told you to wake up Raj
Did you?

242
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:11,231
No

243
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:08,055
Open sesame

244
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,422
Do you have the keys to this?

245
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,034
Anybody home?

246
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:27,040
No one at home

247
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:25,798
Haven't I seen you somewhere?

248
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:29,937
At Robbie's party, no?

249
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:34,808
I don't go to parties.
- Great! Nor do I, ever

250
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,249
Your eyes...

251
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,262
What's wrong with my eyes?

252
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:58,859
Reminds me of someone.
- Of whom?

253
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:06,731
My grandmother. Like you, her eyes
too had hues of yellows and blues

254
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,127
Keep reading. I only wanted to find
out how you read upside-down

255
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,128
This is the limit!

256
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,395
Simran, you're here?

257
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:39,734
I heard you've missed the train.
- No, I took it

258
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:43,872
I was afraid...
- By the way, what's your name?

259
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:45,138
Sheena

260
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,410
Here I am. Shall we...?
- Take it easy

261
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,197
Pump it up
- It's pumped. Look

262
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,336
It's nothing.
- Raj, where have you been?

263
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:11,598
As usual. Caught up with a girl

264
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:15,139
Girl...?
- I help her onto the train

265
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:17,277
And she falls for me.
- What...?

266
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:20,406
He bored me. He had me all alone,
and he began flirting

267
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:24,879
Same old hat...
haven't I seen you before?

268
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:27,621
She sidled up to me.
- What?

269
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:31,157
I was scared! Only so much space,
and there she was with me

270
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:34,294
Then?
- Then what? She was lost in my eyes

271
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:41,168
He was after my eyes. Wouldn't
shut up. Boys these days...

272
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:44,805
These girls! I just managed
to come out unscathed

273
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,800
What's that?
- Invitation to a party

274
00:34:15,103 --> 00:34:21,633
I told you. It'll be a bore.
- You prophesied a train crash

275
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,812
And then we'd all be charred alive
after supper in a dinner-hall fire

276
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:27,680
Look, boys.
- Where...?

277
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:32,819
He's the one

278
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:37,214
Where have we landed?
Was this your idea?

279
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:46,093
Us? or the waiters?
- For me.

280
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,102
Rocky shut yourtrap

281
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,973
Why did you have to call him?

282
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,788
You know Sheena, haven't
I seen you before?

283
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:14,953
Me? Really? Where?
- At Robbie's party?

284
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:19,696
You might've.
I go to so many parties

285
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:24,905
You know Sheena...
- What?

286
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:30,835
Your eyes remind me of someone.
- My eyes? Really? Whom?

287
00:35:31,913 --> 00:35:33,847
My grandmother

288
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:45,248
Is she singing or crying?
And I can play better piano

289
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,628
You know how to play the piano?

290
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:54,291
I was born on a piano. Been playing
the piano ever since I was a baby

291
00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:00,907
You know, I've magic in my fingers.
No soonerthan I touch the piano...

292
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:03,310
it starts playing

293
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,247
Isn't that voice familiar?

294
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:47,787
Was this necessary?

295
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:54,326
Doesn't the magic in your fingers
make pianos start playing?

296
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:49,098
"Stop, my wild lover"

297
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:52,833
"I've got to ask you something"

298
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,877
"What are you, girl or magic?"

299
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,740
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"

300
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:25,705
"Come, let me touch you"

301
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,102
"Wait, my wild love"

302
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:33,377
"I've got to ask you something"

303
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:13,251
"Look at me, smiling, unknowing"

304
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:16,848
"I'm waiting for you,
holding my heart"

305
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:21,989
"She looks subdued"

306
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,899
"But she has lots to say"

307
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:31,168
"If you say yes,
I have something to say"

308
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:34,771
"Wait, my wild love"

309
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:38,777
"I've got to ask you something"

310
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:44,050
"What are you, girl or magic?"

311
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,188
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"

312
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:18,645
"You aren't the only
pretty woman around"

313
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:22,188
"Why are you the only one
who's cross?"

314
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:31,327
"The one I've fallen for,
is someone else"

315
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,797
"If she says yes,
I'll take her in my arms"

316
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:39,136
"Wait, my wild love"

317
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,202
"I've got to ask you something"

318
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,716
"What are you, girl or magic?"

319
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:53,710
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"

320
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:59,256
"Come, let me touch you"

321
00:43:52,346 --> 00:43:54,746
About last night, I'm ashamed

322
00:43:57,084 --> 00:44:00,884
I misbehaved with you

323
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,140
I wanted to tell you something else

324
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:32,151
What...?
- This

325
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:35,154
Run

326
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,212
First come, first served

327
00:45:03,017 --> 00:45:05,815
Hurry! The train is about to leave.
- Where did I keep my money?

328
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,893
One minute, I don't know how to count
this currency... lots of small change

329
00:45:15,362 --> 00:45:18,889
Can you tell me one,
two's, eighths...?

330
00:45:24,238 --> 00:45:26,172
Stop

331
00:45:32,713 --> 00:45:34,943
Train's gone?

332
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:42,955
The train is gone!

333
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,094
Don't cry, Senorita

334
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,234
But you just stopped crying

335
00:45:57,037 --> 00:46:00,837
It's raining! Don't cry, please!
I'm with you, I'm here! Look

336
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:07,370
Okay, I'm gone... gone!
Here's your bell

337
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:30,102
The next train is very late.
To catch up with the train...

338
00:46:30,237 --> 00:46:34,970
at Zurich tomorrow morning, we can
eithertake a bus or hire a car

339
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:38,107
What would be your pleasure?
Bus or car? Where's she?

340
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,845
Ever since you met me,
you've been harassing me

341
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,247
What are you saying?
- All along the trip...

342
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:49,116
you've been chewing my brains.
- I...?

343
00:46:49,323 --> 00:46:52,986
Something's always the problem
with you. Today, I've missed...

344
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,855
the train, thanks to you.
- To me...?

345
00:46:55,029 --> 00:47:00,160
I wish to make it to Zurich on time.
So you go your way, I'll go mine

346
00:47:01,368 --> 00:47:05,896
Strange! We're fellow-travellers,
on the same destination, same train

347
00:47:06,106 --> 00:47:11,567
Why split up? Besides, a man like me
ought to stay with a girl like you

348
00:47:11,712 --> 00:47:18,982
Wrong! A girl like me doesn't need
a guy like you. Stop pursuing me

349
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:35,999
I'll sew it up. I have a thread and
needle. I'll buy you a new dress

350
00:48:53,414 --> 00:48:55,382
What have you got yourself into?

351
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,730
I told you not to pursue me!
Who do you think you are?

352
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:26,403
What do you think of yourself?
I wasn't pursuing you

353
00:49:26,747 --> 00:49:30,012
And I don't fancy touching you. Thank
your stars I came in the nick of time

354
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,414
Else, you would've been in jail.
I help her, and she says this

355
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:35,721
Hey, take her away

356
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,338
What did you say?

357
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,674
I got carried away

358
00:50:31,879 --> 00:50:36,213
Never mind Senorita, never mind. In
big places, such small things happen

359
00:50:37,885 --> 00:50:43,687
What's about this Senorita?
- My first girl friend was from Spain

360
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:51,230
Why did you dump her?
- She hated Indians

361
00:50:54,902 --> 00:50:59,362
You like Indians, don't you?
- When do we reach Zurich?

362
00:51:00,174 --> 00:51:03,234
What's in Zurich?
This is the real Europe

363
00:51:04,912 --> 00:51:10,179
So beautiful, so pretty. Sometimes,
I fear, it might become dirty

364
00:51:12,286 --> 00:51:14,686
Here for the first time?
- Yes

365
00:51:15,756 --> 00:51:17,951
Will you drive faster?
- What's the hurry Senorita?

366
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:22,820
Train leaves Zurich at 11:30 tomorrow.
We have a whole night and half a day

367
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:25,231
We'll be there on time.
- Still, if we could...

368
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,965
What had to happen, has happened.
Now you're with me

369
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:32,238
Nothing can go wrong

370
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,289
Europe is best done on foot

371
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:02,897
Just the four of us.
Chutki is way ahead of her years

372
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:09,707
And Ma's more a friend than a mother.
So I never felt the need for a friend

373
00:52:12,779 --> 00:52:17,716
You can't live the rest of your life
with friends. Sometime or the other...

374
00:52:17,918 --> 00:52:22,252
you will need someone who will
walk by you all your life

375
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:28,852
Can't walk anymore. I'm tired.
- Do I pick you up in my arms?

376
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:36,031
I can't afford a hotel. Let's try
that house. We might find lodgings

377
00:52:45,846 --> 00:52:48,314
Come. Arrangements for the night
is done

378
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,023
Which is your room?

379
00:53:00,961 --> 00:53:04,294
Situation is somewhat like this.
There's only one room

380
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:10,596
And we spend the night in the same
room? You presume somewhat like that?

381
00:53:11,204 --> 00:53:14,139
How compelling!
- Not quite so compelling

382
00:53:14,808 --> 00:53:19,006
I'm not staying here one minute.
- You take the bed. I'll take the sofa

383
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:21,271
No problems.
- No way. I'm leaving

384
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:28,285
I'm not joking. I'm going away.
- And I'll have the bed all to myself?

385
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,031
So nice... so romantic!

386
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,037
And these curtains... so nice!

387
00:54:25,112 --> 00:54:27,080
And the view!

388
00:54:29,116 --> 00:54:30,811
No horses?

389
00:54:31,284 --> 00:54:33,809
It's so warm in here

390
00:54:34,888 --> 00:54:37,356
There! You have a fire going

391
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,358
Granted. You have a great sense
of choice

392
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:51,096
You couldn't find a better place
to spend the night, right?

393
00:54:55,909 --> 00:54:57,843
We were getting a nice room

394
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:02,379
But you'd rather spend the night
with me in the stables. Not in the room

395
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,777
Eat
- I'm not hungry

396
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:16,662
All right. Don't eat.
How am I bothered?

397
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:55,167
Eat it

398
00:55:56,837 --> 00:55:58,771
I told you. I'm not hungry.

399
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,174
Come on now. Eat

400
00:56:07,247 --> 00:56:09,181
What did you say?

401
00:56:14,187 --> 00:56:16,121
I got carried away

402
00:56:21,194 --> 00:56:24,129
Never mind. In big places,
such small things happen

403
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,267
You were right, Senorita.
The spirit of adventure in this barn...

404
00:56:31,071 --> 00:56:35,167
you could never enjoy in that room.
- But how do we get to Zurich?

405
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:40,644
No, not Zurich. Tomorrow evening, we
entrain at Berne. Tomorrow morning...

406
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,647
we take the first bus at eight.
I've found out everything

407
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:49,916
Now, nothing can go wrong

408
00:57:17,817 --> 00:57:19,808
What's that?
- Life

409
00:57:24,391 --> 00:57:26,325
Aren't you ashamed to drink
in the presence of a lady?

410
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:30,661
Betterthan dying before the lady!
If you wish to live on...

411
00:57:30,997 --> 00:57:34,194
you too should have a bit, Senorita.
- Don't you dare come near me

412
00:57:35,135 --> 00:57:37,069
All right, don't

413
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:53,946
I'll see you tomorrow morning if
you're still alive.

414
00:57:54,754 --> 00:57:56,722
Until then, goodnight

415
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:56,014
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"

416
00:58:56,816 --> 00:58:59,751
"May I try a pirouette?
- Oh no!"

417
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:03,621
"How about a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

418
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:08,291
"Let me fly with the wind"

419
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:15,631
"God! Help me"

420
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,962
"The chill in the breeze
sets my body afire"

421
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:23,963
"I feel like..."

422
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:27,364
"making love to you"

423
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:31,706
"This never happened before"

424
01:00:31,911 --> 01:00:35,244
"I've taken my first step"

425
01:00:35,915 --> 01:00:40,113
"Let me fly with the wind"

426
01:00:42,922 --> 01:00:47,416
"God! Help me"

427
01:00:50,697 --> 01:00:53,894
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"

428
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:57,427
"May I try a pirouette?"
- Oh no!"

429
01:00:57,971 --> 01:01:01,168
"Give me a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

430
01:01:27,734 --> 01:01:33,639
"Where do you think you're going,
my darling, my love...?"

431
01:01:34,974 --> 01:01:40,776
"You're a pretty girl.
I'm a handsome young man"

432
01:01:42,248 --> 01:01:45,183
"Come into my embrace"

433
01:01:45,919 --> 01:01:48,911
"Let me hold you in my eyes"

434
01:01:49,322 --> 01:01:53,782
"Oh, I'm drunk"

435
01:01:56,329 --> 01:02:01,198
"God! Help me"

436
01:02:04,237 --> 01:02:07,365
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"

437
01:02:08,007 --> 01:02:11,033
"May I try a pirouette?"
- Oh no!"

438
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,305
"Give me a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

439
01:02:14,781 --> 01:02:19,184
"Oh, I'm ecstatic"

440
01:02:22,255 --> 01:02:26,919
"God! Help me"

441
01:03:26,286 --> 01:03:28,345
Up in the mornings,
you look even prettier

442
01:03:38,932 --> 01:03:40,866
How did I get here?

443
01:03:42,669 --> 01:03:45,263
With me. Last night

444
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:49,140
I don't think you've ever
had a drink before

445
01:03:51,678 --> 01:03:53,407
And you had one too many

446
01:03:54,814 --> 01:03:56,145
Have this

447
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,018
What happened last night?

448
01:04:02,822 --> 01:04:09,057
What happened last night,
was bound to happen

449
01:04:12,632 --> 01:04:15,726
But I didn't imagine
it'd happen this way

450
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:20,005
Tell me the truth, Raj!
What happened last night?

451
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:23,008
How do I answer
this question, Simran?

452
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:31,144
Look, look into my eyes.
Aren't my eyes telling the truth?

453
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,888
No! This could never have happened

454
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,758
This could never have happened.
- That's exactly what happened, Simran

455
01:04:45,698 --> 01:04:47,632
Who can stop what is to happen?

456
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,766
You're lying!
You're lying, aren't you?

457
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,337
No Simran.
- Please tell me you're lying

458
01:04:55,908 --> 01:05:00,811
Granted! I'm lying,
my eyes are lying.

459
01:05:02,415 --> 01:05:04,349
But are these love-bites lying?

460
01:05:06,753 --> 01:05:07,685
Speak

461
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:12,022
Tell me Simran! Are these yours?
Or someone else's?

462
01:05:12,892 --> 01:05:15,622
Don't cry! I was just joking

463
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:19,286
Those aren't real! Look!
I used your lipstick

464
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:25,298
You only had one too many,
and you were dripping wet

465
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,766
I had no options. I had to bring
you here. I swear, I'm just joking

466
01:05:29,242 --> 01:05:32,769
You were all alone on the bed. I slept
out there. I'm just joking! I swear

467
01:05:32,945 --> 01:05:34,810
Don't cry, don't

468
01:05:41,888 --> 01:05:49,090
I know what you think of me.
You think I'm a wastrel

469
01:05:51,764 --> 01:05:57,100
I'm not scum, Simran.
I'm Hindustani

470
01:05:58,771 --> 01:06:01,831
And I know what honour means
for the Hindustani woman

471
01:06:03,776 --> 01:06:09,237
Not even in my dreams can I imagine
doing that to you. Trust me, Simran

472
01:06:09,982 --> 01:06:17,047
I'm saying the truth. Last night,
nothing happened. Just a joke

473
01:06:28,167 --> 01:06:31,967
Please, never joke about that.
You don't know what I would've done

474
01:06:32,772 --> 01:06:34,706
Please, no jokes like that

475
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:39,972
I promise neverto crack
a joke like that

476
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,901
Get changed. Fast.
We got to catch the bus

477
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,972
May I have my shirt back?

478
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:31,596
Fifteen minutes before the bus
leaves. You want to eat something?

479
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,734
No, I'm not hungry

480
01:07:42,675 --> 01:07:45,769
Come on, let's take a look inside.
- Churches aren't worth a look

481
01:07:45,912 --> 01:07:47,846
I'm not going

482
01:07:52,852 --> 01:07:54,786
Go on. Take a look

483
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:36,658
What?
- Hurry up. We'll miss the bus

484
01:09:12,665 --> 01:09:16,396
Shall we?
- Why not leave aftertea?

485
01:09:21,807 --> 01:09:26,005
What did you ask for?
- You aren't supposed to speak of it

486
01:09:27,346 --> 01:09:29,746
Then you must be sure about
being given what you've asked for

487
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:35,144
Whatever one seeks with a pure heart,
one is surely given

488
01:09:38,824 --> 01:09:40,758
Go on. I'll be back in a minute.
- What happened?

489
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,928
Go on. I'll join you

490
01:09:56,142 --> 01:09:58,076
I'm Raj

491
01:09:58,878 --> 01:10:04,077
I'm sorry, I don't know how to pray.
But I want nothing for myself

492
01:10:06,152 --> 01:10:12,148
But that girl Simran, she's nice.
Very good at heart

493
01:10:13,225 --> 01:10:15,750
Give her whatever she asked for

494
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:32,944
Where have you been?

495
01:10:35,414 --> 01:10:37,348
In the church?

496
01:10:48,427 --> 01:10:52,227
Half a teaspoon of sugar, one spoon
of milk, bit of cream. Your coffee

497
01:10:54,433 --> 01:10:57,231
You want a postcard to send home?
- Postcard? For home?

498
01:10:57,903 --> 01:11:01,236
If that postcard reaches home,
my Pop will give me up for dead

499
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:04,876
When were you last serious?
- Till now, never

500
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:08,010
If ever, it'll happen only once.
- When?

501
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:11,817
When I'm in love

502
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:16,218
A boy like you was never in love?
- I've had many affairs

503
01:11:16,756 --> 01:11:20,692
But I was never in love, Senorita.
Never found one

504
01:11:21,293 --> 01:11:23,227
What kind of girl are
you looking for?

505
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:26,364
Want me to tell you?

506
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,095
The moment I look at her...

507
01:11:30,236 --> 01:11:34,832
all my heart's desires, all my
dreams will come alive

508
01:11:36,776 --> 01:11:42,237
Has never happened. But now I hear
a voice, behind the clouds, calling

509
01:11:44,183 --> 01:11:51,851
She's a stranger, a face I've never
seen before. When will the clouds part?

510
01:11:56,962 --> 01:12:00,295
Has it never happened with you?
- No

511
01:12:01,367 --> 01:12:04,894
No stranger ever invaded your dreams?

512
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,036
No place for strangers in my dreams

513
01:12:12,645 --> 01:12:14,112
I am engaged to marry

514
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:22,714
Engaged to marry?
- Yes

515
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:27,987
Where's the fiance? In London?
- No, in India

516
01:12:28,194 --> 01:12:29,855
Looks...?

517
01:12:31,197 --> 01:12:33,859
Don't know. Never seen him

518
01:12:36,368 --> 01:12:40,304
You've never seen the man
you're going to marry?

519
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:45,904
Not necessary. My father has
seen him. His friend's son

520
01:12:47,847 --> 01:12:55,049
You'll spend your life with someone
you've never met?

521
01:12:56,989 --> 01:12:58,923
A complete stranger?

522
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:07,327
That's how it happens with us.
- And you're happy with this decision?

523
01:13:19,712 --> 01:13:21,646
The train is here

524
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:12,321
Lovely photographs. Send me a set of
copies. And your wedding photos too

525
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:16,198
Won't you be there at my wedding?
- Who's going to travel so far?

526
01:14:16,735 --> 01:14:20,933
Sheena, you must!
- Just joking. Of course, I'll come

527
01:14:21,273 --> 01:14:26,074
I got to take a look at your groom.
Who knows what idiot she's marrying?

528
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:33,852
You dropped this

529
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,217
What happened? Why are you
staring like that?

530
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,822
I have something to tell you Simran

531
01:15:19,164 --> 01:15:20,131
Go on

532
01:15:22,635 --> 01:15:24,603
I'm in love with you

533
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:46,624
Just look at your face

534
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,895
You thought I was saying the truth?

535
01:15:52,831 --> 01:15:56,028
Strange Simran!
You've known me for so long...

536
01:15:56,201 --> 01:16:01,935
and you still can't make me out?
Remember? I've never been serious

537
01:16:05,878 --> 01:16:10,747
All this love etc. is beyond me.
Still haven't been able to make out...

538
01:16:11,216 --> 01:16:16,882
how some men spend a lifetime with one
girl! It's a world full of pretty women

539
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:22,021
Someone has beautiful eyes, someone has
good lips, someone has nice hair...

540
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:28,300
You boys are all the same.
- But you're one up on all of us

541
01:16:30,102 --> 01:16:37,031
You're about to spend a lifetime
with someone you haven't even seen

542
01:16:39,244 --> 01:16:42,304
That must be true love

543
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:54,350
Forget it. Think for a moment,
what if you're in love with someone?

544
01:16:54,893 --> 01:16:58,693
I mean, imagine you're in love with
someone you've met on this trip...

545
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:03,832
why someone? Say you're in love
with me, and I'm in love with you too

546
01:17:07,773 --> 01:17:14,042
Then what will you do? Will you
go back to marry that stranger?

547
01:17:16,115 --> 01:17:19,312
Or, will you have the courage
to have an affair with me?

548
01:17:23,255 --> 01:17:25,223
What will you do?

549
01:17:34,299 --> 01:17:39,100
I don't want to miss the train again.
- I want to miss it again and again

550
01:17:40,305 --> 01:17:42,967
What...?
- Nothing

551
01:17:48,647 --> 01:17:52,378
If she's in love with me,
she's going to turn around

552
01:17:57,189 --> 01:17:58,121
Turn

553
01:18:05,197 --> 01:18:06,164
Turn

554
01:18:55,848 --> 01:18:59,909
Back in London. How a month
passed by, I didn't even notice

555
01:19:26,411 --> 01:19:31,940
Raj, you haven't given me your address.
I'll send you my wedding invitation

556
01:19:32,317 --> 01:19:34,251
You'll come, won't you?

557
01:19:36,455 --> 01:19:38,389
No, I won't come

558
01:20:06,818 --> 01:20:12,256
"What's come over..."

559
01:20:14,459 --> 01:20:16,393
"my heart?"

560
01:20:18,797 --> 01:20:26,260
"Have I lost it?"

561
01:20:28,674 --> 01:20:34,010
"What's come over my heart?"

562
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:41,280
"Where have I lost it?"

563
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:02,070
"You're in love, my love"

564
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,802
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

565
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,880
"You're in love, my love"

566
01:21:12,818 --> 01:21:16,618
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

567
01:21:17,222 --> 01:21:21,158
"Darling, this is love"

568
01:21:32,037 --> 01:21:35,803
"You're in love, my love"

569
01:21:36,842 --> 01:21:40,676
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

570
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:45,344
"Darling, this is love"

571
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:14,770
"You didn't care to turn around..."

572
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:18,349
"but I was still waiting"

573
01:22:20,152 --> 01:22:24,350
"By the time I wanted
to stop you..."

574
01:22:25,157 --> 01:22:28,092
"you were too far away"

575
01:22:29,294 --> 01:22:32,957
"What happened?
- I don't even know"

576
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:37,693
"Why is my heart...
- In love...?"

577
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:42,973
"You're in love, my love"

578
01:22:43,909 --> 01:22:47,845
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

579
01:22:48,447 --> 01:22:52,383
"You're in love, my love"

580
01:22:53,785 --> 01:22:57,414
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

581
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:02,152
"Darling, this is love"

582
01:23:36,795 --> 01:23:40,856
"Oh time! Stop, tarry..."

583
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:44,635
"go backwards"

584
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:50,298
"I've left myself behind..."

585
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:54,040
"at the crossroads of life"

586
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,909
"Where am I...?
- Where are you?"

587
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:03,645
"What is this...?
- Magic"

588
01:24:05,056 --> 01:24:09,049
"You're in love, my love"

589
01:24:09,928 --> 01:24:13,591
"Try refusing a million times,
"You're in love, my love"

590
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:23,639
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

591
01:24:24,109 --> 01:24:28,170
"Darling, this is love"

592
01:25:04,316 --> 01:25:09,117
"What's come over..."

593
01:25:11,122 --> 01:25:13,056
"my heart?"

594
01:25:15,393 --> 01:25:19,659
"My heart was with me always"

595
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:23,665
"Have I lost it?"

596
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:27,805
"I've lost it"

597
01:25:46,791 --> 01:25:49,385
Ma, you remember the dream
I wrote about in my diary?

598
01:25:51,196 --> 01:25:54,256
That face I imagined
holding in my hands?

599
01:25:56,067 --> 01:25:58,035
The one, I wanted to face

600
01:25:59,938 --> 01:26:02,031
I've found him

601
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:05,175
What...?

602
01:26:05,977 --> 01:26:10,710
What are you saying, Simi?
- Yes Ma. When I was leaving...

603
01:26:10,849 --> 01:26:13,113
I was clear about what
I was getting out of life

604
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:18,856
For a month, I wanted to be as happy
as I could. Then I'd come back...

605
01:26:19,324 --> 01:26:23,988
and go away to my country to spend
a lifetime with a stranger

606
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:29,993
I had come to a compromise with my
destiny, Ma. But little did I know...

607
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:35,134
this was in store for me.
Like a storm he came...

608
01:26:36,074 --> 01:26:38,907
and he swept me off
like a fallen leaf

609
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:46,314
Love's like this, like that,
I had read, I had heard

610
01:26:47,252 --> 01:26:52,656
But I never understood. When, for the
first time, he offered me his hand...

611
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:56,659
I still didn't understand.
I was with him for so long...

612
01:26:57,996 --> 01:27:04,196
still I didn't understand anything.
But today, when we were parting...

613
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:10,136
for the first time I felt
that afterthis moment...

614
01:27:11,076 --> 01:27:17,311
I'm not going to see him ever again.
I kept looking back. He was going away

615
01:27:18,683 --> 01:27:23,620
I wanted to stop him, I wanted to say
something, I wanted to hear something

616
01:27:25,857 --> 01:27:30,920
But he didn't stop. I understood.
This is what love is like

617
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:39,667
And to him, I've given all my dreams.
I don't even know whether he loves me

618
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:46,808
All I know is that for me, he's life.
I can never be anyone else's, Ma

619
01:28:04,329 --> 01:28:07,127
You're up? Simi and I
have been talking

620
01:28:07,799 --> 01:28:10,666
She's back after so long.
I even lost track of time

621
01:28:27,285 --> 01:28:31,813
I told you, not to betray my trust

622
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:39,830
I took a promise from you.
And you've deceived me?

623
01:28:40,632 --> 01:28:42,827
No Babuji...
- Listen, first ask her

624
01:28:43,034 --> 01:28:45,002
I don't want to listen to anything!

625
01:28:47,338 --> 01:28:51,866
Pack. Tomorrow morning,
we leave for India

626
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:55,603
For good

627
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:03,754
Let her cry

628
01:29:04,222 --> 01:29:06,747
She has writ it on her own destiny

629
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:11,756
She will have to learn for herself
how to get over it. Let her cry

630
01:29:49,434 --> 01:29:51,368
What's her name?
- Simran

631
01:29:54,172 --> 01:29:56,106
What girl, Pops?

632
01:29:57,175 --> 01:29:59,837
The one whose face you see
in the moon.

633
01:30:01,045 --> 01:30:03,240
I'm not one of them...

634
01:30:03,414 --> 01:30:06,110
who will go crazy about a girl.
- Yes, I forgot!

635
01:30:06,451 --> 01:30:09,284
Some have good lips, some have
beautiful eyes...

636
01:30:13,024 --> 01:30:14,958
Lives where?
- Who, Pops?

637
01:30:17,028 --> 01:30:18,962
This... Simran

638
01:30:24,302 --> 01:30:27,965
Don't know
- How is she?

639
01:30:29,774 --> 01:30:31,708
Very lovable

640
01:30:33,311 --> 01:30:35,245
Then what's the problem?

641
01:30:36,314 --> 01:30:41,980
Problem is, she's about to marry.
- How about stopping the wedding?

642
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:47,249
In yourtimes, it was different.
Times have changed

643
01:30:49,494 --> 01:30:54,761
Love is still called "love". That has
never changed, nor will it ever change

644
01:30:57,835 --> 01:31:01,430
She's going to be someone else's.
- The bride goes to the man...

645
01:31:01,773 --> 01:31:08,042
who brings her home. I didn't sire
you to play that fiddle. We aren't...

646
01:31:08,179 --> 01:31:10,079
those who stare at the moon. You
reach out to the moon...

647
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:12,149
you bring her home. Go

648
01:31:13,184 --> 01:31:15,982
And come home only
with your bride. Get it?

649
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:03,063
Gone. The daughter is
getting married.

650
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:05,202
They've sold out and moved to Punjab

651
01:32:34,265 --> 01:32:36,199
I'm coming, Simran

652
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:40,070
I'm coming

653
01:33:42,966 --> 01:33:47,994
"When the girls go to the riverbank,
you'll hear their anklets chime"

654
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:51,004
"When the ripe mustard sways
in the farms..."

655
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:53,267
"you'll know a year
has come to pass"

656
01:33:55,812 --> 01:34:00,749
"Come today, come with a smile,
bring me a song, I've been waiting..."

657
01:34:01,151 --> 01:34:05,747
"for the whistle
of the chugging train"

658
01:34:06,823 --> 01:34:10,953
"Come home o'wanderer,
your mate beckons"

659
01:34:12,028 --> 01:34:13,996
"Come home o'wanderer"

660
01:34:18,034 --> 01:34:21,128
"Your land beckons"

661
01:34:41,825 --> 01:34:43,759
Bless me, Ma-ji

662
01:34:53,236 --> 01:34:55,295
No Ma-ji

663
01:34:58,375 --> 01:35:05,213
Son, 20 years I've held back
these tears

664
01:35:09,753 --> 01:35:14,156
Today, they won't stop, son.
Not today

665
01:35:20,831 --> 01:35:22,765
Simran, my child

666
01:35:23,233 --> 01:35:25,167
My baby doll

667
01:35:29,973 --> 01:35:32,771
How have you been?
- I haven't changed a bit!

668
01:35:33,243 --> 01:35:37,646
You're the bride's aunt now!
Time to find a good groom for yourself

669
01:35:37,848 --> 01:35:40,817
Lajjo, I've been ready all these years!
But in this village...

670
01:35:40,951 --> 01:35:44,910
there isn't one who's a match for me.
So what do I do? For me, I think...

671
01:35:45,088 --> 01:35:48,956
it'll have to be a foreigner!
- You haven't changed a bit

672
01:35:49,092 --> 01:35:50,821
Not a bit!

673
01:35:51,294 --> 01:35:55,822
You did keep us waiting.
Anyway, better late than never

674
01:35:56,032 --> 01:35:59,092
Wife, will you excuse us a moment?
- Get lost

675
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:05,974
Come on. Baldev, who's this?
Go on...

676
01:36:07,043 --> 01:36:10,103
You don't know?
My daughter Preeti

677
01:36:10,447 --> 01:36:13,780
Kuljit's sister.
- May you live long

678
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:19,052
Wonderful, isn't it? In 20 years,
the whole generation has come of age

679
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:21,355
She's beautiful.
- Father's daughter, right?

680
01:36:22,092 --> 01:36:23,650
Get lost

681
01:36:23,994 --> 01:36:25,655
Where's Kuljit?
- Yes, where's Kuljit?

682
01:36:25,996 --> 01:36:28,692
Bhaiyya (Brother) is out for a hunt.
He should be back soon

683
01:36:53,156 --> 01:36:55,090
My respects.
- May you live long, son

684
01:36:55,659 --> 01:36:57,388
My respects.
- May you live long, son

685
01:36:59,663 --> 01:37:03,724
That's a strong lad from Punjab.
- Whose son is he anyway?

686
01:37:03,934 --> 01:37:05,299
Get lost

687
01:37:05,669 --> 01:37:08,638
Come, breakfast is ready.
- Yes hurry. I'm famished

688
01:37:08,805 --> 01:37:10,705
Come on kids

689
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:15,239
For you, for you and for you

690
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:17,713
You must take me out
tomorrow morning.

691
01:37:18,048 --> 01:37:19,709
Sure Didi (Sister)

692
01:37:49,379 --> 01:37:51,779
Kids, Grannie wants
everyone downstairs

693
01:38:12,802 --> 01:38:18,263
You know Simi, when I was a kid,
my father would tell me...

694
01:38:19,676 --> 01:38:26,013
there's no difference between
man and woman. All have equal rights

695
01:38:27,951 --> 01:38:33,048
All my childhood, I lived believing
it's true. But as I grew up...

696
01:38:34,724 --> 01:38:36,783
I realised what a lie that is

697
01:38:39,729 --> 01:38:42,789
I wasn't given an education,
because it was more important...

698
01:38:42,932 --> 01:38:47,062
that my brothers be educated.
That was my first sacrifice

699
01:38:49,139 --> 01:38:53,337
Then, at every step, sometimes
as daughter, sometimes as sister...

700
01:38:54,144 --> 01:38:56,669
sometimes as wife... I went on
sacrificing my own happiness

701
01:38:59,749 --> 01:39:01,683
But once you were born...

702
01:39:02,752 --> 01:39:05,220
when I held you in my hands
for the first time...

703
01:39:06,890 --> 01:39:14,729
I made a promise, never to let happen
to my daughter, what happened to me

704
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,396
No more sacrifices at every step
as daughter, as sister, as wife

705
01:39:23,105 --> 01:39:27,303
So what if she's a girl?
She'd live her life as she wishes

706
01:39:28,376 --> 01:39:33,439
She'd have her share of happiness.
But I was wrong, Simran

707
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:39,048
I had even forgotten that a woman
hasn't even the right to make promises

708
01:39:40,856 --> 01:39:47,056
She is born to be sacrificed for
their men. For their women...

709
01:39:47,229 --> 01:39:51,097
men will never make sacrifices,
nor will they ever make sacrifices

710
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:57,929
Therefore I, your mother, come to
take from you, your own happiness

711
01:40:00,909 --> 01:40:07,838
Forget him, my child. Forget. Because
your father won't care for your tears
