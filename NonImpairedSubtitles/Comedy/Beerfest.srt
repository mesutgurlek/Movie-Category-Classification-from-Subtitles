1
00:00:57,407 --> 00:01:01,002
You've got spunk, Wolfhouse.
I'll give you that.

2
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:03,611
I don't got room in my
pocket for more of your money.

3
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,614
I got a little spunk for you.

4
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:16,451
You couldn't hit your own ball bag
with your own wrinkled cock.

5
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:20,284
Chance.

6
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,900
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
You play rim rules?

7
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,263
Doesn't everybody?

8
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:29,928
Yeah, the shit-stabbers like you.

9
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:31,767
Hold on there, girlfriend.

10
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,438
You're gonna chance...

11
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:39,681
...you're gonna have to earn it.

12
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:43,313
Oh, no. No way.

13
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:47,184
Forget about it.
I'm out of here. Where's my...?

14
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:52,960
Hey. You said you wanted to chance,
now take a chance.

15
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,061
All right, all right.

16
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:02,996
Son of a bitch!

17
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:04,299
Up yours, Johnny Cash.

18
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:06,601
Okay. Grab him, boys.

19
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:10,977
You weren't trying to play me for
a fool, were you, Wolfhouse?

20
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:12,136
Beginner's luck.

21
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:15,751
You don't come into my place of business
and take my money like that.

22
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,320
Now, what I should do is
beat seven shades of shit out of you.

23
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,322
- But I'll teach you something somebody...
- Hey!

24
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,157
What's going on down here?

25
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:26,124
Todd, welcome home!

26
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:29,163
I'm just having some fun with your
younger, dumber brother.

27
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,596
Might not be the best time.
Everyone's waiting.

28
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:32,826
Oh, of course.

29
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:39,764
Padre?

30
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:51,978
I'll come back for the rest.

31
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:12,197
Great Gam Gam. I'm so sorry.

32
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,237
My friends...

33
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:19,905
...as we gather today to mourn
the passing of Johan Wolfhouse...

34
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,685
...what can I say that
Johan can't say for himself?

35
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,086
<i>Hello, all.</i>

36
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,388
<i>If you are watching this,</i>
<i>then I have croaked.</i>

37
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:41,168
<i>Now I will never know what happens on</i>
The Young and the Restless.

38
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:45,205
- He loved that show.
- <i>But seriously, I wanted to thank you all...</i>

39
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:50,108
<i>... for what you have added to</i>
<i>my long and happy life.</i>

40
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,044
<i>Most of all, my mother.</i>

41
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,746
<i>Mother, I always knew</i>
<i>you would outlive me.</i>

42
00:03:57,921 --> 00:03:59,616
<i>I loved you.</i>

43
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,847
<i>Prosit.</i>

44
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:21,136
<i>Todd, Jan,</i>
<i>my smart and talented grandsons...</i>

45
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,906
<i>... take good care of the restaurant.</i>

46
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:27,743
<i>It is the last piece of your heritage.</i>

47
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:33,150
<i>And don't worry,</i>
<i>someone will be watching over you.</i>

48
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:36,914
<i>Popo!</i>

49
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,993
- Hey. It's Popo.
- <i>Popo was given to me...</i>

50
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,830
<i>... by my father on his deathbed.</i>

51
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:46,257
<i>Prosit!</i>

52
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:59,840
<i>And finally, to me.</i>

53
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,907
<i>Looking good down there.</i>

54
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,391
<i>Say good night, Popo.</i>

55
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:22,968
<i>Good night, Popo.</i>

56
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,345
For hundreds of years,
it has been a Wolfhouse tradition...

57
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:36,713
...to spread the ashes of
our loved ones in Munich.

58
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:39,719
I am too old.
I want you boys to go to Germany...

59
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,517
...and carry out this tradition
for your grandfather.

60
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,655
Sure, it would be an honor for us,
Great Gam Gam. When?

61
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:49,286
Well, you must leave immediately.

62
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,366
The tradition is to spread the ashes...

63
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,696
...during the festival
on the Theresienwiese.

64
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:57,396
There you will meet
a Mr. Schniedelwichsen.

65
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,235
He will take you to
the family resting place.

66
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,140
The festival begins this week.

67
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:04,745
The festival of the what-what?

68
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:09,010
Oh, boys, you know this festival
as Oktoberfest.

69
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,709
We're in.

70
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:20,052
We really gotta find this Schniedelwichsen
and spread Grandpa's ashes.

71
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,747
He's supposed to meet us here.

72
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:25,155
So there's nothing we can do
but hang out and wait. Right, Grandpa?

73
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,307
Come on, guys.

74
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:59,424
Are you making fun of us, mate?

75
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:00,751
What? No.

76
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,626
We're singing the beloved
drinking songs of our country...

77
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,790
...and you sing us
that bloody jingo jango?

78
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:09,829
I reckon you're taking
the piss out of Oktoberfest.

79
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:10,995
We're just singing.

80
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:12,471
What do you think, mate?

81
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,633
I think we should fucking brain them.

82
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:17,172
Hey, we love Oktober...

83
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:37,394
Hot cheese soup!

84
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,030
Hot cheese so...!

85
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:53,682
Come on.
This is the <i>Fr‰uleins Gone Wild!</i>

86
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:56,317
Just kiss each other, <i>ja?</i>

87
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:19,736
Helmut, my God, are you okay?

88
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,374
Oh, strewth. They hit the little kid!

89
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:35,122
Let's get the bastards!

90
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:56,306
So this is Oktoberfest.

91
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,639
Wolfhouse?

92
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:00,904
Yeah.

93
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:05,482
I am Mr. Schniedelwichsen.

94
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:07,813
- Hi!
- Let's go.

95
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,050
Gam Gam said you'd meet us here.
There's some crazy...

96
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:14,286
- Gotcha.
- Hey!

97
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,055
- He's got me!
- He's gone crazy dingo.

98
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:20,826
Make fast! Make very fast!

99
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:21,992
Split! Split!

100
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,315
Where are we going,
Mr. Spiedelspackel?

101
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:36,781
Schniedelwichsen. Come.

102
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:39,079
Halt. See, we're here.

103
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,385
Johan?

104
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,687
The ashes.
We left them back at that tent.

105
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:48,830
We gotta go get our grandfather's ashes.

106
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:54,929
Come. Come now.

107
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:21,362
We in the right neighborhood?

108
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:29,869
Oh, hello, blondie.

109
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,506
You care for a dance?

110
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,401
Jan? Jan?

111
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,507
Leave my brother alone.

112
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:40,671
I miss you!

113
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:54,524
The password!

114
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,613
<i>Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!</i>

115
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:04,057
They're playing Quarters!

116
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:06,323
Hey, Beer Pong!

117
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:11,071
Upside-down Chugs!

118
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,375
Come! Come in here.

119
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,150
I'd bugger her
for a game of soldiers, huh?

120
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:30,281
Hello. Pim Scutney.
This here's me mate, Rog Gobshire.

121
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,619
Team England.

122
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:35,025
I am Jan Wolfhouse and
this is my brother, Todd Wolfhouse.

123
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:37,825
And what is this?

124
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,458
Beerfest, innit!

125
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:43,137
Is this part of Oktoberfest?

126
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:46,763
Oktoberfest is for tossers and
sheep-shaggers.

127
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,876
Beerfest is our lives.

128
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:53,276
The ultimate test of
a beer-gamer's mettle!

129
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:54,983
- Where's the American team?
- Yeah.

130
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:58,786
- That's worth a squirt, innit?
- What?

131
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:03,514
Excuse me, guys.

132
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:07,219
Please vomit in proper receptacles!

133
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:10,490
Wait a second.
Look at those urns over there.

134
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,133
They look just like Grandpa's.

135
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:15,530
That's why Schniedelwasher
brought us here.

136
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:18,264
We're supposed to put Grandpa's urn
up there with those.

137
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,998
We gotta go back and get it.

138
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:22,575
You go. I'm never leaving this place.

139
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:27,512
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

140
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:34,015
Hello, guvnor!

141
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:35,986
We got ourselves a tie.

142
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,819
You see them blokes in the knickers?

143
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:40,052
That's the German team, the champs.

144
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:43,562
Their family owns
the oldest brewery in Bavaria.

145
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:46,166
They're regular diamond geezers,
they are, right?

146
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,997
Why does the last guy
chug out of a shoe?

147
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:51,401
That's no shoe!

148
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:54,407
That's Das Boot!

149
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:57,868
And she's a cruel old mistress, she is.

150
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:05,683
Drink up, Hansel!

151
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,517
Wow, they're fast!

152
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:15,352
Das Boot!

153
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:23,262
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

154
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,553
Schniedelspanker!

155
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:00,804
Von Wolfhausen. Wolfhouse.

156
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,401
Your last name's von Wolfhausen?

157
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:07,176
Get the fuck out of here. So is ours!
Wolfhouse.

158
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:12,277
We're cousins?
Oh, this just gets better and better!

159
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,324
We must be related through
our grandfather, Johan von Wolfhausen.

160
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,040
Why are you taking him?
Where's he going?

161
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:34,903
We kind of need to stick close.

162
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:40,881
- He is of no concern to you.
- But he was just walking us through. He...

163
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,581
You do not speak of Beerfest
outside of Beerfest!

164
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:48,046
You do not bring outsiders to Beerfest.

165
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:50,350
But our grandfather
was Johan von Wolf...

166
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,993
Your grandfather
was no von Wolfhausen.

167
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:56,325
Your grandfather was a thieving
bastard stable boy.

168
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:59,660
- What did you say?
- Baron Ludwig von Wolfhausen...

169
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:03,703
...our great-grandfather, the most
legendary <i>brewmeister</i> in all Deutschland.

170
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:06,363
He perfected the von Wolfhausen
beer recipe.

171
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:10,342
It was the greatest beer in all the world.

172
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:14,610
When Ludwig died, your grandfather stole
the only copy of the recipe created.

173
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,479
Hold on a second.
Our grandfather didn't brew beer.

174
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:20,451
He had this little sausage house
in Colorado. He couldn't...

175
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,089
He could <i>und</i> he did.

176
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:26,485
He stole our recipe <i>und</i> fled Germany
with his mother...

177
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:29,426
...a common Bavarian...

178
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:34,061
What's the English word I'm looking for?

179
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:35,225
Whore.

180
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,669
Gam Gam a whore?

181
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,099
Obviously there's
a translation problem here.

182
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:42,243
Hooker. Prostitute. Slut for money.

183
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:45,869
- Now you're crossing the line.
- No, you are crossing the line! He stole it!

184
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:50,382
<i>Und</i> now, instead of having Deutschland's
greatest beer, we merely have fourth-best.

185
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:00,357
<i>Ja,</i> we are not your cousins.

186
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,522
You are the offspring of the bastard son
of some whore!

187
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:09,999
- Don't call Gam Gam a whore! She's not!
- Punch me! Do it!

188
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,538
<i>Ja,</i> you big tough guy.
Kill me, come on.

189
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,541
Do it now! Kill me.
What are you waiting for?

190
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:20,309
Typical Americans. This is why
we don't allow you in our Beerfest.

191
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:23,315
You get a few drinks in you
<i>und</i> you become the Dirty Harry.

192
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:27,080
You should go back to your strip malls
and drink your Zimas and Smirnoff Ices.

193
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,884
<i>Und</i> then you can punch each other silly.

194
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,084
Okay. Okay.

195
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:36,789
Okay. Sounds like you guys
fancy yourselves drinkers, huh?

196
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:39,996
<i>Ja,</i> maybe a little.
I think we just beat the Irish, so...

197
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:43,536
- Oh, that's good. The champions. What?
- Well, I'll tell you what.

198
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,505
Why don't you pick your best two?
Because you just opened up a can of corn.

199
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:49,540
Corn.

200
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,538
We are laughing.
We are laughing at you.

201
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,206
- Our best two? You want our best two?
- The corn.

202
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,752
How about our worst two, right?
Hammacher! Schlemmer!

203
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:24,173
You take the big guy.
I'll get the little one.

204
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,974
You ready, <i>du kleiner Hosenscheiﬂer?</i>

205
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:33,620
Everyone at once.
First team to finish wins. On my word.

206
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,587
- Let's do this.
- <i>Ja,</i> do it.

207
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,962
Hey, boys, why don't you let us
put a nipple on that for you?

208
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,940
I remember my first beer.

209
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:56,770
Prosit.

210
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:46,660
Allow me to introduce our grandfather:

211
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,592
Wolfgang von Wolfhausen.

212
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:51,357
Take a good look...

213
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:54,730
...for this is a real von Wolfhausen.

214
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,666
Grandpapa.

215
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:02,637
Oh, shit.

216
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:07,871
So you are the progeny of Johan.

217
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,746
I am guessing that he is the one
who taught you how to drink beer.

218
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,683
Now...

219
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,788
...where is our recipe?

220
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:22,162
What fucking recipe?

221
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,940
Friends...

222
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,869
...this is all that remains
of a thieving stable boy...

223
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:43,177
...who ran away to America
with his whore mother!

224
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:58,323
I'm a sucker for family reunions.

225
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:02,359
Here are a couple of euros.

226
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:08,238
Go back and get a BJ
from your great-grandma, on me.

227
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:10,741
Now get out of here.

228
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,177
<i>BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ!</i>

229
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:45,312
They called Grandpa a thief
and Gam Gam a whore!

230
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,472
We gotta go back.
We gotta go back and beat those guys.

231
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,381
- Oh, come on, man, that's crazy.
- Is it? We can do this.

232
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:54,215
We can do what?

233
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:55,583
Great Gam Gam.

234
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:58,157
<i>Mein</i> boys. Oh, <i>willkommen.</i>

235
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:03,928
Honey, what happened to your eye?

236
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,692
I accidentally walked into a wall.
Yeah, the Berlin Wall.

237
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:10,099
I'll tell Tippy to get
some cold pig stomach.

238
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:11,671
We put that on Janny's eye.

239
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,643
So tell me,
was the ceremony beautiful?

240
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:22,174
Yeah. Very beautiful. I mean, gorgeous.

241
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,341
Was it a peaceful resting place?

242
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,921
Have you ever been
to the family resting place?

243
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,457
No, but I've been told it is wonderful.

244
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:33,761
- Quiet, lovely.
- Yeah.

245
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:36,159
And how is Herr Schniedelwichsen?

246
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:38,665
- Oh, he's fine. Great guy.
- Yeah. Good.

247
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,301
He says hi.

248
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:46,003
Oh, you boys have done a great thing.

249
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,701
Now your grandpapa can rest in peace.

250
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:56,907
She couldn't be more not a whore.

251
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,450
We're gonna defend her honor.

252
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,212
We're gonna defend Grandpa's honor!

253
00:24:00,388 --> 00:24:02,788
- We're gonna put together our own team!
- Yes.

254
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:06,359
We'll get the biggest drinkers, the best
beer-gamers, the fastest chuggers.

255
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:09,528
Then we're gonna go back
and kick the tar out of those Krauts!

256
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,292
That's my brother!
God, I missed you.

257
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:13,900
Beerfest it is.

258
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:15,558
They want a war?

259
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:17,728
We'll give them a war
they won't believe.

260
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:25,674
So how'd you find him?

261
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:28,372
Some dude, used to work
with him at the brewery.

262
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,541
Haven't seen him since
Hands Across America.

263
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,879
Oh, that's right.

264
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,490
I heard that when the brewery gave
him his pink slip, he killed a guy.

265
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:38,489
I heard that too.

266
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,752
There he is.

267
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:45,561
You got nothing, baby.
I got everything!

268
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:49,495
You got nothing! You got nothing!

269
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,851
We're gonna win this thing.

270
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,182
Can I have your autograph?

271
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:11,450
Oh, no autographs, kids.

272
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:13,719
No, no, no. Thanks anyway.
Get you next time.

273
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:17,228
Hey, guys. Good job out there, Naka.

274
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,293
Hey, Landfill! Hey, big guy!

275
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,802
Hey, look what the cat dragged in!

276
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,601
I haven't seen you guys since...
Hands Across America?

277
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,936
We were just saying that.

278
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,045
We almost made it.
Couple breaks in the chain, right?

279
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,877
What's going on?
You disappeared for a while.

280
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:39,953
We heard you got fired from the brewery.

281
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:45,155
Goddamn brewery!

282
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:48,959
They brew 10,000 bottles of beer a day.

283
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,963
I drink 45 off the assembly line,
and I'm the asshole.

284
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,624
Jim Tobleson said they called in
a hostage negotiator.

285
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,737
Jim Tobleson's a fucking Chatty Cathy.

286
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:59,540
I did my three years up at the county pen.

287
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:03,269
Made some friends, went Muslim.
Now I'm out, praise Allah.

288
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,637
I heard that someone died that day.

289
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:09,642
Yeah, somebody did die that day.

290
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:13,580
Me.

291
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:18,154
I had the greatest job in the world,
brewing cold, fresh joy for thousands.

292
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,920
Not to mention all the beer
you could drink, right?

293
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,755
They took it away from me.

294
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:27,058
Yep, I'd trade all this in if I could get
that feeling back again.

295
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,629
What?

296
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,001
There he is.

297
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,703
Nathan Cornwell has discovered...

298
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:42,941
...pneumono-ultra-microscopic-
silico-volcano-canaisis.

299
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:44,517
Big round of applause, people.

300
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:47,781
You want that geek?

301
00:26:48,623 --> 00:26:51,091
What's he gonna do, check my urine?

302
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:54,462
I met Finkelstein back in college.

303
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:56,358
He was a real brainiac, that nerd.

304
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:59,456
Studied everything about everything.
Including beer.

305
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:01,258
So shut the fuck up.

306
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:03,529
What are you doing?
Put the frog on the table.

307
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,037
Clean out the floxinator
or something, all right?

308
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,142
People, listen up. Use your thumbs.

309
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:13,179
Locate the seminal vesicle here,
the ejaculatory ducts here.

310
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:16,579
Then stroke it.
Stroke it. Stroke it hard.

311
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:19,015
Cup the gonads.
If you don't cup the gonads...

312
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:20,381
Finky!

313
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,524
Jan? Todd?
What are you guys doing here?

314
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:26,422
- Hey, smart coat.
- Oh, thank you. It's rayon.

315
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:30,923
What are you doing?

316
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:33,465
We're extracting frog gamete
for cloning trials.

317
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:35,326
You're jerking him off.

318
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,732
- Who's the hippo?
- Phil Krundel.

319
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:39,571
The name's Landfill.

320
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,508
Listen, Fink.
We're putting together a drinking team.

321
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:45,168
There's a competition
and we want you to be part of it.

322
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:49,108
- Come on. I'm really busy.
- We're serious.

323
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:53,187
You don't understand. I'm a respected
member of the scientific community.

324
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:55,278
Sorry.

325
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:58,255
- We can't do it without you, Fink.
- No chance. I have a job.

326
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,827
I've got a house with a pool
and a two-car garage. I got three Ph.D.s.

327
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:03,657
Hey! Don't do that!

328
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:05,800
- I'm published in four journals.
- What?

329
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:06,956
<i>Toad Load Weekly?</i>

330
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:10,627
We need you, Fink.
America needs you.

331
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:12,796
That sounds a little dramatic.

332
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:16,501
That's the part we haven't told you.
We're competing against the Germans.

333
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:22,344
Germans?

334
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:25,975
Yeah. Big, blond, asshole Germans.

335
00:28:32,193 --> 00:28:33,785
You got 15 minutes to tell me more.

336
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,966
- Can you move over, please?
- I like to sit in the middle.

337
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,571
What am I supposed to do?

338
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:46,536
You have room. You're little.

339
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:49,302
- You wanna sit on this side?
- Fuck you.

340
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:52,873
Jan, who are we meeting out here?

341
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,811
- Jan, who are we meeting out here?
- Barry Badrinath.

342
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,415
- What? No.
- Who's Barry Badrinath?

343
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,387
- I'm putting a team together.
- Turn around.

344
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,151
- Who's Barry?
- Don't worry.

345
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,727
Who's Barry Badrinath?
Who's Barry Badrinath?

346
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:11,229
Will you shut the hell up? Shut up.

347
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:13,594
Barry Badrinath was the
best beer-gamer ever.

348
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:15,998
Best at Quarters, at Pong,
best at everything.

349
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:19,930
We should put him on our team.

350
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:22,708
Well, actually, Barry and Todd
had a falling-out.

351
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:25,243
- See, Barry doinked Todd's girlfriend.
- Yahtzee.

352
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:26,437
- Zip it, Fink.
- Sorry.

353
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:28,878
Just think about Gam Gam
for a minute, all right?

354
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,585
- Is this guy really that good?
- Yeah.

355
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,583
He's the best.

356
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,889
We should put him on our team, then.

357
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,398
- There he is.
- Where?

358
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:47,762
Right there.

359
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:48,925
Oh, my God.

360
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:50,434
What happened to him?

361
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:54,204
All right. It's a regular
hot-dog cart in here, huh?

362
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:56,709
All right, here's how it works.

363
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,540
One dollar to look at it.
Two dollars to touch it.

364
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,012
Three dollars to watch me touch it.

365
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:03,844
That's lots of nice-looking manhood.

366
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:05,576
Back the fuck up, Antonio!

367
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:07,414
My dick!

368
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,756
My apologies.

369
00:30:09,924 --> 00:30:11,892
Five to touch it
while I touch my toes.

370
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,824
Six dollars to touch it
while I touch your toe...

371
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,223
Oh, hey, Jan. How are you?

372
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,730
Todd. And Fink.

373
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,138
- Hey, looking good, Finky.
- You too, Barry.

374
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,973
I wish I could give you a deal here,
but my pimp's a real ball ache, you know?

375
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:38,579
So it's $ 10 for a BJ,
$ 12 for an HJ, $ 15 for a ZJ.

376
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,845
What's a ZJ?

377
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:42,785
If you have to ask, big man,
you can't afford it.

378
00:30:42,957 --> 00:30:44,857
I got $4.

379
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:47,756
Barry, we didn't come here for a BJ...

380
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,262
...or a ZJ or any kind of a J.

381
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,631
Move along, then.
I got a mouth to feed.

382
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,494
Barry, wait.

383
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,306
Jan, hold on.
That's not such a good idea.

384
00:30:59,474 --> 00:31:00,839
Barry!

385
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,369
There's this big beer-games competition.

386
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:04,944
We're putting a team together.

387
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:07,781
- We want you.
- Twenty-five bucks.

388
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,385
No, no, no. You'd be training
with us over the next year.

389
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,716
- Thirty bucks?
- Jan, forget it.

390
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:18,723
No, just show us some of
the old coin tricks. Come on.

391
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:23,523
Oh, please, Jan, let's get out of here.

392
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:25,222
- No. Wait.
- No?

393
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,362
Clearly, you've fallen on hard times.

394
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:30,197
This would be a chance
to get back to the glory days.

395
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:33,363
It's a chance to show you still got it.
You still got it, right?

396
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:37,142
You bet your ass I do.

397
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,643
Show them.

398
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:42,849
Watch and learn, baby diapers.

399
00:31:43,017 --> 00:31:44,348
Just like college.

400
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:59,861
It's nothing to worry about.
He's shaking the cobwebs off.

401
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:01,968
I got it. I got it.

402
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,566
All right, here we go.

403
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,536
- A little sticky on the:
- Yeah.

404
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,843
- This guy blows.
- Come on. You can do it.

405
00:32:10,945 --> 00:32:12,378
Glasses, maybe. I...

406
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,912
What are you looking at?

407
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:21,619
Barry, what happened to you?

408
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:26,389
Get out of here! Get out of here!

409
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:29,590
- Get out of here!
- Barry, Barry...

410
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:32,860
- Get out of here!
- Help! Help!

411
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,337
So, what about
Dan "The Magic Man" Dunchkowski?

412
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:39,268
He'd down a beer ball
with every meal.

413
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,908
He's no good.
He had that Al Roker surgery.

414
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:43,168
He went black?

415
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:45,539
Don't be a moron.
He got his stomach stapled.

416
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,443
Most he can fit are two Triscuits
and a glass of water.

417
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:49,981
Really?

418
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,546
Oh, boy.

419
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,985
Wolfhouses, I want on the team.

420
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:59,320
Forget about it. You're done.
You don't have any more, Badrinath.

421
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:01,018
Oh, yeah?

422
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:15,142
He's got a gun!

423
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:32,987
Unbelievable!

424
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:34,521
That's incredible.

425
00:33:35,496 --> 00:33:36,861
I'm better when I'm drunk.

426
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:39,261
- I'll say.
- Of course. So is everybody.

427
00:33:40,902 --> 00:33:43,598
Hey. Looks like we got ourselves a team!

428
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,035
- Get them in there.
- All right!

429
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,536
Well, boys, if we're gonna train...

430
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,472
...we're gonna need a training facility!

431
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:02,850
It's perfect!

432
00:34:03,491 --> 00:34:04,822
It's amazing!

433
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:07,961
Look at the size of this
graduated cylinder: 2000 milliliters!

434
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,528
A direct-draw beer dispenser.

435
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:13,193
Half-barrel capacity,
with an anti-foaming mechanism.

436
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:14,698
These are really the coins?

437
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:18,972
Hey. I think I found us
a creepy new mascot.

438
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:23,811
Yeah, fuck it.
Yeah, give it a rim job.

439
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,809
Don't. That belonged to our grandpa.

440
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:29,207
Sorry.

441
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:31,810
Listen up, fellas.

442
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,388
The next 11 months
are gonna be tough.

443
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:36,716
As tough as anything you've ever done.

444
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:40,520
We're gonna drink beer.
And a lot of it.

445
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:43,053
If anybody here isn't up to it...

446
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:46,098
...l'm gonna give you one last chance
to walk out that door.

447
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:52,865
- That's a good one, Todd.
- Good. That's what I wanted to hear.

448
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,636
Because in this silver slice of
heaven here are 1984 ounces of beer.

449
00:34:57,812 --> 00:34:59,245
Golden, delicious beer.

450
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:02,541
And no one leaves here until we finish
every single last drop.

451
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:04,617
All right, let's have the keys.

452
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:09,519
- All you guys. You too, big boy.
- Don't lose these.

453
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:12,215
All right, Fink, hit me.

454
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:14,857
Sorry. I'm a mathlete, not an athlete.

455
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:19,389
Hey, Barry, how about
a little warm-up match?

456
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:23,532
Good one. But I'll leave
the practicing to the amateurs.

457
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:31,369
All right, guys, let's focus, huh?
Huddle up.

458
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,070
All right!

459
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,211
Guys, those Germans
are incredible drinkers.

460
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:39,643
Better than anything I've ever seen.

461
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:42,449
Now, Fink, they've got
this thing called The Boot.

462
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:45,319
There's a secret way to drink it.
I don't know what it is.

463
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:48,462
- You'll have to figure that out for us.
- You got it, Hot Toddy.

464
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:51,029
One more thing,
I cannot stress this enough, people.

465
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,727
This is a super-secret competition.
You cannot tell anybody about this.

466
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,063
Or else what?

467
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,638
The guy that brought us there,
they killed him.

468
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:06,505
But let's not worry about that now.

469
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:10,216
- Let's drink some beer!
- Yeah!

470
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:13,080
- All right!
- Yeah, cheers!

471
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:21,188
Ice cold.

472
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:22,795
- Anyone else's cold?
- Really cold.

473
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:26,525
Drinking and dancing at the same time.
That's what's making it tough.

474
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:28,794
Thought there might be a bug in there.

475
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,167
My teeth hurt, it's so cold.
That's what makes me have to stop a bit.

476
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,808
- How many beers in this thing?
- About 125 beers, yeah.

477
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:36,671
A hundred and twenty-five?

478
00:36:36,844 --> 00:36:38,675
Might have a cavity here.

479
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,446
- You're dead, bitch.
- Oh, yeah?

480
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,781
Remember we made Fudgsicles out
of shit and Mark DeFanti ate one?

481
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,179
Eight points.

482
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:55,693
These big ones have
a different flight pattern.

483
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,464
Nobody said it was gonna be easy.

484
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,200
That shiner's sure starting to fade, huh?

485
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:03,030
Yeah, I kind of wish it wouldn't.

486
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:05,638
It's great motivation.
A reminder of the humiliation.

487
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,831
I wouldn't mind having it
while training.

488
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:10,537
Okay.

489
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,177
You are a good friend.

490
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:22,754
All right, here we go.

491
00:37:26,193 --> 00:37:27,820
Oh, yeah.

492
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,929
I know you love it, Muscle Lips.
Let's go.

493
00:37:30,097 --> 00:37:32,258
Lap it up, you hungry son of a bitch.

494
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,258
Sorry.

495
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,900
Get a handle on your Frisbee, college boy.

496
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:40,563
Don't go there. You do not sully a yarmulke,
you <i>goyim schmendrik miskayt.</i>

497
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:43,073
I don't know why you're here.
You can't drink beer.

498
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,405
I'll show you how to drink
a beer, motherfucker.

499
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:46,603
Fucking man cow.

500
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:53,516
Hey, I think somebody's trying
to chug in my face!

501
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,746
Look out, Germans!

502
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:56,287
You got <i>chutzpah,</i> Fuckelstein.

503
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:03,153
- That's great.
- Hey, Todd.

504
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:06,596
About the old girlfriend thing.
Can we bury the hatchet, buddy?

505
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:10,733
- I don't know.
- It was just a one-night stand, right?

506
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,966
Wasn't even that good-looking.
Real dead fish, right?

507
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:19,345
I mean, she just laid there, taking it
like a plastic fuck doll, am I right?

508
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:24,079
I happen to have married
that plastic fuck doll!

509
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:25,582
Todd, no!

510
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:28,854
Hey! Get off him!

511
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:33,319
Someone's chewing my leg!

512
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,735
I hate you, Badrinath!

513
00:39:01,522 --> 00:39:05,891
Oh, my God. Phil. Phil, honey.

514
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,925
Oh, my God.

515
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:10,655
Hello? Yes.

516
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:13,959
We need an ambulance immediately
at 622 Francis Drive.

517
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:18,430
Come on, Phil.
Stay with me, honey.

518
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:26,711
Oh, my God, what is that?

519
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:28,473
Ham.

520
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:30,205
Phil?

521
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:53,604
Not again.

522
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:21,690
How'd we do?

523
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:25,599
Not good.

524
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:33,104
If we're gonna drink like the Germans,
I think we're gonna need a little help.

525
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:35,071
You don't have to yell.

526
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:39,451
Don't say anything to Great Gam Gam
about the competition.

527
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:41,479
Don't talk about her being a whore.

528
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:43,418
- She's a whore?
- No, she's not a whore.

529
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,786
- So what if she was a whore?
- She's not.

530
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,394
I'm just saying, some of
my best friends are whores.

531
00:40:48,562 --> 00:40:49,756
Yeah, we know.

532
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,092
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Wolfhouse.

533
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:57,434
- Can I help you?
- Who are you?

534
00:40:57,738 --> 00:40:58,932
My name's Cherry.

535
00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:01,802
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is fine.

536
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:03,637
Great Gam Gam.

537
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:08,305
Cherry is here to help me
now that my Johan is gone.

538
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:12,149
<i>Mein</i> darling great-grandboys...

539
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,879
<i>...und</i> their delicious-looking friends.

540
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,023
Come in.

541
00:41:21,595 --> 00:41:23,995
And summer sausage.

542
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:26,065
Just came out of the refrigerator.

543
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:30,226
Here, try this. Oh, no, wait.
Here, let me warm it up for you.

544
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:43,580
No, that's fine. We're okay.

545
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:48,085
When we were at Oktoberfest, we noticed
that the Germans were excellent drinkers.

546
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,486
- Oh, yeah, that is true. That is a true thing.
- How do they get good?

547
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:53,957
Well, from the time
that they are little kids...

548
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:56,756
...Germans are raised
to be excellent beer drinkers.

549
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,365
- How?
- Well, for one thing...

550
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:02,001
...they train high up in the Alps.

551
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:06,572
Interesting. High-altitude training.
Similar to the Kenyan marathon runners.

552
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,369
They are also taught to relax
the muscles of the throat.

553
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:13,012
Germans can pretty much
stick anything down there.

554
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:17,810
I myself can probably fit in at least...
Oh, at least nine inches.

555
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,777
- Here, let me show you.
- No. You don't have to demonstrate.

556
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,389
What else do the Germans do?

557
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:27,516
They also practice by drinking
the urine of a ram.

558
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:30,019
- The what?
- They drink ram's piss.

559
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:32,062
- Because of the pH balance?
- No.

560
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:37,193
Because if you can drink ram's piss,
fuck, you can drink almost anything.

561
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:41,207
- She said "fuck."
- Gam, who's drinking piss, honey?

562
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:45,004
No, I was saying it was a tradition
back in the old country.

563
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:48,179
Damn, that's nasty. The old country
must have been fucked up.

564
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:50,317
Now, come on, baby,
it's time for your nap.

565
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,452
- Come on.
- Okay. Well...

566
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,053
See you boys later.

567
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:59,282
I always sleep better
when I have a little sausage in me.

568
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:07,660
Look, if you ask me...

569
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,929
...l'd have to say the whole whore thing
is a real possibility.

570
00:43:11,105 --> 00:43:15,041
Bavarians have been warming
sausages like that for hundreds of years.

571
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:17,336
Would you say
it's their oldest profession?

572
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,535
Shut up, Landfill.

573
00:43:18,712 --> 00:43:21,647
All right, but more importantly,
where are we gonna find a ram?

574
00:43:37,498 --> 00:43:39,625
I'm gonna fucking puke.

575
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:43,292
That's the most
disgusting thing I've ever drank.

576
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,801
I doubt that, playboy.

577
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:49,070
Oh, God, is there anything better?

578
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,502
Not right now.

579
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:56,078
You know, fellas,
maybe training alone on a rooftop...

580
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,741
...drinking ram piss isn't the way to go.

581
00:43:58,919 --> 00:44:02,514
Maybe we should get out there and
mix it up with some randoms, you know?

582
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,090
- Smart idea, college boy.
- Go test our mettle.

583
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:07,591
Yeah, challenge somebody.
Challenge ourselves.

584
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:08,989
Let's get bombed!

585
00:44:09,163 --> 00:44:10,755
Yeah!

586
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:37,991
Hey. Who ordered
the <i>Queer Eye</i> makeover?

587
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:56,736
We're the party brigade.

588
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,037
We're here to play
some drinking games.

589
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:06,982
Drink. You're rowing on the wrong side.

590
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:08,314
You've gotta drink.

591
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:09,819
I've got one.

592
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,049
I never made out with Tommy Mullarky.

593
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:20,430
My turn. I never fooled around
with Coach Gerber.

594
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:33,078
This one's called the Strikeout.

595
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:35,477
What you're gonna do is take a hit...

596
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,777
...chug your beer, do a shot,
then blow out the smoke.

597
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:40,783
Here goes nothing.

598
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:47,192
Careful, dude. It's gonna fuck you up.

599
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:08,373
That's not bad at all.

600
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:10,640
"Strikeout," right?

601
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,412
That's nothing.

602
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:16,856
Don't...

603
00:46:17,658 --> 00:46:20,183
...really, however, see what...

604
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:21,689
...all the...

605
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,496
...fuss is about.

606
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:28,156
- Oh, yeah. Way to go Dr. Finklestein.
- Do I know you?

607
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:31,065
- Yeah. It's me, Jerry, your paperboy.
- Hey, Jerry.

608
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:37,041
While I have you here, you forgot
my Sunday supplement last week.

609
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:13,344
Wake up, Finky. Wake up.

610
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:16,579
Cops, cops, cops!

611
00:47:29,029 --> 00:47:31,463
Dude, aren't you like 40?

612
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:36,695
I'm 33.

613
00:47:44,478 --> 00:47:46,309
Hey, what the hell?

614
00:47:46,813 --> 00:47:47,802
Help!

615
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:52,349
What a great morning.

616
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:11,626
Night, ladies.

617
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,136
- Night, Todd.
- Bye, Todd.

618
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,973
Say hi to the missus.

619
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,507
All right, guys, come on.

620
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:19,009
- One, two, three.
- Go.

621
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:22,211
My glasses!

622
00:48:24,618 --> 00:48:26,051
Two, three, go.

623
00:48:30,924 --> 00:48:32,721
Maybe we'll move to mugs tomorrow.

624
00:48:32,893 --> 00:48:34,155
He's so strict.

625
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,454
Hey, Finky...

626
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:37,995
...how you doing with The Boot?
- Not there yet.

627
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,328
I have figured out the problem,
I just don't know the solution yet.

628
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,661
Check this out.

629
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,828
Hey, fellas, gather up.

630
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,034
Here's the thing.

631
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:56,148
When you drink, the shape of the boot
causes an air bubble to form in the toe.

632
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:57,305
The bubble.

633
00:48:57,484 --> 00:48:59,475
This air bubble
shoots around the heel...

634
00:48:59,653 --> 00:49:02,121
...and explodes towards your face
while drinking.

635
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:04,723
In your face, it explodes.

636
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:07,655
- It's impossible to handle.
- It's impossible to handle.

637
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:09,887
It's unavoidable.
The Germans know how.

638
00:49:10,063 --> 00:49:13,191
I find the whole thing frustrating
because I can't figure it out.

639
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,096
It's frustrating.

640
00:49:15,268 --> 00:49:16,735
It's frustrating.

641
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:18,598
It's frustrating.

642
00:49:18,772 --> 00:49:21,104
It's frustrating. It's frustrat...

643
00:49:21,274 --> 00:49:22,866
Can you get the puppet off of me?!

644
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:25,937
- Hey, it's Popo.
- Sorry.

645
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:27,341
You knocked his head off.

646
00:49:27,514 --> 00:49:29,448
Wait, wait. There's something in there.

647
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,549
Hey, what is that?

648
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,818
- Looks like it's German.
- Aren't you guys German?

649
00:49:36,323 --> 00:49:37,722
- Yeah, so?
- Give me that.

650
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:41,021
I used to work
on a German cruise ship.

651
00:49:46,033 --> 00:49:47,330
Yeah, it's a beer recipe.

652
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:49,662
- Really?
- What recipe?

653
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:51,998
Must be the old German beer recipe.

654
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:55,664
Those Germans said our grandfather
stole their family recipe.

655
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:58,310
- lf he had it, why didn't he brew it?
- Hebrew?

656
00:49:58,478 --> 00:50:01,345
- Maybe he didn't know it was in here.
- It supposed to be good?

657
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:05,611
If this is the recipe, this used to be
Germany's greatest beer.

658
00:50:08,622 --> 00:50:10,214
Okay, we want three cups.

659
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,448
That's right. Good.

660
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:13,616
Pour it on in, pour it on in.

661
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:15,625
Okay, good. Let's have a little...

662
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:37,673
- How is it, Jan?
- Tell us.

663
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:38,943
It's...

664
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,950
It's beautiful.

665
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:49,791
- It's magical.
- It's laughing at me.

666
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,760
I wish I could brush my teeth with it.

667
00:50:51,932 --> 00:50:54,162
- I wanna put my dick in it.
- I want it to put its dick in me.

668
00:50:54,334 --> 00:50:57,303
I wish it were winter, we could
make it into ice and skate on it.

669
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,564
Then melt it in the springtime
and drink it.

670
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,900
Hey, what's the matter, Jan?

671
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,877
This means Gam Gam
really was a whore.

672
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:23,455
It is good, it is good.

673
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:29,098
I can't serve it fast enough.

674
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:32,102
- Hey, buddy.
- Go with God.

675
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:34,638
Hey, Wolfie. Give me a Schnitz.

676
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,544
- Nice bottle.
- Hey, Landfill.

677
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:43,439
Look at this guy! He's getting better.

678
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:47,679
Dude, you want a Schnitz?

679
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,482
Do you want a tip with that?

680
00:51:51,758 --> 00:51:52,918
Yeah.

681
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:54,250
Good one.

682
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,758
- Give me six Schnitzes.
- What the doctor ordered.

683
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,735
Drink, drink, drink!

684
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,884
Good, good, good.

685
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:23,449
Special delivery!

686
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,486
I have this special delivery
for Herr Baron.

687
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,150
Can't you see we are training?

688
00:52:28,595 --> 00:52:31,860
I am so sorry, but this package
comes all the way from America, ja...

689
00:52:32,032 --> 00:52:34,865
...and look, it is marked:
"Most urgent."

690
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:57,081
What is it, Grandpapa?

691
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:03,561
They have the recipe.

692
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:08,334
- Who else knows of this package?
- Absolutely no one.

693
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:09,661
Only me. It's just me.

694
00:53:09,836 --> 00:53:11,360
- Dispose of him.
- Wait!

695
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:14,367
No, no, no! What about
"Don't shoot the messenger," right?

696
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,372
We're not going to shoot you.

697
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:19,011
Boys, prepare your things.

698
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:20,338
We are going to America.

699
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:25,910
To get our recipe!

700
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,321
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> messenger boy.

701
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:35,254
Up your nose <i>mit</i> the rubber hose!

702
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:44,728
I don't really have a move
except this one.

703
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:46,463
Are you out?

704
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,937
Finish your beer, asshole.

705
00:53:49,576 --> 00:53:50,565
<i>Asshole!</i>

706
00:53:50,744 --> 00:53:52,439
<i>Asshole! Asshole! Asshole!</i>

707
00:53:55,615 --> 00:53:57,480
Eat that tomato in one bite, asshole.

708
00:53:58,251 --> 00:54:01,652
<i>Asshole! Asshole! Asshole!</i>

709
00:54:04,557 --> 00:54:06,457
- Good job, asshole.
- Oh, no.

710
00:54:06,626 --> 00:54:08,059
- Where you going?
- Get out of here.
