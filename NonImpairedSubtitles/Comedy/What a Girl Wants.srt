<i>My name is Daphne Reynolds
and I was born in New York City.</i>

3
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:47,018
<i>I've lived my whole life with my mom
in a fifth-floor walkup in Chinatown.</i>

4
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:51,525
<i>It's always been just the two of us,
me and Libby.</i>

5
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:55,362
<i>But every year on my birthday
I'd make a wish.</i>

6
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,864
Make a wish, baby!

7
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,728
<i>That someone else could be there too.</i>

8
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,704
<i>And every year when he didn't come...</i>

9
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,275
<i>...I'd ask my mom to tell me
the same story.</i>

10
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:15,507
You never get tired of this one,
do you? Okay.

11
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,482
Once upon a time...

12
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:21,590
<i>...there was a young,
very cool singer named Libby...</i>

13
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:25,250
<i>...who one day decided to go out
and see the world.</i>

14
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:37,098
<i>Little did she know that in the deserts
of Morocco fate was waiting for her...</i>

15
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:45,237
<i>...and his name was Henry.</i>

16
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:57,754
<i>They fell madly, passionately,
hopelessly in love...</i>

17
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:02,659
<i>...and were married
by the chief of a Bedouin tribe.</i>

18
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:13,234
<i>Henry brought her to England to meet
his family so they could get married for real.</i>

19
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:18,948
<i>But fate was not so kind this time.</i>

20
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,107
<i>She was definitely not
what they were expecting.</i>

21
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:29,287
<i>But when Henry's father suddenly died...</i>

22
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,589
<i>...Libby knew there'd be more pressure
on him to lead a certain kind of life...</i>

23
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:37,130
<i>...because he was now Lord Dashwood...</i>

24
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,133
<i>...and Libby was no one's idea of a lady.</i>

25
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,431
Henry knows all about it.
lf you love him, you will go now.

26
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,667
l think you should see this.

27
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,281
Apparently there's someone else.

28
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:04,622
<i>So even though it broke her heart,
she knew she had to leave him.</i>

29
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:13,925
<i>But a few months later, fate
gave her the greatest gift of all:</i>

30
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:18,199
<i>A beautiful baby girl named Daphne.</i>

31
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,870
Sweet dreams, kiddo.

32
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:24,605
-Love you.
-Love you.

33
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,349
l can't believe you're 1 5 years old today.

34
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:40,929
Sweet dreams, Henry.

35
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:52,303
<i>On my 1 7th birthday,
Mom and I had to work.</i>

36
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,376
<i>But it turned out to be
where my story really began.</i>

37
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,911
You delivering something?

38
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:01,209
Yeah, about three hours
of watered-down rock and roll...

39
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,215
...and one very late waitress.

40
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,718
Sorry.

41
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,015
Watch your head.

42
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:09,886
Are you related?

43
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,226
-Can l park it?
-Yeah, over there.

44
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:29,668
How could he do this to me?
lt's our wedding day! Where is he?

45
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:34,180
What? l should know?
20 minutes and she's lost him already.

46
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,874
Very funny.

47
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,681
Hey, how you doing?

48
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,795
l'm sorry, can l borrow this? Thanks.

49
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:58,600
Thanks.

50
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:03,979
Sorry about this.
Come on, big guy, wakey-wakey.

51
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:10,313
Help! Ma!

52
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:15,650
-lt's cold and l can't get it out!
-Shout!

53
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,883
Shout!

54
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,918
-Are you done with this, sir?
-Oh, thanks.

55
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,456
Daphne?

56
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,659
-Noelle!
-What are you doing here?

57
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,854
l'm clearing the chicken cacciatore.

58
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:57,591
Oh, my God, that is so funny!

59
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:02,363
Guess what? l'm interning at Jenkins
and Taylor before l go to Duke, pre-law.

60
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,905
-What's up next for you?
-The dessert, a selection of sorbets.

61
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:10,535
-No, where are you going to college?
-The University of the Undecided.

62
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,048
ls that in Ohio?

63
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:15,479
Yeah.

64
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,642
Undecided, Ohio.

65
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,052
Well, l guess l better be going.
But say hey to Jenkins. And Taylor.

66
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:25,126
-But--
-lf everyone would clear the dance floor...

67
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:29,094
...the bride and her father
would like to share a special dance.

68
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,649
-l know. l saw the look.
-l don't want to talk about it.

69
00:08:55,818 --> 00:09:00,517
Every time we do these weddings, Mom,
l see the father-daughter dances.

70
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,021
l just--

71
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:06,184
l can't help but think that
l'm never gonna get to do that.

72
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:10,321
l know you think you're doing the
right thing by keeping me from him--

73
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:14,528
l was trying to protect you
from getting hurt the same way l was.

74
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,296
You left him, remember?

75
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,464
lt's not like he jumped on a plane
and came after me.

76
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,100
Maybe he would have
if he knew l existed.

77
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:30,117
-lt's not that simple.
-Why can't you understand, Mom?

78
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:33,483
l feel like half of me is missing.

79
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:38,150
And without the other half, how am
l supposed to know who l really am?

80
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,525
Daph.

81
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:46,032
Getting to know someone because
they share the same DNA isn't the answer.

82
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:49,537
lt's about getting to know yourself.

83
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,943
Come on, let's go steal some leftovers.
Lasagna looks great.

84
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:03,279
l love you a million Swedish fish.

85
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,721
l love you a million red M&M's.

86
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,429
Taxi!

87
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,439
-Where to, miss?
-JFK, Virgin Atlantic.

88
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:04,772
No problem.

89
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:08,348
<i>Maybe the answer was taking
a year or two off before college...</i>

90
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:11,509
<i>...to find out what I'm supposed
to do with my life.</i>

91
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:16,314
<i>But deep down,
I think I've always known...</i>

92
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,694
<i>...what I really need more than anything
else in the world is to find him...</i>

93
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:24,094
<i>...to find my dad.</i>

94
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:28,702
<i>Mom, you always said it was up to me
to write the rest of my story...</i>

95
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:31,704
<i>...but you've been writing it for me,
Mom.</i>

96
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:35,376
<i>Now it has to be my turn.</i>

97
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:45,153
-Can l borrow that for a sec?
-Sure.

98
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:32,664
Great Britain Grand Hotel?

99
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,393
What?

100
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,860
-That's not it.
-lt sounded really good.

101
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,161
-Thanks.
-ls that a Gibson J200?

102
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:09,327
Yeah.

103
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:13,703
-Are you a musician?
-No, but l live with one back home.

104
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:17,609
My mom.

105
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,380
So you checking in?

106
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,512
-Day job?
-Yeah. One of many.

107
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:27,485
You know, life of a struggling musician.

108
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:29,419
Hey, lan, catch!

109
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:34,222
Come on, l'll show you around.

110
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:39,128
So the kitchen's through there.

111
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:41,235
Common room's down the hall.

112
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:45,601
l should warn you, the dog and bone's
on the blink and we've no lift here.

113
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,175
Phone is broken.

114
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:51,040
Elevator, none.

115
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:53,181
Loo's free.

116
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,040
Who's Lou?

117
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:58,618
We better take this slowly.

118
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:01,847
<i>Lord Henry Dashwood announced today...</i>

119
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:05,357
<i>...he was giving up his hereditary seat
in the House of Lords...</i>

120
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,655
<i>...to run for election as a commoner.</i>

121
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,891
<i>Why should an accident of birth give me
the right to make decisions for people?</i>

122
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,092
<i>-The only power I want...
-My dad!</i>

123
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,003
<i>...is the power the voters choose to give
me. That's why I'm standing in this election.</i>

124
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:20,334
<i>Thank you.</i>

125
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:25,276
<i>Lord Dashwood, who will marry his fiancée
Glynnis Payne this summer...</i>

126
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:29,247
<i>...will also inherit a stepdaughter,
the lovely Clarissa Payne.</i>

127
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:34,481
<i>But this surprising announcement has sent
shock waves through Westminster.</i>

128
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:37,888
<i>He now appears to be
an unstoppable political force.</i>

129
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,360
l admit, when you first suggested
giving up your seat in the House of Lords...

130
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:48,333
...l began to question your sanity.
But, no, this is political dynamite.

131
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:52,031
l had an eccentric idea we might
actually be doing the right thing.

132
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:55,233
lt's possible to do the right thing
and still be a winner.

133
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:59,677
The latest poll puts the party six points
ahead. That's all due to you, Henry.

134
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:03,716
You're transforming the image
of the party your father loved.

135
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:08,880
He would have been so proud of you.
You're young, thrusting, idealistic...

136
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,650
...an impeccable reputation....

137
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:14,557
And a fabulous fiancée
with all the right connections.

138
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:19,497
Sorry to interrupt, but if l don't steal him
he'll miss his speech at the Oxfam ball.

139
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,660
-Oh, blast it, my speech.
-Right-hand pocket, darling.

140
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,698
She thinks of everything.

141
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:31,579
Well, gentlemen, that seems to be all.
Thank you.

142
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:33,977
You two enjoy yourselves.

143
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,378
How's our boy doing?

144
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:41,990
lf he doesn't ruffle too many feathers,
he'll be the next prime minister.

145
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:43,749
Excellent.

146
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:52,190
lan, l don't know if l can do this anymore.

147
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,835
Daphne, he's your father.

148
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:58,167
You've flown halfway around the world
to see him. You can't turn back now.

149
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,604
He's got a family now, l mean....

150
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:04,803
You saw them, they're so elegant
and sophisticated. lt's like....

151
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,409
What would he want with me?

152
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:11,019
-Yeah, well, you got a point there.
-Shut up.

153
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:15,045
lt's just not as simple as l thought.

154
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:20,525
Maybe l should just go home
and let him get on with his life.

155
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,357
Can l help you, miss?

156
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,493
Actually, no.

157
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,569
Thanks.

158
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:41,271
<i>Perfect. Absolutely wonderful.
Thank you so much. Ciao.</i>

159
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:46,381
You haven't forgotten Lady Wrightwood's
this afternoon, have you?

160
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:50,644
She is sponsoring us for the Royal Enclosure
at Ascot. We have to be there.

161
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:53,822
l thought marrying Henry
meant we didn't have to try so hard.

162
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,082
l'm not getting married for five weeks.

163
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:58,419
Until then we have
to keep up appearances.

164
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:01,791
Look what happened to Olivia Dixon
when she went to China.

165
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,990
-Who's Olivia Dixon?
-Exactly.

166
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,146
-Did you see that?
-What?

167
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:24,479
An impossibly large bird
falling off that wall.

168
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:28,180
Are you hallucinating?

169
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,076
These eggs are positively glacial.

170
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:55,842
When l run this house, senile servants
will be the first thing to go.

171
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:59,249
You'd have to get around the old bat.
She'd never allow it.

172
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:02,356
Anyone seen my pruning shears?

173
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:05,891
The old bat seems to have forgotten
where she put them.

174
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:14,068
Morning. Morning, Mother.
Morning, darling.

175
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,738
Everyone sleep well?

176
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:19,238
Apparently not.

177
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,600
There's someone at the window.
l'm not hallucinating.

178
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,575
lt's those bloody paparazzi again.

179
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,079
Percy, call the police.
l will not tolerate this media circus!

180
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,190
-Where do you think you're going?
-lt's you!

181
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:43,422
How long do you people have to spy
before realizing there's no story?

182
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,500
-You've got the wrong idea.
-Tell it to the authorities.

183
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:50,263
The real scandal is how young
they're starting you guttersnipes now.

184
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:55,672
<i>You sit down and tell me who sent you.
The Sun? The Daily Star?</i>

185
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:01,612
Good heavens, you can't be
more than 1 7.

186
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:05,580
Go on, take your picture and go away.

187
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:08,416
-l already have a picture of you.
-What's going on?

188
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,526
-Where the devil did you get this?
-From Libby.

189
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,927
-That singer you met on a camel?
-Why would Libby give this to you?

190
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:25,471
She thought l'd want to know
what my father looked like.

191
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,372
My name is Daphne Reynolds.
l'm Libby's daughter.

192
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,440
According to this...

193
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,775
...l'm your daughter too.

194
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,178
Oh, for heaven's sake!

195
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:44,257
Seems you had an even better time
in Morocco than you let on.

196
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,859
Oh, dear God.

197
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,759
l haven't--

198
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:08,446
No, this is impossible.

199
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:11,051
-Must be a mistake.
-Exactly, a mistake.

200
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,880
This doesn't prove anything.

201
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:16,821
This Libby must have written down
the first man she could think of.

202
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:20,919
You're the only man she's ever thought of.

203
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,191
Can l have a word with you in private
for a moment, please?

204
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,302
Henry?

205
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,530
You're not going to believe her, are you?

206
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:35,033
Maybe l....

207
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,441
Maybe l shouldn't have come.
This is a big shock for you.

208
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:41,548
l'm freaking out
and l've known since l was 2.

209
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:46,586
Don't get me wrong, l mean in a good way.
l've dreamt about this my whole life.

210
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:51,348
Not that exact entrance, of course.
l imagined something more graceful.

211
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:56,458
l can see now
that it was probably a mistake.

212
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,431
l shouldn't have come.

213
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:09,203
Sorry, did you just say you've known
about this your whole life?

214
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:13,641
-Yeah.
-Good. Now we've got that settled...

215
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:16,079
...how about some tea
and a piece of fruitcake?

216
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,981
Your mother didn't feel l deserved
the same consideration?

217
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:22,123
-No to the fruitcake, then.
-How could she keep this from me?!

218
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:27,193
What happened to the mistake theory
we were operating on a moment ago?

219
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,523
No, wait a minute, ducky.

220
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:35,062
Henry, l know this has come as a shock,
but we can't just let the girl go.

221
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:39,333
-Not until we've got to the bottom of this.
-Shall l call a hotel, madam?

222
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,442
And tell them what, exactly?

223
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:47,014
The best-known candidate in a generation
is requesting a room for a teenage girl?

224
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:50,845
-The press will have a field day.
-Can we leave the press out of this?

225
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:55,183
-No, Glynnis is absolutely right.
-Thank God someone else is thinking straight.

226
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:58,155
The girl must stay here, with us.

227
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:06,891
Darling, before we let this hypothetical
daughter blow your political career...

228
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:10,129
-...we might consider checking up on her.
-For what?

229
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,172
Criminal record? Blood type?
Triple sixes on her scalp?

230
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:19,143
Glynnis, she has a birth certificate,
she has my photograph and she has my eyes.

231
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:21,745
Only thinking of what's best for you.

232
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:25,512
l know you don't like thinking about it,
but the press can be brutal.

233
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:28,815
''Exclusive! Henry Dashwood
in Love Child Shocker!''

234
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,949
Actually, she's not strictly a love child.
Her mother and l were married.

235
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:37,895
l mean, not technically.
lt was a Bedouin ceremony in Morocco.

236
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,694
We planned to make it official
as soon as we got back...

237
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:43,497
...but for some reason Libby decided to....

238
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,367
Well, anyway, she left.

239
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,703
-Taking something of yours with her.
-Put a cork in it.

240
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:52,836
Maybe someone should have put
a cork in it 1 7 years ago!

241
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,178
Well, here we are.

242
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:17,328
Will it do?

243
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:22,341
Are you kidding? lt's incredible!
lt's bigger than our entire apartment...

244
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:27,778
...and the restaurant downstairs. lt makes
the White House look like a McDonald's.

245
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:31,510
l get the point. Now, why don't
l send Percy to fetch your things?

246
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:35,247
-Thank you so much, Lady Dashwood.
-No hugs, dear.

247
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:39,792
l'm British. We only show affection
to dogs and horses.

248
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:42,252
Right.

249
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,933
You rock!

250
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,482
Hello?

251
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:09,789
<i>-Libby?
-Henry.</i>

252
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:13,394
-ls she there? ls she all right?
-Yeah, she's here.

253
00:25:14,229 --> 00:25:17,494
She's fine. Mother is force-feeding her
fruitcake as we speak.

254
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,592
How could you not tell me
l'd fathered a child?

255
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,831
You let her show up
1 7 years later, unannounced--

256
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:28,942
And what?
Put a dent in your political career?

257
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,375
-No, that's not--
-lf you're afraid of a scandal, send her back.

258
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:36,779
lt's not about scandal, it's finding out
l had a daughter for half my life!

259
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,328
Libby.

260
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,330
l didn't want her to get hurt.

261
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:56,436
<i>-What is that supposed to mean?
-Ask your advisors.</i>

262
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:59,904
They've gotten you this far, haven't they?

263
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:22,088
My point is that Henry's strength has
been that he's completely scandal-free...

264
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:25,825
...unlike his opponent.
This could ruin everything.

265
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,697
Have you finished stating the obvious?

266
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,964
Good. Then let me explain
what we're going to do.

267
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,167
We give the papers the story,
but we spin it our way.

268
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,335
Let's see what we have.

269
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,674
Yes, the Royal Dress Show.

270
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:45,720
lntroduce her as the daughter you've always
known, but rarely were able to be with.

271
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:48,913
The press still gets a story,
but it's cut off at the knees.

272
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,617
We are dealing with a living,
breathing 1 7-year-old girl.

273
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:56,696
The only thing we know is
that she's an American teenager.

274
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,560
Hardly a promising start.

275
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:02,863
Still, what do you think, Henry?
Liability or asset?

276
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,405
Well, l've only spent a few moments
with her myself...

277
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:09,702
...but my sense is that
she's quite mature for her age.

278
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,039
She seems well-mannered.

279
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,610
-Thanks, Percy!
-Your lunch, Miss Daphne.

280
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:24,350
l'd say rather self-contained, soft-spoken.

281
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:39,037
Perfect. Let's run with it.

282
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:44,540
Ah, me. Please be Armistead.

283
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:51,475
-Dashwood residence, Clarissa speaking.
-This is lan Wallace. ls Daphne there?

284
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:53,780
She's not here.

285
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:57,391
There's no one here by that name, actually.
Sorry.

286
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:04,329
lf you do happen to see her, could you
tell her lan Wallace is trying to find her?

287
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:06,797
Absolutely. l will.

288
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:09,726
Not.

289
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:36,558
-Daphne.
-Mr. Dashwood.

290
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,665
-Lord Dashwood?
-Call me Henry.

291
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,664
Henry. Okay.

292
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,432
-This is a cool room.
-Listen, l....

293
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,402
l was just wondering if....

294
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:54,872
l was wondering if.... Well, l don't know
if this would interest you, actually...

295
00:28:56,351 --> 00:29:00,447
...but l was hoping you might accompany
me to the Royal Dress Show on Friday?

296
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:04,455
-Dress show?
-Yes, it's ass-numbingly dull.

297
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:08,892
Some people l have to impress
take it frightfully seriously.

298
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:10,860
ls it like a fashion show?

299
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:15,059
Gwyneth and Madonna go to those things,
right? Do you think they'd be there?

300
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:19,605
l have no idea what you're talking about,
but for me it's a stop on the campaign trail.

301
00:29:19,774 --> 00:29:22,675
For Glynnis, it's a chance
to launch Clarissa on society.

302
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,142
Launch? You make her sound like a ship.

303
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:29,977
No, in Clarissa's case it's more like
an intercontinental ballistic missile.

304
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:34,145
She's what in the old days
might have been called a debutante.

305
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:38,892
Well, l don't know. l just....

306
00:29:40,728 --> 00:29:45,392
-Could you bear it?
-Could l bear it? l mean that'd be....

307
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:48,833
-That'd be cool.
-Really?

308
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:51,836
Well, good. That's settled, then.
That's good.

309
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,808
Good.

310
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:07,049
l forgot. l brought this for you.
lt's some pictures of me growing up.

311
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:10,218
-That's....
-l thought you might want to have it.

312
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,586
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

313
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,560
That's splendid, thank you.

314
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,033
Okay.

315
00:31:10,184 --> 00:31:13,745
Daphne, could l get your advice
on something?

316
00:31:13,922 --> 00:31:14,911
Sure.

317
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:18,024
l can't decide which one to wear
to the show tomorrow...

318
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:22,959
-...and l was wondering what you thought.
-ls that a Gucci tartan mini? That's so cute!

319
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:27,761
-You can go that funky to the show?
-Daphne, that's the whole point.

320
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:30,097
Turn up in a sensible dress and pearls...

321
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:33,536
...and you might as well wear
a sign saying, ''Spot the Plonker.''

322
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,543
l'm glad you told me.
Wouldn't want to be a plonker.

323
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:39,873
What are stepsisters for?

324
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,349
-This is really cute.
-Good. l'll wear that, then.

325
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:52,618
-See you later!
-Bye!

326
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:03,532
l'm here to see Daphne Reynolds.

327
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:06,868
-Do you have an appointment?
-No, but she's a friend of mine.

328
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:10,704
-You don't get in without an appointment.
-She'll want to see me.

329
00:32:10,878 --> 00:32:13,813
-Could you move away now, please, sir?
-What?

330
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:17,315
-Could you move away now, please?
-All right, chill out, mate.

331
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:19,851
You don't own the place.

332
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:40,669
No, stop!

333
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:56,123
No. Not good.

334
00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:01,789
l'm so sorry. One second.
l'll be right there. Almost ready.

335
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:04,026
One second!

336
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:08,191
We have to go! Prince Charles,
Harry and Wills will already be there.

337
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:11,031
Why doesn't Daphne come along later?

338
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:16,602
-l suppose Percy could drive--
-Brilliant. lt's settled, then.

339
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:23,548
Come on!

340
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,617
Well, isn't this perfect?

341
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,837
-Go low on that one, Army.
-Low? Low it is.

342
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:54,740
You'd think they'd choose debs who actually
had ankles. Those look like baked hams.

343
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:59,218
-Shall l park the car?
-No, see you later!

344
00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:02,117
Sorry. No admittance.
Show's already started.

345
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,484
Come on!

346
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:07,483
Cow!

347
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:16,833
Where is this Daphne, anyway?

348
00:34:17,004 --> 00:34:19,905
She'll probably swing through
on a vine any minute.

349
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:22,668
The girl is positively barbaric.

350
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:26,575
l hope she doesn't embarrass me
in front of Armistead.

351
00:34:34,355 --> 00:34:37,085
We still have the arrival
of Henry's illegitimate daughter.

352
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:42,286
You needn't worry. Henry assured me
she will be the soul of discretion.

353
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,391
-ls this the way to the show?
-Go! You're on!

354
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:53,501
Oh, my giddy aunt!

355
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:04,209
Holy poo on toast!

356
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:10,056
Henry...

357
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:11,956
...do something!

358
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:18,631
That's her.

359
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:30,007
Who is that adorable creature?

360
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,041
She can dump tea in my harbor anytime.

361
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,380
Thank you, London!

362
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:53,098
l say, are you all right?
Are you sure?

363
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:58,029
-What a disgrace!
-Must be American.

364
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:02,708
Make way, everyone.
Tacky American coming through.

365
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:06,310
<i>My evil stepsister.
You've seen Cinderella, right?</i>

366
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:09,949
Let me clue you in. l win.

367
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:16,518
-What a cute dog!
-l beg your pardon?

368
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:19,091
l'm Henry Dashwood's daughter
from New York.

369
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,491
-l didn't know Henry had a daughter.
-Can l play with him?

370
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,398
-She's very temperamental! A biter!
-Seems sweet.

371
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,899
-Hey, guy! l like the ribbon.
-Oh, dear. Excuse me, won't you?

372
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:34,735
Cute little guy, let's play.

373
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:38,242
-Princess Charlotte, l do apologize.
-lt's all right, Henry.

374
00:36:38,412 --> 00:36:44,112
l've just been having a delicious moment
with your daughter.

375
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:49,587
Wonderful girl. A little rough around
the edges, but you'll sort those out.

376
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:53,853
-ls she staying for the summer?
-No, no, no.

377
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:56,895
-Oh, l'm afraid not.
-No, no, no.

378
00:36:57,498 --> 00:36:58,487
-No.
-Yes.

379
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,864
My daughter will be
joining us this season.

380
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:04,300
-What season?
-Oh, my dear, you'll love it!

381
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,499
Beautiful gowns, lovely tiaras,
long, silky gloves...

382
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:12,703
...and the feverish kissing
in the cloakroom.

383
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,314
l must have my little baby back.

384
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,680
Come here, my darling. There.

385
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,378
There now, sweetheart.

386
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:24,751
-You've found a new friend.
-Come on, Daphne.

387
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:27,622
-Who's my precious girl?
-Let's get you out of here.

388
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:31,390
-Daddy.
-Relax, darling, relax.

389
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:35,001
She'll be gone in no time,
just like her mother.

390
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:49,409
Jesus!

391
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:52,875
-You scared the bejesus out of me.
-Sorry.

392
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:55,318
So you're the milk thief.

393
00:37:57,591 --> 00:38:01,425
-What're you doing up so late?
-Jet lag.

394
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:03,956
What's your excuse?

395
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:07,532
Couldn't sleep. Just thinking.

396
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,170
How l nearly wiped out
the entire royal family?

397
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:15,638
l think they enjoyed it. lt's the first time
Princess Charlotte's taken a shine to anyone.

398
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:20,144
And no one will go near that dog since
it ate one of Lord Barret's testicles.

399
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:24,717
-Tragic.
-The real tragedy is, he's still reproducing.

400
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:31,722
Coco Pops. lnteresting choice.

401
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:36,192
-l had you down as an All-Bran man.
-These are strictly contraband.

402
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:39,492
Glynnis makes me eat that
other gravel every morning.

403
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:45,929
-Do you like Coco Pops?
-Dude, it's chocolate. Need l say more?

404
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:58,310
Did you mean what you said
about me staying for the summer?

405
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:00,613
Yes. Yes, l did.

406
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:04,018
So does that mean l'm gonna
be launched on society?

407
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:08,127
l suppose we ought to arrange
some sort of coming-out party for you.

408
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:12,026
Coming-out party? Coming out as what?

409
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:16,970
-As a young woman.
-What are you trying to say, Henry?

410
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:21,472
l just-- l mean as a young woman
of a certain...

411
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:25,203
...social standing and eligibility.

412
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:27,313
Eligibility? For what?

413
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:33,249
Well, for men--
l mean, for male suitors to....

414
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:41,519
-l'm not explaining this very well, am l?
-No. But l'm having fun watching you try.

415
00:39:41,695 --> 00:39:46,223
Yes, well, perhaps we ought to leave
the party arrangements to you.

416
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:50,766
lt's not my kind of thing,
but l'll think about it.

417
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,797
Thanks, Henry.

418
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:03,106
l was just wondering
whether your mother ever...?

419
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:11,915
-No. No, she never got married.
-No, but obviously there'd be....

420
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:14,823
There'd be somebody, you know....

421
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,108
Well, off to bed, l suppose.

422
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:38,512
l hope you find your sleeping arrangements
conducive to a good night's--

423
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,349
Henry? ''Sweet dreams'' is all it takes.

424
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,057
Right.

425
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,894
Well, sweet dreams.

426
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,961
Sweet dreams, Henry.

427
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:03,208
Morning, Henry!

428
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:07,672
-Off to work?
-l was just-- Well, yes.

429
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,912
Oh, that reminds me. We must
get a dress for you for Saturday.

430
00:41:12,086 --> 00:41:14,646
-What's on Saturday?
-The ball at the Orwoods' .

431
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:18,883
-Lots of hands to shake, l'm afraid.
-l can help Daphne find a dress.

432
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:25,388
We know that wouldn't be a good idea.
No, l found a gown at my designer's.

433
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:29,064
l've put it in your room, dear.
lt's utterly ravishing.

434
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:34,037
Excellent. Thank you. l'm counting on
you girls to give Daphne some pointers.

435
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,869
Bye, now.

436
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:49,819
Oh, very you. Lovely.

437
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:51,815
Thanks.

438
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:55,291
So Henry asked us to give you
some pointers, didn't he?

439
00:41:55,462 --> 00:41:58,727
Well, pointer number one, go home.

440
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:03,026
Mother and l belong here and it's
quite clear you just don't fit in.

441
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:05,434
And pointer two?
While you're packing...

442
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:10,543
...keep your grimy little Yankee paws
off Armistead Stuart.

443
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:13,612
-He's mine.
-lf you'd take your nose out of the air...

444
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,648
...you'd see you're designer,
l'm vintage.

445
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:19,342
You've got a mansion,
l have a five-floor walkup.

446
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,785
You're snotty Little Miss Cranky Pants
and l go with the flow.

447
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,984
So why would you ever think
that l'd ever have the same taste in guys?

448
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:31,063
So here's a little pointer for you.
Get over yourself.

449
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:36,135
And stop trying to be my daddy's
little girl, because l'm not going anywhere.

450
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:41,836
Bye.

451
00:42:47,948 --> 00:42:49,540
Pull!

452
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:57,517
Don't listen to that silly twit Clarissa.
She's just threatened by you, that's all.

453
00:42:57,691 --> 00:42:58,953
Pull!

454
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:06,692
-Why would she be threatened?
-Her mother is about to marry my son...

455
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:09,097
...and gain a title
and all that goes with it.

456
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,139
For years, Alistair tried to elevate his
position through my husband's career.

457
00:43:14,308 --> 00:43:16,742
Now he's got his claws into Henry.

458
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:20,641
People like Alistair and Glynnis,
social standing is everything.

459
00:43:20,814 --> 00:43:22,076
Pull!

460
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:29,880
lt's silly, but they live by it.
And l lived by it too, once.

461
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:34,656
Till l saw what a toll it took
on the people who l love most.

462
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:38,420
Believe me, there'll be plenty
of people rooting for you to fail.

463
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,695
That's what makes it such fun.

464
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,761
-Bring it on.
-Pull!

465
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,570
Oh, dear. ls that how
the West was won?

466
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:19,032
Lord Henry Dashwood. Miss Glynnis
Payne. Miss Clarissa Payne.

467
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:22,601
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Ashley.

468
00:44:22,776 --> 00:44:26,212
-Thank you very, very much.
-Thank you.

469
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,439
-Thanks.
-Who's next?

470
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:35,113
Lord and Lady Harrison Gordon.

471
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:38,983
Lord and Lady Jeffrey Charles.

472
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:45,321
Now, come along, Daphne. Deep breath
and remember the family motto.

473
00:44:45,499 --> 00:44:47,592
What's the family motto?

474
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:50,836
-What does that mean?
-lt means, ducky...

475
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:54,303
...hang in there and you'll rock!

476
00:44:54,475 --> 00:44:57,069
Lady Jocelyn Dashwood,
Countess of Wycombe.

477
00:44:57,244 --> 00:45:01,271
Lady Jocelyn Dashwood,
Countess of Wycombe.

478
00:45:04,985 --> 00:45:06,680
Miss Daphne Reynolds.

479
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:12,315
41 3 Mulberry Street,
Chinatown, New York.

480
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:23,331
-What has she done to that dress?
-Mother!

481
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:31,177
-Fantastic!
-Who designed the dress, Miss Reynolds?

482
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:33,472
Could you hold it on that step, please?

483
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,914
-Let's go.
-That wretched girl!

484
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:41,646
-Yummy.
-Can you look this side, please?

485
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,290
-That's right.
-Can l have another smile?

486
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:47,522
That's beautiful, Miss Reynolds.
This way. Lovely.

487
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:50,254
-Can we get a photograph?
-Excuse me, thank you.

488
00:45:50,431 --> 00:45:53,764
Thank you. That will be all, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

489
00:45:53,934 --> 00:45:58,371
l'm sorry about that. You're still
something of a novelty, l'm afraid.

490
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:02,403
-Are those the girls that are coming out?
-Yes, Peach and Pear Orwood.

491
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:06,307
-The daughters of Lord Orwood.
-Have you noticed the chandelier?

492
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,381
Chairman of my constituency party.

493
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,280
The real love of his life
is that chandelier.

494
00:46:12,453 --> 00:46:14,717
Don't let him catch you looking at it.

495
00:46:14,888 --> 00:46:17,413
You'll start his boring story
about how Napoleon...

496
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:20,321
...gave it to Josephine
at the Battle of Borodino.

497
00:46:20,494 --> 00:46:22,428
The story is longer than the battle.

498
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:26,589
Excuse me. l wonder if l might request
a dance from your gorgeous daughter?

499
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:29,998
l'm sure she'd be delighted.
Thank you, Armistead.

500
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:38,506
l can't believe that little imposter
is going to ruin my summer.

501
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:42,274
She may be a lot of things, but
l can't believe imposter is one.

502
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:44,917
Technically, she's 39th
in line to the throne.

503
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:50,352
Really, Fiona, 38 people would have
to die for her to be queen.

504
00:46:50,524 --> 00:46:54,551
Well, it's far less than
the 72 you'd need.

505
00:46:54,862 --> 00:47:00,391
Women are just drawn to me.
lt's something l happen to be blessed with.

506
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:06,563
An indefinable quality that just
relaxes them, fascinates them.

507
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,641
-You're feeling it, aren't you, Dabney?
-lt's Daphne.

508
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,111
And let me guess, you're feeling it
in my backside?

509
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,185
lan.

510
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:32,622
Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna take
a short break. See you in 1 0.

511
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:37,897
Warning: colonial strumpet alert.

512
00:48:38,298 --> 00:48:40,960
Hi, l'm Daphne Reynolds.
Peach and Pear, isn't it?

513
00:48:41,134 --> 00:48:43,659
-Are those your real names?
-Yes.

514
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:47,637
Pumpkin and Gourd would have
been much more appropriate.

515
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:50,743
-Our mother was obsessed with fruit.
-And vegetables.

516
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:55,143
-We have a sister called Parsnip.
-She doesn't get out much.

517
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:59,046
Let's bail. This party's a total bore.

518
00:48:59,486 --> 00:49:03,013
Don't listen to her, the party's hopping!

519
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:08,588
Excuse me for a second?

520
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:12,524
She is so nice.

521
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:21,332
-Henry, old chap.
-What a wonderful evening.

522
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:25,877
l'm glad you're enjoying yourself. l don't
know if you've noticed the chandelier.

523
00:49:26,313 --> 00:49:28,543
Actually, it's a rather fascinating story.

524
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:36,485
-Looking for me?
-Oh, no. l was just looking for the loo.

525
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:40,491
Outside? On the terrace?

526
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:45,292
All right, so you caught me.

527
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,662
So let me guess. You'll disappear again
without so much as a glass slipper?

528
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,575
This Cinderella's got a dad now.
She's not going anywhere.

529
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:02,115
-Your song was really beautiful.
-Thanks.

530
00:50:02,282 --> 00:50:07,481
lt's not gonna liven up this party,
though. Poor girls. l feel sorry for them.

531
00:50:07,654 --> 00:50:10,487
A dud like this will send them
back to social Siberia.

532
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:14,691
What do you say we liven things up
a little bit? Get the party started.

533
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:17,694
Well, first of all, l could get fired.

534
00:50:17,864 --> 00:50:20,992
-And second of all, l could get fired.
-Come on.

535
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:22,499
-No.
-Wimp.

536
00:50:22,669 --> 00:50:26,833
-No. No.
-For me?

537
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:31,671
Okay, let's do it.

538
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,582
-lnsufferable deprivation of this house....
-Okay, guys.

539
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:40,914
-One, two, three, four!
-l'm cranking up the bass!

540
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,321
What?

541
00:51:52,292 --> 00:51:54,726
What the devil is going on?
ls that girl yours?

542
00:51:55,095 --> 00:51:56,926
Yes. Yes, she is.

543
00:51:57,097 --> 00:52:03,036
What do l tell my daughters when they're
lying awake crying over their ruined ball?

544
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,953
No!

545
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:28,859
Oh, my precious!

546
00:52:33,633 --> 00:52:34,964
You!

547
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,400
We're going. Come on.

548
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,471
Lord Dashwood!

549
00:53:28,185 --> 00:53:30,153
This is ridiculous.

550
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:26,069
Have you seen the papers? lt's everywhere.
We have to do something.

551
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:31,673
l don't know anyone that isn't
relieved to see that go.

552
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:37,079
-What on Earth are you giving Henry?
-They're called Coco Pops, madam.

553
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:40,884
-Morning.
-Hardhat, anyone?

554
00:54:41,057 --> 00:54:45,050
You never know when something
sharp might fall from the sky.

555
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:48,859
-l'm most dreadfully sorry, miss.
-You idiot!

556
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:53,628
These are my best suede Pradas. Do you
have any idea how expensive they are?

557
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:02,644
l'm really sorry about last night.
l was just trying to help them out.

558
00:55:02,812 --> 00:55:04,905
Where did you find that revolting song?

559
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:08,050
James Brown, 1 976,
charted out at number 1 4.

560
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:14,556
l have no idea where that came from.

561
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:20,195
What?

562
00:55:21,364 --> 00:55:24,527
Gillian, darling. Yes, l'm sorry,
it's just an awful time.

563
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:42,313
What music did you listen to
when you were younger?

564
00:55:42,485 --> 00:55:46,046
-Back before the Earth's crust cooled?
-Favorite band of the '70s.

565
00:55:46,223 --> 00:55:47,747
Don't say the Bee Gees.

566
00:55:47,924 --> 00:55:50,825
-Don't say the Bee Gees.
-They were called Little Feat.

567
00:55:50,994 --> 00:55:54,122
And l saw them half a dozen times.
l remember they once--

568
00:55:54,297 --> 00:55:57,630
lt's 8:1 5 and you have an appointment
in Westminster at 9:1 5.

569
00:55:58,168 --> 00:56:00,932
Yes. Yes, you're right.

570
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:10,040
See you later.

571
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:15,650
Miss Daphne, Mr. Wallace
is here to see you.

572
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:18,413
Don't let him in,
l'm not even cute yet!

573
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:23,117
What am l gonna wear?

574
00:56:32,235 --> 00:56:34,931
Hello, sir. lan Wallace.

575
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:36,663
l'm here to pick up Daphne.

576
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:44,839
-How you doing?
-How do you do?

577
00:56:45,015 --> 00:56:46,414
Good.

578
00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:52,518
-Who are you?
-l'm a musician. l was at the ball last night.

579
00:56:53,857 --> 00:56:55,484
You were in the band?

580
00:56:57,427 --> 00:57:01,022
-Now you and Daphne are...?
-Eloping together? Yeah.

581
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:06,365
l realize it's a bit sudden, but after last
night, there really was no turning back.

582
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:11,530
-You're joking.
-Yes, sir.

583
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:18,776
-Don't wait up, Henry.
-See you.

584
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,340
-Wow.
-Okay.

585
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:26,785
-So, what we need's a little cheering up?
-Hold the ''little.''

586
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:28,253
Just leave it all to me.

587
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:36,129
You ready? Let's go!

588
00:58:02,859 --> 00:58:04,690
Oh, hey, you gotta try these.

589
00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:08,089
These are great kebabs.
Can we have two?

590
00:58:08,264 --> 00:58:10,391
-Nice. Thank you.
-Thanks.

591
00:58:11,234 --> 00:58:13,725
This is awesome!

592
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,378
l like these.

593
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,448
Oh, my God. l love these.

594
00:58:25,615 --> 00:58:29,073
Yeah. This place has always got
really nice stuff. That suits you.

595
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:30,514
-l'll get it.
-You sure?

596
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:32,712
lt's fine. Honestly.

597
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:35,052
-Wait, wait.
-What?

598
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:37,455
-This is so pretty.
-Yeah.

599
00:58:38,294 --> 00:58:40,057
-You like?
-Yeah, it's cool.

600
00:58:47,137 --> 00:58:49,571
Looks good. Yeah, l like it.

601
00:58:54,177 --> 00:58:56,475
-Thanks for my bracelets.
-lt's okay.

602
00:58:56,946 --> 00:59:01,246
-Today was really fun. l needed it.
-Good. Glad you're enjoying yourself.

603
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:07,080
-From now on l'm gonna behave.
-Behave like what, exactly?

604
00:59:07,257 --> 00:59:11,626
l don't know.
An impeccably brought up young lady.

605
00:59:11,795 --> 00:59:14,355
No more repeats of last night.

606
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:18,890
Okay. Well, l just chose you to help!

607
00:59:27,544 --> 00:59:31,776
Okay, that's it.
Now gently slide your foot back.

608
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:38,513
So much for gently. Hold this.

609
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:43,016
You gotta think grace.
You gotta think poise.

610
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,686
You gotta think balance.

611
00:59:47,397 --> 00:59:48,989
Observe.

612
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:52,262
Nice!

613
00:59:52,802 --> 00:59:56,932
So tell me, Obi-Wan, where did
you learn your impressive skills?

614
00:59:57,106 --> 01:00:00,906
Well, if you really want to know,
believe it or not...

615
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:04,639
-...my mother was a deb.
-Really?

616
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:08,477
Yeah, and then she chose
to marry beneath her.

617
01:00:08,651 --> 01:00:10,710
Her parents promptly disowned her.

618
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:14,789
But for some reason they took pity
on me, their half-breed grandson.

619
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:20,021
They paid for me to go to the right schools.
They got me into all the right clubs.

620
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:23,796
Until one day l realized
the hypocrisy of it all.

621
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,227
And your parents?

622
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:30,532
They're poor as church mice
and they're the happiest people l know.

623
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:35,072
Now, enough stalling. Get up there
and let me see you perform.

624
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:37,179
All right. All right.

625
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:42,045
Okay. Find your center.

626
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:46,816
Good. That's it.

627
01:00:47,757 --> 01:00:50,282
Okay. Now.

628
01:01:12,482 --> 01:01:15,144
You know what l still don't get?

629
01:01:15,685 --> 01:01:20,884
Why are you trying so hard to fit in
when you're born to stand out?

630
01:01:49,385 --> 01:01:51,319
<i>-Hello?
-Five hours ago your daughter...</i>

631
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:54,513
...rode off on a motorcycle
and hasn't been heard from since.

632
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:58,494
<i>-Are we talking about a date?
-I don't know, but I dread to think.</i>

633
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:00,458
The boy's in some sort of band!

634
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:04,660
Really? Cool. Let me guess,
he's a drummer.

635
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:07,102
<i>-This is serious.
-As I recall...</i>

636
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,603
...l spent a great deal of time
on the back of your motorbike.

637
01:02:10,773 --> 01:02:14,265
Yeah, well, l think
that's rather different.

638
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:18,670
Strange how easy it comes, isn't it?

639
01:02:19,616 --> 01:02:22,176
-What?
-Worrying.

640
01:02:24,153 --> 01:02:28,954
-Does it ever go away?
-No, Henry, it doesn't.

641
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:36,357
Henry! Henry!

642
01:02:36,532 --> 01:02:39,296
Libby, l'm sorry, l'm gonna have to run.

643
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:48,668
Darling, this really is important. l've just
had a conversation with a Bedouin translator.

644
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:52,747
Apparently there are certain drums
which indicate an actual marriage...

645
01:02:52,915 --> 01:02:56,646
...whereas others they just use
merely for mating rituals.

646
01:02:56,819 --> 01:03:00,653
-Have l just entered a parallel universe?
-Don't you see what this means?

647
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:04,350
lt's possible that you and Libby
never had a real wedding.

648
01:03:04,527 --> 01:03:07,894
So there's nothing to interfere
with our plans! ls there?

649
01:03:08,064 --> 01:03:10,931
lsn't that good news, Henry? Henry?

650
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,164
Here we go.

651
01:03:46,803 --> 01:03:48,270
Hang on a second.

652
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:54,340
-Hello, sir.
-lan. l had no idea you were so versatile.

653
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:58,378
Henry, come along, lots to do.
The assembled press are waiting.

654
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:00,015
Hi.

655
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:05,381
-Hey. What are you doing here?
-Another one of my glamorous jobs.

656
01:04:07,957 --> 01:04:11,051
-You look beautiful.
-Thanks.

657
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:14,025
-l have to be on my best behavior.
-You better be.

658
01:04:14,197 --> 01:04:18,793
-There's more reporters here than usual.
-They're waiting to see what l'll do next.

659
01:04:18,968 --> 01:04:23,064
Oh, yeah? You mean like kissing a guy
who parks cars?

660
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:27,509
Daphne, the press...

661
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:32,808
-...want a photo of you and your father.
-Thanks. l'll find him.

662
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:34,814
See you.

663
01:04:34,984 --> 01:04:37,817
Stay away from her, peasant.
She's out of your league.

664
01:04:37,987 --> 01:04:41,787
What's the matter? Thought our competition
ended in lower school.

665
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,756
Afraid she might prefer musicians
to Cambridge boys?

666
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:48,454
No. Breeding always
wins out in the end.

667
01:04:50,967 --> 01:04:53,765
ls Miss Reynolds enjoying
her time in London?

668
01:04:54,003 --> 01:04:56,938
-Very much.
-Lord Dashwood, how's the campaign?

669
01:04:57,106 --> 01:04:59,666
Miss Reynolds, tell us
about the chandelier.

670
01:04:59,842 --> 01:05:01,173
Maybe that's enough.

671
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:03,005
Thank you, no more now.

672
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:06,940
-Do you think he's terribly rich?
-l imagine so.

673
01:05:07,116 --> 01:05:09,448
-l hope so.
-Peach?

674
01:05:09,652 --> 01:05:12,951
Pear? You look...

675
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:16,854
-...different.
-lt's Daphne.

676
01:05:17,026 --> 01:05:22,157
-She gave us some styling tips.
-Why would you want tips from her?

677
01:05:28,371 --> 01:05:29,804
Lovely.

678
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:31,837
-Charming here.
-lsn't it just?

679
01:05:49,258 --> 01:05:51,317
The race is that way.

680
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:54,122
Aren't you supposed
to be escorting Clarissa?

681
01:05:54,297 --> 01:05:57,892
What? And leave you
to fend for yourself?

682
01:05:58,634 --> 01:06:01,831
Or are you suffering
from the romantic delusion...

683
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:05,440
...that some non-talent commoner
will do it for you?

684
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:10,511
You know, l really wish you'd pull
your lip over your head and swallow it.

685
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:17,909
Despite myself, l find your Yankee
vulgarity intensely attractive.

686
01:06:18,087 --> 01:06:20,920
So forget about the car parking,
mixed-race mongrel...

687
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:25,686
...and give me that kiss you've been
longing to give me since we first met.

688
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:27,295
You're right.

689
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:30,091
l have been longing to do this.

690
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:49,815
Henry, do something!

691
01:06:52,388 --> 01:06:53,946
You should have hit him!

692
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:57,782
Don't you ever pucker your lips
at me, you arrogant jerk!

693
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,623
And how dare you insult lan?!
He's twice the man you'll ever be!

694
01:07:09,772 --> 01:07:13,538
-Henry. Henry.
-Out of the way. Get out of the way.

695
01:07:13,809 --> 01:07:15,834
What was the argument about?

696
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:25,410
-Give me the keys to your bike! Quick!
-Here you go.

697
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,824
What's going on?

698
01:07:29,992 --> 01:07:32,119
You do know how to drive--

699
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:34,791
Look out!

700
01:07:37,533 --> 01:07:39,558
Oh, sorry.

701
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:09,492
That is without doubt the most
indecorous thing l have done in years.

702
01:08:09,665 --> 01:08:13,226
Well, l have no idea
what you're talking about, but l'm glad.

703
01:08:13,602 --> 01:08:15,194
You should do it more often.

704
01:08:15,371 --> 01:08:18,238
l don't even remember
the last time l went barefoot.

705
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:22,143
Don't you just love squidging
your toes in the sand?

706
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:24,506
Did you know it's a natural exfoliant?

707
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:29,140
Mom says if you can walk on a beach and
you got a steady hand with nail polish...

708
01:08:29,318 --> 01:08:32,685
...there's no reason to ever pay
for a pedicure.

709
01:08:32,955 --> 01:08:36,391
-You talk just like her, you know.
-As in too much?

710
01:08:39,228 --> 01:08:41,025
ls she happy?

711
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:50,229
Yeah, l think so. l mean, l can tell
she gets lonely sometimes...

712
01:08:50,806 --> 01:08:54,139
...but l think she's pretty content
with who she is.

713
01:08:57,146 --> 01:09:01,776
-l like that about her.
-l wish l were more like that.

714
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:07,684
So, what next?

715
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:11,423
-No!
-Yes!

716
01:09:11,594 --> 01:09:15,860
-No. No, absolutely not.
-lt's this or that.

717
01:09:18,934 --> 01:09:21,232
l think we'll do this one.

718
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,966
How're you doing?

719
01:09:28,044 --> 01:09:29,807
Henry?

720
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:32,547
That doesn't sound pleasant.

721
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:37,345
-What do you think?
-lt's just henna.

722
01:10:08,217 --> 01:10:10,447
-What's this?
-l told you how groovy l was?

723
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:13,452
-Yeah.
-And l used to like people like this guy.

724
01:10:14,023 --> 01:10:17,151
Oh, look. This stuff is good.

725
01:10:17,326 --> 01:10:20,193
l've been looking for Coo Coo Ow!
Strange, funky sounds.

726
01:10:20,362 --> 01:10:22,990
l remember them. ''Doris.''

727
01:10:36,812 --> 01:10:39,178
-Come on, Henry.
-l'm not gonna head bang.

728
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:42,317
-You just bang your head.
-Don't do that. No.

729
01:10:42,485 --> 01:10:46,148
-Nod!
-l'm not gonna do that. All right. Let's go.

730
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:34,630
l was just-- l wanted
to see if they still fit.

731
01:11:35,204 --> 01:11:37,832
Well, they seem fine.

732
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:44,008
Who are you? What have you
done with my fiancé?

733
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,614
l want my Henry back.

734
01:11:57,927 --> 01:11:59,622
-Lord Dashwood.
-Lord Dashwood.

735
01:11:59,795 --> 01:12:02,127
You've dropped 1 5 points in the polls.

736
01:12:02,298 --> 01:12:04,562
-Are you worried?
-l really can't comment.

737
01:12:04,733 --> 01:12:09,102
lf you can't handle your own child,
how can you handle the government?

738
01:12:10,406 --> 01:12:14,866
-Frank, good to see you.
-Could you answer, please?

739
01:12:16,645 --> 01:12:18,636
-How much time do we have?
-Plenty.

740
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:21,146
Your first two clients
were no-shows and...

741
01:12:21,317 --> 01:12:24,718
...you got out of your speech
at the Children's Education Center.

742
01:12:24,887 --> 01:12:29,449
-Why would we have canceled that speech?
-We didn't. They did.

743
01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:58,253
Daphne, can l have a word?

744
01:12:59,288 --> 01:13:04,487
This is Brigadier Sir Roderick Dashwood.
He lost an eye at the Battle of the Boyne.

745
01:13:06,028 --> 01:13:09,429
And over here we have Field Marshal
Bingley Dashwood.

746
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,998
He lost his arm
at the Battle of the Nile.

747
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:19,105
And Uncle Alfred never spoke about what
he lost, but you'd rarely find him sitting.

748
01:13:19,975 --> 01:13:23,775
l lost my tonsils.
Does that mean l qualify?

749
01:13:25,414 --> 01:13:27,075
Listen, Daphne.

750
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:32,812
Part of the burden of being a member
of this family is that there are certain...

751
01:13:32,988 --> 01:13:36,856
...codes of behavior
that one is expected to observe.

752
01:13:37,826 --> 01:13:41,023
And if one is not seen
to conform, then....

753
01:13:42,197 --> 01:13:44,188
Well, then it becomes....

754
01:13:46,101 --> 01:13:50,333
Listen, l've very much enjoyed
our time together.

755
01:13:50,906 --> 01:13:54,137
Really and truly. lt's just that this....

756
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:58,246
These are very difficult circumstances...

757
01:14:00,182 --> 01:14:03,583
...and you, as my daughter,
have to....

758
01:14:04,353 --> 01:14:05,877
l have to change.

759
01:14:07,556 --> 01:14:09,717
lt's okay, l get it.

760
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,197
-l'm.... l'm a Dashwood too, right?
-Yes.

761
01:14:17,466 --> 01:14:19,093
Yes, you are.

762
01:14:34,049 --> 01:14:39,544
What are you looking at?
l can do it.

763
01:16:12,247 --> 01:16:14,772
Not wearing that
to The Strokes concert, are you?

764
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:17,714
Oh, my God, l totally forgot!

765
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:21,152
-Things have been so hectic.
-That's okay.

766
01:16:21,323 --> 01:16:23,951
l'll wait for you to get changed.

767
01:16:24,393 --> 01:16:27,954
l can't go. We're going
to the queen's garden party.

768
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:32,000
-Yeah, but....
-l'm sorry.

769
01:16:33,735 --> 01:16:35,202
Cool.

770
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:40,005
Just call me when Daphne
re-inhabits your body.

771
01:17:00,028 --> 01:17:05,432
-And this is Miss Daphne Reynolds.
-Oh, Daphne.

772
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:08,327
Nice girl.

773
01:17:09,638 --> 01:17:14,041
l gather Her Majesty's accepted
an invitation to Daphne's ball.

774
01:17:14,209 --> 01:17:18,578
She's come a long way, l must say.
You must be very proud of her.

775
01:17:27,155 --> 01:17:28,782
No.

776
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:44,070
This is the tiara that l wore
at my own coming-out party.

777
01:17:44,706 --> 01:17:48,164
Clarissa's had her beady eye
on it for months.

778
01:17:48,343 --> 01:17:50,811
But l want you to have it.

779
01:17:59,454 --> 01:18:03,481
-So royal.
-l hope it makes you feel like a princess.

780
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:08,989
But you know, my dear,
it's not the crown that makes the queen.

781
01:18:10,165 --> 01:18:12,065
lt's what's in here.

782
01:18:28,984 --> 01:18:32,545
-Hello.
-Ladies.

783
01:18:37,192 --> 01:18:38,819
Well, yes, of course.

784
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:55,475
Here she comes.

785
01:19:37,786 --> 01:19:39,515
Daphne.

786
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:43,482
-You look....
-Different?

787
01:20:11,887 --> 01:20:14,549
-Can we talk for a sec?
-lt's your party.

788
01:20:14,723 --> 01:20:18,056
-You can do whatever you want.
-lan.

789
01:20:18,226 --> 01:20:21,320
-l really didn't--
-l don't want to hear about it, Daph.

790
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:25,928
What happened to the old you?
The real you?

791
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:33,303
Okay, lads, let's pick up the tempo.

792
01:20:46,788 --> 01:20:48,551
Mom!

793
01:20:53,395 --> 01:20:54,657
What are you doing here?

794
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:58,630
Jocelyn thought you might need a pal
while being fed to the sharks.

795
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,462
Oh, honey, you look so beautiful.

796
01:21:01,636 --> 01:21:04,298
Look at you, Mom!

797
01:21:05,173 --> 01:21:07,641
Are you actually wearing a bra?

798
01:21:15,383 --> 01:21:16,941
Come on.

799
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:25,893
Hello, Henry.

800
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:28,721
Libby.

801
01:21:30,499 --> 01:21:36,495
-Hello, Lucy. l'm Glynnis, Henry's fiancée.
-lt's Libby, actually. And congratulations.

802
01:21:36,938 --> 01:21:42,205
Well, what a lovely surprise.
l see you've come with no escort.

803
01:21:42,377 --> 01:21:46,177
Henry, you must find somebody divine
for Lubby here to dance with.

804
01:21:46,348 --> 01:21:48,646
Libby. Remember?

805
01:21:49,951 --> 01:21:53,182
And why doesn't he just
ask her himself?

806
01:22:39,367 --> 01:22:43,770
This is fantastic. Everyone important
has accepted their invitation.

807
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:48,573
-We've got the election in the bag.
-How can you be so calm?

808
01:22:48,743 --> 01:22:53,043
Her Majesty is due any moment and your
candidate is dancing with that woman.

809
01:22:53,215 --> 01:22:54,807
Henry knows what's at stake.

810
01:22:54,983 --> 01:22:58,783
Besides, look what he did with Daphne.
Quite an achievement.

811
01:22:58,954 --> 01:23:02,549
l thought l was going to have to get rid
of her, like her mother, but--

812
01:23:02,724 --> 01:23:04,123
What did you just say?

813
01:23:04,292 --> 01:23:06,226
Nothing.

814
01:23:06,394 --> 01:23:09,625
-Did you say you got rid of my mother?
-Figure of speech.

815
01:23:10,732 --> 01:23:14,691
-Are you the one that made her leave?
-Daphne, darling, now is not the time.

816
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:19,136
-Come on now, don't linger!
-Hey, but-- Glynnis!

817
01:23:19,307 --> 01:23:22,333
-How dare he!
-Come on.

818
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:24,842
-Come on!
-Glynnis, let go!

819
01:23:25,013 --> 01:23:28,176
-Get in here!
-Glynnis! Let go!

820
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:30,250
Get in here!

821
01:23:30,752 --> 01:23:33,744
Glynnis! Glynnis!
Glynnis!

822
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:43,263
Remember the ritual dances?

823
01:23:43,431 --> 01:23:46,457
You were so bad
they're still blaming you for the locusts.

824
01:23:46,635 --> 01:23:50,799
-l recall your frock nearly got us arrested.
-l had you translate my apology.

825
01:23:50,972 --> 01:23:54,772
-Which was something of a risk, l thought.
-l know it. You could've been...

826
01:23:54,943 --> 01:23:57,741
-...trading me in for a goat.
-Camel, actually.

827
01:23:57,913 --> 01:24:00,313
Which never came through,
by the way.

828
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,676
l had faith in you, Henry.

829
01:24:06,254 --> 01:24:08,381
Just not enough?

830
01:24:08,556 --> 01:24:11,684
You didn't say goodbye.
You just disappeared.

831
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:15,421
-lt was what you wanted.
-What l wanted?

832
01:24:15,597 --> 01:24:19,795
-What l wanted was to be given a chance.
-You have had 1 7 years of chances, Henry...

833
01:24:19,968 --> 01:24:24,701
...and l've had 1 7 years
of waiting for you to take them.

834
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,705
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

835
01:24:30,879 --> 01:24:34,781
...the traditional father-daughter dance.
Lord Dashwood?

836
01:24:39,721 --> 01:24:41,211
Please!

837
01:24:42,023 --> 01:24:43,320
Help!

838
01:24:43,925 --> 01:24:45,517
-Where is Daphne?
-l'll find her.

839
01:24:45,694 --> 01:24:48,822
Oh, no.
Has Daphne gone missing again?

840
01:24:50,598 --> 01:24:53,624
Maybe Clarissa can step in.
You wouldn't mind, would you?

841
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:56,293
No. l'm almost your daughter
now too.

842
01:24:58,473 --> 01:25:00,441
Well, l'd....

843
01:25:10,018 --> 01:25:11,679
-Help! Someone!
-Daphne?

844
01:25:11,853 --> 01:25:14,048
l can't miss
my own father-daughter dance!

845
01:25:14,222 --> 01:25:15,849
-Honey?
-Help!

846
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:32,728
-How dare you, Glynnis? How dare you!
-We don't want a scene, do we?

847
01:25:32,907 --> 01:25:37,469
Take your hand off my daughter or you won't
get a scene, you'll get a Broadway musical.

848
01:25:55,797 --> 01:25:57,526
-Daphne....
-What are you doing?

849
01:25:58,033 --> 01:26:01,093
Finally giving you what you deserve.

850
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,571
Go ahead.

851
01:26:09,277 --> 01:26:11,006
l don't want it.

852
01:26:12,614 --> 01:26:14,081
Any of it.

853
01:26:33,201 --> 01:26:34,691
Daphne!

854
01:26:35,103 --> 01:26:36,593
Daphne!

855
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,000
-Wait.
-No.

856
01:26:43,845 --> 01:26:46,541
l'm done waiting, Henry.

857
01:26:54,289 --> 01:27:00,057
You know, when l was little, every birthday
l'd get all dressed up and l'd wish...

858
01:27:00,562 --> 01:27:05,966
...that if l was good enough,
you'd come and find me.

859
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:13,707
And now here l am, in the most beautiful
dress l could ever imagine...

860
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:17,144
...and you're here.

861
01:27:18,947 --> 01:27:23,816
You know what l miss now?
l miss being me.

862
01:27:25,386 --> 01:27:28,287
l finally realized that that is enough.

863
01:27:34,129 --> 01:27:36,563
You know, Daphne....

864
01:27:38,032 --> 01:27:43,834
Maybe we're just trying
to make something work here which isn't.

865
01:27:44,005 --> 01:27:48,908
Pray be upstanding
for Her Majesty, the queen.

866
01:28:03,391 --> 01:28:05,518
Go ahead.

867
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:07,651
Duty calls.

868
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,427
Come on, honey.

869
01:30:22,897 --> 01:30:26,060
-Lord Dashwood! What is your priority?
-Thank you very much.

870
01:30:26,234 --> 01:30:29,169
-The election or your daughter?
-l have no comment.

871
01:30:37,512 --> 01:30:40,845
-Couldn't you sleep either?
-No.

872
01:30:42,884 --> 01:30:45,478
Made a bit of a mess of things,
haven't l?

873
01:30:45,653 --> 01:30:47,177
A bit.

874
01:30:48,756 --> 01:30:53,216
Henry, for six centuries this family
has been sacrificing bits of itself for England.

875
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:58,730
Arms, legs, eyes. The battlefields of Europe
are littered with them.

876
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,767
Don't follow in that glorious tradition.

877
01:31:04,472 --> 01:31:07,373
You know what you're going
to sacrifice?

878
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:12,272
Your heart, Henry.

879
01:31:46,414 --> 01:31:47,904
Sir Charles.

880
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:03,057
Thank you.

881
01:32:04,465 --> 01:32:05,591
Thank you.

882
01:32:08,035 --> 01:32:09,764
Thank you.

883
01:32:11,606 --> 01:32:13,198
Thank you.

884
01:32:13,374 --> 01:32:15,706
Well, over the last few weeks,
l've certainly...

885
01:32:15,877 --> 01:32:19,836
...received more support and encouragement
from this constituency...

886
01:32:20,014 --> 01:32:24,917
...than l'd ever dared hoped for. So l'd like
to take this opportunity to thank you all.

887
01:32:27,288 --> 01:32:33,591
You may have noticed that recently there
have been one or two remarks in the press.

888
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:36,161
Regarding my behavior.

889
01:32:36,798 --> 01:32:41,326
lt's been suggested l've not been conducting
myself in a manner befitting an MP.

890
01:32:42,837 --> 01:32:46,295
Well, l've been giving my priorities
a great deal of thought...

891
01:32:46,808 --> 01:32:50,608
...and l've decided that it's time
to get them straight.

892
01:32:50,778 --> 01:32:54,544
Which is why l must now respectfully
withdraw my candidacy.

893
01:32:59,854 --> 01:33:05,258
Representing you would undoubtedly
be the greatest honor of my political life.

894
01:33:05,693 --> 01:33:11,029
lt would simply be impossible to do so
if l'm not serving my own conscience.

895
01:33:12,366 --> 01:33:13,856
See...

896
01:33:18,906 --> 01:33:20,806
...l've changed.

897
01:33:27,515 --> 01:33:31,747
And as important
as my political aspirations are to me...

898
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:35,214
...there is one thing
that matters more.

899
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,661
Thank you.

900
01:34:09,957 --> 01:34:11,447
Are you out of your mind?

901
01:34:12,026 --> 01:34:14,790
l have done everything
to get you to this position...

902
01:34:14,962 --> 01:34:17,123
...and l will not let you
throw it all away!

903
01:34:17,298 --> 01:34:19,562
You've lied to me,
l know you lied to Libby...

904
01:34:19,734 --> 01:34:22,862
...so forgive me if l don't give
a flying fart what you think.

905
01:34:23,037 --> 01:34:26,097
Libby? l stopped you
from ruining your life!

906
01:34:26,274 --> 01:34:28,868
l saved your family's reputation!

907
01:34:29,043 --> 01:34:33,104
When l found out that girl was pregnant,
l knew l was doing the right thing.

908
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:38,808
-You knew about Daphne?
-Of course l knew! lt's my job to know!

909
01:34:41,756 --> 01:34:43,747
-Grandpa! Are you okay?
-Oh, God.

910
01:34:44,258 --> 01:34:46,055
-This is horrible.
-Do shut up!

911
01:34:47,528 --> 01:34:51,828
Henry, darling! l know Daddy's been naughty,
but what about me?

912
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,763
You'll survive.

913
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:16,720
Hey. Table six is screaming for coffee.
What're you doing, anyway?

914
01:35:16,891 --> 01:35:19,792
Sorry, it's my college applications.
Due on Monday.

915
01:35:19,961 --> 01:35:22,088
Okay, l'll cover for you.

916
01:35:22,263 --> 01:35:24,788
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

917
01:35:30,004 --> 01:35:34,805
Ladies and gentlemen, the bride
would like to share a dance with her father.

918
01:35:35,977 --> 01:35:37,911
l love you, Dad.

919
01:36:32,867 --> 01:36:36,769
-What are you doing here?
-l just came because l....

920
01:36:37,505 --> 01:36:42,169
l had something very important
to say to you...

921
01:36:42,343 --> 01:36:46,439
...and l hope l can.... Actually,
l wrote it all down on the plane about....

922
01:36:48,282 --> 01:36:50,773
About 200 times, as you....

923
01:36:54,588 --> 01:36:57,421
lt was on a....
l have it....

924
01:36:57,591 --> 01:37:00,685
What it comes down to is....

925
01:37:02,196 --> 01:37:04,528
ls that l love you, Daphne.

926
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:08,260
l love you.
l'm so sorry.

927
01:37:08,436 --> 01:37:12,964
l wouldn't change you, anything about you.
l wouldn't change one hair on your head.

928
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:16,906
-Not for anything--
-l love you, Dad. l love you!

929
01:37:36,097 --> 01:37:37,689
Might l....

930
01:37:38,432 --> 01:37:40,900
Might l have the honor of this dance?

931
01:38:21,675 --> 01:38:24,269
Listen, Daphne, l....

932
01:38:25,012 --> 01:38:29,415
l just think when you're groveling
it's important to bring a very large present.

933
01:38:29,917 --> 01:38:32,715
-l don't understand.
-May l cut in?

934
01:38:32,887 --> 01:38:34,445
Of course.

935
01:38:37,391 --> 01:38:39,586
l tried to call you....

936
01:38:51,672 --> 01:38:54,800
You never did want me to go,
did you?

937
01:38:54,975 --> 01:38:57,466
There never was anyone else,
was there?

938
01:38:59,713 --> 01:39:02,807
l'd say l owe you
a rather large apology.

939
01:39:03,984 --> 01:39:07,476
You think l've waited 1 7 years
for an apology?

940
01:39:17,364 --> 01:39:20,765
<i>So I finally got my father-daughter dance.</i>

941
01:39:20,935 --> 01:39:24,371
<i>Of course, it got interrupted
when my boyfriend showed up.</i>

942
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:27,769
<i>And then my parents started making out.</i>

943
01:39:32,613 --> 01:39:37,346
<i>But sometimes things aren't exactly
how you always imagined.</i>

944
01:39:37,718 --> 01:39:39,845
<i>They're even better.</i>

945
01:39:53,334 --> 01:39:57,395
<i>Oh, just in case you were wondering
what happened to Clarissa and Glynnis...</i>

946
01:39:57,571 --> 01:40:02,201
<i>...don't worry.
They ended up exactly as they should.</i>

947
01:40:04,278 --> 01:40:07,247
--the rustication, then it gets smoother--

948
01:40:07,414 --> 01:40:09,041
<i>-Big Ben.
-So did Alistair.</i>

949
01:40:09,216 --> 01:40:12,276
l can see the smiles.
For those of you who speak English...

950
01:40:12,453 --> 01:40:15,752
...it's not the name of a large hamburger
at a fast food restaurant.

951
01:40:15,923 --> 01:40:18,153
<i>This is the closest he got
to Parliament.</i>

952
01:40:19,827 --> 01:40:25,322
<i>My parents got married again.
This time, it was legal.</i>

953
01:40:25,499 --> 01:40:27,194
<i>I think.</i>

954
01:40:30,537 --> 01:40:33,301
<i>As for me, I didn't end up at NYU.</i>

955
01:40:33,474 --> 01:40:38,605
<i>But before you get too disappointed,
I did get into Oxford.</i>

956
01:40:38,946 --> 01:40:43,542
<i>What can I say?
Like father, like daughter.</i>

957
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:49,786
<i>It was my own happily ever after.</i>
