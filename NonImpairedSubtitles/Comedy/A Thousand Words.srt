00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A THOUSAND WORDS (2012)

2
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,562
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

3
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:36,068
<i>what you're listening to
is not the sound of my voice.</i>

4
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:41,198
<i>It's the sound of my inner voice,
the one inside my head.</i>

5
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,309
<i>I'd like to talk to you, but I can't.</i>

6
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,612
<i>Because if I say
just one more sentence out loud,</i>

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,382
<i>I'll die.</i>

8
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,673
<i>Aaron, I have got
a very important assignment for you.</i>

9
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,270
<i>Go to Barneys and get me six dozen
pair of cashmere blend socks,</i>

10
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,745
<i>No, I'm going to wear 'em,
but you're going to buy 'em.</i>

11
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,978
<i>Do I need six dozen pair
of cashmere socks? No, but listen.</i>

12
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,043
<i>Hey, "need" is a tricky word.</i>

13
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,147
<i>Think about it more like this,
"want" or "love" are better words.</i>

14
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,782
Think about it.
Don't we do everything out of love?

15
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,056
<i>How about this?
Do you want, need or love your job?</i>

16
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:39,394
<i>Well, I love the idea
that you need your job. Okay.</i>

17
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,897
Three white witches watch
three Swatch watches.

18
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,459
Which witches watch
which watch switch...

19
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,463
Okay.

20
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,804
Daddy's going to hold you
'cause Mommy needs caffeine.

21
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,575
<i>Baby, I don't know
if I can work with, "Whaah!"</i>

22
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,777
<i>Oh, look how happy he is
with his mommy.</i>

23
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,614
<i>- Yeah.
- Yes, he is. He's a mama's boy.</i>

24
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,675
<i>- No, he isn't.
- Yes.</i>

25
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,948
There's nothing wrong with being
a mama's boy. I'm a mama's boy.

26
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,580
<i>- Oh, my God!
- What?</i>

27
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,826
Shaq snuck in the house
and shit in the baby's diaper!

28
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:08,883
Hey!

29
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,796
<i>Excuse me, you think
maybe I could cut in front...</i>

30
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,207
I will run you over dead
in the parking lot.

31
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,276
Dead. Dead. Dead.

32
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:37,749
Hello?

33
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,683
What? She's in labour?

34
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,325
<i>Well, tell her to stop pushing!</i>

35
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,056
<i>Look, I can't miss
the birth of my first child!</i>

36
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,461
I only went out to get some coffee!

37
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,898
Go ahead.
Expectant father coming through!

38
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,161
I got a baby on the way! Thank you.
Thank you!

39
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,259
<i>Congratulations, man! You're the man!</i>

40
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,531
Thank you so much!
Thank you so much.

41
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,505
Twins? It's twins!

42
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,805
I'm having twins. I'm having twins.

43
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,937
Thank you. It's on the house?
Thank you so much!

44
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,482
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Congratulations!

45
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,977
We live in a world
that's obsessive and controlling.

46
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,248
<i>I think I care too much. I think
that's what you would say about me,</i>

47
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,380
that I care too much.

48
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:14,449
<i>I think that's what everybody would say
about me, that I care too much.</i>

49
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,222
This coffee's incredible.
Do you ever stop to think about

50
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,025
what people are thinking about
when you're not in the room?

51
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,189
What do people think
when I'm not there?

52
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,391
That's the thought that I want to know.

53
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,831
What do people think
when I'm not there?

54
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,265
<i>I know you think something
when I'm there,</i>

55
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,826
<i>but when I'm not there,
what are you thinking?</i>

56
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:25,996
What are you thinking
when I'm not in the room?

57
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,370
That's the real thought. Or do you ever
wonder who's on line with you?

58
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,807
You could be on line with somebody.
I'm not talking about the computer.

59
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,310
<i>I'm talking about the real line,
the real line,</i>

60
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,074
<i>the old-fashioned line with somebody
behind you, somebody in front of you.</i>

61
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,139
That line is dangerous
'cause you don't know who that is.

62
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,206
Or an elevator!

63
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,650
<i>You're in a elevator, door closed,
you're in the room with this person.</i>

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,188
They could pull out a knife
and start doing all kinds of shit to you.

65
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,383
You get in elevators all the time.
Elevators are crazy.

66
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,753
<i>Hey, what about restaurants?</i>

67
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,818
You could be in a restaurant
sitting next to somebody who's a maniac

68
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,023
<i>and they're right next to you in a chair,
and they're ordering like the same thing.</i>

69
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,557
<i>Look at you smiling and this person just,
you know, stabbed somebody in the ass</i>

70
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,967
and now they sitting
next to the table next to you.

71
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,231
This could be happening all the time.

72
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,398
Jack! If I may...

73
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,635
<i>Hey, Doc,
I think we're about out of time.</i>

74
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,802
But I feel so much better.

75
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,809
<i>Thank you so much.
You know, you're a genius.</i>

76
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,877
<i>Good morning, Mr. McCall.</i>

77
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,214
I don't mean to be pushy
and I know you get hit up all the time.

78
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,450
I was just wondering if you had
a chance to read my manuscript.

79
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,049
Your manuscript?

80
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,458
<i>Hey, Reverend Marcus.
How's my favourite client?</i>

81
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,463
<i>I just need to know if I'm going home
to Nebraska, work on my dad's farm,</i>

82
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,328
<i>or, you know,
maybe you could just read 20 pages.</i>

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,800
<i>Hold on one second. Hey, look,
I'm getting closer on your manuscript.</i>

84
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,393
<i>It's moved from my kitchen table
to my nightstand,</i>

85
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,769
<i>and next, it'll be by my toilet
and that's where it'll get read, okay?</i>

86
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
<i>Reverend, two words, "gripping"
and "necessary". Hold on one sec.</i>

87
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,435
<i>Hey, can you do me a favour?</i>

88
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,772
Can you polish my rims for me?

89
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,143
And don't park my car
under the trees with all those birds?

90
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,705
<i>Reverend, Lord, Where's My Money?
Is the best thing you've ever written.</i>

91
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,275
<i>Jack McCall's office, please hold.</i>

92
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,519
<i>Jack McCall's office, please hold.</i>

93
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,087
<i>Jack McCall's office, please hold.</i>

94
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,626
<i>You're already holding?
Okay, continue to hold. Thanks.</i>

95
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,322
Jack McCall's office.

96
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,897
<i>I don't care. Just take him to the vet.
I don't know, Mom!</i>

97
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,490
<i>I don't... Mom, I got to go.</i>

98
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,194
<i>Yes, I did have a great weekend.</i>

99
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,134
<i>And, yes, I would like some coffee.</i>

100
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,296
<i>I look good, right?</i>

101
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,172
I finished picking out all the
mini-marshmallows out of your cereal.

102
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,264
All the mini-marshmallows?

103
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,834
<i>Except the yellow moons, obviously.</i>

104
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,906
Mr. McCall?

105
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,641
I know that I'm just an assistant.
And I really appreciate...

106
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,049
<i>Hey, Aaron, this is my office.</i>

107
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,883
<i>This isn't the confessional booth
at MTV, all right?</i>

108
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:27,324
<i>No, no, I know. I know.
I would never confess. I'm just...</i>

109
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,226
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that if I'm going to

110
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,858
<i>be an agent one day,
I'm not really sure how this...</i>

111
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,094
<i>You have to speak like me,
talk like me, study me!</i>

112
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,602
<i>Learn to speak your mind,
but do it quickly.</i>

113
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,365
<i>You have to remember,
this is all part of your training.</i>

114
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,773
<i>Okay. Okay, great.
I almost forgot. The weekend read.</i>

115
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,972
<i>If I do say so myself,</i>

116
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,879
I thought that the Antarctica submission
was pretty good. Have you read it?

117
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,607
Absolutely not. Why would I do that?

118
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,083
Let me explain something to you.

119
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,780
All your best books have everything
you need to know in the first five pages

120
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,823
<i>and the last five pages, okay?</i>

121
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,482
Here we go. Woman meets man.

122
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,117
Pregnant. War. Alone.

123
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,024
War over. Baby older. New man.

124
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,656
Happily ever after. Bestseller.

125
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,855
Wow.

126
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,128
Did you prepare the conference room?

127
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,897
<i>Yeah. PowerPoint's all set up,
nobody knows a thing.</i>

128
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,033
<i>Okay. Well, get out of here.</i>

129
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,575
Everyone here is familiar with Dr. Sinja.

130
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,569
Dr. Sinja is the most popular

131
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,840
nondenominational religious leader
on the planet.

132
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,477
He's a holistic healer
and a New Age dispenser of wisdom

133
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,612
with a following in the tens of millions.

134
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,749
This guy can fill up
a football stadium on a Tuesday.

135
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,322
<i>Our conventional spirit guides
always ask the seeker,</i>

136
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,795
<i>"What do you want?"</i>

137
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,094
<i>I challenge you to ask yourself,</i>

138
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,133
<i>"What does life want from me?"</i>

139
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:49,697
<i>"What does the greater purpose
want from me?"</i>

140
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,336
Look at this guy's attendance figures.

141
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,210
<i>He's outselling Celine Dion, U2,</i>

142
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,579
Billy Graham and Hannah Montana!

143
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,615
What's his actual philosophy?

144
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,220
<i>"In quiet, there is truth. "
Some shit like that. Something like that.</i>

145
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,656
Just your typical New Age bullshit crap.

146
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,286
That's what my Aunt May used to call it.
New Age bullshit crap.

147
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,531
<i>And if anybody can sell
some New Age bullshit crap, it's me.</i>

148
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,623
<i>Jack, it's a spiritual movement.</i>

149
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,429
<i>Yeah, I have a spiritual movement
every time I eat a bran muffin.</i>

150
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,837
<i>- God!
- All right, all right, Jack.</i>

151
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,306
<i>Assuming you can actually
get an audience with the guy,</i>

152
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,502
you're not the only agent in town
who has this information.

153
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,011
What makes you think
you can talk Sinja into signing with you?

154
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,109
I'm Jack McCall. This is what I do.

155
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,346
<i>Hey, I can talk anybody
into doing anything.</i>

156
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,782
<i>Help me sing it</i>

157
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,983
Breathe in.

158
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,493
And release.

159
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:22,630
Quiet your mind
until there are no thoughts.

160
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,536
Then you can see your true nature.

161
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,064
Your face
before your parents were born.

162
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,170
"Your face
before your parents were born"?

163
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,509
That's a great title for a kids' show.

164
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,808
It has many names.

165
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,683
<i>Nirvana, kensho, bliss,</i>

166
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,850
<i>divinity, illumination.
Let's call it the Blue Pearl.</i>

167
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,295
It's okay. Our truth can be painful.

168
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,130
Pain is the touchstone of growth.

169
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,528
- That'd be a badass T-shirt.
- It's okay.

170
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,534
<i>Laugh, cry. They're close cousins.</i>

171
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,903
Just let it out.

172
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,350
He sees the Blue Pearl.

173
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,013
It's okay. It's okay.

174
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,194
Students meditate for years

175
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,896
and never see
what you have seen today.

176
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,632
Your inner self.

177
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,038
<i>That makes you
a very special person, Mr...</i>

178
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,132
McCall.

179
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,307
Jack McCall. Thank you so much.

180
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,574
<i>Sorry, I don't know what happened.</i>

181
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,449
I just got overcome with emotion.
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,818
My years and years of focused silence

183
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,948
just finally delivered me to...

184
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,425
<i>- Enlightenment?
- Enlightenment, yes. Enlightenment.</i>

185
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,756
Sorry. Hold that a second.

186
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,193
I'm so sorry.
Play it four times and it stops.

187
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,405
That is bad.

188
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,237
<i>Oh, the Blue Pearl.</i>

189
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,717
The Blue Pearl is so blue.

190
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,844
The Blue Pearl is so shiny

191
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,454
and so pearly.

192
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,122
"Three things will not long be hidden.

193
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,286
<i>"The sun, the moon,</i>

194
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,823
"and the truth. "

195
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,528
<i>Is there a reason for your visit today,
Jack McCall?</i>

196
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,764
<i>Well, sir, I am not one to waste time.</i>

197
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,897
I understand you've written a book.

198
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,663
That is true.

199
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,267
<i>Well, I'm an agent.</i>

200
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,471
And all my career
I've dreamed that I'd get to represent

201
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,014
someone who I believed in.
I believe in you.

202
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,751
And I think
I can help you to change the world.

203
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,779
I'm not interested.

204
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,280
Really?

205
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,225
<i>Dr. Sinja? Dr. Sinja, the world</i>

206
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:07,228
<i>is filled with lost,
lonely souls in need of your wisdom.</i>

207
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,527
And they're out there calling out to you

208
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,301
<i>in quiet desperation.
I hear them, I feel them.</i>

209
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,396
Aren't you amazed by trees?

210
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,970
<i>Yeah, sure!</i>

211
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,601
I love trees!

212
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,146
<i>Trees, I love them. I love trees.</i>

213
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,704
The branches and the leaves. It's just...

214
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,216
<i>You know,
some people want fame and money.</i>

215
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,048
<i>Just give me some nature,
some branches and some trees.</i>

216
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,109
I love it.

217
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,513
<i>In fact,
I have such an affinity towards trees</i>

218
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,353
I think I might even
have been a bird in another life.

219
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,392
Just...

220
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,631
Landing on a branch. Taking it all in.

221
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,467
I want to be a bird. I want to be a bird
and I want to swallow your philosophy.

222
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,835
And then I'm going to spit it back
into the mouths

223
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:47,895
of the children of the world.

224
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,073
<i>Nourish their souls. Help you to grow,
watch your wings spread,</i>

225
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,001
and help you to soar.

226
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,072
What are you talking about?

227
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,177
I'm talking about
presenting your book to the world.

228
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,583
Have you read it?

229
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,589
Of course I have.

230
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,852
So what's in it for you?

231
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:11,061
Just the satisfaction of knowing
that I helped my hero to save the world.

232
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,597
Shit!

233
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,064
The tree gave me a splinter!

234
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,237
The Bodhi tree did nothing.
It did not move.

235
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,935
<i>We all create our own destiny, Jack.</i>

236
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:29,214
<i>Dr. Sinja, if you commit to me,
I'll give you all that I am.</i>

237
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,579
<i>Mind, body and spirit. Everything.</i>

238
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,516
Let me be a big bird.

239
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,215
Hawk!

240
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,982
Or sparrow.

241
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,458
<i>Pick a bird, I'm it.</i>

242
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,258
You agree to have my book published?

243
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,258
I'm begging you for it!

244
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,463
And you will spread my philosophy
in the way I meant it to be spread?

245
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,266
<i>That goes without saying.
You have my word, sir.</i>

246
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,899
<i>Remember, our words have a profound</i>

247
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,242
rippling effect on the entire universe.

248
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,406
<i>Well, I'm counting on that.</i>

249
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,912
<i>- Jack McCall's office.
- Aaron!</i>

250
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,780
<i>I want you to run out
and buy me a throne,</i>

251
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,447
<i>and a sceptre and a crown,
because I am the king!</i>

252
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,281
<i>Oh, my God, Mr. McCall.
You signed him, didn't you?</i>

253
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,259
You bet your ass I signed him.

254
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,158
Never doubt me! Never doubt me!

255
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,352
<i>How about that?</i>

256
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,261
<i>Hey, I want you to clear
my schedule for the rest of the day.</i>

257
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,195
I want to go spend some time
with my mother!

258
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,031
Let her know what a big star her boy is!

259
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,430
<i>Okay, done, sire.</i>

260
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,978
Raymond! Is that you?

261
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,783
<i>No, it's not Raymond.
It's Jack, Ma. Your son, Jack.</i>

262
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:48,018
<i>Raymond,
I knew you wouldn't miss my birthday.</i>

263
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,391
<i>I'm not Raymond. I'm Jack, Ma.</i>

264
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,623
<i>Oh, you look good, Raymond.</i>

265
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,824
<i>Mommy, Raymond was your husband.</i>

266
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,163
<i>He left. I'm your son, Jack.</i>

267
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,170
I stayed. You raised me. Remember?

268
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,064
<i>- How you doing, Emily?
- Hey, Jack.</i>

269
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,268
<i>Okay, Annie,
now that your guest is here,</i>

270
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,833
we can have some dinner.

271
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,709
<i>Sorry to keep calling you,
but she's slipping a bit more these days.</i>

272
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,146
Now she won't eat without Raymond.

273
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,013
Raymond is your dad?

274
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,415
<i>Yeah, he was. He's dead now.</i>

275
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,385
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

276
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,553
You sure she should be drinking
these margaritas?

277
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,885
Don't worry.

278
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,552
<i>'Cause unlike me,
these margaritas are virgins.</i>

279
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,030
<i>Speaking of which, hey, Milt!</i>

280
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:29,031
<i>I can see your cojones in that pantsuit.</i>

281
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,070
It's like you're smuggling walnuts
in a polyester purse!

282
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,627
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

283
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,073
Tonight it's fajitas
and taquitos with fresh guacamole.

284
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,700
<i>Oh, gracias, Tim.</i>

285
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,110
<i>How you doing', Mom? You okay?</i>

286
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,514
Look at that suit.
You look like a gangster.

287
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,411
Why don't you wear
that suit we got married in?

288
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,753
<i>Because I'm Jack, your son, Ma,</i>

289
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,156
and I got to wear clothes like this
because I need it for my work.

290
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,990
<i>I'm a big agent, remember?
Hey, I made a big deal today.</i>

291
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:58,855
Jack?

292
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,524
<i>Raymond,
Jack never forgave you for leaving.</i>

293
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,093
- Ma!
- And Jack missed my birthday again.

294
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,935
<i>Mom, I'm Jack. I'm your son. I'm here!</i>

295
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,501
What?

296
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,340
<i>Happy birthday, Mom.</i>

297
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,354
And Caroline says hello.

298
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,120
<i>Raymond,</i>

299
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,994
is that you?

300
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,200
<i>No, Ma. It's me, Jack. Your son.</i>

301
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,210
<i>I'm going to get going now
and get back to work, so...</i>

302
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,577
Love you.

303
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,360
<i>Hola, Gaudencio. You're here late, huh?</i>

304
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,922
<i>Hi, Mr. McCall.
The sprinkler, it die, but I fix it.</i>

305
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,695
Okay.

306
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,672
<i>This is it. It's a beautiful house, Jack.</i>

307
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,908
The neighbourhood is so sweet.

308
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,444
There are kids everywhere.

309
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,535
<i>While I was there,</i>

310
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,308
an ice cream truck
actually came through.

311
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,441
<i>I mean, it's just...</i>

312
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,912
It's perfect for us.

313
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,046
But this house is perfect for us.

314
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,080
We made Tyler in this house.

315
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,454
We made Tyler in this room.

316
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,050
We made Tyler on this table. Tyler...

317
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:40,758
<i>Okay. If we're going to stay
in this house, which I'm willing to do,</i>

318
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,630
we have to do some work
to make it safer.

319
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,526
More family friendly.

320
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,730
What are you talking about?
This place is perfectly safe.

321
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:50,241
<i>No. Look, just beyond
these polished concrete floors</i>

322
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,867
is a non-fenced pool

323
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:56,145
<i>that backs up to a cliff
with a sheer drop of 2,000 feet.</i>

324
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,350
<i>Well, look,
maybe we should let the kid grow up</i>

325
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,353
and tell us where he wants to live.

326
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,412
It's a bachelor pad!

327
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,479
He's a bachelor!

328
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,458
Okay.
We cannot raise a family in this house.

329
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,552
<i>Hey, look,
I bought this house on my potential</i>

330
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,994
and then I earned it. I love this house.

331
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,556
<i>I love it, too,
but I'm changing Tyler at the bar.</i>

332
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,026
He sleeps in your media room.

333
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,662
It's like we're guests in your house.

334
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,801
It's just time.

335
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,443
<i>You know, moving is a huge change.</i>

336
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:30,778
<i>I know, but so was getting married,</i>

337
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,646
and having a baby.

338
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,154
<i>And those turned out
to be really nice changes, right?</i>

339
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,082
<i>Okay, let's do it.</i>

340
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,922
Really?

341
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,664
Let's paint the media room.

342
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,567
<i>Yeah, let's put some ducks in there
and some cartoon figures</i>

343
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,264
<i>and, you know,
just keep it mid-century modern, though.</i>

344
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,327
Mid-century modern ducks.

345
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,203
<i>- Yeah, mid-century modern and ducks.
- That's fantastic.</i>

346
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,537
That actually sounds kind a hot.

347
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,439
<i>An all new low for you, Jack.</i>

348
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,537
<i>- Hey, now what are you doing?
- I'm cleaning up.</i>

349
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,417
- What the hell was that?
- An earthquake?

350
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,526
I've been in an earthquake.
That wasn't an earthquake.

351
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,757
I'm going to check on Tyler!

352
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,912
<i>This is a beautiful tree, my friend.</i>

353
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,457
<i>Please, tell me
why you would plant a tree</i>

354
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,924
right in the middle of the patio.

355
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,392
I no plant the tree.

356
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,758
You no plant the tree?

357
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,195
I've been here all day
fixing the sprinkler.

358
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,926
I coming back to pick up my things

359
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,991
<i>and, boom, it's a tree here.</i>

360
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,400
<i>"Boom, it's a tree here"?</i>

361
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,562
Boom.

362
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,842
<i>Hey, this is that tree that bit me.</i>

363
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,643
Why the hell would he send me
something like this?

364
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,908
<i>What, is this a joke or something?</i>

365
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,971
He must think it's a gift.

366
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,617
<i>Well, now I'm stuck
with this goddamned thing?</i>

367
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,519
<i>I was going to just send him a nice wine
or, you know,</i>

368
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,284
a Harry and David's Fruit of the Month.

369
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,987
Or a massage. Or Mrs. Fields cookies.

370
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,086
Exactly.

371
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,927
You want me to get rid of it?

372
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,833
<i>No, I got to make nice.
I'll keep it. This is my tree now.</i>

373
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,736
<i>- Okay, Mr. McCall. See you manana.
- Thanks.</i>

374
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,478
Sorta classy.

375
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,756
<i>- Mr. McCall?
- Faster, Aaron.</i>

376
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,922
<i>Please, be less dumb,
but be quicker about it.</i>

377
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,659
I got a splitting headache today.

378
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,722
Are you sick?

379
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,167
<i>No, I think I'm having
an allergic reaction or something.</i>

380
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,604
<i>Well, this should cheer you up.
Here's your crown.</i>

381
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:09,936
And the throne's on order.

382
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,841
<i>But they offered me a sceptre,
so I bought it.</i>

383
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,805
Are you a moron?

384
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,571
No.

385
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,145
<i>So Sinja sent his book over, and...</i>

386
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,619
- How great is it?
- You read it?

387
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,549
How many times
do we have to go through this?

388
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,817
I don't read!

389
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,188
<i>Once again, how was Sinja's book?</i>

390
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,783
<i>No, let me tell you.
It was scintillating, huh?</i>

391
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,794
<i>You couldn't stop reading it, just like it
was your latest copy</i>

392
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:31,886
<i>of Juggs magazine, right?</i>

393
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,526
<i>It is a quick read, that's fair.</i>

394
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,862
<i>Way to go, Sinja!</i>

395
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,129
It's almost like the book was written
for you.

396
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,830
<i>Of course it was! Listen, this book is...</i>

397
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,497
Five pages long.

398
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,069
Five pages long?

399
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,738
Five pages long.

400
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,249
<i>As in one, two, three, four...</i>

401
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,012
Five. The end.

402
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,217
But look at it this way.
It's the perfect book for you

403
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,586
because the first five pages

404
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,353
and the last five pages
are the whole book.

405
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,587
<i>Okay, Aaron, come on.</i>

406
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,289
<i>Tell me that you're pulling my pecker
on this one, right?</i>

407
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,489
<i>Oh, I wish I could.</i>

408
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,897
<i>I mean, not your pecker, but...</i>

409
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:10,657
Let me see it.

410
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,667
- My...
- The book!

411
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,100
No.

412
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,446
- That's the book?
- That's the book.

413
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,750
<i>Okay. Okay,
I'm going to go down to that ashram</i>

414
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,626
and I'm going to ram this up his ass!

415
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,055
<i>It's just the dedication, right?</i>

416
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,858
Or the teaser? Or the thank yours.

417
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,797
<i>Jack, you said you loved my book.</i>

418
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,858
<i>That wasn't a book you gave me,
it was a pamphlet!</i>

419
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,266
I've read menus that were longer!

420
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,430
I read a stop sign on the way here
that was longer than that!

421
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:51,840
<i>Now, my book
is a journey of self-discovery.</i>

422
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,970
<i>Now, that journey is fulfilled
by page five.</i>

423
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,139
<i>Okay, it's coming together now.</i>

424
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,579
<i>You know, you got
a lot of tricks up your sleeve.</i>

425
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,516
<i>First, the magic tree.
Then the book with five pages.</i>

426
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,246
What's next?
You going to get on a magic yoga mat

427
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,515
and fly around in a circle?

428
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,351
<i>Then you rub your stomach,
but then, whoosh,</i>

429
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,324
the genie jumps out of my ass?

430
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,356
<i>Bless you, Jack. Are you okay?</i>

431
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,091
I'm having an allergic reaction.

432
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,962
It's probably from that tree you sent me.

433
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,128
I sent you a tree?

434
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,162
See?

435
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,735
So this is where the tree went.

436
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,667
What?

437
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,301
Interesting.

438
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,410
What's so interesting?

439
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,808
These branches
don't have a single leaf.

440
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,782
<i>You know, I noticed that, too.</i>

441
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,347
Jack?

442
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,651
Look at the tree and say something.

443
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,688
Say what?

444
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,865
What's so funny?

445
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,608
This is amazing. Don't you see?

446
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,706
<i>Hey, you know, it almost seems
like every time I say something,</i>

447
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,271
some of the...

448
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,085
Hello?

449
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,623
Hel...

450
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,326
...lo!

451
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,797
<i>I want my baby back
baby back, baby back</i>

452
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,867
<i>I want my baby back, baby back ribs</i>

453
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,105
Shit!

454
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,073
<i>Hey, how are you doing this?</i>

455
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,016
Me? I'm doing nothing.

456
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,384
You and this tree are now connected.

457
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,923
Connected?

458
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,756
It seems like
all your talking is making you sick.

459
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,462
<i>Hey, my talking is not making me sick.</i>

460
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:57,568
<i>Oh, really? What happens
when a tree loses all its leaves, Jack?</i>

461
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:58,830
<i>So what are you trying to say, Sinja?</i>

462
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,601
<i>It's obvious to me, the more you talk,</i>

463
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,766
<i>the more leaves fall, the sicker you get.</i>

464
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,539
The sicker I get?

465
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,339
So what happens
if all the leaves fall off the tree?

466
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,782
That usually means the tree is dead.

467
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,847
<i>Hey, wait a second. Hold on a second.</i>

468
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,078
You telling me that you think

469
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,143
whatever happens to the tree
happens to me?

470
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,210
Yes.

471
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,553
So I could die!

472
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,083
<i>Yes, but you would die
in the most amazing way possible.</i>

473
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,852
I could die?

474
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,525
Or someone could turn you
into a coffee table.

475
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,363
<i>Hey, Sinja, you know,
you're a real funny dude to stand here</i>

476
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,461
making jokes when my life
is being controlled by this magic tree!

477
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,297
How many leaves
you think are left on this tree?

478
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,540
A thousand?

479
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,935
<i>So what do I got, a thousand words left?</i>

480
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,440
Now you have 993.

481
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,246
<i>One word, one leaf.</i>

482
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,650
<i>Well, I know how to make this shit stop.</i>

483
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,796
<i>Oh, no, no, you shouldn't do this.</i>

484
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,131
<i>- That is murder!
- Yeah, and it's premeditated, too!</i>

485
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,689
<i>Jack, you shouldn't do this!</i>

486
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,327
<i>You know what, Sinja?
You worry about pages six through 200</i>

487
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,530
and you let me worry
about Mr. Tricky Tree over here!

488
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,006
<i>And on that note, one last final word!</i>

489
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,542
Timber!

490
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,779
Be glad you don't own a chainsaw.

491
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,047
Why did you do this to me?

492
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,217
I didn't do this. I wouldn't know how.

493
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,726
<i>So, what, the universe cursed me?</i>

494
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:33,491
Maybe.
This is between you and the tree.

495
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,466
<i>Hey, wait a minute. If this is real,
what am I supposed to do?</i>

496
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,560
You ever heard of this before?
You ever seen anything like this?

497
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,164
<i>I've never seen it,</i>

498
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,934
but there is a story
of an old monk that had a tree like this.

499
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,135
I always thought it was just a story.

500
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,110
He became very famous and honoured.

501
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,468
So he lived.

502
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,037
<i>No, he died.</i>

503
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,139
Jesus.

504
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,980
<i>No, his name was Stan.</i>

505
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,713
I'm leaving for Bolivia tonight.

506
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:58,347
A spiritual retreat
in Potosí called La Paz.

507
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:01,221
Let me talk to my colleagues there
about you and your tree.

508
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,885
<i>Bolivia? Well, when you coming back?</i>

509
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,689
- In three days.
- Three days?

510
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,196
What am I supposed to do until then?

511
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,232
<i>If I were you, Jack, I'd be quiet.</i>

512
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,592
Don't talk for three days.
How hard can it be?

513
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,399
Hello!

514
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:21,801
Shit.

515
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,474
<i>Come on, Jack.</i>

516
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,911
What is the purpose
in cursing you with a tree

517
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:30,512
that loses a leaf
with every word you speak?

518
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,489
That is ridiculous!

519
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,357
I guess you're right.

520
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,388
It's crazy!

521
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,126
It's ridiculous!

522
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,498
Did you see that?

523
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,802
See what?

524
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:54,311
<i>A leaf with every word!
Jack, you slay me!</i>

525
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,640
<i>Oh, Lord Jesus!
God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, my God!</i>

526
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,447
<i>God, oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God!</i>

527
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,297
Morning.

528
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,786
<i>Good morning, sir.
What can I get started for you today?</i>

529
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,730
What size?

530
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,836
<i>All right, three venti lattes.</i>

531
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,167
Would you care for a pastry? No?

532
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,007
<i>Oh, mocha! Three mocha lattes.</i>

533
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,176
Double chocolate-chip muffin! Yum!

534
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,720
You want three Paul McCartney CDs.
Awesome.

535
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,394
<i>You know, I love the Beatles.
They are my life.</i>

536
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,164
Assassination! Abraham Lincoln!

537
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:04,030
<i>You, me, gun, shoot!</i>

538
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,033
Three shots.

539
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,008
<i>I know, I'm a little slow today.</i>

540
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,777
<i>All right, so three lattes, three mochas,</i>

541
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,482
double chocolate-chip muffin
and three shots.

542
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,850
No assassinations.

543
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,086
And three Paul McCartney CDs.

544
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,486
That's going to be $68.12.

545
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,874
Could you tell me when
it's safe to cross?

546
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,178
<i>Are you deaf? I said,</i>

547
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:48,550
"Can you tell me
when it's safe to cross?"

548
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,654
<i>It is? Thanks, fella!</i>

549
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,265
<i>Stop it, stop it, stop it!</i>

550
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,002
<i>Hey, my brother, what's happening,
brother? What's going on?</i>

551
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,542
Hey! Was that a drive-by?
What was that?

552
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,014
<i>Somebody tell me, was that a drive-by?</i>

553
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,748
<i>Thanks, son! White people sure is nice!</i>

554
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,147
<i>Hey, Mr. McCall.</i>

555
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,085
<i>Hey, about my book,
any chance you read it yet?</i>

556
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,491
<i>Great story, right?</i>

557
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:07,327
<i>Oh, you did read it.
Oh, God, and you hate the story.</i>

558
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,296
<i>Okay, but the writing is good, right?</i>

559
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,034
<i>No? Well, why don't you lie to me?</i>

560
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,470
You've been lying to me for three years
about how you couldn't read it.

561
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,598
<i>Now suddenly you read it, you hate it,</i>

562
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,437
it sucks and you just smash my hopes

563
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,636
<i>on the rocks of
"Hey, Wayne, go back to Nebraska</i>

564
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,804
"and shave sheep with your dad. "

565
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,506
You don't know what it's like
to be a writer. I hate myself.

566
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,381
<i>I hate myself, do you get that?
I hate myself!</i>

567
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,858
I'll park your car.

568
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,226
<i>Yeah, I'll park your car,
Mr. Encouragement.</i>

569
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,661
<i>Mr. McCall, thank God you're here.</i>

570
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,393
I have a lot of messages.

571
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,332
Do you want to start with the most
recent or the most urgent?

572
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,068
<i>You got a sore throat? Okay, don't talk.</i>

573
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,163
Okay. How about some tea?

574
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,108
Cough medicine?
How about a notepad to write on?

575
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,770
Okay.

576
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:00,545
<i>Well, then how am I supposed to know
what you want me to...</i>

577
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,516
<i>Mr. McCall, are you not speaking to me
because you're mad at me?</i>

578
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,623
<i>You found out that I left work early
yesterday. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

579
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,854
<i>Okay, I have stomach problems</i>

580
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,489
and I had to run home
because I can't use public bathrooms.

581
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,531
I'm seeing a therapist about it.

582
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,792
Okay.

583
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,030
<i>Jack, is this about the Christmas party?</i>

584
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,160
I'm so sorry.

585
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,571
<i>That was the peach schnapps
that tried to kiss your wife, not me.</i>

586
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,040
<i>I mean, I don't want to kiss your wife,</i>

587
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,406
even though her lips felt like heaven.

588
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:28,534
I'm going to go.

589
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,184
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

590
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:40,556
You found my video camera
with the furry tapes.

591
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,518
<i>Pardon me, Mr. McCall.</i>

592
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:43,582
Samantha asked me to get you.

593
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,094
She wants to introduce you
to somebody.

594
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,788
<i>Yeah, Mary, the jig's up, okay?</i>

595
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,229
<i>He knows what we do in here,</i>

596
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,894
<i>in his office, after work,
on his desk, in his chair.</i>

597
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,033
<i>Mr. McCall, I just want to say, first of all,</i>

598
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,403
<i>you know, she's the one that always
wanted to be the filthier animals,</i>

599
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,272
like the skunk and the naughty beaver.

600
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,868
I tried to be the more dignified animals

601
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,004
like the wolf
and the California black bear.

602
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,070
<i>And don't hurt me, I'm sorry.</i>

603
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,117
It's just this sexual hunger I have.
It's insatiable.

604
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,516
<i>I mean, you understand. You're a...</i>

605
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,816
You want to go outside
and settle this like men?

606
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,481
<i>All right, fine! Let's do it.</i>

607
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,617
<i>No, I didn't mean it! I'm sorry.</i>

608
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,486
<i>Jack, I have to introduce you</i>

609
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,327
<i>to Christian Léger de la Touffe,
European market.</i>

610
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,333
<i>Christian, this is Le Jack.</i>

611
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,865
<i>Bonjour. I've heard a lot about you.</i>

612
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:30,135
<i>Jack, tell Christian
the whole story about Sinja.</i>

613
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,642
Tell him all the great details. Go ahead.

614
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,735
<i>Ecoutez. You're going to die.</i>

615
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,282
Life is a journey.

616
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,279
Life is a what?

617
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,552
Life is a journey?

618
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,401
<i>Can you repeat that, please?</i>

619
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,567
Life is a journey.

620
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,071
"Life is a journey. "

621
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,810
<i>Life is a journey, yeah.</i>

622
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,870
I don't get it.

623
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,765
You like to party on us.

624
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,052
- Good afternoon.
- Hi.

625
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,584
Jack McCall.

626
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,790
<i>Yes, Mr. McCall, your party
is waiting for you. Right this way.</i>

627
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,196
You want me to do all the talking?

628
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,258
<i>No, no, no, I can't,
I don't know what to say.</i>

629
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,133
Just do what you would do?
Is that good?

630
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,173
<i>Wait, wait, wait, okay. Let's have signs,</i>

631
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,676
<i>like if I'm doing well,
you pull on your ear. Okay?</i>

632
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:17,514
<i>And then that can mean
that I need to do better. That's fine, too.</i>

633
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,685
We were starting to think
you stood us up.

634
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,017
<i>Robert Gilmore, VP of Acquisitions.</i>

635
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:28,650
<i>This is Gil Reed, head of Marketing
at Simon and Schuster.</i>

636
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,162
<i>Handshake.
Come on, man, we are brothers!</i>

637
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,459
<i>Hit me hard and high, Gil.</i>

638
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,259
Bam! That's right.

639
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,702
<i>Aaron Wiesenberger,
agent, friend of mankind</i>

640
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,465
and a lover of every book
you guys have ever published.

641
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,972
<i>Come on, what is this, Mickey D's?</i>

642
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,769
Let's get some service up in here!

643
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,810
Got a man
with a bad case of the dry mouth!

644
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,346
<i>Why don't you sit your ass down,
come on.</i>

645
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,180
<i>Good afternoon,
can I get you something to drink?</i>

646
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,948
<i>How about the distillery
to start off with, huh?</i>

647
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,182
<i>Vodka, rocks for me.</i>

648
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,953
<i>Four waters for the table,
and this fine guy right here,</i>

649
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,618
is going to have a hot toddy.
His voice is shot.

650
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:04,683
But you know what?

651
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,322
That's what he gets for screaming
for more lap dances all night!

652
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,332
You crazy bastard.

653
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,400
<i>I have four waters,
vodka rocks, hot toddy.</i>

654
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,698
My man.

655
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,312
<i>Gentlemen, we don't
want to play games on this one.</i>

656
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,784
<i>Good, games are for children.</i>

657
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,016
The statistics speak for themselves.

658
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,558
Dr. Sinja has a huge fan base
around the world.

659
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:38,026
We want to be the company
to broaden that fan base here.

660
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,824
We think we have a great offer.

661
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,832
<i>A $250,000 advance</i>

662
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,226
That sounds great.

663
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,497
<i>All right, Im need y'all to quit playing
with me and pull out your big guns</i>

664
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,776
<i>because this is
"Show Me Your Dick" time, fellas!</i>

665
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,280
<i>Damn, Jack, look at you,
sweating like a bitch.</i>

666
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,249
<i>Just chill out, homey.
I got this. Gil, come here.</i>

667
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,411
<i>Gil, what I need from... Stay with me.</i>

668
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,454
What I need from you
is to bring that paper.

669
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,716
<i>You know, you got to turn the volume up</i>

670
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,314
<i>on that offer, homey,
'cause I can't hear it.</i>

671
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,387
I'm a young man.
My ears are good. I can't hear it.

672
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,621
We can't go higher
if we haven't even seen the book yet.

673
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,527
That's what it sounds like.

674
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,395
<i>Look, you can't expect us to bid higher</i>

675
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,524
<i>when we haven't seen the book,
can you?</i>

676
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,864
That's ridiculous.

677
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,801
Do you know
who the hell you're talking to?

678
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,772
<i>I'm Aaron Wiesenberger!
You better recognize, son!</i>

679
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:27,038
I find both your language
and demeanor insulting and intolerable.

680
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:31,138
Simon and Schuster doesn't
do business with spineless jerks. Gil?

681
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,115
<i>No, no, no, wait! Wait, gentlemen, wait.</i>

682
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,846
<i>Listen, I'm sorry
if I offended you back there.</i>

683
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,945
I was just doing my agent act.

684
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,224
<i>You know?
I mean, I don't even have a real degree.</i>

685
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,952
<i>I went to community college,</i>

686
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:45,928
and that was only because my grandma
was sleeping with the dean.

687
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,261
<i>Good luck, gentlemen. You'll need it.</i>

688
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:54,128
<i>The wheels on the bus
go round and round</i>

689
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,301
<i>Round and round, round and round</i>

690
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:00,807
<i>The wheels on the bus
go round and round</i>

691
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,869
<i>All through the town</i>

692
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,936
<i>Wait a minute, Dads.</i>

693
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:06,907
We have a lip syncher.

694
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,113
Mother.

695
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,182
<i>Everyone needs to sing along, Dad.</i>

696
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,850
<i>See, 'cause Tyler's
taking his cues from you, okay?</i>

697
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,759
He really needs you to sing along.

698
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,926
<i>The wipers on the bus go...</i>

699
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,362
<i>Swish...</i>

700
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,506
<i>Swish, swish, swish</i>

701
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,469
<i>Swish, swish, swish</i>

702
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,041
<i>Swish, swish, swish</i>

703
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,811
<i>The wipers on the bus
go swish, swish, swish</i>

704
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:43,877
<i>All through the town</i>

705
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,349
<i>Okay, Tyler,
are you ready to go to the moon?</i>

706
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,956
Here we go!

707
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,198
He's finally down.

708
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,933
Can we talk?

709
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,107
It's kind of funny
how you got singled out in that class

710
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,206
<i>for not knowing the words, right?</i>

711
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,844
<i>I mean, Jack McCall
not knowing the words?</i>

712
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,909
That's a rarity.

713
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,550
<i>It was really sweet, Jack.</i>

714
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,788
It makes me very happy
to see the two of you in that circle.

715
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,033
I think it's really important
that you guys have at least one thing

716
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,593
<i>that you do together, you know?</i>

717
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,671
<i>So, they offer it twice a week.</i>

718
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,075
<i>Which day would you prefer,
Tuesday or Wednesday?</i>

719
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,673
Can't.

720
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,139
You can't.

721
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,419
You can't take one hour
out of your week

722
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,479
to be with your son? I don't understand.

723
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,732
<i>What, the pool? The view? Wow.</i>

724
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,860
I am trying to talk to you about our child

725
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,401
and you want to fight
about the house again?

726
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:11,469
<i>Look, honey, could you just try
for a second to talk to me about Tyler?</i>

727
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,272
Just be here with me right now. What...

728
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,955
<i>Apparently not.
Okay, that's good to know.</i>

729
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,522
Sorry!

730
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,683
Sorry?

731
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,995
I'll let your son know that you're "sorry. "

732
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,131
My life.

733
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,695
<i>It's our life, Jack.</i>

734
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,809
<i>I know that when we fell in love,
it was a whirlwind romance</i>

735
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,368
<i>and then it seems like
I brought up the idea of having a baby,</i>

736
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,608
<i>and, like, overnight we were pregnant.</i>

737
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,413
But that's just how
life works sometimes.

738
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,918
<i>Have you ever heard the expression,
"Man plans, God laughs"?</i>

739
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,549
Two days.

740
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,891
Two? Two days till what?

741
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,229
<i>Jack, what? To what?</i>

742
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,759
<i>Honey, you got to talk to me!</i>

743
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,463
What? You're like a mental patient

744
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,231
with the pointing
and the grunting. What?

745
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,170
All of my talking is making you sick.

746
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,671
That's great. You know what?

747
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,577
I won't talk anymore.
How about that? You don't want to talk?

748
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,016
<i>I don't want to talk, either.</i>

749
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,539
<i>Welcome to the international directory.</i>

750
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,098
<i>Are you looking for a country code?</i>

751
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,576
<i>Are you still there?</i>

752
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:55,802
Yes!

753
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,211
<i>What country
would you like the code for?</i>

754
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,580
Bolivia.

755
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,713
<i>I'm sorry. I couldn't make that out.</i>

756
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,015
Bolivia.

757
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,681
<i>Namibia. Is that correct?</i>

758
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,453
<i>No, stupid!</i>

759
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,223
<i>Let me connect you
to the next available...</i>

760
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,854
<i>International directory.</i>

00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,796
<i>Country code, Bolivia.</i>

00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:20,831
<i>City, Potosí. Business listing, La Paz.</i>

763
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:26,669
Sinja!

764
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,168
Yes!

765
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,040
<i>Hello? This is Dr. Sinja. Who's calling?</i>

766
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,643
<i>Who's calling?</i>

767
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,620
Jack McCall!

768
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:43,524
<i>Jack! Yes, well,
you're calling for an update, yes?</i>

769
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:51,331
<i>I'm sorry, Jack, I forgot.
Trying to save our words, right?</i>

770
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,667
<i>Just make an animal noise
if I'm correct.</i>

771
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,505
<i>Good. Well, I have nothing yet,</i>

772
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:04,071
<i>but I return tomorrow
and I shall call you as soon as I land.</i>

773
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,479
<i>Bye, Jack!</i>

774
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:08,874
Dickhead!

775
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,717
"Dickhead" is one word!

776
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,685
You are messing with the wrong guy!

777
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,157
<i>What's up, my man? Can I get
something started for you today?</i>

778
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,703
Sure. Venti triple-shot latte.

779
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,807
Venti triple-shot iced latte.

780
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,982
Extra milk?

781
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,187
Jack! What the hell happened
at lunch yesterday?

782
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,816
I got a call from Simon and Schuster.
They're pulling out of the deal.

783
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:51,383
<i>They said some twerp junior agent
came to the meeting with you,</i>

784
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,124
<i>that he was rude, uncouth and stupid!</i>

785
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,189
<i>Now I have teed up
Random House perfectly here,</i>

786
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,860
<i>so don't screw this up, too.
These guys are ready to pay.</i>

787
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:01,370
Just keep it down
to business and it's a done deal.

788
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:02,462
Miss Davis?

789
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,473
I've got Mr. Parker
from Random House on the line.

790
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,873
<i>Okay, here we go.
It's a no-brainer, Jack.</i>

791
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:09,105
A deaf mute could close this deal.

792
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,813
I'm late for a meeting.
Call me when you're done?

793
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,209
You promise you're going to call me?

794
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,353
<i>Don't let me down, Jack.</i>

795
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:26,987
<i>Jack!</i>

796
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:31,200
<i>Don Parker.
I got Sarah Elliot, Rick Panero with us.</i>

797
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,404
<i>Jack, are you there?</i>

798
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,735
<i>Hello? Jack, are you there?</i>

799
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,000
Hello?

800
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,504
Good.

801
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,807
<i>Hey, I guess Samantha
told you we were interested.</i>

802
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,073
<i>Great.</i>

803
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,713
So what do you say we make a deal?

804
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,045
<i>Jack?</i>

805
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,555
Hello? You want to get started or no?

806
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,019
<i>Good. Okay, listen.</i>

807
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,289
<i>Let's skip the formalities,
get right down to specifics.</i>

808
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,387
<i>We talked internally.</i>

809
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,922
<i>We thought
a realistic offer would be 250.</i>

810
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,593
<i>What do you say?</i>

811
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,329
<i>What if I bumped it up to 275?</i>

812
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,707
<i>You really need to consider the 275.</i>

813
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,003
<i>Why don't you run it by your people?</i>

814
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,301
We'll wait.

815
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:21,742
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

816
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,716
<i>Sorry, sorry, sorry.</i>

817
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,361
I just need to borrow this for a minute.
I'll explain later.

818
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,918
I need to borrow this. It's for Jack.

819
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,429
<i>Rachel, I think
there's some real secret shit</i>

820
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:37,331
that I'm going to start telling everybody
if you don't give me the damn doll!

821
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,134
So what's the verdict on the 275?

822
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,696
<i>Are you in, are you out?</i>

823
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,035
<i>We haven't even seen the book.</i>

824
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,576
What's the problem? You don't trust
our publicity department?

825
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,276
<i>You're damn right they are!
So what's the hang up?</i>

826
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,054
<i>Hey, you going to start throwing insults?</i>

827
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,615
<i>Listen, if that's the way
you're going to handle this,</i>

828
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,161
we'll just call the whole deal off.
Check the attitude.

829
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,531
<i>All right, Jack, look.
Just throw me a bone here.</i>

830
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,261
What if I bumped it up to 300?

831
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,234
Fine! I give up! Five hundred!

832
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,477
<i>If I get 500 approved,</i>

833
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,536
are we closed?

834
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:30,017
<i>You are going to owe me
so big next time, mister.</i>

835
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:36,619
<i>Tyler is teething, poor thing,
and it's terrible, you know,</i>

836
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,127
<i>because he's not sleeping,
I'm not sleeping.</i>

837
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,959
Jack's not getting any ass?

838
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,696
Can you...

839
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:44,825
He won't even baby-proof the kitchen.

840
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,597
Why in the world
would I give him some?

841
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,830
Are you wearing
granny panties right now?

842
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:48,929
Excuse me?

843
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,566
Are you wearing
granny panties right now?

844
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,073
And a nursing bra?

845
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,610
I am not answering that.

846
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,339
You don't have to.

847
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,312
I am doing the best I can.

848
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:00,878
I have a present for you.

849
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,208
What is that?

850
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,521
Do not judge me by what's in this bag.

851
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,285
No.

852
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:17,026
<i>No, I cannot do this.</i>

853
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,490
Why not?

854
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:21,163
Because I am not that kind of girl.

855
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,365
That's why they make tequila.

856
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,241
Tequila plus ass equals happiness.

857
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,177
<i>How can I help you, sir?</i>

858
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,279
Meeting someone.

859
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:45,288
I was told you'd be punctual.

860
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:11,077
<i>My! You're a wee slip of a thing,
aren't you? But all right.</i>

861
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,322
Climb aboard.

862
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,157
I'm so sorry about the mix-up.

863
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,888
Caroline McCall's in room 413.

864
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,205
You looking for someone?

865
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,519
<i>I've been thinking about you all day,</i>

866
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:53,361
about all the things I want to do

867
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,388
to you.

868
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,158
Let me help you.

869
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,200
Now why don't you

870
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,241
tell me what you want.

871
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,875
Tell me all the little

872
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:15,115
naughty things
you want me to do to you.

873
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,555
Bow-chik-a-bow-wow.

874
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,590
<i>Don't be scared, babe.
Just spicing things up a bit.</i>

875
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,399
<i>Here's how it's going to work, baby.</i>

876
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:34,062
<i>The more you say, the more I do.</i>

877
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,131
So tell me what you want. Come on.

878
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,867
<i>Talk dirty to me, Jack.</i>

879
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,207
Don't you want me?

880
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:45,904
Yeah?

881
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,177
<i>Come on, then say it.</i>

882
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,549
Tell me what you want me to do.

883
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:54,083
<i>Yeah, yeah, talk dirty.</i>

884
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,784
<i>Come on, Jack.</i>

885
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,884
<i>Come on, you can do it, that's right.</i>

886
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:59,053
<i>That's right, Jack, come on.</i>

887
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,957
<i>Come on, Jack, Jack.</i>

888
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:02,765
<i>Talk dirty to me, Jack!</i>

889
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:07,895
I don't know what I was thinking.

890
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:11,801
<i>Honey, I just wanted to try
to prove to you</i>

891
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,206
that we could still have fun.

892
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,171
But I guess we can't.

893
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:18,373
<i>So, I'm so embarrassed.</i>

894
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,939
<i>Okay, Jack, this isn't working.</i>

895
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:28,556
We don't...
We're not what we used to be.

896
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,320
<i>I mean, not since Tyler was born.</i>

897
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,021
It's just different.

898
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,689
It's like we've forgotten
how to talk to each other.

899
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:35,959
<i>I mean, don't you think it's different?</i>

900
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,835
<i>Jack, I don't even know
if you love me anymore.</i>

901
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:42,133
Are you still in love with me?

902
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:47,076
<i>Okay, well, then, you have to say that,</i>

903
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,044
<i>you have to tell me that, okay?</i>

904
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:50,477
I want to hear you say it.

905
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,880
I love you.

906
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:57,517
<i>No, Jack, please,
I need to hear it. Okay?</i>

907
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:02,581
<i>I need you to say, "Caroline,
I love you, and I want to be with you.</i>

908
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:06,993
"I want to spend the rest
of my life with you and never let you go. "

909
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,032
Can you please say that?

910
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,264
Can you say that?

911
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:15,860
Yes!

912
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:22,703
But that's it.

913
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:24,978
Okay.

914
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:30,076
<i>Okay, so I think that
we should see a professional,</i>

915
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,485
<i>somebody that we can sit down
and talk to,</i>

916
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:35,821
and they can help us
figure out how to end all this.

917
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:39,987
What?

918
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:50,998
There's a tree.

919
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,338
Losing leaves. Strength.

920
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,808
<i>When I talk, leaves go.</i>

921
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,213
<i>And when leaves go,</i>

922
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,386
I die.

923
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,849
That's what this is about?

924
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,125
Some midlife crisis bullshit?

925
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:16,524
<i>You're here to tell me this poem
about your leaves falling,</i>

926
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,568
<i>like if you somehow
communicate with me,</i>

927
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,102
you're going to be less of a man?

928
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,832
<i>Jack, get out.</i>

929
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,697
<i>No, really.</i>

930
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,036
Go.

931
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,104
<i>I want to be alone, please.</i>

932
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,745
<i>Jack, now.</i>

933
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,956
<i>Jack! Hey, Sam is at lunch right now</i>

934
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,995
<i>closing your deal
with Random House and don't kill me,</i>

935
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:20,859
but I stepped away from my desk

936
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,229
and somebody
sent a copy of Sinja's book over.

937
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:26,958
Are you mad?

938
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:34,832
<i>Oh, look who it is!</i>

939
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,607
<i>- Hey, Jack.
- Hi, Jack.</i>

940
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,140
<i>What is this, casual Fridays?</i>

941
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,308
<i>Okay, look, we got to lock this up,</i>

942
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,908
get them excited and signing
before they change their minds.

943
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:45,079
Did you bring the book?

944
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,646
<i>It's okay. Mary's bringing a copy later.
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.</i>

945
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,026
<i>You breathe that stuff in and, boom,
it make you loco!</i>

946
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,164
Now we're all here.

947
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,601
<i>All right, let me catch you up to speed.</i>

948
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,798
We're talking about
marketing and rollout strategies.

949
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,840
Marketing and rollout strategies.

950
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,912
I think we should all be thinking globally.

951
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,081
Boom!

952
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:18,982
<i>I was going to clean my room
Until I got high</i>

953
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,087
<i>Are you okay, Jack?</i>

954
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:26,017
Jack?

955
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,263
Can I get you some water? All right.

956
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,028
<i>Sir, may I bring you something to eat?</i>

957
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:34,897
Maybe you'd like to start
with a lovely salad.

958
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,875
<i>He'll just have water, thank you.</i>

959
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:46,304
Thank you very much.

960
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:51,281
<i>Yes, it's getting us all quite giddy,
the whole idea of it.</i>

961
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,618
<i>So, I think, as far as television goes,</i>

962
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,453
we want a full-scale media blitz.

963
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,755
<i>Morning shows, late night,
all the talk shows.</i>

964
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:00,019
<i>With a book like this,</i>

965
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:04,226
<i>we can target discount stores,
club chains, coffee shops.</i>

966
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,665
I also think
we should look at product tie-ins.

967
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:12,765
Like Sinja's diets or workout tapes.

968
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,810
Good idea.

969
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,813
<i>I've prepared contracts, which you'll find
at the back of your packets.</i>

970
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,345
You'll notice
that the price has gone up slightly

971
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:24,353
and that's to reflect the author's
marketing commitments to this project.

972
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,355
<i>No, thank you, Jack. I'm on Atkins.</i>

973
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,991
But I really don't see any reason
why we shouldn't go ahead

974
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,387
and sign this right now

975
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,157
so we can all move forward together
as one professional team.

976
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,128
Jack!

977
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,260
<i>Yeah, I could have just emailed this
to you.</i>

978
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,737
The book is just five pages.

979
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,233
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

980
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,809
<i>Ira, I'm sure this is all
some sort of misunderstanding.</i>

981
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,110
- Samantha.
- We'll be in touch.

982
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,819
Jack! What the hell is wrong with you?

983
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:01,519
Acting like
a drunk 3-year-old at the table?

984
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,890
Not telling me
that Sinja's book is five pages long?

985
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,761
Don't you have anything at all to say
about this?

986
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:18,701
<i>Jack, you're fired.</i>

987
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,504
<i>Okay, okay, please calm down.</i>

988
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,709
<i>I need you to relax, Mr. McCall.</i>

989
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,718
'Cause I'm here
to help you get your job back.

990
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,048
I am and we're going to do it.

991
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,185
<i>But right now, I'm just really concerned</i>

992
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,723
about that vein in your neck exploding.

993
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,589
<i>I'm going to get it this time, I promise.
I promise. Here we go.</i>

994
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:42,756
<i>Okay, you.</i>

995
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:45,125
<i>Yes, that's you.</i>

996
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:46,662
You...

997
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:48,463
You're talking... You talk?

998
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:52,536
<i>Okay, we've established that.
And it's snowing.</i>

999
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,634
<i>No? Okay. Okay, yeah.</i>

1000
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:55,803
Obviously not snowing.

1001
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,069
The leaves.

1002
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,774
The leaves fall...
The leaves fall off the tree.

1003
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:02,716
Okay. Okay.

1004
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,652
<i>When you talk,
all the leaves fall off the tree.</i>

1005
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,889
<i>Okay, this is fun.
It's not fun. I didn't mean it like that.</i>

1006
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:15,963
<i>And when all the leaves fall off the tree,</i>

1007
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:17,755
you are asleep.

1008
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,692
Okay. You're not asleep.

1009
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,472
You're illegal. You're a stop sign?

1010
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,799
<i>Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

1011
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,571
You're vogueing?

1012
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:30,806
You...

1013
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,878
<i>When all the leaves fall off, you die!</i>

1014
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,287
<i>Oh, listen, I get it.</i>

1015
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,315
I get it. I once took acid in college

1016
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,884
and I thought for sure
that my hair had a heartbeat.

1017
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,064
But it didn't!

1018
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:56,394
Okay.

1019
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,132
Pancake.

1020
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:05,002
It's a coincidence.

1021
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:06,673
<i>It's not a coincidence, you idiot!</i>

1022
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,148
<i>Look, you just lost five more!</i>

1023
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,751
I'm sorry. Can I be really honest here?

1024
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,288
I think I know why Samantha fired you.

1025
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,523
'Cause this is very crazy.
This is like Britney territory.

1026
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,757
<i>Okay, well said,
Mr. McCall, but I'm going to go.</i>

1027
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,461
<i>No, it's cool, we're cool. We're cool.</i>

1028
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:34,366
Stay? You want me
to keep an eye on the leaves?

1029
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:36,571
Okay.

1030
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:38,377
Never thought I'd miss
the marshmallows.

1031
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,507
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

1032
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:42,345
To pray?

1033
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:45,311
To be an angel?

1034
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:48,222
<i>Okay, got it. Good luck!</i>

1035
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:54,521
Pancake.

1036
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,108
How about now?

1037
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:08,438
Falling as we speak.

1038
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:13,508
Hello.

1039
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,077
Thank you. God bless you.

1040
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:19,221
<i>Oh, my God, all the leaves just fell off.</i>

1041
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,545
What?

1042
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,248
<i>No, I'm kidding.</i>

1043
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:29,723
God bless you.

1044
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,558
Hallelujah. Now what?

1045
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:33,994
Nope.

1046
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,410
<i>Mittens! Mittens, come down!</i>

1047
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,067
<i>Come down, Mittens.</i>

1048
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,081
Falling?

1049
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:00,188
<i>Yeah, they are.</i>

1050
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,788
<i>And, Jack, Samantha's office called.
They want me back.</i>

1051
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,329
I'm sorry.

1052
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:10,225
<i>Jackie, dinner time!</i>

1053
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,702
<i>Here you go, sweetie pie.</i>

1054
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,641
<i>- Viola!
- I knew it was going to be ham</i>

1055
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:23,906
and mashed potatoes!

1056
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,806
<i>Mom, may I pick my piece first?</i>

1057
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,977
<i>You may,
because you asked so politely.</i>

1058
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,350
Thank you.

1059
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,122
There you go.

1060
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:38,052
<i>Shake it, don't break it, Jackie!</i>

1061
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,925
<i>Hey, remember
the "I Love Ham" dance? Do that dance.</i>

1062
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,092
Jackie.

1063
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,834
<i>Jackie, it's me. I mean, I'm you!</i>

1064
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:49,531
<i>Hey, Jackie, we're here!
I'm us! Jackie, I'm here!</i>

1065
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,334
<i>No, Dad, you're not here.</i>

1066
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,939
You were never here. You left.

1067
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:57,244
I'm not Dad.

1068
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,465
Pie. What a concept.

1069
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,407
<i>You can't get pie in Bolivia,
not like pie in America.</i>

1070
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:27,272
<i>Fruit pies, cream pies...</i>

1071
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,240
Sorry.

1072
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:35,509
It's quite amazing

1073
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,610
how many thoughtless words
one can speak.

1074
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:39,713
Don't you think?

1075
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,581
<i>You don't look well, Jack.</i>

1076
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,695
Your marriage is over?

1077
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,264
She took the baby and left.

1078
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,009
<i>Your job, too?</i>

1079
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:09,483
<i>Sorry, Jack.</i>

1080
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:15,223
<i>All I have for you are my beliefs,
and, well,</i>

1081
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,795
this snow globe from the airport.

1082
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,724
You unhook me
from this goddamned tree!

1083
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:26,894
<i>- Please, Jack.
- I'm dying!</i>

1084
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,603
I know you're scared.

1085
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,941
And I know I told you
I'd come back with the answer.

1086
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:39,242
<i>Well, the answer is</i>

1087
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,010
there is no answer.

1088
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,947
<i>No one knows about this tree, Jack,</i>

1089
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,853
<i>and believe me, I tried. Okay?</i>

1090
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:52,151
<i>I don't know
how this is going to work out for you,</i>

1091
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:55,254
but what I do know
is that you need to find peace.

1092
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,895
<i>If you think I'm a charlatan,
then why are you here?</i>

1093
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,641
You want my advice?

1094
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,271
You need to find the truth
about yourself.

1095
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:17,751
<i>It's quite simple, Jack.
You need to get quiet.</i>

1096
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,654
<i>Not just with your mouth,
with your mind.</i>

1097
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:25,216
<i>And in that quiet, you will hear the truth.</i>

1098
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:33,167
Do you have any other
unresolved relationships in your life?

1099
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:37,564
Good.

1100
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:39,700
Good.

1101
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:45,413
<i>Then your wife,
does she know that you love her?</i>

1102
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:46,846
I tell her that all the time!

1103
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,615
<i>Words? More words, Jack.</i>

1104
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:57,022
<i>You tell her, like meaningless leaves
that fly off a dying tree?</i>

1105
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,121
Words.

1106
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:04,656
Can't you show her that you love her?

1107
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:11,199
Make peace.
Show them that you love them.

1108
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,975
And be truthful.

1109
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:19,844
You need to accept the possibility

1110
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,344
that when all the leaves
fall off that tree...

1111
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:01,850
Mr. McCall?

1112
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:03,723
Mr. McCall?

1113
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:05,826
<i>Hey! I've been calling and emailing,</i>

1114
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:08,887
and I got great ideas
about how to save your job.

1115
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:11,730
Sinja's book can work.

1116
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,398
<i>I know, I'm excited, too.</i>

1117
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,802
We've been thinking about it all wrong.

1118
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,204
<i>Mr. McCall, are you listening?</i>

1119
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:20,742
Are you okay?

1120
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:27,276
What'd you do to yourself?

1121
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,549
You smell like my dad.

1122
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,989
You need some help? No? Okay.

1123
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:47,931
I'm not sure that getting drunk
is the best plan of attack right now.

1124
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,229
You.

1125
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,572
It's all your fault!

1126
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,975
<i>Oh, yeah, how do you like that?</i>

1127
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:00,576
Cheers!

1128
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,117
Freaking weed!

1129
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,057
<i>Mr. McCall, stop talking. Come on.</i>

1130
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,652
<i>You know, fertilizer is crap!</i>

1131
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:15,321
<i>That means that technically,
you eat shit!</i>

1132
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:16,592
<i>Stop talking, you idiot!</i>

1133
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:18,764
Just stop!

1134
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:27,139
That's it.

1135
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:29,336
What?

1136
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,204
What are you doing?

1137
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,087
I'm ending it. And I'm ending it funky!

1138
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:49,486
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

1139
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:51,755
It's a hot beat.

1140
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:54,302
That's the shit. That's Harold Melvin
and the Blue Notes.

1141
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:58,170
<i>Featuring Teddy Pendergrass!
Sing that shit, Teddy!</i>

1142
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,600
<i>Bad luck
That's what you got</i>

1143
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:03,201
<i>Jack, stop talking.</i>

1144
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:05,713
<i>Bad luck sure 'nuff got a hold on you</i>

1145
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:06,770
<i>Jack, what are you doing?</i>

1146
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,179
Done lost your woman.

1147
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:10,814
<i>- I lost my woman.
- Jack, shut up!</i>

1148
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:13,821
You know what that means now?
Not a goddamned thing!

1149
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:14,913
<i>Jack, what are you doing? Stop talking.</i>

1150
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,924
What does it matter?
Look at my family. Look at my people.

1151
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:18,857
- Jack!
- Look at my people! It's beautiful.

1152
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,418
<i>This is beautiful, my family, huh?</i>

1153
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:21,690
You're killing yourself! Stop!

1154
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:22,958
- You know why?
- Stop!

1155
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,795
<i>'Cause I got bad luck</i>

1156
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:25,959
Jack!

1157
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:27,897
Shut up!

1158
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:31,865
<i>You never think you got
Bad luck, bad luck</i>

1159
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,930
Stop talking!

1160
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:52,183
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

1161
01:08:58,901 --> 01:08:59,890
Caroline.

1162
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:22,049
There's really nothing in college
that prepares you

1163
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:24,149
to work in the real world.

1164
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,717
<i>Tree, can you hear me?</i>

1165
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:00,246
<i>Tree.</i>

1166
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:03,818
<i>We're dying, tree.</i>

1167
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,588
<i>Please, tell me what to do.</i>

1168
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:10,392
<i>It's me.</i>

1169
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,667
<i>My name is Jack McCall.</i>

1170
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,232
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

1171
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:19,763
<i>what you're listening to
is not the sound of my voice.</i>

1172
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:23,403
<i>It's the sound of my inner voice,
the one inside my head.</i>

1173
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,183
<i>Mr. McCall?</i>

1174
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:36,548
<i>Hello?</i>

1175
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:41,123
Can you hear me?
It's Emily from the nursing home.

1176
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:45,661
<i>It's your mom's birthday
and she expects Raymond to be here.</i>

1177
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:46,926
<i>Mr. McCall?</i>

1178
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,278
Look.

1179
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:40,078
<i>I know what you want,</i>

1180
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:42,555
<i>but I just don't think that there's anything
more to talk about, okay?</i>

1181
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:44,182
Because you won't...

1182
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:50,222
You.

1183
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:52,724
Me.

1184
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:56,628
We.

1185
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,802
Eternity.

1186
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,061
Is this for me?

1187
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,565
It's a Beatles record.

1188
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:29,964
<i>It's the White Album.</i>

1189
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:33,070
It's an original first press!

1190
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,804
Is this really for me to keep?

1191
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:39,738
Yes.

1192
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:43,742
Thank you.

1193
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,880
Thank you.

1194
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,357
Go get his car.

1195
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,098
You actually read it?

1196
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,264
Brilliant.

1197
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:12,170
Brilliant? Really?

1198
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:15,307
Wow.

1199
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:18,241
Sold.

1200
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,515
Sold?

1201
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:26,452
<i>Sold? That's $10,000!</i>

1202
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,395
<i>That's $10,000! I love you, man.</i>

1203
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,289
Thank you.

1204
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:38,700
Yeah.

1205
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:41,334
<i>I'm going to take care of that for you
right away, Mr. McCall.</i>

1206
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:43,037
<i>I'll gas it, too.</i>

1207
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:50,243
Who's responsible for this?

1208
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:55,788
<i>You are going to love that,
I guarantee it.</i>

1209
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,221
Yeah? Take a taste.

1210
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:08,327
I want to ride the roller coaster.

1211
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:09,427
I want to ride the Ferris wheel.

1212
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,494
I want to ride the roller coaster.

1213
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:11,561
I want to ride the Ferris wheel.

1214
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:15,834
- Roller coaster.
- Ferris wheel.

1215
01:15:22,117 --> 01:15:25,382
<i>It's sunny, but it's windy. Should we go?</i>

1216
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:26,944
You can wear my sweater.

1217
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:29,582
Is that why you wore a sweater
under your jacket?

1218
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,387
You knew I would say that.

1219
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:37,659
<i>After 42 years, you're still trying
to get me alone on the beach.</i>

1220
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:39,098
Maybe. Maybe.

1221
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:15,966
<i>Raymond, is that you?</i>

1222
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,070
<i>Raymond, is that you?</i>

1223
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,398
Yes.

1224
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,904
<i>Raymond, you finally came.</i>

1225
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:29,842
Sit!

1226
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:34,714
<i>Tell me, tell me, what you been doing?</i>

1227
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:37,451
It's my birthday.

1228
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,153
You want some birthday cake?

1229
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:42,622
What?

1230
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,362
You can't talk. Your throat.

1231
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,494
<i>Rest then, Raymond.
I have so much to tell you.</i>

1232
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:51,035
Do you like my room?

1233
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:53,173
It's so nice.

1234
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,237
I've got all my things here.

1235
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,037
<i>But sometimes,</i>

1236
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:03,143
I get lonely.

1237
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:05,978
<i>Raymond, I get so...</i>

1238
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:13,286
<i>But then, I can always count on Jack.
Jack always comes.</i>

1239
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:20,131
<i>And he brings me flowers,
helps me, and when we go for walks,</i>

1240
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:24,195
all the ladies are jealous
because he's so handsome.

1241
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:28,565
<i>I'm just so proud of him, Raymond.</i>

1242
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:33,111
<i>See, you missed Jack
grow into the greatest man.</i>

1243
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:36,082
<i>I mean, he's amazing.
He can do anything.</i>

1244
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:38,779
<i>I mean, Jack's my only reason to live.</i>

1245
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:43,655
But he's so angry.

1246
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:46,691
<i>Mad at you, mad at himself.</i>

1247
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:52,166
<i>Now, I think he believes
you left because of him.</i>

1248
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:58,298
<i>He was just a kid,
but he carries that anger every day.</i>

1249
01:17:58,373 --> 01:17:59,897
I wish he'd let it go.

1250
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:04,204
He'd be much happier if he'd let it all go.

1251
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:08,710
<i>Raymond,</i>

1252
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:13,587
you need to tell Jack

1253
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,755
how much you love him.

1254
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:19,286
We're family.

1255
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:21,959
Life's

1256
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:27,090
not worth living without family.

1257
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,526
Right?

1258
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:34,168
Right?

1259
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:44,851
Isn't someone going to sing to me?

1260
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:51,689
<i>I like cake, don't you, Jack?</i>

1261
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,270
<i>Bye, Ma. I love you.</i>

1262
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,526
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

1263
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,799
- Jack?
- Yeah.

1264
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,128
<i>I'm not Dad. I'm you.</i>

1265
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:12,036
<i>- I'm Jack, too, you know.
- Are not.</i>

1266
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:13,597
<i>- Am, too!
- Are not.</i>

1267
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:17,139
<i>I missed you, Dad.
Where have you been?</i>

1268
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:19,373
<i>You left and then I saw you a few times,</i>

1269
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:21,742
but then it was a long time.

1270
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,277
And then you died.

1271
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:27,150
<i>I'm so sorry, Jack.</i>

1272
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:29,452
<i>I guess you never know if the last time
you see someone</i>

1273
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:33,459
is going to be the last time
you ever see someone.

1274
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,724
<i>I wish there was a way
I could make it up to you.</i>

1275
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:37,787
<i>There is.</i>

1276
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:41,025
- How?
- Chase me. Come on!

1277
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,118
I forgive you.

1278
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:09,653
<i>Jack? Jack?</i>

1279
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:13,526
You're not going to believe this!

1280
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:26,164
<i>Jack, the tree, it came back to life
and it's incredible! You can talk.</i>

1281
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:37,148
<i>You've written a beautiful book, Jack.
I'm so proud of you.</i>

1282
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:41,245
<i>You're hugging me again, Jack.
We spoke about this.</i>

1283
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:44,622
That's why I'm alive! This is the real me!
That was a fake me that died.

1284
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:48,522
I just love you so much. Come here.

1285
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,257
- Hello!
- Hello.

1286
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:53,458
Friends.

1287
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,399
<i>Namaste.</i>

1288
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:57,631
<i>Welcome to my office,</i>

1289
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:01,335
the outer manifestation
of my inner being.

1290
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:03,973
You're both inside me.

1291
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:11,741
What a beautiful book. What a gift

1292
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:15,378
<i>to hold, to read, to sell.</i>

1293
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:21,188
<i>- Hey, Aaron.
- Yes.</i>

1294
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,129
No chanting.

1295
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:26,464
<i>Of course. Forgive me, wise ones.</i>

1296
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:30,203
<i>All right, we got three offers here,
three big offers.</i>

1297
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,770
Hey!

1298
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:36,970
Any of these three would be fine.

1299
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:40,014
<i>No, no, no, isnt no need to rush,
homey, we got all the leverage here.</i>

1300
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:42,483
<i>All right, what we have is an opportunity</i>

1301
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,609
to pit all three of these suckas
against each other

1302
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,119
and just grind 'em into the dirt.

1303
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:50,255
<i>Just take 'em for every last penny
they got, you know, and...</i>

1304
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:55,089
<i>In an entirely spiritual way, of course.</i>

1305
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:57,555
<i>You know what, Aaron?
You're the big agent now.</i>

1306
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,725
<i>You got your name on the door.
Why don't you pick, huh?</i>

1307
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:03,836
May I interest you in a slice of pie?

1308
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:06,430
<i>I'd love to, but I really have someplace
important I need to be right now.</i>

1309
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,499
What? More important than pie?

1310
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,272
<i>Actually, yes. But give me another hug.</i>

1311
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,011
I love you!

1312
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:19,414
That's right. I'm the big agent now.
That's my name on the door.

1313
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,523
Steven!

1314
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:30,291
Why is there a wasabi pea
in my Asian trail mix?

1315
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:34,335
<i>I am so sorry, Mr. Wiesenberger.
I thought I got them all.</i>

1316
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:36,836
<i>Well, here's one.</i>

1317
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:38,338
There's a delivery for you.

1318
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:39,998
<i>Well, bring it in.</i>

1319
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:48,477
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1320
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,382
<i>Hold still, let me get this open for you.</i>

1321
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:52,852
<i>Jack, I don't like surprises.
You know I don't.</i>

1322
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:53,910
You're going to like this one.

1323
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:55,979
You know what happened
the last time I tried to do a surprise...

1324
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:57,251
- You're going to like this one.
- What is going on?

1325
01:24:57,325 --> 01:24:58,314
- I'm putting the baby down.
- Okay.

1326
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,826
<i>Okay, all right, okay.</i>

1327
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:02,260
<i>- Can we please take it off?
- Okay, now, I'll take the blindfold off.</i>

1328
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:05,322
<i>- Yes, please, take it off.
- Take it off. Okay.</i>

1329
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:14,333
<i>Jack, this is the house
I've been trying to get you to come see.</i>

1330
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:16,377
You have to see the inside.

1331
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,309
I've already seen the inside.

1332
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:20,540
What do you... Why?

1333
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,242
Are you thinking about making an offer?

1334
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:23,409
<i>Oh, no, I can't.</i>

1335
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,976
- Why not?
- I already own it.

1336
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:37,053
Wow.

1337
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:40,532
This is a step in the right direction.

1338
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:41,591
Yes.

1339
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:45,032
<i>But you can't just
do this one thing, Jack,</i>

1340
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:47,040
and think that everything
is going to be hunky-dory.

1341
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:49,076
- That's not how it works.
- I hear you.

1342
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:50,338
You do?

1343
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:52,841
You hear that?

1344
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:54,074
What?

1345
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:56,982
The silence.

1346
01:25:57,886 --> 01:25:59,251
It's quiet.

1347
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:01,552
I like it.

1348
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:05,024
Who are you?

1349
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:10,592
<i>Honey, the tree.</i>

1350
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:11,962
<i>- How did...
- Oh, yeah.</i>

1351
01:26:12,033 --> 01:26:15,161
I had Gaudencio carefully dig it
up and next thing you know...

1352
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:17,762
<i>Boom, it's a tree there.</i>

1353
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:19,238
- Boom.
- Boom.

1354
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:25,540
<i>Boom, boom, boom.</i>

1355
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:27,311
<i>- Did he say, "Boom"?
- Yes.</i>

1356
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:28,906
<i>- Boom.
- Oh, shoot!</i>

1357
