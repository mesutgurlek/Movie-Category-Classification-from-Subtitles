1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,178
<i>Harley Wilkes was your father.
He left you his practice.</i>

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,647
You're the mayor?
Lavon Hayes, the linebacker?

3
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:07,949
You share a generator
with Wade Kinsella.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,985
I don't want you
getting any ideas.

5
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:13,588
Notice how whenever I come
around, there's always sparks?

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:15,222
How dare you see my patients?

7
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,392
Well, technically, Harley left
his half of the practice to me.

8
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:20,628
I'm not gonna share this office,
not for one minute.

9
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:23,097
If one partner doesn't bring
in 30% of the revenue,

10
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:26,033
every billing quarter, the other
partner can buy him or her out.

11
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:28,002
I'm good at what I do,
and as soon as the town

12
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:30,169
figures that out,
it'll be just fine.

13
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:34,173
So Mom, you'll have
a car meeting me

14
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:36,443
at the airport tonight?
Fantastic!

15
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:38,278
Four whole days in New York!

16
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:42,982
I am telling you,
I have earned it.

17
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:47,219
Yeah. I finally got my 30%
of patients at the practice.

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,055
Now I can relax,
and have Thanksgiving

19
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:51,857
the way it was intended.

20
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:55,127
Jean Georges is catering, right?

21
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:56,529
Thank God.

22
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,832
I am craving elegance
and refinement.

23
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,435
The BlueBellians
are probably re-enacting

24
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:05,102
the Pilgrims and Indian
corn trading, and...

25
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:08,205
giving... thanks...

26
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,910
Or not.

27
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,745
Mom, see you tonight.

28
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:15,179
Bye.

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,449
I just saw the weirdest thing.

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,283
Shiver me timbers.

31
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:22,686
Oh, hi. Hardtack?

32
00:01:22,687 --> 00:01:24,455
I knew this day would come.

33
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:28,191
You softened me up with
heat waves and blue people,

34
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,660
but I'm not falling for this.

35
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:30,894
Oh, this is no joke.

36
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:33,663
This is one of this town's

37
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:36,131
- most revered traditions.
- The early selelers

38
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:38,033
of BlueBell were doing
Thanksgiving things,

39
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:39,435
shelling peas,
brining turkey...

40
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:40,870
Watching football.

41
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:43,272
Oh, no. Getting ready to
give thanks and chow down.

42
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:44,974
When... whoosh!

43
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:46,241
Big-ass hurricane...

44
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:47,844
- Washes everything away.
- Gone.

45
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:49,878
Crops, houses, stores,
all out to sea.

46
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,780
But it washes some pirates in.

47
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:54,282
- Pirates?
- Yes, pirates.

48
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:55,650
But instead of pillaging,

49
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:57,686
these pirates saw the
struggling people of BlueBell

50
00:01:57,687 --> 00:02:00,388
and gave them food and supplies
to get back on their feet.

51
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:03,492
That's why, 200 years later,
instead of folks having

52
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:06,927
turkeys at home, we honor
those pirates by dressing up

53
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,629
and having a big fish fry

54
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,930
in the town square.

55
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:11,264
Which we call...

56
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,200
- Planksgiving.
- Bam.

57
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,669
That is the single stupidest

58
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,105
thing I've heard
since I moved here.

59
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:19,339
And I hear Wade
talking to his dates

60
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,640
every night on his front porch.

61
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,108
- Hey!
- Fine, I'm sure that your

62
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,643
little fish fry is filled with

63
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,312
as much adorableness
as it is cholesterol.

64
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:30,449
But now I am doubly happy

65
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,452
to be flying to New York
to eat turkey with my mom.

66
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,421
Wade, enjoy your holiday.

67
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,955
Lavon, see you later.

68
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,624
Please change before you
take me to the airport.

69
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:47,666
You didn't tell me Zoe was
going away for the holidays.

70
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,167
- I thought I did.
- Yeah. Well, you didn't.

71
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,738
Means I can try my new amp out.

72
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,205
She's always complaining about

73
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:57,107
how I'm blowing out
the power, and all that.

74
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:58,175
Speaking of which,
I-I need a favor.

75
00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:04,248
Bought a new fuse box.

76
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:07,051
Need you to help me to
install it while Zoe's away.

77
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:08,618
I'm sick and tired

78
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:11,387
of hearing y'all squabble
over electricity all the time.

79
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:13,089
Hey. That' a great idea.
We need it!

80
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,992
But, uh... you're gonna
have to find somebody else

81
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,027
to install it.

82
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:18,394
What are you talking about?

83
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:20,463
Oh, I don't do electrical.

84
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:22,999
You know, car engines,
carpentry, absolutely.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,233
But, uh, electrical
just ain't my thing.

86
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:29,071
I'm sorry, but,
uh... another time.

87
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:30,439
All right.

88
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,840
All right, you take
it easy, Lavon.

89
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:37,112
- Oh, my God.
- Avast, fair maiden!

90
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:40,848
Come with me and we
will sail the seven seas!

91
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:42,684
Honestly, George,
I don't have time

92
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:46,253
to play pirate,
your parents are coming!

93
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:48,456
Oh. But it's, uh,
it's Planksgiving.

94
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:52,493
And I plan on plundering
me some pirate booty.

95
00:03:52,494 --> 00:03:54,028
Mm-hmm.
Okay, well...

96
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:56,730
I would gladly let you pillage
me all day, Pirate Tucker.

97
00:03:56,731 --> 00:04:00,000
But I have to clean
and go to the store

98
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,202
because for some reason,
your parents decided to

99
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:03,737
- crash our holiday.
- Okay.

100
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:06,239
Well... I mean...

101
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,608
Y-you don't gotta
dust the outlets.

102
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,811
Is that hat on too tight?

103
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:12,645
Your mother hates me.

104
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:15,047
And the last time I saw her,
I had a breakdown at Fancie's.

105
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:18,217
Look...

106
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,852
if it makes you feel any better,

107
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,887
my mama also hates Oprah,

108
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:23,956
and Reese Witherspoon,

109
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:25,658
and springtime,

110
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:27,392
and the U.S. Women's
Soccer Team.

111
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,861
Hey, so, you admit it,
she hates me.

112
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:32,731
Baby, all that matters

113
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,465
is that I think you are perfect

114
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,400
just the way you...

115
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,603
aregh!

116
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:45,275
- Yep. Eleven.
- Well, now, count 'em again.

117
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:46,777
Brick, I already
counted three times.

118
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:50,480
Face it, Zoe got her 30% of
patients for this quarter.

119
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,682
That is impossible,
'cause on Monday

120
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:53,216
she was three patients shy.

121
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:55,519
True, but then all four
MacKenzie brothers

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,621
got into a bar fight,
and Zoe stitched 'em up.

123
00:04:57,622 --> 00:04:59,489
Then afterwards, they called

124
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,223
and asked for Zoe to
do their follow-up.

125
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:02,925
You know the rules:
they request Zoe,

126
00:05:02,926 --> 00:05:04,460
she's counted as their doctor.

127
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:06,129
Now wait a minute,
you're telling me that

128
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,564
the MacKenzie brothers--
my patients--

129
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:11,233
specifically requested
Zoe Hart to treat them?

130
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:14,037
Now why in the hell
would they do that?

131
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,505
♪ ♪

132
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,646
That explains it.

133
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:28,416
I am getting a cup of coffee.

134
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:32,920
I take it he knows
about my 30%?

135
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,722
Have to say, didn't
think you could do it.

136
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:36,190
You've come a long way, missy.

137
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,424
Well, the quarter's over,

138
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:39,193
and my father's
legacy is intact.

139
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:40,695
Now I'm going to New York City,

140
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:43,164
where Zoe Hart can be a fish
in her own polluted water.

141
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:45,599
Hey, Addy.
Is Brick in?

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,368
Oh, he just stepped out, but
I have his partner, Dr. Hart.

143
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:51,871
Guess you'll have to do.

144
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:53,840
Well, isn't that sweet?
And what brings you in today?

145
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:58,011
Caleb has been complaining of
itchiness for the last two days.

146
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:01,915
Me name be Small Cal No Beard!

147
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:02,982
Of course it is.

148
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,751
Right this way.

149
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:08,220
Six more hours, six more hours,
six more hours...

150
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:10,889
Hey, Lemon Meringue Pie!

151
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,257
Oh, hi, Daddy.

152
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:13,892
Hey. Can your old dad
buy you a cup of coffee?

153
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:15,627
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry.

154
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:17,562
I'm running late. I gotta
buy those little onions

155
00:06:17,563 --> 00:06:19,497
the Tuckers like
in their martinis.

156
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:21,565
'Cause Lord knows if they don't
have their teeny-tiny onions,

157
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:25,069
then the whole earth is just
gonna spin off its axis.

158
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,271
Ah, the Tuckers. Well, you know
your sister's so scared of them,

159
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:28,806
she hightailed it to the
Richmans' for the weekend.

160
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,908
- Oh. - Yeah. Well, at least we
only have to put up with them

161
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:32,977
- a couple times a year.
- Yeah.

162
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:35,813
Unlike a certain New York City
doctor who is a thorn

163
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:38,248
in my backside on a daily basis.

164
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:39,983
I thought you two were
getting along better.

165
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,286
That girl still does not
get what it is to be a GP.

166
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:46,556
I mean, you know, what it's like
to spend 30 years with a family,

167
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:48,091
watching them change and grow.

168
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:51,795
No, she swishes her little hips,
and steals my patients.

169
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,262
Oh, Daddy, I just...

170
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:55,064
Oh. I wish
there was a spell

171
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:57,800
that we could use
to just blow Zoe Hart

172
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:00,035
- right on out of this town.
- Yeah.

173
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:02,138
Maybe she'd take the
Tuckers along with her.

174
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:03,505
Oh, Olive! A word, please.

175
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,275
Uh, you know, sweetheart...

176
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:09,811
sometimes I think we gotta
make our own spells.

177
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,579
Um... I'll talk to you later.

178
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,347
Uh, Olive? I just want to
tell you something...

179
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,818
Seems to be mostly in his legs.

180
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,386
Okay...

181
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:20,588
Have you changed
laundry detergent?

182
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:22,423
- Bought new sheets?
- No.

183
00:07:22,424 --> 00:07:24,425
What've you been up to, lately?

184
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:25,826
Pillaging.

185
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:28,962
Sailing the seven seas,
looking for treasure.

186
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:31,464
He really loves Planksgiving.

187
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:33,200
Well, he's a kid.

188
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,568
He probably just rolled
around in some plant life.

189
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:36,636
Hornswaggle!

190
00:07:36,637 --> 00:07:40,073
There be no plants
at sea, wench!

191
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:43,776
Huh! That's Doctor Wench
to you, kid.

192
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:46,078
He doesn't have a rash,
and his vitals are normal.

193
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,747
I don't see any other symptoms.

194
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:53,252
He's probably just having a mild
allergic reaction to something.

195
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,921
Some antihistamines
should take care of it.

196
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:56,588
Thanks so much.
We appreciate it.

197
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,128
One more patient
to add to my pile.

198
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,797
Addy, can you, uh, see if I
can get on an earlier flight?

199
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:07,498
I don't see any reason
why I couldn't make it.

200
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,634
Okay, Tommy,
all medical records

201
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:11,502
transferred back
to Dr. Breeland.

202
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:14,205
Yes, your brothers
already called.

203
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:17,141
All MacKenzies back
to Dr. Breeland.

204
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:19,443
- Bye now.
- MacKenzies? My MacKenzies?

205
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:21,011
Oh, no, they're my MacKenzies.

206
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:22,746
See, I just happened
to bump into

207
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:25,482
Tommy MacKenzie's wife, Olive.
Now the funny thing is,

208
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:27,918
Olive had never heard that
her husband switched over

209
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,720
to the pretty lady doctor
in the short shorts.

210
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:35,058
Brick, you've got
to be kidding me.

211
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,393
I knew you wouldn't
be happy that I got my 30%,

212
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:39,194
but I didn't think
you'd poach my patients.

213
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,731
You did it first.

214
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,666
- Oh, I most certainly did not.
- Oh, yes, you did.

215
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:45,934
Oh, no, I did not.

216
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:49,171
I treated them because
they asked to see me.

217
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:50,805
I'll tell you what.

218
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:53,742
You can have them if you can
name all four brothers.

219
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:55,343
Fine.

220
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:59,213
MacKenzie comma Tommy.

221
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:03,617
Mackenzie comma...

222
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,386
Logan.

223
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:07,255
MacKenzie...

224
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:10,324
MacKenzie...

225
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:11,858
The other two didn't
speak that much.

226
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:16,196
Well, you go on up to
New York, have a good time,

227
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:19,998
and I'll just stay here
and buy you out.

228
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:24,470
Oh. Enjoy your... Thanksgiving.

229

www.Addic7ed.com

230
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:42,323
Okay, how many more patients
do I need to make 30%?

231
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:43,892
Well, you got Cap'n No Beard
this morning,

232
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,260
so that puts you three shy.

233
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:47,262
Well, I still have a couple
hours before my flight.

234
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,097
You really think you can get
three patients by midnight?

235
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:50,932
Not playing by the book, no.

236
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:57,837
I was awfully surprised
to see y'all

237
00:09:57,838 --> 00:09:59,973
come down here
for Planksgiving.

238
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,909
Well, thought
we'd mix thinin up.

239
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,211
In fact, we've learned to
embrace a new tradition

240
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:07,014
in Montgomery.
It's called Thanksgiving.

241
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:10,416
We brought a turkey
with all the trimmings.

242
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,718
Lemon, you and I can wake up
early and get started.

243
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,520
I can see how your
cooking's coming along!

244
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:16,722
Yay!

245
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:18,891
I've always wanted to

246
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:21,693
make a real Thanksgiving dinner.

247
00:10:21,694 --> 00:10:23,062
From scratch.

248
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:24,630
For hours and hours...

249
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:27,299
Look, Mom, thank you so much,
it's very nice of you,

250
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,634
but our tradition
is Planksgiving.

251
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:32,804
George, you can have your
little fish fry next year.

252
00:10:32,805 --> 00:10:35,307
But this dinner is
our chance to celebrate.

253
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:36,741
Celebrate what?

254
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:38,343
Your brother, Harry...

255
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:40,078
is going to run for
the state legislature!

256
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,313
- Well, that's, I mean that's,
that's great! - How exciting!

257
00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:44,614
- That's...
- A politician in the family.

258
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,417
Yeah, that's great.

259
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,185
Of course, that means that
Harry's gonna have to

260
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:49,553
resign from the law firm.

261
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:53,123
Leaving his position open.

262
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:58,627
Look, Dad, we've
talked about this. Okay?

263
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:00,997
I already left once
to do corporate law.

264
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:03,299
It wasn't my thing
for many, many reasons.

265
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,269
I'm not leaving BlueBell again,
period.

266
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,971
But that's the best part.

267
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:09,872
Your father convinced
his partners

268
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:11,574
to let you work from BlueBell!

269
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:13,476
You'd only be in Montgomery
three days a week.

270
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:15,444
The firm has housing
you can use.

271
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:16,811
And, well, Lemon, that means

272
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:19,414
that you'll have to join him

273
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:21,583
on those days.

274
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:26,388
Oh. Three days a week?
With you?

275
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:27,789
That's just swell!

276
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,038
Okay, $100 for the first person

277
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,108
to make a doctor's
appointment with me right now!

278
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:51,344
Come on!

279
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:54,147
Zoe, I'm sorry,
but um... Brick is our doctor.

280
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,316
And we are a loyal bunch.

281
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:00,453
Shelley!

282
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,354
Shell! Shellster,

283
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,356
Shellerino?

284
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,791
I'm sorry, Zoe.

285
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,960
I really am.
I think you're great.

286
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,063
I really do.
It's just that I saw

287
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,399
Brick for a checkup right
before you got here,

288
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,500
and I feel great.

289
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,767
But you had a headache
the other day.

290
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,302
It went away with two aspirin.

291
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,569
You know, there was

292
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,472
this case
of this guy with a headache.

293
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:23,508
Turns out he had a whole set
of teeth

294
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,043
growing behind his eyeballs.

295
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:34,051
All right, meet you at your
office in a couple minutes.

296
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,591
Hey, Tom...
Tommy!

297
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:42,825
Oh, no, no, no.

298
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,994
My mom will kill me

299
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:46,863
if I see a doctor
other than Dr. Breeland.

300
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:48,465
He delivered me!

301
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,966
Come on, Tom.
I need new patients today.

302
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:54,370
If you be my girlfriend
for a month.

303
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:55,504
Okay.

304
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:56,805
- Yeah?
- No.

305
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:58,740
Oh... An ounce of
realism, please, Tom?

306
00:12:58,741 --> 00:12:59,975
Show me your boobs.

307
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:02,511
One boob?

308
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:04,380
How about you come
with me right now,

309
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,148
and I won't tell your mother
what you just asked me to do?

310
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,451
Deal.

311
00:13:09,452 --> 00:13:10,952
Okay.

312
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:12,387
I cannot believe

313
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:15,957
that we agreed to do
Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.

314
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,694
I mean, shoot, even if
it does get done by 7:00,

315
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:21,162
we're gonna miss the
plank-walking contest!

316
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:23,663
Plank-walking?
Really, George?

317
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,166
That was your big takeaway
from lunch?

318
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,803
Why, Lemon Breeland,
don't you know me at all?

319
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:31,838
I'm not taking that job.

320
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,873
My dad doesn't even
respect me as a lawyer.

321
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:35,875
The only reason he wants
me is 'cause Harry left

322
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:38,744
and he wants to retain voting
majority with his partners.

323
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:41,747
No, I have absolutely
no intention whatsoever

324
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:44,250
of giving up my practice.

325
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:46,486
Oh! Oh, my God, George,

326
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:48,354
I love you so much right now!

327
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:49,622
I was freaking out!

328
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:51,157
I know.

329
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:52,458
Oh! Okay,
so you know what?

330
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,360
We will just pretend
like we thought about it,

331
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:57,596
and after their Thanksgiving,

332
00:13:57,597 --> 00:13:59,464
we will just tell them no.

333
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:02,267
Exactly. And then we can
celebrate this day

334
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:03,935
like it's meant to be.

335
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:06,204
With a fish fry, ruffled shirts

336
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:07,071
and eye patches!

337
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,806
Arrgh!

338
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,308
There you two are!

339
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:15,346
Oh, I was just on my way to buy
a few things for tomorrow.

340
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:16,980
Lemon, would you like to come?

341
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,517
Of course!

342
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:23,020
Shopping with you, Clora?
Is there anything better?

343
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:29,925
Hey-o!

344
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:31,294
Whatcha working on, hoss?

345
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:32,928
This was my grandmama's.
Just trying to fix it

346
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:34,864
so I can give it back to her
for her birthday.

347
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:36,199
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

348
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,168
Look, you got your
capacitors all wrong here.

349
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,969
Check me out.

350
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,804
Okay, no polarity.

351
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:42,604
Mm-hmm.

352
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,739
Yes polarity.

353
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,074
So you put that in wrong,

354
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:48,310
when you plug it in,
it will explode.

355
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:52,047
No more grandmama's radio,
no more fingers.

356
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:52,681
Gotcha!

357
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:54,316
What?

358
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:55,517
This radio was a Wade trap.

359
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:57,752
And you stuck
your big paw in it.

360
00:14:57,753 --> 00:14:59,353
Now you're mine.

361
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:00,555
I don't know what you're
talking about.

362
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:01,855
You lied to me

363
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:03,957
this morning.
You can do electrical work.

364
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,295
So? Maybe I didn't feel like
installing

365
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:10,531
your new fuse box. So what?

366
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:12,132
Exactly.
The question is why?

367
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:15,835
After all, every time it blows,
Zoe comes stomping over

368
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:17,571
and yells at you.

369
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:20,240
But you know what Lavon Hayes
figured out?

370
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:23,343
That only crackpots talk in
the third person?

371
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:27,480
Ah, Lavon Hayes figured out that
you like Zoe coming over,

372
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:30,416
which means you like Zoe.

373
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,117
Look, if by "like" you mean
I'd do her?

374
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:34,653
Sure, you got me.
I'd do her.

375
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:36,589
But I'm not that picky.

376
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,123
Mmm-mm, mmm-mm.
By "like," I mean

377
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:42,993
<i>you love... her.</i>

378
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:43,728
Hey.

379
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,963
You are in big trouble.

380
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:48,366
- What? - You know what
I just realized? A month ago

381
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,668
you made a doctor's appointment
and then you canceled it.

382
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:53,070
At least this guy had the good
sense to need stitches.

383
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:54,638
I had a sore throat,
and it went away.

384
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,706
What's the big deal?

385
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:57,274
Canceled patients don't count!

386
00:15:57,275 --> 00:16:00,277
Brick is about to take over the
practice, and I need patients.

387
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:02,546
Zoe, I'd like to help you
out, but the thing is

388
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:04,214
there nothing's bothering me.

389
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:07,417
I-I don't want to be unethical
I'm the mayor of this town.

390
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:10,553
Ow! Oh, ow! Ow!

391
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,255
Now something's bothering you.

392
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:14,257
Come on. Just stop in, and
then we'll go to the airport.

393
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,060
Oh, yeah, Lavon.

394
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,529
Mmm! She is a real catch.

395
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:27,435
That's three patients,
which brings me to 30%,

396
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:29,137
which also means.

397
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,639
"Ha-ha-ha, Brick Breeland."

398
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,674
If anyone needs me,
I'll be at Barney's.

399
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:34,276
- Lavon, let's go.
- Not so fast.

400
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:39,013
They just came in,
and they specifically asked

401
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:41,316
for someone who was not you.

402
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:44,385
So I wouldn't head
to that airport quite yet.

403
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:45,286
You're still one shy.

404
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:53,362
Caleb, are you okay?

405
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:56,131
Me pirate fingers be aching.

406
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:58,701
Dr. Hart, your services are
not needed here.

407
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:00,401
Let me help.
Caleb is my patient.

408
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:02,537
- Yeah, he was your patient.
- Exactly.

409
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:04,973
Allergic reaction, my foot.

410
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:07,508
He wasn't in pain this morning.
That's new.

411
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:08,710
Let me examine him.

412
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,211
Look, Dr. Hart,
maybe you should

413
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:13,181
see me about having that wax
cleaned out of your ears.

414
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:15,916
He is not your patient anymore.
Now go.

415
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,218
Please go!

416
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:22,022
What are his other symptoms?

417
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:23,490
Joint pain and itchiness
are all we got.

418
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:26,694
Blood panel including CBC,

419
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:29,296
chem 7 and tox screen?

420
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:31,331
- Brick has no idea what Caleb has.
- Nope.

421
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:34,133
So if I diagnose him first,

422
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:36,936
then maybe his mother
will rename me as his doctor.

423
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:41,841
You'd also have the satisfaction
of treating a sick kid.

424
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:43,643
That, too.

425
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:45,111
Shady, I gotta tell ya

426
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:47,413
I am a little surprised that
you want to sell the store.

427
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:50,348
I mean, Nate's Hardware has

428
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:53,051
been in your family for,
forever. And this price?

429
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,087
I mean, I gotta say, no offense,

430
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,923
but it's a little low,
don't you think?

431
00:17:57,924 --> 00:18:01,426
Yeah, but, uh, you know,

432
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,294
it's, it's about
a life change, George.

433
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:06,230
I mean, I've been tied to my
great-grandpa's store

434
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:07,598
for way too long now.

435
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,734
And my family and I, we're just
ready to move on.

436
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:13,203
Wait. Are you leaving BlueBell?

437
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:14,739
Let's face it, George.

438
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,507
There's bigger and better out
there in this world.

439
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:18,275
And I intend to find it.

440
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:21,678
Wow.

441
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,514
Well, okay. I will draw up
the paperwork for you.

442
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:27,717
And I'll see you, say,
this afternoon?

443
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:29,853
All right.
Thank you much, George.

444
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:31,254
You're welcome.

445
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:34,957
- How ya doing?
- Afternoon.

446
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,694
Real estate deals?

447
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:40,763
A paralegal could handle that.

448
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:42,364
Hell, a secretary could.

449
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:43,766
Yeah. I don't mind it.

450
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,134
Well, it's a waste of time

451
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:47,136
that could be used doing things
of value.

452
00:18:47,137 --> 00:18:51,439
That's the beauty of working
with a large firm-- resources.

453
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,979
My secretary's at
the beauty salon.

454
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,380
- Uh-huh.
- It's a standing appointment.

455
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,982
George Tucker.

456
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:04,451
Okay, itching and joint pain
could indicate

457
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:05,553
a hundred different things.

458
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:06,954
Did Caleb give any other clues?

459
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:09,189
Only about marauding
and swashbuckling.

460
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,160
Well, the kid's clearly weird.
Maybe there's a clue in that.

461
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:15,261
He's not weird. He's ten, Zoe.

462
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:16,329
And this is how

463
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,664
ten-year-old boys behave.

464
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:19,599
Yeah, and ten-year-olds
are weird.

465
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,701
This how I nearly failed
my peds rotation.

466
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,936
I need more information.

467
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:24,837
I need eyes and ears
in that room.

468
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:26,906
Hey, this is
a great magazine.

469
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:28,741
Who knew electrophysiologists shop

470
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:31,143
for bulk toilet paper
just like us?

471
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:33,278
- Oh, we need to get to the airport.
- Lavon...

472
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:36,281
How much do you love me?

473
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:38,017
Why?

474
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:45,724
Oh, hey, this isn't
the bathroom.

475
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:48,626
What's up, Captain No Beard?

476
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:53,198
There's something

477
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:56,166
very soothing about
shelling peas, isn't there?

478
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:59,002
Reminds me of a simpler time,

479
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:01,805
a time when family
meant everything.

480
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:06,744
You know, you and I are going
to be family very soon,

481
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:09,679
so I think it's time
we had a frank conversation.

482
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:12,248
Whatever about, Clora?

483
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:15,384
Lemon, you don't have
to pretend.

484
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:18,687
We both know that things
aren't right between us.

485
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:21,124
We've gotten off
on the wrong foot,

486
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,960
and I'm big enough to admit
that's all my fault.

487
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:28,797
I had a practice
in BlueBell, too, son.

488
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,634
I, I know that small town law
can get a little, uh, small.

489
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:34,069
Yeah, I mean,

490
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,437
Lovey Swann over at the
library is actually having me

491
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:39,407
sue Parker Mason over
an overdue library book.

492
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,878
But, Dad, come on,
you, you know

493
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:45,312
I love helping
out my community.

494
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:47,614
You could still help them.

495
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:48,849
With a big firm behind you,

496
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,484
you could make
some real changes around here.

497
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:53,153
Class actions, defense teams.

498
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:54,487
Lemon, I get it.

499
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:56,823
Why in the world would you
let George take this job?

500
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:58,491
You don't want him around us

501
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:01,161
because you don't want
to be around us.

502
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:04,998
I mean, you have been a,
a tad bit critical of me.

503
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,900
I've been a judgmental hag.

504
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:09,067
I know what kind
of lawyer you are.

505
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,670
More importantly, I know
what kind of man you are.

506
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,274
The crazy part is,

507
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,409
I always wanted a girl,

508
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,411
but instead, just boys.

509
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,516
And here you are,
the daughter I always wanted,

510
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:29,653
and instead of embracing you,
I turn my back.

511
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:30,587
Truth is...

512
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,193
your brother doesn't have
half your smarts

513
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:36,694
or half your heart.

514
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,063
I need you at my firm, son.

515
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:44,067
George, I need you.

516
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:51,842
Lemon,

517
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:55,411
I know you've missed having
a mother in your life.

518
00:21:55,412 --> 00:21:58,347
And I want to be that for you.

519
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,755
Well?

520
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:09,325
I heard coughing and
Caleb said he was dizzy.

521
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:10,559
Anything else?
Anything at all?

522
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,262
Uh... He was scratching
behind his ear a lot.

523
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:17,798
Huh.

524
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,267
Maybe he finally does
have a rash.

525
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:20,902
Could you go look at it?

526
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:22,737
Are you crazy?

527
00:22:22,738 --> 00:22:25,874
The mayor of BlueBell can't be
creeping around exam rooms.

528
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,675
And how many times can I lose
my way to the bathroom?

529
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:42,856
Oh, for Pete's sake!

530
00:22:50,964 --> 00:22:52,899
Hey, babe.

531
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,934
- Hi.
- I was just going to call you.

532
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:56,635
Listen, I've been thinking--

533
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:58,537
I know it isn't
what we discussed,

534
00:22:58,538 --> 00:23:01,106
but maybe we should consider
your father's offer.

535
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:04,009
That's funny, 'cause Lemon,

536
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,511
I was thinking
the exact same thing, I mean...

537
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:09,281
it turns out my dad really does
want me there, and...

538
00:23:09,282 --> 00:23:11,349
And it's a great
career opportunity.

539
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,685
Plus, your mother and I
have had a breakthrough.

540
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:18,188
Really? Wow.

541
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,291
So we're really doing this?

542
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:24,161
I think we are--
Senior Associate Tucker.

543
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:31,568
So, did you see the rash?

544
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:34,170
No rash. It was
just salt residue.

545
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:35,939
We're back to square one.

546
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,007
Why would Caleb have
salt behind his ear?

547
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:41,444
Like salt water? Residue you get
from swimming in the ocean.

548
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:43,679
Okay, so Caleb has been
swimming in the bay.

549
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,780
Maybe there's something
in that.

550
00:23:44,781 --> 00:23:47,450
Itching, joint pain,

551
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:49,084
ocean...

552
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:54,656
- Zoe, you okay? - Addie, I know what's
wrong with Caleb. Call an ambulance.

553
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:06,225
- You've been scuba diving, haven't you?
- Are you out of your mind?

554
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:08,260
Caleb is only ten years old.

555
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:10,395
He doesn't even know
how to scuba dive.

556
00:24:10,396 --> 00:24:13,498
This morning he said he was sailing
the seven seas looking for treasure.

557
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:16,835
He also told me he made his
principal walk the plank.

558
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:19,671
Maybe we should dredge
the bay for Mr. Babcock.

559
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:22,306
- Caleb...
- Me name be Captain Cal No Beard.

560
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:25,443
Fine. Captain No Beard, you have
to tell the truth right now.

561
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:28,246
If you've been diving, you're only
going to get sicker and sicker.

562
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:30,914
How dare you scare him.
He's just a boy.

563
00:24:30,915 --> 00:24:33,350
Look, you are out of this room,
you are out of this practice.

564
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:35,152
Me hast been diving.

565
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:36,286
What do you mean?

566
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:37,921
You don't know how
to scuba dive.

567
00:24:37,922 --> 00:24:40,724
Me brother Nate taught me.

568
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:42,459
Me robbed him of his suit.

569
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:46,396
And took to the bay.

570
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:47,830
Nate has scuba gear

571
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:49,432
because he's 17
and taken lessons.

572
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:51,434
Caleb, what were you thinking?

573
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:54,437
Becky, Caleb has
decompression sickness.

574
00:24:54,438 --> 00:24:56,439
It's what divers
call the bends.

575
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,709
We have an ambulance coming, and he needs to
get into a hyperbaric chamber right away.

576
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,378
I know it sounds scary,
but as long as we

577
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:04,946
take care of it quickly he'll be fine.
And when he comes back,

578
00:25:04,947 --> 00:25:06,848
he'll come in for
a follow-up with me.

579
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:14,890
See, Crickett, it was all
just a big misunderstanding

580
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:18,025
like she was a mama lion
protecting her cub.

581
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:19,927
Montgomery?

582
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:22,263
I still can't believe
you're going to be bi-citial.

583
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:23,931
Crickett, that's
not even a word, sweetie.

584
00:25:23,932 --> 00:25:27,635
But BlueBell
will always be my home.

585
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:29,704
But what about
your civic duties?

586
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:31,573
How are we gonna
get on without you?

587
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:35,342
Oh, well, you'll
just have to forge on.

588
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,911
Oh, if you'll excuse me,

589
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,714
I have to go help my future
in-laws shop for Thanksgiving.

590
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:42,949
I can't believe George
caved so quickly.

591
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,353
- Nice work today.
- Well, I knew Lemon was key

592
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:47,754
- to getting him on board.
- Mm-hmm.

593
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,490
Of course, I practically
had to promise to breastfeed her

594
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,359
to get her over on our side.

595
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:03,736
You know, Shady,
you coming in earlier,

596
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:06,971
you, uh, you sort of inspired
me to make a change, too.

597
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:08,607
Oh, yeah? How's that?

598
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:13,278
Well, I... I'm going
to close up shop here,

599
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,647
and I'm going to go
join a larger firm.

600
00:26:15,648 --> 00:26:19,751
Congratulations, George.
That's-- that's great.

601
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:23,354
Is everything okay, Shady?

602
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:24,388
Hold on a sec.

603
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:26,757
Of course.

604
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:29,159
Hello?

605
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,428
I'll be right there.

606
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:33,464
Wait, Shady, what...? Shady?

607
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:35,299
Come... oh!

608
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,967
Turn around.

609
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:38,934
Come on.

610
00:26:38,935 --> 00:26:41,504
Thought you were taking
Zoe to the airport.

611
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,576
She had a last-minute
medical emergency,

612
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:48,578
- so, she got a later flight.
- Oh.

613
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,146
Said she'll call
when she's ready.

614
00:26:50,147 --> 00:26:52,715
You know, I've been thinking,
if you did like Zoe...

615
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:54,949
I don't, all right?

616
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,585
Uh-huh. So, my idea--

617
00:26:56,586 --> 00:26:58,587
you take her to the airport.

618
00:26:58,588 --> 00:27:02,223
Tell her how you feel right
before she gets on the plane.

619
00:27:02,224 --> 00:27:05,160
Now, if she feels the same,
you have yourself a nice,

620
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:07,262
romantic, airport good-bye kiss.

621
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:09,130
If she doesn't,

622
00:27:09,131 --> 00:27:12,566
she gets on the plane,
and no one has to talk about it.

623
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,237
I don't like her, okay?

624
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,809
Mm-hmm.

625
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,779
Now, if you please.

626
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,680
Flight leaves at 8:00.

627
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:29,148
Hmm.

628
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,056
There you two are!

629
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,459
I made a reservation
for us at Fancie's

630
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,727
in a half an hour.

631
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:41,993
Harold, a martini?

632
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,261
Sounds good to me.

633
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:47,232
Great. Oh, and I got that gouda
you like, Mama.

634
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:49,435
It is okay
if I call you Mama, right?

635
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,909
- Shady!
- Caleb, are you okay?

636
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,244
I'm sorry.

637
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,079
Why were
you scuba diving?

638
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,147
I wanted
to find the pirate treasure.

639
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,582
What-What pirate treasure?

640
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,283
From the ship
in the Planksgiving story.

641
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:09,152
I thought if I could find it,

642
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:10,887
you wouldn't have
to sell the store,

643
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:13,657
and we wouldn't have to
move in with Aunt Glenese,

644
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:16,360
and you wouldn't have to go away
to look for work.

645
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,427
We could stay a family.

646
00:28:22,098 --> 00:28:24,933
Look, I... I didn't want anyone
to know.

647
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:27,503
All right? Everyone's
been buying their supplies

648
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:29,071
off the Internet lately.

649
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:36,478
Son, I appreciate
what you tried to do, but...

650
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:38,713
there isn't any pirate treasure.

651
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:40,948
It's just some story
somebody made up

652
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:42,684
a long time ago.

653
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:46,721
We should go.

654
00:28:52,894 --> 00:28:54,728
Wait!

655
00:28:56,163 --> 00:28:58,999
I don't want it anymore.

656
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,301
If there's no treasure,

657
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:03,470
I can't help them.

658
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,941
I just wanted my family
to stay together.

659
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,684
Hey.

660
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:22,955
So, we going to the
airport or what?

661
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,910
A ten-year-old

662
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:34,145
with the bends.

663
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:35,545
I mean, I can't believe it.

664
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:37,081
No, you can't blame
yourself about that.

665
00:29:37,082 --> 00:29:39,116
Me, on the other hand--
I mean, Shady Hilson wanting

666
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:41,251
to sell his hardware store--
I should have known better.

667
00:29:41,252 --> 00:29:43,053
George, you never
could have known.

668
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:45,389
Neither of us could have, but...

669
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,025
- We're gonna have to figure out a way
to help them. - I completely agree.

670
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,628
What happened to Lavon?

671
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:55,898
Uh, yeah, well, I, uh...

672
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:58,001
I happened to be going
to the airport anyway,

673
00:29:58,002 --> 00:29:59,702
so...

674
00:29:59,703 --> 00:30:02,638
I do that sometimes
to visit my buddy

675
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:05,875
the, uh... bag guy.

676
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:10,078
So, it's not a special
trip or anything.

677
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,613
You know, kids--

678
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:14,983
they get so caught up
in stories and fantasies.

679
00:30:14,984 --> 00:30:19,087
You feel like a jerk when
their little hearts get broken.

680
00:30:19,088 --> 00:30:21,223
Really don't know what
you're talking about.

681
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:24,125
So, the airport?

682
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:27,694
Hey, y'all, can you give us a
ride back to the Breeland house?

683
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:30,231
We got a lot of work to do, and
every minute's gonna count.

684
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:32,133
- Uh, actually....
- Yeah, sure, hop in.

685
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:33,267
Thanks.

686
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:35,569
Is it this?

687
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,172
- But...
- No...

688
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:39,472
- Ow. Ow.
- Wade...

689
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:40,440
- Watch the...
- Ooh, sorry.

690
00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:41,641
All right.

691
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:42,842
Thank you.

692
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:43,876
Ah.

693
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:45,512
Welcome aboard.

694
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:48,415
You know, Mama,
Dad, I've been thinking.

695
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:50,316
You know, George and I don't
need our own place

696
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:51,751
in Montgomery
for only three days a week.

697
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:52,885
We can just stay with you.

698
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:54,554
Won't that be

699
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:56,821
- so cozy?
- Of course, dear.

700
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:58,257
Oh, we can play charades
every night.

701
00:30:58,258 --> 00:30:59,058
I just love charades.

702
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,025
Don't you?

703
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,927
Wait. Guess this one.

704
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:11,369
Sure hope we're not
late to the airport.

705
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,870
Somebody's got a
plane to catch.

706
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,505
You know
what we should do?

707
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,107
- We should call the town council.
- Yeah.

708
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,741
They got to have some jobs
for, uh... for Nate's.

709
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,810
You guys are gonna help Caleb
and his family?

710
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,145
You're more
than welcome to join us

711
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,547
if you want to change
your travel plans.

712
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,282
No, my mom's expecting me.

713
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:26,150
I already saved the kid's life,
got him to the hospital.

714
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:27,618
What more could I do?

715
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,352
Well, you know, my
business card says doctor,

716
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:30,454
and George's says lawyer,

717
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,155
but those titles
don't begin to explain

718
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,991
what people like us mean
to the community.

719
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,593
I mean, BlueBell counts on us.

720
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:36,927
What are you gonna do?

721
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,029
Find the Hilsons some
Planksgiving buried treasure?

722
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,931
You don't get it.

723
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,165
You know, years ago,

724
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,300
when BlueBell was leveled

725
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:46,703
by that hurricane,
and people lost everything,

726
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,838
most of all, they lost hope.

727
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,607
They were talking
about moving out,

728
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,375
deserting the town
and-and starting over,

729
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:57,714
but the town's founder,
Cyrus Lavinius Jeremiah Jones,

730
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,115
you know, he got together
with some of the town leaders.

731
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:01,249
They spent

732
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,985
the whole night fishing,

733
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:05,954
and the next morning,
there was food for everyone.

734
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:08,690
Yeah. Then, when people asked,

735
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:10,692
"Where did it all come from?"

736
00:32:10,693 --> 00:32:14,229
that's when Cyrus made up that
story about friendly pirates.

737
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,330
I knew there weren't pirates.

738
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:19,233
Yeah, no pirates.

739
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:20,668
Just neighbor helping neighbor.

740
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:22,302
That's what got

741
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:24,772
BlueBell back upon
its feet then, after Katrina,

742
00:32:24,773 --> 00:32:26,974
after whatever came to
try and knock her down.

743
00:32:26,975 --> 00:32:28,643
You know what?

744
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:30,678
Like, the costumes,
the pirate stuff--

745
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:32,512
that's all just meant
to be fun.

746
00:32:32,513 --> 00:32:34,280
This holiday is really
about community.

747
00:32:36,984 --> 00:32:39,019
Yeah.

748
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:43,222
- Dad?
- Mm?

749
00:32:43,223 --> 00:32:45,258
Do you play tennis?

750
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:46,826
- Why do you ask?
- I was thinking

751
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,894
we should join a doubles
tennis league in Montgomery.

752
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:50,362
I don't know how to play,

753
00:32:50,363 --> 00:32:52,698
but I was hoping that
you could teach me.

754
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:55,167
Wouldn't that be a kick?

755
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:58,270
- Hey.
- Oh, there you two are.

756
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:00,238
We have reservations
for a celebration dinner

757
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,908
- at Fancie's in ten minutes. - I know,
and I'm sorry to have to do this,

758
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:04,776
but... y'all are gonna
have to go without us.

759
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:06,144
I've got a client
who needs help.

760
00:33:06,145 --> 00:33:07,912
What client?
You're working for me now.

761
00:33:07,913 --> 00:33:09,947
I'm sorry. Did you not hear
someone needs his help?

762
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:12,483
Look, Dad, this is
really important, okay?

763
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:14,351
So y'all are gonna have
to go without us tonight,

764
00:33:14,352 --> 00:33:15,987
and we'll see you back
here in the morning?

765

00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:29,392
Well...

794
00:34:29,393 --> 00:34:32,027
Good morning, Clora,
Harold, come on in.

795
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,296
Ah.

796
00:34:33,297 --> 00:34:36,231
Correct me

797
00:34:36,232 --> 00:34:39,034
if I'm wrong,
but didn't we agree

798
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,470
to have Thanksgiving today?

799
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:42,738
I've prepared a meal.

800
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,407
I know,
I-I'm really sorry,

801
00:34:44,408 --> 00:34:45,640
but something important
came up.

802
00:34:45,641 --> 00:34:46,908
It turns out
that Shady Hilson was--

803
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,777
he was going to close
his hardware shop,

804
00:34:48,778 --> 00:34:50,345
so Brick and I--

805
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:52,146
well, we spent the whole
night calling all over town

806
00:34:52,147 --> 00:34:53,615
and looking for
help, and, well,

807
00:34:53,616 --> 00:34:56,651
you see these?

808
00:34:56,652 --> 00:35:00,188
All pledges to buy exclusively
from Nate's Hardware.

809
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:01,822
Yeah, it should be
enough to keep him

810
00:35:01,823 --> 00:35:03,390
up and running for
a good long time.

811
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:04,591
Lawyers don't beg for money,

812
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:07,294
especially on behalf
of a man too stupid

813
00:35:07,295 --> 00:35:09,330
- to manage his own finances.
- Whoa.

814
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:11,264
I'm not sure you heard,
Harold, but there are a lot

815
00:35:11,265 --> 00:35:12,599
of good folks
that are struggling these days.

816
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,368
And since when did helping

817
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:16,203
your neighbor turn
into a character flaw?

818
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:17,603
Well, I'm just saying,

819
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:19,271
in order to be a good
lawyer, you have to learn

820
00:35:19,272 --> 00:35:20,973
how to separate the personal
from the professional,

821
00:35:20,974 --> 00:35:24,243
and, and my son is
occasionally too soft-hearted

822
00:35:24,244 --> 00:35:25,578
for his own good.

823
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:27,580
Then what exactly are you
proud of me for, Dad, huh?

824
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:28,848
Oh, George, calm down.

825
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:30,416
You know, it's very hard
to take you seriously

826
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:31,884
when you're
in that ridiculous getup.

827
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:33,252
Hmm.

828
00:35:33,253 --> 00:35:34,653
Oh, there you are, Mama.

829
00:35:35,988 --> 00:35:37,723
I have an extra costume
picked out just for you.

830
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:40,258
We can be
mother-daughter pirates.

831
00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:41,993
I am not wearing
a pirate costume,

832
00:35:41,994 --> 00:35:43,762
and we are eating
Thanksgiving dinner.

833
00:35:43,763 --> 00:35:45,129
Oh,

834
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,531
didn't George tell you?

835
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:48,400
Plans have changed,
and you would look

836
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:50,601
so cute in an eye patch, Mama.

837
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:52,837
For the love of God,
stop calling me that!

838
00:35:57,942 --> 00:36:02,713
How my George came from your
loins, I have no earthly idea.

839
00:36:02,714 --> 00:36:04,281
How dare you?

840
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:05,415
How dare I?

841
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:08,251
My mother may not be
around anymore,

842
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:09,719
but I am not desperate enough

843
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,521
to replace her
with a conniving witch like you.

844
00:36:11,522 --> 00:36:13,790
Using a person's
vulnerabilities

845
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:16,993
to manipulate them is just--
it's downright un-Christian.

846
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:17,694
Watch your mouth, young lady.

847
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:19,328
And you!

848
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:22,097
If you can't be proud of George,
who is the most decent

849
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,132
and honorable man
that I have ever met,

850
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:25,233
well, then both of you

851

Corporate lawyers

thinking about BlueBell.

I closed up shop here?

917

to know, George,

921
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,331
that I was trying to help you.

922
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:33,900
Towns like BlueBell
are dying off.

923
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:36,103
Pretty soon you won't have
any more little guys to help.
