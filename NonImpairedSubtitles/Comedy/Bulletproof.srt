1
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,352
<i>I believe in America. </i>

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,276
<i>I believe in the American dream. </i>

3
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,471
<i>In the American way of life. </i>

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,713
<i>That every American should have a job,</i>
<i>a family and home of their own. </i>

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,955
<i>And two cars in every garage. You betcha. </i>

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,597
What does a $100,000 car do?
Play with your nuts while you drive?

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,318
That would beat cruise control.

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,878
Anyone with a $100,000 car
deserves to get it stolen and get beat up.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,638
- I'm driving.
- Hell, no.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,914
What do you mean, "No"?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,309
You drive like the kid from <i>Life Goes On. </i>

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,755
You drive like a goddamn maniac.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,912
Yell louder.
You didn't wake anybody up yet.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,999
Wrong.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,432
Did you see the size of his gun?

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,953
That was a big gun.

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,829
Hey, you said the guy wasn't home.

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,193
We got company.

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,833
Shit!

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,834
Don't kill me, man!

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,717
I got shit to do tomorrow!

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,032
God, no!

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,713
Watch it!

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,477
All right, people.

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,034
Shit!

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,399
We didn't hit them.

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,915
Happy? You messed with me.
Why are we in front of a police station?

28
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,314
Yo, officer!

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,073
Excuse me.

30
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,877
Did you smoke crack tonight?

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,518
It's going to be fine.

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,511
Could you help us?
We're trying to get to Disneyland.

33
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,950
You two are going to Disneyland?

34
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,876
This is my retarded friend.
He's from Arkansas somewhere.

35
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,555
He wants to go to Disneyland.
You want to go to Disneyland with me?

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,074
Disneyland.

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,999
See? Disneyland. Where?

38
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,999
I love the way he says that. Say it again.

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,794
Disneyland.

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,998
He loves Disneyland.
So that's where we are trying to go.

41
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,673
Go east on 10.

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,754
When you get to the 5,
go south to Anaheim.

43
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,114
There are signs everywhere.

44
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,716
The cop not only gave us directions,
my man drew us a map.

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,515
Yeah, he got me.
But you do that again, I swear to God<i>... </i>

46
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,471
Hey, baby, I got it. Let's see<i>... </i>

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,991
Get drinks for everybody.

48
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,513
Thanks, Archie.

49
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,430
To the Rock and Archie Show.

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,078
You know that.

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,070
There's something I don't understand.

52
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,433
Everything we get,
we split down the middle.

53
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,279
Of course, we're partners.

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,113
So why's your bankroll
always fatter than mine?

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,838
You got money problems?

56
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,596
No worry. It ain't no shit I can't handle.

57
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,354
Whatever's mine is yours. You know that.

58
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,033
I know that.

59
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,709
- I like that.
- Easy, lover-boy.

60
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,914
Any woman that fine
has to have a man somewhere.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,876
So?

62
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,952
You fight like Peter McNeeley.
You wanna get whupped again?

63
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,556
That's the beauty of having you around.
You got my back.

64
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,914
You hope.

65
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,949
What?

66
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,429
What do you mean "What?"
You called me over here.

67
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,873
I didn't call you over.

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,635
My friend said you wanted me to come.
He said you wanted to make out with me.

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,439
Are you kidding?

70
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,634
He's the one who said it. I will if you<i>... </i>

71
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,153
What's up?

72
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,670
What the fuck are you doing?

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,079
Oh, shit.

74
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,950
I know it looks like I was hitting on
your girlfriend, but...

75
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,875
...actually, I was hitting on her
harder than you think...

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,231
...so step the fuck back...

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,637
...before I bitch slap your fucking heinie!

78
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,474
- I'm going to kill you.
- Is there a problem?

79
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,470
Fucking snatch face is a fucking problem.

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,949
- There's things I want to do to you...
- Chill, Archie.

81
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,268
I'll bite your ear off!

82
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,076
Come on, Archie.

83
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,277
I'm trying to chill,
but Daddy-dipshit won't let me!

84
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,670
He's got me nuts with those crazy eyes
and that armpit stench!

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,316
Apparently, you got some shit to work out.

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,391
No. We worked the shit out.

87
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,350
I'm glad we worked that shit out.
I'll buy you a drink.

88
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,793
Here it comes.

89
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,670
Now it's on, motherfucker!

90
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,954
Keats!

91
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,750
Man, not like that.

92
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,791
- What's up?
- Like this.

93
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,791
That's the old-school shit.

94
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,910
Honey? Muffin?

95
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,674
Honey. How's your Twinkie?

96
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,997
Yo, man,
what kind of nasty ass-meat is that?

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,472
It looks like shit
out of Jeffrey Dahmer's refrigerator.

98
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,475
Thanks.

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,192
Okay, thank you.

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,079
I do have some shit going on.

101
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,918
The car stealing we do is fine.
I enjoy doing that with you...

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,993
...but I have serious income
coming from this guy.

103
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,432
He is the biggest drug lord in the West.
The biggest.

104
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,794
Get out of here.

105
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,479
<i>You know, Ron, of all your inventions,</i>
<i>this is probably... </i>

106
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,835
My mother uses that stuff. It works.

107
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,759
<i>And two cars in every garage. </i>

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,679
There's the man himself.

109
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,957
<i>Come to Colton Motors and fetch</i>
<i>your piece of that American dream. </i>

110
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,511
What do you do for him?

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,514
I'm the point man.

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,637
I set up jobs, meet the shipments.

113
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,790
I keep Mr. Colton happy.

114
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,710
If he's as large as you say,
he must be happy.

115
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,035
I've been thinking. You need money.

116
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,673
You're the only guy
I've ever trusted in my life.

117
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,712
I could talk to Mr. Colton
about bringing you in.

118
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,555
Yo, I'm just a petty car thief.
You're talking industrial type shit.

119
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,949
I swear, it's very, very easy.

120
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,511
- Easy, huh?
- You in?

121
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,751
I trust you. Put me down.

122
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,274
Good decision.

123
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,753
You want a ride?

124
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,154
No, I'll walk.

125
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,949
- Sure?
- Lf I can avoid driving with you, I will.

126
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,116
Okay, keep it real, son.

127
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,439
Police! Freeze!

128
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,315
Party's over.
If you move, I'll blow your brains out.

129
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,078
You're breaking my arm.

130
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,430
- You fucking pussy!
- Relax.

131
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,273
Why are you
and Black in the Hat following me?

132
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,271
We were in the neighborhood.

133
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,756
Have fun at Disneyland?

134
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,713
Here he is, Captain.

135
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,440
Did you know
you look like a struck match?

136
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,871
What's the word, Rock?

137
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,679
Jack. Whatever your name is.

138
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,636
The word is, <i>El Capitán... </i>

139
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,196
...this last year of my life
is about to pay off.

140
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,039
What are you saying?

141
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,673
What I'm telling you is...

142
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,513
...Archie Moses is taking me
to meet the man.

143
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,637
Finally, Frank Colton is going down.

144
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,468
Congratulations, Jack.

145
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,438
Bringing down Colton
will make your career.

146
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,951
I don't care about that.

147
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,278
I care about putting that scumbag
behind bars.

148
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,272
There's a shipment coming into San Pedro
next week. It's supposed to be huge.

149
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,079
When do you meet Colton?

150
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,071
Moses is introducing me tomorrow.

151
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,428
Wear a wire.

152
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,794
I don't know.

153
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,992
It's a good idea to wear a wire.

154
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,033
I'll sleep on it.

155
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,873
"Disneyland. "

156
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,875
What?

157
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,595
Nothing. Just something Archie did.
He's crazy.

158
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,591
You getting sweet on this guy?

159
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,992
- No.
- Listen to me.

160
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,675
You pal around with someone
long enough...

161
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,320
...you forget he's the bad guy.

162
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,110
Tell me about yourself, Mr. Keats.

163
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,869
Well, there ain't much to say.

164
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,510
I did some time for breaking and entering.
Armed robbery.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,831
Petty shit like that.

166
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,117
What about references?
You trust this man, Moses?

167
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,069
Mr. Colton, I trust him with my life.

168
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,713
That's good.

169
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,154
Because trust is an important commodity
in business.

170
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,830
True that, true that.

171
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,952
True that.

172
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,752
I'll tell you who I trust. I trust Moses here.

173
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,639
Thank you.

174
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,908
And I trust my colleague, Mr. Bledsoe.

175
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,035
But most importantly,
I want to tell you who I don't trust.

176
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,919
I don't trust you.

177
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,040
I don't trust you 'cause I don't know you.

178
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,029
Search him.

179
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,475
This is bullshit. I won't search him.

180
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,832
You search him, not because you want to,
but because you have to, understand?

181
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,314
Jesus.

182
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,639
Mo, this is like some embarrassing shit.

183
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,597
I know this guy like I know myself.

184
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,240
If he's a cop, I'll suck your dick.

185
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,873
I'm sorry, bro.

186
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,632
See, no wires.

187
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,432
Well, hell, search him.

188
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,154
Nothing.

189
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,673
Well, fine.

190
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,077
If you don't ask, you never know.
Understand?

191
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,514
Remember...

192
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,913
...nobody moves until Jack lets us know
Colton is on the premises.

193
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,913
- Listen, Cap.
- Yes, Jack?

194
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,510
Let me bring Archie in.

195
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,355
A lot of testosterone will be flying around.

196
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,716
I don't want some overzealous asshole
denting Archie.

197
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,991
I knew it.
You are sweet on the son of a bitch.

198
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,517
- I know him. He's not that bad.
- He's a lowlife scumbag.

199
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,591
Then he's my lowlife scumbag.

200
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,636
When this is over,
maybe I can help him get his life together.

201
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,199
You look tense. Relax. It'll be fine.

202
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,070
Relax. It's just a friendly doggie.

203
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,151
How are you, buddy?

204
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,638
You like that? See? He's licking me.
He loves me.

205
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,038
He just licked his balls
and he's getting rid of the bad taste.

206
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,430
Hey, <i>Ese</i>, don't shoot. It's me.

207
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,154
How you doing?

208
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,871
Colton didn't mention a new guy.

209
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,749
Rigo, meet Rock Keats, <i>mi amigo. </i>

210
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,640
Yo, what's up?

211
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,517
What is it about you?
Nobody likes you except me.

212
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,277
What you see there is 100 percent uncut...

213
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,430
...grade A heroin.

214
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,912
Where's your boy, Colton?

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,230
He'll be here to check on my shit.

216
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,752
Let's go. Up, up.

217
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,719
Good job. A little quicker.

218
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,193
What you keep looking around for?

219
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,475
Back off me, son. What's your problem?

220
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,358
What are you looking for?
That's my problem!

221
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,349
- Relax, man.
- You tell Tattoo something.

222
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,109
This fucking <i>maricón</i> makes me nervous.

223
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,029
He acts like a cop.

224
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,396
Well, he's not a cop.
He's my friend. So relax.

225
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,159
- I don't know that.
- You think he's a cop?

226
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,793
Damn it, he's not.

227
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,599
Take a look. Satisfied, scumbag?

228
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,751
You fucking piece of shit!

229
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,639
- Move.
- What about Colton?

230
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,235
The hell with Colton!
Everybody, move now!

231
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,790
Archie Moses, you're under arrest.

232
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,918
- You better be joking.
- You have the right to remain silent...

233
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,195
You were like my brother!

234
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,470
How can you do this to me?

235
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,118
Moses, stop!

236
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,111
What the fuck is wrong with you?

237
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,952
No one hurts him.

238
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,113
Come on, Moses.

239
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,509
If you come out now,
maybe we can make a deal.

240
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,513
Don't talk to me about deals,
you lying sack of shit!

241
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,831
Come on. Give yourself up.

242
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,071
You're going to get killed here.

243
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,758
Okay, Officer Keats, I'm coming out.
Don't shoot.

244
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,674
Come on, Moses.

245
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,912
I'll blow this dog's head off his body.
Drop your goddamn gun!

246
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,076
No, you won't. You love animals.

247
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,119
I hate dogs!
Get out of here, you stupid, ugly dog!

248
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,391
I'm trying to save your life.

249
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,754
Fuck you!

250
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,999
No. God, no, no.

251
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,918
Jack's down.

252
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,313
Get that son of a bitch! Get him!

253
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,753
Bledsoe, it got all fucked up in there.
Where were you guys?

254
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,591
We had a flat tire, asshole.

255
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,113
Damn it!

256
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,552
This little fuck-up of yours cost me
millions of dollars. I'm very mad.

257
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,399
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

258
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,959
"I'll suck<i>... </i>" No.

259
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,555
"If he's a cop, I'll suck your dick. "
That was the quote.

260
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,595
I don't think I did say that.
Maybe Bledsoe said it.

261
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,957
Here's your last meal. I hope you enjoy it.

262
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,508
Don't do this, please.
You don't need to do this.

263
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,636
Get this damn mutt off me!

264
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,590
You slimy rat-bastard!

265
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,992
Let's move it.

266
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,308
- Blood pressure's dropping.
- He's bleeding.

267
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,071
<i>To the Rock and Archie Show. </i>

268
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,752
<i>You know that. </i>

269
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,794
How long?

270
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,273
<i>I mean, you're the only guy</i>
<i>I've ever trusted in my life. </i>

271
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,999
<i>Disneyland. </i>

272
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,673
Welcome back.

273
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,472
Take it easy for now.

274
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,959
Getting back on your feet won't be easy,
but...

275
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,798
...you're in good hands.

276
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,190
- This is Traci Flynn, our physical therapist.
- Hi.

277
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,673
Keep me posted.

278
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,753
Good.

279
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,674
Bring it down.

280
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,271
Come on, Jack.
I want you to make it to the end of the bar.

281
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,798
Pull it forward.

282
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,110
Put your weight on it. Now the other one.

283
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,270
Five, five, let's go.

284
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,678
You're doing real good.

285
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,230
Come on, Jack. You're ready for this.

286
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,198
I'm proud of you.

287
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,038
The ghost himself.

288
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,839
Not even a bullet in the head
could stop him.

289
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,517
A millimeter to the right or left,
and he'd be dead.

290
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,469
I wouldn't want to have to mess with him.

291
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,035
Sir!

292
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,109
Sir!

293
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,758
Where are you headed, sir?

294
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,711
Mexico. I have to start my life over.
I'm going to be a bullfighter.

295
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,711
Have you been drinking, sir?

296
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,837
I had about half a beer,
but the dog had a lot.

297
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,157
Would you step out of the car
and walk a straight line?

298
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,037
Yeah, no problem.

299
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,114
So you got Moses.
What has it to do with me?

300
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,953
Moses is going to turn state's evidence.

301
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,872
He's rolling on Colton?

302
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,948
Colton wasn't happy
Moses brought a cop into his organization.

303
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,549
He's had a hit on him ever since.

304
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,439
Now that Moses is up against it...

305
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,989
...he's ready to give us Colton on a platter.

306
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,469
Jack, Steve Finch, DEA. He's in charge.

307
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,471
And what is he getting out of this?

308
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,834
Commuted sentence.

309
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,876
- How commuted?
- To be determined.

310
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,350
- Bullshit! How commuted?
- Jack, take it easy.

311
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,352
You want me to take it easy?
That asshole shot me in the head.

312
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,113
Now this bigger asshole
is letting him get away with it.

313
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,390
Jack, that's not how it happened.

314
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,153
- Moses will do the time...
- You know what?

315
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,437
You and the DEA figure that out.
Leave me out of it.

316
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,194
Hold on, Jack.

317
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,078
The deal with Moses:

318
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,073
One condition.

319
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,193
What condition?

320
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,874
I don't know why he wants you
to bring him in and I don't care!

321
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,031
With him, we finish what we started.

322
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,596
You don't have to be afraid.
We'll send in a team for backup.

323
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,672
You think I'm afraid of Moses?

324
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,470
After the way you treated him, I wouldn't
be surprised if he put another bullet...

325
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,510
Jack, it's okay. Take it easy.

326
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,079
You're right, Stench.

327
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,158
I am afraid of Moses.

328
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,515
I'm afraid if I see him again, I'll kill him.

329
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,919
Come on.

330
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,832
What do you know about it?

331
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,480
Let someone else bring Moses in.

332
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,594
As far as I'm concerned, this shit is over.

333
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,316
You know,
your cop buddies all say the same thing.

334
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,600
They say you're not the same man, Jack.

335
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,714
When you got shot, you lost something.

336
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,439
I didn't even know you then, but...

337
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,439
...I think they're right.

338
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,114
- What do you mean? I'm happy.
- Come on.

339
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,911
You pretend you like your job when
it makes you miserable 8 hours a day.

340
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,116
You pretend Moses doesn't exist...

341
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,078
...which makes you miserable
24 hours a day.

342
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,719
If you don't finish this thing with Moses<i>... </i>

343
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,753
Come here.

344
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,750
You're right, as usual.

345
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,594
You're right.

346
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,270
Okay, little Keats, sit.

347
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,358
Good doggie. Now beg for your life.

348
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,632
That's right, little Keats.

349
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,314
Come on, you can do it. Cry.

350
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,558
No good. Bang.

351
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,833
Got ya!

352
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,436
Poor little boy.

353
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,592
I'm surprised you showed up.

354
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,877
Why isn't this prisoner in cuffs?

355
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,394
There he goes, being a cop again.

356
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,948
- He wasn't going anywhere.
- You cuff him...

357
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,558
...arms, legs, feet.

358
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,949
I want his asshole cuffed to his nuts.

359
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,196
Then put him on the plane.

360
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,559
Before you do that. See you later, buddy.

361
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,310
Man's best friend, right here.

362
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,710
You like that? Look at that.
He's licking me 'cause he likes to.

363
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,917
Not 'cause he's trying to get close to me
and then fuck me over.

364
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,798
Do I speak with an accent?

365
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,071
- No.
- Then cuff the prisoner!

366
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,550
Don't you want to know
why I asked for you, Keats?

367
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,518
I know why.
You want to finish what you started.

368
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,592
I'm warning you, Moses...

369
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,155
...I'm looking for an excuse to kill you.

370
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,310
If you sneeze, if you fart...

371
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,358
...if I even smell your breath,
I will shoot you dead.

372
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,195
What if I chew loud?
When I eat, I chew loud.

373
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,519
Will you shoot me?

374
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,195
I won't try anything.
And you are so wrong about that day.

375
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,190
I don't want to hear nothing you have
to say about any subject, at any time.

376
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,038
And, yes, I will shoot you if you chew loud.

377
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,799
Man down! Sniper!

378
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,917
- They want to kill me!
- On the plane!

379
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,591
Hustle! Let's go!

380
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,912
What's going on up there?

381
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,154
- The pilot's dead.
- I have 1,000 hours.

382
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,591
- What?
- I got 1,000 hours flying.

383
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,990
- Bullshit.
- Colton's in the import<i>I</i>export business.

384
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,954
Here, buddy. Sorry, sorry.

385
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,793
Come on, fly this thing.

386
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,075
No, not until you apologize to me.

387
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,390
- What?
- Apologize! You did some shitty shit.

388
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,952
You better hurry.

389
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,152
Fly this plane or you'll experience death
then <i>déjá vu. </i>

390
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,071
Fly the plane!

391
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,912
You are a bad person, man.

392
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,557
I can actually taste my nuts.

393
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,108
Oh, you're killing me again!

394
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,551
Mayday. Does anyone read?

395
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,189
"Mayday"? Is this a Kirk Douglas movie?

396
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,992
Is everything a joke?

397
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,231
You're wasting your time anyway.

398
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,232
Can we make LA?

399
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,278
Not without gas.

400
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,196
They blew our gas tanks.

401
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,119
Oh, shit!

402
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,079
We'll probably crash head first, right?

403
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,589
I'll be in the back, on the black box.

404
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,559
Here we go now! Yeah, yeah!

405
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,915
Oh, shit! Stop, stop!

406
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,271
I saved our fucking life!

407
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,712
I have some advice for you right now.
Don't move.

408
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,319
Don't move.

409
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,948
I said, "Don't move!"

410
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,157
I didn't, asshole!
The plane is starting to slip.

411
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,395
Slow.

412
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,708
Easy.

413
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,115
Don't yell.
The echo, the vibration makes it move.

414
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,390
You have to whisper. Whisper.

415
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,390
Shit! That ain't working either!

416
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,635
One...

417
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,839
...two...

418
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,239
...three!

419
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,197
That was God's way of telling you
to let me go, I think.

420
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,033
We must serve different gods.

421
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,032
Mine says to shoot you
and throw you over that cliff.

422
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,312
I don't like your god.

423
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,636
Your god scares me.

424
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,711
I'm your god right now.

425
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,960
You're a piece of shit, you know that?

426
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,799
Sometimes,
I wish that bullet had killed you.

427
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,512
Watch what you say to me.

428
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,313
That's pretty sick.

429
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,631
You pretend to be my friend for a year...

430
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,510
...then you bust my ass.

431
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,434
That takes someone really cold-blooded.
Someone not even human.

432
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,599
I was doing my job! Understand?

433
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,433
Now, bringing me in safe and sound
is your job.

434
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,433
And you're the kind of cop
who'll do his job. Am I right...

435
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,830
...Officer Keats?

436
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,074
You're right.

437
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,033
In case you're wondering
why that hurt so much...

438
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,157
...it's because I have a metal plate
in my head, thanks to you.

439
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,749
So, from now on,
you better watch what you say to me.

440
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,835
Seriously, Keats,
you blink and I am out of here.

441
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,274
Oh, really?

442
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,431
You'll get to LA
with only your ding-dong in your hands.

443
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,515
Which reminds me, I got to take a leak.

444
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,390
Piss in your pants. We're not stopping.

445
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,358
In my pants?
I haven't done that since I was 24.

446
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,595
Seriously, man. I got to take a leak.

447
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,955
I got to take a leak!

448
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,753
You have 15 seconds.

449
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,478
Fifteen seconds won't cut it.

450
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,994
I got to unzip, shake, that takes time.

451
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,432
You have 10 seconds.

452
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,312
Oh, God!

453
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,679
I know you won't believe this, but...

454
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,796
...that day you got shot...

455
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,196
...it really was an...
- Time's up.

456
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,793
- I'm not finished.
- You are.

457
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,632
Come on! I've wet pants!

458
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,115
Get up!

459
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,550
I got piss on me!

460
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,516
That was a big mistake,
making me piss my pants...

461
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,758
...'cause it's payback time.
I don't know when...

462
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,675
...but I think it'll be when you're sleeping...

463
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,955
...'cause I know you'll sleep soon enough.

464
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,879
And then, guess what?

465
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,871
I'll piss all over you.

466
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,716
See, that's worse.
It's my piss on me right now.

467
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,269
You can deal with your own piss.

468
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,077
But you'll have my piss on you,
and that's gross.

469
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,716
I'll get other people to piss on you.

470
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,519
I'll get animals to piss on you.

471
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,594
Cows, pigs.
I'll get a whole farm to piss on you.

472
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,759
What kind of weird place is this?

473
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,790
All right, they got porno.

474
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,752
Can I help you, gentlemen?

475
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,478
I need to use your phone.

476
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,068
Charlie, is it?

477
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,469
Charles.

478
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,678
I saw the sign.
You got a lot of porno here?

479
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,909
Yes. We have an excellent selection.

480
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,151
Great. I like porn.

481
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,911
Well, good.

482
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,799
Cap, it's me.

483
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,508
Someone tipped Colton off
about the pickup.

484
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,234
We got word. We heard about the attack.

485
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,433
Are you okay?

486
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,239
I'm okay. Who's there with you?

487
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,988
Finch.

488
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,310
We're in a motel, outside of Flagstaff.

489
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,399
A place called the Hunting Cap Lodge.

490
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,315
We'll find it.
We'll have someone there in the morning.

491
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,797
<i>Let's keep this between us. </i>

492
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,277
<i>We can't trust nobody right now. </i>

493
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,670
You must loose your mind
up here in the sticks, with nothing to do.

494
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,479
You whack off a lot?

495
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,153
What's "a lot"?

496
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,717
You got five minutes off, nothing to do.

497
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,595
You go into one of the rooms,
pull down your panties, whack it.

498
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,555
Excuse me.

499
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,394
We need a room.

500
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,960
You guys aren't... you know?

501
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,150
It's been a long day, just give me a room.

502
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,629
Okay...

503
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,953
...just fill this out...

504
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,475
...please.

505
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,113
Charlie, come here.

506
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,958
I want to talk to you.

507
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,270
He says he's not gay, but...

508
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,592
...let's see what some drinks
and a massage will do to him.

509
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,472
That'll gay him up, don't you think?

510
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,957
Look at the way he's standing.

511
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,829
He's not gay?

512
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,433
He's waiting for you.

513
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,240
Oh, that's<i>... </i> I don't<i>... </i>

514
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,393
That your wife back there?

515
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,710
Yeah.

516
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,552
Damn, she's hot.

517
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,515
Thank you.

518
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,193
The three of us could burn it up together,
don't you think?

519
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,599
What do you mean?

520
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,272
You know damn well what I mean.

521
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,114
Which room?

522
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,034
Let's see.

523
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,913
The only room we have available is the...

524
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,231
...honeymoon suite.

525
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,714
We'll take it.

526
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,870
Charlie, come here, please.

527
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,471
So, what do you think?

528
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,479
Me, you, the old lady,
some sandwich action?

529
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,073
What do you mean?

530
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,555
You're a piece of bread,
she's a piece of bread, I'm the salami.

531
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,117
She can't eat sandwiches now.
She's on a diet.

532
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,158
All right. Well, think about it.

533
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,355
Let's go.

534
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,238
All right. Well, enjoy your night...

535
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,397
...and thank you for staying here.

536
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,753
"You

537
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,950

"I will always love you"

549
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,760
Will you shut up? Shut the hell up!

550
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,709
Keats, you'll always be my bodyguard.
You know that.

551
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,392
Let me guess, you dropped the soap?

552
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,550
Please take that out of my ass.

553
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,791
I want you on the bed, now.

554
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,112
Hey, Charlie.

555
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,553
What's up, Chuck?

556
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,393
No, we're in some ratty town
called Beaver Pelt.

557
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,348
How will you get out?

558
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,319
Turn that off.

559
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,871
The guy is going down on her
and she's eating an apple. It's hilarious.

560
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,437
I'm sorry. What did you say?

561
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,072
What's going on there?
It sounds like someone's having sex.

562
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,469
Nobody's having sex. It's just Moses.

563
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,030
Will you turn that shit off?

564
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,951
This is a '70s porno. Know how I can tell?
The guy's dick has sideburns.

565
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,072
So, baby, what are you wearing?

566
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,194
What am I wearing?

567
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,034
You wearing that little black lacy thing
I bought you?

568
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,520
Well, as a matter of fact, I am.

569
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,189
Why do you ask?

570
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,114
I don't know.

571
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,634
I'm just sitting here, thinking about you.

572
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,638
I'm really missing you.

573
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,559
I miss you, too.

574
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,034
I got to let you go.

575
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,349
Where did you get that?
Didn't they search you?

576
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,670
I had it in my ass. Want a hit?

577
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,149
Yeah.

578
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,712
What are you doing?

579
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,190
You just wasted good weed.

580
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,149
Who were you talking to, your girlfriend?
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

581
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,117
I'll probably marry this one.

582
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,433
Marry her? I ain't ever getting married.

583
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,398
I wouldn't drag anybody
into my miserable life.

584
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,516
<i>And two cars in every garage. You betcha. </i>

585
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,199
What was wrong with you...

586
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,840
...getting involved
with a piece of shit like that?

587
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,069
I don't know.

588
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,113
Crime's the only thing I'm good at.
I had a normal job once. A busboy.

589
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,795
I got fired in three days.
I don't know how to give people butter.

590
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,996
I got the guy in the yellow trunks.

591
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,231
$20, the man in the green.

592
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,390
Actually, you already owe me $20.

593
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,675
For what?

594
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,473
Knicks at the Forum.

595
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,232
Remember, you didn't want to take
any points? Were you crazy...

596
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,673
...or a sucker?

597
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,952
Maybe I'm the sucker.

598
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,031
Damn handcuff shit!

599
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,470
Man, you really had me fooled.

600
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,119
I would've done anything for you.
I would've taken a bullet for you, Keats!

601
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,560
I bet that's not even your real name, Keats.

602
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,797
Holy shit.
Your name really isn't Keats, is it?

603
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,350
It's Carter. Jack Carter.

604
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,633
I told you personal shit about myself.
Shit I'd never told anyone in my life.

605
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,756
And you didn't even tell me
your real name?

606
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,400
I was working undercover,
what do you expect?

607
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,671
You didn't tell anybody, did you?

608
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,029
About what?

609
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,237
The shit I told you!
You probably told every cop on the force!

610
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,675
What, that they over-circumcised you?

611
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,157
That's bullshit!
I made that up to make you laugh!

612
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,755
Don't worry about it,
I didn't tell anyone anything.

613
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,034
You're a liar.

614
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,193
Don't give me none of your shit. I'm not
the one that made you cross that line!

615
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,114
I may be a criminal, but I'd never do
to anybody what you did to me.

616
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,550
That's messing with people's feelings.

617
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,399
That's why your head hurts right now.
You feel guilty.

618
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,678
- My head hurts because you shot me in it.
- Keats.

619
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,710
It's Carter, and I risked my ass
to be sure you didn't get hurt.

620
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,115
And I got a bullet in the head
for my troubles.

621
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,470
That was an accident.

622
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,600
- Don't tell me that shit.
- It's the truth.

623
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,350
Admit that what you did to me was
much worse than anything I did to you...

624
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,112
...or shut up!

625
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,114
Well, it was.

626
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,554
Don't say it!

627
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,750
An accident!

628
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,200
My head feels a million times better.

629
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,637
I'm going to sleep like a baby tonight.
How about you?

630
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,353
Sorry about the turds in there.
It was an accident.

631
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,757
"And I

632
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,080
"will always love you"

633
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,555
But, honey, you're the one always saying,
we need to try new things to keep...

634
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,196
...the passion and fire in our relationship.

635
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,795
How do you know
you wouldn't like some sandwich action?

636
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,591
Okay, stud, say goodbye.

637
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,949
I have to go, honey. Goodbye.

638
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,353
Where are they?

639
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,796
- Who?
- Understand me.

640
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,672
I'll ask you one more time,
then I'll blow your brains over Mr. Moose.

641
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,753
Bungalow 7.

642
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,635
Good night.

643
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,991
Get in! Get in!

644
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,154
All right, Charlie! Go!

645
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,868
Get down.

646
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,151
Those fellas
messed with the wrong <i>hombre. </i>

647
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,910
They don't get out of here alive! Let's go!

648
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,751
- Here they come!
- Shit.

649
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,596
Aren't you going a little fast, Charlie?

650
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,797
Don't worry. I know these woods
like the back of my hand.

651
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,673
Look out, look out!

652
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,313
That elm came down in a storm
we had a week ago.

653
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,030
Guess those fellas aren't from here.

654
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,709
That's Jimmy's Creek.
Good fishing if you're ever here again.

655
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,917
Are you getting a woody doing this?

656
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,309
I had one before we started.

657
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,993
Come on, Charles.

658
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,550
I don't like that look in his eye.

659
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,149
Where are we going? What are you doing?

660
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,310
God almighty! Charlie!

661
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,559
Devils Drop-Off.

662
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,237
235 feet straight down.

663
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,080
Kind of hard to make out in the dark.

664
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,988
I'd like to make out with you in the dark.

665
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,953
- Get out of here. Get away.
- Don't be shy.

666
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,275
All right, Charlie.

667
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,350
Yeah?

668
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,637
Mr. Colton, I've lost them
and I don't know where they are.

669
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,633
Hold on a second.

670
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,510
Fucking idiot! Prick!

671
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,318
Naturally, if you lost them
you don't know where they are, you idiot.

672
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,795
<i>Sorry. </i>

673
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,755
Where might they be?

674
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,071
Probably on their way to Los Angeles.

675
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,149
See you later.

676
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,430
Thanks for being a hero, Charlie.

677
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,157
You're putting the handcuffs back on.
Thanks.

678
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,914
It's Finch.

679
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,273
It has to be Finch.

680
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,074
- One thing I don't understand though.
- What's that?

681
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,675
He's a special DEA officer.

682
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,310
These guys don't usually flip out like that.

683
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,474
Colton can fix anyone who might be able
to help him. You fucking shit!

684
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,551
You ruined my life!

685
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,754
Sorry.

686
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,552
Where are you going?

687
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,917
- I'm calling the FBI.
- What?

688
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,590
Did you not listen to a word I said?

689
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,877
You're saying Colton has FBI agents, too?

690
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,876
Is it the plate in your head?
I don't remember you being that stupid.

691
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,396
Colton has notebooks
with people's names in them.

692
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,959
Cops, judges...

693
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,631
...FBI agents. I know
'cause I wrote some names in there myself.

694
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,877
You're just afraid the FBI
will make it harder for you to run.

695
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,679
Your problem is,
you see everything in black and white.

696
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,275
You don't realize
most people live in a gray area.

697
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,435
Spare me your ignorant philosophy.

698
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,794
I trust the FBI more than a guy
who shot me in my head.

699
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,272
Call me wacky.

700
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,191
The bus comes in at 7:00.

701
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,671
Right. Okay. 'Bye.

702
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,788
Hey, man, can I call my mother?

703
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,315
Why?

704
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,075
You just got me killed.
I want to talk to her one last time.

705
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,593
- No.
- You know I talk to her every Tuesday.

706
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,280
She'll get nervous if I don't call.

707
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,071
Do you have any change? Come on.

708
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,270
I always did like your mom.

709
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,872
How is she doing?

710
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,834
If she stopped drinking booze
and smoking weed she'd be all right.

711
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,873
The doctor says<i>... </i>

712
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,237
Don't talk about my mother.

713
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,753
Why are you so defensive?

714
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,513
It would break her heart
if she knew what you did to me.

715
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,916
I did my job. That's what I did to you.

716
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,909
My mother loved you!
She said you were my only real friend.

717
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,194
It's ringing.

718
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,070
Did you tell her what happened?

719
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,311
No, I wouldn't do that.

720
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,679
Will you please help? Thank you.

721
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,678
How's it going?

722
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,959
Mom, are you high?

723
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,672
Jeez, what else is new? Okay.

724
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,949
Rock Keats is doing just fine.

725
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,311
Yes, he's right here. He's with me.

726
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,512
You want to talk to him?
I'll put him on the phone.

727
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,915
You said you've nothing
to feel guilty about.

728
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,271
- I don't want to talk to her.
- Talk to my mommy, Carter.

729
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,111
Carter, Mommy, right there. It's all right.

730
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,754
Hi, Ma.

731
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,510
Yeah, I'm doing great.

732
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,511
No, I have a new girlfriend now.

733
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,072
Yeah, named Traci.

734
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,990
No, not Stacy. Traci.

735
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,556
No, she's not like the whore in Mexico, no.

736
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,269
Yeah, I'm taking care of your Archie.

737
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,392
I know.

738
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,710
Well, he's my best friend, too.

739
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,874
I look forward to seeing you. Okay.

740
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,357
You're going to make me
sweet-potato pie? Great.

741
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,874
Bye-bye.

742
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,514
Back at you.

743
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,797
- You know I'm going to kill you for that.
- Carter, stop that.

744
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,232
Okay, these are our guys.

745
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,550
- The Blues Brothers?
- Yeah.

746
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,915
Guess which one of them
is your real father.

747
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,513
The one with the hat.

748
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,156
Detective Carter.
Special agents Gentry and Cole.

749
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,992
Man, am I glad to see you guys.

750
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,479
Gentry and Cole?

751
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,114
So what?

752
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,237
Don't mind him. He's simple.

753
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,831
I guess you had a rough ride.

754
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,717
You can say that again.

755
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,876
Darryl Gentry. Darryl Gentry.

756
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,196
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

757
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,953
First name is Darryl, right?

758
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,230
Named after my mother's brother.
Man, talk about simple.

759
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,475
Uncle Darryl was a goddamn pinhead.

760
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,510
Now, how did I know your first name?

761
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,870
What?

762
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,837
How'd I know your first name?

763
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,674
I suppose I said something at the station.

764
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,956
That's right. Remember, Keats?

765
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,715
At the station he goes,
"I'm Darryl. I'm Darryl Gentry. "

766
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,791
'Cause it's not like I'm a psychic.

767
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,634
If I was psychic,
I'd have known you were a cop.

768
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,798
How do you shut him up?

769
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,353
This usually works.

770
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,353
Get the wheel!

771
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,279
Goddamn. Are you going to shoot that?

772
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,309
Get the hell out of my car!

773
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,029
You okay?

774
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,872
Good. You're on the road.

775
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,118
Oh, my God!
That guy looks like a tumbleweed!

776
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,558
The Rock and Archie Show.

777
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,079
You did good.

778
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,714
I told you I was telling the truth
about them FBI guys.

779
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,869
So you did.

780
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,270
Just like I did about how shooting you
was an accident.

781
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,432
Don't go there.

782
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,548
I may not know where you're really from,
or where you went to school...

783
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,632
...or if your dad was really a smackhead...

784
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,917
...but you know me, man. Say it.

785
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,949
Tell me I ain't a liar. Say it, Keats.

786
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,953
You ain't a liar.

787
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,633
Hallelujah.

788
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,875
Hey, Mo.

789
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,238
My father really did die
with a needle in his arm.

790
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,349
You're the only person I ever told that to.

791
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,159
I'd hug you, but I got these damn cuffs on.

792
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,790
Stick your finger in your ass.

793
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,512
The reason Colton wants me...

794
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,196
...and why the D.A. Cut me a deal,
is, I know how Colton's operation works.

795
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,555
How he imports drugs and launders money
through his car dealership...

796
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,835
...and it's all written in them notebooks.

797
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,148
The ones with the names?

798
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,279
You could put Colton away for 20 lifetimes.
I could help you get them...

799
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,118
If I let you go?

800
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,319
The cops don't care about me.
They want Colton.

801
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,033
No can do.

802
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,792
How can you do this to me?

803
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,952
You giving up Colton,
you won't do much time.

804
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,318
Yeah, smuggling dope, shooting a cop.
See you in 10 years.

805
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,837
That's if Finch doesn't get me
on the way to headquarters.

806
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,590
I'm not taking you there.
I'm taking you to my precinct.

807
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,439
I trust the people there. You'll be all right.

808
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,471
We were friends, Keats, friends.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

809
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,550
Don't give me that shit about
just doing your job. That's crap!

810
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,515
I was doing my job then
and I'm doing it now.

811
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,511
Well, your job sucks!

812
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,151
Could you move your head to the left?
That plate is ruining the reception!

813
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,793
Jesus, you're right.

814
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,513
Where's the Captain?

815
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,635
I haven't seen him.

816
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,599
You look like shit. Go home.
We'll take this guy.

817
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,118
Do the names Sulliman and Jones
mean anything to you?

818
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,398
What's with you, Jack?
You don't trust us all of a sudden?

819
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,596
I don't trust anybody, Whoopi.

820
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,272
Sulliman, Jones.

821
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,312
Doesn't ring a bell.

822
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,917
Keep him away from Finch,
that bastard's on Colton's payroll.

823
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,994
That son of a bitch.
I knew there was a reason I didn't like him.

824
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,318
Can you do me a favor?

825
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,875
Can you check in with my mom,
once in a while...

826
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,349
...to make sure
she's not smoking too much weed?

827
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,915
I got nobody else to ask.

828
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,269
You got it.

829
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,879
I'll look after her.

830
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,468
<i>- Hey, bright eyes. </i>
- Jack, where are you?

831
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,914
I'm at the... Hello?

832
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,071
Welcome home, Jack.

833
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,509
You son of a bitch.
If you hurt her, I swear to God...

834
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,115
Yeah. Listen.
I'm a businessman, Jack, so...

835
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,872
...let's discuss business.

836
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,350
You have something I want,
and I have something you want.

837
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,750
What I'm talking about here
is an even swap.

838
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,674
I don't have Moses. I turned him in.

839
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,072
Well, that's not very good, is it?

840
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,188
You better get him back.

841
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,429
<i>Bring Moses to my house</i>
<i>or you'll never see your girlfriend again. </i>

842
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,874
<i>Come on down here. </i>

843
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,713
Watch yourself.

844
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,351
Don't do what I think you want to do,
'cause neither one of us will like it.

845
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,875
Hold up! I need him back.

846
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,235
What are you saying?

847
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,515
- I'll take him to headquarters myself.
- Why?

848
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,995
Never mind why. Get the fuck off me!

849
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,436
He's taking me back, so we're going.

850
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,033
Sorry about your lunch.

851
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,192
I knew you'd come through.
Was it that last look I gave you?

852
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,508
Yeah, all of that.

853
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,588
Where are you going?

854
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,240
You gotta trust me on this, Captain.
He's dirty.

855
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,389
What?

856
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,749
You heard me.

857
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,068
Are you crazy?

858
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,517
- I'll explain later.
- No, you'll explain now.

859
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,549
Jensen.

860
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,115
This guy's name is Jensen?

861
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,912
Why? What?

862
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,109
- It's not Finch! Jensen works with Colton.
- What's he saying?

863
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,872
Get me out of here, now!

864
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,118
He's saying that you're in bed with Colton.
Back up!

865
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,238
He's a lying son of a bitch.

866
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,748
He doesn't lie.

867
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,629
Are you going to take the word
of that little prick over mine?

868
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,719
Right now I have to.

869
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,310
You're on suspension, you son of a bitch.

870
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,910
Now turn that prisoner over.

871
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,356
Don't even think about it!

872
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,035
And you<i>... </i>

873
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,476
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

874
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,517
- Hey, man.
- How you doing?

875
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,270
I cannot believe it was Jensen.
He's been like a father to me.

876
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,394
Shit!

877
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:17,990
Shit!

878
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,789
I'm not going to tell you,
'cause you'll get mad.

879
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,031
What are you talking about?

880
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,075
There was a chance,
I'm not 100 percent sure, but...

881
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,753
...maybe it was Benson, not Jensen.

882
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,749
You bullshitting me?

883
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,516
No, I'm not positive.
Actually, I am positive it was Benson.

884
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,239
- Jensen, they sound close.
- I could kick your ass!

885
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,517
Jensen, Benson: They rhyme.
Jesus, give me a break!

886
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,715
A break?

887
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,110
You should be happy your captain's clean.

888
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,158
I hit my superior officer on his ass
and pulled a gun on him.

889
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,389
I should be happy?

890
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:00,156
The good thing is, finally, you acted
like a human being instead of a cop.

891
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,075
You wouldn't let me rot in that jail cell
and I love you for it.

892
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,674
Moses.

893
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,909
I swear, I'll make it up to you.

894
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,951
I got something to tell you.

895
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,352
- Go ahead.
- You won't get mad?

896
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,718
No way. I'm falling in love with you
all over again.

897
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,391
Okay. Colton has Traci.

898
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,315
The only way to get her back
is by turning you in. There, I said it.

899
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,556
You can't stop fucking me over!

900
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,872
I'm not turning you in,
but I can't get her back without you.

901
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,991
You're the only one who knows that place.

902
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:40,073
I won't make it out of that place alive
if I go there.

903
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,035
Forget it. I ain't doing it.

904
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:43,950
Fine!

905
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,156
Then, I guess you lied to me, after all.

906
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,872
Okay. About what?

907
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,150
You said you'd take a bullet for me.

908
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,639
I would have taken a bullet for you
at one time...

909
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,150
...but that shit is all gone now.

910
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,715
Cool, then don't do it for me.
Do it for yourself...

911
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,758
...because as long as you're alive
Colton wants you dead.

912
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,513
It's only a matter of time
before he puts your lights out.

913
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,674
Goddamn it.

914
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,673
Okay, give me a gun.

915
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,232
Moses, you're a fugitive in my custody.
I can't give you a gun.

916
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,271
Even if it means I get killed?

917
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,559
Even if it means Traci could get killed?

918
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,630
Just leave that black and white shit
and come over to the gray area.

919
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,151
I think Mr. Colton's waiting to see us.

920
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,514
He certainly is.

921
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,994
Hand it over.

922
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,194
After you.

923
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,152
Right in the eyeball!
Bet you're glad you gave me that gun.

924
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,153
This door has no alarm.

925
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,198
- Where does it lead?
- Guest kitchen. No one is ever in there.

926
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,553
Shit!

927
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,033
Get her out of here.

928
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,232
I think they're eating <i>fajitas. </i>

929
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,354
Goddamn it!

930
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,868
Throw it back.

931
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,395
Now!

932
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,831
So no one's ever in here, huh?

933
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,474
Shit.

934
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,479
Is that all you got?

935
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,554
Come here.

936
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,672
Motherfucker!

937
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,389
Thank God. I was so scared.

938
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,068
Where's Colton?

939
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,591
I saw him drive off
when the shooting began.

940
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,829
Okay, let's go.

941
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,872
There may still be guys out there.
I have no gun.

942
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,993
I have one.

943
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,193
Great. Let me have it.

944
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,438
Put your hands up, Jack.

945
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,750
Now is not the time for jokes.

946
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,718
Put your hands up, or I will let you have it.

947
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,149
Move toward the door.

948
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,150
So, after all this time, it was you, huh?

949
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,669
I'm sorry.

950
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:04,594
Just shoot me in my head.
It won't hurt as much.

951
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,272
Give me the gun, bitch. Thank you.

952
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,071
- Where were you?
- Getting the notebooks. They say...

953
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,709
...that it's Nurse Traci's job to get close
to someone, then fuck them over.

954
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,949
No wonder you liked her.

955
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,359
Jack, please!

956
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,555
Move it!

957
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,471
Colton knew you'd be coming after me...

958
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,394
...so he sicked devil-eyes on you
to lead him to me.

959
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,711
Colton made me do it.

960
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,950
He would have killed me if I hadn't done it.

961
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,712
She's playing you, Keats.

962
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,150
But then I fell in love with you.

963
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,670
Shut the fuck up.

964
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,479
I swear to God I did.

965
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,074
She's lying out of her devil ass!

966
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,471
Will you shut the fuck up?

967
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,115
Why don't you make me?

968
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,716
I got to learn how to fight.
This is pathetic.

969
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,473
Moses, don't do it!

970
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,473
Your girlfriend's shooting at me.
What should I do, tell her she's pretty?

971
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,675
Traci!

972
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,912
Put the gun down.

973
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,880
I'm walking out of here.
Don't try to stop me.

974
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,350
Goddamn it, will you stop this?

975
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,319
Don't take it personally.
I'm just doing my job.

976
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,717
Oh, shit! I've heard that before.

977
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,479
Moses, shut up.

978
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,154
Traci, please.

979
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:42,108
Traci, please.

980
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,756
Doesn't feel too good, does it, Keats?

981
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,758
I'm coming out.
I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

982
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,669
Keats, take the gun. She's crazy.

983
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,559
Put it down.

984
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,348
Look out!

985
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,356
Jack-off, you make one hell of a partner.

986
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,314
First you bust him, then you get him shot.

987
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,872
You know what? Screw him!

988
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,559
I built my whole business
selling to morons like him.

989
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,920
You come down to Colton Motors.

990
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,318
I'll sell you a new partner.
One without a bullet in him.

991
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,552
Think of the depreciation.

992
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,117
Step into my office, chump.

993
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,115
I could kill you now,
but that wouldn't be enough...

994
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:18,639
...because first, man,
I'm going to fuck you up.

995
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,671
Goddamn it!

996
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,277
Let's get our story straight.

997
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:46,357
You two broke in here to kill me.

998
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,155
That's what you get
for trying to make me suck your dick.

999
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,911
I can't believe you did that.

1000
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,274
Did what?

1001
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,870
You actually took a bullet for me.

1002
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,677
That was pretty nice of me, wasn't it?

1003
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,796
Sit down. Let me look at that.

1004
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,110
That's just a little flesh wound.

1005
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,149
A bullet hit my back. It hurts.

1006
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,152
Try taking one in the head.

1007
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,392
That probably hurt more.

1008
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:46,511
Those notebooks should make
that Benson or Jensen forget you hit him.

1009
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:49,797
It's Jensen.
And you better get out of here.

1010
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,154
Thanks, man.

1011
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,509
Take care of yourself. Try not to mess up.

1012
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,477
I'm done with a life of crime.
I'm going to Cabo.

1013
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,111
Drinking margaritas, banging <i>señoritas. </i>

1014
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,998
Fuck that shit.
I'm going to be a bullfighter.

1015
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,028
Those guys make a lot of money.
You should come.

1016
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,435
Maybe.

1017
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,431
To the Rock and Archie Show.

1018
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,436
To the Jack and Archie Show.

1019
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,353
I'll see you later.

1020
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,072
See you, Moses.

1021
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,918
The American custom
is different than here in Mexico.

1022
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,039
When you first meet someone,
you just start kissing, kiss each other...

1023
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,352
...get to know each other. It's a little odd,
but if you loosen up you can enjoy it.

1024
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,678
<i>Señor</i>, you are so funny.

1025
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,236
I'm funny and good looking, too.
Admit it. I'm not great looking...

1026
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,754
...but pretty good. About a 7.

1027
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,588
How many of you have done it
with a bullfighter?

1028
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,116
- Anybody? Come on, a show of hands.
- We don't like bullfighters.

1029
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,792
We hate when they kill the bull.

1030
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,792
No, I wouldn't kill the bull. That's not nice.

1031
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,351
I like to get to know the bull.
Teach it how to read...

1032
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,758
...make him stop smoking.
Bulls shouldn't smoke.

1033
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,554
How's it going?

1034
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,399
We don't like you gringos
bothering our women!

1035
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,511
And I wouldn't do that.
That's why I'm leaving. Nice meeting you.

1036
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,391
Oh, God. Come on.

1037
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:51,916
You got a problem with him,
you got a problem with us. Right, Keats?

1038
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,118
You don't want to beat me up
in front of my mother, do you?

1039
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,634
Ma!
