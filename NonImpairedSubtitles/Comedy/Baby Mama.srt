I'm 37.

It's too much

Good morning.
Thank you for
being here so early.

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,468
Hi. How are you?

23
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,133
Let's get started.

That one.

26
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:03,833
Well...

27
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,274
I just don't like
your uterus.

28
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,336
Don't get me wrong.

29
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,906
Your eggs are in great shape,
but you have
a T-shaped uterus.

30
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,250
That combined
with your advanced
maternal age,

31
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,084
it's preventing
proper implantation.

32
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,023
Why do I have
this T-shaped uterus?

33
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,993
Well, probably has something
to do with medication

34
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,757
that was given to
your mother when
she was pregnant with you.

35
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,264
We used lot of drugs
back in the '70s

36
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,392
which we now know
can cause infertility.

37
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,731
Infertility?

38
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:35,035
Yeah. I would say
that your chances
of conceiving are very low.

39
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,132
How low?

40
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,234
Well, I don't want to
assign a number to it.

41
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:42,304
What would you assign it?
A color, a nickname, a locker?

42
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,609
Okay.

ROSE: Come to think of it,

47
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,757
I did take something
for liver spots when
I was pregnant with you,

48
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:03,859
but I really don't see
how that could cause
any problems for your uterus.

49
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,838
It was just a different time.
They didn't warn people
about side effects.

50
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,340
ROSE: They warned me.

51
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,604
I think I might even
have signed something.

00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,702
What?

53
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,614
Kate, I was 30 years old.
I was starting to get
liver spots. Liver spots!

54
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,619
I just hope you put
this baby mania to rest.

55
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,017
It's not mania.

56
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,578
How many times
have you tried now?

57
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,681
Three?
Nine.

58
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,282
The last two
were in vitro.

59
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,725
Have you considered adoption?

60
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,786
I have applied
for an adoption, yes.

61
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:34,299
Kate, please don't get
a black baby.

62
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,962
Well, I don't think
we'll have to
worry about that,

63
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,936
because for a single woman,

64
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,734
it can take
about five years
to get an adoption.

65
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,469
I've just had it
with all these

not everyone is as tolerant

69
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,280
of your alternative lifestyle
as we are.

70
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,547
Being single is not
an alternative lifestyle.

71
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,524
It is when you're 37.

about using a surrogate?

about it on <i>Dateline.</i>

No, it's weird.
It's for weirdoes.

I'm just gonna
keep trying by myself.

78
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,929
Kate, building a family
is not like opening
one of your stores.

79
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,738
It's not
an executive decision.
It's real life. It's messy.

00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,974
These hormone injections
make me want to punch you
in the face right now.

81
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,174
No hitting.

82
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,546
That's right.
You're right.

83
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,551
There you go.
Come on.

84
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,348
Well, how much longer
are you gonna put
your body through this?

85
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,185
Look, I know for years
I said I didn't want one,

86
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,054
but I just
woke up one day,

87
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,857
and I felt like
every baby on the street
was staring at me.

88
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,330
Katie's coming out
of the mommy closet.

89
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,425
Hey, Tyler.

90
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,165
Tyler, what is this
all over you?

91
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,264
Is that chocolate
or poop?

92
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,367
Is that chocolate or poop?

93
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,771
It's chocolate.

94
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,842
What if that
had been poop?

95
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,147
I told you,
messy, but great.

96
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,057
Not bad.

97
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,000
Everybody do a shot
of this pea soup.

That's great.

100
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,738
It's what I do.

You know,

102
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,314
I was swimming this morning
with the dolphins
in Costa Rica,

103
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,380
and I realized something.

104
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,720
I am a great man.

105
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,161
And great men do great things.

106
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,396
I want to open
a flagship store
right here in Philadelphia.

107
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,733
I want it to be
the biggest store
we ever built,

108
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,001
I want it to be made
of 100% recyclable materials,

109
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:59,477
and I want it to be
so beautiful that people
want to get married in it.

110
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,149
Kate, join me up here.

111
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,952
I'm wearing a dress, Barry.

00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,391
Okay.

Hello.
I'm Chaffee Bicknell.

125
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,814
There's just one of you.

126
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,448
I thought Chaffee and Bicknell
were two different people.

127
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,390
Come in.
Certainly.

128
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:05,226
I started this business
because I saw
a growth market.

129
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,295
We don't do
our own taxes anymore.

130
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,102
We don't program
our computers.

131
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,506
We outsource.

132
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,545
And what is surrogacy
if not outsourcing?

133
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,581
Wait. You're not saying
my baby would be carried

134
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:19,015
by some poor,
underpaid woman
in the third world.

135
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,143
No.

136
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,188
We're also expensive.

137
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,524
Our fee is $100,000.

138
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,128
It costs more to have
someone born than
to have someone killed.

139
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,793
It takes longer.

140
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:40,838
All of our surrogates undergo
extensive background checks.

141
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,670
Criminal records,
credit reports,
medical histories

142
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,608
and psychological testing.

143
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,738
But why do these women do it?
Is it just for the money?

144
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:53,751
You do your job for the money,
but I bet you love it
and you're good at it.

145
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,287
Let me ask you a question.

146
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,118
Do you plan on hiring a nanny?

147
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,454
Of course.
I have to go back to work.

148
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,153
How is this any different?

149
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:06,562
A nanny is someone
you trust to take care
of your baby after it's born.

150
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:11,763
A surrogate mother is someone
you trust to take care
of your baby before it's born.

151
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,169
Either way it's your baby.

152
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,404
And here's my baby.

153
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,813
Hello, my sweetheart.
Hello, little one.

154
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:26,045
Oh, yes.
What a good girl. Yes.

155
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,048
Everyone deserves this.

156
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,454
That's why I wanna
remove the stigma
from surrogacy.

157
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,584
There's no wrong way

this little angel possible?

A positive attitude.

KATE: So, how long
have you two
been together?

212
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,624
We met the summer
after I discontinued
high school.

213
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,823
And we've been
together ever since.

214
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,490
He never officially
asked me to be his wife,

215
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,159
but he never asked me
to not be his wife either,

216
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,499
so things are going
pretty good.

217
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,703
Wow. The place is amazing.

218

Let me...

219
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,036
Beautiful.

220
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:12,049
Kind of looks
like Kate Hudson's

She read that somewhere.
I don't think
she's saying it right.

222
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,314
No, she's saying it right.

Well, I am the
vice president of development

229
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,869
So you take over

(STAMMERING) Well...

231

Thanks.

I don't know.

What do you do, Carl?

238
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,029

241
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:12,374

the iPod the first time,
I was like...

242
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,002
I mean, I could've
kicked myself.

so hard on him.

Now we're pretty
tight on cash.

245
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,874
So that led you
to surrogacy?

Hey, I gotta say,

247
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,586
when I first thought
about Angie carrying
someone else's baby,

248
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,648
I felt weird about it.

249
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,215
Then I thought,
"Oh, my God,

250
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,286
"if my wife's gotta have sex
with someone else's
husband to do this..."

251
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,990
Out of the question.
"...that's gonna
cost extra."

252
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,555
It's out
of the question.

This is a nice view.

254
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,604

done this before?

255
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,800
No. But I know I'm good
at getting pregnant.

256
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,502
(STAMMERING) That's not
what I'm asking about.

257
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,941
You know,
we've all had our scares.

258
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,138
No, not really.
Me neither.

259
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,044
Pardon my asking this,
but how many couples, women,

260
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,714
how many people
are you interviewing
before you make your decision?

261
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,852
I guess you're like
our sixth or seventh.

262
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,657

263
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,561

264

they say that

everybody's aura gives off
a different color?

266
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,002
I can read those auras.

267
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,439
I'm very sensitive
to people's energies.

268
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,442
So, I meet new people
and I get exhausted.

that you like me, Angie,

278

for a very big favor,
you know.

279

that I just don't have.

you're at an Arby's

I don't know!

636
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,749
Maybe you stuck
some of it under there.

637
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,687
Yeah, actually
you might be right,

638
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,621
because sometimes
when I work
a really long day,

639
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,785
I like to come home
and chew a huge wad
of Bubblicious gum

640
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,386
and stick it under
my reclaimed
BarnWood coffee table!

641
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,022
Bitch,
I don't know your life!

642
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,861
All right, ladies,
there's no need to yell.

643
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,768
Well, the mystery remains
as to who put
the gum under there.

644
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:07,896
No, it doesn't.

645
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,066
Kate, you're used to
being the boss,

646
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:15,511
and, Angie, being pregnant
makes you feel
vulnerable and sensitive.

647
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,378
I know my hormones
are on a rollercoaster
right now.

648
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,076
Are you saying...

649
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:23,143
That's right.
I'm expecting again.

650
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,050
Expecting what,
a social security check?

651
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,956
It's weird, isn't it?
Yeah.

652
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,926
These conflicts are normal.

653
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:36,956
This is a highly unusual
relationship, and that's what
this support group is for.

654
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,763
Jonathan would
like to share again.

655
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,599
I mean, I'm only saying
because this reminded me

656
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:44,437
of something
I was journaling,
just the other day.

657
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,603
I feel really bad
because Karen and I
are fighting a lot,

658
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:51,774
because I think
she's becoming
morbidly obese.

659
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,909
And I keep reminding him
that she is pregnant.

660
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,251
And then I realized
that I am...

661
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,820
I'm... No.
I am... Okay.

662
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:09,356
I'm anorexic,
and it's really hard,
because she's so fat.

663
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,459
And I... I love
Christopher so much,

664
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,734
and he's fat,
and I'm afraid
the baby's gonna be fat.

665
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,139
And it's just me
and two fatties.

666
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,611
I'm proud of you, Jonathan.
Thank you for sharing that.

667
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,113
Yeah, that's a...

668
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,649

670
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,080
I can go.
Dave?

671
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:35,956
The wife and I are Methodists.
Ashley here is a Wiccan.

672
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:41,922
It's kind of like a witch.
They have stores, I think.

673
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:48,097
But, you know, at first,
I was a little worried about
a witch carrying my child,

674
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:52,370
but I came around
to the idea,
or she put a spell on me.

675
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,101
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

676
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,271
Did you do that, Ashley?

677
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,205
I'm sorry.

678
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,217
I'd like to
share something.
CHAFFEE: Please.

679
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,253
Okay, I don't know,
like, all the therapy terms...

680
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,789
Well, I don't know
the therapy terms, either.
I don't go to therapy.

681
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,950
Yeah, but I'd just like
to say that Kate is
always up in my business.

682
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,756
Well, when someone
falls asleep with
a curling iron in their hair,

683
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:15,162
it becomes necessary
to insert yourself
in their business.

684
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,996
That happened two times!

685
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:21,232
Angie, bottom line,
you're carrying Kate's baby,

686
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,138
and you do
wanna get paid, right?

687
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,402
Yeah.

688
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,445
That means that
Kate does deserve
some input.

689
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:32,243
But, Kate, you must remember
that a surrogate
is not your employee,

690
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,408
but your partner.

691
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:37,079
Yeah, Kate,
we're partners,
like Tom and Jerry.

692
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,587
Tom and Jerry
hate each other.

693
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,749
What? They love each other!
What show are you watching?

694
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:41,883
They're a cat and a mouse.

695
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,256
They have
so much fun together!

696
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,726
Children in Japan
can understand that.

697
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,057
You are dead wrong.

698
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,566
I want you two to
spend more time together.

700
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,635
That's impossible.
We're always together.
I don't... Yeah.

701
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,830
Let Angie help you
get ready for the baby.

702
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,305

the nursery together,
pick out a crib.

you would do
if you were pregnant,

704

How many of you are planning

That's so great,
you're all so great.

toxic Western medications

It's just this whole thing

And frankly,
it makes me

You want it to have
the essence of the shell.

Yes, that's it, exactly.
Thank you, Kate.
I'm sorry I flipped, Rick.

of this shell.

As your pregnancy progresses,

767
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,508
your partner can help you
prep your perineum

768
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:26,175
for the great stretch
of delivery.

769
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:31,985
Massage the area
daily with a little EVOO

770
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,719
to help you stretch
and prevent tearing.

771

What is she talking about?

772
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,755
I think she wants me
to rub olive oil
on your taint.

773
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,999
Is it cool if maybe
I just spray a little PAM
down in that area,

774
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,732
right before
the baby comes out?

775
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,331
You have to admit
it's a valid suggestion.

ever married you?

got married once
to a guy named Scott.

I ever lived with.

He waited a whole month
before he touched my boobs.

793
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,646
Then he went
to the University of Scranton,

from him again.

He looks like
a laundry bag
full of meat.

What about
that guy over there?
He's wearing a suit.

Why is he here?

942
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:47,765
You went out

Kate, my gosh,
you look great!
What are you doing here?

00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,194
I'm just clubbing.

You remember
my wife, Jean?

955
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:15,957
Oh, yeah.

956
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:18,091
Hi, Jean, how are you?

957
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,530
How's everything?

958
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:23,505
It's great.
We just bought a house
in Bucks County.

959
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:26,474
I'm still doing stuff
for Doctors Without Borders.

960
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,240
Recently, we took in
some Hurricane Katrina dogs.

961
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,976
And I was
in a bicycle accident
that made my penis bigger.

962
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:36,107
How are you?

963
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,983
I'm doing awesome.

964
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:43,082
I've just been working a lot,
and I cannot have babies,
it turns out.

965
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,526
So, good job
picking this one.

966
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:50,055

my uterus is T-shaped,

funny story.

Okay, see that
little blonde woman,
over here?

969
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,863
I am paying her to have...
Hi. Stop talking now.

970
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,499
Bye, Jean.

971
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,004
Why does he
make me so crazy?

972
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,070
Forget about him.
He dumped you.
He's an asshole.

973
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:06,911
No,
he's a good person.

974
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,110
No,
you're a good person.

975
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,746
You don't need another
good person around you.
That's your thing.

976
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:13,254
He's trying to
take that from you!

977
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:16,224
He wanted to marry me,
and I wanted to
focus on work.

978
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:17,726
Of course you did!

979
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:21,127
Because working is awesome
and being married sucks!

No, that...

1007
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:48,180
I keep this notepad
by my bed in
the middle of the night,

1008
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,219

these ideas
when I'm half asleep,

1009
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,777
and they never
make any sense.

1010

I do that, too.

1011
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,817
And then I wake up,
and I have these little notes
that say things like,

1012
00:54:56,893 --> 00:55:01,262
"make everybody be twins"
and "electric toilet."

1013

Those are not
good ideas.

1014
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,626
They're really not.

1015
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:11,100
So why are you out so late?
Are you a prostitute
at night, or...

1016

No.

1017
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:16,708
I went out tonight
for the first time
in a long time,

1018
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,544
and I let a friend
of mine dress me.

I really like it.

You don't think
it looks like a penis?

1026
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:57,616
No, I don't see that.
No?

1027

No, I don't see that.

1028
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:02,383
Over here
you got two obvious...

1029

I don't know what
you're talking about.
...stiff ones... No?

1030
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,622
No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1031
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:12,233
You're being nice.
Thank you.

1032
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,998
Also, I don't think
you wanna pick a fight
with Jamba Juice.

1033
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:16,538
I mean, they're not
exactly Wal-Mart.

1034
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:20,235
Well, they are.
They're the Exxon
of frozen juice companies.

1035
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,973
Yes, I think I saw
a Michael Moore
documentary about that.

1036
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:27,138
That's embarrassing.

1037

So is that offer
to get together some time
still on the table?

1038
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:33,949
Are you asking me out?

1039
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:36,184
Yes, I think I am.

1040
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,625
Okay, yes,
then, yes. Yeah.

1041
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:39,753
Great.

1042
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,761
This came off my head.

1043

hair's real, right?

1044
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,533
No. I'm bald. I'm...

So we got that
going for us.

Hi, Carl.

1047

What's up,
hot stuff?

1048
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,478
What are you doing here?
I told you to
stay away from me.

1049
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:00,482
You think
you're getting this
payday without me?

1050
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,018
No way.
I want my half, okay?

1051
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,748
And I've got insurance,
the actual pee-stick.

1052
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,881
I don't even know
if that's real.
You probably peed on it.

1053
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,187
Maybe I did,
maybe I didn't.
But I'll tell you this.

1054
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,284
It's gonna raise
a lot of questions

1055
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,453
when Kate takes
this down to the lab,

1056
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,463
and they start doing
DNA tests with <i>CSI</i> stuff,

1057
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,362
and molecules and proteins
and the hair follicles,

1058
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,764
and they're gonna
connect the dots.

1059
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,199
And then you're
gonna be busted.

1060
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,238
Carl, I don't wanna do
any of this anymore.

1061
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,697
I want a common-law divorce.

1062
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:29,074
You wanna give me back
the ring that I made
for you in metal shop?

1063
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:30,806
Yeah, I do.

1064
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,075
Okay, you know what?
I'll tell you when
this relationship's over,

1065
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,844
because there's a lot
of girls there
sitting on the bench

1066
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,113
that wanna come
into this game, all right?

1067
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:40,884
So I am canceling
this relationship, okay?

1068
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:43,957
Please come back
to me, Angie.
Oh, my God!

1069
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:46,495
Wait, wait!
Hold on, hold on,
please!

1070
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:50,556
I wanna say goodbye
to you proper, okay?
We owe that to one another.

1071
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,567
Can we please
have a quickie
in the car?

1072
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,000
What?
What's wrong with you?

1073
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:58,200
You know what?
I'm not gonna be here for you
when Kate kicks you out.

1074
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,105
So deal with that.

1075
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,971
My girl rocks?
My girl does not rock, okay?

1076
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,639
My girl is a divorce.

1077
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:07,239
So I hope
you got Kleenex,

1078
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:11,413
'cause you just said goodbye
to the coolest thing
that ever happened to you.

1079
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:18,520
I'm gonna bang your friends.
Consider them all banged.

1080
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,858
The reason I called you
collect is 'cause it's gonna
take more than a few quarters

1081
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:02,700
to express how I feel
about you, baby.

1082
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:04,797
Hey, where you going?

1083
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:12,480
I knew something was up
when I saw you beating
your baby bump like that.

1084
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,280
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

1085
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,116
Everything just
got way out of hand.

1086
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,893
I think
I'm just gonna split.

1087
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,362
That's a good idea.

1088
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:29,762
Just slip away
in the dead of night

1089
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,356
and leave Kate thinking
you stole the baby.

1090
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:32,924
That would destroy her.

1091
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:35,596
This ain't some little scam
where you just call up
Domino's and be like,

1092
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:39,665
"Yo. You know, I'm doing
some church youth event.
I need 10 free pizzas."

1093
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,107
Why, does that work?

1094
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:44,635
You're lying
about the existence
of a human being.

1095
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:48,673
If you don't tell her,
you'll never be able
to live with yourself.

1096
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,776
Maybe you can tell her
after I'm gone.

1097
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,548
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

1098
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:54,988
Not a damn thing,
'cause you're gonna
tell her yourself.

1099
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,694
I've got
a surprise for you.

1100
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,322
I got a surprise
for you, too.

1101
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:07,392
It is a brochure for
the Philadelphia
School of Textiles.

1102
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,199
They've got
a great fashion program.

1103
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,364
Thanks.

1104
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,500
But that's not
the whole surprise.
Open it.

1105
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,702
I'm giving you
your check early.

1106
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:20,181
No, Kate. I can't take that.
You gotta put
that through the agency.

1107
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,343
No, it's not gonna bounce.
Don't you trust me?

1108
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:30,587
Where are we going?

1109
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,025
You have
an ultrasound appointment.

1110
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:35,087
What? No.
Today's Thursday.

1111
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,462
Ultrasound isn't Thursday.
Birthing class is Thursday.

1112
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,832
Usually, but you're 18 weeks,
and so you have
another ultrasound.

1113
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,734
I can't wait.

1114
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,706
I hope the baby's
in a good position, so we can
see its little profile,

1115
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:49,211
because I'd really like
to get one of those printouts
to hang over my desk.

1116
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:50,336
Do you think
it could look
like me yet?

1117
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,711
Could the baby
look like you
at 18 weeks?

1118
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:55,512
What if it has
little tiny glasses?

1119
01:00:56,552 --> 01:01:00,386
I'm joking.
That's me trying
to make a joke.

1120
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,785
That's cold.
Sorry about that.

1121
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,190
Just...

1122
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:06,417
(HUMMING)

1123
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:15,093
Lf... When you get mad,
do you stay mad
for a long time?

1124
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:19,039
Yes, yes. I'm a big
grudge-holder, actually.

1125
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,042
Hear that?
What?

1126
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,806
That's your heartbeat.
You nervous?

1127
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,370
Yeah, a little.

1128
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:29,714
Okay, I'm just...
Just having
a little trouble finding...

1129
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:31,549
You're gonna have
a lot of trouble.

1130
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:34,522
Kate, I gotta
tell you something.
I'm not really...

1131
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,319
There's the baby's heartbeat.

1132
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:37,450
(SCOFFING)

1133
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,461
I'm not really... What?
Isn't it wonderful?

1134
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,518
Holy shit!

1135
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:42,393
There's a baby in there?
Yep!

1136
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,558
How did it get in there?
It's a miracle.

1137
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,864
What did you
wanna tell me?

1138
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,234
I'm so excited.

1139
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,332
Yay!

1140
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,476
What do you mean, pregnant?
I thought you was
lying to Kate.

1141
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:03,611
I was. I am.
It's not Kate's baby.
It's Carl's.

1142
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:04,675
So the procedure thing...

1143
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,551
Didn't take.

1144
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:08,681
And then I was crying,
so Carl and I did it.

1145
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:10,225
And it's just country.

1146
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,555
I missed a couple periods,

1147
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:14,095
and I thought maybe it was
my hormones, you know
what I'm talking about?

1148
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:15,289
No, I don't know
nothing about that.

1149
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:17,491
But then I started spotting,
and I thought
that was my period,

1150
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,864
but usually I don't
have a heavy flow.

1151
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,732
(SHUSHING) Stop it.

1152
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:24,204
My boobs didn't hurt,
so I was like,
"It's not my period..."

1153
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,639
You know what?
Look, I'm just gonna
lay it out, all right?

1154
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:28,176
I'm not discussing
the lady business with you.

1155
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,905
I mean, I think
it's a beautiful thing
and all that,

1156
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,674
but it's disgusting, okay?

1157
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,340
And I'm afraid
if we keep
talking about it,

1158
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:36,408
that our cycles
might synchronize...

1159
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,319
What am I
supposed to do, Oscar?

1160
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:43,154
I can't cash that check.
I can't take any
of Kate's money.

1161
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:46,662
But I am gonna stay here
until I figure out what to do.

1162
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,959
I don't know anything
about being a mother.

1163
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:50,760
You better start learning.

1164
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,960
It's good
if the kid's raised here,
though, you know?

1165
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:56,971
Better school,
better apartment,
better situation.

1166
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,401
Is that what you want?

1167
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,646
No, I wanna keep it.

1168
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,509
Have you read this?

1169
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:15,421
"One in four million babies
are born with
a full set of teeth."

1170
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:17,823
Angie, it's gonna be fine.

1171
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:18,883
Where you going?

1172
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,690
I have a date
with that guy, Rob.

1173
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:21,855
Are you gonna
tell him about me?

1174
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:24,058
No. I've made
that mistake before.

1175
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,623
It turns out
they don't like it

1176
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:29,865
when you talk about
the successful transfer
of embryos on the first date.

1177
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:34,103
Read the chapter
about hermaphrodites.
You won't sleep for a week.

1178
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:38,106
Hello, folks,
my name is Chet.
I'm your waiter.

1179
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:41,617
Are you folks familiar
with the raw food
vegan movement?

1180
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,174
Yeah.
I think he is,
more than I am.

1181
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:44,719
Yeah, yeah.

1182
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:46,914
Okay, should we start
with some appetizers?

1183
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:50,516
Yeah. How's the
sea kelp pizza?

1184
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:53,061
That's got
a nice earthy taste,
little bit of a dirt taste.

1185
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,892
It's very nice.

1186
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:57,558
Salty. We'll stay
away from that.

1187
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,100
You know what looks good
is the blue algae?

1188
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,965
You wanna just...
Yes, yes.

1189
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,059
Excellent.
Be right back.

1190
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,439
So what kind of law
did you practice?

1191
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,604
Corporate. You know
when you're watching the news,

1192
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,274
and you see
some bloated CEO
involved in a scandal,

1193
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,407
and you kind of
wonder to yourself,

1194
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,281
"How is this prick
not going straight to jail?"

1195
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,685
Sometimes it was
because of me.

1196
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:21,689
You must be very proud.

1197
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,486
All right,
here's your
blue-green algae

1198
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,618
and a yeast bowl
for the table.

1199
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,719
Thank you.
Thanks.

1200
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:28,559
This looks good.

1201
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,428
Oh, it's warm.
Yeah.

1202
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:35,236
What about you?
You like your work?

1203
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,238
I do, but I mean,

1204
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:39,740
I have other things
in my life besides my job.

1205
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,367
I like to travel for work.

1206
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:45,046
Oh, that's a...

1207
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:48,013
That's a good yeast.

1208
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:50,419
Very yeasty.

1209
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,945
How long have
you been vegan?

1210
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:55,287
I'm not.

1211
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:58,486
I'm sorry. I'm not,
I thought that you were,

1212
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,823
and that's why
I took you here.

1213
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:03,093
Because of where you work,
I never would have...
Oh, God.

1214
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,133
Can we...
Yeah, you want to...
I eat meat.

1215
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:06,759
Yeah, I eat meat
like nobody's business.

1216
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:12,199
I'll have a large steak
with provolone,
no Cheez Whiz, no onions,

1217
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,300
peppers on the side,
don't overcook the meat.

1218
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,868
Also, I'd like you
to slice me a new fresh roll,

1219
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:18,743
because those ones
have been sitting out
for a long time.

1220
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:21,078
I want a Birch Beer,
cold, no cup.

1221
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,948
You really should
consider changing those
Styrofoam cups to paper ones,

1222
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,318
because they're very bad
for the environment.

1223
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,414
Yeah, I'll have the same.

1224
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,689
I'm sorry.
I'm a little
overly thorough.

1225
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,661
Some people would say
that I am bossy
and controlling.

1226
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:35,629
No, that's just prejudice.

1227
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:37,495
They call you
bossy and controlling
'cause you're a woman.

1228
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:42,230
But if you were a man
doing the same stuff,
you'd just be a dick.

1229
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,397
What?

1230
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:45,497
Nothing.

1231
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:48,904
No one's ever
called me a dick
before on a date.

1232

Term of endearment.

1233
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:55,313
So listen,
there's something that
I haven't told you.

1234
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:59,878
And it may be
a deal-breaker.

1235
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:02,348
Oh, boy,
you are super fruity,
aren't you?

1236
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:03,517
No.

1237
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:06,618
But I do
have a daughter.

1238
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:11,323
She's 12 years old and
she lives with me
every other weekend.

1239
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,133
I think that's great.

1240
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:15,261
Yeah?

1241
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:19,272
Okay.
You have any kids?

1242
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,535
I've never
been married.

1243
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,437
Well, Kate,

1244
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:28,517
you don't have to
be married to have a kid.

1245

go back to my...

Yes.

I was going to
say apartment,
just to be clear.

1248

Yeah. I'm 37.
I know how this works.

1249
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,195
Okay.
Let's go.

1250
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,365
It's actually
this way.

1251
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:53,703
Okay.

1252

Oh, no. No, no, no.

into the walk of shame.

Why are you all shiny

I want you, now,

to look your partner
in the eye,

she is beautiful.

No.

their asses handed to them

you want for the shower.

Kate, I don't think
I should go to that,
you know?

1272
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:01,609
I mean, that's just
kind of for you.

No, it's for both of us.

Kate, where you been?

1284
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,957
I'm having second thoughts
about this location.

1285
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:26,058
Is it the taxes?

1286
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,660
It's probably
because this place gives you
a weird vibe, right?

Yes. That one.

Oprah taught me,

it's to trust my instincts

Is that the episode

No, this was

01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,048
Oh, well.

1369
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,710
Different dads?
Yes.

1370
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,582
We have different dads.
That's what we have.

1371
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:15,282
We have different dads.
Thank you for that.

1372
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:17,325
Is that my phone?

1373
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:18,723
I didn't actually hear...

1374
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:22,230
It was.
Hold on,
it's from Europe. Hello?

1375
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:25,699
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

1376
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:32,798
Yes, interesting.
It's a business call.
So nice to meet you.

1377
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:34,831
KATE: What?
ANGIE: Yes.

1378
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:38,040
What? How long
did he talk to you?

1379
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:41,640
Hi. Look at you, early bird.

1380
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,685
Okay, it's nice to see you.

1381
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:44,980
Oh, my gosh,
well, let's go.

1382
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,077
Yeah.

1383
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:47,679
Does your sister
want to come with us?

1384
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,883
No, she's not well.

1385
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:52,250
Bye, Angela.
<i>Adios.</i>

1386
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:54,991
OSCAR: Push, woman.

1387
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:59,430
Yeah, good.
Push, and boom!
Congratulations. Look.

1388
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,628
Popcorn.

1389
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:02,761
See?

1390
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:06,137
It's that easy.
What movie we watching?

1391
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,244
<i>Extreme Vaginal Delivery.</i>

1392
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:12,207
The miracle of
really big childbirth.

1393
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:15,907
Oh, damn!

1394
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:17,942
You can't come
back from that.

1395
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:21,920
That's why you always
want to stay over here, huh?

1396
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,924
It's one of the reasons.
Well,

1397
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:26,119
how long
is your sister
in town?

1398
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:27,822
Angie's not
really my sister.

1399
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:31,332
I know.
She's your half-sister.
She told me.

1400
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:35,232
What else did
Angela tell you?

1401
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:37,004
Well,

1402
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:40,300
she told me
that you like me a lot.

1403
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:43,139
Well, she's a liar.
She's a known liar.

1404
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,201
What is this?

1405
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:49,717
Jillian wants me to take her
to an exhibit of abnormal
skulls at the Mtter Museum.

1406
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:52,219
Do you need me
to get out of here?

1407
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,255
No, no. No,
I was gonna see
if you wanted to come.

1408
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,620
You want me
to meet your daughter?

1409
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,852
Is that a bad idea?

1410
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,589
No. I really,
really like kids.

1411
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:05,564
Oh, my God. I know.

1412
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,795
Have you read
this article?

1413
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,236
This Chaffee Backnell lady.

1414
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,535
Bicknell.
She is a piece of work.

1415
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:17,238
I mean, her whole
surrogacy process
is very science-fictiony.

1416
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:18,973
There's so many kids
that need to be adopted.

1417
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,344
Well, adoption
can take years.

1418
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:24,681
And these people would pay,
like, you know,
$50,000, in order to...

1419
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,152
It's $100,000, actually.

1420
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:30,123
You know, have your baby
custom-carried by a
gestation assistant.

1421
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,216
What is that?

1422
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:34,023
Well, I think it's probably
more complicated
than it seems.

1423
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:35,927
A lot of rich people
getting what they want.

1424

<i>(SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING</i>
<i>ON RADIO)</i>

1425
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:40,293
(EXCLAIMS) I hate that song.

1426
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:46,407
Here you go.
You got it?
Yeah, I'm good.

1427
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:47,464
OSCAR: So, do you feel
good about yourself?

1428
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:50,272
You're just going to let
Kate go ahead and have
this whole baby shower, right?

1429
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:52,745
You don't realize
how ruthless that is, right?

1430
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:55,305
Hey, man, that's a sweet cake.
That's tight. That's tight.

1431
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,908
Service entrance,
straight to the terrace.

1432
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:57,974
What am I
supposed to do?

1433
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,521
Tell her today,
in front of all of her friends
and her family?

1434
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,682
No, no, no.
Wait till the child is,
like, nine years old,

1435
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:04,453
and then tell her,
like my first ex did me.

1436
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:07,188
Okay, I'm going to
tell her tonight.

1437
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:09,096
Or Monday.

1438
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:12,362
But then it'll ruin her week,
so maybe I should
wait till Friday.

1439
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,492
Then it would
ruin her weekend,
so maybe I should...

1440
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,333
I don't know
when I'm gonna tell her.

1441
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:18,530
When's the best day
to tell someone
horrible news?

1442
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:19,631
Yesterday.

1443
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:25,209
I tell you,
a pagan birth
is a fascinating thing.

1444
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,713
You know, now that
I've done it myself,

1445
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:29,182
it seems crazy
not to eat the placenta.

1446
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,976
I'm sorry,
did you say polenta
or placenta?

1447
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:34,249
Placenta,
the afterbirth, yeah.

1448
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,917
Ashley turned us onto it...

1449
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:40,828
Angie.

1450
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,690
Hi, I'm Caroline,

1451
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:45,324
Kate's sister.
Nice to meet you.
Hi, nice to meet you.

1452
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,527
And this is
our mother, Rose.

1453
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,729
Hi, nice to meet you.

1454
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:49,862
How do you do?

1455
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,338
So, tell me,
once the baby is born,

1456
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:55,968
will you just go away,
or shall I expect you
at Christmas?

1457
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:57,068
Mom.

1458
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:58,169
What?

1459
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:01,807
This is a reasonable question.
All my friends are asking.

1460
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:03,544
KATE: Well, we haven't
really talked about it.

1461
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,177
No, there's not
a lot of stuff
we've talked about,

1462
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:06,914
we have a lot of stuff
to talk about.

1463
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:09,685
I think Angie might want
to visit the baby
a few times a year.

1464
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:12,750
You know, or I might be
out of town, I don't know
where I'm going.

1465
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:15,524
ANGIE: I mean, I think
I've got plans,
but I'll definitely call.

1466
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:18,327
Summer, if we're on vacation,
maybe Angie would want to
come with us some time.

1467
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,628
And who knows where
we're going to be
in a year?

1468
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,101
I think it's really important
that she remain a part
of the baby's life.

1469
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,832
Yeah, you know,
or completely separate.

1470
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:26,305
We're just going to
play it fast and loose,

1471
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:29,742
you know,
just see how it
all shakes out.

1472
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,039
Always been my motto.

1473
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,223
Rob? Hi.
Hi.

1474
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,661
Hey, I know
it's your sister's
baby shower,

1475
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:52,359
just, you haven't called me
in days. I thought maybe
I did something wrong.

1476
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,197
No, you didn't do anything.

1477
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,930
Is it because
I wanted to introduce you
to my kid?

1478
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,494
No, Rob, I just...

1479
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:59,767
I think you and I
view the world differently.

1480
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,309
Bad news people,
party's over.

1481
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:04,938
Start heading
for the door.
Who let him in here?

1482
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,981
Carl, don't say
something stupid.

1483
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,017
She hasn't told you.

1484
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:10,749
I thought since
you guys were
best friends,

1485
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:12,081
she probably
told you everything.

1486
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,247
Shut your mouth, Carl.
What is going on?

1487
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:16,552
She's not even pregnant, okay?

1488
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:18,554
I mean, look.

1489
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:21,056
Angie what is that?

1490
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,229
Feel it.

1491
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,961
It's moving.
Yeah, it's a baby.

1492
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,432
And it's yours.

1493
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:30,795
What are you saying?

1494
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:31,896
Kate,

1495
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:34,533
I really tried to
make you a baby,
I swear.

1496
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:35,701
What are you saying?

1497
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:36,903
We took a test

1498
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:39,572
as soon as we got home,
and the procedure didn't work.

1499
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:43,117
And I was real,
you know, horny,
because of all the hormones.

1500
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:44,743
So we did it.

1501
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,247
I felt like a failure.

1502
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:48,050
And Carl told me
you were going
to get somebody else.

1503
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:50,819
Those hormones can also
give you a false negative.

1504
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:54,123
That's why they want you
to wait two weeks
before you take a test.

1505
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:56,391
Wait, what?
So she might
not be pregnant?

1506
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,524
Yo, where you
escape from, man?

1507
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,899
I'm saying
the baby might be Carl's,
but it might still be mine.

1508
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,562
Okay, then
forget what I said.

1509
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:04,662
I'm trying to
play catch-up here.

1510
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,004
So you get
your sister pregnant,

1511
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,043
but she slept with him?
No, she's not my sister.

1512
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:13,070
She's an ignorant
white trash woman
that I paid to carry my kid.

1513
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,543
I deserve that.

1514
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:16,606
No, you don't.

1515
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:17,743
How could you do that?

1516
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:19,252
This is why I didn't

Hi.
How are you feeling?

Embarrassed.
I fainted
in the delivery room.

Well, Oscar's bringing you
a change of clothes,

and Mom is here,
in case you die.

I'm scared your friend, Angie,
has me on speed dial.

She called me, like,
10 times to get down here
and take care of you.

Hi. Well, we got
your blood work back.

You are slightly anemic,
which explains the fainting.

But there's something else
you need to know.

You're pregnant.

That's impossible.

of dollars to tell me
that that's impossible.

eight weeks along, but you are

were one in a million.
