1
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,060
ASTERIX & OBELIX AGAINST CAESAR

2
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,060
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

3
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,860
Soldiers, the soothsayers have pronounced themselves.

4
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,700
For the next moon, We will invade the Great Britain.

5
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,860
Caesar! Caesar!

6
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,460
Soldiers, the entire world is looking at you.

7
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,860
For the glory of Rome.

8
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,300
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

9
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,460
All Around The Country,,

10
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,060
To the smaller town, pay the Caesar's tax.

11
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,300
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

12
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,060
You promised To talk with him.
Talking of what?

13
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,940
You Know It very well. Of that Gallic town
that keeps on offering resistance.

14
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,860
to Caesar that Gallic town
he cares a pepper.

15
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,860
You Have something else that to do.
- we'll see. I will talk with him.

16
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,140
If you do it, I tell him that you resell part

17
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,380
of the foodstuff of the army to make a palace
in Rome for you.

18
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,780
- It Is lie.
- I have proofs.

19
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,900
Ah, good.
what do you say?

20
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,980
You Are worse than me, Detritus.

21
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,780
How flattering.

22
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,860
Do you find funny my discourse, Detritus?

23
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,660
No, no, Ceasar;
Of course not, he is than...

24
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,540
The fact is that Trolleybus remembered Belgians'
one of my histories.

25
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,460
Which One?

26
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,380
Come closer.

27
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,860
Go.

28
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,860
Look at me.

29
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,260
To the eyes.

30
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,300
You hide something from me.

31
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,540
Hiding something, me?

32
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,300
Caesar! I swear it to you for Trolleybus's head

33
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,540
And good you know how much I appreciate his friendship.

34
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,780
Yes, that they'll throw Trolleybus to
the lions if I tell lies. That!

35
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,380
Soldiers!

36
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,060
Why did we not manage to defeat those Gauls?

37
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,860
What does that town have special?

38
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,060
I understand that it's a very normal little town.

39
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,860
That it is similar to any
another Gallic town.

40
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,140
Guard, open the door, it's my cousin
with the ox.

41
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,180
Open! Hello cousin. How is it going?

42
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,300
Approach! Come closer! Come and look. Look!
Yes, look!

43
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,860
Look, come closer.
Fresh, very cheap fish.

44
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,540
Come here, fresh fish. Come,
fresh fish.

45
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,540
-Yes, a moment.
It is fresh, come closer, yes.

46
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,060
Come, come closer. That is fresh. It is fresh. It
is rich and cheap.

47
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,300
What do you want?... I already seen it.
look at... You Are Fantastic, hey!

48
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,340
I must tell to myself that my husband has
gotten fat lately.

49
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,940
I took it into account.
I reinforced everything.

50
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,860
Then, prove it.
yes.

51
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,700
Come, we go.
Yes!

52
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,620
Up!

53
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,300
How's it going?
Go Vercingetorix!

54
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,300
I would have liked to be an artist.

55
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,780
Shut up, bard!

56
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,220
It's not fresh, you keep it.

57
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,940
What? My fish is not fresh?

58
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,620
Try smelling it.
Look that's how good the smell

59
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,860
Your fish is not fresh. - That is not fresh?

60
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,700
Smell my fish.
My fish is fresh.

61
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,540
Maybe you can't smell that well?
Does it smell of the sea?

62
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,700
No, it's not fresh.
Yes, it is fresh.

63
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,060
No, it's not fresh.
Yes, it is fresh.

64
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,940
No, it is not fresh.
Yes, yes it is fresh.

65
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,540
No, it is not fresh!
Yes, it is fresh!

66
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,620
No, it is not fresh! No, it is not fresh!
Yes, it is fresh! Yes, it is fresh!

67
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,020
No, it is not fresh.

68
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,060
-Agecanonix.
-Ah, a fight. I wanna go there.

69
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,620
Agecanonix, you're no longer young.
You're 80 years old, my love.

70
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,300
Leave me alone of your desires.

71
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,060
Fresh or no, I don't want anymore.

72
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,700
A stork.

73
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,140
Have taken me for
a butterfly, Ordralfabetix?

74
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,860
Forgive, Panoramix.
I was distracted.

75
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,860
- The fish eyes!
- Is it fresh?

76
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,940
I said That; it is not fresh.

77
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,300
A great danger threatens the village.

78
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,780
It's written in the eye. Look!

79
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,900
It is a sign, a bad spirit wants to harm to us.

80
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,860
It is nearby. I feel their presence.

81
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,220
That the gods come
to help us.

82
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,300
Open the doors.

83
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,300
Talk, Caius Bonus, tell me everything.

84
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,860
They have a weapon secret, Governor. A magical potion.

85
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,060
A magical potion? Good, you take me a fool or what?

86
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,380
I wouldn't dare, Governor.

87
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,060
A druid manufactures it and they become invincible
when drinking it.

88
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,300
Invincibles?

89
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,060
Yes, it is a secret
given by their ancestors.

90
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,700
By Jupiter!

91
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:34,380
If somebody discovers that secret, he would be the
master of the world

92
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,940
For that reason I did not tell it to nobody

93
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,300
Imagine you conquering the other towns...

94
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,060
You have done good.
I would love to be master of the world!

95
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,700
How long does the effect of that magical potion last?

96
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,060
About 10 minutes.

97
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,220
Then they have to ask the druid for more potion.

98
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,540
Now you. Cut off the supplies of the magic
potion.

99
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,260
Gather the necessary soldiers.

100
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,300
I thought of it, but there is a problem.

101
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,540
-A problem?
-Yes, enormous.

102
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,860
A colossal Gaul that doesn't need to drink the potion again.

103
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,860
He fell in the pot full of
the magic potion when still a baby.

104
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,780
Neutralize him. Set him a trap.

105
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,220
Hypotyhenus will build it to you. He is my
engineer.

106
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,060
Will not be easy. He never separates from his friend.
That is very clever.

107
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,540
No worries, Hypotyhenus is a true child genius.

108
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,220
Do you hear? It is going to rain.
The sky is as good as covered.

109
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,620
If you continue that way, you will touch the sky with
the menhir's tip.

110
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,500
Do you think?

111
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,540
Yes, and if you tear it, it could
fall down on us

112
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,340
Don't say that, be quiet!
It's the only thing that makes me panic.

113
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,060
And you will fall with a loud sound.
Shut up!

114
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,860
I am kidding.
I do not find it funny.

115
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,380
You walk normal, that your jokes.

116
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,380
Never it is a common knowledge.
I prefer not to take the risk.

117
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,540
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

118
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,780
Here Asterix and Obelix rest.
Need to write yes,yes?

119
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,220
The lions adore
to the intellectuals.

120
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,860
Yes, they are more gentle
than the centurions.

121
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,380
If the Romans saw you. -the Romans, the Romans.

122
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,060
Not one to be seen in these past 15 days. Not an ambush,
or anything.

123
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,220
They no longer want to play; you hit them too hard,
and you you humiliate them.

124
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,860
Do I humiliate them?
Yes,a little.

125
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,700
They destroy Carthage, the entire world, the fact
that you fear them conquer.

126
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,860
And a fat uncle gives them beatings.

127
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,060
A fat uncle?
Yes.

128
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,460
What fat uncle?
Who do you speak of?

129
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,620
No, I meant a magnificent athlete named Obelix.

130
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,460
Ah, good.

131
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:42,940
Arrive already.

132
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,940
Rest stop? No. -No, is an Obelix grave tablet.

133
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
Are we dead?
No, not yet.

134
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,460
But I don't like this.

135
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,780
Now... we drop it
on the head.

136
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,500
Already! Flat
as cockroaches.

137
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,620
Six months... i waited this! 6 times humiliations
and beatings!

138
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,060
The idea of the rock
was it quite original, no?

139
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,860
Architect, I triplicate your
salary.

140
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,700
It good that i was fat,yeah?

141
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,540
And you, unyielding Gallic, I will sell your
entrails.

142
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,140
Oh, no. It can't be.
Its not possible!

143
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,860
For Pluto, its a nightmare. Its a nightmare!

144
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,860
Now!

145
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,300
You also help.
and what do you believe that I do ?

146
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,660
I filled it with magical potion before leaving.
How lucky!

147
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,780
Give me a bit.

148
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,780
No, you already fell in
the pot as a baby.

149
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,780
Enough.

150
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,700
It is necessary to do something. Soldiers, get on the rock, to the rock.

151
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,860
Caius Bonus. Oh Caius Bonus. My friend!

152
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,060
What happen?, Caius Bonus, do you no longer
want to play with your friends?

153
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,580
How idiotic!
You would get bored without us.

154
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,060
You have a very beautiful voice.

155
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,860
and you also sings well.

156
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,140
Iam not to blame,
Iam just following orders.

157
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,260
We do have good time together, no?

158
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,860
Yes.We did give a good beatings.

159
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,220
Yes, yes; but you hits me & my men too strong.

160
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,940
It can be controlled.
Do you promise it, Obelix?

161
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,700
Can't promises anything,
but I will try.

162
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,060
Then Caius Bonus,
think of it as a warning to your soldiers.

163
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,380
and next week
we mount ourselves a good one.

164
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,860
The idea Caius Bonus gives is not very valiant,
but yes imaginative?

165
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,580
They tried to crush a rock on on top of our
head.

166
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,580
See, they push the enormous rock down.

167
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,060
We seriously believe it fell fom the sky.

168
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,220
Hey, Obelix?

169
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,220
Have you eaten more than enough?

170
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,340
More than enough? Its only
my third boar.

171
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,300
Pardon,you only eaten up 3. For sure you
eat up 3 more, no?

172
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,300
No, only two.
At night I have my dinner fast.

173
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,980
Look at you, don't you think that you are
quite fat?

174
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,780
A little full.still the same.

175
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,860
Who is she?
What do you mean who is she?

176
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,580
Don't you recognize her? It is Falbala.

177
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,620
Falbala! The small Falbala? The small...?

178
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,060
Yes.
Looks different.

179
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,060
Yes,It was 8 years ago when she went to study in Lutecia.

180
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,700
Yes that has changed.
yes, she has grown a little bit.

181
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,700
And it has gain some kilos,
and well distributed.

182
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,620
Obelix!

183
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,860
She recognized -you.
Yes,Oh, Falbala!

184
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,300
My dear Obelix,
So happy see you again.

185
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,300
Because, you have changed so much. I didn't
recognized you.

186
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,860
On the other hand you look same;
with some more kilos.

187
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,220
No, no, no. Only
Just a bit full.

188
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,860
A little bit? Right, that is.
A little bit full.

189
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,060
Falbala!
A little bit full!

190
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,860
Ah, what wonderful smell!
I will eat up your boar.

191
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,300
Eat up it, I am not deaf.
What do you what you like?

192
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,220
Do you reject a boar? Are you sick? How are you?

193
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,220
Very well. Why? She does look that more
beautiful at night,aint she?

194
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,220
Do you not smell the perfume in the she gives?

195
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,140
Full moon!
Never have ive seen it.

196
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,460
You know that coquetuela it is the one that puts
you in this state?

197
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,660
Coquetuela? Of whom do you talk?
Of Falbala, evidently.

198
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,060
Take care of what you say.
No one talks about Falbala this way.

199
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,700
Well, unhand me, by Tutatis you want to choke
me.

200
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,380
Well, apology, apology.

201
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,780
Falbala is not a coquetuela. Falbala is... it is
Falbala!

202
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,860
For Falbala?

203
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,140
Will you take it with a chain around the neck?

204
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,540
A menhir to give commitment. - What?

205
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,900
Will you request her hand in marriage? -For
sure.

206
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,860
Are you crazy. Falbala is not the girl for you.

207
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,300
Why?

208
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,860
Doesn't make good couple; that is to say,I'm refering physically.

209
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,060
You don't understand what women want.

210
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,140
They don't care about the physique. What counts is
the love.

211
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,940
We'll See. Look at who you come.
Falbala.

212
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,300
Is it his brother the thin guy? - Her
brother?

213
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,780
Yes, Her brother. Looks, he kisses
her.

214
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,620
Not like a brother kisses
to their sister, Obelix.

215
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,460
Then it might her cousin.

216
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,220
Oh, please. Don't you see that its her boyfriend...

217
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,820
Better you propose another day.

218
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,380
Its her boyfriend?
Yes,her boyfriend.

219
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,700
Thin guy.
Yes... Very thin.

220
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,380
Lets go eat.

221
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,860
Open for the great treasurer Melosinus.

222
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,380
Come to collect the tax. It will spend here the
night.

223
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,380
Open up.

224
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,620
You can go already.

225
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,300
Come back tomorrow morning.

226
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,460
You, we don't pay overtimes.

227
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,100
I like to finish what I begin. I sleep better this way.

228
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,260
Close the doors.

229
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,380
I want it.

230
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,700
Imbecile.there's lot more in the chest.

231
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,820
But the chest is not ours.

232
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,060
Tomorrow it will be.

233
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,380
For Tutatis, the gods are in a bad mood
tonight.

234
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,380
Me too.

235
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,860
So eat correctly
or i will do for you.

236
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,300
No. That no!

237
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,540
-Have you loss your appetite?
I'm on diet.

238
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,380
Diet? You?
Yes.

239
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,300
You are right.
I am a little bit full.

240
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,460
Who is ? Who are you ?

241
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,620
Fortune teller Prolix, with my assistants Alambix and
Anorexix.

242
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,580
Enter.

243
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,500
Boss, a fortune-teller and their assistants
request hospitality for today.

244
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,220
A fortune-teller? Arrives in a good time. Let
him enter.

245
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,420
Another swindler that wants to eat and to sleep free.

246
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,620
Dont be so suspicious!

247
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,860
I have some questions
for the fortune-teller.

248
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,300
Welcome to our village.

249
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,300
We knew that we would be
very received.

250
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,380
Where do you read the future, fortune-teller?

251
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,860
In a good hot soup
and in lukewarm beer.

252
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,900
How original.

253
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,900
Arrive in good moment. Karabella.

254
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,940
What, what, what, what?
Did you see something?

255
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,860
I see a treasure.
A treasure?

256
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,860
Treasure!

257
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,780
An enormous treasure will arrive
to your village.

258
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,940
Karabella, it serves why our friend is here.

259
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,540
There are Roman around the treasure. Many Romans.

260
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,540
Are the Romans for me,
yes?

261
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,460
Seize the treasure.
It is a good idea.

262
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,100
And later? continue!

263
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,220
We party in Lutecia.

264
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,220
I know a stupendous restaurant.

265
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,220
I can't see anything.

266
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,860
In here somebody emits
a negative waves.

267
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,220
My decoder one doesn't work. There is no image.

268
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,060
Asterix, go away.
Me? Why?

269
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,860
Its an order.

270
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,460
Already return. I have it.
Yes? What do you see? What do you see?

271
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,860
With this treasure
you will lift an army.

272
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,860
And you will expel the
the Romans from Gaul.

273
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,860
You heard that Karabella?

274
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,860
You have married the new Vercingetorix.

275
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,140
Well, and like you are the cause, go
look the fire for the wood.

276
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,860
I have a friend very in love with a young boy...

277
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,860
You want to know if
she will marry him.

278
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,780
How did you guessed it?

279
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,860
I am a fortune-teller.
Yes, it is certain.

280
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
Asterix!

281
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,620
Asterix... You know what
did the fortune-teller tell me?

282
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,700
That you will marry Falbala. -Yes, are
you also a fortune-teller too?

283
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,700
No; They are swindlers. -No he's not a swindler

284
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,460
He has seen
that Falbala loves me.

285
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,140
I tell you that Falbala
will marry Tragicomix.

286
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,300
Falbala loves me. What already happens does not count.

287
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,860
I would have said it.
Love is delicate.

288
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,780
Do you understand? It is like a flower.

289
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,620
Time are necessary so that she will able to blossom.

290
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,460
Oh, yes!

291
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,300
Undoubtedly don't understand anything. You never
understood anything. Anything!

292
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,780
You drive me crazy.
You drive me crazy.

293
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,860
You drive me crazy, Obelix!

294
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,300
The Romans. The marines.
The Romans. The Romans.

295
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,540
The Romans. The rom... The Romans? The Romans are
there!

296
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,860
Romans!

297
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,060
Druid!prepare the magic potion.

298
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,140
The Romans have arrived.
The Romans.

299
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,300
Dejadmelos, they are not more than 20. You are
selfish.

300
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,540
I have left 3 drops,
it will be enough.

301
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,220
For pity, for pity,
Don't you enter that village.

302
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,300
For last time, this is madness.

303
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,460
You are indeed crazy, centurion.

304
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,580
Do know with whom you speak? I am the treasurer
of the counties.

305
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,580
Collector of the tax for Caesar.

306
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,860
These Gauls drink a magic potion that makes them
invincible.

307
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,220
They will tear you into pieces!

308
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,460
You are being delirious.
Separate from my road.

309
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,700
Welcome, Roman.
thanks, Gaul.

310
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,620
Ive come to get paid
for the tax to give Caesar.

311
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,140
No worries, the money
it will be used well.

312
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,860
It will use to build roads.

313
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,780
Maintainance for the army that will protect you
from your enemies.

314
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,700
and to cover the deficit.

315
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,700
Well, very well. That is...
That is the minimum thing.

316
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,140
You honor us a lot that for accepting our modest
contribution.

317
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,460
Asterix, Obelix, give him
the tax for Caesar.

318
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,700
What is that?

319
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,300
What the Roman soldiers abandon in the
battlefield,

320
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,540
Every time that we face them.

321
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,540
That don't bothers to run.

322
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,460
In a blacksmith, the price for metal, you
can get a good bargain.

323
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,460
It would also be an interest
to an antique dealer.

324
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,300
With this helmet a oil lamp can be made.

325
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,460
And this armor can be use as mold to make
cookies.

326
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,380
Raze the village!

327
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:53,660
My treasure! My treasure!
Oh, my treasure!

328
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,300
Never spoke this way to me. Not even when we were
engaged.

329
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,700
To my arms, fortune-teller.
By Tutatis.

330
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,700
Never been heard such an
extraordinary fortune-teller as you.

331
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,780
And now, do tell me, what will it happen? Say it!
Say it!

332
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,060
Iam not fortune-teller, but I will tell it to you.

333
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,140
If we don't return this treasure at once to
Caesar,

334
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,140
We will be presented with all their legions.

335
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,060
That it is presented,
That it is presented!

336
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,860
With their money, I will create an army.

337
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,780
I plan to wait him here... And I
will conquer him.

338
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,020
Told it to you. This gold will bring bad luck for
our village.

339
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,780
Then, we will vote.

340
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,780
Those that you want the treasure, to the right

341
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,380
Those that want to return it,
to the left.

342
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,380
I want the money, but not to lose a friend. I
abstain.

343
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,060
Result gives the voting:
We keep the treasure!

344
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,220
Yes! Well! Well!

345
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,260
Did you call me, Caesar?

346
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,300
They have stolen the money
from the taxes.

347
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,300
What? How dare you? Miserable!

348
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,460
No... Its not Malosinus.

349
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,540
He fell in an ambush that
the Gauls set him.

350
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,140
And yet you still live?

351
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,900
Did u not defended the money
of the Caesar give until the end?

352
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,860
Unfortunate!

353
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,460
Those Gauls live in the town that resists to my
legions

354
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,860
For months.
Do you already know it?

355
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,860
Do you already know it?
Iam speaking to you, Detritus.

356
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,220
To me Detritus,
Whom the Caesar speaks.

357
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,780
Good, it is a town. Let us say a village better,
and even this way...

358
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,340
Why you have not told me anything?

359
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,700
Don't want to bother the great Caesar for a
small matter.

360
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,860
A small matter.

361
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,100
A small matter!

362
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,940
They rebel against the Caesar.

363
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,380
They resist to the Roman legions.

364
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,620
Not happy with not paying the tribute that they owe me to,

365
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,780
They steal the money of my taxes from me.

366
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,780
and doesn't that have importance?

367
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,580
You are right, Caesar.
It is extremely serious.

368
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,580
I will order them to toss to Malosinus to the lions.
What do you say?

369
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,860
That you prepare my escort. I leave
immediately for Petibónum.

370
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,540
and with Malosinus, what do we do?

371
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,540
If you don't solve this before
the next moon,

372
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,780
It will be you to who we toss
to the lions.

373
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,060
The Caesar arrives. The Caesar arrives.

374
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,940
Clear. Get ready. Everything
tidy up. Hurry!

375
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,300
How many are they?
some 50, approximately.

376
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,460
-And us?
-close to 500, noble Caesar.

377
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,380
Five hundred?
yes.

378
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,620
Do tell me centurion, are you making fun of me by
any chance?

379
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,700
And casually do you not make fun of me?

380
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:17,060
Me? I will explain to it now because I can do
it...

381
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,540
No is explanations. Attack the village,
immediately!

382
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,460
Obelix, you will be my
personal guard commander.

383
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,940
To your orders, Abraracourcix.

384
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,780
and I name Assurancetourix

385
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,860
-Yes?
-Minister of Culture.

386
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,220
Remain silent you, be quiet!

387
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,860
and me, what will I be, hey?

388
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,860
You will be Minister
of the Former Combatants.

389
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,060
Of the Former Combatants?
Why does the Former one give?

390
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,220
I want to be
the combatants.

391
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,060
High!

392
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,060
Its for the Gauls.
They will recognize me this way.

393
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,860
Form the turtle!

394
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,700
Ministry of Supplies it will be held by
Ordralfabetix.

395
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,460
Of supplies? But if their fish is not fresh.

396
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,220
Boss. Boss!
What?

397
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,700
Anything for Asterix?

398
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,060
I have forgotten of him.

399
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,540
He will have the Ministry
of the National Depression,

400
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,380
of the Systematic Denigracion and of the
Environmental Pessimism.

401
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,940
I think that
will be enough.

402
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,860
Asterix, what are you doing?

403
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,860
Returning that is of Caesar.

404
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,580
He drank
the magic potion.

405
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,580
Obelix, brings back the treasure.
Bring back the treasure!

406
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,060
-Yes.
Bring back the treasure!, Obelix.

407
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,780
But, what are they doing?

408
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,420
Are you crazy?

409
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,140
They make fun of me.

410
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,380
Asterix, return it. Boss!

411
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,380
Help, Help Obelix. Help him!

412
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,220
Attack!

413
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,380
Turtles, ahead. Going!

414
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,020
Gauls, to me, Gaul!
The Romans attack.

415
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,060
Drink all the magic potion.

416
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,300
For Tutatis!

417
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,460
Attacks! Attacks!

418
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,700
Turtles! Attack!

419
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,740
This way! This way!

420
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,140
No sleeping.

421
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,300
Return to combat!
Close the doors!

422
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,060
There, there.
No, no. There it is Caius Bonus.

423
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,460
Attack, Attack!
If not, to the lions.

424
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,780
Somebody inside? -answer when ask.

425
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,780
How educated.

426
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,780
Those Gauls are some
true savages.

427
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,780
Some savages.

428
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,620
But, they make sense
of the rhythm they give, hey?

429
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,100
Leave me one, leave me one.

430
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,700
Agecanonix, it is harmful for your heart.

431
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,860
My treasure, I beg it to you. Listen, no!

432
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,140
Leave alone me.

433
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,700
Come, grandfather, have a good time.

434
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,460
He will harm you.
It is all mine.

435
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,540
Still agile.
-yes.

436
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,060
My pequeñín!

437
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,060
You have broken to my pequeñín.

438
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,780
No effect from the potion? I forgot to
take it.

439
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,380
Memory goes.

440
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,540
-The Romans.
-wait, waits. Look, Bonus!

441
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,700
Surrender, Gaul;
and I will spare your life.

442
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,660
yes.

443
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,700
For me. Here, here, here! -yes, for you.

444
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,700
Look, Asterix, there is some very new, very
handsome.

445
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,060
How handsome they are those Romans. - No, no, no!

446
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,460
Get the Romans!

447
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,140
That face looks familiar to me.
Me too

448
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,460
Don't know.

449
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,220
Hey, the one that with the laurel crown
above the head.

450
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,380
Me?
Yes. look to the side.

451
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,540
How dare the barbarian
speak to me.

452
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,300
Terrible.-but if he is Julius.

453
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,540
For Tutatis, you are right.
He is Julius Caesar.

454
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,060
Old Julius.

455
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,700
Do tell me, and your army?
We will have a good time a while.

456
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,860
Don't mock or he will send all his army to us.

457
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,300
Dont ask him anything.

458
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,460
Leave. Hey, Julius, waits... We want to laugh a bit
more.

459
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,620
But... Oh, Julius.
You have offended him, Obelix.

460
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,060
Release me!
I have a new song.

461
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,380
Prolix, when will the gaul is free,

462
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,220
I will name you Prefect
General of Counties.

463
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,220
You knew him.
Ah, yes. How silly am I.

464
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,860
So,let's drink in honor of the
greatest of the fortune tellers.

465
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,300
For our friend Prolix.

466
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,100
Don't put that face.

467
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,700
No, I refuse to drink
for that viper.

468
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,060
Now, I guess,
you speak to us now of my destiny.

469
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,540
I see you encircled by Roman. I see you
triumphant. I see you in Rome.

470
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:07,540
Rome! And what am i to do in Rome? Speak,
speak, quickly!

471
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,540
You are what you believe, hey?

472
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,780
There are interferences.
Again the negative waves.

473
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,940
Well, expert. The negative waves will walk away.

474
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,860
No, no. wait.
I want to speak with both.

475
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,100
You should reconcile.
This is an order.

476
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,540
-Iam not asking anything else.
-Have you heard what I said?

477
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,860
I am not deaf.

478
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,380
-To finish this, you should kiss yourselves. -Oh, no.

479
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,860
You should do it.

480
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,620
Among us, four.

481
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,860
-How it itches!
-How beautiful, yes; very beautiful.

482
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,540
In our tadition, when two men reconcile,

483
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,300
They should share tortilla
for friendship.

484
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,060
What beautiful tradition. Karabella, bring me eggs.

485
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,300
Something against
the mushrooms Asterix?

486
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,140
If they are not poisonous, no.

487
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,300
Not to worry, I will eat
as many as you.

488
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,540
After eating up
the tortilla of friendship,

489
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,060
I will speak to you of your future.

490
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,020
Please, please.

491
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,860
Delicious.

492
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,780
I love it

493
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,060
Obelix, please imitate Caesar above their horse
again.

494
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,220
If I do it it will be already done it
more than 20 times.

495
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,780
Please!

496
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,060
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar, Caesar!

497
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,540
Can't eat it no more.
No, you must finish it.

498
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,380
Its tradition. Here we go, here we go.

499
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,780
Finish already... Now, we are already really friends.

500
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,300
Are you well?
I feel hot.

501
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,940
The heat of friendship.

502
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,140
Look at me, Asterix, and listen to me.

503
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,700
-Do you hear me, Asterix?
I hear you.

504
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,860
Julius Caesar is my worst enemy. Repeat!

505
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,060
Julius Caesar is my worst enemy.

506
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,660
I will put an end to him.

507
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,300
I will put an end to him.

508
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,580
Obelix, make it for me, please.

509
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,940
You have already heard it.

510
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,380
Julius was there, looking fantastic. Sitting down in their
white horse.

511
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:44,780
Being encircled by their escort. He looks
at me. I look him; that is to say, we look cross-eyed.

512
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,460
And I say, by Tutatis, I have seen that face
somewhere.

513
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,820
Took out a coin, and I look at it.

514
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,540
He was looking at the other side, and the coin was
looking at the reverse side.

515
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,860
Can you see it? Caesar has come
to challenge you here.

516
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,420
Among your villagers.
This is intolerable!

517
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,300
You cannot tolerate this!

518
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,060
should put an end to him.

519
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,140
should put an end to him!

520
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,020
In my Opinion, they did not say
that i've had repressed my blows.

521
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,060
-Get down of the horse, Caesar.Come look at
a Gaul.

522
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,060
You will pay for the damage that you've done to
Gaul, you miserable.

523
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,940
How dare the barbarian
speak to me

524
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,060
Wait, I will help you down.

525
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,580
-What happen to him?
-Who knows?.

526
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,700
What is happening to him?
He's acting strange.

527
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,460
Ah, Caesar!

528
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,700
It bounce?

529
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,140
Iam not Caesar! Don't you recognize me? I am Obelix,
your friend.

530
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,140
I will destroy, Caesar. -but... Asterix,
Asterix.

531
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,220
Don't harm him.

532
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,620
Drinking magic potion has made him possesed and
become crazy.

533
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,780
Impossible, the potion should not be used to fight
among Gaul.

534
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,540
Impossible.

535
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,780
The druid will make the antidote,
I will look for him.

536
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,860
Trying to escape, Caesar.
You are a coward.

537
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,860
Come fight me.
Thats enough.

538
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,540
Druid, make an antidote.
Asterix has become crazy.

539
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,140
Indeed.

540
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,060
This is your end, Caesar.

541
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,060
Look out!

542
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,780
Vercingetorix!

543
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,540
Return to the reality.
I have retaliated!

544
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,220
Come, Its me, Obelix. Now return.
The Great Caesar has surrendered!

545
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,860
Esautomatix looks for
to Assurancetourix.

546
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,700
Treat the bad influence with another bad influence.

547
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,060
We need you.

548
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,900
What?
Yes.

549
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,300
Come,plays your song. It will cure him.

550
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,220
And you what you want, eunuch? To -sing for you.

551
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,060
Poor Asterix.

552
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,540
The remedy is violent,
but it can work.

553
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,060
No, Assurancetourix, for. Abraracourcix, make him
remain silent.

554
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,260
Obelix, what has happen? But,
why have they gotten me tied up?

555
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,180
You are cured. You recognized me.

556
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,780
You have frightened us.
You confused me with Caesar.

557
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,780
With Caesar?
Yes. Don't you remember?

558
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,380
No. No, no, no, wait.

559
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,060
I remember eating the tortilla mushroom
that Prolix gives.

560
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,700
They were hallucinogenic mushrooms. Prolix has drugged
you.

561
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,940
Where has it happened, where? - Has it
disappeared?

562
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,140
That viper for sure
have stolen the treasure.

563
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,460
The treasure!

564
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,140
He has taken it.
He has taken it!

565
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,380
Get rid of the good.
Now we will be calm.

566
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,060
Good-bye treasure! Good-bye Caesar!

567
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,260
I will find the solution to reduce those Gauls. Not
to worry.

568
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,380
Come, I will listen to you.
I am thinking.

569
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,340
How slow.
Wait, waits.

570
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,540
Its coming.
Its coming.

571
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,940
I will help you think.

572
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,860
My Mamma, a real lion.

573
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,140
Hurry up or your you will be
their next banquet.

574
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:56,380
Already have it, Caesar, I already have it. It is
necessary to neutralize the druid.

575
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,060
This way they won't be able to to prepare the magic
potion that makes them invincible.

576
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,060
And how will we plan this?

577
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,060
In 2 days there's a meeting of the druids
in the region

578
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,860
In their sacred forest. This is an ideal occasion
to act.

579
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,500
We promised to the druids that a Roman will never disturb..

580
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,220
In their sacred forest.

581
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,860
The promises that Caesar give only for those believe them.

582
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,300
I leave a full pot
in case something happen in my absence.

583
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,540
It will be enough.

584
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,940
I don't like that you leave, Panoramix.

585
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,780
With Asterix and Obelix to give escort, there won't
be any risk.

586
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,140
Foward, Obelix.

587
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,860
Falbala!... i'm going! - Obelix!

588
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,780
Come, Idefix.

589
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,540
Lets go, my little bug.

590
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,700
Here the sacred forest begins.

591
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,820
Onlt the druids can pass into here. Wait here.

592
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,140
Idefix, warn me if there are any problems.Now go.

593
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,940
I declare the opening the 2 thousand yers old ceremony
by presenting th Golden Sickle.

594
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,860
As annually, this sickle will be granted to the
best druid among us.

595
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,060
I call to the druid Plaintecontrix.

596
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:31,380
My potion gives to that that drinks it a
superhuman force.

597
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:36,860
And during near 10 minutes it is practically
invincible.

598
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,300
You will see, I will choose one at random.

599
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,860
see... Yourself... Yes, you.

600
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,780
Yes, you. Come here.

601
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,940
come. We go.

602
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,300
Drink. Slowly.

603
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,260
If that is certain,
thanks to your magic potion

604
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,300
We could expel the Romans out of Gaul.

605
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,060
Cannot,because Mathusalix,
my old teacher,

606
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,460
He trusted me the secret of the potion with the
condition of that

607
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,140
Its is use only to defend,
and not to attack.

608
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,300
You will already understand why.
Do you see that rock?

609
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:40,460
Will you lift it and sustain above your head.

610
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,060
I believe that you all will agree.

611
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,860
This year Panoramix
will take the Golden sickle.

612
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:05,540
Now, imagine that this man is a vile, ambitious
being.

613
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,140
And without scruples; or worse still that is a
Roman.

614
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,460
Ohh yes, I am a Roman.

615
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,060
Guards!

616
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:27,860
Want some?

617
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,700
You were happier when
you didn't go on diet.

618
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,620
Although if you lose weight, Falbala
won't marry you.

619
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,380
Falbala doesn't love you.
She loves Tragicomix.

620
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,540
You say it because you are jealous. You are crazy.

621
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,380
One day you will find somebody.

622
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,460
And then you will understand what is to love, and
to be loved.

623
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,380
Now eat a bit.

624
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,380
Dont die of hunger because of her.

625
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,700
Good, only a bite.

626
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,740
What it happen Idefix? Panoramix. Did
something happen to Panoramix?

627
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,540
Its forbidden, but it is necessary to go. Give me.

628
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,380
Now it is not the moment.
We go now, hurry up.

629
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,780
Where are you?

630
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:26,860
Which is he?

631
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,860
sacrilege!

632
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,740
This forest is sacred.
You do not have a right to be here.

633
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,460
Makes no difference.
Where is Panoramix?

634
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,780
You defied that's prohibited. Shame on you.

635
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,300
Tell us where is Panoramix
or we leave you hanging.

636
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,020
Until you fall down
as an acorn.

637
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:51,060
the Romans took him. They have betrayed us.

638
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,300
Asterix looks,I think Idefix has something.

639
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,700
Give it to me, dog.

640
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,460
Its a piece of Panoramix tunic.
Go look for,looks for it, dog.

641
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,380
-Walk.
-Idefix will find the trail.

642
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,620
For Tutatis, let us down..

643
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,700
or I will curse you until
the tenth generation.

644
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,300
Its not our druid.
Don't talk nonsense.

645
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,380
Good, Good, Ill do it.
Well, here we go.

646
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,860
You should say thank you.

647
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,860
The Romans, the Romans. Roman everywhere.

648
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,300
Romans, thousands of Roman.
The Romans, the Romans!

649
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,740
There are still a pot
full of magic potion.

650
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,220
But later, what do we make?
I warn you, I warn you.

651
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,260
The army of the Caesar.
We are served.

652
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,540
Where do think you are going?
To liberate Panoramix.

653
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,780
Let me think.

654
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,860
Hey, you.

655
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,780
Come here.

656
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,860
Return it. return it.

657
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:49,780
Give me the sandwich.
Give me the sandwich. Give it to me!

658
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,540
You that have a superior intelligence

659
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,860
Do you know why you are here.

660
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,300
You want the formula
for the magic potion.

661
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,940
To make what?

662
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,700
I can read it in your face
the ambition and the wickedness.

663
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,860
You want to dethrone Caesar
and to reign in Rome.

664
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,100
Iam an open book for you.

665
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,860
Then you should understand that
you should give me that formula.

666
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,620
I rather die.

667
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:23,060
Rather die here? Never! You will not
take your secret to the grave

668
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,540
No, druid, you won't die.

669
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:28,460
But, on the other hand, if you don't give me

670
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,460
The formula of your magic potion, you will
regret to have been born.

671
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,540
This machine was built

672
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,860
For inflictingunbearable sufferings.

673
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,460
Its my idea.

674
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,220
Good, I will let you to try it. I will return in
some minutes.

675
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,460
Think again before
giving me an answer.

676
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,540
You Wait, wait, wait. Take.

677
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,140
Ok already. Here we go.

678
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,380
Repeat for last time. Who are you?

679
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:05,740
Iam Obelus, legionary of
the 2nd Cohort, third Manípulo.

680
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,860
And me?
Asterix, my best friend.

681
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,220
Do you make it on purpose?
Im sorry. No, no.

682
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,380
You are Asterix,
The infamous Gaul spy.

683
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,220
Is that everything?
No, no.

684
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,860
I made you prisoner when you entered in the camp

685
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,540
To liberate to the druid.

686
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,140
And to whom do you want to surrender?

687
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,780
I don't know. I usually gives menhirs, not friends.

688
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,540
-To Caesar, stupid... Well.Now agree. To
stupid Caesar.

689
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,460
Is he Julius Ceasar's relative? what?

690
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,700
Stupid Ceasar, is he Julius Ceasar's relative?

691
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,700
What stupid Caesar?
You give me to Julius Caesar.

692
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,380
You are stupid.
I think they called me Obelus.

693
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:40,460
You drive me crazy!
We start from scratch.

694
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,620
You are Obelus, do you agree? -Agree.

695
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,140
Give me to Julius Caesar,
do you agree?

696
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:44,860
Agree.

697
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,700
And when Obelus says, for Tutatis you are Obelix"

698
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,780
You become Obelix;
and not before.

699
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,540
when Obelus says, for Tutatis you are Obelix", I
become

700
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:56,620
to Obelix and not before.
It is clear. I have understood it.

701
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,620
Finally.

702
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,860
Abduct Caesar and we change it for Panoramix. That
simple.

703
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,140
Hey where are you going?

704
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,300
I should mistreat you so that you look like an authentic
prisoner.

705
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,460
Say, doesn't Falbala love me? - What? To what
does this come?

706
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,300
Anything.

707
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,540
you are a Gaul spy, and you are mine.

708
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,460
Do You Believe That she loves me?
a great deal, a great deal; You love you very much.

709
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,380
Falbala adores you, adores you.
You are the man of her life.

710
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,300
Man of her life? How well.

711
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,300
What do you want, legionary? To see the Caesar
and to give him this.

712
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,540
To give that to the Caesar? funny. Go somewhere else.

713
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:52,860
To me the guard! To me the guard! To me the guard!

714
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,620
Take me before Caesar.
I should give him this.

715
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,700
What is it?

716
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,380
A Gaul spy. He tried to enter in the
camp.

717
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,820
He claims to be the so-called druid's assistant

718
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,540
Are you Panoramix's assistant, the druid?

719
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,460
Yes.

720
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,580
That he has important secrets to reveal
to the Caesar.

721
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,500
Yes, yes.

722
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,540
Old druida, you will not last then
you will speak.

723
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,060
Do what you want.
Do your worse...

724
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,700
Move from here.

725
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,300
Ah, yes?

726
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:48,380
Over there.

727
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,060
Hello. You are the assistant
to Panoramix?

728
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,220
Yes.

729
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,700
-Brave legionary. Your name? -Obelus. Legionary
Obelus.

730
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,860
Very well Obelus, I will
triplicate your salary.

731
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,380
I have a hole here.

732
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,420
Well, take him to the kitchen
and serve him what he requests.

733
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,940
Obelus... By Tutatis!

734
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:24,900
Obelus, Obelus... By Tutatis!

735
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,860
Druid, druid,
do you know this man?

736
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,300
Never saw him.

737
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,780
Useless to lie, Panoramix.
He knows that I am your assistant.

738
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,060
I help you to prepare
the magic potion.

739
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,860
To the machine.
Put him in the machine.

740
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,380
And now?

741
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,700
Obelus, by Tutatis, become Obelix.

742
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,300
Obelus, by Tutatis...
You harm me.

743
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,540
The boar chops are small.

744
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:33,060
Those are lamb.Boar is for savages. Do you want some
chickens?

745
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,700
Yes... About 20. I on a diet. - How many?

746
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,700
Somebody screams, no?
Its only the beginning.

747
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,060
Come here, Idefix, comes.
Your chop. Come.

748
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,060
Not the feet, Not the feet!

749
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,620
You are hurting me.

750
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,780
We are to the limit. If you insist you can die, I
prevent that.

751
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,580
A Gaul can die,
but never surrender.

752
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,220
Do you agree?
Yes. In principle definitely.

753
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:09,260
But in practice it is necessary to
be a little more flexible.

754
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,340
You have wanted it.

755
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,300
Yes, my dog. Yes, my bug.

756
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,220
see to look for the fat.
See to look for the fat.

757
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,300
Put the dog in
place of the Gaul.

758
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,780
-No, you cannot do that! - You Will not dare?

759
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,140
Iam mad.

760
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:38,540
Stop! You have won. I will manufacture you the
magic potion.

761
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,540
They will raze the town, Panoramix.

762
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:43,860
Insurance. This disgusting one
just wants the magic potion

763
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,420
to eliminate Caesar
and replace him.

764
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,380
You understand everything, druid.

765
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:54,540
I don't care of your town. It is Rome what I want!

766
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:59,460
Me, Detritus, I want
to reign in Rome!

767
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,180
Idefix.

768
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,300
A white dog with black stains?

769
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,780
No.
No!

770
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,380
Idefix!

771
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,060
...You want to reign.
Ah, no!

772
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,940
Olibrius!

773
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,460
Arrest the traitor
Detritus immediately.

774
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,060
Bring him in 5 minutes.
No, I don't want see him again.

775
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,220
Put him in a prison
before tossing it to the lions.

776
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,620
No one supports traitors in our family.

777
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:31,140
Bruto can tell it to you.
Hey, Bruto?

778
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,220
Certainly. You are right, dad.

779
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,460
Leave step.

780
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,700
Detritus,by the order of the Caesar you are
arrested.

781
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,380
What? To me, my guard.

782
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,060
Take it.
but, but, what?

783
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,540
but... My guard! But...

784
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:03,660
Idefix!

785
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,780
How Lucky.
Where is my prisoner?

786
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,860
Not at this moment. Its known already.
Its over.

787
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:16,460
Iam not talking to you, understood?
Hey, where is my prisoner?

788
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,620
Do you not see that myself
am I a prisoner?

789
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,860
Arrest this man.
he's an accomplice.

790
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:21,860
Ah, yes?

791
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,620
Soldier, you are the man
that I need.

792
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,540
You are now my personal guard.

793
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,700
But where is my prisoner?

794
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,620
Not to worry about him.
He's very well.Now listens.

795
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:46,460
If you help me to capture Caesar I will name you
my great centurion.

796
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,300
-To capture Caesar?
-Yes.

797
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,060
Thats a good idea.

798
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,380
Guards!

799
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,140
Caesar...

800
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,860
On behalf of the Roman town, you are arrested.

801
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:12,100
To prison, and watch over him night and day.

802
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:15,900
Tiquetdebus, join the army. I will make a
declaration.

803
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:21,300
Soldiers, our boss,
the very dear Julius Caesar,

804
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,460
Have just gotten gravely sick.

805
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,780
He have asked me to take over, while we hope that he recover,

806
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,780
Until he is well and takes back the control. - Well!

807
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,540
Views the circumstances,
I'll double your salary.

808
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,060
Well!

809
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,860
And I also announce you
the appointment

810
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,700
of the legionary Obelus,
to centurion level,

811
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,220
He will be in charge of my personal security.

812
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:01,540
In short, to attract the benevolence of
the gods,

813
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,460
So that they try to hurry
the cure of Caesar,

814
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,300
There will be some games organized this same afternoon.

815
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,460
and all are invited.

816
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,060
Can i see my prisoner?

817
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,780
You will see it during the games, agree?

818
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,500
Very well. Yes!

819
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:24,260
Nobody can pass through here.
Nobody must happen.

820
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:25,620
You stay here.
Me here.

821
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,300
Nothing will happen.

822
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:41,060
do have what you need?

823
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:42,940
No.

824
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,860
What do you want now?
My assistant.

825
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,860
Imagined that. Here he is.

826
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:53,860
I have taken some cautions. You understand me,
druid.

827
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,540
Your assistant cannot drink the magic potion
before me.

828
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:41,780
Already?

829
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:46,060
Only have to pronounce
the magic formula.

830
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:48,260
Go, what are you waiting for?

831
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:50,540
My assistant should repeat it after me.

832
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,860
Well. Remove him the gag.

833
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,700
My assistant is a bit far.

834
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:21,860
What does he says?

835
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,860
For Tutatis, Asterix,
you should drink the potion.

836
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,700
For Tutatis, if we failed we will drink broth.

837
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,700
Yes, you should do it now!

838
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,860
No!
Burn horrors!

839
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,140
Brave, Panoramix.

840
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,940
You have played and you have lost.

841
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,060
My vengeance will be terrible.

842
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,540
Good, let us prove this potion.

843
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,500
If unfortunately it is
a vulgar soup of vegetables,

844
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:08,860
It you who will be
digusted.I warn you.

845
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,060
A very touching moment.

846
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,940
It worked!

847
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:58,860
In prison.There won't be a lot of time, believe me.

848
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,860
But,what does Obelix do?

849
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:19,500
When I am an Emperor I will make you into a general.

850
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:21,380
and Caesar?

851
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,540
Caesar? Who is that?

852
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,700
Falbala!

853
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,100
-Gaul, do you like animals? -yes. Why?

854
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,860
You will be well served.

855
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:25,700
Centurions! Legionaries!

856
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:29,460
The bets will close to
the entrance of each prisoner.

857
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,380
Do your bet. - Bets? What do you bet?

858
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:35,900
A prisoner leaves for the door at the bottom, then vs
what he gives?

859
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,060
It must cross the water pool and get to this sand.

860
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,780
If he arrives until here,
I spare his life.

861
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,060
Do you follow me?
Yes.

862
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,460
I bet the animal will eat him. It is my
idea.

863
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,860
And if here gets here?
That, that never happens.

864
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:55,220
But if you bet your pay
of centurion, thousand against one,

865
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:56,860
Accept the bet.
Agree.

866
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,860
Your pay? Thousand against one?

867
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:04,300
oh! You are cold blood. I like it. Shake!

868
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:06,700
Accept the bet.

869
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:11,220
And my prisoner? You said that i would see him
in the games.

870
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:12,940
In fact, there he is.

871
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:28,300
Legionaries,the first prisoner is the Gaul
Asterix.

872
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:46,300
Obelus! Obelus!

873
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,780
Become Obelix!

874
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:53,860
Obelus!

875
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,140
Obelus! What is this?

876
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:27,220
I don't like this.
Need to get out.

877
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:42,140
Brave! Well done!

878
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:57,700
But, why are they here? Ah, no, no, no.

879
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,780
I prefer to leave.

880
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:12,060
Do you worry about your bet, hey?

881
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:29,860
Behind, behind.

882
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:35,220
That gaul is clever, hey?
a little yes

883
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:41,540
Obelix change!
Obelix! Doesnt he understands anything.

884
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,380
Obelix!

885
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,460
Go sleep in your cage,
go to the cage.

886
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:56,780
Now big lizards, no!

887
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:00,380
Go sleep.

888
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,300
For Tutatis!

889
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:41,780
Oh, no!

890
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:56,140
Obelus, by Tutatis, change...

891
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:01,020
Never saw anybody survive to that point.

892
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:07,700
You have lost, Obelus.
A thousand times your pay, do you remember?

893
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:57,140
What that Gaul
did is extraordinary.

894
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:08,540
Obelus! Obelus! For... Silence!

895
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:13,060
Obelus, by Tuta...!
Oh, but... For Your...! Oh!

896
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,780
Eat thid, you enormous beast.

897
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:16,460
Obelus! Obelus!
Obelus, by Tuta...!

898
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,860
You said that if he arrived here
you spare his life.

899
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,380
yes, that Caesar; but I am entitled to a joker.

900
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:31,300
And is your joker an animal? -Worst, It is a
man!

901
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:37,140
Obelus... by Tutatis!

902
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:42,780
Listen,isn't it curious.
It seems that he is speaking to you.

903
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:46,700
What does he say? Cannot hear anything.
I will read the lips, hey.

904
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,780
Do you know how to make it?
Yes, I have the skill of a spy.

905
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:01,860
Said exactly:

906
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:05,380
Obelus, by Tutatis, become Obelix. It is urgent.

907
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:09,300
Are you sure?... Ah, good! I tell you that yes.

908
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:14,700
You separate your hands.

909
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:25,580
What kept you? I made request for your help one hour ago.

910
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:28,300
With the noise i didn't hear anything. It is
necessary to free Panoramix.

911
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,700
Where is he?
Below.

912
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,140
Go to them.

913
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,780
For Tutatis, you have been in charge.
Yes.

914
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:37,060
You alone.
Guards, go go.

915
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,300
Brave, Obelix!

916
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:58,300
Go, we go, we go, quickly..come we go

917
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,740
No, no; I don't like the spiders. Im not gonna cross.

918
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,860
I have an idea.

919
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,860
I will blow them.

920
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,700
Obelix, Panoramix!

921
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,700
Wait, Obelix, I'll teach you.

922
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:40,220
Come here!
Lets go!

923
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,700
Watchout for the cats.

924
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,300
Horn, Roman. Here.

925
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,060
Which way? Somewhere around, yes, yes. We -are
here, Panoramix.

926
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:09,300
Idefix, my dog!

927
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:11,860
My bug!

928
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:17,060
Obelix.

929
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:23,300
The enemies' of our enemies are our friends

930
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:27,300
Lets take advantage.lets leave.
Off we go.

931
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,380
Come,come.

932
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,700
Alert, alerts.
The Romans attack.

933
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:38,060
Punch them well or they will come more.

934
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,780
Go we go, we already arrive. We go.

935
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,860
Obelix? But if it is Obelix!

936
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,700
Undoubtedly its me.
Don't you recognize me?

937
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,220
Why the hell you disguised as a Roman?

938
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,380
Enough already.

939
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:03,860
who is that?

940
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,860
A prisoner of the Romans that we liberated.

941
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:09,780
Yes.
Esautomatix removes his mask.

942
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,780
Not this way, be careful.

943
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,540
What are you waiting for?

944
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:24,140
Go, remove his mask,
by Tutatis. It is an order.

945
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,380
As u like.

946
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,860
Its Julius, Julius, Julius Caesar!

947
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:39,700
We have captured Julius Caesar.
I have captured Julius Caesar.

948
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,860
How?... Ah!
We have captured Julius Caesar.

949
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:46,300
The situation is more serious
give what you think.

950
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:51,860
Obelix, Asterix, Abraracourcix, and you, Julius
Caesar, I wanna speak to you.

951
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,860
Before that i want to change myself,
I am tired of being a Roman.

952
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:00,420
The troops of Detritus, they will attack us
any moment now.

953
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:02,860
And they are more a thousand times
larger that us.

954
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,300
Only a thousand times?
We have the magic potion.

955
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,620
We only have left little in the pot.

956
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:09,860
Now they also have it. - What?

957
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:13,100
Detritus forced me
to prepare them magic potion.

958
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:14,780
But he only have a small pot.

959
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,860
With their numeric superiority, if they used the
potion,

960
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,900
Would be enough to decant
the scale to their favor.

961
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:23,460
And then, our town

962
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:26,380
Would be erased from the map
forever.

963
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:31,300
And will be Caesar murdered by Detritus. What do you say,
Caesar?

964
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,620
What you say is correct, druid.

965
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,780
But, I have a proposition to make to you.

966
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,300
If you help me to recover my power,

967
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:41,620
You will be exempt from giving taxes.

968
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:46,300
And you will be able to continue living outside of
the Roman law.

969
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,700
What do you say, boss?
Its very interesting.

970
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:52,220
But maybe better if Petibónum becomes foreign
trade zone.

971
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:55,300
with the possibility give not to supervise
our companies.

972
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,780
Believe that you exaggerate, Gaul.

973
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,460
This is the time to make business?

974
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:02,980
Does some possibility give to conquer?
yes. A minimal possibility.

975
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,060
Ah! Which? Talk druida.

976
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,220
I can make my potion
more potent

977
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,860
If I can add unicorn's milk of 2 heads.

978
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,860
Of 2 heads? That animal was long gone before i was born.

979
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:15,500
Mathusalix still has a little flask.

980
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:19,460
Mathusalix? And where is he? We have not seen to
the crazy old one for years.

981
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:20,540
True.

982
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:24,060
How can you call my great-grandfather crazy if he's
one that taught me everything?

983
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:27,340
The Romans attack, boss. Boss, the Romans attack.

984
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,460
From where? from where?

985
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,340
From the behind door.

986
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:34,540
Its a trick. In fact they will attack from front.

987
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:38,620
How do you know that?
I invented that strategy.

988
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,700
Attacks!

989
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:03,140
It is necessary to find Mathusalix.
Follow me.

990
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:05,700
Come!
Yes, I go.

991
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,860
Mathusalix, where are you?
We need you.

992
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:12,100
Deaf already.
How old will he be?

993
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:15,060
About 200. He like to hide, he loves it.

994
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,620
Continue being a joker.

995
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:20,860
Mathusalix!

996
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,100
what is this?

997
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:29,700
Its the end of his beard. Lets follow it.

998
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,820
Did you discover it alone?
Yes.

999
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:34,740
Lets go.

1000
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,060
Give me, give me, give me.
With softness, gently.

1001
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,340
With softness, Obelix.
Yes, gently, yes.

1002
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:54,700
Caught ya.

1003
01:21:58,820 --> 01:21:59,700
Is it him?

1004
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:04,700
Mathusalix, it excuses for the nuisance but this is a
serious matter.

1005
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:06,900
I need milk of unicorn with 2
heads.

1006
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:09,180
The survival of the town depends on it.

1007
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:12,820
I have waited this moment
for a lot of time.

1008
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,300
I will not give it to you
so easily.

1009
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,100
What?

1010
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:22,300
I will give it to you if you can answer
my 2 questions.

1011
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:24,900
Are u joking?
The Romans are attacking us!

1012
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:27,940
Don't treats him with rudeness.
He is stubborn as a mule.

1013
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:31,060
And I notice it of you too:
You cannot make a mistake.

1014
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:34,500
Good. First question.

1015
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:39,260
A beggar had a brother; this brother is dead.

1016
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:43,540
But while he was alive the beggar didn't have any
brother. Why?

1017
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:46,180
Why?

1018
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,900
Seven! Six! Attention is only 5 drops left
water.

1019
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:11,060
Five! Four! Three!

1020
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:14,660
If you don't find the answer you can go and ask
her to the Romans.

1021
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,260
two!
The beggar is a woman.

1022
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,260
Valid answer.

1023
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:24,860
All to the barricades!

1024
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:47,300
Drink, drink the potion.
I will look for more.

1025
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,740
Attacks!
Boss, boss.

1026
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:57,740
What it happens?

1027
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,660
We are in disadvantage with the Gauls. Give us magic
potion.

1028
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:04,420
lmposible! It is reserved for my personal use.

1029
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:05,860
The troops are tired.

1030
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,340
The Gauls also and soon
they ran out of potion.

1031
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:10,620
Go, I saw you enough.

1032
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:13,300
And now, the second enigma.

1033
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:18,460
I do not have a brother neither sister, but that man's son

1034
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:21,660
he is my father's son.
Who is ?

1035
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,580
Twenty drops! Twenty drops!

1036
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,740
Slowly.
I should keep for Asterix.

1037
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:32,420
But, what the hell do they do?
What the hell do they do?

1038
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:51,260
I Am going to charge myself!
I am going to charge myself!

1039
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,260
Foward!
Foward!

1040
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,100
Five!

1041
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:03,100
Believe, I believe that I already know it.

1042
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,100
Four!

1043
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:06,100
Say it once and for all.
I am not sure.

1044
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:07,140
Its the same, right now.

1045
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:10,740
And u have another correct answer?
Doesn't matter, I tell you. Say it!

1046
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:13,580
One!
Its, he is my father.

1047
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:17,900
I already forgot the question. - Do you make fun
of us?

1048
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:21,060
No, but at my age I have error of memory.
Its normal, right?

1049
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:22,860
Clear.
I strangle to this unfortunate one.

1050
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:27,340
Ask : I do not have brother neither sister but the son of

1051
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,780
That man is my father's son. Who is ?

1052
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:32,180
The answer is:
My father.

1053
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:34,780
Valid answer.

1054
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:36,620
Reason?
Explaination.

1055
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:37,900
If he says it.

1056
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,980
As it was the first thing that happened to me.

1057
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:43,100
Because it is the correct answer.
but I said it without stopping to think.

1058
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,100
The first thing that I thought.
Shut up once and for all.

1059
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:48,900
We need the vial! Oh, great druid!

1060
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:00,140
The vial!

1061
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,060
The vial!

1062
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,620
Brave, Idefix!
Well done, my dog.

1063
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:11,500
Brave, dog, brave!
My dog! My dog!

1064
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:21,540
Stop, unfortunate.
For Tutatis.

1065
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:23,620
There are still left!

1066
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:35,060
Already. Drink, quick. - Obelix also?

1067
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:38,740
Yes, yes. This milk changes the nature
of the magic potion.

1068
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:40,820
The effect may vary. You will already
see.

1069
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:45,860
Very good, very good.
Their aftertaste is very pleasant.

1070
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:54,700
Truth what am I able to do?
I already told it to you. Quickly.

1071
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:00,700
What will i notice?
Wait a bit, and you will see.

1072
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,820
Pequeñines, come, come.

1073
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:00,580
Foward!

1074
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:05,340
Attacks. Let us go!

1075
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,260
Attacks!

1076
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,580
Return to battle!

1077
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,180
Other more.

1078
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:34,580
There go.

1079
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:46,740
Cowardly panda! Cochineals! Miserable!

1080
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:58,100
At one o'clock... At two o'clock...

1081
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:05,180
Now you will see, silly poor persons.
Ja! Must i do everything.

1082
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:12,300
Coarse.

1083
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,900
You Did It very well.
-the same to you

1084
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:34,060
Caesar!

1085
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,340
Ave, Caesar.
Ave Caesar!

1086
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:39,100
Legionaries.

1087
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,540
The Gauls from this village they are from now on
is our friends.

1088
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:44,460
and our allies.

1089
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:47,340
They pulled me from the treacherous claws of Detritus's.

1090
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,180
Without them, i would be dead.

1091
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:58,060
Your time has come, Detritus.
Pity, noble Caesar, pity.

1092
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,740
I don't knows what it happened me.
I wasn't myself.

1093
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:04,140
I lost my head.
you do not know it well.

1094
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,420
A moment, a moment,
a moment, please.

1095
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:13,900
Don't do it, Caesar. Good,
I have played, and I have lost.

1096
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:16,500
Now punish me,
nothing more to be spoken.

1097
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:18,580
You are worthless.
Thank you.

1098
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:21,100
Exactly, do you reflect, hey?

1099
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:24,260
Always, always, there has to be somebody
worthless

1100
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,700
Near the power, no?

1101
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:27,420
That's not true at all.
silence, Gauls.

1102
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:29,980
Shut Up you.
-that avoids getting dirty hands.

1103
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:32,820
I know how to make of everything, Caesar,
of everything.

1104
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:36,300
Spying, denouncing, betraying my friends.

1105
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,900
All are it that more I like it. And the false
testimonies, also.

1106
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:41,300
Everything!
You disgust me.

1107
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:44,220
You know me very well.
I disgust him, you already heard it.

1108
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:47,740
Then Caesar,
I won't disappoint you.

1109
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:49,940
Danger, Caesar...

1110
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:54,860
Danger from those traitors that are around to
you.

1111
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:57,060
and that you believe to be faithful and devote.

1112
01:30:57,620 --> 01:31:00,580
Who do you speak?
I Talk of...

1113
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:04,180
Can't tell it to you in public.

1114
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,260
Its unpleasant, Caesar.

1115
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:07,540
Caesar.

1116
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:12,300
If you are interested, I'll prepare you
a list and then can we comment on it.

1117
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:15,100
Take It.
thanks.

1118
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,740
come, I will make you a list
that you will be surprised.

1119
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:21,300
Many awaits the moment
to give you a stab

1120
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,900
in the back. They are friends, neighbors, even
relatives.

1121
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:27,740
Do you understand? Relatives. Come, Caesar!

1122
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:42,780
Falbala.

1123
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:47,180
You are the tenth Obelix
that I kiss tonight.

1124
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:50,700
Yes, but I am the true Obelix. True!

1125
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:53,260
The other ones were not more
than imitations.

1126
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:59,300
Falbala, I have to speak to you. I have to tell
you something.

1127
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,820
Shoot, I listening.

1128
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:05,820
Will you marry me? - Hey? Do you speak
seriously?

1129
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:07,820
Yes. Why?

1130
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:13,420
Obelix, I love you a lot,
as to a great brother.

1131
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:16,580
Like to a friend,
My great teddy Obelix.

1132
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:22,860
But I love Tragicomix.
We'll marry next month.

1133
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:27,100
Ah, yes? But if me...
Prolix told me that you...

1134
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:29,260
Prolix is only a cheater.

1135
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:35,540
Don't be sad. I can't see you sad, Obelix.

1136
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,100
Falbala.

1137
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:44,460
I should leave. Are you mad? You will always be my
friend?

1138
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:48,060
My great teddy Obelix.
Do you promise it to me?

1139
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:51,820
Do promise it to me?

1140
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:55,140
That you promise it to me.
Yes.

1141
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:16,900
Panoramix, can you give me more magic potion,
please?

1142
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:20,260
Are you joking? there' more than enough Obelix outside?

1143
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:21,460
Its not for me.

1144
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:33,220
Falbala, I can speak
with you 2 seconds more?

1145
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:35,660
What do you want from her?
No worries.

1146
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:39,060
I'll return it to you at once. We go, they come with
me. They come.

1147
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:52,540
Falbala, drink this.
What is it?

1148
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:55,420
It will not harm you. I also drank.

1149
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:58,380
Come on drinks, please.
Give me that pleasure.

1150
01:33:58,580 --> 01:33:59,620
Is it ok?

1151
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:05,820
Not bad.

1152
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:09,300
But...
What?

1153
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:22,940
Good, now you can go
to look for your Tragicomix.

1154
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:24,860
Do you want to stay with me?

1155
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:28,780
Believe that I have more than enough. I leave you.

1156
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:31,420
Falbala.

1157
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:39,900
To your health, Romans.
to your health, Asterix.

1158
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:51,100
Have you seen?

1159
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,700
Solo; Already tired of looking repeated.

1160
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:09,780
Me also.

1161
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:12,940
Imagine all the boars
to feed them to all.

1162
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:25,300
Obelix, Obelix, Obelix!

1163
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:27,740
Obelix has disappeared.

1164
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:30,660
will say the double he/she gives Obelix.

1165
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:33,380
No, no, all. I looked for him everywhere
and nowhere to be found

1166
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:35,820
You Have Killed my friend.
calm down.

1167
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:39,300
The true Obelix will be somewhere as you are
here.

1168
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:42,140
A the best thing also disappears. -No.

1169
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:45,260
How do you know it? Had you already used the milk
unicorn ?

1170
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:49,340
Me no, but Mathusalix
always used it.

1171
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:51,860
And if there has been danger, he would have warned
me.

1172
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:54,860
Warned!
That yokel is a perverse one.

1173
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:58,860
I will not allows you to speak
like that of my great-grandfather.

1174
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:02,700
He has taught me everything... Whats wrong with you?

1175
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:06,820
I feel strange. I sit down as if, i was
empty.

1176
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:09,260
I will also become
in soap bubbles.

1177
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:16,740
Right now, I have itches in the legs and in the ankles.

1178
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:20,500
If the one that tickles me is Idefix.

1179
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:23,900
But what do you want, my dog? What going on?
Where do you take me?

1180
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:27,340
In my place to himself would you take the opportunity of the situation.

1181
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:29,580
You no?
No, me no. No.

1182
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:35,260
Not that i dont want... I just want you to
kiss me without desire.

1183
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:39,340
In the mouth?

1184
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,180
Falbala!

1185
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:53,900
Obelix, Obelix.
Falbala.

1186
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,740
Are you the true one.
Falbala.

1187
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:59,300
Of Course it's me, why?

1188
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,500
Because the other ones, Obelix,
They all have disappeared.

1189
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:04,340
And the other ones, Asterix, also.
Yes, like Falbala.

1190
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:07,740
Yes, as Falbala.
That is to have bad luck.

1191
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:10,740
On everything for... Yes.
for Falbala.

1192
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:13,740
Go. They say that the wrong gives loves it doesn't
last a lifetime.

1193
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:17,100
With the time leave good memories. And you have
me.

1194
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,540
Yes, less than bad
I have you. Less bad.

1195
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:20,540
Less bad.

1196
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:35,300
Already go. Wait for me!

1197
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,460
My Caius Bonus.
No, no, no, finished.

1198
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,580
Its the last time,
only a last time.

1199
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:44,220
Greet the Egyptian!
you have gone away to Caius Bonus.

1200
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:47,740
Everyone has left
without fighting for the last time.

1201
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:58,860
Obelix comes, don't put that face. It is the
victory, we have won.

1202
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:02,620
Yes, but I have lost everything.

1203
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:03,780
My friends:

1204
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:06,900
this afternoon we celebrate two important events.

1205
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,260
Our victory
on the Romans.

1206
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:10,380
Well! Well done!

1207
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:13,900
And Obelix's anniversary.
Good!You fell down within the magical potion

1208
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:17,820
When you are a baby.

1209
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:19,100
Obelix!

1210
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:22,220
In the friendship, the banquets, the Romans, the
cakes.

1211
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:23,380
Obelix!

1212
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:26,580
Famous you are for
making menhirs.

1213
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:27,740
Obelix!

1214
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:31,260
Will never become bigger
if the love blushes.

1215
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:37,860
And now, the cake.

1216
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:54,300
They are yours. Caesar has participated.

1217
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:06,420
Come, Obelix.

1218
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:28,260
You. Yes, you, you, you.

1219
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:37,900
You, you, you, you, you.

1220
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:40,460
Here.
No.

1221
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:42,580
Right here.
No.

1222
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:44,500
Yes!

1223
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:08,340
Always the hard hitter. You destroy the cake in one go

1224
01:40:08,540 --> 01:40:10,700
I always tell it to him.
Hes is a glutton.

1225
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,180
Obelix, Obelix.

1226
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:18,740
Obelix, Obelix.

1227
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:25,060
I want to sing. I want to sing.
