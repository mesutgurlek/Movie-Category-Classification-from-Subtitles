You can't just
throw me into this.

Good to see you, sir.

585
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:34,934
Welcome aboard.
Thank you.

586
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,029
The name's Dave.
Hi, Dave.

587
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:37,165
We may hit a few
bumps up there,

588
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:38,469
nothing too crazy.
We'll get you there.

589
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:39,565
Okay, cool!
All right.

590
00:26:39,678 --> 00:26:41,612
Hope you enjoy
Chinese food.
I love it!

591
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:43,613
Very good.
Enjoy your flight.
Thank you.

592
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:45,449
Wow!

593
00:26:50,588 --> 00:26:52,715
You guys were a little late,
so we had to put up
James Taylor first.

594
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:55,759
<i>Karen, she's a silver sun</i>

595
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,421
<i>You'd best walk her way</i>
<i>and watch it shine</i>

596
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:03,964
<i>Watch her watch</i>
<i>the morning come</i>

597
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:13,204
<i>A silver tear appearing now</i>
<i>that I'm cryin', ain't I

598
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:18,115
<i>I'm going to Carolina</i>
<i>in my mind</i>

599
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:19,410
How'd you guys get him?

600
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:20,643
Everybody's got
their price.

601
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:23,277
Last year, we had Roger Waters
doing <i>Dark Side of the Moon.</i>

602
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:26,950
<i>That love's</i>
<i>the finest thing around...</i>

603
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:30,061
Okay, I thought it could
be funny if you just go,

604
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:32,095
"Fuck Facebook in the face!"

605
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:34,825
All right.
Hey, you do five minutes
before I go up there.

606
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:38,900
What? No. No, I can't
follow <i>Fire and Rain.</i>
Are you kidding me, man?

607
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:41,199
I can't follow it, either.
That's why you're going
up there.

608
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:48,645
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

609
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,179
<i>Thank you, MySpace!</i>

610
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:58,755
<i>Fuck Facebook!</i>

611
00:27:58,857 --> 00:28:00,654
(ALL CHEERING LOUDLY)

612
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,291
I can't believe that.
He did the Facebook joke!

613
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:05,056
(LAUGHING) Yeah!
He did the Facebook...

614
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:07,188
I can't follow this, man.
I can't go on right now.

615
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:10,995
Give me this shit.
Get up there. Be a man.

616
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:14,799
<i>This is a pretty big room.</i>

617
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:18,331
<i>Lot of people here.</i>

618
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:23,055
<i>Let's have another</i>
<i>round of applause</i>
<i>for James Taylor, everybody.</i>

619
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,662
Yeah, do you
actually use MySpace?

620
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:36,743
No, no, no. I fuck girls, Tom.
I don't have time for that.

621
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:40,777
<i>I wonder if Tom and Craig</i>
<i>from Craigslist would ever get</i>
<i>in a fight with each other.</i>

622
00:28:40,882 --> 00:28:41,871
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

623
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:44,611
<i>Who would win that fight?</i>
<i>That's what I want to know.</i>

624
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,183
<i>Tom or Craig,</i>
<i>who's tougher?</i>

625
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:55,056
<i>Tom has more friends,</i>
<i>so that's probably good.</i>

626
00:28:55,163 --> 00:28:57,028
<i>Craig has weirder</i>
<i>friends, though.</i>

627
00:28:57,132 --> 00:28:58,599
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

628
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,534
<i>Craig has friends that</i>
<i>are willing to do a lot more</i>
<i>for cash. I will say that.</i>

629
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,899
Eh?

630
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:10,978
What the fuck
was that all about?

631
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,603
You did all the jokes
you wrote for me.

632
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:15,012
Oh, man, I know.
I'm sorry. I panicked.
It's all they wanted.

633
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:16,515
They just wanted
MySpace jokes.
They didn't want...

634
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:17,846
That's why I hired you
to write me MySpace jokes.

635
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,214
I know, I'm sorry.
That one,
I didn't tell that one.

636
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,309
That one will work.

637
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:21,388
I guarantee you.

638
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:23,457
It better work.
They're paying me
300 grand.

639
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:25,321
<i>TOM: Mr. George Simmons!</i>
Really?

640
00:29:29,631 --> 00:29:33,692
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
<i>All right, Tom, thank you.</i>

641
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:37,397
<i>Good evening, nerds! Yes!</i>

642
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:40,872
<i>What about Ira, everybody?</i>
<i>How'd you feel</i>
<i>about Ira Wright? Yeah.</i>

643
00:29:40,975 --> 00:29:42,670

<i>He is such a fucking nerd,</i>
<i>I can't believe he doesn't</i>
<i>work with you people.</i>

645
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:51,080
<i>Tom started MySpace</i>
<i>just to get friends,</i>
<i>I know it.</i>

646
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:53,844
<i>So, they say the more friends</i>
<i>you have on MySpace,</i>

647
00:29:53,955 --> 00:29:57,857
<i>the less friends</i>
<i>you have in real life.</i>

Come here.
It came furnished.

729
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:39,017
Really?

(GEORGE MOANING)

731
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:43,428
GEORGE: That's my man, Ira.
He wrote a lot of good
jokes for me there, honey.

732
00:33:43,534 --> 00:33:46,332
Make sure he shows
you his cock.
It's very, very thick.

733
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:47,426
(BOTH LAUGHING)

00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:49,005
See you, George.

735
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:57,203
Hey, wanna have a contest
to see who can hold
their breath the longest?

You didn't go under.

739
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,962
Nothing's gonna
happen between us.

740
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:20,932
I can't believe
I'm having sex
with George Simmons.

741
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:23,469
Yeah, he can't
believe it, either.

742
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:26,207
My dad loves
your movies.

743
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,939
Yeah, that's the best
when you talk
about your dad.

I know that asshole.

751
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:00,774
You two were
just fucking, huh?
How'd that go?

752
00:35:00,878 --> 00:35:04,143
No, I have a boyfriend.
We already talked about it.

753
00:35:04,448 --> 00:35:06,006
Yeah. John.
Yeah.

754
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,110
Your friend took off.
She thought you left, so...

755
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:10,186
Really?

756
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,515
That's what happens
in a big house.

It's called
"the big house
problem."

Your friend actually
left her purse
down the hall.

759
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:17,159
You want to go
get it with me?

Sorry about
the chick, man. I...

00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:46,287
You weren't getting it done,
so something had to happen.

Oh, that's... No, she...
I wasn't even trying.

She told me
she had a boyfriend.

Oh, yeah. She told me
she had a boyfriend, too.

00:36:00,737 --> 00:36:02,728
What the fuck are you doing
with that big dick of yours?

777
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,003
You gotta use it!
You gotta share
Thickie with the world.

778
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:07,770
I don't... It's normal.

779
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:11,211
You want to go upstairs, man?
Talk to me while
I try to fall asleep?

780
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:14,617
Okay, if...
Yeah, if that's
what you want me to do.

781
00:36:15,686 --> 00:36:19,986
Yeah, yeah.
Sit down, man.
That was a fun night.

782
00:36:20,557 --> 00:36:21,546
That was a good night.

783
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:22,625
Yeah, that was crazy.

00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:23,693
Yeah.

785
00:36:23,794 --> 00:36:26,558
So, you slept with
both those girls, man.

786
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:28,657
How did you do that?

787
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,861
How did I do that?
There's this...

788
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:34,927
Girls like famous guys.
It's a story for them,
I guess. I don't know.

789
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:36,733
I take advantage
of it, though.

790
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,933
Believe me, they always
leave disappointed.

791
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:41,477
(YAWNING)
That's amazing.

792
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,442
Yeah, yeah, so let me hear
about this name, Ira Wright.

793
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,415
That's not your
real name, right?

794
00:36:49,086 --> 00:36:50,212
How could you tell?

795
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,344
(CHUCKLES)

796
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:53,480
You're hiding some Judaism.

797
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,455
No, my real
last name is Wiener.

798
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,288
It's Ira Wiener
and everyone...

799
00:36:57,394 --> 00:37:01,330
It's spelled the same
as "wiener" and I just got
tired of correcting people.

800
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:03,729
So, that's what led you
to the path of comedy.

801
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:06,894
Being humiliated every day.
First day of school,

802
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:08,995
(IN FEMALE VOICE)
"Is Ira Wiener here?"

803
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:10,073
And you were in the back.

804
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:13,734
(IN KID'S VOICE)
"Wiener. My name's Wiener."

805
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:16,244
You little fruit.
What were your parents like?

806
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:19,315
What are the older
"Wieners" or Wieners like?

807
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:21,341
My parents are divorced.

808
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:26,286
They hate each other.
My mother thinks
my father's the devil.

809
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:29,785
I don't know
what that makes me,
technically, but...

810
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:32,320
So, you'll never
be as funny as me.

811
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:33,418
Why not?

812
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,522
Your generation
has the divorces,
which is cute-funny,

813
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:42,196
but my generation has the,
"Oh, my God, my father's
about to hit me with a bat!"

814
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:48,811
I just... You gotta break out
the funny a lot quicker than
your little faggy childhood.

815
00:37:48,912 --> 00:37:50,140
(YAWNING)

816
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,371
Are you serious?

817
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:55,883
I spent my whole
childhood trying
to make my father laugh.

818
00:37:56,553 --> 00:37:59,386
I still haven't succeeded,
but we'll get there.

819
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:08,728
Don't bail on me yet.
Keep it coming.

820
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,491
When's the first time
you fingered a girl?

821
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:14,866
I was at summer camp,
Jewish summer camp,
on the sports field.

822
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:22,374
And her name
was Sharon Mizrahi.

823
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:26,377
I didn't know what to do.
I got really scared.

824
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:30,214
She reached down
and grabbed my penis
really hard,

825
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,151
like she was just
trying to murder it.

826
00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:43,797
Morning.
Yeah, baby.

827
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,767
It took me three hours,
but I think
I found your kitchen.

828
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,067
Am I in the
bathroom still?
Is that it?

829
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:51,538
No, no.
You're good.
You're safe.

830
00:38:51,675 --> 00:38:52,642
What do you
got there?

831
00:38:52,743 --> 00:38:54,904
This is medicine, Ira.
I'm sick.

832
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:57,674
One of those girls
have chlamydia?
I thought she smelled funny.

833
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:59,408
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

834
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:04,978
I have a weird blood disease.
AML. It's a form of leukemia.

835
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:08,418
This is experimental
medicine from Canada.

836
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:14,119
There's an 8% chance
of it working. So, fuck me.

837
00:39:14,564 --> 00:39:16,930
Well, that's not true
'cause if it was,

838
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:18,661
I would've read about it
or heard about that.

839
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:19,861
You didn't hear
about it because

840
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,962
I didn't fucking
run out and tell
<i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

841
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:24,904
Well, why would
you tell me?

842
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:26,805
'Cause I don't
really know you, Ira.

843
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,038
I think you're not gonna
get too weird about this.

844
00:39:30,147 --> 00:39:33,480
I don't want to start
getting treated like
the guy who's gonna die.

845
00:39:33,784 --> 00:39:37,880
So, anyways, this shit's
got a lot of caffeine in it.

846
00:39:37,988 --> 00:39:40,923
They say that's good for you.
Let me take the medicine.

847
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:42,548
Why are you telling
me this, George?

848
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:45,492
'Cause I want you
to possibly do me a favor.

849
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:46,789
Okay. Yeah. What?

850
00:39:47,597 --> 00:39:48,689
Kill me.

851
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:50,433
What?

852
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:51,660
Nobody knows
we know each other.

853
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:54,328
You're a stranger.
You can get away with this.

854
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:57,566
I got a gun
in the other room.
It's untraceable.

855
00:39:57,674 --> 00:40:00,666
I'll give you $50,000.

856
00:40:00,777 --> 00:40:06,807
Don't make me suffer.
Please, kill me, Ira.
I'm begging you.

857
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:09,108
Can you at least
give me, like, a night
to think about it?

858
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:10,345
Ha!

859
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:12,445
Think about it?
You would do it!

860
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:15,218
Oh, I hate you, man.
Oh, no!

861
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:20,991
Ira, I misread you.
You're sick!
You're a murderer!

862
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:22,087
Screw you, man.

863
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,188
You wanted to do it!

864
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,791
What would you have
done for $100,000?
Chop my head off?

865
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:27,369
You would still
want to do it!

866
00:40:27,471 --> 00:40:29,200
That wasn't even
good acting over there!

867
00:40:29,306 --> 00:40:30,603
What the fuck?
That was good acting.

868
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:32,698
Daniel Day-Lewis would've
crushed that speech.

869
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:35,403
I bought that, man. Wow!

870
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:38,743
Ira, you don't have
to kill me,
but I am gonna die.

871
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:40,980
George, look.
Honestly, I'm like...
Don't get close, Ira.

872
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:42,574
...a really gullible guy.
Don't do this.

873
00:40:42,686 --> 00:40:44,017
Look, my friends,
they trick me
all the time.

874
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:45,782
One of my roommates told me
he was Joe Pesci's son.

875
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:48,380
I believed him
for three years.
I still get shit for it,

876
00:40:48,492 --> 00:40:50,426
so just, please,
level with me, man.

877
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:52,825
Are you serious?
I am serious, Ira.

he's taking medicine.

He likes me, in a weird...

I think he's, like,

It's all I'm thinking about.

906

I'm gonna tell you
this story that makes me
feel all right with death.

907
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:03,661
When I was younger,
my grandfather died

908
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:05,325
and we were all
gathered around him

909
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:08,632
and there was
this one candle
next to his bed.

910
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:13,937
And right after he died,
the candle started flickering
and then it just went out.

911
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:15,435
Wow.
Yeah.

912
00:42:15,545 --> 00:42:18,309
And we looked around,
and there were no windows.

913
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:21,407
Like, nothing
in that room.

914
00:42:22,152 --> 00:42:24,677
And it sounds crazy,
but we all thought

915
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:27,120
it was him going
to heaven, you know?

916
00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:29,454
You don't pass through
fire to get to heaven.

917
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:30,526
I think he went to hell.

LEO: I just...

920
00:42:33,396 --> 00:42:35,091
I think your grandfather
probably went to hell.

921

Don't do it.
Are you kidding
me right now?

to you guys like that?

925

It's not my fault
your grandfather's
in hell.

926

1032
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,542
I have a thing
about how, like,
you're rich, you know,

1033
00:46:51,654 --> 00:46:52,780
and so you bought
a private jet,

1034
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:54,048
but you're
afraid of flying,

1035
00:46:54,156 --> 00:46:55,123

drive in it.

I'll come up with the ending,
but that was good.

1039
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:05,792
I thought it could
be funny about your balls,
you know, about how, like,

1040
00:47:05,901 --> 00:47:09,337
you're getting older
and you found the first
gray hair on your balls.

1041
00:47:09,438 --> 00:47:11,668
And it really worried you,
but then you realized
it was good

1042
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:14,140
'cause it made
your balls look
distinguished and smart.

1043
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:17,701
Like, if you gave your balls
a little tweed jacket with
elbow pads and a little pipe,

1044
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:21,943
your balls could be like
a character Kevin Kline
would play in a movie.

Well, your immune system
is in the middle of
a very serious battle.

1235

The medicine is trying
to combat the disease,

00:57:36,397 --> 00:57:38,797
but in the process
it destroys healthy tissue

1237
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,198
and disrupts healthy
functioning of your organs

1238
00:57:41,302 --> 00:57:43,770
and multiple
lymphatic systems,

1239
00:57:43,871 --> 00:57:45,998
so you're getting
attacked on two levels.

And we hope the disease
is vanquished

does damage
which cannot be contained.

01:01:02,837 --> 01:01:04,498
And he's not even
that famous!

1309
01:01:04,605 --> 01:01:07,768
What if like a real
good-looking celebrity
was my roommate?

1310
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:11,834
What if I lived with,
you know, James McAvoy
or Jude Law or something?

1311
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,678
I don't know.
I probably would fuck
both of those people.

1312
01:01:14,782 --> 01:01:15,749
Don't say that.

1313
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:17,442
I'm sorry!

a little bit.

1314
01:01:17,718 --> 01:01:19,242
I can't believe that!

1316
01:01:20,955 --> 01:01:26,188
If a hot girl walked over
here, naked, and was like,
"Do my body," you would.

1317
01:01:26,327 --> 01:01:27,692
You would have
sex with her.

1318
01:01:27,795 --> 01:01:30,161
No, I'd feel
really uncomfortable.

1319
01:01:30,298 --> 01:01:32,596
And then I might ask
her to a Wilco show.

1320
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:37,069
Okay, then you're the first
guy in the world that I've
ever met that's like that.

1321
01:01:37,572 --> 01:01:40,132
I thought you were
the kind of girl
that would wait two months

1322
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:41,265
and then have
sex with a guy.

1323
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:42,342
I didn't think
you would just...

1324
01:01:42,443 --> 01:01:44,502
I'm an independent woman.

1325
01:01:44,612 --> 01:01:47,080
I'm allowed
to fuck people.

1326
01:01:47,381 --> 01:01:50,443
Well, if I had known that,
I would have scheduled
our date a lot sooner!

1327
01:01:52,153 --> 01:01:54,587
Give me a break.
I don't even know you.

1328
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:57,724
This is the longest
conversation
we've ever had.

1329
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:08,467
Don't be mad at me.
I said I'd give
you 10 days.

1330
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:10,059
I gave you three weeks.

1331
01:02:13,474 --> 01:02:14,702
I thought you
were joking, man.

1332
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:17,277
I'm gonna be
honest with you.

1333
01:02:17,378 --> 01:02:20,176
We... We... We want to fuck
every girl that we meet.

1334
01:02:21,549 --> 01:02:22,516
That's how it works.

1335
01:02:22,617 --> 01:02:25,643
If I didn't sleep with
every girl you wished
you could sleep with,

1336
01:02:25,753 --> 01:02:27,345
I wouldn't sleep
with anybody.

1337
01:02:27,455 --> 01:02:29,980
It's a communication
breakdown.
We can fix this.

1338
01:02:30,524 --> 01:02:32,321
I don't care.
The fact that you
had sex with her...

1339
01:02:32,426 --> 01:02:36,760
I can never do anything
like that with her.

1340
01:02:36,864 --> 01:02:41,164
So, you're really not
gonna chase this girl
just because I was with her?

1341
01:02:41,268 --> 01:02:42,326
Yeah.

1342
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:44,128
Huh.

1343
01:02:45,006 --> 01:02:47,133
It's kind of insulting,
on some level.

1344
01:02:49,977 --> 01:02:52,309
Wanna go to Wilco with me?

I wish I could,
but I'm going
with Tobey Maguire.

I got a few good offers,

but honestly, I don't
know how much each car
is worth and I...

1352
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:20,404
They keep on wanting
to buy all of them

1353

and it's hard for me to...
Don't make it a big deal.

1354
01:03:22,009 --> 01:03:24,842
Don't get
a stomach-ache over it.
Just sell them.

Give it to a charity.
Move on.

Okay.

I just want to be
happy about

away, you know.

There's something
I've really been wanting
to tell you, George.

1362
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:37,282
Uh-oh.

1363
01:03:38,092 --> 01:03:39,320
Yeah.

1364
01:03:39,427 --> 01:03:43,921
I feel as though you need
to tell someone other than me
about your condition.

1365
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,066
I don't want to do that.

George,
people care about you.

1367
01:03:48,703 --> 01:03:50,671
You have to let them
be there for you.

1368
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:55,439
I tell somebody,
then it's all gonna change,
and you can't get it back.

1369
01:03:56,243 --> 01:03:58,074
Everything's
already changed, George,

1370

and the truth is
soon you're gonna
start getting very sick

and you are gonna want
someone other than me there.

1372

Have you even told
your parents yet?

to tell your friends.

have any friends.

I shoot the shit with

I don't remember

01:15:03,176 --> 01:15:04,643
No, I'm not
sleeping with Daisy!

1605
01:15:04,778 --> 01:15:08,009
I have a new girlfriend now.
I'm dating the girl
who plays Mrs. Pruitt.

1606
01:15:08,115 --> 01:15:09,104
Her name's
Carla something.

1607
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:13,164
Can I sit next to
George at dinner?

1608
01:15:13,269 --> 01:15:15,203
Sit wherever the hell
you want to sit, man, why?

1609
01:15:15,337 --> 01:15:18,329
I feel like if I can just
make George crack up once,

1610
01:15:18,741 --> 01:15:20,140
it'll do huge things
for me, like...

1611
01:15:20,242 --> 01:15:21,504
What, you wrote
jokes for Thanksgiving?

1612
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:22,736
I didn't write jokes.

1613
01:15:22,845 --> 01:15:24,574
I just wrote down
my funniest anecdotes

1614
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,874
and punched them up
here and there.

1615
01:15:26,382 --> 01:15:30,682
Okay,
I can't hide in the kitchen
all afternoon. I'm going.

1616
01:15:31,921 --> 01:15:33,684
My man. The Schmira.

1617
01:15:33,789 --> 01:15:35,222
Thanks for coming, man.

1618
01:15:35,324 --> 01:15:37,087
This is the best.
Where's your bedroom?

1619
01:15:37,459 --> 01:15:39,984
Well, get ready for a hike,
'cause you're standing in it.

1620
01:15:40,095 --> 01:15:41,995
No.
It's...
Yeah, it's pretty lame.

1621
01:15:42,097 --> 01:15:43,428
Did you go to
that Wilco show?

1622
01:15:43,532 --> 01:15:44,521
Yeah, did you?

1623
01:15:44,633 --> 01:15:47,500
(LAUGHS)
No, actually, I didn't.
I scalped the tickets.

1624
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:48,959
I made 100 bucks
profit, so...

1625
01:15:49,071 --> 01:15:50,060
Oh. So, you
owe me 50.

1626
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:56,086
Okay, I guess I do.
Rain check, okay?

1627
01:15:56,194 --> 01:15:57,161
Money order.

1628
01:15:57,329 --> 01:15:58,455
Money order?
That'll work.
Yeah.

1629
01:15:58,564 --> 01:16:00,361
PayPal? Are you on PayPal?
Yeah, PayPal it up.

1630
01:16:00,465 --> 01:16:03,025
Look at that,
back and forth,
like a cute couple.

1631
01:16:03,135 --> 01:16:05,535
You're like
Marc Anthony
and J. Lo.

1632
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:09,567
You know, we actually
had a date, but then
I had sex with that guy,

1633
01:16:09,675 --> 01:16:11,108
so Schmira broke it off.

1634
01:16:11,209 --> 01:16:12,198
GEORGE: You kidding me?

1635
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:15,474
Don't worry, Ira. You know
you're a better lover
than Pete Rose over there.

1636
01:16:15,581 --> 01:16:17,412
Look at him. He's got
the length and the width.

1637
01:16:17,516 --> 01:16:19,245
Imagine that dong of his.

1638
01:16:19,351 --> 01:16:21,512
I saw the tip of it one time.
Even that was too big for me.

1639
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,281
No, it's very normal.
Yeah.

1640
01:16:23,388 --> 01:16:24,616
So, you like big penises?

1641
01:16:24,723 --> 01:16:27,283
Well, you know,
I have a really
skinny vagina, so...

1642
01:16:27,392 --> 01:16:29,189
If it's skinny,
you should try
feeding it carbs.

1643
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:30,886
(LAUGHING)

1644
01:16:30,996 --> 01:16:32,588
Yeah.
All right, well,
jeez, you know what?

1645
01:16:32,698 --> 01:16:34,632
I'm gonna leave
you two alone, huh?

1646
01:16:34,733 --> 01:16:35,700
Yeah, okay.

1647
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:36,893
I'm falling in love
with the both of you.

1648
01:16:37,002 --> 01:16:38,230
Let the awkwardness begin!

1649
01:16:38,337 --> 01:16:39,326
MAN: Love your work.

1650
01:16:39,438 --> 01:16:42,271
GEORGE: Yeah? Thank you
for shopping at Ralphs.

1651
01:16:42,374 --> 01:16:45,400
I'm sorry.
I owe you an apology.
It's really weird what I did.

1652
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:49,503
I basically yelled at you for
cheating on me before we had
even had a real conversation.

1653
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:52,674
So, I'm aware of that.
I know that's weird,
and I'm sorry.

1654
01:16:52,784 --> 01:16:54,581
Well, it's not as weird
as getting drunk

1655
01:16:54,686 --> 01:16:57,382
and having sex with the guy
from <i>Yo Teach!</i> So...

1656
01:16:57,723 --> 01:17:00,886
It's okay.
When I first moved here,
I blew Mr. Belvedere.

1657
01:17:01,093 --> 01:17:02,856
(LAUGHS)
So, everyone does that.
