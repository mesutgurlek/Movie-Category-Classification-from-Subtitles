1
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:18,484
...between the second and fourth slots.
When you've done that

2
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:22,037
with one of these stickers,
it goes on the folder.

3
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:28,123
Each file folder needs to go into its own
Pendaflex folder, the aPProPriate one.

4
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:32,121
Why does it have to be
on the inside and outside folders?

5
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:35,962
The case number?
Because it's the key to the entire system.

6
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:40,725
lt also goes on the rePort, all Pages,
with a two-hole Punch.

7
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,403
Attach it on this two-Prong fastener.
That way nothing gets lost.

8
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:50,687
Misdemeanours go in here.
Felonies in there.

9
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:54,362
- Plenty of room there.
- Why do you think l'm leaving?

10
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:59,358
The case load number's also on the
daily sheet. Today, we have two.

11
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:04,317
Two calls. Both down at the Pier.

12
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:07,797
lf we drag our feet,
they can carry us through to lunch.

13
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:12,525
- HaPPy birthday, Katie.
- Thanks, Scott.

14
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:16,521
- Could you call me today on the radio?
- About what?

15
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:21,715
Make something uP. l think it's busted...
Police officer! Out of my way!

16
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,639
- Morning.
- Dave!

17
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:38,997
- Scott, l made muffins for you.
- You didn't have to, Mrs Remington.

18
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:43,957
God bless you in that awful city.
We're all hoPing you don't get shot.

19
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:47,886
Poor boy!

20
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:03,158
- What?
- Seatbelt! lt's the law.

21
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:05,921
Thank you.

22
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:14,884
Come on, l can't smell these
without having one.

23
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:18,039
- Make sure it's just one.
- Thank you.

24
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,323
- How many days do you have left?
- Three.

25
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:32,843
- Good.
- Am l getting on your nerves?

26
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:37,797
l aPPreciate you showing me the roPes,
letting me ride in your nice clean car.

27
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:41,039
- Treating me like a real detective.
- lnvestigator.

28
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,199
Whatever. But when will you
learn to relax?

29
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:49,002
- l am relaxed.
- l'm not talking about the small 'r'.

30
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:52,876
l'm talking about the big 'R'.
On toP of Old Smokey?

31
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:55,721
You mean get laid?

32
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:59,766
lt's already been four times this morning.
l'm exhausted!

33
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,125
Come on, boys, your mama will be mad.

34
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:25,843
- Mr Boyett.
- How you doing? l hear we're losing you.

35
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:30,398
- Yeah. David Sutton, he's rePlacing me.
- Mr Boyett.

36
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,240
- We came to tell you that...
- That they found your dinghy.

37
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:39,286
- You should send somebody to get it.
- l never thought l'd see it again.

38
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:43,281
Could you show the boys
your detective's badge?

39
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,725
- He's a detective?
- An investigator.

40
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:51,722
- l don't know, Dad. Looks fake to me.
- Kid, want to sPend some time in jail?

41
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:56,761
- Cute kids.
- Yeah, well...kids.

42
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:04,479
Amos?

43
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,366
- Who's there?
- lt's me! Scott!

44
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:18,363
- Let me get a leash on him.
- Do that, Please! Thank you.

45
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,926
Amen.

46
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:31,005
l brought you a muffin, boy!
Here's a muffin. Nice muffin, Hooch!

47
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:35,719
See the muffin?
Here's the muffin for Hooch!

48
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:39,118
l brought a muffin for you! A muffin!

49
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:41,960
A muffin, Hooch!

50
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:06,322
Let him go, Hooch! Let go of him!

51
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:07,886
DroP him!

52
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:16,400
l'm sorry, Scott. l don't have
the hand strength l used to.

53
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:19,799
- You're OK, aren't you?
- l'm fine.

54
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:23,562
l was looking forward to a quiet coffee,
but now l'm awake!

55
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:27,606
Don't let him see that you're angry.
He reacts real bad to anger.

56
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:31,476
- What is it with him? He knows me!
- What, know you?

57
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:36,562
He didn't even break the skin.
This dog loves you, boy!

58
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:41,357
Let's go to the house and have a cookie.
Come on, Hooch. Let's go.

59
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:50,238
Doc says l shouldn't give him chocolate.
What do you say, Hooch?

60
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,120
Thought so.

61
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:56,279
l'm here. What's the comPlaint this time?

62
00:09:56,447 --> 00:10:01,441
Them! That seafood Plant.
Something's going on over there.

63
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:05,964
- They're OK, other than a stolen dinghy.
- No, it's worse than it was.

64
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:11,155
There's always some strange noises
going on at night.

65
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:17,004
- But you said you don't hear so good.
- l don't hear it. Hooch does. He tells me.

66
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:24,843
Hooch tells you about it.
Well, you live in a Pretty industrial area.

67
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:28,323
lf you want quiet, move to an aPartment.

68
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:33,197
Me and Hooch in an aPartment?
That'd be a sight!

69
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,196
l thought you didn't mind coming here?

70
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:43,845
l don't mind. lt's just that
l'm leaving on Monday. Remember?

71
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:49,286
The guy who's rePlacing me, he won't
want to come and talk to you like l do.

72
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:54,840
Because...he's scared to death
of your dog... l can't figure out why.

73
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:08,402
Whoa! All right! That's good.

74
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:16,244
- Yeah, sit there and drool over yourself.
- l gave him whiskey once.

75
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:20,605
And he howled all night...
Now he sticks to beer.

76
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:26,435
- You want some?
- No, thank you. l'm not on his hours.

77
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:31,963
Well, l really have to get going.

78
00:11:34,847 --> 00:11:38,726
- Moving uP to the big city?
- Yeah.

79
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:44,765
- Maybe me and Hooch can come visit?
- You? Anytime.

80
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:50,083
Hooch?
Sacramento is the state caPital.

81
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:54,718
l think they have laws
against dogs like Hooch.

82
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:02,558
- lt's not that funny.
- l can't helP it.

83
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:07,847
Every time l think about it...
l nearly wet my Pants!

84
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:12,046
- So do l. That's why it's not funny.
- Delta One?

85
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:17,080
Turner can't come to the Phone.
He's got a dog on his throat.

86
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:21,604
- Say thank you and that we're clear.
- Thanks. We're clear.

87
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:27,763
lt's business. Some kids found money
on Pinecone Beach. $8,000 so far!

88
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:30,398
- All right.
- We're on it!

89
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:40,997
Mrs HarPer?

90
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:45,243
First l thought it was Play money.

91
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:49,799
As it was real, l had them
show me where they found it.

92
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:53,755
- Will more money wash uP here?
- l wouldn't count on it.

93
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:58,955
Here's how this works. lf no one claims
it or identifies it in 30 days, it's yours.

94
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:03,200
- l found it, it's mine. She can't have any.
- StoP!

95
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,400
l'm confiscating it. lf you get it,
you have to use it for college.

96
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:10,804
- See?
- You'll need to fill out some forms.

97
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,798
StoP that!

98
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:21,525
She wanted a church wedding.

99
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:25,885
Suddenly it's $2,000 for a wedding dress,
recePtion and bar for 400,

100
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:31,519
and l'll end uP Picking uP the tab
for the honeymoon to Bora Bora.

101
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:38,315
- Here he is. Want to talk to him?
- Yeah. Ferraday! l want to talk to you.

102
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:40,918
l'm talking to you!

103
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:52,998
What's the hurry?

104
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:20,564
Hooch, be quiet!

105
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:25,365
For Christ's sake!

106
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:31,558
You know, l feel like an ass.

107
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:36,847
l take you in, give you my trust. What do
you do? Take the food off my kid's Plate!

108
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:45,123
lt was there. l just lost my head.
lt won't haPPen again, Mr Boyett.

109
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,635
Quiet!

110
00:14:57,087 --> 00:15:01,603
Casey, get rid of him. Zack,
see if the old man saw. Deal with it.

111
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:24,684
- Hi there.
- You get out! Back off!

112
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:29,796
HoPe l didn't disturb you. l realise we
were making a racket. l saw your light.

113
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:33,039
Thought l'd come over
to see everything's OK.

114
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:36,244
Mind your own business.
This is Private ProPerty.

115
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:40,161
lf we disturbed you, l ought
to comPensate you a little.

116
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:44,115
- This is for any inconvenience...
- l don't want your money.

117
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:47,962
- l've seen what you're doing over there.
- Wait a minute.

118
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:51,676
- We're doing nothing wrong.
- Get off my dock!

119
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:56,921
- Don't you shove me! Understand?
- l'm going to introduce you to my dog.

120
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:11,926
Jesus!

121
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:07,963
Hello...? Yeah, l am now.

122
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:13,560
l'll be right there!

123
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:24,443
The dog was guarding the body.
They wrestled him inside.

124
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:27,565
- Talk to anybody?
- Nobody heard anything.

125
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:31,276
A seafood worker sPotted the body.

126
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:37,923
- Ever investigate a murder?
- l moved here to get away from them.

127
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:42,956
Everybody's watching,
so let's look like we've done this before.

128
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:17,004
All right. l've got five rolls of film.
Burn it uP.

129
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:26,322
lt's those jerks from the Sheriff's Office.

130
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:34,202
- Ladies, if we need helP, we'll call.
- Foster and McCabe, glad to see you.

131
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,439
l need coffee. You take sugar? Two.

132
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:43,045
That's cute. ln the sPirit of cooPeration,
get the hell out of here. ls that OK?

133
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:48,281
- The Pier is our jurisdiction.
- The county is the Sheriff's jurisdiction.

134
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,122
- lt's Police work, not a lost bicycle.
- Excuse me.

135
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:59,523
ls this a joke? Every little sPeck of dirt is
not evidence. What are you going to do?

136
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:03,441
Put the entire Pier in a baggie?
What is that for?

137
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:08,681
- To Preserve what's under his nails.
- What? He was stabbed in the back.

138
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:13,523
Never anticiPate what will be imPortant.
Gather it to analyse later.

139
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:18,602
- You read that in a book?
- Yeah, l did. A big blue book.

140
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:21,998
You'd like it. lt had a lot of Pictures!

141
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:26,160
We're all uPset. Why not cooPerate
and get our jobs done?

142
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:29,603
We'd like to examine the body.
Before it rots.

143
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:36,999
- Give me a minute with my guys?
- No Problem.

144
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:42,038
We have to turn this over
to the Sheriff's DePartment.

145
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,199
Why? They couldn't
find shoes in a shoebox!

146
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,518
You're leaving town,
David's inexPerienced...

147
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:53,886
Wait! l don't have to be in Sacramento
for a week. l'll cancel my vacation.

148
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:57,722
- We can do it. David's a good learner.
- Turner's a good teacher.

149
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:02,517
Why have investigators
just to investigate stolen mailboxes?

150
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:07,317
Howard! l've got Pay coming.
Let me earn it. We won't let you down.

151
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:10,479
We deserve a shot at it!

152
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:15,880
All right...
Do the best you can in the time.

153
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:25,443
We'll share the lab rePorts with you.
You can examine any evidence. Fair?

154
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:28,997
- No, not fair.
- Sounds fair to me.

155
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:42,283
- Are you going in there with just these?
- We do this for a living. Stay out of it.

156
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:49,406
Take this.

157
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:53,480
Make sure these are all 8x10
glossies.

158
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,403
- Coming out!
- Back off!

159
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:02,642
- Wait!
- l got you!

160
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:13,883
Easy!

161
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:24,557
Back him uP! Bad dog!

162
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:35,401
Good boy. Come on.
Over here. Whoa!

163
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,798
Slow down, boy!

164
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:48,000
This dog's nuts! We'll have to shoot him.

165
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:51,125
No. He's the best we have as a witness.

166
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:56,677
Yeah? You think you can handle him?
You're nuts!

167
00:21:56,847 --> 00:22:02,558
Where are you going?
He resPonds Poorly to anger, that's all.

168
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:06,438
- David!
- What?

169
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:09,360
Bring the car, as close as you can!

170
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:12,837
OPen the back doors,
leave the engine running.

171
00:22:14,527 --> 00:22:20,079
Hey, there, Hooch.
You saw the whole thing, didn't you?

172
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:25,799
Well, Amos is gone now.
So you don't have a lot of oPtions, OK?

173
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:30,404
Either you work with me
or they're going to shoot you.

174
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:32,606
l'm going to...

175
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:38,205
...try to make you
a little more comfortable.

176
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,676
Don't you want to think about it?

177
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:48,960
Here! Watch! How do you do this?

178
00:22:49,127 --> 00:22:52,961
Let me just make you more... Here...

179
00:22:54,487 --> 00:23:00,323
Think about it. Maybe we'll get
chocolate chiP cookies. A nice big box.

180
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:03,957
The soft kind with 22 chiPs! Cookie?

181
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:08,399
Think!

182
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:12,081
Hooch, get in the car!

183
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:15,606
Come on!

184
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:25,758
- Come on!
- Move back. He's in control.

185
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:27,360
Come on!

186
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:34,521
Are you tired? HoPe so.

187
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:39,565
lf you are, that's too bad. Now, look out!

188
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:46,837
Not too bad. Hold on. Wait a minute.

189
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:51,486
You're going in the clinic for a few days.
lt'll be good for you.

190
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:53,958
Come on!

191
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:57,677
Come on! Come on, Hooch!

192
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:05,120
Wait... Whoa, Hooch!
Hooch, no! StoP!

193
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:22,007
l'll kill you! No!

194
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:25,239
- What are you doing to him?
- Taking a walk!

195
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:28,444
He's bleeding! My God! For how long?

196
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:32,839
- Not long enough! You... l'll kill you!
- l have a front door!

197
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:36,397
- l'll shoot you, Hooch!
- You stay right there!

198
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,639
Fix him uP, so l can shoot him!

199
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:57,804
All right. All done. Stay!

200
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:04,243
- What's your dog's name?
- Hooch, but...

201
00:26:04,407 --> 00:26:07,956
He needed stitches.
When did he last see a vet?

202
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:12,837
- l don't know.
- That's borderline abuse. He's filthy!

203
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:15,567
His diet is terrible. lf you can't...

204
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:19,800
- He belonged to an old man.
- l want to sPeak to him.

205
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:23,562
You can't. He was murdered last night.

206
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:29,279
- l'm Scott Turner, a Police investigator...
- l know. We use the same bank.

207
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:33,884
- Emily Carson... lt's a small town.
- Nice to meet you.

208
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:38,165
Sorry about that.
l can't stand animals being mistreated.

209
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:41,364
- Can l ask you a question about him?
- Yes.

210
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:48,365
l think he witnessed the crime. He may
have to identify a susPect. Could he?

211
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:53,961
- Yes.
- Can l show him a Photo? A mugshot?

212
00:26:54,127 --> 00:26:57,324
- You don't know about dogs.
- l never had one.

213
00:26:57,487 --> 00:27:00,285
- Not even as a kid?
- No way.

214
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:06,121
Dogs don't see in two dimensions.
He'd recognise a scent, but not a Photo.

215
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:08,596
- OK.
- Come on!

216
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:13,795
- Doesn't he have to recouP?
- Well, no. He's a little tired, but he's OK.

217
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:18,438
- You're a good dog.
- You're good with animals.

218
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:22,566
Yeah. l'm a vet! You're buttering me uP.

219
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:28,643
l think he would be better off with you,
than with someone like me. l don't...

220
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:31,640
- Are you married?
- No.

221
00:27:31,807 --> 00:27:35,766
- You live alone? House or aPartment?
- House.

222
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:38,760
- You have a girlfriend?
- No.

223
00:27:38,927 --> 00:27:41,999
- Well, Perfect.
- Perfect for who?

224
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:45,000
- Perfect for Hooch.
- For... How?

225
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:49,285
He'll keeP you comPany and
take care of your house. You're lucky.

226
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:55,238
- l don't have room for a dog like him!
- Not many PeoPle do. l've got to work...

227
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,796
Goodbye!

228
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:38,041
What? What is it? What?

229
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:43,884
lf you're hungry, finish the hamburgers!
Eat the buns! You're not thirsty!

230
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:48,518
You won't touch the water, orange juice,
cranaPPle! What do l do?

231
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:51,838
Make you a margarita?

232
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:58,204
Shut uP! God! This has been going on
for two and a half hours!

233
00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,686
Quiet!

234
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:32,402
All right, you tell me what to do!
What am l suPPosed to do?

235
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:38,039
You tell me! What am l suPPosed
to do? Stand out on the Porch all night?

236
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,564
Give him a Valium. Take one yourself!

237
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:47,723
Hey, shut uP! l'm a Policeman!
Want your car towed?

238
00:29:55,847 --> 00:29:58,645
l hate you.

239
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:09,406
No!

240
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:13,196
You...stuPid dog!

241
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:20,957
You stuPid dog!

242
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:36,767
You want to tear my head off? Go on!
You'll be traPPed inside and starve again!

243
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:40,715
lf they don't find my body first
and shoot you! lt's my house!

244
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:45,563
Back off! l'm coming in!
Back off, Hooch!

245
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:49,797
Back off.

246
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:15,966
All right. lf we're going to get along,
we'll have to come to an understanding.

247
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:22,319
These are the rules.
No barking. No growling.

248
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:27,636
You will not lift your leg to anything
in here. This is not your room.

249
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:39,323
No slobbering. No chewing. You'll wear
a flea collar. This is not your room.

250
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:47,476
No begging food. No sniffing crotches.
You will not drink from my toilet.

251
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:50,605
This is not your room.

252
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:58,883
This is your room.
The rest of the house is mine.

253
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:03,643
When l come back,
l like to find everything where l Put it.

254
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:05,206
ln its Place.

255
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:09,883
Don't touch my stuff.
l certainly won't touch yours.

256
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:17,605
This is the room to do that!
This is your bed.

257
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:24,718
You follow these simPle rules, shut uP...

258
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:27,879
...we'll get along fine.

259
00:33:31,247 --> 00:33:34,842
- What does it tell you?
- l never read an autoPsy rePort.

260
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:39,364
- l don't want to again.
- lt's the key in a homicide investigation.

261
00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:44,043
- The killer Probably had combat training.
- Where's that?

262
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:49,759
"The weaPon Pierced between the third
and fourth rib, entering the right lung."

263
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:55,320
l read that. Stabbed from behind
on the right. The killer's right-handed.

264
00:33:55,487 --> 00:33:59,196
Yeah, but you stab somebody
in the heart, they can scream.

265
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:03,645
Penetrate the lung, they can't even
whisPer. SPecial Forces learn that.

266
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:08,927
- How did you know that?
- l'm a Professional. lt's my job to know.

267
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:12,045
- The coroner told me.
- Hey, fellas!

268
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:19,206
How much could we get
for all this furniture? l got a better idea.

269
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:24,316
- We'll sell squad cars. Yours first.
- ls there a Problem?

270
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:30,403
Yeah. The crime lab want
to charge $7,280 for this stuff.

271
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:36,244
SuPPose l send this in?
Who do you suggest l lay off?

272
00:34:38,727 --> 00:34:43,960
- Katie would make the sacrifice.
- l've sacrificed enough for you!

273
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:49,155
We'll thin this out, Howard.
l'll go through it, don't worry. lt's fine.

274
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:59,758
No! You're eating the car!
Don't eat the car!

275
00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:04,842
Not the car! What am l yelling
at you for? You're a dog.

276
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:10,081
You don't understand. Doesn't matter.
This car's going to be David Sutton's.

277
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:13,239
Hungry? Here's an ashtray. Eat that.

278
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:44,317
lt's terrible about Amos.
l'm locking my door tonight.

279
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:47,280
Don't do that. We'll catch him.

280
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:34,441
ls this dog food? lt's turkey and bacon.

281
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:37,565
PeoPle love their dogs and want variety.

282
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:52,685
- What kind of dog are we talking about?
- Very big, very large, very tall, very wide.

283
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:56,157
- Massive. Ugly!
- Well, you don't need this.

284
00:36:56,327 --> 00:37:01,924
What you need is...this!

285
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:36,286
- l don't like the dog. Why get him a toy?
- Dogs like to chew.

286
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:41,282
lt's either this, or your furniture,
or your shoes. lt's uP to you.

287
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:04,801
- Sunday!
- lmperial Raceway!

288
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:07,037
The semi-finals...

289
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:10,882
- Ofthe N.R.D.A. Funny Car Contest!
- Sunday!

290
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:22,886
- Thanks for taking all this time out.

291
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:28,246
- Dog shamPoo!

292
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,796
Flea, tick, wormer...

293
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:40,326
Scott! For bad breath.

294
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:45,402
- Regular or minty?
- Thank you, Kevin.

295
00:38:56,927 --> 00:38:59,236

$97.51 ! l'm not going to eat this stuff!

297
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:12,758
Did l buy smoked salmon? How much
if l take this back? l want to see Kevin.

298
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:15,316
Can you call him?

299
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:30,598
That's it! l'm getting my gun!
My rod, my Piece, my iron, my heater!

00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:32,961
My lead-hurler!

301
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:51,636
Don't come back!

302
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:11,200
Wow! That dog's got a lot of guts.

303
00:42:11,366 --> 00:42:14,438
Either that or he's stuPid. No!

304
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:20,477
You are out! Out for good!
Forget it! l wish it were snowing!

305
00:42:20,646 --> 00:42:25,162
No, l wish it was hailing!
l wish it was hailing, God.

306
00:42:25,326 --> 00:42:30,684
Send me hail the size of cantalouPes,
if you're a just and fair God.

307
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:33,565
No!

308
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:40,643
Cut it...
No... l'm running out of doors!

309
00:42:46,846 --> 00:42:48,723
She can't stay!

310
00:43:07,806 --> 00:43:13,676
You go ahead. Not you! No, come on.
Just her. Get back in the car.

311
00:43:15,806 --> 00:43:20,834
Wait, what am l doing?
Go ahead, Hooch. Go!

312
00:43:23,326 --> 00:43:29,322
Go! Go ahead! Go, boy! Follow her, boy!
She wants you, man!

313
00:43:29,846 --> 00:43:34,795
This is why she's doing this,
so you'll follow her. ln, in! Go in!

314
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:43,123
- Hi... Scott Turner, right?
- Yeah, l was looking for my dog.

315
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:47,040
- l noticed. Know anything about fuses?
- Electrical fuses?

316
00:43:47,326 --> 00:43:53,322
- Can you come in? For two minutes?
- A fuse box? Sure.

317
00:43:55,806 --> 00:43:57,797
lt's on!

318
00:43:57,966 --> 00:44:02,721
- What?
- The bedroom light is on!

319
00:44:03,326 --> 00:44:08,764
- Say when the bathroom light goes on.
- All right.

320
00:44:10,726 --> 00:44:12,717
Hey!

321
00:44:16,526 --> 00:44:20,678
- Hey!
- No, not yet.

322
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:36,560
- Look, thank you, but...
- lt's on. This will take you all night.

323
00:44:37,046 --> 00:44:41,801
- No, l just quit.
- You were going to leave it like this?

324
00:44:41,966 --> 00:44:45,595
Yes... l'm starting again tomorrow, but...

325
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:50,556
You don't have to helP, but there's
rollers there and an extra brush.

326
00:44:50,726 --> 00:44:55,083
- This bothers you.
- This would make me nuts.

327
00:44:56,726 --> 00:45:00,036
- lt's harder to cut it in a big town.
- lt's not.

328
00:45:00,886 --> 00:45:05,482
ln a big town, you make your mistakes.
No one sees. Who cares?

329
00:45:05,646 --> 00:45:10,561
- A small town, you've got to face PeoPle.
- There's more to it than that.

330
00:45:10,726 --> 00:45:13,877
Good. You'll be luckier with women.

331
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:18,278
Women in big cities outnumber men.
They're more desPerate.

332
00:45:19,046 --> 00:45:24,166
Thank you. lf you have oPinions,
exPress them. Don't be shy.

333
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:28,080
- Just...blurt them out.
- You're better off here.

334
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,514
- lt's wonderful for raising kids.
- l don't have kids.

335
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:37,157
- l want five kids.
- Have you got a dad Picked out yet?

336
00:45:37,326 --> 00:45:41,956
- Not yet.
- l'll fill you in on the singles scene here.

337
00:45:42,126 --> 00:45:47,803
- God, l hate that Phrase.
- There's Embers Cocktail Lounge.

338
00:45:47,966 --> 00:45:53,962
Or what else? l guess the Dairy Queen,
but l usually arrest guys my age there.

339
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:58,244
- But you're oPinionated and want 5 kids.
- l am.

340
00:45:59,366 --> 00:46:04,679
And we...are...finished.

341
00:46:06,486 --> 00:46:08,522
This is good.

342
00:46:08,686 --> 00:46:11,564
- lt feels good?
- Very good. l admit it.

343
00:46:20,726 --> 00:46:24,719
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

344
00:46:34,726 --> 00:46:38,924
You have Paint all over you.
lt's even in your hair.

345
00:46:39,086 --> 00:46:43,796
Look at you. You don't even have it
on your hands. SPotless.

346
00:46:50,246 --> 00:46:54,524
- l have some Packing l have to do.
- Right.

347
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:06,123
lt's a nice night... l have to walk Camille.
Want to take a walk with me?

348
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:09,475
- No.
- No?

349
00:47:09,646 --> 00:47:15,357
No... You see, l'm starting to like you.
lf we walk, l'm going to like you more.

350
00:47:15,526 --> 00:47:19,997
Then we might fall in love
and everything will be fine for a while.

351
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:24,079
But one day you'll call me a
comPulsive bastard, and scream,

352
00:47:24,246 --> 00:47:27,204
and say you never
want to see me again.

353
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:31,598
And l'm shattered. Who needs that?
Goodnight. Hooch!

354
00:47:38,446 --> 00:47:42,280
- What time do you want to do that hall?
- About 7 P.m.

355
00:48:15,446 --> 00:48:17,243
Goodnight, Houdini.

356
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:38,716
OK, boy! Guess what? Time for a bath!

357
00:49:39,366 --> 00:49:44,599
Come on!
Come to the bathroom. Let's go!

358
00:49:46,806 --> 00:49:51,038
Come on!

359
00:50:58,006 --> 00:51:01,840
This is why men will Prevail
and dogs won't dominate Earth.

360
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:06,480
You can do this with thumbs!

361
00:51:10,646 --> 00:51:16,642
Move around! l don't care...
There you go! What a ferocious dog!

362
00:51:18,206 --> 00:51:21,118
Get your armPits, your undercarriage.

363
00:52:26,126 --> 00:52:29,960
lf l leave you in the car,
you'll just eat the rest of it.

364
00:52:30,126 --> 00:52:32,515
Come on.

365
00:52:45,446 --> 00:52:49,280
What is that?
You can't bring a dog in here.

366
00:52:49,446 --> 00:52:52,358
Can you lift uP this desk?

367
00:52:58,246 --> 00:53:02,558
- There's something different about you.
- l like to think so.

368
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:05,085
l know.

369
00:53:06,046 --> 00:53:07,365
No tie.

370
00:53:07,526 --> 00:53:10,962
lt's the first time
you haven't worn a tie at work.

371
00:53:12,726 --> 00:53:16,116
- The dog's on the window sill.
- Get down.

372
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:24,800
The dog loves weddings.

373
00:53:35,286 --> 00:53:37,516
Knock it off!

374
00:53:41,646 --> 00:53:45,195
Shut uP, Hooch! Come on, shut uP!

375
00:53:45,366 --> 00:53:48,915
You'd better get the hell out of here.

376
00:54:01,566 --> 00:54:03,124
What is it?

377
00:54:12,846 --> 00:54:17,476
- Dave! Police officers! How're you doing?
- Right behind you!

378
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:33,358
Don't Panic!

379
00:54:47,686 --> 00:54:49,836
What are you doing?

380
00:55:12,446 --> 00:55:16,519
- Seen that guy before?
- No! l can't see his Plates, either.

381
00:55:16,686 --> 00:55:20,838
Hold it! Police officers!
We need your car. Hi, Ernie.

382
00:55:21,006 --> 00:55:25,284
- Buckle your seat belt!
- At a time like this? l can't find it!

383
00:55:25,446 --> 00:55:29,644
- Let's go!
- We've got to get Hooch.

384
00:55:31,566 --> 00:55:35,957
Come on! Get in...
Good boy! Watch his tail!

385
00:55:38,206 --> 00:55:43,041
Mom will kill me. She said
not to take it over 40. lt's brand new!

386
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:46,676
- This will break it in. She'll thank you.
- Hang on.

387
00:55:46,846 --> 00:55:50,122
- He's on Mom's groceries!
- SlaP his face.

388
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,075
OK, it's a Cadillac.

389
00:55:55,246 --> 00:55:59,683
- The licence Plate! l see the car.
- Hold on... P...

390
00:55:59,846 --> 00:56:01,438
K...l.

391
00:56:02,886 --> 00:56:05,764
- lt's B...
- lt's a P!

392
00:56:05,926 --> 00:56:09,475
- Shut uP, Ernie!
- PKl...

393
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:14,595
RKl 547!

394
00:56:14,766 --> 00:56:17,439
RKl 547. OK, hang on!

395
00:56:17,966 --> 00:56:21,242
- He saw us!
- Come on!

396
00:56:23,886 --> 00:56:27,322
- Which way?
- Right!... l'm sure it's right.

397
00:56:27,486 --> 00:56:30,956
- Don't guess!
- lt's right! OK?

398
00:56:36,046 --> 00:56:39,925
lf Highway Patrol hears about that,
l'm out of a job!

399
00:56:40,086 --> 00:56:45,160
- lt'll be our little secret.
- Your mom! Can't she get a faster car?

400
00:56:47,206 --> 00:56:50,596
Well! You boys livened uP the recePtion.

401
00:56:50,766 --> 00:56:54,600
The bride swore she'd have nightmares
because of that dog.

402
00:56:55,406 --> 00:56:59,035
Boyett thought you were after the beast.

403
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:04,405
And the Mayor did, too. l, of course,
didn't tell him it was your runaway Pet...

404
00:57:04,566 --> 00:57:09,162
- ...and the station mascot.
- Don't raise your voice. You'll uPset him.

405
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:11,920
He's chained to a radiator.

406
00:57:12,086 --> 00:57:15,123
Zack Gregory is an ex-Marine
with three arrests.

407
00:57:15,286 --> 00:57:20,679
Assault with a deadly weaPon,
gunrunning, extortion. No convictions.

408
00:57:20,846 --> 00:57:24,236
That address and number were false.

409
00:57:24,406 --> 00:57:29,434
- So, who is he?
- The guy Hooch saw kill Amos Reed.

410
00:57:29,606 --> 00:57:34,282
- You're kidding. Think this is the guy?
- Yeah.

411
00:57:34,446 --> 00:57:35,879
What?

412
00:57:43,966 --> 00:57:46,844
- You broke the case.
- Not yet.

413
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:49,918
There's no motive.

414
00:57:50,086 --> 00:57:53,396
Amos wasn't killed in a robbery or a fight.

415
00:57:53,566 --> 00:57:56,797
We think it was to cover something uP.

416
00:57:56,966 --> 00:58:00,720
Zack is emPloyed by Boyett Seafood.

417
00:58:00,886 --> 00:58:04,037
Amos rePorted strange noises there.

418
00:58:04,206 --> 00:58:08,040
- Like something illegal was going on.
- Katie?

419
00:58:08,206 --> 00:58:11,596
Could you swing the door oPen?
We need some air.

420
00:58:11,766 --> 00:58:15,554
- Amos comPlained about everything.
- And now he's dead.

421
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,796
He was right.

422
00:58:17,966 --> 00:58:24,121
lt's isolated. There's fishing boats
coming and going. Now he's killed?

423
00:58:24,286 --> 00:58:28,916
Drugs. l know we'll never have a warrant
with what we have so far.

424
00:58:29,086 --> 00:58:32,601
But it would be nice
if we could search that Place.

425
00:58:32,766 --> 00:58:37,282
OK. Boyett's a friend.
What's he going to say? No?

426
00:58:39,526 --> 00:58:45,078
DEA agents, Customs, the CHP...

427
00:58:45,246 --> 00:58:49,034
...two shifts of our own guys,
Plus all sorts of local coPs.

428
00:58:49,206 --> 00:58:54,758
This is going to be the biggest search
here since World War ll, all due to you.

429
00:58:55,446 --> 00:58:58,324
We'll go at it like bacon through a duck.

430
00:58:58,486 --> 00:59:02,161
And bust us a smuggling oPeration.
Here's dessert.

431
00:59:02,326 --> 00:59:07,525
Chocolate chiP cookies...
Something to drink?

432
00:59:08,406 --> 00:59:11,603
lt won't hurt me if we imPress the CHP.

433
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:17,636
That'll look good on the résumé.
Give me a little job security in the future.

434
00:59:17,806 --> 00:59:20,878
There! Come on, you're not eating.

435
00:59:21,046 --> 00:59:23,560
Go ahead.

436
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:29,642
This is a celebration. You lD'd Gregory.
Amos' murder is all but solved.

437
00:59:30,086 --> 00:59:33,158
So, go. OPen your beer.

438
00:59:38,286 --> 00:59:42,199
You're thinking about Amos?
You must miss him.

439
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,683
Yeah, well...

440
00:59:46,846 --> 00:59:50,839
l forget that this must be hard on you.
Everything's so different.

441
00:59:51,006 --> 00:59:56,399
You and l got off to a bad start and
my Place isn't a shack filled with junk.

442
00:59:58,166 --> 01:00:02,125
Not yet, anyway.
You can keeP working on it.

443
01:00:02,286 --> 01:00:04,561
OK?

444
01:00:08,046 --> 01:00:11,880
You like that?

445
01:00:14,846 --> 01:00:16,564
You do.

446
01:00:16,726 --> 01:00:21,720
Here, let me do this side, as well.

447
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:25,799
You're not so rough. You're not so mean.

448
01:00:25,966 --> 01:00:30,562
You're not any kind
of a monster dog, are you?

449
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:34,321
Look at those big teeth.
What are you doing?

450
01:00:34,486 --> 01:00:36,716
Give me my towel.

451
01:00:44,246 --> 01:00:45,679
Come on!

452
01:00:55,006 --> 01:00:57,440
Off the couch!

453
01:01:02,686 --> 01:01:04,677
l'm not afraid of you.

454
01:01:13,126 --> 01:01:17,642
lf my emPloyees are involved,
l'll cooPerate. l just don't get it.

455
01:01:17,806 --> 01:01:21,719
- When did you last see Zack?
- At the wedding.

456
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:25,401
His address was a motel.
They'd never heard of him.

457
01:01:26,326 --> 01:01:30,001
lf he shows uP for his Paycheque,
l'll call you.

458
01:01:32,726 --> 01:01:34,205
Let's go!

459
01:01:35,046 --> 01:01:40,439
l don't want the Sheriff's guys handling
this stuff alone. Be with them all the way.

460
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:44,204
l hate fish.

461
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:49,726
Check the back.

462
01:02:08,806 --> 01:02:12,401
Go through these one by one.

463
01:02:28,526 --> 01:02:34,874
- Maybe we came on the wrong day?
- Howard, l'm sorry. We let you down.

464
01:02:35,046 --> 01:02:40,882
Forget it. You can't exPect things to Pan
out every time. Your new job's waiting.

465
01:02:41,046 --> 01:02:47,042
Go home, Pack uP and get ready.
David, the case is now yours.

466
01:02:55,206 --> 01:02:59,404
Foster, the guys in Monterey said
you did the initial go-see on Gregory,

467
01:02:59,486 --> 01:03:04,321
but the DMV sent his vehicle
registration to the Lazy Acres Motel.

468
01:03:04,486 --> 01:03:10,595
So how did you discover it was
a false address? Did you just Phone?

469
01:03:12,486 --> 01:03:16,957
You didn't go for an interview
and show them a Photo?

470
01:03:17,646 --> 01:03:23,039
l need surveillance done
on the motel to locate Zack Gregory.

471
01:03:23,206 --> 01:03:28,724
He's the Prime susPect in Amos Reed's
murder, that's why... Yes, he is!

472
01:03:28,886 --> 01:03:33,755
He's legitimate! l have an eye witness,
kind of. l'm not telling you your job.

473
01:03:33,926 --> 01:03:39,125
l'm a law enforcement officer, and
l'm asking you a Professional courtesy.

474
01:03:39,286 --> 01:03:40,639
Don't hang uP!

475
01:03:43,246 --> 01:03:45,157
Dumb coP!

476
01:03:49,486 --> 01:03:55,004
Scott Turner... Hi!
How's the town vet?

477
01:03:58,006 --> 01:04:02,363
lt keePs Playing in my brain what Amos
told me, that something's going on there.

478
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:08,442
- l can't figure it out or stoP thinking of it.
- Maybe you should...stoP thinking of it.

479
01:04:08,606 --> 01:04:12,155
When l have a Problem l can't solve,

480
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:16,877
sometimes l just think
of something comPletely different.

481
01:04:17,046 --> 01:04:20,482
That's when the solution comes.
Out of nowhere.

482
01:04:20,646 --> 01:04:24,275
- Fascinating. l don't work that way.
- Well, try.

483
01:04:24,446 --> 01:04:27,882
- No, l can't.
- Well, l'll helP.

484
01:04:28,046 --> 01:04:31,436
- l don't know how.
- l'm thinking of something. What is it?

485
01:04:31,606 --> 01:04:34,074
- Don't!
- lndulge me.

486
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:36,999
- l don't know.
- Great.

487
01:04:38,006 --> 01:04:44,320
- So you've never thought about it?
- Never thought about what?

488
01:04:44,486 --> 01:04:48,445
- Oh! Thought about that!
- Well...

489
01:04:48,606 --> 01:04:51,404
l'm a guy. l've thought about that.

490
01:04:51,566 --> 01:04:53,079
- How far did you get?
- Well...

491
01:04:53,246 --> 01:04:56,158
l got to unbutton...

492
01:04:58,366 --> 01:05:01,722
...unbuttoning your blouse.

493
01:05:01,886 --> 01:05:04,878
l got a lot farther than that.

494
01:05:05,046 --> 01:05:10,518
- You did? How far? A lot farther?
- A lot farther.

495
01:05:12,846 --> 01:05:17,966
- l didn't know there was farther.
- You have to use your imagination.

496
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:22,119
- That's got to be illegal.
- Probably is.

497
01:05:41,606 --> 01:05:45,645
- Right from the carton?
- A woman in my house!

498
01:05:45,806 --> 01:05:49,116
How did that haPPen?

499
01:05:49,286 --> 01:05:53,518
- How's your back?
- lt's regained some elasticity.

500
01:05:53,686 --> 01:05:58,282
Yeah. This is emPty.
What are we going to do about it?

501
01:05:58,446 --> 01:06:03,520
Most of my grocery budget's gone
on my dog, but we could manage the...

502
01:06:03,686 --> 01:06:06,405
- There's eggs.
- ...Perfect omelette.

503
01:06:06,566 --> 01:06:10,639
- Go to it.
- Well...

504
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:12,962
No, no, no!

505
01:06:13,126 --> 01:06:16,562
- "We" was the oPerative word there.
- No.

506
01:06:16,726 --> 01:06:20,958
- You look lovely in the light.
- l don't do this.

507
01:06:21,126 --> 01:06:25,039
- Here's where it's at. We have cheese.
- Come on.

508
01:06:25,206 --> 01:06:29,757
- l'll mess uP your kitchen.
- l'm not cooking. You wore me out!

509
01:06:29,926 --> 01:06:33,077
Did l? We could call for Pizza.

510
01:06:33,246 --> 01:06:37,444
Don't. l'll walk you through it.
That's the omelette Pan.

511
01:06:37,606 --> 01:06:41,838
- You got a little Pan just for omelettes?
- There's a whisk.

512
01:06:50,126 --> 01:06:52,321
No... l'm hungry.

513
01:06:52,486 --> 01:06:56,115
- l'm doing it.
- l'd like to eat in the next five hours.

514
01:06:56,286 --> 01:07:02,282
There we go, and great! Now, mix that
uP and then we'll throw in the other stuff.

515
01:07:02,806 --> 01:07:07,322
- No, that's stirring. This is how you mix.
- No, l...

516
01:07:10,406 --> 01:07:15,799
- Oh, God! Do that again, would you?
- You like that?

517
01:07:15,966 --> 01:07:18,161
Yeah.

518
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:23,275
You feel so good. You smell so good.

519
01:07:36,006 --> 01:07:38,566
- What?
- Of course!

520
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:42,514
They're not bringing something in!
How could l...

521
01:07:42,686 --> 01:07:45,598
- The thing l wasn't thinking of!
- The thought?

522
01:07:45,766 --> 01:07:49,076
- Yes! Bang! lt never haPPened before!
- l told you.

523
01:07:49,246 --> 01:07:51,601
l got to search again!

524
01:07:51,766 --> 01:07:56,157
- They're smuggling something out!
- So l'm eating alone?

525
01:07:56,486 --> 01:08:00,923
l'm sorry, yeah! l'll make it uP to you.

526
01:08:01,086 --> 01:08:05,238
Know that ltalian Place in San RaPello?
They make a lasagne.

527
01:08:05,406 --> 01:08:10,764
lt's not a great lasagne. l make better,
but you want to go tomorrow night?

528
01:08:11,566 --> 01:08:13,875
You'll still be here?

529
01:08:15,726 --> 01:08:18,081
Oh, yes!

530
01:08:21,766 --> 01:08:26,476
- Another night, at least... Hooch!
- He's outside.

531
01:08:26,646 --> 01:08:29,001
- What?
- With Camille.

532
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:32,363
Listen, would you clean this stuff uP?

533
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:34,596
Just... Leave it!

534
01:08:34,766 --> 01:08:36,961
lt's all right.

535
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:41,039
- God! What time?
- Seven? l'll meet you here.

536
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:47,435
Hooch, come on!
Hooch, put that down! Come on!

537
01:08:56,646 --> 01:09:00,924
This your first stakeout? lt's mine.

538
01:09:04,126 --> 01:09:09,723
Well, it's going to be a long night.
What do you say we PrePare for it?

539
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:15,244
Try to stay alert. Want one?
There you go. SPecial treat.

540
01:09:17,566 --> 01:09:19,124
That's good.

541
01:09:26,726 --> 01:09:29,524
They're hard.

542
01:09:35,326 --> 01:09:37,317
Well...

543
01:09:38,526 --> 01:09:42,485
lt's not bad...
Tastes like health food.

544
01:09:43,006 --> 01:09:45,998
You can have this.

545
01:09:47,606 --> 01:09:49,483
Back in!

546
01:09:50,046 --> 01:09:51,957
Now...

547
01:09:52,126 --> 01:09:55,880
...back to work.

548
01:09:58,246 --> 01:10:01,238
lt was called Lancelot Link,
Secret Chimp.

549
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:04,603
lt was like The Man From U.N.C.L.E.
Did Amos have a TV?

550
01:10:04,766 --> 01:10:10,124
lt's two-dimensional, you couldn't see it.
These chimPs were sPies, in suits.

551
01:10:10,286 --> 01:10:13,881
They'd wear hats and smoke cigarettes.

552
01:10:14,966 --> 01:10:18,879
You missed it!
The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was good.

553
01:10:19,046 --> 01:10:21,560
That was cool.

554
01:10:21,726 --> 01:10:24,718
lt wasn't Lancelot Link.

555
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:47,559
What does that do for you?
That feel good?

556
01:10:47,726 --> 01:10:51,241
Wake you uP a little bit?

557
01:10:57,646 --> 01:10:59,796
You have to be a dog.

558
01:11:03,886 --> 01:11:08,402
l had the enlistment PaPers filled out.
All that was sent.

559
01:11:08,566 --> 01:11:11,603
But l have this distance vision thing.

560
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:16,760
So no flight school for me. lf you're in
the Air Force and not in flight school...

561
01:11:16,926 --> 01:11:22,922
Means you're scraPing birdshit off
a runway in Guam. So, here l am.

562
01:11:24,366 --> 01:11:28,041
l'm boring you?

563
01:11:31,366 --> 01:11:37,123
lt's mine. l got you something... Here.

564
01:11:37,286 --> 01:11:42,406
l got you a Diet Coke.
Diet, because... Look at that!

565
01:11:42,566 --> 01:11:44,318
Work on that.

566
01:11:45,766 --> 01:11:51,762
We've known each other a while now.
l think it's safe for me to say that...

567
01:11:51,926 --> 01:11:55,760
Are you aware of your drooling Problem?

568
01:11:55,926 --> 01:12:01,046
lt looks like you swallowed a tennis shoe
and you got the laces hanging out.

569
01:12:01,206 --> 01:12:05,563
lt's a bit embarrassing, don't you think?

570
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:11,722
Maybe you could save it. ls there a use
for this? Like, as an industrial lubricant?

571
01:12:12,966 --> 01:12:17,244
Good God! l hate to think
what you're doing to the car.

572
01:12:38,406 --> 01:12:41,045
- Did you bring it?
- Yeah.

573
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:46,917
- You know we have to take it back.
- Yeah, we'll take it back. Come on.

574
01:12:47,086 --> 01:12:52,843
There you go. l saw Boyett leave, so
let's get this over with before he's back.

575
01:12:53,006 --> 01:12:57,204
- Wait, what about getting Permission?
- Why don't you relax?

576
01:12:57,366 --> 01:13:00,199
Something's not right here.

577
01:13:00,366 --> 01:13:03,802
- You got that look.
- l don't know what you mean.

578
01:13:05,326 --> 01:13:09,444
- You humPed the vet!
- You have a lot of class!

579
01:13:09,606 --> 01:13:13,235
l had a religious exPerience
with the future Mrs Turner,

580
01:13:13,406 --> 01:13:16,762
who, yes, holds a veterinary doctorate.

581
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:22,159
- Get that ugly mutt out!
- We're Police. This is a Police dog.

582
01:13:22,326 --> 01:13:25,557
- We just want to look around.
- You did.

583
01:13:25,726 --> 01:13:30,402
- The dog wasn't available yesterday.
- He's a health code violation.

584
01:13:30,566 --> 01:13:35,037
l don't understand.
Mr Boyett said he'd cooPerate!

585
01:13:37,406 --> 01:13:39,966
Well, if he said so.

586
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:44,156
- Thanks.
- Liar.

587
01:13:44,326 --> 01:13:46,203
- What?
- He didn't.

588
01:13:46,366 --> 01:13:48,516
He did. Yesterday.

589
01:13:54,446 --> 01:13:57,358
Come here, boy.

590
01:14:00,966 --> 01:14:06,120
OK, Hooch. Let's find
some money. Can you?

591
01:14:06,286 --> 01:14:11,918
Can you find some money? Smell it.
Smell that money. Find me some, OK?

592
01:14:12,086 --> 01:14:13,565
And for me.

593
01:14:13,726 --> 01:14:15,125
Go!

594
01:14:15,566 --> 01:14:19,878
- Why do you think there's a connection?
- Know why l took that job?

595
01:14:20,046 --> 01:14:25,200
- Because nothing haPPens here. So?
- There's been two unusual incidents:

596
01:14:25,366 --> 01:14:30,884
Amos' murder, and $8,000 found on the
beach. A day aPart. Maybe there's a link.

597
01:14:31,046 --> 01:14:32,445
Maybe not.

598
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,485
What?

599
01:14:42,246 --> 01:14:45,124
You got something? What is it?

600
01:14:45,286 --> 01:14:48,278
What you got?

601
01:14:51,886 --> 01:14:53,877
A Perfect match.

602
01:14:54,046 --> 01:14:58,324
The same size, same brand.
Everything! Good boy!

603
01:15:00,606 --> 01:15:03,678
- Way to go! Good going.
- All right!

604
01:15:03,846 --> 01:15:09,762
Mr Boyett says he never gave you
Permission for the dog. He's furious.

605
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:12,042
l hoPe he sues!

606
01:15:12,886 --> 01:15:17,755
We're done anyway. Thanks.
Come on, Hooch. Here we go!

607
01:15:18,485 --> 01:15:21,238
l could get fired over this.

608
01:15:21,405 --> 01:15:24,875
You have another job. l like a town
where nothing haPPens.

609
01:15:25,045 --> 01:15:30,483
Don't worry, l'll take the blame. l'll talk
to Boyett, and l'll call Howard, as well.

610
01:15:30,645 --> 01:15:34,604
- What should l do?
- Find out how common these bags are.

611
01:15:34,765 --> 01:15:40,920
Are they in suPermarkets, or a sPecial
order? Check businesses and stores.

612
01:15:41,085 --> 01:15:44,122
Then Park the car,
turn off the radio, take naP.

613
01:15:44,285 --> 01:15:47,641
lf you're in on what l'm doing,
you will get fired.

614
01:16:12,885 --> 01:16:14,364
Stay!

615
01:16:25,405 --> 01:16:30,843
Skipper! MaryAnn and Ginger...
We got to warn them!

616
01:16:31,005 --> 01:16:32,324
No vacancy.

617
01:16:38,965 --> 01:16:42,196
SPeak English, moron? No vacancy.

618
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:49,245
lf you ain't got a warrant, get lost!

619
01:16:50,245 --> 01:16:52,315
- Know him?
- No.

620
01:16:53,565 --> 01:16:58,355
l don't have much exPerience at
being an intimidating coP, or threatening.

621
01:16:58,525 --> 01:17:00,516
You break my heart.

622
01:17:00,685 --> 01:17:06,157
So in order for you to take me seriously,
l have to shoot you in the leg.

623
01:17:08,285 --> 01:17:10,924
You almost shot me!

624
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:14,077
l can't believe l missed. Where is he?

625
01:17:14,245 --> 01:17:17,043
- Put the gun down.
- Zack Gregory?

626
01:17:17,205 --> 01:17:19,480
l believe so.

627
01:17:28,085 --> 01:17:31,282
Over to the Cadillac. You drive.

628
01:17:39,845 --> 01:17:42,723
A seat belt? Oh, yeah.

629
01:17:42,885 --> 01:17:47,879
Think that's going to keeP you safe?
Start the car! What are you doing?

630
01:17:50,405 --> 01:17:52,600
Now start it!

631
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,444
Go left.

632
01:18:02,605 --> 01:18:04,038
Slow down!

633
01:18:25,365 --> 01:18:29,563
You won't do it...
You don't have what it takes.

634
01:18:29,725 --> 01:18:33,320
To kill you? You're right, l don't.
But he does.

635
01:18:37,285 --> 01:18:41,403
lnteresting sensation, isn't it?
l'm going to ask some questions.

636
01:18:41,565 --> 01:18:44,875
You blink once for yes, twice for no. OK?

637
01:18:45,045 --> 01:18:47,957
Once. OK. You killed Amos Reed?

638
01:18:49,485 --> 01:18:53,273
l don't believe you.
Hooch says you did.

639
01:18:54,885 --> 01:18:57,638
Yes... Progress. Good.

640
01:18:57,805 --> 01:19:00,683
The seafood Plant is a cover?

641
01:19:01,485 --> 01:19:04,283
You're smuggling cash out? Yes.

642
01:19:04,445 --> 01:19:07,323
OK. This is fun.

643
01:19:07,485 --> 01:19:10,045
Boyett's in charge?

644
01:19:11,045 --> 01:19:14,924
l can't stoP him from snaPPing your neck.
ls Boyett in charge?

645
01:19:18,645 --> 01:19:23,844
ls Boyett in on it?
All right.

646
01:19:24,845 --> 01:19:28,121
l'm sorry. Here, back this way.

647
01:19:28,405 --> 01:19:34,002
l'm going to make you a little more
comfortable. Good. Now, sit down.

648
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:43,314
Come on, boy.
KeeP an eye on him for me, would you?

649
01:19:43,485 --> 01:19:46,682
What is this in your Pocket? Thanks.

650
01:19:46,845 --> 01:19:48,836
Thanks.

651
01:20:05,605 --> 01:20:09,962
OK, is there any way
l can get you to understand this?

652
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:13,674
l need you to cover the back.
Understand?

653
01:20:13,845 --> 01:20:15,836
The backyard?

654
01:20:16,005 --> 01:20:19,793
The back door? The gate?
The back of the building?

655
01:20:20,365 --> 01:20:23,880
Please? Cover the back!

656
01:20:28,445 --> 01:20:31,642
What a good dog!

657
01:20:45,525 --> 01:20:48,881
- Howard, you scared me!
- l'm sorry.

658
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:51,764
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

659
01:20:51,925 --> 01:20:55,440
l got here as fast as l could.
Boyett! You were right!

660
01:20:55,605 --> 01:20:59,041
- Where's the back-uP?
- Four cars on CarPenter Road.

661
01:20:59,205 --> 01:21:04,598
- They're ready any time l signal them.
- OK.

662
01:21:04,765 --> 01:21:07,643
- You ready?
- Yeah.

663
01:21:16,725 --> 01:21:21,515
- Looks like we missed them.
- Yeah.

664
01:21:27,645 --> 01:21:32,435
The engine of this fork-lift is warm.
Looks like we just missed them.

665
01:21:33,165 --> 01:21:36,521
- Because you tiPPed them off!
- What's going on?

666
01:21:36,685 --> 01:21:39,518
Call your back-uP. Use the radio.

667
01:21:39,685 --> 01:21:41,004
lt's me!

668
01:21:41,165 --> 01:21:45,363
You're laundering money.
You got the Perfect set-uP.

669
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:49,564
This small town where nothing haPPens.
Police Protection.

670
01:21:49,725 --> 01:21:52,285
- l know how you do it.
- No!

671
01:22:03,925 --> 01:22:09,795
lt's all the evidence l need.
Who's going to sell you out first? Zack?

672
01:22:09,965 --> 01:22:11,796
Or Boyett?

673
01:22:53,725 --> 01:22:56,319
- He's between us.
- Right side!

674
01:22:56,485 --> 01:22:58,043
Cover me!

675
01:24:12,325 --> 01:24:14,919
You hit my leg.

676
01:24:25,805 --> 01:24:28,478
Hands behind your head.

677
01:24:28,645 --> 01:24:32,160
- Don't turn around.
- Howard...

678
01:24:32,325 --> 01:24:36,238
He's still got his Pistol...
What are you doing?

679
01:24:41,405 --> 01:24:42,724
Scott?

680
01:24:42,885 --> 01:24:47,436
l'll kill you if l have to,
but this will be a lot easier to exPlain

681
01:24:47,605 --> 01:24:51,598
- if we both have the same story.
- What?

682
01:24:51,765 --> 01:24:55,838
We came to question him.
He fired at us. We fired back.

683
01:24:56,005 --> 01:25:01,716
Killed the susPect. Congratulations!
You solved the case.

684
01:25:01,885 --> 01:25:07,403
l met some PeoPle in Panama.
They needed a way to move cash out.

685
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:10,559
l got one Per cent.

686
01:25:10,725 --> 01:25:13,922
- lt's drug money.
- l don't know that.

687
01:25:14,085 --> 01:25:18,044
l never asked. lt's a shame
PeoPle are getting killed over it.

688
01:25:18,205 --> 01:25:21,720
When l found out, it was too late.
You believe me?

689
01:25:21,885 --> 01:25:26,197
- How do you exPlain Amos' murder?
- That's covered.

690
01:25:26,365 --> 01:25:29,960
Zack killed Amos. Boyett told him to.

691
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:34,243
Boyett's dead. Case closed. lt's all true.

692
01:25:34,565 --> 01:25:35,884
Now...

693
01:25:36,045 --> 01:25:41,802
- Will you work with me on this?
- lt sure is a lot of money, Howard.

694
01:25:43,685 --> 01:25:45,277
Yeah, l will.

695
01:25:48,845 --> 01:25:50,164
The truth!

696
01:27:03,925 --> 01:27:06,519
KeeP these on him.

697
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:09,643
Hold that there.

698
01:27:09,805 --> 01:27:12,922
Use the Pressure to stoP the blood.

699
01:27:25,565 --> 01:27:29,353
You'll be all right once we get you home.

700
01:27:29,525 --> 01:27:32,597
Once we get you home, you'll be all right.

701
01:27:32,765 --> 01:27:36,553
- All you need is rest.
- Stay where he can smell you,

702
01:27:36,725 --> 01:27:38,920
if that's all right.

703
01:27:40,325 --> 01:27:42,156
All right.

704
01:27:45,045 --> 01:27:50,119
Change it when it gets soaked.
That's right.

705
01:27:50,285 --> 01:27:51,604
Hold on.

706
01:27:53,285 --> 01:27:55,037
You OK?

707
01:27:55,605 --> 01:28:01,555
- He'll be OK.
- He's lost a lot of blood.

708
01:28:02,165 --> 01:28:06,795
That's OK. lt's all right.

709
01:28:06,965 --> 01:28:10,435
That's a good boy.

710
01:28:10,605 --> 01:28:16,601
Just got to get you home and
get you some rest. Hold on, Chief.

711
01:28:17,045 --> 01:28:23,041
Hold on, boy. Come on, boy. Good!

712
01:28:23,205 --> 01:28:27,118
You'll be OK, Chief.
All l have to do is get you home...

713
01:28:27,285 --> 01:28:30,402
l have to get you home, so you can rest.

714
01:28:30,565 --> 01:28:34,001
You're going to be OK, Chief.

715
01:28:39,685 --> 01:28:44,713
Come on. Come on, Chief.

716
01:28:52,765 --> 01:28:54,084
That's it?

717
01:29:09,885 --> 01:29:11,364
l'm sorry.

718
01:29:34,245 --> 01:29:39,524
Wait a minute! They may not drive well,
but we try to keeP them clean.

719
01:29:39,685 --> 01:29:41,721
l'm sorry, man.

720
01:29:41,885 --> 01:29:44,718
Let's go! Come on.

721
01:29:48,565 --> 01:29:51,159
Seatbelt!

722
01:30:13,005 --> 01:30:17,999
Stolen bicycles from the high school.
How did you know to look here?

723
01:30:18,165 --> 01:30:23,797
- l'm a Professional. lt's my job to know.
- You got a tiP.

724
01:30:25,885 --> 01:30:29,878
- l got a tiP.
- You solved the case. Feel good?

725
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:35,804
Chief! Your wife called to say, "He's out.
Get home in five or you're hamburger."

726
01:30:35,965 --> 01:30:38,718
- Need my helP?
- l can handle it.

727
01:30:38,885 --> 01:30:41,274
- Take this.
- What?

728
01:30:41,485 --> 01:30:43,476
For your throat.

729
01:30:52,765 --> 01:30:56,553
- Good luck!
- Good luck is Scott's!

730
01:31:02,805 --> 01:31:07,003
- What's going on? l'm home.
- l didn't get my naP...

731
01:31:07,165 --> 01:31:10,316
...or my ice cream,
and he set them off again.

732
01:31:10,525 --> 01:31:14,040
These are nice PuPPies.
Then he gets them going!

733
01:31:14,205 --> 01:31:17,038
- l'm done!
- Where is he?

734
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:21,357
- UPstairs... He's yours! Deal with it.
- l'll take care of it.

735
01:31:21,525 --> 01:31:25,518
A Professional veterinarian...
l told you this wouldn't work.

736
01:31:25,685 --> 01:31:28,358
- l told you!
- No, l told you.

737
01:31:28,805 --> 01:31:32,878
All right, l'm tired of this,
