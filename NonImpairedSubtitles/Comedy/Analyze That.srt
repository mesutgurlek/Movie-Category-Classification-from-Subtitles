1
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:25,428
How did he know about the money?

2
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:28,070
And how did he know
that Tony Cisco got popped?

3
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,729
We didn't find out about it
till this morning.

4
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:34,104
- I don't know.
- It was Peezee. Gotta be.

5
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:37,212
He hates your fucking guts.

6
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:40,875
- I don't know.
- What is so hard to understand here?

7
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,678
You said Peezee was a mamaluke
and couldn't be trusted.

8
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:46,988
Now all of a sudden
you got a soft spot for this guy.

9
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:50,251
- I just don't think it was him.
- Okay, I'll buy it.

10
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:54,795
If not Peezee, then who?
Who? Tell me.

11
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,028
I think it was you, Ducks.

12
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:03,767
You gotta be kidding.

13
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:08,642
Caesar? Caesar, you know me.

14
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:12,209
What kind of fucking idiot would
I have to be to try that with you?

15
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:15,315
- A dead fucking idiot.
- Come on, Caesar.

16
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,519
Caesar.

17
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:19,348
Caesar!

18
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,408
- This is garbage. Change the channel.
- Okay, Paul.

19
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:45,405
No. Hey!

20
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,981
What are you doing, asshole?

21
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:54,821
Sorry, Mr. Vitti.
Didn't mean any disrespect.

22
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,250
Oh, man.

23
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,956
- Forget about it.
- Punks.

24
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:04,065
Let them watch what they want.
I'm going to bed.

25
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:05,826
- Good night, Paul.
- Good night.

26
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:08,732
- All right, what do youse wanna watch?
- Little Caesar!

27
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:10,469
All right, all right.

28
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,505
Step out.

29
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:17,305
- Hey, Earl, what's up?
- They're transferring me.

30
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,641
- Did you ask to be transferred?
- Not me.

31
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:21,579
- What's up?
- I don't know.

32
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:24,049
Anyway, thanks
for looking out for me, Paul.

33
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,087
- I'll see you around.
- Sure.

34
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:13,995
Isaac Sobel was a man of rigorous belief
and unflinching honesty.

35
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,540
A patriarch with an almost biblical sense
of integrity and conviction.

36
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,203
A man of faith and courage,
of spirit and humor.

37
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,474
A rock and a tree.

38
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,118
A good friend who will be deeply missed.

39
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:37,685
I'd like to call on Isaac's son, Dr. Ben Sobel,
who would like to say a few words.

40
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:51,000
It's not easy for me
to talk about my father...

41
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:54,803
...because, in a sense,
I'm talking about two people.

42
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:58,072
One is the public Isaac Sobel...

43
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,681
...the eminent psychotherapist...

44
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,048
...and popular author known to millions
of readers across the world.

45
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,917
The second is the private man.

46
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,116
My father.

47
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,451
Dad.

48
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:15,628
And for those of you
who knew him well...

49
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:19,598
...and know our family,
well, I don't have to tell you.

50
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,431
He was a psychotic, mind-fucking prick.

51
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:25,438
An arrogant, ego-inflated son of a bitch.

52
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:29,169
I wish you were alive
so I could kill you. Rot in hell!

53
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:34,377
Now I'd like to call on Isaac's son,
Dr. Ben Sobel...

54
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,075
...who would like to say a few words.

55
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:43,724
Who the hell would have
a cell phone in here?

56
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:49,657
It's yours.
Answer it before they notice.

57
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:52,164
- Hello?
- Guess who, you fuck?

58
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:53,967
- I have to take this.
- What?

59
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:56,332
I'm sorry. It's mine.
I have to take this.

60
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,502
- Yes?
- I left three fucking messages.

61
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:00,904
- You don't call me back?
- This is not a good time.

62
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:04,308
Not a good time? Let me explain something,
I'm in fucking hell right now.

63
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,916
- This is not a good time.
- This is a very bad time. My father died.

64
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:09,346
Get off.

65
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:12,017
- I have to go.
- Don't you hang up on me, you...

66
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:13,780
- Call back.
- They're trying to kill me.

67
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:38,108
Hey, Fredo. Yeah, you, Guido.

68
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:41,941
Come over here.
I've got something to show you.

69
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,919
You're a dead man.

70
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,021
385, mess hall.

71
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:36,269
- Thanks, Lorenzo.
- Thank you.

72
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,139
I can't believe he's gone.

73
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:44,836
I can't believe what you said.
"Cold and withholding"?

74
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:48,643
- You had to tell everybody?
- Why didn't you take a swing at the casket?

75
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:51,184
I might have strayed
from my notes a little bit.

76
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:56,448
I'm grieving. It's a big loss,
and grief is a process.

77
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,658
Mr. And Mrs. Sobel,
your housekeeper let us in.

78
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,559
I'm Agent Miller,
this is Special Agent Cerrone.

79
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,199
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

80
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,461
- We'd like to ask you a few questions.
- Can I ask what this is about?

81
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,696
We've just come from a funeral.

82
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:13,239
We know this is a difficult time for you.
It will only take a minute.

83
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:17,344
Sure, sit down.

84
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:20,808
- Sorry about your father.
- Thank you very much.

85
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:26,751
It's very, very difficult.
I'm gonna miss him terribly.

86
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:33,086
I mean, there were issues, like there are
in any father-and-son relationship.

87
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,025
He wasn't a very warm man.

88
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:36,597
- Ben.
- Yeah?

89
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,859
Once today. Enough.

90
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:43,228
Okay. No, I'm just saying
that even so, he was a...

91
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,499
...great, great legs...

92
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:46,835
Man.

93
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:50,376
Dr. Sobel, you received a call
this morning from Paul Vitti.

94
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,108
Why would you say
that I got a call from Paul Vitti?

95
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,877
Because we monitor
all his phone calls from Sing Sing.

96
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,847
Then, yes, I did.

97
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:01,649
- That was him? On the phone?
- Yes.

98
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:05,055
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, talk about withholding.

99
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:07,560
- Michael.
- You told her at the drop of a hat.

100
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,460
Well, she's in the FBI.
She needs to know this information.

101
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,397
Okay, I see, and I don't.
I don't need to know these things.

102
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:17,835
No, don't tell Laura.
She can't possibly handle a phone call.

103
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:19,531
Did I say that? Did I say that?

104
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,110
- You folks need a minute?
- No, we're fine.

105
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:25,543
Yeah, we're phenomenal.
Listen, I'm gonna go to the kitchen.

106
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:30,209
Just two words of advice,
as one professional woman to another:

107
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:32,047
Pants suit.

108
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:39,718
She's grieving. You know, it's a process.

109
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:42,161
Vitti?

110
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:46,097
We were involved in some
organized-crime activity a few years ago.

111
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:51,172
I mean, I wasn't, you know, "involved."
He was involved.

112
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,400
But I was treating him
therapeutically at the time...

113
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:58,013
...and then some people tried to kill us.

114
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,511
It was really nothing.

115
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,913
Shortly after you two spoke,
he seemed to have some kind of breakdown.

116
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:05,315
Really? What kind of breakdown?

117
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:08,651
I think you had better go up there
and see for yourself.

118
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:25,537
I'm treating him with Thorazine.
300 milligrams, b.i.d.

119
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,642
Seems to keep him pretty calm.

120
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,278
That would keep
the Middle East pretty calm.

121
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:35,443
And he just keeps singing
West Side Story songs?

122
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:38,348
"Tonight." "Maria." The balcony scene.

123
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:43,385
You should get him to do "Officer Krupke."
It's really good.

124
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,661
- Paul?
- Maria?

125
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:55,303
Paul, it's me. Dr. Sobel.

126
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:56,995
Maria?

127
00:10:58,307 --> 00:10:59,797
Tony?

128
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,706
Maria! Oh, Maria!

129
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:08,816
- Oh, my God! Thank God you've come!
- Yes.

130
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:11,009
- You've got to get me out of here!
- Okay.

131
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,121
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

132
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:15,553
- Te adoro.
- Te adoro.

133
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:21,288
This is how it's been.

134
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:25,127
He sings for a while,
then he goes completely catatonic.

135
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:27,030
And you did a neurological workup?

136
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:31,333
Yeah. No tumors, no seizures,
no sign of stroke.

137
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:32,906
Paul?

138
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:37,378
If you're faking, Paul, I'm gonna know.

139
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:45,281
When I was a resident,
we used to play with the catatonics.

140
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:57,960
Well, I don't think he's faking.
I don't think he's smart enough.

141
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,068
Street smart, yeah...

142
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:04,297
...but we're talking about an IQ
just north of a bedroom slipper.

143
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:10,473
So if he is truly...

144
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,013
...catatonic, if I stuck him
with this needle...

145
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:16,879
- This is just plain saline, isn't it?
- Yeah.

146
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:20,818
Yeah. Then he shouldn't
feel a thing. Right?

147
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,727
That's gotta hurt.

148
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,821
No reaction at all.

149
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,764
I want to do some
neuropsychological testing, okay?

150
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:35,898
Sure.

151
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,644
Paul, I'm gonna give you some tests
to assess your mental condition, okay?

152
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:49,148
Now, do I have your consent
to share the results of the tests?

153
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:53,319
Mommy is mad at me
because I made a boom on the rug.

154
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,821
- I'm gonna take that as a yes.
- Good.

155
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,084
Okay.

156
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:03,327
Paul, I have 10 cards, each with
a picture of an inkblot on it, okay?

157
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,092
Here's the first card.

158
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:08,665
Now look at it,
and tell me what you see.

159
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:10,703
I see a bat.

160
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,268
A bat or a weasel.

161
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,903
- A bat or a weasel?
- Yeah.

162
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:18,808
Bat. Bat-weasel.

163
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:22,882
Do you see anything else?

164
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:26,953
Just a pussy with teeth.

165
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:31,092
- Pussy with teeth.
- Yeah.

166
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,656
Next card.

167
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,372
Excellent, Paul.

168
00:13:48,544 --> 00:13:50,671
One hour and 12 minutes.

169
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:54,714
I want you to take a look at this
picture and tell me what's happening.

170
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,614
I think we got a picture of a guy,
nice, hardworking fella.

171
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:01,278
Comes home, sees his wife
is in bed with a midget...

172
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:04,255
...and she's been fucking him
while he's out of town.

173
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,690
So she's having intercourse...?

174
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:08,420
With a midget.

175
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,367
Very good.

176
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,398
It doesn't matter
who they know downtown.

177
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:17,228
Tell them they got no leverage.

178
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:20,898
- Mr. Chapin?
- Come in. Come in. All right.

179
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:24,341
- Hi, I'm Dr. Ben Sobel.
- Hi. Thanks for coming in. I appreciate it.

180
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:27,073
- My pleasure.
- So, what have we got?

181
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:28,648
Okay...

182
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:34,387
Based on his symptoms and his test results,
I would call it brief psychotic disorder...

183
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:36,855
...and if it persists,
schizophreniform disorder.

184
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:41,292
And Dr. Kassam, the psychiatrist
at Sing Sing, concurs with the diagnosis.

185
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:45,229
- So he's crazy.
- Not crazy. No. At least not permanently.

186
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:51,401
See, in certain people, prolonged exposure
to extremely stressful situations...

187
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:56,511
...like soldiers in combat, for instance,
or disaster victims or hostages...

188
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:00,171
...can produce a temporary
psychotic state.

189
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:03,682
- How temporary?
- A day, a week, a month...

190
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:06,252
...if the precipitating stresses are removed.

191
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:10,116
Which means he's not gonna get better
as long as he's in the can.

192
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,556
He could conceivably get worse.

193
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:15,094
Right now he thinks
somebody is trying to kill him.

194
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:18,995
And he could deteriorate to the point
where he's permanently schizophrenic.

195
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:23,002
Then he's got a real problem. He goes
before the parole board in four weeks.

196
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,572
Would they actually release him?

197
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:28,676
Oh, yeah. I'm sure they'll want
to release a major Mafia figure...

198
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,369
...who's now certifiably deranged
on top of it.

199
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,879
Why don't they release him
to a halfway house...

200
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,313
...or a center where he can get
the care he needs?

201
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:39,420
Based on my earlier work with him,
I don't think he's dangerous...

202
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:43,354
...and I think he's making
a strong effort to reform himself.

203
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,625
Okay...

204
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:50,128
...I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

205
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,362
I'm gonna release him
into your custody.

206
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:57,369
Mine? Oh, no.
No, I couldn't... No. No. No.

207
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,703
Mr. Chapin, thank you, anyway,
but this is a very bad time for me.

208
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,141
- See, my father just died.
- I'm sorry.

209
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:08,809
And I'm grieving. It's a process.
And I have a bulging disk in my neck.

210
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,483
And I have this burning sensation
when I urinate...

211
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:16,386
- Yeah, I've had that too.
- We're redecorating, which is a nightmare.

212
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,389
- You wanna see him killed in prison?
- No.

213
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,824
Or sent to a facility
for the criminally insane?

214
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:22,793
- Of course not.
- Then he's all yours.

215
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:26,901
I told my son we couldn't have a dog.
I'm gonna bring home Paul Vitti?

216
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,934
I'm gonna talk
to the Bureau of Prisons...

217
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:32,232
...and get you certified
as a temporary federal institution.

218
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,638
I can't be an institution.
I work in the suburbs.

219
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,005
I handle neurotic soccer moms
and alcoholic Gentiles...

220
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:40,239
You have got 30 days to get him
into shape for his parole hearing.

221
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,749
That means sane, sober
and gainfully employed.

222
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:47,350
Now I'm warning you, doctor.
If he screws up in any way, if he flees...

223
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:50,219
...or if I find out this was a setup
to get him on the street...

224
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:53,520
...I will hold you totally responsible.

225
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:55,391
And you will pay dearly.

226
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:59,694
You'll be stripped of your license
and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

227
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,094
Are we clear?

228
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:03,935
Yes.

229
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,404
Do you want him or not?

230
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:13,804
- Yes.
- Good choice. We'll be in touch.

231
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:19,520
- Tony.
- Hi, how are you?

232
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:20,677
You okay?

233
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,456
- Doctor, sign here and here, please.
- Okay.

234
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:28,856
Okay, thank you very much.

235
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:44,609
You fucking piece of shit! I tell you someone
is trying to kill me and you hang up on me?!

236
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,910
- I knew it. I knew it! You faked!
- You stuck me with a fucking needle!

237
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:52,247
- You used me to get you out of prison.
- It took you long enough.

238
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:55,822
I'm singing West Side Story
for three days. I'm half a fag already.

239
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,186
- What were you doing?
- I was in a funeral home!

240
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,659
What's that got to do with somebody
trying to kill me? You're my doctor!

241
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,889
- My father died.
- So?

242
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:07,832
With you, it's always, "Me, me, me."
He's dead, so get over it. That's life.

243
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,937
Are you hearing this?
Are you hearing you?

244
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:13,905
- I'm deeply sorry for your loss, okay?
- Yeah, I can see how touched you are.

245
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,773
- All right. Who's after you?
- You tell me.

246
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:20,642
Could be my old crew, could be
the Rigazzis, Lou the Wrench.

247
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:22,784
Lou the Wrench? Why "the Wrench"?

248
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,977
The guy's a maniac.
He twisted some guy's head off once.

249
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:28,749
- Off?
- Off. Totally off.

250
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:33,327
The feds are putting pressure on everybody.
All the families are fighting each other.

251
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,963
It's like the fall
of the Roman Empire. WWIII.

252
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:38,622
- What does this have to do with you?
- They knew I was getting out.

253
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:40,996
The last thing they want to do
is see me get into it.

254
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,867
Just explain to them that you're out of it
now and you're starting a new life.

255
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,507
That's a really imaginative thought.
I wish I could have thought of that.

256
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:51,111
Maybe they'd throw a party
and give me a gold watch.

257
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,440
What, are you kidding me?

258
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:56,277
Believe me, nobody's happy
that I'm getting out. Nobody.

259
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:12,796
- Wanna grab your stuff?
- No. Jelly's gonna pick me up in an hour.

260
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:15,300
I don't think you understand.
You're in my custody.

261
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,837
You stay here. Therapy every day.
You can't leave without permission.

262
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,201
You gotta be kidding me.

263
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,071
Are you coming in, or do I have
to make a phone call?

264
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,843
Some fucking life this is gonna be.
Get my bags.

265
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:33,713
Do you really think he's crazy?
Don't you wanna get a second opinion?

266
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,559
If he thinks I think he's crazy,
he's crazier than I think he is.

267
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:40,290
Locked up, he's of absolutely no use to us.

268
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:44,193
But back on the street, Vitti has
enough juice to be a threat to both families.

269
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,163
It's like throwing gasoline on a fire.

270
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:50,868
- That's if he goes back to his old life.
- People like Paul Vitti don't change.

271
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,599
He's been a menace to society
since he was 12 years old.

272
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,973
- Being a criminal is all he knows.
- He's gonna head straight back for trouble.

273
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:01,912
Then all we have to do is sit back
and pick up the pieces.

274
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:05,247
We need to stay on Vitti.

275
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:08,052
How could you?
How could you bring him here?

276
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:12,284
That mobster in my house,
eating off of my dishes.

277
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,659
It's not like I had a lot of choice.

278
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,094
It's a new law?
You have to bring home a gangster?

279
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:20,565
He's in my custody.
I am a temporary federal institution.

280
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:24,297
- Why couldn't he just go home?
- Because his wife and his family are in Ohio.

281
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,135
Sure, yeah, everybody gets
to go to Ohio except me.

282
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,903
- You wanna go to Ohio?
- That's not the... Shut up!

283
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:32,876
His life was threatened.
He didn't want to endanger his family.

284
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:36,040
How thoughtful.
But it's okay to endanger our family?

285
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:39,585
I know this is a terrible imposition,
but it's not like I wanted him here.

286
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:44,055
Well, you didn't want him,
and I didn't want him, but here he is.

287
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:46,217
Here he is.

288
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:48,295
Hey, you.

289
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,131
- Coffee?
- What?

290
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,062
Somebody said something about coffee.

291
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:55,131
Yeah, that was you.
You said you wanted some.

292
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:58,000
So, what's the holdup?

293
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,968
Ben, why don't you make
your friend some coffee.

294
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:05,102
I'm gonna take a long bath.
And hopefully drown.

295
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:09,507
Excuse her, usually
she is a wonderful hostess...

296
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:12,613
...but she's grieving. It's a process.

297
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:15,686
Hey, doc, listen.

298
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,655
I got a friend coming over,
so I don't want you to be surprised.

299
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:22,593
What kind of friend?
Because if it's the Wrench, or the Pliers...

300
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:25,198
- No, it's a personal thing, you know?
- Oh, yeah?

301
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,460
They won't be staying late, will they?

302
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:30,332
- Are you that fucking pussy-whipped?
- I'm not...

303
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:33,804
- This has nothing to do with Laura.
- I just heard her busting your balls.

304
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:35,500
We were having a disagreement, yes.

305
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:37,702
But some conflict is normal
in a marriage.

306
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:39,139
- Or?
- Or what?

307
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:41,874
- You're pussy-whipped.
- Paul, I am not...

308
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,315
When the coffee's ready,
I'll be upstairs. Good night, whippy.

309
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:06,807
Forty minutes.

310
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:09,937
- How long are you gonna let them go on?
- Let them?

311
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:11,841
How much longer can they go on?

312
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:16,246
Another five minutes, I'll break it up
or I'll call the Guinness Book of Records.

313
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,487
Oh, God. Oh, God.

314
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:26,622
Give me a break. She's faking.

315
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:28,658
What?

316
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,354
Nobody sounds like that.

317
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:32,490
Oh, yeah.

318
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,433
Oh, God. Oh, God!

319
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:40,433
Come on, nobody sounds like that.

320
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,271
- I don't know.
- "I don't know."

321
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,140
Yeah?

322
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:51,478
- Paul, I have to talk to you.
- What's up?

323
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:53,518
- I have to talk to you.
- Talk later?

324
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:55,087
Now.

325
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:57,620
Hold on.

326
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:01,458
- Yeah?
- I have a 17-year-old son.

327
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:05,860
I'll ask her.

328
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:08,264
That's not what I'm talking about.
I need to speak to you.

329
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:11,535
Actually, I'm right in the middle
of somebody. Can't you see?

330
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:13,773
Paul, now.

331
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:18,675
And, miss, there's no smoking
in my house. Thank you.

332
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:23,416
Okay, Paul, what do you think
you're doing?

333
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:25,780
Minding my own business,
like you should be doing.

334
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:28,650
That's difficult to do with
The VaGina MonoloGues in the guest room.

335
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,792
I been in the can
for two and a half years.

336
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:32,654
- What am I supposed to do?
- Go to a hotel.

337
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,924
That's what I wanted. You told me I can't.
You said it's either here or Sing Sing.

338
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:40,125
I'm not trying to punish you,
but I do have some responsibilities.

339
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:43,931
I thought you might appreciate a nice
home-cooked meal after being in prison.

340
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:47,940
Yeah, that's what I've been jerking off to
for the last 850 nights in a row.

341
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,874
A fucking home-cooked meal.
Tuna casserole!

342
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:52,673
- All right, Paul?
- Doc?

343
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,181
- The girl's gotta go.
- The girl? You know, I bet you're jealous.

344
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:59,050
Yes, I'm very...
And what might I be jealous of?

345
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:00,984
I didn't hear nothing
out of your room.

346
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:04,648
We don't think it's necessary to wake
the neighbors every time we have sex.

347
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:07,488
If you're quiet, you could do it
without even waking your wife.

348
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:08,924
Paul, that is not funny.

349
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:11,621
What is that?

350
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,634
I told her if I wasn't back in two minutes
to start without me. I gotta go.

351
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:20,036
- This is not a good start.
- It was for me till you knocked on my door.

352
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,683
- Here, Aunt Esther.
- Thank you.

353
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,978
And again, I'm so sorry
we had to put you up at a hotel.

354
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:37,387
We would've loved to have you stay with us,
but we had an unexpected houseguest.

355
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,284
His father always had room for us.

356
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:41,827
- Don't say that to me.
- Shut up.

357
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:44,522
You go to hell! I am so out of here!

358
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:47,361
Go on, get out of here,
you fucking pain in the ass!

359
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:51,199
You crazy pain in the ass!
Get the fuck out of here!

360
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:55,503
Go ahead, go back to turning tricks
in Hoboken, you pain in the ass!

361
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:59,108
How's it going?

362
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:00,543
Food.

363
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:03,808
Paul?

364
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:06,579
- Paul, what are you doing?
- Hey, doc.

365
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,156
I'm just looking for something
to eat over here. This all you got?

366
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:13,924
Who do you have to fuck
to get some bacon around here?

367
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:16,623
Not you, I hope.

368
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:20,059
He's new in town. Let's go in the office,
I'll make you a plate.

369
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:23,898
- What's in the office?
- We're gonna go to the office and talk first.

370
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:28,706
Hey, doc, what's up with your family?
They tend to overreact a little.

371
00:25:28,877 --> 00:25:31,778
I know. All you did was flash everybody
in the dining room.

372
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:36,316
By the look of some of them broads, they
ain't seen the old salsicc' for a long time.

373
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:38,008
- It's good for them.
- Good for them?

374
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:42,054
Well, when the paramedics revive
my aunt Golda, I'll be sure to ask her, okay?

375
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:44,124
Sit down.

376
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:48,962
So...

377
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:52,656
Paul, do you mind?

378
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:57,962
I think we've seen enough
of the old salsicc' for one day. Thank you.

379
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:00,732
So, what are you gonna do, Paul?

380
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,605
I'm gonna find out
who's trying to kill me. I'm a target.

381
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:07,771
They could shoot through that window
and blow my fucking head off. Then what?

382
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:12,852
- So I gotta deal with that.
- That would be a priority, I understand that.

383
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:15,581
I'm talking about a job, work.

384
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:17,918
There's gotta be something
that you like to do.

385
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:21,153
I like hitting guys over the head
with a baseball bat. That's good.

386
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,762
So sporting goods.

387
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:25,126
- Yeah, exactly.
- That's interesting.

388
00:26:27,235 --> 00:26:28,497
So who are you?

389
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:32,838
- Who am I?
- I just wanna know how you see yourself.

390
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:36,506
I'm Paul Vitti. I'm the boss.

391
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,609
The boss of what? The boss of Jelly?

392
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:42,013
Because you're not the boss of me.

393
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,481
So, what are you the boss of?

394
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:50,990
I see what you're doing, you.
I see. I get it.

395
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,923
- What am I doing?
- You're pissing me off. That's what.

396
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:56,527
Look at me. I'm starting to get anxious.

397
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,428
It's very understandable
that you're anxious.

398
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:02,627
I mean, you spent your whole life
becoming something that you were...

399
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:05,602
...and now you can't be that anymore,
so it's scary.

400
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:10,508
I mean, if you're not
Paul Vitti "the boss," who are you?

401
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:12,272
Let me ask you this way.

402
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:16,183
When you were a kid,
what did you want to be?

403
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:20,485
- I was a kid. Who remembers that shit?
- But you had to want to be something.

404
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:23,818
- Did you want to be a baseball player?
- No.

405
00:27:23,992 --> 00:27:26,187
A fireman? An astronaut.

406
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:29,853
Come on, what did you wanna be?

407
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,063
- It was stupid.
- It's not stupid.

408
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,830
- What, are you afraid to tell me?
- Yeah, I'm afraid.

409
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:41,999
So tell me. I'm not here to judge you.
What did you want to be?

410
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,138
There was one time
when I was about...

411
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:52,150
...maybe 6, 6 and a half, 7.
Right in there. Right in that time.

412
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,748
I thought that I wanted to be a...
I wanted to be a...

413
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,327
For a second...
You know, a little kid.

414
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:04,727
- What?
- Maybe... I was a kid, you know?

415
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:06,457
Little kid.

416
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:08,192
What?

417
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:11,604
- Tell me.
- I wanted to be a cowboy.

418
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,738
- A cowboy, really?
- Would you believe that?

419
00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:16,536
Well, that's interesting.

420
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:17,700
How did that start?

421
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:21,814
I was watching television
with my mother, father.

422
00:28:21,983 --> 00:28:24,713
You know, we watched
those cowboy shows.

423
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,579
And my...

424
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:32,823
My father got me the whole outfit.

425
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:34,985
He got me a 10-gallon white hat...

426
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:38,132
...the boots, the spurs, the cap guns...

427
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:40,701
...the whole bit.

428
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:44,896
Then he took me upstate to my uncle's farm
and led me around on this little pony.

429
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:49,066
And there was cows and all that stuff.
It was like, to me, the Wild West.

430
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:53,146
And it was all "yippee kai-ay"
and all that stuff. You happy now?

431
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:55,474
So, what happened?

432
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,977
- I don't know. What happened?
- Why didn't you try to be a cowboy?

433
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,716
I was in East Harlem. I joined a street gang
when I was 12 years old.

434
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:05,515
"Why didn't I become a cowboy?"

435
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:09,322
Something else happened when you
were 12 that was very difficult for you.

436
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:11,221
Yeah.

437
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:14,101
That's when your father was murdered.

438
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:16,897
Yeah, I think about it every day.

439
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:23,503
- What's that got to do with anything?
- It has a lot to do with things.

440
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:28,081
It's very interesting because your father
was the one who got you the white hat.

441
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:32,851
He was in the Mob,
but yet he wanted you to be a hero.

442
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:36,752
Yeah, he did.

443
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:39,155
Your father wanted you to have
a better life than he did.

444
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:40,919
He did, yeah.

445
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:45,026
He wanted me to go to college.
I didn't even go to high school, hardly.

446
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,169
That's because he had died
and he wasn't around to guide you.

447
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:52,971
See, Paul, before, you said,
"I'm Paul Vitti, the boss"...

448
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:56,866
...but when I look at you,
I see Paul Vitti the 12-year-old kid...

449
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,878
...who's scared and confused
with a lot of hard choices to make.

450
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:07,140
You.

451
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:10,416
- You. You're good, you.
- No, Paul...

452
00:30:10,588 --> 00:30:13,386
- No, you're good. You're better than good.
- It's just the beginning.

453
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:16,618
You're real good.
You made me realize I'm a little fucking kid.

454
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:20,561
That's all I wanted. I never could
figure it out with my father. That's great.

455
00:30:20,732 --> 00:30:23,496
- But you have to...
- It's clear now. New choices, new things.

456
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:26,865
New beginnings. I'm ready.
I'm here, front and center. Let's go.

457
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,371
There's somebody that I work with.
He's a career counselor.

458
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:34,672
- He places people in jobs. He's excellent.
- I'm ready. Sign me up. I'm ready to go.

459
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:37,337
- I'm ready to jump in with both feet.
- That's great.

460
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:39,005
- I'm ready!
- Down!

461
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:46,650
That was not a good thing.

462
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:48,720
Hi, doc.

463
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:53,327
- Jelly, what are you doing here?
- Hey, doc. It's been a while.

464
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:56,023
- I thought you were in prison.
- It would appear not.

465
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:58,601
- Well, how did you get out?
- I had a new trial.

466
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:02,228
It turns out the evidence
in my first trial was, you know, tainted.

467
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:03,396
I see.

468
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:08,979
Anyway, two of the witnesses decided
not to testify, and the third guy...

469
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:10,444
...he committed suicide.

470
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:12,043
How?

471
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:15,778
He stabbed himself in the back four times
and threw himself off a bridge.

472
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:17,620
Very unfortunate.

473
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,040
Good to have you back.

474
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,868
We're in a war, Paul.
It's not safe out there.

475
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:45,413
The Rigazzis are walking all over us.

476
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,847
We need you, Paul.

477
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:51,183
You know, Sally, I'm out of it.

478
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:54,382
- It's over for me. I don't do this no more.
- The family needs you.

479
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,460
What are you talking about?
No one did the big jobs like you.

480
00:31:57,629 --> 00:32:00,860
Air France, they're still talking about it.

481
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:04,331
Paul, think about it. For me?

482
00:32:06,137 --> 00:32:08,002
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

483
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,174
Come on, what is this?
A fucking funeral?

484
00:32:11,342 --> 00:32:14,800
You just got out of college, for chrissakes.
Let's have a party.

485
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:18,176
I'll have one drink,
and then I gotta go see the boss.

486
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,728
- Yeah, what?
- "Yeah, what?"

487
00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:34,160
That's how you answer the door, you?
"Yeah, what?"

488
00:32:34,332 --> 00:32:35,959
You got a problem with that?

489
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:41,002
- Yeah, what?
- Don't bother getting up on our account.

490
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:49,479
Paul, what a nice surprise.

491
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:52,707
- Yeah, Patti, how's it going?
- It's good.

492
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:54,351
Come here, you. Give me a kiss.

493
00:32:57,322 --> 00:32:58,516
Get over here.

494
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,682
Come on, what did I do?
What did I do that you're mad at me?

495
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,957
Come on.

496
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:08,532
- How are you, Paul?
- All right.

497
00:33:11,903 --> 00:33:14,371
- You missed a spot.
- You can't be too careful.

498
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:17,303
Hey, I know. Sorry to hear about Carmine.

499
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:20,778
- He was a good man.
- Yeah, I know.

500
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:25,075
You live with someone for 21 years. Then
one day they pull his torso out of the river.

501
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,115
- It's hard.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

502
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:30,550
Especially since the talk was
that you were the one that put him there.

503
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:34,123
- That's why I try not to gossip. It's ugly.
- Yeah, it is.

504
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:40,629
Just a sec. Michelle, Theresa, it's 10:30.
Stop fucking around and get ready for ballet!

505
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:44,364
It's so hard being a single parent
and a career woman.

506
00:33:44,535 --> 00:33:47,527
For instance, a lot of people
are saying now that you're out...

507
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:50,173
...that you're gonna try
and take the family from me.

508
00:33:50,341 --> 00:33:54,072
I said, "No, Paul would
never do that to me."

509
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:56,236
- Never. Not me.
- Good.

510
00:33:56,748 --> 00:33:59,410
So you look good.
What, have you been working out?

511
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:02,883
Yeah, I been working out who's been
trying to kill me. Got any ideas?

512
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:05,189
It's a dog-eat-dog world out there.

513
00:34:05,356 --> 00:34:08,883
And you know nobody will be safe
unless we end this thing with the Rigazzis.

514
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,928
- So you had nothing to do with it?
- Paul, calm down, okay?

515
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:15,930
I did not try and kill you. All right?

516
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,864
Look, I want us to be friends, you know?

517
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:20,698
Who knows?

518
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:23,466
Maybe we'll be more than friends.

519
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:25,108
You wanna lick my beaters?

520
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:28,769
Patti, let's get serious.

521
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:31,177
I wanna be left alone, okay?

522
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:35,046
I'm not doing anything,
I'm just taking care of my own self...

523
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,983
...which is what I should
always be doing, and that's it.

524
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,715
- Sure, I understand, okay?
- You understand?

525
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:44,794
I do. I understand. Relax.
Sit down, I'll make you a cup of coffee.

526
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:47,557
No, I gotta go. I got a business thing
with some guy.

527
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:51,759
If you get something going, we'd expect
some kind of consideration. A little taste.

528
00:34:51,936 --> 00:34:55,167
- No, this is a legitimate thing. It's different.
- You gave me a chill.

529
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,932
Yeah, well, you'll get over it.

530
00:34:57,108 --> 00:35:00,976
Give me a kiss.
Come on, give me a kiss, you.

531
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:03,272
- Take care of yourself, huh?
- You too.

532
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:04,710
All right.

533
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:08,875
- Don't be a stranger, Paul.
- Yeah, I'll see you around.

534
00:35:10,888 --> 00:35:12,446
Watch him like a hawk.

535
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:17,151
It would break my heart, but if he steps
out of line, shoot him in the fucking head.

536
00:35:17,328 --> 00:35:19,762
It'll be my pleasure.

537
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:27,634
Look at the size of that trunk.
You could put three bodies in there.

538
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,101
Just kidding.
Just trying to levitate the situation.

539
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:35,738
- Okay, thank you. We appreciate it.
- Sure.

540
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:40,043
- Hey, what kind of car youse drive, anyway?
- It's a Lexus 430 LS.

541
00:35:40,218 --> 00:35:41,776
That's like a Toyota.

542
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:45,282
- It's a Lexus.
- Yeah, Toyota, Lexus, same thing.

543
00:35:45,456 --> 00:35:48,323
Japanese, right?
Let's not forget Pearl Harbor.

544
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:51,621
Anyway, let's get serious.
You wanna buy this car, or what?

545
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:54,395
- We have to think about it.
- What's to think about?

546
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:59,195
You told me you liked it. You asked me
10,000 questions. I answered every one.

547
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,964
You drove it. You love it.
What more do you need to know?

548
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,166
You know, it's a lot of money,
and we need time to consider it.

549
00:36:05,343 --> 00:36:07,436
Consider it?
Why don't you consider this.

550
00:36:07,612 --> 00:36:09,512
You been breaking my balls for an hour...

551
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,240
...asking me about
every goddamn accessory in this car.

552
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:15,511
- "What about the light?"
- You cannot talk to customers like that.

553
00:36:15,686 --> 00:36:17,347
You're not a customer
as far as I'm concerned.

554
00:36:17,522 --> 00:36:20,685
- You want to buy the car or not?
- Not from you. I wanna see the manager.

555
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:23,258
You wanna see the manager?
I'll show you the manager.

556
00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:25,589
- Here's the manager. Right here.
- Unbelievable.

557
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:27,025
- Come on.
- Wanna talk to him?

558
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:28,990
What should I do?
Throw them out!

559
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:31,397
You hear him? He just said,
"Throw them out."

560
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:34,504
What should they get?
Tell them to get a Honda!

561
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:37,106
Hey, he just said it. He's the boss.

562
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:39,766
So tell me, how was your first day?

563
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:41,536
Good. Good. Good.

564
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:46,206
That's great, Paul. That's great.
Did you sell any cars?

565
00:36:47,285 --> 00:36:48,343
Almost.

566
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,680
6:45, okay.

567
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:54,222
- Paul, thanks for everything.
- We have been waiting here 20 minutes.

568
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:57,520
I only got two hands, left and right.
I can slap you with either one.

569
00:36:57,695 --> 00:37:00,994
Now get out of here.
You're a pain in the ass. Come on.

570
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:04,965
- Mr. Torre. Mr. Torre. Let him through.
- Hey, Paul. Glad you're out.

571
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,439
- How are you? My son Michael.
- Hey, Michael, nice to meet you.

572
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:10,699
- I wanted to ask you something.
- Yeah?

573
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,002
You think the Yankees
are gonna go all the way?

574
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:17,238
- We'll do our best.
- It would be very important to me personally.

575
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:19,713
Very important.

576
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:23,153
- Try.
- I'll talk to the team.

577
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:25,289
- Go eat.
- Joe, good to see you.

578
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,120
- Welcome back.
- Thank you, Charlie.

579
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,987
Hey, Paul.

580
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:32,755
- Hey, Joey.
- How are you? I heard you was out.

581
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:35,788
- Yeah, well, you know...
- The table for six isn't ready.

582
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:37,400
I'm gonna take the four now.

583
00:37:37,568 --> 00:37:39,559
When Mr. Arnold comes in
bring him right back.

584
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:43,239
So, what are you doing?
You working here?

585
00:37:43,407 --> 00:37:46,308
You know, I'm on parole.
I gotta be a good boy, you know?

586
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:50,038
I got a piece of the joint.
So, what am I going to do? I gotta...

587
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:52,307
I get it. We're gonna
have a drink at the bar.

588
00:37:52,483 --> 00:37:55,941
- All right, okay. I'll see you, Joe.
- Nice to meet you.

589
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:05,352
Big smiles, everybody.

590
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,498
Thanks, Paul. Appreciate it.

591
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:10,099
Hey, can you get us a Pelligrino,
round of drinks...

592
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:13,032
...and more bread
when you get a chance? Thanks.

593
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:15,695
- You want more bread?
- Yeah. Bread.

594
00:38:17,975 --> 00:38:19,704
There you go.

595
00:38:21,078 --> 00:38:22,943
I'll get your drinks now.

596
00:38:23,548 --> 00:38:27,382
This stone is supposed to be a G color.
It looks a little yellow, doesn't it?

597
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:30,612
That's the fluorescent light.

598
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:32,688
It makes everything look yellow.

599
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:36,691
No, I thought fluorescent light
makes everything look blue.

600
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:41,628
What am I, Edison? That's a fuck... It's the
fluorescent light doing that. That's a G.

601
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:44,165
Well, maybe.

602
00:38:44,368 --> 00:38:46,063
Look from that angle.

603
00:38:46,237 --> 00:38:48,068
What do you think?

604
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,467
I don't...

605
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,335
I don't know.

606
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:55,241
- It's a little...
- Yeah.

607
00:38:57,248 --> 00:39:00,581
Could we look at it with a lens?
That might help us out.

608
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:01,877
Do you have a lens?

609
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,587
We just asked for a lens.

610
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:21,167
- Where do you think you're going?
- Where am I going?

611
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:24,206
The orphanage found my real parents.
I'm going to Jelly's house.

612
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:27,776
No, you're not. You're in my custody.
And we have therapy to do.

613
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:31,437
For what? The more we talk, the worse I get.
Look at me. I'm a fucking wreck.

614
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:34,084
- I had that dream again.
- The one where you're Mussolini?

615
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:38,477
No, the other one.
You know, I'm 16, you're Freud.

616
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:41,056
And then I'm scared out of my mind...

617
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:44,717
...and these giants are coming at me
with guns. And I'm fighting them off.

618
00:39:45,896 --> 00:39:46,885
Too bad.

619
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:48,425
- The limp-sword dream?
- Yeah.

620
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:51,432
- I probably shouldn't be listening to this.
- Well, then don't.

621
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:53,035
Paul?

622
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:54,296
Sorry.

623
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:56,030
Let's talk about it.

624
00:39:57,908 --> 00:40:00,172
And you don't think this dream is sexual?

625
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:03,370
You're thinking the sword is my cock,
I can't get it up. That ain't it.

626
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:07,108
Because I was with Sheila last night,
I had a hard-on you could swing from.

627
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:11,051
- I don't need to know that.
- You could hang wet towels on this one.

628
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:13,452
Congratulations. It's a nice thing to have.

629
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:18,061
- He's built like a racehorse in that area.
- Thank you. I get it.

630
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:20,959
- I've seen it.
- Hey, wait in the car, you.

631
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:24,330
- So, what does it mean?
- Sex can mean a lot of things.

632
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:27,096
I think, in this case,
it's about performance anxiety.

633
00:40:27,271 --> 00:40:29,330
You're under a lot of pressure.

634
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:32,908
You're changing your life,
you're trying to find a job that fits you.

635
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:35,602
Doc, nothing is gonna fit though.
This 9 to 5 bullshit?

636
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,941
Forget about it. I'll fucking kill myself.

637
00:40:38,115 --> 00:40:41,346
You know they take taxes out
of your paycheck? What the fuck is that?

638
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:43,987
Like, I'm doomed.

639
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:48,120
I'll wind up selling hot dogs on the street.

640
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:50,655
Take a deep breath, Paul.

641
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:55,060
- I mean, my heart's beating like a rabbit!
- Just relax. You're hyperventilating.

642
00:40:55,232 --> 00:40:57,996
That's all it is.
Here, breathe into this bag.

643
00:40:58,169 --> 00:41:02,435
And breathe in and then breathe out.
In, out.

644
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:05,006
- This is your fault.
- Excuse me?

645
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:07,007
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

646
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:10,238
You tell me to get a job like
I'm a fucking nobody. It's humiliating.

647
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:13,679
Really? Is it? You know what,
I'm doing the best that I can. All right?

648
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:16,786
If it's not appreciated,
or if my best isn't good enough for you...

649
00:41:16,954 --> 00:41:19,980
...then find somebody else to talk to,
you selfish son of a bitch!

650
00:41:20,157 --> 00:41:22,421
Because I didn't ask to be born!

651
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:34,500
What the hell is that about?

652
00:41:34,672 --> 00:41:38,199
I'm sorry. I'm grieving. It's a process.

653
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:44,037
All right, I'm the patient. That's enough.

654
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:50,120
Now what are you taking?

655
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:52,278
Echinacea, goldenseal.

656
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:56,358
Immune system.
There's a lot of plants and ticks.

657
00:41:57,595 --> 00:41:59,187
Okay.

658
00:41:59,363 --> 00:42:02,526
Do you know the television show
Little Caesar?

659
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,689
Yeah, I know it.

660
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:06,632
The producer of the show
is a man named Raoul Berman.

661
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:10,467
A mutual friend told him I know you,
so Mr. Berman called me this morning...

662
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:13,109
...and said that he would like to meet you.
- For what?

663
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:16,041
I don't know. Why don't
you meet him and find out?

664
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:24,346
We just got him out of our house.
Now we're having dinner with him?

665
00:42:24,522 --> 00:42:27,116
- That's not very professional, is it?
- It's social.

666
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:30,226
He's meeting a television producer
who could give him a job.

667
00:42:30,394 --> 00:42:34,296
He's very nervous about it, and he
asked me to buffer. I'm here to buffer.

668
00:42:34,465 --> 00:42:36,763
He's a grown man.
Why does he need a chaperone?

669
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:41,064
He doesn't. He needs a buffer.
That's me. I'm here in a buffering capacity.

670
00:42:41,238 --> 00:42:44,002
If you say "buffer" one more time...

671
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:50,003
331, they're all inside.
We're gonna go eat something.

672
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:52,115
We'll be back before they finish dinner.

673
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:54,148
Didn't you just take two of those?

674
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:59,483
Did I? No, that was the other... The Chinese
herb enzyme thing. This is different.

675
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:01,591
Just don't drink anything.

676
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:06,458
Drink? Honey, I'm a doctor,
I know what I'm doing.

677
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:12,832
I adore this place.
It is the best sushi in town.

678
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,498
Yeah, it smells good.

679
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:20,041
Did you try the yellowtail, Paul?

680
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:24,739
They got any real food around here?
I mean, this is like eating fucking bait.

681
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:34,623
Raoul, what's very interesting about Paul
is that he was born without a filter.

682
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:39,491
He has no filter. He says whatever comes
through his mind. He never edits himself.

683
00:43:39,663 --> 00:43:41,130
- What's with you?
- What do you mean?

684
00:43:41,298 --> 00:43:45,496
- You sound like a fucking retard.
- I took a pill. I took an ibuprofen pill.

685
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:48,331
I probably shouldn't
have had the mai tai or the sake.

686
00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:52,567
It interacted, and it's giving me a little
problem with my upper lip. That's all.

687
00:43:52,743 --> 00:43:55,974
- It will be gone in about an hour.
- Will you shut the fuck up?

688
00:43:56,146 --> 00:43:59,582
See that?
He just told me to shut the fuck up!

689
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,809
I love it! I absolutely love it.

690
00:44:01,986 --> 00:44:05,183
In two seconds, I'm gonna stick
this fork in your fucking eye.

691
00:44:06,423 --> 00:44:09,984
He will stick a fucking fork in my eye!
What did I tell you?

692
00:44:10,528 --> 00:44:11,517
Unfiltered.

693
00:44:11,695 --> 00:44:13,720
Could I get another one of these, please?

694
00:44:13,898 --> 00:44:15,889
Me too. I'd like a cosmopolitan.

695
00:44:16,066 --> 00:44:17,590
- No. No. No.
- Why not?

696
00:44:17,768 --> 00:44:20,498
- The buffer has had too much.
- Okay.

697
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:24,107
Mr. Berman, I love your show.

698
00:44:24,842 --> 00:44:25,831
Thank you.

699
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,808
And Anthony Bella,
the guy that plays Nicky Caesar?

700
00:44:28,979 --> 00:44:33,507
He grew up in Bensonhurst, right
next door to my cousin's friend's husband.

701
00:44:33,684 --> 00:44:37,017
I hate to bust your bubble, but there's
no way he's from Bensonhurst.

702
00:44:37,187 --> 00:44:40,384
He's, like, a professional Italian
from Connecticut or someplace.

703
00:44:40,558 --> 00:44:45,621
Listen, Paul, I have to ask, would you be
interested in working on Little Caesar...

704
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:50,028
...as a consultant and technical advisor,
you know, coaching the actors?

705
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,328
Making sure the dialogue rings true.

706
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:57,463
- Yeah, whatever.
- Oh, my God! This is so exciting!

707
00:44:57,641 --> 00:44:58,630
Fantastic!

708
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:02,370
How about a toast?
A toast to Paul and Little Caesar.

709
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:03,979
Down!

710
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:15,821
That restaurant was really good.

711
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:18,553
I liked it up until the attempted whacking.

712
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:21,630
Now, is that the right terminology,
Mafia shrink?

713
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:23,655
Sorry.

714
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:28,396
Do you know that you were muttering and
drooling like one of your relatives tonight?

715
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:30,540
What are those pills? What are you taking?

716
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:33,609
You know, at this point,
anything I can get my hands on.

717
00:45:33,777 --> 00:45:37,645
Okay? Because I am staring
into a big hole that I can't fill up.

718
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:43,682
You don't need this. You don't need
this Paul Vitti thing in your life right now.

719
00:45:43,854 --> 00:45:46,322
Especially not right now.

720
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:50,583
I think you need to be grieving
for your father.

721
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:55,964
You know, it's just, I'm finding
the whole thing just a little confusing.

722
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,071
You know, I became a therapist...

723
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,141
...because he was a therapist.
I mean, it was that easy.

724
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:11,907
Because his approval was so important
to me. I mean, it was everything.

725
00:46:12,082 --> 00:46:14,846
And I never really got it.

726
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:18,981
So now I'm thinking, is this...?

727
00:46:19,156 --> 00:46:20,919
Is this the reason I did it?

728
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:25,391
And now that he's gone,
do I still wanna do this?

729
00:46:25,562 --> 00:46:27,427
Because I don't know.

730
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:30,125
Come here, baby.

731
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,165
I just want you to be happy.

732
00:46:37,841 --> 00:46:39,536
Hey, pal.

733
00:46:43,947 --> 00:46:48,008
- I'll ask you once. Who are you working for?
- I'm working for your mother.

734
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,087
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

735
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:55,715
Yeah. No, no, no, wait, wait!
Stop! Wait! Wait!

736
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:58,020
- Stop!
- Who are you working for?

737
00:46:58,195 --> 00:47:00,390
Get me up! Stop! Get me up!

738
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:01,758
Drop him.

739
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:03,957
I'm working for Lou the Wrench. Rigazzi.

740
00:47:04,134 --> 00:47:05,499
- The Wrench?
- Yeah, the Wrench.

741
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:09,628
- How do you spell his name?
- I don't know how to spell it. R-I-Z-A-Z-Z...

742
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:12,674
Can't even spell his fucking name right,
you fucking moron.

743
00:47:12,843 --> 00:47:13,832
Pull him up.

744
00:47:19,316 --> 00:47:21,113
What's the matter with you?

745
00:47:21,285 --> 00:47:22,775
You said drop him.

746
00:47:22,953 --> 00:47:25,615
- I said pull him back up.
- That ain't what I heard.

747
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:28,781
Then you heard what you wanted to hear.

748
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:31,456
I guess you got me there.

749
00:47:55,185 --> 00:47:57,050
What the hell happened to you?

750
00:47:57,221 --> 00:47:58,882
Vitti threw me off a roof.

751
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:02,419
Vitti? You talked to Vitti?

752
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:03,924
Yeah, I talked to Vitti.

753
00:48:04,094 --> 00:48:06,824
- What did you say to him?
- Nothing.

754
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:12,229
- You sure you didn't tell him anything?
- I didn't say anything, Mr. Rigazzi.

755
00:48:12,402 --> 00:48:15,064
Can I go now? I think my leg's broken.

756
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:18,675
That must hurt, huh?
Wait a minute.

757
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:20,935
I have something for that.

758
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:30,678
I hate to see people in pain.

759
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:32,651
Get him out of here.

760
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:35,649
What about Vitti?

761
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:38,158
He's a hard man to kill.

762
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:40,722
But he's not immortal.

763
00:48:41,598 --> 00:48:43,498
Our time will come.

764
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:45,259
- Okay, roll film.
- Background.

765
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:56,673
Hey, I like my sausage burnt.

766
00:48:56,847 --> 00:49:00,544
I don't know how you like your sausage?
I been doing this 20 fucking years.

767
00:49:00,717 --> 00:49:03,584
- You got the money?
- I almost got it.

768
00:49:03,754 --> 00:49:08,157
I'm still light 15 large.
But don't worry about it, I got it covered.

769
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:09,314
All I gotta...

770
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:10,824
All I gotta...

771
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:15,226
Cut! Cut! Can you do something
about the goddamn smoke?

772
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:17,026
Cut!

773
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:22,195
Can you do something
about the damn smoke?

774
00:49:22,372 --> 00:49:24,863
This is the trouble
with shooting on location...

775
00:49:25,042 --> 00:49:29,035
...although it's worth it
for the authenticity.

776
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:31,204
Well, it looks authentic.

777
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:32,871
Hey, Tony!

778
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,039
Tony.

779
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:36,686
Anthony Bella, Nicky Caesar.

780
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:40,981
- This is Paul Vitti.
- You don't have to tell me who he is.

781
00:49:41,158 --> 00:49:43,888
- It's a pleasure to meet you, mate.
- Hey, mate.

782
00:49:44,061 --> 00:49:46,393
I don't believe this. An English guy.

783
00:49:46,563 --> 00:49:49,191
- You ain't even Italian.
- Australian-Italian.

784
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:53,234
- There's a lot of paisans down under.
- Down under what?

785
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,039
- You like to laugh, don't you?
- It's a nervous defense mechanism.

786
00:50:04,214 --> 00:50:07,240
I don't have to do it if it bothers you.
So I'll just...

787
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:09,180
So, Paul, are you gonna join us?

788
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,254
I'm thinking I might.
I like the whole setup here.

789
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:16,586
Sensational, mate. I can't wait to work
with you. I got a lot of questions for you.

790
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,557
- All right, mate.
- All right.

791
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:21,289
- Can we get this fucking shot?
- Yes, yes.

792
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:25,367
Paul, thank you. And welcome.

793
00:50:25,535 --> 00:50:27,469
Welcome aboard.

794
00:50:27,638 --> 00:50:29,105
Couple of things.

795
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:31,764
I don't know who makes these decisions...

796
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:34,536
...but there are things that
I see that don't look right.

797
00:50:34,711 --> 00:50:37,874
Yes, I sensed this myself.

798
00:50:38,048 --> 00:50:40,608
Which elements strike you as wrong?

799
00:50:40,784 --> 00:50:44,049
Well, the people, mainly. I mean,
you got a boss who speaks Australian.

800
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:47,315
- What the fuck is that about?
- Not my first choice.

801
00:50:48,058 --> 00:50:51,221
- And your background is what?
- Theater, mostly.

802
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:54,296
That figures. I got some people
I could bring around...

803
00:50:54,464 --> 00:50:57,160
...that will add a certain authenticity
to the whole thing.

804
00:50:57,334 --> 00:51:00,667
I would be eternally grateful
to you if you could.

805
00:51:00,837 --> 00:51:03,806
Is there anything else that you would need?

806
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:06,839
I'd like one of those trailers
like the stars got.

807
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:11,447
Done! Done! I am gonna go
put that in the works right now.

808
00:51:11,615 --> 00:51:13,446
Right.

809
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:15,676
Brian!

810
00:51:16,386 --> 00:51:20,322
- Hey, Paul. You really gonna do this?
- Yeah, I'm really gonna do this.

811
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:24,426
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm going nuts already with this job thing.

812
00:51:24,594 --> 00:51:27,256
In a week, I'll fucking kill
this Raoul or I'll kill myself.

813
00:51:27,431 --> 00:51:32,130
This is just a good cover till I figure out
what I'm gonna do. But call the guys.

814
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:01,089
- You know, there's a line here.
- Yeah, it's in back of me.

815
00:52:01,264 --> 00:52:03,323
Take the chicken and the two pastas.

816
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,367
You must be a teamster.
Youse don't stop eating.

817
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:15,875
"Tell me why I'd give a shit
about your wife's cousin?"

818
00:52:16,646 --> 00:52:19,843
- No, no good.
- It's not good?

819
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:28,618
What about this line? "Stevie Wonder
sees more shit than you do!"

820
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:31,226
- No. Never.
- It's not good?

821
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:32,384
Never.

822
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:43,935
"How much does the chosen snitch
want for this?"

823
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:46,798
- No?
- No.

824
00:52:46,977 --> 00:52:48,205
- It's no good.
- No good.

825
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:50,005
Jesus.

826
00:52:50,747 --> 00:52:54,581
That's it. That's...
That's the end of the scene.

827
00:52:56,586 --> 00:53:00,044
- There's no dialogue in the scene.
- You're better off.

828
00:53:13,603 --> 00:53:15,571
Get in the car.

829
00:53:16,339 --> 00:53:18,739
- We going to the prom?
- Shut up and get in the car.

830
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:20,501
I know.

831
00:53:26,983 --> 00:53:28,712
Sit down.

832
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:31,047
Careful. The eggs are on the bottom.

833
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:33,121
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

834
00:53:38,995 --> 00:53:41,930
You the shrink taking care of Paul Vitti?

835
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:44,329
- Yes, I am.
- So is he nuts, or what?

836
00:53:44,901 --> 00:53:47,563
I'm sorry, I don't discuss
my patients' cases with anyone.

837
00:53:47,737 --> 00:53:48,965
Discuss it.

838
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:53,439
He's suffering from a chronic anxiety,
and...

839
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,475
And what?

840
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:59,180
Antisocial personality disorder.

841
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:00,646
Sociopathy.

842
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:03,843
I'm getting a fucking headache here.
What are you trying to say?

843
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:06,419
He has a criminal temperament.

844
00:54:08,091 --> 00:54:10,355
He's a criminal?

845
00:54:11,094 --> 00:54:13,756
This is news?

846
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:16,626
And for that you need a doctor degree?

847
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:18,993
What do you do for him?

848
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:22,769
I try to get him to see
the possibility of change.

849
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:24,566
Wrong.

850
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:27,835
You do not want him to change.

851
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:31,180
That's Mrs. LoPresti.

852
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:32,508
Patti.

853
00:54:32,682 --> 00:54:35,515
Patti, I'm Ben Sobel.

854
00:54:36,386 --> 00:54:39,082
Paul Vitti is very important to this family.

855
00:54:39,256 --> 00:54:41,724
We don't want to see you
turning him into a stromboni.

856
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:46,093
Stromboni? The thing they clean
the ice with at the hockey games?

857
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:49,323
That's a Zamboni, asshole. Stromboni.

858
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:51,626
It's a bull with his balls cut off.

859
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:59,497
- No, we don't want to see that happen.
- Not unless you want to be one too.

860
00:54:59,676 --> 00:55:02,770
No, I'm very attached to my balls.

861
00:55:02,946 --> 00:55:05,437
As you can probably tell.

862
00:55:09,486 --> 00:55:12,080
Then do the right thing. Understand?

863
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:14,746
Yes. Yes, I do.

864
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:20,356
Goodbye.

865
00:55:24,668 --> 00:55:26,863
No hard feelings.

866
00:55:27,037 --> 00:55:31,030
No, and probably never again.

867
00:55:32,509 --> 00:55:36,912
We're gonna need a grapple or a crane.
Fifty-foot boom, at least.

868
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,878
I seen one in Bayonne, but I'll call around.

869
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,483
All right, see what you can do.

870
00:55:41,651 --> 00:55:44,586
And we're gonna need a city bus.
Anybody got ideas about that?

871
00:55:44,754 --> 00:55:48,121
I got a guy in the Transit Authority.
He owes me big.

872
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:51,727
- Let me know when you want me to call.
- Hello, Paul.

873
00:55:53,263 --> 00:55:55,493
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hi, guys. How are you?

874
00:55:55,665 --> 00:55:59,066
- Patti, how you doing?
- Good. I guess everyone's gone Hollywood.

875
00:55:59,236 --> 00:56:02,137
Excuse me. This is a closed set.
We're about to start shooting.

876
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:05,763
Yeah? So am I. Let's walk. Come on.

877
00:56:05,942 --> 00:56:10,038
- I heard you had some more trouble.
- Yeah, Lou the Wrench took a shot at me.

878
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:13,979
I don't have to tell you, Paul. Alone on
the streets, you don't stand a chance.

879
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:16,050
That's what the family is all about.

880
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:18,813
Since the old days when
the grandfathers first came over.

881
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:20,820
It's not something you walk away from.

882
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,186
When you're a Jet,
you're a Jet all the way.

883
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,022
- What?
- Nothing.

884
00:56:26,196 --> 00:56:27,925
So you wanna tell me what's going on?

885
00:56:28,098 --> 00:56:30,191
I see you have your whole crew
back together.

886
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:32,335
Nothing's going on. They're actors now.

887
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:33,935
Don't bullshit me, Paul.

888
00:56:34,104 --> 00:56:36,937
I know you're planning something,
and I'm feeling left out.

889
00:56:39,175 --> 00:56:42,804
All right. All right, I'll tell you.
Something's going down.

890
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:45,178
You'll get your end.

891
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:47,839
Just let us do what we gotta do.
It'll be fine.

892
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:49,679
Okay?

893
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,351
You're a good friend. I would never
insist on something like this...

894
00:56:53,523 --> 00:56:56,924
...but I'd feel better if you'd bring Eddie
and a couple of my guys in...

895
00:56:57,093 --> 00:56:58,856
...you know, to help you with the job.

896
00:56:59,029 --> 00:57:00,257
Eddie "Yeah, what?"

897
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,489
- He's a good man.
- He's a fucking jerk-off.

898
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,634
He's young. He's got a lot to learn.

899
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:08,293
What is this, crime school?
This is a serious thing we're doing here.

900
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:11,338
Check him out. Talk to Frankie Brush.
Talk to Jackie the Jew.

901
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:14,375
He's worked jobs with them before.
They'll vouch for him.

902
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:16,171
Paul, please. For me.

903
00:57:16,346 --> 00:57:20,476
He does what I tell him, stays out of the
way, and he keeps his fucking mouth shut.

904
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:23,881
All right. Fine. Thanks, Paul.
I really appreciate this.

905
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:27,285
Oh, God. Dear God.

906
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:29,652
Look, sweetheart...

907
00:57:29,826 --> 00:57:32,090
Sweetheart, first of all...

908
00:57:32,262 --> 00:57:35,629
...we're not shooting the hooker scene
until tomorrow.

909
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:42,034
And the hair, please, what is it?
Something from the cliche store?

910
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:44,833
Raoul. This is a friend of mine.

911
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:48,239
Patti. This is Patti Lo. This is Raoul.

912
00:57:48,411 --> 00:57:50,470
Patti Lo...?

913
00:57:51,147 --> 00:57:53,615
Patti LoPresti?

914
00:57:53,783 --> 00:57:57,514
I am so very, very sorry.

915
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:01,750
How dare you not inform me
that Mrs. LoPresti is on the set today!

916
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:05,452
You are fired! Get out!

917
00:58:06,096 --> 00:58:09,930
That is why I'm...
Please, enjoy your visit with us.

918
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,898
And if there is anything at all
that I can do...

919
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:14,696
Go fuck yourself.

920
00:58:14,871 --> 00:58:18,671
Immediately. Immediately.

921
00:58:19,743 --> 00:58:21,734
He's from the theater.

922
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:41,157
- Should I wait here, Mr. Rigazzi?
- No, pull the car up your ass and wait there.

923
00:58:56,179 --> 00:58:57,874
Get over your hurt feelings, okay?

924
00:58:58,047 --> 00:59:00,743
Tell me. Was she angry?
Am I in danger?

925
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:05,513
Don't worry about it. I just wouldn't start
my car for a couple of weeks if I were you.

926
00:59:05,688 --> 00:59:07,588
I'll have Brian do it. He's new.

927
00:59:07,757 --> 00:59:09,418
Hey, Paul.

928
00:59:09,692 --> 00:59:11,091
Hey, Lou.

929
00:59:11,261 --> 00:59:13,752
This is Lou Rigazzi, Lou the Wrench.

930
00:59:14,564 --> 00:59:16,088
The Wrench?

931
00:59:16,733 --> 00:59:18,200
Brian? Sorry.

932
00:59:18,368 --> 00:59:19,596
Start my car!

933
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:21,066
Now!

934
00:59:21,237 --> 00:59:23,205
Come on, I wanna talk to you.

935
00:59:23,373 --> 00:59:26,308
The guy who shot at you,
he was acting on his own.

936
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:28,535
- I never gave the order.
- Yeah?

937
00:59:28,711 --> 00:59:31,475
He's been taken care of.
There won't be another incident.

938
00:59:31,648 --> 00:59:34,378
Unless you're thinking
of working for Patti Lo.

939
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:35,745
Me? No.

940
00:59:35,919 --> 00:59:38,615
Good. Then I got no beef with you.

941
00:59:38,788 --> 00:59:40,278
Good, I can sleep better.

942
00:59:40,457 --> 00:59:43,517
Let me tell you,
because that's not the way to go.

943
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:46,958
You wanna back a winner,
which is gonna be me, okay?

944
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,961
It only makes sense.

945
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:52,158
So you come work for me.
I'll treat you right.

946
00:59:52,735 --> 00:59:54,100
No, thanks.

947
00:59:55,738 --> 00:59:57,501
So much for sleeping better.

948
00:59:58,975 --> 01:00:00,840
You be careful.

949
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:06,543
Listen, Jelly, you just pick numbers.

950
01:00:06,716 --> 01:00:09,207
- You know why? It's an open race.
- Jelly.

951
01:00:09,385 --> 01:00:12,047
- Hey, doc! How you doing?
- How you doing?

952
01:00:12,222 --> 01:00:13,655
How are you?
How are you, Yo-Yo?

953
01:00:13,823 --> 01:00:14,915
Mo-Mo.

954
01:00:15,091 --> 01:00:18,060
Mo-Mo, right. I was thinking of the cellist.

955
01:00:18,228 --> 01:00:19,923
Jelly, where's Paul?

956
01:00:20,096 --> 01:00:21,961
He's in his camper.

957
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:24,994
Yeah.

958
01:00:25,969 --> 01:00:27,493
Doc, what are you doing here?

959
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:30,036
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

960
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:34,165
I came to tell you that you had a meeting
with your parole officer, and who do I see?

961
01:00:34,344 --> 01:00:35,538
Patti LoPresti!

962
01:00:36,246 --> 01:00:37,235
Patti who?

963
01:00:37,413 --> 01:00:39,472
Stop lying to me. Your whole gang is here.

964
01:00:39,649 --> 01:00:43,608
Who says I'm lying? I finally get a straight
job, I start getting my life together...

965
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:46,812
...and you start accusing me?
That's how much you trust me?

966
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:50,926
Paul, it's not that I don't trust you.
It's just that I don't trust you.

967
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:52,925
This is what's so hard
about being an ex-con.

968
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:55,587
You make one mistake
and nobody lets you forget it.

969
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:58,598
So now you're the victim?
Paul, I want the truth.

970
01:00:58,768 --> 01:01:00,395
Wait a second.

971
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,003
- Say that again.
- Say what?

972
01:01:02,171 --> 01:01:04,662
- What you just said. "I want the truth."
- I want the truth.

973
01:01:04,841 --> 01:01:07,401
- No, strong, like before.
- Paul, I want the truth!

974
01:01:07,577 --> 01:01:09,067
That's it. That's good.

975
01:01:09,245 --> 01:01:11,076
- What?
- I'm serious, that had power.

976
01:01:11,247 --> 01:01:14,580
- I believed you. You could be an actor.
- Paul, I am not an actor.

977
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:16,514
You're better than the bums here.

978
01:01:16,686 --> 01:01:19,883
- There's this part you could do.
- I can't. We have this meeting.

979
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:23,753
We're shooting now. There's this part,
you could do it. I'm telling you, it's you.

980
01:01:24,193 --> 01:01:27,356
I did do Music Man in high school.
People thought I was quite good.

981
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,862
Jelly, what are you...?

982
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:32,331
Help! Help!

983
01:01:32,502 --> 01:01:34,265
Hey, help me!

984
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:36,428
I don't wanna do this!

985
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:41,270
- Does that screaming sound real to you?
- Yeah, that sounds pretty real to me.

986
01:01:41,678 --> 01:01:45,944
That was not funny at all. There was
no harness. They could've dropped me.

987
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:48,146
If you didn't wanna do it,
you should've said.

988
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:51,651
You said a scene on the roof.
I didn't know they would throw me off.

989
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:54,847
They didn't throw you off.
They hung you over the side. That's it.

990
01:01:55,024 --> 01:01:58,152
I know what you're doing.
You're upset that I have custody of you...

991
01:01:58,328 --> 01:02:00,990
...so you passive-aggressively
make me look like a fool.

992
01:02:01,164 --> 01:02:04,622
Come on. You were great.
You were great.

993
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:07,133
Second take, I thought,
was better than the first.

994
01:02:07,303 --> 01:02:09,703
Jelly wasn't giving me much, honestly.
So I...

995
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,477
Screw you, Paul.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. That's it. Okay.

996
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:17,943
- What are you doing, self-medicating again?
- No.

997
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:20,514
Don't give me that decongestant,
multivitamin shit.

998
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:24,016
- Come on, what are you doing?
- Ginkgo biloba. Helps my memory...

999
01:02:24,187 --> 01:02:27,088
...and I forget what else.
But don't worry about me.

1000
01:02:27,256 --> 01:02:29,747
Worry about what you're gonna say
to this parole officer.

1001
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:32,827
I mean, what are you gonna tell him?
That you left my house?

1002
01:02:32,996 --> 01:02:36,762
That you got your gang back together?
And for what? A high-school dropout reunion?

1003
01:02:36,933 --> 01:02:39,265
- You recognize that car?
- Which car?

1004
01:02:39,435 --> 01:02:41,903
The one that's been following us
for the last few miles.

1005
01:02:42,071 --> 01:02:46,337
That? Oh, yeah. I know that car. That's a
Mercedes S500. That is one sweet machine.

1006
01:02:46,509 --> 01:02:48,841
It's an eight bore.
It comes in a 12, which is a beast.

1007
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:50,001
- Lose them.
- What?

1008
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:51,168
- Lose them.
- What?

1009
01:02:51,347 --> 01:02:53,338
- Lose them!
- Lose that car? You can't...

1010
01:03:01,257 --> 01:03:03,953
I'm gonna stop, Paul.
This could be the FBI.

1011
01:03:04,127 --> 01:03:06,960
The FBI is two cars back.
You gotta be more observant. Left.

1012
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:15,403
I'm pulling over.
They won't shoot us. It's daylight.

1013
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:18,404
Broad daylight is the best time.
They can see better. Right!

1014
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:48,561
We gotta stop. This is a lease.

1015
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:50,838
Hey, it's a goddamn lease!

1016
01:03:51,474 --> 01:03:53,465
- Move over. I'll drive.
- Move over where?

1017
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:55,770
- Get in the back seat. Back seat!
- Damn seat belt.

1018
01:03:55,945 --> 01:03:58,072
Get over!

1019
01:04:07,256 --> 01:04:09,417
- Buckle up, doc.
- It's gonna get worse?

1020
01:04:09,592 --> 01:04:11,753
It ain't gonna get better.

1021
01:04:19,402 --> 01:04:20,664
Stop it!

1022
01:04:47,396 --> 01:04:48,795
Oh, my God.

1023
01:04:48,965 --> 01:04:50,227
You think they'll get out?

1024
01:04:50,399 --> 01:04:54,733
Yeah, that's James Bond and that
Sea Hunt guy, so they got a good shot.

1025
01:04:56,439 --> 01:04:59,772
- I feel bad. Where are you going?
- I gotta take care of this.

1026
01:04:59,942 --> 01:05:02,536
- Paul, your parole officer...
- Send him my regards.

1027
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:06,011
- Paul, I'm warning you. If you leave now...
- So long, doc.

1028
01:05:06,182 --> 01:05:10,676
That's it. You're on your own now, pal.
That's it. I'm done.

1029
01:05:10,853 --> 01:05:12,480
I'm...

1030
01:05:12,655 --> 01:05:13,644
...screwed.

1031
01:05:27,336 --> 01:05:29,497
So where is he, doctor?

1032
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:30,900
I wish I knew.

1033
01:05:31,073 --> 01:05:36,602
Considering I released him into your custody,
that's not quite the answer I was looking for.

1034
01:05:38,014 --> 01:05:40,915
He's got something in the works.
Care to tell me what you know?

1035
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,914
I don't know anything.

1036
01:05:43,085 --> 01:05:45,519
I really feel he's making
an effort to go straight.

1037
01:05:45,688 --> 01:05:46,677
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

1038
01:05:46,856 --> 01:05:50,053
That's why we got two corpses
in the bottom of the river?

1039
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:52,124
Here.

1040
01:05:52,295 --> 01:05:54,092
Vitti with Sal Masiello.

1041
01:05:54,263 --> 01:05:57,164
Vitti with Patti LoPresti.
Vitti with Eddie DeVol.

1042
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:59,927
Let me know.
I can order you some wallet-size.

1043
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:04,296
I am giving you 24 hours
to find him and deliver him to me.

1044
01:06:04,473 --> 01:06:08,773
Otherwise, you're looking at obstruction
of justice and accessory to manslaughter.

1045
01:06:11,714 --> 01:06:13,978
- Can I go?
- Sure, but you can't take your car.

1046
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:16,311
We're impounding it as evidence.

1047
01:06:16,485 --> 01:06:19,943
- Can I get a ride?
- Have a nice day.

1048
01:06:22,758 --> 01:06:24,350
I don't got a lot of time.

1049
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:28,395
They're probably gonna come looking for me,
so we'll go over everything at the club.

1050
01:06:28,564 --> 01:06:33,695
Paul, not that I'm questioning or anything,
but what do we need with this Eddie DeVol?

1051
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:36,464
The guy is like a petty larceny scumbag.

1052
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:40,473
Hey, I ain't happy about it either.
But if he keeps Patti off my back, so be it.

1053
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:44,742
- Yeah?
- Mr. Vitti?

1054
01:06:45,514 --> 01:06:48,540
- Mr. Bella asked to meet you in makeup.
- Can't. Gotta go.

1055
01:06:48,718 --> 01:06:50,948
- It's important.
- I'll talk to him tomorrow.

1056
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,988
Here, here.
Tell him you never saw me, okay?

1057
01:06:58,594 --> 01:07:02,086
- Paul, excellent, mate. Come here, please.
- I can't talk right now, mate.

1058
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:04,733
I've gotta ask you a question.
Two seconds? Come on.

1059
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:06,232
- I gotta...
- Come on.

1060
01:07:06,402 --> 01:07:08,597
- Can we do it later?
- Please. It's important.

1061
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:13,504
Paul, I'm looking for something to do when
my character finds out he's being indicted.

1062
01:07:13,676 --> 01:07:16,110
And I was thinking of punching the wall.

1063
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:20,079
But I did that when they killed Uncle Lenny,
and I punched a car...

1064
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:24,549
...actually, it was a van, when Peezee
screwed up the big drug-deal.

1065
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,679
So I'm looking
for something different this time.

1066
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:31,656
Something that doesn't involve,
you know, punching anything.

1067
01:07:31,827 --> 01:07:34,591
Kick something. Let me know
how it works out. I gotta go.

1068
01:07:34,764 --> 01:07:37,232
Paul, wait.
That's really interesting.

1069
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,798
- Kick what?
- I don't know. Like, kick a guy in the face.

1070
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:43,165
- Who?
- Anybody, just some guy.

1071
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:46,399
Knock him down, give him a
couple shots in the head and walk away.

1072
01:07:46,575 --> 01:07:48,065
- Why?
- Why not?

1073
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:50,906
You're pissed, he's there.
I got friends waiting for me.

1074
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:54,140
My character wouldn't do that.
What else you got?

1075
01:07:54,317 --> 01:07:56,911
- I don't know. You could yell real loud.
- Yell real loud?

1076
01:07:57,086 --> 01:07:58,485
That's really original.

1077
01:07:58,654 --> 01:08:01,214
Shut your fucking mouth.
I don't care what you do. I gotta go.

1078
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:05,622
Shut your fucking mouth.
I don't care what you do. I gotta go.

1079
01:08:05,795 --> 01:08:08,355
- What'd you say?
- What'd you say?

1080
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:10,999
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Wait. What are you doing?

1081
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:15,035
- You can cut that shit out right now.
- You can cut that shit out right now.

1082
01:08:20,476 --> 01:08:22,205
That was bloody great!

1083
01:08:22,912 --> 01:08:25,472
My character could do that.

1084
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,317
Thank you.

1085
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:39,921
Jelly? Where's Paul?

1086
01:08:41,063 --> 01:08:43,725
Michael. What are you doing?

1087
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:47,027
I'm working for Mr. Vitti.
Yeah, I'm his driver now.

1088
01:08:47,203 --> 01:08:50,639
Oh, no. No. No. No, Michael,
you are not doing that. Sorry.

1089
01:08:50,806 --> 01:08:54,242
- You keep telling me to get a job.
- Making sandwiches at the Subway...

1090
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:55,741
...not driving a getaway car.

1091
01:08:55,911 --> 01:08:56,900
Dad.

1092
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:00,742
No "Dad" about this. He should have
spoken to me before he spoke to you.

1093
01:09:00,916 --> 01:09:02,508
All right. Where is he?

1094
01:09:02,685 --> 01:09:04,880
I cannot give you that information.

1095
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:08,114
You cannot give me that information?

1096
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:12,624
Look, I promised not to repeat anything
I heard in the car, okay? I took an oath.

1097
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:15,491
You took an oath?
Was there blood involved?

1098
01:09:16,232 --> 01:09:17,631
Ben?

1099
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,496
What...? What happened? Where were you?

1100
01:09:20,669 --> 01:09:23,797
I'll tell you the truth. I was involved
in a high-speed car chase.

1101
01:09:23,973 --> 01:09:25,736
- What?
- My car was totally shot out...

1102
01:09:25,908 --> 01:09:28,741
...and the men who were
chasing us probably drowned.

1103
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:31,311
- Oh, my God!
- It's not as bad as it sounds.

1104
01:09:31,847 --> 01:09:34,941
- When is this all gonna end?
- Tonight. I just have to find him.

1105
01:09:35,117 --> 01:09:38,143
Why? A few days ago you weren't even
sure you wanted to be a therapist.

1106
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:42,848
Honey, I have to finish this.
I have to. Understand?

1107
01:09:45,127 --> 01:09:46,151
Go.

1108
01:09:46,328 --> 01:09:48,853
- Go. Just don't get shot.
- Okay.

1109
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:50,089
- Please.
- All right.

1110
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:53,326
- Hey, Clemenza. Where is he?
- I can't.

1111
01:09:53,502 --> 01:09:55,333
You are gonna tell your father...

1112
01:09:55,504 --> 01:09:58,439
...or so help me God, I'll kick
the ever-Ioving shit out of you.

1113
01:09:58,607 --> 01:10:01,667
Little Darlings, okay? It's a club in Queens.

1114
01:10:01,844 --> 01:10:04,938
- Give me the keys to the car.
- I'm responsible for the Town Car.

1115
01:10:05,114 --> 01:10:07,241
- Give me the fucking keys!
- Take my car.

1116
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:08,405
- Okay.
- Here.

1117
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:10,677
Thank you. Bye.

1118
01:10:35,044 --> 01:10:36,807
Hi.

1119
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:41,909
Excuse me.

1120
01:10:42,084 --> 01:10:43,813
Excuse me.

1121
01:10:43,986 --> 01:10:45,214
Jelly.

1122
01:10:45,387 --> 01:10:48,914
- Hey, doc, what are you doing here?
- Where's Paul?

1123
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:52,089
- I think she likes you.
- I have to talk to Paul.

1124
01:10:52,261 --> 01:10:54,923
Man, give her a few dollars.

1125
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,300
Hi. I only have a 20,
so could I get change?

1126
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:06,931
Ten, five, singles would be great.
Thank you.

1127
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,738
Okay.

1128
01:11:12,915 --> 01:11:16,351
Thank you very much for giving me this.

1129
01:11:18,687 --> 01:11:19,984
Thank you.

1130
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:26,561
Listen, this is my meter money,
I don't have any more bills, so...

1131
01:11:32,134 --> 01:11:33,795
Where's Jelly?

1132
01:11:41,544 --> 01:11:42,670
What are you doing?

1133
01:11:42,845 --> 01:11:46,212
What do you mean? Blowing off
a little steam. What's the big deal?

1134
01:11:46,382 --> 01:11:47,406
Here he is.

1135
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,983
- How's it going, Paulie?
- It's going all right.

1136
01:11:51,153 --> 01:11:53,485
You know my guys?
Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino?

1137
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:55,748
Al Pacino? That's your real name?

1138
01:11:55,925 --> 01:12:00,259
No. They call me that
because I look like Al Pacino.

1139
01:12:00,429 --> 01:12:03,421
- The actor.
- Anybody ever call you Carol Burnett?

1140
01:12:03,599 --> 01:12:04,588
Why?

1141
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:09,101
Because you look as much like
Carol Burnett as you do Al Pacino.

1142
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:14,307
- What are you looking at?
- I actually see it.

1143
01:12:14,476 --> 01:12:18,640
It's, like, right through here,
it's just very much Pacino.

1144
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:24,082
So we're all here?

1145
01:12:24,653 --> 01:12:27,281
- We're all here.
- Then let's do this, all right?

1146
01:12:27,456 --> 01:12:29,549
- Let's do what?
- Let's go.

1147
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:31,317
- Let's do what?
- Let's go.

1148
01:12:32,595 --> 01:12:34,062
You're not telling me something.

1149
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:37,165
You're not telling me something.
I want to know what's going on.

1150
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:40,928
- I'm not leaving till you tell me...
- Get out of here. You're gonna get hurt.

1151
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:06,288
Okay, this is big.

1152
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:10,455
We only got one shot, and there's a million
ways this fucking thing can go wrong...

1153
01:13:10,633 --> 01:13:12,726
...so everybody listen carefully.

1154
01:13:14,236 --> 01:13:17,899
The Federal Gold Depository
in downtown Manhattan.

1155
01:13:18,073 --> 01:13:23,306
Three times a year, a shipment of Gold bars
Goes in a heavily Guarded armored truck...

1156
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:26,607
...from the depository to a vault
in the Federal Reserve...

1157
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:31,310
...to hold for foreiGn Governments
that trade in Gold bullion.

1158
01:13:32,121 --> 01:13:35,921
Three o'clock in the morninG,
about eiGht hours from now...

1159
01:13:36,091 --> 01:13:38,889
...we're gonna hijack that truck.

1160
01:13:39,528 --> 01:13:43,089
All right, everybody look at the map.
This is where we're gonna be.

1161
01:13:50,873 --> 01:13:54,832
- What the fuck is this?
- He was listening by the door.

1162
01:13:56,111 --> 01:13:58,102
- Hi, guys.
- Get rid of him.

1163
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,407
- Hi, Carol.
- You're a dead man, asshole.

1164
01:14:00,582 --> 01:14:03,449
Put the gun down.
Put the fucking gun down!

1165
01:14:03,619 --> 01:14:05,450
Put the fucking gun down, okay?

1166
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:07,418
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

1167
01:14:07,589 --> 01:14:11,081
- He can make every guy in this room.
- Keep your hands off him. He's with me.

1168
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,524
Yeah? What, on the job?

1169
01:14:13,696 --> 01:14:17,530
- Gonna start that "yeah, what?" shit again?
- Either he's in or he's dead. Which is it?

1170
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,635
I think in is better.
If I had a vote, I would vote in.

1171
01:14:22,304 --> 01:14:25,899
- He's in. He's my responsibility.
- Okay.

1172
01:14:26,075 --> 01:14:30,478
No more surprises. And from this
moment on, no one leaves my sight.

1173
01:14:30,646 --> 01:14:31,635
Got it?

1174
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:34,173
Here, try this on.

1175
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,750
- Is this bulletproof?
- You better hope so.

1176
01:14:36,919 --> 01:14:38,648
See if it fits under your shirt.

1177
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:41,816
I could fit you under my shirt.
Got anything smaller?

1178
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:43,719
What are we, a Bloomingdale's?

1179
01:14:43,892 --> 01:14:47,919
Hey, nobody knew you were coming down.
You're lucky to be alive, you know.

1180
01:14:48,097 --> 01:14:52,363
We're all gonna be lucky to be alive.
This plan is crazy. It's stupid.

1181
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:54,229
Hey, hey, watch it.

1182
01:14:54,403 --> 01:14:57,531
Crazy, but not stupid.
You wanna stay alive?

1183
01:14:57,706 --> 01:15:02,871
You do everything I tell you, keep your
mouth shut, and try not to pee your pants.

1184
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:05,504
- Can you handle an M-16?
- You mean shoot it?

1185
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:08,479
No, twirl it like a fucking baton.

1186
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:09,674
- AK?
- No.

1187
01:15:10,185 --> 01:15:11,948
- Kalashnikov?
- Jelly.

1188
01:15:12,121 --> 01:15:16,319
- Stop me when something hits your fancy.
- Well, can't I just use that?

1189
01:15:17,626 --> 01:15:21,528
Yeah. This brings back fond memories.

1190
01:15:24,633 --> 01:15:27,466
- Use it in good health.
- Thanks.

1191
01:15:29,138 --> 01:15:30,833
Great.

1192
01:15:34,943 --> 01:15:37,537
Cold. Cold.

1193
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:44,550
- Check everything in there.
- Talk to the doc, I think he's caving in.

1194
01:15:55,664 --> 01:15:57,825
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

1195
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,298
I'll try to get you out before
the shit goes down.

1196
01:16:00,469 --> 01:16:02,664
- Just don't flip out on me, okay?
- Right.

1197
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:45,772
Here they come.

1198
01:16:46,381 --> 01:16:47,973
Big, big mistake.

1199
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:50,243
- They're here.
- Go. Go! Go! Go!

1200
01:17:01,363 --> 01:17:03,126
Are you fucking kidding me?

1201
01:17:03,298 --> 01:17:05,630
Move the truck!

1202
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:08,527
Where you going?

1203
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,032
It's a setup!

1204
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:17,807
Everybody get down, watch the walls!
Watch the walls and the gates!

1205
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:29,452
On my command,
get the drivers back in the trucks.

1206
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:32,093
You're gonna take the rear.
I'm gonna take the point.

1207
01:17:32,261 --> 01:17:34,320
We're gonna back
these fuckers out of here.

1208
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:38,859
- What the fuck?
- They're lifting the truck!

1209
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:41,662
They're lifting the fucking truck!

1210
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:44,365
Son of a bitch!

1211
01:17:49,645 --> 01:17:51,010
Hold on!

1212
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:53,943
Hold on, Harold! Hold on!

1213
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:56,080
Going over.

1214
01:17:57,452 --> 01:17:59,818
You have got to be fucking kidding me!

1215
01:18:01,857 --> 01:18:02,846
Hang on!

1216
01:18:16,672 --> 01:18:20,802
- It's not too late. You don't have to do this.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1217
01:18:28,283 --> 01:18:31,480
What a day for my balls.

1218
01:18:33,188 --> 01:18:35,622
Open the fucking door.

1219
01:18:38,193 --> 01:18:40,787
- Where's the keys?
- We don't have the keys.

1220
01:18:40,963 --> 01:18:43,090
They've got the keys at the bank.

1221
01:18:43,265 --> 01:18:45,256
Keep your fucking head down.

1222
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:46,867
Get over here!

1223
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:51,136
Move. Get the fuck in there.

1224
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:54,165
Here we go.

1225
01:18:55,944 --> 01:18:59,141
Take the gate. You guys take the gate.
Get the wall. Climb the wall.

1226
01:19:03,585 --> 01:19:05,485
On the wall, guys. Get up on the wall!

1227
01:19:07,022 --> 01:19:09,047
Get the gate! Move. Move. Move.

1228
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:10,452
Break through the gate.

1229
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:21,397
Get the ramp.

1230
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:24,164
You know, this might just fucking work.

1231
01:19:24,339 --> 01:19:27,308
Go! Go! Go! Get over the wall.
Come on.

1232
01:19:29,611 --> 01:19:33,274
10-13, shots fired.
Need some backup.

1233
01:19:33,882 --> 01:19:36,350
10-13, shots fired. Shots fired.

1234
01:19:36,518 --> 01:19:39,180
Move! Move! Move! Over the wall!

1235
01:19:39,354 --> 01:19:43,484
- Get over the goddamn wall!
- You get over the fucking wall!

1236
01:19:50,265 --> 01:19:52,756
Fifty bars. Fifty bars is all we need.
Fifty bars.

1237
01:19:52,934 --> 01:19:54,026
- Let's go.
- How much is that?

1238
01:19:54,202 --> 01:19:58,639
350 an ounce, 16 ounces to a pound,
90 pounds to a bar. Do the math.

1239
01:19:58,874 --> 01:20:02,605
- 22,995,000.
- What?

1240
01:20:02,778 --> 01:20:04,643
Give or take.

1241
01:20:06,281 --> 01:20:08,408
Hit it again!

1242
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:11,946
They're breaking down the door.

1243
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,380
Bobby, move up the Payloaders.
Move them up.

1244
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:17,286
So much for not peeing in my pants.

1245
01:20:27,869 --> 01:20:29,837
- That's 50.
- All right, pack it up.

1246
01:20:30,005 --> 01:20:31,973
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's get out of here.

1247
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:34,870
We're moving out.
We're moving out.

1248
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:38,711
Paul, remember what you said
about not flipping out?

1249
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,178
- Yeah.
- Sorry. What have I done?

1250
01:20:41,349 --> 01:20:44,512
I had a perfect life,
and I threw it away!

1251
01:20:44,686 --> 01:20:47,382
I'm going to prison. That'll be bad.
I have delicate features.

1252
01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:50,320
- I'm small. I'm gonna be popular.
- You gotta calm down!

1253
01:20:50,492 --> 01:20:53,256
- I can't calm down. I'm gonna die.
- Calm down!

1254
01:20:53,428 --> 01:20:55,862
- I can't breathe! I'm suffocating!
- Listen. Relax.

1255
01:20:56,031 --> 01:20:58,727
- Get a hold of yourself!
- I can't! We're gonna die!

1256
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:01,664
- We're not gonna die.
- We are! We're all gonna die!

1257
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,068
- You feel better now?
- This is all my fault.

1258
01:21:08,243 --> 01:21:11,371
I wanted to be there for you.
I really wanted to help you.

1259
01:21:11,546 --> 01:21:14,014
I want... But I couldn't
because I'm not good enough.

1260
01:21:14,182 --> 01:21:19,620
Ever since my father died, I lost my way.
I didn't think this would hit me this hard.

1261
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:25,251
But, Paul, now I know how you felt
when your father was killed.

1262
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:26,859
We don't have time for this.

1263
01:21:27,028 --> 01:21:28,427
- But it's...
- I'm telling you.

1264
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,689
- Don't do this.
- It was 10 times worse for you.

1265
01:21:30,866 --> 01:21:33,198
- Don't do this.
- He was killed right in front of you.

1266
01:21:33,368 --> 01:21:35,427
- You were just a little kid.
- Don't go there.

1267
01:21:35,604 --> 01:21:38,038
- But it's so sad.
- Don't go there. I'm telling you...

1268
01:21:38,206 --> 01:21:43,405
- All of his dreams for you died with him.
- There I go. You happy now?

1269
01:21:44,846 --> 01:21:48,612
- He loved you, Paul. He really loved you.
- I know he did, and I loved him too.

1270
01:21:48,784 --> 01:21:52,515
- Loved him too.
- I know. I know.

1271
01:21:53,789 --> 01:21:55,279
Oh, boy, this is bad.

1272
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:00,219
How's the heist going?

1273
01:22:10,438 --> 01:22:13,100
Did you really think
you were gonna live through this?

1274
01:22:16,044 --> 01:22:18,137
- Yeah. I had my hopes.
- Well, nice work.

1275
01:22:18,313 --> 01:22:21,942
- Mr. Rigazzi will be very grateful.
- I thought he worked for Patti LoPresti.

1276
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:25,278
Patti thought so too, but he played
both sides against the middle.

1277
01:22:25,453 --> 01:22:28,752
There's only one side
as far as I'm concerned: mine.

1278
01:22:29,024 --> 01:22:30,958
What did you think?
I was gonna stand by...

1279
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:34,118
...and let some fucking broken-down valise
like you move back in?

1280
01:22:34,563 --> 01:22:35,825
So long, Mr. Vitti.

1281
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:45,503
I can't take it anymore!

1282
01:22:46,441 --> 01:22:49,137
That's what I hate
about you fucking sociopaths!

1283
01:22:49,411 --> 01:22:52,278
You keep changing the rules
to suit yourselves!

1284
01:22:52,447 --> 01:22:55,439
Well, not this time, you antisocial,
misfit piece of shit!

1285
01:22:57,285 --> 01:22:59,378
This time
you fucked with the wrong shrink!

1286
01:22:59,554 --> 01:23:01,852
You want a fresh one?

1287
01:23:05,894 --> 01:23:07,521
This session is over.

1288
01:23:15,503 --> 01:23:18,370
Son of a bitch. Ram it!

1289
01:23:20,408 --> 01:23:22,205
Take them up and leave them there.

1290
01:23:22,644 --> 01:23:25,841
- Nice going. Good plan.
- Shut up.

1291
01:23:26,114 --> 01:23:28,708
- Bye.
- Yeah, what?

1292
01:23:29,184 --> 01:23:31,550
What's a sociopath?

1293
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:32,980
I don't know.

1294
01:23:33,622 --> 01:23:37,490
- Somebody!
- Come on, help us out here.

1295
01:23:40,829 --> 01:23:43,730
Come on! This way! Come on!

1296
01:23:43,899 --> 01:23:47,699
- They're getting away! Come on.
- Let's go!

1297
01:24:03,151 --> 01:24:04,277
Drop your guns!

1298
01:24:06,254 --> 01:24:08,279
Drop your guns!

1299
01:24:08,924 --> 01:24:10,721
Drop your fucking guns!

1300
01:24:12,093 --> 01:24:13,583
Drop your weapons, now!

1301
01:24:14,663 --> 01:24:18,861
- Who the hell is this?
- Cut. Cut. Cut! What the hell is going on?

1302
01:24:19,401 --> 01:24:21,733
Drop your fucking guns. Nobody move!

1303
01:24:21,903 --> 01:24:26,533
Raoul! Look, if you're gonna
change the script, you have to tell us.

1304
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:30,041
Who are these people?
What are they doing in my shot?

1305
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:33,805
- What are you doing on my street?
- I have a permit!

1306
01:24:33,982 --> 01:24:37,110
- Take your permit and stick it up your ass!
- Oh, my friend.

1307
01:24:37,419 --> 01:24:39,580
Release traffic, please. Release traffic.

1308
01:24:41,656 --> 01:24:44,489
This is like a bloody Chinese fire drill...

1309
01:24:46,461 --> 01:24:47,485
Jesus!

1310
01:24:47,662 --> 01:24:51,359
- You are in trouble. You are in trouble!
- You are gonna be in federal prison!

1311
01:24:51,533 --> 01:24:53,467
Prison? You think I'm powerless?

1312
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:56,627
- Enough. I'm going back to my trailer.
- No, you've gotta stay.

1313
01:24:56,805 --> 01:25:01,674
- Move these cars, goddamn you!
- You, please be quiet. I'm trying to think.

1314
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,847
- Is there a problem, officer?
- Keep your hands where I can see them.

1315
01:25:16,658 --> 01:25:19,354
That's it, we're screwed.
We are so screwed.

1316
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,629
You.

1317
01:25:27,869 --> 01:25:29,200
Me?

1318
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:34,699
- You're one tough shrink.
- All right.

1319
01:25:50,592 --> 01:25:53,857
- Feeling pretty good, huh?
- Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.

1320
01:25:54,329 --> 01:25:57,890
What are you thinking?
I mean, what's next?

1321
01:25:58,066 --> 01:26:00,432
Do you go on the run
for the rest of your life?

1322
01:26:00,602 --> 01:26:04,003
Do you just go back to Sing Sing?
Or maybe they find you dead in an alley?

1323
01:26:04,172 --> 01:26:07,573
- How does this work now?
- Those are my choices?

1324
01:26:09,244 --> 01:26:13,613
Hey, doc. Can't you let me enjoy this
for five fucking minutes?

1325
01:26:13,782 --> 01:26:16,478
- Must you always be a fucking killjoy?
- Five minutes?

1326
01:26:16,651 --> 01:26:20,018
- Five minutes.
- Okay. Five minutes.

1327
01:26:21,356 --> 01:26:22,789
- And then what?
- And then what?

1328
01:26:22,957 --> 01:26:26,859
- And then you'll see what.
- I'll see.

1329
01:26:41,509 --> 01:26:46,071
WWEN news time, 8:06.
Seventy-two deGrees.

1330
01:26:46,247 --> 01:26:50,445
A quick resolution to last niGht's
spectacular armored-car hijackinG.

1331
01:26:51,586 --> 01:26:54,680
FBI aGents,
actinG on a tip from an unnamed source...

1332
01:26:54,856 --> 01:26:57,620
...raided the RiGazzi PlumbinG Company

1333

...and recovered the 50 Gold bars
stolen in the darinG robbery.

1334
01:27:02,464 --> 01:27:06,366

1335
01:27:06,534 --> 01:27:10,630
...and 11 other hiGh-rankinG
RiGazzi family associates.

1336
01:27:10,905 --> 01:27:13,772
The rest of the stolen bullion
was recovered at the crime scene...

1337
01:27:13,942 --> 01:27:17,036
...alonG with three hiGh-flyinG hijackers
apparently stranded...

1338
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,874
OrGanized crime
has been dealt a serious blow...

1339
01:27:22,317 --> 01:27:26,583
...and I'm happy to report to the people
of New York and to the entire nation...

1340
01:27:26,754 --> 01:27:31,885
...that this Great city is today
a safer place to live and work.

1341
01:27:32,227 --> 01:27:33,888
Questions?

1342
01:27:44,973 --> 01:27:46,440
Hey, doc.

1343
01:27:46,608 --> 01:27:48,473
- Did you see Patti?
- Yeah. I saw her.

1344
01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:50,372
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah. It's okay.

1345
01:27:50,545 --> 01:27:55,073
- She's glad the Wrench is out of the way.
- Good. Good. I spoke to the U.S. attorney.

1346
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:57,511
- What did he say?
- He's happy about the gold...

1347
01:27:57,685 --> 01:28:01,485
...and he said he won't come after you.
But you gotta stay out of trouble.

1348
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:04,424
Fuck him.

1349
01:28:05,426 --> 01:28:07,360
So one big happy ending, right?

1350
01:28:07,862 --> 01:28:10,990
- You gotta admit you feel better.
- Yeah. I feel better. Sure.

1351
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:13,828
Twenty million down the drain.
Why shouldn't I feel better?

1352
01:28:14,002 --> 01:28:16,835
- You're grieving, Paul. It's a process.
- It's a process, I know.

1353
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:19,803
It's not easy. But you gotta know
you did the right thing.

1354
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:21,538
You too, doc.

1355
01:28:21,709 --> 01:28:24,701
- You hung in there. It took a lot of balls.
- I did what I had to.

1356
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:27,148
You were a monster.
I seen the beast in you.

1357
01:28:27,315 --> 01:28:29,681
- A lot of misplaced aggression, that's all.
- Listen.

1358
01:28:29,851 --> 01:28:32,718
I'm gonna send you after people
that I don't like.

1359
01:28:32,887 --> 01:28:35,515
Give them a little psychology,
then beat them up.

1360
01:28:41,496 --> 01:28:43,020
I wanna thank you, doc.

1361
01:28:44,065 --> 01:28:47,034
- You don't have to thank me, Paul.
- You helped me out a lot.

1362
01:28:49,204 --> 01:28:50,899
You.

1363
01:28:51,573 --> 01:28:53,473
- You're good, you.
- No, I'm okay.

1364
01:28:53,641 --> 01:28:56,508
No, no, no. You're very, very good.

1365
01:28:56,778 --> 01:29:01,545
You got a gift, my friend.
I'm telling you, you got a gift.

1366
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:04,412
All right, I have a gift.

1367
01:29:07,789 --> 01:29:09,450
All right.

1368
01:29:10,525 --> 01:29:12,083
- Okay. Okay, doc.
- Thanks.

1369
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:13,693
- Yeah.
- Take it easy.

1370
01:29:13,861 --> 01:29:16,125
- I'll see you.
- All right.

1371
01:29:22,370 --> 01:29:23,769
Hey, doc.

1372
01:30:35,109 --> 01:30:38,670
When I was a resident, we used to
actually play with the catatonics.

1373
01:30:38,846 --> 01:30:41,781
Just to have a little fun,
it's just so dreary.

1374
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:51,424
Okay, let's just... Okay.

1375
01:30:58,966 --> 01:31:01,799
When I was a resident at Downstate...

1376
01:31:01,969 --> 01:31:05,700
...we used to play with the catatonics,
just for a few laughs.

1377
01:31:08,343 --> 01:31:10,140
Okay.

1378
01:31:16,584 --> 01:31:18,745
I'm not hurting you.

1379
01:31:19,887 --> 01:31:21,616
- Sorry.
- Marker.

1380
01:31:21,789 --> 01:31:23,313
You told her at the drop of a hat.

1381
01:31:23,491 --> 01:31:25,857
She's with the FBI.
She needs this information.

1382
01:31:26,027 --> 01:31:28,723
I see. And I don't need this information.
Okay.

1383
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:33,265
No. No. Why? Why tell Paula?
She couldn't possibly handle a phone call.

1384
01:31:33,434 --> 01:31:34,628
But your name's not Paula.

1385
01:31:34,802 --> 01:31:36,394
- Who am I?
- Laura.

1386
01:31:36,571 --> 01:31:38,232
Okay.

1387
01:31:39,207 --> 01:31:41,038
- Hey, you.
- Coffee?

1388
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:43,677
- What?
- Somebody said something about coffee.

1389
01:31:43,845 --> 01:31:46,040
Yeah. That was you.
You said you wanted some.

1390
01:31:46,214 --> 01:31:47,875
Yeah.

1391
01:31:50,251 --> 01:31:51,513
- "So, what's the holdup?"
- I know.

1392
01:31:51,686 --> 01:31:54,780
I'm taking a long time.
I'm taking my moment.

1393
01:31:55,656 --> 01:31:57,817
You also took mine.

1394
01:31:59,527 --> 01:32:02,621
Here you go. Thank you very much.

1395
01:32:08,836 --> 01:32:11,304
Hey, Michael.

1396
01:32:12,373 --> 01:32:14,068
Jelly.

1397
01:32:14,242 --> 01:32:16,107
Michael!

1398
01:32:16,511 --> 01:32:18,274
If I could only get out of this car!

1399
01:32:18,713 --> 01:32:20,738
Come on. Who would you...?
Who are we kidding?

1400
01:32:20,915 --> 01:32:23,406
- You hated your father.
- I didn't hate my father.

1401
01:32:23,584 --> 01:32:25,882
- No, I loved him.
- You hated your father.

1402
01:32:26,053 --> 01:32:31,116
You hated him. You fucking hated him.
What the fuck we talking about?

1403
01:32:34,896 --> 01:32:39,162
- All right. I got it. I'll stop.
- Good, that was good.

1404
01:32:39,333 --> 01:32:41,893
- "Yeah. I can see how touched you are."
- Yeah, I can see how touched...

1405
01:32:42,069 --> 01:32:43,900
- That's my line.
- That's your line.

1406
01:32:45,106 --> 01:32:47,404
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

1407
01:32:47,575 --> 01:32:50,772
I came here to tell you
that you have a preliminary...

1408
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:52,703
- Come back and try again.
- I will.

1409
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,474
Preliminary meeting. Preliminary meeting.

1410
01:32:55,817 --> 01:32:59,548
You have a preliminary meeting
with your parole officer.

1411
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:01,915
Fuck you. Fuck you. It's "preliminary."

1412
01:33:02,089 --> 01:33:05,217
I'm from the Bronx,
and it's 4:00 in the morning.

1413
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:07,818
Come in.

1414
01:33:09,230 --> 01:33:11,528
Hey, doc, what are you doing here?

1415
01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:14,691
- Preliminary.
- Yeah, preliminary.

1416
01:33:15,903 --> 01:33:17,564
Come in.

1417
01:33:17,839 --> 01:33:19,932
- No.
- All right.

1418
01:33:20,107 --> 01:33:22,041
A marker.

1419
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:24,269
You know who was always
a favorite of mine?

1420
01:33:24,445 --> 01:33:27,107
The late, great Groucho Marx.

1421
01:33:27,381 --> 01:33:30,612
Because he would put stuff on his,
on his...

1422
01:33:30,785 --> 01:33:33,379
He would draw them in on his eyebrows
and then...

1423
01:33:33,554 --> 01:33:37,490
"That's the most ridiculous thing
I've heard." He would do stuff like that.

1424
01:33:37,825 --> 01:33:41,921
Hey, look.
I'm the sheriff of the undersea club.

1425
01:33:42,096 --> 01:33:44,656
Salute me, I'm Captain Midnight.

1426
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:47,360
Ultimately, it's just sad.

1427
01:33:48,536 --> 01:33:52,302
That's what I've been jerking off to
the last 850 nights, a home-cooked meal.

1428
01:33:52,473 --> 01:33:55,465
Yeah, like a nice fucking lamb chop.

1429
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:01,915
A nice home-cooked meal. Like...

1430
01:34:03,251 --> 01:34:06,948
- Let me think of a good one.
- A tuna casserole?

1431
01:34:13,561 --> 01:34:15,153
Help me.

1432
01:34:17,131 --> 01:34:20,362
I just wanted to see it again.

1433
01:34:20,668 --> 01:34:23,831
- We still going?
- We're good? Okay. We'll beat it to death.

1434
01:34:25,406 --> 01:34:29,467
All right. That was great.
I think we can move on.

1435
01:35:37,845 --> 01:35:38,834
