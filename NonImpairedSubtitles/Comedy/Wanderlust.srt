from time to time.

with Marcy. Fuck them.

156
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:11,432
Java chip sounds like
it's going to be a winner.

157
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,725
How's the new place, man?

158
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,645
Oh, terrific. Super small
and really expensive.

159
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,730
Oh, my God,
that does sound good.

160
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,982
Super small and really expensive?
Yeah.

161
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:22,610
Sometimes you can only get one of
those, but you got both of those.

162
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,028
Yeah, it's a deal.
That's great.

163
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,279
How did that happen?

164
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:27,698
I know.

165
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,117
Reason number 25
I'm not married.

166
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,411
Like I need someone telling me
to buy shit I can't afford.

167
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:35,665
It's all about the Benjamins, my friend.
The Benjamins.

168
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:36,791
Yeah.

169
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,125
I'll be one of
those guys who's just

170
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,127
old and ugly,
rich, has a hot wife.

171
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:41,629
Like...

172
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,547
Gollum.
Not Gollum.

173
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:44,715
Georgie!

174
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,551
Come see me for a little chat when
you get upstairs. (CLICKS TONGUE)

175
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,471
All right! You got
the point and the wink.

176
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,056
Boss man likes you.

177
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,849
It just doesn't
fit the HBO brand.

178
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,686
We do violence and
heartache, but it's sexy.

179
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,020
Mmm-hmm.
Do you understand?

180
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:01,023
Of course. What was I thinking?
(LAUGHS)

181
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:02,191
You know what we could do?

182
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,194
We could throw some vampires in there
to have sex with the penguins.

183
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:08,072
And then you could have brooding,
sexy little vampire penguins.

184
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,448
Would that work for your brand?

185
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,993
What if the polar bears
were hookers, and on meth?

186
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,370
And then they show their tits for no reason.
How would that work?

187
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,706
I think you're joking,

188
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,126
but if you could do that, that
would be very interesting for us.

189
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,003
Yeah, very interesting.

190
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,796
And if I do get
the promotion, then what?

191
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,506
I have to work more
hours at the job I hate.

192
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,050
Wow, you're really bumming me out, man.
I hate this job, too.

193
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:29,218
Wait, what's going on?

194
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,804
Feds got in at 5:00 this morning.
Seized everything.

195
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,140
Georgie! Man with the plan.

196
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,058
I am going to take a little
rain check on our chit-chat.

197
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,769
Company shutdown effective immediately.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

198
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,899
Did I just get
wink-point shitcanned?

199
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,197
What are you doing here?
How did HBO go?

200
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,866
Well,
they're passing on this one,

201
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,910
but they are definitely interested
in not seeing my other projects,

202
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,955
so it turns out I can't fly.

203
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,750
Why are you not
at work, George?

204
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,461
Oh! (STUTTERS)
I got fired.

205
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,464
You want to sell?

206
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,885
Well, my work situation
has changed a little.

207
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,970
Look, I'm going to be completely
honest with you guys.

208
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,180
The market has dropped.

209
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:15,514
We just bought it.

210
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,974
You said it was
a good investment.

211
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,184
I think you said that.

212
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:19,393
You said that!

213
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:22,396
In any case, it doesn't
matter who said it.

214
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,648
Nobody's buying studio
apartments right now.

215
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:25,900
It's a microloft.

216
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,194
Okay, let's just grow up
and call things what they are.

217
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,695
It's a studio apartment.

218
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,072
I knew it!

219
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,574
Even if you could sell it,
it would be at a loss.

220
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,201
You're not seeing
that money again.

221
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,997
As soon as we can
get back on our feet,

222
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,707
we'll talk about
coming back to New York.

223
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,250
Right now my brother
has offered me a job

224
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,002
and Atlanta's
the best place for us to be.

225
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:47,171
They call it "Hot-lanta!"
Isn't that funny?

226
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,506
(SCREAMING)

227
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,596
You're so obsessed with your Joe's Coffee.
It had to be Joe's Coffee.

228
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,640
It's great fucking coffee!

229
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,558
(BOTH SINGING WITH RADIO)

230
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,440
We are fucked, we are fucked!

231
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,234
We're fucked!
George, stop!

232
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,402
(BOTH SINGING WITH RADIO)

233
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,035
That's how much you
made last year, $800.

234
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:20,204
You know what? I think you
like that I don't work.

235
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,789
How could you let
this happen to us?

236
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,332
Eight hundred dollars!

237
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,042
I didn't mean it.
I was upset.

238
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,461
Yes, I meant it! (CRYING)
I told you, you did!

239
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:29,130
(SNORING)

240
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,885
Oh! (EXCLAIMS)

241
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,305
(BOTH SINGING)

242
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,603
You were the one
that said, "Let's look"

243
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,147
"in the West Village
to buy an apartment."

244
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,815
I'm turning on the music!
Don't turn on that music.

245
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,775
(SINGING WITH RADIO)

246
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,488
(SWITCHES RADIO OFF)

247
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:58,033
Cock.

248
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,338
I can't be in this car any more!
Jesus Christ!

249
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,424
I just can't.
We've got to stop somewhere.

250
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,217
Fine. Okay.

251
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,719
I'm just really tired, okay?

252
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:17,970
I said "fine," all right?

253
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,805
Just quit selling me
after I said yes.

254
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,142
Elysium Bed and Breakfast, 10 miles.
Fine.

255
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,856
Oh, my God, it's just a shack and it's closed.
I'm going to scream, George.

256
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,024
GEORGE: It's a fruit stand.

257
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,776
Hold on, what's down that road?

258
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:38,240
"Elysium. Dreams dispensed daily.
Bring your own container."

259
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:39,658
I just hope they have a bed.

260
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,620
If they didn't, it would probably
be called "Elysium just Breakfast."

261
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,538
Does everything have
to be a joke, George?

262
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:45,623
(SCREAMS)

263
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,542
Are you looking
for the B and B?

264
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:50,211
It's another half mile.
You can't miss it.

265
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,422
Thank you.
Thank you.

266
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,217
Leave?
Yeah.

267
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,301
Back up, back up, back up.

268
00:11:58,469 --> 00:11:59,929
No, no, no.

269
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,472
He's following us!
What does he want?

270
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,390
Honey, he's coming after us!
Oh, my God!

271
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:05,059
What does he want?
I don't know!

272
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,894
He wants to chop us
up into 100 pieces

273
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,604
to make a suit
out of our skins!

274
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,147
I don't know.
Just back up faster!

275
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:12,483
The Bed and Breakfast is the other way!
The other way!

276
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,819
LINDA: He's getting really close!
Hurry! What are you doing?

277
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,363
Oh, my God!

278
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,949
GEORGE: Oh, God! Oh, God!

279
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:26,830
Are you guys Okay?

280
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,332
Oh, boy.

281
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,252
There is nothing we can do
about it until morning.

282
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,419
But we'll take care of you.

283
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,755
My name is Wayne, by the way.
I'm a nudist.

284
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,882
Yes, we noticed
your penis earlier.

285
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,425
Touché!

286
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,263
(GREETS IN SWEDISH)

287
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,931
I'm sorry?

288
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,767
Don't be sorry. It means
"good evening" in Swedish.

289
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,769
I studied economics
in Stockholm.

290
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:49,979
But don't worry,
I'm not going to be

291
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,188
throwing Swedish
at you all night.

292
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,148
<i>"God afton"</i> is pretty much
all I can remember.

293
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,068
But there I go, running
off at the mouth again.

294
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:59,321
Some people call it "verbal diarrhea."
I just call it "word shit."

295
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,365
BOY: I'm a butterfly!

296
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,409
I've got wings!

297
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:04,743
Grisham is a butterfly.

298
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,620
I'm really a boy.

299
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:09,164
Okay, that will be our secret.
All right!

300
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,209
He thinks I didn't hear what
you just said, but I did.

301
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,546
These folks pulled the old
flip-de-doo at the ravine.

302
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,006
Probably trying to
back out because they

303
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,799
thought I was some
kind of naked weirdo.

No.
Yeah.

305

Do you have a room?

306
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,347
Do you remember
downstairs a minute ago

307
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,224
when you asked if I had a room?

308
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,393
Does this answer your question?

309
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,894
Yeah, I guess it does.

310

00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,856
I'm Kathy, by the way.

312
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,899
I'm Linda. That's George.

313
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,067
Hello.

314
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,986
"George," huh?

315
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:43,365
If you're George, then where's
John, Paul and Ringo?

316
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,993
Ah. (CHUCKLES)

317
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,330
Where are they?
Did you bring them?

318
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,582
No, I didn't bring them.

319
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,042
Not even Ringo?

320
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,044
Nope.

321
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,386
You know I'm kidding, right?
I do, yeah.

322
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,638
We're really tired, Kathy.

323
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,098
Okey-dokey.

324
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,267
Thank you, though.

What is that?

327
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,826
I thought it was you.

328
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,037
Me, doing what?

329
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,875
Please, baby. I'm so tired.

330
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,043
Oh, God.

331
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,127
I beg of you.

332
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,213
Please make it go away.

333
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,465
You're my hero.

George!

That's it, George!

341
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,798
Linda!
Yes.

342
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,551
Kathy told me that
you had beautiful skin.

343
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,429
But she's a liar,
because it is luminous.

344
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,556
Thank you. Who are you?

345
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,099
My name is Karen.

346
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,102
I'm sorry if my hands smell like tahini.
I was just making some hummus.

347
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,354
Take it home!
(BLOWING)

348
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,068
This is much less
aggressive than clapping.

349
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:45,279
Try it, try it.
Seriously, it's better.

350
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,448
Babe, can I talk to you
just for a second, outside?

351
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,535
Did you smoke pot?

352
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:54,705
(CHUCKLING) No.

353
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,125
Why did you just lie to me?
I'm not going to tell on you.

354
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,127
I had one hit.
One?

355
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,046
I think it might be the best
pot I've ever had in my life.

356
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,091
You have to try this.

357
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,385
Hey, Rodney. What's up?
What's up? What's up?

358
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:10,053
This is Linda.

359
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,638
Hey. Here you go, beautiful.

360
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,182
Linda with the luminous skin,

361
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,476
it's so nice to meet you.
Thank you.

362
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,978
Did you know that all these
people, they live here?

363
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,813
This is a commune.
Isn't that crazy?

364
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,023
(COUGHING) That's crazy.

365
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,649
I'm Rodney, I'm her husband.

366
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,277
He's an African-American.

367
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,614
Wow, you guys
are really in love.

368
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,743
We are. We are just as much in
love as if we were the same color.

369
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,370
We actually had our
wedding ceremony right here

370
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,331
and Seth was our
spiritual officiant.

371
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,457
Who's Seth?

372
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,209
You haven't met Seth?

373
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,919
In a word, he's

374
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,881
a teacher, a guide,
a coach, a guru, a shaman.

375
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:47,966
He's everything.

376
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,051
Everything.

377
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,761
So, Seth is your leader?

378
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,262
SETH: No, no, no.

379
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,223
We have no leaders here.

380
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,643
Mother Earth is
the only leader we need.

381
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,729
You two must be
the proud owners of

382
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,773
that upside-down people-mover
out in the driveway.

383
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,566
I'm Seth.

384
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,610
I'm George. This is Linda.

Hi.
Hi.

386
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,863
Looks like you made
it out unscathed.

387
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:11,740
(GEORGE GROANS)

388
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,700
Not totally unscathed.
Ow!

389
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,245
Feel it? (SHRIEKS)

390
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,541
How do you feel?

391
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,792
I'm better, I think.

392
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,168
That's good.

393
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,212
We'll deal with those withholding
father issues another time.

394
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,048
And you must be...

395
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,299
I'm Linda.

396
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,261
Linda.

397
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,221
Hi. Oh.

398
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,224
You smell like
walnuts and suede.

399
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,310
(LAUGHING) Walnuts and suede.

400
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,398
Welcome to Elysium.
Come on, I'll show you around.

401
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,901
That's a God's eye. I made
it myself, last Kwanzaa.

402
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,570
I love what
you've got going here.

403
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,071
Honest,
I feel like I can breathe

404
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,906
for the first time in
I don't know how long.

405
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,241
It's incredible!

406
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,078
How long has
the house been here?

407
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:02,291
I bought this house in 1971
with nine of my friends.

408
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:07,212
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie Davis,
Ronny Shames, Danielle Meltser,

409
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:12,175
Janie Brody, Billy Marcus,
Glen Stover, Tony Piloski,

410
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,427
and Janice Woo.

411
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,096
Meet Carvin. He's kind of the
lion around these parts.

412
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,682
So, have you lived
here this entire time?

413
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,102
Yeah, ever since I bought
the place in 1971.

414
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,979
Right.
With nine of my friends.

415
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,482
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie Davis,
Ronny Shames, Danielle Meltser...

416
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,859
Those are the names
you just said.

417
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,195
Yeah. Billy Marcus, Glen
Stover, Tony Piloski...

418
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,031
Those are all people
you've already named.

419
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,866
So, you don't have
to say them again.

420
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,409
Any of those
people still live here?

421
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,996
No, no. They're mostly dead.

422
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,040
Pretty much dead.

423
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,958
I'm going to go to bed.

424
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,293
Good night.

425
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,711
Dead but not forgotten.

426
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,254
I mean, who knows how many days

427
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:50,672
any of us have
left on this Earth?

428
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:51,798
Right.

429
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:55,761
That's why I choose to fill my
life with nature and laughter

430
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,346
and friendship,

431
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,056
love.

432
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,265
(CHUCKLING)

433
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,269
This is some commune.

434
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,812
"Commune"?

435
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:09,399
Boo, hiss. We prefer the
term "intentional community".

436
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,651
When you hear
the word "commune,"

437
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:11,902
you think of a bunch of hippies

438
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:15,072
sitting around, smoking
pot and playing guitar.

439
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:17,908
Hey!

440
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,993
I'm Eva!
Hi!

441
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,662
I hear you guys
are from New York.

442
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,247
Fellow New Yorker.
88th and Broadway.

443
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,374
Oh!

444
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,708
Yeah.

445
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,628
What do you know?

446
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,422
We're from the West Village.
Yeah.

447
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,424
Waverly and Christopher.
The best neighborhood!

448
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,509
I know!

449
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,302
I know New York is a great city

450
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,054
but I do not miss
that lifestyle at all.

451
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,516
It was just stress and
BlackBerrys and sleeping pills.

452
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,185
I used to drink a triple latte
every morning just to wake up.

453
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,687
I see your point,

454
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,147
but I kind of
value the sleeping pill

455
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,858
and the BlackBerry
and the latte.

456
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,528
You know, you can really
get trapped in that web of

457
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,865
beepers and Zenith televisions
and Walkmans and Discmans,

458
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,201
floppy disks and zip drives.

459
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:05,706
Laserdiscs, answering machines
and Nintendo Power Glove.

460
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,792
Wow, you know so
much about technology.

461
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,044
All right,
the pond behind the house

462
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:14,131
is just begging
to be dipped in.

463
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,465
Skinny style.

464
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,718
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

465
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,052
Yeah, let's...

466
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,345
You're unbelievable.

467
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,680
Skinny style!

468
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,307
ALL: George! George!
Jump in, George!

469
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,602
Atta boy, baby!

470
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,400
I cannot believe...

471
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,153
I'm naked! I'm naked!

472
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,865

you're staying in. (ALL LAUGHING)

so badly, we would insist.

No, but I'm saying, literally,

It buys nothing.
You're right.

631

All right, then I'll shut up.

632
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,228
I'll shut up.
You know what? I'll shut up.

633
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:50,480
Because I don't
want to lecture you.

634
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,319
In my own house!

635
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,280
God damn it!

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

637
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,582
Okay, you know what?

638
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:14,796
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I "apologize," okay?

639
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,507
But can I give you
one piece of advice?

640
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,092
You're doing it wrong.

641
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:21,261
Rick, come on. Can I get
a word in edgewise here?

642
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,179
You come to my house,
crawling for help.

643
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:25,348
What do I do?
I open my door to you!

644
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,724
Can I please have
some more mimosa juice?

645
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,101
Marisa, please, mimosa juice.

646
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:31,437
You know, you don't have a
goddamn clue how to live life!

647
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,940
I gave you a gift, and you
think you can do better?

648
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,192
Who else do you know
who owns their own company?

649
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,361
So what if it's
the doo-doo business?

650
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,530
You want this?
This is how you get it!

651
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,199
Forget what you think
and do what I say!

652
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:46,244
I pull down six figures, George.
You should listen to me!

653
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,579
But you just talk,
talk, talk, talk...

654
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,876
Who knows how many days
any of us have on this Earth?

655
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,422
I want to fill mine with
laughter, happiness and love.

656
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:58,798
Let's get the fuck out of here.

657
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:02,218
Linda, take off your robe.
We're leaving.

658
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,512
No, upstairs, with your other clothes.
I'm sorry.

659
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:05,847
Come on.
Okay.

660
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,099
MARISA: Are you guys going
to be back for dinner?

661
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:14,647
With open arms and open hearts

662
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:18,318
we welcome George and Linda
as resident members

(ALL CHEERING)

665
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:22,989
Welcome home.

666
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,574
All right!

667
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,286
This is it.

668
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:29,620
What? Wait a minute.

669
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,331
What happened to that fancy
room with the fireplace

670
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,957
that we were in the last time?

671
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,460
That room is for paying
guests, you silly billy.

672
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:39,213
I love it. I think it's great.
What more do we need, you know?

673
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:42,425
We got a bed.
It looks nice and broken in.

674
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:45,803
We've got a shelf,
got a door...

675
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:47,597
...way.

676
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,015
Got a doorway.

677
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:50,475
Doors close us off
from one another.

678
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:52,518
We like to keep a nice,
open flow in the house.

679
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,437
Yeah, I don't need a door.
Do you need a door?

680
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,189
Nah.

681
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:59,400
I'm glad we don't have a door.
Doors are bullshit.

682
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:00,693
That's right.

683
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:06,824
Honey, I can't do this.
I can't.

684
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,785
I like doors.
I love them, in fact.

685
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,953
We're going to stay here.
This is the best place for us.

686
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,538
He's absolutely right, Linda.

687
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:13,915
Seth, you're back!

688
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,166
I never left.

689
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,960
I was just relaxing
outside the door, here.

690
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,670
But I think you two
should talk privately.

691
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:22,673
All right.

692
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,802
Oh, my God.
Is this the stupidest,

693
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,553
most crazy decision
we have ever made?

694
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,347
Honey, come on. We're just
running away from life.

695
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,849
Linda, the concept of an
intentional community like Elysium

696
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:34,102
is far more involved
and far more evolved

697
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:36,062
than any of these plastic,
shrink-wrapped

698
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,563
summations you're
coming outwith.

699
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:39,065
He's right.
Thank you, Seth.

700
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,566
Thank you.

Let me see.

00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:47,573
I'm not gone yet.
But I'm going to leave now.

George, convince me
that this is the right thing.

706
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:56,791
Didn't you feel more alive that first
night than you had in a long time?

707
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,043
Yes, I did.
Honey, it was amazing.

708
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,003
So why shouldn't we
feel that every day?

709
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,297
I think it's such
a obvious choice.

710
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:04,715
There's no one way
to live our lives.

711
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,050
I think it's really
cool if we do that.

712
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:07,301
I get what you mean.

713
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:09,762
It's not like we're signing a lease.
If we don't like it, we leave.

714
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:11,264
But let's stay a month,
and at the end

715
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,474
we can decide if we're
in it for the long haul.

It's got to be
better than this, anyway.

I'm going to let that go.

Let what go?
You know what?

731
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,316
I'm going to show you
the method to my madness.

732
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:04,400
Okay.

733
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:07,737
But first, I have to put on the
old dangle bag, just in case.

734
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,363
Just in case of what?

I can tell when you don't really
care and you're just humoring me.

940
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:41,185
And how does that
make you feel, Linda?

941

That would be your problem.

And I don't feel supported.

What?
I don't feel...

946
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,701
Did you just say, "I don't
feel like I support..."?

947
00:42:57,785 --> 00:42:59,495
Yes, I did.
You want the truth?

The point is, you jump...
KATHY: Here's the point.

951
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,712
Linda, he's getting to the point.
Let me get...

952
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:11,757
This is when
the breakthroughs happen.

953
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,925
Would you please let me
get to the point?

954
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:15,344
Don't get angry at me!
Get angry at her.

955
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:18,013
I work...
"Linda." Start with "Linda."

956
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,890
Linda...
Don't edit yourself.

957
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,266
I'm not.
"Linda."

958
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,185
I work...
Have at her, George.

959
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,311
Hit her!
What?

960
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:27,940
Not with your hands.
With words, with your truth.

961
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:29,441
I'll hit you with truths.

962
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:31,026
Do you want to know
what it's like to work

963
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,654
as hard as I do and
get no appreciation?

964
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:37,157
Just so you can do whatever flight
of fancy you have this year

965
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:41,036
whether it's pottery, or photography,
or it's "the Occasional Cafe."

966
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,955
What the fuck is
"the Occasional Cafe"?

967
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:44,248
That was an occasional café!

968
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,749
Pick one thing and
just stick with it!

969
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,752
Do you know how hard it is
to be married to somebody

970
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:51,380
who is still trying to
figure out their major?

971
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,720
I'm sorry that
I haven't figured out

972
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:01,306
what it is that
I love to do yet, George.

973
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,351
But at least I'm not sitting in
a fucking office like you did

974
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:07,646
miserable, hating your job,
and complaining about it.

975
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,982
That job that I sat at
and complained about every day

976
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,525
paid for the apartment
you wanted so much.

977
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,026
We don't even have it any more.

978
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:19,867
Linda, is there anything else
you want to say to George?

979
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,161
Any other ways he's
completely failed you?

980
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:26,415
Do you want the truth?

981
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,880
George is right.

982
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:34,798
He's totally right.

983
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:41,763
I've never committed to
anything in my entire life.

984
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:48,353
No, it's not...

985
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:50,314
It's true.

986
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:51,523
Linda,

987
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:54,359
I think you just met Linda.

988
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:57,613
KATHY: You're an
amazing woman.

989
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:00,782
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

990
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,284
I have one more question.

991
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:04,703
Ask anything,
my sweet soul warrior.

992
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:08,332
Why is that grass crying?

993
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,459
It's really loud.

994
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,878
I have a feeling
that it's my fault.

995
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:15,297
Because I think I made it cry.

996
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,548
Don't take it personally.

997
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:18,008
What the fuck are
you talking about?

998
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,593
It's the ayahuasca.

999
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,970
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

1000
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:23,222
What the fuck is going on?

1001
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:25,307
Ayahuasca has
hallucinogenic properties.

1002
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,351
It's like a stronger peyote.

1003
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:29,353
Mine just kicked in.

1004
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:31,271
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1005
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:33,190
Yeah, no, I don't
think it's affecting me.

1006
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:35,108
I think mine's
starting to kick in, too.

1007
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,153
I can see
George's spirit animal.

1008
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:39,279
What?
What?

1009
00:45:39,363 --> 00:45:40,405
What did you say?
What did you say?

1010
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:42,449
You see my spirit animal?
You see my spirit animal?

1011
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:43,533
What is it?
EVA: What?

1012
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:44,618
Huh?
Huh?

1013
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:45,786
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1014
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:47,829
Hey, guys, I just lost my keys.

1015
00:45:47,955 --> 00:45:49,873
I had them right
in this pocket.

1016
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:51,792
EVA: She's going to
have so much fun.

1017
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:55,671
SETH: There's a snake
in the mirror.

1018
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:01,802
EVA: The word that's coming out of my
mouth looks like a tiny pink mouse.

1019
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:03,679
(SCREAMS)

1020
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:05,973
(GROANS)

1021
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:08,308
Are you okay?

1022
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:18,151
Yeah, yeah!

1023
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:22,656
Whoa! Holy shit!

1024
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,244
Sweetheart, listen to me.
Listen to me.

1025
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:30,414
You are tripping
your balls off.

1026
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,625
I can fly!
I believe I can fly, George!

1027
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:36,920
Metaphorically, I believe you can fly.
Literally, you can't fly!

1028
00:46:37,004 --> 00:46:38,547
I believe I can fly!

1029
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,216
If you're going to get literal
with an R. Kelly song

do<i> Trapped in the Closet.</i>

1031
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:46,138
You can't break your neck
if you're trapped in a closet.

1032
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:47,764
You just watch me.
No, no, no.

1033
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:49,808
Watch me, George.
No, no, no!

1034
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,311
I believe I can fly!
No! No! No!

1035
00:46:56,565 --> 00:47:00,402
See? You can fly.
I always believed it.

1036
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:02,070
LINDA: Oh, my God.

1037
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:06,867
Hmm.

1038
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,495
Hmm.

1039
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:13,040
Morning.

1040
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:14,291
Oh, God.

1041
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:16,168
That was a little crazy.

1042
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:17,961
That was great.

1043
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:23,425
You probably don't remember, but you
said some crazy stuff last night.

1044
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,761
I remember every word of it.

1045
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:29,848
Oh, God, I really
just feel great.

1046
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:32,476
Why is the doorway crying?

1047
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,269
(CHUCKLES) I'm just kidding.

1048

Uh-huh. Okay.

1051
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:49,326
Terrific. I can probably get there

Hey.

1057
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:03,131
Wow, that's quite
a big pile of pages.

1058
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:05,175
I get it, George.

1059
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:07,552
You're interested.
I'm flattered.

1060
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:11,223
When the time comes, I'll let you know.
I'll share it with you.

1061
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:13,100
I got a protagonist issue
I'm still working out.

1062
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:14,226
All right.
I have a lot of thoughts

1063
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,644
that I wanted to
get down here, and...

1064
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,563
That sounds great. I gotta
go into town for a second.

1065
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:20,148
How are you going to do that?

1066
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,858
Rodney didn't tell
you what happened.

1067
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:23,527
What happened?

1068
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:26,780
I don't understand.

1069
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:30,826
I know. I know, right?
It's crazy. It's crazy.

1070
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:35,163
What exactly happened, all right?
Take me through.

1071
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:38,041
Okay. Well, it was like,
"I'm going on the road."

1072
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,584
Cut to, in the pond.

1073
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:41,545
No, don't "cut to" the pond.

1074
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:43,004
What... Don't cut.

1075
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:45,966
I mean, can you believe that?
Can you believe it?

1076
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:47,384
No, I can't believe it.

1077
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:50,429
Which is why I want you to
tell me, how did that happen?

1078
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:51,596
I'll tell you what.

1079
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,473
Hindsight being 20/20,

1080
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:55,350
I probably wouldn't have
done it the same way.

1081

our car for anyway?

matter any more.

Hey, George.

Hey, Eva,
I didn't see you there.

1085

You look sad.
Well...

Everything that's been happening
in your life recently,

1087
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:21,710
the fact that you're walking on
two feet at all, it's amazing.

1088
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:23,712
Seriously, George.

1089
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:27,382
I've been walking on two feet
for most of my adult life.

(CHUCKLING)

1091
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,720
Oh, George.

1092
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:33,054
I like you.

1093
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:35,223
I like you, too, Eva.

1094
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,392
We should make love sometime.

1095
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:49,070
George?
Yeah.

1096
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:51,323
I heard you. Yeah.

1097
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:53,241
You don't know
about our philosophy.

1098
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:55,202
Here at Elysium
we believe that open

1099
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:57,078
sexual boundaries
lead to a deeper honesty.

1100
00:49:57,579 --> 00:49:59,206
How would you and
Linda feel about that?

1101
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,712
Anyway, think about being inside me.
Talk to Linda.

1102
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,927
Here you go, sir. Have a great day.
Thank you very much.

1103
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:14,638
And you enjoy that apple.

1104

Honey!

1105
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:19,559
I just sold my first apple. I picked
it, I bagged it and I sold it.

1106
00:50:19,643 --> 00:50:22,020
Terrific. Our car is
at the bottom of a lake.

1107
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:25,398
So, George, I hear Eva asked
to intercourse with you.

1108
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:26,608
What?

1109
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:27,776
Yeah.

1110
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:29,152
Thanks, Seth.

1111
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,821
That was what I was
going to tell you.

1112
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:34,824
Apparently, at Elysium,
they practice free love.

1113
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:38,954
And Eva suggested
that we try it.

1114
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,539
What did you tell her?

1115
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:44,167
No. I said no.

1116
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:46,586
I mean, we didn't
finish the conversation,

1117
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:50,632
but I was about to,
and I will and did say no.

1118
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,050
This is just biology.

1119
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,636
Homo sapiens weren't meant
to be monogamous creatures.

1120
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:57,264
I don't know, that just
sounds to me like an excuse

1121
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:59,474
for everybody just to
get into bed together.

1122
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:02,227
If you want to pick a fight
with your body's sexual chi,

1123
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,979
it's just going to
drive it inwards.

1124
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:07,023
And that invites
disease and death.

1125
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:08,441
(WHISTLES)

1126
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:10,860
Man, I'm not a fan of death.

1127
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:16,491
People treat sex like it's this huge
deal with crazy life consequences.

1128
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:18,034
Right.

1129
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:19,327
CARVIN: What are
you doing here?

1130
00:51:19,411 --> 00:51:21,580
I don't understand. What are you
doing here on our property?

1131
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:22,872
That sounds like
the lion's cry.

1132
00:51:22,956 --> 00:51:24,124
This is our property!

1133
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:26,376
Of course we have
the goddamn deed to it.

1134
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,295
Then prove it.
Where is the deed?

1135
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:33,091
If you think I can remember where
I put a piece of paper in 1971...

1136
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:34,551
If you wanna make
a stink out of this,

1137
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:36,177
you can do that,
but you're going to lose.

1138
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:38,722
Or, we resolve this
very quickly

1139
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:41,224
and we all come away
with something.

1140
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:44,311
It's okay, George.
I got this.

1141
00:51:44,561 --> 00:51:46,021
I wasn't going to do anything.

1142
00:51:46,438 --> 00:51:49,524
Our people have a spiritual
right to this land!

1143
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:52,527
We have deep roots here.

1144
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,947
I don't think the lion could have
roared any clearer, my friend.

1145
00:51:58,575 --> 00:51:59,659
No dice.

1146
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:04,664
There's thousands more where that came from.
I actually...

1147
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,041
Can I have one of those?

1148
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,543
Yes, please, that's for you.
And keep that, sir.

1149
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,379
Oh, really?
Smile.

1150
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,298
I can do that, too.

1151
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:14,549
Deal with me.

1152
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:17,052
How do you like that?
Here, Brett, why don't you?

1153
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,345
See? How do you like that?

1154
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:20,013
Really? Do you want it?
I'll take another.

1155
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:22,057
Yeah, sure. Here you go.
Thanks very much.

1156
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,726
Please, please.
It's my pleasure.

1157
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,145
Three can play at that game.

1158
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:29,731
There's a Kinko's
13 miles down the road.

1159
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:30,815
Go get copies.

1160
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:32,067
I will get more cards.
I will be back.

1161
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,069
Come back and buy a zucchini.

1162
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:36,112
MAN: And we will
build that casino.

1163
00:52:39,074 --> 00:52:41,368
Carvin, do you have any idea
where the deed is?

1164
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:44,996
No, I'll find it, because
I use the think method.

1165
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,290
I just think of,
"Where wouldn't

1166
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:49,668
"I expect it to be?"
and I go there.

1167
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,086
And so far, it's not there.

1168
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:52,796
SETH: Don't worry,
we can fight this.

1169
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:54,339
Oh, my God!

1170
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,757
What's the matter?
What happened?

1171
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:57,759
George just killed
a defenseless animal.

1172
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:01,971
What?
No, I just swatted a fly.

1173
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:05,767
For Christ's sake!
Here we go.

1174
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:08,520
And now it's dead. What if it
had young living somewhere?

1175
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:11,481
Young? Like, maggots?
Are you serious?

1176
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:13,650
This man has a fetish for violence.
No, I don't.

1177
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:15,944
He has a fetish for violence!

1178
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:17,112
We're talking about a fly.

1179
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:18,279
SETH: And where does it end?

1180
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:19,656
When you kill a fly,
you kill a bird.

1181
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:20,907
You kill a bird,
you kill a dog...

1182
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,575
You kill a dog,
you kill a soldier.

1183
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:24,661
I'm sorry. I didn't know
I was killing soldiers.

1184
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:25,870
I support the troops.

1185
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:28,289
I cannot even look
at you right now.

1186
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:30,208
I'm sorry, I'm trying
to learn all the rules.

1187
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,876
There are no
rules here, George.

1188
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,294
Except "no swatting flies."

1189
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:34,796
That's not a rule.

1190
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:36,631
It's just a way of
thinking about stuff.

1191
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:37,966
You did something wrong

1192
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:39,801
and you're a little embarrassed about it.
It's okay.

1193
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:40,885
I did something wrong?

1194
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:42,011
Forgiveness is always allowed.

1195
00:53:42,095 --> 00:53:44,180
I've seen you throw
a battery at a pigeon.

1196
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:48,101
I didn't kill it.
Why are you doing that?

1197
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:49,978
It was a long time ago.
A long time ago.

1198
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:51,896
And it was right on our window, it was all...
(IMITATES COOING)

1199
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,314
That's not the point.

1200
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:56,401
I've said for years we should
have a bug zapper here.

1201
00:53:56,568 --> 00:54:00,488
1971, right here
at this table with

1202
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:03,158
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie,
Ronny, Danielle...

1203
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,118
Here we go.
Thank you, acid.

1204
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,996
Tony, Janie, and Janice Woo.

1205
00:54:08,163 --> 00:54:10,039
You know, it's amazing,
I can remember

1206
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:13,042
Janice Woo with
perfect clarity.

1207
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,171
I just can't remember
where the deed is.

1208
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:18,047
You know why? Because I
didn't fuck the deed.

1209
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:19,132
That's right.

1210
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:35,231
(OVER PHONE) <i>Hey, it's Sherm. I'm out as usual.
Leave a message.</i>

1211
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:37,901
Hey, Sherm,
it's George, from work.

1212
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:39,194
How are you doing, man?

1213
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,863
Look, I was
wondering if you've heard

1214
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:44,365
of any job opportunities
back in the city.

1215
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,034
Linda and I have been
out of town for a while

1216
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,745
and we're kind of
itching to get back.

1217
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,206
Call me if you get the message.

1218
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,209
Hey.

1219
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,044
Hi.

1220
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:57,754
Oh, wow.

1221
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,924
She really is blossoming,
isn't she?

1222
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:04,469
Yeah, look at her go.
Marking her turf.

1223
00:55:04,636 --> 00:55:06,221
So free.

1224
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:08,723
I'm just sad that she didn't
respond to the free love idea.

1225
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:11,184
I know. I know.

1226
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:13,728
I respect your and Linda's
relationship so much.

1227
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:16,064
But if you ever
change your mind...

1228
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:17,607
You'll be the first to know.

1229
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:20,151
I promise
I wouldn't disappoint.

1230
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:23,404
(STUTTERS) Yeah, that's great.

1231
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:27,367
I mean, I can lick your balls
while I give you a blowjob.

1232
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,493
No way!
Yeah.

1233
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:29,702
Oh, my God.

1234
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,748
I'm getting a little wet
just talking about it.

1235
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,167
Me, too.

1236
00:55:39,087 --> 00:55:42,465
People, they are breaking
ground on the casino today!

1237
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:44,092
We got to protest!

1238
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:46,094
The people will be heard!

1239
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:48,763
Where's my bullhorn?
I need the bullhorn!

1240
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:52,016
Where once stood
an insignificant fruit stand

1241
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,854
will now grow the much
sweeter fruit of prosperity.

1242
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:59,357
So here's to good jobs,
economic growth

1243
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,277
and tax revenue
for years to come.

1244
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:08,116
I'm the fucking founder, for Christ's
sake, suburban mall-dweller!

1245
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:11,160
No, no, no. You're
all on private property.

1246
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,537
Yeah, it's our property.

1247
00:56:12,704 --> 00:56:14,956
Private property this.

1248
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:18,042
Almond, no, no! Anger is
not the cure for this.

1249
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:19,294
Come on,
we have to do something.

1250
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,004
I know! It's like...

1251
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:23,131
Brother, if we could just talk,

1252
00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:24,465
heart to heart, for one moment.

1253
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:26,801
CARVIN: Greed-mongering
shithead!

1254
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:29,137
We're going to
expose you and your greed!

1255
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,389
You're all free to stand
on that side of the barrier.

We got what we need.</i>

1258
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:39,188
<i>Don't your viewers care about</i>

1259
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:42,275
<i>a corporation making backroom
deals with politicians</i>

1260
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:44,527
<i>so they can screw over
another local business?</i>

1261
00:56:44,611 --> 00:56:47,614
<i>Not for a 30-second segment
at the end of Atlanta P. M.</i>

1262
00:56:56,164 --> 00:56:57,582
It's impossible to
reason with these people.

1263
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:58,833
They won't listen to the truth!

1264
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,836
CARVIN: Your bulldozer's
a bully-dozer!

1265
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,339
We have to do something right now.
This is it.

1266
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:06,507
Hey, lady,
do you want to see something?

1267
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:09,010
Do you want
a really good news story?

1268
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:10,219
Take this!

1269
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:13,431
We've got boobs out!
And they're good ones!

1270
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:14,682
If you want to
move any further,

1271
00:57:14,766 --> 00:57:15,808
you're going to
have to run me over!

1272
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:17,393
Holy shit!

1273
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,313
REPORTER: <i>County officials got
more than they gambled for</i>

1274
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:23,483
<i>at a casino groundbreaking
ceremony earlier today</i>

1275
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:27,445
<i>when an angry, shirtless lady treated
attendees to quite the show.</i>

1276
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,947
<i>They lied to us!</i>

1277
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,531
<i>No more lies!</i>

1278
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:32,867
<i>No more lies!</i>

1279
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:36,162
<i>One by one, the topless
woman's enraged colleagues</i>

1280
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:39,540
<i>threw off their shirts
and joined her in protest.</i>

1281
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:43,086
<i>Baba Booey! Howard Stern!</i>

1282
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:45,922
Wonderful.

1283
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:49,008
<i>It's an interesting story
pitting a ragged band of locals</i>

upwards of 10 million dollars.</i>

<i>But just now
the County Commissioner has</i>

1286
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:56,975
<i>stated that no
construction will go forward</i>

1287
00:57:57,058 --> 00:58:00,103
<i>until a full re view of
community impact. Michael?</i>

1288
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:02,563
<i>Great report.
Thank you, Deena.</i>

1289
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,983
<i>Hey, Deena, maybe if they
ever build this casino</i>

1290
00:58:05,066 --> 00:58:06,484

can win the jackpot</i>

1292
00:58:08,403 --> 00:58:09,737
<i>It's certainly possible.</i>

1293
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:11,489
<i>Deena, could you
let us know if you're</i>

1294
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:13,199
<i>ever planning on
protesting a casino?</i>

1295
00:58:14,117 --> 00:58:16,536
<i>They're building a casino
at my place later tonight.</i>

1296
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,622
<i>Okay, nailed it.
There's more.</i>

1297
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:21,207
<i>Deena, I don't think
any of us would protest</i>

1298
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,960
<i>if you unexpectedly
took off your shirt.</i>

1299
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:27,338
<i>Deena, I do have
a new weather report</i>

1300
00:58:27,422 --> 00:58:31,134
<i>which is hot, sweaty
and I have an erection.</i>

1301
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:34,345
This is historic.

1302
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:36,097
The revolution has begun.

1303
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:40,935
All because this courageous
woman saw an unjust world

1304
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:42,812
and waved her boobies at it.

1305
00:58:43,271 --> 00:58:44,272
Let's celebrate!

1306
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,902
I didn't even know
we had a television.

1307
00:58:49,986 --> 00:58:52,530
Let's open some chutney!
The tomato chutney!

1308
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:54,323
The tomato chutney!

1309
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:58,119
No. No!

1310
00:58:58,453 --> 00:58:59,829
Where's George?

1311
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,458
Are you okay?

1312
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:04,751
I'm doing great!

1313
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:08,796
I felt something today when we
were standing up there and just...

1314
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:10,548
I know.

1315
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:13,843
Screaming it out and seeing
you with your shirt off...

1316
00:59:15,136 --> 00:59:16,888
That's an amazing
experience for me.

1317
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,725
I just only hope
that George gets it.

1318
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:23,311
You are a natural leader.

1319
00:59:23,478 --> 00:59:26,522
Oh, God, get out of here.
I feel like a schoolgirl.

1320
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:30,735
Go on, tonight's your night.
Enjoy it, celebrate it.

1321
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:38,910
Hi!

1322
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:42,330
God! I still cannot
believe that I did that!

1323
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,123
You're a hero.

1324
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,875
You're like
a topless Norma Rae.

1325
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:47,210
I feel amazing!

1326
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:48,544
It's great to see you so happy.

1327
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:49,962
I know, I am!

1328
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:52,340
I really am.

1329
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:54,717
So...
Yeah.

1330
00:59:54,884 --> 00:59:55,885
It's been two weeks.

1331
00:59:56,052 --> 00:59:57,470
I want to stay.

1332
00:59:57,678 --> 00:59:58,846
I want to stay.

1333
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,139
Okay, but before you answer...

1334
01:00:00,223 --> 01:00:01,557
I already answered.

1335
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:05,561
There's a possibility that I
have a job back in New York.

1336
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,855
We can go home.
We can go home!

1337
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:11,192
But I really...

1338
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,569
I really feel
like this is our home.

1339
01:00:14,237 --> 01:00:17,073
For the first time in my life,
I feel like I have a purpose.

1340
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:20,618
I've heard you say that before so
many times with so many other things.

1341
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:22,703
No, it's different this time.
I feel it.

1342
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,956
So you can live the rest of your
life without bathroom doors?

1343
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,082
Yes.

1344
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:27,291
You could be a vegan?

1345
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:29,085
I am a vegan. I love it.

1346
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,795
For two weeks
you've been doing it.

1347
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:33,214
They say three weeks and then
it's out of your system.

1348
01:00:35,383 --> 01:00:37,218
Open relationships?

1349
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:41,139
No sexual boundaries. That's
part of the deal here, too.

1350
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:42,890
Can you do that?

1351
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,310
Exactly.

1352
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:48,855
So, please, let's just go...
Okay.

1353
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:50,398
Okay? Yeah?

1354
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:52,483
No, okay. Free love.

1355
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:57,280
As long as there's trust, and
communication, and respect,

1356
01:00:57,446 --> 01:01:00,575
we can all enjoy
each other intimately.

1357
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:04,412
What? I love all of
these people, George.

1358
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:08,291
I love how I feel about myself
when I'm here. I just...

1359
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,626
George, I want to stay.

1360
01:01:13,171 --> 01:01:14,255
Okay.

1361
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:15,923
Okay.

1362
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:17,258
Really?

1363
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:19,093
Let's do it.

1364
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,262
Oh, God.

1365
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:26,601
I'm so proud of us right now.

1366
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:28,436
(SALUTES
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

1367
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,146
What did you say?
"Now I'm gonna stay"?

1368
01:01:30,813 --> 01:01:33,774
You're funny. I'm going
to go tell everybody.

1369
01:01:36,611 --> 01:01:39,322
We're staying!
We're staying!

1370
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:55,213
George,

1371
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:57,798
Linda just told
me the good news.

1372
01:01:57,882 --> 01:02:00,176
I'm so excited to
hear of your decision.

1373
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,723
Yeah, it's great! I know.

1374
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:10,770
Eva's really something,
isn't she?

1375
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,314
Yes, absolutely. The best.

1376
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:18,110
I just made love to your wife
in the other room.

1377
01:02:20,238 --> 01:02:21,822
Great.

1378
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:23,741
Thank you.

1379
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:28,120
Honey, we said we
were going to do it.

1380
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:31,540
No, I said we would
do free love in theory.

1381
01:02:31,624 --> 01:02:33,167
I didn't say
let's do it tonight!

1382
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:34,669
George! Oh, my God!

1383
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:37,672
This is awful.
This is such a nightmare!

1384
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:39,674
You have to do it tonight.

1385
01:02:40,091 --> 01:02:41,384
I don't know
if I can do it tonight!

1386
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:42,468
You have to!

1387
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:45,304
You can't just make me
be the only one who did it!

1388
01:02:45,388 --> 01:02:46,847
This was your idea!

1389
01:02:46,931 --> 01:02:49,225
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you did it!

1390
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:52,520
You just have to please go do this
tonight, otherwise we're doomed!

1391
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:53,854
I don't know...
For us!

1392
01:02:54,272 --> 01:02:55,273
I can try.

1393
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:56,357
No, there's no "try."

1394
01:02:56,691 --> 01:02:58,025
There is only "do."

1395
01:02:58,359 --> 01:02:59,902
What, are you Yoda?
George!

1396
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:02,363
I'm okay. I can do this.
Are you sure?

1397
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,031
Yeah, this is good.
Tonight's the night.

1398
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:06,492
This is it.
This is what it's about.

1399
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:09,287
Yeah! No shackles. We're
doing this as a team.

1400
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:12,915
You got to do this.

1401
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:16,585
Oh, God!

1402
01:03:18,087 --> 01:03:19,880
This was your idea, George.

1403
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:22,758
It's a good idea, right?
It's a good idea.

1404
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,802
Monogamy is sexual slavery.

1405
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:28,973
She got an exquisite pussy, well, how
about my exquisite erection? Huh?

1406
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:33,394
Eva, what do you think, do you
like my exquisite erection?

1407
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:37,064
Do you like my
erection selection?

1408
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:39,483
What do you think, Eva? Yeah?

1409
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,738
Are you going to take it? Are
you going to take that dick?

1410
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:46,782
Are you going to
take that dick?

1411
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,660
I'm going to pop off
a piece of my dick.

1412
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:52,621
Oh, yeah,
I'm fixing to fuck you.

1413
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:54,498
I'm going to fuck you.

1414
01:03:54,582 --> 01:03:55,916
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

1415
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,463
I'm going to get it
all up in your vag.

1416
01:04:00,588 --> 01:04:04,175
Get it up in your
vag with my dick.

1417
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:06,844
With my dick.

1418
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:11,015
I'm going to put it in
with my dick.

1419
01:04:11,182 --> 01:04:17,146
I'm going to put my dick in.

1420
01:04:17,355 --> 01:04:18,522
What's up, man?
Are you all right?

1421
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:19,774
What's up?

1422
01:04:31,327 --> 01:04:32,495
So, how we doing, George?

1423
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:34,538
Hi, Wayne.
Great. Never better.

1424
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:36,290
It's funny because
I didn't want to get

1425
01:04:36,374 --> 01:04:38,084
into this before
because we had just met,

1426
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:40,336
but, as you know, I'm writing
a new novel right now.

1427
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:41,420
Really?

1428
01:04:41,504 --> 01:04:44,924
It's a political parable about the
flaws of capitalistic society.

1429
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,426
I could tell you the story, but
it would probably bore you.

1430
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:48,969
Maybe later.
I'll just give you a taste.

1431
01:04:49,053 --> 01:04:52,014
Basically, it's about this
one guy named John Belson.

1432
01:04:52,098 --> 01:04:55,101
And John is just this guy,
an average Joe...

1433
01:04:55,643 --> 01:04:57,436
I can actually even maybe
name him "Joe Belson."

1434
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,230
You could.
And the big thing is...

1435
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:00,898
Tell me if I'm boring you.
No, finish your sentence.

1436
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,734
The big thing is,
at a certain point I reveal

1437
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:06,821
that this is all happening
in Washington, D.C.

1438
01:05:07,363 --> 01:05:08,906
Wow. Yeah.

1439
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:10,950
Belson's a creature
of the Beltway.

1440
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,661
Yeah. I'll tell you this...

1441
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:14,745
Eva...

1442
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:16,580
I'll read you this one part,
unless you're not interested.

1443
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:26,841
Hey. There you are.

1444
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:28,175
Hi.

1445
01:05:28,384 --> 01:05:30,177
I am ready to have sex.

1446
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,471
Great. Come here.

1447
01:05:33,806 --> 01:05:34,890
Awesome!

1448
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:38,310
But I can't believe
this is actually happening.

1449
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:39,728
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

1450
01:05:39,979 --> 01:05:41,313
God, George...
(PANTING)

1451
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:43,315
Your heart is racing.
I know.

1452
01:05:43,399 --> 01:05:45,693
I've wanted to do
this since we first...

1453
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,361
Yeah.
Since we first...

1454
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:49,280
And now it's okay.
Yeah.

1455
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:52,032
Now it's not like before.
Now I can actually...

1456
01:05:53,242 --> 01:05:55,578
Breathe, George, breathe.

1457
01:05:55,703 --> 01:05:57,121
Feel it in your diaphragm,
just breathe it in.

1458
01:05:57,288 --> 01:05:58,747
You're going to feel it
in your diaphragm with my...

1459
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:01,584
You're going to
feel it with my dick.

1460
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:03,043
Okay.

1461
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:05,379
Do you need to
take a minute, George?

1462
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:07,423
No, I'm good. I'm good.

1463
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:08,883
I'm going to do this.

1464
01:06:09,175 --> 01:06:10,468
This is going to happen.

1465
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:11,594
Yeah.

1466
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:13,721
I'm going to throw down.

1467
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:15,931
I'm going to
throw down onto you

1468
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:19,852
with my testicles.

1469
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:21,187
Okay.

1470
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:23,314
I'm going to get on it.
I'm going to get on it

1471
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:26,609
and I'm going to get in it
and down it and through it.

1472
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:29,111
It's going to be
magically delicious.

1473
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:31,655
You're going to
be my lucky charm.

1474
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,574
Okay, just don't talk,
let's just...

1475
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:36,785
I'm going to get a big old
brimming bowlful of fuck

1476
01:06:36,869 --> 01:06:38,913
on your boobs.

1477
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:40,706
George, let's just...

1478
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,541
I'm going to lick your titties.

1479
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,210
I'm going to lick your...

1480
01:06:44,919 --> 01:06:45,961
What?
Can I lick it?

1481
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:50,007
I'm going to
slap you on the eye

1482
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:52,092
with my cock.

1483
01:06:52,843 --> 01:06:54,720
I'm going to flick you in
the nuts with my balls.

1484
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:56,055
I'm going to put my...

1485
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:57,681
Put it on your neck.
I really don't...

1486
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:00,726
That's I'm going to pump
you with my gonads.

1487
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:01,810
No.

1488
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:02,978
That's a spicy meatball...

1489
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:04,104
George, you know...

1490
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:05,314
...in your spicy hole.

1491
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:06,607
George, you're creeping me out.

1492
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:09,360
I'm sorry. When I get nervous, I
sometimes just talk, and that's...

1493
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,778
I'm sorry, let's...

1494
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:15,282
Okay. George...

1495
01:07:16,492 --> 01:07:18,619
I really think you
should go take a minute.

1496
01:07:18,786 --> 01:07:20,371
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I don't think this is...

1497
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:21,622
Just don't even worry about it.

1498
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:22,873
Maybe we should do
this some other time.

1499
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:24,542
Let's not.
No, just the head of it in.

1500
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:27,336
It wouldn't even have to stay.
I'd just go, like, beep-boop.

1501
01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:29,296
Then technically, we did it.
Just a quick little...

1502
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:30,798
You wouldn't even know.

1503
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,508
No. No.

1504
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:33,884
This is very important,
all right?

1505
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:36,512
We have to do this for Linda.

1506
01:07:36,637 --> 01:07:38,472
I'm sorry, George.
I'm just not into it.

1507
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:39,723
I am.

1508
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:41,141
Great.

1509
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,852
Let's switch out. Okay?

1510
01:07:51,402 --> 01:07:54,071
I'm about to put my vag

1511
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:56,991
all up on your dick.

1512
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:00,619
Excuse me.

1513
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:07,835
Hey, George.

1514
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:10,421
Oh. Sorry.

1515
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:12,339
Are you meditating
or something?

1516
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:14,675
No, not at all. Come join me.

1517
01:08:16,552 --> 01:08:19,138
You didn't feel like going on
the moon hike with everyone?

1518
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:23,350
No, I'm taking a breather
from all that tonight.

1519
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,687
Maybe it's divinely inspired

1520
01:08:26,895 --> 01:08:30,733
that you and I
are here right now.

1521
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:33,986
That's nice.

1522
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:36,572
I can see that you
have a kind soul.

1523
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:44,038
Are we...

1524
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,665
Is this...

1525
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,044
(SHUSHING)

1526
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:57,009
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1527
01:08:57,968 --> 01:09:00,721
It's like Tantric or something.

1528
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:02,723
I'm having my baby, George.

1529
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:05,643
What? Fuck. No, you're not.

1530
01:09:05,768 --> 01:09:06,977
Yes, I am, George.

1531
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:08,729
No, no, no. Stop doing that.

1532
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:10,314
There's nothing
to stop, George.

1533
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:12,024
My baby is on its journey.

1534
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:13,901
Oh, my God! All right.

1535
01:09:14,068 --> 01:09:15,319
I'll call the hospital.

1536
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:16,862
No, no need.

1537
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:18,572
I'm going to do this myself.

1538
01:09:18,656 --> 01:09:20,240
No! No, that's a bad idea.

1539
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:23,911
It is the best idea the
universe has ever come up with.

1540
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:28,082
This is the most natural thing
that can happen to a person.

1541
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,250
(MOANING LOUDLY)

1542
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,127
I'm going to get Rodney.

1543
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:34,713
No. He'll be here
soon enough.

1544
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:36,590
Look at the full
moon right now.

1545
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,259
It's luminous.

1546
01:09:39,385 --> 01:09:40,344
Oh, God!

1547
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:41,428
Okay.

1548
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:42,971
(MOANING)

1549
01:09:45,891 --> 01:09:48,644
I'm opening like
a lotus flower.

1550
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:53,607
I'm passing out.
(BABY CRYING)

1551
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:55,609
Are you okay?
I'm passing out.

1552
01:09:55,693 --> 01:09:56,694
Okay.

1553
01:10:03,117 --> 01:10:04,702
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

1554
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:14,586
Rough couple of weeks, huh?

1555
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:17,005
No hard feelings about the
whole fly-swatting thing.

1556
01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:19,591
I would have done the same thing
if the tables were turned.

1557
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:26,515
By the way,
I just fucked your wife.

1558
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,563
Hey, Eva and I are downstairs
flipping flapjacks.

1559
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:34,022
You may want to get down there.

1560
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:37,025
Thanks, Wayne. How about getting
your dick out of my face?

1561
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:48,787
Is this coffee?

1562
01:10:48,871 --> 01:10:50,831
No, it's better than coffee.
It's kutcha root.

1563
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:51,957
It tastes like cow shit.

1564
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:56,253
George! It's so good to
have a joker in the house.

1565
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:59,131
It's real sugar? It's not
bark or sand or anything?

1566
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:01,008
SETH: There he is!

Oh, my God! So cute.

1569
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:06,513
There he is.

1570
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:07,723
What is that?

1571
01:11:07,806 --> 01:11:08,891
That's the placenta.

to make some soup.

1575
01:11:20,903 --> 01:11:22,404
Okay, you know what?
That's ridiculous.

1576
01:11:22,488 --> 01:11:24,782
I can't do it.
I can't do this any more.

1577
01:11:24,865 --> 01:11:26,033
Hey, whoa, whoa.

1578
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:28,786
You need to simmer down and breathe, brother.
Take a load off.

1579
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:31,371
No, why don't you simmer down?
Why don't you breathe, brother?

1580
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:32,623
Whoa, George...

1581
01:11:32,748 --> 01:11:33,957
No! This is crazy!

1582
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:35,751
I'm drinking
dirt for breakfast.

1583

And, Almond,
cut and discard that shit

1586
01:11:41,548 --> 01:11:42,883
off of your infant immediately!

1587
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,635
It's gross!

And, Karen, I hate to break it to

Fine! When?

1592
01:11:53,644 --> 01:11:55,646
And, Seth, where do I start?

1593
01:11:55,813 --> 01:11:56,814

01:11:56,897 --> 01:11:58,649

Ooh.

1599

LINDA: You wanted this.

1600
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:13,288
You wanted to come
back here, we moved.

1601
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:16,667
You wanted to dive headfirst into
everything that Elysium represented,

1602
01:12:16,834 --> 01:12:17,918
we did that.

1603
01:12:18,085 --> 01:12:20,587
You wanted to be free
sexually, I said "fine."

1604
01:12:20,796 --> 01:12:22,673
So last night
I do something that

1605
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:24,550
I never ever
expected that I could do,

1606
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:26,593
only because you encouraged it.

1607
01:12:26,885 --> 01:12:29,096
So how could you
possibly be mad at me

1608
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:31,431
when all I did was
follow your lead?

1609
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:32,975
Because it was a stupid idea!

1610
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:35,102
I'm an idiot!
Why would you listen to me?

1611
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:37,187
My God, we've known these
people for two weeks!

1612
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:39,857
But I'm not the same person
I was two weeks ago.

1613
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:43,235
You said to me, "Why can't
we be happy every day?"

1614
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,820
I lied, okay?

1615
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:48,657
I panicked, all right?
We were broke.

1616
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,325
This place had
food and shelter,

1617
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:52,411
and it was way
better than Rick's.

1618
01:12:52,786 --> 01:12:54,830
I'm admitting it. I thought
we could have fun here

1619
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:57,291
but then you drank the
Kool-Aid and I can't stand it.

1620
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:00,544
I want to support you, I do.

1621
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:02,629
But I can't if it
means living here.

1622
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:05,966
That might be a problem.

1623
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:08,218
George, can I just read
a passage from my book?

1624
01:13:08,302 --> 01:13:09,636
I think it's relevant.

1625
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:10,971
Wayne, no.

"John Belson sat in his car at
a stoplight at a crossroads."

1627
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:16,143
Wayne, your novel sucks.
It sucks.

1628
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:19,563
It isn't interesting, it isn't
entertaining, it isn't anything.

1629

Come here.
What's wrong with you?

1630
01:13:20,939 --> 01:13:22,441
I can't do this.
I can't do it.

1631
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:24,067
I can't have 15 people involved

I miss air-conditioning,

1634

I miss going to the bathroom

and being able to shut a
door like most people.

1636

Let's just make love.
And then we'll talk.

1722
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,869
No. I would rather not.

1723
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:28,914
Yeah. I understand.

1724
01:18:28,997 --> 01:18:31,082
George. I remember him well.

1725
01:18:32,334 --> 01:18:35,128
What we will do, is we will
make love without touching.

1726
01:18:38,757 --> 01:18:39,966
You know what, I gotta go.

1727
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,301
Wait, Linda...

1728
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:45,597
God, Seth.

1729
01:18:47,015 --> 01:18:48,850
I was almost there.

1730
01:18:49,643 --> 01:18:51,019
(LAUGHING)

1731
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:53,855
I just figured
out what George's

1732
01:18:53,939 --> 01:18:55,815
fortune cookie
fortune would say.

1733
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:59,986
"Confucius say when wife screw other
guy, husband must get rid of wife."

1734
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:02,572
"She no good.
The pork fried rice."

1735
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:06,159
What exactly did Mom do to you
that she didn't do to me?

1736
01:19:06,368 --> 01:19:07,661
Come on, I know it's offensive,

1737
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:09,287
but you gotta admit,
it's funny.

1738
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:10,997
That's funny!

1739
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:12,707
I'm not Chinese.

1740
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:16,378
That's funny! All I'm saying is
Linda is no good, screw her,

1741
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:19,714
screw those hippie-dippies, with their B.O.
and their white dreads.

1742
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:21,132
You have no idea, man.

1743
01:19:21,299 --> 01:19:22,759
Okay,

1744
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:25,178
so you're
complaining about Linda?

1745
01:19:25,262 --> 01:19:27,264
You're the one who wanted
to sleep with other people.

1746
01:19:27,347 --> 01:19:28,974
I didn't think she would say yes!
Bingo.

1747
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:30,976
At least she had permission
before she cheated.

1748
01:19:31,059 --> 01:19:33,561
My husband has been fucking at
least one woman on the side

1749
01:19:33,645 --> 01:19:35,522
ever since before our wedding.

1750
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,775
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

1751
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:40,902
You have a tracking
system in your car.

1752
01:19:40,986 --> 01:19:42,946
You never shut up
about it, stupid.

1753
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:49,244
Little reality shift, Rick?

1754
01:19:49,411 --> 01:19:50,787
Honey, no, no, no.

1755
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,539
No, no, no.

1756
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:54,457
No! Listen to me.

1757
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:57,836
I love you, and I have sex with other
women because I love you so much.

1758
01:19:57,919 --> 01:20:00,630
I'm getting it out of my system.
I'm trying to protect you.

1759
01:20:00,714 --> 01:20:02,173
Are you kidding me?
What do you want me to do?

1760
01:20:02,257 --> 01:20:05,010
Do you want me to tell you every
time I sleep with somebody?

1761
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:08,179
And then we have to deal
with that every time?

1762
01:20:08,388 --> 01:20:09,597
What is wrong with you?

1763
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:11,558
George, back me up on this!

1764
01:20:13,768 --> 01:20:15,895
What are you doing?
What's that face...

1765
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:17,314
Why are you doing that?

1766
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:18,982
Are you pooping?

1767
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:20,066
No, I'm crying.

1768
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,568
That's not what
crying looks like.

1769
01:20:21,735 --> 01:20:23,153
What do you want me to do?

1770
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:25,822
Can you get the fuck out of my
house and out of my life forever?

1771
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:28,533
That's it.
Okay, thanks. Get out!

1772
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:31,036
You're taking my infidelity
and making it about you!

1773
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:32,996
Do you realize how
selfish you sound?

1774
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:34,998
This is exactly
why I have to cheat!

1775
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:36,958
I hate you.
I want a divorce.

1776
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:38,043
No, honey, no.

1777
01:20:38,126 --> 01:20:40,628
I left my wife at a commune.

1778
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:42,380
What the fuck am I thinking?

1779
01:20:42,464 --> 01:20:44,549
I'm auditioning for
<i>Real Housewives of Atlanta.</i>

1780
01:20:44,632 --> 01:20:46,593
Are these your car keys?
Yes.

1781
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:49,387
Honey, you don't...

1782
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:51,056
Wait! No! No!

1783
01:20:51,598 --> 01:20:53,058
(LAUGHING)

1784
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:58,146
What are you doing with my car?

1785
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:00,023
We're family.
It's our car.

1786
01:21:00,106 --> 01:21:01,441
(HONKING)

1787
01:21:01,524 --> 01:21:03,193
Get out of the goddamn car!

1788
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,029
My baby is all I got left!

1789
01:21:12,494 --> 01:21:14,329
(RICK PANTING)

1790
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:20,085
That looks good. It looks even.
Centered?

1791
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:25,382
I'm going to town.
I'll see you in a bit.

1792
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:27,008
Bye, Linda.

1793
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:44,859
Mmm.

1794
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,736
Terrible, I know.

1795
01:21:46,903 --> 01:21:48,571
Steak at a diner.

1796
01:21:49,364 --> 01:21:53,201
It's like getting
cognac at a gas station

1797
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:55,328
or a diner.

1798
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:59,749
Carvin, please don't judge me.
I needed meat.

1799
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:02,001
Hey, I come here every Sunday.

1800
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:04,504
You can't live
off of macrobiotic

1801
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:06,631
bean curd shit your whole life.

1802
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,676
The first time
I snuck away years ago,

1803
01:22:09,843 --> 01:22:11,386
I had a veggie burger.

1804
01:22:11,511 --> 01:22:13,805
The next time, chicken salad.

1805
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,807
And then, two pounds of bacon.

1806
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:17,142
Oh, my God!

1807
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:18,768
Nobody knows about this.

1808
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:20,478
Your secret is safe with me.

1809
01:22:20,562 --> 01:22:21,646
Who cares?

1810
01:22:21,855 --> 01:22:24,357
I've been in
Elysium four decades.

1811
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:28,403
Hell, I co-founded the place with
Jerry Beaver, Stephanie Davis...

1812
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:30,155
Yeah, I know.
All those people.

1813
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:31,531
Billy Marcus, Tony Piloski...

1814
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:32,866
All of them. All those people.

1815
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:36,202
My point is you gotta do
what is right for you.

1816
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:40,039
Don't get me wrong. Elysium
is an amazing adventure,

1817
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:41,875
but sometimes I think

1818
01:22:42,584 --> 01:22:46,045
I missed out on something
that was even more real.

1819
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:47,630
You know, more real.

1820
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:51,634
Here you are, darling.

1821
01:22:51,718 --> 01:22:52,969
Mmm-hmm.

1822
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:58,141
LINDA: Wow! That's every
member of the meat family.

1823
01:22:58,224 --> 01:23:00,226
That's some kind of wurst.
"Wurst"?

1824
01:23:00,477 --> 01:23:03,313
I don't know why they call
it "wurst." It's the best.

1825
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:13,114
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1826
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:15,825
Surprised to see
you here, brother.

1827
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:17,494
Where's Linda?
I need to talk to her.

1828
01:23:17,702 --> 01:23:19,746
I'm diving into
the Linda pool these days.

1829
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:21,998
I only tell you this
because I love you, brother.

1830
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:25,251
Move or I will run you over,
because fuck you, brother.

1831
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,589
What the fuck are you doing?

1832
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:31,132
Capoeira.

1833
01:23:31,299 --> 01:23:33,343
Although a beautiful form
of Afro-Brazilian dance,

1834
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,887
it's also a devastating
form of self-defense.

1835
01:23:36,554 --> 01:23:38,014
(GRUNTING)

1836
01:23:43,269 --> 01:23:44,562
Let's dance, brother.

1837
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:49,567
Turn around, brother!

1838
01:23:49,734 --> 01:23:51,027
Let go of the wheel!

1839
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:54,447
She's a beautiful spirit who has
evolved away from you, George.

1840
01:23:54,614 --> 01:23:57,075
What are you talking about?
You're so full of shit!

1841
01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:07,669
Wow! They make cars
with CD players now?

1842
01:24:09,546 --> 01:24:13,132
Wow, it's so great to see
so much of so many of you.

1843
01:24:13,216 --> 01:24:14,801
(ALL LAUGHING)
I don't know what's worse,

1844
01:24:14,884 --> 01:24:18,805
Marty's pasty ass, or
Beverly's Malbec Pinot blend.

1845
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:20,139
This is great.

1846
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:23,851
Everybody run!

1847
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:42,954
Let go!

1848
01:24:43,037 --> 01:24:44,080
George!

1849
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:50,461
Holy shit! Did you see that?

1850
01:24:50,628 --> 01:24:52,839
No,
I turned away for one second.

1851
01:24:53,006 --> 01:24:55,049
Did I miss
something incredible?

1852
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:00,138
No! Who's in the car?
I don't know.

1853
01:25:00,305 --> 01:25:01,598
Who is that? Seth?

1854
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:02,765
I told you.

1855
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,518
That's a very
easy mistake to make.

1856
01:25:07,645 --> 01:25:09,397
Oh, my God.
George!

1857
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:16,279
George, what's going on here?

1858
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:18,323
Wayne, hey!
I read the latest draft.

1859
01:25:18,406 --> 01:25:19,407
Really?

1860
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:20,658
Incredible!
Yeah? Thanks!

1861
01:25:20,742 --> 01:25:22,118
And that last sentence.

1862
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:23,328
BOTH: "Get me
Senator McClusky."

1863
01:25:23,411 --> 01:25:24,912
Oh, my God! How did you
even think of that?

1864
01:25:25,622 --> 01:25:26,664
Lightning in
a bottle type of thing.

1865
01:25:26,748 --> 01:25:27,832
You know D.C. will
never be the same.

1866
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:28,958
That's what I love about it.

1867
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:30,627
But it doesn't spell it out.

1868
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,378
Thank you so much
for saying that, man.

1869
01:25:32,462 --> 01:25:33,546
Well done, really.

1870
01:25:36,007 --> 01:25:37,383
Seth, are you all right?

1871
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:43,681
Seth, what are you doing?

1872
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,350
Stop punching me!

1873
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:46,601
I'm not punching you.

1874
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:48,144
I'm slapping you!

1875
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:49,479
I wish there was something
we could do to help,

1876
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:51,147
but we're non-violent.

1877
01:25:51,356 --> 01:25:52,940
What do we do?

(ALL CHANTING)

1880
01:25:59,739 --> 01:26:01,115
Stop!

1881
01:26:02,492 --> 01:26:04,410
What happened to non-violence?

1882
01:26:04,577 --> 01:26:08,414
Violence is justified when
it serves the greater good.

1883
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:10,041
That's very convenient.

1884
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:13,920
This is not working!
No shit!

1885
01:26:14,087 --> 01:26:16,214
What the hell are you doing?
Get off of him.

1886
01:26:19,467 --> 01:26:21,469
I came back to tell you
I love you more than anything.

1887
01:26:21,594 --> 01:26:22,804
Oh, honey.

1888
01:26:22,887 --> 01:26:24,514
Jesus! Can a person
go a day in this place

1889
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:26,349
without getting
a dick in the face?

1890
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:28,101
I've heard that.
Every day.

1891
01:26:28,226 --> 01:26:29,268
That's what I'm talking about.

1892
01:26:32,313 --> 01:26:33,564
Come on, George!

1893
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:34,941
Get him!

1894
01:26:35,108 --> 01:26:37,026
You've progressed far
beyond George, Linda.

1895
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:39,737
You're selfless,
you're pure, you're vegan.

1896
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:41,739
I just had a steak at a diner.

1897
01:26:41,823 --> 01:26:44,200
In time, I can learn
to forgive you for that.

1898
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:45,785
Let go of George!

1899
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:47,662
Anything for you, my love.

1900
01:26:50,915 --> 01:26:54,210
You have to know that he asked
me to run away with him

1901
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:56,379
and he said that you would
all just find your way.

1902
01:26:56,462 --> 01:26:57,547
God damn it!

1903
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:01,134
Linda! I would never do that to
my brothers and sisters, please.

1904
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:05,638
He's lying! Seth burned the
deed to the commune. I saw him!

1905
01:27:05,722 --> 01:27:08,224
He burned it?
The deed to the commune?

1906
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:09,350
Motherfucker!

1907
01:27:09,434 --> 01:27:11,227
Seth, is that true?
You burned the deed?

1908
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:13,312
You burned the deed?

1909
01:27:13,855 --> 01:27:17,233
Look, if everyone's going to get
all law yeristic on me, yeah.

1910
01:27:17,483 --> 01:27:19,610
Yeah, I did.
I sold and I burned the deed.

1911
01:27:19,694 --> 01:27:21,446
Rat bastard turncoat.

1912
01:27:21,529 --> 01:27:24,365
But I did it for love.
I did it for Linda.

1913
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:28,244
Anyone would have done the
same thing for $11,000.

1914
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:29,912
I love you.

1915
01:27:30,288 --> 01:27:31,956
But I love me more.

1916
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:34,417
And for you guys to
turn this around on me,

1917
01:27:34,542 --> 01:27:36,669
well, frankly, it's selfish.

1918
01:27:36,836 --> 01:27:38,796
And fuck you, Grisham.

1919
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:40,715
(ALL GASP)

1920
01:27:46,471 --> 01:27:48,681
Ow! God, my wrist!

1921
01:27:48,848 --> 01:27:52,935
I don't think I did that right.
My wrist is killing.

1922
01:27:53,019 --> 01:27:54,437
Honey, you're a lover,
not a fighter.

1923
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:55,980
GEORGE: I'm an idiot.

1924
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:57,857
I love you so much.
I'm sorry.

1925
01:27:58,024 --> 01:28:01,194
I know. I'm so sorry
too. I went too far.

1926
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:02,904
I drank the Kool-Aid.

1927
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:04,697
And then when I was
done with the Kool-Aid,

1928
01:28:04,781 --> 01:28:07,575
I made more Kool-Aid
and then I drank that too

1929
01:28:07,742 --> 01:28:09,744
and it just
filled with Kool-Aid.

1930
01:28:09,911 --> 01:28:13,206
I love you and I will support
you in whatever you choose.

1931
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:14,582
Forever.

1932
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:16,876
I don't care where we live.

1933
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:18,711
You're where I want to be.

1934
01:28:19,212 --> 01:28:21,339
And you're where I want to be.

1935
01:28:28,471 --> 01:28:30,056
Yes! Oh, yes!

1936
01:28:30,223 --> 01:28:31,974
That's what I'm
talking about, George!

1937
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,566
And we're back.

1938
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:42,318
Later in the show,
we're going to be

1939
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:44,070
learning all about
how these text messages

1940
01:28:44,237 --> 01:28:46,072
are actually making
our children stupider,

1941
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,074
and the statistics
are terrifying.

1942
01:28:48,157 --> 01:28:49,659
I've seen them and they are.

1943
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:51,536
But first, do you remember
about a year ago,

1944
01:28:51,619 --> 01:28:53,037
when a bunch of hippie types

1945
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,747
up in the mountains put
on their birthday suits?

1946
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:56,415
They were protesting a casino?

1947
01:28:56,499 --> 01:28:59,544
I would remember it better if they
took those birthday suits off.

1948
01:28:59,669 --> 01:29:01,546
I don't know what that means.

1949
01:29:01,671 --> 01:29:03,881
Our own Deena Schuster
is back with an update

1950
01:29:03,965 --> 01:29:06,133
about these
Bohemians in the buff.

1951
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:08,386
Hi, Deena.
Hi, guys!

1952
01:29:08,469 --> 01:29:10,763
It looks like one
of those naked ninjas

1953
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:13,140
was cooking up more
than just a skin feast.

1954
01:29:13,224 --> 01:29:15,601
I'm talking
about Wayne Davidson,

1955
01:29:15,685 --> 01:29:17,728
the best-selling author
of the breakout

1956
01:29:17,854 --> 01:29:19,897
political thriller,
<i>Belson's Lament.</i>

1957
01:29:19,981 --> 01:29:23,109
As well as the eagerly awaited
sequel, <i>Belson Rising.</i>

1958
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:25,361
My favorite thing
about that book is

1959
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,613
when they reveal that
it's in Washington, D.C.

1960
01:29:27,697 --> 01:29:28,781
(YELLS)

1961
01:29:28,865 --> 01:29:30,074
What did I do?

1962
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:31,450
Michael, I haven't read it yet!

1963
01:29:31,701 --> 01:29:34,954
DEENA: First-time novelist
Davidson is a nudist, winemaker

1964
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,540
and full-time resident
of an intentional community

1965
01:29:37,623 --> 01:29:39,417
in Northern
Georgia called Elysium,

1966
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:42,378
worlds away from
the corridors of power

1967
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:44,839
he so piercingly
chronicles in his books.

1968
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:48,426
There's even talk of a Belson
movie starring Ray Liotta,

1969
01:29:48,509 --> 01:29:50,136
who has been spending time here

1970
01:29:50,261 --> 01:29:51,888
with the wardrobe-less
wordsmith.

1971
01:29:53,139 --> 01:29:55,391
Ray is an amazing actor,

1972
01:29:55,474 --> 01:29:57,059
he makes a great vegan chili

1973
01:29:57,143 --> 01:30:00,313
and he is an intense lover.

1974
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:02,815
We almost lost
the whole place last year,

1975
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,234
until an old friend
saw us on the tube.

1976
01:30:05,318 --> 01:30:07,153
I thought she was dead.

1977
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:09,280
And yet, she wasn't dead.

1978
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:12,408
DEENA: Co-founder Janice Woo had
a copy of the original deed,

1979
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:15,286
preserving the community's
rights to the disputed land.

1980
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:18,664
And as luck would have it, none of
the founding members were dead.

1981
01:30:18,831 --> 01:30:21,083
Not Jerry Beaver,
not Stephanie Davis,

1982
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:23,252
not Ronny Shames,
not Danielle Meltser,

1983
01:30:23,336 --> 01:30:25,463
not Janie Brody,
not Billy Marcus,

1984
01:30:25,546 --> 01:30:28,090
not Glen Stover
and not Tony Piloski.

1985
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:31,761
In fact, all were found to be in
above-average health. For now.

1986
01:30:31,969 --> 01:30:33,763
And the story of
Belson's journey

1987
01:30:33,846 --> 01:30:35,973
to bookshelves is
just as unlikely.

1988
01:30:36,182 --> 01:30:37,558
It was discovered by a boutique

1989
01:30:37,642 --> 01:30:40,102
Brooklyn,
New York publishing house

1990
01:30:40,186 --> 01:30:42,605
run by husband and wife,
George and Linda Gergenblatt.

1991
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:44,065
I actually wrote a book, too,

1992
01:30:44,148 --> 01:30:48,152
and it's a children's book
called <i>I Believe I Can Fly.</i>

1993
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:52,323
And it's about a confident little
penguin who overcomes his limitations.

1994
01:30:52,406 --> 01:30:54,075
Originally,
we were going to call it

1995
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:56,369
<i>The Penguin With
Testicular Cancer.</i>

1996
01:30:56,661 --> 01:30:57,870
Originally, but...

1997
01:30:58,037 --> 01:30:59,163
That wasn't going to sell.

1998
01:30:59,288 --> 01:31:00,414
No, no.

1999
01:31:00,498 --> 01:31:03,626
And now we have a growing company
where we can foster new writers.

2000
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:06,754
And we have connections to a
lot of really fresh voices.

Yes.

2033
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:02,244
Two weeks. Two weeks.

2034
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,831
What? What happened?

2035
01:33:05,915 --> 01:33:07,249
Suck on it for a while.

2036
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:08,751
(ALL LAUGHING)

2037
01:33:11,504 --> 01:33:15,174
I'll have you check out the erection
selection at the Dick-E-Mart.

2038
01:33:15,591 --> 01:33:18,594
"I believe I can fly"?
Well, I believe I can fuck.

2039
01:33:22,515 --> 01:33:24,725
I'm grossing myself out.

2040
01:37:49,615 --> 01:37:51,241
MARISA: I am
ready for action,

2041
01:37:51,325 --> 01:37:52,910
because I got all my
ex-husband's toilet money.

2042
01:37:52,993 --> 01:37:55,954
So, bring it on, Hot-lanta.
Show me what you got!
