Are you kidding?

00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:11,529
You call her a dog?

219
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:13,533
Fred, that's angel food cake.

220
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:15,034
You touch her...

221
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:18,527

Beg your pardon?

239
00:12:09,414 --> 00:12:10,540
The basketballs.

240
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:12,482
Would you kindly keep them
in your court?

241
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:14,382

to think about her
with her clothes off.

253
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:42,743

to look at her
with her clothes on!

Hey, Tim, l think maybe
we oughta invite Brian tonight.

257
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,427
TlM:
Why do we gotta invite a Jew?

258
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:58,019
All we need now
is a communist and a spic...

259
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:59,927
and we'd have the whole thing.

00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:09,200
l just don't see
why we gotta invite a kite.

264
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,707
BlLLY: Brian's a good guy.

265
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:12,369
He's only been here
a couple months.

266
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,672
Why don't you
give him a chance?

267
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,372
TlM: He's a jerk,
and a Jew jerk at that.

268
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:17,881
BlLLY:
All right! We won't ask him.

269
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,476
You're a case, Cavanaugh.

BlLLY: Take it easy.
We'll get them next time.

285
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:26,878
PEE WEE: But Miss Walker,

286
00:14:26,918 --> 00:14:29,478
MlCKEY: You're about to get
laid by an exotic dancer soon.

287
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,385
That's a real woman.

288
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:32,889
PEE WEE: Yeah. You're right.

MlCKEY: You sure
they can find this place?

293
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:00,343
TOMMY: They should

00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:05,923
MlCKEY: ''Cherry Forever''?

297
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:07,356
BlLLY:
That's her professional name.

Let's go.

306
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:49,825
