Silverlake
Animal Rescue

3
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:09,333
That one!

4
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,068
Here, boy.

5
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:21,262
You're heavy!

6
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,815
and slobbery!

7
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,009
There.

8
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:35,708
You're a good boy.

9
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,401
You're my good boy!

10
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,883
5 years later...

11
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:48,796
Hello!

12
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:53,100
Honey, I don't have much time!

13
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:54,105
Daddy?!

14
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,408
Are you okay?

15
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:59,446
Some thing's come up at work,
honey...

16
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,560
Daddy is not going to be
home for a while.

17
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:05,648
I don't understand.

18
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:08,856
You can't go back to the house Penny,
Okay?

19
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:11,218
What's happening?

20
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:14,768
It's alright.
You won't be alone.

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,614
You have Bolt.

22
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:19,545
I've altered him.

23
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:39,194
He can protect you now!

24
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:47,525
<i><b>BOLT</b></i>

25
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,440
Everything is positioning nicely.

26
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:12,908
There he is, Dr. Calico!

27
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:18,515
Any luck getting our guest
to spill his guts?

28
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:21,301
Oh, his guts will spill!

29
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:24,550
One way or another.

30
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:26,546
Never! I'll never talk.

31
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:29,472
Daddy!

32
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:31,652
You're beginning to irk me, professor.

33
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:37,672
I am irked and that will not do!
Has the package arrived?

34
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:43,308
I think it might make our dear friend, a bit more communicative.

35
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:45,547
I'm sending an agent to pick it up.

36
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:50,848
Gorgeous, have him bring it to me on the first flight?

37
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:06,372
Bolt, let's go!

38
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:35,619
We only need the girl!

39
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,357
- What?
- Where is Calico?

40
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,052
I'm not talking to you!

41
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,232
Bolivia, Bolivia,
Calico is in Bolivia.

42
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,231
Near Lake Rocriagudo!

43
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:25,109
Lake Rocriagudo,
I should have known!

44
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,023
Come on, Bolt,
Let's go.

45
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,548
Bolivia,
there's a flight leaving in 10 minutes.

46
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:16,648
Bolt, zoom zoom!

47
00:07:09,157 --> 00:07:10,723
Bolt, fetch.

48
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:29,759
Puppy!

49
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:52,004
Good boy!

50
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:53,721
Airport!

51
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,461
Bolt, speak!

52
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:47,055
Okay, okay...

53
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:48,564
Good job, buddy.

54
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,659
Mission accomplished!

55
00:09:54,972 --> 00:09:55,894
That's a keeper!

56
00:09:57,436 --> 00:10:00,599
It's alright, tough guy.
You got them all.

57
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,747
Don't worry, Bolt.
You've saved the day again.

58
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:24,819
<i>Good boy!</i>

59
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:26,502
<i>Airport!</i>

60
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:37,356
<i>Bolt, speak!</i>

61
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:43,337
- Boom mike!
- It's a boom mike.

62
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:47,079
That's sloppy!

63
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,114
The dog could have seen it.

64
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,289
He could have seen that.

65
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:54,562
Uh, who cares
if the dog sees a boom mike?

66
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,387
Forgive me for answering a question with a question!

67
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:03,804
But, who are you?

68
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:06,441
Mindy Parker,
from the network.

69
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:11,189
Of course... Let me ask you,
Mindy from the network.

70
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:13,784
What do you see here?

71
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:18,816
- The dog?
- The dog, she says.

72
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:24,220
O, Mindy... poor, poor Mindy!

73
00:11:24,423 --> 00:11:26,811
Am I... missing something?

74
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:29,324
You're missing everything, Mindy.

75
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:33,161
You see a dog...
I see an animal,

76
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:37,503
who believes with every fiber of his being...
every fiber...

77
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:40,587
That the girl he loves
is in mortal danger.

78
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:42,791
I see a depth of emotion on the face of that canine,

79
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:47,194
the likes of which has never been captured on screen before.

80
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:49,535
Never, Mindy from the network.

81
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:55,787
We jump through hoops to make sure that Bolt believes everything is real.

82
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,259
It's why we don't miss marks.
It's why we don't reshoot.

83
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,420
And it's we why most certainly,

84
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,497
do not let the dog see boom mikes.

85
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:10,032
Because, Mindy from the network...

86
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:14,111
if the dog believes it

87
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,422
the audience believes it.

88
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:24,818
Wow, okay, you want reality?
Here you go chief.

89
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:26,557
The show's too predictable

90
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:29,489
The girl's in danger, the dog saves her from the creepy English guy.

91
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,353
We get it, there's always a happy ending.

92
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:34,862
And, our focus groups tell us,
that 18 to 35 year-olds are unhappy.

93
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,575
They're not happy with happy.

94
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:38,874
So, maybe you should, I don't know,

95
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,344
spend a little less time worrying about the dog's method acting,

96
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:42,617
and more time into

97
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:44,221
figuring out how to stop
20 year-olds in Topeka

98
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,332
from changing the channel.

99
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:49,157
Because if you lose so much as
half a ratings point, so help me,

100
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:52,537
I will fire everyone in this room,
starting with you.

101
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:54,529
How's that for real?

102
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:00,490
There... perfect.

103
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:04,226
You saved me again, Bolt.

104
00:13:06,282 --> 00:13:07,981
It's okay,
it's nothing.

105
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:10,184
No more bad guys.

106
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:13,996
Ah? Are you hungry?

107
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,658
You got it, Bolt.

108
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:21,974
No one's going to hurt me.

109
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:25,358
Bolt look at me!

110
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:26,662
I'm fine, see?

111
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,738
Come here buddy! Come here!

112
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:34,844
Go get it Bolt!
Go get it!

113
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,426
Yeah, that one's no fun either.

114
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,050
Huh, well what do we have here?

115
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,521
Mr. Carrot.

116
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:06,568
Oh, Bolt!

117
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,924
You know I have to go.

118
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,865
Yeah, you're my good boy.

119
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:38,142
And there she is, my little superstar.

120
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,038
Let's get to that Teen Vogue cover shoot.

121
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:43,570
Mom, I want to take Bolt home this weekend.

122
00:14:43,644 --> 00:14:47,623
- Well, I, um...
- Ah, that would be nice, that would be great...

123
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:49,978
A little girl and her dog.

124
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,129
Nothing better than that.

125
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:57,234
So I can bring Bolt?

126
00:14:57,237 --> 00:15:02,762
As your friend, I say, Yes, absolutely,
but as your agent...

127
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:06,105
I have to remind you,
this is Bolt's world.

128
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,988
He has to stay right here, okay.

129
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:11,858
- Let's go!
- But, he never gets to be a real dog

130
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:14,778
and it would only be for the weekend,
and I just want...

131
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:19,174
But, you know what, it's a fair question,
Let's do this, let's put a pin in it?

132
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:20,937
Boop, pin in. There you go.

133
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,526
Now... Let's let that hang there for a bit

134
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:24,602
and then we'll address that when we've thought things through.

135
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:28,590
Okay, Good enough for everybody?
Smiles all around? Let's get out of here, come on.

136
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:31,870
But I don't need to think it through.
I want to take Bolt home.

137
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:35,969
Look at this face...
I have a little girl at home,

138
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:37,262
love of my life.

139
00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:39,146
I will do anything for her.

140
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,246
And I would trade her for you in a heartbeat.
...True story.

141
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:47,547
That reminds me, we need to be getting over to wardrobe,

142
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:48,665
quick, quick, let's go.

143
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:03,777
And so, the dog thinks this is all real??

144
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:07,577
Oh yeah, you're new. Guy never leaves the set.

145
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:11,695
It's unbelievable. Whenever I get a chance,
it's the perfect way to unwind.

146
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,830
I like to start with an evil laugh.

147
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:22,224
Hello, hairballs!

148
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:26,551
You may have won today Bolt,
But, in the end...

149
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:29,782
We will get your little Penny.

150
00:16:29,825 --> 00:16:33,303
Not likely, cat.
For you have chosen to follow the path of evil,

151
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,377
and ultimately, it will destroy you
along with your fiendish puppet master.

152
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:41,683
- Wow.
- I know, right. Watch this.

153
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:47,347
She's a goner, dog.
The green-eyed man has a plan,

154
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,793
and soon, he will execute it.

155
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:57,538
- Yeah. And then he will execute her.
- Nice.

156
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,170
I would super-bark you both back into the hole that you crawled out of,

157
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:02,518
but I need you alive,

158
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,931
because I've got a little message
for you to take back to your green-eyed man.

159
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:08,338
You tell him,
that his old friend, Bolt...

160
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,455
Is it long?

161
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:12,652
Is what long?
- The message!

162
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:16,586
Is it a long message?
Because I have a horrible memory.

163
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:19,170
I'll make it brief, all right?
You tell him, that I said that I'm gonna...

164
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,299
You know what? Why don't we do this?

165
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:24,989
You remember the first half of the message,
and then I remember the second,

166
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,354
then we can pass it on to the green-eyed man together.

167
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,731
I don't care how the message is translated.

168
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:31,841
Allright? Just do it! Okay?

169
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,766
Tell the green-eyed man

170
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:35,282
that I will not sleep, I will not rest,

171
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:36,791
until my Penny is safe

172
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:39,448
from his evil clutches.
You tell the green-eyed man...

173
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:42,262
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
way too many words,

174
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:45,185
I was like "What?"
and then I was like "Huh?"

175
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:48,354
and then I got a little bored.

176
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:49,982
Something about clutches.

177
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,886
Anyway, I'll do my best.
Ciao!

178
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:55,782
By the way, huge fan,
love it, love you, gotta go, thank you.

179
00:17:55,783 --> 00:18:00,723
Get back here, you sick, revolting...

180
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,842
Dogs!

181
00:18:08,236 --> 00:18:09,289
Cats!

182
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,910
I'll never let them get you, Penny.

183
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:39,403
You ready, Bolt?

184
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:46,585
Let's lighten out camera three,
ready four.

185
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,618
Go four.

186
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,649
And, driver!

187
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:00,279
Thanks, Larry.

188
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:05,692
Alright, Scooter. Light the grate.
Ready on the rubber bars.

189
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:11,717
And track with them!

190
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:16,603
The Calico supercomputer.

191
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,313
If we can access it

192
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:20,737
we can finally learn where they are keeping my father.

193
00:19:40,534 --> 00:19:41,400
The weapon's hot!

194
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:44,832
Heat vision time.

195
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:47,458
Bolt, stare!

196
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,108
Now!

197
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:03,765
Nice move.

198
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:07,684
Come on, come on.

199
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:14,913
Such devotion, it brings tears to my eyes.

200
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,565
Calico!

201
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:21,386
Your father's discoveries could be of great use to our

202
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,209
organization.

203
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:29,083
I'm sure, he'll be more accommodating,
now that I've got

204
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:31,108
his lucky Penny.

205
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:32,348
Bolt!

206
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:38,113
World domination is within my grasp.

207
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:52,493
How did your focus groups feel about cliff-hangers?

208
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:56,213
You asked for unhappy 18 to 35 year-olds.

209
00:20:56,214 --> 00:21:00,802
I give you,
unhappy 18 to 35 years-olds.

210
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:04,099
Bolt, it's okay.
I'm fine!

211
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,575
Whoa, whoa, guards stop her!

212
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,911
- Hey, Hey!
- Hold on!

213
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:14,098
- Listen to him. He needs to know that I'm okay.
- Nope, you're not okay.

214
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:17,200
You've been kidnapped by the fiendish
Dr. Calico.

215
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:19,501
At least, that's what the dog needs to think.

216
00:21:19,502 --> 00:21:23,053
Just imagine, close your eyes and
just imagine how excited he will be

217
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:26,323
when he saves you tomorrow, okay.

218
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:29,811
But, he will be freaking out all night,
just let me...

219
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:32,657
Whoa, wait a second,
what's that behind your ear?

220
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:36,503
Is that a... Yes, it is,
it's a pin.

221
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:40,410
Let's do this. Let's take the pin
and put it in this conversation.

222
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:41,145
Boop!

223
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,574
And we will not take it down, no ma'am,
until this matter is resolved.

224
00:21:44,816 --> 00:21:46,551
But I just...
- You know what that reminds me of...

225
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:50,487
the "DVD" release junket.
Let's get going, it's a big push.

226
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:58,696
Alright people, let's give her some air.
Let's not crowd the talent.

227
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,181
I've been working on my evil laugh.
It really is an evil laugh.

228
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:17,273
Here's the thing, you're not ready
for the evil laugh

229
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:18,140
you could do a chuckle,

230
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:22,376
like a mildly upset chuckle,
after my evil laugh. Never mind...

231
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:24,665
Hey, Bolt!

232
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:29,746
<i>Bolt, come back!</i>

233
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:34,394
I'm too late.

234
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:37,857
Bolt, help!
- I am coming, Penny.

235
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:40,400
<i>Bolt, help!</i>

236
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:44,951
Hold on, Penny.
Hold on.

237
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:47,505
<i>Bolt, help!</i>

238
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:50,304
<i>Bolt, help!</i>

239
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:02,228
Penny!

240
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,996
Bolt! here Bolt!

241
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:19,540
...

242
00:23:59,878 --> 00:24:04,009
Okay Bolty. Okay, stay cool.
You're cool, Bolty.

243
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,760
The green-eyed man!

244
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,176
Penny... Penny?

245
00:25:05,288 --> 00:25:05,914
Penny!

246
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:09,642
Target acquired!

247
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,841
It ends here!

248
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:36,536
Penny!

249
00:25:37,718 --> 00:25:40,324
Penny! ...
They moved her!

250
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:47,300
There's no time for formalities, brothers.

251
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:49,188
My person is in danger.
And I, I...

252
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,395
What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

253
00:25:52,988 --> 00:25:54,698
Do you want to sniff mine first?
- What?

254
00:25:54,895 --> 00:25:57,410
Not from around here, are you?
- Hey, stop it!

255
00:25:57,921 --> 00:25:58,792
This is serious!

256
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:04,617
Hey there, are you lost, sweetie?
Wait.

257
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:30,257
Why can't I bend these stupid bars?

258
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,592
Yo, Buddy!

259
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,903
You got your head stuck
pretty good, huh, guy?

260
00:26:38,611 --> 00:26:43,508
Hey, guys. Come here.
Check this out. He's got his melon stuck.

261
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:47,668
Yeah, that is one stuck melon.

262
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,156
Hey, hey, buddy.
Take it easy, slow down!

263
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:56,764
I will not take it easy, pheasant.
I am missing my person.

264
00:26:58,235 --> 00:27:04,258
Hey, buddy. Relax. Like this:
Turn and pull. Turn and pull.

265
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:06,797
Forget about it, you'll be out in no time.

266
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,420
What are these things?

267
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:22,834
They've weakened me.

268
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,594
Whoa. Well, they're Styrofoam packing peanuts.
- Styrofoam!

269
00:27:31,428 --> 00:27:33,448
This has the green-eyed man written all over it!

270
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,602
Have you seen the man with the green eye?

271
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,097
You know, I gotta say something,
if I could say something here

272
00:27:41,098 --> 00:27:44,373
You look familiar.
Joey, look at this guy's mug.

273
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:48,217
Yeah. You know? I could have sworn that
I've seen this guy before.

274
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:49,331
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

275
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:52,206
I gotta tell ya!
I never forget a face!

276
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:53,146
He never does.

277
00:27:53,196 --> 00:27:56,187
Yeah, yeah. He's real good with the faces and such.

278
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,252
Listen, listen, the man with the green eye,
tell me what you know, birds.

279
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:05,872
- I know this dog!
- Yeah, yeah. Me, too!

280
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:08,544
I've got to remember.
It's gonna kill me! Hold on...

281
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,104
No, I don't know. I, I, I thought I know.

282
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:21,256
Hey, did you ever hang out down on
14th street with a stray named Kelvin?

283
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:24,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Kelvin, the Labrador.
- What?

284
00:28:24,523 --> 00:28:28,366
You gotta give me something here,
cause this is redonkulous.

285
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:31,050
absolutely redonkulous!
- Capisch redonkulous.

286
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,984
Do you know what that means?

287
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:36,082
Ah, you pigeons are useless.
I need someone on the inside,

288
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:38,033
someone close to the green-eyed man.

289
00:28:39,472 --> 00:28:42,896
A cat!
- Who, a cat?

290
00:28:43,196 --> 00:28:46,523
Yeah, a cat, and when I find him...,

291
00:28:46,615 --> 00:28:50,005
when I find him, I will make that cat wish
that he'd never been born.

292
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:56,056
He-he, I think we know just the cat.

293
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,796
Right on time, Saul. Come on in.

294
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:07,986
Okay, Saul, nice work.

295
00:29:07,987 --> 00:29:09,342
Let's see if we can find some mustard next time,

296
00:29:09,343 --> 00:29:11,716
okay, babe?
- Yes, Mittens. Thank you, Mittens.

297
00:29:13,656 --> 00:29:16,410
Oh-Ho. Is that an everything bagel, Ted?

298
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:19,616
Attaboy!
- Good day, Mittens.

299
00:29:21,963 --> 00:29:22,652
Louie!

300
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:25,281
What is this?

301
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:34,608
You hear this, Louie?
I'm starving here!

302
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:37,606
And when the old stomach starts talking,

303
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:38,704
it ain't talking to me,

304
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:44,579
it's talking to the... claw.
- Not the claws. please.

305
00:29:44,704 --> 00:29:47,205
I'm holding these boys back the best that I can,

306
00:29:47,206 --> 00:29:52,737
The thing is, it's not up to me
the stomach's got a direct line to these babies

307
00:29:52,738 --> 00:29:56,336
and I'm picking up a lot of chatter.

308
00:29:56,605 --> 00:30:01,096
So I'll talk to the claws,
but in exchange, next week...

309
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,895
all your food comes to me.
- But, that's not our deal!

310
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:07,641
I give you half,
you give me protection.

311
00:30:07,642 --> 00:30:11,142
That's our deal!
- Yeah, well the deal just expired!

312
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:15,022
Now, get lost.
- Mark my words, Mittens,

313
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:20,928
one day, someone's gonna stand up to you,
someone's gonna teach you a lesson.

314
00:30:21,414 --> 00:30:23,268
Yeah, I'm really scared now...

315
00:30:24,164 --> 00:30:25,488
You should be!

316
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,308
Aaah... Okay... You!

317
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,457
Where is she?

318
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:32,466
Aaah,... who?
- You know why I'm here.

319
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:33,709
Aahh...
- Where is she?!

320
00:30:33,713 --> 00:30:37,965
Okay, okay, look buddy,
I - I don't know what you're getting at, but...

321
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:42,801
Come on, Mittens. Tell the guy where she is.

322
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:46,830
Tell the dog, make him happy.
- Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens. Tell him.

323
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:52,558
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!

324
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:55,777
Will you tell this crazy canine
that he's got the wrong cat?

325
00:30:57,798 --> 00:30:59,800
You got her, pal.
- That's her.

326
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:03,240
She's the one.
- That is definitely the right cat!

327
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,905
Looks like we're going to do this the hard way.

328
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:11,450
Whoa, aaah, you're crazy man?

329
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,149
Hey, Joey, did we go too far on this?

330
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:20,065
Are you kidding?
This is the best day of my life.

331
00:31:20,175 --> 00:31:23,416
You work for the man in black,
who works for the man with the green eye.

332
00:31:23,418 --> 00:31:25,730
They've taken, Penny.
Where is she?!

333
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:28,921
I don't know what you are talking about!
- This is becoming tiresome, cat!

334
00:31:28,926 --> 00:31:31,808
In fact, I feel a yawn coming on!

335
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:36,139
Okay, okay. I'll talk.
I know where Penny is!

336
00:31:36,754 --> 00:31:42,541
They have her. Yes,  the man in black
and the guy with the blue eyes!

337
00:31:42,546 --> 00:31:43,341
Blue eyes?!

338
00:31:43,787 --> 00:31:47,523
Ah... Oh, green, yes.
The one green eye.

339
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,481
You just can't stop lying.
Can you cat? It's in the genes.

340
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:52,846
It's gross!

341
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:56,952
I know, it's disgusting.
I disgust myself.

342
00:31:57,157 --> 00:31:59,677
Huh, Hollywood!

343
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:04,252
But, if you put me down
I'll show you where she is.

344
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:09,700
<i>Waffle World</i>

345
00:32:15,406 --> 00:32:18,609
You know, I hope you appreciate the risk I'm taking here.

346
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:24,037
Every bone in my evil cat body is
telling me not to betray the trust

347
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:25,145
of the green-eyed man.

348
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:31,232
Okay, this is a top,
top secret map,

349
00:32:31,237 --> 00:32:33,417
of the entire earth.

350
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,120
Now, we're over here, by the green lady with big torch,

351
00:32:39,122 --> 00:32:41,696
and my boss has Penny locked up...

352
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:48,490
uh,... right, right over... here,
here, by the waffle with the sunglasses.

353
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:51,792
Now, all you need to do is get from here to there.

354
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:58,122
Well, I told you where to find her, so,
if you untie me, I'll just be on my way.

355
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:01,185
I'll release you, cat,
when we find Penny.

356
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:04,817
Excuse me?! That wasn't the deal! We had a deal.

357
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:07,312
Your deal just expired!

358
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,824
She said that to me 10 minutes ago.

359
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:12,607
The Irony!

360
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:19,429
OOo, perfect!

361
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:26,862
Hum, padlocked.

362
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:34,592
Listen, "Cujo",
I've got some pretty wicked claws under these mitts.

363
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:38,372
Do not...
I repeat, do not, make me bring out these bad boys.

364
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:39,985
It gets ugly.

365
00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:44,540
What are you doing?
- Stay back!

366
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:48,797
If I stare at the lock really hard,
it will burst into flames and melt.

367
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,951
Now, I'm concerned on a number of levels.

368
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:55,041
Easy, watch it. Watch it though.
- Intruders!

369
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:58,272
Hey, slow down, you're scraping the fur off my...

370
00:34:02,294 --> 00:34:05,695
Oh, boy, this thing is heavy.
- Put it down.

371
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:07,481
I forgot the keys.

372
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,241
I'll be right back.

373
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:21,683
Hey, lucky penny.

374
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:24,517
Thanks, now move your butt.

375
00:34:24,825 --> 00:34:30,031
Okay! Up on your end
- You got yours...Yeah.

376
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,985
It's on the tip of my tongue.
I know that dog!

377
00:34:41,156 --> 00:34:45,770
I'm telling you, Joey, Bobby, you guys
are looking at me like, you don't know...

378
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:49,118
I'm telling you, I know this dog!
I seen him somewheres.

379
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:53,940
You'll remember it tonight when you're dreaming
-That's, that's what will happen.

380
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:22,112
I've got some... good news!
- Really?

381
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:27,333
Yes, I do, I've just booked you
on the Tonight Show, lead guest.

382
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:34,817
That's right, I...which means, absolutely nothing,
if Bolt is still missing.

383
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:39,023
It's not even good news, like whatever so what,
it's the Tonight Show, like who even cares. I don't care.

384
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,516
It's okay, baby.

385
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,947
He must be so scared.
- Scared? This is Bolt we're talking about!

386
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,856
He's not scared of anything.

387
00:35:52,214 --> 00:35:54,768
I bet Bolt would want you to do the Tonight Show!

388
00:35:55,011 --> 00:36:01,179
It's a... Maybe not.

389
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,954
Bolt loves you very much, sweetie,
and you're here.

390
00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:10,104
He couldn't have gone far.

391
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,770
<i>WELCOME TO OHIO</i>

392
00:36:17,294 --> 00:36:24,390
So, uh, if you got superpowers, I guess that would make you what,
like some kind of super dog?!

393
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:26,000
That information's classified.

394
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:29,894
Ah, come on! Like, like,
what's your best power-your go-to move?

395
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:31,835
How about flying...?
Can you fly?

396
00:36:32,652 --> 00:36:34,747
Don't be silly. I can't fly.

397
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:40,058
Okay, fine. If you don't have any powers,
you don't have any powers... what's it to me?

398
00:36:42,097 --> 00:36:46,448
- I have super-bark.
- A super-bark, wow, you're kidding me?

399
00:36:49,036 --> 00:36:52,496
Uh, what exactly does one do with a super-bark?

400
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:56,240
I really can't talk about it.
It's classified.

401
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,033
I suggest you pipe down
and take me to Penny.

402
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:02,521
You're awfully attached to this Penny character?

403
00:37:03,406 --> 00:37:07,063
She's my person.
- Please, she's a person.

404
00:37:07,065 --> 00:37:11,464
And if you ask me
the only good person, is a...

405
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:17,502
Styrofoam!

406
00:37:17,832 --> 00:37:18,911
Tuck and roll.

407
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,710
Tuck and...what?

408
00:37:35,802 --> 00:37:42,525
Oo, what, what is this
red liquid coming from my paw?

409
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:44,690
It's called blood, hero!

410
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:47,969
Do I need it?
- Yes!

411
00:37:48,442 --> 00:37:51,993
So if you want to keep it inside your body where it belongs,

412
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,544
You should stop jumping out of trucks doing 80 on the interstate.

413
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:59,594
Yeah, well normally, I am a tad more indestructible.
It must have been the...

414
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:03,649
Styrofoam,
That stuff. It weakens me.

415
00:38:04,818 --> 00:38:09,272
What are you doing? Put that down!
- That's it. I've had it with you. Untie me, pooch!

416
00:38:09,273 --> 00:38:16,171
Or I'm gonna...Uh, uh, I'm going to seriously wound you,
I'm going to seriously wound you with this Styrofoam.

417
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:20,906
Are you mad? You don't know the power of Styrofoam
- Oh, you bet I'm mad, baby,

418
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:25,364
and I'm about to unleash it,
the power... of the Styrofoam.

419
00:38:25,365 --> 00:38:29,150
Alright cat, you win.
I'll untie you.

420
00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:34,192
That's a weird place to put a piano?!

421
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:41,643
Are we going to have anymore problems, cat?
- No, no, no more problems.

422
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:43,505
I'll take you to Penny.

423
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,871
What is that?

424
00:38:49,148 --> 00:38:50,840
What?
- That!

425
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:54,664
Okay, you have 2 seconds to tell me what you've implanted in me, cat.

426
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:57,845
Poison, parasite?! Poison?
What, I just said that, didn't I?

427
00:38:58,101 --> 00:39:00,482
See, I'm all discombobulated.
I can't think straight.

428
00:39:00,483 --> 00:39:03,118
I don't believe this.
You're hungry!

429
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:07,454
Where is the antidote?
- Okay, okay, alright!

430
00:39:11,543 --> 00:39:13,754
There's your antidote.

431
00:39:14,654 --> 00:39:15,699
Food!

432
00:39:20,911 --> 00:39:23,364
Go on, use the "dog face".
It's gonna be beautiful..

433
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:29,824
You know, beg.
Do the "dog face".

434
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:33,548
What, "the dog face", what does that mean?

435
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:38,045
Figures, I'm tied to the one dog on earth
who doesn't know how to beg, huh.

436
00:39:38,046 --> 00:39:41,961
Okay, if you want the foo... ah, the antidote,

437
00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:44,933
you're gonna have to do exactly what I say.

438
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:50,376
Nah, not likely.
You're a degenerate creature of darkness.

439
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:54,183
Yeah, yeah, granted, but that said, all I'm asking you to do is

440
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:57,163
tilt your head a little. You can do that, can't ya? Come on.

441
00:39:58,817 --> 00:40:02,108
More, more, ...
- This is stupid!

442
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:04,826
No, no, come on, work with me a little on this.
You're almost there.

443
00:40:04,831 --> 00:40:05,974
Oh, boy!

444
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,576
Okay, try it the other way.

445
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,115
There you go, Tilt up. Down. Now a little smile.

446
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:18,043
Nah, lose the smile. Drop your left ear.
Your other left.

447
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:22,635
Okay, the other way was better, drop them both.
Hold it right there.

448
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,700
And ever so slightly look up.

449
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:28,556
Soup is on, baby!

450
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:42,188
Ah, here you go.

451
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:44,521
Yes!

452
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,288
Ah, look at the little guy!

453
00:40:56,377 --> 00:40:57,590
Get out of here, stupid cat!

454
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:45,829
Well, hello puppy! Did you come for
some of Grandma's butter bean dumplings?

455
00:41:46,933 --> 00:41:48,081
You wait right there.

456
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:59,061
Look at you, you're quite the little actor.

457
00:41:59,927 --> 00:42:05,411
I haven't eaten like this in ages.
Hey, look my stomach's distended! How great is that!

458
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:08,493
Yeah, well, don't get used to it, we gotta to keep moving.

459
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,480
But, this, this place is a goldmine,
What's wrong with you?

460
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:15,975
Every week, new RVs bring us new suckers,
who bring us new food.

461
00:42:16,438 --> 00:42:18,993
Look around... it's perfect!

462
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:29,071
Do my eyes deceive me?
Is this some apparition that I see before me?

463
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:33,857
Or could it be...
My hero!

464
00:42:33,858 --> 00:42:42,519
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
You're Bolt, the super dog. Really very awesome!

465
00:42:43,387 --> 00:42:45,687
Wait a minute,
you know this dog?

466
00:42:45,692 --> 00:42:51,021
Oh, I do. He is very awesome.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've established that.

467
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,157
Who are you ?
- I'm Rhino.

468
00:42:53,288 --> 00:42:55,547
Rhino, the hamster.

469
00:42:55,548 --> 00:43:00,054
Well, my ancestry isn't all hamster,
I'm 1/16 wolf...

470
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:04,103
you know, with a little wolverine in there...
but, but, but, that's beside the point.

471
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,865
We have before us a legend.
Bolt... the super dog.

472
00:43:08,997 --> 00:43:14,488
He can outrun speeding missiles, and...
burn through solid metal with his heat vision

473
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:20,149
OOo, ooh, and best of all,
he can obliterate large structures with his super-bark...

474
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:20,955
Wait a minute!

475
00:43:20,956 --> 00:43:22,969
You've seen the super-bark?!

476
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:28,175
Have you been observing me?
- Oh, yeah, I watch you all the time!

477
00:43:28,293 --> 00:43:30,890
That's incredible!
- Ah, it's nothing, really.

478
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:34,584
But, I'm always so vigilant...
No one could invade my detection.

479
00:43:35,729 --> 00:43:40,967
You're a phantom.
- Uh, if you say so. Oh, hey, check it out.

480
00:43:42,405 --> 00:43:46,109
Take a gander at this Bolt action.
Scary, huh?

481
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:51,755
It's like we're twins.
- Yeah... scary.

482
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:56,760
So, where's Penny?
- She was kidnapped by the green-eyed man.

483
00:43:56,765 --> 00:44:01,529
Kidnapped? This is terrible,
She could be in grave...

484
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,518
Grave danger. I know,
but I've captured this cat.

485
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:08,556
An agent of the green-eyed man, I presume.

486
00:44:08,557 --> 00:44:11,428
Oh ho, you presume correctly.
She's taking me to Penny.

487
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:14,932
You, you are vile vermin.

488
00:44:15,143 --> 00:44:22,137
How do you sleep at night?
Penny's the most wonderful person ever, and she's all soft.

489
00:44:22,179 --> 00:44:25,612
And he's awesome, and you're a monster!

490
00:44:25,645 --> 00:44:30,175
How dare you disrupt their relationship with your evil...

491
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,437
Die, die...
- Whoa, whoa!

492
00:44:32,438 --> 00:44:36,514
I can take her, Bolty.
- Easy, easy, Rhino.

493
00:44:38,903 --> 00:44:41,762
You're right.
We need her alive!

494
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:48,160
Eh, we?!
- Yes. Bolt, I can be a valuable addition to your team.

495
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:50,584
I'm listening.
- I'm lightning quick.

496
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:55,243
I have razor-sharp reflexes and I'm a master of stealth.

497
00:44:56,054 --> 00:44:59,185
Plus, I'll keep the cat in check.

498
00:45:00,229 --> 00:45:02,741
The road will be rough!
- I have a ball.

499
00:45:02,871 --> 00:45:06,408
There's no turning back.
- I guess I'll have to roll with the punches.

500
00:45:06,448 --> 00:45:09,342
Easy won't be part of the equation.
- Promise.

501
00:45:09,489 --> 00:45:13,452
Gotta warn you. We're going into the belly of the beast,
danger at every turn.

502
00:45:13,543 --> 00:45:16,973
I eat danger for breakfast.
- Are you hungry?

503
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:20,816
Starving!
- Welcome, aboard!

504
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:25,286
Hey, can we talk for a second?

505
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,183
I don't know what's going on here, but
I'm just a little bit concerned

506
00:45:30,184 --> 00:45:32,190
about the number of lunatics on this trip.

507
00:45:32,784 --> 00:45:35,626
My limit is one.
- He's coming with us!

508
00:45:35,631 --> 00:45:40,638
But I...  - Move it prisoner,
we're losing daylight.

509
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:41,314
I agree.

510
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:44,593
Now, we need to find a fast set of wheels.

511
00:45:44,594 --> 00:45:48,348
Oh, I've got a better idea.
Follow me.

512
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:05,654
Okay, so what we do here is give the target
a quick fly over, we adjust the trajectory

513
00:46:05,655 --> 00:46:08,761
and land dead center.
Am I missing anything, Rhino?

514
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:13,582
Just the knowledge, that every minute spent in your
company becomes the new greatest minute of my life.

515
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:18,727
No, uh-uh, forget it!
How do you say, "No way, I'm not doing this!" in crazy?

516
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:21,997
Calm down, cat. You're with me.
- That's the problem!

517
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:28,688
Oh, would you relax! Every time he did this
on the magic box, it was awesome!

518
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,563
Magic what?

519
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:36,745
You know, the magic box people stare at.

520
00:46:36,746 --> 00:46:42,048
OOo, wait does this magic box have moving pictures on it?
- Yeah, and Bolt's pictures are the best!

521
00:46:42,053 --> 00:46:47,839
Bolt's pictures. Of course, he's a...
Oh no, oh no. Stop, wait!

522
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:55,424
- Let it begin! Let it begin! Let it begin...
- Wait, you are not a super...

523
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,325
What are you doing?

524
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,605
Mittens!

525
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,895
Mittens, take my paw.
I need you alive.

526
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,649
You're crazy.
Stay away from me.

527
00:47:26,587 --> 00:47:30,058
Take my paw, I'll save you.
- No, you won't.

528
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:31,681
You're not really a...

529
00:47:48,754 --> 00:47:49,642
Bolt!

530
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:53,908
Saboteur!

531
00:47:56,061 --> 00:47:58,880
Ouch! You're moron! stop it! I'm trying to help him.

532
00:47:58,885 --> 00:48:01,535
Help him? Yeah, right!

533
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,659
Don't' worry Bolt,
I'll stop her!

534
00:48:15,552 --> 00:48:16,671
I can't hold him.

535
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:24,398
Let go, you monster!
- Bolt!

536
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:58,649
The real world hurts, doesn't it?
But, you wouldn't know about that, would you?

537
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,947
Get down here, cat!
We don't have time for this.

538
00:49:00,952 --> 00:49:02,463
I'll get a ladder.

539
00:49:03,781 --> 00:49:06,925
Look genius, you're part of a TV show.

540
00:49:07,063 --> 00:49:08,897
Do ya know what that is, TV?

541
00:49:08,898 --> 00:49:11,258
I mean, do you really that you were born

542
00:49:11,259 --> 00:49:13,137
with a birthmark, and the exact

543
00:49:13,138 --> 00:49:15,004
shape of a lightning, Bolt?

544
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:18,117
It's my mark of power, cat.

545
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:20,514
It's a mark of a makeup artist, dog.

546
00:49:20,515 --> 00:49:22,621
You're ridiculous. Now, get down here!

547
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:29,391
No! - Mittens, so help me, I will super-bark you out of that tree.

548
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:35,007
Yeah, Go nuts. Let's see how that works out for you.
- You leave me no choice.

549
00:49:43,304 --> 00:49:46,673
Oh, the super-bark.
Scary, scary!

550
00:49:46,928 --> 00:49:49,420
Yeah, that's really, really super.

551
00:49:51,717 --> 00:49:53,743
It's not true. This is not true.

552
00:49:58,135 --> 00:50:01,117
Wow, that one felt really super.

553
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:03,293
Wait!
No, it didn't.

554
00:50:04,905 --> 00:50:08,657
Okay, okay. Uh huh, I get the idea.
You can stop now.

555
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,294
That's enough! Seriously, dog, stop.
I'm not kidding.

556
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:15,484
Would you stop?!
Uh...

557
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:23,383
Okay fine, you're a super dog.
Bolt, Be quiet please.

558
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,398
Bolt, we've got to run.

559
00:50:26,253 --> 00:50:28,347
Bolt!
- Come here!

560
00:50:49,728 --> 00:50:51,105
<i>Lost Dog BOLT</i>

561
00:50:58,845 --> 00:51:02,859
Look who we found, young lady!
It's Bolt.

562
00:51:02,904 --> 00:51:08,919
They found him.
- Bolt! - That's right, the little puppy dog.

563
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:15,679
That is not Bolt.

564
00:51:16,886 --> 00:51:20,106
Well, that depends on how you look at it.

565
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:25,277
You know, when I was little,
I wanted a bicycle for my birthday,

566
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:27,875
but my parents, got me a baseball glove...

567
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:34,588
So, you know what I did? I pretended that the
baseball glove was a bicycle.

568
00:51:35,122 --> 00:51:36,925
And I rode it to school everyday.

569
00:51:37,771 --> 00:51:38,625
True story.

570
00:51:39,819 --> 00:51:43,574
It's not him.
- I think it's him, I do.

571
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,098
Thank you.

572
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:49,057
Look, kid. It's time we were honest with you.

573
00:51:49,535 --> 00:51:52,303
If we don't get back into production,
people will lose their jobs.

574
00:51:52,306 --> 00:51:55,778
Good people, with families.
- But. Bolt's still out there.

575
00:51:56,232 --> 00:51:59,064
We feel for you,
and the last thing that we want to do

576
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:02,824
is ask a little girl to make a
grown-up decision but it's come to that.

577
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:04,921
We need you to move on.

578
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:08,966
We need you to let Bolt go.

579
00:52:34,345 --> 00:52:38,681
It...must...be made of Styrofoam.

580
00:52:39,271 --> 00:52:42,662
No, no, no. It can't end like this.

581
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:46,091
Stop worrying, cat. I will get us out of here.

582
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,799
You can't, Bolt!
You've got nothing.

583
00:52:48,145 --> 00:52:49,949
No super strength,
No super-bark!

584
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,437
and no heat vision.

585
00:52:54,285 --> 00:52:59,706
Listen, okay. We are being taken to a
place where people go animal shopping.

586
00:52:59,711 --> 00:53:02,970
And this is what humans do.
They always pick the cute ones.

587
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:04,952
The ones that look like you, Bolt!

588
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:07,639
But the rest of us,
never come back out.

589
00:53:07,644 --> 00:53:09,707
I said I will get us out of here, alright?!

590
00:53:20,076 --> 00:53:21,379
My hero!

591
00:53:36,457 --> 00:53:40,303
Ring, ring! Who is it?
Destiny!

592
00:53:41,569 --> 00:53:44,145
I've been expecting your call!

593
00:54:19,841 --> 00:54:24,466
Oh, would you give it up already?
You're liquefying, whatever brains you have left.

594
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:29,326
I cannot be contained,
in any container.

595
00:54:29,444 --> 00:54:31,881
You quitter, watch this!

596
00:54:40,028 --> 00:54:42,249
I did it, I'm back!

597
00:54:43,645 --> 00:54:45,876
That Styrofoam is wicked stuff.

598
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:51,357
Totally awesome! There's no truck I know of
that can keep in Bolt and Rhino.

599
00:54:51,898 --> 00:54:54,977
Rhino, what are you doing here?

600
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:58,697
Oh, nothing. I enjoying an evening
stroll and thought that I would just

601
00:54:58,698 --> 00:55:02,027
pop the latch on that containment unit.

602
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:08,103
You opened the door?!
- Yes, I did. Yoink.

603
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,450
That, that's great, Rhino. That's really good.

604
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:16,836
Alright, let's go get the prisoner back.

605
00:55:32,824 --> 00:55:34,103
I can't do it.

606
00:55:37,307 --> 00:55:38,685
What did you say?

607
00:55:39,617 --> 00:55:43,098
I can't.
- What, who are you?

608
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,574
I am not... You just, just...

609
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:48,098
You are Bolt! - But I am Not.

610
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:51,925
Who single-handedly destroyed the
green-eyed man's under sea's labs? - Me

611
00:55:51,926 --> 00:55:57,439
And who foiled his plan to infiltrate
the Olympics with gymnastic cyborgs?

612
00:55:57,444 --> 00:56:00,607
Who, Bolt, who?
- Me. But, none of that...

613
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:03,175
You! You can Bolt!

614
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:08,324
Because all over this planet,
there are animals who feel like they can't.

615
00:56:08,852 --> 00:56:15,011
Like a little hamster,
who once spent his days in an RV park,

616
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:20,027
dreaming of the day, when he too,
would save a little girl from danger

617
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:20,760
and be told...

618
00:56:20,992 --> 00:56:28,463
"You did it. You did it, Rhino. You saved the day!"
They need a hero, Bolt!

619
00:56:28,442 --> 00:56:32,842
Someone, who no matter what the odds,
will do what's right.

620
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:35,651
They need a hero,
to tell them sometimes...

621
00:56:35,702 --> 00:56:42,064
the impossible can become possible.
If you're awesome!

622
00:56:43,491 --> 00:56:47,202
Well, you're right about one thing, Rhino.

623
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:49,199
Mittens does need a hero.

624
00:56:51,843 --> 00:56:53,298
I guess, I'll have to do.

625
00:56:53,654 --> 00:56:58,511
Such modesty!
Now, who's going to save that cat?

626
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:00,487
Me!
- Who, tell me, who?

627
00:57:00,492 --> 00:57:01,406
Me!

628
00:57:04,147 --> 00:57:05,419
I'll get my ball.

629
00:57:06,312 --> 00:57:08,334
<i>Elmwood County Animal Shelter</i>

630
00:57:21,395 --> 00:57:22,083
Over there!

631
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,531
There it is!

632
00:57:32,046 --> 00:57:37,071
This will be just like the time
you infiltrated Calico's arctic hover base.

633
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,326
It's not going to be exactly like that, Rhino.

634
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:43,179
We're going to have to do things a little differently.

635
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:47,531
Oh, stealth mode!

636
00:57:51,392 --> 00:57:54,202
Goodnight, Esther!
- Night, Lloyd!

637
00:58:01,704 --> 00:58:02,537
Lloyd!

638
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:10,471
Lloyd Spoon, you jump out and scare me
and I'm gonna pepper spray ya again.

639
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:17,578
I swear, it's like I work with toddlers.

640
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,091
The rat nullified.

641
00:58:28,288 --> 00:58:30,606
I feel alive!
- Shhh!

642
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:36,547
There's a guard!

643
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:38,307
I'll snap his neck!

644
00:58:38,629 --> 00:58:40,759
We need to get him away from that door.

645
00:58:48,937 --> 00:58:52,501
Ball! - Ball! - Ball!
- Ball! - Ball!

646
00:58:56,244 --> 00:59:01,809
Oh, just..., Can't you just..., I'm reading..., Ah...

647
00:59:13,548 --> 00:59:14,586
Mittens?!

648
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:17,026
Bolt!?

649
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,854
Wh,,,wha,what are you doing here?
- I'm busting you out!

650
00:59:22,149 --> 00:59:27,475
You - you came all the way back here, for me?
- Yeah.

651
00:59:28,257 --> 00:59:31,366
But how'd you, I mean you don't have any superpowers!

652
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:32,703
I know.
- Really?!

653
00:59:33,026 --> 00:59:34,227
Yeah.
- Wow!

654
00:59:34,591 --> 00:59:37,840
Crazy day for ya, huh?
- It's been a lot, yes. It has.

655
00:59:38,169 --> 00:59:40,422
Are you ready for this?
- No.

656
00:59:40,582 --> 00:59:41,639
Me neither.

657
00:59:43,991 --> 00:59:48,147
Hey, hey, hey, what is twisting your giblets?

658
00:59:48,473 --> 00:59:51,979
What? Where did you get that hamster?
Give it, give it.

659
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,963
Wait!
- Initiating escape.

660
01:00:02,192 --> 01:00:07,567
Hey, Lloyd, lock the door!
Lock the door!

661
01:00:07,673 --> 01:00:09,952
Superbark!
Superbark!

662
01:00:33,486 --> 01:00:38,886
Sweet Sister Frances!
What did you do to my new truck?

663
01:00:41,322 --> 01:00:42,563
Sally Esther!

664
01:00:43,783 --> 01:00:48,055
Both you boys need serious help.
- Spicy eyes!

665
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:54,565
We need a ride.
- Oo, I've got a big one!

666
01:00:55,116 --> 01:00:56,007
You're welcome!

667
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:18,011
I can't believe it, my whole life
I've wanted to see a real live superbark.

668
01:01:19,629 --> 01:01:22,831
You are legendary.

669
01:01:35,207 --> 01:01:42,508
Mittens, if..., if I don't chase bad guys,
then what am I?

670
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:44,651
I mean, what...

671
01:01:47,334 --> 01:01:54,096
Aah, don't worry about it! Being a regular dog
is like the greatest gig in the world, okay?

672
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:57,298
Look, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

673
01:01:57,577 --> 01:01:59,032
A little secret. A little known cat secret.

674
01:01:59,664 --> 01:02:03,267
You know why we hate dogs?
Because we want to be dogs.

675
01:02:03,273 --> 01:02:05,046
We have dog complexes.

676
01:02:05,851 --> 01:02:08,943
But, what do dogs do?

677
01:02:09,342 --> 01:02:12,089
Slobber, sleep, chase tails, chew shoes.

678
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:13,756
You don't exactly need a master's degree.

679
01:02:14,295 --> 01:02:16,541
You know, most dogs live in a place like this.

680
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:22,777
- And I don't know, they do things like...
- Out of this? But, but...

681
01:02:22,821 --> 01:02:25,698
And this is your dog bowl.
- What is?

682
01:02:25,703 --> 01:02:30,003
This! The entire floor.
If it hits the ground, it goes to the hound.

683
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:31,448
How cool is that?

684
01:02:32,626 --> 01:02:37,783
And on cold nights, this and a ball of yarn.
Boy.

685
01:02:37,784 --> 01:02:39,048
It doesn't get better than that.

686
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:43,068
You... seem to know a lot about these places.

687
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:47,407
Yeah, I did my time in one of these,
but I'm more of an alley cat at heart, you know?

688
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:49,946
sprung out first chance I got, never looked back.

689
01:02:52,115 --> 01:02:58,100
Rhino is awesome!
He's so awesome!

690
01:02:58,028 --> 01:03:03,683
He's beyond awesome,
he's... be-awesome.

691
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:05,691
He's a...

692
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:09,827
I am... be-awesome.

693
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:18,688
I think it's about time I introduce
you to the regular dog

694
01:03:18,786 --> 01:03:20,394
piece d'resistance.

695
01:03:22,723 --> 01:03:24,870
Go ahead, stick your head out.
- Why?

696
01:03:25,195 --> 01:03:26,279
Just do it.

697
01:03:32,712 --> 01:03:34,745
This is awesome!

698
01:03:36,491 --> 01:03:38,546
And stick your tongue out!

699
01:03:42,544 --> 01:03:45,639
This is totally awesome!
You should try it.

700
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:48,806
Ah, no thanks.
It's really a dog thing.

701
01:03:55,615 --> 01:04:00,140
<i>I have got so much to give,</i>

702
01:04:00,883 --> 01:04:03,587
<i>I swear I do.</i>

703
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:08,426
<i>I may not have nine lives,</i>

704
01:04:08,632 --> 01:04:12,401
<i>this one feels brand new.</i>

705
01:04:13,268 --> 01:04:16,977
<i>Yes I've lived a good one.</i>

706
01:04:17,871 --> 01:04:20,822
<i>I have tried to be true.</i>

707
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:26,055
<i>There are some things I never realized,</i>

708
01:04:26,692 --> 01:04:29,295
<i>till I met you.</i>

709
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:34,060
<i>How the wind feels on </i>

710
01:04:34,178 --> 01:04:37,747
<i>my cheeks,</i>

711
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:46,848
<i>when I'm barking at the moon.
</i>

712
01:04:47,106 --> 01:04:51,692
<i>There is no home like the one you've got,</i>

713
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:56,668
<i>cuz that home belongs to you.</i>

714
01:04:58,355 --> 01:05:02,743
<i>Woo-Hoo! Here I come.</i>

715
01:05:02,746 --> 01:05:06,803
<i>Woo-Hoo! Back to you.</i>

716
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:11,196
<i>There is no home like the one you've got,</i>

717
01:05:11,197 --> 01:05:15,234
<i>cuz that home belongs to you.</i>

718
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:19,921
<i>Well I was in trouble, bad.</i>

719
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,137
<i>I was so confused.</i>

720
01:05:24,138 --> 01:05:28,508
<i>I may not see in color babe,</i>

721
01:05:28,715 --> 01:05:32,363
<i>but I sure can feel blue.</i>

722
01:05:32,892 --> 01:05:37,127
<i>I have been a lot of things,</i>

723
01:05:37,499 --> 01:05:41,004
<i>they may not all be true.</i>

724
01:05:41,283 --> 01:05:45,839
<i>My experience was so mysterious,</i>

725
01:05:46,911 --> 01:05:49,543
<i>till I met you.</i>

726
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:54,204
<i>Now the sun will rise</i>

727
01:05:54,274 --> 01:05:58,050
<i>in the east,</i>

728
01:05:58,243 --> 01:06:02,923
<i>but I'm barking at...</i>

729
01:06:02,924 --> 01:06:06,851
<i>the moon.</i>

730
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:11,687
<i>There is no home like the one you've got,</i>

731
01:06:11,777 --> 01:06:15,985
<i>cuz that home belongs to you.</i>

732
01:06:18,387 --> 01:06:22,636
<i>Woo-Hoo! Here I come.</i>

733
01:06:22,641 --> 01:06:26,391
<i>Woo-Hoo! Back to you.</i>

<i>cuz that home belongs to you.</i>

740
01:07:06,629 --> 01:07:08,761
Hey! Hey, Bolt... wake up!

741
01:07:10,108 --> 01:07:12,953
Come on. I've got a surprise for ya.

742
01:07:14,267 --> 01:07:15,784
Okay, no peeking.

743
01:07:16,635 --> 01:07:19,781
Alright now, open them.

744
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:24,847
Bask in the glow, baby.

745
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:27,821
Just let me give you the grand tour.

746
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:33,698
This one is mine,
and this one is all yours

747
01:07:34,154 --> 01:07:37,580
Mittens, I...
- Oo, I found this really soft pillow thing for you.

748
01:07:37,581 --> 01:07:43,040
and get this, I found some Styrofoam and stuffed it inside,
which I thought it was kind of creative and ironic

749
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:43,853
you know what I mean?

750
01:07:43,855 --> 01:07:48,289
Mittens, I don't think...
- Oo, check this out! Total privacy.

751
01:07:48,533 --> 01:07:50,714
and completely soundproof.

752
01:07:50,715 --> 01:07:54,746
Yeah, well, I don't think that...
- Okay, I lied, it's not completely soundproof, but you...

753
01:07:54,747 --> 01:07:56,630
Mittens, I can't stay here!

754
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:02,939
What?
- We're one waffle away from Penny.

755
01:08:04,032 --> 01:08:06,825
You're still going back to her?

756
01:08:07,777 --> 01:08:09,993
Mittens, she's my person.

757
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:20,764
Look at me, Bolt! I'm real.

758
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:23,845
Now, how about this?
Is that real?

759
01:08:24,175 --> 01:08:28,030
Does this look real to you,
or that? Is that real?

760
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:33,630
Or that, how about that Bolt?
She's an actress!

761
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:37,781
She's jsut pretending.
- Not, Penny!

762
01:08:37,786 --> 01:08:41,538
There is no Penny!
She's fake.

763
01:08:41,543 --> 01:08:43,425
No, you're wrong. She loves me!

764
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:47,016
No, Bolt, that's what they do, okay?

765
01:08:47,017 --> 01:08:50,608
they act like they love you,
they act like they will be there forever

766
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:53,447
then one day they pack up all their stuff and move away,

767
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:59,348
and take their love with them,
and leave their declawed cat behind to fend for herself!

768
01:09:04,882 --> 01:09:06,570
They leave her...

769
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:11,408
Wondering what she did wrong?

770
01:09:13,492 --> 01:09:19,222
That... I'm sorry, Mittens, but...

771
01:09:21,248 --> 01:09:22,927
Penny is different.

772
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:27,286
Then go!

773
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:31,886
Mittens, I...
- Get out of here, Bolt!

774
01:09:33,074 --> 01:09:35,480
I never should have taken pity on you.

775
01:09:36,368 --> 01:09:38,620
Aw, Mittens...
- Get out of here, Bolt!

776
01:09:48,261 --> 01:09:49,985
You take care, Mittens.

777
01:10:27,342 --> 01:10:30,974
That meat lover's pizza is not loving me back at all.

778
01:10:32,286 --> 01:10:35,757
Hey, there, Rhino.
- Morning, cat.

779
01:10:37,063 --> 01:10:40,827
Where's Bolt?
- He's a...

780
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,885
He's gone.
- Bolt... left?

781
01:10:46,381 --> 01:10:51,955
Yea... But he a... he instructed me to tell you...that, em

782
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:55,096
He had to face the green-eyed man alone.

783
01:10:58,805 --> 01:11:02,149
Whoa, where are you going?
- To Bolt!

784
01:11:02,321 --> 01:11:05,065
But he doesn't need us anymore.

785
01:11:05,587 --> 01:11:08,637
Trust me, I've seen it a million times before.

786
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:11,393
In the cold dark night, before the battle,

787
01:11:11,394 --> 01:11:15,521
when the steely fangs of evil are sharpened,
and posed to strike

788
01:11:15,524 --> 01:11:18,395
the hero must go and face his greatest challenge...

789
01:11:18,396 --> 01:11:19,466
alone!

790
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:22,570
But, if Bolt's taught me anything,

791
01:11:22,954 --> 01:11:26,471
it's that you never abandon a friend in times of need!

792
01:11:27,527 --> 01:11:30,218
When your teammate's in trouble, you go.

793
01:11:30,613 --> 01:11:32,908
Whether they ask or not, you go!

794
01:11:33,135 --> 01:11:35,554
not knowing if you are coming back dead or alive...

795
01:11:35,555 --> 01:11:37,460
He went the other way!

796
01:11:37,664 --> 01:11:40,170
... you go! Knowing how deep the shrapnel

797
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:42,233
pierces your hide, you go!

No way, wow, Bolt!
I'm a really big fan of yours, brother.

801

I'm... Wait, this is my partner, Tom.

Tom say, What's up!

803
01:12:17,009 --> 01:12:18,191
What's up?
- Wow!

804
01:12:18,192 --> 01:12:21,050
Oh! And, this is our personal assistant, Billy,

805
01:12:21,051 --> 01:12:23,070
who was supposed to wait up on the wire.

806
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:26,357
Bolt, I've admired you for such a long time and
there's always something that I wanted to tell you

807
01:12:26,358 --> 01:12:27,409
if I ever get a chance to meet you, and now.

808
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,491
Billy, that was horrifying, What you just did.

809
01:12:29,496 --> 01:12:32,745
Why don't you make yourself useful and get me some bread crumbs? Go!

810
01:12:32,746 --> 01:12:34,842
Whole wheat is not the same as whole grain, Billy!

811
01:12:34,843 --> 01:12:37,967
Not the same, Billy!
- Do not come back here with whole wheat! - Or pumpernickel, Billy

812
01:12:37,972 --> 01:12:41,691
Okay guys, I really got to get going.
- Yeah, I know that your a busy dog.

813
01:12:41,693 --> 01:12:44,414
But, if you have a second,
we would love to pitch you an idea for your show.

814
01:12:44,419 --> 01:12:48,028
Tom's better pitching. I will let him take it from here.
Tommy's got the spotlight

815
01:12:51,392 --> 01:12:52,715
Wait for it!

816
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,890
Aliens!
- O, snap!

817
01:12:57,038 --> 01:13:00,637
Aliens?
- Audiences love aliens!

818
01:13:00,733 --> 01:13:04,050
It willl be huge man, huge!
- Trust us!

819
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:10,583
I love it, tell you what,
if you guys can help me find Penny,

820
01:13:10,587 --> 01:13:12,582
that girl from the television show,

821
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:16,543
I'd love to hear more about this aliens idea,
but on the way.

822
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:21,112
We got a nibble!
- Don't freak out, this is how you blew it with "Nemo".

823
01:13:39,595 --> 01:13:44,772
And as the alien tractor beam is pulling Penny
toward the mothership, we fade to black.

824
01:13:44,784 --> 01:13:48,619
And we have a great pop song for the end credits.
- Talk to your people.

825

We are ready to move on this.

01:14:05,651 --> 01:14:08,544

At long last, we have arrived at the belly of the beast.

831
01:14:33,517 --> 01:14:36,770
The lair of the green-eyed man!

832
01:14:37,419 --> 01:14:38,315
Wait up!

833
01:14:38,316 --> 01:14:39,026
Hold up!

834
01:14:41,948 --> 01:14:44,865
What's the problem?
I'm pumped!

835
01:14:45,492 --> 01:14:50,770
Listen,... this may be really hard for you to really understand,

836
01:14:50,771 --> 01:14:53,666
but, you see? Sometimes, things aren't what they seem to be...

837
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:58,121
and sometimes you think some things are really real,
and it's not, and sometimes...

838
01:14:58,122 --> 01:15:01,557
All of my training has prepared me for this moment.

Mittens, what are you doing here?

870
01:19:02,934 --> 01:19:07,024
Long story, short. I was tied to a delusional dog,
and dragged across the country.

871
01:19:07,871 --> 01:19:11,306
But that is not important now!
The real question is:

872
01:19:11,537 --> 01:19:15,154
What are you doing here, and why aren't you in there?

873
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:18,588
You were right about her, Mittens!

874
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:24,465
She a... well... it wasn't real.

875
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:28,529
No. Bolt, it is real!
I was in there just now...

876
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:32,185
I saw her face after you left.
She's broken-hearted.

877
01:19:33,533 --> 01:19:36,561
She doesn't want just any dog.
She loves you!

878
01:19:38,457 --> 01:19:43,290
She's your person, Bolt,
And you are her dog.

879
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:50,507
Bolt, you're just going to have to trust me on this
- Mittens, be quiet!

880
01:19:51,652 --> 01:19:54,652
No, you need to hear this!

01:20:38,454 --> 01:20:39,232
Bolt!

890
01:20:42,122 --> 01:20:44,435
Is anyone still in there?!
- I don't know.

891
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:49,294
Coming through!

892
01:20:53,203 --> 01:20:58,059
It's a good day to die!
- Not on my watch, rodent.

894
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:43,781
I knew you'd come back!

895
01:22:05,914 --> 01:22:08,035
Bolt, zoom zoom!

896
01:22:43,539 --> 01:22:50,196
Bolt, just go on out.

897
01:22:52,057 --> 01:22:52,666
Go!

898
01:22:55,178 --> 01:22:56,285
It'll be okay.

899
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:07,163
You're my good boy.

I love you!

901
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:24,108
Have you seen my daughter?
Has anyone seen my baby?!

902
01:23:53,647 --> 01:23:55,108
Did you hear that?!

903
01:23:56,704 --> 01:23:58,514
Quiet! Everyone be quiet!

904
01:24:05,837 --> 01:24:08,155
It's the super-bark.

905
01:24:09,357 --> 01:24:11,874
It's coming from over there!
- Come on, Go, go!

906
01:24:25,915 --> 01:24:29,734
Over here, we've found them!
They're here, we've found them!

907
01:24:33,585 --> 01:24:37,265
We need oxygen!
Coming through people, make a hole!

908
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:49,942
Bolt!
- Sweetie!

909
01:24:51,161 --> 01:24:55,184
You got to be okay!
You'll be just fine.

910
01:24:55,185 --> 01:24:58,252
She's stable, but we're going to take her to the hospital,
just to be safe!

911
01:25:07,097 --> 01:25:10,322
Oh, I'm just so sorry this happened!

912
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:12,898
I can't imagine what you must be feeling!

913
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:16,579
No mother should ever have to go through something like this...

914
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:22,183
but, I promise you,
we're going to make this work for us...

915
01:25:22,184 --> 01:25:26,590
I'm talking cover stories, production deals,
I'm talking executive producer credit.

916
01:25:26,595 --> 01:25:28,614
This is so great.

917
01:25:32,641 --> 01:25:33,891
We quit!

918
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:37,675
No, No.. let's not make any rash decisions!

919
01:25:39,337 --> 01:25:40,728
Lets, stick a pin in it!

920
01:25:52,233 --> 01:25:55,664
I'm afriad that your injuries where more severe

921
01:25:55,773 --> 01:25:57,870
then we previously though, my dear.

922
01:25:58,310 --> 01:26:02,523
We had to completely reconstruct your face!

923
01:26:04,152 --> 01:26:05,207
Have a look.

924
01:26:07,949 --> 01:26:13,308
Well, at least Calico won't be able to recognize me.

925
01:26:17,733 --> 01:26:18,936
Calico!

926

Bolt!

927
01:26:53,367 --> 01:26:54,743
Aliens!

928
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:01,674
That is totally unrealistic.

929
01:27:02,291 --> 01:27:06,207
Absolutely, redonkulous.

01:27:09,670 --> 01:27:12,381

Does that dog look familiar?
- Nope, I've never seen him before in my life.

937
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:10,521
<i>There is no home like the one you've got, </i>

938
01:28:10,522 --> 01:28:18,453
<i>cuz that home belongs to you.</i>
