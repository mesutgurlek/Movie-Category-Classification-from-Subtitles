1
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,282
Admiral Collingwood!

2
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,480
Well, Admiral?

3
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,819
Great news, Your Majesty!

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,992
The French are defeated at last.

5
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,723
Also the Russians, the Portuguese,

6
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:26,820
the Chinese

7
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,388
and the Welsh.

8
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:32,197
Then our navy rules the ocean.

9
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,333
Almost entirely, Your Majesty.

10
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,742
"Almost"?

11
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,143
Unfortunately, just here,

12
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,739
we're still having a little trouble with...

13
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,646
...pirates.

14
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,022
What does it say on my royal crest, Admiral?

15
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,318
"I hate pirates,"

16
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,022
ma'am.

17
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,790
Exactly.

18
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,058
Hate them.

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,159
With their idiotic shanties!

20
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,727
And their ridiculous hats!

21
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:11,333
And their endless, blasted roaring!

22
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:15,106
I want them sunk, Admiral!

23
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,843
Scuppered, smashed, fed to the sharks.
Do you hear me?

24
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,647
I hate pirates!

25
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,047
It's the looting.

26
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,749
It's the cutlasses.

27
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,292
It's the looting!

28
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,952
It's the cutlasses!

29
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,387
Looting!

30
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,691
Cutlasses!

31
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,958
Looting!

32
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,080
Sorry, Captain.

33
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,645
We were just discussing
what's the best bit about being a pirate.

34
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,885
You were, were you?

35
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,861
I suggested it might be the looting.

36
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,694
Whereas I contend it's the shiny cutlasses.

37
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,894
And I thought
it was the chance to catch exotic diseases.

38
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,303
Well, you're, all of you, wrong.

39
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,604
The best bit about being a pirate

40
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,744
isn't the looting or the cutlasses.

41
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,281
It's not the grog or the scurvy.

42
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,447
Or the scantily clad mermaids.

43
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:32,081
The best bit about being a pirate

44
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,682
is Ham Night!

45
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,520
Ham Night!

46
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,922
Ham Night!

47
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,165
Ham!

48
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,980
On your nose.

49
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,885
Go, Captain. Go, Captain.

50
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,852
Hey! Hey!

51
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,730
It's like a meat ballet.

52
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,199
- To Ham Night!
- Ham!

53
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,134
- And to the Pirate Captain!
- Pirate Captain!

54
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,526
Pirate Captain!

55
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:24,968
How was that, Number Two?

56
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,477
You've still got it, Captain.

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,774
I'd take a jellyfish in the face for that man.

58
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,872
Okay, now, shush, shush, shush.
Settle down, lads. Shush.

59
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,451
- Lads, lads.
- Pirates!

60
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,815
- It's not all about me.
- Don't be modest.

61
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,945
No, no, no.

62
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,047
Behind every captain with glittering eyes

63
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,887
-and a luxuriant beard...
- Luxuriant!

64
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,419
That's what it is.

65
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,956
...there's a crew of briny rogues.

66
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,361
Briny rogues!

67
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,956
Sure, some of you
are as ugly as a sea cucumber.

68
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,363
Will you get away with ya?

69
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,063
Some of you are closer
to being a chair or coat rack than a pirate.

70
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,772
And some of you
are just fish I've dressed up in a hat.

71
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,039
But you're still the best crew
a captain could wish for.

72
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,605
Don't forget Polly.

73
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,981
And not forgetting, never forgetting...

74
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,780
...Polly. The finest parrot
to sail the seven seas.

75
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,016
Come on, girl.

76
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,558
I love her beady eyes.

77
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,925
Who's the feathery
heart and soul of our boat?

78
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,892
Is it you? Is it you?

79
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,057
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

80
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,759
It's definitely you, isn't it?

81
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,633
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

82
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,476
Right. Where was I?

83
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,943
Ah, yes! Ah, yes.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,308
Important announcement.

85
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,076
By order of the Pirate King himself...

86
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,784
The Pirate of the Year Awards?

87
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,088
Are you going to...

88
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,457
Are you going to enter again?

89
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,628
That I am, Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate.

90
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,598
I know it hasn't
worked out perfectly for the last...

91
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,193
-20 year.
-20 years, yeah.

92
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,499
Exactly, Pirate with Gout. 20 years.

93
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,604
It might be a bit more. 21, 22...

94
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,904
Yes, yes. Thank you, thank you.

95
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,501
- You were very good, though.
- Shush!

96
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,639
The point is,
every time I've entered, I've failed to win.

97
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,047
So by the sheer law of maths...

98
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,074
Maths.

99
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,247
...I must have a really good chance this time.

100
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,517
Are you with me, lads?

101
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,350
Yes! This can only end brilliantly.

102
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,951
Then let's go plundering!

103
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,633
Land ho!

104
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,933
Blood Island.

105
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,499
So-called because
it's the exact shape of some blood.

106
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,668
Yeah!

107
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,681
Excuse me. Mind out.

108
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,059
Captain coming through.

109
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,289
Thank you very much.

110
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,456
Thank you.

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,091
One Pirate of the Year
entry form, if you please.

112
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,029
Thank you.

113
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,697
Now, let's see.

114
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,795
"Booty"?

115
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,101
Oh, yes.

116
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,108
"Roaring." Check.

117
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,302
Shanties.

118
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,936
I shall put "rousing."

119
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,236
"Beard"?

120
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,507
Luxuriant.

121
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,913
Obviously.

122
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,184
Do you think I should sign it in blood?

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,617
Make it more dramatic?

124
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,985
Might be a bit on the showy side.

125
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,990
Bit too much. You might be right.

126
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,255
Pirate Captain.

127
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,219
You can't lose, Captain.

128
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,355
I'd bet my face.

129
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,831
Well, thank you, Albino Pirate.

130
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,128
You're a shoo-in, sir.

131
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,726
Sure, there's not a pirate
on the seven seas can match you.

132
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,978
Lock up your daughters!

133
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,108
It's me, Peg-Leg Hastings!

134
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,618
Back from plunderin' the Spanish Main.

135
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,949
Good grief.

136
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:41,924
And I reckon this will make me
Pirate of the Year.

137
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,828
Don't worry, sir. He's all flash and no bang.

138
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,170
Cutlass Liz.

139
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,441
The Butcher of Barbados.

140
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,483
Hello, boys.

141
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:13,154
You're probably all wondering
if I'm still as deadly as I am beautiful.

142
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,223
Well, I am.

143
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,857
Hello, Cutlass, you trollop.

144
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,629
Peg-Leg, you pile of squid bait.

145
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,567
Check it out, lubbers.

146
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,435
The world's biggest diamond.

147
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,100
That baby's got my name on it.

148
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,946
She doesn't even have a beard.

149
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,653
Sweet Neptune's briny pants.

150
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,454
Black Bellamy.

151
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,198
Roar!

152
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,792
Read it and weep, ya coves!

153
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:38,464
That's right,
Black Bellamy is gonna be Pirate of the Year.

154
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,976
Again.

155
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,443
How are you? Good to see you.

156
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,945
Grog for everybody!

157
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,977
Grog for everybody!

158
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,677
Wow, we are rubbish
compared to them, aren't we?

159
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,938
Perhaps we should be off, sir.

160
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,034
Yes.

161
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,381
Yes, yes, good point.

162
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,475
I just remembered, actually,
I have some very important

163
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,714
bits of rope I need to untangle.

164
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:30,616
Thank you.

165
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:39,360
Well, if it isn't the Pirate Captain.

166
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,402
Hello, Bellamy. Cutlass. Peg-Leg.

167
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,669
Didn't notice you come in.

168
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,205
The beard's looking great, my man.

169
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,340
And I see that you're more wanted than ever.

170
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,950
Come on, everybody, be nice.
Give him a break.

171
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,285
Bring it down a little bit. All right.

172
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,346
Seriously, Captain,

173
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,455
how's the pirating business treating you?

174
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,257
Yeah, yeah, brilliantly, brilliantly.
Thanks for asking.

175
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,126
Treasure coming out of my eyeballs.

176
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,495
Taken to washing my hair in 50-pound notes.

177
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:10,959
Really?

178
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,162
If you've got so much booty,

179
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,365
then how come
you're still sailing that old wreck?

180
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,873
Anyway, look,
I'd love to stay and chat, but, you know,

181
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,745
places to pillage, people to...
People to skewer.

182
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,789
Come on!

183
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,257
That is disgusting.

184
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,056
Wait a minute.

185
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,557
Captain, what is this?

186
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,656
- What?
- Captain?

187
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,758
That's nothing.
Could I possibly have that back?

188
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,235
- Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.
- Thank you.

189
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,327
"Pirate of the Year"?

190
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,836
You're entering Pirate of the Year?

191
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,035
No, no, no, no, no.

192
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,646
- Yes.
- Again?

193
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,404
Yes!

194
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,709
Come on. Listen, did they change the rules?

195
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,621
I mean, I always thought they gave it
to the pirate with the most booty.

196
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,421
Do they now just give it to the guy
with the fattest parrot?

197
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,961
She is not fat. She's just big-boned.

198
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,227
She's fat, dude.

199
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,731
Yeah, go on. Go on, then, laugh.

200
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,199
Everyone laugh.

201
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,010
Ignore them, Captain. It's not worth it.

202
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,637
The trophy would just clash
with your wallpaper, anyway.

203
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,912
You'll see, you'll see.

204
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,619
I will be Pirate of the Year.

205
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,092
Yes.

206
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:49,129
And then you'll be laughing on
the other side of your faces.

207
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,593
Yes.

208
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:56,504
And believe me, that is
a very painful thing to do.

209
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,870
Come on, lads.

210
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,615
Well...

211
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:11,743
All right, now listen up, you coves.

212
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,553
All right, now listen up, you coves.

213
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,422
'We'll show those swabs
a thing or two about pirating.

214
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:21,861
There's still time
to fill these chests with sparkling booty.

215
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,861
I can practically taste that trophy!

216
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,628
Trophy! Trophy! Trophy!

217
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,809
Captain! Sail off the port bow!

218
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,208
Let's get after her, Number Two.

219
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,714
Aye, aye, sir.

220
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,180
Clap on all sail!

221
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,549
Royals and topgallants!

222
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,609
Release those gallants!

223
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,739
Fire those long things that go bang.

224
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,907
Fire cannons four and six!

225
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,718
Eat cannonball, lubbers.

226
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,060
Here we go, lads! Look and learn.

227
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,830
Go get 'em, Pirate Captain!

228
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,506
Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain.

229
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,139
And I'm here for your gold.

230
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:43,873
Gold? This is a plague boat, old man.
I'd give my right arm for some gold.

231
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,506
Or my left.

232
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,073
Right, lads.

233
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,778
Minor hiccup, that last one.

234
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,843
This time,

235
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,387
it's payday!

236
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm the Pirate Captain,
and I'm here for your gold.

237
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,656
Geography field trip.

238
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,367
I'm the Pirate Captain, and...

239
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,968
Naturists.

240
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,598
Pirate Captain. Blah, blah, blah, blah, gold.

241
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,041
Ghost ship.

242
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,917
Sorry.

243
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,721
Captain, we've sighted another ship, sir.

244
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,392
That's nice.

245
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:16,996
Do you want to give the order to attack?

246
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,941
No, not really, Number Two. No, I think I've...

247
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,604
Think I had enough of piracy.

248
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,011
I'm hanging up my cutlass.

249
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,311
Captain, no!

250
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,045
Yeah, I was thinking
I might go into baby clothes, actually.

251
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,311
What?

252
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,379
I hear there's a fortune to be made
in baby clothes because

253
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,049
babies grow so fast.

254
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,685
No, but you can't. I mean, the crew...

255
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,456
They'd... They'd be lost without you.

256
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,520
What was I thinking, Number Two?

257
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,260
Pirate of the Year?

258
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,460
Me?

259
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,934
Look at the trophy cabinet.

260
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,506
Best Anecdote About a Squid.

261
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,845
I mean, that is all I've got to show
for my entire career.

262
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,676
Pirate of the Year?

263
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,239
It's just commercialized nonsense.

264
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,919
Real piracy isn't about trophies.

265
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,748
It's about fighting up staircases backwards.

266
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,025
It's about sliding down sails
with a knife in your teeth.

267
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,288
Beard glossiness!

268
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,825
And think about
all the adventures we've had.

269
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,197
Our adventure with Aztecs.

270
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,333
Our adventure with that pig.

271
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,426
Our adventure with...

272
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,142
Okay, maybe not the librarians.
But the fun we've had.

273
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,010
And what about the shanties?

274
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,176
Well, I mean...
People would miss my shanties.

275
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,946
And the running people through.

276
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,354
Well, I... I do enjoy running people through.

277
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,084
Enjoy it? You're brilliant at it!

278
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,423
You're a brine-soaked terror of the high seas!

279
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,789
Do you think so, Number Two?

280
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,661
Everyone does!

281
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,997
You're more of a pirate
than Black Bellamy or any of them.

282
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,866
You're a real pirate.

283
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,530
That's why the crew,

284
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,041
they think you're the best thing
since boil-in-the-bag ham.

285
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,039
Why do you think they all

286
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,712
got that tattoo? Come on.

287
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,206
What do you say?

288
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,746
Arrr!

289
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,342
By Neptune, where's that ship?

290
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,682
This is the one, lads!

291
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,125
Ninth time lucky! I can feel it in my beard!

292
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,258
Well, don't just sit there like lemons!

293
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,126
Hoist the flag!

294
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,494
Standard, sir?

295
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,761
Or extra gruesome?

296
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,166
Extra gruesome!

297
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,463
Let's make their gizzards shake.

298
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,441
Journal of Charles Darwin.

299
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:46,819
Day 93 aboard the Beagle.

300
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:51,657
I have, today,
discovered a new kind of barnacle,

301
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:57,599
which I have categorized
in the order of Pygophora.

302
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,797
I'll never get a girlfriend. lam so unhappy.

303
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:23,186
And now I'm being attacked by pirates.

304
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,972
Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain,
and I'm here for your gold.

305
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,872
I haven't got any gold.

306
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,872
No gold, eh?

307
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,383
Then what, might I ask, is this?

308
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,443
It's a baboon's kidney.

309
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,181
Is it?

310
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,355
And what about this?

311
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,485
It's another baboon's kidney.

312
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,356
We searched the hold, Captain.

313
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,760
And?

314
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,634
Just creatures.

315
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,637
Bits of creatures in jars.

316
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,230
And an unhappy-looking baboon.

317
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,934
What kind of ship is this?

318
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,579
We're a...

319
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,413
Well, we were a scientific expedition.

320
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,612
Charles Darwin, at your service, sir.

321
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,747
For pity's sake!

322
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,554
Is it so much to ask? Is it?

323
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,223
I just want one tiny bit of success!

324
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:37,028
One teensy weensy bit
of respect from my peers

325
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,625
just once in my life!

326
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,236
Is that such a crime?

327
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,738
Is it?

328
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,905
- No?
- No!

329
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,501
No.

330
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,604
But you try telling that to the universe.

331
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,673
Just once, just once for things to go right.

332
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,979
Just... Just once.

333
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,119
So, are we done here?

334
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,629
Dear Diary,

335
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,826
about to meet a watery grave.

336
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,596
It's nothing personal, you understand.

337
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,131
It's just... It's been a tough week,

338
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,969
and a good plank walk
usually cheers him up.

339
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,073
Will die without reaching second base
with a lady.

340
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,645
Get on with it!

341
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,076
Today's weather:

342
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,844
inclement.

343
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,992
- Stop!
- Now what?

344
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,394
Last request, is it?
Do we have to grant those?

345
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,400
Is there some sort of
human rights convention we're signed up to?

346
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,332
- But that bird!
- My parrot?

347
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,868
She's just big-boned!

348
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,873
No, she's not.
I mean... I mean, she's not a parrot.

349
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,306
Not a parrot?

350
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,775
What's he on about, old girl?

351
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:54,970
She's... She's...

352
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,842
She's the scientific discovery of our age!

353
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,880
She's a...

354
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,547
Sorry. It's just,

355
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,646
that's my favorite bit.

356
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,822
A dodo, you say?

357
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,661
They've been extinct for 150 years.

358
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,964
To find one alive today, it's quite incredible.

359
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,062
Well, clever old girl. Not going extinct.

360
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,732
If I might be so bold, I would be prepared

361
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,610
to pay you 10 pounds for your Polly.

362
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:31,972
Polly's not for sale.

363
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,516
Ten pound.

364
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,744
She's one of the family.

365
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,513
She's like an auntie.

366
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,815
With a beak.

367
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,116
Yeah, I'm afraid they're right, Charles.

368
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,021
Polly here is the feathery
heart and soul of the boat.

369
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,320
Come on, little dodo.

370
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,359
It's such a missed opportunity.

371
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,226
If I could've presented her

372
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,896
in London to the Royal Society
at their annual science show...

373
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,837
No question of that, I'm afraid.

374
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,341
- She'd have been an absolute sensation.
- Yeah, well, can't be helped.

375
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,968
And of course a shoo-in for the top prize.

376
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,478
Prize?

377
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,541
For best scientific discovery. Yes.

378
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,581
This prize,

379
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,487
-valuable, is it?
- Valuable?

380
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,494
It's priceless.

381
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,757
Untold riches.

382
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,864
- Captain...
- No, no, no, no.

383
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,666
I was thinking, perhaps,
perhaps I was being a touch hasty.

384
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,831
But, Captain, London?

385
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,374
The home of Queen Victoria,

386
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,542
mortal enemy of pirates everywhere?

387
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,873
We'll end up hanged at Execution Dock.

388
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,744
We laugh in the face of danger, remember?

389
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,409
- I don't.
- I don't really like danger at all.

390
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:48,220
Captain, do you remember
the little talk we had?

391
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,460
The one about whether pigs
are actually a type of fruit?

392
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:53,852
No.

393
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:58,857
No.

394
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,336
The one about us trying
to avoid harebrained schemes

395
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,929
that end in us facing certain death.

396
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,837
You heard the man, Number Two.

397
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,773
"Untold riches."

398
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:07,866
Here's the plan.

399
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,570
We go to London,
Polly wins this science show thingy,

400
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:15,641
we take the prize money,
I enter Pirate of the Year, I win!

401
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,118
Bingo!

402
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,177
- But, Captain, I'm not sure...
- It can't fail.

403
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,817
And besides, look at her little face.

404
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,760
I sure want to win that science prize.

405
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:26,955
Squawk!

406
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,691
Bravo, Captain!

407
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,200
I see you're a man of vision!

408
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,565
Right, then, Charles.
When is this science show of yours?

409
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,335
A week tomorrow.

410
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,841
Confound it!

411
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,808
You see, we could've
made that with a good wind behind us,

412
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,642
but unfortunately there's this dirty
great sea monster in the way.

413
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,453
I think they just add those onto maps
for decoration, Captain.

414
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,087
Is that a fact?

415
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,990
Well, blow me down.

416
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,193
I dare, you could learn something
from this fine fellow, Number Two.

417
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,636
London Town.

418
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,540
The most romantic city in the world.

419
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,924
"Queen Victoria

420
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:12,328
"welcomes you to London."

421
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,801
That's nice.

422
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,701
Perhaps she's not so bad after all.

423
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,936
Well, don't look so worried, Number Two.

424
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,777
Pirates are always visiting London.

425
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,850
Turn back!

426
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,888
This is the fate of pirates here!

427
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,419
Is that Scarlett Morgan?

428
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,088
Pirate Captain.

429
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,526
Goodness me!

430
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,120
I haven't seen you
since that business in Madagascar.

431
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,400
Yes. I could've sworn they were girls.

432
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,665
You're looking well, Morgan.

433
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,471
Yeah, lost a bit of weight.

434
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,064
What are you up to these days?

435
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,200
You know, this and that.

436
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,767
Yeah, just gonna enter
a science competition, actually.

437
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,111
- Good luck with that.
- Yeah, thanks, thanks.

438
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,814
No, no, wait, wait!

439
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,080
Turn back!

440
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,748
Turn back.

441
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,016
- Sorry.
- No!

442
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,256
Look what you've done to me boat.
Look at the state of it.

443
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,695
I hope you've got some insurance, 'cause I...

444
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,867
Right, then. We'll be off.

445
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,630
I'll bring her back tomorrow
straight after the show.

446
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,104
Well, don't be daft, Charles.
I'll be presenting Polly.

447
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,634
- You?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

448
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,835
I always fancied
trying my hand at a spot of science.

449
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,739
But you can't. I mean,

450
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,406
the streets of London
are no place for pirates.

451
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,608
Pirates? What pirates?

452
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:35,510
Nobody here but us Girl Guides.

453
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:36,677
Yes!

454
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,749
I've got a badge for looting.

455
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,883
We're not really Girl Guides.
It's us, the pirates.

456
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,654
We're masters of disguise.

457
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,922
How ingenious.

458
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,262
But all the same, Captain,
best we lie low for the night.

459
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,732
Perhaps at my house.

460
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,895
- Captain, I really think...
- Good plan, Chuck.

461
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,837
Be fun to see how you boffin types live.

462
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,504
Well, come on. Taxi!

463
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:05,139
Evening, Officer.

464
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,240
Hidey-ho, ladies.

465
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,917
London smells like Grandma.

466
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,821
Whoa.

467
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,059
Here we are.

468
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,070
Home, sweet home.

469
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,571
You don't get many women back here,
do you, Charles?

470
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,381
People who live alone
are always serial killers.

471
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,182
Sweet Neptune on a bike!

472
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,859
Don't mind Mr. Bobo.

473
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,088
- Just an old project of mine.
- Project?

474
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,894
Yeah, I had this theory.

475
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,763
I thought that if you took a monkey,
gave him a monocle

476
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,733
and covered up his gigantic, unsightly ass,

477
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,393
then he would cease
to be a monkey and become more of a...

478
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,604
A man-panzee, if you will.

479
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,698
Bold theory.

480
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,766
I don't like the monkey.

481
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,641
But to be honest, monkeys are 10 a penny.

482
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,842
He's not a patch on Polly here.

483
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,876
Anyhow, big day tomorrow.

484
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,146
We all need our rest.

485
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,190
Let me show you to your room, Captain.

486
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,517
Right behind you, Chuck.

487
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,561
Now, here's the plan.

488
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,371
You know what to do.
Wait until the bearded idiot is asleep,

489
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,671
then sneak into his room and...

490
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,716
Captain.

491
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,786
It's... It's Mr. Darwin, sir.
I'm sure he's up to no good.

492
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,832
Honestly, Number Two, what's got into you?

493
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:06,096
Thanks to Charles,
we're about to win lavish untold riches,

494
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,467
and here you are
trying to find fault with the poor fellow.

495
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,603
- Yes, but...
- No, no, no. Not another word.

496
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,269
A future Pirate of the Year
needs his beauty sleep.

497
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,142
Do you think you could
make nautical noises until we drop off?

498
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,147
That's lovely. Now, that is lovely.
Can you do the shiver a timber?

499
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,331
And just chuck in a few gulls, would you?

500
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,297
Ladies and gentlemen, our winner.

501
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,103
Give it up for the Pirate Captain!

502
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,455
Congratulations, Pirate Captain.

503
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,622
Nobody deserves this more than you.

504
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,361
Thanks, Cutlass.

505
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:43,331
And that beard of yours,

506
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,157
it drives me

507
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,204
crazy.

508
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,199
Give it here.

509
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,474
Give it back, Bellamy, it's mine!

510
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,407
No, give it back.

511
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,576
Neptune's navel!

512
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,046
Come back here, you lubber.

513
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,282
Stop, thief!

514
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,971
I'll take that.

515
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,033
Not so fast, my friend.

516
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,439
Number Two!

517
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,507
Number Two, are you all right?

518
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,784
Unhand that dodo!

519
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,490
Evening, Captain.

520
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,347
Number Two!

521
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,084
We're under attack!

522
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,787
Abandon ship!

523
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,936
Hello, Pirate Captain, Pirate with a Scarf!

524
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,915
Come back here,
Mysterious Shadowy Figure!

525
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,223
Faster! Faster!

526
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,519
Got you! Are you all right, girl?

527
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,420
Captain! I mean, what's going on?

528
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,391
Don't play the innocent.

529
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,986
You and your hench-monkey
tried to steal Polly.

530
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:31,090
Steal Polly? Dear me, no, you're mistaken.

531
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,829
Then how do you explain this?

532
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,145
Well, I think it's obvious
what's happened, isn't it?

533
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,273
Is it?

534
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,544
Some jealous rival scientist

535
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,450
must have tried to make off with the dodo.

536
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,019
Well, that explains everything.

537
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,984
Captain, please, let's go.

538
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,425
Polly's not safe in London.

539
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,689
I couldn't bear it
if something happened to Polly.

540
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,231
Nothing is going to happen to Polly.

541
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,291
She'll be perfectly safe.
Leave everything to me.

542
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,394
Now, come on,
we can't keep that prize waiting.

543
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,607
Anyone got a towel?

544
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:23,949


545
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,654
Nice going, banana butt.

546
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,495
Now this briny buffoon
is gonna grab all the glory.

547
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,968
It's a disaster.

548
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,470
It's...

549
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,306
Bad news, I'm afraid, Captain.

550
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,468
You can't go in.

551
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,144
It's strictly scientists only, you see.

552
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:55,082
I'll just have to present Polly

553
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,409
myself.

554
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,182
We're not really scientists.
It's us, the pirates.

555
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,349
See? Masters of disguise.

556
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,686
But where's Polly?

557
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,285
That is on a need-to-know basis
from here on in, Charles.

558
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,358
- Pardon?
- I am keeping her hidden.

559
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,457
That shadowy figure could be anywhere.

560
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,000
Luckily, I am not only a master of disguises,

561
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:17,005
I am also a master of hiding things.

562
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,200
Right, lads,
let's show these boffins what's what.

563
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,901
But, Captain.

564
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,036
- Really, I...
- Hello!

565
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,814
We're here for the science show.

566
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,577
We're scientists.

567
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,117
That's a pipette, this is Charles Darwin,

568
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,881
and I am the Scientist Captain.

569
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,883
If you're a scientist, name three elements.

570
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,151
Well, let's see now.

571
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,922
There's... There's gold, ham...

572
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,956
...and

573
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,398
the tears of a mermaid.

574
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,596
Yeah, two out of three. Close enough
First on your left.

575
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,470
The balloon of my airship contains

576
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,567
-20,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas.
- Excuse me.

577
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,872
Sorry.

578
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,876
Just here, you will notice the open log fire

579
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:02,247
to ensure a comfortable
temperature at higher altitudes.

580
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,084
Captain?

581
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,313
Captain, Captain, please.

582
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,254
You can't possibly
appear on stage without Polly.

583
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,383
Patience, Charles. All in good time.

584
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,486
Excuse me. Sorry.

585
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,191
- Sorry.
- Idiot!

586
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,166
- Just a tick.
- But, Captain...

587
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,039
How on earth did...

588
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:33,481
My airship will revolutionize
the fields of meteorology and cartography.

589
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,572
But mostly,

590
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,076
it's for looking down ladies' tops.

591
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,149
Ingenious.

592
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,729
Captain, I really, really think

593
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,992
it would be best if I take over from here.

594
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,029
There's a certain manner
in which these things are conduc...

595
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,190
Nonsense, Chuck.

596
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:56,636
What this science stuff needs
is a bit of showmanship!

597
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,154
Look, it's the captain.

598
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,483
Captain! Captain!

599
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,429
Fellow scientists, poindexters, geeks,

600
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,855
prepare to be confounded.

601
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,591
Prepare to be amazed.

602
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:28,898
Prepare to...

603
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,501
Wait a second. What's this?

604
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,704
What's this?

605
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,880
Stop!

606
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,781
I am the world's leading doctor,

607
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:51,415
and I declare the science you are doing
is too shocking by half.

608
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,483
Dr. Albino,

609
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,190
are you saying that those of a nervous
disposition should leave immediately,

610
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,256
in case the sheer unexpected
remarkableness of my discovery

611
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,165
should cause their hearts to explode?

612
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,331
I am.

613
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,639
Well, science lovers, you have been warned.

614
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,406
This is our most educational adventure ever.

615
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,286
Back from the dead.

616
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,415
Back from beyond the grave.

617
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,327
Back to astound you all.

618
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,293
The ninth wonder of the world.

619
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:32,061
She's traveled halfway
across the globe to be here tonight.

620
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:35,934
Here's Polly!

621
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,565
It's a dodo.

622
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,201
By Jove.

623
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,476
That is astounding!

624
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,515
An actual dodo!

625
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,925
Makes electricity look like a pile of crap.

626
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,403
The Royal Society's prize

627
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,703
for best scientific discovery...

628
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,169
I hope it's not a check.

629
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,268
...Is awarded to...

630
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,778
Have you any idea
what the sterling-doubloon

631
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:18,973
exchange rate is these days?

632
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,312
...the Scientist Captain.

633
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,176
Thank you, thank you.

634
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,412
You're too kind.

635
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,079
Please stop. Enough. Thank you.

636
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,382
Thank you.

637
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,085
Is that it?

638
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,186
Oh, no.

639
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,424
- Good.
- You also get

640
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:41,435
this leather-bound set of encyclopedias.

641
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,607
Excuse me just one moment. Thank you.

642
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,898
Okay, Chuck.

643
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,241
Now, I like encyclopedias
as much as the next man,

644
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,811
but they're not exactly gonna help me win
Pirate of the Year, are they?

645
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:56,373
Where's the booty?

646
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,249
Booty? What booty?

647
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,916
The prize! The "untold riches," remember?

648
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,460
Perhaps I didn't explain.

649
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,291
It's not all about money.

650
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,758
No, the real prize is...

651
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,130
Her Royal Majesty, the Empress of India,

652
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,530
Ruler of the Kingdom of Java...

653
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,833
-...a personal audience with...
-...Defender of the Faith,

654
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,804
- Queen Victoria!
- Queen Victoria

655
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:20,334
herself.

656
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,033
Scientist Captain,

657
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,968
congratulations.

658
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,302
What a tremendous discovery.

659
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,604
Your... Your Majesty.

660
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,838
And who are these charming fellows?

661
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:01,405
- Well, this is my crew.
- By which he means lab assistant crew.

662
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,180
Yes, yes.
I'm using "crew" in the street sense.

663
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,515
Yo.

664
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,055
And I'm Charles Darwin, Your Majesty.

665
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,956
I helped find the dodo.

666
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,551
Yes, whatever.

667
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:15,597
But where has your
delightful creature disappeared to?

668
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,690
Resting, ma'am. Hidden away.

669
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:20,201
I only let her out
for the big performance, I'm afraid.

670
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:23,397
In case sinister forces
should try to make off with her, you see.

671
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,939
Sinister forces?

672
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,372
Dear.

673
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,344
Well, we have a wonderful
petting zoo at the palace

674
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,745
where Polly would be quite safe.

675
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,616
Perhaps we could

676
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,408
take her off your hands.

677
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:40,988
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but that's out of the question.

678
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,456
But she'd have a lovely time.

679
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:46,188
There are guinea pigs and a donkey.

680
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,524
No, no, I couldn't, ma'am.

681
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:51,724
Not even for little old me?

682
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,530
No, no, no, I'm afraid not, ma'am.

683
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,934
No, you see,
there is nothing more important to a pirate

684
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,563
than his trusted dodo.

685
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,575
She is the feathery
heart and soul of the boat.

686
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,310
Did you say...

687
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,306
..."pirate"?

688
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,818
Pirate? No, no, no, no, no.

689
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,251
Scientist.

690
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,983
Yes, good old, good old science.
Can't get enough of it.

691
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,319
Mixing stuff together.

692
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,382
You know, test tube tubing
and Bunsen burning.

693
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,951
See?

694
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,330
He's no scientist!

695
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,368
He's a Girl Guide!

696
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,070
He's no Girl Guide!

697
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,073
- He's a pirate!
- Pirate!

698
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,339
Hang on, hang on.

699
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,743
There's been some kind of mistake. Some...

700
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,438
Some silly mistake. 'Whoa, laddies!

701
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,450
Stop, stop. I can explain.

702
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,268
Your Majesty.

703
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,126
He's hidden the dodo.

704
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,330
If you chop his head off now,

705
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:05,269
we might never find out where.

706
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,764
Wait a mo.

707
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,513
One doesn't know why.

708
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:24,753
Perhaps it's his luxuriant beard
or his gleaming teeth

709
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,896
or the way he smells faintly of coconuts.

710
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,023
But we have taken a shine to this pirate.

711
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,564
Do you have a name, pirate captain?

712
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,905
They call me the Pirate Captain.

713
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,275
Well, Pirate Captain,

714
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,073
we hereby pardon you
of your piratical crimes.

715
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,949
You will stay in London, Pirate Captain,

716
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,818
and entertain us
with your stories and your wit.

717
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,480
And especially

718
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,356
your dear little dodo.

719
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,559
Hell's barnacles.

720
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,330
Can we please get out of here now?

721
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,996
That was a bit close for comfort,
Number Two.

722
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,198
I will get you the dodo, Your Majesty.

723
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,641
See that you do, Mr. Darwin.

724
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,410
Captain?

725
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,875
Captain! Captain!

726
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:26,008


727
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,750
Hurry up, lads, chop-chop.

728
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,222
Let's get back to sea where we belong.

729
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,020
Ave, aye, Captain!

730
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,626
I told you coming to London was a bad idea.

731
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,060
The sooner I get the smell of brine in my...

732
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,528
Captain!

733
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,264
Captain!

734
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,698
Whoa!

735
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,232
You're not leaving, surely?

736
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,337
I most certainly am.

737
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,839
You've let me down badly, Charles.

738
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,665
Look! Look!

739
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:48,835
- Also, to be frank...
- Captain...

740
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,674
...your nose is too small for your face.

741
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:52,776
But you're the toast of London Town.

742
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,715
I say, look at that.

743
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,212
They've really captured my eyes.

744
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:04,383
We were hoping
you might come out for a little

745
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,826
celebration before you go.

746
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,899
We don't want to miss the tide, Captain.

747
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:13,992
- No, no, no. Quite right, quite right.
- Captain,

748
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,904
do join us, please?

749
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,904
I'll just stop for a quick one. Rude to refuse.

750
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,466
- But it's Ham Night.
- I'll be 20 minutes.

751
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:23,636
Half an hour tops.

752
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,611
Just get her...
Get her warmed up without me.

753
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:26,739
Aren't we going yet?

754
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,915
But what about winning the Pirate of the Year

755
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,476
and showing all those other captains
that he's not a loser?

756
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,220
You-hoo! Come along, Captain.

757
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,595
Captain...

758
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,533
- Cheers!
- Good evening.

759
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,263
Thank you. Thank you so very much.

760
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,702
- Captain...
- And your name is?

761
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,761
Miss Jane Austen.

762
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,471
And that, and that is why, in a straight fight,

763
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,416
a shark would probably beat a Dracula.

764
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,845
Jane Austen,
feel free to use it in one of your books.

765
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,255
Pirate Captain, you are a born raconteur.

766
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,994
So much better
than the last chap we all went doolally over.

767
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,758
You've all been terribly kind.

768
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,060
Do run along.

769
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,761
Another drink, Captain?

770
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,631
Cheers, Chuck.

771
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,831
I say, you're not

772
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,575
-related in some way, are you?
- Pardon?

773
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,471
It's just you, sort of...

774
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,377
Well, no, no, nothing, nothing, nothing.

775
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,146
Cheers.

776
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,921
Do you know what I've discovered, Charles?

777
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,692
The friends you make
after you've become famous

778
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,734
are better, truer friends

779
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,860
than the ones you've had
for years beforehand.

780
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,927
So very wise.

781
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,669
But the lads will think I'm a fool.

782
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,507
No. A fool, you?

783
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,672
You're an intellectual giant.

784
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,376
Just look at how
you managed to keep Polly safe

785
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,145
from those sinister forces.

786
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,776
Yes, I did do that, didn't I?

787
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,446
You did.

788
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,784
And wherever she's hidden,

789
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,292
I bet it's somewhere really ingenious.

790
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,349
It is rather.

791
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,696
You'll never guess where.

792
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,791
Well, no, why,
you're too smart for me, Captain.

793
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,961
Right under everyone's noses.

794
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,505
Or right under my noses, anyhow.

795
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,698
Ta-d a!

796
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,846
You've been keeping Polly in your beard?

797
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,143
Actually, I keep all sorts in here.

798
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,881
I'm sorry about this, Captain.

799
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,354
About what?

800
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,191
What the...
What's the monkey-man playing at?

801
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,053
This patently isn't even a real...

802
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,768
Come back here, you lubbers!

803
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,210
Sorry, Your Reverence.

804
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,897
Got you, you rogue!

805
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,469
Yeah, that's rather nice.

806
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,538
Neptune's lips, what are you up to?

807
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,079
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's not my fault.

808
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,741
What do you mean "not your fault"?

809
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,376
You steal Polly,
you shoot my best hat full of holes.

810
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:11,097
Well, go on, then.

811
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:12,871
Explain yourself.

812
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,934
There's this girl.

813
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,309
I'm hopelessly smitten with her.

814
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,041
I'm listening.

815
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:23,983
I know how partial she is to exotic animals,

816
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,816
and I thought if I could get her the do-do,

817
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:30,347
then she might like me.

818
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,317
I'm so ashamed.

819
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,461
Why didn't you say so?

820
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,593
We've all done stupid things to impress girls.

821
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,192
Yeah, you should act aloof.

822
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,670
They love it when you act aloof.

823
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,900
Still, must be quite a girl
for you to go to all that trouble.

824
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:48,636
She is quite a girl.

825
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,707
Kraken's biscuits!

826
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,342
Mr. Darwin.

827
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,210
Honestly, Charles.

828
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:01,945
It's the bun. The bun really does it for me.

829
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,582
And I see you've brought a friend.

830
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:04,984
How delightful.

831
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:07,187
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

832
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,424
Oh, get a grip, man. You couldn't
manage one tiny task, could you?

833
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,489
It's pathetic.

834
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:44,661
Listen, Captain, I can see
I've gone about this all wrong.

835
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:50,798
You see, I might have the body
of a weak and feeble woman,

836
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:57,742
but I have the heart and soul of a person
who really, really wants that dodo.

837
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:24,437
I seem to recall that you piratical types
have a bit of a soft spot for shiny things.

838
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,541
Or am I getting you
muddled up with magpies?

839
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,736
I couldn't.

840
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:32,575
I mean, Polly, she's a family...

841
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,307
Come now, Captain, it's so simple.

842
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,183
Polly here could live like
a queen at my petting zoo,

843
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:41,882
and you...Well...

844
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:45,215
With treasure like this,

845
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:49,995
you could be famed across the seven seas.

846
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,595
Captain.

847
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,003
Polly's not for sale.

848
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,135
You? Win Pirate of the Year?

849
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,677
You're a shoo-in, sir.

850
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,771
There's not a pirate
on the seven seas can match you.

851
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,838
But what about winning Pirate of the Year

852
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:11,886
and showing all those other captains
that you're not a loser?

853
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:14,512
Loser... Loser...

854
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:19,489
I'm a floating head.

855
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:21,919
So, Captain.

856
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:25,829
Are you going to do the right thing?

857
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:34,368
I'm sailing out on the ocean

858
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:37,503
Out on the deep blue sea

859
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,207
20 minutes, he said.

860
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,874
Didn't he say 20 minutes?

861
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,279
Don't worry, lads.

862
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,842
He probably just got caught up,

863
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:46,944
you know,

864
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,647
battling a giant squid or something.

865
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:00,267
'Well, come on, you lubbers!

866
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:01,495
It's him!

867
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,730
I told you!

868
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,102
I... I told you he wouldn't let us down.

869
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,435
Hello, boys.

870
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,932
Miss me?

871
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:11,136
I'm having a mirage.

872
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,738
But... How?

873
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:14,941
Good question, Number Two.

874
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:18,417
I stole it all in a daring raid
on the Tower of London.

875
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:23,523
You stole all this from the Tower of London?

876
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,615
That's right.

877
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,820
Then I burnt it to the ground,
wrestled a bear,

878
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,053
and I kissed a princess for good measure.

879
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,866
Well, what are you waiting for?
Don't just stand there like porpoises.

880
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,230
There's a trophy with our names on it!

881
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,561
Set a course for Blood Island!

882
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:39,903


883
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,380
Avast, me hearties!

884
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:51,815
And welcome to the
59th Annual Pirate of the Year Awards!

885
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,034
This is the ticket, eh, Number Two?

886
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,132
Please, please, please,
can't Polly come out now?

887
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,940
Best not.

888
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:18,908
She's still very tired.

889
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:20,606
- And here is your host for the evening...
- Shush.

890
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,374
The Pirate King!

891
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:32,353
Hello, Pirates!

892
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,088
Hello, Pirate King!

893
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,888
Any lubbers in tonight?

894
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,363
No!

895
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,298
Behind you!

896
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:45,895
I'm Queen Victoria!

897
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,737
And I hate pirates!

898
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:52,444
Come on, cheer up.

899
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,379
And now, you swabs,

900
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:57,680
this is the big one.

901
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:02,415
The nominees for Pirate
of the Year are as follows:

902
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,187
Black Bellamy.

903
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:07,328
Cutlass Liz.

904
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,691
Peg-Leg Hastings.

905
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:13,266
And a surprise late entry,

906
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:15,528
the Pirate Captain!

907
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:20,835
The panel of independent judges

908
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:24,036
have counted each
pirate's booty and declared

909
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,781
that this year's winner is

910
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:32,176
the Pirate Captain!

911
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:21,759
Excuse me!

912
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,570
Excuse me.

913
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,833
Listen, this is all very moving.

914
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,934
I'm welling up here, but...

915
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,705
Bellamy, this is most irregular!

916
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,714
So is this!

917
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:48,721
It seems Queen Victoria has
pardoned the Pirate Captain.

918
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,693
No!

919
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:53,423
So what if she did?

920
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,127
If you've been pardoned

921
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,999
then, technically, you're no longer a pirate.

922
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,565
And if you're no longer a pirate,

923
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,002
you really can't be Pirate of the Year,

924
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:05,969
now, can you?

925
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,606
- No, you can't!
- That's right!

926
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,216
Is this true?

927
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,087
Well, that's one, frankly,
rather negative way of looking at it.

928
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:18,191
Villainous treachery!

929
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:21,126
Treacherous villainy!

930
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:24,165
You have betrayed the pirating fraternity.

931
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,891
But, Pirate King...

932
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:28,501
Your pirate hat and coat!

933
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:46,483
Your pirate badge with googly eyes.

934
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,786
And your World of Hooks discount card.

935
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,550
Confiscate his treasure!

936
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:55,286
Every last bit of it.

937
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:59,126
Begone!
May your lubber shame bear down upon you.

938
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:02,701
You are hereby banished from Blood Island!

939
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:08,196
You are a pirate no more!

940
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:08,538


941
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,817
And stay out!

942
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,086
Yes, well, not a... Not a total success.

943
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,824
We don't need them and their stupid awards.

944
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,958
The best thing about being
a pirate isn't the treasure.

945
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,933
- It's the cutlasses.
- It's Ham Night.

946
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,698
It's Polly.

947
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:39,467
Where is Polly, Captain?

948
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,509
What do you mean? You know where she is.

949
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,908
She's been upset enough.

950
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,036
Captain...

951
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,342
Okay, Okay.

952
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,453
I sold her to Queen Victoria
for a boatload of treasure.

953
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:04,088
There, I've said it.

954
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:14,531
Well, come on. She was just a parrot.

955
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,338
I mean, she wasn't even a parrot.

956
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,709
Always weeing on the boat's carpets,
biting everyone.

957
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,476
She gave half of us tetanus,
for goodness sake.

958
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,216
But she was our Polly.

959
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,549
Well, you know, you should be happy for her.

960
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,987
She'll be, she'll be living the high life.

961
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:33,953
Eating gold bricks wrapped up in,
you know, swans.

962
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,030
Well, where are you swabs going? Come on.

963
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:44,201
Well, we'll have an adventure
somewhere tropical with those native ladies

964
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,298
whose outfits
don't leave much to the imagination.

965
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:53,044
Looks like it's
just you and me now, eh, Number Two?

966
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,516
Good old inseparable you and me.

967
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,141
Us two against the world, eh?

968
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,207
Yeah?

969
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,845
Like serrano ham and,

970
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,550
you know, that other kind of ham.

971
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,057
Arrr.

972
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:11,729
You can't always
just say "arrr" at the end of a sentence

973
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,894
and think that makes everything all right.

974
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,412
Fine. Fine, go on, then. Go.

975
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,282
Go!

976
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,087
It's not like I need any of you, anyway.

977
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:37,051
See if I care.

978
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:43,688
See if I care.

979
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:29,963
You're too late.

980
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:33,000
She's gone.

981
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:34,200
Charles?

982
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,535
Is that you?

983
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,043
What are you doing here?

984
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,706
We're tramps now.
It's not unlike being a scientist, but...

985
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,180
...with less experiments
and more drinking your own sweat.

986
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:47,411
But where's Polly?
Why isn't she in her cage?

987
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,318
It's too horrible.

988
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,889
"Banquet for world leaders"?

989
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,460
I've been a fool for love.

990
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,054
Victoria never wanted
Polly for her petting zoo.

991
01:05:57,153 --> 01:06:00,396
"Terrine of Tiger, Black Rhino Ragout,

992
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,593
"Panda Face Fritters"?

993
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:05,901
I've discovered the Queen
is a member of a terrible secret

994
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,669
dining society.

995
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,438
Kings, queens, emperors from
around the world,

996
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:13,241
they meet on her flagship, the QV1,

997
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:18,875
to eat the rarest and most
endangered creatures they can find.

998
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,148
This year, the highlight is...

999
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:24,780
"Dodo a l'Orange"?

1000
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,260
She's going to eat Polly?

1001
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,590
It's all my fault.

1002
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,063
I'm an awful human being.
I'll never get a girlfriend.

1003
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:34,563
Now pull yourself together, man.

1004
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,229
Now listen, Charles,
we've all done something unforgivable.

1005
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:38,897
I've betrayed my pirate honor,

1006
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:42,408
you've betrayed science,
and Mr. Bobo's betrayed the animal kingdom.

1007
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,568
- We've got to rescue her.
- Us?

1008
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:47,842
Against the crowned heads
of the world on an impregnable warship?

1009
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,312
It's impossible odds!

1010
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:51,477
It's only impossible
if you stop to think about it.

1011
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,985
Come on, we didn't evolve from slugs

1012
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,519
just to sit here
drinking our own sweat, now, did we?

1013
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:56,682
Are you with us, Mr. Bobo?

1014
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:02,651
Oh, I say.

1015
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,086
Well, pah!

1016
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:05,598
We can do without the monkey-man.

1017
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,361
Sorry, what was that about slugs?

1018
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:10,525
No time for that now. Come on.

1019
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:10,867


1020
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,267
Prepare to be boarded, nerds.

1021
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,350
It's true! You can see down ladies' tops.

1022
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,619
Keep pedaling, Charles.

1023
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,390
Help!

1024
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:13,130
Neptune's nostrils. Not a thing.

1025
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,605
Where the devil can she be?

1026
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:21,608
Captain?

1027
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,844
Pedal faster, Chuck!

1028
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:38,657
But how on earth do we get on board?

1029
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:41,394
This might sting a bit.

1030
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,690
I really don't...

1031
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,227
Catch hold of something!

1032
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:46,595
Good man.

1033
01:08:56,332 --> 01:09:00,178
How do you like my pygmy
elephant nuggets, Your Majesty?

1034
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,477
They're good, but not quite

1035
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:04,643
rare enough for my tastes.

1036
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:05,947
Not rare enough?

1037
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,486
Only three have been seen
in the last 50 years.

1038
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,783
As many as three?

1039
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,086
Well, well.

1040
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,721
Just wait until you see what
I've got for the main course.

1041
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:17,859
Gaston?

1042
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:19,225
Gaston?

1043
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:21,266
Are you there?

1044
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,324
Oui, Your Majesty.

1045
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:23,392
Gaston, I think

1046
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,302
-we're ready.
- Neptune's teeth.

1047
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,238
There's not a moment to lose.
We've got to find that kitchen.

1048
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,868
But it's hopeless.
Where do we even start to...

1049
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:34,503
So that's why I reckon,
in a straight fight, a shark

1050
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,481
-would probably beat a Dracula.
- No!

1051
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:39,679
Course, a Frankenstein versus a jellyfish,

1052
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,583
well, that's a different matter.

1053
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:45,951
All clear, Chuck.

1054
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,661
Chuck?

1055
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,128
It's all right, Charles, I'm coming!

1056
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,596
- Don't worry, I'll just...
- Charles?

1057
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:58,165
Just... Just hang on!

1058
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:02,833
Charles?

1059
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:07,574
Poseidon's lips!

1060
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:09,741
Are you all right, Charles?

1061
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,348
Hey, you there!

1062
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,782
What are you doing here?

1063
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:17,050
Well, now. Excellent question.

1064
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:20,227
All exotic animals should have been
delivered to the chef by now.

1065
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:21,654
- What?
- What is it?

1066
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:22,821
Some sort of duck?

1067
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,229
Yes, yes. That's it, yes.

1068
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,967
Quack, quack.

1069
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,398
Hurry up, then. Kitchen's that way.

1070
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,266
Yeah, come away! Go on.

1071
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:33,363
Quack, quack.

1072
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:37,436
Here we go, my Pretty-

1073
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:40,470
It's time to be...

1074
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:44,242
...délicieux!

1075
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,683
Mon dieu!

1076
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,864
Polly, come to Daddy.

1077
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,161
I'm sorry, old girl.

1078
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:03,032
I will never, ever leave you again. I promise.

1079
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,534
I will never leave you.

1080
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:08,773
Perhaps we'd best make a move.

1081
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,477
Yes, yes, yes, of course.
Back to the balloon.

1082
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:13,535
Gaston?

1083
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:14,872
Gaston?

1084
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,316
Hello ?

1085
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,245
Captain. No.

1086
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:22,547
Hello, Your Majesty.

1087
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,922
The dodo is coming out de suite.

1088
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,996
- This really isn't wise.
- Claudette est dans Ia bibliotheque.

1089
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,086
Please, I think we...

1090
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:33,258
But you know, Your Majesty,
you cannot hurry the cooking.

1091
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:35,700
Is a very delicate recipe, uh?

1092
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:39,470
And the dodo is a very fattening dish.

1093
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:40,905
Perhaps is not so good for you.

1094
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:43,806
And, you know, the calories,
they will go straight to your chubby thighs.

1095
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,607
- Captain.
- A minute on the lips

1096
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:46,772
is a lifetime on the...

1097
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,746
Zut alors!

1098
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,007
Well, well.

1099
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,173
Pirate Captain.

1100
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:52,515


1101
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,684
Here you are again. And...

1102
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,155
Oh. my-

1103
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,419
Is that Mr. Darwin behind those feathers?

1104
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,483
Hello.

1105
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:04,858
What a delightfully unexpected surprise.

1106
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:09,064
You know, I think, secretly...

1107
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:14,031
...I've always loved you, Charles.

1108
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,208
Gosh.

1109
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,002
Really?

1110
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:19,735
No!

1111
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:26,451
Give me my dodo!

1112
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,485
Now, come on, Vickie, be sensible.

1113
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,625
It's just you, a tiny queen,

1114
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,627
against me, a dashing terror of the high seas.

1115
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:36,560
En garde !

1116
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:37,722
Oh, dear!

1117
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,766
Poor defenseless me.

1118
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,158
What is a girl to do?

1119
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,067
Now, steady on.

1120
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:51,402
Now careful.

1121
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,807
Do you know why I really hate pirates?

1122
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:54,970
Childhood trauma, was it?

1123
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,141
Bitten by a pirate when you were a baby?

1124
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,441
Beard envy?

1125
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,545
It's because you're out-of-date.

1126
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,415
You're dinosaurs!

1127
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:06,651
All that "romance of the seas" guff!

1128
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:19,000
Right, where were we?

1129
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,173
Look at you.

1130
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:22,842
You should be extinct.

1131
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,610
Along with your little friend!

1132
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:45,095
Pity you can't eat pirates, really.

1133
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:52,604
But you'd probably taste of barnacles.

1134
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:56,709
Whereas, dear little Polly here is going to be

1135
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:02,006
absolutely delicious!

1136
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:06,746
Mr. Bobo?

1137
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,590
Give me back my dinner!

1138
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:13,320
- Captain, catch!
- Number Two!

1139
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:18,788
Sorry, Vickie.

1140
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,298
Dodo is off the menu.

1141
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:30,410
No, no, stop!

1142
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:34,403
Stop!

1143
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,675
Stop!

1144
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:45,657
I'm being squashed
by giant barrels of vinegar!

1145
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,158
Good work, Chuck.

1146
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,597
Number Two, what are you doing here?

1147
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:57,670
How did you find me? Where are the lads?

1148
01:14:57,793 --> 01:14:59,898
Don't worry, they're on the case.

1149
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,974
It's all thanks to Mr. Bobo here.

1150
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:10,915
He rowed halfway across the ocean
to tell us what you were up to.

1151
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:14,245
And, you know, I figured you

1152
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:16,619
tend to end up wrapped in
sausages facing certain death

1153
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:18,589
at about this point in an adventure.

1154
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:19,955
Yes.

1155
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,256
Yeah.

1156
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,796
Yes.

1157
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:27,592
Listen, Number Two, I...

1158
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:30,431
I realize I let you down.

1159
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,073
Sorry.

1160
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,474
I let everybody down.

1161
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,442
You know, I've...

1162
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:44,379
Well, I've done some pretty appalling things
in my piratical career.

1163
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:47,386
Like that time I used babies as squid bait.

1164
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,552
Or that other time I thought it would be

1165
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,850
okay to let a turtle drive the boat.

1166
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,824
But the thing is...

1167
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,155
I mean, what I'm trying to say is...

1168
01:15:56,652 --> 01:16:00,065
You decided to single-handedly take on
Queen Victoria's flagship,

1169
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,624
in order to rescue Polly.

1170
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,260
Yes, I'm afraid I did.

1171
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:09,474
That's terrifically idiotic.

1172
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:10,701
Yes.

1173
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:14,403
It's also the reason why me and the lads,

1174
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,141
well, we still think

1175
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:20,345
you're the best pirate on the seven sea...

1176
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:31,959
Gadzooks!

1177
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:34,194
No!

1178
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:52,908
Polly!

1179
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,077
Oh, no, you don't.

1180
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,178
Captain?

1181
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,859
Kiss your beaky little friend goodbye.

1182
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,945
That's it, Polly. Snip-snip.

1183
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:32,288
Come on, little dodo. Bitey-bite.

1184
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:34,188
The dumpy lady's got Polly!

1185
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:35,860
Snip-Snip.

1186
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:38,356
Bite it!

1187
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,160
Bite it, you stupid bird!

1188
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,063
Bite it!

1189
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:50,067
No!

1190
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,475
My dodo!

1191
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:52,603
Polly!

1192
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:54,839
My dinner!

1193
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:11,787
Barnacles.

1194
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,410
Well done, sir.

1195
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:34,476
Hey!

1196
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,181
Wah-hey, Captain!

1197
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:39,185
Fair play to you, sir.

1198
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:42,056
Wah-hey!

1199
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:48,993
This is our most unexpectedly
heartwarming adventure ever.

1200
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,537
You'll swing for this! Curse you!

1201
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,970
And after you've done swinging,
I'll chop your head off!

1202
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,806
I'll put it in a cannon and fire it into the sun!

1203
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:00,369
Does that mean he's not pardoned anymore?

1204
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:02,073
"Pardoned"?

1205
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:07,180
You'll be outlawed across the globe!

1206
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:10,849
There'll be a higher price
on your head than any pirate before you!

1207
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,750
The whole world will know your name!

1208
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:16,092


1209
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:21,195
Welcome back,

1210
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,234
Captain.

1211
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:49,726
- See ya!
- Bye!

1212
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,560
Bye-bye!

1213
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,367
Well, it's been a pleasure, Charles.

1214
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,104
Good luck with the science.

1215
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,838
- Thank you, Captain.
- And just a little tip,

1216
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:09,382
grow yourself a beard.

1217
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,075
It'll make your face look less lumpy.

1218
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,064
100,000 doubloons.

1219
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:37,911
Not bad, eh, Mr. Bobo?

1220
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:54,657
That... I...

1221
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,459
- Is this a bit of squid tentacle?
- Yeah.

1222
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,056
And that's my earwax.

1223
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:08,140
I keep telling you, it's never been about
the trophies or the treasure.

1224
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,767
It's about who you are, inside.

1225
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:13,836
I say, you're not...

1226
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:16,280
Not a woman
disguised as a man, are you, Number Two?

1227
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,441
No.

1228
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:19,849
Because that does happen
surprisingly often at sea.

1229
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,598
Well, come on, you coves.

1230
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:42,739
Those treasure chests
won't plunder themselves.

1231
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:44,140
Hoist the flag!

1232
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:46,304
Ave, aye, Captain!

1233
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:49,281
Set a course for adventure!

1234
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:11,666
You see? I told you.

1235
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:12,932
Didn't I tell you?

1236
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:15,668
Just added on for decoration, my foot.
