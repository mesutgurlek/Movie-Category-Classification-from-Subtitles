00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:49,151
HAPPY GILMORE

2
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:52,984
My name is Happy Gilmore.

3
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:56,989
Ever since I was old enough to skate,
I loved hockey.

4
00:00:57,794 --> 00:01:00,592
I wasn't really
the greatest skater.

5
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,192
But that didn't keep my dad
from teaching me...

6
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:06,709
...the secret of making
a great slap shot.

7
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:12,031
My dad worshipped hockey.
My mom didn't.

8
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:17,144
So she moved to Egypt, where there's
not a hockey rink within 1500 miles.

9
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,712
Dad took me to games
to see our favorite player...

10
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:23,184
...Terry O'Reilly,
"The Tasmanian Devil".

11
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:27,427
He wasn't a big guy,
but he feared nobody, just like me.

12
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:32,225
Handsome fellow, huh? He said
when I grew up, I could be anything.

13
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:35,511
But all I ever wanted to be
was a hockey player.

14
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:40,866
My childhood was going great,
but life is full of surprises.

15
00:01:48,394 --> 00:01:53,104
After the funeral, I was sent to live
with my grandma in Waterbury.

16
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:01,826
I was nervous,
since I didn't know her that well.

17
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:06,070
She dressed like Gene Simmons
from KISS to cheer me up.

18
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:09,112
She's the sweetest person
in the world.

19
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:15,273
After my dad died,
I developed a short fuse.

20
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:17,425
That kid stole my party blower.

21
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:21,587
Instead of asking for it back,
I hit him in the head repeatedly...

22
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,470
with a hammer.

23
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:26,550
Most of the time, I was quick to say
I was sorry.

24
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,829
Years later, I played junior hockey
and still hold two league records...

25
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:33,985
...most time spent
in a penalty box...

26
00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:38,307
...and I was the only guy to ever try
to stab someone with his skates.

27
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:43,071
After I graduated, I had
a lot of different jobs.

28
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:44,553
I was a road worker...

29
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,067
...a janitor...

30
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,665
...a security guard...

31
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:59,104
...a gas station attendant...

32
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:03,906
...and a plumber.

33
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:08,709
Lately, I've been working
construction. It's not bad.

34
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:10,786
I'm a good shot
with a nail gun.

35
00:03:11,114 --> 00:03:15,904
But one day my boss, Mr. Larson,
got in the way.

36
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:20,747
Apparently, he also has a short fuse.
Look at the monster.

37
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:24,989
He got in a few lucky punches,
but I feel I won the fight.

38
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:27,145
Anyway, those jobs
weren't for me.

39
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:31,069
I was put on this planet
for one reason--to play hockey.

40
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:36,507
It's my puck, baby!
Don't you ever touch my puck!

41
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:41,306
Is that Gilmore again?
How many times has he tried out?

42
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,907
At least ten times.

43
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:45,145
He has a lot of intensity.

44
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:48,826
Not a strong skater, though.

45
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:50,586
Nor the best puck handler.

46
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:56,268
But, my God...

47
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:01,306
What a shot.

48
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:06,666
It that goal regulation size
or what?!

49
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,426
Number one...

50
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:15,951
...number fifty-two...number sixteen...

51
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:19,152
They saw my power.
They won't dog me this year.

52
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:20,270
...number nine...

53
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:24,829
...and number forty-three.
The rest of you...

54
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:27,304
...better luck next year.

55
00:04:27,794 --> 00:04:30,831
Coach, what's going on?
What about me?

56
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:32,428
Gilmore.

57
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:35,472
I called your number,
didn't l?

58
00:04:35,794 --> 00:04:37,307
No, you didn't.

59
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:40,744
Well, better luck next year.

60
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,705
That wasn't very nice!

61
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:51,786
You think you're better
than me?!

62
00:04:56,994 --> 00:04:58,507
Where you going?
I got Subway.

63
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:00,028
I already ate.

64
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,790
I knew the guy working there,
so we got extra meatballs.

65
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:05,786
Great. I got to run.

66
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:08,104
Can you stay?
I had a rough day.

67
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:09,150
Bye.

68
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:10,986
-When will you be back?
-Never.

69
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:18,510
Terry, wait!

70
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:21,394
Wait! Hold on a second, babe.

71
00:05:22,194 --> 00:05:24,424
You're not going for good,
are you?

72
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:27,063
You're going nowhere
and taking me with you.

73
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:32,104
All you ever talk about is being a pro
hockey player, but you're not any good.

74
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:36,029
I am good! You know what?
You're a lousy kindergarten teacher!

75
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:39,471
I saw the finger paintings
you bring home--they suck!

76
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:45,545
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
They're excellent finger paintings.

77
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:47,308
Please don't go.

78
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:50,352
I'm not spending the rest of my life
with a loser.

79
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:51,470
I'm gone.

80
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:56,105
Good! Get the hell out of my life!
Who needs you? Beat it!

81
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:58,985
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

82
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:02,033
I just yell
'cause I get so scared.

83
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:04,584
Scared of being a nobody.

84
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:08,111
Why don't you come back
upstairs, honey?

85
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,631
I'll give you the old smoochy-smoo
kissy-wissy.

86
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,270
You know Happy
will make everything okay.

87
00:06:23,314 --> 00:06:26,670
I want to kiss you all over

88
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,145
And over and again

89
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:33,231
I want to kiss you all over

90
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:38,673
Till the night closes in

91
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:42,193
Till the night closes in

92
00:06:44,114 --> 00:06:45,149
Terry!

93
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:02,185
Sit tight.
I'll be right over.

94
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:11,473
Hey, you don't want breakfast?

95
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:21,710
Grandma?

96
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:26,904
Put that down!
It's my grandmother's!

97
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:29,714
Cut it out, kid.
We're just doing our job.

98
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:31,467
What are you talking about?

99
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:34,182
Your grandmother
hasn't paid taxes in 10 years.

100
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:38,904
Grandma, you didn't pay
your taxes?

101
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:41,952
I would have,
but I didn't have any money.

102
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,746
Where are you taking her stuff?

103
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:47,554
I'm not taking her stuff,
the government is.

104
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:51,469
It's not like I'm taking her stuff
over to my place.

105
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:53,068
Don't get mad at me.

106
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:57,228
But she's an old lady.
Look at her. She's old.

107
00:07:57,474 --> 00:08:00,511
You can't just take her stuff.
She's too old.

108
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:04,588
I'm sorry. I have no discretion.
Her stuff is now our stuff.

109
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:08,273
Well, at least we got the house.

110
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:11,950
I'll bring furniture from my place.
We'll be okay.

111
00:08:12,194 --> 00:08:15,470
Now you'll really be mad.
I'm taking the house, too.

112
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:18,991
My grandfather built this house
with his bare hands.

113
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:23,386
My grandma's been here over 60 years.
You can't take her house.

114
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:28,105
Mrs. Gilmore owes the IRS
$270,000 in back taxes.

115
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:30,664
We have to take the house.

116
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:35,465
If you can't repay the money in 90
days, we sell the house to someone else.

117
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:37,068
You hate me, don't you?

118
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:39,147
No, I don't hate you.

119
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:46,828
He hates me.

120
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:51,746
Don't worry-
things will be okay.

121
00:08:52,394 --> 00:08:53,668
Look at this place.

122
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:58,146
Silver Acres Rest Home.
It looks more like a country club.

123
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:00,544
Nice grass, nice people.

124
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:02,944
I hope you brought
your bathing suit.

125
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:05,834
You're going to make friends
in no time.

126
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:06,711
Mister!

127
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:10,792
Get me out of here!!!

128
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:14,792
Here, eat that!
Leave us alone!

129
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:18,463
Grandma, you could come
live with me.

130
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:21,024
Nonsense, dear.
You're a grown man.

131
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:24,630
I wouldn't burden you
like that and that's final.

132
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:27,752
Tell me, how is that nice girlfriend
of yours?

133
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:30,144
She got hit by a car.
She's dead.

134
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:34,149
Listen, I will get that $270,000
and get your house back.

135
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,589
I promise.

136
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:36,949
Oh, sure.

137
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:41,028
In the meantime, just stay here
and have some fun.

138
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:43,106
I will, dear. Don't worry.

139
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:47,274
Pardon me,
but it's nap time.

140
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:49,666
Nap time--that sounds nice.

141
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:52,384
-You go.
-I love you.

142
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:55,425
I love you, too, darling.

143
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:01,190
Buddy, do me a favor.
You see that lady?

144
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:03,584
She's very important to me.

145
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:07,111
I want you to take
extra special care of her.

146
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:08,947
You know what I mean?

147
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:12,152
I can't accept that.
But this is what I can do.

148
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:16,228
I can take extra special care
of that young lady for nothing.

149
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,745
I appreciate that.

150
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,146
Have a nice afternoon.

151
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:27,344
Sir, could I trouble you for a glass of
warm milk? It helps put me to sleep.

152
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:30,711
You could trouble me for a warm glass
of shut the hell up.

153
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:34,784
Go to sleep
or I will put you to sleep.

154
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,231
Check out the name tag.
You're in my world now, Grandma.

155
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:40,066
Oh, dear.

156
00:10:42,154 --> 00:10:45,032
Bet you I can hit a ball
past that tree.

157
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,265
Twenty bucks says you can't.

158
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,392
Morons, I told you I want to watch
the hockey game.

159
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:53,023
Cut the golf sissy crap
and finish up.

160
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:54,309
Oh, relax.

161
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:58,069
You can enjoy your grandma's
possessions for another half hour.

162
00:11:00,714 --> 00:11:03,274
Oh, you got a hold of that one!

163
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:05,994
-You try it.
-It's not as easy as it looks.

164
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:08,543
Sorry, ladies.
I'm not the golfing type.

165
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,944
You hit a ball past my ball...

166
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:14,550
...we'll finish work so you can watch
your hockey game.

167
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:16,705
Give me the stupid club.

168
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,066
Look at this stupid thing.

169
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:27,670
This will be hilarious.
Look how he's standing.

170
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:29,986
You like that?

171
00:11:43,514 --> 00:11:44,947
Holy shit.

172
00:11:45,194 --> 00:11:45,990
Back to work.

173
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:47,986
That house is 400 yards away.

174
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:49,110
Is that good?

175
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:51,822
-That's unbelievable.
-Beginner's luck.

176
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:54,226
I bet $20 you can't do it again.

177
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:55,748
Bring it on.

178
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:10,704
You boys are going to pay
for that--

179
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:15,514
-You hit him!
-He shouldn't have been standing there.

180
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,064
One more time.
Double or nothing.

181
00:12:18,314 --> 00:12:19,588
You better pay up.

182
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:32,551
Oops. Maybe we should
get back inside.

183
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:35,434
You made a bet.
Pay the man.

184
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:54,466
Thanks. Tell your friends.

185
00:12:54,794 --> 00:12:56,705
Step right up, folks!

186
00:12:56,954 --> 00:13:01,584
See if you can outdrive the amazing
Golf Ball, uh, Whacker Guy!

187
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:06,146
That's great.

188
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:07,669
Very good.

189
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:12,707
Bend your knees. Remember,
it's in the hips. You're doing great.

190
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:14,547
It's in the hips.

191
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,262
Fifty bucks I can hit it
over the highway.

192
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:27,665
That's real good.

193
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:31,104
So long, sucker.

194
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:37,665
How often do you play?

195
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:39,188
This is my first time.

196
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:42,942
You should play
in the Waterbury Open tomorrow.

197
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:45,105
Yeah, right, I'll see you there.

198
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:50,786
He's going to play.

199
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:53,504
And, by God,
he's going to win.

200
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:05,347
Mister, you need a helmet.

201
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,107
Don't worry about it.

202
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:15,026
Yeah, bring that shit on.

203
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:17,029
I love it.

204
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:18,787
Awesome.

205
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:21,344
God, that hurt,
but I'm okay.

206
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:23,266
What the hell
are you doing?

207
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:27,189
Just 364 more days till the next
hockey tryouts. I got to get tough.

208
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:30,787
God, that felt good.

209
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:33,184
Cut that out.
You're making me sick.

210
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:37,345
So you're a hockey player.

211
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:40,472
You got to give that up
and concentrate on golf.

212
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,669
Who are you?

213
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,303
I'm the club pro here--
Chubbs Peterson.

214
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:48,706
I'm offering to teach you
how to play golf, personally, for free.

215
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:49,909
No.

216
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,906
You don't know who I am,
do you?

217
00:14:52,154 --> 00:14:53,428
No, I don't.

218
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,746
Back in 1965...

219
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:59,749
...Sports Illustrated said I would be
the next Arnold Palmer.

220
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:00,949
What happened?

221
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:03,344
I wasn't allowed
to play pro anymore.

222
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:05,744
I'm sorry.
Because you're black?

223
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:08,633
Hell, no.
An alligator bit my hand off.

224
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,149
Oh, my God!

225
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:13,671
Tournament in Florida.
My ball went down by a lake.

226
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,987
Damn alligator just popped up!
Cut me down in my prime.

227
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:22,387
But I tore one of that bastard's eyes
out. Look at that.

228
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:24,706
You're pretty sick, Chubbs.

229
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:26,467
I've never seen anyone...

230
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:30,229
...who can hit the ball
half as far as you. You got real talent.

231
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:34,786
That's nice of you to say, but
I trained all my life to play hockey.

232
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:38,311
Golf is no different--requires talent,
self-discipline.

233
00:15:38,714 --> 00:15:41,103
Golf requires goofy pants
and a fat ass.

234
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:44,152
Talk to my neighbor--a great golfer.
Huge ass.

235
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:47,909
I bet your neighbor can't drive
the ball 400 yards.

236
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:52,466
I bet your neighbor doesn't have a shot
to get on the Pro Tour.

237
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:54,628
How would I do that?

238
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:57,832
You win the Open tomorrow,
you're on the Pro Tour.

239
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:01,111
Then, who knows? Maybe you'll win
the Tour Championship.

240
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:03,346
Get that gold jacket
I never got.

241
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,143
Gold jacket, green jacket--
who cares?

242
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:14,151
Don't worry. It's made of wood--
real sturdy.

243
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:21,505
Sorry about that.

244
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,553
It was good to meet you,
but, uh....

245
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:27,826
I'm out of here.

246
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:30,144
This is not real smart, kid.

247
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:33,591
I thought you were pro material,
primed for the big bucks.

248
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:41,669
Hey, Chubbs...

249
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:43,746
...what kind of big bucks?

250
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:53,830
Stupid golf clubs.
Why the hell am I doing this?

251
00:16:57,514 --> 00:17:00,074
Whoa--must be Burt Reynolds
or something.

252
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:03,908
Good morning!

253
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:08,387
Isn't this great? Blue skies,
fresh-cut grass, birds chirping.

254
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:12,946
You going to recite me a poem?
Geez, you love this golf stuff.

255
00:17:13,594 --> 00:17:16,791
A guy your size--why not play
a real sport, like football?

256
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:20,071
My mama wouldn't let me.
Said it was too dangerous.

257
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:21,986
Yeah, good call.

258
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:24,147
Hey, who's that?

259
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:28,389
The shorter guy is Doug Thompson,
president of the Tour.

260
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,627
The other guy is Shooter McGavin,
leading money winner this year.

261
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,069
Who's the girl?

262
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:37,829
I'm Virginia Venit, Director
of Public Relations for the Tour.

263
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:42,386
Of course. I've heard you've done
some really interesting things.

264
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:45,353
Right now I'm working
on a promotion--

265
00:17:45,674 --> 00:17:49,030
You know what would be great?
lf I could get a Pepsi.

266
00:17:49,514 --> 00:17:50,549
Sure.

267
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:53,507
Oh, miss?

268
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,029
Diet.

269
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:57,188
Right.

270
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,953
Hey, thanks for dressing up.

271
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:04,709
If I wore clothes like those,
I'd have to kick my own ass.

272
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:06,308
Good morning, everyone.

273
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:11,105
Welcome to the Waterbury Open.
Before we begin, I have a treat for you.

274
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:13,504
Ladies and gentlemen,
Shooter McGavin.

275
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:22,871
Thank you, Doug.
I saw Doug play yesterday.

276
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:26,390
He spends more time in the sand
than David Hasselhoff.

277
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:29,183
Let me get serious.
You're all aware...

278
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:33,427
...today's winner will be invited
to join the Pro Tour.

279
00:18:33,674 --> 00:18:36,313
Although only one will become
my colleague...

280
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:38,624
...all of you are now my friends.

281
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,384
Thank you.
Now go get 'em!

282
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:51,584
Next up: Lafferty, Daniel
and Gilmore...Happy.

283
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:56,064
Where you taking
those clubs, punk?!

284
00:18:58,394 --> 00:18:59,986
Mr. Gilmore,
I'm your caddy.

285
00:19:00,394 --> 00:19:02,624
Sorry. I'll carry these.

286
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,710
They're my grandfather's.
They're pretty old.

287
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:07,584
What should I do then?

288
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,984
Why don't you just watch me...

289
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,873
...and make sure
I don't do anything stupid?

290
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,073
Mr. Gilmore, Mr. Lafferty
is teeing off now.

291
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:20,225
Okay. Good luck, buddy.

292
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:23,347
Get out of the way.

293
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:33,345
Where were you that time,
dipshit?

294
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:48,864
Probably the best I'll hit
all day.

295
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:50,946
Mr. Gilmore, you're up.

296
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:13,269
Damn it!

297
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:16,309
Time!

298
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:20,151
Relax. Do what we discussed.
Don't look at the green.

299
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:23,431
Hit the ball. There's no goalie
anywhere to block it.

300
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:27,110
Remember, it's all in the hip.
Come on. Work with me.

301
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,631
It's all in the hips.
All in the hips.

302
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:33,343
It's all in the hips.

303
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:34,629
Get off me!

304
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:37,752
Just easing the tension.
Just easing the tension.

305
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:40,144
Well, ease it on someone else.

306
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,426
What the hell?

307
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:05,344
Good. Now we just worry
about putting.

308
00:21:05,674 --> 00:21:07,107
Oh, yeah. Putting.

309
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,945
Remember what I said.

310
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:13,992
Use your shoulders
to push the ball, not the arms.

311
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:15,826
Don't break the wrist.

312
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:20,226
Whoa, you're confusing me.
Just let me put the ball in the hole.

313
00:21:34,634 --> 00:21:35,589
Is he kidding?

314
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:56,707
This is pathetic.

315
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:11,427
Good shot.

316
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:12,709
It's about time.

317
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:17,345
True. I just couldn't get the ball in
the hole. I wanted to, but I couldn't.

318
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:49,343
He shoots, he scores!

319
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:54,464
That was much easier than putting.
I should try and do that every time.

320
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:56,068
Good plan.

321
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:58,225
-Did you see that?
-Yes. Nice.

322
00:22:58,474 --> 00:23:00,863
He got a hole in one
on a par four.

323
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:02,388
I said I saw it.

324
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:05,671
I hope he wins.
He's a publicist's dream.

325
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:10,146
A guy who can drive the ball
that far--he could really draw a crowd.

326
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:14,228
So could a golfer with an arm
growing out of his ass.

327
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:26,470
Now, you make this one
in four or less shots...

328
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:28,227
...you win the tournament.

329
00:24:28,394 --> 00:24:29,349
Four shots.

330
00:24:30,314 --> 00:24:34,148
Think of it this way. The other team
has pulled their goalie.

331
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,830
It's wide open.
All you have to do is tap it in.

332
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:40,067
I can do that.

333
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:00,704
Don't worry.
You're doing fine.

334
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:04,549
All you have to do is tap it in.
Just tap it in.

335
00:25:05,514 --> 00:25:07,584
Just tap it in.

336
00:25:13,674 --> 00:25:18,145
Just tap it in. Just tap it in.
Give it a little tappy.

337
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:19,907
Tap, tap, tap-a-roo.

338
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:25,506
Grandma, Grandma...

339
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,904
...Grandma, Grandma.

340
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:32,387
All right!

341
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:45,343
He's going to be on the Tour.
Super.

342
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,466
That's cute.

343
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:56,064
Mr. Gilmore, Virginia Venit.
I'm P.R. Director of the Tour.

344
00:25:56,394 --> 00:25:57,349
Nice to meet you.

345
00:25:57,594 --> 00:25:59,027
Congratulations.

346
00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:02,869
I saw that hole in one on a par four.
That must be a record.

347
00:26:03,114 --> 00:26:05,025
I got a hockey record.

348
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:08,869
I tried to stab someone with my skate.
Nobody else ever did that.

349
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:10,629
That's wonderful.

350
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:13,752
I am a bit bummed.
I thought we got money for this.

351
00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:18,784
Cheer up. Next week in Portland,
the winner takes home $216,000.

352
00:26:19,514 --> 00:26:21,027
And the guy
who comes in last?

353
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:22,948
$2,400.

354
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:25,754
So no matter what,
I'll get some money.

355
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:32,550
Yeah. Well, I'll see you
next week then.

356
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:34,308
Bye.

357
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:40,231
I hate to admit this,
but this is my first trophy.

358
00:26:40,554 --> 00:26:42,943
I wish that goofy golf guy
wasn't on top.

359
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:45,269
Maybe I'll put a hockey guy
on instead.

360
00:26:45,514 --> 00:26:47,266
Happy, shut your trap.

361
00:26:47,754 --> 00:26:49,984
-You were great out there today.
-Thank you.

362
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:53,032
But not that great.
A lot of that was luck.

363
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:55,993
Some might call it luck.
I like to call it...

364
00:26:56,234 --> 00:26:58,145
...well, luck, I guess.
So what?

365
00:26:58,394 --> 00:27:00,225
Don't join the Pro Tour yet.

366
00:27:00,714 --> 00:27:03,274
We got work to do
before you go against professionals.

367
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:06,074
Forget it.
I'll pick up the rest as I go.

368
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:10,148
Don't be a fool! People would kill
to hit the long ball like you.

369
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:13,033
You got an advantage
over any other golfer.

370
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:15,504
By developing the rest
of your game...

371
00:27:15,754 --> 00:27:17,346
...you'd be unstoppable.

372
00:27:17,674 --> 00:27:19,904
You're right,
but I need money.

373
00:27:20,234 --> 00:27:24,705
Don't be an asshole. Give me six
months. I'll work with you every day.

374
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:29,984
No, I got to go. I appreciate
everything. Wish me luck.

375
00:27:33,994 --> 00:27:36,144
Best of luck, kid.
Best of luck.

376
00:27:36,394 --> 00:27:39,272
Marty, shut up
and I'll tell you.

377
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:41,983
The price is $200 per quilt.

378
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:44,794
Well, this is handmade
quality shit.

379
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:47,754
When do you need them by?
Okay.

380
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:49,666
Good doing business
with you.

381
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:53,111
Okay, everyone. Turn up your volumes.
Announcement.

382
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:56,391
Good news--arts and crafts time
is extended 4 hours.

383
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,226
My fingers hurt.

384
00:27:58,554 --> 00:27:59,828
What's that?

385
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,146
My fingers hurt.

386
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:08,067
Well, soon your back will hurt
because you just got landscaping duty.

387
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,146
Anyone else's fingers hurt?

388
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:13,268
I didn't think so.

389
00:28:15,274 --> 00:28:17,834
Why do you make me act
like that, huh?

390
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,032
Mr. Gilmore!
Toidy's to the right, dear.

391
00:28:21,274 --> 00:28:24,072
-How's Grandma?
-Super. It's arts and crafts time.

392
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:25,986
Grandma is quite a quilter.

393
00:28:27,114 --> 00:28:28,945
That's a tremendous trophy.

394
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:31,583
Happy, I'm so glad to see you.

395
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:33,267
I'm glad to see you, too.

396
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:35,744
I think about you all the time.

397
00:28:36,074 --> 00:28:38,634
Looks like everyone's
having fun here.

398
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:46,631
Good news--I made
the Professional Golfers' Tour.

399
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:47,989
That's lovely.

400
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:50,623
You know what else is lovely?

401
00:28:50,954 --> 00:28:54,947
If I can beat those other guys...
we'll get the house back.

402
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:59,347
Oh, thank God! I can't stand to live
in this place another minute!

403
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:01,346
I thought you liked it here.

404
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:04,234
That orderly is nice.
Don't you like him?

405
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:05,828
Oh, I do.

406
00:29:06,074 --> 00:29:10,386
It's just that the air conditioner's
broken. I'm getting a little warm.

407
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:12,704
Let the kid fix it for you.

408
00:29:13,194 --> 00:29:15,583
Get the little twisty knobs.

409
00:29:17,034 --> 00:29:19,423
That ain't doing it. Okay.

410
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,546
Mister! Mister!

411
00:29:24,874 --> 00:29:27,104
Get this off of me! Mister!

412
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:28,867
I'll be right down!

413
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:33,507
You know that "Mister, mister" lady?
I think I killed her.

414
00:29:45,674 --> 00:29:49,508
Norman spends more time in the sand
than David Hasselhoff.

415
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:51,988
Come on, that was funny.

416
00:29:52,234 --> 00:29:54,794
-It was the first time I heard it.
-Drink up.

417
00:29:55,114 --> 00:29:59,426
Anyone tapped the keg yet?
I'll pump. I'm Happy Gilmore.

418
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:01,744
Mark Lye.
Welcome to the Tour.

419
00:30:01,994 --> 00:30:05,270
I heard about the ace you had
on a par four. Impressive.

420
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:07,106
You heard about that?

421
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:09,664
Cool. That's a nice jacket.

422
00:30:09,994 --> 00:30:12,713
You get one if you win
the Tour Championship.

423
00:30:12,954 --> 00:30:14,865
Oh, yeah? What's that?

424
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:17,344
Only the biggest tournament
of the year.

425
00:30:17,594 --> 00:30:20,154
Oh, really? Where's yours?

426
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:24,069
Good one. He's funny.
I'll have mine in three months.

427
00:30:24,394 --> 00:30:25,986
Not if I have anything
to do with it.

428
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:28,225
Whoa, look out.

429
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:29,988
You better look out.

430
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:33,351
If you're free, join us at 9:00
on the ninth green.

431
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:36,313
-What happens there?
-Secret of the pros.

432
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:37,987
All right, cool.

433
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:43,104
I'm out of here. I hear the Asteroids
machine calling my name. Peace.

434
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:45,983
And, Happy...dress nice, huh?

435
00:30:46,314 --> 00:30:47,906
All right, all right.

436
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,586
Almost nine o'clock.

437
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:23,833
Public relations lady,
you seen Shooter McGavin?

438
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:26,634
-No. Why?
-I need to beat the piss out of him.

439
00:31:26,874 --> 00:31:29,911
Let me guess--the ninth green
at nine trick.

440
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,746
It would appear so.

441
00:31:31,994 --> 00:31:33,507
He does deserve a beating.

442
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:37,588
But if you beat him up,
I'll have to explain to the papers...

443
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:41,827
...why the new guy beat up
Shooter McGavin. More work for me.

444
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:43,427
I don't want to do that.

445
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:46,711
Forget about Shooter.
He's just threatened by you.

446
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:49,184
He's afraid you'll steal
his thunder.

447
00:31:49,514 --> 00:31:51,266
That's nice of you to say.

448
00:31:53,354 --> 00:31:56,551
So, I'm going to go change now.

449
00:31:58,154 --> 00:32:01,749
My girlfriend's dead. She fell off
a cliff and died on impact.

450
00:32:01,994 --> 00:32:04,144
Really?
I'm sorry to hear that.

451
00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:10,227
You should get some sleep.
Tomorrow's a big day.

452
00:32:10,634 --> 00:32:12,226
You're right. It is.

453
00:32:23,434 --> 00:32:25,994
Hello. I'm Verne Lundquist,
with Jack Beard.

454
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:30,068
We have a nice crowd here
on this sun-sational April morning...

455
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:32,874
...for the 22nd annual
AT&T lnvitational.

456
00:32:33,194 --> 00:32:36,231
Here today are elite golfers
from around the world.

457
00:32:36,474 --> 00:32:40,547
The favorite is Shooter McGavin.
He's won three of the last four.

458
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:45,826
Thanks, man.

459
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:47,908
Here's my last buck.

460
00:32:48,154 --> 00:32:49,746
This is the last time.

461
00:32:49,994 --> 00:32:53,669
He's just trying to make some money.
Leave him alone.

462
00:32:55,594 --> 00:32:57,505
I don't know why I'm winning.

463
00:32:57,834 --> 00:33:00,792
I'm in the zone.
The hole seems to get bigger.

464
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:02,387
You like being the favorite?

465
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:05,910
I'm not. With the great players here,
anyone could win.

466
00:33:06,154 --> 00:33:07,587
I'll just do my best.

467
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:11,509
The real favorite is Portland. Every
time I visit, it's harder to leave.

468
00:33:11,754 --> 00:33:14,632
Must be something in the water.
Well, time to play golf.

469
00:33:14,874 --> 00:33:16,068
Good luck.

470
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,673
I'm a hockey player
playing golf today.

471
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:20,869
Name?

472
00:33:21,114 --> 00:33:22,229
Happy Gilmore.

473
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,226
The guy with the long drive.

474
00:33:24,474 --> 00:33:27,352
-Caddy's name?
-You haven't given me one yet.

475
00:33:27,594 --> 00:33:29,824
On the Pro Tour,
you provide your own.

476
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:31,588
Really?

477
00:33:33,354 --> 00:33:34,469
Okay.

478
00:33:36,554 --> 00:33:39,273
Easy with those clubs.
They're antiques.

479
00:33:41,514 --> 00:33:44,233
Gary Potter. Great to have you
on the Tour.

480
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:48,786
I feel a lot of solid energy coming
out of you. Good positive aura.

481
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:50,626
Nice to meet you.

482
00:33:50,954 --> 00:33:54,151
Is it always like this--TV cameras,
people and stuff?

483
00:33:54,394 --> 00:33:56,783
Yeah, a lot of pressure.
Rise above it.

484
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:59,832
Harness in the good energy,
block out the bad.

485
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:02,144
Harness energy, block bad.

486
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:05,034
Feel the flow, Happy.
It's circular.

487
00:34:05,354 --> 00:34:06,787
It's like a carousel.

488
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:09,912
You get on the horse.
It goes up, down and around.

489
00:34:10,154 --> 00:34:14,147
Circular. Circle. With the music,
the flow. All good things.

490
00:34:14,634 --> 00:34:17,671
Okay. Well, great. Thanks.
Nice to meet you.

491
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:19,748
Psycho.

492
00:34:20,234 --> 00:34:22,464
Next to tee off,
Happy Gilmore.

493
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:25,666
Give me a club.

494
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:28,708
I'll get it.

495
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:43,590
Fu--, sh--, fu--, ass--

496
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:53,669
Sorry.

497
00:34:58,474 --> 00:34:59,429
Psycho.

498
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,674
What a shot
by Happy Gilmore!

499
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:19,746
Who the hell is
Happy Gilmore?

500
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:42,827
Oh, yeah!

501
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:45,709
I got it!

502
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:48,429
Like that, baby?

503
00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:51,234
Plenty more
where that came from!

504
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,384
Get Virginia Venit in here, now.

505
00:35:55,634 --> 00:35:57,067
Use a five iron.

506
00:35:57,314 --> 00:35:59,623
You think so?
Give me my wedge.

507
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:16,111
Five iron, huh?
You're fired. Bye-bye.

508
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:34,425
What are you doing, Happy--riding
a bull? You're acting like a damn fool!

509
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:43,789
Doing the bull dance.
Feeling the flow. Working it.

510
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:47,151
On the 18th green, Shooter McGavin
putts for the win.

511
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:51,467
His crowd seems unusually small
for this type of moment.

512
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,633
Most people are over watching
Happy Gilmore.

513
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:01,466
He's the talk of the course...

514
00:37:01,714 --> 00:37:04,990
...with his huge drives
and bizarre behavior.

515
00:37:05,234 --> 00:37:09,386
He's on the 17th green right now,
having trouble closing out his day.

516
00:37:09,714 --> 00:37:14,026
Happy, the ball has its own energy
or life force, if you will.

517
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:17,232
Its natural environment
is in the hole.

518
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:19,146
Why don't you send him home?

519
00:37:19,794 --> 00:37:22,513
His bags are packed.
He has his plane ticket.

520
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:24,426
Bring him to the airport.

521
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:26,109
Send him home.

522
00:37:27,474 --> 00:37:29,863
Send him home.
I'll send him home.

523
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:32,583
It's time to go home, ball.

524
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:39,392
Son of a bitch ball!
Why didn't you go home?!

525
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:43,627
That's your home! Are you too good
for your home?! Answer me!

526
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:46,263
Suck my white ass, ball!

527
00:37:52,274 --> 00:37:56,108
Draft a press release stating Gilmore
is being thrown off the Tour.

528
00:37:56,354 --> 00:37:57,946
I want to see it by 6:00 p.m.

529
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:02,187
You're right--his behavior is
completely unacceptable.

530
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:05,711
But golf has been waiting
for a player like this.

531
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,594
A colorful, emotional,
working class hero.

532
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:11,871
I will not tolerate this behavior.
Gilmore is gone.

533
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:13,866
I got a call
from the Dallas Open.

534
00:38:14,114 --> 00:38:17,629
They're deluged with calls
from people who want to see Happy.

535
00:38:17,874 --> 00:38:19,785
-They sold out.
-Already?

536
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:23,231
I know he's a little rough.
Let me work with him.

537
00:38:25,394 --> 00:38:28,750
Okay. Fine.
But he's your responsibility.

538
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,985
If he cleans up, he can stay.

539
00:38:31,234 --> 00:38:33,384
If he doesn't, it's your ass.

540
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:35,306
And any more of this...

541
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:40,107
...and he's gone.

542
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:49,068
Shooter! Shooter!

543
00:38:49,314 --> 00:38:51,384
What do you think
of Happy Gilmore?

544
00:38:51,634 --> 00:38:54,751
I didn't see him play.
I was too busy winning.

545
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:57,064
But a 450-yard drive
is impressive.

546
00:38:57,314 --> 00:39:01,546
Yeah. Where did he finish again?
Dead last? Yeah, he had a good day.

547
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:03,387
Did he really make
a 450-yard ace?

548
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:04,908
Where's my check?

549
00:39:05,154 --> 00:39:06,428
We mail them next week.

550
00:39:06,674 --> 00:39:07,948
I want mine now.

551
00:39:08,194 --> 00:39:09,468
I don't have any checks.

552
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:13,070
He got one. Give me
one of them big ones, I don't care.

553
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:16,428
Give me a beer, pal.

554
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,028
Put that on my tab.

555
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,993
You were the talk
of the tournament, Gilmore.

556
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,747
Wow, thanks a lot.

557
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:27,146
You sure crush the ball at the tee.
You'd do well in a long-drive contest.

558
00:39:27,394 --> 00:39:30,989
You'd make good money, traveling,
hustling at driving ranges.

559
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:33,794
I know what you're doing
right now...

560
00:39:34,034 --> 00:39:38,824
...and I don't like it. So just shut
your trap before I put my foot in it.

561
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:44,908
Don't turn your back on me.
Listen, this is Shooter's tour.

562
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:48,271
I worked hard, paid my dues--
now it's Shooter's turn.

563
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:52,587
Shooter won't let his reign at the top
be spoiled by some freak.

564
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:54,267
Did you call me a freak?

565
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:57,302
I was on this tour for one reason--
money.

566
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:59,624
Now I got a new one--
kicking your ass.

567
00:39:59,954 --> 00:40:02,343
I'd like to see you try.

568
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:04,269
Let's do it.

569
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:06,668
I meant at golf.

570
00:40:06,914 --> 00:40:08,506
What's going on here?

571
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:11,393
I was looking for the other half
of this bottle.

572
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:14,353
Oh, there's some of it
right there.

573
00:40:14,594 --> 00:40:16,824
-Why don't you put it down?
-I know.

574
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:21,708
Just stay out of my way.
Or you'll pay. Listen to what I say.

575
00:40:22,194 --> 00:40:24,105
Why don't I go eat some hay?

576
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:27,551
I could make things out of clay
and lay by the bay.

577
00:40:27,794 --> 00:40:29,227
What do you say?

578
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:36,434
Calm down or you'll get kicked
off the Tour.

579
00:40:36,754 --> 00:40:39,632
-That can't happen.
-It can, and I don't want it to.

580
00:40:39,954 --> 00:40:41,387
You could be a big star.

581
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:43,545
I just want to make
some money.

582
00:40:43,794 --> 00:40:46,991
You won't be around long enough
to do that if you don't behave.

583
00:40:47,234 --> 00:40:48,986
What do you mean by "behave"?

584
00:40:49,234 --> 00:40:51,464
No swearing,
no throwing clubs...

585
00:40:51,714 --> 00:40:54,274
...and especially no hitting
other players.

586
00:40:54,514 --> 00:40:56,266
You mean no fun.

587
00:40:56,514 --> 00:40:58,027
You can have fun.

588
00:40:58,274 --> 00:41:02,745
That's why I think people come
to see you. But keep it within reason.

589
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:08,424
I will work on what you call behaving.
But I won't act like a stiff.

590
00:41:08,754 --> 00:41:10,824
Fine. Thank you.

591
00:41:12,274 --> 00:41:13,707
Hey, um...

592
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:15,786
...you want to get some food?

593
00:41:16,114 --> 00:41:18,674
No, thanks.
I don't date golfers.

594
00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:20,825
Good. I'm a hockey player.

595
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:25,384
Just behave, okay?

596
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:32,427
Happy Gilmore approaches the tee
in the 72nd annual Cleveland Classic.

597
00:41:32,754 --> 00:41:35,632
Happy Gilmore!
Drive it 400 yards!

598
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:39,469
I can't believe I have fans.
I waited all my life for that.

599
00:41:41,394 --> 00:41:42,986
Don't be alarmed,
Mr. Gilmore.

600
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,271
I know we had our problems,
but I'm proud of you.

601
00:41:46,514 --> 00:41:48,186
Thanks a lot, Mr. Larson.

602
00:41:48,434 --> 00:41:50,345
It's good to see you again.

603
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,904
How's that, uh, thing feeling?

604
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:55,464
Terrific. The nail comes out
next week.

605
00:41:55,794 --> 00:41:57,864
Well, you hardly even notice it.

606
00:42:01,874 --> 00:42:03,626
Let's make a little noise here.

607
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:08,104
Come on!
I can't hear you!

608
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:35,465
Trying to reach
the green from here?

609
00:42:35,714 --> 00:42:37,067
That's not possible, sir.

610
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:38,349
I beg to differ.

611
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:42,188
Happy Gilmore accomplished that feat
no more than an hour ago.

612
00:42:42,514 --> 00:42:46,189
Well, moron, good for Happy--
Oh, my God!

613
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:57,309
Oh, my God.

614
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:08,110
Hey, Shooter,
you forgot your nine iron.

615
00:43:12,194 --> 00:43:16,506
A large and economically diverse crowd
here at the Michelob lnvitational.

616
00:43:16,754 --> 00:43:19,314
It's the tour sensation,
Happy Gilmore...

617
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:24,185
...who's attracting all types
to this course. I even saw one guy...

618
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:27,710
...wearing one of those
beer-dispensing helmets.

619
00:43:36,274 --> 00:43:39,152
Damn you people.
Go back to your shanties.

620
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:43,469
This is a biggie, pal.
I got to make some real money.

621
00:43:43,714 --> 00:43:46,023
What do you think?
Slightly downhill?

622
00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:47,389
And slanting left.

623
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:50,592
No, you think that
'cause you only got one shoe on.

624
00:43:52,274 --> 00:43:53,389
Oh, yeah.

625
00:44:07,154 --> 00:44:08,269
Happy Gilmore

626
00:44:37,954 --> 00:44:39,069
You got the ball?

627
00:44:48,274 --> 00:44:50,026
Happy Gilmore from nine feet.

628
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,106
Here comes the putter throw.

629
00:44:52,434 --> 00:44:57,064
Wait. He's restrained himself.
Maybe this is a new Happy Gilmore.

630
00:45:01,154 --> 00:45:04,510
Another tournament here in Dallas,
and Shooter McGavin wins again.

631
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:06,984
He's won here 3 years in a row.

632
00:45:19,794 --> 00:45:21,466
That son of a bitch!

633
00:45:21,874 --> 00:45:25,867
Give me my ball! Give it here!
Cough it up, you dirty bastard!

634
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:27,468
I'll rip it out of you!

635
00:45:27,714 --> 00:45:28,669
Give me--

636
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:30,668
Give me the ball.

637
00:45:35,554 --> 00:45:37,146
You have one eye.

638
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:39,948
Chubbs.

639
00:45:40,594 --> 00:45:41,709
You took his hand.

640
00:46:22,674 --> 00:46:25,871
That Happy Gilmore is a real crack-up.
He's a hoot!

641
00:46:26,114 --> 00:46:28,992
He's bringing in
some big crowds.

642
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:33,227
Today, one of his fans mooned me.
He had "HAPPY" written on his ass.

643
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:36,750
"HA" was on one cheek
and "PPY" on the other.

644
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,666
I love what he's doing for golf.

645
00:46:38,914 --> 00:46:42,589
-Well, I'm starting to come around.
-Everyone is.

646
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:44,267
Well, I'm not, Doug!!

647
00:46:44,514 --> 00:46:46,106
This man is destroying golf.

648
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:49,391
I saw two fat bikers in the woods
off 17 having sex.

649
00:46:49,634 --> 00:46:51,545
How can I chip
with that going on?

650
00:46:51,794 --> 00:46:55,628
-Kick him off the Tour.
-He hasn't broken any rules.

651
00:46:55,954 --> 00:46:57,307
He's a disgrace to the game!

652
00:46:57,554 --> 00:47:02,025
Yes, but our ratings are up.
We're attracting new, youthful sponsors.

653
00:47:02,514 --> 00:47:03,947
I'm sorry, Shooter.

654
00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:05,627
There's nothing I can do.

655
00:47:09,154 --> 00:47:11,873
Then I'll have to take care of this
myself.

656
00:47:12,754 --> 00:47:16,269
Grandma, I came in 9th place.
I won $35,000.

657
00:47:16,514 --> 00:47:18,106
So we'll get the house back?

658
00:47:18,354 --> 00:47:20,914
As long as I don't place last
the next two times...

659
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:22,587
...we'll get the money in time.

660
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:24,745
That's wonderful, Happy.

661
00:47:24,994 --> 00:47:26,507
I love you, Grandma. Bye.

662
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:28,267
Good-bye, darling.

663
00:47:32,914 --> 00:47:36,429
We should go on that date.
I've been pretty good lately.

664
00:47:36,674 --> 00:47:39,871
Oh? I hear you broke a rake
and threw it in the woods.

665
00:47:40,114 --> 00:47:43,629
I didn't break it.
I was testing its durability.

666
00:47:43,874 --> 00:47:46,752
I put it in the woods
because it's made of wood...

667
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:48,665
...and he should be
with his family.

668
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:51,866
At least I didn't punch anyone.

669
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:56,589
Okay, we'll go on a date.
But just as friends.

670
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,952
Slow down. I don't want to be
more than friends.

671
00:48:00,194 --> 00:48:01,786
I just met you.

672
00:48:05,714 --> 00:48:06,988
Fit you okay?

673
00:48:07,274 --> 00:48:10,152
I haven't skated
since I was a little kid.

674
00:48:12,274 --> 00:48:14,993
Can we get a little time here?

675
00:48:16,114 --> 00:48:18,992
For Happy Gilmore, anything.

676
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:23,786
You played ice hockey?

677
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:25,229
Shut up.

678
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,906
Oh, my God...power failure.

679
00:48:29,354 --> 00:48:31,265
It's very scary in here.

680
00:48:31,514 --> 00:48:32,629
Did you plan this?

681
00:48:32,874 --> 00:48:34,148
No.

682
00:48:38,314 --> 00:48:41,033
I thought we were going to be
just friends.

683
00:48:41,594 --> 00:48:44,950
What? Friends listen to "Endless Love"
in the dark.

684
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:02,069
This song reminds me
of seventh grade.

685
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,703
It reminds me
of my grandmother.

686
00:49:04,954 --> 00:49:06,228
That's kind of weird.

687
00:49:06,474 --> 00:49:08,465
She took me to see this movie.

688
00:49:08,554 --> 00:49:11,193
I had the biggest crush
on Brooke Shields.

689
00:49:12,314 --> 00:49:16,148
My grandma told me I should
write her a letter, so I did.

690
00:49:16,474 --> 00:49:19,272
I got a letter back
from Brooke two weeks later.

691
00:49:19,514 --> 00:49:22,074
But it was in my grandmother's
handwriting.

692
00:49:22,874 --> 00:49:24,466
Your grandma sounds sweet.

693
00:49:24,794 --> 00:49:28,309
She is sweet.
That's why I feel so terrible.

694
00:49:28,634 --> 00:49:29,749
Why?

695
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,945
No, forget it.

696
00:49:33,754 --> 00:49:35,824
You can tell me.

697
00:49:36,634 --> 00:49:40,786
She's stuck in a nursing home.
The IRS repossessed her house.

698
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:42,628
That's awful.

699
00:49:42,874 --> 00:49:44,307
That's why I joined the Tour.

700
00:49:44,634 --> 00:49:46,864
I'm close to getting
her house back.

701
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:49,833
Don't tell anyone.
I'm kind of embarrassed.

702
00:49:51,194 --> 00:49:53,503
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.

703
00:49:55,674 --> 00:49:57,107
I'll make you a bet.

704
00:49:58,074 --> 00:49:59,666
Do you always carry a puck?

705
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:00,869
Yeah.

706
00:50:02,394 --> 00:50:06,228
Now, if you get that puck
in the net over there...

707
00:50:06,554 --> 00:50:09,432
...l'll never bother you again.

708
00:50:09,914 --> 00:50:12,474
But if you miss...

709
00:50:13,274 --> 00:50:15,993
...you have to give me
a big, fat kiss.

710
00:50:16,434 --> 00:50:17,913
And you have to pretend
you like it.

711
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:19,509
Really?

712
00:50:19,994 --> 00:50:21,029
Good luck.

713
00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:35,028
Shit.

714
00:50:35,834 --> 00:50:38,143
Talk about your all-time backfires.

715
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:40,469
Happy...

716
00:50:43,994 --> 00:50:45,586
...l didn't see it go in.

717
00:50:57,914 --> 00:51:01,429
I'll give it all to you

718
00:51:03,034 --> 00:51:05,912
My love, my love, my love

719
00:51:06,554 --> 00:51:09,114
My endless love

720
00:51:26,114 --> 00:51:28,184
Welcome to soggy San Francisco...

721
00:51:28,514 --> 00:51:30,744
...site of this year's Pepsi Pro-Am.

722
00:51:31,234 --> 00:51:33,464
Hello, Happy.
I'm Bob Barker.

723
00:51:33,794 --> 00:51:35,705
What an honor.
Nice to meet you.

724
00:51:35,954 --> 00:51:38,104
We're playing together today.

725
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:41,462
That's funny.
Who am I really playing with?

726
00:51:41,714 --> 00:51:44,433
In a Pro-Am, each golfer plays
with a celebrity.

727
00:51:44,594 --> 00:51:45,549
Wow.

728
00:51:45,714 --> 00:51:49,787
Nick Faldo and I won last year.
I'd like to win this year.

729
00:51:50,034 --> 00:51:51,786
I'll do my best.

730
00:51:52,354 --> 00:51:53,787
Hey, Gilmore?

731
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:56,503
You suck, you jackass.

732
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:58,187
Shut the hell up.

733
00:52:00,434 --> 00:52:04,029
I'd love to punch that guy in the face,
but I'd get in trouble.

734
00:52:04,274 --> 00:52:06,185
You get this
on "Let's Make A Deal"?

735
00:52:06,434 --> 00:52:07,787
"The Price ls Right", Happy.

736
00:52:08,594 --> 00:52:09,549
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

737
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:12,103
It happens.
Let's play some golf.

738
00:52:17,314 --> 00:52:18,588
Jackass.

739
00:52:22,354 --> 00:52:24,026
The club went further
than the ball.

740
00:52:25,714 --> 00:52:27,227
What was that all about?

741
00:52:27,474 --> 00:52:32,264
It's just that it's rainy
and that guy.... It just slipped.

742
00:52:38,914 --> 00:52:43,385
Get a blanket and suntan lotion,
'cause you'll never get off that beach.

743
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:47,947
Just the way you never got
into the NHL, you jackass!

744
00:52:54,274 --> 00:52:56,026
The green's that way.

745
00:53:03,314 --> 00:53:06,192
You will not make this putt,
you jackass.

746
00:53:11,714 --> 00:53:13,227
Nice shooting, soldier.

747
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:19,385
All right, Happy...

748
00:53:19,874 --> 00:53:21,785
...nice and easy.

749
00:53:26,754 --> 00:53:28,984
That was not nice and easy.

750
00:53:33,554 --> 00:53:35,306
That guy is driving me crazy.

751
00:53:35,554 --> 00:53:39,229
What's driving me crazy is
you not getting the ball in the hole.

752
00:53:39,554 --> 00:53:42,273
Don't push me, Bob.
Now's not the time.

753
00:53:46,914 --> 00:53:48,188
Jackass.

754
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:54,586
This guy sucks!

755
00:53:55,634 --> 00:53:59,627
We haven't seen Gilmore play this badly
since his first day on tour.

756
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:02,832
He and Bob Barker
are now dead last.

757
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:07,067
You should be working at the snack bar,
not playing golf.

758
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:08,588
Relax, Bob.

759
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:13,146
There is no way you could have been
as bad at hockey as you are at golf.

760
00:54:13,474 --> 00:54:15,066
Okay, let's go.

761
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:19,232
You like that, old man?!
You want a piece of me?

762
00:54:20,034 --> 00:54:22,992
I don't want a piece of you.
I want the whole thing!

763
00:54:37,634 --> 00:54:39,784
Now you're gonna get it,
Bobby!

764
00:54:59,234 --> 00:55:01,225
The price is wrong, bitch.

765
00:55:11,954 --> 00:55:13,546
I think you've had enough.

766
00:55:14,594 --> 00:55:15,549
No?

767
00:55:18,434 --> 00:55:20,026
Now you've had enough.

768
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:22,108
Bitch.

769
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,392
That couldn't have gone better.

770
00:55:26,474 --> 00:55:29,068
Instead of hitting you,
he hits Bob Barker.

771
00:55:29,314 --> 00:55:30,269
Perfect.

772
00:55:30,514 --> 00:55:32,505
So, see you
at the next tournament?

773
00:55:32,754 --> 00:55:36,588
No need. This was on national TV.
Gilmore is gone.

774
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,509
Let's get something at the Red Lobster.
My treat.

775
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,028
Some other time.

776
00:55:42,274 --> 00:55:44,026
I thought we were friends.

777
00:55:44,354 --> 00:55:46,584
We are. I just have to go.

778
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:50,589
I'll be at the Red Lobster
in case you change your mind.

779
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:52,347
God bless!

780
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:54,188
There you are.

781
00:55:54,514 --> 00:55:56,744
Happy Gilmore,
come on down!

782
00:55:56,994 --> 00:55:58,985
Thank you, Shooter.
Sit down.

783
00:55:59,714 --> 00:56:03,389
So you got in a fight with a game show
host on national TV.

784
00:56:03,634 --> 00:56:05,226
That is not entertainment.

785
00:56:05,474 --> 00:56:08,591
This is not hockey,
no matter how much you want it to be.

786
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:10,904
I know that and I'm sorry.

787
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:13,145
But there was a guy out there...

788
00:56:13,394 --> 00:56:16,431
...giving me crap. It took all I had
not to hit him.

789
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:20,189
So you head-butt Bob Barker?
Who won that fight, anyway?

790
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:21,469
Enough, Shooter.

791
00:56:21,714 --> 00:56:23,784
The board has done the following:

792
00:56:24,034 --> 00:56:26,753
Fined you $25,000
and suspended you for one month.

793
00:56:26,994 --> 00:56:29,952
-What?! I got to play!
-What?! Kick him off the Tour.

794
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:33,153
The board thinks
that might be extreme...

795
00:56:33,394 --> 00:56:36,591
...considering the fact
that our ratings were...

796
00:56:37,074 --> 00:56:38,666
...the highest we've ever had.

797
00:56:38,914 --> 00:56:41,474
My grandmother's house
got repossessed.

798
00:56:41,794 --> 00:56:45,469
If I don't win more prize money,
they'll sell it to someone else.

799
00:56:45,794 --> 00:56:48,024
Whoop-dee-doo.
Get out.

800
00:56:53,154 --> 00:56:57,466
It's over. My grandmother
will never see her house again.

801
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:01,866
But you've made a lot of money.
You could buy her a nice condo.

802
00:57:02,034 --> 00:57:05,709
My grandfather didn't build
any condos with his bare hands.

803
00:57:06,114 --> 00:57:08,423
Damn it,
I hate that Bob Barker.

804
00:57:08,674 --> 00:57:11,711
There must be
another way to get the $50,000.

805
00:57:11,954 --> 00:57:15,629
I don't want to talk about it.
I failed, okay?

806
00:57:15,874 --> 00:57:19,230
Let me just enjoy the one thing
that makes me a bit happy...

807
00:57:19,474 --> 00:57:22,034
...this fresh, delicious, tasty...

808
00:57:22,274 --> 00:57:24,424
...meaty, turkey-filled...

809
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:29,304
...Cold Cut Combo. I eat three
every day just to keep me strong.

810
00:57:29,554 --> 00:57:30,828
Hey, Happy...

811
00:57:31,074 --> 00:57:32,666
...can I have one of those?

812
00:57:32,994 --> 00:57:34,586
Coming right up!

813
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,104
Talk about a hole in one.

814
00:57:42,434 --> 00:57:45,471
Subway sandwiches
will drive away your hunger.

815
00:57:46,514 --> 00:57:47,469
What do you think?

816
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:50,831
I love it. He looks so handsome.
And it makes me hungry.

817
00:57:51,074 --> 00:57:54,589
They gave me a card
that gives us free Subway for life.

818
00:57:54,834 --> 00:57:55,949
That's lovely.

819
00:57:56,194 --> 00:57:58,105
You know what else is lovely?

820
00:57:58,354 --> 00:58:01,551
That commercial puts us up
to $275,000.

821
00:58:01,794 --> 00:58:03,864
Let's go get your house back.

822
00:58:13,234 --> 00:58:14,826
What the hell?

823
00:58:19,794 --> 00:58:21,068
What's going on here?

824
00:58:21,314 --> 00:58:24,989
It's exciting. We're auctioning off
your grandmother's house.

825
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:28,431
You said if we got the money,
we could buy it back.

826
00:58:28,674 --> 00:58:29,948
You can buy it back.

827
00:58:30,634 --> 00:58:33,068
Bidding will start at $100,000.
Do I hear 100?

828
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:35,544
This is the exciting part.
Have fun.

829
00:58:36,834 --> 00:58:40,349
Look at all these people.
What's going on, Happy?

830
00:58:40,674 --> 00:58:41,948
Thank you, two.

831
00:58:42,274 --> 00:58:43,866
They're auctioning it off.

832
00:58:44,114 --> 00:58:46,833
Good. We'll get it cheaper
than we thought.

833
00:58:47,074 --> 00:58:48,985
Two fifty, thank you.

834
00:58:49,634 --> 00:58:51,704
Maybe not. Two seventy-five!

835
00:58:51,954 --> 00:58:54,104
Two seventy-five. And three.

836
00:58:54,434 --> 00:58:55,708
Three fifty down front.

837
00:58:56,034 --> 00:58:59,231
I have three fifty.
Seventy-five anywhere?

838
00:58:59,554 --> 00:59:02,910
Three fifty--sold to the gentleman
in the white sweater.

839
00:59:03,234 --> 00:59:04,747
What just happened, Happy?

840
00:59:06,354 --> 00:59:08,106
Go wait in the car, Grandma.

841
00:59:09,874 --> 00:59:11,865
What the hell
is wrong with you?

842
00:59:12,114 --> 00:59:14,105
I enjoy real estate speculation.

843
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:19,308
You touch me, I burn the house down
and piss on the ashes.

844
00:59:19,634 --> 00:59:21,147
What do you want for it?

845
00:59:21,714 --> 00:59:22,669
You know what.

846
00:59:23,074 --> 00:59:24,985
You off the Tour.

847
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:27,623
Quit, and the house is yours.

848
00:59:27,874 --> 00:59:28,909
Fine. I quit.

849
00:59:29,154 --> 00:59:31,065
No way. Happy, come here.

850
00:59:31,314 --> 00:59:34,989
He's right. I don't belong in golf.
I'm a hockey player.

851
00:59:35,234 --> 00:59:37,543
-What team do you play for?
-Easy.

852
00:59:37,794 --> 00:59:40,592
Face it, Happy.
You are a golfer.

853
00:59:41,394 --> 00:59:45,706
I did this to get Grandma's house back.
Now I can. No regrets.

854
00:59:46,114 --> 00:59:50,904
What do you think she wants more--to
get her house back or see you succeed?

855
00:59:52,994 --> 00:59:56,509
Maybe she can have both.
Hey, Shooter.

856
00:59:57,154 --> 00:59:59,304
The Tour Championship
is next week.

857
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:03,549
If I beat you, I get the house.
You beat me, I'll quit.

858
01:00:03,794 --> 01:00:06,592
You're going to beat me?
At golf?

859
01:00:08,594 --> 01:00:09,868
You're on.

860
01:00:10,434 --> 01:00:13,870
But you're in trouble. I eat pieces
of shit like you for breakfast.

861
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:16,264
You eat pieces of shit
for breakfast?

862
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,229
No.

863
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:26,911
That was great.
I know you will kick his ass.

864
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:28,826
That makes one of us.

865
01:00:29,074 --> 01:00:31,713
Take care of Grandma.
I'll walk from here.

866
01:00:31,954 --> 01:00:34,912
-Where are you going?
-To learn to play golf.

867
01:00:37,474 --> 01:00:39,863
I'm stupid, you're smart.

868
01:00:40,354 --> 01:00:42,424
I was wrong,
you were right.

869
01:00:42,914 --> 01:00:45,303
You're the best,
I'm the worst.

870
01:00:45,634 --> 01:00:49,309
You're very good-looking,
I'm not attractive.

871
01:00:49,554 --> 01:00:53,069
Okay, as long as you're willing
to admit that. Now...

872
01:00:53,314 --> 01:00:56,989
...are you ready to work
and do what I tell you?

873
01:00:57,314 --> 01:00:58,827
Believe me, I'm ready.

874
01:00:59,874 --> 01:01:01,466
Then let's get to work.

875
01:01:03,314 --> 01:01:05,703
I'm sorry. Here.

876
01:01:06,754 --> 01:01:08,187
Here's your pinky.

877
01:01:15,554 --> 01:01:17,306
"Happyland", just like me.

878
01:01:17,554 --> 01:01:19,784
Don't get excited.
I've been here before.

879
01:01:22,274 --> 01:01:26,267
This is embarrassing. I'm a
professional golfer, for God's sake.

880
01:01:26,514 --> 01:01:30,189
No, it's your short game
that's embarrassing. Let's go.

881
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:48,031
Just line up the putt.
Don't even look at the hole.

882
01:01:48,354 --> 01:01:52,666
Aim for a spot six inches
in front of the hole. Line up with that.

883
01:01:52,994 --> 01:01:54,905
Okay. Six inches.

884
01:02:16,994 --> 01:02:18,905
This one's very tough.

885
01:02:23,554 --> 01:02:25,306
He's laughing, having fun.

886
01:02:25,554 --> 01:02:27,784
Yeah, laugh it up.
Enjoy your night.

887
01:02:28,674 --> 01:02:30,426
Happy, concentrate.

888
01:02:37,154 --> 01:02:38,746
I hate that clown.

889
01:02:38,994 --> 01:02:43,465
Easy. If you can't beat the clown,
how will you beat Shooter McGavin?

890
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:53,226
You're gonna die, clown!

891
01:02:55,074 --> 01:02:57,952
Is that funny? I don't hear you
laughing now!

892
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,389
Enough.

893
01:02:59,634 --> 01:03:01,147
What? I can't do it!

894
01:03:01,634 --> 01:03:04,671
Come with me, Happy.
Come on!

895
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:06,985
You suck, you stupid clown!

896
01:03:09,154 --> 01:03:10,906
Remember, this isn't hockey.

897
01:03:11,234 --> 01:03:15,227
You don't play with raw emotion.
You can't putt angry.

898
01:03:15,554 --> 01:03:19,229
You must clear your mind
of everything else and stay focused.

899
01:03:23,874 --> 01:03:25,626
How can I do that?

900
01:03:25,954 --> 01:03:28,991
Think of a place
that's really perfect.

901
01:03:29,314 --> 01:03:31,384
Your own happy place.

902
01:03:31,714 --> 01:03:34,751
Go there and all your anger
will disappear.

903
01:03:35,074 --> 01:03:36,348
Then putt.

904
01:03:37,154 --> 01:03:38,428
Happy place.

905
01:03:38,754 --> 01:03:40,506
Happy place.

906
01:03:40,834 --> 01:03:42,586
Your happy place.

907
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:12,269
Now how do you feel?

908
01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:13,469
Better.

909
01:04:14,114 --> 01:04:15,069
Now putt.

910
01:04:36,834 --> 01:04:38,108
Your happy place.

911
01:04:44,754 --> 01:04:47,222
We took some giant steps
tonight.

912
01:04:48,034 --> 01:04:49,626
I'm really proud of you.

913
01:04:50,114 --> 01:04:51,229
Here.

914
01:04:52,194 --> 01:04:54,424
I got something special
for you.

915
01:04:54,754 --> 01:04:55,709
Thanks, Chubbs.

916
01:04:55,954 --> 01:05:00,505
It's the putter I used when I played--
slightly modified, of course.

917
01:05:00,834 --> 01:05:03,223
Man, this is excellent.

918
01:05:04,354 --> 01:05:09,064
You got the spirit of a hockey player
in you, so I figured--why fight it?

919
01:05:09,314 --> 01:05:11,544
I got something for you, too.

920
01:05:12,034 --> 01:05:15,071
If not for you, none of this
would have happened...

921
01:05:15,314 --> 01:05:17,544
...so I wanted to show
my appreciation.

922
01:05:21,314 --> 01:05:23,225
This looks nice.
What is it?

923
01:05:23,474 --> 01:05:24,429
Open it.

924
01:05:24,674 --> 01:05:25,629
Shit.

925
01:05:26,274 --> 01:05:27,309
Oh, man.

926
01:05:27,554 --> 01:05:29,545
Remember the 'gator
that got your hand?

927
01:05:29,794 --> 01:05:31,386
I got his head.

928
01:05:43,394 --> 01:05:45,954
First my dad and now Chubbs.

929
01:05:46,274 --> 01:05:49,630
Anyone I get close to, dies.
If I were you, I'd run.

930
01:05:49,954 --> 01:05:52,343
You can't blame yourself
for this.

931
01:05:52,674 --> 01:05:55,711
I guess that alligator
finally finished the job.

932
01:05:56,194 --> 01:05:57,707
I'm going to miss you, pal.

933
01:06:06,114 --> 01:06:07,706
How am I going to play today?

934
01:06:07,954 --> 01:06:09,626
Just remember
what he taught you.

935
01:06:09,874 --> 01:06:13,708
Congratulations, murderer.
You killed a golf legend.

936
01:06:13,954 --> 01:06:14,989
Beat it, McGavin.

937
01:06:15,234 --> 01:06:19,546
I'm dedicating my performance at the
Tour Championship to Chubbs' memory.

938
01:06:19,874 --> 01:06:21,785
I'm playing for Chubbs.

939
01:06:22,034 --> 01:06:23,547
I called it first.

940
01:06:23,954 --> 01:06:27,151
You want to beat him?
Beat him on the course.

941
01:06:27,394 --> 01:06:29,954
Yeah, I'm gonna beat your ass
out there.

942
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,344
Right. And Grizzly Adams
had a beard.

943
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:34,266
Grizzly Adams did have a beard.

944
01:06:37,514 --> 01:06:39,232
The golfers
of the Tour Championship...

945
01:06:39,554 --> 01:06:42,830
...are ready to begin.
There may be 63 professionals...

946
01:06:43,074 --> 01:06:44,553
...vying for the title
of world's best...

947
01:06:44,594 --> 01:06:47,870
but in the minds of the spectators,
there are only two.

948
01:06:48,114 --> 01:06:50,025
Tour kingpin Shooter McGavin...

949
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:53,471
...and bad boy Happy Gilmore,
just off suspension.

950
01:06:53,714 --> 01:06:56,592
Wouldn't you know it?
They've been paired together.

951
01:06:56,834 --> 01:07:00,349
I have some good interior design ideas
for Grandma's house.

952
01:07:00,594 --> 01:07:02,903
You know the bedroom
next to the stairs?

953
01:07:03,154 --> 01:07:04,428
Yeah, that was my room.

954
01:07:04,674 --> 01:07:07,142
I'm turning it
into my trophy room.

955
01:07:19,474 --> 01:07:21,146
It just may not be
big enough.

956
01:07:22,434 --> 01:07:23,549
All right.

957
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:40,908
You know what's pathetic?
You've been playing golf all your life.

958
01:07:45,474 --> 01:07:47,783
Let me show you
how we do it in the pros.

959
01:07:54,834 --> 01:07:56,108
That's got to hurt.

960
01:08:04,034 --> 01:08:07,549
Happy learned how to putt.
Uh-oh.

961
01:08:09,394 --> 01:08:10,952
Here's a free lesson.

962
01:08:17,034 --> 01:08:18,945
Can't learn that
on a hockey rink.

963
01:08:29,874 --> 01:08:32,263
Somebody's closer.

964
01:08:34,314 --> 01:08:37,033
After one day,
Shooter McGavin is leading.

965
01:08:37,234 --> 01:08:40,271
But the big surprise
is young Happy Gilmore...

966
01:08:40,914 --> 01:08:44,111
...nipping at his heels,
trailing by only one stroke.

967
01:08:45,674 --> 01:08:46,948
Shooter from the sand.

968
01:08:47,154 --> 01:08:49,714
Playing like he really wants
that jacket.

969
01:08:55,474 --> 01:08:58,147
Happy Gilmore answers back
with a birdie.

970
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:14,033
Happy with a long eagle opportunity.

971
01:09:15,954 --> 01:09:17,228
It's good!

972
01:09:17,874 --> 01:09:19,785
And Shooter can't believe it!

973
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,992
He is now tied
with Happy Gilmore!

974
01:09:26,034 --> 01:09:28,912
Uh-oh. A little too much zip
on that one.

975
01:09:30,354 --> 01:09:33,232
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

976
01:09:33,554 --> 01:09:34,828
No!

977
01:09:38,514 --> 01:09:42,348
I didn't see that. Did it go in?
I wasn't watching.

978
01:09:42,674 --> 01:09:46,986
I wasn't watching. I saw it go up.
Did it go back in?

979
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:50,466
At the end of day three,
Happy Gilmore has the lead.

980
01:09:50,794 --> 01:09:54,833
One has to be impressed with the vast
improvement in his short game.

981
01:10:13,554 --> 01:10:15,146
Donald, it's Shooter.

982
01:10:15,474 --> 01:10:18,034
Shooter!
It's great to hear from you!

983
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,430
Want to go to Sizzler
and get some grub?

984
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:22,307
No, thanks. Not hungry.

985
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:26,826
This call is about business.
I need you here in the morning.

986
01:10:27,154 --> 01:10:29,304
It's the final day
of the Tour Championship...

987
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:31,470
...and it promises to be
a classic.

988
01:10:31,914 --> 01:10:33,870
Happy Gilmore leads the pack.

989
01:10:34,154 --> 01:10:38,193
Is this a changing of the guard?
We'll know in 18 holes.

990
01:10:44,434 --> 01:10:47,153
Happy is really on today.

991
01:10:59,474 --> 01:11:00,543
There he is.

992
01:11:01,074 --> 01:11:02,348
That worm.

993
01:11:02,834 --> 01:11:04,426
Happy, look out!

994
01:11:10,314 --> 01:11:11,269
Are you okay?

995
01:11:11,474 --> 01:11:13,066
Volkswagen.

996
01:11:13,354 --> 01:11:14,946
Jackass!

997
01:11:30,194 --> 01:11:31,468
Jackass!

998
01:11:32,074 --> 01:11:35,953
You have no serious injuries.
Just keep off your feet for a few days.

999
01:11:36,234 --> 01:11:37,872
Forget it.
I have to finish.

1000
01:11:38,154 --> 01:11:40,873
Do what you like. What do I know?
I'm just a doctor.

1001
01:11:41,074 --> 01:11:42,507
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1002
01:11:42,794 --> 01:11:45,831
There is no shame
in throwing in the towel.

1003
01:11:46,034 --> 01:11:48,104
You must be careful
with your health.

1004
01:11:48,394 --> 01:11:50,191
Let's just play some golf.

1005
01:11:50,954 --> 01:11:52,546
I knew Happy Gilmore
was tough...

1006
01:11:52,754 --> 01:11:56,269
...but I can't believe he's playing
after being hit by a car.

1007
01:11:56,594 --> 01:11:58,824
Let's hope it doesn't affect
his game.

1008
01:12:02,634 --> 01:12:05,990
That's the first time he's failed
to outdrive McGavin.

1009
01:12:06,194 --> 01:12:09,709
Well, well, well. Happy Gilmore is
human after all.

1010
01:12:10,674 --> 01:12:14,826
Happy Gilmore is in trouble
if he can't hit the long ball.

1011
01:12:15,154 --> 01:12:16,428
If he has a chance...

1012
01:12:16,714 --> 01:12:19,786
...of winning today, he must do it
on the green.

1013
01:12:25,234 --> 01:12:29,705
He has to focus now.
He has to save this one for par.

1014
01:12:32,754 --> 01:12:35,427
That bogey drops him
out of the lead.

1015
01:12:35,794 --> 01:12:38,513
If he wants to stay in this thing...

1016
01:12:38,794 --> 01:12:40,227
...he has to calm down.

1017
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:50,509
Don't worry about your grandma.
She can live with me--be my maid.

1018
01:12:56,714 --> 01:12:58,625
Look at the cabbage
he's in now.

1019
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:02,349
Things just keep getting worse
for Happy Gilmore.

1020
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:07,303
Just remember what Chubbs said.

1021
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:09,545
"Go to a happy place."

1022
01:13:09,874 --> 01:13:12,104
"Go to a happy place."

1023
01:13:48,274 --> 01:13:49,548
God!

1024
01:14:01,714 --> 01:14:04,182
This looks like the end
for Happy Gilmore.

1025
01:14:04,234 --> 01:14:06,509
Shooter now has
a commanding lead.

1026
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:26,986
Happy, look who's here.

1027
01:14:27,314 --> 01:14:28,588
Grandma.

1028
01:14:29,394 --> 01:14:31,954
Happy, you look upset.
What's wrong?

1029
01:14:32,274 --> 01:14:34,947
I stink.
I'm not going to win.

1030
01:14:35,154 --> 01:14:39,625
Don't worry, sweetheart. The house
isn't important. It's just a house.

1031
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:42,189
Stop fraternizing with the help,
Gilmore.

1032
01:14:42,474 --> 01:14:45,352
Just hit your ball,
if you can find it.

1033
01:14:45,874 --> 01:14:46,989
Hi, Grandma.

1034
01:14:47,954 --> 01:14:52,266
Forget him. I just want you
to be happy, darling.

1035
01:14:54,794 --> 01:14:56,068
All right, Grandma.

1036
01:15:02,354 --> 01:15:05,073
Grandma wants me
to be happy.

1037
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:28,751
Chin up, Happy.
Don't feel bad about me.

1038
01:15:29,074 --> 01:15:30,826
I got my hand back, see?

1039
01:15:33,074 --> 01:15:35,634
We've only just begun

1040
01:15:37,714 --> 01:15:40,274
To live

1041
01:15:42,034 --> 01:15:44,912
White lace and promises

1042
01:15:46,994 --> 01:15:50,828
A kiss for luck
and we're on our way

1043
01:15:59,954 --> 01:16:04,425
It ain't over yet, McGavin. The way
I see it, we've only just begun.

1044
01:16:30,954 --> 01:16:33,991
Happy, the gold jacket's yours.
Shooter will choke.

1045
01:16:39,234 --> 01:16:40,189
Unbelievable!

1046
01:16:51,954 --> 01:16:55,947
Damn you people!
This is golf, not a rock concert!

1047
01:17:02,514 --> 01:17:03,629
Putz!

1048
01:17:22,194 --> 01:17:23,468
Happy...

1049
01:17:23,954 --> 01:17:25,546
...rules!

1050
01:17:38,674 --> 01:17:41,188
Happy Gilmore has charged
in the back nine...

1051
01:17:41,274 --> 01:17:43,469
...and is now even
with Shooter McGavin.

1052
01:17:43,794 --> 01:17:46,991
If Shooter doesn't get
out of the funk he's in...

1053
01:17:47,314 --> 01:17:49,544
...he may miss out
on the gold jacket.

1054
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:53,992
Ladies and gentlemen, the 18th hole
is a par three, 160 yards.

1055
01:17:54,194 --> 01:17:56,913
In the event of a tie,
there will be a play-off.

1056
01:17:57,194 --> 01:17:59,583
Mr. Gilmore,
you have the honors.

1057
01:18:00,754 --> 01:18:02,984
No matter what,
I'm having fun.

1058
01:18:03,314 --> 01:18:05,544
You're starting
to sound like a golfer.

1059
01:18:05,834 --> 01:18:07,586
I know. Keep it down.

1060
01:18:26,794 --> 01:18:30,309
Nice shot! Fifteen feet
short of the hole.

1061
01:18:41,714 --> 01:18:43,625
Shooter's ball is
in the woods.

1062
01:18:43,914 --> 01:18:47,463
Happy's on the 18th green,
where a car driven by a crazed fan...

1063
01:18:47,754 --> 01:18:49,346
...rammed the TV tower.

1064
01:18:52,114 --> 01:18:54,469
Let me through--
I'm looking for my ball.

1065
01:18:54,674 --> 01:18:58,508
This is golf, okay? Excuse me.
Thank you.

1066
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:05,229
Is this your ball?

1067
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:07,592
Yes, it is.

1068
01:19:07,794 --> 01:19:09,546
It struck my foot.

1069
01:19:09,874 --> 01:19:11,148
Doug!

1070
01:19:12,434 --> 01:19:13,867
Do I get a drop?

1071
01:19:14,994 --> 01:19:17,064
The rule says,
"Play it as it lies."

1072
01:19:39,754 --> 01:19:41,392
That's two so far, Shooter.

1073
01:19:41,714 --> 01:19:43,784
You can count.
Good for you.

1074
01:19:44,074 --> 01:19:48,113
And you can count on me waiting
for you in the parking lot.

1075
01:20:01,394 --> 01:20:02,668
You're still away.

1076
01:20:02,994 --> 01:20:04,905
I'm aware of that.
Thank you.

1077
01:20:05,994 --> 01:20:06,949
I can't see.

1078
01:20:07,154 --> 01:20:08,223
Hey, up here.

1079
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:23,623
Shooter needs this
to put pressure on Happy.

1080
01:20:23,914 --> 01:20:26,348
If he misses, Happy can two-putt
to victory.

1081
01:20:36,754 --> 01:20:38,472
Choke on that, baby!

1082
01:20:47,954 --> 01:20:49,069
Shooter.

1083
01:20:57,554 --> 01:21:01,388
If Gilmore sinks this, it will cap
an amazing comeback.

1084
01:21:18,354 --> 01:21:21,073
Great. Now I have a tower
blocking my ball.

1085
01:21:21,354 --> 01:21:24,710
We'll get it moved and you'll finish
tomorrow. Right, Doug?

1086
01:21:24,914 --> 01:21:28,429
No, he has to hit it now.
"Play it as it lies."

1087
01:21:28,754 --> 01:21:33,066
I hit it off Frankenstein's fat foot.
Those are the rules.

1088
01:21:33,394 --> 01:21:36,067
He's right.
Take your shot, Mr. Gilmore.

1089
01:21:37,234 --> 01:21:40,909
Virginia, just so you know,
my jacket size is 44 long.

1090
01:21:41,194 --> 01:21:44,391
And my right arm is a bit longer
than my left.

1091
01:21:44,914 --> 01:21:49,226
Hit it around the tower, sink your putt
and we'll go to sudden death.

1092
01:21:56,274 --> 01:21:58,185
Nah, I'll just beat him now.

1093
01:21:59,754 --> 01:22:00,709
Good luck.

1094
01:22:05,874 --> 01:22:08,263
Chubbs, I know
you'll help me here.

1095
01:22:42,354 --> 01:22:44,424
Oh, my God.

1096
01:22:45,234 --> 01:22:48,909
Incredible!
Happy Gilmore wins the gold jacket.

1097
01:22:51,954 --> 01:22:54,184
I love you. I love you.

1098
01:22:54,514 --> 01:22:56,106
And I love you.

1099
01:22:56,754 --> 01:22:58,984
Doug! It's impossible!

1100
01:22:59,314 --> 01:23:02,033
That's my jacket!
It's mine!

1101
01:23:02,834 --> 01:23:04,586
He stole my jacket!

1102
01:23:05,234 --> 01:23:07,304
I believe that's Mr. Gilmore's.

1103
01:23:28,434 --> 01:23:30,664
I will get you, Shooter!

1104
01:23:32,114 --> 01:23:33,706
Stop! Stop!

1105
01:23:34,834 --> 01:23:36,267
Be still!

1106
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:37,663
Don't!!!

1107
01:23:50,194 --> 01:23:51,468
-Coming?
-You bet.

1108
01:23:51,794 --> 01:23:53,068
All right.

1109
01:24:06,034 --> 01:24:08,594
Here's to Chubbs,
wherever he is.

1110
01:24:11,954 --> 01:24:13,387
Hey, Happy.

1111
01:24:15,954 --> 01:24:17,387
Nice jacket.

1112
01:24:20,114 --> 01:24:22,184
Who are you waving at,
Happy?

1113
01:24:23,794 --> 01:24:26,354
Nobody, Grandma.
Let's go home.
