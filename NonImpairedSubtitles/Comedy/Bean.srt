1
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,060
As you all know,
by the next timewe meet...

2
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,493
this angel is going
to be my wife.

3
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:12,442
But don't let this distract you.
Our work is not done.

4
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:14,950
Where arewe today?

5
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:19,452
Kids are killing each other
inschool playgrounds.

6
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:24,760
Half nudewomen are on every
billboard and magazine cover.

7
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:28,757
Songs have more dirty words
than clean.

8
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:32,129
Andyet I'm the one
they call crazy.

9
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:36,662
They don't know anything.
Do you know what Isay?

10
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:40,669
Drop the pills andsmokes
and come up for air.

11
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,480
We haven't exceeded our
humanity, we've destroyed it.

12
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:51,417
Let me remindyou, children,
that God burned Sodom.

13
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:53,846
He burned Gomorra.

14
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,026
If theworld doesn't want to
listen towhat I have tosay...

15
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:02,256
thenwe're headedstraight back
into the fire, all of us.

16
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,095
So long as you all follow me,
not us.

17
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,743
There are few places left where
you canstillsee thestars.

18
00:03:57,086 --> 00:03:59,611
Is thiswhat you
wanted toshow me?

19
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:03,486
.Would that be enough?
.Yes, of course.

20
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:09,294
Sorry, Maxwell. You're trying to
teach me and I'm missing it.

21
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:13,024
That's not it.
That's it.

22
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:16,000
An engagement present
from me to you.

23
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,799
Are youserious?

24
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:25,376
That's incredible! I've always
wanted to take a cruise.

25
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,739
Iwanted tosurprise you.

26
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:31,277
I've made a decision, Trace.

27
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:34,519
It's timewe all got to know
the power of our crusade.

28
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:49,132
Oh, God!

29
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,746
It's no coincidence.

30
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:02,174
What's the matter?
You'reshaking.

31
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:06,784
You're insane.
You are insane!

32
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,002
You misunderstood me.

33
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:38,944
Always playing games.

34
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,889
Where are you?

35
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:54,559
No one runs out on me.
You know that.

36
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:04,841
I'll findyou.
Where couldyou possibly go?

37
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,276
Come on!

38
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:52,254
Nobody betrays me.

39
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:51,843
Remember, you're llstenlngto
Hot V egas 102.

40
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:55,513
Hlghtomorrow, 107,
2degrees hotter thantoday.

41
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:41,893
How couldyou possibly
get arrested, it's legal here.

42
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,101
Goodwin, freeze to that chair.

43
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:55,040
Do youwant to tell me
what the hell these are?

44
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:57,152
Looks like astack
of case reports.

45
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,416
They 're yours, wise ass, late
and filled out incorrectly.

46
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,983
They 're allsolved, aren't they?

47
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:08,189
God damn you!
This city isn't your playground.

48
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:10,730
I'm not your nursemaid to
watch after you...

49
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,664
so youwill fill out
these reports correctly.

50
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:15,497
Youwill get back
on thestreet...

51
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:20,131
and remember you're a cop,
not a one man disaster area.

52
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,903
Get ahair cut.

53
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,810
Morning, chief.

54
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:31,977

00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:55,642
.He called my mum again.
.I thought hesaid hewouldn't.

60
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:58,177
Why?
Due to the restraining order?

61
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,645
You know Dad can't get enough
of abad thing.

62
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:05,378

Chief Hacket, L. V. P. D.

197
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,481
Allyou need to know
is I'm in control.

198
00:31:10,184 --> 00:31:13,779
The hotel is completely sealed.
There's noway in or out.

199
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,515
I have hostages lwon't
hesitate to kill.

200
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:20,559
To assume my powers are limited
is to make abig mistake.

201
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:25,164
Okay, I've got the message.
What exactly do youwant?

202

I'llshow youwhich part
of no you don't understand.

206

Take cover.

207
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,433
.Any sign of her yet?
.Nothingyet.

208
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:10,344
I'mshutting the place down.

209
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:35,033
They 'vesealed the entrance.
We can't get in or out.

210
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,898
The front entrance's blown out.

211
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:48,376
Everybody out.
Move, move.

212
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:53,652
She's not to leave
this building, understand?

213
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:57,052
Anyone trying to help her escape
lwant dead.

214
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:06,595
It's thisway.

215
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,428

219
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,613
What's going on around here?

220
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:33,120
Everyone's been through

221
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,755
She'sstill in the building.

222
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,600
Gamer, what do you have?

223
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:49,300
A bunch of empty rooms but that
only covers3O% of the hotel.

224
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:52,708
The other 7O% is about
3 millionsquare feet.

225
00:33:53,147 --> 00:33:55,672
If she's out there, it could
take days to find her.

226
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:58,113
We don't have days.

227
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,954
What was that?

228
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,657
Some of the bombs
wereset on timers.

229
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:15,393

Then if we're all about to die,

How would I know
any more than you?

261
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:09,467
Youwere running from the first
shot so drop the act.

262
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:11,474
Who are these cowboys?

263
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:17,349
They 're not cowboys
and they 're not robbers.

264
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,853
Not even terrorists.

265
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,751
They 're his personal army
sworn to his holy war...

266
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:30,364
convinced that they 're
saviors of the modernworld.

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,410
Because I used
to be one of them.

271
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,818
Great!This is getting
better and better.

275
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:16,168
This isn't the first time.

276
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:19,313
Two years ago he blew up
aship in San Pedro.

277
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:24,440
I remember, they never found
out whowas responsible.

278
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:28,744
Did it ever occur to you to
tellsomebody? Like the cops.

279
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:32,518
.Sowewouldn't end up here.
.Iwas running for my life.

280
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:36,720
The cops couldn't catch him
or protect me, I had no choice.

281
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:42,602
Ishould have known he'd come
back for me. Wewere engaged.

282
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:47,766
Well, that just takes the cake.

283
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,103
Nowonder I couldn't get
your phone number.

284
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:53,769
Your ex.boyfriend's
the Messiah.

285
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:59,448
It wasJo Lewlswho sald"you
can run but you can't hlde".

286
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,519
Hewas talking about
another fighter.

287
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:07,855
It took12 rounds, but he beat
the other fighter to apulp.

288
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:14,233
His opponent didn't have the
opportunity I'm givingyou.

289
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:17,667
I mthe only
way out of here.

290
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:20,500
Andyour last chance
to turnyour llfe around.

291
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:27,573
Look at the people next to you.
They 're agents of the devil.

292
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:31,707
The lies they tellyou
will damn them forever.

293
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:37,515
This is no freedom trail,
just aslow way to killyourself.

294
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:41,726
Which if you ask me is truly
the greatest sin of all.

295
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:46,260
There'sstill time.

296
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:50,368
Theworld I promised
youstill exists.

297
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:53,766
You just have to let
me take youthere.

298
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:56,773

the SouthWest quadrant.

302
00:40:14,128 --> 00:40:15,720

304
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:35,408

and four guys round the front.

305
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,284
Keep it hot.

306
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:07,873
Who does he think he is?
Moses?

307
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:15,787
And Jesus, and Manson,
and Hitler all rolled into one.

308
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:21,254
If he thinkswe're gonnawait
for him to exterminate us...

309
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:24,295
he's not the prophet
he thinks he is.

310
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:27,628
All hewants is me.
I can end this right now.

311
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:30,733
Oh no, you don't.

01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,471
.Where is everybody?
.Coming up right now.

465
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,603
Stop.

466
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:12,250
Thisway.

467
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:52,382
.Chief!
.Over thisway.

468
01:01:55,428 --> 01:01:56,861
Get down.

469
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:14,512
That's the part of"no"
you didn't understand.

470
01:02:38,471 --> 01:02:39,938
Stay here.

471
01:02:42,909 --> 01:02:45,377
She can't killyou.
Shewon't shoot.

472
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:15,274
It looks like you're running
out of believers.

473
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:19,077
Why don't you pack up
the arc and float away?

474
01:03:19,412 --> 01:03:22,848
The flood is coming.
Right now.

475
01:03:31,023 --> 01:03:32,991
Iwon't let you leave, Tracy.

476
01:03:35,862 --> 01:03:37,352
You better believe that.

477
01:03:42,768 --> 01:03:44,668
I'm gettingsick of this guy.

478
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,839
Run, Maxwell.

479
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:51,100
Come on, Jenna.

480
01:03:53,045 --> 01:03:54,808
Is he alright?

481
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,447
Is he alright, Roger?

482
01:04:05,024 --> 01:04:06,355
Out.

483
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:36,622
In all his life time, Van Gogh
only sold one painting.

484
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:41,990
Galileowas jailed...

485
01:04:42,161 --> 01:04:46,154
for saying that the earth
revolved around thesun.

486
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:52,537
I don't have to tellyouwhat
they did to Christ.

487
01:04:53,105 --> 01:04:55,869
Why Issoclety
so afrald of greatness?

488
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:59,077
Why does it turn its back
on the ones it needsthe most?

489
01:04:59,245 --> 01:05:04,376
Inthe endthese great men
are alwayssanctlfled.

490
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:06,848
But they always
have to dle flrst.

491
01:05:33,212 --> 01:05:37,114
I'veset every bomb
to go off in ten minutes.

492
01:05:37,917 --> 01:05:42,786
That'senoughto brlngthls
place down before you get out.

493
01:05:43,456 --> 01:05:47,916
It'senoughtlme for youto
declde If I get to be ahero...

494
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,357
or dowe all go out
as martyrs.

495
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,732
Go!

496
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,082
.We canstill get out.
.We'll never make it.

497
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:15,414
.Kenny, you can disarm it.
.Not in 1O mins.

498
01:06:15,588 --> 01:06:17,954
Let's just wait
for him to kill us.

499
01:06:18,124 --> 01:06:19,887
There is oneway.

500
01:06:22,328 --> 01:06:25,354
Turningyourself over
is not the answer.

501
01:06:26,465 --> 01:06:28,057
What if he just thinks I am?

502
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:35,531
What? Like a trap?

503
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,810
Like one last roll of the dice.

504
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,840
We are in Vegas.

505
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,016
Fine.

506
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,121
Let's go for it.

507
01:07:01,801 --> 01:07:03,530
Okay, how dowe do this?

508
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:07,461
Tracy?

509
01:07:09,308 --> 01:07:10,935
It's me.

510
01:07:12,745 --> 01:07:17,375
Are youwilling to take me back
as if my thoughtswere your own?

511
01:07:19,485 --> 01:07:21,077
Yes, Maxwell.

512
01:07:23,155 --> 01:07:28,149
.Then come back to me.
.Meet me in the Kings chambers.

513
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:35,258
.Yousure youwant to do this?
.Moresure than I've ever been.

514
01:07:38,704 --> 01:07:42,697
Keep his attention.
All I need is one goodshot.

515
01:07:46,212 --> 01:07:49,010
Listen to me.

516
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:51,172
Youstay right here.
Promise me.

517

Promise me you'llstay here.

518
01:08:04,396 --> 01:08:07,888
You two continue
to be a thorn in my side.

519
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,905
.What dowe have here?
.I'm Jenna.

520
01:08:23,649 --> 01:08:29,417
Jenna's apretty name.
It's good to have an extra ace.

521
01:08:31,857 --> 01:08:34,883
Tracy, you dlsappolnted me.

522
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:38,087
What are they dolngto you?

523
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:44,601

525
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:54,505
.He's gonna get you.
.Be a good girl and come along.

526
01:09:04,957 --> 01:09:07,050
There's nothing to be afraid of.

527
01:09:20,372 --> 01:09:22,340
The King's chamber, Tracy.

528
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:40,883
You bastard!

529
01:10:23,068 --> 01:10:26,560
Isn't it beautiful
when you cansee the light?

530
01:10:27,373 --> 01:10:29,432
Let her go.
I'm comingwith you.

Let's go! Let's go!

542
01:12:32,064 --> 01:12:33,588
Time to go.

01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:55,486
.Damn it!Where isshe?

547
01:13:36,462 --> 01:13:39,795
Hesaid the hotel is
going to blow.

548
01:13:40,099 --> 01:13:44,763
Not with us in it.
Let's play find the cult leader.

549
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:03,950
Come on.
Through here.

550

551
01:14:06,492 --> 01:14:12,124
.Leave it for the bombsquad.
.It's motion activated.

552
01:14:17,236 --> 01:14:18,965
Can you do this?

553
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:28,569
Dad!

554
01:14:29,181 --> 01:14:31,172
Let him go.

555
01:15:04,383 --> 01:15:06,408

Listen up, everybody.

559
01:16:50,722 --> 01:16:54,590
Today we lost one of the best
cops this city has ever known.

560
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,457
So this city isshut down until
we find the guy who did it.

561
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:02,532
Nothing moves in the air or on
the ground until Maxwell's ours.

562
01:17:03,302 --> 01:17:05,395
Let's do this, people.

A Greek warrior oncesaid...

606
01:23:27,152 --> 01:23:29,416
Sometimes from the

607
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:35,052
you can create astroke of luck.
That'swhere you come in.

618
01:27:58,756 --> 01:28:00,587
Way to go, hero.
