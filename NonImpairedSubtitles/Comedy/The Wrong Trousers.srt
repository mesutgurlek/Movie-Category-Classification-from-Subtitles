to an amicable agreement.

(Barp! Barp! Barp! Barp!)

169
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,273
Oh! Ooohh!

170
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,148
What's going on?

171
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,231
Where am I?! What's going on?!

172
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,356
YIIKE!

173
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,716
Gromit! GROM-I-IT!

174
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,229
I... I must be dreaming!

175
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,671
Where the devil am I?!

176
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,715
Oohh!

177
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,349
Oh... Oh! Great heavens above!

178
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,510
Whatever is it? HELP!

179
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,796
Get me down!

180
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,233
HELP!

181
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,151
What's the game, then, eh?
Where am I?

182
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,750
I've had quite enough!

183
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,196
You'll be hearing
from my solicitor about this!

184
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,875
Eee! Ow! Mind how you go!

185
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,114
You can't go taking liberties
like this. I'm a respectable citizen!

186
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,233
It's definitely not legal, this.

187
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,756
Good grief! It's you!

188
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,037
Now, get me out of these trousers
this minute!

189
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,076
Steady on, will you?

190
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,515
This wardrobe's nearly new.

191
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,352
Let me out!

192
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,398
I'll give you what for, you tyke!

193
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,190
(Wallace) Excuse me? Hello?

194
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,880
I should think so, too... Hey!

195
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,550
Well, this is a fine how do you do,
isn't it, Gromit?

196
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,594
Steady on!
Watch where your putting them paws!

197
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,436
- (Fizz!)
- Oh! Careful, lad! Oooh! Ohhhh!

198
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,391
Oh, my goodness,
it'll ruin the woodwork!

199
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,675
(Thud! Thud! Thud!)

200
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,274
There goes me knotted pine!
Where are we going?

201
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,433
I... I can't see a thing!

202
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,431
What's happening?!

203
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,512
(Toot! Toot!)

204
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,750
(Muffled) Catch him, Gromit!

205
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,472
(Pow!)

206
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,273
(Pow!)

207
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,634
(Pee-ow!)

208
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,039
(Toot! Toot!)

209
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,638
(Pee-ow!)

210
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,673
(Pee-ow! Pee-ow!)

211
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,478
(Wallace) Don't worry, Gromit!

212
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,996
I'm...Oooh! Right behind you!

213
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,589
Hang in there, Gromit!
Everything's under control!

214
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,639
I'll have that if you don't mind, eh?

215
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,029
Aaaahhh!

216
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,392
Ohh!

217
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,196
(Wallace) Tally ho!

218
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,997
Leave him to me.
I'll get the bounder!

219
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,833
Aaah!

220
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,276
Get him, Gromit!

221
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,511
Gromit, we're doomed!

222
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,831
Mind the table, Gromit!

223
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,028
Aah! Ooh! Aah! Ooh!

224
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,397
(Toot!)

225
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,349
(Toot!)

226
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,793
Gotcha!

227
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,958
Uh?

228
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,076
All yours, Gromit!

229
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,069
(Crash!)

230
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,432
(Ploop!)

231
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,636
Attaboy, Gromit, lad!

232
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,793
Well done! We did it! Ha ha!

233
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,996
Grrrrr!

234
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,996
Thank you, old friend.

235
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,878
Many thanks indeed.

236
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,995
That reward money
paid off all our debts.

237
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,631
No more lodgers.
More trouble than they're worth.

238
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,193
I could just fancy some cheese,
Gromit. What do you say?

239
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,236
Cheddar?

240
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,236
Don't forget the crackers.

241
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,157
(Bzz! Bzz!)

242
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,070
All's well that ends well,
that's what I say.

243
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,390
(Whirr! Clank! Whirr! Clank!)

244
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,079
Oh, I DO like a bit of Gorgonzola.
