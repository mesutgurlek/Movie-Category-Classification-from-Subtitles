1
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,660
Mom and me versus you and Dad.

2
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,700
-Long.
-That looked pretty good.

3
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,820
-lt was out.
-lt did look good.

4
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,620
-Frank, it was out.
-It's my call. Out.

5
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,660
If you can, try and hit it
at your mother's backhand.

6
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,820
-It's pretty weak.
-Got it.

7
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,900
-Yes!.
-Don't gloat, Walt.

8
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,420
Five games to three, us.

9
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,740
-Fuck! Come on, Bernard.
-Bernard, don't curse.

10
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,900
I'm cursing at myself.

11
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,340
-Nice shot.
-Thanks.

12
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,580
-Walt, watch out.
-It's part of the game.

13
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,460
Fifteen-love.

14
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,220
Joan, I'm sorry. It was an accident.

15
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,740
You gotta get a second serve.

16
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,020
Frank.

17
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,500
Did you just put that peanut
up your nose?

18
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,340
Cashew. Yes.

19
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,180
Pickle, that is such
an idiotic, stupid thing to do.

20
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,180
No, it's out. I got it.

21
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,580
We're reading A Tale of Two Cities
in English. Is that any good?

22
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,020
It's minor Dickens.
Popular in schools.

23
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,860
But I think David Copperfield
or Great Expectations is much richer.

24
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,180
What is it about high school
that you read...

25
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,140
...all the worst books
by good writers?

26
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,980
You should read it
and see what you think of it.

27
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,660
I don't wanna waste my time.

28
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,820
What are you doing?

29
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,260
Just fixing up the couch.

30
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,020
-Did you sleep there?
-Yeah, our bed is hurting my back.

31
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,020
Isn't the couch worse
than the bed? For backs?

32
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,460
No. This is better.

33
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,340
When does Mom's story
come out in the magazine?

34
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,660
It's not a magazine.
It's a literary journal.

35
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,540
Next month, I think.

36
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,100
It'll be weird having
two writers as parents.

37
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,740
Yeah, well, Dad influenced her.
She never wrote before she met him.

38
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,900
I haven't read any of Dad's books.

39
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,260
I've looked at them. They're great.
Very dense.

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,900
He needs a new agent.
It's been too long.

41
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,900
The publishing world isn't receptive
always to real literary talent.

42
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,860
Maybe Mom will be famous instead.

43
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,860
-No, Dad's the writer.
-Maybe Mom's better.

44
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,100
That's way off base, Frank.
That's way off base.

45
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,500
Ivan hit with Arthur Ashe once.

46
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,140
Wasn't he ranked, like,
402 or something?

47
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,860
Ivan could've been a champ
if he hadn't hurt his knee.

48
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,100
Okay, my brother, let's see
some groundstrokes.

49
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,260
You gotta ease up, my brother.

50
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,540
Jimmy Connors hits
as hard as he can...

51
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,020
...but we can't all get away
with that, right?

52
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,340
All right, let's see the backhand.

53
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,660
Two hands. Two hands.
Hey, my brother.

54
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,700
Who taught you
these junkyard strokes?

55
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,180
My Dad. He's self-taught.

56
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,340
I heard that. Hey, Bernard.

57
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,300
You teaching my brother here
these junkyard chip shots?

58
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,940
A one-handed backhand
is an elegant stroke.

59
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,100
My brother here doesn't want
a weak chip shot for a backhand.

60
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,660
-I don't care.
-It's McEnroe's stroke.

61
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,740
He's the master of the chip game.

62
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,340
-All right, fellas, that's it for today.
-lvan, you wanna hit a little?

63
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,900
I got a few minutes.

64
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,420
Frank, you and Carl hang out.
Give me your racquet.

65
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,740
-Are you interested in any arts?
-I wouldn't mind being a pro.

66
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,180
It's very hard to be
a professional player.

67
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,660
As good as even lvan is, he's not in
a league with McEnroe or Connors.

68
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,060
Oh, I don't mean a pro like that.

69
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,540
I mean, like a pro
at the bubble. Like lvan.

70
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,780
You don't wanna be a pro.

71
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,700
I'm sure I've lost my parking space.
We're gonna have to drive around.

72
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,180
-Can you drop me off?
-No.

73
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,740
I picked you up, the least you can do
is ride around with me.

74
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,860
Terrific, honeys.

75
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,060
-Walt, did you write that song?
-Yes.

76
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,900
-Frank had some good ideas too.
-Very dense. Very interesting.

77
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,940
Yeah. I signed up for the talent thing
they have at school.

78
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,940
Great. Just make sure
you practice a lot.

79
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,300
Mom, I'll be fine.

80
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,740
Remember, you'll be
in front of a lot of people.

81
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,380
-Don't ruin the whole thing for me.
-You'll win.

82
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,620
If you don't,
something's wrong with them.

83
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,300
Which is probably the case, actually.
People can be very stupid.

84
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,220
I'll get it.

85
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,420
Walt, you wanna come to my class
tomorrow after school?

86
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,660
-Yeah.
-Could I come?

87
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,300
You have tennis. You're gonna be
doing that, which is its own thing.

88
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,420
-Look how young Dad looks.
-That's funny. Dad, can I have this?

89
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,220
-Okay.
-Would you write something in it?

90
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,300
Thanks.

91
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,580
"l absorb sex indiscriminately,
numb and impartial.

92
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,260
I suck men of their interiors.

93
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,540
A fuck that unites John, Dan,
Scott, whomever...

94
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,460
...in the popular lust
and paternal hunt for my possession.

95
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,300
He was a large man,
though his arms were thin.

96
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,900
The upper part soft, but not fleshy.
Like a young woman's.

97
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,020
He had long, delicate fingers and
plump palms similar to a raccoon's.

98
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,380
With finesse, he plied the meat
from a crab claw...

99
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,540
...and sucked oysters
from their shells."

100
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,180
She's a very risky writer, Lili.
Very racy.

101
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,780
I mean, exhibiting her cunt
in that fashion is very racy.

102
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,500
Lili has her influences in postmodern
literature, a bit derivative of Kafka.

103
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,860
But for a student, very racy.

104
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,180
-Did you get that it was her cunt?
-Oh, yeah.

105
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,260
-Did you like it?
-Yeah. A lot.

106
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,220
You'd like Kafka,
one of my predecessors.

107
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,980
-Particularly The Metamorphosis.
-Metamorphosis?

108
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,260
No fucking spaces.

109
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,900
-I'll keep you company while we look.
-Thank you.

110
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,620
Dad, what were your wives like
before Mom?

111
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,260
"Wife," really.
The first one was annulled.

112
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,780
-I was 1 9.
-What was she like?

113
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,220
-The annulled one?
-No, the one you'd call a wife.

114
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,220
Difficult.

115
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,100
That's Mom.

116
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,180
Yeah, that's Mom.

117
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,260
What was she wearing?

118
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,900
No, I guess I've seen that before.

119
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,580
What are you writing?

120
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,180
I'm working on the Peugeot story.

121
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,180
Did you take my note
about the ending?

122
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,180
-Some of it.
-Does he still die?

123
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,820
-Yeah.
-Then you didn't take my note.

124
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,100
Boys, make sure you come home
right after school.

125
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,300
-Why?
-We're having a family conference.

126
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,500
-What's that?
-A talk. Just come home.

127
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,620
-What about?
-We'll go over it tonight.

128
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,340
-Can't you give us a hint?
-No, just-- Tonight.

129
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,500
We'll go-- Everything--
We'll go over it tonight.

130
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,020
Just waiting for your mother.

131
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,060
-Mom.
-Sorry.

132
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,700
-Okay.
-Okay. All set?

133
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,260
Yes.

134
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,940
Okay.

135
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,020
Your mom and l....

136
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,580
Okay, yeah. Mom and I are going....

137
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,780
We're going to separate.

138
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,220
You're not gonna be
leaving either of us.

139
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,260
We're gonna have joint custody.
Frank, it's okay.

140
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,620
I've got an elegant new house
across the park.

141
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,180
Across the park?

142
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,620
-ls that even Brooklyn?
-It's only five stops on the subway.

143
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,540
It's an elegant block.
The fillet of the neighborhood.

144
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,340
-We'll have a Ping-Pong table.
-I don't play Ping-Pong.

145
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,460
-We'll both see you equally.
-How?

146
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,420
-We're splitting up the week.
-Why?

147
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,260
I love you. I wanna see you
as much as your mom does.

148
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,100
-But there's seven days.
-Right.

149
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
How will you split evenly
with seven days?

150
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,820
I've got you Tuesday, Wednesday and
Saturday and every other Thursday.

151
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,820
-Every other?
-That's how we each have you equally.

152
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,780
That was your father's idea.

153
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,340
-Don't do this.
-How will we get to school?

154
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,820
There's a subway four blocks
from the house.

155
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,980
Four or five.
No more than six blocks.

156
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,620
And what about the cat?

157
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,300
-Shit, the cat.
-We didn't discuss the cat.

158
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,380
Your father will pick him up on those
days when you switch houses.

159
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,540
I'll drive here
two more times a week?

160
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,940
You got a place on
the other side of the park.

161
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,980
If it was near here,
it wouldn't be a problem.

162
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,620
This neighborhood
got expensive. It's painful...

163
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,460
...for me to stay in this neighborhood.
Don't be difficult. I feel banished.

164
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,620
Oh, Pickle.

165
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,140
-Dad, what will happen with the cat?
-We'll figure something out.

166
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,380
Is it because Dad isn't
as successful as he used to be?

167
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,260
Now that you're publishing
and he isn't, is that it?

168
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,740
-That's not nice to say.
-This is a great family.

169
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,380
Why are you screwing it up?

170
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,900
-lf we could avoid it, I would.
-Why now?

171
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,580
-You've been together 1 6 years.
-Seventeen.

172
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,100
I can't imagine living like this.

173
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,660
Don't most of your friends
already have divorced parents?

174
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,100
Yeah, but I don't.

175
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,460
Well, now you do.

176
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,700
-I think you're doing a foolish thing.
-I understand how unhappy you are.

177
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,220
I'm unhappy too.
And I don't want you or Frank...

178
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,580
...to blame yourself for any of this.

179
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,380
It has nothing to do with you.

180
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,580
It's okay. Go back to sleep.

181
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,300
-Are those your books?
-Yes. These are my books.

182
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,300
Why are they going under my bed?

183
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,140
Because I bought them,
and I don't wanna lose them.

184
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,380
We'll put them back on the shelf
when your father leaves.

185
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,460
Until things are certain, we shouldn't
say anything to anyone yet.

186
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,180
-Why?
-Because we never know.

187
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,660
And I don't want people
to know our business.

188
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,140
I told Carl.

189
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,820
-Already?
-I called him last night.

190
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,580
I also told Matt and Dale.

191
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,460
And Dale? Shit, now everyone
will know. Jesus, Frank.

192
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,500
-Mom says we should tell people.
-Mom doesn't go to school.

193
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,340
Stop crying.

194
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,940
-Joint custody blows.
-I was told it's better.

195
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,780
It's miserable. My parents didn't
wanna uproot me and Rebecca.

196
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,980
So we stayed in the house.
They took separate apartments...

197
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,980
...and switched off coming to us.
Then my mom met Dexter.

198
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,220
My dad freaked out.

199
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,140
And then they sold the house,
and I go back and forth anyway.

200
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,980
God, joint custody blows.

201
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,780
Thanks. Yeah, I forgot to take these.
She has a few of my books still.

202
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,180
She wrote her maiden name in them
when she knew we were splitting.

203
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,620
But these were mine.

204
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,660
-Are you and Walt stealing from Mom?
-These were mine, Frank.

205
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,460
Watch it! Jesus!

206
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,820
Hey, brother. Walt.

207
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,380
Bernard, Joan says
you have a check for me.

208
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,020
She said that? No, tennis is hers.

209
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,820
Our separation agreement says
she handles tennis and winter coats.

210
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,380
-I do sneakers and camp.
-Okay. I'll take it up with her.

211
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,260
Walt.

212
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,740
Ivan's a bit of a half-wit, isn't he?

213
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,500
It was important to me
to have a place like your mother's.

214
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,180
I'm gonna cook and run the household
like you're used to.

215
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,980
-This is nothing like our house.
-You mean, your mother's house.

216
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,980
-What?
-This isn't like your mother's house.

217
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,300
-That's what I said.
-You said, "Our house."

218
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,980
That's your mother's house.
This is your house too.

219
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,620
-No, this is your house.
-It's our house.

220
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,980
I hate Nastase. You know that. Ivan met
Nastase and said he was an asshole.

221
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,740
-Well, I couldn't find Vitas Gerulaitis.
-I have a Vitas poster at home.

222
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,740
At Mom's. And all my turtles.

223
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,500
We can get some turtles.
I know you like amphibians.

224
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,300
Turtles are reptiles.

225
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,300
Here's a desk for you
to do your homework.

226
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,340
Dad, this is for a lefty.

227
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,980
Dad got me a lefty desk.

228
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,700
Don't be difficult.
We need to be supportive of Dad.

229
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,540
-I hate it here.
-Don't be a chick.

230
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,900
-You can get a righty desk later.
-Why do I want a desk at home?

231
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,980
I don't want a chalkboard or a bell
going off every 45 minutes either.

232
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,260
-He likes being with us.
-He likes having us in the house.

233
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,300
You got books. I didn't get books.

234
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,860
Because these are the books
Dad knows I like.

235
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,340
-I wanna go back to Mom's.
-Why? She caused this, chick.

236
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,140
-I'm not "chick."
-Yes, you are.

237
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,340
-Chick, this is Mom's doing.
-Stop calling me chick!

238
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,020
Mom told us they'd never get divorced.
So Mom's a liar.

239
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,700
Fuck! That hurt!

240
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,180
I'm not being a chick,
you fucking ass man.

241
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,620
You're hurting me, really hurting me.

242
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,420
One turtle would've
made a difference.

243
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,220
You live in Park Slope, right?

244
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,500
My mom does. And I do sometimes.

245
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,220
I live on the other side of the park
half the time.

246
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,420
-Prospect Heights?
-I'm not sure.

247
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,020
The street's Stratford Road.
My dad's moving there.

248
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,780
I hear it's the fillet
of the neighborhood.

249
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,700
-You like Franz Kafka?
-I don't know him.

250
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,380
He's great. The Metamorphosis
is a masterpiece.

251
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,500
-Sounds good.
-Yeah, it is.

252
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,340
-Have you read This Side of Paradise?
-No, but it's minor Fitzgerald.

253
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,340
-ls it? I loved it.
-It's a minor work.

254
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,780
Gatsby is his masterpiece.
And Tender is the Night is dazzling.

255
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,580
Last Tycoon, had he finished it....

256
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,140
I hope you like it. Your notes
were awesome, Bernard.

257
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,100
I loved your idea for the change
in tense at the end.

258
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,140
It could be the coup of the story.

259
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,940
I reread A Hunger Artist on your
suggestion and stole a couple things.

260
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,300
-See if you can spot them.
-Good story to steal from.

261
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,020
-Fuck!
-Frank.

262
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,660
Sorry.

263
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,020
How long were you and Mom
not getting along?

264
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,020
A couple of years.
I thought we would work it out.

265
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,260
I wanted to. I tried.
As you know, I tried very hard.

266
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,660
-Your mother wasn't interested in that.
-Why not?

267
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,700
-I think it has very little to do with me.
-Shit! Fucker!

268
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,820
-Frank!
-She could never make up her mind.

269
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,540
She'd pull away and then get angry
at me for not being more aggressive.

270
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,460
Her affair with Richard
made it difficult for me...

271
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,340
...to save the marriage.
It became a fait accompli.

272
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,020
-Affair?
-With Richard.

273
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,900
-Who's Richard?
-A man from the neighborhood.

274
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,540
I think she met him at one of Frank's
Little League games. A shrink.

275
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,300
Seems sort of like an ordinary guy.
Not an intellectual.

276
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,220
-How long was she having the affair?
-About four years.

277
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,220
-You're kidding.
-No. I thought you knew this.

278
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,220
No. No.

279
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,740
Fuck that cock shit!

280
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,500
Frank, you gotta relax, my brother.

281
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,060
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, honeys.

282
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,220
-What are you doing?
-Just changing things around a bit.

283
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,980
I've come by to tell you
I'm not staying here anymore.

284
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,660
-Why?
-You know why.

285
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,580
-I don't.
-Frank, do you know why?

286
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,420
-No.
-Why don't you tell me?

287
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,500
Because you cheated on Dad.

288
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,700
How did you hear that?

289
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,620
-Your father told you.
-Yeah, he told me.

290
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,780
Why did you, Mom?

291
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,060
I was having a hard time.

292
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,580
Where were we during this?
Did you bring men home?

293
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,740
Not while-- Not....

294
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,940
Not when your father was in town.

295
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,260
You actually met Richard,
both you boys.

296
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,140
He came over for takeout once.

297
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,420
You talked about the Stones.

298
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,900
Oh, God. Under our noses.
Like a brothel. Men coming in and out.

299
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,460
-Shut up.
-lf you want me to explain, I will.

300
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,980
-I don't wanna hear it.
-I do.

301
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,940
Walt doesn't,
so I won't say anything.

302
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,580
-Walt can leave.
-You disgust me.

303
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,260
You weren't even a writer
until recently.

304
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,980
You bailed on Dad because he's not
successful and hasn't got recognition.

305
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,940
-You sound like your father.
-I'm glad. You disgust me.

306
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,780
You're being a shit, Walt.

307
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,740
-I'm taking the cat.
-You can't have him. It's his night here.

308
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,100
Okay, you can kiss me now.

309
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,700
No, the moment's ruined.

310
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,620
-I'll go sneak up and surprise Chrissy.
-It's not her birthday.

311
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,220
She also had an affair
with some therapist.

312
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,140
-I don't wanna know.
-And Otto's father, Don.

313
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,300
-Otto's father?
-Yeah, but it's over.

314
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,540
She said the affairs
have been miserable for her.

315
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,580
She's dating now,
but nothing serious.

316
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,540
She's crazy. She should keep
her affairs to herself.

317
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,260
-I'm not going back.
-You have to, joint custody.

318
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,340
Fuck joint custody.

319
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,140
-ls Mom letting you drink soda?
-Beer.

320
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,980
-Since when do you drink beer?
-Since recently.

321
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,260
You think Don and she did it?

322
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,660
-I don't wanna think about it.
-lmagine Don's dick in Mom's mouth.

323
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,900
-Who are you? Stop it.
-Do you think they do that?

324
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,740
-You think she gets anal sex from Don?
-Stop, okay.

325
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,860
It's disgusting.

326
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,220
Don't.

327
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,220
-We have the same bone structure.
-No.

328
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,260
You have your dad's features.

329
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,540
Really?

330
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,220
-Fuck it.
-Frank.

331
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,860
-I thought I had your bone structure.
-No.

332
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,340
You're ugly.

333
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,060
Pickle, why would you say that?

334
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,860
Because I think it's true.
I think Carl thinks you're ugly.

335
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,980
I'm not though, sweetie.

336
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,780
-I found out something last night.
-What's that?

337
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,500
That your dad was fucking my mom.

338
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,460
-What?
-You heard me.

339
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,260
Supposedly going on for a year
or so about two years ago.

340
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,180
-I'm so horrified by this.
-Thanks.

341
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,620
No, I don't mean by your mom.
She's very attractive.

342
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,460
It was just an affair. A fuck.
We're not gonna be brothers.

343
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,020
She said your dad's
pretty fucked up with women.

344
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,020
Why'd she sleep with him then?

345
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,900
I don't know.

346
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,260
Because she's an asshole.

347
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,220
I read The Metamorphosis.
You were right, it's great.

348
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:24,420
Yeah. So bizarre. What do you think is
happening at the end, with the sister?

349
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,700
Yeah, I think she's....

350
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,700
-I mean, it's ambiguous, really.
-Yeah.

351
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,060
I mean, it's gross
when he turns into a bug...

352
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,460
...but I love how matter-of-fact
everything is.

353
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,140
Yeah, it's very Kafkaesque.

354
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,300
-Because it's written by Franz Kafka.
-Right.

355
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,060
-No, I mean, clearly.
-lt would have to be.

356
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,340
You're shoving
the whole tongue in me.

357
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,220
No, it's okay. Just do it a little--
Like, little licks.

358
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,460
-Like this?
-Yeah.

359
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,660
I wish you didn't have
so many freckles on your face.

360
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,180
Not really, though.

361
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,780
I'm feeling kind of feverish.

362
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,500
-Do we have any Tylenol?
-I don't know.

363
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,540
-I didn't see any.
-Then there isn't any.

364
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,020
Can we get some?

365
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,300
-ls this enough?
-Get a small one.

366
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,980
Three fifty-seven.

367
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,020
-I don't have enough money.
-Okay.

368
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,180
-I got it.
-You have any change?

369
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,740
Wanna play Ping-Pong?

370
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,740
-I'm gonna lie down.
-One game.

371
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,260
-Fucking shit.
-Nineteen-7.

372
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,500
Have you given more thought
to what you're interested in?

373
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,180
Come on.

374
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,740
You have to try.
It's no fun for me if you don't try.

375
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,260
-I wanna be a tennis pro like lvan.
-You don't wanna be a tennis pro.

376
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,620
-Why not?
-It's not serious.

377
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,140
I mean, McEnroe.
Borg is an artist. It's like dance.

378
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,820
Connors has a brilliance.
But at lvan's level....

379
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,220
Ivan is fine,
but he's not a serious guy.

380
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,820
-He's a philistine.
-What's a philistine?

381
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,900
It's a guy who doesn't care about
books or interesting films and things.

382
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,380
Your mother's brother Ned
is also a philistine.

383
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,460
-Then I'm a philistine.
-No.

384
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,540
You're interested in books and things.
Liked The Wild Child when we saw it.

385
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,940
Lots of people liked that movie.

386
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,260
No, I'm a philistine.

387
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,620
When am I going to meet
the famous Sophie?

388
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,100
I don't know. She's not gorgeous,
but she's cute.

389
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,620
You have plenty of time
to sleep with gorgeous women.

390
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,140
Goddamn it!

391
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,140
They fell on the floor.

392
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,180
When my first novel came out,
I had a lot of opportunities.

393
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,580
I was with your mother,
so I didn't partake.

394
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,460
I've never had an affair with a student,
though many have come on to me.

395
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,700
That's why you might not wanna be
attached at your age.

396
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,820
It sounds like Sophie's good for now.

397
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,260
-Why'd you yell, "Goddamn it"?
-I burned myself.

398
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,540
The cutlets are great.
Dad, did you hear from that agent?

399
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,980
-Not yet.
-But if he likes your novel...

400
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,180
-...then you get it published.
-Basically.

401
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,300
What happened
to your old agent, Fred?

402
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,980
He pissed me off.

403
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,700
Made a disparaging remark
about the Knicks at a party.

404
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,700
Said they played like thugs.
I found it offensive.

405
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,700
He's kind of a jerk.

406
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,380
It was important
to your mother that I achieve...

407
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,820
...some sort of commercial success.

408
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,940
And when I didn't meet
her expectations in that area....

409
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,980
You're going to witness
a Greenberg family tradition.

410
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,540
Friday night Chinese at Hunan Palace.
I hope you're prepared.

411
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,180
-Hey.
-Hey.

412
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,260
Why'd you let go of my hand?

413
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,380
-What?
-When we passed Wendy, you let go.

414
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,540
I didn't realize.

415
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,220
Walt, anything you'd like to order?

416
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,860
I'm happy to have the same amount
of dishes as people.

417
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,260
It's always one dish
less the number of people.

418
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,460
That's our family tradition,
not ordering enough food.

419
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,860
-That's funny. Oh, he's funny, Sophie.
-I know.

420
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,980
-You're early.
-Hi, Joan.

421
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,500
-Don't feed him the generic stuff.
-What?

422
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,900
Frank says you're feeding
the cat generic food.

423
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,540
Get Purina, it's what he likes.

424
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,940
-It's the same damn thing.
-It's not, but--

425
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,220
He's my cat too.

426
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,420
Remember when he got stuck in a wall
in New Hampshire and I rescued him?

427
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,740
-I know how to handle him.
-lt was a radiator.

428
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,460
-What?
-He got stuck in a radiator.

429
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,940
You trimmed your beard.

430
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,700
Yeah, it was starting
to get a little feral.

431
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,140
-You look well.
-Yeah?

432
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,180
-Thanks.
-Things are good here.

433
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,380
Teaching is going well.

434
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,420
And I'm playing the best tennis
of my life.

435
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,020
Maybe that's an illusion...

436
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,900
...but it feels that way.

437
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,020
That's good.

438
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,100
I was thinking we should sit together
at WaIt's performance next month.

439
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,980
-Okay.
-lt'd be nice for him...

440
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,100
...if we're both there together.

441
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,980
Maybe we could all
go out afterwards.

442
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,140
I don't know. Maybe.

443
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,060
Okay, maybe.

444
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,660
I think he's getting good at guitar.

445
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,180
I know.

446
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,660
The stuff he's writing
is really wonderful.

447
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,020
-Have you met his girlfriend?
-No. He talks about her...

448
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,340
-...with me, though.
-Good.

449
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,460
I'd appreciate it if you didn't...

450
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,420
...tell him about things like Richard.

451
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,340
My father told me you called him.

452
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,260
I did, yeah.

453
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,820
He said you....

454
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,420
-He said you were upset.
-Yeah.

455
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,900
I wanted to....

456
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,220
I like him.

457
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,220
You know that.

458
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,100
I just wanted to say--
I don't know.

459
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,020
I just wanted to say hello.

460
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,860
He called me right after. He said:

461
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,700
"Bernie, I think you can save
your marriage."

462
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,140
I told him...

463
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,260
...I didn't think there was anything else
I could do.

464
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,860
I did try everything.

465
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,620
Bye, Bernard.

466
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,260
Bernard?

467
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,540
I was wondering if you knew
of any apartments.

468
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,540
I'm being kicked out of my sublet.

469
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,740
Unless l, I don't know,
blow the super, I'm out on my ass.

470
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,260
Oh, I don't. No.

471
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,700
I guess you don't know either, huh?

472
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,260
No.

473
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,420
I have an extra room in my house.
You could stay till you find something.

474
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,020
You wouldn't have to blow
your super.

475
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,380
I guess....

476
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,300
-I'd hate to put you out.
-No, no.

477
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,100
-Or your kids.
-No. No.

478
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,100
The Mother and the Whore.

479
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,020
-Looks like a cool movie.
-A classic.

480
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,700
-I had it in my room.
-Bathroom is across the hall.

481
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,260
You'll share with the kids.
They can use mine.

482
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,860
I don't care. As long as Walt
remembers to put the seat down.

483
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,740
Thank you, Bernard.
Thank you, Walt.

484
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,220
-Joan says you don't like your sheets.
-They're fine.

485
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,580
And you disapprove of the food
I feed the cat.

486
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,180
You should tell me these things,
not her.

487
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,580
-Fuck!
-Fifteen.

488
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,700
Fifteen-20.

489
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,580
-Motherfucker!
-My serve.

490
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,380
-I wasn't ready.
-Yes, you were.

491
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,860
Frank, I was not ready.

492
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:49,380
This is Mother Hubbard. There is
nothing to eat or drink. No soda.

493
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,220
-We're not allowed soda.
-Goddamn it!

494
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,220
I guess there's two kinds of parents:

495
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,260
Those who allow soda and sugar
cereal, and those who don't.

496
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,420
We're not supposed to use paper towels
to wipe our hands. Cloth is for that.

497
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,900
You're cute.

498
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,900
Thanks.

499
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,300
I don't believe this shit.

500
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,740
-Shit!
-Good game.

501
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,020
It's hard to beat your father.

502
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,460
Hey!

503
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,900
-Watch it!
-Suck my dick, ass man.

504
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,340
-Where you going?
-The movies.

505
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,940
And then to a party with Sophie.

506
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,060
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

507
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,540
Frank won't leave his room.
He's being difficult.

508
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,620
You wanna come to the movie?

509
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,540
Okay.

510
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,180
Not the party, but the movie.

511
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,540
So we were thinking Short Circuit.

512
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,780
Blue Velvet is supposed
to be quite interesting.

513
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,220
I love you! Love me!

514
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,660
He put his disease in me.

515
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,300
Tell me it's all right.
I opened myself to you.

516
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,020
No.

517
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,980
Stop, Frank.

518
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,460
No.

519
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,140
A student of mine writes
very racy short stories you might like.

520
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,540
She has one that chronicles
her vagina.

521
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,740
-Dad.
-That sounds interesting.

522
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,700
Very feminist, but very interesting.

523
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,540
Frank, I'm back.

524
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,180
Frank?

525
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,860
Frank?

526
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,180
-What were you doing?
-I was going to Mom's.

527
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,980
You don't do that on my night.
Ever. You hear me?

528
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,740
-Yes.
-I'm your father.

529
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,420
You listen to what I say.

530
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,020
-But you were out.
-It's still my night, damn it.

531
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,260
Okay, okay.

532
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,660
Shit! Someone's taken my space.

533
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,860
-Goddamn it. Son of a bitch.
-Sorry.

534
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,300
Frank!

535
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,340
Hello?

536
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,300
Hello?

537
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,620
Frank, what are you doing here?
It's not your night with me.

538
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,500
-I don't wanna look like Dad.
-Looks aren't everything.

539
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,500
It's not your night with me, sweetie.

540
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,140
-Did you have a party?
-I celebrated.

541
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,180
Knopf is publishing my novel.
Pickle, you should be at your dad's.

542
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,820
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

543
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,420
I need some nights
without you guys sometimes.

544
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,900
What's up, brother?

545
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,020
Nothing.

546
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,340
Hello?

547
00:39:19,764 --> 00:39:24,064
He just took off and went to your
mother's. It's my night, he knows that.

548
00:39:24,302 --> 00:39:26,736
You think we could ease up
on whose night is whose?

549
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:30,099
I wanna see you guys. I love you.

550
00:39:30,808 --> 00:39:32,332
Did you like Sophie?

551
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:36,139
Yeah. I think she's fine.
Is she a Knicks fan?

552
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:37,939
I don't know.

553
00:39:38,616 --> 00:39:41,141
-You think she's pretty?
-Sure, yeah.

554
00:39:41,352 --> 00:39:44,116
But she's not the type I go for.

555
00:39:44,322 --> 00:39:47,553
You just have to decide
if you wanna be attached.

556
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:50,250
It's good to play the field
at your age.

557
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:53,226
Lili is pretty.

558
00:39:54,532 --> 00:39:57,660
Would you go ring the bell?
I hate walking up those steps.

559
00:39:57,902 --> 00:40:01,463
It's very uncomfortable for me.
Very painful.

560
00:40:02,006 --> 00:40:04,338
I used to live in this house.

561
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,334
As you know.

562
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:16,113
Your dad and Walt are here. They're
gonna take you back to Bernard's.

563
00:40:16,321 --> 00:40:18,619
-I'll be right out.
-I'm sorry about--

564
00:40:18,823 --> 00:40:22,350
I'm sorry about
your seeing lvan like this.

565
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,586
I would've liked to have told you
before you saw him.

566
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,111
Your mother.

567
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:53,890
I wanted to talk about lvan
so you don't hear it from anyone else.

568
00:40:54,158 --> 00:40:56,217
Frank may have
already said something.

569
00:40:56,427 --> 00:40:58,122
Yeah, he did.

570
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:00,024
I've been seeing him a short time.

571
00:41:00,265 --> 00:41:02,233
But I like him.

572
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,400
And I thought you guys
should know that.

573
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:08,800
-And do you have any questions?
-No.

574
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:11,866
There was something else
I was gonna say.

575
00:41:12,143 --> 00:41:14,577
I ran into Celia, Lance's mother,
on the street...

576
00:41:14,846 --> 00:41:18,179
...and she was telling me
how wonderful she thinks you are.

577
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:21,408
How polite and funny and....

578
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,519
She said you did something
with the salt and pepper shakers.

579
00:41:25,757 --> 00:41:28,749
-A little play or something?
-Yeah. It was kind of stupid.

580
00:41:28,993 --> 00:41:33,862
I said, "l already know all those things
about him. But it's nice to hear it."

581
00:41:34,632 --> 00:41:36,600
I remember what else
I was gonna say.

582
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:38,835
I wanted to know
if you'd be interested...

583
00:41:39,103 --> 00:41:42,129
...in coming to dinner Saturday.
I'm having the Dicksteins over--

584
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:45,399
No. I'm going to a party on Saturday.
I'm sleeping at Jeffrey's.

585
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,236
-That's okay.
-I'm gonna go to bed.

586
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,381
Okay. Good night, Chicken.

587
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,617
Night.

588
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:16,003
-You think she likes you?
-I get a feeling, yeah.

589
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,970
-What about Sophie?
-lf I can lose it to Lili, I'll do it.

590
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,734
I mean, I bet she's great in bed.

591
00:42:20,978 --> 00:42:23,606
She can probably move
her pussy muscles the right way...

592
00:42:23,848 --> 00:42:26,976
-...so you blow your load in seconds.
-Yeah. It'd be pretty great.

593
00:42:27,185 --> 00:42:30,621
Maybe do them both. Why not?

594
00:42:31,456 --> 00:42:33,117
Hey, brother.

595
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:35,520
How's the grip?

596
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:38,594
-Do you think you and I are philistines?
-Frank.

597
00:42:38,996 --> 00:42:41,396
What's a philistine?

598
00:42:41,632 --> 00:42:45,591
Someone who doesn't like books
or interesting movies or things.

599
00:42:48,773 --> 00:42:51,833
-You're still here. It's my night.
-I know.

600
00:42:52,076 --> 00:42:54,442
I just thought I'd watch him hit.

601
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:02,414
You married?

602
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,344
No.

603
00:43:05,056 --> 00:43:07,854
The whole thing's very complicated.

604
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,355
Mom's dating lvan.

605
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:16,063
Really?

606
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:19,495
-lvan, back there lvan?
-Yeah.

607
00:43:20,705 --> 00:43:22,502
Are you sure?

608
00:43:22,774 --> 00:43:24,901
Why didn't you say something?

609
00:43:28,913 --> 00:43:31,973
Why is your mother
dating all these jocks?

610
00:43:32,216 --> 00:43:36,209
-Very uninteresting men.
-lvan is very interesting.

611
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:39,752
Ivan's not a serious possibility
for your mother.

612
00:43:40,024 --> 00:43:42,049
I think he is.

613
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,760
I don't wanna badmouth lvan.

614
00:43:46,297 --> 00:43:48,731
But I don't know
what Joan is thinking.

615
00:43:50,635 --> 00:43:52,159
-I think lvan--
-Frank.

616
00:43:52,837 --> 00:43:56,102
-Sorry. Is that too hard?
-Yeah, a bit. A bit.

617
00:43:56,307 --> 00:43:58,002
Okay.

618
00:43:59,076 --> 00:44:00,839
Is that better?

619
00:44:02,413 --> 00:44:03,744
Yeah.

620
00:44:05,817 --> 00:44:08,251
Yeah. That's good. That's--

621
00:44:14,992 --> 00:44:16,516
I guess....

622
00:44:17,428 --> 00:44:19,487
I don't know what....

623
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:23,458
-Why that happened.
-Oh, it's okay. Yeah.

624
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:26,431
-It's okay.
-Okay.

625
00:44:37,281 --> 00:44:40,045
-Shit. Sorry.
-Don't be sorry.

626
00:44:40,284 --> 00:44:42,775
I don't know why I didn't last.
I usually go longer.

627
00:44:42,987 --> 00:44:46,582
It's okay. I guess
I can take it as a compliment.

628
00:44:49,894 --> 00:44:52,590
Did you take your shirt off
for Nelson Barton?

629
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:55,355
-I don't wanna talk about it, Walt.
-It's important.

630
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,535
-Why is it important?
-I need to know what happened.

631
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:02,296
Well, he felt me up,
and I touched him.

632
00:45:02,707 --> 00:45:04,334
-Down his pants?
-Walt, yeah.

633
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,307
I just....

634
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:09,843
From what I could tell,
not an intellectual.

635
00:45:10,114 --> 00:45:12,082
I'm a virgin.

636
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,642
So am l.

637
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:20,518
-When's your next book coming out?
-Soon, I hope. Soon.

638
00:45:20,725 --> 00:45:24,525
-Who's publishing it?
-Well, I'm looking for a new agent first.

639
00:45:24,762 --> 00:45:27,162
A friend of mine's an agent
with Binky Urban.

640
00:45:27,398 --> 00:45:31,391
-lf you like, I'll show it to him.
-Oh, that'd be great.

641
00:45:36,374 --> 00:45:37,341
Hello?

642
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:41,976
-Could I stay the night at Sophie's?
-Thanks for doing that.

643
00:45:42,213 --> 00:45:44,204
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

644
00:45:44,448 --> 00:45:46,348
Or Tuesday. I'll see you Tuesday.

645
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:50,350
-You don't need me home for anything?
-No. Everything's fine.

646
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:56,421
If you're interested,
Walt and I are taking a road trip...

647
00:45:56,661 --> 00:45:59,129
...to SUNY Binghamton
in a couple of weekends.

648
00:45:59,363 --> 00:46:03,424
I'm giving a reading. And an
ex-student of mine, now friend...

649
00:46:03,734 --> 00:46:06,202
...Jeb Gelber, is feting me
with a dinner.

650
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,869
Excellent.

651
00:46:08,105 --> 00:46:11,802
You should read the cathedral scene
from Underwater.

652
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,279
I've done that one a lot.
I thought I'd do something new.

653
00:46:15,546 --> 00:46:18,743
But okay, well, maybe.

654
00:46:27,758 --> 00:46:30,420
Sorry, my nose is running.

655
00:46:30,728 --> 00:46:32,525
I'm your teacher.

656
00:46:33,097 --> 00:46:36,089
I've wondered for a long time
what it'd be like to fuck you.

657
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:38,358
I think we should wait.

658
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:43,472
Really?

659
00:46:43,908 --> 00:46:46,638
Yeah. Yeah, let's wait.

660
00:47:18,743 --> 00:47:21,303
Okay, up next, Walt Berkman...

661
00:47:21,545 --> 00:47:24,275
...who is going to play us a song.

662
00:47:29,387 --> 00:47:30,718
Thank you.

663
00:47:30,921 --> 00:47:35,984
I'm going to play lead guitar
and do vocals on a song I wrote.

664
00:48:12,463 --> 00:48:14,363
-That song was so good!
-Thank you.

665
00:48:14,598 --> 00:48:16,793
Oh, Dad, you remember Sophie.

666
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:18,865
-And Lili.
-Hi.

667
00:48:19,136 --> 00:48:22,196
-How much did you win?
-Hundred bucks.

668
00:48:22,473 --> 00:48:24,600
Come by my room tonight
before you go to bed.

669
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:26,740
-I wanna show you something.
-Okay.

670
00:48:26,944 --> 00:48:29,071
And this is my mom
and Frank and lvan.

671
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,679
Hi.

672
00:48:31,115 --> 00:48:33,845
-Some song, brother.
-Thanks.

673
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:35,942
Hey, Bernard.

674
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,557
I thought we'd have dinner.

675
00:48:44,762 --> 00:48:48,220
Ivan suggested Gage & Tollner. We'd
celebrate my book and your song.

676
00:48:48,432 --> 00:48:50,798
-I'm gonna go with Dad.
-Well, your dad and l...

677
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:54,903
-...talked about all of us going.
-I don't wanna do that. See you.

678
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:58,870
Ivan and I came to see your show.
Don't treat us that way.

679
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:04,746
You think you hate me,
but I know you don't.

680
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,591
Where'd you come up with
those lyrics?

681
00:49:17,828 --> 00:49:19,125
They were very dreamlike.

682
00:49:19,363 --> 00:49:21,490
Reminds me of my second novel,
End of the Line.

683
00:49:21,732 --> 00:49:24,257
-A rock-star character in that.
-I love that novel.

684
00:49:24,535 --> 00:49:27,902
Classic. Scenes with the baby in the
middle are based on me as a baby.

685
00:49:28,105 --> 00:49:30,369
Right. It's Mailer's favorite
of my books.

686
00:49:30,574 --> 00:49:33,543
And I loved your wife's piece
in The New Yorker.

687
00:49:34,178 --> 00:49:36,305
Really? In The New Yorker?

688
00:49:36,547 --> 00:49:39,482
-Did you know about this?
-I guess I did.

689
00:49:39,717 --> 00:49:41,844
-How'd that happen?
-It's an excerpt.

690
00:49:42,086 --> 00:49:44,987
-She's getting a novel published.
-Really?

691
00:49:45,189 --> 00:49:49,592
Walt showed it to me.
It was kind of sad, but really good.

692
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:54,121
The portions are very big here.
You only need half an order.

693
00:49:54,331 --> 00:49:55,798
Okay.

694
00:49:57,501 --> 00:50:00,561
Jesus, $1 5 for parking.

695
00:50:00,805 --> 00:50:03,035
What do you think
I should do about Sophie?

696
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,504
You'll make the right decision.

697
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:11,672
I regret sometimes I wasn't more
of a free agent when I was younger.

698
00:50:11,882 --> 00:50:15,750
A woman approached me at a party at
George Plimpton's after my first book.

699
00:50:15,986 --> 00:50:19,387
She was very sexy.
I could've gone home with her.

700
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,989
Why didn't you?

701
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:24,684
-I was with your mother.
-Oh, right, of course.

702
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,659
You should've probably done it.
It didn't stop her.

703
00:50:31,268 --> 00:50:35,500
Maybe you should sleep
with her once. See if you like it.

704
00:50:35,773 --> 00:50:38,606
It doesn't mean you can't see
other women too.

705
00:50:39,143 --> 00:50:41,703
I don't know if Sophie
will go for that.

706
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,477
Well, after your performance tonight,
things might change for you.

707
00:50:47,017 --> 00:50:48,951
-Wanna go to my house? We could--
-Jesus!

708
00:50:49,153 --> 00:50:52,782
-You really wanna do it, don't you?
-I don't know.

709
00:50:53,023 --> 00:50:56,515
-What's the obsession with sex?
-It's not an obsession.

710
00:50:56,727 --> 00:50:59,389
I'm not so sure I wanna do it either.
I'm scared too.

711
00:50:59,597 --> 00:51:02,532
Scared is not the issue.
Everything is so serious suddenly.

712
00:51:02,733 --> 00:51:05,065
-We're not getting married.
-What are you saying?

713
00:51:05,302 --> 00:51:07,293
Nothing. I don't wanna feel
this pressure.

714
00:51:07,571 --> 00:51:10,597
Do you like someone else?
Your dad's girlfriend?

715
00:51:10,841 --> 00:51:13,002
No. No. Why...?

716
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,734
No. And she's not his girlfriend.

717
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:19,314
My dad said you had a weak
handshake, a sign of indecision.

718
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:21,642
His hands are huge,
I can't get a good grip.

719
00:51:21,919 --> 00:51:24,717
My mom said you don't have
a good model for relationships...

720
00:51:24,922 --> 00:51:27,447
-...because of your parents.
-What?

721
00:51:27,658 --> 00:51:29,990
Your mother doesn't know anything.

722
00:51:30,194 --> 00:51:33,630
I thought it went well.
You told me she said I was hilarious.

723
00:51:37,201 --> 00:51:38,634
Don't be difficult. Please.

724
00:51:42,973 --> 00:51:44,463
You want a beer?

725
00:51:46,143 --> 00:51:49,078
I couldn't take relying on your dad's
shopping habits anymore.

726
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,113
You can have anything
you want whenever.

727
00:51:52,316 --> 00:51:53,943
Thanks.

728
00:51:54,585 --> 00:51:57,110
I'm gonna read you a draft
of my new story.

729
00:51:57,321 --> 00:52:00,813
I wanna hear your thoughts first.
Then I'm gonna show it to your dad.

730
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,525
You like Pink Floyd, huh?

731
00:52:04,728 --> 00:52:06,593
-What?
-Don't worry.

732
00:52:06,797 --> 00:52:10,324
I used to hand in Lou Reed lyrics
in my poetry class...

733
00:52:10,601 --> 00:52:12,193
...and pass them off as my own.

734
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:16,633
Although I hope you don't get caught.
I always did.

735
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,043
Do you--?

736
00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:27,308
-Fuck!
-Sorry.

737
00:52:28,085 --> 00:52:30,610
-Shit!
-Lili, sorry.

738
00:52:30,854 --> 00:52:33,186
It's okay. It's just a....

739
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,359
-It's just a bloody nose.
-I'm sorry.

740
00:52:50,474 --> 00:52:54,774
-I might take a bath, okay?
-Oh, okay.

741
00:52:56,547 --> 00:52:58,538
-Okay.
-Good night.

742
00:53:01,385 --> 00:53:03,250
-Hey.
-Hey.

743
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:11,526
-When's Bernard coming to get you?
-ln an hour.

744
00:53:11,729 --> 00:53:14,721
Plan on 30 minutes.
He's always early to get you.

745
00:53:14,932 --> 00:53:17,230
And late to bring you back.

746
00:53:18,635 --> 00:53:21,103
-I wish I could come with you guys.
-I heard that.

747
00:53:21,338 --> 00:53:25,434
I know. But Dad's got you
on Saturdays.

748
00:53:26,343 --> 00:53:28,937
-Do you like his girlfriend?
-ls she his girlfriend?

749
00:53:29,146 --> 00:53:31,876
I thought so. She lives with you.

750
00:53:32,082 --> 00:53:33,572
-He doesn't say?
-No.

751
00:53:34,618 --> 00:53:35,949
I think Walt loves her.

752
00:53:38,122 --> 00:53:40,556
-So they like the same women now too.
-What?

753
00:53:40,758 --> 00:53:44,888
It's nothing. You got our number
in Maine. Remember to lock up.

754
00:53:45,095 --> 00:53:46,426
I will.

755
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:50,066
-See you next week, Pickle-oo.
-Just Pickle, please.

756
00:53:50,534 --> 00:53:53,264
I'll see you next week, just Pickle.

757
00:53:59,977 --> 00:54:02,912
-Good grip, brother.
-You too, brother.

758
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,856
Dad, it's me.

759
00:54:19,296 --> 00:54:20,923
Are you there?

760
00:54:21,832 --> 00:54:23,356
Pick up.

761
00:54:44,888 --> 00:54:46,515
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

762
00:54:46,723 --> 00:54:50,887
"lt has been a long, emotionally
draining day and night.

763
00:54:51,161 --> 00:54:53,561
'Who is that boy?'
someone in the pub asks.

764
00:54:54,364 --> 00:54:56,832
Pitchum climbs into his rented VW...

765
00:54:57,101 --> 00:55:01,538
...and drives off past the cliffs of Dover
into the muted English sunrise...

766
00:55:01,872 --> 00:55:05,205
...another chapter of his life
behind him."

767
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:10,413
I'm sorry about the turnout.
Kids go home early for Passover.

768
00:55:10,647 --> 00:55:12,547
They seemed to like it.

769
00:56:17,114 --> 00:56:20,914
I mean, masturbating
is his own issue.

770
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:24,348
But Hector witnessed
the locker incident...

771
00:56:24,555 --> 00:56:28,013
...and then later,
semen was found in the library.

772
00:56:28,225 --> 00:56:29,920
Who's Hector?

773
00:56:32,029 --> 00:56:33,929
How do you know
they were both Frank's?

774
00:56:34,131 --> 00:56:38,864
Well, I suppose it's possible
other kids are masturbating...

775
00:56:39,102 --> 00:56:42,333
...and spreading their semen
around the school as well.

776
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:45,531
It's possible, but somewhat unlikely.

777
00:56:45,842 --> 00:56:47,833
Oh, it happens, I'm sure,
more than we know.

778
00:56:48,045 --> 00:56:50,513
Bernard, have you ever done
anything like this?

779
00:56:50,714 --> 00:56:52,045
I'm not going to answer that.

780
00:56:52,249 --> 00:56:56,310
Has anything been going on at home
that might've provoked this behavior?

781
00:56:57,221 --> 00:57:01,180
Well, Bernard left him behind
for three days last week.

782
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:04,019
Of course, Frank's mother
divorced me earlier this year.

783
00:57:04,228 --> 00:57:06,355
Which also might
have something to do with it.

784
00:57:07,898 --> 00:57:11,231
Ms. Berkman, I read your story
in The New Yorker.

785
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:15,562
-I thought it was quite moving.
-Thanks.

786
00:57:15,806 --> 00:57:17,364
Thanks a lot.

787
00:57:18,909 --> 00:57:21,241
You're living with a 20-year-old.

788
00:57:22,012 --> 00:57:25,539
-It's none of your business.
-lt is when you have our kids.

789
00:57:25,749 --> 00:57:27,444
It's confusing for them.

790
00:57:28,085 --> 00:57:30,076
Frank says WaIt's in love with her.

791
00:57:30,921 --> 00:57:32,946
Walt has a girlfriend.

792
00:57:33,357 --> 00:57:34,654
Fuck off, Joan.

793
00:57:35,626 --> 00:57:40,154
I don't ask about you and lvan.
Stay out of my life.

794
00:57:40,364 --> 00:57:42,491
I can't believe
you'd talk to me like this.

795
00:57:42,733 --> 00:57:45,827
You left all those fucking ticket stubs
and letters lying around.

796
00:57:46,103 --> 00:57:47,434
You wanted me to know.

797
00:57:48,605 --> 00:57:51,267
It was fucking torture, Joan.

798
00:57:51,675 --> 00:57:53,040
Fucking torture.

799
00:58:16,433 --> 00:58:18,094
He made his own interpretation.

800
00:58:18,335 --> 00:58:20,963
He's still gonna have to
give the prize money back.

801
00:58:21,204 --> 00:58:25,368
But obviously it's a bigger problem.
He isn't doing his schoolwork either.

802
00:58:25,642 --> 00:58:28,008
His paper on Gatsby
was quite brilliant, I thought.

803
00:58:28,211 --> 00:58:29,735
It's one of his favorite books.

804
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,847
That may be,
but I don't believe he's read it.

805
00:58:33,116 --> 00:58:35,084
You both should talk to him.

806
00:58:35,285 --> 00:58:37,753
I think Bernard has to do it.

807
00:58:47,497 --> 00:58:49,124
He wants you to see a therapist.

808
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:51,164
-I don't need that.
-That's what I said.

809
00:58:51,435 --> 00:58:54,563
Does Simic know both your parents
have Ph.D.'s in literature?

810
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:56,931
-I mentioned it.
-I think he's full of shit.

811
00:58:57,207 --> 00:59:00,176
These public schools tend to hire
well-meaning but ultimately...

812
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:03,709
-...unsophisticated bureaucrats.
-Yeah. I don't like him.

813
00:59:04,414 --> 00:59:07,611
But you might have to do it.
Just to please the school.

814
00:59:07,851 --> 00:59:09,614
-I don't need it.
-I know.

815
00:59:09,853 --> 00:59:14,153
And unfortunately, probably a guy
with a BA in psychology.

816
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:15,882
Not a real shrink.

817
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:19,026
I have an MA
in developmental psychology...

818
00:59:19,229 --> 00:59:22,289
-...from the Yale Child Studies program.
-Did you get a Ph.D.?

819
00:59:22,499 --> 00:59:23,796
No, an MA is a Master's.

820
00:59:24,901 --> 00:59:26,459
Right.

821
00:59:26,737 --> 00:59:30,571
-Any thoughts about why you're here?
-Not really.

822
00:59:30,774 --> 00:59:33,572
You said you wrote the song
you played in assembly.

823
00:59:33,777 --> 00:59:35,404
-Why?
-I don't know.

824
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:37,670
Did you have a reason?

825
00:59:38,582 --> 00:59:40,607
-I felt I could've written it.
-Okay.

826
00:59:41,184 --> 00:59:42,674
But you didn't.

827
00:59:42,886 --> 00:59:45,013
It was written by
Roger Waters of Pink Floyd.

828
00:59:45,455 --> 00:59:47,821
-I think you know that.
-But I felt I could've.

829
00:59:48,024 --> 00:59:51,187
So the fact that it was already written
was kind of a technicality.

830
00:59:51,395 --> 00:59:52,760
I see.

831
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:56,396
I can imagine this is a little
uncomfortable for you to talk about.

832
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:02,038
-I guess. It's hard to explain.
-I wonder how you're feeling right now.

833
01:00:02,506 --> 01:00:03,803
I don't know.

834
01:00:04,274 --> 01:00:07,402
Why don't you tell me about
something less uncomfortable.

835
01:00:07,611 --> 01:00:09,442
Like a nice memory, maybe.

836
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:11,579
Isn't that a stock question
for a shrink?

837
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:14,751
Yes. That's more or less
how this works.

838
01:00:14,951 --> 01:00:17,283
-I can't think of anything right now.
-Just think.

839
01:00:17,487 --> 01:00:19,955
-Come on.
-Just something.

840
01:00:20,624 --> 01:00:22,854
Meet me halfway here.

841
01:00:23,827 --> 01:00:25,590
All right, let's see.

842
01:00:27,998 --> 01:00:29,795
Okay.

843
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,195
When I was around 6,
my Mom and l...

844
01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:34,664
...ducked out of Julie Glynn's
birthday party...

845
01:00:34,938 --> 01:00:37,270
...to watch Robin Hood
together on our TV.

846
01:00:37,474 --> 01:00:39,101
That sounds like a nice memory.

847
01:00:39,342 --> 01:00:41,367
-I liked Errol Flynn.
-Errol Flynn.

848
01:00:42,245 --> 01:00:45,180
-That's all?
-And...

849
01:00:45,382 --> 01:00:48,317
...I was glad she let me leave the party
to watch the movie.

850
01:00:48,552 --> 01:00:51,453
She and I loved that movie.

851
01:00:52,122 --> 01:00:53,919
It's like....

852
01:00:54,191 --> 01:00:57,683
It's like we were pals then,
and we'd do things together.

853
01:00:57,928 --> 01:00:59,896
We'd look at the knight armor
at the Met.

854
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:02,758
The scary fish
at the Natural History museum.

855
01:01:02,966 --> 01:01:05,594
I was always afraid of the squid
and the whale fighting.

856
01:01:05,836 --> 01:01:08,771
I could only look at it with my hands
in front of my face.

857
01:01:11,741 --> 01:01:14,710
When we'd get home,
after my bath, she'd go through...

858
01:01:14,911 --> 01:01:18,938
...all the different things we saw
that day at the museum. And....

859
01:01:19,149 --> 01:01:22,812
And we'd get to the squid and the
whale, and she'd describe it for me.

860
01:01:23,987 --> 01:01:26,615
Which was--
It was still scary...

861
01:01:26,823 --> 01:01:28,586
...but it was less scary.

862
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:33,252
Anyway, it was fun.
It was fun to hear about it.

863
01:01:35,131 --> 01:01:38,100
Did your dad live at home
back then?

864
01:01:38,301 --> 01:01:41,737
-Yeah, why?
-You didn't mention him.

865
01:01:41,972 --> 01:01:44,270
Where was he during all of this?

866
01:01:45,976 --> 01:01:47,603
He was....

867
01:01:48,345 --> 01:01:51,075
I don't know exactly. He was....

868
01:01:51,281 --> 01:01:53,340
He was downstairs, maybe.

869
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:58,283
He didn't ever come to the museum.
This was before my brother was born.

870
01:01:58,488 --> 01:02:00,353
It was before....

871
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:03,786
It was earlier.

872
01:02:08,365 --> 01:02:10,265
Hello?

873
01:02:14,871 --> 01:02:16,429
Hello?

874
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:23,607
-Not now, Bernard.
-Why not?

875
01:02:23,813 --> 01:02:25,872
I'm just not, okay?

876
01:02:26,616 --> 01:02:28,743
-Put me in your mouth.
-Walt!

877
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,388
-Hi.
-Hey, Walt.

878
01:02:34,157 --> 01:02:35,556
Hi.

879
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:39,819
I'll be right out. We can hang out.

880
01:02:58,181 --> 01:03:01,480
-Hi. Is Walt here?
-No.

881
01:03:03,019 --> 01:03:05,647
I'd like you to come to my house.

882
01:03:06,122 --> 01:03:10,388
-lsn't it Mom's night?
-Yeah, but I'd like you to come over.

883
01:03:11,194 --> 01:03:13,560
I have to put on my shoes.

884
01:03:14,464 --> 01:03:16,398
Come in, I guess.

885
01:03:21,171 --> 01:03:25,198
-Place looks different.
-She got some new furniture in Maine.

886
01:03:25,475 --> 01:03:28,410
That was my TV. I bought that TV.

887
01:03:35,218 --> 01:03:36,981
That's my Jude the Obscure.

888
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,688
-Wanna take it?
-No.

889
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,956
She still has some of the books
you wrote.

890
01:03:46,563 --> 01:03:51,000
Dad, why are you taking me
to your house on Mom's night?

891
01:03:54,804 --> 01:03:56,601
Just a minute.

892
01:04:04,347 --> 01:04:05,439
Hi.

893
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,810
Frank let me in.
I didn't realize you were here.

894
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,080
-I'm here. It's Monday.
-I'd like to take him for just tonight.

895
01:04:13,289 --> 01:04:16,588
I'll give you two Thursdays in a row
or something.

896
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,987
-Mom.
-It's my night. He wants to stay.

897
01:04:20,797 --> 01:04:23,027
Be careful. That's an antique.

898
01:04:25,568 --> 01:04:28,696
-Where's Walt?
-I don't know where Walt is.

899
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:30,803
He's not up there. Bernard!

900
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:33,236
He doesn't come here.

901
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:36,278
You should go.
You'll see him tomorrow.

902
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:41,543
Tell Walt to call me.

903
01:05:48,985 --> 01:05:50,976
I dunked my head
in that pond in the park.

904
01:05:51,187 --> 01:05:54,623
The one near the zoo?
Oh, sweetie, that's filthy.

905
01:05:54,824 --> 01:05:56,451
I hope you didn't drink any of it.

906
01:05:56,659 --> 01:05:59,856
Some may have gotten in my mouth.
I tried not to swallow.

907
01:06:03,433 --> 01:06:05,298
I shouldn't have broken up
with Sophie.

908
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:10,501
-Why did you?
-I thought I could do better.

909
01:06:11,808 --> 01:06:13,537
Better how?

910
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:17,003
I don't know.

911
01:06:19,582 --> 01:06:21,311
That's good. You miss her.

912
01:06:21,518 --> 01:06:25,079
But I don't see myself as a person
who is in this situation. I just don't.

913
01:06:26,523 --> 01:06:28,957
I don't see myself this way.

914
01:06:29,592 --> 01:06:31,651
Well, this is how it is.

915
01:06:32,362 --> 01:06:34,193
Did you ever love Dad?

916
01:06:34,397 --> 01:06:36,729
Because if you didn't,
why did you ever marry him?

917
01:06:36,933 --> 01:06:39,231
If you were gonna leave,
why put us through this?

918
01:06:39,469 --> 01:06:43,701
It wasn't planned. When we first met,
he was unlike anyone.

919
01:06:44,574 --> 01:06:47,042
In Columbus,
there was no one like your dad.

920
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:50,135
I had had an affair with a man
before your father.

921
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:53,178
He worked at the bookstore.
We made love in the stockroom.

922
01:06:53,383 --> 01:06:56,216
Mom, I don't wanna hear
about your affairs, please.

923
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,517
I'm sorry.

924
01:07:00,723 --> 01:07:02,418
I don't know what I can say to you.

925
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:05,025
You say things in a way
that I don't wanna hear them.

926
01:07:05,261 --> 01:07:06,751
I know, Chicken.

927
01:07:07,063 --> 01:07:09,896
It's something I do. It's a bad habit.

928
01:07:12,635 --> 01:07:14,762
Do you remember
when we watched Robin Hood?

929
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:21,105
-He knocked on my window.
-Bernard, what are you doing?

930
01:07:21,311 --> 01:07:22,778
Joan, let me ask you something.

931
01:07:22,979 --> 01:07:25,277
The work I did
at the end of our marriage...

932
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:29,042
...making dinners, being attentive.
It never was gonna make a difference.

933
01:07:29,285 --> 01:07:31,446
-You were leaving.
-You never made a dinner.

934
01:07:31,654 --> 01:07:33,281
I made burgers
when you had pneumonia.

935
01:07:33,489 --> 01:07:36,083
-Only after I insisted.
-lf I had made more dinners...

936
01:07:36,292 --> 01:07:39,659
-...would that have made a difference?
-I was ready to leave long ago.

937
01:07:39,863 --> 01:07:41,421
I just didn't know it then.

938
01:07:41,664 --> 01:07:45,156
I've been giving it some thought.
You called my father at the last minute.

939
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:48,802
Whatever you said,
he thought I could save the marriage.

940
01:07:49,072 --> 01:07:53,338
You felt I wasn't aggressive enough.
I'll make more of an effort to do stuff.

941
01:07:53,543 --> 01:07:55,704
I've been cooking
and doing chores at my house.

942
01:07:55,912 --> 01:07:58,403
I make veal cutlets,
which the boys love.

943
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:03,742
Why don't we all have dinner
and talk more about this?

944
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,391
I'm sorry.

945
01:08:16,599 --> 01:08:19,329
It's just....

946
01:08:19,969 --> 01:08:21,834
Burgers.

947
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:29,978
I'll sue you, Joan. You know I will.

948
01:08:30,179 --> 01:08:32,977
You had an affair for four years
with that fucking shrink...

949
01:08:33,182 --> 01:08:35,446
...that ruined our marriage.
I can get the kids.

950
01:08:35,652 --> 01:08:39,349
Eddie Goodman works on these cases.
And I have an open-and-shut case.

951
01:08:39,589 --> 01:08:41,614
-Frank, Walt, get in the car.
-Sue me?

952
01:08:41,858 --> 01:08:44,156
That's-- I can't--

953
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:48,626
You only wanted joint custody because
you pay less child support that way.

954
01:08:49,532 --> 01:08:51,659
Because it's cheaper for you.

955
01:08:51,901 --> 01:08:53,163
Walt, Frank!

956
01:08:53,603 --> 01:08:56,697
-I don't wanna go.
-I don't give a shit! Get in the car.

957
01:08:56,973 --> 01:08:59,271
-Frank!
-Let him stay. Let him stay.

958
01:08:59,475 --> 01:09:01,841
-I'm just asking this one thing.
-He wants to stay.

959
01:09:02,045 --> 01:09:03,444
-Let him. I'll go.
-Fine.

960
01:09:05,148 --> 01:09:06,945
Hold on.

961
01:09:09,652 --> 01:09:11,677
You want him tonight?

962
01:09:11,955 --> 01:09:14,856
Okay. Thanks.

963
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,256
That's all right, my brother.

964
01:09:20,096 --> 01:09:21,825
The cat!

965
01:09:25,101 --> 01:09:26,568
I got him. Joan, I got him.

966
01:09:28,137 --> 01:09:29,764
I got him.

967
01:09:33,142 --> 01:09:34,700
Goddamn it.

968
01:09:35,078 --> 01:09:38,138
-Dad! You see him go--?
-I'm moving it!

969
01:09:39,082 --> 01:09:40,140
Fuck off.

970
01:09:45,822 --> 01:09:48,290
Whoa, Bernard! You all right?

971
01:09:48,758 --> 01:09:50,885
-I had him.
-Joan, call an ambulance!

972
01:09:53,096 --> 01:09:55,462
Walt, get in the car.

973
01:10:13,716 --> 01:10:15,479
What?

974
01:10:16,552 --> 01:10:19,385
It means "bitch."
Don't you remember?

975
01:10:19,622 --> 01:10:20,953
You're calling me a bitch?

976
01:10:21,157 --> 01:10:24,991
No, don't you remember the last line
of Godard's A bout de souffle?

977
01:10:25,194 --> 01:10:28,425
Belmondo calls Seberg a bitch.

978
01:10:30,733 --> 01:10:32,826
We saw it at the Thalia
with the Dicksteins.

979
01:10:33,102 --> 01:10:36,629
I got you in for the children's price.
You were pregnant with Walt.

980
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,705
Like six weeks.

981
01:10:38,975 --> 01:10:41,500
I still got you in
for a children's ticket.

982
01:10:41,711 --> 01:10:45,511
You told me you didn't like Godard.
You thought the jump cuts were--

983
01:10:45,748 --> 01:10:48,774
I'd check for the cat
behind the ashcans...

984
01:10:48,985 --> 01:10:51,215
-... under the Golodners' stoop!
-Okay.

985
01:10:59,662 --> 01:11:01,562
I didn't write it.

986
01:11:02,899 --> 01:11:06,062
-I know.
-Pink Floyd did.

987
01:11:06,502 --> 01:11:08,834
Do you think we'll find him?

988
01:11:09,038 --> 01:11:10,665
I hope so.

989
01:11:12,308 --> 01:11:15,800
Do you think one day
we could go to the Galapagos?

990
01:11:17,346 --> 01:11:19,473
I don't know, Pickle.

991
01:11:20,249 --> 01:11:24,549
Ivan and I could take you to the
country on Saturday to see real turtles.

992
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:30,391
Saturday is Dad's day.

993
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:37,827
-There's my son.
-Hey.

994
01:11:38,468 --> 01:11:39,730
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

995
01:11:40,269 --> 01:11:44,171
Thought it was a heart attack,
but I think I'm just exhausted.

996
01:11:44,373 --> 01:11:46,773
Doctor said I'm exhausted.

997
01:11:46,976 --> 01:11:50,241
-Too many veal cutlets?
-Maybe.

998
01:11:51,547 --> 01:11:53,208
That a good book?

999
01:11:53,449 --> 01:11:55,474
Oh, this is pulp. It's not serious.

1000
01:11:55,751 --> 01:11:59,482
It's hard to read a good book in the
hospital, but this isn't bad of its kind.

1001
01:11:59,689 --> 01:12:03,216
Leonard is the fillet
of the crime genre.

1002
01:12:05,461 --> 01:12:09,261
I'd like you to stay here for the day.
I need the company.

1003
01:12:10,666 --> 01:12:12,031
Okay.

1004
01:12:13,169 --> 01:12:15,137
Lili moved out.

1005
01:12:19,709 --> 01:12:22,405
Do me a favor, go out in the hall,
get me another pillow.

1006
01:12:22,612 --> 01:12:24,239
My neck is hurting.

1007
01:12:33,289 --> 01:12:36,918
Maybe we could even things out,
and I could stay at Mom's a few nights.

1008
01:12:37,126 --> 01:12:39,754
-I've been staying more at yours.
-It's not a good time.

1009
01:12:39,962 --> 01:12:42,863
I'm not gonna be 1 00 percent
for a while. I'd like you around.

1010
01:12:43,099 --> 01:12:45,533
-I don't wanna come for a while.
-It's not up to you.

1011
01:12:45,768 --> 01:12:49,169
You're a minor. You're in my custody.
My home is your home too.

1012
01:12:51,841 --> 01:12:53,604
I'm not coming.

1013
01:12:53,876 --> 01:12:55,275
Why?

1014
01:12:56,179 --> 01:12:58,374
That hurts my feelings.

1015
01:13:01,817 --> 01:13:03,717
Don't be difficult.

1016
01:13:04,554 --> 01:13:08,388
If you like, we can get you some
more posters, make your room better.

1017
01:13:08,624 --> 01:13:10,717
Paint it a different color.

1018
01:13:19,869 --> 01:13:23,202
I can lend you my first edition
of The Naked and the Dead.

1019
01:13:23,806 --> 01:13:25,569
As a present.

1020
01:13:26,776 --> 01:13:28,539
Let me get you a pillow.

1021
01:13:42,858 --> 01:13:46,316
You used to be very emotional
when you were younger.

1022
01:13:52,468 --> 01:13:55,494
Did I look pretty silly out there,
falling on the concrete?

1023
01:13:55,771 --> 01:13:57,204
Yeah.

1024
01:13:59,642 --> 01:14:01,667
What? What are you laughing at?

1025
01:14:01,877 --> 01:14:03,868
That was funny how you said,
"Yeah."

1026
01:14:04,113 --> 01:14:06,673
-Good comic timing.
-Thanks.

1027
01:14:10,753 --> 01:14:12,448
Why don't we get some breakfast.

1028
01:14:12,722 --> 01:14:15,213
See if you can find a nurse out there.

1029
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,929
Try to get the blond.
She looks like a young Monica Vitti.

1030
01:14:22,064 --> 01:14:23,361
Oh, excuse me.

1031
01:14:23,566 --> 01:14:26,194
The man in that room
wants to order some breakfast.

1032
01:14:26,435 --> 01:14:27,834
Okay.
