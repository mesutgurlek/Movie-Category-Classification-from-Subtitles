1
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:31,920
''Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. Krishna;
Krishna; Hare; Hare.''

2
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,493
''Hare Rama; Hare Krishna. Krishna;
Krishna; Hare; Hare.''

3
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:43,363
''Hare Rama; Hare Krishna.''

4
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:47,499
''You dwell in my heart.''

5
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:50,909
''Whether its dusk or dawn.''

6
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:53,907
''Whether in light or darkness.''

7
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:57,315
''You're always with me.''

8
00:02:57,586 --> 00:03:00,680
lt was my mother's dying wish..

9
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:04,850
..to take the entire 'Bhajan
Mandli' group along with their family..

10
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:07,357
..on a trip to Badrinath.

11
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,557
Please do come.

12
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,794
Of course.

13
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:14,597
Please join us on the trip..

14
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:17,965
..and pray for my mother's soul.

15
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:22,833
My mother.

16
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:29,875
Why do souls become
restless after they die?

17
00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:33,412
l mean, once you're dead
it's the end of all problems.

18
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:34,580
Why become restless?

19
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:35,987
That's not it.

20
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:41,590
Suppose the deceased
has a unfulfilled wish.

21
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,721
Then his son will fulfil it.

22
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:45,856
You won't go on the trip.

23
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:49,429
Get that.

24
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:51,768
Her mother was in the hospital
for two years.

25
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:53,374
And he didn't even come take a look.

26
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,874
He was making dollars in America.

27
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:59,003
This charade is for the world.

28
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:01,539
Not for his mother's soul.

29
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:04,485
No need to look so depressed..

30
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:05,850
..you won't get an off.

31
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:08,549
Get that.

32
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,394
Just one idol left!

33
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:20,765
By the way, where's the trip headed?

34
00:04:28,743 --> 00:04:30,677
l can't believe you're coming with us.

35
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:33,646
The children are so happy.

36
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:36,684
She thinks you are crazy.

37
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:38,013
l am going on a visit to the temple.
- ''Hare Rama; Hare Krishna.''

38
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:41,647
''Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare.''

39
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,315
''Hare Rama; Hare Krishna.''

40
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:48,692
''Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare.''

41
00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:56,495
Where is he?

42
00:05:02,544 --> 00:05:04,774
- A dozen of
pot-bellied Ganesh idols. - What!

43
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:07,281
Those Krishnas worth 250.

44
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:09,649
Eight of those brawny Hanumans.

45
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:12,678
- What are you saying? - And
five of those 'Sherawali'.

46
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:13,915
The lady sitting on the tiger.

47
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:16,412
What's the total?

48
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:18,254
Three dozen, sir.
- Three dozen, right!

49
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,888
Then, three Sai Babas bonus.
- What?

50
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:22,763
They are in a big demand.

51
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:25,830
Send it to the white
Volvo parked there. - Okay.

52
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:51,451
''Hare Rama; Hare Krishna.''

53
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,320
What did you give him?

54
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:57,454
Give me too. - Funny, people are
distributing alcohol like offerings..

55
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,867
What's that?

56
00:06:07,308 --> 00:06:08,366
What should l say?

57
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,772
Water of Ganges.
- Yes, yes.

58
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:11,343
Oh, give me some.

59
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:17,511
Why is it so bitter?

60
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:19,277
Because the Ganges is polluted.

61
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:20,783
Oh!
- Yes.

62
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:29,622
''Hare Rama; Hare Krishna.''

63
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:33,426
''Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare.''

64
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:36,800
''Hare Rama; Hare Krishna.''

65
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:40,534
''Krishna; Krishna; Hare; Hare.''

66
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:44,609
Apologise. They were fasting.

67
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:49,675
Hello.
- We were fasting.

68
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:51,309
And you gave us alcohol.

69
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:53,317
Alcohol is permitted in fasts.

70
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:55,481
lt's made from sugarcane.

71
00:06:55,824 --> 00:07:00,784
lt fills you with energy,
and makes you lightheaded.

72
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,264
- Rascal. Keep the phone down.
- You'll never learn.

73
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:06,697
Abusing in the month of
'Shravan' (pious month).

74
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:10,736
See. Truth sounds bitter than liquor.

75
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,238
There's a limit to cracking jokes.

76
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,467
Papa, please.

77
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,601
What you did yesterday,
is a sin in mummy's view.

78
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:19,613
And mummy's fasting
today to repent for it.

79
00:07:19,948 --> 00:07:21,575
l want to know.

80
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,714
How can she repent
for my sins by fasting?

81
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,315
Sushila, it's like
your phone's on charging..

82
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:30,789
..and my battery's getting charged.

83
00:07:31,426 --> 00:07:32,484
ls it Wi-fi?

84
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,693
Chintu, careful.

85
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:36,822
Papa.

86
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:38,688
Get down.

87
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,792
Papa, we're practising.

88
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:42,562
Today's 'Janmastami'.

89
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:44,002
You've your exams tomorrow.

90
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:45,705
Who will write that?

91
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:47,398
Get down!

92
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:48,965
Why do you always stop
for religious things?

93
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:51,003
He'll be absolutely fine.

94
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,271
My son's playing Govinda.

95
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:56,442
My son won't become
Govinda or Chunkey Pandey.

96
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,318
He'll grow up to become a cricketer.

97
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:00,615
Get down. Get down.

98
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:01,778
Come on.

99
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,761
Mahadev.
- Coming.

100
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,854
- Let's go.
- Come soon.

101
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:13,366
Listen.
Remove the tag of Rs.250 from..

102
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:16,529
..all the new idols that we bought.
- Yes.

103
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,336
Now, watch how l sell
it for 10-12 thousand.

104
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,470
And keep one idol from
each on display. - Okay.

105
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,937
Understand?
- Yes.

106
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:28,306
Come on.

107
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,479
One and only one piece in the world.

108
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:36,950
This idol appeared from the ground..
- Yes.

109
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,883
..when the temple at
Badrinath was being built.

110
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:41,626
What are you saying?

111
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:45,460
A great sage from Dwarka set
out for a journey on foot..

112
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,562
..and that afternoon the
sun was really scorching..

113
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:50,297
..l gave him a jug of water to drink.

114
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,935
He was so pleased.

115
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:56,602
And gave me this idol.

116
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:59,776
And this idol turned my luck around.

117
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:01,805
l bought this, once a rented shop..

118
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,851
..and a three room
house in Bhooleshwar.

119
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:06,813
With terrace.

120
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:08,412
With terrace.

121
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:09,649
Amazing!

122
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:12,591
Mr. Kanji, sell this idol to me.

123
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:16,295
l am in big trouble.

124
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:20,393
l'll rot in hell
if l even think of selling my Lord.

125
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,732
Sell the God? Look
at what he's saying.

126
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:24,771
Mischievous... Lord.

127
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:27,802
Listen carefully.
- Yes.

128
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:29,503
You can hear His flute.

129
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:31,503
lt's time for him to play His flute.

130
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:32,773
What are you saying?
- Try to hear with devotion.

131
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:36,283
Listen, you can hear
the echo of Mathura.

132
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:42,519
Rajastan, Om Sai Ram.

133
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:46,255
Heard it?

134
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:47,988
Can you hear?
- Yes, yes.

135
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,697
Now leave. - Sell this idol to me.
Please, Mr. Kanji.

136
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:53,859
l'll let this idol out of my sight..

137
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:55,733
..only when that
special person arrives.

138
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,270
The chosen one.

139
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,569
Who is that?

140
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:02,434
The sage had said that
''A great devotee of Sai..

141
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:06,942
''..from Rajasthan
will come for His ldol''.

142
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,972
That's amazing.
- What?

143
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:11,343
That's me.
- No, no.

144
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,579
Look, there's my car.

145
00:10:12,687 --> 00:10:13,779
RJ, Rajasthan.

146
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,417
And it also has an 'Om Sai' sticker.

147
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:18,681
That's true.

148
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,954
What did you say your name was?

149
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:22,556
Bhanwar Lal.
- Bhanwar Lal?

150
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:26,599
Mahadev...it's him?
- What?

151
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:28,633
Who?
- lt's him?

152
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,032
What happened? - The sage had
written your name himself.

153
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,429
Look.

154
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,907
Bhanwar Lal.

155
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:37,969
l don't understand
a word that's written here.

156
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:39,707
lt's written in Madrasi.

157
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:42,614
He was a Madrasi.
Though he lived in Dwarka but, look..

158
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:44,842
Great.

159
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,443
This idol now belongs to you.

160
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:48,320
Thank you.

161
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:49,447
Great.

162
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,389
Kanji Money?
- Bhanwar Lal.

163
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:53,324
You only listen, but don't understand.

164
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,755
l said l won't
charge you for this idol..

165
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,355
..but l will have to pay the sage.

166
00:10:58,433 --> 00:10:59,695
Yes, of course.

167
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:03,470
Here you go. 100 rupees.

168
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:06,706
Only 100..
- Mahadev. Mahadev.

169
00:11:06,975 --> 00:11:09,705
This is a question of devotion.
We cannot force anyone.

170
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,342
Do you how much l had at that time?

171
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:13,710
Only 20 rupees.

172
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:14,941
Only 20 rupees. Remember?

173
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:15,972
So do you know what l did?

174
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:20,277
l was wearing a similar gold chain.
And l gave that to him.

175
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:22,286
lt's all about faith.

176
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:23,722
Anything you give is less.

177
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,019
Anything you give is less.

178
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:26,851
Wow. What a thought.

179
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:30,591
Not just my gold chain,
l will give up my gold ring too.

180
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:32,428
That's it.

181
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,933
Here. Here you go.
- Great. Take of everything.

182
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:35,333
Take of everything.
- Take it.

183
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,000
Great, great, great.

184

Glory.

186
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,670
Now, where will this idol emerge from?

187
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,010
From the land of Mathura, where else?

188
00:11:47,982 --> 00:11:51,645
Glory to Sri Kanji Lalji Mehta.

189
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,778
Glory to you.

190
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:55,982
As long as people
believe in toys like this..

191
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:58,720
..our business will prosper.

192
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:02,354
Kanji. This is the God's idol,
don't call it a toy.

193
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,457
The Lord is only a delusion.
- Yes, let's go.

194
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:13,600
lsn't that Chintu?

195
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:15,374
Yes.

196

Yes, that's him.
- Yes.

197
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:21,273
Yes. He's dancing so well.

198
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,408

Why?
- l'm going on Haj.

203
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,386
l suggest that you
get your shop fixed..

204
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,622
..rather than going on a Haj.

205
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:36,856
God save me from devils.

206
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:40,594
Your shop will come crashing
down even if anyone sneezes.

207

Stop you fool!

your unpardonable sin.

325
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,708
He will punish you Himself.

326
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,247
He will punish you.

327
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:37,910
Don't try to scare me
in the name of Lord.

328
00:19:39,453 --> 00:19:41,250
l'll see what He does to me.

329
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:46,691
Go home, it's going to rain.

330
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,819
You'll get drenched.

331
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,494
lt's an earthquake.

332
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,497
Swamiji Rain?

333
00:19:57,838 --> 00:19:59,806
Rain?
- Rain?

334
00:20:05,546 --> 00:20:06,570
My hand's paining.

335
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:07,875
l won't be able to
write my exam tomorrow.

336
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:09,006
l'll slap you.

337
00:20:09,283 --> 00:20:11,342
l'll make you hold the pen in
your mouth and write your paper.

338
00:20:12,286 --> 00:20:13,617
You're scolding him.

339
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:15,848
But what about you?
- What did l do?

340
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,015
What?

341
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,517
The festivities were left incomplete.

342
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:20,986
You've to admit that there's God.

343
00:20:21,295 --> 00:20:22,387
You spread the rumour..

344
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:23,725
..and immediately
there was an earthquake.

345
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:25,492
- Remember.
- What earthquake?

346
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,834
Even the utensils didn't budge.

347
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:30,336
Papa.

348
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:33,473
l think they took your
announcement too seriously.

349
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:37,508
This news just came in
from parts of the country..

350
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:41,378
..that the idol of Sri
Krishna's eating butter.

351
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:43,449
ls the Lord eating butter?
- No.

352
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:46,345
Priest, offer the
Lord some buttermilk.

353
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,012
People are offering cheese,
cottage-cheese..

354
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:52,554
..butter, buttermilk to
the idol of Krishna. - Oh, God!

355
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,491
The rumour has spread so far.

356
00:20:54,662 --> 00:20:56,061
Please, eat it.

357
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:58,456
This is low-cholesterol cheese.

358
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,500
The Lord's so lucky.

359
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:03,299
Look at the things He's getting.

360
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:05,500
Earlier, people would keep
it in a covered platter..

361
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:06,369
..in front of Him.

362
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,305
But now they're feeding Him.

363
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:09,831
Let Him enjoy.

364
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,502
lt's your fault.

365
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,940
Mumbai just experienced a
slight earthquake tremor..

366
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:18,644
..of 3.5 Richter scale,
which didn't cause..

367
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:20,979
..any harm to life or property.

368
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:23,654
See. Heard that?

369
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:26,284
But a shop in the flea
market has collapsed..

370
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,555
..which was closed at that time.

371
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:30,522
Must be Mohammad's shop.

372
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:32,361
According to our sources..

373
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:36,529
..the shop was registered
to Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.

374
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,673
lt's really surprising, because..

375
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:48,010
..there are other old shops in
this market which are still intact.

376
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:52,411
But Kanji Lalji Mehta's shop
has been completely destroyed.

377
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:56,354
This is Shweta Tiwari, with
cameraman Vaibhav Mishra, ABP News.

378
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:59,051
Sister, switch on ABP News quickly.

379
00:21:59,593 --> 00:22:00,560
We saw.

380
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:02,255
Brother-in-law's shop
is gone. lt's collapsed.

381
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:04,560
Pravin!
- Calm down, father.

382
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,891
No, sister. Come
there with the children.

383
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:09,265
l'm coming there with
father and the others. - Yes.

384
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:10,325
Yes, we're coming.

385
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,736
We're coming.

386
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:17,634
The idols of Gods
have gone underneath.

387
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,551
The shop is completely ruined

388
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,621
Doesn't seem like
there was ever a shop here.

389
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:35,753
What are you saying?

390
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:37,956
We had goods worth 25 lakhs.

391
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:40,592
And we'll have to
pay the scrap dealer..

392
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:42,033
..to have this cleared.

393
00:22:42,302 --> 00:22:43,428
Why pay?

394
00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:45,604
We'll give him one
of the broken idols..

395
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:47,868
..and say ''lt appeared
from the ground in Amarnath''.

396
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:49,932
What are you saying, brother-in-law?

397
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,671
You'll soon be bankrupt.

398
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,804
Do you know the
losses you've incurred?

399
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:55,314
40 lakhs.

400
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,512
Goods worth 25 lakhs
bought on credit..

401
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,484
..and 15 lakhs spent on
renovation last month.

402
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,511
40 lakhs? Where did you
get that kind of money?

403
00:23:02,823 --> 00:23:07,317
We borrowed a part of the
amount by mortgaging the house.

404
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:12,264
And l borrowed 10 lakhs from a friend.

405
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:14,266
And 5 lakhs from your own pocket..

406
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:16,325
..for earning 18% interest.

407
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:17,734
Pravin, you fool.

408
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:19,363
You didn't even ask me.

409
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:23,476
How will we arrange
for such a huge sum?

410
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,976
There's hardly 30-40
thousand in the bank.

411
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,912
And we don't even have jewellery.

412
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:34,687
Sushila. We'll manage.
- How?

413
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,848
Why don't you understand?

414
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:41,891
lf you hadn't spoken
ill about the Lord..

415
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,293
..He wouldn't have
caused this earthquake.

416
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:46,657
His justice is silent.

417
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:49,430
Will you please stop preaching?

418
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:52,732
You mean to say, that the Lord..

419
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,934
..who doesn't exist,
razed down my shop..

420
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:57,738
..because l spoke ill about Him?

421
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,646
So, just to prove Himself..

422
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,378
..he razed down just
my shop in a fit of rage.

423
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:08,785
And if l still don't believe in Him..

424
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:11,723
..he will make me incur more losses?
- Yes.

425
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:12,816
What yes?

426
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,761
l still don't believe in You?

427
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:21,832
l haven't incurred any loss.

428
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:27,304
Look.

429
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:32,612
What's he doing?
- What..

430
00:24:32,946 --> 00:24:34,846
Everything's lost, Kanji.

431
00:24:35,616 --> 00:24:38,414
Only thing left is this Godrej safe.

432
00:25:03,277 --> 00:25:04,437
Rolex.

433
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,342
lt's a Rolex.
- Nah.

434
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,251
Mr. Dinesh. lsn't that
a Rolex watch you're wearing?

435
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,313
Must be worth 1.5 -2 lakhs.

436
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:18,919
lt's worth 10.

437
00:25:21,361 --> 00:25:22,623
Mr. Kanji.

438
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:25,331
l am sure you read the
terms and conditions..

439
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,889
..before reading the policy.

440
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:28,795
Not at all, sir.

441
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:32,566
Your officer asked me to
sign at the places marked..

442
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:33,799
..and l did so.

443
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:35,673
How irresponsible you are.

444
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:37,539
What happened, sir?

445
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:38,976
Your policy insures you against..

446
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,911
..accidents like theft, fire, fraud.

447
00:25:44,985 --> 00:25:46,782
Right. That's what we opted for.

448
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,681
But not against Act of God.

449
00:25:49,323 --> 00:25:50,483
Act of God?

450
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:53,884
See, it's written here clearly.

451
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:54,950
Conditions apply.

452
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:58,787
My glasses.. - ln the event of
loss or damage to the property..

453
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:02,426
..the insurance company
is not liable to pay..

454
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:08,468
..any amount if the damage
is caused by act of God.

455
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:11,471
And here are your signatures.

456
00:26:12,512 --> 00:26:15,481
lt's written in such small letters.

457
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:16,948
And nobody reads that.

458
00:26:17,551 --> 00:26:19,280
What is 'Act of God'?

459
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,283
lncidents that are
not caused by humans.

460
00:26:22,823 --> 00:26:26,759
Like?
- Like earthquake, Tsunami, Thunder.

461
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:30,291
You cannot claim
insurance in such cases.

462
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,261
Because these are natural calamities.

463
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,596
But l don't believe in God.

464
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:34,827
Tell him.

465
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:37,360
l don't care if you do or don't.

466
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:39,295
You're signatures are right here.

467
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,467
l am so sorry.

468
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:43,809
Sorry? What sorry?

469
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,335
Sir.

470
00:26:45,412 --> 00:26:47,607
Sir, l've invested my
entire earnings in the shop.

471
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,774
Even my house is mortgaged.

472
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:49,781
And you're saying sorry.

473
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,512
l know, but your
claim cannot be approved.

474
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,410
You may go now.

475
00:26:58,025 --> 00:27:02,519
No, sir. l won't leave
until my claim isn't approved.

476
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,320
Security.

477
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:06,957
Sir..

478
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:08,258
Sir, why are you calling security?

479
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,860
l'm talking to you decently.
- Yes, sir.

480
00:27:10,938 --> 00:27:12,565
Take him away, please.
- Why call the security..

481
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:14,368
Come on.
- Just a minute.

482
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:15,567
Just a minute.

483
00:27:15,642 --> 00:27:16,574
Come on.

484
00:27:16,643 --> 00:27:18,440
You just know how to
swindle our money.

485
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:19,609
Mind your language.

486
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:21,738
You should be publicly beaten.

487
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:22,941
Throw him out.

488
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,342
Get out! Get out!

489
00:27:25,953 --> 00:27:29,855
You get this for
2000 in the flea market.

490
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:33,756
Don't you understand?

491
00:27:33,827 --> 00:27:34,953
lt's Act of God.

492
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:36,453
You want money, don't you?

493
00:27:36,496 --> 00:27:37,963
Go and ask God. Take him away.

494
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:39,323
Act of God.

495
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:43,395
Just a second. Just a second.

496
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,767
Leave me.

497
00:27:45,472 --> 00:27:46,871
Act of God.

498
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:49,768
So, you believe in God.
- Yes.

499
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:53,470
You believe that God
is present everywhere.

500
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,940
ln him, him, that madam, him.

501
00:27:57,517 --> 00:27:58,882
God dwells in everyone.
- Yes.

502
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,011
And me?

503
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,784
Mr. Dinesh, you believe
that God dwells in me too.

504
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:05,288
Yes.

505
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,383
Thank you.

506
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,859
Act of God. l didn't do it.

507
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:09,259
God did. lt's 'Act of God'.

508
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,727
God slapped him again.

509
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:12,890
l didn't do it.

510
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,932
And now God will shoot you..

511
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,262
And you will die.

512
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:20,967
Later, will your
family get the claim..

513
00:28:21,274 --> 00:28:22,764
..or will that be
'Act of God' as well?

514
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,675
Tell me.
- No.

515
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:25,837
Kanji, what are you doing?

516
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,709
Why are you scared? Take the gun.

517
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:30,807
Get down now, come on.

518
00:28:51,972 --> 00:28:54,532
The phone's ringing again.

519
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:55,864
Forget it.

520
00:28:56,743 --> 00:28:58,335
You switched of your mobile..

521
00:28:58,412 --> 00:29:00,380
..that's why they're
calling on the landline now.

522
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,381
Tell them l am not at home.

523
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:05,647
They say if we don't
arrange for the money..

524
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,420
..we'll have to vacate
the house in a month.

525
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,392
l had so many dreams.

526
00:29:15,562 --> 00:29:17,496
l wanted to make Jigna a pilot.

527
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:19,323
And my son a cricketer.

528
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,735
But soon l'll even lose this house.

529
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:27,498
Everything's lost.

530
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,738
Everything will be fine.

531
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:34,279
What will be fine?

532
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,306
All l have is the shop property.

533
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,649
l'll sell that and repay the mortgage.

534
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:45,815
''Om Jai Jagdish Hare.''

535
00:29:46,293 --> 00:29:48,352
''Swami..''

536
00:29:49,463 --> 00:29:51,397
Yes. Yes, he's here.

537
00:29:52,432 --> 00:29:53,831
lt's Nimish.
- Who?

538
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,391
Who Nimish bhai?
- The estate agent.

539
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,404
Oh yes.

540
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:02,570
Yes, Nimish. Go ahead.

541
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,472
Did you find a buyer
for that property?

542
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:13,544
What are you saying?

543
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,644
What happened?

544
00:30:14,721 --> 00:30:15,949
What happened?

545
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:20,589
He's saying, there are
broken idols of God on that land..

546
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,957
..so it's become inauspicious.

547
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,327
The place has become cursed.
- Oh, God!

548
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,965
No one will buy this land..

549
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,864
..that's the rumour in the market.

550
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:33,463
Nimish. 100 years later,
when people find..

551
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,772
..idols of God under that land,
the prices will shoot up by 4 times.

552
00:30:38,345 --> 00:30:39,312
Four times.

553
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:42,372
And people will
construct a temple there as well.

554
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:43,913
lf anyone wants the
buy the land he can..

555
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:45,315
..otherwise l care a damn.

556
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:47,681
What now?

557
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:59,596
l've an idea.

558
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:02,301
What are you doing, Kanji?

559
00:31:02,335 --> 00:31:03,393
Suicide!

560
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,994
Sister-in-law, suicide..

561
00:31:05,305 --> 00:31:06,863
Papa.
- kahan kahan?

562
00:31:07,507 --> 00:31:08,405
Leave me.

563
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:09,874
What are you doing?
- Papa..

564
00:31:09,976 --> 00:31:11,443
l am not a coward.

565
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:16,578
l will file a case.

566
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:19,511
Have you lost it?

567
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,487
He's gone crazy.

568
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,288
You will file a case
against an insurance company..

569
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:27,452
..worth 3000 crores!

570
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,355
l'm sure there are
many others like you..

571
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,022
..who have filed a case
against the insurance company.

572
00:31:32,632 --> 00:31:35,965
There must be others like me
who might have filed a case..

573
00:31:36,703 --> 00:31:40,867
..but no ever filed a
case against your Kishen.

574
00:31:43,843 --> 00:31:48,871
l...will...file a
case against your God.

575
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,314
What are you doing?

576
00:31:50,483 --> 00:31:54,715
''Who controls this world?''

577
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:03,522
''Who's that sitting
high up in the sky?''

578
00:32:04,431 --> 00:32:11,701
''Why are You hiding
behind the clouds?''

579
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:17,439
''Why are You afraid of being seen?''

580
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,670
Kanji.
- Yes.

581
00:32:18,745 --> 00:32:20,372
How will you fight the case?

582
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:21,641
That's simple.

583
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:22,773
lf your Lord can
appear in the temple..

584
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:28,287
..from 9-12 and 4-7,
then he's free from 12-4.

585
00:32:28,355 --> 00:32:30,016
He can appear in the
court at that time.

586
00:32:32,726 --> 00:32:33,658
What do you need? Tell me.

587
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:35,285
Agreement,
affidavit, anything you need.

588
00:32:35,362 --> 00:32:36,795
l will make it. Come with me.

Just tell me what you need?

591
00:32:43,036 --> 00:32:44,594
High contacts?
- Yes.

592

- Come with me.

593
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:49,364
Come on.

594
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,701
So, who do you want to
serve the notice to?

595
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,806
'Bhagwan' (God).

596
00:32:55,615 --> 00:32:58,311
So, Mr. Bhagwan

597
00:32:58,385 --> 00:32:59,545

598
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:02,377

He must have a last name?

600
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,384
Sharma, Verma, Kapoor,
Khanna, Desai, anything.

601
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:10,452
Don't know, because we haven't met.

602
00:33:10,997 --> 00:33:11,986
l see.

603
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:13,994
No.
- You two haven't met?

604
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:16,326
No.
- That's fine.

605
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,002
What's his crime? Crime.

606
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:20,432
He has ruined me.

607
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:23,635
What? You just said
you two haven't met.

608
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,541
This Mr. Bhagwan must live somewhere.

609
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:27,637
Resident?
- Who do l send the notice too?

610
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,542
People say that He lives in temples.

611
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:31,345
l see...

612
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,779

613
00:33:34,287 --> 00:33:36,278
Which 'Bhagwan' are
you talking about? - Sit.

614
00:33:36,323 --> 00:33:38,348
He has many names,
which ones should l say?

615
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:41,326
Krishna, Ram, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh.

616
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:42,961
Sai Baba.
- lt's a sin.

617
00:33:43,463 --> 00:33:44,794
Hanumanji. Balaji...

618
00:33:44,864 --> 00:33:45,956
And ladies too.

619
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:49,325
Durga, Saraswati, Parvati, Santoshi.

620
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,630
You've lost your mind!

621
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,496
Wasting my time.

622
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,903
Get lost. Come on.

623
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,799
Mad man.

624
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:58,036
The nerve he has. Come on.

625
00:34:01,314 --> 00:34:02,804
Don't trouble me.

626
00:34:02,882 --> 00:34:04,440
Leave me alone.

627
00:34:04,718 --> 00:34:06,345
Go to someone else.

628
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,681
l plead you.

629
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,951
Wait a minute, l'm a Hindu.

630
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:14,454
''Hari Bol. Speak now,
reveal the secrets.''

631
00:34:16,496 --> 00:34:18,691
The person we're going to
see now is a famed lawyer.

632
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:21,732
lf he says yes, our job will be done.

633
00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:24,431
Yes, sir. Which floor?

634
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:25,732
Lift's out of order?

635
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,432
11th floor.

636
00:34:27,874 --> 00:34:29,705

637
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,505
l'll be right back.
- Come on.

638
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,442
''He's witty, sells lies.''

639
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:40,282
''Kanji's cleverness
is known everywhere.''

640
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,324
''He's witty, sells lies.''

641
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:54,856
''Kanji's cleverness
is known everywhere.''

642
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:56,763
''He locked horns with God.''

643
00:34:56,836 --> 00:34:58,633
''And invited trouble for himself.''

644
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:00,502
''He always speaks the truth.''

645
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:01,767
''His honesty is unique.''

646
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:03,331
Mr. Lawyer.
- Yes.

647
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:11,645
Religious.

648
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,651
Kanji.
- Go back, we're at the wrong place.

649
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,257
Are you with him?

650
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,258
Stop, stop.

651
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:32,400
Excuse me, where does
advocate Hanif Qureshi live?

652
00:35:32,472 --> 00:35:33,769
Up ahead.

653
00:35:39,979 --> 00:35:42,573
ls Hanif at home?
- Yes.

654
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,448
Come. Father's inside.

655
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,452
Hello.

656
00:35:57,497 --> 00:35:58,828
You seem to be in trouble.

657
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,469
ln the last riots,
l defended some innocent Hindus.

658
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,936
And my own people did this to me.

659
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:12,808
Father cannot walk.

660
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:18,682
But you want to fight..

661
00:36:18,918 --> 00:36:21,614
..with the One who
created your entire community.

662
00:36:24,424 --> 00:36:25,618
Will you flee?

663
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,726
l've no other option left.

664
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,592
l won't run.

665
00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:34,429
Look, l cannot fight your
case in this condition..

666
00:36:35,335 --> 00:36:39,465
..but if the lawyers
refuse to take up your case..

667
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,436
..then according to the law
you can defend your own case.

668
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,001
ls that possible?
- Yes, there's a provision in the law.

669
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:51,417
lf you want l can
prepare your legal notice.

670
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,549
l'll be grateful to you, Hanif.

671
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,824
Hanif. Do you believe in Allah?

672
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:02,754
Of course.

673
00:37:03,396 --> 00:37:05,660
God, Allah, they are all the same.

674
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:09,263
So, l am fighting against Him.

675
00:37:09,736 --> 00:37:11,499
So, why are you helping me?

676
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:14,434
You're not the only pleader.

677
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,568
Everyone does.

678
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,871
Some pleads to Him,
and some against Him.

679
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:24,881
Where do you want to send this notice?

680
00:37:27,887 --> 00:37:29,912
l don't have his...
- Address.

681
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:31,917
No.
- Then.

682
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:34,991
The judge will dismiss your
case in the first hearing.

683
00:37:35,495 --> 00:37:37,292
l mean, l don't have His address..

684
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,959
..but of the places
where people look for Him.

685
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,605
''You're our benefactor, our friend.''

686
00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:48,300
''So scare us.''

687
00:37:48,374 --> 00:37:51,901
''Why ruin our present,
by telling us about an unknown future.''

688
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:01,284
''You're our benefactor, our friend.''

689
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:06,714
''Why ruin our present,
by telling us about an unknown future.''

690
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:10,456
''They put a price tag on you.''

691
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:14,523
''What's money got to do in devotion?''

692
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:21,431
''Hari Bol.''

693
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,408
''Speak now, reveal the secrets.''

694
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:25,601
''Speak up.''

695
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,738
''Hari Bol.''

696
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:30,815
''Speak now, reveal the secrets.''

697
00:38:30,883 --> 00:38:32,942
Hello. Relax, just relax.

698
00:38:33,386 --> 00:38:34,819
The shop in flea market..

699
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:36,479
..which collapsed a few days
ago due to the earthquake..

700
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:38,387
..the owner of that shop,
Kanji Lalji Mehta..

701
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,755
..has filed a case against God.

702
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:42,554
This is the reaction of
people over the matter.

703
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:44,457
Down with..
- Kanji!

704
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:45,657
Just relax.

705
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:48,526
This case won't be
accepted in the court.

706
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:49,962
Trust me.

707
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:51,497
Just leave it to me.

708
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:54,532
You won't even have
to come to the court.

709
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,667
Relax.

710
00:39:07,654 --> 00:39:09,554
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

711
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:11,681
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

712
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,250
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

713
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:16,585
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

714
00:39:16,763 --> 00:39:18,697
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

715
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:20,933
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

716
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:23,358
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

717
00:39:23,436 --> 00:39:24,403
Glory to..
- Leeladhar Maharaj!

718
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,630
Greetings.

719
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:30,231
l feel we should
meet that person once..

720
00:39:30,276 --> 00:39:32,938
..and listen to his problems,
and try to understand.

721
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:36,448
Well, l..

722
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:52,756
Although we all hold
different positions..

723
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:54,323
..in different communities.

724
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,331
But our God is one.

725
00:39:58,404 --> 00:39:59,666
Later.

726
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:04,642
And today, a human
has accused our God.

727
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,739
This is not a personal war.

728
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:11,908
lnstead, it's a
battle for all humans..

729
00:40:11,984 --> 00:40:14,475
..who have faith in God.

730
00:40:15,354 --> 00:40:18,949
So l've decided that l,
Siddeshwar Maharaj..

731
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:21,994
..and Gopi Maiyya,
will go to the court..

732
00:40:22,662 --> 00:40:27,861
..to give that shameless
human a fitting reply.

733
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:32,561
Down with..
- Kanji!

734
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,702
Yes, it's a democracy, where
everyone is treated equally.

735
00:40:36,776 --> 00:40:38,334
And now, even God.

736
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:41,580
Even God will have to stand in
the High Court's witness box..

737
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,547
..where the most dangerous
criminals stand for trial.

738
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:45,013
Strange, but true.

739
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,980
l still say, think about it once.

740
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,917
l already have.

741
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:53,518
Today's the first hearing..

742
00:40:53,593 --> 00:40:55,060
..and the judge will decide whether..

743
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:57,420
..such a case can be accepted or not.

744
00:41:13,813 --> 00:41:14,939
lt's a good omen.

745
00:41:16,582 --> 00:41:17,776
Really nice. Let's go.

746
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,451
Many believers are standing outside
the court shouting slogans against Kanji.

747
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,016
Down with..
- Kanji!

748
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:29,726
Down with..
- Kanji!

749
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:31,626
Down with..
- Kanji!

750
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,392
Down with..
- Kanji!

751
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,330
Down with..
- Kanji!

752
00:41:35,501 --> 00:41:38,664
Many 'dharma gurus'
have come to the court..

753
00:41:38,738 --> 00:41:40,672
..to give a reply of
Kanji's baseless allegations.

754
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,732
Very few people have been
allowed in the courtroom as well.

755
00:41:44,076 --> 00:41:45,634
Swami, give me your blessings.

756
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,378
Move aside, no one
will touch the swami.

757
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:50,745
Move aside, move aside.

758
00:41:51,484 --> 00:41:52,974
Down with..
- Kanji!

759
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,747
Down with..
- Kanji!

760
00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:57,379
Down with..
- Kanji!

761
00:41:57,456 --> 00:41:58,980
Down with..
- Kanji!

762
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:00,723
Down with..
- Kanji!

763
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:03,522
Down with..
- Kanji!

764
00:42:03,596 --> 00:42:06,997
Kanji, people say you're
doing this for publicity?

765
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,892
Down with..
- Kanji!

766
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:10,663
Down with..
- Kanji!

767
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,635
Down with..
- Kanji!

768
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:20,677
- You? - You will sit here.

769
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:23,441
Sit, sit.

770
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,909
Hey insurance..

771
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,557
How's the Rolex?

772
00:42:31,891 --> 00:42:33,324
Working fine.

773
00:42:33,392 --> 00:42:34,381
Relax.

774
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:38,791
Relax.

775
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:42,028
He's the one who spread the
rumour about God eating butter.

776
00:42:48,507 --> 00:42:49,633
All rise.

777
00:42:52,678 --> 00:42:54,339
Kanji, get up.

778
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:15,558
Mr. Kanji Lalji Mehta.
- Yes, sir.

779
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,601
We've been informed that
you'll defend your own case.

780
00:43:19,672 --> 00:43:20,934
Yes..

781
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:24,300
l don't have any other option,
Your Honour.

782
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:26,809
The other lawyers are scared.

783
00:43:26,879 --> 00:43:29,712
So, l'll have to defend this case..

784
00:43:29,782 --> 00:43:31,306
My lordship, this is
a baseless appeal.

785
00:43:32,285 --> 00:43:33,479
A publicity stunt.

786
00:43:33,886 --> 00:43:36,320
There's no cause of action
that can be proved in court.

787
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:41,350
So l suggest, under
order 7 rule no.11..

788
00:43:41,527 --> 00:43:42,926
..of the code of civil procedure.

789
00:43:43,462 --> 00:43:45,521
This case be straightaway dismissed..

790
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,560
..for out of cause action.

791
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:52,537
Your Honour, my
English isn't that good..

792
00:43:52,605 --> 00:43:55,574
..but l do
understand that he's asking..

793
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:57,472
..to shut down this case immediately.

794
00:43:57,543 --> 00:43:58,942
Right? You're right.

795
00:43:59,578 --> 00:44:01,603
l don't want to get into
this hassle in the first place.

796
00:44:01,948 --> 00:44:03,711
l'm a Gujarati, businessman.

797
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,317
Whether the Lord exists or not,
doesn't make a difference to me.

798
00:44:07,386 --> 00:44:08,751
The insurance people said that..

799
00:44:08,821 --> 00:44:10,721
..God has razed down my shop.

800
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,849
Or, he's the One behind
your shop's destruction.

801
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:15,257
So, l said fine. Ask God
to compensate for my losses.

802
00:44:15,294 --> 00:44:15,988
Case closed.

803
00:44:16,295 --> 00:44:17,956
But why will God raze down your shop?

804
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:21,366
Fool!

805
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,594
Please.

806
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,466
Please come to the
witness box and speak.

807
00:44:30,977 --> 00:44:33,537
May Lord forgive his naiveness.

808
00:44:35,014 --> 00:44:37,608
May Lord forgive his naiveness.

809
00:44:38,517 --> 00:44:41,281
May Lord forgive his naiveness.

810
00:44:41,454 --> 00:44:43,388
Why will God raze down my shop?

811
00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:47,316
Exactly,
why will God raze down my shop?

812
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,285
He has other important things to do.

813
00:44:50,763 --> 00:44:53,527
So, tell the
insurance company to pay me.

814
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:54,990
End of matter.

815
00:44:55,301 --> 00:44:57,360
Why will the
insurance company pay you?

816
00:44:57,536 --> 00:44:59,333
You've agreed to the
terms and conditions..

817
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,497
..of the insurance company.

818
00:45:00,806 --> 00:45:01,704
Exhibit no.1, sir.

819
00:45:01,774 --> 00:45:04,436
Right. Then God will
have to compensate for it.

820
00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:07,609
Call upon, Lord Ram, Shiva, Ganpati..

821
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,272
..Whoever you get along better with.

822
00:45:09,348 --> 00:45:12,408
Do some of your hocus-pocus, or..
- Fool!

823
00:45:13,853 --> 00:45:16,651
The only way to find
God is through salvation.

824
00:45:17,523 --> 00:45:20,356
God won't descend down on earth..

825
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,291
..for a ordinary man like you.

826
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:25,422
He would only if He exists.

827
00:45:26,966 --> 00:45:30,868
You're turnover is in millions,
and this is a small settlement.

828
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:31,766
Just say yes.

829
00:45:31,837 --> 00:45:34,965
l will even give you
cash discount. Really.

830
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,975
l object, Your Honour.

831
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:44,576
Mr. Kanji is calling
service to God a business.

832
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,847
Of course it's business.

833
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,418
Take a visit to any religious place.

834
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:52,320
First you've to pay for parking.

835
00:45:52,391 --> 00:45:55,485
Then, pay for standing
in the smaller queue.

836
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:58,496
Then pay for the flowers,
blanket, candle.

837
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,861
And the donation box is
kept right before the idol.

838
00:46:00,933 --> 00:46:02,798
As soon as you bow down,
you've to put something in it.

839
00:46:02,868 --> 00:46:05,962
And they even charge
for the offerings of God.

840
00:46:06,605 --> 00:46:10,598
Just like we're charged for
seeing wax statues in the museum.

841
00:46:10,676 --> 00:46:14,271
Similarly, they charge us for
seeing the stone idols in temples.

842
00:46:15,448 --> 00:46:17,279
And the priests have salaries as well.

843
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:18,680
His is less, and his is more.

844
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:20,719
And you even have income tax benefits.

845
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,387
Right?

846
00:46:22,721 --> 00:46:24,416
So, where's the service?

847
00:46:24,457 --> 00:46:28,393
And, Your Honour, there's
never recession in this business.

848
00:46:28,461 --> 00:46:29,325
No.

849
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:31,556
ln fact, they do better
business during recession.

850
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,598
''Oh, God! Oh my, God!''

851
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,330
Relax.

852
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:36,993
Consider that it is a business.

853
00:46:37,536 --> 00:46:38,867
Still, why are you
asking them for compensation?

854
00:46:39,705 --> 00:46:41,002
You pay premiums for your insurance..

855
00:46:41,307 --> 00:46:42,740
..so you can ask
them for a compensation.

856
00:46:42,908 --> 00:46:44,500
But why will the temple pay you?

857
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:49,371
Because...l've paid premiums
in their temples as well. - What?

858
00:46:49,648 --> 00:46:50,740
What nonsense?

859
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:53,908
l knew you won't believe me..

860
00:46:53,986 --> 00:46:57,581
..so l have brought
all the proofs along.

861
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,759
Look. These are the
receipts of the premium..

862
00:47:00,826 --> 00:47:03,260
..l've been paying
for the last 18 years.

863
00:47:03,762 --> 00:47:05,320
On my wife's advice.

864
00:47:05,498 --> 00:47:06,487
Look.

865
00:47:06,565 --> 00:47:09,329
My first premium was for 1501 rupees..

866
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:12,967
There's a well-known temple
in the South. l paid it there.

867
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:17,633
Then, l've been paying
1000 rupees every year..

868
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,405
..at Lord Ganesha's stall.

869
00:47:19,478 --> 00:47:21,537
lt's called a mandap.

870
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:26,442
And, your honour, my
mother-in-law used to be very sick.

871
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:30,353
So, the temple
authorities said, ''Pay us 11,000..''

872
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,319
''..perform a veneration
and watch the miracle''.

873
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,989
We performed the veneration
and my mother-in-law passed away.

874
00:47:36,295 --> 00:47:38,490
That was a good thing,
but l also lost 11,000.

875
00:47:39,298 --> 00:47:41,596
And they didn't refund a single rupee.

876
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,627
And then, donation at the mosque..

877
00:47:44,703 --> 00:47:47,831
..blanket at the shrine,
candle at church, alms for beggar..

878
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,375
..incense sticks,
veil for Mother Goddess.

879
00:47:50,676 --> 00:47:54,476
ln total l've paid around 10
lakhs in all these stores.

880
00:47:54,547 --> 00:47:55,980
Enough!

881
00:47:56,515 --> 00:47:57,675
Enough!

882
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:01,476
Don't call it a store.

883
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,549
lt's called a temple.

884
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:08,226
And people donate
willingly at the temple..

885
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,252
..for the peace and
prosperity of their family.

886
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,295
Even l gave this amount..

887
00:48:13,365 --> 00:48:15,492
..for the peace and
prosperity of my family.

888
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:17,665
And not for fun.

889
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,962
But your God snatched
all the peace from my life.

890
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,264
Because only God can
cause earthquakes.

891
00:48:23,642 --> 00:48:24,973
Humans cannot do it.

892
00:48:25,411 --> 00:48:28,278
So tell me, don't l've a right
to ask God for compensation?

893
00:48:28,347 --> 00:48:29,439
Mr. Kanji.

894
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:31,306
You've a tiff with God, don't you?
- Yes.

895
00:48:31,717 --> 00:48:33,344
So why don't you ask Him
directly for compensation?

896
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:34,545
Why are you asking the temples?

897
00:48:36,255 --> 00:48:41,249
Which company supplies
electricity to your home?

898
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,318
Reliance.
- Reliance.

899
00:48:43,395 --> 00:48:45,693
So if there's an
electricity problem in your home..

900
00:48:45,764 --> 00:48:47,891
..you will call up the
Reliance office, won't you?

901
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,334
You won't call Anil Ambani directly.

902
00:48:51,604 --> 00:48:54,767
Mr. Anil, we've a electricity problem.

903
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,502
Silence.

904
00:48:57,776 --> 00:48:58,970
What do you mean?

905
00:48:59,678 --> 00:49:00,702
What do you mean?

906
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,308
These priests, the saints
are officers of God. - No.

907
00:49:06,385 --> 00:49:07,943
They aren't officers.

908
00:49:08,354 --> 00:49:10,254
Officers are educated people.

909
00:49:10,756 --> 00:49:12,917
They are...

910
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,259
They are salesmen, Your Honour.

911
00:49:17,296 --> 00:49:18,786
They are collection agents..

912
00:49:18,864 --> 00:49:20,729
..because they own God's franchise.

913
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:22,426
Your Honour.

914
00:49:25,437 --> 00:49:27,371
This man's an atheist.

915
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:33,405
He doesn't know what he's saying.

916
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:37,815
But, we are saints.

917
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,711
We will forgive him.

918
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:46,515
But the world will never
forgive him for this grave sin.

919
00:49:46,558 --> 00:49:48,890
You won't be able to set
foot out of your house..

920
00:49:48,961 --> 00:49:51,361
..if you say anything else.

921
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,997
ls that your concern for me..

922
00:49:55,267 --> 00:49:57,497
..or are you threatening
me in front of the judge?

923
00:49:59,505 --> 00:50:02,531
We...are concerned for you.

924
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:04,667
They pay me up quickly.
End this matter.

925
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:06,734
My lord, this is enough.

926
00:50:06,912 --> 00:50:08,812
The donation receipts,
the submissions.

927
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:11,814
There's no agency agreement
between God and my clients.

928
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:14,580
Kanji is saying baseless things.

929
00:50:15,454 --> 00:50:18,423
We cannot file a case
against God for such a small thing.

930
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:19,548
Small?

931
00:50:20,693 --> 00:50:22,354
My lord, this isn't small issue.

932
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,624
That shop means everything to me.

933
00:50:25,297 --> 00:50:26,389
My means of earning.

934
00:50:26,465 --> 00:50:28,330
The only way to support my family.

935
00:50:29,034 --> 00:50:32,731
And l built that shop with hard work.

936
00:50:33,472 --> 00:50:35,963
Now, it's just a piece of land.

937
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,400
And no one's ready
to buy that as well.

938
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:41,778
These people say,
''Donate with faith..''

939
00:50:41,847 --> 00:50:43,644
''..and you'll never be wronged''.

940
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,719
And the insurance people say
''Pay your premiums on time..''

941
00:50:47,786 --> 00:50:48,980
''..we're there in
your troubled times''.

942
00:50:49,455 --> 00:50:52,515
l gave donations and
also paid my premiums.

943
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,559
But none of them are
willing to help me.

944
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:57,022
l am an ordinary human.

945
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:58,728
A middle-class man.

946
00:50:58,964 --> 00:51:00,056
My family, my wife and children..

947
00:51:00,332 --> 00:51:01,390
..will be forced to live on streets.

948
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:03,494
No, my lord.

949
00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:05,298
You'll have to give me a chance..

950
00:51:05,371 --> 00:51:06,861
..to defend my case in this court.

951
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:10,431
And the constituency of
lndia gives me the right..

952
00:51:10,509 --> 00:51:12,443
..to voice my plea in this court.

953
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,003
So please, my lord.

954
00:51:24,356 --> 00:51:29,919
One crore is a big amount
for a middle-class businessman.

955
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:33,798
And especially, when it's
a question of his survival.

956
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:41,896
So, the court accepts
Kanji Lalji Mehta's case.

957
00:51:47,946 --> 00:51:49,413
Silence.

958
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,474
And only after carefully examining..

959
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,681
..all the evidences and arguments..

960
00:51:55,754 --> 00:51:57,483
..the court will give
its verdict, whether..

961
00:51:57,556 --> 00:52:00,855
..Mr. Mr. Kanji Lal will
get his compensation or not.

962
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,393
And if he does, then who will pay him?

963
00:52:04,296 --> 00:52:07,356
The insurance company or, the temple.

964
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,765
The court's adjourned for the day.

965
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:19,509
Wait. Wait.

966
00:52:20,646 --> 00:52:24,377
You can perform all
the veneration you want..

967
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,345
..and ring those bells
as many times you wish.

968
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,321
Your God razed down my shop.

969
00:52:31,924 --> 00:52:35,451
And now, l will alone
shut down all his shops..

970
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:39,861
..or my name isn't Kanji Lalji Mehta.

971
00:52:40,432 --> 00:52:43,868
And this isn't my concern for you.

972
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,563
lt's a direct warning.

973
00:52:46,939 --> 00:52:48,372
Yes.

974
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:36,513
You're safe here,
it's a government property.

975
00:53:37,723 --> 00:53:39,657
But how will you escape them?

976
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:50,892
Down with..
- Kanji!

977
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:52,493
Down with..
- Kanji!

978
00:53:52,571 --> 00:53:54,004
Down with..
- Kanji!

979
00:53:54,339 --> 00:53:55,772
Down with..
- Kanji!

980
00:53:55,841 --> 00:53:57,638
Down with..
- Kanji!

981
00:53:57,709 --> 00:53:59,472
Down with..
- Kanji!

982
00:53:59,545 --> 00:54:01,445
Down with..
- Kanji!

983
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,241
Sir. The case has been accepted.

984
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,808
l'm worried about
Sushila and the children.

985
00:54:06,885 --> 00:54:07,783
l'll take a cab, you go.

986
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:09,821
But how can l leave you alone.

987
00:54:09,888 --> 00:54:12,288
l'm going to the police station,
for protection.

988
00:54:12,324 --> 00:54:13,655
Drop her home as well. Go.

989
00:54:14,326 --> 00:54:15,293
Be careful, dear.

990
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,260
Go, go, go.

991
00:54:17,763 --> 00:54:19,287
Are the boys ready?

992
00:54:22,701 --> 00:54:23,827
Remember.

993
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:28,261
Kanji shouldn't get to
see daylight. That's it.

994
00:54:30,709 --> 00:54:31,835
There he is.

995
00:54:32,744 --> 00:54:35,269
Catch him, beat him. Don't let him go.

996
00:54:38,283 --> 00:54:39,910
Wait, where are you running to?

997
00:54:57,536 --> 00:54:59,561
He's hiding there. Catch him.

998
00:54:59,638 --> 00:55:01,572
There he goes. Catch him.

999
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,906
Don't let him go.

1000
00:55:12,618 --> 00:55:14,552
''Go...go...go...Govinda.''

1001
00:55:15,621 --> 00:55:18,249
''Here comes Govinda...''

1002
00:55:19,825 --> 00:55:21,884
''Go...go...go...Govinda.''

1003
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,923
Don't let him go, catch him.

1004
00:55:27,265 --> 00:55:29,290
''Go...go...go...Govinda.''

1005
00:55:31,436 --> 00:55:32,528
Go that way.

1006
00:55:34,439 --> 00:55:36,498
''Go...go...go...Govinda.''

1007
00:55:53,792 --> 00:55:55,316
Let's sit down and talk.

1008
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:56,952
All l did was file a case.

1009
00:55:57,429 --> 00:55:59,727
lf you try to talk
they'll cut you in half.

1010
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,296
Look behind.

1011
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:02,628
Catch him.

1012
00:56:02,701 --> 00:56:04,225
Faster!

1013
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,728
Who are you?

1014
00:56:08,807 --> 00:56:10,536
Krishna Vasudev Yadav.

1015
00:56:10,776 --> 00:56:11,743
What?

1016
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:14,745
Krishna Vasudev Yadav from Gokul.

1017
00:56:15,447 --> 00:56:16,778
So you're from UP.

1018
00:56:17,282 --> 00:56:19,682
You can call me Kanhaiyya.

1019
00:56:19,785 --> 00:56:20,809
Catch him.

1020
00:56:30,562 --> 00:56:32,689
Careful. Careful.

1021
00:56:33,732 --> 00:56:35,927
Careful, slow down.

1022
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,625
Slow down.

1023
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,382
Are you a man or a stuntman?

1024
00:56:51,683 --> 00:56:53,446
You can call me a stuntman as well.

1025
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:56,447
But people call my stunts a miracle.

1026
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,923
Miracle.
- Hold on.

1027
00:56:59,524 --> 00:57:01,458
You aren't wearing a helmet either.

1028
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,820
There he is.

1029
00:57:10,435 --> 00:57:12,266
Don't go this way, go that way.

1030
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,566
Down, down, down, drive on the road.

1031
00:57:29,554 --> 00:57:32,284
Faster!
- ''Go...go...go...Govinda.''

1032
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:35,790
That was a narrow escape.

1033
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:38,554
Now, take me to Brahmanwadi.

1034
00:57:39,898 --> 00:57:45,359
Go straight then take a left,
then right and another left.

1035
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:46,997
And you'll be home, go on.

1036
00:57:47,773 --> 00:57:50,264
You brought me this far,
so drop me home as well.

1037
00:57:50,308 --> 00:57:51,673
My job's to show the way..

1038
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:53,404
..it's your job to
get to the destination.

1039
00:57:55,914 --> 00:57:56,938
Fine.

1040
00:57:58,884 --> 00:58:00,511
Keep it. Thank you so much.

1041
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,516
You're so kind.
- Thank you.

1042
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:05,247
Take care. ''Go...go...go...Govinda.''

1043
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:17,497
Papa!
- Sushila.

1044
00:58:17,936 --> 00:58:19,233
ls everything fine?

1045
00:58:20,272 --> 00:58:21,864
Go up and take a look in
the house, you'll know.

1046
00:58:22,574 --> 00:58:23,973
Thankfully we survived, otherwise..

1047
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:25,799
No, l'll talk to the police.

1048
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:26,673
Don't worry.

1049
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:31,478
They hurled stones and
acid bottles in our house.

1050
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,275
l don't care lf l die.

1051
00:58:34,352 --> 00:58:35,376
But the children.

1052
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:38,914
lf Jigna would've
been hit by that acid..

1053
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:40,582
l won't let anything happen to them.

1054
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:41,648
l am their father. Please.

1055
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,318
So, understand the duties of a father.

1056
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:45,295
Withdraw the case.
- You're a fool.

1057
00:58:45,964 --> 00:58:47,261
l'm about to lose my house.

1058
00:58:49,701 --> 00:58:50,895
Where will we stay?

1059
00:58:51,469 --> 00:58:53,767
On the streets, or in their house?

1060
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,398
Do we have any other option?

1061
00:58:56,508 --> 00:58:57,406
Why don't you understand?

1062
00:58:57,509 --> 00:58:59,272
Come on, Jigna. Sit in the car.

1063
00:58:59,644 --> 00:59:01,771
Come.
- He's made a mess of things.

1064
00:59:01,847 --> 00:59:03,508
l won't leave papa.

1065
00:59:04,716 --> 00:59:06,240
l'll slap you if you refuse.
- No, mother.

1066
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:08,218
Come on, sit inside.

1067
00:59:10,889 --> 00:59:11,913
Please..

1068
00:59:57,066 --> 00:59:58,124
Hello.

1069
00:59:59,001 --> 01:00:00,059
Hello.

1070
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,770
Who is it?
- Bhagwan (God).

1071
01:00:02,972 --> 01:00:04,462
What?

1072
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,970
lf you were a Muslim,
l would've said Allah.

1073
01:00:07,543 --> 01:00:09,568
lf you were a Christian,
then Jesus Christ.

1074
01:00:09,812 --> 01:00:12,212
You're a Hindu, so Krishna.

1075
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:19,486
You, here?

1076
01:00:20,856 --> 01:00:24,155
You're an excellent stuntman, really.

1077
01:00:24,226 --> 01:00:25,056
Very good.

1078
01:00:25,127 --> 01:00:27,118
l'm sure you're
acting is decent as well.

1079
01:00:27,796 --> 01:00:30,629
Why don't you approach
some television channel?

1080
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:35,159
They keep remaking
Ramayan and Mahabharat.

1081
01:00:35,738 --> 01:00:37,103
Krishna.

1082
01:00:38,908 --> 01:00:41,001
Suited-booted Krishna.

1083
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,043
Here to teach me a lesson.

1084
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,038
Look.

1085
01:00:46,615 --> 01:00:48,446
Look there.

1086
01:00:48,584 --> 01:00:50,484
Gods are bare-bodied.

1087
01:00:50,586 --> 01:00:51,814
Like this.

1088
01:00:52,454 --> 01:00:54,752
They're never fully covered.

1089
01:00:56,025 --> 01:00:57,754
That's your wedding photo, right?
- Yes.

1090
01:00:57,826 --> 01:00:59,054
Wearing that traditional attire.

1091
01:00:59,094 --> 01:01:01,494
So, did you only wear
a traditional attire..

1092
01:01:01,564 --> 01:01:02,724
..since your wedding?

1093
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:04,163
No, right?
- No.

1094
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,635
See. That's our older image.

1095
01:01:07,903 --> 01:01:10,098
Conch in one hand, mace in the other.

1096
01:01:10,172 --> 01:01:11,867
Where are yours?

1097
01:01:11,941 --> 01:01:15,001
lf l keep holding them all day,
won't my arms hurt?

1098
01:01:17,813 --> 01:01:18,973
Think.

1099
01:01:19,048 --> 01:01:21,846
Actually, our latest photos
haven't been updated on Facebook.

1100
01:01:22,484 --> 01:01:23,917
People still use the
older ones, and we let them.

1101
01:01:23,986 --> 01:01:24,953
We don't have a problem.

1102
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,954
- Let them. - That's enough.

1103
01:01:27,156 --> 01:01:29,590
You're boring me now. Get out, leave.

1104
01:01:32,528 --> 01:01:33,893
Mahadev!

1105
01:01:34,697 --> 01:01:39,066
- Mahadev! - Only you
can hear and see me.

1106
01:01:39,535 --> 01:01:41,503
Yes, coming. Coming.

1107
01:01:45,941 --> 01:01:46,908
Mahadev!

1108
01:01:46,942 --> 01:01:48,432
What happened? What happened, Kanji?

1109
01:01:48,978 --> 01:01:49,876
See him.

1110
01:01:49,912 --> 01:01:51,777
He calls himself God.

1111
01:01:52,681 --> 01:01:53,807
l can see him.

1112
01:01:54,049 --> 01:01:55,448
He can see you.

1113
01:01:55,517 --> 01:01:58,486
My name's Krishna, your new neighbour.

1114
01:01:59,154 --> 01:02:00,644
Neighbour?

1115
01:02:01,457 --> 01:02:02,617
Neighbour?

1116
01:02:02,658 --> 01:02:04,990
The person Kanji had
mortgaged his house to..

1117
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,584
..has sold it to me.

1118
01:02:07,963 --> 01:02:09,157
Here are the documents.

1119
01:02:12,601 --> 01:02:16,093
And, Kanji bhai, sorry
for that joke about God.

1120
01:02:18,107 --> 01:02:19,574
What's this?

1121
01:02:19,908 --> 01:02:22,035
How can he sell my house to him?

1122
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:23,976
l was about to pay him on time.

1123
01:02:24,046 --> 01:02:25,035
l already paid him.

1124
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,479
This isn't done.

1125
01:02:26,582 --> 01:02:27,742
This is my house.
Nobody can just buy it.

1126
01:02:27,816 --> 01:02:30,148
Relax. Chill.

1127
01:02:30,753 --> 01:02:33,813
When you get your
compensation from God..

1128
01:02:33,889 --> 01:02:37,757
..you can repay me, l will leave.

1129
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:40,785
And anyway, l always leave
after my project is over.

1130
01:02:40,863 --> 01:02:44,094
Why buy the house
when you want to leave?

1131
01:02:44,633 --> 01:02:45,725
Are you a agent?

1132
01:02:47,703 --> 01:02:49,102
l am not that low.

1133
01:02:49,505 --> 01:02:50,836
l've a consultancy firm.

1134
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,533
l give advice to people.
- Advice.

1135
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:55,600
Anyone who thinks of me.

1136
01:02:55,678 --> 01:02:57,475
Public service. Service open to all.

1137
01:02:57,913 --> 01:03:00,074
A solution to every problem.

1138
01:03:00,749 --> 01:03:03,115
Sometimes it gets slightly delayed.

1139
01:03:03,185 --> 01:03:04,982
But...l always get there on time.

1140
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:06,818
There's delay but not denial.

1141
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:09,016
Just like l came here,
to help Kanji bhai.

1142
01:03:09,692 --> 01:03:10,716
Help me?

1143
01:03:10,793 --> 01:03:12,055
l found out about your condition..

1144
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,754
..only after l brought the house.

1145
01:03:14,763 --> 01:03:15,889
The court case, lost your shop..

1146
01:03:15,964 --> 01:03:17,158
..and your wife and children too.

1147
01:03:17,466 --> 01:03:19,491
Kanji bhai, don't worry.

1148
01:03:19,702 --> 01:03:20,930
You can stay here.

1149
01:03:21,804 --> 01:03:24,534
ln return,
l will only use your things.

1150
01:03:24,673 --> 01:03:26,470
Television, fridge, etcetera.

1151
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:31,476
Fine, but remember..

1152
01:03:31,547 --> 01:03:33,606
..one day l will buy this
house back from you.

1153
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:34,875
So be it!

1154
01:03:35,584 --> 01:03:37,074
l mean, l promise.

1155
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,588
He's a nice man.
- Something you said.

1156
01:03:40,656 --> 01:03:42,624
No, just.. Cheers.

1157
01:03:44,426 --> 01:03:45,484
Calls himself God.

1158
01:03:45,561 --> 01:03:46,550
l think he's drunk.

1159
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:50,689
Thank you, for letting
me stay in my own house.

1160
01:03:50,933 --> 01:03:52,423
Thank you so much.

1161
01:03:53,602 --> 01:03:54,762
Thank you.

1162
01:03:55,938 --> 01:03:58,498
l will sleep outside on the terrace.

1163
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:00,466
And you can sleep wherever you want.

1164
01:04:00,509 --> 01:04:01,533
lt's your house.

1165
01:04:01,844 --> 01:04:03,471
Thank you. Goodnight.

1166
01:04:03,779 --> 01:04:05,838
And yes, the light
switch is at the back.

1167
01:04:05,948 --> 01:04:07,609
Switch off the lights
before you go to sleep.

1168
01:04:12,187 --> 01:04:13,677
Another power failure.

1169
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:19,051
No. you switched it off.
- No, l didn't.

1170
01:04:19,128 --> 01:04:20,186
You're drunk.

1171
01:04:20,462 --> 01:04:21,622
So?

1172
01:04:23,932 --> 01:04:25,160
l see.

1173
01:04:36,478 --> 01:04:39,003
''Go...go...go...Govinda.''

1174
01:04:43,585 --> 01:04:46,145
''Go...go...go...Govinda.''

1175
01:04:50,826 --> 01:04:52,987
''Go...go...go...Govinda.''

1176
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:19,987
Case on God admitted. Paper,
paper, paper.

1177
01:05:20,055 --> 01:05:21,784
High Court has put it's seal on it.

1178
01:05:28,497 --> 01:05:31,022
Through the notice prepared
by advocate Hanif Qureshi..

1179
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:33,897
..Kanji Lalji Mehta's case
on God has been accepted.

1180
01:05:34,002 --> 01:05:35,094
l think he's mad.

1181
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,501
Who is this guy?

1182
01:05:36,538 --> 01:05:37,630
Hey Jigna, what happened?

1183
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,138
See, his wife ran away.

1184
01:05:46,515 --> 01:05:47,982
Who can live with that madman?

1185
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:50,450
l don't even talk to him.

1186
01:05:50,485 --> 01:05:52,476
Or the Lord might punish us as well.

1187
01:05:57,459 --> 01:06:00,121
What a splendid bike.
- But, who is he?

1188
01:06:00,495 --> 01:06:02,019
l think he arrived just last night.

1189
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:07,067
Who's playing this classical music?

1190
01:06:07,169 --> 01:06:11,799
l've heard that the new
guest is really handsome.

1191
01:06:11,874 --> 01:06:13,842
Don't l look handsome?

1192
01:06:14,576 --> 01:06:15,668
Get inside.

1193
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:24,184
Hey, Hari Prasad.

1194
01:06:26,655 --> 01:06:27,952
Hey, Chaurasiya.

1195
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:30,487
What's all this?

1196
01:06:31,026 --> 01:06:32,493
l was waking up the birds!

1197
01:06:32,527 --> 01:06:33,687
What? Who?

1198
01:06:33,762 --> 01:06:35,457
l was waking up the birds!

1199
01:06:35,731 --> 01:06:37,562
Practice. l was practising.

1200
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,197
lt's a good thing to
do in the morning.

1201
01:06:39,501 --> 01:06:41,628
Don't do it.
Don't do all this in my house.

1202
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,773
lt's your house you can
play anything you want.

1203
01:06:46,441 --> 01:06:47,999
Good morning.
- What?

1204
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:50,442
Not me, there's a lady in your house.

1205
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:52,706
Hello.

1206
01:06:53,448 --> 01:06:54,574
Hello.

1207
01:06:54,616 --> 01:06:56,777
l brought breakfast.

1208
01:06:56,852 --> 01:06:58,979
l thought since sister-in-law isn't home,
so.. - No need.

1209
01:06:59,054 --> 01:07:00,749
l'll have bread and butter.

1210
01:07:03,158 --> 01:07:04,682
Where's the butter?

1211
01:07:05,594 --> 01:07:06,720
l ate it.

1212
01:07:09,965 --> 01:07:12,729
There was half a kilo of
butter in there, you ate it all.

1213
01:07:12,801 --> 01:07:14,962
lt's my favourite thing. So l ate it.

1214
01:07:15,137 --> 01:07:16,570
Tell me one thing.

1215
01:07:16,638 --> 01:07:18,538
Why do they make it so salty?

1216
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:20,599
Just like his name.

1217
01:07:21,944 --> 01:07:23,070
Are you all alone?

1218
01:07:23,145 --> 01:07:24,840
Your wife?
- Of course.

1219
01:07:25,013 --> 01:07:26,480
Sixteen thousand..
- What?

1220
01:07:26,515 --> 01:07:27,539
She lives in Sholapur.

1221
01:07:29,184 --> 01:07:31,744
What did you hear?
- Sixteen thousand.

1222
01:07:32,054 --> 01:07:34,579
No, she lives in Sholapur.

1223
01:07:34,823 --> 01:07:36,188
He can't handle one..

1224
01:07:36,491 --> 01:07:37,924
..how can l have sixteen thousand.

1225
01:07:37,993 --> 01:07:40,188
Please go. He's a big liar.

1226
01:07:40,495 --> 01:07:41,621
He was boring me yesterday.

1227
01:07:41,697 --> 01:07:43,927
- Please go.
- Give it.

1228
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:47,969
lf you eat all that
you'll get a stomach ache.

1229
01:07:48,036 --> 01:07:49,731
First half a kilo of
butter and now this.

1230
01:07:50,138 --> 01:07:51,628
l'll be fine.

1231
01:07:54,509 --> 01:07:56,773
- Hello.
- Sir, l'm speaking from ABP News.

1232
01:07:56,878 --> 01:07:58,778
l am standing below your house.

1233
01:07:59,982 --> 01:08:01,415
Sir.

1234
01:08:01,683 --> 01:08:04,584
Look, l don't want to be
a piece of news for you.

1235
01:08:05,087 --> 01:08:06,952
And don't call me again.

1236
01:08:07,656 --> 01:08:09,556
Sir, just one interview.

1237
01:08:09,758 --> 01:08:14,661
Since he filed a case
against God, he's become alone.

1238
01:08:17,032 --> 01:08:18,761
One has to tread on such a path alone.

1239
01:08:19,901 --> 01:08:22,802
Let's see how far our friend goes.

1240
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,702
The advocate who
prepared Kanji's notice.

1241
01:08:27,776 --> 01:08:29,471
He lives that way.

1242
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:31,479
Excuse me, advocate Hanif Qureshi.

1243
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:33,077
He lives right there.

1244
01:08:33,148 --> 01:08:35,639
Where does advocate
Hanif Qureshi live?

1245
01:08:35,717 --> 01:08:37,048
He lives right there.

1246
01:08:37,452 --> 01:08:39,511
Advocate Hanif Qureshi lives there.

1247
01:08:45,827 --> 01:08:48,796
155 letters, and calls too.

1248
01:08:49,464 --> 01:08:52,797
Bhuj, Latur, Vishakapatnam.

1249
01:08:53,468 --> 01:08:56,437
Their claims haven't been approved..

1250
01:08:56,505 --> 01:08:59,668
..for the past few years due to
'Act of God'.

1251
01:09:00,842 --> 01:09:04,903
All they all want you
to defend their cases.

1252
01:09:05,881 --> 01:09:10,750
Son, l've lost my house
in the earthquake.

1253
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:17,148
My son and his wife died too.

1254
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:22,792
This is my grandson.

1255
01:09:23,532 --> 01:09:26,000
His cancer needs to be operated.

1256
01:09:26,668 --> 01:09:30,934
lf l get the insurance money,
everything will be alright.

1257
01:09:31,907 --> 01:09:33,738
This is Aslam.

1258
01:09:33,775 --> 01:09:34,969
Hello.
- Hello.

1259
01:09:35,043 --> 01:09:37,068
He lost everything in the Tsunami.

1260
01:09:37,913 --> 01:09:42,179
He lost all the money he had
saved for his sister's marriage.

1261
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:45,552
So you file a case too.

1262
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,019
l'll be cast out..

1263
01:09:47,089 --> 01:09:51,082
..if l go against the
priest or community.

1264
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:53,684
Look, Aslam. You
aren't going against anyone.

1265
01:09:54,463 --> 01:09:58,661
Those who taught you religion,
taught you to pray..

1266
01:09:58,733 --> 01:10:03,033
..you're just questioning
them why Allah did this to you.

1267
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:06,974
But, the priest..
- Aslam.

1268
01:10:07,576 --> 01:10:10,204
When you lose your home..

1269
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:13,812
..will the priest let
you stay in his house?

1270
01:10:15,117 --> 01:10:19,577
Religion is for people,
people aren't made for religion.

1271
01:10:24,993 --> 01:10:29,123
Hanif, how long will it
take to ready their papers?

1272
01:10:29,798 --> 01:10:31,493
As long as it will take me to type.

1273
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:34,098
Let's begin.

1274
01:10:55,824 --> 01:10:58,759
First one crore, and now
claims worth 400 crores.

1275
01:10:58,827 --> 01:11:00,021
Kanji Mehta!

1276
01:11:00,662 --> 01:11:02,152
Advocate Sardesai is caught between..

1277
01:11:02,464 --> 01:11:04,523
..the insurance company
and religious organizations.

1278
01:11:04,599 --> 01:11:06,897
For God's sake, prove that God exists.

1279
01:11:06,968 --> 01:11:09,095
And...and...make God pay all this!

1280
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:12,663
The temples, mosques,
churches, they will pay everything.

1281
01:11:12,741 --> 01:11:13,935
Kanji.

1282
01:11:14,476 --> 01:11:16,137
Wasn't your fight with your God?

1283
01:11:16,211 --> 01:11:18,611
Silence please!
- So why call me here?

1284
01:11:18,847 --> 01:11:24,877
Priest, how can l say
which God of which religion..

1285
01:11:25,487 --> 01:11:28,854
..was behind this earthquake,
or that Tsunami?

1286
01:11:29,057 --> 01:11:30,786
That's your department.

1287
01:11:31,193 --> 01:11:34,560
Your Honour, they're in
constant touch with God.

1288
01:11:34,796 --> 01:11:36,491
They're always in contact.

1289
01:11:36,831 --> 01:11:40,699
Why don't you tell me
Who was responsible?

1290
01:11:40,769 --> 01:11:44,432
Why would our God harm
people of our own religion?

1291
01:11:44,673 --> 01:11:45,799
God will never do such a thing!

1292
01:11:45,874 --> 01:11:47,899
- Silence. - He loves his children!

1293
01:11:47,976 --> 01:11:50,171
Allah doesn't hate
his followers either!

1294
01:11:50,445 --> 01:11:52,037
- Relax. - Please be seated.

1295
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:58,949
The court needs some time
to study all these cases.

1296
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:03,821
Anyone related to this
case cannot leave the country.

1297
01:12:03,892 --> 01:12:04,916
What?

1298
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,152
Court is adjourned.

1299
01:12:06,595 --> 01:12:08,187
Long live..
- Kanji!

1300
01:12:08,463 --> 01:12:10,055
Long live..
- Kanji!

1301
01:12:10,131 --> 01:12:11,826
Long live..
- Kanji!

1302
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,458
Long live..
- Kanji!

1303
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:14,968
Long live..
- Kanji!

1304
01:12:15,036 --> 01:12:16,833
Long live..
- Kanji!

1305
01:12:16,871 --> 01:12:18,532
Long live..
- Kanji!

1306
01:12:18,607 --> 01:12:20,006
Long live..
- Kanji!

1307
01:12:20,075 --> 01:12:20,939
Long live..
- Kanji!

1308
01:12:21,009 --> 01:12:27,005
This is government property,
you're safe here.

1309
01:12:27,849 --> 01:12:35,881
But how will you escape them, in
temples, churches and mosques?

1310
01:12:55,176 --> 01:12:57,440
What are you thinking, Leeladhar?

1311
01:12:57,812 --> 01:13:00,474
This has gone beyond the limit.

1312
01:13:01,049 --> 01:13:06,681
Stop all the shams that you're
running in the name of faith.

1313
01:13:10,125 --> 01:13:11,956
Otherwise, the day isn't far when..

1314
01:13:12,027 --> 01:13:15,485
..no one will even spare
alms in the name of God.

1315
01:13:17,532 --> 01:13:18,726
Thank you.

1316
01:13:19,734 --> 01:13:22,897
You don't understand, Leeladhar..
- Thank you.

1317
01:13:46,027 --> 01:13:48,086
This is actually a serious matter.

1318
01:13:48,797 --> 01:13:50,890
People are making him a hero..

1319
01:13:50,965 --> 01:13:54,662
..and the claim amount is increasing.

1320
01:13:54,736 --> 01:13:57,102
Will you just tell us about
the problems or do something?

1321
01:13:58,573 --> 01:13:59,972
Next week,
l've a religious programme..

1322
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:01,838
..on the Star Cruise, in Singapore

1323
01:14:02,477 --> 01:14:04,741
And the judge says
l cannot leave the country.

1324
01:14:04,813 --> 01:14:06,747
Do something.
- l would.

1325
01:14:06,815 --> 01:14:08,908
But it's the court,
not the parliament..

1326
01:14:08,983 --> 01:14:11,884
..where we can break a few
chairs and the job's done.

1327
01:14:12,187 --> 01:14:13,711
lt's the court.

1328
01:14:14,022 --> 01:14:15,455
Let me think.

1329
01:14:15,924 --> 01:14:17,585
Well, there's one way.

1330
01:14:17,659 --> 01:14:18,785
l know it's an old idea..

1331
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,885
..but these days
it's a lot in fashion.

1332
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:23,625
Laxman Mishra guarantees..

1333
01:14:23,698 --> 01:14:25,461
..that you'll get
the sympathy of people.

1334
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,831
l guarantee it.

1335
01:14:27,135 --> 01:14:28,500
Thank you.

1336
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:31,998
Lord blessed us with everything.

1337
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:36,575
The earth, the air, water,
the flora, fauna, everything.

1338
01:14:37,912 --> 01:14:42,474
Did He ever ask us for service tax?
- No?

1339
01:14:42,717 --> 01:14:45,083
Did he ever ask us for sales tax?
- No.

1340
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:53,024
And today, a madman has
dragged Him to court..

1341
01:14:53,061 --> 01:14:56,087
..so, will we stay quiet?
- No.

1342
01:14:56,965 --> 01:14:58,091
We will fight.

1343
01:14:58,933 --> 01:15:00,457
We will fight together.

1344
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:06,699
And so, guiding us on
this path, our beloved..

1345
01:15:07,609 --> 01:15:15,641
..and revered Sri Siddeshwar
Maharaj will fast unto death.

1346
01:15:16,451 --> 01:15:18,476
He will go on a hunger strike.

1347
01:15:19,954 --> 01:15:22,582
Glory to..
- Siddeshwar Maharaj

1348
01:15:22,657 --> 01:15:26,650
Today's the third day of
Siddeshwar Maharaj's hunger strike.

1349
01:15:27,162 --> 01:15:29,130
Many religious
organizations and devotees..

1350
01:15:29,164 --> 01:15:33,533
..from different parts of the
country have supported this movement.

1351
01:15:33,902 --> 01:15:36,063
On the other hand, Kanji Lalji Mehta..

1352
01:15:36,137 --> 01:15:38,731
..has refused to talk to the media.

1353
01:15:39,007 --> 01:15:40,702
He won't take a sip of water.

1354
01:15:40,775 --> 01:15:42,003
He won't stop.

1355
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,941
He's an ascetic.

1356
01:15:44,145 --> 01:15:53,543
Repeat after me, Glory
to Ram, glory to Sita-Ram!

1357
01:16:04,799 --> 01:16:08,200
Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!

1358
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,768
Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!

1359
01:16:10,839 --> 01:16:13,137
And what does God say?

1360
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:16,135
Awaken the power of your devotion.

1361
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:20,641
And go tell Kanji, you
can do anything you want.

1362
01:16:20,849 --> 01:16:25,183
We will continue..

1363
01:16:25,687 --> 01:16:28,520
They're defaming me
taking Krishna's name.

1364
01:16:29,023 --> 01:16:30,581
Mine too.

1365
01:16:30,658 --> 01:16:31,989
What have you got to do with this?

1366
01:16:32,093 --> 01:16:33,492
l do.

1367
01:16:33,528 --> 01:16:36,497
When they're defaming you,
they're defaming me too.

1368
01:16:36,564 --> 01:16:37,758
You're my friend after all.

1369
01:16:38,633 --> 01:16:41,568
Look, Kanji bhai, it's
the era of publicity.

1370
01:16:41,736 --> 01:16:45,433
These imposters like to show off.

1371
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,970
l am fighting for my right,
that's all.

1372
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:52,046
And you will win this fight
only when you expose their lies..

1373
01:16:52,113 --> 01:16:56,072
..and that's possible only
when you speak to the people.

1374
01:16:56,985 --> 01:17:01,046
Even Krishna had to
enter the ring to kill Kans.

1375
01:17:01,623 --> 01:17:04,091
Enough of your fairytales.

1376
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,621
But l did understand one thing.

1377
01:17:08,796 --> 01:17:14,132
Now watch...
how l expose them and their God.

1378
01:17:16,638 --> 01:17:18,765
He's not going to spare me.

1379
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:25,445
Hello, and welcome to a
very special episode..

1380
01:17:25,513 --> 01:17:26,946
..of Oh My God!

1381
01:17:27,148 --> 01:17:28,911
Why is this episode special?

1382
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:31,711
Because Kanji Lalji Mehta..

1383
01:17:31,786 --> 01:17:36,655
..is finally here to
answer all your questions.

1384
01:17:38,459 --> 01:17:41,587
Many of you think
he's crazy and cynical.

1385
01:17:42,497 --> 01:17:45,898
He's the person
who...filed the case against God.

1386
01:17:46,968 --> 01:17:48,560
Kanji bhai, welcome to our show.

1387
01:17:48,636 --> 01:17:50,501
My first question is..

1388
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:52,829
Why are you after all
the religious sects?

1389
01:17:53,942 --> 01:17:55,739
You media personnel, l tell you..

1390
01:17:57,078 --> 01:18:00,013
Your questions sound
more like allegations..

1391
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:02,413
..and make us sound guilty.

1392
01:18:03,484 --> 01:18:06,578
l respect all religion
and don't believe in any.

1393
01:18:06,654 --> 01:18:08,121
This man will never change.

1394
01:18:08,423 --> 01:18:10,857
And if God exists, he will
answer all my questions.

1395
01:18:11,092 --> 01:18:13,686
Not just that, he will
support me in my fight.

1396
01:18:14,562 --> 01:18:15,756
How?

1397
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:21,030
When you were small, a small child.

1398
01:18:21,569 --> 01:18:24,732
What would you do to ask
your papa for chocolate?

1399
01:18:26,441 --> 01:18:28,602
l mean, would you chant his name.

1400
01:18:28,676 --> 01:18:30,541
''Papa, give me chocolates.''

1401
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:32,937
Or, did you venerate
him with incense sticks..

1402
01:18:33,014 --> 01:18:35,039
..or throw flowers...
- No, l didn't do any of that.

1403
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:38,451
l would directly ask him
whatever l wanted. - Exactly.

1404
01:18:38,519 --> 01:18:40,009
Exactly. l'm doing the same thing.

1405
01:18:40,588 --> 01:18:45,423
People have always told me,
that God is like a father-figure.

1406
01:18:45,493 --> 01:18:49,691
Maybe? But how can l believe,
as long as l don't see Him.

1407
01:18:49,797 --> 01:18:53,062
You're an atheist, how
can God appear before you?

1408
01:18:55,403 --> 01:18:56,597
Eat. Eat.

1409
01:18:57,772 --> 01:19:01,868
Kanji bhai, even l believe that
God's like a father-figure. - Yes.

1410
01:19:02,043 --> 01:19:03,840
So, will he appear before me?

1411
01:19:03,978 --> 01:19:05,969
Do you believe in temples,
idols etcetera?

1412
01:19:06,414 --> 01:19:09,076
Yes, l do.
- Then He won't.

1413
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:10,447
But why?

1414
01:19:10,518 --> 01:19:12,509
Because you're searching
for Him in temples and idols.

1415
01:19:12,687 --> 01:19:14,450
Then why does
He have to come personally?

1416
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:16,114
No, this is wrong.

1417
01:19:16,624 --> 01:19:17,886
God does exist.

1418
01:19:17,959 --> 01:19:19,824
l couldn't find a
decent job for two years.

1419
01:19:19,894 --> 01:19:23,660
l prayed that if l find a job,
l will shave my head.

1420
01:19:23,731 --> 01:19:25,562
And see, l found a job.

1421
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,659
Oh, you shaved off the entire thing.

1422
01:19:29,037 --> 01:19:30,527
Just imagine.

1423
01:19:30,705 --> 01:19:34,766
You're all dressed and
leaving for work in the morning..

1424
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:37,001
..and as soon as you open your door..

1425
01:19:37,078 --> 01:19:38,670
..you see a pile of hair.

1426
01:19:39,981 --> 01:19:43,075
Black hair, white hair,
some with dandruff.

1427
01:19:43,518 --> 01:19:44,746
Some have lice.

1428
01:19:45,687 --> 01:19:47,848
There's a pile of every kind of hair.

1429
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:50,013
Tell me how you will feel.

1430
01:19:50,091 --> 01:19:51,683
l won't like it at all.

1431
01:19:51,926 --> 01:19:54,793
lsn't it? So,
imagine how bad God feels.

1432
01:19:55,663 --> 01:19:57,961
God opens his door, and
there's hair scattered around.

1433
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:00,929
Kanji bhai always has the right logic.

1434
01:20:01,002 --> 01:20:02,697
Do you know what's
done with all these hairs?

1435
01:20:03,705 --> 01:20:06,503
They are sold.

1436
01:20:06,841 --> 01:20:10,174
These hairs are sold in America,
London, etcetera...

1437
01:20:10,511 --> 01:20:14,140
ln short, your faith is sold.

1438
01:20:14,549 --> 01:20:15,948
That's it.

1439
01:20:17,218 --> 01:20:18,242
He is right.

1440
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:20,180
He's got a point.

1441
01:20:20,722 --> 01:20:23,589
But that money is used to
run schools, orphanages..

1442
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:25,649
..hospitals, charitable trusts.

1443
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:26,921
Do you have a problem with that too?

1444
01:20:27,528 --> 01:20:30,691
lt's just like a tobacco
seller builds a cancer hospital.

1445
01:20:33,034 --> 01:20:34,797
They have to do these things, madam.

1446
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:37,034
Because all this is unaccounted money.

1447
01:20:37,505 --> 01:20:39,803
lf you don't show
any legal transaction..

1448
01:20:39,841 --> 01:20:42,207
..then the lncome Tax people
will put you behind bars.

1449
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:45,743
l've a problem with their
way of extracting the money.

1450
01:20:46,047 --> 01:20:48,709
Just like the mafia
scares us with a gun..

1451
01:20:48,783 --> 01:20:50,478
..these people scare us
in the name of the Lord.

1452
01:20:50,518 --> 01:20:51,485
That's a good one.

1453
01:20:51,519 --> 01:20:53,180
''Your child's stars are unfavourable.''

1454
01:20:53,688 --> 01:20:54,620
''He's unlucky.''

1455
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:56,554
''There's an inauspicious
issue in his horoscope.''

1456
01:20:56,624 --> 01:20:58,683
''Saturn's influencing his stars...''

1457
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,852
What is this?

1458
01:21:00,828 --> 01:21:03,729
He is just born, let him breathe.

1459
01:21:04,499 --> 01:21:08,128
And this is where all
their religious hoaxes begin.

1460
01:21:08,603 --> 01:21:10,901
Not just this lifetime,
but they also scare you..

1461
01:21:10,972 --> 01:21:13,065
..in the name of your next life. Yes.

1462
01:21:13,141 --> 01:21:15,132
lf you don't do this and this..

1463
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:17,200
..then you'll become a
dog in your next lifetime.

1464
01:21:18,579 --> 01:21:20,809
Or, if you do this,
you'll be born as a insect..

1465
01:21:20,882 --> 01:21:21,871
..and go to hell.

1466
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:24,884
And then, they read out
an entire itinerary of hell.

1467
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,913
You'll be made to sleep on
a bed of nails.

1468
01:21:28,022 --> 01:21:29,683
Thrown in the sea of fire.

1469
01:21:29,757 --> 01:21:31,691
Fried in hot oil.

1470
01:21:32,693 --> 01:21:34,183
Am l a man or a fritter?

1471
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:39,931
Wonderful, Kanji.

1472
01:21:42,937 --> 01:21:44,131
Too good.

1473
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:48,506
So, what's the definition of
religion according to you?

1474
01:21:48,843 --> 01:21:51,141
l believe, where there's religion..

1475
01:21:51,445 --> 01:21:52,969
..there's no place for honesty.

1476
01:21:53,614 --> 01:21:57,015
And where there's truth,
you don't need religion.

1477
01:21:57,118 --> 01:21:58,517
He's absolutely right.

1478
01:21:58,986 --> 01:22:00,476
What's the role..

1479
01:22:00,588 --> 01:22:02,579
..of caste and
religion in a person's life?

1480
01:22:13,601 --> 01:22:15,660
They do just one thing, madam.

1481
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:18,200
Either it makes them helpless.

1482
01:22:18,506 --> 01:22:19,905
..or a terrorist.

1483
01:22:26,647 --> 01:22:27,705
He's too good.

1484
01:22:27,782 --> 01:22:29,044
He'll never change.
- Sister.

1485
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:30,743
Oh my God.

1486
01:22:30,885 --> 01:22:33,046
Oh my God, Kanji bhai.

1487
01:22:33,788 --> 01:22:36,814
Really, you've changed
my concept about God.

1488
01:22:36,924 --> 01:22:37,913
Honestly.

1489
01:22:37,959 --> 01:22:39,790
No matter what the
verdict of the court is..

1490
01:22:40,127 --> 01:22:42,186
..the young generation today,
not just the young..

1491
01:22:42,496 --> 01:22:44,828
..but every generation
needs to think like you.

1492
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:45,888
l applaud you.

1493
01:22:45,967 --> 01:22:48,663
Hey, guys. He's my father.

1494
01:23:02,049 --> 01:23:03,482
Just a minute, priest.

1495
01:23:03,885 --> 01:23:07,582
Explain us the
meaning of these chants.

1496
01:23:08,055 --> 01:23:09,989
Priest, your fees is
500 rupees, right.

1497
01:23:10,057 --> 01:23:11,081
We will pay you that.

1498
01:23:11,125 --> 01:23:15,027
We'll pay you 5 rupees for
every mantra you explain.

1499
01:23:15,096 --> 01:23:15,994
Let's go.

1500
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:17,725
They've seen Kanji
bhai's interview as well.

1501
01:23:17,832 --> 01:23:19,857
Let's go from here, come on.
- Priest.

1502
01:23:21,469 --> 01:23:24,029
Someone placed a big stone
in the middle of the ground.

1503
01:23:24,105 --> 01:23:25,572
And a few people anointed that stone..

1504
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,629
..and adorned it with garlands.

1505
01:23:26,707 --> 01:23:28,538
Now, people call this
the temple of Hanuman..

1506
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:30,133
..they tie bells here and pray.

1507
01:23:30,211 --> 01:23:31,872
This is the only ground.

1508
01:23:31,946 --> 01:23:33,038
Where else can we play?

1509
01:23:33,114 --> 01:23:34,103
lf the BMC doesn't do anything..

1510
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:36,649
..then we will talk to Kanji bhai..
- Yes, yes..

1511
01:23:36,717 --> 01:23:40,847
No, no. That man spares no one.

1512
01:23:40,922 --> 01:23:42,184
l will move this temple.

1513
01:23:45,826 --> 01:23:48,989
''Hail Krishna.''

1514
01:23:49,063 --> 01:23:51,896
''Hail Krishna.''

1515
01:23:51,966 --> 01:23:55,629
''Hail Krishna.''

1516
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:58,637
''Hail Krishna.''

1517
01:23:58,706 --> 01:24:02,164
''Hail Krishna.''

1518
01:24:02,443 --> 01:24:05,071
''Hail Krishna.''
- Miracle.

1519
01:24:05,713 --> 01:24:07,840
Swami.
- Yes.

1520
01:24:08,616 --> 01:24:10,447
Relieve me from this hunger-strike.

1521
01:24:10,718 --> 01:24:13,016
Each time l've to go to
the toilet for eating the fritter.

1522
01:24:13,087 --> 01:24:14,918
Manage a few more days..

1523
01:24:15,022 --> 01:24:18,458
..otherwise you'll have to
starve for the rest of your life.

1524
01:24:18,793 --> 01:24:21,853
You've rented such a big ground.

1525
01:24:21,929 --> 01:24:23,487
But now nobody comes here.

1526
01:24:23,998 --> 01:24:25,829
The few that are here..

1527
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,197
..are the ones who
rented this dais to us.

1528
01:24:27,668 --> 01:24:31,069
l fear that if people
start believing in Kanji..

1529
01:24:31,138 --> 01:24:32,935
..then they will
lose their faith in us.

1530
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:36,603
What if they stop
coming to the temple?

1531
01:24:36,744 --> 01:24:38,575
That won't happen.

1532
01:24:39,647 --> 01:24:42,207
ln this country,
people visit the temple..

1533
01:24:42,483 --> 01:24:44,144
..more than they visit the school.

1534
01:24:48,122 --> 01:24:51,455
The High Court has
accepted 455 cases..

1535
01:24:51,525 --> 01:24:53,959
..but we'll have to wait and watch..

1536
01:24:54,028 --> 01:24:56,087
..Kanji Lalji Mehta's
argument in the court.

1537
01:24:58,499 --> 01:24:59,727
Siddeshwar Maharaj.

1538
01:25:00,668 --> 01:25:04,160
What's the area of your temple?

1539
01:25:05,639 --> 01:25:07,106
22 acres.

1540
01:25:08,843 --> 01:25:11,471
lt has 322 small temples of God.

1541
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:15,711
Meaning, there's an entire
shopping mall of Gods inside.

1542
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,046
Silence.

1543
01:25:21,188 --> 01:25:26,558
There are 142 priests to serve
the Lord in all these temples.

1544
01:25:26,627 --> 01:25:30,791
Do you know how many
beggars are outside your temple?

1545
01:25:30,865 --> 01:25:32,765
What?
- Beggars.

1546
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,096
You remember the 320
idols and 142 priests..

1547
01:25:37,671 --> 01:25:42,608
..but you do you know how many
beggars sit outside your temple?

1548
01:25:42,843 --> 01:25:45,937
Your Honour, the beggars
outside their temple..

1549
01:25:46,013 --> 01:25:47,878
..are restricted
from coming inside. No!

1550
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:50,077
Whether its scorching heat, or rains,
just keep rotting outside.

1551
01:25:50,151 --> 01:25:51,516
Don't set foot inside.

1552
01:25:51,652 --> 01:25:53,586
Don't say no.

1553
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:55,645
A priest from your temple told me so.

1554
01:25:56,123 --> 01:25:58,421
And he also said to me..

1555
01:25:58,926 --> 01:26:03,056
''..Kanji bhai, if you
want to win this case..''

1556
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:04,825
''..then come here every Monday.''

1557
01:26:05,132 --> 01:26:07,123
So l asked ''Where should l come''.

1558
01:26:07,435 --> 01:26:09,494
He said, ''Come to
Lord Shiva's temple''.

1559
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:12,004
''Offer a bowl of milk and then watch''.

1560
01:26:12,473 --> 01:26:14,805
l thought, fine, let's try it.

1561
01:26:15,042 --> 01:26:16,839
Your Honour, l went
there on a Monday..

1562
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:20,176
..with a bowl of milk,
standing in the long queue.

1563
01:26:20,514 --> 01:26:22,982
Everyone was holding
bowl in their hands.

1564
01:26:23,651 --> 01:26:25,881
l thought there must be
someone inside to drink the milk.

1565
01:26:25,953 --> 01:26:29,514
All of them aren't fools to
stand in the line holding a jug.

1566
01:26:29,757 --> 01:26:30,655
lt was my turn, Your Honour.

1567
01:26:30,724 --> 01:26:32,817
l went inside, but
there was no in there.

1568
01:26:32,893 --> 01:26:34,656
No one to drink the milk?

1569
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:37,963
Just then l noticed black stone.

1570
01:26:38,032 --> 01:26:40,466
lt's called 'Shiva's phallus,
you fool.

1571
01:26:40,534 --> 01:26:42,661
Yes, there was a 'Shiva's phallus.

1572
01:26:42,736 --> 01:26:44,033
And that stone.

1573
01:26:44,105 --> 01:26:45,902
That stone was
completely immersed in milk.

1574
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:51,104
And right besides the phallus,
through a small drain..

1575
01:26:51,412 --> 01:26:53,642
..the milk was going outside.

1576
01:26:53,714 --> 01:26:56,945
l thought ''Yes, there must be
someone outside to drink the milk''.

1577
01:26:57,485 --> 01:26:58,884
But when l saw there was
no one outside as well.

1578
01:26:59,487 --> 01:27:05,585
All the milk was
going into the sewers.

1579
01:27:05,659 --> 01:27:06,648
The sewers.

1580
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,022
Total waste.

1581
01:27:08,963 --> 01:27:11,830
And there was a beggar
standing right besides the sewer.

1582
01:27:11,999 --> 01:27:13,990
He must've been hungry
for the past 4-5 days.

1583
01:27:14,635 --> 01:27:16,125
He was shivering.

1584
01:27:16,871 --> 01:27:18,600
Maybe he wanted to drink the milk..

1585
01:27:18,672 --> 01:27:20,105
..but he couldn't do
so from the sewers.

1586
01:27:20,608 --> 01:27:22,872
l gave that beggar my bowl of milk.

1587
01:27:24,044 --> 01:27:26,911
And do you know what he
said after he drank the milk?

1588
01:27:27,882 --> 01:27:29,679
God bless you!

1589
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:38,683
lf every person visiting the temple..

1590
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:40,784
..gives the milk to a needy instead..

1591
01:27:40,861 --> 01:27:43,955
..then they will earn more merits.

1592
01:27:44,098 --> 01:27:45,463
Right?

1593
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:54,032
lf you donate
blankets to a poor beggar..

1594
01:27:54,108 --> 01:27:59,102
..instead of offering it to shrine,
it will make Allah happy.

1595
01:28:02,516 --> 01:28:05,713
And if you light a candle
in some poor man's hut..

1596
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:09,778
..instead of the church, they he'll never
have to live in the darkness.

1597
01:28:12,893 --> 01:28:16,124
Don't you believe in God?
- l am God.

1598
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:18,628
And l am Amitabh Bachchan!

1599
01:28:21,035 --> 01:28:22,502
Look, Kanji.

1600
01:28:23,704 --> 01:28:27,140
Offering milk, candles,
blanket is a tradition.

1601
01:28:27,775 --> 01:28:29,743
Worshipping the Lord.

1602
01:28:32,012 --> 01:28:34,446
But you won't understand their value..

1603
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:35,846
..because you are an atheist.

1604
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:39,617
You're still bounded by
the illusions of this world.

1605
01:28:39,687 --> 01:28:40,984
But you aren't.

1606
01:28:41,055 --> 01:28:43,455
You're at the threshold of salvation.

1607
01:28:43,524 --> 01:28:46,925
So, why not stop the shams under
the pretext of rituals and traditions?

1608
01:28:47,962 --> 01:28:50,089
Do you know how much oil
is wasted on Saturday..

1609
01:28:50,397 --> 01:28:51,830
..on Lord Shani's idol?

1610
01:28:52,866 --> 01:28:57,132
People stick coins
on the idol like this.

1611
01:28:57,805 --> 01:28:59,796
What will Hanuman do
with all that change?

1612
01:28:59,873 --> 01:29:01,932
Kanji is absolutely right.

1613
01:29:02,843 --> 01:29:06,609
Sai Baba lived in poverty
all his life, for the poor.

1614
01:29:07,047 --> 01:29:08,878
As long as he was alive..

1615
01:29:08,949 --> 01:29:12,146
..he wandered around
for a drop of oil.

1616
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:14,087
And today, after he's dead.

1617
01:29:14,822 --> 01:29:16,483
Throne worth millions.

1618
01:29:17,524 --> 01:29:21,654
Gold crown. What for?

1619
01:29:23,464 --> 01:29:25,898
Tell me one thing.

1620
01:29:26,567 --> 01:29:30,936
Anyone who is a
faithful devotee of the Lord..

1621
01:29:30,971 --> 01:29:34,498
..is blessed with His grace.

1622
01:29:34,642 --> 01:29:35,870
Right?

1623
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:40,142
Right?
- Yes.

1624
01:29:40,447 --> 01:29:43,473
So tell me, why does a bus heading..

1625
01:29:43,651 --> 01:29:48,611
..for a trip to Amarnath or
Vaishno Devi falls in the ravine?

1626
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:51,455
They were going to serve the Lord.

1627
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:53,019
They were going with complete faith..

1628
01:29:53,093 --> 01:29:54,583
..and singing religious discourses.

1629
01:29:54,728 --> 01:29:56,491
So, the Lord called them directly.

1630
01:29:56,897 --> 01:29:59,491
And show me one car
which met with an accident..

1631
01:29:59,566 --> 01:30:03,161
..and doesn't have God's
idol or photo kept inside.

1632
01:30:04,204 --> 01:30:05,899
Speek up.
- l object, Your Honour.

1633
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:10,542
From day 1 this man's
trying to twist the case around.

1634
01:30:11,045 --> 01:30:13,104
Mr. Kanji, this isn't
a debate about good and bad.

1635
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,209
This is the court,
we only believe on proofs here.

1636
01:30:15,716 --> 01:30:18,844
And we have proof, your
signatures on the insurance papers.

1637
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,051
And legally you have no right
to ask for any compensation..

1638
01:30:21,121 --> 01:30:22,110
..from the insurance company.

1639
01:30:22,189 --> 01:30:23,918
And as far as we're concerned.

1640
01:30:25,759 --> 01:30:28,592
We don't believe in the
insurance company's conditions.

1641
01:30:30,531 --> 01:30:34,490
lf they say that the
judge caused the earthquake..

1642
01:30:34,535 --> 01:30:36,025
..will the judge have
to pay you compensation?

1643
01:30:36,503 --> 01:30:39,199
Similarly, if God's name
is written on the policy..

1644
01:30:39,506 --> 01:30:42,031
..he isn't liable to
pay the compensation.

1645
01:30:44,044 --> 01:30:46,103
lf you want
God to give you compensation.

1646
01:30:46,847 --> 01:30:49,441
Then prove that
God caused this earthquake.

1647
01:30:49,483 --> 01:30:51,542
He did..
- But, in writing.

1648
01:30:53,821 --> 01:30:55,948
Do you have it...in writing?

1649
01:30:56,457 --> 01:30:58,516
Do you have it? Any proof?

1650
01:31:01,195 --> 01:31:04,892
Your Honour..
- Mr. Kanji, the court of law..

1651
01:31:04,965 --> 01:31:07,024
..cannot give a verdict
on just arguments alone.

1652
01:31:08,001 --> 01:31:12,802
Your arguments maybe
valid for the common people..

1653
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:17,736
..but if you cannot
prove them, it has no value.

1654
01:31:18,746 --> 01:31:20,077
Do you have any proof?

1655
01:31:23,851 --> 01:31:27,218
No. - ln that case,
the court gives you a month's time..

1656
01:31:27,588 --> 01:31:29,886
..which is your last chance.

1657
01:31:30,557 --> 01:31:33,583
On the next hearing,
if you cannot produce any evidence..

1658
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:38,757
..then l'm afraid you will have
to rest your case and all others.

1659
01:31:40,868 --> 01:31:42,495
Court is adjurned for the day.

1660
01:31:45,572 --> 01:31:46,766
Relax.

1661
01:31:47,474 --> 01:31:49,465
Next time l see you
in this courtroom..

1662
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:51,876
..l will sue you for defamation,
and you'll lose..

1663
01:31:51,945 --> 01:31:53,606
..whatever you have left.

1664
01:31:55,015 --> 01:31:56,482
Relax.

1665
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,661
What will you do now? How will
you prove it in the court now?

1666
01:32:15,969 --> 01:32:17,561
Because you're not alone, Mr. Kanji.

1667
01:32:17,638 --> 01:32:19,003
lt's a matter of crores of rupees.

1668
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:21,006
Many people have hopes with you.

1669
01:32:21,074 --> 01:32:24,009
Sir, how will you get a proof in writing?
- Sir, what about these people now?

1670
01:32:38,792 --> 01:32:40,589
You aren't playing your flute today.

1671
01:32:41,228 --> 01:32:43,458
You don't like it,
so l'm sitting quietly.

1672
01:32:44,031 --> 01:32:47,489
l like it. You play it well too.

1673
01:32:47,968 --> 01:32:49,458
Thank you.

1674
01:32:49,903 --> 01:32:52,133
You look worried.
- Yes.

1675
01:32:52,439 --> 01:32:55,875
The court says get us proof,
and in writing.

1676
01:32:56,143 --> 01:32:57,633
How do l get proof?

1677
01:32:57,711 --> 01:33:00,475
There's a consultant sitting
right next to you, ask me.

1678
01:33:01,949 --> 01:33:04,179
This isn't some housing loan issue.

1679
01:33:05,452 --> 01:33:06,612
lt's a court case.

1680
01:33:07,054 --> 01:33:07,986
lt's a big problem.

1681
01:33:08,055 --> 01:33:09,522
l've a suggestion.

1682
01:33:11,492 --> 01:33:12,754
Give me the alcohol.

1683
01:33:14,027 --> 01:33:15,517
You drink this milk.

1684
01:33:15,863 --> 01:33:16,727
You want me to mix them.

1685
01:33:16,797 --> 01:33:18,856
No, no, just drink the milk.

1686
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,865
And l will give you the solution.

1687
01:33:23,504 --> 01:33:26,200
You know, Kanji,
where's the solution..

1688
01:33:26,473 --> 01:33:29,533
..to all the problems,
tensions and trouble written?

1689
01:33:29,843 --> 01:33:31,936
Where?
- ln this book.

1690
01:33:34,014 --> 01:33:35,538
'Shrimad Bhagvad Gita.'

1691
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,584
Have your read it?
- Who can possibly read it?

1692
01:33:37,651 --> 01:33:38,811
lt's such a thick book.

1693
01:33:38,886 --> 01:33:40,046
And not a single photograph.

1694
01:33:40,554 --> 01:33:42,488
How can anyone read it,
it's not interesting at all.

1695
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:45,584
l used to keep it in my shop.

1696
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:46,884
But it would fetch a small margin.

1697
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,424
Plus it catches termites.

1698
01:33:49,463 --> 01:33:51,522
lt causes problems. So l threw it out.

1699
01:33:51,598 --> 01:33:52,758
Threw it?
- Yes, l threw it.

1700
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:54,664
You threw the Bhagwad Gita out.
- Yes.

1701
01:33:54,701 --> 01:33:56,168
Wow!
- Why?

1702
01:33:57,704 --> 01:34:00,764
Kanji, the Gita,
Bible, Koran has answers..

1703
01:34:00,841 --> 01:34:02,741
..to every problems of humans.

1704
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:05,535
l know you don't believe in all this.

1705
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:09,979
But for your own good,
read this book once.

1706
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:13,080
And see the result.

1707
01:34:13,186 --> 01:34:14,949
And if the result isn't good..

1708
01:34:15,689 --> 01:34:17,088
..then you can throw it out.

1709
01:34:19,059 --> 01:34:21,994
Kanji bhai read it once, and then see.

1710
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:25,154
Okay.

1711
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:41,740
''l am not human.''

1712
01:34:42,149 --> 01:34:45,778
''l am sold in stores.''

1713
01:34:46,987 --> 01:34:51,617
''l created the world.''

1714
01:34:51,925 --> 01:34:56,089
''Not with mud, but with my emotions.''

1715
01:34:56,830 --> 01:34:59,162
''l am wandering around..''

1716
01:34:59,466 --> 01:35:05,132
''..looking for my signs,
where are they.''

1717
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:09,875
''Where are my signs?''

1718
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:12,435
Stop begging in the name of Allah.

1719
01:35:12,713 --> 01:35:15,045
Stop begging and do some hard work.

1720
01:35:17,484 --> 01:35:19,475
''My signs.''

1721
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:22,482
''My signs.''

1722
01:35:58,091 --> 01:36:02,619
''l was always with
you as your shadow.''

1723
01:36:02,963 --> 01:36:07,923
''l gave you shade when
the heat was strong.''

1724
01:36:08,001 --> 01:36:16,466
''l was your
companion in your journey.''

1725
01:36:17,744 --> 01:36:22,181
''Still you're confused.''

1726
01:36:22,683 --> 01:36:27,017
''Looking for your
answers in the question.''

1727
01:36:27,621 --> 01:36:31,819
''Where are you lost?''

1728
01:36:33,694 --> 01:36:38,495
''Where are my signs?''

1729
01:36:38,565 --> 01:36:43,525
''Where are my signs?''

1730
01:36:43,603 --> 01:36:45,628
''My signs.''

1731
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:52,740
''My signs.''

1732
01:36:52,846 --> 01:36:55,440
''My signs.''

1733
01:37:00,153 --> 01:37:02,621
''My signs.''

1734
01:37:02,689 --> 01:37:05,749
''My signs.''

1735
01:37:19,806 --> 01:37:21,569
Wear your slippers.
- oh.

1736
01:37:23,543 --> 01:37:24,567
Thief.

1737
01:37:24,911 --> 01:37:26,640
Those are my slippers.

1738
01:37:27,614 --> 01:37:30,174
''Where are my signs?''

1739
01:37:30,484 --> 01:37:32,452
Sir, shoe polish.
- No.

1740
01:37:32,486 --> 01:37:34,010
Sir, recognise me.
The beggar outside the shrine.

1741
01:37:34,087 --> 01:37:35,645
You told me to make an honest living.

1742
01:37:35,722 --> 01:37:37,155
Shake hands, shake hands.

1743
01:37:39,526 --> 01:37:41,016
''My signs.''

1744
01:37:41,094 --> 01:37:43,426
''My signs.''

1745
01:37:52,005 --> 01:37:54,803
Today's the last hearing on
the case filed against God.

1746
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:56,906
The claim amount is 400 crore rupees.

1747
01:37:57,477 --> 01:37:59,069
Can Kanji bhai win this case?

1748
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:01,112
We'll have to wait and watch.

1749
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:04,983
You can please proceed.

1750
01:38:05,652 --> 01:38:08,644
Your Honour,
before Mr. Kanji can express..

1751
01:38:08,722 --> 01:38:11,088
..his sharp and witty
views before the court..

1752
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:13,790
..without any reference,
l would like to ask..

1753
01:38:14,461 --> 01:38:15,758
..does he have any evidence,
to prove..

1754
01:38:15,829 --> 01:38:18,491
..that God has demolished his shop?

1755
01:38:19,466 --> 01:38:23,425
Your Honour, l require a learned man..

1756
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:26,837
..for the next
question l'm going to ask.

1757
01:38:27,574 --> 01:38:30,600
So, whoever amongst you is
the learned one can come here.

1758
01:38:30,977 --> 01:38:33,036
The learned one, please come here.

1759
01:38:35,582 --> 01:38:37,140
Please sit down.

1760
01:38:42,522 --> 01:38:43,716
Come.

1761
01:38:56,136 --> 01:39:00,505
You sages always speak
about the scriptures..

1762
01:39:00,574 --> 01:39:02,166
..in their preaching.

1763
01:39:02,442 --> 01:39:05,070
ls everything written
in the scriptures true?

1764
01:39:05,645 --> 01:39:07,078
Absolutely.

1765
01:39:07,113 --> 01:39:09,104
lt's not written anywhere,
you're saying that.

1766
01:39:09,883 --> 01:39:11,407
lt's written in the Gita.

1767
01:39:11,484 --> 01:39:13,645
lt is. What's written in the Gita?

1768
01:39:14,554 --> 01:39:18,991
Chapter four, verse forty of Gita.

1769
01:39:33,073 --> 01:39:35,064
Meaning?
- lt means..

1770
01:39:35,508 --> 01:39:42,505
Any illiterate, or faithless
person that doubts the Gita..

1771
01:39:43,016 --> 01:39:44,950
..is destined to ruination.

1772
01:39:45,752 --> 01:39:49,779
He stays devoid of
sanctity on earth and on heaven.

1773
01:39:49,856 --> 01:39:51,448
Understood?

1774
01:39:53,693 --> 01:39:55,524
He's an interesting character.

1775
01:39:57,564 --> 01:40:03,594
Do you understand anything
written in The Gita or the Scriptures?

1776
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:06,200
Or are you blindly agreeing..

1777
01:40:06,539 --> 01:40:08,507
..to whatever Leeladhar is saying.

1778
01:40:08,842 --> 01:40:11,106
Your Honour,
small children in school..

1779
01:40:11,177 --> 01:40:12,940
..don't remember the entire prayer.

1780
01:40:13,513 --> 01:40:15,481
So they just close their eyes and...

1781
01:40:15,515 --> 01:40:16,914
Move their lips.

1782
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:18,847
They move their lips and
you're moving your hands.

1783
01:40:18,919 --> 01:40:20,477
Kanji.

1784
01:40:21,588 --> 01:40:25,820
You've insulted a learned sage.

1785
01:40:25,892 --> 01:40:28,588
So?
- You won't get refuge even in hell.

1786
01:40:28,962 --> 01:40:30,691
How can l?

1787
01:40:31,498 --> 01:40:34,228
You've already reserved places there.

1788
01:40:39,539 --> 01:40:41,530
How dare you?

1789
01:40:42,142 --> 01:40:43,575
How dare you?

1790
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:46,003
Atheist!

1791
01:40:47,981 --> 01:40:49,573
Silence.
- Leave me! Leave me!

1792
01:40:49,649 --> 01:40:51,014
What are you doing?

1793
01:40:51,084 --> 01:40:54,019
This is the court, sit down.

1794
01:40:56,022 --> 01:40:58,582
Order, order.

1795
01:41:01,094 --> 01:41:02,527
Sit down everyone.

1796
01:41:21,848 --> 01:41:24,749
Chapter 2, verse 56.

1797
01:41:26,619 --> 01:41:32,717
Meaning, a person for whom
happiness and sorrows is equal..

1798
01:41:32,759 --> 01:41:38,220
..and is devoid of anger and fear,
and has a calm mind..

1799
01:41:38,531 --> 01:41:40,624
..is called a learned person.

1800
01:41:46,039 --> 01:41:47,870
They'll teach me Gita?

1801
01:41:48,141 --> 01:41:50,473
They can't teach me, Your Honour.

1802
01:41:50,543 --> 01:41:53,671
Their lQ is lower than
the room temperature.

1803
01:41:56,816 --> 01:42:00,775
l said a few things to instigate you..

1804
01:42:00,854 --> 01:42:02,151
..you tried to harm me.

1805
01:42:02,622 --> 01:42:05,489
ls this your achievement, Siddeshwar?

1806
01:42:05,558 --> 01:42:08,755
Mr. Kanji, the issue
isn't his achievement..

1807
01:42:08,828 --> 01:42:10,955
..the issue here is
who razed down your shop?

1808
01:42:11,498 --> 01:42:12,522
God did.

1809
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:13,497
You're giving a verdict.

1810
01:42:13,566 --> 01:42:15,659
That's the judge's duty.

1811
01:42:16,102 --> 01:42:18,002
You just have to prove..

1812
01:42:18,071 --> 01:42:20,539
..that God caused that earthquake.

1813
01:42:20,607 --> 01:42:21,733
Yes, and it's
impossible to prove that.

1814
01:42:21,808 --> 01:42:23,139
Relax, relax, relax.

1815
01:42:23,209 --> 01:42:24,938
Nothing is impossible.

1816
01:42:26,646 --> 01:42:29,911
Tell me one thing.

1817
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:33,981
The Lord has narrated
the 'Bhagvad Gita'. - Yes.

1818
01:42:34,054 --> 01:42:37,148
And everything said in
the 'Bhagvad Gita' is true.

1819
01:42:37,991 --> 01:42:39,117
Absolutely.

1820
01:42:39,526 --> 01:42:40,857
Point to be noted, Your Honour.

1821
01:42:41,094 --> 01:42:45,087
So tell me, why did God say in the
eight verse of the ninth chapter..

1822
01:42:45,165 --> 01:42:50,432
..of the 'Gita',
''l've created the entire universe..''

1823
01:42:50,703 --> 01:42:53,001
''..and it will be
destroyed on my will''.

1824
01:42:53,073 --> 01:42:55,735
''The entire creation follows my will.''

1825
01:42:56,176 --> 01:42:59,737
''lt is only l, who is responsible..

1826
01:42:59,813 --> 01:43:01,747
..for its creation
and its destruction.''

1827
01:43:02,882 --> 01:43:04,543
And look.

1828
01:43:04,617 --> 01:43:06,915
Your Honour, it's been
said in the Bible as well.

1829
01:43:08,121 --> 01:43:10,954
Chapter 54, verse 16.

1830
01:43:13,093 --> 01:43:16,551
''See, it is l who have
created the smith..''

1831
01:43:16,629 --> 01:43:19,655
''..who blows the fire of coals
and produces a weapon..''

1832
01:43:19,732 --> 01:43:21,029
''..fit for his purpose.''

1833
01:43:21,568 --> 01:43:25,561
''l've also created the
ravager to destroy.''

1834
01:43:26,139 --> 01:43:27,538
And see this.

1835
01:43:27,607 --> 01:43:28,972
Also in the Holy Quran.

1836
01:43:29,642 --> 01:43:33,203
Sur-e-Zalzala 99,
verse 108 states that..

1837
01:43:33,713 --> 01:43:37,581
''..the entire earth will
be shaken to its core.''

1838
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:41,516
''And the earth will
spill out its burden.''

1839
01:43:41,654 --> 01:43:44,452
''And humans will question,
what's happening.''

1840
01:43:44,691 --> 01:43:48,058
''And that day,
she will unveil her plight.''

1841
01:43:48,461 --> 01:43:52,898
''Because the Lord would've
ordered her to do so.''

1842
01:43:53,032 --> 01:43:54,590
''The Lord.''

1843
01:44:01,774 --> 01:44:04,641
All these things mean the same thing..

1844
01:44:05,745 --> 01:44:07,906
..that my shop was razed down..

1845
01:44:07,947 --> 01:44:10,472
..due to the earthquake caused by God.

1846
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:13,041
That means it is an act of God.

1847
01:44:13,653 --> 01:44:15,518
lt's His doing.

1848
01:44:16,055 --> 01:44:18,683
And, all those who
have suffered losses..

1849
01:44:18,758 --> 01:44:23,457
..due to Him, will have
to be compensated by God.

1850
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:29,159
Otherwise, their collection agents.

1851
01:44:33,673 --> 01:44:35,504
Your Honour, Mr. Kanji is
trying to confuse Leeladhar..

1852
01:44:35,575 --> 01:44:36,633
..with his words.

1853
01:44:36,709 --> 01:44:37,869
Mr. Sardesai.

1854
01:44:38,778 --> 01:44:40,871
What are you doing? Let him speak.

1855
01:44:41,047 --> 01:44:43,072
lf it's proven that God exists..

1856
01:44:43,516 --> 01:44:44,983
..then we won't have to pay.

1857
01:44:45,018 --> 01:44:46,508
l see.

1858
01:44:47,153 --> 01:44:49,917
- Now you want to blame us completely.
- Be quiet.

1859
01:44:49,989 --> 01:44:52,981
- You cannot blame the Lord
to hide your sins. - Be quiet.

1860
01:44:53,092 --> 01:44:55,720
Because only we have
a copyright on God.

1861
01:44:55,795 --> 01:44:57,126
Copyright?

1862
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:58,920
Just because you constructed
a few temples.. - Silence.

1863
01:44:58,998 --> 01:45:00,522
..you think God belongs to you..

1864
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:02,162
Beware.

1865
01:45:02,468 --> 01:45:04,129
Our community won't spare you.

1866
01:45:04,437 --> 01:45:05,631
What's he..
- Silence!

1867
01:45:05,672 --> 01:45:06,934
Relax.

1868
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:13,011
Until today l had heard
that God is venerated..

1869
01:45:13,079 --> 01:45:15,877
..He is worshipped, prayed to.

1870
01:45:16,149 --> 01:45:20,142
But now l see that
Gods have copyrights too.

1871
01:45:23,056 --> 01:45:24,751
God's copyright?

1872
01:45:24,824 --> 01:45:27,452
These people have
turned God into a brand.

1873
01:45:28,828 --> 01:45:33,026
Now l am assured
that God doesn't exist.

1874
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,028
Not possible.

1875
01:45:35,168 --> 01:45:37,466
Because if He really existed..

1876
01:45:37,537 --> 01:45:40,768
..he would've rid
the world of imposters like you.

1877
01:45:41,674 --> 01:45:45,110
l've already proven what
l wanted to, Your Honour.

1878
01:45:45,878 --> 01:45:47,846
Now the verdict..

1879
01:45:54,153 --> 01:45:55,984
Mr. Kanji, are you alright?

1880
01:45:56,923 --> 01:46:00,120
Mr. kanji, are you alright?

1881
01:46:01,527 --> 01:46:02,516
Mr. Kanji.

1882
01:46:02,595 --> 01:46:04,153
Kanji bhai! Kanji bhai!

1883
01:46:04,430 --> 01:46:05,897
Kanji bhai! Kanji bhai!

1884
01:46:05,965 --> 01:46:08,024
What's wrong with my brother?

1885
01:46:08,101 --> 01:46:09,898
Someone get water.

1886
01:46:10,436 --> 01:46:12,028
Kanji bhai! Kanji bhai!

1887
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:14,497
Thank you.
- Call the ambulance.

1888
01:46:14,574 --> 01:46:15,802
Call the ambulance.

1889
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:26,108
Yes, he's here.

1890
01:46:26,185 --> 01:46:27,584
Excuse me.
- Just a minute, just a minute.

1891
01:46:27,654 --> 01:46:30,919
Let me thought.
- Please let us pass.

1892
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:32,955
You cannot go inside.
- No, no, no.

1893
01:46:33,026 --> 01:46:35,460
Please, l said you cannot..
- But he's my husband.

1894
01:46:35,495 --> 01:46:36,689
l want to see him.

1895
01:46:39,499 --> 01:46:42,229
Doctor, is he alright?

1896
01:46:42,935 --> 01:46:44,562
lt's a severe attack of paralysis.

1897
01:46:44,837 --> 01:46:46,065
And now he's gone into coma.

1898
01:47:06,059 --> 01:47:08,118
He's on ventilator and..

1899
01:47:08,461 --> 01:47:10,053
..only God can save him now.

1900
01:47:23,476 --> 01:47:25,671
The 400 crore in
compensations under the 'Act of God'..

1901
01:47:25,745 --> 01:47:27,144
..will now be paid out.

1902
01:47:30,817 --> 01:47:33,115
Great, Lord.

1903
01:48:22,468 --> 01:48:23,799
Where am l?

1904
01:48:24,904 --> 01:48:26,030
Don't say that.

1905
01:48:29,108 --> 01:48:30,507
You're in the lCU.

1906
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:32,605
Your wife and children are outside.

1907
01:48:33,646 --> 01:48:35,477
No one's allowed inside.

1908
01:48:37,116 --> 01:48:38,549
Then how did you come in?

1909
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,444
l came here to wake you up.

1910
01:48:45,491 --> 01:48:47,425
lt's time for you to get up.

1911
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:55,959
You cussed God from your heart.

1912
01:48:57,937 --> 01:48:59,495
And where's the heart?

1913
01:48:59,906 --> 01:49:01,396
On your left.

1914
01:49:01,874 --> 01:49:05,139
So God has paralysed
your entire left side.

1915
01:49:07,513 --> 01:49:10,004
l am not saying this..

1916
01:49:11,451 --> 01:49:15,012
..it's the media outside
spreading this rumour.

1917
01:49:16,122 --> 01:49:19,523
l can cure you if you want.

1918
01:49:20,593 --> 01:49:22,458
So, you're a doctor now.

1919
01:49:23,029 --> 01:49:24,553
l am all in one.

1920
01:49:25,431 --> 01:49:27,160
Want to see a miracle.

1921
01:49:29,469 --> 01:49:35,169
Soaring around on
the bike isn't called miracle.

1922
01:49:35,508 --> 01:49:36,634
l see.

1923
01:49:38,711 --> 01:49:40,110
Here we go.

1924
01:50:27,226 --> 01:50:30,855
Krishna Vasudev Yadav, from Gokul.

1925
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,165
Do you believe now?

1926
01:50:44,577 --> 01:50:47,774
''You're my mother, and my father.''

1927
01:50:48,014 --> 01:50:51,472
''You're my friend, and my companion.''

1928
01:50:51,851 --> 01:50:54,979
l've donned the same
form you always see..

1929
01:50:55,054 --> 01:50:58,490
..on televisions, calendars, movies.

1930
01:50:58,758 --> 01:51:00,817
l've been seen in this form for ages.

1931
01:51:00,893 --> 01:51:02,724
And l'm standing before
you in that same form.

1932
01:51:05,531 --> 01:51:09,023
But Kanji bhai, l'm not like that.

1933
01:51:11,470 --> 01:51:12,869
You really..

1934
01:51:14,006 --> 01:51:16,998
Forgive me, forgive me.

1935
01:51:17,977 --> 01:51:20,969
Just like a devotee is
incomplete without his God..

1936
01:51:22,114 --> 01:51:27,575
..similarly, God is incomplete
without his true devotee.

1937
01:51:33,826 --> 01:51:36,226
Why didn't you show me
this miracle before?

1938
01:51:38,931 --> 01:51:40,159
That's the problem.

1939
01:51:43,169 --> 01:51:44,636
Friend.

1940
01:51:45,638 --> 01:51:48,004
l am Krishna,
that's why l perform miracles.

1941
01:51:49,508 --> 01:51:53,103
l'm not Krishna,
because l perform miracles.

1942
01:51:54,814 --> 01:51:56,543
That means you're real.

1943
01:51:56,949 --> 01:51:58,177
God exists.

1944
01:51:58,784 --> 01:52:02,686
And God isn't my father-figure,
he's my friend.

1945
01:52:02,755 --> 01:52:07,954
l am everyone's friend,
but no one understands me one.

1946
01:52:08,027 --> 01:52:09,858
People gave you a high position.

1947
01:52:10,096 --> 01:52:11,723
And you staggered.

1948
01:52:12,531 --> 01:52:15,500
Yes, but l am not
like people think of me.

1949
01:52:16,636 --> 01:52:18,126
l've common sense too.

1950
01:52:19,038 --> 01:52:24,032
l am not interested
in people's offerings.

1951
01:52:24,477 --> 01:52:27,503
l want them to
distribute all this to the poor.

1952
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:32,881
All l care about is their faith,
their love, their belief.

1953
01:52:32,952 --> 01:52:34,544
Just a minute.

1954
01:52:34,987 --> 01:52:36,215
Belief?

1955
01:52:36,622 --> 01:52:38,487
But l never believed in You.

1956
01:52:38,891 --> 01:52:40,222
l was an atheist.

1957
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:42,088
Why did You show yourself to only me?

1958
01:52:43,462 --> 01:52:44,588
Kanji bhai, sit down.

1959
01:52:51,937 --> 01:52:53,427
Do you know what atheist means?

1960
01:52:55,508 --> 01:52:58,068
Someone who examines, thinks,
understands..

1961
01:52:58,144 --> 01:52:59,771
..and says that this is wrong.

1962
01:53:00,146 --> 01:53:01,443
The Lord doesn't exist.

1963
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:03,641
He's an atheist.

1964
01:53:03,883 --> 01:53:05,441
That's why l appeared before you.

1965
01:53:05,985 --> 01:53:08,886
Because you did
everything a true atheist does.

1966
01:53:09,121 --> 01:53:12,750
And a true atheist can
become a real believer.

1967
01:53:13,492 --> 01:53:15,926
People come to me for
their own self-interest.

1968
01:53:16,729 --> 01:53:18,924
They come with
different exchange offers.

1969
01:53:19,165 --> 01:53:20,598
Exchange offer?

1970
01:53:21,133 --> 01:53:22,998
''Lord, if l pass my SSC exams..''

1971
01:53:23,069 --> 01:53:25,037
''..l will walk to
Siddhivinayak for 5 Tuesdays.''

1972
01:53:26,572 --> 01:53:30,633
''lf Dominic's agrees to marry me..''

1973
01:53:31,143 --> 01:53:34,476
''..l will light 11 candles
at Mt. Mary.''

1974
01:53:35,014 --> 01:53:37,812
''lf my wife gets pregnant..''

1975
01:53:38,017 --> 01:53:40,485
''..then l will come and
offer a blanket at your shrine.''

1976
01:53:40,986 --> 01:53:42,476
Different offers.

1977
01:53:43,089 --> 01:53:46,991
And those who can't blame me for it.

1978
01:53:47,626 --> 01:53:49,526
They say, we couldn't go there..

1979
01:53:49,628 --> 01:53:51,152
..because the Lord didn't call us.

1980
01:53:52,164 --> 01:53:53,893
The Lord didn't call?

1981
01:53:53,933 --> 01:53:54,865
Do they need a invitation card..
- Yes.

1982
01:53:54,934 --> 01:53:56,799
Do you want me to write
you an invitation card?

1983
01:53:57,069 --> 01:53:58,934
Don't l have anything better to do?

1984
01:53:59,638 --> 01:54:02,505
And anyway, Kanji bhai,
l am present in every element.

1985
01:54:02,842 --> 01:54:04,002
l am omnipresent.

1986
01:54:04,076 --> 01:54:05,668
lf you're present everywhere..

1987
01:54:05,711 --> 01:54:07,178
..why have they built temples?

1988
01:54:07,446 --> 01:54:09,175
l've my own house.

1989
01:54:09,782 --> 01:54:11,875
l don't want to live
inside those four walls.

1990
01:54:12,051 --> 01:54:14,952
Then? Why did you
create such a religion?

1991
01:54:15,454 --> 01:54:17,649
l only created humans.

1992
01:54:17,723 --> 01:54:20,817
And humans started religion, caste.

1993
01:54:20,893 --> 01:54:22,952
And it's been going on for years now..

1994
01:54:23,028 --> 01:54:25,462
..because you need it.

1995
01:54:25,531 --> 01:54:27,624
But one should
discard such a religion.

1996
01:54:29,034 --> 01:54:31,628
Never snatch the
religion from the people.

1997
01:54:32,004 --> 01:54:36,839
lf you take them away, they
will make you their religion.

1998
01:54:38,911 --> 01:54:40,538
You don't believe it, do you?

1999
01:54:44,116 --> 01:54:46,084
You've been in coma for a month.

2000
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:49,647
Let me show you what has happened..

2001
01:54:49,722 --> 01:54:51,417
..in the past one month.

2002
01:54:52,491 --> 01:54:58,020
Kanji Prabhu paid me
a visit in my dreams yesterday.

2003
01:54:58,097 --> 01:55:03,729
And he said he's
the 11th Avatar of Lord Vishnu.

2004
01:55:03,803 --> 01:55:05,464
What's going on?

2005
01:55:06,505 --> 01:55:09,906
Kanji Prabhu appeared
in his four-armed form.

2006
01:55:10,776 --> 01:55:14,109
Holding the mace, the conch..

2007
01:55:15,581 --> 01:55:17,446
People all around the world..

2008
01:55:17,483 --> 01:55:19,178
..are seeing signs
of Kanji's Godly form.

2009
01:55:19,451 --> 01:55:20,918
l was on night duty.

2010
01:55:20,986 --> 01:55:22,715
A just closed my eyes.

2011
01:55:22,788 --> 01:55:25,154
And someone slapped me.

2012
01:55:25,457 --> 01:55:28,722
And that's when l heard a voice,
''No sleeping on duty''.

2013
01:55:28,794 --> 01:55:31,888
Circulate a few miraculous
stories of Kanji in the market..

2014
01:55:32,031 --> 01:55:33,794
..and people will
spread it like wildfire.

2015
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:38,630
l had seen Kanji Prabhu
flying with his scooter.

2016
01:55:38,737 --> 01:55:40,466
He appeared suddenly.

2017
01:55:40,539 --> 01:55:42,598
10 feet, 15 feet, 20 feet.

2018
01:55:42,675 --> 01:55:44,142
Brother Kanji is God.

2019
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:45,741
He is God.

2020
01:55:46,478 --> 01:55:49,106
The 'dharma gurus' have accepted
Kanji bhai's Kalki avatar..

2021
01:55:49,415 --> 01:55:51,406
..asked for an apology
and have decided..

2022
01:55:51,483 --> 01:55:53,974
..to pay the claims worth 400 crore.

2023
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:58,456
lt was His will that we
should pay, so we did.

2024
01:55:58,524 --> 01:56:00,116
But why are you making him God?

2025
01:56:00,426 --> 01:56:01,825
Who told you that he is God?

2026
01:56:01,861 --> 01:56:05,854
Do you know...when you will die?

2027
01:56:06,799 --> 01:56:08,528
Do you?
- No.

2028
01:56:08,968 --> 01:56:10,765
l don't know either.

2029
01:56:12,071 --> 01:56:16,838
But he has decided his death day.

2030
01:56:19,178 --> 01:56:22,147
On 16th December as soon as
we switch off the ventilator..

2031
01:56:22,448 --> 01:56:23,813
..Kanji's story will be over.

2032
01:56:24,450 --> 01:56:26,645
But this time we've
incurred heavy losses.

2033
01:56:27,086 --> 01:56:28,917
400 crores in insurance claims.

2034
01:56:28,988 --> 01:56:30,148
One crore to the doctor.

2035
01:56:30,456 --> 01:56:32,151
And the expense to
construct the temple.

2036
01:56:32,458 --> 01:56:34,517
lt's a onetime investment, Mr. Mishra.

2037
01:56:34,627 --> 01:56:36,754
We'll recover it in a year.

2038
01:56:36,996 --> 01:56:42,457
And anyway, we haven't had
a new God for a long time now.

2039
01:56:46,505 --> 01:56:49,997
''Hail Lord Kanji Wala.''

2040
01:56:50,609 --> 01:56:54,841
''Hail Lord Kanji Wala.''

2041
01:56:55,147 --> 01:56:59,641
''Om Lord Kanji Wala.''

2042
01:57:00,619 --> 01:57:05,147
''Sugar's high,
feeling breathless too.''

2043
01:57:05,457 --> 01:57:09,723
''Cure my swine flu.''
- Cure my swine flu.

2044
01:57:10,763 --> 01:57:13,664
l am going.
- Mahadev, wait.

2045
01:57:13,732 --> 01:57:15,529
Where are you going so hastily?

2046
01:57:15,634 --> 01:57:16,931
Forsake your anger.

2047
01:57:17,536 --> 01:57:20,061
The bed besides Kanji bhai is empty.

2048
01:57:21,507 --> 01:57:22,906
Do you want me to
reserve that for you?

2049
01:57:22,975 --> 01:57:28,140
He will forsake his
body on his birthday.

2050
01:57:30,115 --> 01:57:35,678
His shrine will be built
right where his shop was.

2051
01:57:35,754 --> 01:57:37,949
That isn't all. Now watch this.

2052
01:57:38,457 --> 01:57:41,051
All arrangements to transport
Kanji bhai's tomb has been made.

2053
01:57:41,126 --> 01:57:42,889
You snatched their business..

2054
01:57:42,962 --> 01:57:45,089
..and they made you their business.

2055
01:57:45,731 --> 01:57:46,629
Yes.

2056
01:57:46,699 --> 01:57:49,725
Kanji bhai, they've made an estimate..

2057
01:57:49,802 --> 01:57:54,466
..to earn 450 crores from your temple.

2058
01:57:54,807 --> 01:57:57,605
You're God, you
should've stopped them.

2059
01:57:57,676 --> 01:58:00,509
Friend, l would've ended the
battle of Mahabharat in a second..

2060
01:58:00,579 --> 01:58:01,807
..if l had picked up the weapon.

2061
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,541
But that isn't my job.

2062
01:58:03,615 --> 01:58:06,675
My job is to show
people right and wrong.

2063
01:58:06,752 --> 01:58:08,652
This is your temple, your battle.

2064
01:58:08,721 --> 01:58:10,780
You decide what you should do.

2065
01:58:10,856 --> 01:58:15,088
Fight if you want to, or stay quiet.

2066
01:58:25,537 --> 01:58:26,936
Save him, please doctor.

2067
01:58:27,006 --> 01:58:28,803
We cannot do anything now.

2068
01:58:29,475 --> 01:58:31,943
And anyway, it's his last wish.

2069
01:58:32,011 --> 01:58:34,479
He is God.

2070
01:58:36,015 --> 01:58:37,448
Just a minute.

2071
01:58:37,516 --> 01:58:40,451
Wait here,
we'll bring the dead body out.

2072
01:58:46,525 --> 01:58:50,962
Donate as much as you wish in the donation
box kept in front of Kanji Prabhu..

2073
01:58:51,030 --> 01:58:53,624
..and have your wishes fulfilled.

2074
01:58:53,866 --> 01:58:57,063
The rate for VlP line is Rs. 101.

2075
01:58:57,136 --> 01:58:59,866
Welcome, welcome, Mahadev.

2076
01:59:00,939 --> 01:59:04,568
Swami, our very own Mahadeveshwar.

2077
01:59:05,010 --> 01:59:06,875
This is called destiny.

2078
01:59:06,945 --> 01:59:12,008
Kanji's chapter's going to
end right where it started.

2079
01:59:23,095 --> 01:59:25,586
Kanji bhai's body has gone
missing from the hospital.

2080
01:59:25,898 --> 01:59:29,026
The hospital
administration has no explanation.

2081
01:59:29,601 --> 01:59:32,502
Offerings made in
clarified butter, only Rs.25.

2082
01:59:32,604 --> 01:59:34,731
Where did Kanji disappear to?

2083
01:59:36,809 --> 01:59:39,039
Call Mr. Mishra.

2084
01:59:40,612 --> 01:59:41,636
There he is.

2085
01:59:41,713 --> 01:59:43,874
He isn't Spiderman. Find him.

2086
01:59:45,117 --> 01:59:47,847
l just found out. Don't worry.

2087
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:50,445
l am there. l'll do something.

2088
01:59:50,789 --> 01:59:56,625
Kanji Prabhu's dead body can arrive
in the truck anytime now. - Go on.

2089
01:59:56,762 --> 02:00:02,530
Everyone please keep calm, everyone
will get a chance to behold him.

2090
02:00:03,502 --> 02:00:05,800
photographs of Sri Kanji Prabhu.

2091
02:00:05,871 --> 02:00:09,068
Kanji Prabhu's autobiography.

2092
02:00:21,954 --> 02:00:24,218
You are a fool.

2093
02:00:24,523 --> 02:00:25,956
l gave orders and you
set out to look for Kanji.

2094
02:00:26,024 --> 02:00:27,855
Who do you think he is?

2095
02:00:28,494 --> 02:00:30,018
Let's get out of here quietly,
otherwise..

2096
02:00:30,095 --> 02:00:31,528
..the people won't spare us.

2097
02:00:31,597 --> 02:00:33,258
Come on.

2098
02:00:53,452 --> 02:00:55,477
Kanji is alive.

2099
02:00:58,690 --> 02:01:00,590
Yes, l am alive.

2100
02:01:05,531 --> 02:01:07,089
What are you staring at?

2101
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:11,831
l am the same Kanji whom
you've turned into God.

2102
02:01:12,171 --> 02:01:15,106
l don't know whether
you're great or fool.

2103
02:01:15,507 --> 02:01:19,170
l kept telling you don't
turn religion into business..

2104
02:01:19,211 --> 02:01:23,170
..you made him God and
started your business.

2105
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:26,174
Tell me one thing.

2106
02:01:26,485 --> 02:01:30,683
The world's so beautiful,
why should God live only in temples?

2107
02:01:31,690 --> 02:01:33,920
l say, have faith in Him.

2108
02:01:34,493 --> 02:01:35,585
Believe in Him from your heart..

2109
02:01:35,661 --> 02:01:36,889
..and you will find God.

2110
02:01:37,696 --> 02:01:40,221
Try to find God in humans,
and you will find Him.

2111
02:01:40,532 --> 02:01:42,523
You will find Him in humans.

2112
02:01:42,601 --> 02:01:44,569
Not in these stones.

2113
02:01:45,737 --> 02:01:49,002
Not in these...stones.

2114
02:01:57,616 --> 02:01:59,880
They played with our emotions.

2115
02:01:59,985 --> 02:02:01,145
We won't spare them!

2116
02:02:01,186 --> 02:02:02,483
We won't spare them!

2117
02:02:02,521 --> 02:02:04,045
They spread the rumour
of your death as well.

2118
02:02:04,089 --> 02:02:05,750
They are the imposters.

2119
02:02:05,824 --> 02:02:07,485
Listen.

2120
02:02:07,926 --> 02:02:10,895
You kill two and there
are two hundred more.

2121
02:02:10,963 --> 02:02:12,658
Don't you see it on
television everyday?

2122
02:02:12,931 --> 02:02:15,627
Their real punishment is..

2123
02:02:15,767 --> 02:02:18,167
..let them leave respectfully.

2124
02:02:19,137 --> 02:02:22,129
Let them leave in
their expensive cars.

2125
02:02:22,207 --> 02:02:27,975
And no one will set foot
in their temples or hermitages.

2126
02:02:28,046 --> 02:02:29,513
Get that.

2127
02:02:29,581 --> 02:02:31,572
That will be their real punishment.

2128
02:02:32,517 --> 02:02:33,916
Please leave.

2129
02:03:01,113 --> 02:03:06,813
Faith and belief,
are very addictive, Kanji.

2130
02:03:08,086 --> 02:03:12,648
Once you're addicted to it,
you cannot let go easily.

2131
02:03:13,525 --> 02:03:15,516
All the people that you see here..

2132
02:03:16,528 --> 02:03:21,522
..they are not God-loving people,
they are God-fearing.

2133
02:03:22,067 --> 02:03:26,094
Sooner or later, you might
see them in hermitages again.

2134
02:03:29,875 --> 02:03:32,036
Be fearless!

2135
02:03:42,487 --> 02:03:45,979
So...won't you go along?

2136
02:03:47,559 --> 02:03:49,026
Come on, break the idol.

2137
02:03:50,462 --> 02:03:51,759
Papa.
- Where? Where is he?

2138
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:57,496
l want you to promise that
no one will ever drop a penny..

2139
02:03:57,569 --> 02:03:59,537
..at any of the relegious places.

2140
02:04:04,443 --> 02:04:05,603
What are you staring at?

2141
02:04:05,677 --> 02:04:07,076
Break the statue.

2142
02:04:22,127 --> 02:04:25,563
Here, come here.
- Come, l'll introduce you to Krishna.

2143
02:04:25,630 --> 02:04:27,962
What?
- Come that way.

2144
02:04:33,071 --> 02:04:35,471
Look, Kanji bhai,
they're felling the statue.

2145
02:04:40,512 --> 02:04:42,639
lt's exactly like you wanted.

2146
02:04:43,582 --> 02:04:45,174
Look..

2147
02:05:04,503 --> 02:05:06,061
Who are you looking for, Kanji?

2148
02:05:08,974 --> 02:05:10,999
Didn't l say l am present everywhere?

2149
02:05:11,777 --> 02:05:14,041
l am pouring on fields as the rain.

2150
02:05:14,813 --> 02:05:17,145
And making nests along with the birds.

2151
02:05:17,949 --> 02:05:20,747
l am also taking lunch
with the ants down there.

2152
02:05:27,893 --> 02:05:29,690
Are you fine?
- Papa.

2153
02:05:30,095 --> 02:05:31,187
Yes, l am fine.

2154
02:05:31,496 --> 02:05:33,521
Whom did you want us to introduce to?

2155
02:05:37,002 --> 02:05:38,526
No one.

2156
02:05:38,804 --> 02:05:40,169
No one.

2157
02:05:42,574 --> 02:05:44,041
What are you doing, Kanji?

2158
02:05:44,810 --> 02:05:47,142
Don't wear this around
your neck as a talisman.

2159
02:05:48,113 --> 02:05:50,809
You finally succeeded
in explaining people..

2160
02:05:50,882 --> 02:05:52,474
..that this is wrong.

2161
02:05:52,717 --> 02:05:54,514
Throw it.

2162
02:05:54,753 --> 02:05:56,687
Throw it away.
