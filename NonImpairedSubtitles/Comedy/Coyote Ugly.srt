1
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,579
Why don't you, like,
ever realize the truth, Vince?

2
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,737
I ate nine pies and a meatball hero
in one hour. That's a record.

3
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,253
It wasn't nine pies. It was eight.
You left two slices of mushroom
on the last tray.

4
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,134
- Violet?
- You guys, it was six pies. No hero.

5
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,457
I had to call the paramedics
to pump your stomach, and it was
three-and-a-half years ago.

6
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,175
-When are you guys gonna talk
about something else?
-When someone comes through that door...

7
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,293
and breaks the record, then we'll
stop talkin' about the subject.

8
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,490
Enjoy your pie, guys.

9
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,374
- It's the last one I'll ever serve.
- Aren't you forgetting something?

10
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,094
Quit it, Pete.
I'm not doin' that.

11
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,373
It's a tradition.
Sign the card.

12
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,776
I got it, folks.
I got the first autograph.

13
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,972
- Hey, Violet. All right!
- Violet's on her way to the wall.

14
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,219
That's 20 years
of girls leaving town.

15
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,810
That wall is jinxed.
I won't sit near that wall.

16
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,773
Let's hope you have better luck
than they did.

17
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,812
Ladies and gentlemen.

18
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,013
As you all know, my best friend,
Violet Sanford...

19
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,700
has decided--

20
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,493
has decided to leave
South Amboy tomorrow...

21
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,329
and travel the 42 miles
to New York City.

22
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,258
So-- Okay, come on.
Bring her up here, girls.

23
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,293
- Come on, Violet. You gotta do it.
- No.

24
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,208
Come on, Vi.
Come on, everyone.

25
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,900
Hey, Violet, come on.
Come up here.

26
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,490
- Come on, honey.
- You guys!

27
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,216
Now, I think it's only fair
that tonight, on her last night here
with us in Jersey...

28
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,333
she grace us
with a little tune.

29
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,451
No way!

30
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,697
At first I was afraid
I was petrified

31
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,018
Kept thinkin'I could never
live without you by my side

32
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,213
Then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong

33
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,855
And I grew strong
and I knew how to get along

34
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,689
No, not I
I will survive

35
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,859
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive

36
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,939
I got all my life to live
I got all my love to give

37
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,575
I'll survive
I will survive

38
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,537
Look at this! Four people killed
last night in New York.

39
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,017
No reason at all.
Police have no leads.

40
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,449
- Tragic.
- Dad, what're you doin'?

41
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,048
I guess four out
of seven million ain't so bad.

42
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,650
Headlines should read,
"Millions Survive Night in New York.''

43
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,657
Dad, stop. I get the point.
Here. Eat your eggs.

44
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,295
They're not eggs. They're egg whites.
And I'd rather eat the carton.

45
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,538
You've already lost six pounds.
You're staying on this diet.
No fast food. No sausage.

46
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,857
Oh, and I bought you some
of those Lean Cuisine meals,
and I put 'em in the freezer.

47
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,370
- My mouth is watering already.
- And I lined your vitamins up
on the counter.

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,379
- I don't take vitamins.
- You do now.Just take them.

49
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,890
Oh, and I put fresh batteries
in the TV remote and set the
VCR timer so that you can watch--

50
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,170
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Am I missing something here?

51
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,259
I'm the parent. You're the child
running away to live by herself.

52
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,975
- I should be tellin' you how to live.
- Fine. How should I live?

53
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,058
Simple. Don't go.

54
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,378
I got that Irish Spring you like.
Oh. And, Dad, whatever you do--

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,412
- Don't do the laundry.
- Don't do the laundry.

56
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,008
Just leave it by the dryer, and I'll
do it when I come home every Sunday.

57
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,576
Oh, this is interesting. They say
the handrails on the subway system...

58
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,930
could one day lead
to an outbreak of plague.

59
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,099
Dad. Look.

60
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,688
You said I could be
whatever I wanna be.

61
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,175
I never said songwriter
in New York City. That's the exception.

62
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,976
You said anything,
and I believed you, so--

63
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,615
I'm not leavin' this house
without your support.

64
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,698
That's Gloria. What's it gonna be?

65
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,854
Violet, I saw how hard it was
for your mother when she didn't make it.

66
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,369
But if she was here,
she'd tell me to shut up...

67
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,970
wish you luck
and give you a big hug.

68
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,888
I'm not gonna give you a big hug,
and I'm not gonna wish you luck, but...

69
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,092
I am gonna shut up, sit here
with my coffee and pretend to be mad.

70
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,529
Is that okay?

71
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,690
This is the last of it.

72
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,857
- Honey, are you okay with that?
- Yeah, I got it. I got it.

73
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,939
Wait. All right.
That's everything.

74
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,530
- Let's hit it.
- Good luck.

75
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,530
There, I said it.

76
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,774
- Love you.
- I put some pepper spray in your purse.

77
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,939
Even if you're not sure,
just start spraying.

78
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,693
You know, you're not alone,
Mr Sanford.

79
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,890
Hey, you know, me and you
should have dinner sometime.

80
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,375
I'm lockin' the doors.

81
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,049
At first I was afraid
I was petrified

82
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,810
Kept thinkin'I could never
live without you by my side

83
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,491
Oh, no, not I
I will survive

84
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,454
As long as I have love to give
I know I'll be alive

85
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,573
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give

86
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,055
I will survive

87
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,057
I will survive

88
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,057
All right.
This is it.

89
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,930
What do you think?

90
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,620
I had a feeling
you were gonna need this.

91
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,528
- What are you doing?
- What? It's just some
emergency cash I saved up.

92
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,539
Honey, from the looks of this place,
I'd say this is our emergency.

93
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,493
Well, I'm not takin' it.

94
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,215
Fine, then.

95
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,412
I'm freezing your assets.

96
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,055
So, thanks for everything.
I'll call ya.

97
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,969
What is this?

98
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,333
It's just that all our lives,
you know, we always had one thing
in common, you and me.

99
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,655
What are you talking about?

100
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,658
It's like, you know we said
we wouldn't lose our virginity...

101
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,010
until we got married,
and that didn't happen.

102
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,817
And then we said we'd go
to college or junior college
or dental hygienist school, you know.

103
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,931
And that didn't happen.

104
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,738
We've never followed through
on a single thing, you know.

105
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,328
And I think that's
what makes us so special.

106
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,174
And this is why you're crying?

107
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,420
Well, a long time ago you told me
that you were gonna move to New York.

108
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,375
But everyone thought you'd just
stay in Jersey and get married
like me and Danny are gonna.

109
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,377
You know. And-- And look at you.

110
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,376
No matter what,
you really did it right...

111
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,377
and I'm so proud of you.

112
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,939
Enough! You hear me?

113
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,212
You be quiet! Enough in there!

114
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,298
I don't like to

115
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,332
Be alone in the night

116
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,213
And I don't like to

117
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,332
Hear I'm wrong when I'm right

118
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,497
And I don't like to

119
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,293
Have the rain on my shoe

120
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,371
Hi. I'm Violet Sanford.
I just recently moved to New York...

121
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,253
and I was wondering if you would
give my tape to one of your artists.

122
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,450
Violet, that is so cute.

123
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,653
Now, let me tell you about me.
My name is Wendy,
and I first moved to New York...

124
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,169
when I was 2 1 to be a dancer,
but I broke my big toe.

125
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,736
And then I got knocked up by this actor
who dumped me to join the Peace Corps.

126
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,455
So for the last 1 6 years I been
raisin' my daughter all by myself.

127
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,619
And then two weeks ago
she tells me that she is a bisexual...

128
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,052
and that she hates me more
than any person on this planet.

129
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,174
Now, tell me how I can
help you, please...

130
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,612
because I am dying
to make your dreams come true.

131
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,735
You don't take the tape
unless it comes from an agent...

132
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,771
but I can't get an agent
until I get published?

133
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,619
If we were to listen to that tape,
that would give you grounds...

134
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,129
for a copyright
or plagiarism lawsuit.

135
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,809
It's just a little tape.
All I want is someone to sing my songs.

136
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,010
Welcome to the music business.

137
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,097
- Good evening. I.D., please.
- Hi. Uh, sure.

138
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,496
Maybe

139
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,453
Find a way to

140
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,935
Make it back someday

141
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,255
- What can I get you?
- Let me ask you something.

142
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,816
I'm a songwriter. Is there someone
here I could talk to about my songs?

143
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,374
I've been a struggling
sax player for 1 2 years.

144
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,697
- What can I get you from the bar?
- Pepsi and some crackers.

145
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,974
Hey. How are you doing?

146
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,819
Then I hope there's
someone out there

147
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,455
Excuse me.
Who's that guy?

148
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,657
That would be Mr O'Donnell.

149
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,096
Mr O'Donnell.
He's the manager or something?

150
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,499
Yeah. He's the music manager. He's
in charge of, uh, finding bands and...

151
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,180
booking new talent.

152
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,499
Run away with my heart

153
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,613
Run away with my hope

154
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,617
Hey, where the hell were you,
O'Donnell?

155
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,208
I got 1 5 orders stacked up here
and nobody to run the grill.

156
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,379
Fifteen orders, Walt. Is that it?
Give me ten minutes, I'll catch us up.

157
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,731
Go on. Lie down. Relax.

158
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,579
You look tired.
We can talk about my raise later.

159
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,295
You think this is Australia?
There's no raise. I'm about to fire you.

160
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,574
Um, excuse me.
Mr O'Donnell?

161
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,260
- Yes.
- Mr O'Donnell. My name is
Violet Sanford. I'm a songwriter.

162
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,371
I just wanted to give this to you.

163
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,775
I know it's not the most
professional way to submit a tape.

164
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,371
- But this is all pretty new to me.
- It's pretty new to me too.

165
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,449
I just figured as the manager
of a club like this, you must know
every band on the East Coast.

166
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,697
The manager of this club.

167
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,977
- You guys go ahead. I'll catch up.
- Sure thing...

168
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,739
Mr O'Donnell.

169
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,976
I don't usually do this, Violet...

170
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,013
um, but I-- I have
a feeling about you.

171
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,576
So I'm gonna take your tape,
and I'm gonna see what I can do.

172
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,373
Thank you.

173
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,650
I can't believe
how easy this was.

174
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,419
Neither can I.

175
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,373
Uh, you wanna go for, uh,
some coffee or something?

176
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,209
O'Donnell, who do I look like,
your goddam maid?

177
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,174
That's Mr O'Donnell,
but I'll let it slide this time.

178
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,578
I told you to take
your stuff home and wash it.
You got cow grease caked on the front.

179
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,172
Walt, I've warned you
about your attitude. You're fired.

180
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,815
Oh, you better not push me, kid.
I can find a hundred other
little punks like you...

181
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,693
who can burn a turkey burger.

182
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,856
Minimum wage punk.

183
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,772
Maybe we should start over.

184
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,970
I'm Kevin O'Donnell and...

185
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,218
I work the grill here
at the Fiji Mermaid Club.

186
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,969
I just made
a complete fool of myself.

187
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,378
I was gonna tell you.

188
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,618
I'm almost sure
I would have told you.

189
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,208
I just want you to know
I'm not following you home.

190
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,810
I'm just walking myself
26 blocks in the wrong direction.

191
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,376
- I asked you to leave me alone.
- Did I mention how sorry I am?

192
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,809
I mean, not that it's all my fault.
You did throw yourself at me.

193
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,138
I didn't throw myself at you.
I was pretending to be sweet and
innocent so you'd give me a break.

194
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,694
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

195
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,539
Is there a reason we just walked
in a circle? Are you lost?

196
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,494
I'm not lost.
Somebody just moved my street.

197
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,250
You wanna-- You wanna play a game?
I bet I can guess where you're from.

198
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,769
I'm about to get out
my pepper spray.

199
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,892
I reckon you're from a big city.
And there's no sign from here...

200
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,808
of a belly button ring
or a tongue piercing.

201
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,613
- I gotta go with Chicago.
- Okay.

202
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,494
I've never had anyone stare
at my ass for half an hour,
so I'm gonna say good night.

203
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,134
And I'm hoping
you're gonna say it back.

204
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,139
Okay. I can take a hint.

205
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,378
- I really do know a lot of people
in the music business.
- You just don't give up, do ya?

206
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,378
Well, it was the sweet and
innocent thing. It did me in.

207
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,014
- Good night, Kevin.
-Just for the record...

208
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,859
I was only staring at your ass
for the first 1 5 minutes.

209
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,896
- William Morris.
- I don't mean to interrupt.
I just wanna leave this--

210
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,696
- I'll transfer.
William Morris. Please hold.
- It's a demo. I'm a songwriter.

211
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,254
William Morris.
I'll be right with you.

212
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,174
I just want to leave this
for Whitney or Mariah.

213
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,098
- I'm sure they're
personal friends of yours.
- Look.

214
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,769
I'm sure it sounds great in your shower,
but karaoke ended a half hour ago.

215
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,210
So, if you'd like to get your songs
heard, you're gonna have to take them
to an open mic night...

216
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,173
just like everyone else.

217
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,333
William Morris. I'll transfer.
You're not getting validated.

218
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,495
Caught in a mirror

219
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,693
Looking through
sympathetic eyes

220
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,017
Can I help you?

221
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,735
Yeah, hi. Um, I'm sure all your spaces
are filled for tonight.

222
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,455
I just wanted to come down
and check out what this whole
open mic thing was about.

223
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,414
I can squeeze you in in ten minutes.
A couple of my regulars,
they called in sick.

224
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,250
So, uh, I've got some spaces to fill.
I need you to sign your name in here
and get yourself ready.

225
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,412
Bathroom's around the corner
if you want to throw up.

226
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,536
Next up we have a young lady
named Violet Sanford.

227
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,734
So let's put our hands together
for New Jersey's own Violet Sanford!
Come on up, Violet.

228
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,896
Good! There we go. Yeah.

229
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:23,333
Yea, Violet!

230
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,973
Oh, oops.

231
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,058
- I'm a little nervous.
- So are we, honey.

232
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,411
Don't tease me, honey!
Sing!

233
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,974
Come on, give her a break.

234
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,655
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

235
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,897
Hello?

236
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,936
You gotta cheer up. You look like
somebody ran over your dog.

237
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,099
Hey, um, how mu--
how much is a slice of pie?

238
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,097
Oh, uh...

239
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,530
we happen to have
the best French apple in town.

240
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,935
And, uh, it's on the house.

241
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,056
- Shut up.
- You just have to pay attention.

242
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,977
- Okay?
- Twenty.

243
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,252
- Twenty says it's Pretty Woman.
- I will raise you ten
because it is Home Alone.

244
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,530
- Oh?
- You guys have to read the signs.

245
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,254
I call with
Saving Private Ryan.

246
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,419
- What?
- Let's flip this over,
and Miss Jennifer from Austin...

247
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,055
says her favourite movie is--

248
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,729
No way. There's no way!
You already saw this one.

249
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,612
- Oh, you are such a cheater.
- Hello.

250
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,813
A naked girl in army boots?
Easy play to call.

251
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,330
- Thank you.
- Those boots are kind of cute.

252
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,339
I may have to get me some of those.

253
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,055
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, Romero.
You gotta turn that up, baby.
That is the jam.

254
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,855
- Turn it up!
There you go, there you go.
- Oh, no.

255
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,733
- Girl, what are you doing?
- Remember this? Remember this?

256
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,853
- You better get it, girl.
- Watch my belly dancing.

257
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,739
- Do you know those girls?
- Oh, yeah. They're here
every morning around this time.

258
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,215
- Winding down.
- Wait, wait, wait.

259
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,934
- They have to, in their line of work.
- Are they hookers?

260
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,130
- I've got the power
- No.

261
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,333
- Coyotes.
- I've got the power

262
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,139
- All right.
- You guys?

263
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,774
You guys wanna see
what Al gave me for my birthday?

264
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,454
- This.
- You let him brand you?

265
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,889
- Isn't it cute?
- She let the man brand her.

266
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,695
Hey, check it out, ladies.
We each made 300 bucks tonight.

267
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,334
You sure you wanna be
goin' off to law school?

268
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,576
Hmm?

269
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,931
- Let's make a toast.
- Yeah.

270
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,654
To Zoe's last week as a Coyote.

271
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,659
- Oh.
- She's gonna be
impossible to replace.

272
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,331
I just wanna tell you both
that I will never, ever forget you.

273
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,096
Who's up there?

274
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,930
- I'm lookin' for the owner.
- Hey, come on down.
Bring a case with you.

275
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,931
- What are you doin' here?
- Uh, I-I'm gonna drop this case.
Where do you want me to put it?

276
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,497
- That depends. What do ya want?
- Well, I heard you might
need a-- a new, uh--

277
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,373
That, uh, there might be
a job opening.

278
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,617
Put it right there.
Let me take a look at ya.

279
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,730
Let me guess.
Piedmont, North Dakota.

280
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,489
- South Amboy, New Jersey.
- Same thing.

281
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,851
You do any drugs?

282
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,178
Just coffee.
That's all I can afford right now.

283
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,610
- Let me see your arms.
- Are you kidding?

284
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,210
Do I look like I'm kidding?

285
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,729
Where'd you get
that scar on your wrist?

286
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,932
Pizza oven. It's a permanent burn
from pulling slices for four years.

287
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,177
That could be the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

288
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,339
- Um, what's next?
You want a urine sample?
- I prefer blood.

289
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,372
Look, are you really the owner? 'Cause
I've had a rough couple of days...

290
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,616
and so the last thing I need...

291
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,619
is some waitress on a power trip
wastin' my time.

292
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,856
You start Friday night. Be there
at 1 1 :00. That's when we get busy.

293
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:41,857
- You're givin' me a job?
- I'm givin' you an audition.
Don't be late,Jersey girl.

294
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,098
I don't mean to press my luck,
but would you mind telling me
why you're hiring me?

295
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,093
Because the, um, average male...

296
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,609
is walking around with a toddler
inside of his pants.

297
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,812
A two-year-old, right there
inside his Dockers.

298
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,933
Men have two-year-old children in their
pants? That's why you're hiring me?

299
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,938
You look like a kindergarten teacher.
The kids'll love it.

300
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,252
Sorry I asked.

301
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,529
- I.D., please.
- Oh. I'm supposed to
start work here tonight.

302
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,015
Go ahead. Hey, you picked
a good night to start.

303
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,815
- It's a little slow right now,
but it should pick up.
- Okay.

304
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,170
Love is like a bomb
Baby, come on get it on

305
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,656
Livin'like a lover
with a radar phone

306
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,294
- Lookin'like a tramp
Like a video vamp
- You are hot!

307
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,537
Demolition woman
Can I be your man

308
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,733
Is this a church meeting
or is this a bar? Make some noise!

309
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,900
- Yeah!
- Come on

310
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,976
- Want it?
- Take a bottle

311
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,694
Shake it up

312
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,257
Break the bubble
Break it up

313
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,249
Pour some sugar on me
In the name of love

314
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,898
Poor some sugar on me
Come on, fire me up

315
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,092
- Pour your sugar on me
- I'm sorry. Sorry!

316
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,735
- I don't think so.
-Just in time.

317
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,499
- Where you goin'?
- Uh, I was-- I was looking for you.

318
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,009
Good. Let's go.

319
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,091
Listen, red light, yellow light
green light, go

320
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,257
Crazy little woman
in a one-man show

321
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,735
Mirror queen, mannequin
rhythm of love

322
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,249
- Really love your top.
- Thanks.

323
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,010
- I got it, um, on sale--
- Loosen up, uh, loosen up

324
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,132
You gotta squeeze a little
squeeze a little, tease a little more

325
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,777
Okay. Hair.

326
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,052
Let's see your moves.

327
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,740
That's Rachel.
You can learn a lot from her.

328
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,771
She just cut some guy's ponytail off.

329
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,573
Yeah. The court ordered her
to take anger management classes...

330
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,215
after she pummelled a customer
for grabbin' her ass.

331
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,094
He pressed charges.
I gave her a raise. Cheers.

332
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,098
Pour some sugar on me

333
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,574
- There is only two rules, okay?
What do you want?
- Two beers.

334
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,577
- Don't date the customers.
- Okay.

335
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,010
Second, don't ever bring
your boyfriends into my bar.

336
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,974
As of this moment you are to appear
available, but never be available.

337
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,331
Break my rules,
Ifire you on the spot.

338
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,293
- I-- I understand.
-Jesus.

339
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,540
Hey! Hey, everybody!

340
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,413
Shut up!

341
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,134
I'd like you to meet
my new girl...

342
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,728
whose name is--

343
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,169
Violet.

344
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,768
Jersey.

345
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,449
Jersey is
an ex-kindergarten teacher...

346
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,175
and a former nun who just escaped
from the convent...

347
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,939
and is tired of being the only virgin
in New York City.

348
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,932
Would anyone like
to buy her a drink? Whoa!

349
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,093
- Come on, move! I'm workin' here.
- Sorry.

350
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,418
- Four margaritas with salt.
- All right.

351
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,929
Got tequila.
No mix, no salt, no blender.

352
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,496
- Okay, how about a black Russian?
- Got vodka, no Kahlua.

353
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,850
- White wine.
- Never carry the stuff.

354
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,939
- So basically you have--
-Jim,Jack,Johnny Red,
Johnny Black and Jose.

355
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:43,339
All my favourite men.
You can have it any way you like,
as long as it's in a shot glass.

356
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,610
Okay, I-I'll take a beer.

357
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,370
- Four dollars.
- I'm Cammie, the Russian tease.

358
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,730
Violet, the Jersey nun.

359
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,976
That one's Rachel,
the New York bitch.

360
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,059
We all play our little parts,
only Rachel really is a bitch.

361
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,216
And I really am a tease.

362
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,456
Cammie, you can only be a tease
if you stop sleepin' around, babe.

363
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,095
Yeah. I keep forgetting that part.

364
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,849
I'll have a shot of tequila, and don't
forget one for your pretty little self.

365
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,895
Oh, thanks, but ever since
I got really drunk on tequila,
I never really drink the stuff any more.

366
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,535
Hey, Lil! Your new girl's refusing
your good booze.

367
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,493
No! I was-- I-I was suggesting
this gentleman buy me a double.

368
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,339
That's more like it.

369
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,537
I need eight shots. Four Canadian,
four South of the Border...

370
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,811
six-pack MGD
and a double-blended back.

371
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,896
- You want eight shots of what?
- I got it.

372
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,609
- Forty-six even, honey.
- Hey, Lil! Yo!

373
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,652
Your Jersey girl
can't quite keep up.

374
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,169
Hey, give me a Scotch and water.

375
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,373
- Okay, you got it.
- Lil, do we serve water
with our whisky?

376
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,889
Only water I serve's got
barley and hops in it!

377
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,854
Hey, everybody!
Do we serve water in this bar?

378
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,496
Hell no, H2O!
Hell no, H2O!

379
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,251
Hell no, H2O!
Hell no, H2O!

380
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,693
Sink or swim time,Jersey.
Get up there!

381
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,050
The devil's in the house
of the rising sun

382
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,530
I can't do that dance.

383
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,898
Granny, does your dog bite
No, child, no

384
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,056
Okay.

385
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:45,570
- Here's some cash.
You did okay for a nun.
- You're firing me?

386
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,009
I told you this was an audition.

387
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,529
Thanks for comin' in.
Now, get outta here.

388
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,175
Johnny said, Devil, just come on back
if you ever wanna try again

389
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,497
I done told you once, you son of a bitch
I'm the best there's ever been

390
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,896
He played fire on the mountain
Run, boy, run

391
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,056
Devil's in the house
of the risin'sun

392
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,057
Please!

393
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,852
- Back off!
- Hey!

394
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,814
Guys, guys, back off, back off! Look,
the way I see it, you got two choices.

395
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,649
You can start a fight here,
throw some punches, get a bloody nose,
make complete fools of yourselves...

396
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,772
or you can take this ten bucks
I got right here...

397
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,051
and buy, uh, these two pretty ladies
a round at the bar.

398
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,774
- Come on. What do you say?
- Let's go to the bar!

399
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,972
Party!

400
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,695
Hold it,Jersey. I'm just dyin'
to know where that came from.

401
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,018
Try serving a beer and pizza
on Monday nights when the Giants
play the Cowboys in November.

402
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,017
I'm giving you
a second audition.

403
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,418
There's a store at the corner of Sixth
and Hill. Be there at noon tomorrow.

404
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,452
I'm sending my fashion coordinator there
to take you shopping.

405
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,650
Now go home
before I change my mind.

406
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,819
Hey, and,Jersey. I'd be shocked
if you survive another night.

407
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,170
Granny, will your dog bite
No, child, no

408
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,097
Here we go!

409
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,929
And left, and right,
clog, clog, clog.

410
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,409
Oh, yeah!

411
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,130
So, uh, tell me more about this bar.
What kind of place is it?

412
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,014
It's-- I don't know.
It's just a bar, Dad.

413
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,700
It's no big deal.
What are you eating?

414
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,213
One of those Lean Cuisine meals.
Rice and vegetables. Delicious.

415
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,410
Oh! See, they're good. Right?

416
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,452
Mmm. Yum.

417
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,652
So, yeah, well, what's going on
with your songwriting?

418
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,453
Songwriting. Oh!
He still has my tape.

419
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,370
Dance, dance, dance

420
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,771
Dance

421
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,858
I want my tape.

422
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,016
I had a feeling
you'd be back to see me.

423
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,257
- No dates in the kitchen, O'Donnell.
- I'm not staying.

424
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,735
I-- I just want my tape.

425
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,375
Please.

426
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,015
- Thanks. Bye.
- Did you really write all those songs?

427
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,733
You listened to my tape?

428
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:19,138
No, of course not. I mean,
that would be invasion of privacy.

429
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,615
Baby, you're the right kind of love

430
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,335
Go ahead. Laugh it up.
'Cause there's nothing you can
say that's gonna bother me.

431
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,530
I'm just trying to tell you
I like your music.

432
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,732
I mean, do you always
take compliments so well?

433
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,339
- I gotta go.
- Wait! Uh--

434
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,133
I wanna see you again.
Where are you workin'?

435
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,935
- I'm a Coyote.
- Good.

436
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,690
- And what the hell is that?
- If you want to see me again,
you'll figure it out.

437
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,769
That good? Uh-huh.

438
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,136
Sorry I'm late.
Al and I had a big fight.

439
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,457
And then we made up, twice.

440
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,214
You're the fashion coordinator?

441
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,458
Lil told me to get you something
that would make the kiddies drool.

442
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,457
Trust me, Violet.

443
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,573
I have a serious
shopping problem.

444
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,215
- It has a zipper in the crotch.
- Yeah.

445
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,456
Who would wear that in public?

446
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,616
- Actually, I have it in blue.
- You're unbelievable

447
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,776
Oh

448
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,370
You burden me
with your problems

449
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,650
By telling me more about mine

450
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,816
I'm always so concerned

451
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,374
With the way you say
you always have to stop

452
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,732
To think of us being one
is more than I ever know

453
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,852
The things you say

454
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,813
- You're unbelievable
- Oh

455
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,816
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

456
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,091
Seemingly lastless
Don't mean you can ask us

457
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,017
Pushing down the relative
Bringing out your higher self

458
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,893
And everything anger to brace yourself
with the grace of ease

459
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,652
- I know this world ain't what it seems
- It's unbelievable

460
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,819
You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies

461
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,329
- The things you say
- Oh, yeah!

462
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,048
- You're unbelievable
- Oh

463
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,973
Here I am! Yeah, baby!

464
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,058
You're unbelievable

465
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,530
Come on! Knock it--
Hey! Knock it off!

466
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,254
Lil! The ice!

467
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,933
How do you like that, huh?

468
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,535
There's every good reason
for hanging around

469
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,174
I don't know how you guys do it.
I can't have another drink.

470
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,178
Next time a guy buys you a shot--
That's on me, honey.

471
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,256
Chase it with a beer.

472
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,817
- I don't get it.
- I don't swallow it.

473
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,818
I just spit the shot back into
the beer bottle. They'll never know.

474
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,329
You try it.

475
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,928
Hey, just keep an eye
on your spittoon bottle.

476
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:27,372
Once Rachel served hers to Lou
by accident. Huge drama.

477
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,253
Cammie, I think I just fell
in love with you.

478
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,940
Oh, Violet!
I'm not a lesbian.

479
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,609
I've played in the minors,
but never went pro.

480
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,129
- Th-That's not what I meant.
- What are you doing?

481
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,969
Lil's starin' straight at you. Come on.
Grab this guy. Make yourself look busy.

482
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,252
- Hi. You look like
you could use a shot.
- No, I'm waiting on Lil.

483
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,259
Sorry. It's a no parking zone. If you
wanna sit here, you gotta order a drink.

484
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,816
- Okay. Give me a glass of water.
- Okay.

485
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,329
- He just ordered water.
- Yeah.

486
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,655
You know what to do.

487
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,972
T-Testing. Um, hey, everybody,
this guy just ordered water.

488
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,614
Do we serve water in our bar?

489
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,938
Hell no, H20!
Hell no, H2O!

490
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,137
Jersey! No!

491
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,296
It's okay, Lil!
Nobody orders water in your bar!

492
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,174
He can order whatever he wants.
He's the fire marshal.

493
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,132
- Hey, Mike, I'm so sorry. She's new.
- I'm okay. Let's step outside.

494
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,929
- Party
- Nice knowing you,Jersey.

495
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,735
- Get naked
- Come on, you guys! Let me hear you!

496
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,611
You okay?

497
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,857
- Who am I kidding? I can't do this.
- Of course you can.

498
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,292
Now cheer up because there's a really
cute guy at the bar asking for you.

499
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,331
Somebody's asking for me?

500
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,894
He says his name
is Mr O'Donnell.

501
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,816
He's hot.

502
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,296
Jersey. The fire marshal
threatened to shut me down.

503
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,412
- He let me go with a $250 fine.
- Lil, I'm really sorry--

504
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,691
I'll make you a deal. You figure out
a way to make me 250 tonight...

505
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,936
I'll let you come back tomorrow.

506
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,413
Great.

507
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,094
So much for sweet and innocent.

508
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,691
- So, you found me.
- Some guys at work told me
where I could, uh, look for Coyotes.

509
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,529
Well, take a good look,
because tonight's my last night.
I think I'm gonna get fired.

510
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,697
- Why?
- 'Cause I have to make $250
in two hours.

511
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,697
It's completely impossible.

512
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,569
Here's nine dollars,
just to get you started. Okay?

513
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,931
I always like to help
a friend in need.

514
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,778
Why are you looking at me like that?

515
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,130
Kevin, I don't want your money.

516
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,932
All right, uh, listen up. Ladies.

517
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,292
The bidding will start at $25
for one night only.

518
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,095
You get this purebred,
house broken...

519
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,610
fully trained, yowling stud.

520
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,210
- No way.
- That's pretty cheap.

521
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,969
- Violet, what are you doing?
- You said you wanted to help,
so, turn around, sir...

522
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,739
let 'em take a look at ya.

523
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,775
- Why-- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's payback time, Mr O'Donnell.

524
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,733
Now, turn around.

525
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:36,490
- No, God, no. Don't-- Don't do this.
- Go on. Show 'em what you got.

526
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,736
- Are you in?
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna do this?

527
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,055
- All right, ladies.
What'll you give me?
- I've got twenty bucks.

528
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,020
I've got--
I've got $25 right here.

529
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,257
Make it 35!

530
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,336
Thirty-five dollars!

531
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,493
- Forty dollars!
- Get-- What are you doing?
- Forty dollars!

532
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,851
- Come on, girls, fifty?
- Fifty!

533
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,733
- Sixty-one dollars.
- I've got 70.

534
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,454
- Come on, girls. Seventy-five?
- Seventy-five dollars!

535
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,415
Eighty dollars! Eighty dollars!
Come on, girls. Do I hear 85?

536
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,690
Ninety! Ninety-five dollars!

537
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,971
- One hundred dollars, baby!
- One hundred dollars.

538
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,178
That's it.
You wanna come home with Mama?

539
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,531
Whoa! Nice!

540
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,730
Oh, yeah!

541
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,055
That's my boy.

542
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,013
- Oh, yeah. Shake it, shake it.
- $ 1 25 back here!

543
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,133
$ 1 40, right here.
Come on, come on.

544
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,808
My goodness, girls, come on.
One fifty and you'll see the butt.

545
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,374
Come on, girls.
You can do better than this.

546
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,776
- One seventy-five.
- Yeah!

547
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,370
There we go.
Two hundred dollars!

548
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,290
- You've got 2 1 5 right here!
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.

549
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,378
Sold, for $250!

550
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,576
- No!
- Come on up, honey. He's yours.

551
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:15,375
- Damn you.
- The blonde would have gone 2 7 5.

552
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,410
- Come with me.
- You're gonna owe me
big-time for this one.

553
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,134
That's 250 even.

554
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:38,371
I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya
meet ya, meet ya one day

555
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,219
Maybe next week
I'm gonna meet ya

556
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,615
I'll meet ya
I'll meet ya

557
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,571
Better close out, girls.

558
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,770
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

559
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,688
What-- What does
"Coyote Ugly'' mean?

560
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,976
Did you ever wake up sober
after a one-night stand...

561
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,012
and the person you're next to is layin'
on your arm, and they're so ugly...

562
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,415
you'd rather chew off
your arm than risk wakin' them?

563
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,100
- That's coyote ugly.
- My God.
- Let's go, ladies.

564
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,529
Well, why would you name
your bar after something like that?

565
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,732
- Well, because "Cheers'' was taken.
- All right, come on.

566
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,691
Cabs are out front.

567
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,731
- You're rich,Jersey.
- See ya.

568
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,169
Have a good night.

569
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,612
The woman who purchased me
is named Sandy Rosenfeld,
a divorcee with three grown kids...

570
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,369
a passion for long walks
and short-haired hunting dogs
and Italian opera.

571
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,812
Her ex-husband is a CPA.
Her favourite artist is van Gogh...

572
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,855
and her New Year's resolution is to lose
1 5 pounds and to see Barbra in concert.

573
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,054
Okay. I owe you.
What do you want?

574
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,377
Well, it's, uh, 3:30 in the morning.
I want what every man wants.

575
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,692
Breakfast.

576
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,970
And that's it? I go to breakfast
with you, and we're even?

577
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,978
No. We're not even close to even,
because I danced on a bar...

578
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,933
I took off my shirt,
and I unzipped my pants.

579
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,053
Okay. Let's make a deal.
Breakfast and lunch.

580
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,934
- Breakfast, lunch and two dinners.
- That's four dates!

581
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,654
Yep. Which would make it the second
longest relationship I've ever had.

582
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,931
Get in the car.

583
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,815
Oh, I hate to spoil your evening, but it
looks like we're not gonna go anywhere.

584
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,616
Oh, my God.

585
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,690
It's hard to find parking
in New York.

586
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,970
You ever eaten Turkish?
This is the place.

587
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,137
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hi, Kevin. How are you?

588
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,330
- Four of the regular?
- Sure, yeah. Hey.

589
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,055
- Hey, Kevin.
- How you doin', man?
- How are you, buddy?
- Good.

590
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,694
Here it is, man.
Flown in from Miami.

591
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,209
- Check out the merchandise.
- Hey, man, no. I trust you.

592
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,217
All right, all right.

593
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,258
Look, uh, I don't know
what you're into, but--

594
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,134
The Amazing Spider-Man,
number 1 29, mint condition.

595
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,694
- Worth a thousand bucks.
- A comic book.

596
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,017
No, it's not just a comic book.
This is the first appearance
of the Punisher.

597
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,415
This is the holy grail
of comic books.

598
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,179
- You collect comic books.
That's so cute.
- Yeah.

599
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,339
It's not cute.
It's very rugged and manly.

600
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,339
- It's just a bit geeky. Huh?
- I think it's sweet.

601
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,935
So, do you always eat breakfast
on the hood of your car?

602
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,255
What can I say?
I'm a romantic.

603
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,769
You think this is romantic?

604
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,858
Well, you may not be feeling it now,
but I think one day...

605
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,609
you'll be on stage singing
a song about this very night.

606
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,379
"When We Were Downwind
From a Trash Barge.''

607
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,298
Yeah. Catchy title.
Hum a few bars.

608
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,210
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm a songwriter, not a singer.

609
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,808
When I get on stage,
I freeze.

610
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,296
What if the fate of the free world
rested on your voice?

611
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,651
Okay. If the fate of the free
world depended on me singing...

612
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,736
maybe.

613
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,533
All I ever really wanted
is to sit in the dark...

614
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,096
and hear someone great
singing my songs.

615
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,097
I wanna be the one
who writes the music.

616
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,777
I remember the first time
my mother played me
"Bridge Over Troubled Water''...

617
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,017
by Simon and Garfunkel.

618
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,529
I remember exactly
what she was wearing.

619
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,688
I remember exactly how her hair smelled.
And I remember exactly how I felt.

620
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,210
And every time
I hear that song...

621
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,979
I remember exactly
what she was wearing...

622
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,534
and exactly
how her hair smelled...

623
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,413
and exactly how I felt.

624
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,135
'Cause the great songs last forever.

625
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,377
- So, what's the problem?
- Well...

626
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,094
now they're telling me
the only way to get my songs heard...

627
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,450
is to go out there
and sing 'em myself.

628
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,731
So we're gonna have to try and fix
this little problem straight away.

629
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,648
- And how do you propose we do that?
- Well, is there any place
you feel comfortable singing?

630
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,893
- The shower.
- We'll start there.

631
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,330
I mean, I don't care how long
it takes, how many hours
we have to spend in that shower.

632
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,611
- Let's get to it.
- Okay. Before we hit the showers...

633
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,334
maybe you could tell me
a little something about yourself.

634
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,496
Oh, really?
What do you wanna know?

635
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,531
What part of Australia
are you from?

636
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,379
I'm from all over.
My family moved around a lot.

637
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,810
- So the rest of your family
doesn't live in New York?
- Do you always ask this many questions?

638
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,056
Do you always dodge
this many questions?

639
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,172
You can at least tell me
where you got all the moves
you pulled on the bar tonight.

640
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,655
Well, if I told you,
I'd-- I'd have to kill you.

641
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,289
- That's original.
- Oh.

642
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,650
The sun's coming up.
We're gonna be late.

643
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,771
Late? Late for what?

644
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,292
This is incredible.

645
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,459
- Look at that fish!
- All right. Put this on.
You're gonna need it.

646
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:43,858
- Why? What are you talking about?
- You're gonna help me unload
the next bin.

647
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,574
- You're joking, right?
- No. It's not that bad, Vi.

648
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,578
- I do it all the time.
- Exactly how many jobs do you have?

649
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,260
Tuesday through Saturday,
I'm at the club.

650
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,019
Sunday and Monday
I park cars at the Plaza.

651
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,859
I've been a telemarketer.
Would you like to switch to AT&T?

652
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:02,735
And for six terrifying hours
I delivered phone books in Queens.

653
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,090
Don't forget your
extensive work in fish.

654
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,256
This is an expensive city,
and these guys pay cash.

655
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,770
I don't care if they pay in lobster. I'm
not sticking my hands in that fishy bin.

656
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,698
I was gonna split the money with you.

657
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,538
- A hundred bucks apiece.
- A hundred bucks?

658
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,697
- Wait, wait. Why-Why didn't you say so?
- Thanks, Dan.
- Wait.

659
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,890
- You're not ready, are you?
- No.
- Fifty bucks. Twenty-five.
- Okay.

660
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,488
- Ten.
- Okay. Yeah.
- Ready? Huh?
- Okay. Uh-huh.

661
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,576
That is disgusting!

662
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,932
Hey, you'll hurt their feelings. Okay.
Just on top of the other fish. Yeah.

663
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,533
So, I know
I just met you a few days ago.
There's something I have to tell you.

664
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,379
You smell really bad.

665
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,335
Well, so do you. I mean,
I was gonna kiss you goodbye,
but, um, I thought I might gag.

666
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,816
You're a real charmer.

667
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,809
- Okay. Good night.
- Good morning.

668
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,340
Don't look at me like that.

669
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,851
Spend it.

670
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,649
- What are you doing here?
- I changed my mind about this kiss.

671
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,294
I think we should give it a shot.

672
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,537
Well, have a nice day.

673
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,730
"Have a nice day''?

674
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:56,136
Yeah. I panicked.
I didn't know what else to say.

675
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,497
Have a nice day.

676
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,858
I wanna get in.
I wanna dance with my friend.

677
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,574
All right. Back of the line over here.
Back of the line.

678
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,170
Yeah! Whoa!

679
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,499
Whoo!

680
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,413
- Yeah, I like it!
- Yeah!

681
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,850
- Hey, baby!
- Make a hole. Make a hole!
Lou, nobody--

682
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,052
- Shit, the cops are here.
- Nobody else gets in here.
Look at this place.

683
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,729
Hey, Lil. I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do here.
You're 50 people over max.

684
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,215
Try to shut us down,
they'll tear the place apart. Come on.

685
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,252
Let's go outside and talk.
I'll take care of it.

686
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,372
Hey! Hey!

687
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,570
This is not a gas pump, son!

688
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,210
Wait your turn!

689
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,974
- Hey, no pictures, man!
- Hey, I'm a reporter from The Voice.

690
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,738
Yeah!

691
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,613
Whoo!

692
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,696
What are you doing? Hey!

693
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,617
- Put me down!
- Hey!

694
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,889
- Put me down!
- Cammie!

695
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,215
- Help!
- Come on! Let her go!

696
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,296
Rachel, help!

697
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,857
Come on, boys!
Come on! Break it up!

698
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,175
- Lou, where's Rachel and Cammie?
- I don't know!

699
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,578
Let me go!

700
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,538
Jersey, they're tearing
this place apart!

701
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,096
- Rachel! Rachel!
- One way or another I'm gonna find ya

702
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,893
- I'm gonna get ya, get ya
get ya, get ya
- Let me go!

703
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,137
One way or another
I'm gonna get ya

704
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,171
I'm gonna get ya, get ya
get ya, get ya

705
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,690
One way or another
I'm gonna see ya

706
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,653
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya
meet ya, meet ya, one day

707
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,216
Maybe next week
I'm gonna meet ya

708
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,012
I'll meet ya, I'll meet ya

709
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,290
I will

710
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,049
Drive past your house

711
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,810
And if the lights are all out

712
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,775
- I'll see who's around
- Ooh!

713
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,731
One way or another

714
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,452
I'm gonna find ya

715
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,333
I'm gonna get ya, get ya
get ya, get ya, one way

716
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,577
- I'm talking about that!
- Or another I'm gonna win ya

717
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,497
I'm gonna get ya, I'll get ya

718
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,532
One way or another
I'm gonna see ya

719
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,379
- Yeah!
- I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya
meet ya, meet ya

720
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,491
One day, maybe next week

721
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,895
- I'm gonna meet ya, I'll meet ya
- Yeah!

722
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,057
- Great. Yeah.
- Last call, Lil.

723
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:08,138
- Start clearin' 'em out.
- You got it.

724
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,488
Let's go.

725
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:15,178
One way or another
I'm gonna lose ya

726
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,497
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna give you the slip
A slip of the hip

727
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,054
Or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna trick ya

728
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,059
- Ya-hoo!
- One way or another

729
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,297
I'm gonna lose ya, I'm gonna trick ya
trick ya, trick ya, trick ya

730
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,016
Did you see their faces?
I mean, wow.

731
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,450
They all wanted you, honey.
Even the girls.

732
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,810
Not a dry seat in the house.

733
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,569
You guys, that was, like,
a one-time performance--

734
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,656
- Hmm?
- That I have to repeat,
like, every night.

735
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,850
Ya-hoo!

736
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,495
She sang along with a jukebox.
Let's not start polishing a Grammy.

737
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:56,896
Oh, come on, Rach.
She saved your butt. Admit it.

738
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,774
No. She saved me from kicking the shit
out of a couple of drunks.

739
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,414
- That's it.
- Ooh.
- Ooh, that was good.

740
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,619
- Where you goin'?
- I don't know.

741
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,016
I gotta walk or celebrate or--

742
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,210
Ugh, pass out or something.

743
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,172
Hey, ladies and gent...

744
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:19,612
how about a big round of applause
for the singing Coyote from Jersey!

745
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,379
- So I'm a Coyote?
- Five nights a week.

746
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,698
Hey, what is it?
What's wrong?

747
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,617
Why would anything
be wrong?

748
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,291
Um, you called me in the middle of the
night and said there was an emergency.

749
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,457
What was that for?

750
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,492
I had a good night.
I wanted a good-night kiss.

751
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,054
Well, wait a second.
Where are you going?

752
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,933
Have a nice day,
Mr O'Donnell.

753
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,857
"Have a nice day''?

754
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,133
Right kind of wrong

755
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,854
Right kind of wrong

756
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,540
We likes to party
La-la-di-da-di

757
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,335
On the East Coast
is the place to be

758
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,854
We likes to party
La-la-di-da-di

759
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,210
Lovin'you

760
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,812
- We likes to party
- Isn't really something I should do

761
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,773
I should try to be strong

762
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,015
Isn't really something
I should do

763
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:49,056
Shouldn't want to spend
my time with you

764
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,059
I should try to be strong

765
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,411
But, baby,
you're the right kind of wrong

766
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,210
Baby, you're the right kind
of wrong

767
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,769
What's going on?
Why do we need my guitar?

768
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,858
You'll find out soon enough.
No. This way.

769
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,369
Okay, now there's a seat.

770
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,776
Just there. Uh-huh?
Okay?

771
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,811
Take a look.

772
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,374
Your fans wanna hear you sing.

773
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,489
I told you. I-I can't sing my own songs.
I never could.

774
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,977
Well, that's too bad, because they've
requested to hear your songs.

775
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,660
Be gentle on the keyboard.
I borrowed it from the club.

776
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,176
You did all this
just to help me sing?

777
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,088
I thought maybe we could cure that
stage fright I've heard so much about.

778
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,176
Kevin, I wish you could.

779
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,409
Come on. Let me try.

780
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,496
Tell me what it feels like.

781
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,096
You really wanna know?

782
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,698
Yeah.

783
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,010
You asked for it.

784
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,812
What are you doing?

785
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,657
The only way I can show you...

786
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,216
is to make you...

787
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:19,219
really nervous.

788
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,098
The first thing that happens...

789
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,610
is my heart starts to race.

790
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,014
Good.

791
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,734
Racing heart. Yep.

792
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,976
- Got it.
- And then...

793
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,537
my entire body starts shaking.

794
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,849
Shaking body.
I'm-- I'm getting that. Yeah.

795
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,777
And...

796
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,617
then everything gets a bit...

797
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,819
cloudy.

798
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,932
Clouds are definitely
rolling in.

799
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,095
Then I start...

800
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,017
losing control.

801
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,139
Well, how long
does this usually last?

802
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,774
Oh, it's been known
to last all night.

803
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,329
- That must be horrible.
- It's excruciating.

804
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,698
I think that audience got more
than they paid for, really.

805
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,176
What's "L.M.S.'' stand for?

806
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,575
Lynn Marie Sanford.

807
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,294
It was my mom's guitar.

808
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,615
She died five years ago.

809
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,254
She moved to New York to be
a singer when she was my age.

810
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,735
She came pretty close
to the big time.

811
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,612
Well, what happened?

812
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,771
She hated the stage.

813
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,176
She said it was
the scariest place in the world.

814
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,131
Sounds familiar.

815
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,612
You really want me to sing?

816
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,810
Just tell me
what I have to do.

817
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,338
Disappear.

818
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,776
All right. No problem.

819
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,619
I don't like to

820
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,573
Be alone in the night

821
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,168
I don't like to

822
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,212
Hear I'm wrong
when I'm right

823
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:43,173
And I don't like to

824
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,097
Have the rain on my shoes

825
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:50,374
But I do love you

826
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,617
But I do love

827
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,049
You

828
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,333
I don't like to

829
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,258
See a sky painted grey

830
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,338
And I don't like when

831
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,849
Nothing's going my way

832
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:14,373
And I don't like to be
the one with the blues but I do--

833
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,094
If you wanna write a song, if you want
to be like a serious songwriter...

834
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,972
you simply gotta go
with the Mac.

835
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,331
Laptop. You can lay your tracks down
on a blank CD, and you're done.

836
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,497
Do you--
Do you have a payment plan?

837
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,770
The way you lay your head upon

838
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,494
- Play ball! Let's go!
- My shoulder when you sleep

839
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,175
Come on, Cammie!

840
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:39,533
Oh, I do

841
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,296
And I don't like to

842
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,650
Hear I'm wrong when I'm right

843
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:49,216
And I don't like to

844
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,137
Have the rain on my shoes

845
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:56,254
But I do love you

846
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,452
Jeez! What are you doing?

847
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,296
What are you,
brain damaged?

848
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:11,890
You know what kind of maniacs
we got driving through here?
They don't stop for nothin'.

849
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,534
- Whose boat?
- I borrowed it from a friend.

850
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,616
Yeah?
Looks like a guy's car to me.

851
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:21,689
- How can you tell?
- I've been staring at cars
every day for the last 1 6 years.

852
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,890
- Who is he?
- He's a friend.

853
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,659
Look, I brought you a turkey sandwich,
no mayo, extra sprouts.

854
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,452
Thank you. Great.

855
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,175
I'm starvin'.
Now tell me about this bar.

856
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,609
Is it a bunch of bankers
havin' martinis after work?

857
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,810
I gotta go. Look.
I love you.

858
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,170
I love you too. Be careful.

859
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,292
Hey, do I come to your office
and honk? Come on!

860
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:51,373
I got you a gig. There's this
club where a lot of music people
hang out called The Elbow Room.

861
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:56,415
My friend's the manager.
He owes me a favour,
and you're it, next Thursday night.

862
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,610
Are you forgetting
about the stage fright?

863
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,095
Uh, what about the bar?

864
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,451
Come on, Kevin. All I do
is sing along with the jukebox.

865
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:09,096
See? You're making progress.
A few more nights at my place,
and you'll be cured.

866
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:13,577
I hate to burst your bubble,
but I'll never be cured. It's genetic.

867
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,249
Stage fright DNA.
Yes, I saw that on ER last week.

868
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:21,009
Okay. Laugh all you want, but my mom
couldn't do it, and neither can I.

869
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,654
So was your mother afraid
to try?

870
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,136
Look, I just wanna be a songwriter.
Why won't you give up on this?

871
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,536
Because I've been giving up
on people my entire life,
and it's a nasty little habit.

872
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,254
So, you're gonna sing
at the club, or I'll--

873
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,769
Or you'll what?

874
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,494
I'll never kiss you again.

875
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,611
That sounds like a threat,
Mr O'Donnell.

876
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,810
Well, let's just say...

877
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:46,615
it's gonna be quite a long,
cold winter.

878
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:47,968
That's supposed to convince me?

879
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:51,376
It's working, isn't it?
Your knees are getting weak.

880
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,378
- I'll think about it.
- Try again.

881
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,570
Uh, I'll see
if I can get off work.

882
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,691
You're gettin' warmer.

883
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:02,051
All right. You win. I'll do it.

884
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,057
Oh, I love winning.

885
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,293
Pour some sugar on me

886
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,935
- Pour your sugar on me
- Hey, we have a special treat...

887
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,857
for you tonight,
boys and girls.

888
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,335
- Look who dropped by for a visit.
- Pour some sugar on me

889
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,894
- Get up there, Zoe!
- No!

890
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:23,933
I'm a paying customer tonight.
I have class in the morning.
What are you doing?

891
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,972
- Come on, Zoe!
- No!

892
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,489
Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! Zoe!

893
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:38,778
- Zoe! Zoe! Zoe!
- Time to get wet, girls. Whoo!

894
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,892
Well, I'm packin'up my game
and I'm gonna head out West

895
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,614
Where real women come equipped
with scripts and fake breasts

896
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,812
Find a nest in the hills
Chill like Flynt

897
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:51,057
Buy an old drop top
Find a spot to pimp

898
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,171
- Well, I'm Kid Rock
and I'm the real McCoy
- Who wants some of this?

899
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:58,658
And I'm headed out West, sucker
because I wanna be a cowboy, baby

900
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,533
With the top let back
and the sunshine shinin'

901
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:04,458
Cowboy, baby

902
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:07,140
Ride at night
'cause I sleep all day

903
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,696
- Excuse me.
Does Violet Sanford work here?
- Yeah, she's on the bar.

904
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,617
- She's on what?
- She's on the bar.

905
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,493
- What do you guys say?
- Yeah!

906
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,775
Yeah, Kid Rock
You can call me Tex

907
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,937
Rollin'sunset women
with a bottle of Beck's

908
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,778
Seen a slimmy in a 'vette
Rolled down my glass

909
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,097
And said, "Yeah, this dick's
fittin'right in your ass''

910
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,292
I'm flickin'my Bic
up and down that coast and

911
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,615
- Keep on truckin'
till it falls into motion
- Dad! Wait!

912
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,653
- Cowboy
- Dad, it's not as bad as it looks.

913
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:42,295
- And the sunshine shinin'
- Daddy, it's not as bad as it looks.

914
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,773
I just sing here every night.

915
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,812
- People come here to see me.
- Cowboy!

916
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,172
- Say something!
- The guys are putting
your picture up in their booths!

917
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,975
- I gotta go, get up early.
- Dad, it's just a bar.

918
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,933
- You can trust me.
- But you're my daughter.

919
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,453
I can smell a pig
from a mile away

920
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,094
Cowboy

921
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,814
With the top let back
and the sunshine shinin'

922
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,012
Cowboy

923
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:14,849
Cowboy

924
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,414
Hi, you've reached Bill Sanford.

925
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:21,419
Please leave a message
when you hear the beep.

926
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,532
Dad, you can't avoid me
for the rest of your life.

927
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:28,699
I have to come over and do your laundry.
We both know you're
running out of clean shirts.

928
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:32,972
I bet the one you're wearing
stinks pretty bad.

929
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,534
I'm not gonna apologize
because...

930
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,457
that would mean
I'm doing something wrong.

931
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,377
And I'm not sure I am, so--

932
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,092
I'm playing at a club tonight.

933
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,179
A real club.

934
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,177
Someone important
could hear my song...

935
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,131
and next month somebody
might be singing it on the radio.

936
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,410
- So wish me good luck.
- Good luck.

937
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:52,375
Anyway, um...

938
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,252
I'll call you
and tell you how it goes.

939
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,692
Take care of yourself, old man.

940
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,855
Old man.

941
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:07,053
All right. You should be dancing
on the floor! I wanna see your bras!

942
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,694
Ow!

943
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:15,894
- Well, my baby and me
went out late Saturday night
- All right.

944
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:20,616
I had my hair piled high and
my baby she looked so right

945
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,334
Well, pick you up at 1 0.:00
Got to have you home by 2.:00

946
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,655
Mama, don't know
what I catched off of you

947
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:29,329
But that's all right 'cause
we're looking as cool as can be

948
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:33,578
Is this the greatest party
we've ever been to or what, man?

949
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,370
Lil, I can only stay two hours.

950
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,697
- What are you talking about?
- I gotta leave early tonight, remember?

951
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,697
- Bourbon.
- Why?

952
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,369
Maybe you haven't noticed all
the bodies you had to crawl over
to get in here tonight.

953
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,889
- Lil, I told you I gotta leave
by 1 0:30 no matter what.
- Four!

954
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:52,580
- Here.
- Got it. I got it.

955
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,099
Seven.

956
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:58,259
That I love you, yeah

957
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:01,053
Hit me

958
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,858
- Here you go.
- What are you doing?

959
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,813
I gotta go. It's half past.
Can you have Lou call me a cab?

960
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,091
Listen,Jersey. You're not
going anywhere. Not tonight.
This place is out of control.

961
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,176
But, Lil, I told you.
I'm only working two hours--

962
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,609
You wanna sing?
Sing for them.

963
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,732
These people dragged
their asses out here to see us.

964
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,296
This is New York, and there's a line
halfway around the block.

965
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,411
That's something,Jersey,
whether you believe it or not.

966
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,452
- Last night a little dancer
came dancing to my door
- And if I go?

967
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:32,334
- If you were going,
you would have left by now.
- Last night a little angel

968
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,610
And tonight

969
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,777
- Where are you?
- Lil won't let me go.

970
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,529
Violet, just walk out. She doesn't
own you. You can still make it here.

971
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,618
I'm-- I'm sorry.

972
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:47,459
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

973
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:48,535
Violet.

974
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,856
- What's the story?
- She's not coming.

975
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:57,335
So what am I supposed to do, Kevin?
I got a whole spot to fill.

976
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:00,338
I'm sorry, Richie.
I made a mistake.

977
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:03,577
Whoa, this doesn't change
anything with us, Kevin.

978
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,895
A deal's a deal.
Am I right?

979
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:16,533
All she wants to do
is dance, dance, dance

980
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,891
Wild-eyed pistol wavers
who ain't afraid to die

981
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,329
And all she wants to do is

982
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:27,614
All she wants to do
is dance and make romance

983
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:31,653
She can't feel the heat
Comin'off the street

984
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:33,896
- She wants to party
- Ooh

985
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,136
- She wants to get down
- Ooh

986
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:38,137
All she wants to do is

987
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:41,855
All she wants to do is dance

988
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,572
And make romance

989
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,930
I'm the guy! Me!

990
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,935
All she wants to do is dance

991
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,972
Zach, who said
you could be up here?

992
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,699
You're not supposed
to be up here.

993
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:02,414
All right.
Take it easy, Zach.

994
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,019
Zach, take it easy.

995
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:09,168
- We barely made the airport
for the last plane out
- Hey! Hey!

996
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,256
- Hey, hey, knock it off!
- Kevin!

997
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,769
- Lil!
- Hey!

998
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:17,059
Break it up!

999
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:20,013
- Kevin, that's enough!
- 'Cause all she wants to do is dance

1000
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,017
Lou!

1001
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,891
Kevin, that's enough!
Kevin, that's enough!

1002
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,373
- Get off me!
- Stop it!

1003
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,890
- Kevin, Zach's a regular,
and he was just having fun.
- Having fun with my girlfriend!

1004
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,854
- Lou, get him out of here!
- You're gonna chill outside,
or I'm calling the cops.

1005
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,016
- Out of my way! Move!
- Let me go!

1006
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:47,295
- Get the hell out of here!
- Hey, everybody,
free drinks on the house.

1007
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,615
I'm paying. Get up here.

1008
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,459
Kevin. Kevin.
What is your problem?

1009
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:56,573
Look, I'm sorry about tonight,
but look at this. There was
no way Lil was gonna let me out.

1010
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,736
This is not about Lil.
This is about you and this place.

1011
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:02,170
- This is my job.
- It's a goddam sandbox
for you to stick your head in.

1012
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,768
- What is that supposed to mean?
- The place is a joke.

1013
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,379
All right?
They don't come to watch you sing.

1014
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,776
- They come to watch girls
shaking it on a bar!
- And what would you have me do?

1015
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,936
- Sing for quarters in the park?
- Well, at least you'd be
singing your own songs.

1016
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:15,370
I told you I can't do that,
so stop pushing!

1017
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:19,413
I'm just asking you to try, but I guess
that's asking a bit too much.

1018
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,657
Right. It's so easy to be you,
isn't it?

1019
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:26,216
You have no dreams, no hopes,
no chance of getting hurt.

1020
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:29,173
When was the last time
you took a chance on something?

1021
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,212
- Some of us don't have that luxury.
- Why is that?

1022
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:40,218
Oh, right. We don't talk about you,
right? It's a big secret.

1023
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,854
Come on, Kevin.
Let's play a game.

1024
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:45,175
I'm gonna guess why
you left Australia.

1025
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,656
- Doesn't matter.
- You were in jail.

1026
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:51,817
No, that's not it.
You have a wife and four kids in Sydney.

1027
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,613
Come on. Am I getting warm? Come on,
Kevin. I don't have a lot of time.

1028
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:57,493
Why'd you run away from home?

1029
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:01,215
I didn't have a home.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

1030
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,900
I don't have a family.

1031
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:07,171
I mean, that's the big secret.
Are you happy?

1032
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,053
Huh? Are you gonna
feel sorry for me now?

1033
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,252
You gonna hold me close while I tell you
I had to change homes every two years?

1034
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,215
I had a bad childhood.
Big deal.

1035
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,979
I don't need your sympathy,
'cause I'm here...

1036
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,977
and I'm living on my two feet
like I wanted to.

1037
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,455
That was my dream.

1038
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:26,491
And at least I did it
with a little bit of dignity.

1039
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,576
And I didn't.
That's it?

1040
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,089
Well, just unbutton the blouse
a little and unzip the pants.

1041
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,893
Show a little bit of flesh.
I think you can figure it out.

1042
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:45,578
Go on in. Your fans are waitin'
for ya to crawl on a bar.

1043
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:07,255
I told you
not to break the rules.

1044
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:09,450
What are you talking about?

1045
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:12,174
I'm talking about you and your boyfriend
making a scene in my bar.

1046
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,973
I'm talking about a friend of mine
inside with a broken nose.

1047
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,570
The rules were simple,Jersey.
I've fired girls for a lot less.

1048
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,612
What, so I can't have a boyfriend now?
What kind of stupid shit is that?

1049
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:24,208
Hey! This place is my home...

1050
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:27,138
and I'm not willing to risk
everything I have on your personal life.

1051
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,728
- It's business, plain and simple.
- This is not business.

1052
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,658
I worked my ass off for you,
and you're supposed to be my friend.

1053
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,975
I never said I was your friend.

1054
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,216
I'm your boss, and you knew
the rules like everybody else.

1055
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:41,492
Will you stop with "the rules''?
It's a bar, for Christ's sake!

1056
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,291
Then what are you
so upset about?

1057
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:14,413
Please remember

1058
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:26,253
How we laughed
How we cried

1059
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:30,532
How this world
was yours and mine

1060
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:34,209
And how no dream
was out of reach

1061
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:38,458
I stood by you
You stood by me

1062
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:42,653
We took each day
and made it shine

1063
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,568
We wrote our names
across the sky

1064
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:50,978
We ran so fast
We ran so free

1065
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,931
I had you

1066
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:57,815
You had me

1067
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:06,769
Please remember

1068
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:15,454
- I'm just a love machine
- Oh, my God. Give me a bite.
I'm starving.

1069
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,618
Mmm.

1070
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:23,176
- Mmm, thank you.
- How does it feel to be Mrs Molinaro?

1071
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:28,212
You know, I think he was
a perfect choice for my first marriage.

1072
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,095
- Mmm.
- Hey, Gloria.

1073
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:36,610
- Oh!
- Thanks for inviting me, uh--

1074
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:38,935
I gotta go to work.
I'm on graveyard tonight.

1075
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:42,609
-Thank you, Mr Sanford.
-Yeah, well, it's not worth a hug, dear.

1076
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:45,413
- It's only 50 bucks.
- Aw.

1077
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:49,419
- Your old man's a ten, Vi.
- Eleven, some days a twelve.

1078
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,609
- Well, it's a beautiful wedding.
- No, you can't go.

1079
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:57,210
I just want one picture of you
and Violet dancing together. Come on.

1080
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:01,731
Wise men say

1081
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,932
- Okay. Come on. Smile.
- Only fools

1082
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:08,450
Rush in

1083
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:13,256
But I can't help

1084
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,371
Are you really working,
or are you leaving because of me?

1085
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,856
- Falling in love
- You know I don't like to wear a tie.

1086
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:22,495
With you

1087
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,455
- Ha-ha.
- Shall I--

1088
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:29,811
So this is how it's gonna be?
You're not gonna return my phone calls?

1089
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:33,171
If you needed money,
you should have come to me.

1090
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,450
I would have found a way
to take care of you.

1091
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:38,140
Dad, you can't even
take care of yourself.

1092
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,457
Hey, I am doing just fine
on my own, thank you very much.

1093
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,048
Oh, really? So how come
you're not wearing any socks?

1094
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:47,092
Falling in love

1095
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:50,769
- With you
- I had a minor disagreement
with the clothes dryer.

1096
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:54,778
Like a river flows

1097
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,858
-Just face it, Dad. You need me.
- Surely to the sea

1098
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:01,768
- And I moved out,
and that's what bothers you.
- Darling, so it goes

1099
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,460
Some things

1100
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,571
- No. No.
- Are meant to be

1101
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:09,214
What bothers me...

1102
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,696
- Take my hand
- is, for the first time in my life...

1103
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:14,936
I was ashamed of you.

1104
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,051
- Take my whole
- I would have never thought that
would ever have been possible.

1105
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:21,731
Life too

1106
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,693
For I can't

1107
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,409
Help

1108
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:30,651
Falling in love

1109
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:33,374
Hey, it's me.
Leave a message after the beep.

1110
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,539
Violet? I'vejust finished work,
and in a few hours I'm going...

1111
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:40,413
to unload
three disgusting fish trucks.

1112
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,929
I thought maybe you'd like
to come and give me a hand.

1113
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,449
- But you're not in, or...
- Okay, okay, okay.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1114
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,094
you're not picking up, so...

1115
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,448
I'll call back...

1116
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:53,334
because I'm hoping
one day you...

1117
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:54,495
will wanna talk.

1118
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,253
Kevin? Hello?

1119
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:15,010
Kevin? Hello? It's me.

1120
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:18,610
- I'm here.
- Is this Violet Sanford?

1121
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:21,891
- Yes.
- I'm calling from
Riverview Medical Centre.

1122
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:26,332
We have a patient here by the
name of William James Sanford.
Is that your father?

1123
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:32,454
Dr Lee to Paediatrics, please.
Dr Lee to Paediatrics, please.

1124
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:34,810
Violet Sanford?

1125
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:38,410
- Yeah?
- Your dad's in recovery right now.

1126
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,974
The car struck him on his right side
when he was walking to the booth.

1127
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,490
His right leg is broken,
and there was some arterial damage
we had to go in and repair.

1128
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,975
But other than that,
it's just a lot of bumps and bruises.

1129
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,170
I'd say he's a pretty lucky guy.

1130
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:52,490
Violet?

1131
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:56,056
I told you, don't come down here.
It's your wedding night.

1132
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:01,857
Oh, are you kidding? Danny's been
in my family for five minutes.

1133
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:04,619
You've been in my family
my whole life.

1134
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,333
I'm sorry.

1135
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:44,217
I love you so much.

1136
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,170
I never did thank you
for the dance.

1137
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:54,537
That's okay.

1138
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:56,457
That's all right.

1139
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,209
My tapes.

1140
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:36,852
Come on.Just call him.
Just pick up the phone and call him.

1141
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:45,934
Don't call him.

1142
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,140
Told you.
This place is a palace.

1143
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:53,774
It's pretty late.
Are you sure you wanna do this now?

1144
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,812
Well, here's my door.
No turning back now. Come on in.

1145
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:01,698
Oh, you're so right.
This place is a palace.

1146
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:05,335
- Would I lie to you?
- This is a great idea. I'm so glad--

1147
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:10,214
- Nice strong pulse.
- Mmm.

1148
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,377
Don't look at me like that.
I'm a sick man.

1149
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,775
You can eat whatever you want now,
but when we go back home...

1150
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,175
it's egg whites
and Lean Cuisines.

1151
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,451
- I'll see you later, Bill.
- W-Wait a minute.

1152
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:24,890
What do you mean,
"until we go home''?

1153
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:28,530
I'm moving back.

1154
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:34,059
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't sing my songs.

1155
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:35,659
I was afraid.

1156
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,854
Do you know why Mommy quit?

1157
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:47,458
Yeah, she told me.
'Cause she couldn't do it.

1158
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,094
No, that's not it.

1159
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:53,657
She wasn't afraid, Vi.

1160
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:59,658
Your mother on stage--
Oh, she was amazing.

1161
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,697
Then why did she quit?

1162
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,214
Because of me.

1163
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:11,379
Right after you were born,
she told me she wanted to quit...

1164
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,456
and I let her.

1165
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:20,775
See, I knew how good she was,
but I never told her.

1166
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:25,497
I loved her...

1167
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:29,090
more than anything.

1168
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:32,371
And I just went on and pretended
that there was no other choice.

1169
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:37,213
- Dad, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

1170
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:40,935
I'm not gonna make the same
mistake twice. You're not
goin' back to work for Pete.

1171
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:45,258
I don't care what it takes. I don't care
how many bars you have to stand on.

1172
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:48,292
You are not comin' home.
I'm not letting you back in the house.

1173
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,496
Forget it.

1174
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:03,971
- Are you wearing cologne?
- Hmm? No!

1175
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,888
Oh, well, it's just
a splash of Old Spice.

1176
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,937
Where did you get Old Spice?

1177
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:15,019
That nice redheaded nurse
gave it to me as a gift.

1178
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:17,290
Then she asked me out
for coffee.

1179
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,411
I'm scared.

1180
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:21,337
Are you gonna go on a date?

1181
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,257
God, a date.

1182
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,537
I better buy a pair of socks.

1183
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:43,211
Okay. Come on in here.
Watch out for the-- Okay. Okay.

1184
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:52,170
Try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss

1185
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,691
Can't fight the moonlight

1186
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,979
Can't fight the moonlight

1187
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:12,138
You'll surrender your heart

1188
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:15,889
But you know
But you know that you

1189
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,496
Okay if I eat here at the bar?

1190
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:29,457
- Do you have a reservation?
- Uh, yeah.

1191
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:33,971
It's under, um,
"cast-iron heartless bitch.''

1192
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,931
Could it be under
"stubborn and pigheaded''?

1193
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,654
Yes. That's the one.

1194
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,817
I'll have a double water
on the rocks, please.

1195
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,579
- How'd you find me?
- Cammie.

1196
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:50,136
She told me about your pop.
I'm sorry to hear about that.

1197
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,057
He's okay.

1198
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,659
Good.

1199
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:58,137
- So am I.
- Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

1200
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:02,140
What's good to eat here?

1201
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:05,536
Lil, you didn't come here to eat.
What do you want?

1202
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,053
'Kay.

1203
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:17,488
I just wanted to let you know you can
come back to the bar whenever you want.

1204
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:24,295
- I appreciate the offer,
but I'm okay here.
- I figured that.

1205
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,934
You were never a lifer.

1206
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:29,938
I'm married to that bar.
Hell, I'd, uh--

1207
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:34,053
I'd sleep there if I had the guts
to walk around barefoot.

1208
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:38,172
But that's me, you know?
I'm the original Coyote.

1209
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:42,970
Just a small-town gal trying
to make it in the big bad city.

1210
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,456
"Small-town gal''?

1211
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,532
Piedmont, North Dakota.

1212
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,933
You ever tell anyone that,
I'll kill ya.

1213
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,250
Take care,Jersey.

1214
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:04,611
You have one new message.

1215
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:09,179
I have one message in eight hours.
How pathetic am I?

1216
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,768
Violet, this is Lindsay Morgan
from the Bowery Ballroom.

1217
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,368
Listen, we loved your CD...

1218
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,572
and we want you to play in our
songwriter's showcase next Sunday night.

1219
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:21,010
You're on at 1 0.:00 sharp.
So drop your music by the club...

1220
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:23,449
and the house band
can learn your song.

1221
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:27,778
Now if you have any questions,
don't be afraid to give me a shout.
See ya Sunday.

1222
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:30,619
- Here are the keys to the apartment.
It's all yours.
- Thank you.

1223
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:33,971
I can't thank you enough
for subleasing me this place.
You don't know how long I looked.

1224
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:35,738
And when is your boyfriend
moving in?

1225
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:37,532
He's actually coming in
tomorrow from Boston.

1226
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:43,418
It's historic, guys.
This is the first night
I've closed early in three years.

1227
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:46,054
Ta-da. Will you hang that
outside for me?

1228
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:47,977
- Hey, Lou, you got that number
I asked you about?
- Yep.

1229
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,409
So why are you moving
to Chicago?

1230
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:53,293
I'll figure that out
when I get there.

1231
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:54,489
Um, oh.

1232
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:01,930
- Hello.
- Hey, do yourself a favour
and look at page 1 3 7 of The Voice.

1233
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,132
I can't believe your name is in
the paper. I'm gettin' this framed.

1234
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:08,457
Dad, if you're not ready in five
minutes, I'm gonna leave without you.

1235
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:11,219
Keep your pants on, will ya?
I'm physically challenged.

1236
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,450
I only got three rolls of film.
I hope that's enough.

1237
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:18,696
Dad, I'm only singing
one song.

1238
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,697
Right. Better go get
another one.

1239
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,890
- Hey, Bill.
- My kid's singing tonight
at some club in the city.

1240
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:31,093
She's a little nervous.
Hey, maybe you can give us
a one, two, three for luck.

1241
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:33,780
You got it. All right, let's give it up
for Bill Sanford's daughter.

1242
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:37,654
Light 'em up. One, two, three.

1243
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:43,896
Oh, look, Vi.

1244
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,375
I can't do this.

1245
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,172
Jesus!

1246
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:52,810
Did I mention to you
that I was recently
in a horrific car accident?

1247
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:54,931
I-- I can't do this.
I gotta go back.

1248
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,528
- Violet, listen to me.
Are you listening?
- Yes.

1249
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:00,458
You have nothing to be afraid of.
You're already a star.

1250
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:03,731
- Dad, what are you talking about?
I'm a nobody.
- If you're such a nobody...

1251
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:06,533
then why did I buy this off Pete
for 20 bucks?

1252
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:13,291
- Why do you have that?
- I saw it on the wall, decided
I wanted the first autograph.

1253
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:16,412
Ifigured it'd be
a damn good investment.
Now what are you waiting for?

1254
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:18,258
I didn't spend three months
in physical therapy...

1255
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:21,338
just to take a ride
to the state line, you got me?

1256
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:25,578
- Yeah, I got ya.
- So what do you say, Vi?
How about another U-ey?

1257
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:33,058
You guys call that a one, two, three?
Now, let's do it again!

1258
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:35,136
This time I wanna feel chills!

1259
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:36,659
There goes Bill again.
He's back for seconds.

1260
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,055
Come on, now!
Let's give him all we got!

1261
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,412
Whoo! Let's go!

1262
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:45,293
The only reason
why I came down here tonight
is to see her fall on her face.

1263
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,809
Oh, take it easy, Rachel.
It's supposed to be a fun night out.

1264
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,896
- Excuse me.
- I'm cool. Don't worry about me.

1265
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:53,092
- Hi. Good evening, ladies.
Can I help you?
- No.

1266
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:55,654
It's packed, Lindsay. The house band
has been on for 1 5 minutes.

1267
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:57,577
If she's not here in five,
she's bumped.

1268
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:00,736
- Look out!
-Jesus!

1269
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:03,533
Uh, now that we're here,
I'm feeling a little nervous.

1270
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,969
Thank you, Mr Sanford.

1271
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,090
Oh, oh, probably just carsick.

1272
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:11,939
Forget I mentioned it.
I'm fine. Have a great show.

1273
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,577
Vi.

1274
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:20,329
Get your butt in there.
Come on. We're right behind you.

1275
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:21,973
Break a leg, sweetie.

1276
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:29,933
Ladies and gentlemen,
making her Bowery Ballroom debut,
Miss Violet Sanford!

1277
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:55,135
I'm sorry.

1278
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:02,856
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Come on.

1279
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,690
Under a lovers'sky

1280
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:16,653
Gonna be with you

1281
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:20,614
And no one's gonna be around

1282
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:23,493
If you think
that you won't fall

1283
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:25,736
We'll just wait until

1284
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:29,011
Till the sun goes down

1285
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:34,009
Underneath the starlight, starlight

1286
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:38,770
There's a magical feelin'so right

1287
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:42,131
It will take you in tonight

1288
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:46,173
- You can try to resist
- Whoo! Violet!

1289
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,211
Try to hide from my kiss
but you know

1290
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:52,219
But you know that you
can't fight the moonlight

1291
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:56,094
Deep in the dark
you'll surrender your heart

1292
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:58,370
But you know, but you know

1293
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:03,130
That you can't fight
the moonlight, no

1294
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:06,332
You can't fight it

1295
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:09,975
It's gonna get to your heart

1296
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,694
There's no escape from love

1297
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:15,778
Once the gentle breeze

1298
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,573
Weaves its spell
upon your heart

1299
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,612
No matter what you think

1300
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:27,052
It won't be too long
till you're in my arms

1301
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:29,648
- Come on, baby. Shake it!
- Underneath
- Hey, pinhead!

1302
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,577
- The starlight, starlight
- That's what I'm talking about, baby!
Now shake it!

1303
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,931
Don't do it, Rach. He's a big guy,
and you're still on probation.

1304
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:37,813
Don't worry. Those classes
are really paying off.

1305
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:41,057
It'll steal your heart tonight

1306
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,296
You can try to resist

1307
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:45,650
Try to hide from my kiss

1308
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:47,816
But you know, but you know

1309
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:51,091
That you can't fight the moonlight

1310
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:55,259
Deep in the dark
you'll surrender your heart

1311
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,052
But you know, but you know

1312
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:00,297
That you can't fight the moonlight

1313
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:18,131
Okay. Let's give a big Coyote welcome
to LeAnn Rimes.

1314
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,694
You can try to resist

1315
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,334
Try to hide from my kiss

1316
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:27,009
But you know, but you know
that you can't--

1317
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:31,418
So tell me, what do you do
when you realize that all
your dreams have come true?

1318
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:33,019
Pay off old debts.

1319
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:35,859
But you know,
but you know that you

1320
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:38,130
- Can't fight the moonlight
- Volume 1 29.

1321
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:43,015
The original appearance
of the Punisher-- the one I cost you.

1322
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,689
- Thank you.
- It'll steal your heart tonight

1323
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:48,856
- You can try
- You can try to resist

1324
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:51,892
Try to hide from my kiss

1325
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:54,375
But you know, but you know

1326
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,173
Lil, don't think
your new girl's gonna hack it.

1327
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:00,815
Deep in the dark
you'll surrender your heart

1328
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:03,090
- But you know, but you know
-Jersey!Jersey!Jersey!

1329
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:07,532
- That you can't fight the moonlight
-Jersey!Jersey!Jersey!Jersey!

1330
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:11,414
Jersey!Jersey!
Jersey!Jersey!

1331
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:14,850
You can try to resist my kiss

1332
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:17,972
- But you know, but you know
- Don't you know

1333
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,295
That you can't fight the moonlight

1334
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:24,777
Oh, no
You can't fight it

1335
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:28,688
It's gonna get to your heart

1336
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:36,539
Okay. In true Coyote tradition,
I'm gonna make every woman's night...

1337
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:39,891
and auction off the most
handsome little hottie in the place.

1338
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:42,295
Violet, come on.
You can't do this to me again.

1339
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:43,978
Here he is, girls.

1340
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:49,089
- Come on, Dad!
- All you got is this moment

1341
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:52,769
Okay, ladies.
The bidding will start at $25.

1342
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:57,212
- 2 1 st century's yesterday
- See, nobody wants to do this.
What are getting me into, Violet?

Twenty-five dollars!

1344
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:03,055
You said you wanted a more active
social life. Come on, girls.

1345
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:05,136
There's a lot of miles
left on these tyres.

1346
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:08,616
- Fifty dollars!
- Come on, Dad. Strut your stuff.

1347

1348
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,850
Your moves are so raw

1349
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,857
I've got to let you know

1361
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:56,933
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know

1362
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,449
- Whoo!

1363
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:02,253
- So slide over here
- Well, your father has no problem
with stage fright.

1364
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:05,770
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw

1365
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,619
- I've got to let you know
- So tell me...

1366
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,971
- what do you do when you realize
all your dreams have come true?
- You're one of my kind

1367
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:22,055
Time

1368
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:26,776
Sometimes the time
just slips away

1369
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:29,892
And you're left
with yesterday

1370
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:34,691
Left with the memories

1371
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:37,050
I

1372
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:41,731
I'll always think of you
and smile

1373
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:45,136
And be happy for the time

1374
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:49,651
I had you with me

1375
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:56,775
Though we go
our separate ways

1376
01:31:56,900 --> 01:32:00,779
I won't forget
so don't forget

1377
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:03,892
The memories we've made

1378
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:07,615
Please remember

1379
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:11,335
Please remember

1380
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:13,894
I was there for you

1381
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:18,696
And you were there for me

1382
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:22,449
And remember

1383
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:27,051
Please remember

1384
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:30,695
Me

1385
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:37,576
Please remember

1386
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:41,249
Please remember

1387
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:43,814
I was there for you

1388
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:48,775
And you were there for me

1389
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:52,529
And remember

1390
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:57,814
Please remember me

1391
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,498
And how we laughed

1392
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:01,611
And how we smiled

1393
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:05,335
And how this world
was yours and mine

1394
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:08,850
And how no dream
was out of reach

1395
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:12,768
I stood by you
You stood by me

1396
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:16,575
We took each day
and made it shine

1397
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:20,215
We wrote our names
across the sky

1398
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:24,219
We ran so fast
We ran so free

1399
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:30,290
I had you and you had me

1400
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:37,811
Knew all about

1401
01:33:37,940 --> 01:33:40,408
Your bad reputation

1402
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:45,091
And now it's bound to be
a heartbreak situation

1403
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:48,929
But I can't help it
if I'm helpless every time

1404
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:53,736
That I'm where you are

1405
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:58,536
You walk in and my strength
walks out the door

1406
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:03,529
Say my name
and I can't fight it any more

1407
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:06,538
Oh, I know I should go

1408
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:09,493
But I need your touch
just too damn much

1409
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:11,338
Yeah, yeah

1410
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:14,338
Lovin'you, yeah

1411
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:19,329
- Isn't really something I should do
- Not something I should do

1412
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:24,011
I shouldn't want to spend
my time with you, yeah

1413
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:26,700
Well, I should try
to be strong

1414
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:31,450
- I should try to be strong
- But, baby, you're the right
kind of wrong

1415
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:33,377
Right kind of wrong

1416
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,650
Baby, you're the right kind
of wrong

1417
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:38,817
Baby, you're the right kind
of wrong

1418
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:43,736
Now, baby, you're the right
kind of wrong

1419
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:47,978
I don't like to

1420
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,660
Be alone at night

1421
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:53,578
And I don't like to

1422
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:56,498
Hear I'm wrong
when I'm right

1423
01:34:56,620 --> 01:35:01,091
And I don't like to
have the rain on my shoes

1424
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:05,736
But I do love you

1425
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:10,773
I don't like to

1426
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,733
See the sky painted grey

1427
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:18,376
And I don't like to
be the one with the blues

1428
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:22,778
But I do love you

1429
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:27,171
Love everything about

1430
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:30,053
The way you're loving me

1431
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:33,809
The way you lay your head
upon my shoulder

1432
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:35,976
When you sleep

1433
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:39,695
And I love to kiss you
in the rain

1434
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:44,132
I love everything you do

1435
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:48,014
Oh, I do

1436
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:51,132
And I don't like to

1437
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:53,899
Be alone in the night

1438
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,932
And I don't like to

1439
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,620
Hear I'm wrong
when I'm right

1440
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:02,698
And I don't like to

1441
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:04,617
Have the rain on my shoes

1442
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:08,779
But I do love you

1443
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:16,529
But I do love you
