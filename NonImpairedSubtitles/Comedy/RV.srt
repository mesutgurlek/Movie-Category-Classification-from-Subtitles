1
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,600
"Once in every nighttime,
someone comes around. "

2
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,800
- "I'm coming to get you. "
-No.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,600
"There's someone
that makes sleeping difficult. "

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,100
"Cassie. "

5
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,300
"I'm coming."

6
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,100
Who's there?

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,200
-"The Tickle Monster."
-No.

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,600
"That's right, Sylvester Stallone
is the Tickle Monster."

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,900
"I'm gonna tickle you."

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,400
"What?"
"I'm gonna tickle you."

11
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,300
"What?"
"I'm gonna tickle you!"

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,400
Daddy, help.

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,700
I'm here, Cassie.
Unhand my daughter, Tickle Monster.

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,300
Oh, hand-to-hand.

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
-Look, over there.
-Go, Daddy, go.

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,500
"Oh, dear."

17
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,600
-Is she still up?
-Yeah.

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,400
Yeah, I just gave her a warm bath...

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,500
...and now she's more wide-awake
than I am.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,100
She won't be so sharp
for her big meeting tomorrow.

21
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,600
-Good night, sweetie.
-Night, Mommy.

22
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Well, if I can get Carl to sleep
in the next 10 minutes...

23
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,000
-...you might still have a shot tonight.
-Use a mallet if you have to.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,700
-Daddy?
-Yeah, baby?

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,600
I'm never gonna get married.

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,500
Why not? It's not as bad as it looks.

27
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,300
Because I always want to live here
with you.

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,800
Well, you know, one day,
you're gonna grow up...

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,400
...meet a wonderful guy,
and you're gonna get married.

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,300
But you and I
will always be best friends.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,900
Good night, Cassie.

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,900
Dad, could you be any more of a dork?

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,000
Cassie, you know where this girl lives
or you just think you know?

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,400
I know where she lives,
I just know one way to get there.

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
-And you refuse to go that way.
-Because it's a stupid way.

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,800
-If you consider getting there stupid.
-Why don't you use the navigation?

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,400
Because Sacajawea back there
doesn't know the name of the street.

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,300
She knows it as "the one
next to the one with the fountain."

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,300
Hey, Dad,
Cassie just gave you the finger.

40
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,400
If we don't find this house
in two minutes--

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,900
-There it is.
-Okay, honey...

42
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,500
...hurry up, go get your friend.

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,700
-Jerk.
-I heard that.

44
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,000
Good.

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,200
-Where are they?
-She just left.

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,500
Okay.

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,500
Which friend is this, the nice one?

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,300
You used to know all her friends.

49
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,700
-You were funny and charming.
-Well, she's 15.

50
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,500
She doesn't want me to be charming.
She finds it creepy.

51
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,900
Oh, no.

52
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
It's the too-nice one.

53
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,600
Hi, thanks for inviting me.

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Any friend of Cassie's
is always welcome.

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,200
We're a little late.

56
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,900
Remember, congratulate Todd
on the Alpine soda merger...

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,500
...tell him the house looks great,
work in his outfit.

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,400
-Maybe he smells nice.
-Lick his face?

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
No, don't touch him.
Don't shake his hand.

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,100
-Oh, right, Mr. Stupid-Germ-Phobia.
-Yeah.

61
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,200
There they are, old Bob Bobcat.

62
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,700
-Teabag.
-Hi, Todd.

63
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,800
Hi. Hi.

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,900
Well, congratulations on Alpine soda.

65
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,100
-Bob said you'd do it.
-Yeah.

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,800
God, Jamie, if my ex-wife
looked as good as you...

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,800
...I'd still be in the middle
of a horrible marriage.

68
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,800
Thank you, Todd.
What a lovely compliment.

69
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,200
Oh, there's Laird.

70
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,100
Laird.

71
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,800
-So that's the young hotshot?
-Yeah.

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,000
Harvard M.B.A.
We're planning to kill him.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,500
Do you want in?

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,500
-Cassie.
-There he is.

75
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Laird. You know what'd be great?
You going to get me shrimp.

76
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,200
I'm not joking.

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,100
Cass, go say hi to Todd.

78
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,400
-What for?
-He likes you. I'll give you 20 bucks.

79
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,700
Can I come?
I read all about him online.

80
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,200
Okay.

81
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,000
Hi, Mr. Mallory.
Good to see you again.

82
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,300
-Oh, Cassie Munro.
-Little Cassie?

83
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
Wow, you turned into quite
the young lady.

84
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,400
This is my friend, Gretchen.

85
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,900
-Hi, Gretch.
-Hi.

86
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,800
Aren't you the one who got the public schools system
to put Pure Vibe sodas into the schools?

87
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,000
That was me. Cassie's dad helped,
he's head of Corporate Relations...

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,800
...but I am el presidente.

89
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Wow, so you're, like,
personally responsible...

90
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,100
...for destroying the health
of millions of children.

91
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,500
-Gretchen.
-I probably wouldn't put it that way.

92
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,100
Obesity, diabetes, cholesterol.

93
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,600
The fat of our youth is on your hands.
Wallow in it.

94
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,200
Thank you, I had a very nice time.

95
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,200
Keep it real.

96
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,400
Don't.

97
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,600
Yo, homeslice,
can you chill on the def jam?

98
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,000
You're boiling my vibe.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,800
Respect.

100
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
Cass, can we talk?

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,900
-God, what?
-Nothing. My bad.

102
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,500
Father evil. Forgot that.

103
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,200
How you doing, are you all right?

104
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,100
-No, not really.
-Why don't you get that skin peel?

105
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
Feels like that.
Cassie was so abrasive--

106
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,300
Oh, Bob just came in.
Let me call you back. My sister.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
-Did you talk to Cassie?
-Yeah, I tried.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,400
Still bleeding a little bit.

109
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
She didn't know Gretchen
was gonna do that.

110
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,000
She didn't know her friend was gonna
throw a vat of schmaltz on my boss.

111
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,400
Wine or martini?

112
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,300
-Both, with a Prozac back.
-Okay.

113
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,800
Remember when it used to be
"Daddy's home"? Now nothing.

114
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,700
We watch TV
in four separate rooms...

115
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,900
...and we IM each other
when dinner's ready.

116
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,700
Well, then let's change things.

117
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,600
Let's start while we're in Hawaii.

118
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,300
No laptop, no BlackBerry,
no business calls.

119
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,000
-Let's really go.
-No what?

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,500
You're not gonna see them
for the rest of the summer.

121
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,300
-Carl's got camp--
-Yeah.

122
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,700
Cassie's got college prep
in Palo Alto, I know.

123
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,400
That's right, and they leave
the day after we get back.

124
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,900
It'll be the same in Hawaii. They'll
only call us when they need money.

125
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,500
Well, I'm glad we're going.
And don't worry so much about work.

126
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,600
Todd loves you.
You're indispensable.

127
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,900
I'm afraid not.

128
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,000
I think Laird's gonna get my job.
He's younger, smarter, cheaper.

129
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,000
What did you say?

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,500
Nothing.

131
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Here you go.

132
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,700
To true love.

133
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,200
-Hawaii's gonna be great.
-Yeah.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,600
You gotta cancel Hawaii.

135
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,000
-Why?
-We hit a snag in the Alpine merger.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,800
-Since yesterday?
-One brother got seller's remorse.

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
-Garry.
-Larry.

138
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,600
Garry's still for it.
Show him some money...

139
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,700
...he'll quack like a duck.
Larry's nervous.

140
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,500
If I tell my wife we're not going
to Hawaii, bury me ass-up.

141
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,300
You have a place to park your bike.

142
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,600
-Bob.
-Todd.

143
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,500
Bob. Bob,
this crisis has actually saved your job.

144
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,900
-Really?
-After yesterday...

145
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,900
...I figured I gotta fire you
to maintain some respect around here.

146
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,700
But in light of this Alpine thing...

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,200
-...I still need you.
-Bless you, Todd.

148
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,400
I gotta run out there
and make a presentation.

149
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,300
I can write the presentation in Hawaii
and zap it to you.

150
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Laird can write me a presentation.
If I tell him to, he'll live in the office.

151
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,300
He'll shower
in the damn water cooler.

152
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,400
But you've got one thing
he hasn't got.

153
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,200
-A soul.
-No, you're good in a meeting.

154
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,000
You've got the chutzpah.

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,200
So I want you
to write that presentation...

156
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,000
...and I need you at the meeting
to put this thing over.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,100
-Yeah.
-So no Hawaii.

158
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,600
-No.
-Boulder, Colorado, Friday.

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,500
Just move your Hawaii dates.

160
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,900
The kids are booked
the rest of the summer.

161
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,700
-You have to go to Boulder.
-Agreed.

162
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,700
I want you to know, after the divorce,
I'm coming after Jamie hard.

163
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,400
Bring jewelry.

164
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,000
Hey, if you get Jamie,
can I have Elaine?

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,900
-You want Elaine?
-Better than nothing.

166
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,000
Trust me, it's not better.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,900
Elaine is still mad at me
for taking that vacation last year.

168
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,200
Figures that's why
I didn't get that promotion.

169
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,500
-Oh, the RV trip.
-RV trip?

170
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,700
Oh, the famous RV trip.
Oh, can we see the pictures again?

171
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,600
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Nobody move.

172
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,300
Did you rent that RV?

173
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Mom, some idiot just parked
this ugly RV outside our house.

174
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,800
What?

175
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,900
Oh, my God, it's your husband.

176
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,400
-Oh, hi.
-What is that?

177
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,400
-It's an RV.
-And why is it in front of our house?

178
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,200
-We're taking it on vacation.
-To Hawaii?

179
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,800
-No, it doesn't float. Colorado.
-What happened to Hawaii?

180
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,200
Come on, Hawaii's
a winter destination. It's summer.

181
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,300
The place I'm taking you is special,
and not like Uncle Mike.

182
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,100
It's Lake Nirvana,
where I went with my parents as a kid.

183
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,300
Is he being funny?
Because I can never tell.

184
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,800
Oh, come on.
You've always wanted to camp, right?

185
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
This is what he came up with
to punish me for Gretchen.

186
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,100
I was gonna surf.
Nice one, Dad. Thanks.

187
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,200
The hotel in Hawaii
has a weight room.

188
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,300
Doesn't anybody
respect my lifting schedule?

189
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,200
We're not campers. We don't camp.

190
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,200
-Why not?
-Why--? Why not?

191
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,300
-For one thing, we like to shower.
-Well, it's got a shower.

192
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,700
You and I will go out right now
and take a shower.

193
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Bob, do you know where you stay
when you take an RV trip?

194
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,600
-Where?
-RV camps.

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,100
Honey, try to remember,
we're not friendly.

196
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,900
In Hawaii, we'll never see the kids.

197
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,700
This way,
we can spend time with them.

198
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,100
You need to spend time with them.

199
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,300
I spend nine hours a day with them.
And I want Hawaii.

200
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,200
All right, we'll go to Hawaii.

201
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,300
At Christmas. Then it will just be us
and a lot of Jewish people.

202
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,100
-We'll have all the ham to ourselves.
-I'll have to cook.

203
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,900
No, you won't, because I'll cook
every night, every meal.

204
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,400
We were gonna take naps.
Hotel room, afternoon...

205
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,300
-...lock-the-door naps.
-Oh, the good naps.

206
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,700
-How are we gonna do that in an RV?
-I'll drive slowly.

207
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,700
-I was gonna get a massage.
-I'll give you a massage.

208
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,200
You're gonna do all the cooking,
give me massages.

209
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,500
And spend time with the kids.

210
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,400
You got it.

211
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,100
Did you cancel our Hawaii trip
because Todd told you to?

212
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,400
Did you volunteer us
for some sort of experiment?

213
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,500
The family travels around and drinks
nothing but Pure Vibe soda...

214
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,900
...see if our teeth fall out?

215
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,100
Honey, I'm running out of time
with my kids.

216
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,400
Come on, baby. Why don't you
come out in the wilderness...

217
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,000
...with your big, brawny man?

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,900
Don't make me call
for my mail-order bride.

219
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,800
Bob.

220
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,000
Here's something your genius
husband probably overlooked.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,700
Four miles to the gallon?

222
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,600
Gee, why don't we just stay home
and set fire to an oil field.

223
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,500
There's an elegant touch.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
Or we could just travel around
in clown suits.

225
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I spent the night with my head
in the toilet. I'm sure it's contagious.

226
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,600
All right, no more details.
Just e-mail me the new proposal.

227
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,300
-That's my couch. Move.
-Make me.

228
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,600
-This seat's better, anyway.
-Whatever.

229
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,500
Welcome aboard, everybody.
Before we embark...

230
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,100
...I think we should give
this beauty a name. Suggestions?

231
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,700
The Big Turd.

232
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,800
The Big Rolling Turd.

233
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,900
In that spirit, we set forth.

234
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,600
Make it so, Number One.

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Honey, are you sure know how to--?

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,600
-Honey?
-Trust me, okay?

237
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,200
Thanks.

238
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,900
Oh, my God.

239
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,600
-Honey, honey.
-What?

240
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,000
-Oh, tree.
-Yeah, it's all right.

241
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,700
Honey?

242
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,300
Honey. Honey.

243
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,100
Oh, my God.

244
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,900
-We're okay.
-Honey.

245
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,200
Honey, tree! Tree!

246
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,700
Honey, honey.

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
-Honey.
-Okay.

248
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,700
Anything else you want to hit?

249
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,600
Do you want to go back?
We missed the neighbor's cat.

250
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,200
You are 31 hours
from your destination.

251
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,700
-What's that?
-RoadMate 700.

252
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,300
-I call her "Lola."
-Make a right in 100 feet.

253
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,800
Thank you, Lola.

254
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,700
She's accurate to within 1 0 feet.

255
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,100
-Go straight.
-No, Lola says take a right.

256
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,300
-Well, mall traffic. Go straight.
-Fifty feet.

257
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,900
-Yeah, but she said take a right.
-Well, I'm telling you to go straight.

258
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,800
Twenty feet.

259
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,300
-Choose.
-Baby, please.

260
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,900
-Turn right.
-Choose.

261
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,300
-Dad!
-Turn right.

262
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,600
My bad.

263
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,200
-You are 30 hours and 59 minutes--
-Turn her off.

264
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,300
--from your destination.

265
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
Say, Dad, this is interesting.

266
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,500
"Unsecured items
in an unlatched cabinet...

267
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,000
...are a recipe for disaster."
Didn't you read this?

268
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,400
No, I was too busy thinking
of all the ways we're gonna have fun.

269
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,500
Dad, somebody's stealing the RV.

270
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,800
No, Carl. Nobody's stealing it...

271
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,700
...it's rolling backwards
with no one in it.

272
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,100
Oh, yeah. Well, my bad.

273
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Yeah, well, yeah.

274
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,700
-Thanks, Saul.
-Irv.

275
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,100
-Irv.
-Not "Saul. "

276
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,500
I don't know where I got Saul.

277
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,600
Well, thanks.

278
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
-Good news.
-I'm adopted?

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,200
Good one. No,
thanks to my technically proficient...

280
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,600
...and charmingly amusing description,
Saul--

281
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,400
-Irv.
-Irv, yeah. Irv the dealer...

282
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,800
...said we damaged the parking-gear
interlock and the emergency brake.

283
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,800
We had that little mishap, you know,
when Mom distracted me...

284
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,700
...we were pulling out of the driveway?

285
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,700
But the driving brakes,
the ones we use when we're moving...

286
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,400
...they're fine.
They're not just fine, they're brilliant.

287
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,000
All we have to do
is every time we park...

288
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,700
...we have to put two big blocks
under the rear wheel.

289
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,100
We'll be perfect. Thanks for the help.
Okay, everybody, come on.

290
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,800
It'll be fun, let's go.
Miles and smiles.

291
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
This is the worst
I've ever been treated.

292
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,200
-Wait till you get married.
-Thank you.

293
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,700
Everybody, let's get aboard
the Big Rolling Turd.

294
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,900
That was easy.

295
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,700
Now what do we do?

296
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,500
Hey, I know, let's go to the beach
and go surfing.

297
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,400
Wait a minute, I forgot.
We're not in Hawaii.

298
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,500
We're where NASA faked
the moon landing.

299
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,700
Wait a minute.

300
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,900
Wait till you see this.
It's called a "pop-out."

301
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,900
Hold on.

302
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Wow, where are you?

303
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,600
-How cool is that?
-Macarena cool.

304
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900
Hey.

305
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,400
You guys want to see a movie?
But where?

306
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,100
Forgive my ignorance,
but don't you need to hook up...

307
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,500
...the Big Rolling Turd
to the electricity for that?

308
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,300
Yes, I do.

309
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,300
I gotta take a crap.
Time to break in the pooper.

310
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,800
You are so disgusting.

311
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,800
Dad! The toilet's backed up!

312
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,200
Carl, what did you eat?

313
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,100
Dad, it's not mine.

314
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,100
There's the problem,
sewage tank is overflowing.

315
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,200
And it's not even our sewage,
it's leftover.

316
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,000
It's not a national emergency.

317
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,900
We'll go to where
you dump the sewage...

318
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,300
...and we'll dump the dump.
Come on, let's all go.

319
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,000
As appealing as that sounds,
I think I'm gonna pass. But thank you.

320
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And don't forget,
you're making dinner.

321
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,400
Sure, I'd love to clean
somebody else's crap out of the RV...

322
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,500
...instead of being in Hawaii.

323
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,200
Can I come?

324
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,600
Not only can you come,
you can dump the sewage.

325
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,000
-Really?
-Yeah.

326
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,300
It's gonna be a regular
Field of Dreams moment, buddy.

327
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,800
Piece of cake.

328
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,400
-Gonna be a while, mister?
-Oh, well, that depends.

329
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,700
If I can get this hose attached
to this outlet...

330
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,400
...I'll be right out of here.

331
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,400
-What's the dealie?
-Guy needs to attach a hose.

332
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,600
Doing it.

333
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,700
-What's up?
-Trying to attach a hose.

334
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,500
-Fella here's trying to hook up a hose.
-Maybe get on the loudspeaker.

335
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,100
That there's the wrong hose.
It's that there one.

336
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,700
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

337
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,300
-It's got the coupling.
-Right.

338
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,000
That one right there.

339
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,400
-There you go.
-Okay.

340
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,000
You need another hose.

341
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,700
Yeah, I guess, but....

342
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,300
It's long enough, but:

343
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,400
Gotta get one of them
bayonet couplings.

344
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,100
-He hasn't got one.
-He's got a Y-coupling right there.

345
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,200
Yeah, that'll do the trick.

346
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Y-coupling?

347
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,300
A Y-coupling.

348
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,200
That's the Y. Oh, I see.

349
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
-One potato.
-Alrighty.

350
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,400
Two potato.

351
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,800
-Okay, wait, oh.
-There we go.

352
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,300
Listen,
I'm no expert in waste management...

353
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,900
...but won't the fecal matter
come out the top hole there?

354
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,100
No, you just gotta hold it
up in the air like this:

355
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,100
There you go. Little bit higher.
There you go.

356
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,500
-Oh, like that there.
-There you go.

357
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
You sure this is gonna work?

358
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,800
Heck, yeah, man.
It's basic hydraulics.

359
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,200
Okay, Archimedes.

360
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,500
Hey, Joe Joe.

361
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,500
-Okay.
-Let her rip.

362
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,000
Turn it off!

363
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,900
-That sure didn't work.
-No.

364
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,100
-We need a hose spreader.
-Who's got one?

365
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,800
Gornicke, I think. I'll get it.

366
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,700
-I'll get some music.
-Oh, no, please.

367
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,300
And some of those tortilla chips.

368
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,400
-We got some leftover sausages.
-Bring them.

369
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,900
No, you folks don't need to have
a parade. I don't want to impose.

370
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,600
Oh, no, no.

371
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,000
We are gonna get this
fixed up for you, buddy.

372
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,100
Sausages.

373
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,200
Sausages.

374
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,100
Sausages.

375
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
-Right here, you want one?
-Yeah.

376
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,800
There we go. That'll work.

377
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,700
You sure this will hold?

378
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,500
Hey, man, why would they sell you
a hose spreader...

379
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
...if you couldn't spread the hose?

380
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,600
It's getting old. Come on.

381
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,300
Open it up, Joe Joe.

382
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
It's blocked. I'll flush the line.

383
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,400
-Hey, Dad.
-Son.

384
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,800
Maybe now is the time
to confess to you that...

385
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,400
...your dad's not the master
of all things.

386
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,700
I got that when you started
taking advice from morons.

387
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,300
Yeah. All we need is a banjo.

388
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,300
Oh, man. He didn't even open it up
all the way.

389
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,000
-See? No worries.
-Yup.

390
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
-Hello.
-Bob.

391
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,500
Hey, Todd.
Yeah, I'm still pretty sick.

392
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,400
-Where's my presentation?
-Presentation?

393
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,200
It's the best work I've done,
not to toot my own horn....

394
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,800
-Yeah, you'll have it Thursday morning.
-Thursday?

395
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,100
No, that's not soon enough.
Tomorrow will be great.

396
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,900
Oh, I gotta go.

397
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,700
Oh, dude, that is nasty.

398
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,300
Don't worry, I'll get another hose.

399
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,800
Fire in the hole!

400
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,200
Here's where you made your
critical mistake.

401
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,700
You listened to anything
Howie and Joe Joe said.

402
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,900
Nice boys, but they're a couple pliers
short of a tool chest.

403
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,700
They're not the ones covered
in fecal matter.

404
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
That's a good point.

405
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Travis Gornicke.

406
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,700
Bob Munro.

407
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,600
Yeah, let's postpone
that handshake...

408
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,400
-...till we get you cleaned up.
-Yeah.

409
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,500
You're clean enough to use
your own shower, Bob.

410
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,800
The vehicle's all cleaned up, Daddy.

411
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,900
-Oh, nice work, son.
-Thank you, boys.

412
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,800
-You're welcome.
-No problem, Mr. Munro.

413
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,100
-Look, can I offer you a--
-No, Bob, wouldn't think of it.

414
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
-We're neighbors.
-Mom wants to know--

415
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,400
What happened to you?

416
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,000
He was covered in turd.

417
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Oh, I know the feeling.

418
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,500
Mom wants to know when
you're cooking dinner.

419
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,600
You tell your mother when I'm good
and ready, that's when.

420
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,900
-I'll tell her.
-Tell her I'm good and ready.

421
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,700
Well, thanks.

422
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,100
Hey,
pleasure hosing you down, Bob.

423
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,200
-Ditto.
-Why can't they have dinner with us?

424
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,300
You know, aside from the stink,
I don't see why not.

425
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,800
Why don't you come on over?
Tuesday's meatloaf.

426
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Then afterwards, we can sit around
and watch Ernest Goes to Jail.

427
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,700
-It is funny.
-Well, it's a classic.

428
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,500
-Yeah, we'll make a whole night of it.
-I wish I could.

429
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,800
I promised my family
I'd make my special dish...

430
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,500
-...shish kebob.
-Oh, that's good.

431
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,100
-Well, another time, then.
-Yeah, try to keep me away.

432
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,000
Okay.

433
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,900
Carl!

434
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,300
-Honey, how's it going?
-Great, baby.

435
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,800
Okay, well, how long?
Because we're starving.

436
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,900
Four hours.
Maybe longer if you keep asking.

437
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,300
-What?
-It's a small oven...

438
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,000
...and I'm having to do the potatoes
with a hair dryer set on "high."

439
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,500
Hey, who wants to go to a party?

440
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,200
-Here we are. Hope we're not late.
-No!

441
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,300
-Well, Bob said we were invited.
-Yeah.

442
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,800
-Of course you were.
-Then here we are.

443
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,400
-We're hungry.
-All right!

444
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,100
-Mary Jo, our company's here.
-What company?

445
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,200
The ones that are close enough
to hear you yelling, darling.

446
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,000
-Well, hi.
-Hi.

447
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,600
Honey, help me.

448
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
-I've got you here, darling.
-Here you go.

449
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,900
Let's see. Earl and Billy you met.

450
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,500
-Hi, I'm Earl.
-And I'm not.

451
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,000
My wife, Mary Jo,
and my daughter, Moon.

452
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,100
Hey, y'all.

453
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,800
Well, Moon, that's kind of a hippie
name, like Moon, Rainbow, Bong.

454
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,900
She was named after Warren Moon.

455
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,700
He was quarterback of the
Houston Oilers.

456
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, this is my wife, Jamie.

457
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,100
Cassie, my daughter.
My son, Carl.

458
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,900
Named after Karl Marx...

459
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,700
...socialist, some would say
the father of modern communism.

460
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,900
As I'm throwing up with the blood
pouring out of my eyes, you know...

461
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,400
...I looked up and I said,
"Who is that lovely...?"

462
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,700
Next day, we were married
in Juárez.

463
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,100
Nine months later...out popped Earl.

464
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,700
So you got a boyfriend?

465
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,900
-Yeah, actually, I'm engaged.
-Unlikely.

466
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
So where are you guys from?

467
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,600
Where do you hang your hat,
as it were.

468
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,500
-Behind the wheel of that bus.
-Really?

469
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,700
-Full-timer, U.S.A.
-Really?

470
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Well, how do Moon, Earl and not Earl
go to school?

471
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,000
Home school.

472
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,700
I hope you don't find
this next question too personal...

473
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,700
-...but how do you...?
-Make a living? Various ways.

474
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,300
Let's see. We made $25,000 when
we turned in Mary Jo's stepdad.

475
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,000
In prison
he's getting help he needs.

476
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,100
Oh, and I almost forgot,
Mary Jo makes a living.

477
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,700
I mean, she earns $60,000 a year
without ever leaving that bus.

478
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,800
Really? Hooking?

479
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,100
-Funny.
-I'm a mobile sales rep for Happy Max.

480
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,200
Y'all seen the infomercials
for our musical car horns?

481
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,300
-No, I don't think we have.
-No.

482
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,400
Billy White Shoes,
blow that horn.

483
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,600
-Watch this.
-Wait for it.

484
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,700
I love it every time.

485
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,700
Wow, that's fantastic. That was....

486
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,000
Jamie, are you
a stay-at-home mom?

487
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
-Yes.
-When there's not a sale.

488
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,400
Let me hook you up with Happy Max.

489
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,700
I got a rep bag in the bus.

490
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,900
PIus, I represent
Lovely Lily Beauty Products.

491
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,500
-Mary Jo's a trained cosmetologist.
-If you're still here tomorrow...

492
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,100
...I'm going to give you a complete,
free total makeover.

493
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,000
A $39 package absolutely free.

494
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,900
-Oh, that would be good, honey.
-No.

495
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,100
You know what, I'm gonna work on you
the whole day tomorrow.

496
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,300
-There you go, little lady.
-Oh, I'm sorry, I don't eat meat.

497
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,900
I heard you talking.
That's why I brought you this here.

498
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,200
-There ain't no meat in it.
-Oh, no meat?

499
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,000
You here that? No meat.
Thank you. That's lovely.

500
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That's right. It's all organs.

501
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,000
Deer organs. They're fresh too.

502
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,200
I run him over this morning.
The rest of it's curing in the bedroom.

503
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,600
But the stomach, brains and pancreas,
we just toss that into the stew...

504
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,400
...because in this heat,
it doesn't keep.

505
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,600
-Bathroom.
-Little lady....

506
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,300
-There's my girl.
-Dad, can we please go?

507
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,000
Yes. You know,
thank you so much for the invitation.

508
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
This has been great. A lot of fun.

509
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,100
Dad, listen.

510
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
This is kind of our family theme song.

511
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Kids, come on. Get up there, go, go.
Hurry up, get the-- You know.

512
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Oh, they're gonna love this.

513
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,300
Little Mommy's got a whole
song-and-dance thing worked out.

514
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,900
-Oh, that's wonderful.
-Come on, Moon, come on.

515
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
-Here I go. Thank you, darling.
-Thank you.

516
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,200
-Oh, yeah.
-Line up the way we practiced.

517
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,400
I never grow tired of that song.
Last time I heard it I was buck-naked...

518
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,700
-...in a field with a road flare.
-Dad.

519
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,400
Yes. Big travel day tomorrow.

520
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,000
-Where y'all headed?
-Away.

521
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,200
Mount Watson in Colorado.

522
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,300
-Just fantastic to have met you both.
-Same here.

523
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,800
-Hope we see you again.
-How about breakfast tomorrow?

524
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,700
-Bagels and deer testicles?
-Oh, yeah, she's funny, just like you.

525
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,400
We'd have breakfast,
but we're early risers.

526
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,600
-Well, us too. Six a.m. work for you?
-We'll be long gone by then.

527
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Yeah, trust us.

528
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,800
Bob? Bob?

529
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,100
-Let's go, let's go. Bob?
-Yeah, baby.

530
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
-Oh, friendly folks.
-Yeah, they're nice people.

531
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,100
-Hi, Mr. Munro.
-Hi, Billy. I'm just--

532
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,600
-You sure got a nice one.
-What?

533
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,000
That's a nice laptop.

534
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,500
Oh, thanks. What are you doing up?

535
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,300
I have a sleep disorder.
I haven't slept since I was 5.

536
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,600
So you just wander around
the campground.

537
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,100
Yeah, I don't really mind.
It's the only time I have alone.

538
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,100
Well, see you.

539
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,900
Oh, okay.

540
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,500
-Morning.
-Good morning, Mr. Munro.

541
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,700
-Come on. Come on, let's go.
-It's 5:30.

542
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
The Gornickes.

543
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,600
Bob, a little help.

544
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,700
Little help? Cassie?

545
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,300
There's movement.
She-- She's moving.

546
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,800
Carl, let's get going.

547
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,500
Let's move it, let's move it.
Bob, gun it.

548
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,000
Carl. Cass, what's our status?

549
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,300
She's out the door. She's coming.
Mayday, mayday, she's coming!

550
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,800
Come on. Let's go, let's go.
Go, go, go!

551
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,700
-Come on!
-It's in gear, but it's not moving.

552
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,800
-The wheel!
-This stupid pop-out thing.

553
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,800
Hurry, Mom, she's coming!

554
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,500
Come on, come on, come on.

555
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,800
Will you move this son of a bi--

556
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,300
Hey!

557
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,800
They are early risers.

558
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,200
I'm going a whole 1 2 miles an hour.

559
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,900
Then pass him.

560
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,700
Kids, leave him alone.
He's not that good a driver.

561
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,500
Really.

562
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

563
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,100
-Come on.
-Bob.

564
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,300
Bob. Bob. Bob.

565
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,100
Bob.

566
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,800
All right.

567
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,800
-Okay. All right.
-Thanks.

568
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,500
-Hey, guess what.
-What?

569
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,300
We need gas.

570
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,200
And I really have to go
to the bathroom.

571
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,000
You know we have one of those.

572
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,700
Yeah, but after my last little
shower of sadness....

573
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,400
Okay, okay, do what you have to do.

574
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,500
I've got an ICBM coming.

575
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,700
If there's a poop fairy,
I can make a lot of money.

576
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,800
I could be a while, baby.
It's an 80-gallon tank.

577
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,300
Dad, you in here?

578
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,300
Carl, I just need a minute.

579
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,200
Sure, only the RV's rolling away.

580
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,000
Be right out.

581
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,900
-Hey, Bob.
-Travis.

582
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,100
Yeah, I think you've got
a little problem with your vehicle.

583
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,900
I'm no expert...

584
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,000
...but it's your parking-gear
interlock and your emergency brake.

585
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,800
-How did you...?
-It's a miracle.

586
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,300
We pulled in
the second it started rolling away.

587
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,700
Isn't that something?
Wanna hear about the time...

588
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,100
-...Jesus saved us from a tornado?
-It's great.

589
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,400
I'd love to,
but I was in the little boys' room...

590
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,900
...taking care of business
when Carl interrupted...

591
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,100
...but Jamie would love to hear it.

592
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,300
Well, it seems just like yesterday.

593
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,900
Thank you.

594
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,200
I don't wanna get too big,
you know.

595
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,100
-I mean, I don't want to look freakish.
-No.

596
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,700
-What is this?
-It's a list of places...

597
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,500
...between here and Colorado
that sell organic health food.

598
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,100
-I got it last night off the Internet.
-Oh, that was really thoughtful.

599
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,500
-What are you listening to?
-Nothing.

600
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,700
So Billy was blown
right out of that tree.

601
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,200
Right before he hit the ground,
from out of nowhere...

602
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,300
...comes this queen-size
Simmons mattress...

603
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,600
...slides right under him
and cushions his fall.

604
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,100
Saved his life.
PIus, we needed the mattress.

605
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,800
I have a bad back.

606
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,500
So you folks wanna join us
for breakfast?

607
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,900
-We--
-Ate.

608
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,100
Mr. Munro,
I was just telling Earl and Moon...

609
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,000
...about that neat laptop
you were using.

610
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,900
-When were you using a laptop?
-At work, all the time.

611
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,100
-I was just telling him--
-When did he see you?

612
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,100
You know,
we'd love to join you for breakfast.

613
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,700
-Somebody's ripe.
-Welcome to my world.

614
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,600
You guys go on in, get that table.
We'll be right there.

615
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,900
All right. Come on, kids.

616
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,600
-We're ditching them?
-Absolutely.

617
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,500
-Okay.
-Kids, move.

618
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,800
So because you told them
we were early risers...

619
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,400
...we had to get up at 5:30...

620
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,200
-...to avoid the Gornickes...
-Right.

621
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,100
...which we managed not to do
anyway...

622
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:23,000
...because you refused to use the
bathroom on the RV that you rented.

623
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,500
You're determined
to have a bad time, aren't you?

624
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,700
We all are, Dad.

625
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,600
Not me. I embrace every challenge.

626
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,700
Honey, maybe they just got
some bad news and had to leave.

627
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,900
You're a sweet woman, Mary Jo.
It's what I love about you.

628
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,000
But them folks ditched us.

629
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,500
Oh, Trav, honey, pull over.
Let's pull over.

630
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,400
He looks like a folk singer.

631
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,800
-Climb aboard.
-Hello there.

632
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,500
-How you doing, buddy?
-Sir.

633
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,100
Welcome to the Gornicke bus.

634
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,100
You a folk singer?

635
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,600
Cass,
can you turn on the oven for me?

636
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,600
I am so bored.

637
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,900
I could actually throw up
from how bored I am.

638
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,800
I brought games.
Sorry!, Monopoly, Twister.

639
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,400
-Come on, it'll be fun.
-Fun.

640
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,700
Did you turn on the oven?

641
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,400
-No.
-I'll do it.

642
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,300
-Raccoon in the oven!
-Oh, please. No.

643
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,500
Don't open it.

644
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,200
Did you take out the roast
from last night?

645
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,300
-I guess not.
-What's the plan?

646
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,000
Give him Carl. Maybe he'll eat him.

647
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Give him you.
He's on the South Bitch Diet.

648
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,800
-Good one.
-Okay, hey.

649
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,400
Hey, come on. Don't you see
what the raccoon's doing?

650
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,200
He's playing head games.
He wants to divide and conquer us.

651
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,000
We have to hang together,
stay strong.

652
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,400
-Just get rid of it.
-Just me?

653
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,100
-Yeah.
-Okay.

654
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,000
Come on, BIue.
There's coons in there.

655
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,500
-Come on, boy.
-Bob.

656
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,400
-Go get him, boy.
-Bob.

657
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,800
Just kidding.

658
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,500
I'm going in.

659
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,000
Is anyone gonna stop me?

660
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,500
"Dad, don't.
The raccoon might have rabies"?

661
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,000
Nothing? Not a word?

662
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,800
Not really.

663
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,400
-Daddy?
-Yeah, baby.

664
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,200
Don't hurt him.

665
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,400
I am entering the RV.

666
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,500
Still no sign.

667
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,700
I'm going towards the oven door.

668
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,500
I'm opening the ov--

669
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,200
Oh, my God!

670
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,400
There's more than one!

671
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,700
You guys, he's just joking around.

672
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,400
Get back.

673
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,900
Back. Back! Back!

674
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,600
You hideous--

675
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,600
We need a new plan.

676
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,900
All right, let's go.
You're off the Gornicke bus.

677
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,500
I didn't steal it. I found it.

678
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,300
Well, now you Iost it.

679
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,900
That's why they didn't
come to breakfast.

680
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,200
He Iost his computer, he needs it.
They went off frantic to find it.

681
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,400
I was quick to think the worst.

682
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,400
I'm filled with chagrin.

683
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,800
Oh, honey.

684
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,600
-What is that?
-It's a stink bomb.

685
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,300
Got it from the guy in the office.
Cost me $1 75.

686
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,700
I can get this for five bucks online,
I know it.

687
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,700
You're gonna set that off in the RV?

688
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,800
He assured me it's not toxic.
Just noxious, like Grandpa Ted.

689
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,600
Don't litter.

690
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,700
Suck on this, Rocky.

691
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,600
Yeah!

692
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,500
Run, critters.

693
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,500
Yeah, there's more where
that came from, you little bandits.

694
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,200
Yeah!

695
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,300
I'm not so ill-equipped to handle an
emergency as some people may think.

696
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,200
-No one said you were ill-equipped.
-You know it, baby.

697
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,800
How Iong does this last?

698
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
Up to six hours.

699
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,400
It's a beautiful evening.
Let's sit outside and enjoy nature.

700
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,000
Why don't we huddle
under the awning?

701
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,200
Oh, we can't.
Dad tore it off back in Nevada.

702
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,700
Well, why don't we just
get underneath the umbrella?

703
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,300
Oh, that's right.
Dad fed it to the raccoons.

704
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,600
-Please, try the office again.
-No, he's an idiot.

705
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,500
He won't let us in.
He charged me $70 for these bags.

706
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,900
What about that bar
we passed on the way up here?

707
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,200
-Yeah, Dad, pizza.
-And a roof.

708
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,100
No, it's dark out there. Besides,
those raccoons could be waiting.

709
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,900
Hey! I can see it.
It's just down there.

710
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,000
Come on, I'm starving.

711
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,000
-Bob?
-It's a bad idea.

712
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,600
It's just down the--

713
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,500
Carl!

714
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,500
Carl, we're coming!

715
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,000
Bob!

716
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,600
Mom!

717
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,800
Jamie!

718
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,300
Bob!

719
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,300
Bob!

720
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,100
Table for four. No smoking.

721
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,900
Wipe your feet.

722
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,800
See? That's why you should study.

723
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,300
So you can get good grades
and go to a big party school.

724
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,400
Hey, Dad, how come you never
got a pool table for the house?

725
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,600
Because of the generalissimo
over there.

726
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,200
We had one before you were born,
in the dining room...

727
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,900
...but then you get a job,
invite people for dinner...

728
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,100
-...you have a family....
-Life used to be fun.

729
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,300
It was fun. But then something
happened that was a Iot more fun.

730
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,600
We got the George Foreman
smokeless grill.

731
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,900
Okay.

732
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,700
It's fine. Let's just go to sleep.

733
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,000
Oh Dad.

734
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,200
Oh, yeah.

735
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,900
Oh, great, you're up.
Will you make the coffee?

736
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,500
-Love to.
-Thank you.

737
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,800
Do you want me to drive?

738
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,400
-You okay, Dad?
-Oh, yeah.

739
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,400
Dad, emergency!

740
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,200
Gornickes.

741
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,500
I'll get their computer.

742
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,500
I feel like that hitchhiker
in The Twilight Zone.

743
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,300
What do they like about us?
We're not even that appealing.

744
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,800
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life...

745
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,100
...going door to door,
selling musical car horns.

746
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,200
-Oh the Gornickes. I'll flag them down.
-Cassie!

747
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,900
-Get down!
-What?

748
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,100
She got him.

749
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,300
Munros!

750
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,100
Munros!

751
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,400
Bob! Jamie!

752
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,800
It's the Gornickes.

753
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,800
-Pretend to talk to me.
-Oh, yeah.

754
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,300
Pull over! We've got your stuff!

755
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,700
Munros. It's the Gornickes.

756
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,800
Pull over. We have your computer.

757
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,700
And a Happy Max bag.
Pull over.

758
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,900
Kids, grab your paint guns.

759
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,100
Pull ahead.
We'll put one across their bow.

760
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,300
You know, seeing you drive this thing
is really turning me on.

761
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,400
What?

762
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,900
They've got guns!

763
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,000
We've also got--

764
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,600
You can come up now.

765
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,500
Where did you learn
to drive like that?

766
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,700
How do you think
I get the kids to school on time?

767
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,700
What a shame. If we had their address,
we could just ship it to them.

768
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,500
Well, we do know
where they're headed.

769
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,300
Mount Watson, Colorado.

770
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,600
You know,
if you wore clothes that fit...

771
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,800
-...you wouldn't Iook like a 1 0-year-old.
-It's how I roll.

772
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,500
Oh, sweet.

773
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,400
You say something, Frodo?

774
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,300
I was just saying
how that guy Shaq'd you there.

775
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,000
-We got two-on-two, right?
-Why don't you find...

776
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,500
...an under-2-foot league.

777
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,700
Why don't you trade that thing in
on top of your neck for a face.

778
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,800
I'm gonna floss your rear.

779
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,500
-Let's go, bring it. Come on.
-Yo, my mobile homeboys.

780
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,300
-What's tripping in the wood?
-This termite belong to you?

781
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,200
-Don't call--
-Yo, my man-- Easy.

782
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,500
This my man, C.
He's small, but ferocious.

783
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,400
But you dogs, you're hardcore.
Where you from?

784
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,600
-Scottsdale.
-Scottsdale, in the 'Zona.

785
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,500
That's a hardcore 'hood.

786
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,900
But you want to take on
my man C, here...

787
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,600
...go ahead, because, you know...

788
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,000
...he's fierce,
he gonna come up in your face...

789
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,700
...he'll damage you.
You gonna walk away, maybe limp.

790
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,100
But I say talk to the hand, call waiting,
because he's out. Boy is out.

791
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,100
I can't restrains him. Because
I'm conversating you right now...

792
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:50,700
...to give him a chance to cool down,
to get back to a realistic level...

793
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,300
...as we were. Because we could be
chilling in our crib.

794
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,200
Not just on this mobile home thing,
representing Malibu...

795
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,200
...and Westwood, you know.

796
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,000
Malling it, like we all can.
Boys to mensch.

797
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,200
Pimp my Mercedes, call me back...

798
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
...put you on hold.
You know what I'm saying?

799
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,600
We gotta go.

800
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,500
You better, man. Don't make me
call my lawyer, because I'll audit.

801
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,300
Aren't you glad Dad came?
They were about to kick your butt.

802
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,100
Carl.
That's not helpful. Carl.

803
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,500
Carl.

804
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,100
It occurs to me that you and I
haven't had too many...

805
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,900
...7th Heaven kind of dialogues
in the last year.

806
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,000
-You're busy a Iot.
-Yeah, but not too busy to notice...

807
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,700
...that you are sensitive
about your size.

808
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,400
I'll bet you $1 000 right now
you'll grow up bigger than me.

809
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,300
I've seen pictures of you when you
were my age. You were huge.

810
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,800
-You were shaving already.
-Yeah, well, that's my point.

811
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,500
See, I achieved maturity very early.

812
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,900
I stopped growing
after the eighth grade.

813
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:49,200
But you have the other body type.
You're like my friend John Vigoshi.

814
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,200
When he was 1 6,
he had a 9-inch summer.

815
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,400
How do you mean that?

816
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,400
He grew very tall, very quickly,
and so will you.

817
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,100
And you're being proactive.
You're lifting weights.

818
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,400
And when you grow up big,
you know what we'll do?

819
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,800
What?

820
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,400
We'll enter father-son
extreme-fighting competitions.

821
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,700
-All right.
-You'll have to push the wheelchair.

822
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,900
But we'll get them high,
and we'll get them Iow.

823
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,700
Coming at you a little heat right now.

824
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,500
Give me a little heat there.
A little heat. A little pepper there.

825
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,100
Hike! All right.

826
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,000
What's up?

827
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,600
Kids, dinner's gonna be a little late
because--

828
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,300
Sorry. False alarm.

829
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,100
-The buzzing is not me.
-Bob.

830
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,900
-Hello.
-Before you hang up on me again...

831
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,000
...we need to talk.

832
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,300
I'm sorry, I can't hear you very well.

833
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,500
Signal. No, no. Yeah.

834
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,100
Hold on one second. The signal.

835
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,800
Just a-- Can you hear me now?

836
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,700
-Hey, Todd. Did you get the proposal?
-Not bad.

837
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,700
My Laird didn't like it very much.

838
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,700
-Who cares what Laird thinks.
-I do. He's young, Bob.

839
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,700
We'll talk about it tonight
on the plane.

840
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,200
-No.
-No?

841
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:17,200
I flew in last night. It's a mile high here
and I want to get acclimated.

842
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,600
You don't wanna have a nose bleed
in a presentation.

843
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,200
Could be a little embarrassing.

844
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,600
So I'll see you there. Here.

845
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,500
Mom, he's suffering.

846
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,300
Honey, can I help?

847
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,900
No, honey.
No, don't come down here.

848
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,100
Boy, I'm just gonna try
and clean up a little--

849
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,800
Don't use bark.

850
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,900
These are great.

851
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,500
Yeah, there it is. That does the trick.

852
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,800
Ferns. Nature's broom.

853
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,900
Honey, no. You can't go on like this.
It's 1 0 miles.

854
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,800
No,
I don't wanna spoil it for you guys.

855
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,100
-You won't. We'll go tomorrow.
-No.

856
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,600
Tomorrow we go to the lake.

857
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,400
Listen, I'll stay here. You go on.

858
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,600
-I don't know--
-Go. It's a beautiful hike.

859
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,000
Guys?

860
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,100
Come on, kids.

861
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,400
Yeah? Okay.

862
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,900
Good.

863
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,100
I'll try and make it back to the RV.

864
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,100
I'm okay. Got my ferns.

865
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,700
Okay. I'm okay.

866
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:30,100
Go on. Go on, you guys.
Save yourself. Okay.

867
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,200
Welcome to the RoadMate 700.

868
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,600
Hi, Lola. My wife's not here.

869
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,900
-The hell are you driving?
-Cadillac of RVs, Todd.

870
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,500
You know, we should go over-- Laird.

871
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,300
Yeah, I decided
to go with Laird's presentation.

872
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,900
-But hang around, tell a few jokes.
-You got it.

873
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,800
Hi there.

874
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,000
-Larry Moiphine.
-Garry Moiphine.

875
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,100
-Cute dog.
-Oh, yeah. She's a sweetie.

876
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,000
Oh, yeah, who's a good girl?

877
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,400
-Todd?
-No.

878
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,000
-Bob.
-Hi, Bob.

879
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,400
-Laird.
-Hi, Laird.

880
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,800
Larry. Laird.

881
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,100
So, fellas, we'll have a little nosh
and we'll hear your presentation.

882
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,800
-Tammy's not here yet. Our assistant.
-So we'll eat slow.

883
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,400
-Come on.
-Gentlemen.

884
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,600
Oh, hi. Hi. Sorry I'm late.

885
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,300
You guys have all just got to see
the circus before it leaves.

886
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,500
-It's good, huh?
-It was amazing.

887
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,100
Wow, so....

888
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:37,900
Oh, of course. I believe you folks
have a presentation for us.

889
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:43,100
-Yes. Laird.
-Good Iuck.

890
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:54,000
In 1 985, Pure Vibe soda completed
a friendly takeover...

891
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,800
...of Mr. Twinkle Iced Tea.
Today, Mr. Twinkle is worth...

892
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,200
...an estimated $91 million.

893
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,800
And that was with a profit definition
not as favorable...

894
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,600
...as the one Pure Vibe is offering...

895
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,100
...Alpine Soda.
If you turn to chart number one--

896
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,500
Sorry, is this just gonna be
about money?

897
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,000
No, it's-- Stocks.

898
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,700
Other than money,
why should we change from a Iocal...

899
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:19,100
...family-oriented business to become
subsidiary to a national brand?

900
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,600
Yeah. Other than money?

901
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,100
-Right.
-Yeah.

902
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,100
Garry, Larry.

903
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,500
Fifty years ago, if you walked down
any street in America...

904
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:35,300
...on a warm Monday night--
Thanks, Laird.

905
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:39,200
--you'd hear I Love Lucy coming out
of every house, on every block.

906
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,600
I'm not speaking about conformity,
I'm talking about "Isn't it great?"

907
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,000
And every once in a while...

908
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,400
...America falls in Iove with something
together.

909
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,000
That could happen here.
You have a terrific product.

910
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,500
Money aside, how'd
Walter Frederick Morrison feel...

911
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,200
...every time he walked by a park
and he'd see people...

912
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,700
...throwing a Frisbee and the dog
doing all the work?

913
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,900
If Pure Vibe takes Alpine national,
I think we have a chance...

914
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:03,400
...to let America fall in Iove
with something again.

915
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,100
What's your hurry? Why don't
you stay and bask in my gratitude?

916
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,200
I gotta get the RV back right now,
Todd...

917
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,100
...or I have to pay for a full day.

918
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,200
-Well, just picture me hugging you.
-Thanks.

919
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:30,200
Officer? Excuse me.
What's going on?

920
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,300
Landslide.
We're diverting through I-70.

921
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,800
I-70? It'll take hours. Isn't there
another way around Mount Watson?

922
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,200
Diablo Pass. But you're not
gonna make it in that rig.

923
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,800
Dad was right.
This is really amazing.

924
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,700
Yeah. Poor Dad.

925
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,800
Should we cut this short
and go back?

926
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,100
-Yeah.
-Okay.

927
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,000
You are not on any marked road.

928
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,400
I know that, Lola.

929
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,200
Make a U-turn
at the next legal opportunity.

930
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,600
I can't.

931
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,200
Squeeze them cheeks
Tighten them buns

932
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,100
Come on now
We having fun

933
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:09,100
Big old rolling turd coming through
Coming through

934
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,200
- You are not on any marked road.
-Shut up!

935
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,200
Come on, Turd. Keep rolling.
Come on. Come on.

936
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,200
You can do it.

937
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,100
Come on.

938
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:50,100
Come on. Come on. Come on.

939
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,300
Damn it.

940
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,800
Make a U-turn
at the next legal opportunity.

941
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,200
Dad's gonna be surprised
we got back so soon.

942
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,600
Yeah.

943
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,200
Who was that maniac?

944
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,000
Oh, God.

945
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,800
Bob?

946
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,600
-Jamie.
-Why are you laying on the ground?

947
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:59,200
Honey,
there's something I need to tell you.

948
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,600
I need....

949
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,300
Needed a....

950
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,200
Needed a little fresh air.

951
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,700
After my incident.

952
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,100
And how are you now?

953
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,300
Good.

954
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,800
Really good. Good.

955
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,700
Oh, yeah.

956
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,400
-Hello?
-Bob? Bob-orino? Bobcat?

957
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,700
-Yeah?
-Teeny tiny wrinkle-dinkle.

958
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,700
Larry wants you
to come back tomorrow...

959
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,100
...and pitch the whole company,
all the employees.

960
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,100
Majority want the merger,
it's a done deal.

961
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,500
-What?
-We don't need him.

962
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,300
I can do this. Give me another chance.
Let me kick this through the uprights!

963
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:48,500
-I'll do it. I'm there.
-Great. You're spitting on me.

964
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:56,200
Big old rolling turd coming through
Coming through

965
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,200
Oh, we're on that road
On a big, steaming load

966
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,900
Big old rolling turd coming through
Coming through

967
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:10,900
Big old rolling turd
Big old rolling turd coming through

968
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,400
Hey, Dad. Maybe we can go
to Yellowstone on the way home.

969
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:21,100
-I'd Iove to go to Yellowstone.
-Yeah, Dad. Can we?

970
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,700
Absolutely.

971
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,500
Come on. I wanna show you
something wonderful.

972
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,700
It's hard to forget this place.

973
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,600
My dad was so moved by it
he said:

974
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,700
"You know, a snack stand up here
would do tremendous."

975
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
My mom, always supportive:
"And who's gonna run it, Allan, you?"

976
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:47,600
My dad: "Why don't you blow it out
your big, saggy rear end, Ellen."

977
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,600
Can't buy memories like that.

978
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,600
Or like this.

979
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,100
Hey. You know, I should take the RV
to get the emergency brake fixed...

980
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,500
-...before we head to L.A.
-Yeah. Good idea.

981
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,300
And you guys don't want
to hang around some dingy garage.

982
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,400
You wait here by the lake,
enjoy the view.

983
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,600
I'll drive to Boulder, be back
in an hour. We'll have a big picnic.

984
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,400
-How about that?
-Okay. Sounds good.

985
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:13,300
Guys? Tell your dad
what you wanted to tell him.

986
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:17,100
-Thank you for taking us on this trip.
-Kinko that.

987
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:21,400
-Better than Hawaii?
-Yeah, better than Hawaii.

988
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,000
Come give big daddy a hug.
Come on.

989
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,800
-Wait.
-Carl, you'll be too big soon.

990
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,400
-Dad.
-Cassie'll be in college.

991
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,600
-Dad!
-What?

992
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,500
The RV's rolling away.

993
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,400
No!

994
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,600
Oh, God, no.

995
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,900
-Oh, no!
-Dad, let it go!

996
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,700
Bob. Bob!

997
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,300
-Bob!
-Mom, what are you doing?

998
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,600
Bob, no!

999
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,900
Go.

1000
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:00,200
Are you crazy? It's a rental.

1001
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,500
-How am I gonna get to the meeting?
-What meeting?

1002
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,300
The Alpine merger.

1003
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,800
Sweetheart, you'll never guess
what happened yesterday.

1004
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,400
-You weren't really sick.
-Not really.

1005
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,300
This is about work.

1006
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:19,100
You brought us out here because
it was close to a meeting?

1007
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,700
-You're getting warmer.
-The Alpine soda merger.

1008
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,600
-Bingo.
-So you lied to me...

1009
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,900
-...from the very beginning.
-Since we were first married?

1010
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:31,600
No, since when you
first brought home the RV.

1011
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,800
-That time, yeah.
-This has nothing to do...

1012
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,900
...with you wanting to be
with your family.

1013
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,500
-So you just used us?
-You wouldn't understand, missy.

1014
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,300
Oh, I don't know, she's pretty smart.

1015
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,400
Why don't you explain it to her.
And Carl too.

1016
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,300
Kids...

1017
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,700
...life is hard.

1018
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,100
Not "The TiVo in my room
is not working" hard.

1019
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:51,600
But "making a living because you're
responsible for people you Iove" hard.

1020
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,500
You know what it's like to be 50,
people are digging a hole...

1021
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,000
-...to bury your career--
-Bob.

1022
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,600
All right, that's a little rough.

1023
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,700
Cassie,
where do you want to go to college?

1024
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,700
Stanford.

1025
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,600
Carl, where's that camp you're going?

1026
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,800
-Alaska.
-Alaska.

1027
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:09,200
And you, how much do you think
that little fixer-upper of ours cost?

1028
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,600
Who has to ride a $4000 bicycle?

1029
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,700
I have to ride a custom bike
because my hips aren't aligned.

1030
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,200
Are you happy? Now the kids know
that their old man's a freak.

1031
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:22,000
Listen, I have to get to that meeting,
or I Iose my job and we Iose a lifestyle.

1032
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,100
Let's pull it up two-by-two,
Iook for help.

1033
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,100
-Carl. Come with me.
-I'm good.

1034
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,400
Cassie?

1035
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,400
I'm gonna Iose my job. I hope the kids
like selling fruit on the freeway.

1036
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,000
You know what's scary
is that this is rush hour.

1037
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Mom, there's never going to be
any other cars on this road.

1038
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,900
Oh, my God.

1039
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,700
-Where's your husband?
-Don't ask.

1040
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,000
Could you possibly
take us to an airport?

1041
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,500
What's all this?

1042
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,900
Oh, I gotta study
for my stupid placement test.

1043
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,900
Oh, like some sort of
vocational training?

1044
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,600
College.

1045
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,900
-How old are you?
-Fifteen and a half. I jumped a grade.

1046
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,500
Moon, though,
she skipped two grades.

1047
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,100
So...

1048
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,500
...you guys are smart.

1049
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,700
Gonna be unemployed.

1050
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:26,500
I'm gonna have to sell my liver
for cash.

1051
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:30,100
And then he just
rode out of the lake.

1052
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,600
Yup. This one really snuck up
and bit me right on the seat-meat.

1053
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,600
I thought Bob was good people.

1054
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,200
-Does anybody have a vomit bag?
-Are you sick?

1055
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,200
Big time.
Cassie and Earl are making out.

1056
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,400
What?

1057
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,300
Don't worry.
I got them in the mirror.

1058
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,200
Boy don't know
what the hell he's doing.

1059
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,100
-Like father, like son.
-Hey.

1060
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,200
Listen, I have to admit something.

1061
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,800
Bob wasn't the only one
trying to avoid you. I was too.

1062
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,000
I don't mean to shock you, but we
ain't everybody's cup of sunshine.

1063
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,200
Well, it was you,
but it was mostly us.

1064
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,600
You didn't exactly catch
the Munros at their best.

1065
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,100
Yeah, see, I had a feeling
you was having troubles.

1066
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,200
Yeah, here's the thing.

1067
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,800
You start off happy and stupid.

1068
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,100
Then you become associates
in the marriage business:

1069
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,800
"Did the plumber come?"
"Take Carl to soccer."

1070
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,100
"I'll pick up your dad
from the doctor's office."

1071
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:20,400
Until you don't remember what
brought you together in the first place.

1072
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,700
You know what I mean?

1073
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,600
No, I don't. I-- No.

1074
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,800
No.

1075
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,600
Okay.

1076
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:33,700
Anyway, in the last few days,
I caught a glimpse of the old us.

1077
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:36,100
And I was happy.

1078
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,000
I better get directions...

1079
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,700
...so I can take you folks
where you need to be.

1080
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,100
Oh, really?

1081
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,200
Jamie!

1082
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:15,100
Cassie! Carl!

1083
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:17,300
Come on, let's hit the road, Jamie.

1084
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,600
Okay.

1085
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,800
Oh, God.

1086
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,300
-Ladies first.
-Oh, boy, that's working it.

1087
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,600
Stop!

1088
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,100
Oh, Munro!

1089
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,500
The hike was so intense...

1090
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:08,500
...there was a few parts where
I had to carry my mom and sister.

1091
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,800
I think I might have pulled a muscle.

1092
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,800
-Where?
-In the woods.

1093
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,200
Travis!

1094
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,000
Jamie.

1095
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,600
Bob?

1096
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:24,000
Are you an idiot? Do you want
your children to see their father...

1097
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,500
...bouncing down the highway?

1098
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,400
Why are you with
the Partridge Family?

1099
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,200
-What are you doing on the bus?
-Because I was chasing you.

1100
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,600
You win. I blew off my job because
I can't live without you. You happy?

1101
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,300
I never asked you to blow off your job.
I wanted you to be honest with me.

1102
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:40,200
Honest. Like, "Todd's gonna fire me
if I go to Boulder" honest?

1103
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,500
-"Screw Hawaii" honest?
-Oh, I see.

1104
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,300
You think that if you told me
you were in trouble...

1105
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:49,700
...and your job was in jeopardy,
that I'd give you a hard time about it?

1106
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:51,100
No crying, that's cheating.

1107
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:54,200
Do you think I'm some horrible witch
that doesn't care? I do care!

1108
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,000
I care a Iot.

1109
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,100
In fact, I hate you. Jerk.

1110
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,000
I didn't want you to know
I was in trouble.

1111
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:07,400
You and Cassie and Carl,
you mean everything to me.

1112
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:11,000
What you think about me is the
most important thing in the world.

1113
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:14,100
I didn't want to fail.

1114
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:19,600
If you don't know how I feel about you
after 1 9 years of marriage...

1115
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,000
...then I must be a failure as a wife.

1116
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,200
Then you admit you're the problem.

1117
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,500
Bob.

1118
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,300
You mean more to me
than just a paycheck.

1119
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:42,600
That's good, because we won't be
getting one for a while.

1120
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,200
I missed that meeting.

1121
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,800
No, you didn't.

1122
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,400
Come on, Bob. Come here.

1123
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,500
It's a Christmas miracle.

1124
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,500
No, it just sounded like this was
where your wife needed to be.

1125
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,500
So I brought her.

1126
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:14,100
Travis has never been one
to mind his own business.

1127
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,000
Travis...

1128
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,000
...some of my behavior on this trip
might be misconstrued as an insult.

1129
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,600
Did come off a tad abrasive.

1130
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,400
I was wrong, and it takes
a small man to admit it.

1131
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,800
And you're a big man.

1132
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,900
-I don't just mean--
-I understand a metaphor, Bob.

1133
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,800
See, I went to Stanford.

1134
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,100
You big Iug, I Iove you!

1135
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,800
Who Ioves his big Iug?

1136
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,100
-I Iove you, you big--
-I know, I--

1137
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:45,100
-Todd.
-Little dramatic, don't you think, Bob?

1138
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,800
Showing up at
the last possible minute.

1139
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,500
You Iook horrible. Let's go.

1140
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,300
Dad.

1141
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,100
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

1142
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:03,100
I guess you're under a Iot of pressure
and I could have been less trouble.

1143
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,300
And in your own nerdy way
you're kind of cool.

1144
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,100
-Bob?
-Yeah?

1145
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,700
I'm hating this.

1146
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,300
-Dad.
-Yeah?

1147
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,800
-I get it.
-What?

1148
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,800
Sometimes if you wanna succeed,
you have to do what they tell you.

1149
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,900
-You--
-Bob!

1150
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,000
This is the big one, Bobcat.

1151
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,600
-Bases Ioaded.
-Got it.

1152
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,600
You hit a grand slam on this,
it's big raise, promotion, bonus...

1153
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,300
...and I personally push Laird
down a flight of stairs.

1154
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:44,600
Everybody, this is Bob.
Remember, charming and funny.

1155
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,500
Hi, everybody. Sorry I'm late...

1156
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:51,100
...I just came down that mountain,
and next time I'll use a road.

1157
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,100
I guess you guys didn't get the memo
about extreme casual.

1158
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,900
I Iove your wilderness so much,
I decided to wear it.

1159
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,200
Easy, Todd.

1160
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:05,100
It's been kind of a wild journey
getting here.

1161
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,600
If you ever wanna really find out
about yourself...

1162
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,900
...put your family in an RV and drive.

1163
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:11,600
I've seen some amazing stuff.

1164
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,500
I've fought wild raccoons and won.
I've been in the desert to a place...

1165
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:19,000
...where it's not the end of the world,
but you can see it from there.

1166
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,400
And I met this weird family.

1167
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,300
I mean, boy, they were strange.

1168
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:27,400
You know, whenever a big white man
picks up a banjo, my cheeks tighten.

1169
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,100
In the dictionary, under "hootenanny,"
it says, "See: them."

1170
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,500
But you know
what's strange about them.

1171
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,400
They're just honest, good people, and
it's an honor to have them as friends.

1172
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,200
Garry, Larry...

1173
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,100
...this is a nice company
you have here. It's your baby.

1174
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:49,100
I bet at the birth of your baby
you were kind of scared, right?

1175
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,100
Excited, but scared. You didn't
know how it was gonna turn out.

1176
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,600
And next thing you know,
it's up and walking...

1177
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,000
...and you're trying to raise it. You
didn't know what you were doing...

1178
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
...but you pretended like you did.

1179
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,900
And next thing you know,
your baby's grown.

1180
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:06,500
It's bigger, older. More complicated.

1181
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,800
Difficult to deal with.

1182
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,200
But here's the deal...

1183
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:15,100
...you care about it just as much,
because you nurtured it...

1184
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:18,500
...and part of you is in it,
and you're proud of it.

1185
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,800
You Iove it more than ever.

1186
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,400
And right now,
you have to make a decision...

1187
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,600
...of whether you wanna merge
your family with the Pure Vibe family.

1188
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,300
Your stocks are gonna split.
You're gonna have money...

1189
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:37,400
...you won't know what to do with.
And your company's gonna grow.

1190
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,500
You'll be bigger than a woman
in bicycle shorts at Disneyland.

1191
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:44,300
You'll be able to get all that stuff,
like the ski boat, a $4000 bike...

1192
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:45,900
...maybe even a Barcalounger...

1193
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,800
...that massages your ass
and blows smoke at the same time.

1194
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,500
Bottom line here, Garry, Larry.

1195
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:53,300
If you wanna merge
Alpine and Pure Vibe...

1196
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:57,500
...I promise you, you're making
the worst decision of your entire life.

1197
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:02,300
This guy is a disgruntled employee.

1198
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,600
Couldn't keep up with younger talent.
Look at him. He's off his meds.

1199
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,300
Finished. His own daughter
assaulted me in my home.

1200
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:11,300
I did not. It was my friend,
and she did it because Pure Vibe...

1201
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:14,100
...has one of the worst
environmental records in the industry.

1202
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:16,300
Why are these kids here?

1203
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:19,800
PIus, last year you guys outsourced
for cheaper labor to other countries--

1204
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,500
Let her go, Todd.

1205
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,600
I'll let her go. I'll let you go.

1206
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,200
You're fired.

1207
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,900
Yo, dog.

1208
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,700
-Carl.
-My hero.

1209
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:42,200
Todd, I quit.

1210
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,700
Honey,
there seems to be snow on the ground.

1211
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,600
Babe, it's left over from last winter.
At 9500 feet...

1212
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,100
...it doesn't melt. It's glacial.

1213
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,400
-We don't have chains.
-Don't need them.

1214
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,200
They're for the winter, not July.

1215
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,200
Well, I see snow.

1216
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,700
Hey, Dad, are we poor?

1217
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,700
Carl, there's a lot of ways
to measure a family's wealth.

1218
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:27,000
-I think love--
-I was talking about money.

1219
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,900
-We're dirt poor.
-Sell the house.

1220
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:31,000
We could all live
in the Big Rolling Turd.

1221
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,900
We'll spend every minute together,
just like the Gornickes.

1222
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:37,300
-That just sounds fantastic.
-Oh, yeah.

1223
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:43,600
-Chains. Four-wheel drive.
-Thanks.

1224
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:48,300
Officer, good day. I know what you're
gonna say: "Where are your chains?"

1225
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,800
Well, sir, this is no ordinary RV.

1226
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,100
It's part ATV, part SUV,
and certified by the DMV.

1227
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:57,800
It's got positraction, Dynaflow,
control traction with me in control.

1228
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,300
It's got heated rims.
Wish I had those.

1229
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,000
Okay.

1230
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,600
License and registration, sir.

1231
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,100
Oh, there it is.

1232
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,300
I believe that was
the rental agreement.

1233
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:26,100
We had a little bit
of a mishap at the lake.

1234
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:29,200
I lost my wallet.
My name is Bob Munro.

1235
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,400
We got him.
We're just ahead of you.

1236
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,200
Got me?

1237
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,400
Officer, I know she may look unsafe,
but she's tough.

1238
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,400
She likes to be rode hard
and put away wet.

1239
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,700
Spent two days in the lake.
Had to fish her out.

1240
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,600
It means a lot.
We couldn't abandon it.

1241
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,100
It's like a big, ugly pet, really.

1242
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,600
You got him. Thanks, Sam.

1243
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,100
-We owe you one.
-We've been chasing you all morning.

1244
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:53,600
I just took one soda.

1245
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,100
No, we just want you to know
we're going national.

1246
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,200
-Well, good luck.
-With you.

1247
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,500
We want you to join us
at Alpine Beverages.

1248
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,800
-You're offering me a job?
-Yeah.

1249
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,200
-Yes, he'll take it.
-She's a tough negotiator.

1250
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,300
You just really seem to get us,
like a harmonic convergence.

1251
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:13,200
-Dad, you forgot something.
-Baby...

1252
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,900
-...don't interrupt daddy's new bosses.
-Sure, but the RV's rolling away.


1253
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,600
