00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,393
JESSE:
Hey, Nelson. Let me order.

163
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,189
<i>WOMAN:
"Chinese Foooood." May I help you?</i>

164
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,749
<i>- I'd like to place an order.
- What you like?</i>

165
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,394
Yeah, I'd like three orders
of garlic chicken.

166
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,194
<i>- And then?
- And then three orders of white rice.</i>

167
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,876
<i>- And then?
- And then...</i>

168
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,832
- Hey, you guys want soup?
- Sure.

169
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,032
<i>- Yeah. Three orders of won ton soup.
- And then?</i>

170
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,392
<i>- Oh, some fortune cookies too.
- And then?</i>

171
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,909
That's about it.

172
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,235
<i>And then?</i>

173
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,799
No, that's it.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,558
<i>- And then?
- No "and then."</i>

175
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,671
L... That's all I want.

176
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,995
<i>And then?</i>

177
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,592
And then... And then nothing else,
because I'm done ordering. Okay?

178
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,233
<i>And then?</i>

179
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,189
See, all I want is the three orders
of the garlic chicken...

180
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,475
...and the white rice.

181
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,789
<i>And then?</i>

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,798
- And the soup, dude.
- Oh, and the won ton soup.

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,275
<i>- And then?
- And the cookies, fortune.</i>

184
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,833
And the fortune cookies.

185
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,237
So it's just the chicken, the rice...

186
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,153
...the soup and the fortune cookies,
and that's it.

187
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,398
<i>And then?</i>

188
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,195
And then you can put it
in a brown paper bag...

189
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,153
...and put it in my hand,
because I'm ready to eat.

190
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,193
<i>And then?</i>

191
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,478
I refuse to play
your Chinese food mind games.

192
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,240
<i>- And then?
- No! No "and then"!</i>

193
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,675
<i>- And then?
- No "and then"!</i>

194
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,757
<i>- And then?
- No "and then"!</i>

195
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,473
<i>- And then?
- No! No "and then"!</i>

196
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,070
<i>- And then?
- You're starting to piss me off, lady.</i>

197
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,475
<i>- And then?
- And then...</i>

198
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,309
...I'm gonna come in there
and put my foot in your ass...

199
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,074
...if you say "and then" again!

200
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,039
<i>And then and then
and then and then and then...</i>

201
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,675
<i>And then?</i>

202
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,599
Come on, Nelson,
just help us find my car.

203
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,917
You didn't have to go all "egg roll"
on that speaker box.

204
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,634
I'm not the one that called
the Dalai Lama a fag.

205
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,833
- I was just kidding around.
- Well, Nelson didn't appreciate it.

206
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,277
Look, it's Christie Boner.

207
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,917
Wow! The hottest of the hot.

208
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,590
<i>El fuego of all that is el fuego.</i>

209
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,950
- Did she just wave at us?
- No way. She would never wave at us.

210
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,957
Then why did she just wave at us?

211
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,799
I don't know. Maybe she thinks
we're other people.

212
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,115
People she waves to.

213
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,873
Hi, Chester.

214
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,589
Hi.

215
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,430
Hi, Jesse. I had a really
good time with you last night.

216
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,590
- Me too.
- That was some crazy party.

217
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,198
- Hey, have you seen my car?
- Well, I saw it last night.

218
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,512
I mean, I saw the back seat.

219
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,556
- I mean the whole thing.
- Get another one with all the money...

220
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,876
...you were throwing around.
- Money?

221
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,231
Yeah. You had that really nice
suitcase full of money.

222
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,474
- A suitcase full of money?
- Don't you remember giving me $500...

223
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,716
...to show you my hoo-hoos?

224
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,068
- $500?
- Hoo-hoos?

225
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,919
You mean, you don't remember anything?

226
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,429
How about now?

227
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,755
No.

228
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,311
How about now?

229
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,879
I'm a little bit fuzzy too.

230
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,072
Maybe if I could get
a little refresher course.

231
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,999
- All right.
- Go.

232
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,235
- Are these losers bothering you?
- No, Tommy.

233
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,278
Guys like you could never score
with a chick like this.

234
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,074
- Stick to your own kind.
- Don't be such a jerk.

235
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,475
Next time you guys
bother my girlfriend...

236
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,672
...stoner-bashing time.
- Oh, yeah?

237
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,995
Yeah.

238
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,039
- Okay.
- Consider this your warning.

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,433
Later, dudes!

240
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,189
CHESTER: Dude, you touched
Christie Boner's hoo-hoo.

241
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,555
Shibby!

242
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,034
Low-five.

243
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,156
CHESTER: Yeah.
JESSE: Let's get out of here.

244
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,035
Chester!

245
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,993
Dude, that Christie Boner
is super hot.

246
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,430
Where did we get a suitcase
full of money?

247
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,914
Why don't we have it now?

248
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,873
Maybe we deposited it
in a Swiss bank account.

249
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,791
Now, if we had a ridiculous
sum of money, where would we go?

250
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,715
Dude.

251
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,748
Sweet!

252
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,830
No way we were here last night.

253
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,795
We'd never fit in
at a place like this.

254
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,390
Look everyone!
It's Mr. Jesse and Mr. Chester!

255
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,752
Look at the toggles on that kitten.

256
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,671
Good afternoon, Jesse, Chester.
How are we feeling today?

257
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,959
A little fuzzy.

258
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,515
Hi, Chester. Hi, Jesse.

259
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,915
Did you guys enjoy
yourselves last night?

260
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,191
- Have we met?
- It's me, Tania.

261
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,192
Remember last night
when I gave you...

262
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,989
...that super-special,
slippery-wet lapdance?

263
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,188
Of course. How can I forget?

264
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,836
You want to do it again?

265
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,112
This time, it's on me.

266
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,996
If you say so.

267
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,151
Didn't I get a special lapdance?

268
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,152
Did you ever.

269
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,039
Sweet!

270
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,879
Sweet!

271
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,873
So...

272
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,959
...just how super-special
can a slippery lapdance be?

273
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,513
What the hell were you thinking,
throwing around my money like that?

274
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,076
- You're a...
- I'm a gender-challenged male.

275
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,993
What does that mean?

276
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,836
Oh, dude, you're a dude! That's...

277
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,235
You...

278
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,316
Last night, I had you sneak a suitcase
of stolen money out of here.

279
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,074
- Stolen money?
- $200,000.

280
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,594
$200,000!

281
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,837
I gave you the case and left.
We were supposed to meet.

282
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,998
But you never showed up!
Where's that suitcase?

283
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,912
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

284
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,000
- Where's that suitcase?
- It's in my car.

285
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,590
Then get it. Fast.
Or else you'll be singing soprano.

286
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,952
Dude. Dude, dude!

287
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,793
- We gotta go.
- Are you crazy?

288
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,837
I'm with breakdancing strippers.

289
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,190
Seriously, dude, this is an emergency.

290
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,555
So is this, dude.

291
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,320
It's a breakdancing
stripper emergency.

292
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,549
- Goodbye!
WOMEN: Bye, Chester!

293
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,239
I love you!

294
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,189
We were supposed to meet her with
the suitcase, but we didn't show up.

295
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,473
Sounds like us.
How wasted were we last night?

296
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,797
I touched Christie's hoo-hoo,
we're on the hook for $200,000...

297
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,037
...that belongs to a transsexual
stripper, and my car's gone.

298
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,268
- I'd say we were pretty wasted.
- We really need to find your car.

299
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,229
Okay, let's see. The last place
we remember being last night was...

300
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,359
The twins'. But we can't show up
without the anniversary gifts.

301
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,438
I got it! We'll get them
a little something for now.

302
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,758
When we find the car, we'll give them
the real gifts. That's a dollar...

303
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,348
...thirty-nine.

304
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,949
- I don't know.
- Trust me.

305
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,549
- It'll be totally cool. Let's go.
- Okay.

306
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,717
We are so dead.

307
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,872
I roger that.

WILMA: What do you guys have to say?</i>

310
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,070
Happy anniversary.

311
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,797
We ate the dark ones.
We know you guys don't like those.

312
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,310
Dark ones are the only ones
we do like.

Oh, yeah.

314
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,479
But you could use the box to keep...

00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,510
- Lf there's time, you do him.
- Dude...

476
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,039
- Deal.
- Sweet!

477
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,798
- Wait a second.
- Thank you.

478
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,117
Come here. Those space nerds
told us not to trust anybody.

479
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,677
Yeah, but for the love of God,
they're offering us oral pleasure!

480
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,233
What...?

481
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,871
- Okay.
- Okay.

482
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,150
Hey. Where did the hot chicks go?

483
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,596
Where's my money, boys?

484
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,675
We were just going to get it.

485
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,633
You picked the wrong
transsexual stripper to screw with.

486
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,632
CHESTER:
You're pinching me.

487
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,792
Well, let's see what the cops
have to say about this.

488
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,395
- You're busted.
- Busted.

489
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,030
- B-U-S-T, busted.
- This one.

490
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,837
<i>- These guys.
- Chester! I saw this on COPS!</i>

491
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,793
- Kick hard and hit back!
- Bye-bye, boys.

492
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,475
CHESTER:
Put on the siren.

493
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,994
You're sticking to the
"I don't remember" crap.

494
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,593
Yeah. We don't remember.

495
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,876
Last night, your car
was spotted leaving...

496
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,152
...the scene of a major drug deal.
- You found my car.

497
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,631
You guys got more important things
to worry about right now.

498
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,077
Where were you between
midnight and 2 a.m. Last night?

499
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,029
I told you, okay?
We don't remember anything.

500
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,038
I see we're gonna have to do
this the hard way.

501
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,679
Where were you last night between
the hours of midnight and 2 a.m.?

502
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,797
We don't know.

503
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,035
What the...?

504
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,835
- Now do you remember?
- No.

505
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,115
- How about now?
- No.

506
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,073
Hey, leave him alone!
He doesn't know anything!

507
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,191
- Now are you ready to talk?
- Dude, we don't remember!

508
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,872
Okay, here are the whips
you guys wanted.

509
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,831
Hey, it's the donut guys.

510
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,633
These two were at
the Donut House last night.

511
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,276
We started talking and they bought
donuts for the whole precinct.

512
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,436
What time did all this happen?

513
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,518
Let's see. Must've been
between midnight and 2 a.m.

514
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,394
Damn!

515
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,116
You can't be the guys
we're looking for. Sorry.

516
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,549
Hang in there, bro.

517
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,995
- Come on, Kojak.
- All right.

518
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,511
I'm really sorry about all this.

519
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,234
Looks like it was a case
of mistaken identity.

520
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,278
Actually, those are
the real criminals over there.

521
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,875
One of our officers...

522
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,755
...made a wrong identification.
- Yeah, that was me.

523
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,518
I'm sorry about that, fellas.

524
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,029
Rick will tell you exactly
where your car is.

525
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,911
- We found the car.
- We found the car.

526
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,758
We found the car!

527
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,951
<i>- Yeah, we found the car.
- Found my car.</i>

528
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,273
Now we get the gifts, go to the twins'
house, and get our special treats.

529
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,839
Sweet!

530
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,640
Give us the keys
and we're out of here.

531
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,239
You got it.

532
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,075
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

533
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,633
What's the problem, Rick?

534
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,558
Nothing, I just... Boy.

535
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,398
Okay. Jeez.

536
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,549
Did you say you wanted your car back,
or you wanted it impounded?

537
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,753
We want the car back, please.

538
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,350
Oh, I see. That's kind of funny,
because what happened was...

539
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,269
...I accidentally sent your car
to the impound.

540
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,839
- Rick.
RICK: I know.

541
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,270
I can definitely tell you this.
You guys...

542
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,590
...can get the car back in a few days.

543
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,031
We don't have a few days, Rick.
We need the car back now.

544
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,312
Say, how about a treat?
There's Bavarian cream.

545
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,876
- Yeah.
- That's a good one there.

546
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,753
- It's good.
- It's great. I have a lot of them.

547
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,837
- You know what? Forget about it.
- Okay.

548
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,395
- Psych!
- Oh, jeez. You got me.

549
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,795
Hey, fellows, who's the goose? Me.

550
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,554
You're such a joker.

551
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,035
PIZZACOLl:
One.

552
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,319
- Damn!
CHICK 1: Where are Jesse and Chester?

553
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,279
- What?
- We're looking for Jesse and Chester.

554
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,398
I don't know where they are...

555
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,670
...but I bet those punks
over there do.

556
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,995
So then, remember?
I said, "Later, dudes."

557
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,076
- Why were you with those jerks anyway?
- They were just being nice...

558
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,713
...unlike someone I know.

559
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,798
Maybe it's time I find someone
with a sensitive side.

560
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,190
Someone who respects me as a person.

561
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,715
Maybe somebody like Jesse or Chester.

562
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,238
Okay, listen up.
We're gonna find Jesse and Chester.

563
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,358
And when we do, stoner-bashing time!

564
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,279
CHICK 1: Do you know Jesse and Chester?
- Who are you?

565
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,557
- We are hot chicks.
- Yes, you are.

566
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,593
We believe they have
the continuum transfunctioner.

567
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,555
However, if you recover the continuum
transfunctioner from them...

568
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,638
...and bring it to us,
we will give you erotic pleasure.

569
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,558
You've got yourselves a deal.

570
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,956
Okay, guys. Okay, guys, new plan.

571
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,835
First, we find those stoners,
get the continuum transfunctioner...

572
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,998
...then, it's jerk-bashing time.
- Yeah!

573
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,839
Oh, yeah.

574
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,156
I just remembered where
you might be able to find them.

575
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,036

Try it again. Okay?
Just knock it out of the park.

579
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,872
All right, give it a shot.

580
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,113
Okay, you almost got it.

581
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,949
Now just concentrate on the beep,
swing as hard as you can...

582
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,071
...and keep your ear on the ball.
Okay?

583
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,475
All right, little buddy,
you can do it!

- Pardon me?

- We're looking for Jesse and Chester.

We're extremely hot chicks

Really?

590
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,068
Can I touch your face?
It's the only way I can see...

591
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,748
...who I'm talking to.
- Okay.

592
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,591
Wow! You are hot.

593
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,756
Is this normal?

594
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,112
Oh, yeah. This is how
blind people shake hands.

- Sammy, you're up next.
- Okay...

- Anthony, what is going on?

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,074
Nothing. I was just reading.

Bye, ladies, I need to be alone now.

- Who are you guys?

602
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,515
We are not guys. We are hot chicks.

603
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,873
We're supposed to meet them later,
but we can't wait.

- We don't know where they are.
- And frankly, we don't care.

this continuum transfunctioner thing.

- You got the continuum transfunctioner?

Who are you guys?

We are the keepers
of the continuum transfunctioner.

00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,751
It is all that stands between
the universe and destruction.

623
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,996
It is a mysterious
and powerful device.

00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,953
And its mystery
is only exceeded by its power.

- We know.
- We don't have it.

But the universe?

00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,916
Screw the universe.

628
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,518
Screw the universe?

629
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,633
<i>WOMAN: Chimpanzees often use sticks
as crude tools.</i>

630
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,035
JESSE:
That is one smart primate.

631
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,271
(KNOCKING)

632
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,671
- Hey.
- Hey.

633
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,074
JESSE:
What are you doing here?

634
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,511
We just wanted to see
how that car trouble thing was going.

635
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,270
Oh, the car. It's in the shop.

636
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,430
WILMA:
Really?

637
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,438
The shop run by beautiful women
in black jumpsuits?

638
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,631
The ones you were
hanging with earlier?

639
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,037
- Well, you see, Jesse thought...
WANDA: Today's our anniversary.

640
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,038
- Not only do you not have gifts.
WILMA: But you guys ditch us...

641
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,719
...for some big-breasted bimbos...

642
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,673
...while we're cleaning our house...
WILMA: Which you trashed.

643
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,029
Twice.

644
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,912
- You're sucky boyfriends.
- But...

645
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,033
We just wanted to come
and tell you in person that it's over.

646
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,234
- Wilma?
- Thank you, Wanda.

647
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,071
- They're totally right.
- Yeah.

648
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,396
We are sucky boyfriends.

649
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,592
Do you even remember
what kind of gifts we got them?

650
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,758
- I bet we got them sucky gifts.
- Yeah.

651
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,952
We suck.

652
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,196
Wait, I just got a really bad feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

653
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,517
You should go sit on the toilet.

654
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,514
No, no.
You know what the feeling is?

655
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,599
It's love.

656
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,357
- Is that what that is?
- Yeah.

657
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,597
I'm in love with Wanda.
And you're in love with Wilma.

658
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,959
But see, now that we know...

659
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,993
...that we've been sucky boyfriends,
we can change.

660
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,873
- We can?
- Yeah. And you know what else?

661
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,595
I'll bet you that we did buy them
super-cool anniversary gifts.

662
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,791
You know why? Because we love them.

663
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,877
Are they wrapped in cool paper?

664
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,315
Yeah. I'll tell you what we'll do.

665
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,036
We'll go to the impound lot, get
the car, which has the gifts in it...

666
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,869
...and then go to the twins' house,
and beg for them to take us back!

667
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,197
Yeah! Let's do it.

668
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,232
No, hold on. I gotta take a crap.

669
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,635
- Told you.
- I know.

670
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,829
I know your body.

671
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,869
Boys, I got some good news.
We just got your car in this morning.

672
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,554
All right!

673
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,273
But the bad news is...

674
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,552
...not only did Officer Boyer
send your car to the impound...

675
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,911
...he tagged it for auction
and it was sold this afternoon.

676
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,195
Rick.

677
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,074
- Do you know who bought the car?
- I have the address right here.

678
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,872
All right.

679
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,435
But it'd be against Regulation...

680
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,996
...457XY2-665 to give it to you.

681
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,639
Come on. Just...

682
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,879
Reaching onto this side
of the counter isn't allowed.

683
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,590
The last guy who tried it ended up
with three broken fingers.

684
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,428
- Reach it.
- You can reach it!

685
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,915
No, I got...
One of these has carpal tunnel.

686
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,634
What if I further injure myself?

687
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,428
I have to do everything.

688
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,950
I'm a better lookout.
My vision's better. You know that.

689
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,754
That's it, that's it.

690
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,679
- Got it!
- We're good, we're good.

691
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,831
- What are you doing?
- Dude, I'm stuck!

692
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,759
- Come on. I'm stuck.
- You seriously stuck?

693
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,989
Don't!

694
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,799
Dude, here she comes! Help!

695
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,073
Get it!

696
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,196
Hold on, hold on. I gotta get...

697
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,919
Okay, okay.

698
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,833
- I got it, I got it.
- Help me!

699
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,395
We'll spit on it.
You know, lubrication.

700
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,318
- That's gross, dude!
- Okay, fine.
