Well, if you don't know...

there's a chance, right?

902
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:40,433
I mean, it would be like
if someone was in the hospital
and he was seriously ill...

903
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:44,104
and the doctor said, ''I don't know if
this patient has a chance of survival.''

904
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:47,012
That doesn't mean the patient's
definitely gonna die, does it?
I mean, he might live.

905
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,052
- Even if it's a remote possibility.
- I suppose so.

- So we have a chance.
- Shut up, Rob.

what chance do we have?

- Nine.

so I can get my stuff packed up?

No problem.

- Yes, please.

Laura, can I ask you
one question?

Yes. One.

You're not gonna like it.

Better than what?

Well... sex, I guess.
Is it better?

what's bothering you?

Yes. Yes, of course.

Do you really think
it would make a difference either way?

- I don't know.
- Well, the answer is,
I don't know either.

No. I was living

Sleeping together is better.

Sleeping together is better?

because you haven't done it yet?

Great sense of humor about it, and I can

I express regret,
I say nice things about her...

of melancholy just below the surface.

Which is all bullshit, really.

I've just invented a sketch
of a decent, sensitive guy...

And I guess all that charming,
nervous stuff seems to work somehow...

back to her house and...

Yet! What does ''yet''
mean anyway?

It means you're gonna do it,
doesn't it? Or does it?

Just come on. What would it mean
to you, that sentence:

01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,434
''I haven't seen
Evil Dead II yet''?

1014

that you're a liar.

You've seen it twice. Once with Laura--
oops-- and once with me and Dick.

that guy making shotgun ammo
off-screen in the 1 4th century.

01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,141
Right. But let's just say
that I hadn't seen it.

1018
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:29,616
And I said, ''I haven't seen
Evil Dead II yet.'' What would you think?

1019

I'd think that you're a cinematic idiot,
and I'd feel sorry for you.

1020

All right. But from that
one sentence, would you think
that I was going to see it?

I'm sorry, Rob.
I'm struggling here.

1022
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,726
You're asking me what would I
think if you told me...

you hadn't seen a film
that you have already seen.

1024

If I said to you--

1025
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,836
''I haven't seen
Evil Dead II yet,'' yes.

1026
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,705
Would you get the impression
that I really wanted to see it?

1027
01:01:54,811 --> 01:02:00,010
Oh, well, you couldn't have been
desperate to see it,
otherwise you'd have already gone.

1028
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:03,347
Right. I'm not
gonna see that movie.

1029
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:10,254
But the word ''yet.''
Yeah, you know what?

1030
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:13,055
I get the impression
that you wanted to see it...

1031
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,256
otherwise you'd have said
you didn't want to go.

1032
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:18,458
But in your opinion,
would I definitely go?

How the fuck am I supposed
to know? Probably.

1034

- Why?
- Because it's a brilliant film.

1035

It's so funny and violent,
and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.

I miss about Laura.

1309
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:00,387
One: sense of humor. Very dry,
but it can also be warm and forgiving.

1310
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:04,124
And she's got one of the best
all-time laughs in the history

1311
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:06,598
She laughs
with her entire body.

1312
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:09,397
Two: She's got character.

1313
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:12,769
Or at least she had character
before the Ian nightmare.

1314
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:14,774
She's loyal and honest...

1315
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,970
and she doesn't even take it out
on people when she's having a bad day.

1316
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:20,274
That's character.

1317
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:22,441
Three:

1318
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,384
I miss her smell...

1319
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:31,391
and the way she tastes.

1320
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,553
It's a mystery of human chemistry,
and I don't understand it.

1321
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:39,896
Some people, as far as your senses
are concerned,just feel like home.

1322
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:47,440
I really dig
how she walks around.

1323
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:50,568
It's like she doesn't care how
she looks or what she projects.

1324
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:55,378
And it's not that she doesn't care,
it's just-- She's not affected, I guess.

1325
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:57,747
And that gives her grace.

1326
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,755
And five: She does this thing in bed
when she can't get to sleep.

1327
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:05,156
She kind of half-moans
and then rubs her feet together
an equal number of times.

1328
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,751
It just kills me.

1329
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,424
Believe me, I could do
a top-five-things about her
that drive me crazy...

1330
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:14,559
but it's just your garden-variety women,
you know, schizo stuff...

1331
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:17,968
and that's the kind of thinking
that got me here.

1332
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,906
Ahhh! Damn!

1333
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:28,505

that they're just fantasies.

You know? And they always
seem really great...

never any problems.

great lingerie. But you also
have the cotton underwear...

It's just I don't have to see it
because it's not in the fantasy.

Do you understand?
I'm tired of the fantasy...

really exist.
