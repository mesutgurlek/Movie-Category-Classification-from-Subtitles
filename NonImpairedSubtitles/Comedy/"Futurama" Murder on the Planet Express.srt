[Buttons beeping]

329

It's time we solved this
problem the old-fashioned way.

330
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,532
By shooting it.

331
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,468
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you
can't give everybody guns.

332
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,628
What if one of us is the creature?

333
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:12,972
It could be any of us.

[All gasping]

340

One of us must be the bad creature.

- Is it me maybe?
- [Growling]

Quick, in here.

346

We're the only ones left
who can trust each other.

347
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:43,699
I know you well enough that
no creature could ever fool me.

348
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,650
No matter how much it looked like you.

349
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:48,315
Leela, I'm honored,
but for your own safety,

350
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:50,701
you shouldn't trust anyone, not even me.

351
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:53,098
But I'm just so scared.

352
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,259
Kiss me.

[Both moaning]

Easy, easy, you're biting my lip.

00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:02,801
Sorry.

356

Ow, ow, ow!

357
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:08,127
Wait a second, I know
what's going on here.

358
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,539
I'm the monster.

[Whimpering]

362
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:19,157
The creature was right behind me.

363
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:20,725
I don't know where it went.

364
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:24,296
[Groans] Just leave me alone.
I'm really, really scared.

365
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:26,164
Uh, Bender?

366
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:27,388
What?

367
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:29,217
Where'd you get those ears?

368
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:30,809
I've always had ears.

369
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,059
No, you haven't.

370
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,373
All right, fine, you got me. I can't
keep track of every little detail.

Okay, to see if you're the real Bender,

375
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:52,223
I'm gonna ask you something
only he would know.

376
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:55,093
On your last birthday,
what gift did I get you?

377
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:56,974
- I don't remember.
- Me neither.

378
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,596
Okay, I'll ask you one.

379
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:01,866
What's the square root of 2,345.4?

380
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,786
That's not something I would know.

381
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:05,437
Oh, yeah. Your turn.

382
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:07,956
Um, what color is my shirt?

383
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:11,209
If I were the creature, I could
just look at your shirt, dum-dum.

384
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,210
Good point.

385
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:13,945
Aw, never mind this.

386
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,576
In case I'm about to die,

387
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:19,384
I just want you to know that I did
polish my ass with your toothbrush.

388
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:21,219
Thanks for telling me, buddy.

389
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,713
And to be honest, I am jealous
of how shiny your ass is,

390
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:29,104
and sometimes at night, I
unpolish it with sandpaper.

391
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:31,296
Aw, I trust you.

392
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:32,895
I trust you, too.

393
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:33,939
[Door whooshes open]

- Congratulations.
- [Both yell]

395
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:39,037
You two have really
learned the power of trust.

396
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,039
Get away from us, you monster.

397
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,859
[Laughs]

398
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,309
Don't worry. There
isn't really a monster.

399
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,111
And no one really got eaten.

400
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:49,580
The whole thing was just part
of our team-building experience.

401
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:51,883
And you two did terrific.

402
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:53,885
But-but what about that hitchhiker?

403
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:55,887
You mean my partner, Blorgulax?

404
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:58,156
He does make a convincing hitchhiker.

405
00:18:58,157 --> 00:19:00,258
But he majored in business at Princeton.

406
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:01,993
But we saw him change shape.

407
00:19:01,994 --> 00:19:04,062
Yes, he is a shape-shifter.

408
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,565
But he uses his shape-shifting
for team-building, not evil.

409
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:09,167
He pretends to eat some people.

410
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:10,502
The others have to work together.

411
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:12,103
We hand out a few tote bags.

And boom! Four percent increase
in productivity minimum.

413

So no one's dead?

00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:22,013
Of course not. All your friends are
on the bridge having a pizza party.

Where's McMasters?

425
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:57,219
He turned out to be such
a nice guy, didn't he?

426
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,410
Totally, we should go on a
retreat like this every year.
