1
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,873
My good brother.

2
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,710
That"s it? No suitcase?

3
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,152
Let"s just get out of here.

4
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,912
Don"t smoke in the car.

5
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,153
- Afternoon, Miss Graves. Welcome.
- Hello.

6
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,069
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.

7
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,958
- Shall I take your coat?
- No, thanks. L"m not staying.

8
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,315
Brad, Dex, sorry I can"t stay for lunch.

9
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,949
I have a board meeting in Detroit.
This won"t take long.

10
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,237
Nothing for me.
No, maybe l"II have a Diet Coke.

11
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,709
Make that Evian water, please.

12
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,878
l"II have San Pellegrino water. No ice.

13
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,430
Here"s the deal. There"s no deal.

14
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,431
- My client balked.
- What do you mean?

15
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,752
- She thinks her company"s worth more.
- She thinks or you think?

16
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,752
On second thought, that looks interesting.

17
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,719
- Just tell us what you want and don"t say...
- Smoked chicken?

18
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,591
l"ve got to make a phone call.

19
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,274
It"s just us here. What are you looking for?

20
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,511
l"m looking for a world of fair play...

21
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,592
...where corporate big guys
don"t always get their way.

22
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,830
Still beating up on your ex-husband?

23
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,957
You"re gonna pay for that one.

24
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,871
Who"s her husband?

25
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,473
Me and my big mouth.

26
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,595
Pookie!

27
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,908
Don"t call me Pookie.

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,072
Sorry. I just meant to be affectionate.
What"s the matter?

29
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,675
Nothing. I'm just in a meeting
and I don't have a lot of time.

30
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,228
Remember when you said you wanted
to have sex with me in a weird place?

31
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,719
How about Detroit?

32
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,879
Too kinky. Anyway, they"re installing
my big screen on Sunday...

33
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,077
...and I have the Mile High Mall
presentation in Denver next week.

34
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,073
- What will I do by myself in Detroit?
- Buy a Chevy. Prove you"re American.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,911
I don"t love you, and I won"t miss you.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,752
Call me when you get there.

37
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,273
"Bye.

38
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,436
Mr. Sorenson and Mr. Diggs.

39
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,237
Go right in. Enjoy the party.

40
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,549
Thank you very much.
It will be taken care of.

41
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,993
It"s my pleasure.

42
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,999
What happened, Boss?

43
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,117
Did they go for it? They"re crazy not to.

44
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,319
What do these Colombians want?
It"s foolproof!

45
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,918
We got all the customs agents,
the border guards. Everything"s in place!

46
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,433
We"ve got a little problem.
A cloud over us.

47
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,795
The cartel"s made an offer of $50 million.

48
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,113
It will be on the table for 30 days
if we can make this little problem go away.

49
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,794
Jarmin. They know about Jarmin, right?

50
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,836
It"s time to finish it.

51
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,990
We"ve got to find him and take him out.

52
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,911
Easier said than done.

53
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,790
We"II do it ourselves this time.
Make sure it gets done right.

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,069
Lovely day.

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,390
But we have a little cloud to blow away.

56
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,240
Closing down, Billy Ray.

57
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,880
Nobody driving
in this bad weather tonight.

58
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,559
Why don"t you give up on that tank,
come on over to the house for dinner?

59
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,994
It"s no good you being alone so much.

60
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,477
Been in town three months,
you haven"t made one friend.

61
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,716
At least none that l"ve seen.

62
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,631
Why don"t you wash up,
come and meet the missus tonight?

63
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,589
Hear me?

64
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,916
l"m gonna turn down this radio.

65
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,075
You gone to sleep under there?

66
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,755
God! Help me, Marvin!

67
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,638
Help me! Pull me out!
Get me out of here!

68
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,156
- Hold on!
- Help me.

69
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,355
Get me out!

70
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,509
Goddamn it!

71
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,715
Get this off of me!

72
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,791
What am I gonna do with no legs?

73
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,199
Look at you!

74
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,471
Something wrong with your brain?

75
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,553
l"m sorry. I gotta do something
to break up the monotony around here.

76
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,868
You"re bored?

77
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,438
l"m bored as hell. Don"t take it personal.

78
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,078
l"m just a restless guy.
That"s the kind of guy I am.

79
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,799
That"s why I travel around so much.

80
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,670
I get it from my daddy. He"s a traveling
salesman. Sold hairbrushes in Kentucky.

81
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,838
Thought you said your dad raised hogs
in Tennessee.

82
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,515
He raised hogs and he sold hairbrushes.

83
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,636
You"II bullshit at the drop of a hat.

84
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,349
You can"t say you never pulled
anybody"s leg before.

85
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,511
l"II get it.

86
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,873
Thank you for that dinner invitation.

87
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,633
- May I help you, ma"am?
- Unleaded, please.

88
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,831
- Hey, is that WJB on the radio?
- I have no idea.

89
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,515
Yep, that"s what it is. That"s a "60s station.

90
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,750
I listen to that one all day.

91
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,559
You know what they say about the "60s,
don"t you?

92
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,108
If you can remember them,
you wasn"t there.

93
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,155
- Want me to check under the hood?
- No. It"s rented.

94
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,198
You come to Detroit
and you rent a Beemer?

95
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,398
That"s like going to Germany
and eating Jimmy Dean sausages.

96
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,111
In Tennessee, where I was born,
I never saw cars like this.

97
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,634
I was 22 before
I knew foreigners made cars.

98
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,233
Are you from Tennessee?

99
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,676
- Yes, ma"am, l"m a Southern boy.
- What"s your name?

100
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,954
Billy Ray.

101
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,999
Named after both the scoundrels my mama
thought might have been my daddy.

102
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,750
Is that cash or card, ma"am?

103
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,429
Rick?

104
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,078
Beg your pardon?

105
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,510
- Will MasterCard do?
- Just fine.

106
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,112
- You remind me of someone a lot.
- I do?

107
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,033
Yeah, a boy. A man.

108
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,711
Named Rick Jarmin.
His plane went down in Mexico.

109
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,038
Fifteen years ago.

110
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,591
- I never went to Mexico, but...
- You laugh like him.

111
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,672
- I didn"t mean to.
- You look like him.

112
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,513
I don"t know what to tell you.
Want to sign that?

113
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,632
You have a nice day.

114
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,512
- Billy Ray?
- Ma"am?

115
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,318
Do you have a tattoo?

116
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,113
Tattoo? No.

117
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,271
Your upper right arm. A dove.

118
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,438
I don"t have a tattoo.

119
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,515
l"m not leaving till you show me.

120
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,115
I hope nobody"s looking. There. Satisfied?

121
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,195
Right arm.

122
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,478
I got some shrapnel in Vietnam.
It"s down my side. Want to see it?

123
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,678
l"m sorry. My friend
would have never been in that war.

124
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,829
Meaning what?

125
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,476
He was very much against killing.

126
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,871
I'd like to help you, sir,
but Offiicer Baird is retired.

127
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,911
That"s not possible!
He wouldn"t retire without telling me.

128
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,468
He"s been handling my case
for the last 15 years.

129
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,473
Give me your current name and ID, and
l"II connect you with your new case officer.

130
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,632
With all due respect,
I don't know who the hell you are.

131
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,111
If I give you my name and number,
you"II know everything.

132
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,073
- Hold, please.
- No, hang on. Damn it! Hello?

133
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,428
Excuse me.

134
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,313
That call you've been waiting for?
He's on the line.

135
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,154
He won't give me his current name
or location. He wants Lou Baird.

136
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,270
Rick? How you doing?

137
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,399
This is Joe Weyburn. Remember me?
I set you up at that photo lab in Cleveland.

138
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,790
Was it 1978? No, 1979.

139
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,913
I don"t remember you.

140
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,360
You know us FBI guys all look alike.

141
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,159
You are one rolling stone, aren"t you?
Where are you now, Rick?

142
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,754
Where"s Lou? He would have told me
he was retiring.

143
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,037
- Why didn't he do that?
- To tell you the truth, he lost you.

144
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,712
- He lost me?
- Yeah.

145
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,110
That's why we put him out to pasture,
why I'm on the case.

146
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,431
Where is he? Where did he retire to?

147
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,916
Where did he retire to?

148
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,673
He once gave me a number.
His sister"s place in St. Louis.

149
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,150
He used to go there on vacations.
Is that where he is? Am I getting warm?

150
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,558
He"s out of the picture.

151
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,437
Are you in some kind of trouble?

152
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,355
Not at all. Where"s Sorenson?

153
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,238
Still safely in jail as far as I know.

154
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,398
Nothing to worry about.
He"s never getting out!

155
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,799
His partner?

156
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,632
- Diggs?
- Yeah.

157
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,671
Unless he"s made another pass at you...

158
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,275
...he"s probably got his drug money
living the good life in South America.

159
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,238
- We have no idea where he is.
- That"s a relief.

160
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,709
So what is it...

161
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,199
...relocation time?

162
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,271
I guess. Where can you put me?

163
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,233
Where are you now?
And what name are you using?

164
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,872
Come on, I'm just trying to do my job.

165
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,117
Bowers, Billy Ray.
I live above Marvin"s Motown Motors.

166
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,034
1840 Canoga Street, Detroit.
Did you get that? I'm not repeating it.

167
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,354
Somebody recognized me.
I want to get out before they come back.

168
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,475
Right.

169
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,589
Two days.

170
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,954
Two days?

171
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,831
Hang on and we"II have somebody
come in and get you.

172
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,831
Okay, l"II be hanging.

173
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,511
The drop in foreign sales...

174
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,831
...reflects both the negative effect
of the strengthening dollar...

175
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,515
...and an upsurge in competitive
production in Europe and Asia.

176
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,115
Add this to the recent surcharge
imposed by the EEC nations...

177
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,716
...it's clear that to preserve the profiit
our shareholders expect...

178
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,110
...we have to make cuts
to our production costs.

179
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,760
While it is true our rising costs...

180
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,356
...will be defrayed by the acquisition of
Coleman Shipping, we should be clear...

181
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,358
You"re freaking me out!

182
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,232
All those opposed?

183
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,473
If Miss Graves will respond?

184
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,309
- Miss Graves!
- Yes.

185
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,989
No.

186
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,709
You are abstaining from the final vote?

187
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,070
Yes. No, I am not.

188
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,349
I see.

189
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,835
She says to me, "'Marvin,
you"re not getting any younger.

190
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,110
"'Think about that young man working
for you, and offer him a partnership."'

191
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,795
- We don"t have no sons.
- You ain"t known me but three months.

192
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,270
How do you know you can trust me
to stick around or not steal from you?

193
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,032
I got my eyes on you.

194
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,190
The hand is quicker than the eye.

195
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,510
l"m going upstairs and get some sleep.

196
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,751
See you in the morning.
Think about that partnership.

197
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,118
- L"II see you in the morning.
- That mean it"s a deal?

198
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,472
I sure will think about it.

199
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,874
Good night.

200
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,353
Pumps are closed.

201
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,949
Pumps are closed.
She won"t be humming again till 6:30 a.m.

202
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,799
You Billy Ray Bowers?

203
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,156
Y"all from Weyburn"s office?

204
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,996
Y"all got an interesting accent.

205
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,829
Shit.

206
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,434
You always were an actor,
weren"t you, Rick?

207
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,879
- You pretended to be my friend.
- I never did.

208
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,554
- Then you turned on me.
- I never agreed to help you kill.

209
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,191
Still a do-gooder?
My friend, Mr. Diggs, is worried about that.

210
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,956
l"ve served my time, thanks to you,
but he"s still under indictment.

211
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,589
Seeing as you"re the only living witness
that can put him behind bars...

212
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,750
What"s he got on you? You still his flunky?

213
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,197
Are you some hero?
Hiding in a grease pit for 15 years?

214
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,716
I don"t think they"II put up
any monuments for you.

215
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,834
Any last words?

216
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,993
What"s going on?

217
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,992
Get out of here! Run for your damn life!

218
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,155
Watch out!

219
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,349
Help!

220
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,791
- Let me in!
- Rick, is that you?

221
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,598
Yeah, it"s me! Let me in!

222
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,829
- How do I know it"s you?
- It"s me, Muffy. Open the damn door!

223
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,195
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Me? What the hell are you doing here?

224
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,998
Being shot in the butt.

225
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,994
- She saw you.
- I saw her, too.

226
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,070
I appreciate this.
l"II have to borrow your phone if it"s okay.

227
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,355
Ice. I need plenty of ice.

228
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,671
l"II get the ice. You go to the room.
It"s the presidential suite.

229
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,752
- Okay if I use your phone?
- L"II be there in a minute.

230
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,155
- Miss Graves?
- Mr. Takawaki!

231
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,911
Do little party?

232
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,274
Yes. A party for girls.

233
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,789
Maybe next time?

234
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,279
Maybe.

235
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,518
I don"t care if they"ve left for the day.

236
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,512
l"ve got to get through to them.

237
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,272
313...

238
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,831
...555-7000.

239
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,275
Yes. The presidential suite.

240
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,239
Operator? God!

241
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,277
- Rick?
- What?

242
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,192
Are you all right?

243
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,030
l"ve been shot in the butt.
Can you believe it?

244
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,430
- Can I come in?
- L"m naked. Can you handle it?

245
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,956
I handled it for a lot of years.
I guess I can handle it now.

246
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,037
It"s my lower back and my butt.
I think the pellet passed through...

247
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,269
Vietnam?

248
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,352
Hell, no. I took the dove off with a sander.

249
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,468
I really am anxious to hear this story.

250
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,793
I need some bandages,
antibiotic and some antiseptic.

251
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,359
Get shot often?

252
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,715
Only twice before.

253
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,314
Could you please help me?
Could you look at my butt?

254
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,152
You leave me at the altar.

255
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,833
That was my state of mind at the time.

256
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,718
You went off with Jamie
to seek your fortune...

257
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,155
...and you were coming back to marry me.

258
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,153
Am I remembering this correctly?
If not, correct me.

259
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,512
You get lost in your plane.
Reported missing, presumed dead.

260
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,479
I attend your memorial service,
and cried the tears of a grieving widow.

261
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,677
I vow l"II never get over you.
In fact, I never do.

262
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,958
I still carry your damn pictures
in my wallet!

263
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,034
Until one day, I pull into a gas station...

264
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,074
...and you"re alive with people chasing you
and you ask me to look at your butt?

265
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,073
That"s kind of neat.
Rick"s alive and he"s shot in the butt.

266
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,358
Guess who"s alive and shot in the butt?
Rick! L"m looking at his butt now!

267
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,795
You lying...

268
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,438
...gutless...

269
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,795
...son of a...

270
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,717
...yellow snodbugger, toad, bellybutton...

271
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,759
I can"t think of enough awful things
to say about you, you bastard!

272
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,074
I guess that"s a no on examining my butt.

273
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,110
- L"II get it. It"s probably for me.
- You can"t answer my phone.

274
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,075
Hello?

275
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,352
Yes. Fine. Taking a shower.

276
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,480
l"m coming home tomorrow.

277
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,879
Okay. "Bye.

278
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,589
Same guy?

279
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,717
- What guy?
- Harper. Jeremy III.

280
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,075
Rich boy, redneck asshole.
The one you married.

281
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,674
- You remember him?
- You know I got married?

282
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,035
Yeah. Four months after I disappeared.

283
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,152
That"s pretty quick work
for a grieving widow.

284
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,793
Where were you?

285
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,678
- You could have waited to find out.
- I was Ionely.

286
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,639
You were Ionely
so you married the joke of the campus!

287
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,957
Jerry the Napalm King.
How could you do that?

288
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,237
We had it wrong.
His family made laundry detergent.

289
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,710
- Cornwall Chemicals?
- No. Kitchen cleanser.

290
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,795
Don"t kid yourself.
They were getting rich off the war.

291
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,190
The war? Was that it?
You were dodging the draft?

292
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,638
Or were you too gutless to tell me
you didn"t want to marry me?

293
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,799
Are you all right?

294
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,555
Yeah. I just feel a little woozy.

295
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,394
- I better call the doctor.
- No doctors.

296
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,272
Four Seasons Hotel.

297
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,874
Is this the front desk?
Is there a pharmacy?

298
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,269
Yes, certainly.

299
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,750
Please send up gauze pads,
tape and hydrogen peroxide.

300
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,149
- Right away, Miss Graves.
- Thank you.

301
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,670
All right. What"s going on?

302
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,674
Was that a holdup
or is someone chasing you?

303
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,119
Got any kids?

304
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,309
It"s just you"ve got that "'Mom"' tone.

305
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,829
l"m a lawyer. I have that lawyer tone.

306
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,199
I can help you.

307
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,273
Will you talk to me?

308
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,115
Tomorrow.

309
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,077
l"II talk to you tomorrow.

310
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,274
Good Lord.

311
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,670
Rick Jarmin"s alive.

312
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,759
- How"s it going?
- Any idea who did this?

313
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,594
Maybe. I got a phone tip from
an eyewitness, said there was shooting...

314
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,433
...and a blue Beemer racing away
with a man and woman in it.

315
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,751
- We"II see what happens.
- Sarge, better take a look at this.

316
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,034
See you later.

317
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,709
Here.

318
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,788
Thanks a lot.

319
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,472
I have a right to be rude.
I left a message for him.

320
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,198
I waited for it and...

321
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,316
He picked it up. What time was that?

322
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,949
I want to go above his head.

323
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,833
Try it by name. Try Bowers.

324
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,560
- Billy Ray Bowers.
- No one by that name on our list.

325
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,108
- No record of a Billy Ray Bowers?
- No, sir.

326
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,189
- Try Jean-Pierre Fouret.
- No, sir.

327
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,596
- Turnbull, Jodie.
- No.

328
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,429
- Carlson, Matthew.
- No, sir.

329
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,231
Try Jarmin, Richard.

330
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,153
Rick Jarmin.
See if anybody by that name exists.

331
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,995
l"m sorry, sir. Have a nice day.

332
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,277
Something"s gone wrong.

333
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,716
I don"t seem to exist anymore.

334
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,349
Expecting someone?

335
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,238
I have a standing order for breakfast
at 7:00 a.m.

336
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,596
- What time is it?
- 6:48.

337
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,275
You got a gun?
Of course you don"t have a gun.

338
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,828
- You got any kind of weapon?
- No. It"s my breakfast.

339
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,435
Marianne, get dressed.
Get dressed fast, please.

340
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,872
Yeah, we can make it.

341
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,872
What do you mean "'we"'?
l"m not going out there!

342
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,396
Four attempts have been made on my life.

343
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,789
If you open that door,
you could end up dead.

344
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,395
Listen to me. We are at the top
of a veritable fortress.

345
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,278
Yes! Presidents, oil sheiks stay here.

346
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,477
Friends of Lee lacocca stay here.
George Harrison stays here.

347
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,030
Yes! Because it has the best security
money can buy. Don"t be paranoid.

348
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,157
I hate to be an old woman,
but paranoid keeps me alive.

349
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,515
This guy comes every morning. Trust me.

350
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,717
- Got your breakfast, Miss Graves.
- What did you order?

351
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,519
- What did you order?
- I ordered...

352
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,477
...grapefruit, croissant...

353
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,389
And what?

354
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,029
Prunes.

355
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,638
Ask him what he"s got.

356
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,396
- Go on, ask him. Bet he can"t tell you.
- What"s for breakfast?

357
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,559
Some kind of breads and fruits.

358
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,273
l"II be right there.
Rick, pull up a chair, sit down.

359
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,955
l"II share my prunes
and then you can tell me all about this.

360
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,389
Don"t take the chain off the door.

361
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,836
Rattle it like you"II take it off.
Make him think you"II take it off.

362
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,037
You mean like this? Is that good?

363
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,951
Yeah. It"s funny to you.

364
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,399
Oh, God!

365
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,520
- Get the mace!
- You get it!

366
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,037
The mace! The mace!

367
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,149
Hurry up!

368
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,352
- Come on! Upstairs!
- Wait a minute! Get my purse.

369
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,630
- Hurry up!
- I can"t do this, Rick.

370
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,157
What are you talking about?
This is what Lee lacocca does.

371
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,591
l"m very scared, Rick.

372
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,554
Since when did you start
wearing underpants?

373
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,110
Do I get to know what"s going on
or do I get killed for old time"s sake?

374
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,428
Follow me.

375
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,834
- L"ve got to know what"s going on.
- So do I.

376
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,393
l"m supposedly being protected
by the federal government...

377
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,550
...but I think they"re trying to do me in.

378
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,518
- Who are those men?
- Ex drug-enforcement agents.

379
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,718
I sent one to jail and could send the other.
They want me and whoever"s with me.

380
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,712
- Why?
- I testified against them. That"s why.

381
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,030
- About what?
- It"s a long story.

382
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,597
This is not a good time to talk about this.

383
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,514
Help!

384
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,354
My God!

385
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,069
Is that the VIP entrance?

386
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,435
Good morning. How are we doing today?

387
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,713
l"m so hungry!
We got to get out of this room.

388
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,349
- It"s too dangerous to go to the room.
- L"ve gotta change my clothes.

389
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,670
No! We"II buy some, okay?

390
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,990
If this isn"t a dream, l"m in deep shit.

391
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,633
- You owe me an explanation.
- Get me out, l"II tell you everything.

392
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,391
No. Don"t tell me.

393
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,913
No keys.

394
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,989
Gotcha!

395
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,196
- I ought to weenie-whip you!
- Get that weenie out of my face!

396
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,474
Let"s get outta here.

397
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,035
- How you doing over there?
- Great.

398
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,239
Tell me the story.

399
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,997
Remember when Jamie and I
got everybody to chip in...

400
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,790
...so we could go south
and score some real Acapulco gold?

401
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,316
I remember you borrowed his father"s
plane so you could fly to Mexicali.

402
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,231
That"s the last I ever heard from you.

403
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,118
It seemed simple.
Fly south, pick up a couple of keys.

404
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,760
But no, we were really impressed
with ourselves.

405
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,195
We started drinking,
shooting off at the mouth...

406
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,829
...and before we knew it there was this guy
called Sorenson involved.

407
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,799
- Things just got a whole lot bigger.
- What a dumb-ass thing to do.

408
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,757
- You always did love being a big shot.
- You don"t understand.

409
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,550
I understand. You were being
a couple of jerks like always.

410
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,598
Anything for a kick.
Anything to thumb your nose at authority.

411
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,908
Your gold card.

412
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,197
Where do you get off with that attitude?
"'Rick Jarmin, asshole."'

413
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,669
- Whatever happened to you?
- I got smart.

414
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,554
Is that what you call being corrupted?
"'Smart?"'

415
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,831
- You know nothing about me.
- I got your number, baby.

416
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,872
We got a blue Beemer.

417
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,999
You"re totally unchanged. L"ve never met
anybody more holier-than-thou.

418
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,914
Tell me something honestly.
Do you ever donate anything to the poor?

419
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,072
Or do you and Jerry the Napalm King
hoard your millions?

420
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,230
- Laundry detergent!
- Yeah, we had it wrong.

421
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,073
Yes. We"re very rich
and we hoard our millions.

422
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,958
Occasionally we invite a poor person in
for Thanksgiving.

423
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,033
Feed him nothing. We eat turkey
in front of him and watch him starve.

424
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,674
- Can I drop you somewhere?
- Yeah. Wisconsin.

425
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,672
- Wisconsin?
- Yeah. Racine, Wisconsin.

426
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,719
l"ve got to find Lou Baird. He"s the one
I can trust to get me back into hiding.

427
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,839
- What"s he doing in Wisconsin?
- He"s not. He"s in St. Louis.

428
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,629
l"m with Rick Jarmin again.
The hand is quicker than the eye.

429
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,358
My address book is in Wisconsin.

430
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,079
His sister is there,
and I think that"s where he retired.

431
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,674
I don"t think you"re
in any witness-relocation program.

432
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,320
You"re some two-bit criminal
being chased by the police.

433
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,438
- You don"t mean that.
- Or you can"t pay your gambling debts.

434
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,672
- You dressed it up with this FBI crap.
- Wisconsin is only six hours away.

435
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,355
- I have a life.
- But are you happy?

436
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,989
- L"m expected home.
- Hands on the dashboard. Don"t move.

437
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,431
- Get that gun out of my face.
- You have the right to an attorney.

438
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,397
I am an attorney, damn it!

439
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,869
- Are you Billy Ray Bowers?
- What"s he charged with?

440
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,599
You"re both charged
with the killing of Marvin Marsent.

441
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,716
You were identified
at the scene of the crime.

442
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,597
Rick, tell them.

443
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,560
- What?
- About the witness relocation program.

444
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,316
- You"II have time to tell us in jail.
- Put both hands behind your head.

445
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,639
Drive!

446
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,994
Get in the car!

447
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,556
Shut up and steer the damn thing!

448
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,399
- Did you kill the guy?
- No, I loved him. They killed him.

449
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,311
Then you can plead innocent!

450
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,154
I never will. They"II kill me before
I get a chance. The same goes for you.

451
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,759
Get your foot off!

452
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,238
Shit! Oh, God!

453
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,431
You"re gonna break my legs!

454
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,479
Stop squealing!

455
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,549
Watch where you"re going.
Go north as soon as you can.

456
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,876
Get your face off my gas!

457
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,669
Shit!

458
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,157
This can"t be good for you.

459
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,956
- What are you doing?
- L"m taking your place. Move over.

460
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,352
This is a rented car.
We can get in trouble if you drive it.

461
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,557
- You"re worried about Hertz? Move!
- Give me my wheel!

462
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,712
You"II get us both killed.

463
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,634
Move over!

464
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,549
Jesus!

465
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,836
- I think we lost them.
- Where are we?

466
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,114
They"re not there anymore.

467
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,158
- We"re in the railway tunnel.
- Where the hell are we?

468
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,789
Shit!

469
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,676
Back up!

470
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,439
I don"t know. Stuck.

471
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,709
Goddamn!

472
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,560
What are you doing?
You almost got us killed!

473
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,393
I did you a favor.

474
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,116
Are you having fun or something?

475
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,390
I can"t believe when you pulled...

476
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,516
You were great back there.

477
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,438
I was so scared!

478
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,512
You"II love it in Racine.
It"s a happening town.

479
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,549
The car was rented by Marianne Graves,
a lawyer from New York.

480
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,957
How she got involved, I don"t know,
but I don"t like it.

481
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,439
Call it kidnapping.

482
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,512
He"II kill her the same way
he killed his boss at the gas station.

483
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,194
I don't like all this killing.
Erasing a witness...

484
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,033
You"re not trying to back out on us,
are you?

485
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,833
Not a good idea, Joe.

486
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,799
Please don"t smoke.

487
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,438
We would hate to inform authorities
that 20 years ago you were responsible...

488
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,308
...for selling confiscated narcotics out
of the back door of the police warehouse.

489
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,188
Yeah, Joe. Especially now
that you"ve got yourself such a big career.

490
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,230
Relax.

491
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,472
l"m doing everything I can. L"ve used
the kidnapping to bring the FBI in.

492
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,916
We"re plugged into the woman"s
phone lines, credit cards, bank account.

493
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,070
Auto club. They're bound to surface.

494
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,472
When they do, Jarmin will either be shot
or wind up in prison. Then he"s yours.

495
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,676
We"re looking forward to that, Joe.

496
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,189
What a pro.

497
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,876
Hundreds! That"s all you carry.

498
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,998
Where are we now?

499
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,468
Shortcut.

500
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,193
What"s the matter?

501
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,595
Nothing.

502
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,994
I never told you, Jamie"s dead.

503
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,069
God!

504
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,755
He was killed by Sorenson and Diggs.

505
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,999
They were two drug enforcement agents,
corrupt ones.

506
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,872
They busted Jamie and me
for the nickel bags we bought...

507
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,919
...and told us we'd rot injail
if we didn't do exactly what they said.

508
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,672
One minute we were kids...

509
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,036
...and the next we were trapped
in the middle of a major drug deal.

510
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,792
They needed our plane.

511
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,034
They made us fly under the radar
to an unmarked airstrip on the US side...

512
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,554
...and that's where all hell broke loose.

513
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,952
Diggs and Sorenson must've been
under government surveillance...

514
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,350
...'cause there were a lot of cops
waiting for us when we landed.

515
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,070
Sorenson came out shooting.
He killed one of the border patrol guys.

516
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,991
He wounded another one.

517
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,477
Diggs, however, got away.

518
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,354
Me and Jamie fiigured
we could bring Sorenson down...

519
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,795
...before he killed anybody else.

520
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,395
We were wrong.
Jamie got it point blank in the chest.

521
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,790
I spent three months in a Mexicali jail...

522
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,519
...before the FBI
fiinally offered me immunity...

523
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,752
...for testifying against
Diggs and Sorenson.

524
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,030
That"s when I joined
the Witness Relocation Program.

525
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,230
It"s been fun ever since.

526
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,918
Why didn"t you call me?

527
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,349
I didn"t want to get you involved.

528
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,028
You were about to march up
to the altar anyway, so I let it lie.

529
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,276
This is it?

530
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,318
I think this is it. It"s all changed around.

531
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,916
Yeah, this is it.
It better be here or l"m in deep shit.

532
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,070
l"m going to look for a bathroom.

533
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,630
Have any change
so I can get to the VA hospital?

534
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,989
Hold up.

535
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,400
- Be right with you, pal.
- What do you need?

536
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,710
- What"ve you got?
- What are you doing?

537
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,712
That"s all you"ve got.

538
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,358
Here, brother.

539
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,034
- Have three squares on me.
- This all you"ve got?

540
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,998
- How dare you do a thing like that!
- The guy"s hungry.

541
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,753
That"s for me to decide! That"s my money!

542
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,549
- You"ve got plenty. What"s the problem?
- I worked hard for it, damn it!

543
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,030
You couldn"t carry something smaller?
Why do you carry hundreds? Status?

544
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,951
No! Emergency.

545
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,600
- This was an emergency.
- But it wasn"t my emergency.

546
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:52,150
It"s that attitude that keeps half the people
in this world starving.

547
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,231
I don"t see you feeding the poor!

548
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,878
What did you just see?

549
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,996
You"re such a jackass!

550
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,229
Am I?

551
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,272
Mattie?

552
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,238
Mattie Carlson? My God!

553
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,635
- Mattie?
- L"ve got to talk to you.

554
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,950
When I left my job here,
I owed this guy a lot of money.

555
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,075
Hi.

556
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,830
You won"t believe who"s here!
It"s Mad Mattie Carlson!

557
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,313
- Can you wait in the car? Could get ugly.
- Don"t tell me.

558
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,549
I must talk to you.

559
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,312
You were a hairdresser?

560
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,238
You don"t get a lot of choice
in the relocation game.

561
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,595
I can"t believe it!

562
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,672
Raun is gonna shit! He"s gonna die!
I can"t believe it!

563
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,229
Can"t say hi to an old friend?
Cat got your tongue?

564
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,353
Say something!

565
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,709
Hi, Scotty.

566
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,994
Hiya, babe.

567
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,232
I can"t believe you came back!

568
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,878
- How are you?
- Great.

569
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,709
I like the...

570
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,633
That? It"s just dirty. I had to tie it up.

571
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,438
- Gorgeous.
- Who"s this?

572
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,953
This is my sister.

573
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,871
Hi. Come on. Let"s go see Raun.

574
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,349
- He"s dying to see you!
- L"II bet he is.

575
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,319
Your brother is a genius! Michelangelo
of hair. L"m not exaggerating!

576
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,391
We lost half our clientele when he left.

577
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,199
He left on his lunch break.
Can you believe it?

578
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,111
Bread and butter!

579
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,750
- Silly girl.
- He always does my hair.

580
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,316
Are you coming back?
You"II have to pay Raun what you owe him.

581
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,470
- Raun, look who"s back.
- Hi, Raun.

582
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,119
Hello, Matthew.

583
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,795
l"II bet you"re surprised to see me.

584
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,833
You"ve lost weight. Your hair!
You look 10 years younger!

585
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,275
Cut the crap. You"ve been a bad boy.

586
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,351
I know. Mea culpa.

587
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,112
And sic semper tyrannis.

588
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,158
You"re so right. But l"ve come
to pay you back what I owe you.

589
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,356
Will wonders never cease?

590
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,992
- You still have my things, my address...
- Show me cash, l"II show you the book.

591
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,352
Could you hang on a minute?

592
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,276
- This is funny to you?
- Yes.

593
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,873
I need $2,000 cash.

594
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,997
Isn"t it nice one of us
became a materialistic being?

595
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,238
- Can you help me, please?
- What"s in it for me?

596
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,311
If I get the book, I can get to Lou Baird
and pay you back quicker.

597
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,914
If I don"t get the book,
you might be stuck with me.

598
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,274
How"s that?

599
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,431
Who do I make the check out to?

600
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,876
l"m supposed to believe
your check is good? I want cash!

601
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,030
- The bank"s over there.
- L"II get the book?

602
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,398
We"II discuss it when I see cash.
And then l"II want an apology.

603
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,755
Then you can do my hair.

604
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,389
- Why mess with pertection?
- Rick, it"s only fair!

605
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,631
- Who is this?
- His sister.

606
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,396
- She called him Rick.
- I called him sick.

607
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,118
He is sick!

608
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,636
Cash. Apology. Hair.

609
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,075
In that order. L"II be waiting.

610
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,357
Driver"s license and three IDs.

611
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,396
Credit cards do?

612
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,756
Break.

613
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,829
Where"d he go?

614
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,150
- Stall them.
- L"m not stalling them.

615
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,636
Sir?

616
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,518
- What"s going on? Can you step on it?
- Certainly.

617
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,590
Right.

618
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,591
Take what you want.

619
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,433
- What are you doing?
- L"m going as fast as I can.

620
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,230
- Here.
- You"ve got the wrong idea.

621
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,669
Freeze!

622
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,349
Don"t move!

623
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,873
Put your arms up.

624
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,039
Down on the floor!

625
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,993
- My credit cards!
- Forget about the credit cards!

626
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,509
Just let me get my gold card.
Please? Just let me...

627
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,272
Stay down or the girl gets it!

628
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,833
- My purse!
- Come here!

629
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,273
- What"s going on?
- Step across the street, please.

630
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,713
Sure.

631
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,958
l"m not going with you!

632
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,155
You"ve got no choice. They"re after you,
too, and it"s not just the cops.

633
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,357
What am I supposed to do?
Spend my life running like you?

634
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,078
Well, it"s up to you.

635
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,638
We"re dead if they catch us.
Now hop aboard or say good-bye.

636
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,869
Come on.

637
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,399
So long, tough guy.

638
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,789
So long.

639
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,153
What are you doing?

640
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,677
This is the car. Lieberman?

641
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,519
Cover the rear. Take McCurrin with you.

642
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,633
Check out everything.

643
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,233
Yes, sir, I got it.

644
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,515
- Cover all the stores.
- Right.

645
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,315
- Get this towed out of here.
- Yes, sir.

646
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,919
Cover all the stores.

647
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,272
What the hell am I doing?

648
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,995
Hop on!

649
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,589
- What are you doing here?
- I missed you.

650
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,036
- You okay?
- Why are we going back?

651
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,519
I forgot something.

652
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,519
Raun wants to play!

653
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,311
- What is this? Butch on wheels?
- Here"s your cash. Give me the book.

654
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,436
It"s more than you need.
Give me the book!

655
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,748
Take me with you!

656
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,593
- This town needs you.
- Cut the crap. Let"s get out of here.

657
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,399
That ought to be enough
to cover the damages.

658
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,833
What damages?

659
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:49,950
Shit.

660
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,396
Hang on.

661
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,555
Look out!

662
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,239
I have the suspect in sight
and I am in pursuit.

663
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,675
Hang on.

664
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,353
Get out of the way!

665
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,550
I'm following suspect. I am in pursuit.

666
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,714
Watch out!

667
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,229
I almost have them. I am in pursuit.

668
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,549
What are you doing
with your face in my sidewalk?

669
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,312
I am no longer in pursuit.

670
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,633
- Can you step on it? I'm in a hurry.
- I'm going as quickly as I can!

671
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,156
Everybody freeze! Nobody move!
Don't move. Put your hands up.

672
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,999
On the floor now!

673
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,990
Looks like she"s there of her own free will.
Look at this part.

674
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,593
Will you come here?

675
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,517
She tried to go back for the money
when her boyfriend wanted out.

676
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,275
He"s not her boyfriend. Can we
get that straight? I am her boyfriend.

677
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:39,150
She"s not a kidnap victim, so the FBI
is out of it. It"s up to local authorities.

678
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,959
Hi, Joe. This is Paul Bernhardt.
Joe Weyburn. He works here.

679
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,230
Any theories as to how to head them off?

680
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,509
He obviously used to work at this mall.

681
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,436
Maybe going back to a place
of employment is a pattern.

682
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,913
Without a record of previous employment,
we can only wait and see.

683
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,594
Keep on it.

684
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,199
Mr. Bernhardt.

685
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,554
"'Matthew Carlson, Raun"s of Racine."'

686
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,835
"'Jodie Turnbull, Muncie Farms."'

687
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,349
Yeah!

688
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,313
Tell him Rick Jarmin
needs to speak to him.

689
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,470
I need to. It"s urgent, okay?

690
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,597
Jarmin. J-A-R-M-l-N.

691
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,152
Not till when?

692
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,154
6:00 p.m.? On the dot, ma"am.

693
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,033
Okay, thanks for...

694
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,390
Yeah. He"II remember me.

695
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,348
Believe me, he"II remember me.
Thanks again.

696
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,635
"Bye, ma"am.

697
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,035
Hallelujah!

698
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,518
He"s there. Not till 6:00, but he"s there.

699
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,989
He had to go to the doctor. Demon out!

700
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,548
He"s got a job in the zoo.
He got me a job there once.

701
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,956
Did I tell you about
when I worked at the zoo...

702
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,555
I don"t wish to hear about the zoo.
I wish to get out of these bushes.

703
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:22,031
l"m wearing cashmere in 100 heat.
I don"t feel like waiting till 6:00.

704
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,917
- Well...
- Yeah?

705
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,355
I know someplace we can go.
It"s on the way.

706
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,874
If you don"t mind riding for a couple hours.

707
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,791
- Think you can do that?
- Yeah.

708
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,232
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

709
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,118
Either say it or don"t say it, all right?

710
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,988
Rise and shine.

711
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,710
- I need a night"s sleep.
- Ace!

712
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,115
Come here.

713
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,396
You son of a bitch. You"re still alive.

714
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,711
Hopefully she"II get better
when she"s had the operation.

715
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,949
Jodie?

716
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,358
Rach. How are ya?

717
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,796
- I never thought l"d see you again.
- I guess you"re surprised to see me.

718
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,348
- You look great.
- Talk about dropping out of the blue.

719
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,749
This guy built half this place
and disappeared.

720
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,990
l"m sorry, this is Marianne Graves.

721
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,548
- This is Dr. Rachel Varney.
- Hello.

722
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,876
- You used to work here?
- Yeah.

723
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,757
I was a carpenter and a general...

724
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,798
Pilot, designer, everything.
And then just one day, gone.

725
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,394
l"m sorry about that.
I had to leave in a hurry.

726
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,516
A man was looking for you after you left.

727
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,433
He"s still looking for me.

728
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,478
- What happened?
- Shot me in the butt.

729
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,400
Quite a game of tag you two play.
Let me see.

730
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,948
It"s just a little buckshot.
It went straight through.

731
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,032
Not if it"s bleeding. Let me take a look.
Take your pants down.

732
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,439
Not out here.

733
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,834
What are you, shy? L"ve seen it before.

734
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,231
l"m sorry. Are you his wife?

735
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,351
Are you kidding? No way.

736
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,796
You two just go ahead and whatever.
l"II call a cab.

737
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,314
That"s not a good idea.
She"s insane with fatigue.

738
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,391
She needs something to eat,
a bed and a bath.

739
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,833
l"m sorry.

740
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,037
You can use the guest house
to wash up and sleep.

741
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,680
- Jodie, can you stay the night?
- I don"t know.

742
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,713
Go ahead, Rick. Be a sport.

743
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,792
- She always calls me Rick.
- I won"t get in your way.

744
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,519
- It"s not like that, really.
- Yes, it is.

745
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,108
- It was.
- It was.

746
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,670
He picked me up, put me back on my feet.
Showed me how to do everything.

747
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,593
- I bet he did.
- You should see the barn.

748
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,433
It all worked.
Every single idea you had worked.

749
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,478
- The big animal practice is back there.
- Takes one to know one.

750
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,632
- The horse sling"s wondertul. Want to see?
- Yeah. Let"s go.

751
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,598
- You never saw anything work.
- I never knew it would.

752
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,477
- It did.
- Marianne, come on.

753
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,758
l"m sure she doesn"t want to bother.
She"s exhausted.

754
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,630
l"d like to see that horse sling.

755
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,876
"'Heigh-ho, Silver!"' Look at that.

756
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,396
Isn"t that wild? They thought it was nuts
when I showed them the plans.

757
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,596
I thought it was nuts when I did them.

758
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,113
Come see this.

759
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,070
- It works great.
- It works.

760
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,991
- Nice job.
- L"m a genius.

761
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,277
We"II let the inventor use his table.
Drop "em and hop up.

762
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,999
- Do you need her to leave?
- L"II stay.

763
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,152
l"ve seen it before, too.

764
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,397
Great. You can assist.

765
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,677
Get the peroxide and sponges
from the cabinets over there.

766
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,597
Come on. Take your pants off
and get on the table.

767
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,710
- Come on. Don"t be a baby.
- Be gentle with me, okay?

768
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,798
l"II think about it.

769
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,508
l"II be gentle.

770
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,109
That"s cold.

771
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,475
The cows never seem to mind.

772
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,114
- Roll over.
- Roll over.

773
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,633
Do I get a Milkbone?

774
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,351
What did you have in mind?

775
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,271
Let"s take a look.

776
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,231
- How is it?
- Not bad, but it"s not great. Clean it up.

777
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,511
- What"s that?
- I don"t know.

778
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,228
Sulfuric acid.

779
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,953
What are you doin"?

780
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,079
I hate those things.

781
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,756
- You okay?
- Fine.

782
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,193
- Feel that?
- Feel what?

783
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,878
- There it is.
- What?

784
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,669
Sponge.

785
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,512
- I think you need a little fresh air.
- No, l"m fine.

786
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,312
l"II send your cowboy right out.

787
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,709
Maybe just a whiff will help me.

788
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,719
She"s tired,
and she needs something to eat, too.

789
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,711
So, who is she?

790
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,470
- She"s just an old friend.
- Yeah, right.

791
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,790
- Really. An old friend.
- Are you sure about that?

792
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,910
When you got a knife up my ass, I am.

793
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,912
How bad is it,
this "'thing"' you"re running from?

794
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,149
Pretty bad.

795
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,837
Think you"d ever beat it
and want to come back here someday?

796
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,751
If I could beat it, l"d go anywhere.

797
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,479
l"m asking because
l"m engaged to be married.

798
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,994
"'Flagellations."' That"s great.

799
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,230
l"d rethink it...

800
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,552
...if I thought you might
come back this way someday.

801
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,079
You always were direct, Rachel.

802
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,352
- You"re done.
- Thanks.

803
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,599
How long have I got?

804
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,878
The wedding"s on Sunday.

805
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,590
l"m a bad bet, you know.

806
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,839
Much happiness. Come here.

807
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,597
Excuse me for a minute.

808
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,918
You never hustled like that
when I was angry.

809
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,634
Are you okay?

810
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,676
- Forget it.
- Forget what?

811
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,230
I need a phone to get out of here
so you two can live happily ever after.

812
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,356
It"s not like that. She was...

813
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,556
In your arms and you were naked. I saw it.

814
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,029
- It"s nothing.
- And my name is Dumbo. Who cares?

815
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,031
What"s it to you? Why should you care?

816
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,429
- You"re happily married, yeah?
- L"m not.

817
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,996
- You"re not happy?
- Not married.

818
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,911
- No?
- It just didn"t work out.

819
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,794
He was a prick.
You"re better off without him.

820
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,716
My heart can"t take this again.

821
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,350
Remember the time I saw
that flying saucer?

822
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,318
We were smoking
some pretty heavy stuff back then.

823
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,272
I think I see another one.

824
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,434
What"s that?

825
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,839
Friends of yours?

826
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,631
- Go! L"II stay here.
- Right.

827
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,992
Let"s get out of here!

828
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,355
- "Bye, Rach. Thanks a lot.
- L"II cover you.

829
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,069
Let"s fly.

830
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,879
l"m gonna kill you!

831
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,480
- Hurry up, Rick!
- Ready for this?

832
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,318
Tie down your toupee.

833
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:57,069
- Can"t this thing go any faster?
- This is as fast as it goes!

834
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:06,789
Hang on!

835
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,596
Oh, my God!

836
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,559
l"m gonna throw up!

837
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,070
l"m not kidding!

838
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:08,629
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- I gotta take his rotor out.

839
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,878
- What the hell?
- What"s he doing?

840
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,235
Slow down! He"s cutting up the rotor!

841
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,474
We"re goin" down!

842
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,196
If you"ve got a belt, put it on.

843
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,919
And stick your head between your knees.

844
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,833
- What do I do now?
- Kiss your ass good-bye.

845
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,275
We got no wheels and we"re comin" down.

846
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,713
I don"t want to die!

847
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,112
Are we dead?

848
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,749
No.

849
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:19,194
But we will be if we don"t get out of here.
This can"t be good for you.

850
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,508
Help me.

851
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,315
Hang on.

852
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,193
Let"s go. This thing still might blow up.

853
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,675
It"s been five years.
I haven"t lost my touch.

854
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,069
It"s like riding a bicycle.
You never forget it.

855
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,871
I can"t take this anymore.

856
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,709
l"m gonna go on the road and hitchhike.

857
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,909
I don"t care if they catch us and we die.

858
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,992
I need food. I need a bath.

859
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,399
I need a bed.

860
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,113
I need a massage.

861
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,919
I need a manicure.
I need to see my therapist.

862
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,992
I need a beer. Look at that.

863
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,752
It"s the promised land.

864
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,470
We have no money and no credit cards.

865
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,796
l"II talk to the guy in charge.

866
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,511
Give him this.

867
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,955
- Give him my watch.
- Hold me down.

868
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,075
If they don"t take that, sell my body.

869
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,871
I don"t care.

870
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,680
l"II try and get there
early afternoon tomorrow.

871
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,079
Thank you. "Bye.

872
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,314
Right here. Hallway.
See you in the morning.

873
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,038
Tomorrow at 7:30, before you know it.

874
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,997
- Thanks, Norman.
- Good night.

875
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,708
Hiya, pooch.

876
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,431
- Marianne, are you in this one?
- There"s no lock and no door handle.

877
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,511
Watch the door. It falls of the hinges.

878
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,990
Why didn"t you choose another one?
The guy said, "'Take your pick."'

879
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,390
- The only one with a TV.
- So there is. Civilization.

880
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,311
I wonder if we"re on the news.

881
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,469
Shit!

882
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,396
There was nothing good on anyway.

883
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,675
l"ve just taken a shower.

884
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,237
l"m wearing a towel.

885
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,358
l"m hanging up my clothes.

886
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,831
This is interesting narration.

887
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,910
l"d appreciate your not watching me.

888
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,911
There"s nothing else to watch.

889
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,399
Speaking of watches, l"ve still got yours.

890
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,518
I didn"t give it to the guy.
We"II need it tomorrow anyway.

891
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,830
We"II have to get a car or something.

892
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,319
Lou Baird said he wants to see me
in person.

893
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,870
I was talking to his sister.
I tried to tell her the problem.

894
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,392
But she said it wasn"t a good idea
to discuss it on the phone.

895
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,311
- Why?
- I don"t know.

896
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,034
- Was the phone tapped or something?
- God.

897
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,315
I knew you"d say that. I hope not.

898
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,795
Don"t go there. Call the police.

899
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,432
You know I can"t do that.

900
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,637
Why are you so paranoid about the police?
They can help you.

901
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,678
l"m half a day"s drive away
from Lou Baird"s. L"m not going...

902
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,830
How do you know
he"s not part of the setup?

903
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,319
Because he isn"t.

904
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,597
He"s saved my hide too many times
to want to kill me now.

905
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,799
Tomorrow morning,
we"II find the nearest town...

906
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:13,873
...swap your watch for some old junker,
and everything will be just fine.

907
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,952
I know what l"m doing.
Have you got a towel?

908
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,992
That"s not a towel.

909
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,755
- Who"s gonna pay for this hotel room?
- They need a chambermaid.

910
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,309
- A chambermaid?
- L"II help you.

911
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,039
It"s only 12 units.
It won"t take us very long.

912
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,120
- Are you mumbling? What are you doing?
- Good luck.

913
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,112
- L"m out of here in the morning.
- I gave this guy my word.

914
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,919
I didn"t, all right?
l"II call my office in the morning...

915
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,468
...have them express mail some money,
pay the guy off.

916
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,030
l"II buy this goddamn place,
if necessary, and l"m out of here.

917
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,510
- Calm down. What"s eating you?
- Calm down?

918
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,388
I just took a shower with a cockroach
from hell. He"s doing his hair now.

919
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,472
Not to mention that you"ve sold me
into human bondage.

920
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,230
- You really are spoiled.
- Yes, I am.

921
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,039
Then being a chambermaid
might do you some good.

922
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,394
God!

923
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,153
- Stop that shit.
- What shit?

924
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,037
That mumbling
has always driven me crazy.

925
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:12,351
Did you ever wonder why we got together
in the first place?

926
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,388
Do we ever agree on anything?
Did your personality ever not annoy me?

927
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,233
- Sex.
- Sex.

928
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,550
- I really don"t remember.
- You really don"t?

929
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,119
I don"t think you do either.

930
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,351
I think this is a cheap trick
"cause l"m getting into bed with you.

931
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,591
- I wouldn"t worry about me.
- Anyway, I have a boyfriend.

932
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,517
A very wondertul boyfriend.

933
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,154
- Who"s this boyfriend?
- How"d I know you"d ask me that?

934
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,356
- Why shouldn"t I?
- You"II just belittle him.

935
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,192
- I would not.
- You will. I know you.

936
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,633
Have it your way.

937
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,831
- Please stay above the covers.
- Why?

938
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,388
My towel is wet. I have to get out of it.

939
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,229
I guess so.

940
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,912
That"s better.

941
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,988
Thank you.

942
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:06,312
Tell me about this boyfriend.
What"s he like in the sack?

943
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,038
Can he thrill the lake?

944
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,475
l"m not discussing sex with you tonight.

945
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,714
I haven"t had a girlfriend in five years.

946
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,193
- Really?
- Yeah.

947
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,791
Mr. Wiggly"s been on bread and water
for five long years.

948
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,911
- Is that the truth?
- Yeah.

949
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,270
I didn"t think it would be fair.

950
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,194
You cold?

951
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,429
Not really.

952
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,591
Feels familiar, doesn"t it?

953
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,595
Thought you said you didn"t remember.

954
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,915
I feel kind of selfish under here.

955
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,198
You are very selfish,
and not just under there.

956
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,711
- Too bad you said that.
- Why?

957
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,349
I was actually beginning to get turned on.

958
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,874
- Too bad for you. I wasn"t.
- You weren"t?

959
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,109
- No.
- Fine.

960
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,115
Stop that, will you? If you do that again...

961
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,829
You can"t tell me what to do, okay?
I can"t help it.

962
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,634
What are you gonna do,
add another felony to your list of crimes?

963
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,789
Go to sleep.

964
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:42,515
I can"t. What"s the name of this boyfriend?
Tell me. L"II be nice.

965
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,672
You will? Okay. His name is Paul.

966
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,711
Sounds like a dipshit. Anyone named Paul
is probably a spot welder.

967
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,317
Shut up. Go to sleep.

968
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,912
- Is that true?
- What?

969
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,874
About five years?

970
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,320
- Thought you didn"t want to discuss it.
- I don"t.

971
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,072
- Then shut up.
- Shut up?

972
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,718
Yeah, l"II shut up.

973
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,595
God.

974
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,912
Let me look at you.

975
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,119
I missed you.

976
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,196
God, I missed you.

977
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,668
Doesn"t this feel right?

978
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,432
I had that dream again.

979
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,239
Remember the dream I used to have
after we made love?

980
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,356
The one about the Seven Dwarts?

981
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,153
Remember the dream,
we were in the middle of the ocean...

982
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,549
...and it was that really big sailboat?

983
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,153
- Yeah.
- We were alone.

984
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,075
There was nobody around. It was just us.

985
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,391
- That"s a nice dream.
- Can"t we do that?

986
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,437
Can"t we find a way?

987
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,829
l"ve spent 15 years looking for it.

988
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,237
If I could"ve found it,
l"d have come and got you, married or not.

989
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,958
- Would you really?
- Yeah.

990
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,396
But there"s nothing we can do now.

991
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,632
We gotta get out of here.

992
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:17,315
l"m gonna see what kind of car
I can get with that watch of yours.

993
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,917
There must be a way.

994
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,551
Yeah?

995
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,234
Paul? Marianne. No, l"m fine.

996
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,514
l"m really all right.

997
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,392
I can"t talk. L"m fine.
I just need you to help us.

998
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,914
I need you to call someone. Please.

999
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,479
Yes, damn it!

1000
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,678
- I don"t have enough time.
- Marianne, your chariot awaits you.

1001
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,115
- Just do it! I gotta go.
- Where are you hiding?

1002
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,760
Better pick it up, hot legs. We gotta go.

1003
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,717
- Hi.
- You found me.

1004
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,791
Wait till you see what I got for you.

1005
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,348
- Bring it on out here.
- There"s your watch.

1006
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,237
- What a beauty.
- You think so?

1007
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,153
Fine piece of equipment.
Look at this little jewel here.

1008
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,516
I had to grind him down,
but he finally accepted my terms.

1009
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,592
Hello. Extension 2200, please.

1010
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,315
Hello?

1011
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,273
Yes, Mr. Bernhardt.
Of course I remember you.

1012
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,278
They"re headed where?

1013
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,799
She wants federal marshals
and some members of the press there.

1014
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,429
You did the right thing by calling me.
I can take care of all that.

1015
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,471
No, you wait by the phone.

1016
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,072
We"II make sure she"s safe.
You don"t have to worry.

1017
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,799
You bet. Thank you.

1018
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,797
All right. End of the line.

1019
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:10,071
Jesus, we"re overheating.
We"re lucky to get here at all.

1020
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,838
Hang on. Wait for me.

1021
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,670
The lights are on, so I guess
there must be somebody in there.

1022
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,749
Lou.

1023
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,760
- It"s me, Rick.
- In a minute.

1024
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,711
Stubborn old guy, isn"t he?

1025
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,112
You mind if we come in?

1026
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,996
l"II see you at the front door.

1027
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,956
- Lou.
- Yes?

1028
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,438
It"s me, Rick Jarmin.

1029
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,833
My Lord. So it is.

1030
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,355
Jeez, Lou.

1031
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,112
Come on in. Hi.

1032
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,589
- This is Marianne Graves.
- How do you do?

1033
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:09,239
You scared the hell out of me.
I thought you forgot who I was.

1034
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,308
I damn near did.

1035
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,755
l"d be in big trouble then,
"cause l"m in a spot...

1036
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,957
...and you"re about the only guy
in the world who can help me out.

1037
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,553
Where do I start?

1038
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,108
They finally let Sorenson out of the cage.

1039
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:25,557
He and Diggs are after us, and they seem
to know every move we"re making.

1040
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,234
I think somebody at the Bureau
is doing us in.

1041
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,793
I work at the zoo.

1042
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,350
- L"ve got connections there.
- You placed me there, remember?

1043
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,908
It"s just down the block.

1044
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,992
I can find it every time, even in the dark.

1045
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,957
Molly likes it that way.

1046
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,479
Are you Monty?

1047
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,030
l"m sorry. I didn"t hear the bell.

1048
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,189
Are you the young man who was calling?

1049
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,519
I told you I didn"t think he"d remember.

1050
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,716
That"s why I thought
you should come here.

1051
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,758
Sometimes it helps if he sees a face.

1052
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,596
Ma"am, do you know who that is?

1053
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:31,677
Those are federal marshals. I called them.
I thought this was a setup.

1054
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,274
Even if it isn"t a setup,
you have to talk to them.

1055
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,271
You can"t keep running...

1056
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,993
You"re right about one thing.
There"s nowhere else to run.

1057
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,310
- You have a basement here?
- It"s off the kitchen.

1058
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,437
- Can you show it to me?
- What have I done? L"m sorry.

1059
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:55,989
It"s designed as a bomb shelter.
No one can get in here.

1060
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,753
Go and lock yourselves in.
Don"t come out till it"s quiet.

1061
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:02,310
- Where are you going, Rick?
- I don"t know, Lou.

1062
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,914
How about the zoo? They got guns there.

1063
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,958
- You know every inch of the way.
- That"s a good idea.

1064
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:13,869
Zoo.

1065
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,910
Hello?

1066
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,509
Hurry up!

1067
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,792
You got nothing to fear. Joe Weyburn.

1068
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,872
- Aren"t those guys gonna follow us?
- Damn well better.

1069
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,358
They"ve changed the code.

1070
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,109
Not now!

1071
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,075
- How did you...?
- I can"t believe I did that.

1072
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,274
- Come on.
- Wait.

1073
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,198
You didn"t see us, Bob, okay?

1074
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,918
That"s gotta be them.

1075
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,829
Be careful.

1076
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,835
Stationery.

1077
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,354
Where is it?
Where do they put these things?

1078
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,270
- They used to have real guns here.
- What"s that?

1079
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,078
That"s a tranquilizer gun.

1080
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,034
l"m sorry.

1081
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,757
l"m sorry I did this to you.
I called them on you.

1082
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,599
That"s all right.

1083
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,671
I should be apologizing to you.

1084
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,110
It"s probably for the best.

1085
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:59,512
- Fifteen years is long enough.
- Yeah, it is.

1086
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,273
Lock the doors and stay in here
no matter what you see.

1087
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,157
Don"t come out. Just stay in here.

1088
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,879
If you see me do this,
I want you to hit this button.

1089
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,712
See what it does?

1090
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,916
See those lights there? It turns them on.

1091
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,877
Just like that, okay?

1092
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,998
Keep your head down.

1093
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:26,074
Please live through this.
I can"t go to another one of your funerals.

1094
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,670
You remember, you stay in here.

1095
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,791
"Cause it"s a zoo out there.

1096
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,399
Which one did he say?

1097
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,919
Rick? It"s Joe Weyburn.

1098
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:19,078
We don"t mean you any harm.
We just want to talk.

1099
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,230
Welcome to the tropical rain forest.

1100
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,232
We have assembled a collection
of flora and fauna...

1101
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:23,518
...indigenous to both the South American
rain forest and the African Savannah.

1102
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,389
There.

1103
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,756
Shit!

1104
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:31,559
Think I got him!

1105
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,919
Gotta stop this thing somehow.
Go get that girl!

1106
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:37,230
Yeah!

1107
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,313
Wake up! All of ya! Get up!

1108
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,954
Rise and shine! Get up!

1109
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,957
Come on, fellas. Give me a hand.

1110
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,433
Shut up! Get back.

1111
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,474
Shut up!

1112
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:34,239
Shit.

1113
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:32,994
Excuse me.

1114
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,428
Surprise!

1115
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,794
Come on. Hands behind your head.
Fingers clenched.

1116
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:00,869
Now!

1117
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:04,269
What is that shit? Get over there!

1118
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:05,429
Spread them!

1119
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:08,588
I got him! I got Jarmin!

1120
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,750
What do you need him for?
Why don"t you...

1121
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:13,752
No, buddy, this is his kill.
Means a lot to him.

1122
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:19,389
My head.

1123
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,352
I got your lady here.

1124
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,000
Come out, or l"II throw her to the tigers.

1125
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,274
You"re wrong, Rick,
if you think I won"t do it!

1126
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,991
Don"t you even want to watch?

1127
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:51,071
l"d hate for you to miss this.

1128
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,799
Fifteen years!

1129
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:52,439
Fifteen years l"ve waited for this!

1130
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,353
It"s me.

1131
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:07,992
It"s me. Take my hand.

1132
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:19,395
Please!

1133
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,437
I can"t hold on.

1134
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,795
Yes, you can. Come on, honey.
You can do it.

1135
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,110
Just pull me towards you.

1136
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,668
l"m sorry I can"t get you out of this.

1137
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:48,315
Me, too. Listen.

1138
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,551
l"m free now. I could marry you.

1139
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:53,676
You liar. You wouldn"t marry me.

1140
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,515
I could if you"d just
put a little extra effort in.

1141
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,113
A little extra effort?

1142
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:04,479
Instead of just watching the father
of your children become tiger meat!

1143
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:07,119
- Children?
- Children.

1144
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,038
Are you all right, honey?

1145
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,194
Who are you?

1146
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,473
Look at me.

1147
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:33,075
Rick, look at me. L"m Marianne.

1148
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:36,118
Remember we were gonna get married
and have children?

1149
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:42,030
l"m pleased to meet you, Marianne.

1150
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:51,318
You dirty rat! Don"t even try
to weasel out of this one.

1151
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,710
- L"II sue you for breach of promise!
- I haven"t got any money.

1152
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,519
- What"II you get, my underpants?
- I want your underpants.

1153
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:08,476
I got something I want to show you.

1154
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:11,149
Get up. Get your lazy ass off.

1155
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,439
You"ve heard that expression:

1156
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,830
"'Something old, something new,
something borrowed and something..."'

1157
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:24,148
Very blue.

1158
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,757
Mr. Wiggly is unfurled.

1159
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,910
And if that"s not a hint, what is?
