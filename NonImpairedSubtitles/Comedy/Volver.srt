00:00:18,738 --> 00:00:22,173
#This very little premature morning

2
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:25,477
#I went out of the common
people with the little herd,

3
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:28,680
#And as then dawn was coming

4
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:31,048
#I was receiving it

5
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:34,152
#Singing like a little bird

6
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:37,888
#This very little premature morning

7
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:40,859
#For the lanes of the brushwood,

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,561
#I am the hormiguita of the spoils

9
00:00:44,562 --> 00:00:47,799
#And as he has very good eyes

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,238
#He spindles sometimes of the bunches.

11
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,208
#Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch,

12
00:00:57,209 --> 00:01:00,811
#What work commands the Lord  to us!

13
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,113
TO RETURN
#Getting up and turning
around to bend down ...

14
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:05,783
Put stones to the vase,
That he falls down, Paula.

15
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:12,356
All day long to the
airs and in the sunlight.

16
00:01:12,357 --> 00:01:13,758
Wind of the testicles!

17
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,529
Open into letters
well, that they shine .

18
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:23,702
The women from here live more Than
the men. Minus the poor mother.

19
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:25,470
Raimunda, do not say that!

20
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:28,505
Embrace died to father, than era It
what else he was wanting to in the world!

21
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:34,344
Dying in a fire ... I do not
believe that there be worse death.

22
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,780

They shop first His little piece of land
and they take care of  it while one is alive,

51
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:42,412
As it were a chalet.

52

This house comes afterwards
smelling like mother to me.

65
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:28,491
How is it, aunt?

66
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:32,895
What you are thin! The fact is that
you right now have given birth ?

67
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:34,430

00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:59,354
The wind drags along The
live coals to the thicket.

75
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:06,061
A that hour he begins the fire More
tragedian of the last ones 13 years.

76
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,563
No, if I do not see her.

No.

95
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,013
He would be better off at a
residence, Assisted as it should be.

00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:00,382
I am doing very well as I am .

The Agustina brings bread  to
me, Your mother makes me food.

114
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:33,641
The important the fact is
that you return, Raimund

115
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:57,297

do We go where the Agustina?

122
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:20,320
Yes.

123
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:24,157
Enter, enter !

124
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:27,260
Good guy, how have you found the aunt?

125
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:28,128
Bad.

126
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,262
Fatal.

127
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:34,334
He is very clumsy. I do not
know how he covers up for  them.

128
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:38,104
He eats every day his pa's bar When
I arrive his little money has pair

129
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:39,239
Let's go to the patio.

130
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,974
She has become a grief,
A grief, daughter mine.

131
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,977
He does not know whereon year live !

132
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:46,513
He talks about our mother As
if the living person keep on !

133
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:47,380
Yes.

134
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,017
The fact is that he stops she has not
died And he does not get used to the idea .

135
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:52,786
Sit down a little bit, he walks .

136
00:07:52,787 --> 00:08:01,995
I was intending to pay you every month,
stops that you put in an eye every day.

137
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:04,630
But I eat no, cast out my husband,
To see where I introduce it.

138
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:06,099
But we have to do something.

139
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,369
All mornings, before of Doing
the buy, I touch his window

140
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,705
And until I do not hear her surrendering
The good days, I do not go away .

141
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,374
I am concerned about her.

142
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:18,043
You do not know how I
thank it to you, Agusti.

143
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,680
I think that I hope so

144
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:24,050
Do the same thing with my mother ...

145
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:26,585
Be at be .

146
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:35,461
You see what modern era was he?

147
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:38,397
The one and only the
common people's hippie.

148
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:42,301
He looks at lasjoyas of plastic.

149
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:43,302
They are a passage!

150
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:49,575
A plastic good guy.

151
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:51,877
Every time that I smoke
a joint I remember her.

152
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:54,747
Walk, than small example you
are opening into the Paula.

153
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,348
Do you keep on without news?

154
00:08:56,349 --> 00:09:00,285
Swim . Not even if the tierr
would have it swallowed itself

155
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:01,954
And your sister Brígida?

156
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:08,093
It? Keep on in Madrid,
Succeeding in the telebasura.

157
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:10,329
Mother, has finished me the balance.

158
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:13,165
Better, thus we rested a
small amount of the telephone!

159
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,366
If you want to, use the mine.

160
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,300
No, that he ruins you.

161
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:16,669
Then, no.

162
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,070
That counted you: To the Brígida that
many software have appeared to  him

163
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,340

00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:33,615
Sole, I have A clothing hill to iron

323
00:23:33,616 --> 00:23:35,784
And I take all afternoon
Working at the airport.

326
00:23:40,557 --> 00:23:41,657
When?

327
00:23:41,658 --> 00:23:46,494
A little while ago.

That the aunt Paula has died .

329
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:58,273

Don't cry, beautiful.

331
00:24:00,442 --> 00:24:03,679
Look, Agustina has told
me that we not worry  ourselves,

332
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,150
Than while we arrived, She and they
are  shrouding her cross-eyed.

333
00:24:09,151 --> 00:24:12,253
Even he had elected the casket And all
stamp indicating payment has left it!

334

He can hardly believe that I be

339
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:35,943
Don't even mention it! You know
The fear that the dead give me.

340
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:37,679
But you do not have Why seeing the aunt.

341
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,947
I will say the Agustina
That he take care of that .

342
00:24:39,948 --> 00:24:41,616
Ysi  to me do they ask for you?

343
00:24:41,617 --> 00:24:45,320
Because, you say that they have just finished

Yentonces I asked around : ´´Who is ?´´.

That he had given up A
promise without doing my job.

00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,135
Or that they make wrong  themselves.

642
00:48:03,136 --> 00:48:06,071
And my life has not been an exception,

643
00:48:06,072 --> 00:48:08,740
But I do not know if
they have a solution .

644
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:10,409
And if they have it,

645
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:14,713
He reciprocates his love
to me  to me to fix them.
