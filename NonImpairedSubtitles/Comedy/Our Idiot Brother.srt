1
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,404
- How much?
- Two dollars.

2
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,834
All right.

3
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,063
- There you go.
- Thanks.

4
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,370
Sadie. Those aren't ours.
Sorry, sorry.

5
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,013
- Let's go find Mommy.
- Sadie.

6
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,384
Thank you.

7
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,252
Officer Washburn, how you doing today?

8
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,726
Ned, you always have
the most gorgeous rhubarb.

9
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,887
It's Willie Nelson's poo
that gives it that glow.

10
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,529
- My dog, Willie Nelson.
- Oh, Hey, Willie.

11
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:32,898
Is that true?

12
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,107
Um... Listen, Ned...

13
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,938
...you wouldn't happen to know where I
could get some, uh...

14
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,376
- You know what I mean?
- What?

15
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,642
Roll it up, toke it up, do it up.

16
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,818
- Mary Jane...
- You know, officer...

17
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,550
...even if I did,
do you really think I'd tell you?

18
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,048
Oh, uh...

19
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,326
You're right, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,222
It's... it's been a hard week,
you know?

21
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,327
But, not your problem.

23
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,232
You have a good day.

24
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,073
Officer.

25
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,851
Here you go, officer,
have some rhubarb.

26
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,487
Hey, thanks, man. Wow.

27
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,319
- How much do I owe you?
- Nothing.

28
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,189
Seriously, I understand. I know
what it's like to have a hard week.

29
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,264
Well, thank you, but I wouldn't
be able to enjoy it unless I...

30
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,599
All right, if you insist. Uh...

31
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,599
Twenty bucks.

32
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,506
- Twenty bucks?
- Yeah.

33
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,768
- Put it back into the produce.
- Twenty bucks.

34
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,278
- All right, thank you.
- Excellent.

35
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:54,283
You're under arrest.

36
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,448
- Really.
- Oh!

37
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,286
You're under arrest.

38
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,687
Oh, shit.

39
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,861
Willie Nelson didn't do anything.

40
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,060
It's gonna be OK, Willie Nelson.

41
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,364
It's gonna be all right.

42
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,072
So, Kaplan,
from Westbank Capital, right,

43
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,580
he stands up, bids $25,000.

44
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,243
This is like a $500 bottle of wine,
$480, right.

45
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,087
- OK.
- Great, yeah. Good night.

46
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,259
OK.

47
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:45,267
- Take this off.

48
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,100
Damn it. What?

49
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,763
Jeremy, my pilot light's out again.

50
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,070
Well, just use a match, you moron.

51
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,735
Last time I did that
I almost singed off my eyeball.

52
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,245
Will you just come up and
do the thing with the thing

53
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,180
behind the thing that you did?
it'll take two minutes.

54
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,911
Goddamn it.
OK, I'll be up in five minutes. OK?

55
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,352
- What?!
- Are you having sex?

56
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,023
- OK, I'll be right there.
- You're gonna leave right now?

57
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,594
I'll be back in a couple of minutes,
I just have to help her out.

58
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,197
- No.
- I'm a good neighbor.

59
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:22,867
Huh! It's, uh, 7:35,
you know kids these days.

60
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,406
It's so depressing.

61
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,442
Your friends from the law firm
will be here, right?

62
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,445
Yeah, but it's casual Friday.

63
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,277
OK, what does that mean?

64
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,147
A lot of bad lawyer clothes.

65
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,982
One of the things
about being the dumb, slutty one

66
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,489
is that it gives you
a unique perspective.

67
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:44,561
So, Ralph and I are doing it
on the ping pong table,

68
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,758
you know, fucking.

69
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,779
Hey.

70
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,179
Hey.

71
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,021
Oh, my God.
What have you done to your vagina?

72
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,696
It's a Brazilian.

73
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,161
Bizarre.

74
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,468
See you later, Campbell!
Take good care of that leg,

75
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,272
- Take care.
- Hey! Hope I don't see you again.

76
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,282
J' I'm coming home
I've done my time

77
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,854
J' Now I've got to know
what is and isn't mine

78
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:50,017
J' If you received my letter
telling you I'd soon be free

79
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,629
J' Then you'll know
just what to do

80
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,357
J' If you still want me

81
00:05:55,522 --> 00:06:00,369
J' Then you still want me

82
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:05,067
J' Tie a yellow ribbon
'round the ole oak tree

83
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:10,477
J' three been three long years
Do you still want me?

84
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:15,677
J' If I don't see a ribbon
'round the ole oak tree

85
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,016
J' I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us

86
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,159
J' Put the blame on me

87
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,727
J' If I don't see
a yellow ribbon 'round

88
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,264
- J' The ole oak tree I

89
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,527
- Get back.

90
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:32,863
You stay cool, little mama.

91
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,171
Not in front of the chickens, babe...

92
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,334
- Sweetie! Hey, sweetheart.
- Ned! Whoa.

93
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,175
- Whoa. What are you doing here, man?
- They let me go early.

94
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:48,513
Good behavior. I won Most Cooperative
Inmate, four months running.

95
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,554
- Of course you were.
- I missed you so much.

96
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,213
- Baby, I...
- Hey, man.

97
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,016
Hi.

98
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,689
Ned, this is Billy.
Billy, this is.,. Ned.

99
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,960
Oh. I've heard a lot about you.
How's it going, Ned?

100
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,367
Janet's told me a lot of stuff about
you. Some of it's pretty intense.

101
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,634
I've made some changes
since you've been gone.

102
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,039
I told her to tell you earlier,
but you know what she's like...

103
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,307
Billy, you said you'd be supportive.

104
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,882
- Sorry, man.
- it's all right.

105
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,111
It's cool you're out of jail.

106
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,916
- I'll let you guys do this.
- All right.

107
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,616
Thanks, Billy.

108
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:34,095
Wow, man.
Well... where do I go now?

109
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:38,225
Ned, you had, like,
eight months to think about this.

110
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,065
Yeah, but for eight months I thought
I was coming back here,

111
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,002
I mean, I've lived here for three years.

112
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:46,235
- I lived here before you lived here.
- it's not a contest!

113
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,902
Dude, this is what happens
when you don't use your head.

114
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,607
Can you just think for a minute what it
was like for me these past few months?

115
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,912
You? Well, you know, where-'s...
Where's Willie Nelson?

116
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,521
Willie Nelson? Willie!

117
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,586
Willie! Hey, buddy!

118
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,920
- We'll be fine.
- But Willie Nelson is not your dog.

119
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,427
Tim, who's my friend, left him here.

120
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,998
Willie, who do you wanna live with?
Who do you wanna live with?

121
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,496
That is so not cool, Ned.

122
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,366
Are you seriously gonna
put that dog in that position?

123
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,340
Look, I am really happy
that you got out of prison.

124
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,206
But it is not fair to uproot
this animal. He loves it here.

125
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,679
I'm not gonna uproot him.
I'm still gonna work here.

126
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,819
Well, you think that Dave is gonna
take you back after what you did?

127
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,985
- Well, I'm still taking him with me.
- Where?

128
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,457
- Where, Ned?
- I...

129
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,119
That's what I thought.
Come on, Willie Nelson. Come on.

130
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,323
- Let's go.
- Come on! How can you do this to me?

131
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,490
To us?

132
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:48,036
We've had three beautiful years, man.
Let me go.

133
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,970
Not me and you, me and Willie Nelson.

134
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,006
Let's go.

135
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,972
- Come here. Get inside.
- Oh. Geez, Louise.

136
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:02,311
J' Today as I walk
through my garden

137
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,148
J' Of dreams

138
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,722
I I'm alone in the sweet

139
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,826
Where do you want me
to drop you, man?

140
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,825
Anywhere. Here's fine.

141
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:14,056
J' My past and my present

142
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,168
- I Are one and the same
- Hey, man, you gonna be all right?

143
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,600
- I And the future holds
- Yeah.

144
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,264
J' Nothing for me

145
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:32,377
- I Yesterdays kisses...
- Buddy, you can't come with me.

146
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,543
Don't you start crying,
too, OK?

147
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:40,885
J' And yesterday's memories
still find me

148
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,527
- J' Scenes from the past
- I can't,..

149
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,757
J' Keep returning

150
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:56,871
J' I've got a wonderful future
behind me

151
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:19,127
J' You say them is happiness

152
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,495
J' Waiting for me

153
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,397
J' But I know... I

154
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:30,405
Hey, man, Janet's been trying
to rent out that old goat barn.

155
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,067
If you could get two months worth of
rent together, then maybe you could...

156
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,807
Seriously? Well,
what's she asking per month?

157
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,973
Well, she's been asking $400,

158
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,849
but for you, she'd probably
give it to you for $500.

159
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,252
You think she'd go for it?

160
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,450
You just worry about
getting that money together.

161
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,425
I'll take care of Janet.

162
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,856
Right on. Thanks, man.

163
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,696
Hey, just remember,

164
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,670
Omega-3s for the blepharitis,
it helps with everything.

165
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,935
- Thanks for the tip, Ned.
- Thanks, Hauser.

166
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,546
You know what the worst part is? She's
insisting on keeping Willie Nelson.

167
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,010
- No!
- No, way!

168
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,117
I thought she was a Buddhist
or something,

169
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,446
I'm so sorry, I know
how much you love him.

170
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,315
- That sucks, Ned.
- Yeah, it's really tough,

171
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,616
but you know what I'm gonna do
is get some money together

172
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,522
and I'm gonna rent the goat barn
on the back 40, so...

173
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,459
The goat barn. Pff.
Better hurry up on that one.

174
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,395
- Yeah.
- How much you need for the goat barn?

175
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,560
I'm sure we could rustle up
some cash for you?

176
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:38,532
Um, I thought we agreed as a family
not to loan each other money.

177
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,904
Yeah, no, right, obviously.

178
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,637
Because then we would've blown through
Dylan's inheritance by now.

179
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:48,684
I just thought that it would be,
you know, better if Ned were to...

180
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,914
...earn it himself.

181
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,148
For Ned, yeah, for you.

182
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,157
Absolutely, no, for sure.
I'm not a charity case.

183
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,820
I wanna work, so if you hear of
anything, any odd jobs or anything,

184
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,330
please, let me know, because...

185
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,866
Maybe there's something
on your movie you could...

186
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,428
There wouldn't... No, no.

187
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,666
No. No, we're pretty well-staffed
at the moment.

188
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,332
Yeah, sorry, it's...

189
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,035
You know what you really need
is to get laid.

190
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,614
I have, like, live hot roommates,
a couple of them would totally fuck you.

191
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,512
- Definitely.
- Dude,

192
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,119
can we discuss living with
that many people at this age?

193
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,687
I mean, it's kind of gnarly.

194
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,688
Well, actually, we looked at
a two-bedroom in Brooklyn Heights.

195
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,690
- Right, Nat?
- For you two?

196
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,227
- That's awesome.
- Good! That's so exciting!

197
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,262
- Can I come check it out?
- Yeah, of course.

198
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,559
Contain your enthusiasm, Nat.

199
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,202
No, it's just...

200
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,305
I get worried, because...

201
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:45,068
...people who move in together
always end up either breaking up

202
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,801
or getting married.

203
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,376
- OK,
- No, no, no, no.

204
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,480
Why would you say that in front
of everybody? I don't understand.

205
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,545
- Come here.
- OK.

206
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,788
Take a breath, Mom.

207
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,726
- Relax, take a breath.
- We have to go. Seth has a show.

208
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,662
- Yeah. Who's Seth?
- I have a deadline. I'm gonna go too.

209
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,496
What about cake? Aren't we
gonna play a game or something?

210
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,502
We should probably
get going as well.

211
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:18,074
Hey, sunshine, we gotta get home
and practice your shehnai,

212
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,565
You're right.

213
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,905
I'll cut you a slice, River,
you can take it with you.

214
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,571
Oh, no, he had a cupcake yesterday.

215
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,414
We're off sugar today.
Thanks, though, Ned,

216
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,986
Such a lucky kid,
gets a cupcake once a week.

217
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,623
So, I'll see you guys next week, OK?

218
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,850
- Bye, Mom!
- You guys really have to go so soon?

219
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,584
It's still light out.

220
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,922
I know, but I'm so psyched
to have you next week.

221
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,190
- Yeah, to next week! Bye, guys.
- Cindy!

222
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,096
Coming, coming!

223
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,172
Our door is always open, Ned.

224
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,338
We'll see you next week, OK? Bye!

225
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,107
Bye!

226
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,975
You know, Nedly, I love you.

227
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,278
I love you too, Mom.

228
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,717
Even though you've never had a real job
and that problem with the jail business,

229
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,652
and you've never given me
any grandchildren.

230
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,715
Yeah, well...

231
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,292
Any plans for tomorrow?

232
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,855
I don't even know where to begin.

233
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,297
Then we'll drive over to Calico Corner,
I gotta get a new button.

234
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,631
- You need any?
- I'm OK.

235
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,138
Let's get an early start,
we'll beat the crowds.

236
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,004
OK.

237
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:31,310
I'm glad you're staying here.

238
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,341
Nighty-night.

239
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,420
- Good night, Mom.
- Sleep tight.

240
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,853
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

241
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:49,930
I'm... Officer...
Omar... Coleman.

242
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:56,264
I'm... your... parole." officer.

243
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,834
I'm Ned Rochlin.
Why are you talking so slow?

244
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,911
I just figured, looking at your sheet,

245
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,845
that since you sold grass
to a uniformed police officer

246
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,507
that you must be retarded.

247
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,553
- Yeah, I get that a lot.
- Right.

248
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,782
You need a signed rental agreement
in your name

249
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,552
or written confirmation that
you're staying with a family member.

250
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:20,528
OK. Well, currently I'm staying with
my mom in Long Island. Although, I...

251
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,597
You're required to appear
before me every three weeks,

252
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,531
at which time you'll provide me
with a urine sample. You understand?

253
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,364
Oh, yes, sir, Your Honor.

254
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,734
State of New York requires you
to reflect upon the choices

255
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,432
that led to your incarceration.

256
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,034
- Cool.
- Cool.

257
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,773
Um, what steps are you taking to avoid
such choices in the future?

258
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,716
Uh... I'll tell you,
that's really tough...

259
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,411
,..tough for me, sir. I don't really...

260
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,153
Hmm. Hm.

261
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:54,260
Wow, that's a good question. I don't...
it's tough to answer right now.

262
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,229
I haven't thought about it
that much, but,

263
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,630
I don't know. I mean, I'm not
gonna be working at the farm anymore.

264
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,397
- OK.
- Although, you might not want to

265
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,905
write that one down, 'cause it's
not so much a step, per se.

266
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,304
Because it's not my choice.
I'd love to be working there,

267
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,675
but my girlfriend, Janet,
doesn't want it to happen really.

268
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,583
How about we put down you're staying
away from past criminal associates?

269
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,013
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Sure.

270
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,744
- If you think that's best.
- Yeah.

271
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,455
You know what? I'll think about it
and I'll try and come back next time

272
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:26,085
with some more steps and options, that
kind of thing, for our next meeting.

273
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,095
- You do that, buddy.
- This is cool, man.

274
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,995
- Yeah.
- This is like...

275
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,694
This is like free therapy.
New York State cares.

276
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,774
Is that it? That's it?

277
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,503
- That's it.
- My 50 minutes are up?

278
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,705
- Yeah.
- All right, man, OK.

279
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:45,872
- OK.
- Thanks a lot.

280
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,882
Hey, is it lame if I bail on Nat's show?

281
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,351
Yeah. Then no one will be there.

282
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,684
What the hell is that noise?

283
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:58,022
- Oh, that's River's shehnai.

284
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,790
You have no idea how competitive
admissions have gotten.

285
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,623
God, Ned just showed up.

286
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,136
- I'll call you back.
- All right, bye.

287
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,373
Hi.

288
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,309
- You said your door was always open.
- I did, yeah.

289
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,514
I hope this is OK, Ned.

290
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,584
Are you kidding? This is great.

291
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,725
My God, I get to rock
the full-on slumber party

292
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,917
with my man River every night.

293
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,358
I mean, Mom's great and all, but...

294
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,591
Oh. No, Ned, it's all right. I get it.

295
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,732
So, the deal is, if it's OK with you,

296
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:46,343
you'll get $250 a week,
you'll help us out with River,

297
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:50,606
and you get to work with Dylan
on the documentary.

298
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,011
Yeah, I hope you don't have to tire
anyone to make room for me, Dyl,

299
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,278
Oh, yeah, but it's family first, right?

300
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,418
You guys.

301
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,429
Come on, bud, let's go.

302
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,895
So, you're telling me
you've never seen The Pink Panther?

303
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,826
Mom and Dad don't like violent movies.

304
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:43,092
Yeah, but it's not violent,
it's hilarious.

305
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,257
- Nobody's actually getting hurt.
- Mm-hmm,

306
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,160
Get on your feet. Come on, come here.

307
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,174
On your feet, River Rochlin Byng.

308
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,806
Welcome to my dojo.

309
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,602
Give me a chop.

310
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,149
- What was that?
- Karate chop.

311
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,255
That was a...'? That wasn't a chop.
You know what that was? That was this...

312
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,587
Chop me. Do it.

313
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,196
- How about this?
- Oh! Ah!

314
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,862
Christ! It's after 10:00, for Christ's
sakes, River has school in the morning.

315
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,768
Oh, God, sorry, yeah.
I must've lost track of time again.

316
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,670
Ned, what's the laptop
doing in his bedroom?

317
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,311
We were just watching Pink Panther.

318
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:33,048
We loaned you the computer for your
resume, not to look at pink panthers.

319
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,711
No, The Pink...
It's just Pink Panther

320
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:40,449
This country's obsessed with screens.

321
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,528
He's seven years-old,
for Christ's sakes.

322
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,288
Ahh.

323
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,323
Whoops.

324
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,704
- Good night, Riv.
- Good night.

325
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,502
I mean, he's not
like a criminal or anything,

326
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,168
he's just a fuck-up who needs help.

327
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,144
Well, if he's got any of your genes,
I'd be happy to throw him a few bucks

328
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,477
- to do a little modeling.
- That would be awesome.

329
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,052
Then he'd have cash
and somewhere to go.

330
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,589
Sure. Hey, have you heard
of Sustainable Upgrade?

331
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:19,393
Sustainable Upgrade,
it's a life-coaching program.

332
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,056
It saved me. I was like
your brother is now, floating.

333
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,098
Waiting for someone
to give me a sense of purpose.

334
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,765
Cool, I'll tell him.

335
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,275
Want to come to a meeting too?

336
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,172
- Mmm, I don't know.
- No.

337
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,837
You are capable
of extraordinary things, Natalie.

338
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,548
You just have to let yourself go there.

339
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,014
It's not like a cult, is it?

340
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,850
Cult? No.

341
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,017
No. I'll tell you what,
I'll take you both.

342
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,856
Just check it out, no pressure.

343
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,215
What we're doing is we're
filming this documentary movie

344
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,718
about Tatiana.

345
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:21,051
And all of the artistic repression
that she faced in Belorussia.

346
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:25,389
What I'd love to get from you guys would
be signatures on these releases.

347
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,156
Thank you.

348
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,665
- Excuse me, ladies...
- Jesus.

349
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,571
Ah!

350
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:39,766
- Man...
- It hurts.

351
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,173
- It does. It does, God!
- I know.

352
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,836
I think I need leg warmers.

353
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:47,075
- My Croc is stuck.
- Hey.

354
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,310
- Hey.
- Is this joker bothering you?

355
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,183
No, not at all, He's very cute.

356
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,914
He's pretty funny.

357
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,582
You wanna go grab the bags,
take them down to the car?

358
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,820
Sure, I told her
you're my brother-in-law.

359
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,622
She didn't know you were married.

360
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,322
- Oh.
- No.

361
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:06,459
You gotta look at this thing she can do
with her leg. This is amazing. Show him.

362
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,963
- Look at...!
- I've just been shooting this stuff.

363
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,370
But, hey, I never tire of it.

364
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,978
Look at this. I can get it...
This is how high I can go.

365
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,943
I know. You just did it
five seconds ago.

366
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,778
Oh, yeah. I didn't know if you saw it.

367
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,777
Well, I've been here, like, 25 seconds.

368
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,720
Oh.

369
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,558
Go get the bags, wise-guy.

370
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,026
Well, sure thing, I'll go get 'em, boss.

371
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,461
Seriously, go get the bags.

372
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,795
Oh, yeah, yeah. OK.

373
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,204
Ah!

374
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,674
Oh, right in my gluteus maximus!

375
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,312
- Get your stinky feet off me.
- Stop tickling me!

376
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,573
I'm not tickling you,
what are you talking about?

377
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,047
So has Nat always been a lesbian?

378
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,848
Oh, no, no, she's open
to pretty much anyone.

379
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:03,153
Boys, girls, old, young, thin, fat.

380
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,317
That's a beautiful thing, actually.

381
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,526
- That is beautiful.
- She even slept with our cousin once.

382
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:21,575
- Dude! What the fuck!
- Sorry, sorry." to everybody.

383
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,012
Man, can you hold this? Thanks.

384
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,465
Thanks, man. I feel like an idiot.

385
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,268
- You done yet?
- No, I still can't go.

386
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,375
Gotta get that sample.

387
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,307
Hey, your two job's gonna look
good on my monthly stats.

388
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,538
I'm telling you, Omar,
good things happen.

389
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:01,150
- Good things happen.
- Yeah, I'll keep that in mind, Ned.

390
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,545
Oh, now if you're gonna move into that
barn residence you referred to,

391
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,419
you gotta register the address here
within three days of moving in.

392
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,991
Oh, yeah.

393
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,721
One more minute
or I'm getting the cranberry juice.

394
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,729
Nope, almost there.

395
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,967
There we go.

396
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,961
Oh!

397
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,901
Sorry, man, I shouldn't have gone
before I came here. I'm so stupid.

398
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,338
I don't know what I was thinking.

399
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,104
That was funny, Ned.

400
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,340
- Yeah.
- You,...

401
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,275
The car is now 35 minutes late.

402
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:40,754
If the driver knew there was traffic,
why didn't the driver call me then?

403
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:44,588
Yes, I know, but you see, I'm
interviewing a very important person,

404
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,094
in less than 20 minutes and I...

405
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,163
Don't...!

406
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,994
Jer, see if he's out there for me.

407
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,464
Yep.

408
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:56,771
This is a disaster, Jer.
I cannot be late for this.

409
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,970
- Jesus Christ.
- No.

410
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:04,046
I can't believe
I'm calling this person.

411
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,705
Who is she exactly?

412
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,478
Lady Arabella Galloway,
heir presumptive to the House of Stuart,

413
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,643
one of the wealthiest women
in the world.

414
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,948
Jesus.

415
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:16,218
Yeah, her creepy ex-boyfriend stole
ten million dollars from the family,

416
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,521
and then sold their sex tape
to pay his legal bills,

417
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,392
He's a gem. OK, Ned,
you gotta do me a favor.

418
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,464
First of all, we need to step on it,
we're really late.

419
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,796
Next of all, maybe don't say
anything stupid.

420
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,202
Actually, don't say anything at all.
Just keep your mouth shut.

421
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,172
This is the first time I'm writing about
an actual person, not just moisturizer.

422
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,811
So I really can't fuck it up.

423
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,676
- Hi, Lady Arabella.
- Hi.

424
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,686
- Miranda Rochlin, Vanity Fair
- Nice to meet you.

425
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,486
So nice to meet you.
Here, just jump right in.

426
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,829
So sorry that we were late.
The town car was stuck in traffic,

427
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,159
-this is my sister's car, I had to...
- it's OK.

428
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,198
- OK. I feel horrible.
- No, it's lovely to meet you.

429
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:01,099
- Thank you, you too.
- Hi, I'm Arabella.

430
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,866
You can introduce yourself, Ned.

431
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,172
Oh, yes. I'm Ned.

432
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,677
- I'm her brother.
- Yeah, he's just my brother.

433
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,509
That's... that's all.

434
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,082
So, are you two a team?

435
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,345
Us? No. Hm-mm. No.

436
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,420
I'm just kind of doing this
as an odd job,

437
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,751
- Yeah.
- Been out of the workforce for a while.

438
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,895
- Really? Where were you?
- Oh, I was sort of in jail.

439
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,088
Oh. He's not a..,
He's not a criminal or anything,

440
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,257
he's just an organic farmer
that made a stupid mistake. So...

441
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,029
- Well, biodynamic, actually.
- OK, Ned.

442
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:37,197
What is biodynamic, exactly?
I've never understood the difference.

443
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,467
Planting kind of depends
on the lunar calendar.

444
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,702
- Species of lettuce, for example...
- Thank you, Ned.

445
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:44,108
Arabella?
I was thinking we should get started.

446
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:49,719
OK, my lawyer said you agreed not to ask
about him and the whole YouTube thing,

447
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,716
Absolutely, yeah.
Everybody's dated a jerk,

448
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:56,883
so at the end of the day,
that is just an old, boring story.

449
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,460
- OK. Good.
- Yeah.

450
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:05,296
No, what I'm truly fascinated by is the
work you are doing with Destiny's House.

451
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,995
It's the same story
for all of them.

452
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,903
Seduced at 13 or 14 by grown men
who make them feel loved

453
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:14,840
and then brainwash them
into prostitution.

454
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,512
- So sad.
- Yeah,

455
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,616
Well, I guess we're all capable
of trusting the wrong person.

456
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,580
Are you speaking
from personal experience?

457
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,586
Hey, Ebony, thank you for the playlist.

458
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,418
- Love Major Lazer.
- No problem.

459
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,083
And then there's Shanequa,
she got really into boxing.

460
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,753
Not just like boxing matches,
more like Tight training.

461
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,921
- Shanequa?
- Yeah, you know my nephew River

462
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:40,093
wants to do something like that, but Liz
won't have anything to do with it.

463
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,671
- Is that the lesbian sister?
- That's Nat,

464
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,866
She's really more of a bisexual.
Or at least formerly-bisexual.

465
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:50,104
I don't know how you describe it.
How would you describe Nat?

466
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,172
- Arabella, I was wondering...
- If you guys are interested,

467
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,215
you should come to the benefit
we're having on Sunday,

468
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,615
- Benefit? Oh, yeah!
- The girls will be there.

469
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,052
That could be great.

470
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:03,056
- I do have this deadline, though.
- Man, I love it.

471
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:06,389
One minute I'm scrubbing toilets at
Marble Valley Regional with Dom,

472
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,793
cut to: I'm on the charity circuit.

473
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,362
- Mm.
- It's good, right?

474
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,561
- Are you convinced?
- Nice, nice.

475
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,036
Way to tell it true, yeah.

476
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,176
Anybody else? How about you? Beth?

477
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,208
Share your story.

478
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:22,834
Sure.

479
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:27,740
Hi, everyone, my name is Beth Phillips

480
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,216
and I'm from Paramus, New Jersey.

481
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,912
Hey, Beth.

482
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:36,252
Uh, I used to call myself
a romance addict.

483
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:39,021
And then, I went in the win room.

484
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:44,331
And came out knowing I just used sex
to make me feel like I was in control.

485
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:49,867
But now, I'm engaged to marry a man
who actually loves me.

486
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,738
He's so awesome.
He just knit me a scarf.

487
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,938
Isn't that a beautiful
testimony?

488
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,679
Let's go to the win room.

489
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:05,087
So now, um,
I'm in my crib and...

490
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:10,556
...this time my sister's
not strangling me.

491
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,556
She's hugging me and...

492
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,295
l feel so positive
and, like, really, like, clear.

493
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:20,062
Like I can do anything.

494
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,195
- Yes, you can. You can do anything.

495
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:24,966
That's a great win, Natalie.

496
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,303
- Yeah.
- It was beautiful.

497
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:28,968
Hydrate.

498
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:37,710
What about you, Ned?
What are you feeling?

499
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:39,918
Uhh.,.

500
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,383
I just... I feel really hot.

501
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,457
Right. Do you want to expand on that?

502
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,059
All I want is to take that pitcher
and just dump it

503
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,726
onto my penis and balls.

504
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:59,400
Move on through it. Come away from the
testicles and up to your higher self.

505
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,101
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Don't throw up in this tent.

506
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,974
Can I please have water without win?

507
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,015
Without a win? Can I please have water
without a win? Can you give me some?

508
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,812
Don't enable him. Don't...

509
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,346
Ned?

510
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,282
- I'm fine, really.
- You're gonna be fine, man.

511
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:18,917
- We just gotta take you in, all right?
- Are you sure I can't come? I want to.

512
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:22,361
No, no, really. I'm fine. I promise.
You kids enjoy yourseives.

513
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,933
And, seriously,
congratulations on your wins.

514
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,299
I love you, Ned, bye.

515
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,130
Cite Ohio v. McNally, Doug.

516
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,137
Oliver Wendell Holmes 101.

517
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,678
Yeah, I'll be in in about 40 minutes.
We can talk about it then. OK.

518
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:18,578
- You're so smart.
- Thanks, baby.

519
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,719
- You really have to go?
- Yeah. I do.

520
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:40,575
OK...

521
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,913
You know, Ned... Uh...

522
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,244
...maybe you should wait here. I've got
to do an interview with Tatiana,

523
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,217
- which could be a little sensitive.
- Really, how so?

524
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,350
Well, it's too sensitive, you know,
even to discuss.

525
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:57,460
- Wow.
- Why don't you chill out in the car,

526
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:02,031
- while I go and do it.
- Yeah.

527
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,861
- Do you need any help?
- No, just chill out in the car.

528
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,468
All right.

529
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,251
Come on.

530
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,822
How we doing this evening?

531
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:30,391
Good. Good. Everything's great, officer.

532
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,994
I'm on parole.

533
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,596
- Any trouble here?
- No, no trouble at all.

534
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:39,225
My brother-in-law's doing a documentary
up in the building up there,

535
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,064
and I'm just...

536
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:44,002
This is my job, to watch this.

537
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,664
No trouble, we're not breaking the law.

538
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,833
You're in a 24-hour tow zone.

539
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:51,071
You gotta move this vehicle,
tow truck's behind me.

540
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:54,080
Well, all right.
Thank you for your service.

541
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,016
Ahh.

542
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,925
Just gotta get the keys!

543
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,031
Dylan! Dylan!

544
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,931
Dylan!

545
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,772
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

546
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,278
I'm sorry,
I just really need the car keys.

547
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:27,178
I told you never
to interrupt me when I'm working.

548
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,286
Yeah, sorry about that, man.
I need the keys, we're gonna get towed.

549
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:33,446
Wait, wait, wait. Why are they towing
the car? What the fuck did you do?!

550
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:37,287
- I didn't do anything.
- That was your one responsibility, Ned.

551
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,793
Your one responsibility!

552
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,736
Hey, Tatiana. Sorry!

553
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,389
Ned, interviewing is an art form.

554
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:13,018
When you ask someone to be vulnerable
or naked, you have to be naked too,

555
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,824
to make them feel comfortable.

556
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,024
- That make sense?
- Yeah, I guess.

557
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,668
Great.

558
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:25,000
This piece is about Destiny's House.

559
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,336
We need more details about her.

560
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,445
- This woman's been through a lot.
- I know.

561
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,775
Robbie, we agreed
with the publicist not to go there.

562
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:35,282
The publicist
is not writing this, Miranda.

563
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,851
You are.

564
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:40,512
Your job is to break through to her,
get her to show a little leg.

565
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,717
- Come on, you're so charming.
- I know.

566
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,885
You begged me
to get you this assignment.

567
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,693
You want to get your first story killed?

568
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,073
It's just getting to be too much.

569
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,437
River's interview is in three days time.
I want him to be...

570
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,207
...enigmatic, erudite,
wise, incandescent.

571
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:09,985
I can't just kick him out.
I'll talk to him.

572
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,953
What, you just decided unilaterally?

573
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,114
No, it's just he's family, Dylan.

574
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,228
I can't just turn my back
on him for no reason.

575
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:26,597
Well, can't one of you just take him,
please? He's driving Dylan crazy.

576
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:29,500
No, all we have is that storage room
and Dan's friends from the Ukraine

577
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,732
are staying there.
There's, like, six of them.

578
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,173
I can't do it. I've got a crazy
deadline, I really need to focus.

579
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,610
OK, well, thank you guys for your help.

580
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,011
I need to find you.

581
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,909
Cato!

582
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,752
What? Where did you go?

583
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:16,315
Hiya!

584
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,883
So, River, I like your name.

585
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,890
It's better than Echo.

586
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:26,655
- Echo?
- That's my sister.

587
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:29,723
River was conceived in India,
near the Ganges.

588
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,394
So what kind of things
do you like to do, River?

589
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,975
- Fighting.
- Fighting?

590
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:44,511
- What kind of fighting?
- Kun Gek Do.

591
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,916
River, why don't you tell Judith
about the shehnai?

592
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,748
He's very, very good, actually.

593
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,220
- When his hand has healed...
- Kun Gek Do.

594
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:58,054
I've never heard of that one before.
Tell me about that.

595
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,323
It's totally cool. Some of the moves
are just like Taekwondo.

596
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,228
You know, kicking...

597
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,062
Hand chopping.

598
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,071
What's special about it is that the guys
can also throw and choke you..,

599
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,073
- Whoa!
- That's enough! I'm so sorry.

600
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,441
Seriously, I have no idea
what he's talking about.

601
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,173
Oh, God!

602
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,841
Riv, where'd you learn about this?

603
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,853
- Uncle Ned and I found it on YouTube.
- YouTube? What?

604
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:30,515
- Ned's so funny.
- Tell me about Uncle Ned.

605
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,525
He just got out of jail.

606
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:36,029
In Japan, for protesting about whales...

607
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,360
,..like the slaughter of whales.

608
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:41,026
I thought you said
he sold drugs to a policeman?

609
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,297
Oh.

610
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:48,305
None of this would be possible
if it wasn't for this amazing woman,

611
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:52,539
Rachel, who is a personal hero
to all of us girls.

612
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,559
An right!

613
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,252
It's lovely to see you, Thank you.

614
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,660
- Arabella, hi! That was amazing.
- Thank you, Miranda.

615
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,062
And you look great.
Whose dress are you wearing?

616
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,500
- Mine.
- You're so clever.

617
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,504
- Thanks for coming.
- Seriously, though, I'd love to know...

618
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,236
I don't understand.
So this cop, he just came up

619
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,848
- and he had the hat, the badge...
- Yeah.

620
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,849
Well, no, he didn't have a hat.
I just thought he was, like, you know...

621
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:31,919
..."Brother, help a brother out,"
you know?

622
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,578
I don't even...

623
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,688
- You're laughing at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.

624
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:39,920
- You're totally laughing.
- I'm laughing at the story, not you.

625
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,190
Here's the thing, I...

626
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,265
I live my life a certain way.

627
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:49,462
And that is that I like to think that
if you put your trust out there,

628
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,766
I mean, if you really...

629
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,774
,..give people the benefit of the doubt,
see their best intentions,

630
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,776
they're gonna want to live up to it.

631
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,381
It doesn't always work out, clearly.

632
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,442
But, more often than not,
I think that if you do,

633
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:06,885
people will rise to the occasion.
I really believe that.

634
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,854
It's very sweet, Ned.

635
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,856
You think I'm an idiot
like everybody else.

636
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,323
No, I don't think you're an idiot.

637
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:16,226
I think that's a really good way
to live your life.

638
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,800
I mean, I'm the same.
At least, I was, yeah.

639
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,302
Until I met the fucking Chilean.

640
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,871
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

641
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,906
What happened?

642
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:34,810
So, I mean, I didn't stab him,
I just was trying to scare him.

643
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,850
You must think I'm a total psychopath.

644
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,988
I think you're fucking awesome.

645
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,681
I do. Hey, you wanna
go out with me sometime?

646
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:48,487
Oh. No, not really. But thanks for
asking. That's really sweet.

647
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,062
You should have seen him, Ned.

648
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,329
He was flying around the room
like a maniac.

649
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,030
I mean, Kum Kak Do,
is that what it's called?

650
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,573
- Kun Gek Do.
- What?

651
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,901
- Kun Gek Do,
- What were you thinking?

652
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,776
Liz, every time he sees
those boys doing karate in class,

653
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:08,508
you should see the look on his face.

654
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,448
He so badly wants to be there.

655
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,280
Dylan and I aren't interested
in those values, Ned.

656
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:16,223
Sorry.

657
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,727
You know, he's just a little boy.

658
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,892
Little boys tight.

659
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:28,629
Doesn't mean he's going to grow up
to be a frat-boy rapist.

660
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,366
I'm sorry.

661
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,603
- Bye.
- Bye.

662
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:57,564
Here, Ned, It's just a little something.

663
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,595
Look, I know you tried.

664
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,762
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

665
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,307
No, no, no, I am.

666
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,443
Wait, what?

667
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,739
How much more do you need to move back
to that sheep farm, or whatever?

668
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,109
Three hundred.

669
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,849
- Oh, yeah, Ned.
- Oh, my God, are you...? Miranda.

670
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:25,591
- Here you go, there's $300. Go home.
- Wait, Miranda.

671
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,163
- Thank you so much.
- OK, I love that she paid you off,

672
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,596
but not, like, the full amount.

673
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:35,203
Well, you know, she has her own way
of doing things.

674
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,532
They both do, I mean...

675
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,766
Hey, you wanna hear something weird?

676
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,775
Do you know that Dylan
shoots in the nude?

677
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,470
What? That's.,. disgusting.

678
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,616
Well, I mean, not all the time,
just certain situations.

679
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:50,616
Like, if Tatiana's nude,
then he has to be nude.

680
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:54,222
- It makes her feel more comfortable.
- Why is Tatiana naked?

681
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,949
Why is anybody naked?

682
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:59,459
It's to shoot her scars of oppression,
or something,

683
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,564
Oh, please. He's fucking her.

684
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,992
Man, I had a feeling about that.

685
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,570
God, I just didn't want to believe it!

686
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,674
I mean, all those humanitarian awards.

687
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,300
I've got to call Nat. Whoa!

688
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:20,146
Hey, Dune's on Showtime,
directors cut. You want...'?

689
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,147
- Hey.
- Hey, hi.

690
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,753
Sorry, didn't know you... had company.

691
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,083
- No, he's nobody.
- If you're busy...

692
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:29,884
That's my brother, Ned.

693
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,085
- Oh, this is Ned?
- Yeah.

694
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,730
- Ned! Hey!
- Jeremy, Ned. Ned, Jeremy.

695
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,492
- Hey, man, Jeremy. Nice to meet you.
- How's it going? Nice to meet you.

696
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,328
You, too, Jeremy.
I'll watch Dune with you.

697
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,094
- Yeah? Me too.
- I love that movie.

698
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:45,607
"Father, the sleeper has awakened!"

699
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,436
You don't have to throw yourself
at him, Ned.

700
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,838
"Father!"

701
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,503
Hey, by the way, thanks for going
with Miranda to that benefit.

702
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,343
- She always makes me do that shit.
- Oh, hey, man, it's all good.

703
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:58,180
Jeremy Ends it a burden to shave,
but he loves free food.

704
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,084
- That's true.
- I had a great time, actually.

705
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,249
I tell you, that Arabella
she is one cool chick.

706
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,022
She's so pretty and so smart
and funny and strong.

707
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:11,963
My God, after everything she's been
through. All the humiliation with

708
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:15,627
-the South American guy, stabbing...
- Nat, oh, my God. Guess... Wait.

709
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,774
Hey, Miranda, do you have
any toothpaste 1 can borrow?

710
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,876
I'll call you back.
Ned, what did you just say?

711
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:23,034
I said, "Do you have
any toothpaste I can borrow?“

712
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:26,375
No, no, no. Arabella and a stabbing?

713
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,141
What did she tell you?

714
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:30,547
Oh, I don't know. It's kind of private.

715
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,314
- Ned, who just gave you $3007
- You.

716
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:36,049
Yeah. Plus, I feel like you
just wanted to tell us.

717
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:39,161
You were basically just practically
telling us the whole story.

718
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,263
Come on, Ned, spit it out.

719
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,996
Come on, Ned.

720
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:49,002
She was in South America, there was
a stabbing, just give us the rest of it.

721
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,287
- The goat barn?
- Yeah.

722
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:15,591
Ned, why would I want a past lover
living in my backyard?

723
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,755
Billy said that you'd be cool with it.

724
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:21,096
Oh, fuck, man,
I totally forgot to ask her.

725
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:23,535
That's my bad, man, all the way.

726
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:27,633
I understand. Look, you won't
even notice that I'm here.

727
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,779
Ned, I'm so sorry,
it's not gonna happen.

728
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:32,278
Willie Nelson!

729
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,110
Whoa.

730
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:37,617
- Put Willie Nelson back in the house!
- What?

731
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,684
Janet said no.

732
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:43,891
Sorry, man.

733
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,692
- Come on, Willie Nelson.
- You're not gonna let me see him?

734
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,800
You know what, I was hoping
I wouldn't have to say this,

735
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:54,061
but I don't think you've
given me any other choice.

736
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:58,964
How many times did you make me throw
Willie Nelson outside in the cold

737
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,134
because you didn't want
mud tracked in the house, huh?

738
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,873
How many times did you insult him
by telling him he had had breath?

739
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,382
Whoa, man, do you understand
that you come here to this farm,

740
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,987
you put Willie Nelson
in the middle of all your bullshit,

741
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,090
and you traumatize him.
Is that what you want?

742
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:17,658
Why can't you just let him live
with someone who loves him?

743
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,692
Stop with the violence, man!

744
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,430
- You made me raise my voice.
- Sorry.

745
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:25,534
I'm feel really affronted right now,
man, on my own property.

746
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,431
Get your book bag, get out of here.

747
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:30,038
You know what, you know what? Wow.

748
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,839
Seriously, that is just...

749
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:38,344
I mean, come on.

750
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:55,857
She's not even gonna budge unless
there's some son of official action

751
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,900
or something. ls there any kind of
motion, or like injunction or something

752
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,559
that you can file? I mean...

753
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:04,297
I don't know. I don't want
to sound conceited or anything,

754
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:06,032
but I really am the better caregiver.

755
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:11,812
You can sue her, but I'm not gonna let
that hippie bitch put you through that.

756
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,209
You don't think we have a case?

757
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:15,146
I mean, she's splitting hairs
when she says

758
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:17,217
it was her friend Tim
that left him with us.

759
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,379
Look, you have a case,
but you don't need one.

760
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:24,287
That dog is yours and you're gonna go
back there and you're gonna get him.

761
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,155
I don't think I can ask her again, Cin.

762
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:28,058
No, no, no, Ned.

763
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:31,734
We're not gonna ask, we're gonna take.

764
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,733
- We?
- Yeah. Who's the man?

765
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:38,237
- You are?
- Who's the man, Ned?

766
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:40,637
Jesus. Me.

767
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,641
Yes, say it. Who's the man?

768
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,076
- Who's the man?
- No, say it.. "I'm the man."

769
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:47,443
- You're the man. I'm the man.
- You're the man! You're the man!

770
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:49,516
- That's right. I'm the man.
- Say it! Say it!

771
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:50,744
- I'm the man!
- Louder!

772
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:53,411
- I'm the man!
- Yes! Come on.

773
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,951
Pum!

774
00:46:58,082 --> 00:46:59,527
It's a sign.

775
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:10,336
I I gotta run
to keep from hidin'

776
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:15,170
J' And Pm bound
to keep on ridfn'

777
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:20,612
J' And I got one more
silver dollar

778
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,377
J' I ain't gonna let 'em
catch me, no

779
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:24,519
J' I ain't gonna let 'em catch
the midnight rider J'

780
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,813
- Hi.
- Hey.

781
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,400
Hey.

782
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:47,575
Natalie says you haven't
had sex in like a year.

783
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,368
She told you that?

784
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,014
Max and I think you're really cute.

785
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,206
Oh, uh...

786
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:57,650
Thanks.

787
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:59,049
Thanks, Max.

788
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:11,899
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

789
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,614
I'm sorry, I can't... I'm so sorry.

790
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:29,115
I can't do it.

791
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:32,880
I think your erection in my leg
totally threw me.

792
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,956
I'm so sorry, I'm really embarrassed.

793
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:40,687
I'm so... I'm so...

794
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:42,857
I'm sorry.

795
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,030
- I'm such a jerk.
- You're really not a jerk.

796
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:49,637
No, maybe I should've
tried harder or just...

797
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,800
- You know.
- Ned.

798
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:55,535
Dude, just 'cause you're straight
doesn't mean you're homophobic.

799
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,646
I just feel bad, you know?
They seemed pretty into me.

800
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:02,308
Well, they'll get over it. Let's...

801
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,146
- We can look around this place.
- Thank you,

802
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:07,551
- You're welcome.
- Let's try and ind you one woman.

803
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:11,559
- Hm! She seems kind of fun.
- Yeah, sex would be awesome,

804
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,490
but then she'd make you
go to rock shows.

805
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:16,222
- Oh, sweet!
- Really?

806
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:20,460
Sweet? You'd be psyched
to go to some rock club?

807
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,468
See a band called, like, Paint Store...

808
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:25,897
- ...or something?
- Not really.

809
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,906
No, you don't.

810
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,473
What about those ones over there?

811
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,080
Lindsay and her friend,
they're gonna analyze every word

812
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:34,648
of every text you ever send her.

813
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,113
I like the name Lindsay.

814
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,809
But they're both named Lindsay.

815
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:41,479
Look what she's reading, it's like
a novelization of Us Weekly.

816
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,851
Exhausting.

817
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,084
Ooh, look at that one.
Look at that girl.

818
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:46,785
Oh, yeah, that would be great,
if you wanted, you know,

819
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,521
to date your sister!

820
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:51,462
- What's wrong with my sister?
- Nothing's wrong with your sister.

821
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:53,932
Why, you wanna date your sister?
You're a wild man.

822
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:56,594
No, I don't wanna date my sister.
But what about you?

823
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,272
- Me? Date your sister?
- Yeah. Right.

824
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,876
Miranda? What are you talking about?

825
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,273
- Well, it's obvious.
- What's obvious?

826
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,472
That you guys totally love each other.

827
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,448
OK, I love Miranda, but...

828
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:11,450
- I know.
- ...she's bossy.

829
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,714
- Yeah. She is.
- She's a bossy person.

830
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:17,792
She's like, "Jeremy, help me move
everything in my apartment around?

831
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,825
You know, it'll only take two minutes."
And then it's like...

832
00:50:19,984 --> 00:50:21,520
...all day.

833
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,666
I mean, she's great, she's pretty,
she's very pretty,

834
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:28,395
that's undeniable,
but relationship-wise and...

835
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,906
...pardon me, but sexually,
I don't know if I could deal with it.

836
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:36,044
Every man I meet
is either a dick or a loser.

837
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,875
What about Jeremy? He's not a dick.
And he's not a loser, either.

838
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,007
Well, that's debatable,
he doesn't even have health insurance.

839
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,551
Neither do I,
at least I don't think I do.

840
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,885
- Here you go.
- I just want to meet a real man, Ned.

841
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,652
I asked for that side-by-side,
not swirled. Thanks.

842
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:52,816
- Sure.
- Whatever.

843
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,691
I mean you two are obviously
not headed in that direction.

844
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:58,424
He thinks the idea
is as ludicrous as you do.

845
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,195
Hey, man, can I try some acai berry?

846
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,929
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait. I'm sorry, what?

847
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,166
- Why is that?
-I don't know, I don't know.

848
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:09,607
What he said, it didn't make any sense.

849
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:12,338
Why are we even talking about this?
Tell me what he said, Ned.

850
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,013
He said you can be a tad bossy.

851
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:21,013
And you're not really his type,
physically. That was it, but...

852
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,749
- Wait, what?
- Hey, man, how's pomegranate?

853
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,360
- It's terrific.
- Why, because I'm not 14?

854
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:28,121
How's that?

855
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,060
Ned, tell me exactly what he said.

856
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,200
- God, do I have to?
- Yes.

857
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:57,085
Fuck.

858
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:06,424
- So, where's Dylan today?
- He had to work.

859
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:11,764
He's been so edgy and... distant.

860
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,418
Liz?

861
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,415
Yeah?

862
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:28,418
I think Dylan's having an affair.

863
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:31,348
What?

864
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,760
- What are you talking about?
- Ned told me.

865
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,263
Oh, yeah, GK, Ned.

866
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:39,992
Let's face it, I mean...

867
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,036
OK, Ned told me the facts.
I had to put it together.

868
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:47,607
He said that Dylan
was spending a lot of private time...

869
00:52:48,432 --> 00:52:51,038
,..with the woman in his film, Tatiana.

870
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,709
- Tatiana, she's...
- Naked.

871
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,452
Maybe it was some, like,
dance experiment or...

872
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:03,216
Liz...

873
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:12,491
- Do popcorn, Uncle Ned.
- In a minute, buddy.

874
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,636
You sure she's gonna be at that concert?

875
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:17,966
Yeah, she hasn't missed
a Dixie Chicks show in... ten years.

876
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,699
And you're sure that she's
gonna leave Willie Nelson behind?

877
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,674
According to Billy, she hasn't
taken him on an outing in months.

878
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:26,041
- Poor guy.
- She's such a dick.

879
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,046
- Come on, Uncle Ned.
- All right, Riv, let's go.

880
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,309
On your back.

881
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,884
Ah!

882
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,047
Yeah!

883
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:39,724
Yeah, baby!

884
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,888
His whole "I'm saving the
world" thing, it was bullshit, right?

885
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,591
- We always knew it. Fuck him.
- Yeah, fuck him.

886
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:48,828
And his tittle Russian
ballerina bitch.

887
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:52,371
This is the man I built my life with,
what do you expect?

888
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,510
That I just... throw it all away
or something?

889
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,907
- No. I don't know.
- Maybe.

890
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,547
Damn Ned!

891
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:02,948
- I never should have let him stay.
- This is not Ned's fault.

892
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:05,018
Everything was going fine
until he arrived.

893
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,918
- How is this Ned's fault?
- A family is a very precarious thing.

894
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,685
You guys will see
when you get it together.

895
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:17,028
OK, Liz, look.

896
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:18,689
Don't take this the wrong way,

897
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:22,531
because Dylan is totally
the asshole in this situation for sure.

898
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:25,299
- He's a douchebag.
- I hate his guts. But...

899
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,442
...is it possible that...

900
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:30,809
...you know, maybe he
thought you gave up?

901
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,380
Gave up on what?

902
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:36,249
You're, you know, this whole...

903
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:41,720
You used to be so hot, Liz. I remember
all my friends lusting after you.

904
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:44,052
- They thought you were awesome.
- Yes! You had the great boobs,

905
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,558
- and you were always tall and...
- You're still tall.

906
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:50,221
- Yeah.
- Well, what's wrong with me now?

907
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,234
Well, come on...

908
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:57,099
Liz, I mean, look. I don't know.
What's going on with your hair here?

909
00:54:57,261 --> 00:54:59,571
It's like a science experiment
back there.

910
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:03,601
And I know you own contacts.
You're wearing plastic shoes,

911
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,940
and what is this shirt even made of?

912
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:09,816
- It's flax.
- See? I mean, isn't that a food?

913
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,453
- You're wearing food.
- What are you saying?

914
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:15,488
- If only I looked more like you?
- What? No.

915
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:21,096
Got my hair styled every day and wore
absurd heels that no one can walk in,

916
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:24,095
that maybe my husband wouldn't
be screwing around on me-'?!

917
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,962
I'm just trying to help!
OK, Liz? That's all!

918
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:29,195
I hardly think you're in a position
to give man advice!

919
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,600
Jesus Christ, you guys,
all Miranda's saying is just,

920
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,003
like, maybe it would be cool
if you just, like,

921
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,768
looked semi-fuckable once in a while.

922
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,810
- Thank you!
- Oh, God!

923
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:40,107
I mean, how long has it been
since you've had sex?

924
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,547
I don't know! Echo's Eve months,
so, you know...

925
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,516
- Plus nine, it's like...
- What?!

926
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,451
- Plus nine?!
- Are you kidding me?

927
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:51,491
That's, like, over a year!
How can people live like that? That's...

928
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,286
I am different from you.

929
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,624
I have other things to do than
worry about getting my rocks off.

930
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,495
What is that supposed to mean?
You think I'm sleeping around?

931
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,795
- I'm not sleeping around!
- Nobody thinks that.

932
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:03,905
- I didn't say that.
- I love Cindy.

933
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:07,372
- This isn't about you, Nat!
- It's just seduction is your thing,

934
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,068
- your means to self-esteem.
- Ohh!

935
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:12,475
- I don't care!
- Screw you and screw you!

936
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:15,515
What did I do? Nat!
What is up your ass?!

937
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,220
Babe, you OK?

938
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:25,056
- You're all sweaty.
- Babe.

939
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:29,323
They just dump everything on it,
sprinkles and like Oreos.

940
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:34,026
- What about sunflower seeds?
- They're actually good.

941
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,329
- They're good?
- Yeah.

942
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:36,493
- What about...
- River, come on.

943
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,832
Sweetie, come on.

944
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:40,407
Come on, it's time to go, come on.

945
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:41,907
Come on.

946
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,204
- See ya, buddy.
- See ya.

947
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,877
Hey, Riv, check it out.

948
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:52,175
Grow the hell up, Ned.

949
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:07,059
Hey, read it last night.
Quite the story.

950
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:10,361
PR thinks it's gonna get you
on a bunch of talk shows.

951
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,539
Oh, now you're Mn Moral High Ground?

952
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:16,803
No, I didn't say anything.

953
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:21,109
I love my brother, but let's be honest,
he doesn't live in the adult world.

954
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,083
Oh, but your story's adult
with all the gory details

955
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:28,951
- and bitching aside?
- Sometimes in the adult world

956
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,956
we have to do things that,
you know, we're not very pro...

957
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,220
Let's just drop it,
because you wouldn't understand.

958
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,887
I wouldn't understand?
Why wouldn't I understand?

959
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:39,000
Why, because I'm an unpublished
sci-fi writer?

960
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:42,467
- What? Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, no, that's not it. That's not it.

961
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:46,005
It's because I don't have health
insurance. That's what it was.

962
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:49,667
- Did Ned...? I'm gonna murder him.
- I don't know how I found that out.

963
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,575
- He's...
- Are you helping at all?

964
00:57:52,736 --> 00:57:54,738
- I'm guiding it.
- You're guiding it?

965
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:58,182
- Someone has to guide...
- Let go. You weren't doing anything.

966
00:57:58,342 --> 00:58:01,186
- That's what he said?
- Hey, Ned!

967
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:04,519
Really? You had to go and tell Jeremy
about that little stupid thing l said

968
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:07,321
about the health insurance?
Why are you such a blabbermouth?

969
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,431
Is that my brush? Ew!
What are you doing?

970
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:11,793
I don't wanna know.

971
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,093
Uh...

972
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:16,965
I'm surprised that you even asked
my opinion on your work,

973
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:20,597
since," Wait, I'm not even a grown-up?
Is that what it was?

974
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:22,334
Ned! That...

975
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,207
OK, what you don't understand
is that my brother is a retard.

976
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:26,439
- Oh, OK.
- That's true,

977
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:27,707
See? Thank you.

978
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:31,114
No, I mean, she didn't say that at all.

979
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,276
What she was that
you're not like a real man.

980
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,213
- Ned! Wait!
- That's much better.

981
00:58:35,379 --> 00:58:37,620
- No...
- That's great. Thank you, Miranda.

982
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:40,455
Oh, no, no, no, no! This is just...

983
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:42,688
This is just a breakdown
of communication.

984
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,527
- Obviously. Really nice, Miranda.
- Don't try to make me feel bad

985
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:49,398
about any of this when, according
to you, I'm... What was it, Ned?

986
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:52,130
- ...hideously ugly.
- What?

987
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:53,740
- Yeah.
- I didn't say that.

988
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,740
Miranda, I would never
say that about you.

989
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:59,073
- He so didn't say that about you.
- Thank you, tell her I didn't say that.

990
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:02,547
He said your personality gets in the way
of your looks, your very good looks.

991
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:05,380
Dude... do you have Tourettes?

992
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,647
- What the fuck?
- Wow.

993
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,313
This is much worse
than I thought it was.

994
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,982
- I didn't say that.
- I don't even know why I care.

995
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:14,993
Because the idea of the two of you
sitting around, talking about girls,

996
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:17,257
is so pathetic, it's almost funny.

997
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:18,764
It's almost funny?

998
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,367
I don't see you laughing right now.

999
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:23,004
It doesn't seem like
you think it's funny at all.

1000
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:27,073
OK, um, he-re's your story.

1001
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,677
Thank you for letting me read
your wonderful article.

1002
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:33,509
Hope you sleep well. Ned, you might
wanna take a look at that.

1003
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,546
- See you later.
- Jer.

1004
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:39,882
Give me that, Ned!

1005
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:45,850
Keep your mouth shut, Ned,
just keep it shut!

1006
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:47,689
- Sorry.
- He's like my best friend.

1007
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:49,956
- Thanks a lot!
- I'm sorry.

1008
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,727
This is like in prison
when I told Bob about Jose.

1009
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,795
I'm pretty sure it's nothing like that.

1010
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,534
I mean, is there anything
more bothersome than a mom cliche?

1011
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,700
Mom's heart is in the right place.

1012
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:05,039
Mom means well.

1013
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:09,708
Or, the crowning glory
of terrible mom clichés...

1014
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,554
I mean...

1015
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:16,717
Um...

1016
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:20,128
I'm gonna be...

1017
01:00:22,586 --> 01:00:24,156
,..right back.

1018
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,470
What?

1019
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,441
Nat, are you all right?

1020
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:42,974
Are you sick?

1021
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,916
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

1022
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:56,155
Oh, my God, that...!
Congratulations, man!

1023
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,458
That's so awesome for you guys.

1024
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:01,194
God, what do I fucking do?

1025
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,767
Well... this sounds weird,

1026
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:07,101
but do you think you're not as much
of a lesbian as you thought?

1027
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:12,009
No! No, it was just a thing.
God, I fucking love Cindy.

1028
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:15,147
You know." just tell her the truth.

1029
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,445
She loves you.
Maybe she'll be psyched to have a kid.

1030
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,315
What? Yeah,
she's gonna be really psyched.

1031
01:01:20,477 --> 01:01:24,050
She's gonna come with me to pick out
a fucking changing table. Come on!

1032
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:27,457
I cheated on her, I got pregnant,
she should be pissed.

1033
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,392
I don't wanna fuck it up with her, Ned.

1034
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:31,294
If she loves you, she'll forgive you.

1035
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:34,998
I can't have this child.

1036
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:40,703
- Holy shit, I've destroyed my life.

1037
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,811
- You're having an affair, aren't you?

1038
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:50,975
- With Tatiana.
- With Tatiana, are you crazy?

1039
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,587
Who gave you that idea?

1040
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:57,523
- Your ludicrous brother?
- What does it matter?

1041
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,325
Apparently, you're shooting
the movie naked.

1042
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:04,158
- What?
- Even the way you say her name.

1043
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:06,733
Tatiana.

1044
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,496
You know, you have
this amazing talent

1045
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,605
for making me feel
like a second-class citizen.

1046
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:17,244
- What do you mean?
- I mean, in your own meek, mousy way

1047
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,371
you have this brilliant knack
of getting your own way.

1048
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:24,915
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1049
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,091
Wait, what does this
have to do with you and Tatiana?

1050
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,887
I never wanted him here,
but you insisted that he stay,

1051
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:36,792
even making me feel like a criminal for
suggesting that he stay somewhere else.

1052
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:41,129
This is bullshit, Dylan.
You're completely evading the issue!

1053
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,805
It's not a trick question.
Are you or aren't you sleeping with her?

1054
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:59,379
What are you doing?

1055
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:02,887
I'm leaving this house
before you make me lose my temper

1056
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:04,787
in front of my children.

1057
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,633
You couldn't wear pants, Ned?

1058
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,469
OK, I took the liberty
of writing up a checklist,

1059
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,838
if you could read it over carefully,
please,

1060
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,274
That's just the checklist, Ned.

1061
01:03:30,073 --> 01:03:33,145
Wait, you put all
of this in your article?

1062
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,586
- That stuff was private.
- Well...

1063
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,622
Did she ever say it was off the record?

1064
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:40,694
Why would she say it was off the record,
we were just having a conversation.

1065
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:44,798
Ned, come on, she knew
you and I were a team.

1066
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,527
She called us a team
the first time that we met.

1067
01:03:47,691 --> 01:03:49,261
Yeah, and then you said
we weren't a team.

1068
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:51,099
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

1069
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:53,867
I remember precisely,
'cause I thought it was pretty mean.

1070
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,135
I dropped everything
to drive you around that day.

1071
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:58,279
All the documentary guys
were going for dim sum.

1072
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:01,473
You know what?
The important thing at this point

1073
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:04,949
is whether this information is true.

1074
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:06,985
It's all we need to know, Ned.

1075
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,781
Is this true?

1076
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,953
I'm gonna bring Darren in on this.

1077
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:21,063
Fuck. Fuckity-fuck, Ned,
she's getting a lawyer.

1078
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,727
How could you do this to a person?
That's so messed up.

1079
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:28,706
How can you do this to me?
Just say "Yes, this happened.“

1080
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:32,142
You're not even lying or anything.
It is true, so just...

1081
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:36,478
Fuck. Look, Ned, I am begging you.
Don't fucking do this to me, please?

1082
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,880
Come on, All right, here they come.

1083
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,419
Hi, Darren, how are you?

1084
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:45,549
Ah. I'm not happy at the way this
story's been put together, Miranda.

1085
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,921
I'm not either.

1086
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,586
You'll have to vouch for the veracity
of the story yourself, Ned.

1087
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:52,324
- Like right now?
- That's right. Right now.

1088
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:54,093
I need to hear it.

1089
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,676
- Hey, Miranda.
- Hey, Ted.

1090
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:19,722
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Ahh!

1091
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,423
- You could n't just fucking say yes?
- Sorry.

1092
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,565
How could you do that to me, Ned?

1093
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,960
Miranda's such a bitch
sometimes,

1094
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:32,129
I feel kind of bad,
it was a big opportunity for her.

1095
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,798
For what?
Selling her soul for a story?

1096
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:37,376
There was just
a breakdown of communication.

1097
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:38,945
Whatever.

1098
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:42,948
Looks like you found a use for
your mom's post 9/11 escape raft.

1099
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,710
It's cool. Sleep well, bud.

1100
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:50,213
- Tomorrow, Operation Free Willie.
- Right on.

1101
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,054
Have a good night.

1102
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:54,718
If you get cold,
there are coats up in the...

1103
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,830
- Oh, OK,
- Oh, and if you need to pee?

1104
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,626
There's a kitty litter box right here.

1105
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:02,000
Nat.

1106
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:06,167
- How's it going?
- Oh. Great.

1107
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,071
- Yeah? - Yeah.
Thanks so much for your advice.

1108
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:11,906
- Oh, my God. For sure. No.
- That was awesome.

1109
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:15,515
I mean, she's being exceptionally cool.

1110
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:19,577
She is exceptionally cool.

1111
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:22,848
- Nat, where are my ear plugs?
- Night, Ned.

1112
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,854
Night, Nan

1113
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,629
J' I had a dog

1114
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:31,766
J' And his name was Blue

1115
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:34,424
J' I'll tell you what

1116
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:37,936
J' Ol' Blue would do

1117
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,165
J' Yeah, Blue

1118
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,004
J' Yeah, Blue
Yeah, Blue

1119
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,938
J' He'd go out

1120
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:50,107
J' Every night about dark

1121
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:52,947
J' And it wouldn't be long

1122
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,214
J' 'Til you'd hear him bark

1123
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,019
J' Yeah, Blue

1124
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,321
J' Yeah, Blue
Yeah, Blue I

1125
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,975
No way, they're home!

1126
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,976
Jesus, what do we do?

1127
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,410
We go get Willie Nelson.

1128
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:26,147
Are you mad about
the rooster thing?

1129
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:28,482
Well, a little bit mad
about the fucking rooster.

1130
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:30,682
Well, I'm telling you,
he's depressed.

1131
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:34,488
And I'm telling you, there's no fucking
way a rooster is depressed, Billy,

1132
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:38,724
When animals are depressed, man,
they, like, sleep more,

1133
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,390
Sorry, didn't mean to touch
your boob.

1134
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:44,437
Humans do it, roosters do it,
then they don't crow in the morning.

1135
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:46,232
- That's why I overslept.
- I'm so psyched

1136
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:50,572
- you and Nat weathered that storm.
- Yeah, we're good. We're good.

1137
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:54,010
And to power through infidelity,
man, you can do that,

1138
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,843
you can do anything.

1139
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:57,507
Oh, come on!

1140
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,857
Locked? She locked it?

1141
01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:06,618
Hold on. Right here.

1142
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,604
Come in.

1143
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:24,205
Hey, you know, that Christian, he's kind
of lame, but he's really handsome.

1144
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:27,041
So there's a good chance your baby
is going to be very striking.

1145
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,774
Oh!

1146
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:33,611
Buddy!

1147
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,619
I missed you so much!

1148
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,782
Hey, Nat. Oh, no,
I'm just with your brother

1149
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:42,054
and he just told me some real
interesting news.

1150
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:43,219
- No!
- Nothing,

1151
01:08:43,386 --> 01:08:45,229
just that you're apparently pregnant

1152
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:49,427
with the spawn
of that fucking cult-y fuck fuck!

1153
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:53,239
Yeah, sure. She wants to talk to you.

1154
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:55,069
No, no.

1155
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:58,572
- Hello?
- Oh, shoot.

1156
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:02,308
- Hey, Nat. Now's not a great time.
- Who's here?

1157
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:03,678
Janet, hey, what's up?

1158
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:07,247
- Can I call you back?
- Jesus Christ.

1159
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:10,016
- Yeah, it's me!
- What's going on, how's it going?

1160
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:13,592
- You don't sound very sorry!
- You thought you'd come and take him?

1161
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,196
- Who the fuck is this?
- You're gonna blame Ned?

1162
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:18,491
That's your tactic?

1163
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:21,966
OK, I really didn't want to get
litigious, but I brought a lawyer.

1164
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:26,471
I am sorry I don't have a fat,
throbbing cock for you!

1165
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:28,540
That's some Ivy League
shit out there, man.

1166
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:30,371
- Really?
- Cindy!

1167
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:34,504
You wouldn't, would you, Nat? 'Cause
you're fucking selfish, that's why.

1168
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,117
No, no, no! I wanna
talk about this now, damn it!

1169
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:39,810
- I need your help, Cindy. Could you...?
- Really? An accident?!

1170
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:42,479
An accident is when you
fall off your fucking bike!

1171
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:45,125
- Not when you fuck somebody!
- Hey, Ned. What's up, man?

1172
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,791
- Hey, man.
- Caught the master criminal here

1173
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,124
trying to steal Willie Nelson.

1174
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:54,291
What happened
to the Dixie Chicks show?

1175
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:58,405
The Dixie Chicks? That's next Thursday.

1176
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:00,370
- Right, Janet?
- Yeah.

1177
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,874
- Next Thursday.
- When I talked to you last week,

1178
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:07,310
- you said it was next Thursday.
- Oh. It is. Next Thursday.

1179
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,916
Yeah, but when I talked to you a week
ago, you said "Next Thursday."

1180
01:10:10,073 --> 01:10:11,245
I'm thinking, today.

1181
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,819
So it's better for you
if I say "Next, next Thursday"?

1182
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:16,718
It's not better now, I thought you were
gonna be at the Dixie Chicks concert.

1183
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:21,328
Yeah, but just for future reference,
like for concerts in the future.

1184
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:23,327
What, are you guys fucking?

1185
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:26,763
Oh, God! Cindy! Cindy!

1186
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:32,363
Oh! Dude! Man, there goes my ride.

1187
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:35,941
That's OK, I can give you a lift.
Or no, I can't.

1188
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,939
This can't be happening.

1189
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,349
I never should have let Ned stay here.

1190
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:47,078
What about what Ned did to me?

1191
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:51,191
I take him to work, he hangs me
out to dry in front of everyone.

1192
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:54,191
Hang on,
I'm getting call waiting. Hello?

1193
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,888
Our idiot brother
just ruined my fucking life.

1194
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:02,526
You know you'll always
have a place here with me.

1195
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:04,569
Thanks, Mom.

1196
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:07,367
I thought the girls
wouldn't want you hanging around,

1197
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:11,307
they've got too much stuff going on
to bother with people like us,

1198
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,881
All right then, that's it.

1199
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,077
I will see you in three weeks.

1200
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,816
Hey, you know,
I've been meaning to tell you.

1201
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,290
You're doing
a really good thing here, Omar.

1202
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:30,556
Seriously. You talk to us screw-ups,

1203
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,326
you give us a reason
for getting out of bed in the morning.

1204
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,801
Thanks, man.

1205
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,962
So you get out of bed again
in another three weeks, OK?

1206
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,631
- I'll do it.
- I appreciate the compliment.

1207
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,472
It's rare that we get love
from the clients.

1208
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,580
Well, you're a good dude.

1209
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:50,115
And I just needed this appointment
today, I'm having a tough go of it.

1210
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:55,484
I swear, I try and do good,
but I just screw it up.

1211
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:59,183
Man, I screwed it up with my sisters,
I'm back living with my mom.

1212
01:11:59,749 --> 01:12:02,753
On top of it all, I broke down
and smoked a joint

1213
01:12:02,919 --> 01:12:04,421
with the kid that lives
across the street.

1214
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:05,998
OK, I didn't just hear that.

1215
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,602
I said I broke down and smoked a joint
with the kid who lives across...

1216
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:12,205
What are you doing?
Hey! Ned, why are you telling me this?

1217
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:15,467
I just need to unload, man.
That's part of why I'm here, right?

1218
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:20,011
I'm not your therapist, Ned. You don't
tell your parole officer you got high.

1219
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,446
Now I have to report you
or else I could lose my job.

1220
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:29,789
Seriously? Can you forget I said that?

1221
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:34,460
- No, Ned, I can't.
- Oh, fuck.

1222
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,557
You OK?

1223
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:43,969
It's an ulcer, I'm telling you.

1224
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,799
Too many late nights.

1225
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:48,033
Did you call Dr. Silverman?

1226
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,972
I will.

1227
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:54,478
Oh, yeah,
it's my fault you're throwing up.

1228
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:57,650
- Who's ready for charades?
- Me!

1229
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:00,651
Mom, nobody's in the mood.

1230
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:02,847
Great, go and get the
pens and paper.

1231
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:05,523
Television show.

1232
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:07,092
Three words.

1233
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,194
Gimme A Break.

1234
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,092
- That was quick.
- I put it in.

1235
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:16,762
All right, guys.

1236
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,040
River, this one-'s for you.

1237
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,669
All right, River, come on!
Here we go!

1238
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,845
Wizard of Oz.

1239
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:32,748
- Yeah.
- Well done, sweetie.

1240
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:36,217
I guess it's me.

1241
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,694
OK, it's a movie.

1242
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,096
Space?

1243
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,960
Space, space, Star Wars!

1244
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:48,568
- Space." No.
- Space Frogs!

1245
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,367
- Crazy Hands!
- Good, Crazy Hands?

1246
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:54,098
Crazy Heart.
"Crazy Little Thing Called Love.“

1247
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,039
- Uncle Ned!
- Me. Ned, Ned. Nedly, Nedrick.

1248
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,305
- Me, me, Ned!
- Why aren't you guys guessing?

1249
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,540
- The Jerk?
- Har har.

1250
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:04,548
- OK, guys, come on, guys.
- Jackass.

1251
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:06,709
You wanna get in on this
party, Liz?

1252
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:09,379
The Man Who Just Ruined My Marriage.

1253
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,154
Don't forget Lassie.
'Cause you miss your doggie.

1254
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:14,386
Ha ha ha ha.

1255
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:18,396
- Can you please just play the game?
- We are playing.

1256
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,124
No, you're not playing,
you're not at all.

1257
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:21,233
- We are.
- No, you're not.

1258
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,267
- Yeah, we're kind of playing.
- You're kind of not playing.

1259
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:26,737
- Those were great guesses, I thought.
- When you put your own clue in,

1260
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:28,307
you're not allowed to guess.
You know that.

1261
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,910
- I bent the rules.
- You didn't bend the rules.

1262
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:35,345
You broke them and that just
ruins it for everyone, all right?

1263
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:36,949
I know you've got a really
important life, Miranda,

1264
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:41,418
but some of us like to sit around, enjoy
our family, and play a game of charades.

1265
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,921
What's so funny, Nat?
By the way, when a kid goes,

1266
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:48,824
you should at least give him
the opportunity to act out his hint.

1267
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,591
All right? Before you jump in
with the answer, even if you know it.

1268
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:55,099
It's the same stupid clue
Mom always puts in for River.

1269
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,932
So what? You're so cool,
you're just too bored, is that it?!

1270
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:01,769
For God's sake, Ned, we have
other things on our mind,

1271
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:03,274
So you make it miserable for everybody?

1272
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:06,436
- OK, Ned, we're gonna play.
- Let's get serious, girls.

1273
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:07,945
Just play the fucking game!

1274
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:14,547
Goddamn it, I just want
to sit around with my family

1275
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,553
and play a fucking game of charades!

1276
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:29,565
I just wanna sit
and I just wanna play the game.

1277
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,466
I wanna play charades,
what's the big deal about that?

1278
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:33,664
Why can't you all just play?

1279
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,310
Sorry, Riv.

1280
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,981
- Hello, Mrs. Rochlin?
- Yes.

1281
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:51,385
Officer Omar Coleman. Is your son home?

1282
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,494
He was just frustrated, officer.

1283
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,324
He gets very excited
playing parlor games.

1284
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,193
It's under control now.

1285
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:00,993
- Oh, my God.
- Omar.

1286
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:06,563
Mr. Rochlin, sir,
I suggest you step outside.

1287
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:09,367
What's going on?

1288
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,549
- Nedrick Rochlin?
- Yeah.

1289
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:19,619
- You made bail.
- Really? Who?

1290
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:25,018
Miranda Rochlin. Just sign here,
we'll process you out.

1291
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,863
- No, I'm good.
- What?

1292
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:37,868
No, thanks. I'm gonna stay here, man.

1293
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:39,370
Thank you.

1294
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:46,741
Look, there's nothing I can do.
He refused to sign.

1295
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:49,542
- This is classic Ned.
- Officer, I'm his mother.

1296
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,879
Just bring him out here.
He probably doesn't understand the form.

1297
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:54,578
That's not how we do it, ma'am.

1298
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:58,425
- Can I speak to your supervisor?
- No.

1299
01:16:58,881 --> 01:17:01,885
Mom, if he doesn't want to be
released to us, we can't force him.

1300
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:05,999
Excuse me, sir, would it be possible
for my son to see him?

1301
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:10,893
I know you're really mad at my mom
and Aunt Natalie and Aunt Miranda.

1302
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,563
But they all feel really sorry, I swear.

1303
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:18,734
River, I want you to go tell your mom
and your aunts something for me, OK?

1304
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:20,141
Sure, Uncle Ned.

1305
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:23,407
- Go fuck yourselves.
- River!

1306
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,745
That's what he said.

1307
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:38,087
Hey guys, I know how to get Uncle Ned
to leave prison.

1308
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,392
Well, hello.

1309
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:11,454
- Hi.
- The Rochlin girls.

1310
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:15,692
This is a pleasant
and unexpected surprise.

1311
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:19,305
- The farm looks beautiful, Janet.
- Oh, thanks, Liz.

1312
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:22,999
So, what brings you all up here?

1313
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:24,400
Um...

1314
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,641
We were practically family, Janet.

1315
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:32,718
And we thought... um...

1316
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:36,387
...it would be good
to get some closure, you know?

1317
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,320
Yeah, that and we came for Ned's dog.

1318
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,189
So he roped
the whole family in, huh?

1319
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:46,162
Well, forget it.
Willie Nelson isn't leaving.

1320
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,167
It's what's best for him.

1321
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:52,033
Janet, Ned needs
Willie Nelson's company right now.

1322
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:55,338
- Emotionally...
- Look,

1323
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:58,501
I'm not giving that
irresponsible man-child my dog.

1324
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,442
Come on, Janet, it's just a dog.

1325
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:03,015
Uh... to you, maybe, Natalie.

1326
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:05,174
To me, Willie Nelson
is a dear, dear friend.

1327
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:07,844
- That is a load of crap, Janet.
- I love that dog!

1328
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:11,924
Nobody loves that dog
the way Ned loves that dog.

1329
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:16,791
Nobody loves anything
as unconditionally as Ned loves.

1330
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,964
He's in jail, Janet.

1331
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,695
- Oh, my God.
- He needs our help.

1332
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,305
That was fast.
What did he do this time?

1333
01:19:26,462 --> 01:19:30,433
He didn't do shit.
We put him there, all of us.

1334
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,044
Including you, Janet.

1335
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:35,045
I am not gonna stand here
and be insulted on my own porch.

1336
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:38,981
- I'll insult you right here.
- I'm a pacifist. I don't play that way.

1337
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,644
I'm gonna peace you in the side of
the head if you don't give us the dog.

1338
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:44,484
I'm not gonna receive that
with anything but love.

1339
01:19:45,047 --> 01:19:46,754
We are not leaving.

1340
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,130
OK, I love that tactic.

1341
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:57,161
Billy, get me the phone.

1342
01:19:59,495 --> 01:20:03,170
Janny, where's the dog bowl
that he loves so much?

1343
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:05,608
- Billy, what are you doing?
- Let's go. Come on.

1344
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:09,147
- What are you doing?
- Hey, it's his dog, man.

1345
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:13,185
Billy, put the dog in the house.
Put the dog in the house, Billy!

1346
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:15,982
Ilene, you can't take this dog!
This is his home!

1347
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:18,921
Go back to your fruits
and vegetables, honey.

1348
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:20,924
William! Billy!

1349
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:23,586
What the fuck are you doing?
Get the dog!

1350
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:27,461
Hey, easy language, man.

1351
01:20:27,623 --> 01:20:30,297
- Tell Ned we said, "Hey."
- Thanks, Billy.

1352
01:20:40,102 --> 01:20:42,275
Willie! Willie!

1353
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:44,475
Oh, thank God, Willie Nelson!

1354
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,620
Yeah, buddy! Willie!

1355
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,618
Yeah! Hey, buddy!

1356
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:51,690
J' When you're hot and you're
cold, not always easy to hold

1357
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,123
J' And you?e hard to impress

1358
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:56,524
J' Sounds funny
But you might be the best

1359
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,789
Want some?

1360
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:01,526
- I Thing that I have
- Not the whole thing!

1361
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,796
J' 'Cause whenever you've gone
and Fm left ah' alone

1362
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,372
J' Well, the world
seems worse

1363
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,510
J' No, I didn't really
like you at first

1364
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,976
J' I was wrong about that

1365
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:17,143
J' So wherever I go

1366
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:19,684
J' I'm taking you with me

1367
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:23,555
J' Wherever I go

1368
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,250
J' You're coming along

1369
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,420
Hey, Jeremy. Uh, is it...

1370
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,231
,..crazy to think we...

1371
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:39,939
J' That's where you belong

1372
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:43,076
I know you're not
gonna call me back, but, um...

1373
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:46,242
One more thing...

1374
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:49,508
Remember the time
I missed your awards dinner?

1375
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:53,617
Well, I wasn't really working.

1376
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:57,189
I was at home watching
Kourtney and Kim Take New York.

1377
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:59,417
I'm sorry. Um.,. what else?

1378
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:02,528
J' So wherever I go

1379
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:05,790
J' I'm taking you with me

1380
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:08,901
J' Wherever I go

1381
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:12,300
J' You're coming along

1382
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:15,305
J' You're in my heart I

1383
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:17,375
- Ah!
- Oh!

1384
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:20,872
Jeremy and I were talking,

1385
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:23,448
he has a friend who's also
going through a divorce.

1386
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,211
And he works in Poverty at the UN.

1387
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:28,379
He's really nice and really funny.

1388
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:31,217
He does pottery at the UN?

1389
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:35,954
I mean, if he's a friend of Jeremy's,
then I guess I could give it a go.

1390
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:37,597
- Right?
- What's his name?

1391
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:41,059
Roger... Maybe Roger.

1392
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:43,566
What?

1393
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:46,899
Um... That was Cindy.

1394
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:49,770
She wants to come with me tomorrow
to the OB/GYN.

1395
01:22:49,932 --> 01:22:51,809
Oh!

1396
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,469
We're getting Cindy.

1397
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,410
That's great, Nat.

1398
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:57,847
Maybe going all "Honest Ned"
on her worked.

1399
01:22:58,507 --> 01:23:00,578
- You don't have to thank me, It's OK.
- Thank you, Ned.

1400
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:03,416
You're gonna be the best uncle.

1401
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:05,923
- That's sweet.
- Aw, he is the best uncle.

1402
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:09,528
I can't wait. You better come visit me.

1403
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:13,757
- Come visit where?
- What do you mean?

1404
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:20,105
I've been wanting to tell you guys.
I think it's time for me to move on.

1405
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:24,368
- No.
- Move on? Move on where?

1406
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:27,438
No. I mean...

1407
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:30,777
You know we just love having you
in our house. Don't you know that?

1408
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:32,680
Oh, I do know that, and I love you too.

1409
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:36,687
But the city's no place
for Willie Nelson or for me.

1410
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:39,121
I feel like I'm gonna cry.

1411
01:23:39,281 --> 01:23:42,125
You guys are gonna be great.
My work here is done.

1412
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:44,890
Who's gonna watch sci-11 with Jeremy?
I can't always do it.

1413
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:47,556
- Who's gonna babysit my kid for free?
- Yeah, who?

1414
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:59,208
They're brand new,
I just made them yesterday.

1415
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,871
So you're getting some really
fresh candles. All right.

1416
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,643
Have a great Shabbos with those.
Thanks a lot.

1417
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:10,986
Anyway, what I was saying though,
is people recycle cans,

1418
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:14,491
they recycle papers, why not candles?

1419
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,994
I say we put a bin out and let people
bring back their old drippings

1420
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:20,031
- at their convenience.
- it's like those bags that say

1421
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:21,861
"l used to be a plastic bottle."

1422
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:24,904
We could have a bin that said:
"I used to be another candle."

1423
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,768
That's a great idea.
And when they bring in those candles,

1424
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:30,740
we'll put them in another bin that says:
"l used to be another another candle."

1425
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,879
Yeah, eventually we could
just have one that said:

1426
01:24:33,035 --> 01:24:34,776
"Trust me,
I used to be a lot of candles."

1427
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:36,109
"I've been a lot of candles."

1428
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:38,251
"Trust me, man,
I've been other candles."

1429
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,846
Hey, can I get your
honest opinion on something?

1430
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,182
- Sure.
- OK.

1431
01:24:43,779 --> 01:24:45,190
- Be honest with me.
- Of course.

1432
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:48,188
Do you think this is an ugly candle?

1433
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:51,695
No way, man. There's no such thing
as an ugly homemade candle.

1434
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:53,196
- Really?
- Yeah,

1435
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,027
- Good.
- You know what?

1436
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:58,399
We should send, like, just a bunch
of candles to Janet as a thank you.

1437
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,568
Totally. To thank her
for introducing us and everything?

1438
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:04,938
Isn't it funny how life works?

1439
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,912
I love it. Just a couple of guys
and a dog, making candles,

1440
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:11,083
What a cliché.

1441
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:14,785
Hey, Willie.

1442
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,390
Willie Nelson.

1443
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,324
Hey, man, have you seen Willie Nelson?

1444
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,396
- Oh, yeah, definitely.
- When?

1445
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:29,229
Oh, you mean recently? No. I just meant
in general, I have seen him.

1446
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:33,429
Willie Nelson?

1447
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:35,734
Willie?

1448
01:25:37,733 --> 01:25:39,269
Willie Nelson!

1449
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:42,671
Willie?

1450
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:46,244
Willie Nelson!

1451
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:49,115
Willie Nelson!

1452
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:51,586
Willie Nelson!

1453
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:56,161
Oh, God! Willie Nelson.

1454
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:58,924
Oh, buddy. Willie.

1455
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:01,260
Hi, hi.

1456
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:05,363
- Hi, guys. You scared me to death.
- Dolly?

1457
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:07,438
- Oh, yeah.
- Dolly?

1458
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:09,473
Dolly!

1459
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:12,605
Hey, come here.

1460
01:26:12,768 --> 01:26:14,304
What are you doing?

1461
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:17,177
Hi. Where did you go?

1462
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:20,115
- He ran off, scared me to death.
- So did she.

1463
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:21,948
- Sorry about that?
- Why do you do that, guys?

1464
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,353
I panicked, man. Oh, my God,
I was running all through town

1465
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:27,551
- yelling, like...
- I was in the woods.

1466
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:30,697
- I had no idea where she had gone.
- She's a cutie, my God.

1467
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,890
Thank you.
Yes, isn't that right, Dolly Parton?

1468
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:39,134
- Gorgeous girl.
- Your dog's name is Dolly Parton?

1469
01:26:39,828 --> 01:26:44,573
Yeah, I know, stupid, but...
I love Dolly Parton, so...

1470
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:46,407
What's his name?

1471
01:26:47,803 --> 01:26:49,146
Willie Nelson.

1472
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,313
Really?

1473
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:54,816
[J' Carole King: “Beautiful"]

1474
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,547
J' You got to get up
every morning

1475
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:01,183
J' With a smile on your face
and show the world

1478
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:11,504

1479
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:17,008
J' That you?e beautiful
as you feel

1480
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:26,178
I can't believe you...

1481
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:27,615
- I'm sorry.
- it's so weird.

1482
01:27:27,776 --> 01:27:29,619
It doesn't even look like you.

1483
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:32,685
I see no resemblance.

1484
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:34,791
I hope not.

1485
01:27:40,789 --> 01:27:43,793
How many times did you criticize him
for having bad breath?

1486
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:46,105
Or for shedding?

1487
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:49,903
Or for farts?

1488
01:27:50,065 --> 01:27:51,601
Shit.

1489
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:56,474
OK, get out.
How does that feel?

1490
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:58,984
Which one... Which one's the door?

1491
01:28:02,244 --> 01:28:04,053
You know what?
I'll try them all, never mind.

1492
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:08,054
Someone just wet his balls.

1493
01:28:10,085 --> 01:28:11,758
Oh, my God.

1494
01:28:15,157 --> 01:28:17,797
You wouldn't happen to know where
I could get some...

1495
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,267
Know what I mean?

1496
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:22,733
- What?
- Sling.

1497
01:28:22,898 --> 01:28:24,969
Ta-da, ta-da, ta-da.

1498
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,579
- You know what I'm saying?
- I'm so sorry, I don't.

1499
01:28:27,736 --> 01:28:30,580
- Doodly-doo.
- Jazz records?

1500
01:28:32,174 --> 01:28:34,916
- Hot veg.
- Hot veg.

1501
01:28:39,281 --> 01:28:41,192
Ah!

1502
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:42,953
That's not a table.

1503
01:28:45,754 --> 01:28:47,665
Oh, that was so much fun, Ned.

1504
01:28:48,924 --> 01:28:51,427
Yeah, why don't you
come live with us?

1505
01:28:51,593 --> 01:28:53,937
He's right, you should.

1506
01:29:01,603 --> 01:29:03,776
What's the funniest thing
you've ever seen?

1507
01:29:03,939 --> 01:29:05,441
Stuff.

1508
01:29:05,607 --> 01:29:08,213
Probably like Anchorman
or something, right?

1509
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:10,481
- I haven't seen Anchorman.
- What?!

1510
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:12,522
J' That you're beautiful

1511
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:19,030
