1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,120
Oh, God.

2
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,479
How are you, Richard? Hot enough for you?

3
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:35,558
Yeah.

4
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:44,234
Hey, what are you doing?

5
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:47,713
You dummy, why don't you watch
where you are going?

6
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:16,821
Does this look like 10:00, or like 10:30?

7
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:19,020
- Morning, Richard!
- Good morning.

8
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,259
- You are a half hour late.
- Only a half hour?

9
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:24,257
I am usually 45 minutes late.
I am early today.

10
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:26,057
I see.

11
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:35,253
- Are you going to join me today or what?
- Coming.

12
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:39,371
Give me your money and your wallets.

13
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:42,010
Get your ass out of here. It is too hot.

14
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:51,966
Color me old-fashioned, Rich,
but I just love the park on a Sunday.

15
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:55,964
I would love it more if we didn't have
to work today. Come on, let's go.

16
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,439
Let me open that for you, all right?

17
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:36,907
Hot enough for you, Larry?

18
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:39,746
No, Harris, why don't you turn up the heat?

19
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,105
Okay. I'll tell the engineer.

20
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:49,582
Cheap bastards. Turn off
the air conditioning on the weekends.

21
00:03:13,812 --> 00:03:17,051
- Let's go to the beach.
- No.

22
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,049
- We are going to be here our whole lives.
- Yeah, I am afraid so.

23
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,926
- I am going to the beach!
- Give me those papers.

24
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:30,405
- The papers are going to the beach.
- We aren't going.

25
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:32,524
You want these?
You're coming to the beach.

26
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:35,283
- I guess we are going to the beach.
- Wilson at the line.

27
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:39,281
That was beautiful. Replay.

28
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,760
Give me those papers!

29
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:51,236
- You think it's safe to go in the water?
- No, better not.

30
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:56,394
- You just ate. You might get cramps.
- I'll risk it.

31
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:07,949
{y:i}We'll get back to you with more tunes,
{y:i}but first we'll hear...

32
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:10,109
{y:i}the latest from Weather Central.

33
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:13,187
{y:i}- What is happening out there, buddy?
{y:i}- Sizzle, sizzle...

34
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:15,706
{y:i}as the Big Apple becomes the Baked Apple.

35
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:17,545
{y:i}You better believe that these are...

36
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,545
Oh, Christ. Will you shut that thing off?

37
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,664
{y:i}... continues before Labor Day weekend.

38
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:26,142
{y:i}It is going to be the four "H's":
{y:i}Hot, humid, hazy, and horrible.

39
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:30,940
This sucks. I am so unhappy.

40
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,578
- We should be at a real beach.
- There are no more real beaches.

41
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:39,576
I mean we could go to Jones Beach
and float around in the hospital waste.

42
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:41,655
Then again Coney Island is always real nice.

43
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:45,134
We could go there and watch the fish
disintegrate in front of our eyes.

44
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:49,372
Wait a minute. Wait a goddamn...
Hold the phone, buddy! I got it!

45
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:51,851
I got the $2 million. Where are your pages?

46
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,451
Get your pages.

47
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:56,809
Oh, my God!
You are not going to believe what you see!

48
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,448
- Okay.
- Turn to Page 28.

49
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:02,887
Right after 27.

50
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,165
- Got it.
- All right? You got it?

51
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:08,364
I want you to turn to Page 41 now.

52
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:11,723
- I got it.
- Check out line 18.

53
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:12,803
- Okay?
- Yeah.

54
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:13,962
- You see it?
- I see it.

55
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:15,801
What about it?

56
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:19,200
You are such a stupid piece of rat shit.

57
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,919
Hot!

58
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,558
- Watch your step!
- I am being barbecued here!

59
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:27,516
All right. Okay. All right, buddy
I am going to explain it to you real slow.

60
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:28,636
- Good.
- Okay.

61
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:32,354
There's more than one check issued
on the same life insurance policy claim.

62
00:05:32,394 --> 00:05:36,193
One in December of '87, another in
April of '88, and two more in June.

63
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:38,232
- Making any sense?
- Yeah, he died four times.

64
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:40,991
Yes. According to this, he died four times.

65
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:43,550
So somebody screwed up.
It wasn't us. Was it?

66
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,589
No. It wasn't us.

67
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,428
Don't you see?
We just uncovered a $2 million error.

68
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:51,386
We're going to be heroes.
We're going up the corporate ladder.

69
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:53,865
- This is good for me.
- Yes, this is good for you.

70
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:57,464
- It's good for me, too.
- I'll tell Lomax first thing in the morning.

71
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:59,703
- What page is it?
- No, Larry. Let me tell him.

72
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:02,062
- We'll both tell him.
- Okay. Great!

73
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,298
There is what's-her-name.

74
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,773
Stop staring at her.

75
00:06:24,853 --> 00:06:26,732
You've not shut up about her
for two months.

76
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:29,691
- Ask her out already, will you?
- No. I don't know what to say.

77
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:31,890
She's a summer intern.
She'll be gone in a week.

78
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,129
No, I've no idea what to say.

79
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:36,368
- Say "Hi, I want to go out with you."
- I can't say that.

80
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,127
Why not?

81
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,006
Because there are too many people around.

82
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:42,525
It's New York City.
There are always too many people.

83
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:44,125
Excuse me, miss.

84
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:51,402
Oh, shit.

85
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,441
Good weekend, Bob?

86
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:01,317
- You going to say something?
- Shut up.

87
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:04,596
- You are blowing it.
- Shut...

88
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:07,395
Please, shut up, all right?

89
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,512
Thank you.

90
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:24,108
Okay.

91
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,387
Try witty.

92
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:29,306
Say, "You know what would look
good on you?"

93
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:33,024
- "Me." Huh?
- Oh, please.

94
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:35,583
- Richard, that is a very good line.
- Enough, look...

95
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,462
- if I wanted to talk to her, I'll talk to her.
- Talk to her.

96
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:40,301
- Would you talk to her?
- Would you stop?

97
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,300
- You want me to talk to her?
- Yes.

98
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,860
Okay. Shut up.

99
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:45,819
Excuse me.

100
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:57,214
My aunt is very sick.

101
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:04,451
What?

102
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,650
Nothing.

103
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:18,605
I don't believe this, she's...

104
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:21,364
Now, don't flagellate yourself
over this, Richard.

105
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:23,923
It was a very good effort.
You'll get her next time.

106
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,762
Why did I just say that?
Larry, I don't even have an aunt.

107
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:28,041
So what?

108
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:30,440
Anything going on?

109
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,200
There are these messages.

110
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,198
And you are late for
the creative sales meeting, Mr. Lomax.

111
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:37,877
- Excuse us, Mr. Lomax.
- Let me get that, sir.

112
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:39,637
Sammy. Hank. How are you?

113
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:41,076
Richard Parker, sir.

114
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:42,835
- Larry Wilson.
- Whatever.

115
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:45,274
There's nothing from a Doreena,
a Martha, Judy?

116
00:08:45,314 --> 00:08:47,713
- No.
- Well, that's their tough luck.

117
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:49,073
- Excuse us, Mr. Lomax.
- What?

118
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,232
There's something
we would like to show you.

119
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:54,630
Wait. It's Monday morning.
After lunch, right?

120
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,470
Quite a bit after lunch.

121
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:57,909
Shoo.

122
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,059
Yeah, I got it, François.

123
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,537
That's $2.

124
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:30,176
Rich.

125
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:31,735
Look at Lomax.

126
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:33,014
God.

127
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:36,373
My God. Look at her.

128
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:37,453
My God.

129
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:40,411
Jesus. That guy.

130
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:44,090
Beautiful apartment. House at the beach.

131
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,169
Babes. A boat. A car.

132
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:50,887
Do you know how much it costs
to park a car in Manhattan every month?

133
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:54,765
- More than my rent.
- I mean, it's only fair.

134
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,884
His car is a bit bigger than your apartment.

135
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:00,643
So my apartment is small. It's dark.

136
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:04,082
It's hot. It's in a high-crime area.
Beats living with Mom and Dad.

137
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:07,480
All right. Enough.
It's just until I can afford something decent.

138
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,119
Something without
wall-to-wall cockroaches.

139
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:15,797
All I have to do is just keep
setting my goals and working hard...

140
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:17,236
- I'll be fine.
- You are so naive.

141
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:19,075
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

142
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,274
Go ahead. Oh, God.

143
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:24,313
I hope your aunt feels better.

144
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:27,072
- What?
- I said...

145
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:29,391
She said, "I hope your aunt feels better."

146
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:32,550
My aunt? The sick aunt. Yes, she is fine.

147
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,909
They thought it was...

148
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:36,508
Either get on the elevator or get off.

149
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:38,787
I'll be back.

150
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:45,624
And I lose again.

151
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:48,583
I won. I have a date.

152
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:50,862
- You are kidding.
- No.

153
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:54,021
Gwen and I, Thursday night,
8:00 p.m., dinner.

154
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,379
- Fabulous.
- It was the clumsy approach. It worked.

155
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:00,298
You are going to want
to borrow my apartment.

156
00:11:00,378 --> 00:11:02,857
No, but thank you. That's sweet.

157
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:05,656
But I can't do that to you. Thank you.

158
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:10,174
If she finds out you live with your folks,
you will embarrass yourself.

159
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,813
Yeah, I know, but I can't do that to you.

160
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:18,970
It is the cockroaches, isn't it?

161
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,169
- Well...
- They scatter when the lights go on.

162
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,727
{y:i}Mr. Parker, Mr. Lomax will see you now.

163
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:28,207
I feel lucky.

164
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:34,684
No, I only want the Maserati
if it comes in that jet black.

165
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:36,163
Look, if you can't do it for me...

166
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:39,202
I'll just have to take my business
to another dealer.

167
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:40,761
Yeah.

168
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:44,560
So paint it! I mean how hard
can this whole thing be?

169
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,799
Right.

170
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,798
All right. See, that's better.

171
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:51,637
See how easy it is to do business with me?

172
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:56,555
No trade. Strictly cash.

173
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:58,114
Right.

174
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:00,313
All right. Good.

175
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:07,710
Gentlemen, what have you got for me?

176
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:13,308
As you may or may not know, Mr. Lomax...

177
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:17,506
Larry and I have been, I mean, working.

178
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:20,305
- Where is he going?
- I don't know.

179
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:23,344
What are we supposed to do?

180
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:27,262
Bet that thing moves, huh? Jesus.

181
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:29,901
- Put that back.
- It's a beautiful boat.

182
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:41,896
You gentlemen were saying...

183
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,175
Yes, well.

184
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,135
As you might have heard...

185
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:50,053
Larry and I have been reprogramming
the accounts on the new computer system.

186
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:51,732
- Right.
- Thanks.

187
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:54,891
Sir, it's a very big job.

188
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:57,250
A big job. We have been working hard.

189
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,329
A very big job.

190
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:00,728
I've been at it for quite some time.
Weekends also.

191
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:02,887
- Weekends, late, and...
- Why don't you show him?

192
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:03,967
Thank you.

193
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,886
We've got something
you should know about.

194
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:08,565
- Got them both there?
- Yes. Page 28 and 41.

195
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,359
You sure these figures are accurate?

196
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,158
- Yes.
- Positive.

197
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,918
Yes, sir, Mr. Lomax.

198
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,716
Bernie.

199
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:35,714
Call me Bernie.

200
00:13:35,794 --> 00:13:38,073
I mean my father is Mr. Lomax, right?

201
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:48,748
Okay, Bernie.

202
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:53,626
- Yes, it's all there in black and white.
- We both worked on this one, Bern.

203
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:55,465
"E."

204
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:57,465
Bernie.

205
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:01,903
- Papers.
- Right here, Bernie.

206
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,381
If anything has to go,
I am glad it's my vision...

207
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:08,540
and not the old joystick,
you know what I mean?

208
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:12,338
That's computer ink, sir.

209
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:18,776
Oh, no, you are wrong. Look.

210
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:23,454
There are multiple checks issued
because there were several policies written.

211
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:26,053
You didn't take into consideration
that it's normal...

212
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:29,131
especially when using
a fluctuating COL index to combine...

213
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:33,090
Iook here, a package containing
short-term and straight life policies...

214
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,009
in an overall insurance portfolio.

215
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:37,208
Now you are wasting my time.

216
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,565
Richard worked on that part, sir.

217
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:48,163
That is true, Bernie.

218
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:53,001
But if you were to look at the back page,
where the policy indexes are...

219
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:55,440
you'll notice that the remaining policies...

220
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,639
are dated after
the policy holder died, Bernie.

221
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,358
You are right.

222
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:04,477
You are absolutely right.
Gentlemen, this is good work.

223
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:06,236
Very, very good work.

224
00:15:06,316 --> 00:15:07,915
Thank you, Bernie.

225
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:10,914
I hate to say this, but it appears
as if somebody is trying...

226
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:13,793
to defraud the company.
Perhaps we should check back records.

227
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:16,472
Somebody tried to smoke it
past the wrong guy.

228
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:18,551
No smoking.

229
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,949
Gentlemen, how long have you two
been working here?

230
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:24,428
- Nineteen months and a week.
- I am not really sure.

231
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:27,187
- A little longer, I think.
- Longer? I was here before you.

232
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:28,547
No, Richard. I trained you.

233
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,466
I came here in January,
you came the end of May.

234
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:33,105
I trained you.

235
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:34,464
Whatever!

236
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:38,303
What I am saying is that
I think there is a big future here...

237
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:41,101
for a couple of bright fellows
like yourselves.

238
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:42,901
Thank you.

239
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:45,220
But I'd like to go over these numbers
with you...

240
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,619
just to make sure
that you've gotten everything.

241
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,737
The only trouble is if someone is trying to...

242
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:53,256
like you said
"smoke it past the wrong guy"...

243
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:55,575
I'd like to just keep it confidential.

244
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:58,254
I mean there is no sense sending up
a bunch of red flags.

245
00:15:58,334 --> 00:15:59,494
No, absolutely not.

246
00:15:59,574 --> 00:16:01,453
If you would like, we'll work late.

247
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,772
- Yes, I mean we'll work weekends.
- Weekends are very good for me.

248
00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:07,251
Weekends. Good idea.

249
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,449
Give us plenty of time together,
no distractions.

250
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,169
It is Labor Day.

251
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:17,326
I got an idea.

252
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:23,524
How would you two like to come
to my house at the beach?

253
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:24,883
- Me?
- Us?

254
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,643
Yeah. Hampton Island.

255
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:29,401
Ever been there? Well, you will love it.

256
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:31,720
When we're not working,
there are distractions.

257
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,639
There are women, swimming,
boating, famous people.

258
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:39,237
Well?

259
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:40,317
- Love to!
- Okay.

260
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:42,196
Good! It's settled.

261
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,795
We are going to have a good time,
I guarantee.

262
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,874
My secretary will write down
the directions...

263
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:50,193
- give you the ferry schedule.
- The ferry schedule?

264
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:53,551
It's the only way to get there,
unless you have a boat. I don't know.

265
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:55,391
I have never even been on a boat.

266
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:57,870
I was once on the Staten Island Ferry
with my folks...

267
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,748
Whatever. You come out Friday night,
you'll have a great time, I guarantee it.

268
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,787
I'll even drive you back to the city myself
on Monday. Okay?

269
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:06,986
We don't know what to say, Bernie.

270
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:09,945
You don't have to say anything.

271
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:12,943
If you two uncovered what I think
you uncovered...

272
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:16,742
old Bernie here owes you both a great deal.
I mean it sincerely.

273
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:19,021
Now get out of here. Go on.

274
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,419
He loves us.

275
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:26,658
The man absolutely loves us.

276
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:30,256
You have to kill them, Vito.

277
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,050
Let me explain something to you.

278
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,569
We don't do that anymore.
We are a corporation now.

279
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:51,967
We are in the market. We invest.

280
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:55,806
Real estate. Car rentals. Parking lots.

281
00:17:57,165 --> 00:17:59,404
Parking lots. That's good.

282
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:03,043
- I understand that, but...
- Didn't I order the walnut dressing?

283
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,442
- Yes, you did.
- Taste that.

284
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:10,160
Does that taste
anything like walnut dressing? Tell me.

285
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:13,198
This is the raspberry vinaigrette.

286
00:18:13,998 --> 00:18:16,677
Should I have Paulie go
and talk to the chef?

287
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:22,794
This goddamn raspberry vinaigrette...

288
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:28,512
Excuse me, Vito.

289
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:39,667
I know how important food is to you,
I mean...

290
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,866
But we've got a problem here.

291
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,225
I give problems. I don't get problems.

292
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:53,941
How do you propose to handle it?

293
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:57,060
Let's make it a murder-suicide job. All right?

294
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,059
Okay, gentlemen?

295
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:02,898
I'll plant some money, fake a note,
and they can take the rap and...

296
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:05,776
I won't even have to change the books.

297
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:07,776
What do you think?

298
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:14,173
I like it. It's creative.

299
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:20,650
I am a little rusty. But it'll come back to me.

300
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:27,847
Okay.

301
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:33,165
- Do it.
- This is good.

302
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:35,844
I mean this is really good. Good.

303
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:41,402
I think we are going to have some fun.

304
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,318
- I have to get going. I really do.
- What, no dessert?

305
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:52,877
They do a wonderful crème brûlée here.
It's delicious.

306
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:56,715
No, gentlemen, I really must be going.
Thanks for dinner, Vito.

307
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:05,552
I got to go powder my nose.

308
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:24,544
Forget the accident with the two guys.

309
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,063
Take care of Lomax.

310
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:28,982
He's getting too careless...

311
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:31,741
too greedy.

312
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:36,139
Besides...

313
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,498
he's screwing my girlfriend.

314
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:42,576
But you said we were going to
spend the weekend at the beach!

315
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:45,575
You heard the conversation.
What am I supposed to do about it?

316
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:46,615
- Bernie.
- What?

317
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:50,333
I told Vito I was going to spend
some time with my mother!

318
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,929
I have to see you, Bernie.

319
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:01,368
Cut it out.

320
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:04,847
- What's wrong with you? Wait a minute.
- What?

321
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:06,806
- I have an idea.
- What?

322
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:09,885
You are on, 9:00 Friday night.
I'll be at the apartment.

323
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:11,844
Just use your key. All right?

324
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:14,803
I'll wear something special.

325
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:18,201
I bet you never had sweet and sour
matzo balls before.

326
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:19,281
No.

327
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,999
- I am glad you finally asked me out.
- You are?

328
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:28,437
I wish you had asked me out sooner.

329
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:31,876
Today was my last day at work.
I am going back to college.

330
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:35,154
We could still have
this weekend together, right?

331
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,194
I am spending it with my folks.

332
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:39,713
- Are your folks in town?
- No.

333
00:21:40,472 --> 00:21:44,071
Is this the intimate evening
I promised you, or what?

334
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,669
You think there's anywhere we could go
to just sit and talk...

335
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:50,988
and not have to scream
and get run over by garbage trucks?

336
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:52,947
- Hey, want to throw her in?
- How you doing?

337
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:56,186
I'd invite you to my apartment,
but I have five roommates.

338
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:58,625
And they are all at home
doing their hair right now.

339
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:02,703
That's a lot of hair. But it's clean. I like that.

340
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:07,221
It's either that or living with my parents,
and I don't think that's a good idea.

341
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:10,740
I can't blame you. Who'd want
to live with their folks? That's no good.

342
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,858
- Do you have any roommates?
- No. Roommates? No. None.

343
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:15,698
Why don't we go to your place?

344
00:22:15,778 --> 00:22:19,376
Come on, baby. You're not a woman.
Are you? Tell me the truth.

345
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,373
Okay.

346
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:40,327
Why are you tiptoeing?

347
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:43,166
Because...

348
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:50,123
the people who live downstairs,
they're very light sleepers.

349
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:53,762
They get angry when I walk.

350
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:56,880
Why are you whispering?

351
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,999
- Am I?
- Yes.

352
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,917
I am. That's because of the walls.
They are too thin.

353
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,555
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

354
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,108
Look at this teak.
I mean this whole apartment.

355
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:28,827
Sort of '60s style.

356
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,906
Yeah. I know.
I've been meaning to redo that for years.

357
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:35,065
No, I love it. I mean, it's very hip.

358
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:38,743
I think you have done the place beautifully.

359
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:41,062
I like it. It's home.

360
00:23:41,142 --> 00:23:44,061
You know, it's a side of you
I never would have expected.

361
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:45,660
I'm very impressed.

362
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,379
- Are you?
- Yeah.

363
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:49,858
About what?

364
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:53,057
This apartment has got to be expensive.

365
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:55,896
So obviously you could have taken me
to some flash restaurant instead of that...

366
00:23:56,016 --> 00:23:58,535
Is "dump" the word you are groping for?

367
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:01,134
You didn't like Hymie's Hunan?

368
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:04,852
- It's a four-star dive.
- It was great. I loved it.

369
00:24:04,932 --> 00:24:08,291
It's just that some men
would try to impress women by...

370
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:10,490
pretending to be something they are not.

371
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,048
I absolutely agree. That's a terrible way
to begin a relationship.

372
00:24:14,128 --> 00:24:16,887
Pretending to be something you are not.

373
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:18,247
Oh, God.

374
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:21,445
You don't have to answer this
if you don't want to...

375
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:24,204
but how do you afford a place like this?

376
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:28,602
I don't like to brag.

377
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,961
I just feel uncomfortable
showing off my money...

378
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:36,199
but I've made some wise investments.
I dabble in the stock market.

379
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:40,557
And of course my parents
were rather well off.

380
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:42,916
Do you want to sit?

381
00:24:45,995 --> 00:24:47,634
They passed away?

382
00:24:48,714 --> 00:24:49,754
Yes.

383
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:51,953
They must have been young.

384
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:54,032
Oh, yeah.

385
00:24:54,312 --> 00:24:56,911
I feel I can trust you.

386
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,149
They were in a train accident.

387
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:03,788
Yeah, I mean I don't know
what it was with trains...

388
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:07,466
but they just always liked to travel in trains.

389
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:09,825
I am sorry.

390
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:13,064
- How awful for you.
- Yeah.

391
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:19,581
You know, I always thought trains
were so much safer than planes.

392
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:23,540
Well, actually, a plane...

393
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:26,418
fell on the train.

394
00:25:52,288 --> 00:25:53,807
- Richard.
- Gwen.

395
00:25:56,286 --> 00:26:00,124
There's a man in his underwear
in your kitchen.

396
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:02,923
He's... He's with me.

397
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:08,241
He's my butler. But...

398
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:11,440
- You have a butler?
- Yeah. Don't get him started.

399
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,838
He'll just go away if you just be quiet.

400
00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:25,434
Sorry. I didn't realize you had company.

401
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:27,193
Good evening, young lady.

402
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:29,312
That's all right, Monroe.

403
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:36,589
Yes, will you, please, just go lay out
my navy blue suit for the morning?

404
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:37,749
Please.

405
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,188
- How about if I lay you out?
- Very well.

406
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:48,544
- You let your butler talk to you like that?
- Well, he is a vet.

407
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:50,863
He has got a steel plate in his head.

408
00:26:52,822 --> 00:26:55,141
Gwen, it's not what you think.

409
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:57,341
Goodbye, Richard.

410
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:25,489
I'll grab the bow line.

411
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:28,648
- Hey, Skeet. How are you doing?
- Hey, Mr. Lomax.

412
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:31,606
Here you go, my friend.
Buy yourself a girlfriend.

413
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:34,485
Where have you been, Candy?

414
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,443
- Hey, Bernie. How about a drink?
- A little bit later.

415
00:27:41,642 --> 00:27:44,961
- Yo, Bernie. The cocktail flag is up.
- A little bit later.

416
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,800
Booze and women.
That is my lifestyle and I love it!

417
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,159
And I!

418
00:28:25,744 --> 00:28:28,543
- George, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mr. Lomax.

419
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:34,020
What are you doing here?
I fired you last week.

420
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,660
- I just want my $90, okay?
- Bullshit!

421
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,099
You drank my liquor
and the toilets still don't work.

422
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:40,018
I don't want to see you.

423
00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:41,617
Get out of here!

424
00:28:42,297 --> 00:28:44,656
You come back again,
I am going to call the cops!

425
00:28:44,736 --> 00:28:46,495
You son of a bitch.

426
00:28:49,454 --> 00:28:53,292
- I am sorry. I think she needs a little B-12.
- Whatever.

427
00:28:53,372 --> 00:28:56,211
{y:i}This is Bernie. Leave a message,
{y:i}I'll get right back to you.

428
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,250
- Goodbye, Mr. Lomax.
- Bye.

429
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,890
Hello?

430
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:03,688
Hey, Lomax. It's Paulie.
I just got to the island.

431
00:29:04,048 --> 00:29:05,087
You are early.

432
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,526
Those schmucks are not coming
until the 6:00 ferry...

433
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:10,085
- and I still have to plant the note.
- Yeah.

434
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:11,485
So where is your house?

435
00:29:11,525 --> 00:29:13,604
It's on the point, top of the dune.

436
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:16,523
Look, Paulie,
don't kill them while I am around.

437
00:29:16,563 --> 00:29:18,682
Bernie, we are on a phone here.

438
00:29:18,762 --> 00:29:20,521
Right. You are right. Okay, I am sorry.

439
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:23,920
The point is, I just want to be
back in New York with an alibi, okay?

440
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,999
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

441
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:38,554
Oh, God!

442
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:42,032
Rich. It is leaving. Come on!

443
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:44,591
I told you we should've taken
a taxi from the station.

444
00:29:44,631 --> 00:29:47,590
- There's another boat in a half hour.
- We'll miss the parties.

445
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,629
We got it. Excuse me.

446
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:51,988
- Sorry.
- Coming through.

447
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:55,507
Don't be ridiculous! What are you doing?
We are not jumping on this boat!

448
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:56,946
- Do you hear me?
- Here we go!

449
00:29:57,026 --> 00:30:00,065
Listen to me, Larry, we are not
jumping on this boat!

450
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:02,504
- Jesus Christ! My elbow!
- Piece of cake!

451
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,422
Thanks, pal.

452
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:12,460
This ferry isn't leaving. It's docking.

453
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,858
- Okay. We're early.
- You schmuck.

454
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:33,171
- What is your name?
- What is your name?

455
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,370
- Larry.
- Hi, Larry. I am Michelle.

456
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,968
Come on! Lighten up there, Rich!
We are on our way!

457
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:42,727
I am so depressed.
I made a fool out of myself last night.

458
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:43,886
Of course you did.

459
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:46,445
- I should've stayed home.
- What are you talking about?

460
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:50,084
We've been summoned to the mountain top.
This is good for your career.

461
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:54,082
You know, by the time this weekend is over,
I promise you won't even remember...

462
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:57,201
what's-her-name's name.
I'll get you a drink. Come on.

463
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:59,400
Look, I'll see you later.

464
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,959
Goodbye, young man. Nice talking to you.

465
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,512
That is good. This is very good.

466
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,109
- I did not hear you come in.
- I know.

467
00:31:26,949 --> 00:31:28,308
I am real good at that.

468
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:30,947
- I told you the guys aren't here yet, didn't I?
- You did.

469
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:32,786
- Good.
- Quite a shack you have here.

470
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:34,306
It's home.

471
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:37,224
Can I have a cigarette?

472
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,143
Cigarette.

473
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:43,542
Sure.

474
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,819
What was...

475
00:31:59,455 --> 00:32:01,494
Quite a ride, huh, Bern?

476
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:22,485
Glorious day out, or what?

477
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:24,005
Where's Bernie?

478
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:28,323
I got it right here. It says it's the last house
on the point, top of the dune.

479
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:33,001
Pardon me, Monsignor, sir, could you
tell me where the top of the dune is?

480
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:36,600
- Bless you, my son.
- Thank you, Father.

481
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:39,079
Look, we'll find it. Okay.

482
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:42,557
- You know, it's an island, right?
- How hard can it be?

483
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:45,956
Excuse me. Is this the way to...

484
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:04,388
- Yo, is this Bernie Lomax's house?
- Sure is.

485
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:06,027
Wow.

486
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:08,866
Holy shit. Look at this.

487
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,945
Come on, Rich.

488
00:33:14,704 --> 00:33:16,183
Oh, beautiful.

489
00:33:16,303 --> 00:33:18,462
Oh, my God. He has got a pool.

490
00:33:18,702 --> 00:33:21,701
He has got a goddamn pool at the beach.
It's heated.

491
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:23,100
I love this man.

492
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,779
This is inspiring. Look at this view.

493
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:30,177
- I am getting laid.
- Sure beats Coney Island.

494
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,414
What? Should we just walk in?

495
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:44,012
No, we'll stand out here all weekend.
Come on, we are houseguests.

496
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:48,010
Hello! Bernie, we are here.

497
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,769
Amazing.

498
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:51,888
I am home.

499
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:53,328
Excellent.

500
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:58,246
- Admit it. You are glad you came.
- Okay, I admit it.

501
00:33:59,085 --> 00:34:02,524
- We got three days of this ahead of us.
- Oh, yeah. This is something.

502
00:34:02,604 --> 00:34:06,922
I mean a place like this must go for what,
a $1.6 million, $1.7 million. Unfurnished.

503
00:34:07,002 --> 00:34:10,121
- Good God! That's a Lichtenstein!
- What? Where?

504
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:12,560
Not the piano. The painting. It's an original.

505
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,239
Of course it is.

506
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:17,558
All of this could be yours,
if you set your goals and work hard.

507
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,916
My old man worked hard.
All they did was give him more work.

508
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:25,514
Hey, is Bernie around?

509
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:29,833
Hello. No, haven't seen him.
But we just got here.

510
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:32,392
We're going to be here all weekend.
We are houseguests.

511
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,751
Tell him Tawny borrowed his boat
to go skiing.

512
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:36,710
Hi, Tawny. I am horny.

513
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,948
- Hi. Look, don't forget to tell Bernie, okay?
- Okay.

514
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:44,746
Tawny, you wouldn't happen to know
where Bernie is, would you?

515
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:46,186
He's probably making the rounds.

516
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:50,184
Everybody parties from house to house,
but they always end up here. Bye!

517
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:54,622
- And you didn't want to come.
- I admit it, I was wrong.

518
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:57,501
Oh, my God.

519
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:02,939
Nothing but champagne and caviar.
Pierre Jouët.

520
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,778
This guy is my idol.

521
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:06,657
- Don't open that.
- Why not?

522
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,816
We are houseguests, come on.
You want some?

523
00:35:08,896 --> 00:35:11,895
No, thanks. This is strange.
Where's our host?

524
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:15,094
You heard Tawny. He's out partying.
Come on.

525
00:35:15,174 --> 00:35:17,853
Let's check out the rest of this joint.

526
00:35:18,412 --> 00:35:19,492
This is fabulous.

527
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:28,008
I found him. Mr. Lomax.

528
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:30,048
Bernie! How are you doing? Great place.

529
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,606
I hope you don't mind, but we just
walked in. We didn't know that you...

530
00:35:33,686 --> 00:35:34,886
Bernie?

531
00:35:35,805 --> 00:35:37,205
He's sleeping.

532
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:41,163
Yeah.

533
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:45,561
It's not even dark out
and he's out of his skull.

534
00:35:45,641 --> 00:35:48,120
He's been working awfully hard, you know.

535
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,919
Don't slap him. That's your boss.

536
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:54,038
I know. He's meditating.

537
00:35:54,158 --> 00:35:57,116
He's not. He's like dead, man.
Come on, let's walk him around.

538
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,996
We'll get the blood circulating.

539
00:35:59,076 --> 00:36:01,155
There we go. Okay, this way.

540
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:03,914
Here we go.

541
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:07,352
That's it. Move those feet, Bernie.
That's a boy.

542
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,551
- Here you go.
- Get him up.

543
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:11,630
Carry your weight, here, Richard.

544
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,990
Come on, Bernie.

545
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,549
- Move those feet.
- He's giving me a hernia.

546
00:36:16,028 --> 00:36:19,027
I am losing him. Put him on the couch.

547
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:25,145
- We can't just leave him like this, you know.
- Come on, Bernie.

548
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:32,062
Get your hand off me, Bernie.

549
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:36,500
I'll make the coffee.

550
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:47,375
Don't you worry, Mr. Lomax, we'll make
you some coffee, fix you right up.

551
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,453
Tell you what, let's just make you
a little more comfy.

552
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:54,652
That is better. There you go.

553
00:36:55,092 --> 00:36:58,531
You are dropping things
right out of your pocket here.

554
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:07,487
You want to come in here for a minute?

555
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:10,166
- Yeah, look, Rich, is instant okay?
- That's fine.

556
00:37:10,246 --> 00:37:12,885
- Good. What?
- Look what I found in his pocket.

557
00:37:15,924 --> 00:37:17,203
Wow.

558
00:37:18,123 --> 00:37:19,282
Jesus.

559
00:37:19,962 --> 00:37:22,681
I never knew he was into the drug scene.

560
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,799
God. Look how much is here.

561
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:28,838
This is not recreational. This is a career.

562
00:37:29,238 --> 00:37:31,077
This man needs some help. You know that?

563
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:33,396
If he's not careful,
he's going to wake up dead.

564
00:37:33,476 --> 00:37:36,355
I watch {y:i}20/{y:i}20. I know the statistics.

565
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:38,274
I read.

566
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:42,632
- What?
- Larry, Lomax is dead.

567
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,190
He can't be.

568
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:04,663
Why do these things always happen to me?

569
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:11,900
What kind of a host invites you to his house
for the weekend and dies on you?

570
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,458
Why would he do this?
I mean, he had everything.

571
00:38:16,938 --> 00:38:19,577
A house. Cars. Women.

572
00:38:20,657 --> 00:38:22,176
This is tragic.

573
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:27,294
I don't understand why he couldn't wait
until Monday to kill himself.

574
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:31,172
Look. We have to call the police.

575
00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:35,451
And how am I going to get back to the city?
He promised me a ride.

576
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:39,809
Knock it off, Larry. Who cares about a ride?
We are talking death here.

577
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:43,407
I mean this is just my luck.

578
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:45,766
I finally catch a break at the office...

579
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:48,965
finally see some light
at the end of the tunnel and wham! Gone!

580
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:52,044
Wait a minute. What am I going to tell them?

581
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,403
They might think
we had something to do with it.

582
00:38:54,483 --> 00:38:57,481
I told everyone we were going
to Bernie's house for the weekend.

583
00:38:57,561 --> 00:38:59,960
They were so jealous. I mean, I loved it.

584
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,959
- Now what am I going to tell them?
- I don't know.

585
00:39:04,878 --> 00:39:06,917
Bernie, you should have been on the court.

586
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:09,596
- What a great day.
- Do you see him?

587
00:39:09,676 --> 00:39:10,916
Where are you?

588
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:22,471
Bernie, baby, get off your ass.
It's party time!

589
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:25,630
You should have been out there
sailing with us today.

590
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,748
The sun was fabulous, the wind was
fabulous, we had a great time.

591
00:39:28,828 --> 00:39:30,508
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

592
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:34,066
Love you, darling, just love you.
You know, you could use a little sun.

593
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:36,185
We are going again tomorrow
if you want to go.

594
00:39:36,265 --> 00:39:39,984
Lie on the deck, catch those rays.
Don't worry. I'll help myself.

595
00:39:41,903 --> 00:39:43,222
He's dead.

596
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,701
That's the idea, isn't it? Cheers.

597
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,300
Hi, Bern!

598
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,499
Hey, Bernie.

599
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:55,417
Hi, Bernie.

600
00:39:57,297 --> 00:39:59,536
Hey, dude. You need to pump some iron.

601
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:03,814
So, Bernie. What about your Porsche?

602
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:05,533
Had a chance to think about my offer?

603
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:09,332
You know, $30,000 is a more than
decent price for that car.

604
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:14,449
You just think about it, take your time,
don't rush into anything. See you later.

605
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:20,767
Excuse me.

606
00:40:20,847 --> 00:40:21,966
You promised me a review...

607
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:24,285
on the front page
of the {y:i}Sunday Times book section.

608
00:40:24,365 --> 00:40:26,085
I know, Alice, but he won't bend on it.

609
00:40:26,165 --> 00:40:28,484
He says there's no interest
in the subject matter.

610
00:40:28,564 --> 00:40:30,643
Pardon me. What's the book about?

611
00:40:30,723 --> 00:40:33,801
Whether Sherlock Holmes
and Dr. Watson were secretly married.

612
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:35,841
- Eyes, nose, and breasts.
- How much?

613
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:38,639
A little tuck here, little sand there,
a little lift there.

614
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:39,999
Do I need that much?

615
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,838
These people.
Where did all these people come from?

616
00:40:42,878 --> 00:40:45,277
Floating party. Happens every weekend.

617
00:40:45,397 --> 00:40:47,436
- Like a drink?
- No, thanks.

618
00:40:47,556 --> 00:40:49,875
Yeah, I'd love some champagne, thanks.

619
00:40:49,955 --> 00:40:52,434
Hey, Bernie. What a radical party.

620
00:40:53,193 --> 00:40:55,912
Got to move your workout
to late tomorrow afternoon, B.

621
00:40:55,952 --> 00:41:00,110
Liza's maid is over for the weekend,
and I had to give her your regular time.

622
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,909
Thanks, Klaus. I got it.

623
00:41:03,189 --> 00:41:04,549
See you, Bern.

624
00:41:05,068 --> 00:41:07,947
Feels good, eh, Bern? You are really loose.

625
00:41:08,147 --> 00:41:11,186
Never seen you this relaxed before.
Keep it up.

626
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:13,065
I've got to go. Duty calls.

627
00:41:14,145 --> 00:41:15,904
Hey, babe.

628
00:41:15,984 --> 00:41:19,223
Hi, Bernie. I hear you got something for me.

629
00:41:19,502 --> 00:41:21,142
A little present.

630
00:41:22,701 --> 00:41:24,620
Playing games, are we?

631
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,779
It's got to be in here somewhere.

632
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:31,497
I think I found something.

633
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:34,896
Thanks a lot, Bernie.

634
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:39,134
Doesn't anyone realize he's dead?

635
00:41:41,693 --> 00:41:43,732
Okay, Bernie, I'm going to shoot the wad.

636
00:41:43,812 --> 00:41:47,131
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I am going to go $40,000.

637
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:49,890
No? You'll be begging me.

638
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:53,848
We have to call the police.

639
00:41:55,527 --> 00:41:56,687
Here.

640
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,166
- Some of the biggest producers.
- Yeah?

641
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,480
Hello, is this the police? Yes...

642
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,719
I got an idea.

643
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,638
I know it's going to sound funny,
but just hear me out.

644
00:42:17,718 --> 00:42:20,677
No, why is the hair on the back of
my neck starting to stand up?

645
00:42:20,757 --> 00:42:23,276
Okay, now, we could call the police,
we could do that...

646
00:42:23,356 --> 00:42:25,595
but you know where we'd be
spending our weekend...

647
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:30,153
in some hot police station answering
questions we don't know the answers to.

648
00:42:30,233 --> 00:42:33,512
Now, obviously Bernie felt
he owed us something here...

649
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,910
some small little favor for discovering
those mistakes at the company.

650
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,269
That's why he invited us out here
for the weekend in the first place.

651
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,667
It'd be almost disrespectful
not to grant him his final wish.

652
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:48,226
All I am saying is,
why don't we just pretend he didn't die?

653
00:42:50,984 --> 00:42:52,504
Just for a bit?

654
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,141
I don't believe I am hearing this.

655
00:42:58,221 --> 00:43:01,460
I loved that man. He loved me.

656
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,459
I know he loved you.

657
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:05,938
He'd want this.

658
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:10,896
I mean he would really want this.

659
00:43:12,815 --> 00:43:15,934
Yes, Operator, can you get me
the police, please? Thank you.

660
00:43:15,974 --> 00:43:18,613
Incidentally,
you're a disgusting human being.

661
00:43:20,372 --> 00:43:21,492
Gwen.

662
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,049
- Well, hello, Gwen.
- Wayne. Hi.

663
00:43:29,328 --> 00:43:31,488
{y:i}Hampton Bay Police Department.

664
00:43:32,127 --> 00:43:33,647
{y:i}Hello?

665
00:43:34,926 --> 00:43:36,326
It's amazing.

666
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:41,204
{y:i}- Hello. Police department.
- I'll call the police.

667
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:44,722
No, you know, you were right.
Bernie would have wanted it this way.

668
00:43:44,802 --> 00:43:46,881
No, I think we should call the police.

669
00:43:46,961 --> 00:43:49,720
Larry, just give me 10 minutes, okay?

670
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:52,279
Take 20.

671
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:55,398
- Hi.
- Hi, Freda.

672
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:56,997
Darling, you look wonderful.

673
00:43:57,357 --> 00:43:59,116
$45,000.

674
00:43:59,356 --> 00:44:02,515
Plus free tennis lessons.
That's it, take it or leave it.

675
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:06,873
Is this guy a tough negotiator or what?

676
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:10,112
Keep the piece of shit.

677
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,230
What a bash.

678
00:44:18,348 --> 00:44:21,467
You animal. You are insatiable.

679
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:23,906
You slay me, Bernie.

680
00:44:23,986 --> 00:44:27,824
- I've got to talk to you.
- Bernie is a little wasted right now.

681
00:44:27,904 --> 00:44:30,343
Hi. Wait. Okay.

682
00:44:30,423 --> 00:44:33,022
I can't blame you if you
never want to speak to me again.

683
00:44:33,102 --> 00:44:35,621
If I were you, I wouldn't want
to speak to me, either.

684
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:39,979
But I just want to tell you I am sorry
for being such a jerk last night.

685
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:43,578
I don't know what got into me.
I hope you can forgive me.

686
00:44:47,656 --> 00:44:52,094
It was kind of funny, seeing your father
in his underwear and everything.

687
00:44:53,813 --> 00:44:57,492
- So you do forgive me?
- No, but it was kind of funny.

688
00:44:58,092 --> 00:45:00,651
I'll never lie again. Honest.

689
00:45:03,929 --> 00:45:05,608
So what are you doing here?

690
00:45:05,688 --> 00:45:09,367
Mr. Lomax invited me and my friend Larry
for the weekend.

691
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:12,765
- Moving up in the company?
- Yeah.

692
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:17,324
I saw this great play. Yeah, it' s called...

693
00:45:17,124 --> 00:45:19,563
You are on your own for a minute here.

694
00:45:19,962 --> 00:45:22,362
Great writer.

695
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:25,560
Well, hello.

696
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:30,558
I'm Larry.

697
00:45:31,198 --> 00:45:32,757
Fuck off, Larry.

698
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:35,556
Okay.

699
00:45:37,075 --> 00:45:39,155
By the way, how's your aunt?

700
00:45:39,354 --> 00:45:41,114
- Who?
- Your aunt?

701
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:44,472
- She passed away.
- I'm sorry.

702
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:45,752
It's all right.

703
00:45:45,832 --> 00:45:48,870
Didn't you say you'd be spending
this weekend with your parents?

704
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,989
- Yes, I did. I am. They have a house here.
- Great.

705
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:57,027
There's Bernie. I wanted to thank him
for my summer job.

706
00:45:57,107 --> 00:45:58,826
I'll be right back.

707
00:45:59,186 --> 00:46:00,346
No!

708
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,345
What?

709
00:46:03,504 --> 00:46:04,704
Nothing.

710
00:46:10,182 --> 00:46:12,301
Go see Bernie about it. Go see Bernie.

711
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,499
- Gwen, darling, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

712
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:20,657
Have I ever told you
I never liked the name Gwen on you?

713
00:46:21,097 --> 00:46:23,456
To me you'll always be Vanessa.

714
00:46:24,176 --> 00:46:27,215
Her father and I,
we went to Harvard together.

715
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,133
You are probably right. Oh, Bernie.

716
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:32,332
Here we go, sugar, move it over!
Okay, baby?

717
00:46:32,412 --> 00:46:33,492
Asshole!

718
00:46:33,572 --> 00:46:37,050
- I don't understand why we've to move him.
- Don't ask. Just move him.

719
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,370
Here we go. Ready?

720
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:42,328
- I can't believe I'm touching a dead body.
- He was your boss. Come on, let's go.

721
00:46:44,647 --> 00:46:47,966
- What a kidder.
- Bernie, you had a little too much.

722
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:50,645
Come on, you had too much again,
you big knucklehead.

723
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,404
Come on, let's go.

724
00:46:52,444 --> 00:46:54,003
Come on. He is crazy.

725
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:55,883
Here we go. Walk it off, big guy.

726
00:46:55,963 --> 00:46:57,322
Nice outfit.

727
00:46:57,402 --> 00:47:01,320
Look even nicer
crumpled up on my floor in the morning.

728
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,759
Polyester doesn't crumple.

729
00:47:08,997 --> 00:47:11,556
- Here we go. That's it, Bernie.
- Hi, Bernie.

730
00:47:12,316 --> 00:47:14,515
- Just like last week, huh?
- Come on.

731
00:47:17,474 --> 00:47:19,913
All right. Okay.

732
00:47:20,193 --> 00:47:24,151
Look me in the eye. $50,000.

733
00:47:24,231 --> 00:47:27,909
Yes! I knew it! Thank you, Bernie!

734
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:31,108
Thank you so much. This guy is like family.

735
00:47:31,188 --> 00:47:32,587
You are beautiful!

736
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:35,666
Grab him. Larry.

737
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:39,864
- Jesus.
- Oh, God.

738
00:47:40,544 --> 00:47:44,023
- Hi, boys. Great view.
- Hello, there. How are you?

739
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:48,781
I give it an 8.3.

740
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,859
We can't just leave him there, you know.

741
00:48:02,695 --> 00:48:07,133
Girl. Beach. Sand. Surf. Moonlight.
Did you ever see {y:i}Here to Eternity?

742
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,971
You are right. We better get him.

743
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:16,889
- Thirty minutes. Then we call the cops.
- Not a second more.

744
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:19,848
Ladies, how are you?

745
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:31,763
Hi.

746
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:31,763
Hi.

747
00:48:40,999 --> 00:48:43,238
Are we allowed to talk or anything?

748
00:48:47,396 --> 00:48:49,595
Why did you leave the party?

749
00:48:49,675 --> 00:48:52,954
I just don't feel comfortable
with most of those people.

750
00:48:53,034 --> 00:48:57,792
I don't really know any of those people.
I just know, knew, know Bernie.

751
00:48:58,432 --> 00:49:01,231
Besides, I figure
I can thank Bernie tomorrow.

752
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:03,030
When there's more privacy.

753
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:07,868
- Where are we going?
- There's a beautiful view from up there.

754
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:09,947
Great.

755
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:20,263
Ever been in a lighthouse before?

756
00:49:20,303 --> 00:49:23,181
No, this is my first time. This is great.

757
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:27,780
Does anybody live up there?
A lighthouse keeper or someone?

758
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,418
No, It's all automated now. Come on.

759
00:49:33,257 --> 00:49:36,256
That takes some of the romance out of it.

760
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:38,935
Does it?

761
00:49:58,807 --> 00:50:00,366
- You all right?
- Yeah.

762
00:50:03,285 --> 00:50:05,684
You're right. This is beautiful.

763
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:10,322
My God.
You can see the whole island from up here.

764
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,679
I've always wondered
how these things work.

765
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:18,119
Richard, don't.

766
00:50:18,878 --> 00:50:21,237
- I can't see.
- Watch out for the trap...

767
00:50:23,077 --> 00:50:24,076
door.

768
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:30,833
Oh, my God.

769
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,469
- That one works.
- Richard.

770
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:43,308
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

771
00:50:43,388 --> 00:50:45,507
- Are you sure?
- I fell down a couple of stairs.

772
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:47,426
- Anything broken?
- Nothing's broken.

773
00:50:47,506 --> 00:50:50,305
- Are you sure?
- A little pain, but I'm all right.

774
00:50:50,385 --> 00:50:52,464
- I'm fine. How are you?
- I'm good.

775
00:50:52,824 --> 00:50:54,344
Here. Hold on.

776
00:50:54,424 --> 00:50:56,543
The good news is, I can see again.

777
00:51:00,461 --> 00:51:03,020
- I'm so sorry, Richard.
- No, it's okay, really.

778
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,979
I've always wanted a limp.

779
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:07,658
I must thank you.
This has been a great date.

780
00:51:07,738 --> 00:51:09,857
I hope my major medical covers it.

781
00:51:10,377 --> 00:51:11,377
What?

782
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:15,895
I'm sorry. I don't mean to laugh...

783
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:20,013
but the look on your face
when you fell through the trapdoor.

784
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:22,212
I think I've got a cracked rib.

785
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:25,091
- Do you want to sit down?
- No.

786
00:51:25,171 --> 00:51:29,009
No, I better not. The way things are going,
I'm gonna break my ass.

787
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:31,008
You'll be okay.

788
00:51:59,197 --> 00:52:02,115
I've had a crush on you
since the first day I saw you at work.

789
00:52:02,195 --> 00:52:03,635
I'm crazy about you.

790
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:08,513
This is so right.

791
00:52:10,592 --> 00:52:13,751
Oh, my God. This can't be happening to me.

792
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:17,589
It's happening to both of us.
You're right. It's so right.

793
00:52:17,669 --> 00:52:20,348
No. This isn't right, it's all wrong.
Not here in the sand.

794
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,867
- What?
- You deserve more than this.

795
00:52:21,947 --> 00:52:24,666
You need music, flowers, candles.
You need...

796
00:52:26,265 --> 00:52:28,265
You need to get out of here.

797
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:31,303
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm serious. You could catch a cold.

798
00:52:31,343 --> 00:52:33,342
- Where do you live?
- Dune Walk.

799
00:52:51,495 --> 00:52:52,974
Are you dead, too?

800
00:52:54,134 --> 00:52:55,893
Mister? Hello?

801
00:52:56,453 --> 00:52:58,732
Oh, Jesus. What is it with this place?

802
00:53:01,491 --> 00:53:03,770
How are you? Party's over.
You have to go home now.

803
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,569
- Where's Bernie?
- He's swimming.

804
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,368
I had a wonderful time.
I'm sorry I had to leave so early.

805
00:53:08,408 --> 00:53:10,967
Have fun. See you at the next one. Larry!

806
00:53:20,843 --> 00:53:22,562
Larry, are you in there?

807
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:25,561
- Come on out, Lar. Right now.
- Go away.

808
00:53:25,641 --> 00:53:27,200
I need to talk to you.

809
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,679
Can you just give me 30 seconds?

810
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:32,918
Bernie is waiting for us.

811
00:53:34,797 --> 00:53:38,475
- Look, Bernie isn't going anywhere, okay?
- I need you, Lar.

812
00:53:48,751 --> 00:53:49,951
Bernie, he needs you, too.

813
00:53:50,111 --> 00:53:51,070
Unbelievable.

814
00:54:02,186 --> 00:54:05,464
How am I supposed to know
that the tide is gonna come up that high?

815
00:54:05,504 --> 00:54:07,463
I don't want to talk about it.

816
00:54:07,543 --> 00:54:10,062
I don't understand why this is becoming
all my fault.

817
00:54:11,142 --> 00:54:13,821
- Did you invite somebody over?
- Of course not.

818
00:54:13,901 --> 00:54:14,980
Somebody's here.

819
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,819
Let's just shove him in the bedroom,
we'll say he's sleeping.

820
00:54:18,379 --> 00:54:20,898
Bernie, you cheat.

821
00:54:21,218 --> 00:54:22,457
Two-timer.

822
00:54:29,894 --> 00:54:31,293
Bernie, open up.

823
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:35,932
Darn you, Bernie.

824
00:54:36,611 --> 00:54:38,171
Don't do this to me.

825
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,809
Where the hell are you, you son of a bitch?

826
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:45,608
I got you now, you two-timing bastard.

827
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:51,045
Who the hell are you? Where's Bernie?

828
00:54:51,565 --> 00:54:53,604
We're Bernie's houseguests. Who are you?

829
00:54:53,684 --> 00:54:55,044
I'm his woman.

830
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,522
And I'll kill him if he's cheating on me.
Now, where the hell is he?

831
00:54:59,602 --> 00:55:02,081
And don't try to cover up for him, either.

832
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,959
- He's not here.
- Haven't seen him.

833
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:06,599
I don't believe you.

834
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:09,997
I'm gonna tear this place apart.

835
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:18,754
- That's his woman?
- I guess so.

836
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:31,588
Where the hell is he?

837
00:55:31,668 --> 00:55:34,347
- He's in the bedroom.
- Is that so?

838
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:37,346
He better be alone.

839
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:40,945
God damn it.

840
00:55:41,024 --> 00:55:42,544
Fun while it lasted, huh?

841
00:55:42,624 --> 00:55:45,783
What difference does it make,
we might as well get this over with.

842
00:55:45,822 --> 00:55:49,021
This is good. She discovers the body,
she calls the police.

843
00:55:49,101 --> 00:55:51,060
Fix me a drink, will you?

844
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,579
I hate it when they scream.

845
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:19,888
Oh, no!

846
00:56:31,963 --> 00:56:34,562
What gives? She has been up there, what,
10, 15 minutes?

847
00:56:34,922 --> 00:56:36,521
I don't get it.

848
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:08,868
Got a little scotch?

849
00:57:10,907 --> 00:57:11,987
Sure.

850
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:28,020
- Did everything go okay up there?
- Never been better.

851
00:57:33,178 --> 00:57:34,297
Good.

852
00:57:44,813 --> 00:57:48,731
How do you like that?
The guy gets laid more dead than I do alive.

853
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:51,370
No, she couldn't have.

854
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,169
He couldn't have.

855
00:57:54,849 --> 00:57:57,128
I get yelled at when I just lay there.

856
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:26,116
Vito, I'm telling you, Lomax is alive.
She was with him for at least half an hour...

857
00:58:26,516 --> 00:58:29,874
- in the bedroom.
{y:i}- What were they doing in the bedroom?

858
00:58:29,954 --> 00:58:31,913
I'd rather not say.

859
00:58:31,953 --> 00:58:34,073
{y:i}What the hell happened to Paulie?

860
00:58:34,153 --> 00:58:37,591
Yeah, maybe Paulie
is rustier than we thought, huh?

861
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:43,829
- What a night.
- Great, isn't it? It isn't over yet.

862
00:58:44,068 --> 00:58:47,147
It is for me. I'm dead. No offense, Bernie.

863
00:58:47,947 --> 00:58:49,786
I just gotta lie down for a minute.

864
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:53,664
Suit yourself. Whatever you like.
I'm going on to find the next party.

865
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:57,383
- Just wake me up when you get back.
- Okay, sure.

866
00:58:57,423 --> 00:58:59,862
- Whatever you like.
- Because I got to call the cops.

867
00:58:59,942 --> 00:59:03,061
- Of course you do. In the morning.
- I need a clear head.

868
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,900
Good night, buddy.

869
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:08,218
Don't forget. Wake me up.

870
00:59:14,336 --> 00:59:17,375
I made these a little sweeter this time.
Okay, Bernie?

871
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,053
God, it's glorious out, huh?

872
00:59:21,613 --> 00:59:23,212
Here we go, my friend.

873
00:59:24,452 --> 00:59:25,931
This should do it.

874
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:29,050
Okay.

875
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,249
How did you deal with?

876
00:59:32,328 --> 00:59:35,327
Oriental? I think I own that one.

877
00:59:36,127 --> 00:59:37,486
With hotel.

878
00:59:38,886 --> 00:59:40,525
$550.

879
00:59:40,565 --> 00:59:42,724
Give me $600, we'll call it square.

880
00:59:42,804 --> 00:59:44,483
Hey, Bernie, Larry.

881
00:59:44,603 --> 00:59:47,162
Great party last night, Bernie.
Your best ever.

882
00:59:47,242 --> 00:59:49,601
Ladies. Hello. How are you today?

883
00:59:49,681 --> 00:59:50,721
- Great.
- Fine.

884
00:59:50,801 --> 00:59:54,199
- Are we doing it again today?
- Absolutely. You know we are.

885
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,438
- Great. We'll see you later, guys.
- Bye-bye.

886
00:59:56,518 --> 00:59:58,797
Bye-bye, ladies. We'll see you later.

887
00:59:58,957 --> 01:00:00,637
Is this great or what?

888
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:03,915
Okay, coming out. My turn.

889
01:00:04,235 --> 01:00:05,435
Shooter now.

890
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:08,913
Yes! Free parking. $500 for me.

891
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:15,630
Bastard!

892
01:00:21,308 --> 01:00:24,787
I own it. Okay, that is $24...

893
01:00:24,907 --> 01:00:27,905
I own them all. $46, my friend. Call it $50.

894
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:30,784
Thank you. My turn. Here we go.

895
01:00:30,864 --> 01:00:32,463
Lucky seven coming out.

896
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:33,663
Shit.

897
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:38,701
One more you get out of jail free.
All right. Fine. Your turn. I'll roll.

898
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:40,420
Here we go. Coming out.

899
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:43,779
Community Chest.

900
01:00:45,378 --> 01:00:47,497
Second prize in a beauty contest.

901
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,936
- What are you doing?
- Playing Monopoly. You want to play?

902
01:00:50,976 --> 01:00:53,055
- No.
- Here we go.

903
01:00:53,815 --> 01:00:55,814
- How did he get down here?
- He walked.

904
01:00:55,894 --> 01:00:57,253
- He walked?
- Say good morning.

905
01:00:58,013 --> 01:01:00,972
Oh, God. You're just a sick man, Larry.

906
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:04,730
- What time is it?
- It's 11:30.

907
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,529
11:30?

908
01:01:07,209 --> 01:01:09,888
You let me sleep till 11:30? I have...

909
01:01:11,247 --> 01:01:13,646
- When did you get a Rolex?
- Oh, this.

910
01:01:16,485 --> 01:01:19,244
- Good God!
- He didn't need it anymore.

911
01:01:19,644 --> 01:01:22,643
That's it. We're gonna go to jail.
They're gonna arrest us.

912
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:26,361
- I'm calling the cops.
- I wanted to call them yesterday, my friend.

913
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:29,440
He's very upset. Richard, look.

914
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,718
Let me just say one thing here.
There's no reason to get pissy about this.

915
01:01:36,557 --> 01:01:37,676
Hello.

916
01:01:39,675 --> 01:01:41,595
- Richard?
- It's for you.

917
01:01:42,554 --> 01:01:44,394
- Gwen.
- Hi.

918
01:01:45,433 --> 01:01:47,272
What are you doing here?

919
01:01:47,672 --> 01:01:50,351
I just came by to talk to Bernie.
I didn't get a chance to last night, so...

920
01:01:51,431 --> 01:01:54,269
Oh, no. Bernie and I
are in a very big business meeting.

921
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:55,549
- Now?
- Yes.

922
01:01:55,589 --> 01:01:58,588
Bernie has such little time,
so can you come back later?

923
01:01:58,628 --> 01:02:01,386
Wait a minute.
What happened to Mr. Romantic?

924
01:02:01,466 --> 01:02:05,425
- Candlelight? Flowers?
- I know. But Bernie is tied up right now.

925
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:10,383
- It's a bad time.
- What is going on, Richard?

926
01:02:10,463 --> 01:02:12,822
Okay. I'll tell you.

927
01:02:12,902 --> 01:02:15,461
I probably shouldn't,
I know I shouldn't, but...

928
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:18,499
at this point, why not? Mr. Lomax is...

929
01:02:27,136 --> 01:02:30,095
my boss. I work for him
at the insurance company.

930
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:35,252
Bernie, you're starting to peel.

931
01:02:35,492 --> 01:02:37,651
Better get you out of the sun, huh?

932
01:02:39,731 --> 01:02:41,050
Here we go.

933
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:47,767
We were really looking forward
to coming out here...

934
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,766
when we got here, Mr. Lomax...

935
01:02:50,406 --> 01:02:51,766
Bernie was...

936
01:02:53,925 --> 01:02:54,924
dead.

937
01:02:57,323 --> 01:02:58,403
Dead.

938
01:02:58,603 --> 01:03:01,761
Like your mother and father were dead.
And your aunt is dead, too?

939
01:03:01,841 --> 01:03:02,841
Different kind of dead.

940
01:03:16,035 --> 01:03:18,514
You son of a bitch. I got you.

941
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:27,151
Then how come I saw Bernie
with you and your friend at the party?

942
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:30,110
Because...

943
01:03:32,469 --> 01:03:34,028
You don't believe me?

944
01:03:35,867 --> 01:03:38,346
Okay, I'm gonna prove it to you. Come on.

945
01:03:38,506 --> 01:03:39,946
This is not going to be fun.

946
01:03:50,141 --> 01:03:52,300
I know you think I'm crazy, but...

947
01:03:57,058 --> 01:03:58,058
Well?

948
01:03:59,617 --> 01:04:00,977
Where is Bernie?

949
01:04:01,497 --> 01:04:02,736
Oh, hello.

950
01:04:03,776 --> 01:04:05,975
- Where's Bernie?
- He went for more daiquiri mix.

951
01:04:06,055 --> 01:04:07,334
No, he didn't.

952
01:04:07,414 --> 01:04:10,213
Richard, I don't know what
this game is you're playing...

953
01:04:10,293 --> 01:04:12,012
but this is ridiculous.

954
01:04:12,092 --> 01:04:14,851
- I'm out of here.
- Gwen, I'm not playing any games with you.

955
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:17,410
I'm telling you the truth! Bernie is here.

956
01:04:18,809 --> 01:04:20,569
Where is Bernie?

957
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:23,328
What, you bastard, did you do with Bernie?

958
01:04:27,926 --> 01:04:29,645
I'm phoning the police.

959
01:04:35,962 --> 01:04:38,761
There's no dial tone. With 97 buttons...

960
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,639
{y:i}- Where is your house?
- Where is the off button?

961
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:46,678
{y:i}Look, Paulie, just don't kill them
{y:i}while I'm around.

962
01:04:46,918 --> 01:04:49,876
{y:i}- Bernie, we're on a phone here.
{y:i}- You're right.

963
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:52,435
- Play that back.
- I just got it stopped.

964
01:04:52,515 --> 01:04:54,115
Play it back, please.

965
01:04:55,234 --> 01:04:58,353
{y:i}Hey, Lomax, it's Paulie.
{y:i}I just got to the island.

966
01:04:58,913 --> 01:04:59,872
{y:i}You're early.

967
01:04:59,952 --> 01:05:02,351
{y:i}Those two schmucks
{y:i}won't come until the 6:00 ferry...

968
01:05:02,391 --> 01:05:05,110
{y:i}- and I still have to plant the note.
{y:i}- Yeah.

969
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:08,749
{y:i}- Where is your house?
{y:i}- It's on the point, top of the dune.

970
01:05:09,308 --> 01:05:10,868
{y:i}Look, Paulie...

971
01:05:11,188 --> 01:05:14,706
{y:i}- don't kill them while I'm around.
{y:i}- Bernie, we're on the phone here.

972
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,705
{y:i}You're right. I'm sorry.

973
01:05:16,785 --> 01:05:19,824
{y:i}The point is, I just want to be
{y:i}back in New York with an alibi.

974
01:05:19,904 --> 01:05:21,383
{y:i}Don't worry about it.

975
01:05:25,742 --> 01:05:27,621
We were on the 6:00 ferry.

976
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,099
And we're two schmucks.

977
01:05:34,058 --> 01:05:36,217
- Kill us?
- Lomax?

978
01:05:36,817 --> 01:05:39,416
Bernie is gonna have us killed?

979
01:05:39,976 --> 01:05:41,095
Kill us?

980
01:05:42,415 --> 01:05:43,894
- Why?
- I don't know.

981
01:05:47,053 --> 01:05:50,411
Unless he's the one
whose been stealing from the company.

982
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:53,890
Son of a bitch. He's gonna kill me!

983
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,209
I liked the guy.

984
01:05:57,169 --> 01:05:58,248
Okay.

985
01:05:58,408 --> 01:06:00,847
He said something about a note, right?

986
01:06:00,927 --> 01:06:03,406
- I know, Richard.
- Let's find it.

987
01:06:21,318 --> 01:06:23,358
Bernie, you lying swine.

988
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:31,794
Holy crap!

989
01:06:32,234 --> 01:06:33,393
What?

990
01:06:43,189 --> 01:06:46,268
- There's a $100,000 here easy.
- This is the note. Listen.

991
01:06:46,348 --> 01:06:49,867
"Richard Parker and I
stole this money from the company...

992
01:06:49,867 --> 01:06:52,785
- "to pay for my sex change operation."
- What?

993
01:06:52,865 --> 01:06:54,545
That's what it says.

994
01:06:54,985 --> 01:06:59,543
"Now he tells me he loves someone else.
I can't live with that, and neither will he."

995
01:06:59,743 --> 01:07:01,662
It's got my name on it.

996
01:07:03,141 --> 01:07:04,621
Oh, God.

997
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:09,538
Son of a bitch. It's not bad enough
that he's trying to kill me...

998
01:07:09,618 --> 01:07:11,977
now he's turning me into a drag queen.

999
01:07:13,177 --> 01:07:15,496
Why couldn't he say
you were having the operation?

1000
01:07:15,576 --> 01:07:17,975
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter, Richard.

1001
01:07:18,015 --> 01:07:21,374
- I've a reputation to protect here.
- For Christ's sakes, Larry!

1002
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,532
No one is going
to have a sex change operation.

1003
01:07:26,811 --> 01:07:28,211
Oh, yeah!

1004
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:29,890
I got to call the cops.

1005
01:07:31,729 --> 01:07:34,408
{y:i}- Operator.
- Operator, the police, please.

1006
01:07:34,808 --> 01:07:37,967
{y:i}You mean Ed?
{y:i}He's out on the beach somewhere.

1007
01:07:38,127 --> 01:07:41,445
When do you expect Ed back?
It's a bit of an emergency.

1008
01:07:41,525 --> 01:07:44,404
{y:i}I don't know. Wanna leave a message?

1009
01:07:44,484 --> 01:07:45,923
- Yeah. Help!
{y:i}- Okay.

1010
01:07:46,003 --> 01:07:47,843
Let's get out of here.

1011
01:07:48,322 --> 01:07:51,601
We have to get off this island,
and maybe not get killed doing it.

1012
01:07:51,681 --> 01:07:55,439
- Wait a minute.
- Tell me you have a brilliant idea.

1013
01:07:55,719 --> 01:07:57,838
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

1014
01:07:57,918 --> 01:08:01,957
Lomax told whoever he was talking to
not to kill us if he's around, right?

1015
01:08:02,037 --> 01:08:04,796
But Lomax is dead.
He isn't around anybody anymore.

1016
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:07,035
I know that. You know that.

1017
01:08:08,354 --> 01:08:09,953
Nobody else knows that.

1018
01:08:10,793 --> 01:08:11,833
Where's Bernie?

1019
01:08:13,992 --> 01:08:15,351
Right there.

1020
01:08:16,231 --> 01:08:17,670
There's no Bernie.

1021
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:20,989
He's gotta to be, Rich.
I dumped him here myself.

1022
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:22,228
Where is he?

1023
01:08:23,588 --> 01:08:25,067
- Larry.
- What?

1024
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,866
- Excuse me.
- Hey, kid.

1025
01:08:28,945 --> 01:08:30,745
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?

1026
01:08:30,825 --> 01:08:32,464
- You little brat!
- What are you doing?

1027
01:08:32,544 --> 01:08:34,183
Get out of there.

1028
01:08:34,223 --> 01:08:36,662
- What the hell are you doing?
- You can't do that.

1029
01:08:36,742 --> 01:08:38,462
This is private property.

1030
01:08:39,221 --> 01:08:41,140
- You're talking to me?
- Yeah.

1031
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,499
- Shut up.
- Who are you... You lousy...

1032
01:08:45,179 --> 01:08:47,778
You better be gone by the time we get there.

1033
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:50,896
- Scram! Get out of here!
- You little bastard.

1034
01:08:51,296 --> 01:08:53,455
How'd you like to kiss this?

1035
01:08:53,655 --> 01:08:55,574
- We have bigger problems.
- Kiss my ass.

1036
01:08:55,654 --> 01:08:58,973
- What kind of home training is that?
- He buried all of Bernie.

1037
01:08:59,053 --> 01:09:00,093
Jesus.

1038
01:09:00,492 --> 01:09:01,452
Come on.

1039
01:09:20,804 --> 01:09:25,322
- Good thing for you, you're dead, pal.
- I actually felt sorry for you, you rat shit.

1040
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:27,361
He looks good enough. Let's go.

1041
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:29,520
- Larry.
- What?

1042
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,119
Jesus.

1043
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,198
I never knew he wore a toupee.
You can hardly tell.

1044
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:38,756
Who cares? What are we gonna do about it?
We can't take him out like this.

1045
01:09:38,836 --> 01:09:41,675
The killer might not know it's Bernie
and shoot us.

1046
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:49,232
- So long, Lar, it has been fun but not really.
- Goodbye, Rich.

1047
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,828
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is...

1048
01:10:00,108 --> 01:10:01,147
Jesus.

1049
01:10:01,267 --> 01:10:03,826
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is...

1050
01:10:10,503 --> 01:10:12,063
You little bastard.

1051
01:10:13,902 --> 01:10:16,461
- Get back here, you little monster.
- Never mind him.

1052
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:18,300
I'm gonna rip your gums out!

1053
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:22,058
- I'm gonna get that little kid.
- What are we gonna do with Bernie?

1054
01:10:22,778 --> 01:10:23,738
Oh, boy.

1055
01:10:24,298 --> 01:10:27,296
Come on, Bernie. Up.

1056
01:10:30,335 --> 01:10:32,254
Put it on him.

1057
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:34,973
Brilliant.

1058
01:10:39,011 --> 01:10:41,131
- Sambuca on the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

1059
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:53,046
Here we go. Ready. Up.

1060
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:57,564
You take him down. I'll get the cart.

1061
01:11:12,797 --> 01:11:14,277
Hey, Bernie!

1062
01:11:16,596 --> 01:11:17,915
Bernie, wait a minute.

1063
01:11:17,995 --> 01:11:20,514
- That guy talking to us?
- Who cares? Get out of here.

1064
01:11:20,594 --> 01:11:22,593
Bernie, I've got to talk to you.

1065
01:11:23,473 --> 01:11:24,912
Bernie, come on.

1066
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,510
- Hey, Bernie. Looking good.
- Hi.

1067
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:32,749
- Hi, Bernie.
- Hello.

1068
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:36,707
- Great party last night, Bern.
- How are you?

1069
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:40,186
Bernie, I've got to talk to you.

1070
01:11:40,266 --> 01:11:41,865
Jesus. He's behind us.

1071
01:11:43,105 --> 01:11:45,064
Shit! Is that the killer?

1072
01:11:45,144 --> 01:11:47,383
How do I know, Richard?
Should I stop and ask him?

1073
01:11:47,463 --> 01:11:49,022
No. Just drive. Just go.

1074
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:50,982
Bernie, I gotta talk to you.

1075
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:54,180
- Doesn't this thing go any faster?
- This is it.

1076
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,939
We gotta talk.

1077
01:11:59,178 --> 01:12:00,658
What about our arrangement?

1078
01:12:00,737 --> 01:12:02,737
Come on, Larry. Move it.

1079
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:14,492
Hey, Bernie. The Maserati.
I painted it black for you.

1080
01:12:15,371 --> 01:12:16,851
The Maserati!

1081
01:12:21,409 --> 01:12:22,768
Ferry's gonna leave.

1082
01:12:22,848 --> 01:12:25,727
Hold it. Wait. Stop this for a second.

1083
01:12:27,686 --> 01:12:29,006
Let's go.

1084
01:12:29,086 --> 01:12:32,884
Rich, grab him. Grab a leg.

1085
01:12:32,964 --> 01:12:34,843
Wait.

1086
01:12:34,963 --> 01:12:38,242
We can't just drag him in.
He's got to look like he's alive.

1087
01:12:39,721 --> 01:12:40,721
Idea.

1088
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:53,556
Your right leg on three, ready?
Here we go. One, two, three, go.

1089
01:12:53,636 --> 01:12:54,795
Hold the boat!

1090
01:12:54,835 --> 01:12:56,474
Got it? Hold the boat.

1091
01:12:56,554 --> 01:12:58,673
Hold that boat.

1092
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:02,392
Hold it.

1093
01:13:02,552 --> 01:13:03,871
- Hi, Bern.
- How are you doing?

1094
01:13:03,951 --> 01:13:05,870
Hold the boat!

1095
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,389
Hold the boat, please.

1096
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:11,388
Hold on. We'll be right there.

1097
01:13:13,107 --> 01:13:14,707
We're coming.

1098
01:13:18,465 --> 01:13:19,665
Come on, Bern.

1099
01:13:22,823 --> 01:13:24,903
Hold it. Hold the boat.

1100
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:28,141
Shit! What do we do?

1101
01:13:29,261 --> 01:13:30,500
Stop the boat.

1102
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,978
Look at this fool.
He wants to get off, we want to get on.

1103
01:13:35,058 --> 01:13:36,898
- I'm gonna kill you.
- What?

1104
01:13:36,978 --> 01:13:39,736
You don't have to worry about
anybody else murdering you...

1105
01:13:39,816 --> 01:13:41,815
because I'll do it. This was all your fault.

1106
01:13:41,895 --> 01:13:44,414
- We'll die on this crummy island.
- Let me remind you...

1107
01:13:44,494 --> 01:13:46,973
you're the one who did the extra work
on the computer.

1108
01:13:47,053 --> 01:13:49,292
If it wasn't for me
you'd be fired six months ago.

1109
01:13:49,372 --> 01:13:51,052
You can't even work the coffee machine.

1110
01:13:51,132 --> 01:13:54,730
A little brownnosing, ass kissing,
to work our way up that corporate ladder.

1111
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:57,249
Why can't you be a lazy shit like I am?

1112
01:13:58,329 --> 01:14:01,008
Somebody talk to the captain.

1113
01:14:01,647 --> 01:14:03,127
I've got to get off the boat.

1114
01:14:03,207 --> 01:14:04,806
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

1115
01:14:04,886 --> 01:14:06,165
Please.

1116
01:14:08,884 --> 01:14:10,803
Somebody talk to the captain.

1117
01:14:12,683 --> 01:14:15,761
- I'm sorry, but we're still gonna die.
- Not if Bernie's with us.

1118
01:14:15,841 --> 01:14:17,920
Great, I hope the killer keeps that in mind.

1119
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,359
Larry, please tell me
how we're going to get off this island.

1120
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:22,998
- We got a boat.
- What boat?

1121
01:14:23,078 --> 01:14:24,438
Lomax's boat.

1122
01:14:24,638 --> 01:14:27,157
- Tawny brought the keys back, remember?
- Right. Okay.

1123
01:14:27,237 --> 01:14:29,396
You go and get them,
I'll stay here with Bernie.

1124
01:14:29,476 --> 01:14:31,115
I'm not going anywhere without Bernie.

1125
01:14:31,195 --> 01:14:33,554
You go back, get the keys.
I'll stay with Bernie.

1126
01:14:33,634 --> 01:14:36,753
We'll all go back to the house.
We'll all get the goddamn keys.

1127
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:38,952
- We'll all stay with Bernie.
- Fine.

1128
01:14:40,311 --> 01:14:41,271
Hurry up.

1129
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:43,830
Move it.

1130
01:14:46,029 --> 01:14:47,348
Hold up.

1131
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:49,307
Okay. The keys.

1132
01:14:49,987 --> 01:14:52,026
- Here they are.
- Got it. Let's go.

1133
01:14:52,106 --> 01:14:53,586
Oh, my God, Richard!

1134
01:14:55,425 --> 01:14:57,024
It's the killer.

1135
01:14:59,063 --> 01:15:00,383
Get the door.

1136
01:15:02,102 --> 01:15:03,262
Quiet.

1137
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:06,420
- Lock it.
- I can't lock it.

1138
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:08,340
I only have a key to the boat.

1139
01:15:09,459 --> 01:15:10,539
Kitchen.

1140
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:13,817
- There's no door. Back door.
- Okay.

1141
01:15:15,537 --> 01:15:17,296
Don't panic.

1142
01:15:19,175 --> 01:15:20,894
Do something, Rich.

1143
01:15:21,174 --> 01:15:23,093
I got Bernie, you get the guy.

1144
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:26,212
Do something, Rich.

1145
01:15:27,052 --> 01:15:28,291
Get him, Rich.

1146
01:15:33,129 --> 01:15:35,608
You in here, Lomax? You little bastard.

1147
01:15:36,368 --> 01:15:37,487
You jerk.

1148
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:39,846
Kick me in the ass.

1149
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,685
It's my turn now.

1150
01:15:46,444 --> 01:15:47,683
Got him, Lar.

1151
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,080
There's another one.

1152
01:16:03,277 --> 01:16:04,596
He's got a knife.

1153
01:16:07,235 --> 01:16:08,395
Mr. Lomax.

1154
01:16:09,434 --> 01:16:10,674
What the hell?

1155
01:16:16,871 --> 01:16:19,550
- You can come out now, Rambo.
- You sure, Rich?

1156
01:16:21,269 --> 01:16:22,429
Good job.

1157
01:16:25,308 --> 01:16:27,627
- Two killers.
- Anybody could be the killer.

1158
01:16:27,707 --> 01:16:31,665
- Jesus, we gotta get rid of them.
- Let's shove them in the kitchen pantry.

1159
01:16:37,942 --> 01:16:40,661
I don't know why
I have to carry the heavy guy.

1160
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,700
Get his legs.

1161
01:16:45,579 --> 01:16:47,498
Larry, let me out.

1162
01:16:53,256 --> 01:16:54,655
Here comes Bernie.

1163
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:57,734
Coming through!

1164
01:16:59,174 --> 01:17:00,933
There it is. Stop.

1165
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:04,091
Hi, guys.

1166
01:17:05,531 --> 01:17:09,729
Ready? On three, here we go.
One, two, three.

1167
01:17:12,048 --> 01:17:13,288
Let's go.

1168
01:17:18,485 --> 01:17:19,845
Okay. Untie us.

1169
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:23,603
Okay?

1170
01:17:25,043 --> 01:17:27,522
- Give me the keys.
- Have you ever driven a boat before?

1171
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:29,321
I was born on a boat.

1172
01:17:36,398 --> 01:17:37,917
This is a fancy boat.

1173
01:17:42,755 --> 01:17:44,275
- Push something.
- I am, Richard.

1174
01:17:44,355 --> 01:17:45,674
- Nothing's happening.
- I know.

1175
01:17:45,754 --> 01:17:47,873
- Push something else.
- Something's happening.

1176
01:17:47,953 --> 01:17:50,432
Something's definitely
happening here, huh?

1177
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:53,791
Wait a minute, hold on.

1178
01:17:53,871 --> 01:17:55,910
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?

1179
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:58,669
- I know it's here.
- Just keep pressing those buttons.

1180
01:17:59,029 --> 01:18:01,428
I'm pressing. I pressed that button.

1181
01:18:01,588 --> 01:18:03,667
- Nothing is happening, Larry.
- I know that.

1182
01:18:03,747 --> 01:18:06,146
- Did you try the key?
- Don't insult my intelligence.

1183
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:07,625
- Try the key again.
- Fine.

1184
01:18:07,705 --> 01:18:09,104
See that?

1185
01:18:09,224 --> 01:18:11,623
- Here we go!
- We're going home. Give it some gas now.

1186
01:18:11,663 --> 01:18:12,903
Giving it gas.

1187
01:18:15,022 --> 01:18:16,581
Gas.

1188
01:18:16,661 --> 01:18:18,980
- Nothing's happening.
- More gas.

1189
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,420
A little more gas.

1190
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:22,339
We're not moving. Why aren't we moving?

1191
01:18:22,419 --> 01:18:23,698
I don't know.

1192
01:18:24,258 --> 01:18:28,416
- Larry, you said you've done this before.
- It's different than my boat, okay?

1193
01:18:28,456 --> 01:18:30,016
Don't panic.

1194
01:18:30,256 --> 01:18:31,775
Stop the boat, Larry.

1195
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:34,174
Stop!

1196
01:18:38,692 --> 01:18:39,972
Back it up.

1197
01:18:41,931 --> 01:18:43,210
We got it.

1198
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:45,090
- What's going on?
- That's illegal.

1199
01:18:45,169 --> 01:18:48,288
- What you're doing is illegal.
- You have a nice day now.

1200
01:18:48,568 --> 01:18:49,808
Are you nuts?

1201
01:18:52,326 --> 01:18:55,725
- Got it now. Moving forward. Hold on.
- Oh, shit!

1202
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,642
Sorry, Rich. Coming back.

1203
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:06,760
Coming around.

1204
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:11,039
Why is this happening to me?

1205
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:12,278
Coming back.

1206
01:19:17,076 --> 01:19:19,875
- Here we are.
- Stop the boat. Idiot.

1207
01:19:20,115 --> 01:19:21,754
Stop the boat!

1208
01:19:24,113 --> 01:19:27,032
- Where are the brakes?
- Boats don't have brakes, Captain.

1209
01:19:27,112 --> 01:19:29,751
You're kidding. How do they stop?

1210
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,230
Throw the anchor.

1211
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,390
The anchor, throw it.

1212
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:34,549
- They're headed for us.
- Here we go.

1213
01:19:34,629 --> 01:19:36,508
Whatever you're doing, don't.

1214
01:19:38,227 --> 01:19:39,267
Sorry.

1215
01:19:43,785 --> 01:19:45,225
You broke my watch.

1216
01:19:45,584 --> 01:19:46,944
Mine still works.

1217
01:19:47,024 --> 01:19:49,223
You better put that thing
back on the dead body.

1218
01:19:49,303 --> 01:19:50,982
Drive the boat, Richard.

1219
01:19:51,062 --> 01:19:54,061
The cops are gonna take
our fat heads to jail.

1220
01:19:54,501 --> 01:19:57,339
My God. Look at them.

1221
01:19:57,379 --> 01:19:59,059
Ladies, how are you?

1222
01:19:59,459 --> 01:20:01,898
Hello, Betty.

1223
01:20:02,058 --> 01:20:04,976
God! Just once, I'd like a woman like that.

1224
01:20:05,296 --> 01:20:06,376
Let's party.

1225
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:14,093
Turn the boat.

1226
01:20:17,491 --> 01:20:19,370
Watch the fishermen.

1227
01:20:26,527 --> 01:20:28,726
- Watch the wake!
- Duck!

1228
01:20:28,806 --> 01:20:30,486
Watch the wake, Richard!

1229
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:42,041
This is tougher than it looks.

1230
01:20:42,161 --> 01:20:44,080
You're doing very well, Richard.

1231
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,279
- Sorry I snapped at you.
- It's okay.

1232
01:20:46,359 --> 01:20:48,678
I've never been chased by a killer before.

1233
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:51,077
It's all right. You're doing very well.

1234
01:20:52,876 --> 01:20:55,955
- Why is everybody waving at us?
- I'm popular.

1235
01:20:56,035 --> 01:20:57,035
I see.

1236
01:20:57,115 --> 01:20:59,074
Hey, Bernie, showing off again?

1237
01:21:01,993 --> 01:21:04,711
Oh, God. What the hell are those things?

1238
01:21:05,551 --> 01:21:08,310
Those are obviously channel markers.

1239
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:09,789
Obviously.

1240
01:21:09,869 --> 01:21:12,788
Okay, wise ass, do you know
what side I'm supposed to pass on?

1241
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,747
That I don't know. Just stay close.
What else can happen here?

1242
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:17,146
I've got no idea.

1243
01:21:17,746 --> 01:21:20,225
- Serpentine.
- Is that close enough?

1244
01:21:21,904 --> 01:21:23,504
Do you hear something?

1245
01:21:25,343 --> 01:21:27,022
- There it's again.
- Yeah.

1246
01:21:27,462 --> 01:21:29,741
- I wonder what that is.
- What is that?

1247
01:21:35,539 --> 01:21:37,218
- Man overboard.
- What?

1248
01:21:37,298 --> 01:21:38,577
Stop the boat.

1249
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:43,216
He's got nice form.

1250
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:49,733
- I don't know.
- I'm trying to drive a boat.

1251
01:21:49,813 --> 01:21:52,652
- You're doing well.
- Trying to get us off this island of hell.

1252
01:21:52,692 --> 01:21:54,771
You had maybe one job to do.
Watch a dead body.

1253
01:21:54,851 --> 01:21:57,330
- Well, let's not argue about it.
- Jesus.

1254
01:21:58,449 --> 01:22:01,448
- You were the one who tied him up.
- Don't blame this all on me.

1255
01:22:01,528 --> 01:22:03,567
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1256
01:22:04,007 --> 01:22:05,726
You've lost my sunglasses.

1257
01:22:21,839 --> 01:22:23,319
What are you doing?

1258
01:22:24,758 --> 01:22:26,278
I haven't got a clue.

1259
01:22:27,957 --> 01:22:29,476
I don't believe this.

1260
01:22:29,996 --> 01:22:31,156
What?

1261
01:22:33,155 --> 01:22:34,474
We're out of gas.

1262
01:22:37,433 --> 01:22:39,912
Paddling in the Atlantic Ocean...

1263
01:22:40,192 --> 01:22:42,791
- on a dead body.
- I'm getting swimmer's ear.

1264
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,990
This is now the perfect weekend.

1265
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:49,468
It started when I almost broke my leg
jumping on a moving ferry.

1266
01:22:49,828 --> 01:22:53,666
I get to this beautiful beach and my host...
Sorry, he's dead.

1267
01:22:55,745 --> 01:22:57,065
Hampton Island.

1268
01:22:58,824 --> 01:23:01,343
Checkers. Excuse me, sir.
Is this your launch?

1269
01:23:01,423 --> 01:23:03,662
- Come on, let's go.
- Don't rush.

1270
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:08,260
Come on.

1271
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:11,459
- Can you put a little snap in it, fellows?
- Okay, Cappy.

1272
01:23:17,017 --> 01:23:18,776
Hold on, you damn fool.

1273
01:23:19,056 --> 01:23:22,734
I fell down a lighthouse.
I had a corpse wash up...

1274
01:23:22,814 --> 01:23:24,134
next to me on the shore.

1275
01:23:24,214 --> 01:23:28,492
And then I find out that my dead boss
is not only a thief, he wants to kill me.

1276
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:35,809
I almost drown.

1277
01:23:36,009 --> 01:23:38,887
The girl of my dreams
now thinks I'm a raving lunatic.

1278
01:23:38,967 --> 01:23:40,767
You mean what's-her-name?

1279
01:23:41,686 --> 01:23:44,205
And, now, we're going back
to the house of death.

1280
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:46,444
- Great weekend, huh?
- Great weekend!

1281
01:23:47,484 --> 01:23:50,003
Just get here as fast as you can.
Thanks, Ed.

1282
01:23:50,243 --> 01:23:51,282
Police is on the way.

1283
01:23:51,362 --> 01:23:53,921
Can just lock ourselves in
until they get here?

1284
01:23:54,001 --> 01:23:56,400
I hate it when he stares at me like that.

1285
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,800
Let's go.

1286
01:24:00,478 --> 01:24:02,158
Put him in his bathroom.

1287
01:24:05,556 --> 01:24:08,195
- Bernie's picked up a little weight.
- What do you expect?

1288
01:24:08,275 --> 01:24:10,274
He's been soaking in the ocean
for two hours.

1289
01:24:10,354 --> 01:24:11,714
Made a damn good float though.

1290
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:17,991
Are you in here?

1291
01:24:32,385 --> 01:24:33,825
It's Gwen.

1292
01:24:35,344 --> 01:24:36,583
Hi, Gwen.

1293
01:24:36,623 --> 01:24:39,382
You've got to be the weirdest guy
I've ever met.

1294
01:24:39,982 --> 01:24:42,021
You told me Bernie was dead, right?

1295
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:43,940
I just saw you with him.

1296
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,060
What's your explanation this time?

1297
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,179
I don't mean to be rude,
but get the hell out of here.

1298
01:24:48,778 --> 01:24:51,017
No, I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what is going on.

1299
01:24:51,097 --> 01:24:52,097
Listen to me!

1300
01:24:52,177 --> 01:24:55,456
You're in danger here,
leave unless you want to get shot.

1301
01:24:56,455 --> 01:24:59,214
Lomax is dead,
somebody is trying to kill us.

1302
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:02,293
Can we stay at your house
until the cops come or what?

1303
01:25:04,692 --> 01:25:06,211
It's just Bernie.

1304
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:13,048
Gwen, listen to me.

1305
01:25:13,128 --> 01:25:16,207
We didn't do this to him.
Do we look like we could kill someone?

1306
01:25:16,287 --> 01:25:18,526
Honey, have a drink, relax. You'll be fine.

1307
01:25:18,566 --> 01:25:21,325
Let me rephrase that.
Do I look like I could kill someone?

1308
01:25:21,405 --> 01:25:23,124
What is going on in there?

1309
01:25:27,882 --> 01:25:30,761
- Which one of you bastards hit me?
- Son of a bitch.

1310
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,519
You want to get your butt kicked?

1311
01:25:39,597 --> 01:25:40,877
I can explain.

1312
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:58,629
Company.

1313
01:26:02,068 --> 01:26:04,867
I didn't see anything.
I was looking at my watch.

1314
01:26:05,507 --> 01:26:06,666
I'm blind.

1315
01:26:14,823 --> 01:26:16,102
It's empty.

1316
01:26:17,182 --> 01:26:19,421
That's right. But this ain't.

1317
01:26:23,539 --> 01:26:24,579
Run!

1318
01:26:24,739 --> 01:26:25,938
Move it! This way!

1319
01:26:29,177 --> 01:26:30,176
It's locked.

1320
01:26:30,256 --> 01:26:32,655
What are you doing?
We're friends of Bernie's.

1321
01:26:32,735 --> 01:26:34,415
I hate Bernie's friends.

1322
01:26:40,052 --> 01:26:41,052
This way.

1323
01:26:42,011 --> 01:26:43,491
To the bedroom.

1324
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:46,809
Come on, let's go. Up.

1325
01:26:47,049 --> 01:26:49,488
You're dead meat, you little bastards.

1326
01:26:54,206 --> 01:26:55,806
Now I'm really mad!

1327
01:26:56,325 --> 01:26:57,685
Wait.

1328
01:26:57,765 --> 01:27:01,243
- What?
- You take Gwen, you go hide...

1329
01:27:01,323 --> 01:27:04,402
I'll let him chase me,
you try and call the cops, okay?

1330
01:27:04,642 --> 01:27:06,961
Okay? That's it? No arguments?

1331
01:27:07,881 --> 01:27:10,160
I'll get you all, one by one.

1332
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,399
There's no place to hide.

1333
01:27:27,153 --> 01:27:28,752
I'm gonna die.

1334
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,944
You kicked me, you bastard.

1335
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:50,943
Shit! Out of bullets.

1336
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:22,929
Sit the hell down.

1337
01:28:27,288 --> 01:28:28,607
Hang on, Lar.

1338
01:28:30,926 --> 01:28:33,565
- Coming.
- I got him.

1339
01:28:37,763 --> 01:28:38,923
Get off.

1340
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:41,242
- Hang on, Lar.
- I got him.

1341
01:28:41,522 --> 01:28:45,200
Stand up. Fight like a man.
Come on. Put them up, you chicken.

1342
01:28:48,799 --> 01:28:50,278
Watch this, Richard.

1343
01:28:58,075 --> 01:28:59,594
All right, Lar.

1344
01:29:06,671 --> 01:29:08,431
Fists of steel.

1345
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,269
Bernie, let go of me.

1346
01:29:13,109 --> 01:29:14,868
I always liked you, Bernie.

1347
01:29:19,306 --> 01:29:20,665
I got it, thanks.

1348
01:29:20,825 --> 01:29:23,304
Just a little closer. Just get the two of us.

1349
01:29:23,384 --> 01:29:25,184
Get the handshake in, okay?

1350
01:29:25,423 --> 01:29:29,262
Wait a minute. I think I blinked. Did I blink?
I think I blinked a second there.

1351
01:29:29,342 --> 01:29:31,501
- He blinked.
- He blinked. I saw him.

1352
01:29:31,581 --> 01:29:33,140
Make sure he's wrapped up good.

1353
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:34,460
Wait a minute.

1354
01:29:37,259 --> 01:29:39,338
I didn't kill him. He's not dead.

1355
01:29:40,137 --> 01:29:41,657
I tried to kill him.

1356
01:29:43,096 --> 01:29:44,775
Look at him. He's alive.

1357
01:29:45,295 --> 01:29:47,574
- He's not dead. He's alive.
- Move it.

1358
01:29:47,614 --> 01:29:49,573
That man is alive!

1359
01:29:50,733 --> 01:29:51,813
Now what?

1360
01:29:53,172 --> 01:29:54,691
Now I'm gonna take a week off.

1361
01:29:54,771 --> 01:29:57,730
You're taking a vacation?
The man who won't take a coffee break?

1362
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:00,369
Gwen just invited me to stay with her.
What should I say?

1363
01:30:00,449 --> 01:30:03,768
You're kidding me. You invited him?
You fool. That's fabulous.

1364
01:30:03,808 --> 01:30:05,967
You deserve it, Richard.
The company owes you.

1365
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:08,366
Just a couple of days
until Gwen leaves for school.

1366
01:30:08,446 --> 01:30:11,164
There's plenty of room
if you want to stay, Lar.

1367
01:30:12,524 --> 01:30:15,962
Me? Oh, no, thanks.
I'll just tough it out here at Bernie's.

1368
01:30:16,042 --> 01:30:19,201
I hear the party Saturday night is
better than Friday, actually.

1369
01:30:24,439 --> 01:30:25,758
What is going on?

1370
01:30:26,438 --> 01:30:29,597
- What's happened?
- Didn't you hear? Bernie Lomax got killed.

1371
01:30:29,677 --> 01:30:30,996
- No.
- Yeah.

1372
01:30:31,076 --> 01:30:33,515
- Did you go to that party last night?
- No.

1373
01:30:33,715 --> 01:30:36,154
Lawrence, you done real good.
I'm proud of you.

1374
01:30:36,474 --> 01:30:39,433
Yeah, I did okay, huh? Surprised myself.

1375
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:42,072
You did great, Rich.

1376
01:30:50,348 --> 01:30:53,307
Hi, Bernie. See you at the party tonight.

1377
01:30:53,867 --> 01:30:55,066
What?

1378
01:30:56,905 --> 01:30:59,105
What did she say?

1379
01:31:05,942 --> 01:31:08,101
Mister, can I bury you?

1380
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:11,140
Great!
