2
00:00:29,103 --> 00:00:30,536
-Hello?
-So what do you think?

3
00:00:30,638 --> 00:00:32,799
-About what?
-About tomorrow.

4
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,397
lt's our first day of high school.

5
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:37,944
lf we want to be popular,
we just have to be proactive.

6
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:39,876
Calm your proactive ass down.

7
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,381
Saying you want to be popular
guarantees it isn't gonna happen.

8
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:46,044
I'm gonna get a girIfriend.
You think that's possibIe?

9
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:48,144
Anything's possibIe, Wade.

10
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:49,244
Just don't be needy.

11
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:51,847
<i>Y</i>ou got to let it come to you.
And one more thing.

12
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:55,393
From now on,
I don't want you caIIing me Ryan.

13
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:58,498
CaII me T-Dog.

14
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,933
-T-Dog?
-Yep.

15
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:04,264
-What does the ''T'' stand for?
-l don't know.

16
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:06,430
-But it sounds better than R-Dog.
-<i>Y</i>eah.

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,168
You know, Iike, if a hot girI
went up to you, and she goes,

18
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:13,303
''Hey, have you met T-Dog?
Man, did you see what T-Dog did today?

19
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:16,008
''Man, that T-Dog is crazy!''

20
00:01:16,116 --> 00:01:18,676
That sounds like a guy
every woman would want to know.

21
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:22,722
-Hey, do I need a nickname?
-You have one. SkeIetor.

22
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:25,724
That was Iast year.
I Iook good now. I'm fiIIing out.

23
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:28,158
AII right, name one part of your body
that fiIIed out, Wade.

24
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,787
Name one part of your body
that isn't fiIIed out, huh?

25
00:01:30,898 --> 00:01:32,331
I'm not trying to offend you.

26
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:34,924
l'm just saying you shot up too fast
and you're freakishly skinny.

27
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:37,299
Oh, yeah? WeII, you're too fat
and that's equaIIy unattractive.

28
00:01:37,404 --> 00:01:39,167
-You wanna go there?
-I'm sorry.

29
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:42,071
It's just, I want things to go weII,
you know?

30
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:44,770
-Sorry I said you're freakishIy skinny.
-It's okay.

31
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:46,209
<i>Y</i>ou just are.

32
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:49,509
Hey, go to sIeep!
It's 3:00 in the morning!

33
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:50,641
-What are you, crazy?
-Sorry.

34
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:51,740
-ls that your stepdad?
-No one.

35
00:01:51,852 --> 00:01:52,819
-Give me that phone! Give it!
-It's...

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,411
<i>Y</i>ou're in high school now.
Don't take his...

37
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:56,784
Go to sIeep.

38
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:01,056
How about some
chicks on the waIIs in here?

39
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,061
It's Iike a nerd paradise.

40
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:31,250
Time to make the donuts.

41
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:36,087
Hoo-rah!

42
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,259
Touchdown!

43
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:43,229
We won! We won the game!
And Wade Ioses again!

44
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,305
-Get out of my room!
-Dad said get up.

45
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:46,873
He's not my dad. He's your dad.

46
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:48,942
Fine, the guy who does your mom
says get up.

47
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,908
-Just Ieave!
-Loser!

48
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:57,874
Morning, sunshine. First day of schooI.

49
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,353
-Mom!
-Oh, my God!

50
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:02,285
Since when did you start
sIeeping naked?

51
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,119
I'm in high schooI now,
don't you remember?

52
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:08,092
I don't Iike eIastic squeezing
on my ass when I sIeep!

53
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:09,219
Okay.

54
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:13,326
Hey! What are you doing
in this shower?

55
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:16,562
Dawn? RacheI, that's right.
Nice to see you.

56
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,939
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

57
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,736
l'm the best white rapper
you've ever seen

58
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:26,572
A hair!

59
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:35,779
-Oh, my God!
-Look at that.

60
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,550
Thank you, Iadies!

61
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:44,690
What's up, winners? You stoked?
PedaI to the metaI?

62
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:45,787
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

63
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:46,866
AII right. Who's a winner?

64
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:47,956
-I am!
-I am!

65
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:49,057
Morning!

66
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:52,970
-Look at you, with your magic stick.
-What do you think?

67
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:54,631
Magic is stupid.

68
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:56,971
No, no, honey.

69
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:58,442
-Mom!
-What?

70
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:00,274
You forgot the sausages!

71
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:04,308
-I'II get the sausages.
-Come on. I'm hungry.

72
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,079
AII right, I'II get the sausages.

73
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:09,018
Excuse me, Iisten,
I'm reaIIy sorry to bother you.

74
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,715
My famiIy and I, we just ran out of gas

75
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:13,156
and we're trying to get to the kids
to SeaWorId.

76
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,888
And, I, Iike an idiot forgot my waIIet.
If I can just...

77
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:18,430
-Your Iegs work okay?
-Yeah, why?

78
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:20,625
You shouId waIk somewhere
and get a job.

79
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,395
-HaroId...
-I'II take care of it.

80
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:24,095
That's what I have, a job.

81
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:26,263
We'II get to SeaWorId
one way or the other.

82
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:29,740
We're on our way to church.
Maybe that's where you ought to go.

83
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:31,743
Thank you. Have a great day.

84
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:34,039
-Can you heIp out a veteran?
-Not today.

85
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,116
-Get away from the car.
-Honey, roII up the window.

86
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:37,274
Get away!

87
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:39,113
-What's your name?
-DriIIbit.

88
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:41,084
Listen, DriIIbit, I wasn't born yesterday.

89
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:45,318
I don't want you using this on
any marijuana or rye whiskey, okay?

90
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:47,986
-You got my word on it.
-You know what?

91
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,997
-I'm gonna write ''not for pot'' on there.
-You don't have to write.

92
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,226
Yeah. ''Not for pot.''

93
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:57,235
You're gonna feeI pretty siIIy if you try
to buy weed with that, won't you?

94
00:04:58,372 --> 00:05:00,067
Remember, put your best foot forward.

95
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,075
PeopIe decide what they think about you
in the first five seconds.

96
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,543
So, Iet me smeII your breath.

97
00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:06,635
Minty.

98
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:08,681
-You swipe on some deodorant?
-Yeah.

99
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:13,412
-You dust the nuts?
-No, Jim. I did not dust my nuts.

100
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,215
I'II never get tired of that one, Dad.

101
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:17,415
You know, you shouId hit the weights
with the boys and me.

102
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:19,617
-I'II pass.
-We'II get you in the gym.

103
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:22,718
We'II beef you up. Look at these guys.
Show them. Give him a gun shot.

104
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,388
Give him a crab.

105
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:26,989
Worship the sun.

106
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:29,763
-Yeah, Iook at these guys.
-They're freaks.

107
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,770
Not in my house!

108
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,030
-Have a great day.
-Okay, I Iove you, Dad.

109
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:37,235
l love you, too.
Have fun at school, Ryan. Bye.

110
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:44,782
-So what'd your dad say?
-He toId me to have fun.

111
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,216
Wow, great parenting.

112
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
I don't know how
we're surviving without him.

113
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,983
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

114
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:54,585
-He's a piece of shit, anyway.
-Thank you, honey.

115
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:00,493
-Enchanté.
-HeIIo.

116
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:04,164
You got room for two
in this IittIe speedster?

117
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:07,900
I am in a rush now. But I hostess up
at Moon Shadows on the one.

118
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:10,533
So if you get up there just, you know,
ask for me. I'm Jessica.

119
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:12,578
-Thanks, Jessica.
-Yeah.

120
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:14,579
'Cause our chef, Louis,
aIways makes too much chowder.

121
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:17,707
So he'II set you up with
a nice pIastic bowI of it out back.

122
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:23,556
-You're Iate today.
-Hey, get a job!

123
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:27,024
-You get a job.
-I aIready got one, giving money to you.

124
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,493
-How're you doing, Mrs. LampaneIIi?
-AII right.

125
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:33,259
-You Iook beautifuI today.
-You're a Iiar. But it works for me.

126
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,130
-Go on, get out of here, you nut!
-You earned it.

127
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:37,829
And don't spend it on food. Porn onIy!

128
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,301
First day of high schooI.

129
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:49,046
-It's kind of scary.
-Yeah, it sucks taking the bus.

130
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,519
Sure, Iast year we were the oIdest
so we got to sit in the back of the bus,

131
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,556
but now we'II probabIy have to sit
in the front with the Iosers.

132
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:00,651
We'II be aII right.

133
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:05,164
You have to have a proactive attitude
if you wanna be popuIar in high schooI.

134
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:08,792
PeopIe decide what they think of you
in the first five seconds.

135
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,401
I think you're a dork.

136
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,608
Oh, Wade.

137
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:20,145
-Oh, no.
-This is uncooI.

138
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,078
We can't start high schooI Iike this.

139
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:24,548
You got to be shitting me. Come on.

140
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,778
-PIease, am I dreaming here?
-No.

141
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:29,014
We're never aIIowed
to buy the same shirt again!

142
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:30,646
Whoever sees it first gets to buy it.

143
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:33,385
You guys shouId wear
red ribbons in your hair, too.

144
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,484
See? We both Iook Iike dorks.
Go change.

145
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:37,962
No! I'm the one who was
pIanning on wearing this.

146
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:41,660
Wade, I run the miIe in 21 minutes!

147
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:44,366
How fast do you think I can go?

148
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:48,407
-Go! Hurry!
-I'm going!

149
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,835
Wade, bus!

150
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,972
-Perfect!
-Come on!

151
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:58,379
What a way to start high schooI, huh?

152
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:04,483
Let me guess.
Two-for-one saIe at Hot Topic?

153
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:07,059
-Losers!
-Dorks!

154
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,525
We're dead.

155
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:18,434
First day of our high schooI careers.

156
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:23,773
AII right, Iet's Iight this fuse

157
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:25,839
-Let's go, man.
-AII right.

158
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:29,380
Are you guys part of a bowIing team?

159
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,915
Last one.

160
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:41,051
Hey, at Ieast it'II be easy
to find each other.

161
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:44,096
Yeah. I'II just Iook

162
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:51,764
-Come on!
-No, you have to spin it a few times first

163
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,169
to get it to work.

164
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:57,001
Thank you.

165
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:03,807
No, wait! Wait!

166
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:06,242
-What are you guys doing? Guys!
-Now, shut it. Move!

167
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:07,718
-No, thanks.
-Guys!

168
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:09,379
-Get out of the way!
-Man!

169
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:11,889
-Here we go.
-But that... That's not for me.

170
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:13,482
-That's for my books!
-Okay, here we go.

171
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:14,560
-In there.
-I am not a book!

172
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:16,390
-Get in there!
-This is bad.

173
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:19,124
-This isn't my Iocker! PIease!
-No, this is good.

174
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:21,359
At Ieast we know we're not
the biggest dorks in schooI.

175
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:22,992
-PIease, pIease, pIease!
-Maybe we shouId say something.

176
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:24,365
It's survivaI of the fittest.

177
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:26,837
I've got to say something.
I got to. I have to.

178
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,807
Say something? It's hiIarious.
The kid fits in the Iocker. Come on.

179
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,468
-That's not funny.
-Somebody, heIp!

180
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:32,909
This is the dumbest thing
I've ever done.

181
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:35,243
-HeIp! PIease!
-Stop!

182
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:47,921
-I mean, you don't have to, but...
-Harry Potter.

183
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:50,826
You need to keep your big mouth shut.

184
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:53,593
Yeah, that's what
I've been trying to teII him.

185
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:58,760
-Hey!
-Run! Everybody run! It's not safe here!

186
00:09:58,872 --> 00:10:01,807
Hey, check this out.
Matching shirt geeks.

187
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:03,068
Oh, my God.

188
00:10:03,176 --> 00:10:05,167
Yo, Ron, these bitches
reaIIy wanna wear the same shirt.

189
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:06,609
Let's make them
wear the same shirt, huh?

190
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:08,476
Sounds good. Yeah.

191
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:12,850
The fat one here, the skinny one there,
and just Iet go.

192
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,311
There.

193
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:19,715
You better keep that shit on,

194
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:21,953
'cause if I see you trying to take it off,
you're dead.

195
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,326
And you know what happens
if one of you dies? Both of you dies.

196
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:26,956
'Cause you're Siamese queers, bitches!

197
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,132
That's very cute.

198
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:38,211
You Iook Iike those VeIcro monkeys
who hug each other.

199
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:42,171
How was schooI, Wade?

200
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:44,842
We made so many friends,
I can't even remember aII their names.

201
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:47,784
-Great! You got to be in it to win it.
-I am in it!

202
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:48,877
Great.

203
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:50,845
Yeah!

204
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:54,224
-Yeah.
-So schooI went weII, huh?

205
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:56,955
Oh, it was great.
It couIdn't have gone better.

206
00:10:57,063 --> 00:11:00,362
It was the shirt, right?
I'II have to get you more of those.

207
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,333
Hey! What are you doing?
That's my stuff!

208
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:05,495
This is city property.

209
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:07,470
Nobody's supposed to be
camping out here.

210
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:09,166
Your stuffs in the dumpster
around the corner.

211
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:13,269
That's where I eat! You don't put
a man's beIongings where he eats!

212
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,907
-My taxes pay for your saIary.
-You don't pay taxes.

213
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:19,645
-You don't even have a job.
-What eIse you wanna remind me of?

214
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:23,484
That I don't have good heaIth care?
That I don't beIong to a good gym?

215
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,390
Where's the compassion?
Protect and serve. That's what it says.

216
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:29,324
-Compassion?
-Yeah, compassion.

217
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,488
You wanna know
what I have compassion for?

218
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:35,864
The homeIess who are mentaIIy iII,
the homeIess who are drug-addicted.

219
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:37,960
Buddy, you're just a jackass.

220
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:40,902
Oh, guy hits a IittIe bit of bump
in the road and he's a jackass?

221
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:43,771
Maybe I shouId go smoke some crack
and get your sympathy.

222
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:46,311
-Go back to the ViIIage PeopIe!
-Back up!

223
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,437
Damn!

224
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:52,281
AII right, today is the first day
of our high schooI careers.

225
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:54,150
Yes, it is.

226
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:03,226
There she is.

227
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,992
That's the girI who came up to me
at my Iocker.

228
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,496
-WeII, make your move.
-What move? I don't have a move.

229
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,813
AII right, thanks for signing up.

230
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:30,320
How're you doing?

231
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:32,357
Is this your first time signing up
for the Heritage CIub?

232
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,519
-Yeah, it is. Okay, bye.
-Bye.

233
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:41,598
What'd you sign up for?

234
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:46,195

00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:47,796

237
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:54,103

238
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:55,707
Oh, God.

239
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,176
Guys, why aren't you wearing them?

240
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,552
-Why are you taIking to us?
-I just wanted to say thank you

243
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:10,224
-Yeah.

244
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,457
-Hi.

245
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:15,591
T-Dog? Dude,

246
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:17,829
Hey, can you guys give me a nickname?

247
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:19,963
We need to ditch this guy.
He's Iike a stray cat.

248
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:21,836
Once you feed him,

249
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:23,637
Hey, no secrets, T-Dog.

250
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:24,971
I'm off to U.S. History.

251
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:26,238
-U.S. History.
-Hey, Iook!

252
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:28,940
The Siamese queers had a baby.

253
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:31,176
I guess that makes them tripIets,
now doesn't it?

254
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:34,117
WeII, actuaIIy,
we stiII wouIdn't be tripIets, see.

255
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:36,786
You see, they'd be my parents,
and I'd be the baby.

256
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,016
Don't get smart with me.

257
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:41,924
I said you're tripIets and I think that

258
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:43,791
-and be tripIets.
-We can do that.

259
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:46,491
You know what? Emmit, shut up.

260
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:49,568
Look, you reaIIy have to
do this crap, guys?

261
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:52,536
Come on, give us a break.
It's the second day of schooI.

262
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,971
Hey, I Iike this kid. Yeah.

263
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:58,110
DoubIe Stufs got an attitude.

264
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:04,348
Yeah. We have to do this shit
because it's hiIarious.

265
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:07,411
This schooI is boring.

266
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:10,354
Watching you freak out amuses me.

267
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:15,057
And, yeah, it's just the second day
of schooI. So guess what?

268
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:20,497
It's gonna keep coming
and coming and coming!

269
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:26,330
Party time!

270
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:29,473
-Stop peeing on me!
-Wait! Wait! No!

-Is that Mario Lopez, dude?
-Whoever he is, he's cute!

275
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:03,274
Take his pants off! Pants off!

276
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:24,521
-Up, down, up...
-Write your name!

277
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:34,166
No! PIease, don't! No! Don't!

278
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,869
Bernie?

279
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:47,612
-Come on, give me one match, here.
-That's funny.

280
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,085

-Damn it! Look at that.

282
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,420
God, I can't even get one card!
Not one thing!

283
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:58,793
State of CaIifornia just robbed me, Don.
You saw it.

284
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:04,266
You'd think... Where's my quarter?
Did you see my...

285
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,201
-You're aIways Iooking at me.

00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:09,571

-Don, did you just take my quarter?

287
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:12,076
No, I didn't take your quarter, DriIIbit.

288
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,169
Not my fauIt you can't keep track
of your finances.

289
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,612
I don't know why you're spending aII
your money on this dumb stuff, anyway.

290
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:19,344
You're unbeIievabIe.
I got to get out of here.

291
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:21,716
You know,
I can't take this anymore, man.

292
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:24,517
Rich peopIe don't Iike us,

293
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:26,251
and the tourists are scared of us.

294
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,850
-When they see Bernie, they're terrified.
-Terrified.

295
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:31,658
They're not scared of me, I'm sexy.

296
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:33,356
-Sanitizer?
-Yeah.

297
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,399

I just wanna fIy north. I want to...

299
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:42,741
I'd Iike to go to Canada.

300
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,806
What was it Iast year? I think it was,

301
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:46,708
-''I was gonna go to IceIand.''
-Reykjavík.

302
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:47,802
-No, no.
-Where's that?

303
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:50,849
Yeah, but the thing about Canada,
if you go high enough north...

304
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,440
-That's right.
-...the government pays you

305
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:53,951
-to take the Iand.
-That's the truth.

306
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:56,715
Yeah. Lookit, man,
the beer's twice as strong.

307
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:59,621
They don't Iock the doors,
that shouId appeaI to a man Iike you.

308
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,921
And what about
a British CoIumbian girI?

309
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:04,292
Does that sound Iike
a pretty potent mix?

310
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:06,399
Yeah, that's not too bad.
I kind of Iike that.

311
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,066
Okay, now, man, check this out.

312
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:11,069
One-way fIight to Canada, $287.

313
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:13,537
You got to throw in 50 bucks for bribing,
what're they caIIed,

314
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,471
-the FederaIes, the...
-Mounties.

315
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,167
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Mounties.

316
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:20,906
Another...
I want a good winter jacket, 80 bucks.

317
00:17:21,014 --> 00:17:25,781
So we're taIking $387 and it's a new
Iife for your oId hombre, DriIIbit.

318
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:28,649
I dig it, man. FoIIow the dream.
Chase that thing.

319
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:30,518
How you gonna come up
with that kind of money, though?

320
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,749
Get a job.

321
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:34,326
I was an Army Ranger.
There are a Iot of peopIe dying for that.

322
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:37,157
Watch this kid pIay Hendrix.
He reaIIy jams. Look at him.

323
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,730
Oh, yeah, there he goes.

324
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:40,856
Yeah, I Iike how he Iooks
a IittIe bit Iike Hendrix.

325
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:45,265
Yeah! I'm gonna give him a buck.

326
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:48,204
-I'II give him a coupIe bucks.
-A buck? Give him a compIiment, man!

327
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:49,275
Give me a buck!

328
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:08,059
Why is he in my house?

329
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:11,221
Are we trying to attract
after-schooI buIIies?

330
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:13,663
I'm here because
Wade invited me to be here.

331
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:15,859
Because I'm your friend now.

332
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,036
This fantasy Iand you Iive in,
Emmit, are there rides?

333
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:22,733
Stop picking on him, aII right?
This is our guy.

334
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:24,332
I don't want him to be our guy.

335
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:28,244
WeII, the good news is, I think I found
a soIution to our probIems.

336
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:31,073
-KiII Emmit?
-No, bear with me.

337
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:33,914
This might sound stupid,
but I was on the Internet Iast night

338
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,922
and there's a bunch of sites where
we can hire a professionaI bodyguard.

339
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:41,482
-What do you mean by bodyguard?
-Like he beats up kids that bother us.

340
00:18:41,594 --> 00:18:45,530
A bodyguard? Wade,
that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.

341
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:47,862
We shouId just be men
and fight these kids!

342
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:49,298
Are you serious?

343
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:53,433
Of course not. I've never been in a fight.

344
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:57,074
Have you seen those
high schooI fights on YouTube?

345
00:18:57,176 --> 00:18:58,734
Kids are brutaI.

346
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,015
He gave us an earthquake
when we were peeing in the urinaI.

347
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:05,106
He shoved me in a Iocker.

348
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:08,949
And he put my head in his shirt
and caIIed us Siamese queers.

349
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,225
How's that funny?

350
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:17,125
It's not funny. It's just, it's rare that,

351
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,993
you know,
kids say things that surprise me.

352
00:19:19,098 --> 00:19:21,999
Siamese queers.
I'd never heard that one.

353
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:28,229
-What wouId you Iike me to do?
-We reaIIy just want it to stop.

354
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,539
So are they pretty much free to say
whatever they want?

355
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:33,942
Or am I aIIowed to defend myseIf?

356
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:38,241
Oh, no. PrincipaI DoppIer,
I thought this was gonna be anonymous.

357
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:42,549
In this country, we give the accused
the chance to face his accusers.

358
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:44,145
Terry, come over here for a second,
wiII you?

359
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:47,021
Now we've known each other for...
Yeah, have a seat.

360
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:50,357
-What's your take on this?
-Hey, guys, hey. How's it going?

361
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,532
Be poIite! There you go.

362
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:55,059
-Wade.
-Hi.

363
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:57,295
Hey, T-Dog. Give me a pound.

364
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:01,499
Yeah. PrincipaI DoppIer, sir,
I was reaIIy excited

365
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:04,599
about starting this new schooI year.
I'm not gonna Iie.

366
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:08,572
Who knows?
I, maybe, was hazing them a IittIe bit,

367
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,082
but I'm sorry.

368
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:13,482
I reaIIy am.

369
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:16,487
You know, I appreciate you taking
responsibiIity. It's refreshing.

370
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:18,819
-He doesn't mean it!
-We need to caII his parents in.

371
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:21,189
-Now.
-He doesn't have any parents.

372
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:24,263
WeII, not in this country, anyway.
They Iive in Hong Kong.

373
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:27,162
-He's an emancipated minor.
-What does that mean?

374
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:29,530
It means he's IegaIIy an aduIt.

375
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:31,663
He answers to no one.

376
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:34,467
He's above the Iaw.

377
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:38,109
-What a nightmare, huh?
-Yeah.

378
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:40,935
Oh, crap.

379
00:20:42,248 --> 00:20:43,237
Oh, no.

380
00:20:44,717 --> 00:20:45,911
-Run.
-Go! Go!

381
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,988
-Run! Go, go!
-Hurry.

382
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,716
Wait for me!

383
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:10,902
Go, go!

384
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:17,710
-Do you think he sees us?
-No.

385
00:21:29,562 --> 00:21:31,530
Open the door! Open the door!

386
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:32,757
What do they want?

387
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:35,299
Just keep driving, Mom.
It's none of our business.

388
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,641
Let's go, Iet's go!

389
00:22:02,795 --> 00:22:05,764
Have you guys Iost your mind?
Come on, Iet's go!

390
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:07,830
Go, go, come on!

391
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:13,198
-Come on.
-Oh, no!

392
00:22:13,673 --> 00:22:15,766
-Run! Run!
-Go!

393
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:18,433
Get them, baby!

394
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,015
There! The garage!

395
00:22:47,206 --> 00:22:48,730
You gonna rat on me, boys?

396
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:51,639
Try to get my parents invoIved
in this situation?

397
00:22:52,345 --> 00:22:56,213
Now I have to make it my mission
to destroy you punks!

398
00:22:56,315 --> 00:22:59,716
Hey! You kids get the heII off
my property!

399
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:02,982
I'm gonna give you three seconds,
then I'm getting my shotgun!

400
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,216
-No!
-You better get out of here right now!

401
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:07,588
-PIease don't!
-No! PIease!

402
00:23:08,494 --> 00:23:10,962
One! Two! Three!

403
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:18,203
-Go! Go!
-And stay out, you gang bangers!

404
00:23:29,448 --> 00:23:31,473
CharIes, chai Iatte up.

405
00:23:31,684 --> 00:23:35,085
-Hey! Get off my computer!
-Keep your shirt on.

406
00:23:35,187 --> 00:23:36,154
Come on.

407
00:23:38,457 --> 00:23:40,755
If this doesn't work,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

408
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,420
When it works,
you're going to kiss my ass.

409
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:46,589
How are we gonna know
which one's the bodyguard?

410
00:23:57,777 --> 00:23:59,972
Have you ever done
this kind of thing before?

411
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,639
I worked for the hardest gangstas
in the worId.

412
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:04,807
Kee Lo-Lo, Chenobee.

413
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:08,383
HeII, I stiII work for Tupac,
even though he dead.

414
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:12,780
I am IsraeIi MiIitary Secret Service
Antiterrorist Squad.

415
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:16,893
So when I kiII this kid,
do you want me to do it quickIy,

416
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:19,487
-or do you want him to suffer?
-Suffer.

417
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,661
If you hire Tiger's Protection Services,

418
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:25,634
not onIy do you get the Tiger,

419
00:24:25,738 --> 00:24:28,764
but you get the protection
of his entire pride.

420
00:24:31,377 --> 00:24:32,344
Do you Iike hip-hop?

421
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:34,072
What the heII you impIying
I Iike hip-hop for?

422
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,842
'Cause I'm dressed this way?
I Iike country. You Iike country?

423
00:24:36,949 --> 00:24:40,112
That's the kind of music I Iike. AIabama.
Gimme some of that.

424
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:43,382
Some Brooks and Dunn.
The Dixie Chicks, bitch.

425
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:48,623
Kids hiring a bodyguard
to take care of a buIIy?

426
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:50,252
Stupidest thing I ever heard.

427
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,855
Back in my day, if a kid was getting
beat up, it was caIIed chiIdhood.

428
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:57,060
Pick somebody, anybody.
I'II go beat their ass

429
00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:01,230
right here, right now, and then you can
ask them for a goddamned reference.

430
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:03,570
How about you, Iady?

431
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:06,873
I'II kick your ass right now!
CIose. CIosed.

432
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:10,177
-Yeah!
-This is very disturbing.

433
00:25:10,282 --> 00:25:12,443
You want an ass kicking?

434
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,383
What do you do
when you're not body guarding?

435
00:25:21,494 --> 00:25:23,724
I work at Raging Waters.

436
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:28,129
I sense great hesitation.
Wait one moment. Excuse me.

437
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:30,365
I'm going to borrow this.

438
00:25:31,103 --> 00:25:33,697
-PIease don't do that.
-Oh, God damn!

439
00:25:35,307 --> 00:25:36,409
-$2,100 a week.
-$10,000 a week.

440
00:25:36,449 --> 00:25:37,706
-$2,100 a week.
-$10,000 a week.

441
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,870
We're hoping you'd say, Iike,
around $100.

442
00:25:42,615 --> 00:25:44,412
-Not interested.
-I hate kids Iike you.

443
00:25:44,517 --> 00:25:47,111
I can't heIp you. No one can heIp you!

444
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,127
-Susan, your doubIe espresso's up.
-I'm Susan.

445
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:13,672
I'm DriIIbit TayIor.

446
00:26:19,151 --> 00:26:23,554
U.S. Army Ranger, bIack ops operative,
decorated marksman,

447
00:26:23,656 --> 00:26:27,592
-improvised weapons expert.
-Are you stiII in the miIitary?

448
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,861
I was discharged.
Unauthorized heroism.

449
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:38,025
Yeah. They caII it an army of one
in the ads, but they don't mean it.

450
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:43,263
UnIess they mean the whoIe army
working together as one.

451
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,741
But they certainIy don't want one man
out there kicking ass

452
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:48,973
Iike an army of one,
which is the way I took it.

453
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:53,076
As a bodyguard
I protected three Vice Presidents,

454
00:26:53,953 --> 00:26:57,548
Bobby Brown, SyIvester StaIIone...
Not as tough as he Iooks.

455
00:26:58,257 --> 00:27:00,885
So what's the story?
Who do you guys need protection from?

456
00:27:00,993 --> 00:27:04,292
It shouId be easy for you.
Just a high schooI buIIy.

457
00:27:04,396 --> 00:27:07,194
Yeah. Run into a few of those in my Iife.

458
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:11,667
-What'd you do to provoke him?
-WeII, he's fat, and he's a dork,

459
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:14,137
-and I'm awesome.
-Shut up, Wade.

460
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,368
By ''awesome'' do you mean
scared, skinny and IoneIy?

461
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:20,033
Yeah.

462
00:27:21,347 --> 00:27:22,314
Yeah.

463
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:27,314
-So how do we know you're Iegit?
-Come here. Go on, come here.

464
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,114
I'm not gonna bite.

465
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,590
I want you to Iook at my eyes.

466
00:27:34,426 --> 00:27:36,018
Take a good Iook.

467
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:41,398
Come here! What do you see?
You Iooking?

468
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:46,437
-What the heII have you seen?
-You want some?

469
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,667
These eyes have seen
unspeakabIe horror.

470
00:27:52,945 --> 00:27:54,276
That's my evidence.

471
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,010
That's how you know if a guy's Iegit.
You need some evidence, too?

472
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,386
I've seen things you wouIdn't beIieve.

473
00:28:01,487 --> 00:28:05,048
I've watched C-beams gIitter in the dark
near the Tannhauser Gate.

474
00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:07,525
Isn't that Blade Runner?

475
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,854
Look cIoseIy 'cause it's aII in there.

476
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:14,199
Boo!

477
00:28:18,838 --> 00:28:20,897
So, how much do you charge?

478
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,707
$387 a week.

479
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:27,437
-One second.
-I say yes.

480
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,477
I'm not even sure if I'm avaiIabIe.

481
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,948
-He's good.
-No! No! He's weird.

482
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:34,645
You know, we might be abIe
to work up to that.

483
00:28:34,987 --> 00:28:37,353
But right now, we've onIy got $83.

484
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:43,958
Okay, weII, give me that now
and we'II figure out the rest Iater.

485
00:28:46,732 --> 00:28:48,597
You know what this is?

486
00:28:49,568 --> 00:28:50,967
It's a wing.

487
00:28:51,837 --> 00:28:56,103
And you're under it.
AII three of you, right there.

488
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:58,176
Okay, here's the mission pIan.

489
00:28:58,277 --> 00:29:02,475
Using my expertise at steaIthy
and covert ops, I'II infiItrate the schooI

490
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:06,415
where I wiII watch over you
Iike the Lord aImighty himseIf.

491
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:08,145
CarefuI.

492
00:29:09,154 --> 00:29:11,418
Like the good Lord,
I'm gonna use some mysterious ways,

493
00:29:11,523 --> 00:29:13,991
so you're not aIways gonna see me,
but I'II be there.

494
00:29:14,093 --> 00:29:15,754
EspeciaIIy when you don't see me.

495
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:17,761
But first, I'm gonna need some suppIies.

496
00:29:17,863 --> 00:29:19,524
-I want to go in and get...
-Like nunchucks?

497
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,599
Maybe.

498
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:23,566
But a Iot of stuff, I'II just get from
just what's Iaying around the house.

499
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:24,658
You'd be surprised.

500
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:27,670
Anything can be turned into
a weapon of mayhem or destruction.

501
00:29:27,773 --> 00:29:30,071
-Even a puppy?
-EspeciaIIy a puppy.

502
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:34,509
Germans used them in WorId War I.
Da Hunden Stormen. Lightning Dog.

503
00:29:35,748 --> 00:29:38,979
They'd attach dynamite to them.
RommeI did it. Jerry bastard.

504
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:42,318
-Now, Iisten. One thing that...
-This is my house.

505
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:44,020
Wow.

506
00:29:44,123 --> 00:29:49,186
-We can go in. Nobody's home.
-Let's hit it. DepIoy, soIdiers.

507
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:53,163
-SoIdiers? CooI. You hear that, T-Dog?
-BeeIine, front door! SingIe fiIe!

508
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:54,493
Officers first!

509
00:29:57,469 --> 00:30:00,461
You, get me a bowI of cereaI.
Go on. Scram.

510
00:30:09,848 --> 00:30:12,681
-Okay, this I'm gonna need. Right here.
-What for?

511
00:30:12,785 --> 00:30:14,480
You take that,
my mom'II rip my head off!

512
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:16,247
At ease, Casper!

513
00:30:16,455 --> 00:30:20,221
Okay. Observe its momentary
refIective bIinding capabiIities.

514
00:30:20,826 --> 00:30:23,818
Bang! You're defenseIess.

515
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:26,261
SiIver aIIoy,
one of the strongest ever constructed.

516
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:29,357
ProbabIy stop an armor-piercing buIIet
at point-bIank range.

517
00:30:29,468 --> 00:30:31,902
You don't reaIIy think
it couId come to that.

518
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:33,130
You teII me.

519
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:36,871
FiIkins is a whack job.
He aImost ran over us with his car!

520
00:30:36,976 --> 00:30:40,912
-He's a menace.
-Yeah, I was my dad's favorite, too.

521
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:43,140
He once cut a kid's arm off
with a samurai sword.

522
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:45,045
-BIaded weaponry?
-Yeah.

523
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:48,944
Okay. I'm not gonna take any chances.
You're now on orange aIert.

524
00:30:49,688 --> 00:30:52,851
Okay, now this wiII be good
for video surveiIIance.

525
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:54,657
This is good.

526
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,160
You take the guts out of this
and use it for wiretapping.

527
00:30:57,262 --> 00:31:00,754
I think we can use this as a...
I don't know, as a timekeeping device.

528
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:02,697
I think I'II wear it on my wrist, possibIy.

529
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:05,031
You think you might need this?

530
00:31:06,171 --> 00:31:08,901
This piece of crap's not worth anything.

531
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:11,533
As a weapon. It's too obvious.

532
00:31:11,643 --> 00:31:13,873
Testing, one, two. Mister Taylor?

533
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:16,573
-Testing, one, two.
-Can you come back now?

534
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:19,014
Guys, you got to go far back!
I can hear you!

535
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:21,814
Testing, testing, one, two.
Can you hear me now?

536
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:25,256
-They work pretty good.
-These are great.

537
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:26,346
-Yeah.
-These are invaIuabIe.

538
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,686
-They get a IittIe staticky, though...
-Yeah.

539
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:29,317
...I think, some pIaces in the house.

540
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:30,656
Why you need aII this stuff for?

541
00:31:30,796 --> 00:31:32,491
I thought we were gonna give
FiIkins a beat down.

542
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:33,690
I am gonna beat him down,

543
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:36,063
but sometimes
after that first beat down,

544
00:31:36,168 --> 00:31:38,068
then they get a IittIe, you know...
They want a IittIe payback.

545
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,638
I'm home!
Who wants griIIed-cheese sandwiches?

546
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:42,104
-Go! Go! Mom! Mom!
-Okay.

547
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:44,266
-Exit! Exit!
-Go, out the back, out the back, go.

548
00:31:44,376 --> 00:31:45,900
Just 'cause you don't see me
doesn't mean I'm not there.

549
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:49,674
-Shut the door.
-Act naturaI. Hey, Mom.

550
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,249
-Hey, Barbara, how you doing?
-Hi, boys.

551
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,942
-Who's your new IittIe friend? Hi.
-Hi.

552
00:31:53,052 --> 00:31:54,679
-Hi. Emmit Oosterhaus.
-Hi, Emmit Oosterhaus.

553
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,550
-He's not our friend.
-Yeah, he is.

554
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:57,713
He's Iike our hamster.

555
00:31:57,823 --> 00:31:59,484
SmeII Iike something?

556
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:04,024
-Ryan? You washing?
-Yeah. You?

557
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:07,296
It's a funny smeII. It's aII right.
GriIIed-cheese sandwiches.

558
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:10,731
Hey, come on! Buzz us in!

559
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,930
You're gonna wanna see this!

560
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:14,198
Big money coming in!

561
00:32:14,306 --> 00:32:16,740
This ain't a bunch of
aIuminum cans here.

562
00:32:16,842 --> 00:32:18,002
Where do you want it?
PriceIess treasures.

563
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,441
Go set them down there.

564
00:32:20,012 --> 00:32:22,105
So you don't think those kids
are gonna miss this stuff?

565
00:32:22,214 --> 00:32:24,114
No. They got two of everything.

566
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:28,118
They got the iPod, the iPod Nano.
And I don't care if they do,

567
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,519
'cause after this IittIe transaction,

568
00:32:31,623 --> 00:32:35,024
weII, the oId DriIIbit's taking his act
to the Great White North.

569
00:32:35,127 --> 00:32:37,288
-What?
-Yeah, I'm going to Canada.

570
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:39,887
WeII, that's stupid.
You're gonna cut out now?

571
00:32:39,998 --> 00:32:43,195
-I'm going...
-These kids are a cash cow, DriIIbit.

572
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:45,497
You need to hang in there.
You don't cut and run.

573
00:32:45,604 --> 00:32:47,868
You got to get in there and miIk this.

574
00:32:47,973 --> 00:32:49,406
Okay, come on back.

575
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:54,202
AII right, I'II teII you what.
I give you $125 for the whoIe Iot.

576
00:32:54,313 --> 00:32:55,302
What?

577
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:58,178
I just heard you say
you took it from some kids.

578
00:32:58,283 --> 00:33:00,581
So? Don't get aII righteous on me.

579
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:03,382
HaIf this store you guys got
from crackheads and thieves.

580
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:05,650
Hey. Who the heII
do you think you are, man?

581
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:07,384
Let me teII you something.
Those peopIe are our customers!

582
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:09,688
We're not that harsh on them,
so you shouIdn't be!

583
00:33:09,795 --> 00:33:11,763
How wouId you Iike it
if we caIIed you a crackhead?

584
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,195
You have caIIed me one.

585
00:33:13,298 --> 00:33:15,698
-Have we? Have we?
-I think I might have.

586
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:18,192
-Drillbit? Drillbit? Come in.
-What is that?

587
00:33:18,303 --> 00:33:21,864
I'm sorry, hoId it just a second.
D.B. one-four-niner-eight, come in.

588
00:33:21,974 --> 00:33:23,566
-Just take this.
-We just wanted you to know

589
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:25,609
that Emmit was holding out
on some bar mitZvah money.

590
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:29,272
Emmit, l don't care how many times you
get bar mitZvahed, you're not a man.

591
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:30,439
-l am a man.
-No, you're not.

592
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:32,847
-DriIIbit! MiIk it, miIk it.
-So we'll have another 50 bucks for you

593
00:33:32,951 --> 00:33:35,078
-on Monday.
-Grab the udder and miIk it.

594
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:37,553
Ten-four, good buddy.
I wiII see you tomorrow.

595
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:41,387
Commence radio siIence in three, two.

596
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:46,123
Today's the officiaI start
of our high schooI careers.

597
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:49,598
Last week's history.
Nothing good came out of Iast week.

598
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:53,034
-We became best friends.
-Nothing good came out of Iast week.

599
00:33:53,138 --> 00:33:55,538
There's the sword. Man, we're so dead.

600
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:58,940
-Where's DriIIbit, Wade?
-Hey. CaIvary's here.

601
00:33:59,044 --> 00:34:01,103
-PIease, where have you been?
-Yes. What's up, man?

602
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:03,681
Where's my money?
Where's my money?

603
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:08,013
We got 40 bucks we promised,
pIus we got an extra 1 7.

604
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,109
I soId my Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

605
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:10,415
Okay, this is gonna be sweet.

606
00:34:10,522 --> 00:34:12,124
I can't wait to watch
you kick FiIkins' ass.

607
00:34:12,164 --> 00:34:12,385
I can't wait to watch
you kick FiIkins' ass.

608
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:15,585
-Yeah. What, is he here?
-Yeah, over there on his car.

609
00:34:15,694 --> 00:34:17,127
I want you to be
the Iast face he ever sees.

610
00:34:17,229 --> 00:34:18,287
What are you gonna do?

611
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:19,921
-What am I gonna do?
-Come on.

612
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,021
I want you to gnaw on his skuII.

613
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:22,600
-What's the pIan?
-Shut up.

614
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:27,364
Guys, I'm gonna check this dude out.

615
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,607
Yes.

616
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,207
Excuse me.

617
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:37,640
Yeah.

618
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:46,589
Just got to kind of stand here
for a second.

619
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:52,555
AII right. Hey, take it easy, man.

620
00:34:57,536 --> 00:34:59,561
He's thin, but sinewy and muscuIar.

621
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:02,834
He's got a Iow center of gravity which
means he's fast Iike a jack rabbit.

622
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:05,967
He didn't take a shower today
or yesterday. He's got bad breath.

623
00:35:06,078 --> 00:35:08,205
He's got a coupIe of cavities
which is not improving...

624
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:10,338
This is serious. I thought
you were gonna go kick his ass.

625
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:11,473
Yeah.

626
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:13,847
Look at Tommy Trigger Finger.
You want the bIood and the guts.

627
00:35:13,952 --> 00:35:15,385
WeII, it doesn't work that way.

628
00:35:15,487 --> 00:35:17,079
I can't just kick his ass.

629
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:21,125
PhysicaIIy, I can,
but if you kick a buIIy's ass,

630
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:23,456
then maybe you guys Iive tiII Iunchtime.

631
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:25,029
And then what?

632
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,930
''Teach those victims how to kick
the buIIy's ass and they Iive forever.''

633
00:35:29,034 --> 00:35:30,467
Steven SeagaI.

634
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:32,469
So you're gonna teach us
how to beat him up?

635
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:35,972
-Like train us?
-So we're gonna beat up FiIkins?

636
00:35:37,142 --> 00:35:40,976
What I'm about to show you are
top-secret bIack ops fighting moves.

637
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:42,979
And it's aII about technique.

638
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:44,480
I don't care if you're taIking about

639
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:49,646
karate, tai chi, kung fu, praying mantis,

640
00:35:49,788 --> 00:35:52,689
kung pao, Panda Express.

641
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:56,022
It's aII about technique.
I want you to watch my technique.

642
00:35:56,395 --> 00:35:59,023
It's pretty fIawIess.
Come on, Ryan, charge me.

643
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:00,928
I'm serious. Try to kiII me.

644
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,797
Come on. You ready?
Go! Yeah. Come on.

645
00:36:03,902 --> 00:36:05,597
I got you!

646
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:08,632
I got you! I got you!

647
00:36:12,244 --> 00:36:13,541
Damn it!

648
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:18,241
Okay. Tripped right there.
That was the bear hug.

649
00:36:18,684 --> 00:36:21,448
Okay. Wade. Come on!

650
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:23,786
Here you go! Watch the eIbows!

651
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:25,379
Don't! Stop!

652
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,051
Okay. Last but not Ieast. Charge me.

653
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:34,858
Everyone, up! CircIe me!

654
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:37,298
Come on.
Let me see some fight from you.

655
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:39,136
Okay, you guys ready for the bIizzard?

656
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:42,206
-Go get him, boys!
-Yeah. Go, get it, aII three of you!

657
00:36:42,741 --> 00:36:47,201
I caII truce! Truce! Back up! Three's
too many. Three's too many. Stop.

658
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:51,182
Wow, one of you
reaIIy charIey-horsed me.

659
00:36:51,283 --> 00:36:54,810
Okay.
Now it isn't aII orientaI martiaI arts.

660
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,582
Sometimes you give
a IittIe Mexican judo as in

661
00:36:57,689 --> 00:36:59,281
''Ju don't know who
you're messing with, homes.''

662
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:03,293
Come on, Ryan, one more. Last one!
Show me your mettIe. Come on! Olé!

663
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:05,229
Wow!

664
00:37:06,365 --> 00:37:07,389
Ryan!

665
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:09,394
Man down!

666
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:12,236
Ryan!

667
00:37:14,172 --> 00:37:15,605
Was that my fauIt?

668
00:37:17,008 --> 00:37:19,806
Hey! Check this out.

669
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:22,311
Dude! You feII Iike 60 feet.

670
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:24,709
Jeez, that was crazy.

671
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:27,009
What is this?

672
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,518
This is a strategic outpost.

673
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,588
I got these posted aII over the city.

674
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:32,020
Don't even Iook at it, okay?

675
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,058
Now Iet's get back up there
and get to work.

676
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,992
What's this for?
To wash your baIIs in the morning?

677
00:37:38,864 --> 00:37:41,025
No. Look Iike a squeegee to you?

678
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,226
Or does it Iook Iike a weapon
with a straight edge

679
00:37:43,335 --> 00:37:45,667
and a IittIe mop to cIean up the bIood?

680
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:49,037
T-Dog, Emmit, this way.

681
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,836
-Where's DriIIbit?
-I don't know.

682
00:37:50,942 --> 00:37:53,001
-Wait up.
-ShouId be right up here.

683
00:38:00,018 --> 00:38:01,280
Man down!

684
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:04,113
Take this.

685
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:05,587
-Take a swing at my head.
-Oh, no.

686
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,487
Wade, come on. Just hit me.

687
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:09,355
-But it'II hurt.
-Wade hit me.

688
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:11,224
-I'II do it.
-Shut up.

689
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:19,564
I feeI no pain,
'cause I have a trained mind.

690
00:38:19,671 --> 00:38:20,638
-Go!
-Come on.

691
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:23,139
-Let's beat it.
-Come on, come on, come on, Iet's go.

692
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,408
-Hey, DriIIbit. We couId make s'mores!
-No.

693
00:38:28,513 --> 00:38:31,346
-How much does a Hug Me Bear cost?
-No.

694
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,442
-Where'd you get the kids, DriIIbit?
-I won them in a poker game.

695
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,155
Order up!

696
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:39,780
-How's this part of the training?
-It's caIIed buIking up.

697
00:38:39,891 --> 00:38:42,485
-I'm aIready fat.
-Hey. You're not fat.

698
00:38:42,994 --> 00:38:44,222
I don't want to hear you say you're fat.

699
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:49,824
Words Iike Iard ass, fat pig, butterbaII,
IandsIide, mudsIide.

700
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:52,699
I don't want to hear that.
What are you tipping the scaIes at?

701
00:38:52,804 --> 00:38:54,271
180.

702
00:38:54,372 --> 00:38:55,498
What?

703
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:58,501
Whenever you're ready, boys.

704
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,770
Okay, one of you guys
got to pick this up,

705
00:38:59,878 --> 00:39:00,867
'cause I'm stiII on the cIock.

706
00:39:03,748 --> 00:39:05,181
FiIkins. FiIkins.

707
00:39:05,283 --> 00:39:07,649
Avoidance technique!
Avoidance technique!

708
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:12,723
Come out here, Capone!
<i>Y</i>ou want to fight?

709
00:39:12,824 --> 00:39:14,451
<i>Y</i>ou want to fight,
you and me, right here?

710
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:16,356
This is very important. See that?

711
00:39:16,461 --> 00:39:18,156
What's the matter? Afraid to
come out from behind your men?

712
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:19,753
-He has a hoIdback guy.
-Afraid to stand up for yourself?

713
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:21,992
Now that aIIows peopIe to think
that you want to fight

714
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,465
when reaIIy he doesn't want to fight.

715
00:39:23,568 --> 00:39:25,399
<i>Y</i>ou got nothing in court.
<i>Y</i>ou don't got the bookkeeper.

716
00:39:25,504 --> 00:39:26,971
When I'm here I'm your hoIdback guy.

717
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:29,006
So now you can act crazy.

718
00:39:29,174 --> 00:39:30,869
No, hey, hey, caIm down.

719
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:35,973
I'm gonna kiII you!

720
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:38,606
Hey, stop! Stop!

721
00:39:38,717 --> 00:39:40,082
CaIm down.

722
00:39:40,185 --> 00:39:41,311
-Hoo-rah.
-Hoo-rah.

723
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,285
Get under the wing.

724
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,851
Put aII the biIIs facing
the same direction.

725
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,292
Yeah, don't worry about it, Don.

726
00:39:51,396 --> 00:39:53,523
I thought these kids were Ioaded.

727
00:39:53,798 --> 00:39:56,790
It's Iike aII you read about are how
1 4-year-oIds ruIe the marketpIace,

728
00:39:56,902 --> 00:39:58,233
and Iook at this.

729
00:39:58,336 --> 00:40:01,737
HardIy got anything. You think this is
gonna get me to the Great White North?

730
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,001
AIIow me to make a point reaI quick.

731
00:40:04,242 --> 00:40:05,368
HeIIo, deIicious.

732
00:40:05,477 --> 00:40:08,844
DriIIbit? Do you know
why we come here every day?

733
00:40:10,048 --> 00:40:13,142
It's because these businessmen
can't eat aII their food.

734
00:40:13,351 --> 00:40:15,410
They have more than they need.

735
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,182
These kids are a Iot Iike
these businessmen, okay?

736
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,417
They have way more than they need.

737
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:23,926
It's our job to go into their houses
and take aII their excess.

738
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:26,156
I get a kick out of these kids.

739
00:40:26,898 --> 00:40:29,628
I toId you that IittIe fat one
says some funny shit.

740
00:40:29,734 --> 00:40:31,258
I Iike these kids, too, man.

741
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:34,429
I mean, from what I gather,
they're some pretty cooI dudes.

742
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:37,133
But if you Iike them,
you shouId think about heIping them.

743
00:40:37,242 --> 00:40:39,301
-If you care about them.
-What do you mean?

744
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:40,742
SteaI their TV.

745
00:40:41,413 --> 00:40:43,142
Maybe they'II read a book.

746
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:47,810
SteaI their iPod. Heck, I don't know.
Maybe they'II Iearn to pIay the piano.

747
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:49,877
They don't need aII this crap.

748
00:40:49,988 --> 00:40:51,615
You think Mozart had a Game Boy?

749
00:40:51,723 --> 00:40:55,557
I didn't have it. Didn't hurt me.
I was outside pIaying, cIimbing trees.

750
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,460
Yeah, man, me, too.
I'm stiII outside hanging around in trees.

751
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:03,663
And the parents are never around.
There's no one there in the daytime.

752
00:41:03,768 --> 00:41:06,032
One big hit. It's aII we need.

753
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:21,946
Boobies.

754
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:31,454
Penis!

755
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:39,964
AII right. Open your eyes, Iet your body
drift back into consciousness.

756
00:41:41,306 --> 00:41:47,176
Namaste. Thank you for your practice.
That concIudes the meditation time.

757
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:49,740
-Okay. How do you feeI?
-I feeI good.

758
00:41:49,848 --> 00:41:52,510
-Doing aII right?
-Yeah. I think my biceps are coming in.

759
00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:53,845
Guns are coming in.

760
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:56,216
Now, Iisten.
We're about 10o/o done with the training.

761
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:57,310
-Next...
-10o/o?

762
00:41:57,422 --> 00:42:00,289
Are you high?
We can't sit in the woods anymore.

763
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:03,259
-We got to go back to schooI.
-Yeah, and I can't forge any more notes.

764
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:05,659
How many diseases can a kid have?

765
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,568
You guys think you're ready?

766
00:42:16,107 --> 00:42:18,598
You know,
I am reaIIy scared to go back.

767
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,679
Look. If you're not ready to fight,
there is another aIternative.

768
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,838
But I got to be honest with you,

769
00:42:22,947 --> 00:42:26,280
onIy the strongest of warriors
can puII this one off.

770
00:42:27,686 --> 00:42:32,290
It's so difficuIt that most men
trembIe at its mere thought.

771
00:42:32,924 --> 00:42:34,255
What is it?

772
00:42:34,392 --> 00:42:36,326
What the heII is it?

773
00:42:39,397 --> 00:42:40,625
Love him.

774
00:42:40,965 --> 00:42:42,956
-What?
-Love him.

775
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:45,298
You know, I don't know
what's going through your head, DriIIbit,

776
00:42:45,403 --> 00:42:47,462
but I'm not gonna bang him.

777
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:49,467
When I'm taIking about Iove,
I mean compassion.

778
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:52,702
-I'm not going to...
-Shut up. And understanding.

779
00:42:53,978 --> 00:42:55,343
Find your commonaIity.

780
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,610
Let him know you're more aIike
than different.

781
00:42:59,484 --> 00:43:01,543
Maybe that'II put out his fuse.

782
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:04,649
And remember, guys,

783
00:43:04,756 --> 00:43:07,623
just because you don't see me
doesn't mean I'm not there.

784
00:43:07,726 --> 00:43:11,787
I'II be there Iike a siIent,
deadIy poItergeist.

785
00:43:11,896 --> 00:43:12,863
-Thanks.
-Okay.

786
00:43:12,964 --> 00:43:14,158
AII right, see you Iater, DriIIbit.

787
00:43:14,265 --> 00:43:15,926
Remember, you're under my wing.

788
00:43:20,038 --> 00:43:21,198
Oh, no.

789
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:23,604
There he is. ShouId we hide?

790
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:26,541
No. We've been running
and hiding aII week.

791
00:43:26,644 --> 00:43:29,738
This is what DriIIbit's been
taIking about, finding commonaIities.

792
00:43:29,848 --> 00:43:33,716
He's rapping. You Iove to rap!
You can do this!

793
00:43:33,985 --> 00:43:34,974
No, I can't.

794
00:43:35,086 --> 00:43:37,111
Yes, you can. It's just Iike in 8 Mile.
He'II respect you.

795
00:43:37,222 --> 00:43:38,951
No, man, I'm afraid of him. I can't!

796
00:43:39,057 --> 00:43:41,525
-You're crazy! Don't do it.
-You can do it, Ryan.

797
00:43:41,626 --> 00:43:43,321
-I beIieve in you.
-Don't.

798
00:43:44,162 --> 00:43:47,563
AII right. I can do it. I can do it.

799
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:51,461
-Whassup, whassup?
-Whassup?

800
00:43:53,805 --> 00:43:56,467
I wanna rap with you.
Hey, fIip the script, Ronnie.

801
00:43:56,574 --> 00:43:57,802
Hit that beat.

802
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:00,476
-Yo, this cooI, FiI?
-Sure, whatever.

803
00:44:02,347 --> 00:44:04,178
<i>Y</i>o, call me whatever you want

804
00:44:04,282 --> 00:44:06,807

805
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:09,511
l'm the king of Vice City
Like the Buddha, l'm Zen

806
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:11,851
Like Beckham, l bend, l tell suckers

807
00:44:11,956 --> 00:44:13,947
"Say hello to my little friend"

808
00:44:14,893 --> 00:44:16,155
Snap! This guy!

809
00:44:18,163 --> 00:44:21,894
Hey, meatball, where's your spaghetti?
<i>Y</i>our rapping's like a nightmare

810
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,592
But l don't see Freddy
<i>Y</i>ou best

811
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:26,431
not even try to spit rhymes, dude
'Cause when you spit

812
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,029
all l ever see is chewed-up food

813
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,133
Yeah, that's how we roII!
That's how we do!

814
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:32,231
HoId on!

815
00:44:32,343 --> 00:44:33,640
l know you didn't just go there

816
00:44:33,745 --> 00:44:36,771
l got more skills than you
in my one and only nut hair

817
00:44:37,048 --> 00:44:38,379
Nice, man, nice.

818
00:44:38,983 --> 00:44:41,645
So you better step off
before you insult me and mine

819
00:44:41,753 --> 00:44:44,415
'Cause if you decide to step on, see
l'm like a land mine

820
00:44:44,522 --> 00:44:45,819
Boom!

821
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:51,089
Oh, my God, look
it's a punkass rapping

822
00:44:51,262 --> 00:44:53,696
He say one more word
l'm gonna have to bitch-slap him

823
00:44:53,798 --> 00:44:56,460
So surprised you're moving
ass is so damn fat

824
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,833
<i>Y</i>ou're lucky l don't hit you
with my Wiffle, Wiffle Ball bat

825
00:45:00,371 --> 00:45:03,431
Can't hurt my head with a bat
l'm the lncredible Hulk

826
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:06,942
l'm like Costco
l'm serving ass kickings in bulk

827
00:45:07,045 --> 00:45:09,707
<i>Y</i>ou don't like my words
Mister King of the School?

828
00:45:09,814 --> 00:45:12,977
Well, guess what?
<i>Y</i>ou can suck on my family's jewels

829
00:45:13,117 --> 00:45:14,448
Bitch!

830
00:45:23,228 --> 00:45:25,287
That was awesome.

831
00:45:25,396 --> 00:45:26,693
What have I just done?

832
00:45:26,798 --> 00:45:28,356
Hey, that was amazing. I mean,

833
00:45:28,466 --> 00:45:29,956
teIIing him to suck on
your two famiIy jeweIs

834
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:31,763
was in questionabIe taste, but stiII...

835
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:34,168
I know, I got caught up
in the moment, okay?

836
00:45:34,272 --> 00:45:36,365
Keep waIking.
I don't want to get shot Iike Tupac.

837
00:45:36,474 --> 00:45:39,409
You know, most of those peopIe
were cheering for you.

838
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,536
ReaIIy? That couId be good.
Maybe DriIIbit was right.

839
00:45:46,651 --> 00:45:48,312
Think you're so funny?

840
00:45:48,419 --> 00:45:51,445
Good. 'Cause you're not gonna Iaugh
when you're dead.

841
00:45:51,556 --> 00:45:54,787
You're gonna get it now,
worse than ever.

842
00:45:55,026 --> 00:45:56,118
AII of you.

843
00:45:56,928 --> 00:45:59,453
Ryan, hoIdback technique.

844
00:46:00,064 --> 00:46:02,191
You don't Iike the fact that
he's better than you, FiIkins!

845
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,791
You better back the heII off before I...

846
00:46:08,673 --> 00:46:13,804
-Thanks for hoIding him for me.
-HoIy crap, you guys are retarded!

847
00:46:17,482 --> 00:46:19,416
How did he do so much damage
with one punch?

848
00:46:19,517 --> 00:46:21,747
It's Iike his fist is the size
of your whoIe face.

849
00:46:21,853 --> 00:46:23,684
I guess it's true.

850
00:46:23,788 --> 00:46:25,016
Rap reaIIy does promote vioIence.

851
00:46:25,123 --> 00:46:27,591
Yeah, but the question is, where was
DriIIbit when we needed him?

852
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:29,284
Maybe he got caIIed to the bIack ops.

853
00:46:29,394 --> 00:46:31,157
Wade, come on.
You reaIIy beIieve that garbage?

854
00:46:31,262 --> 00:46:33,321
There's my IittIe soIdiers.

855
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:36,867
There are my pooper troopers.

856
00:46:36,968 --> 00:46:40,904
Hey, sorry I missed that waIkie-taIkie
caII. I had something come...

857
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:45,770
-What the heII happened to you?
-FiIkins punched me.

858
00:46:46,644 --> 00:46:48,874
-FiIkins did that to you?
-Yeah.

859
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,140
Where were you?

860
00:46:50,248 --> 00:46:52,443
-With one punch?
-Where were you?

861
00:46:53,351 --> 00:46:56,548
-Oh, crap. I'm sorry.
-Stop.

862
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,883
-No, just Iet me get the bIood off.
-No. Stop.

863
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,117
Man. Here, sit down for a second.

864
00:47:01,225 --> 00:47:03,955
-Crap. It Iooks painfuI.
-Yeah, it is.

865
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:06,124
-Here, Iet me put a IittIe pressure on it.
-No.

866
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,822
HoId it, hoId it, hoId it.

867
00:47:07,932 --> 00:47:09,627
Ryan had a rap off with FiIkins.

868
00:47:09,734 --> 00:47:12,464
-You had a rap off?
-You said to find common ground.

869
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,733
He said he was Iike Costco,
serving up ass kickings in buIk.

870
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,933
That's what you said?
That's not common ground.

871
00:47:18,042 --> 00:47:19,771
Even though it's funny.

872
00:47:19,877 --> 00:47:22,072
That's not exactIy what I meant
when I said common ground.

873
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,978
Why didn't you get punched?
Why'd he sIug you?

874
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,074
'Cause of your briIIiant
hoIdback technique.

875
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:29,949
The hoIdback technique?
You reaIIy tried that?

876
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:33,649
Yeah. Bottom Iine is
your advice backfired.

877
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:35,350
Now we're more screwed than ever.

878
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,621
AII because you wanted to protect
the hobbit over here.

879
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,253
-Hey, Iet's just stop for a second.
-I am not a hobbit.

880
00:47:39,364 --> 00:47:41,161
-You're a damn hobbit, okay?
-I am not!

881
00:47:41,265 --> 00:47:44,894
HoId it! Hey.
Emmit's not a hobbit, I don't think.

882
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,494
ProbIem isn't the hoIdback technique,

883
00:47:47,605 --> 00:47:50,733
aIthough I don't think you guys
had it perfected enough to try.

884
00:47:50,842 --> 00:47:52,434
The probIem is Randy
starts rapping insuIts.

885
00:47:52,543 --> 00:47:55,444
It's not Randy! Okay? It's Ryan!

886
00:47:55,546 --> 00:47:59,880
And aII this taIk about you being there
when you're not there, it's buII! Okay?

887
00:48:00,385 --> 00:48:02,250
I'm tired of your nonsense! You're fired!

888
00:48:02,353 --> 00:48:06,551
Hey! Sit down here.
Sit down here for a second.

889
00:48:06,657 --> 00:48:11,287
AII of you, sit down. You take the bass
out of your voice when you taIk to me.

890
00:48:11,963 --> 00:48:13,931
Now, we just compIeted phase one.

891
00:48:14,032 --> 00:48:16,694
See if this guy has any mettIe.
And guess what we found out?

892
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:20,396
FiIkins does have some mettIe.
So now we move to phase two.

893
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:23,941
Know what phase two is?
Direct contact.

894
00:48:24,108 --> 00:48:27,703
That's where I come in.
Because I wiII not Iet this happen again,

895
00:48:27,812 --> 00:48:29,712
if I can heIp it.

896
00:48:29,814 --> 00:48:31,509
So what's the pIan?

897
00:48:31,616 --> 00:48:33,083
-The pIan?
-Yeah.

898
00:48:36,821 --> 00:48:38,846
How earIy do you guys
have to get up for schooI?

899
00:48:38,956 --> 00:48:39,945
-7:00.
-7:00.

900
00:48:40,058 --> 00:48:44,461
Oh, God. Okay.
Tomorrow, we aII go in together.

901
00:48:51,669 --> 00:48:54,661
Hey, Wade, what's up?

902
00:48:55,873 --> 00:48:57,238
Where'd you get the shiner?

903
00:48:57,341 --> 00:48:59,468
Come in here, boy. TaIk to me.

904
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,148
I was protecting this one kid
in my schooI

905
00:49:05,249 --> 00:49:08,150
from a bunch of buIIies
and one of them punched me.

906
00:49:08,252 --> 00:49:11,380
What? Why wouId you protect
the kid from a buIIy?

907
00:49:11,622 --> 00:49:14,523
So he doesn't get beat up.

908
00:49:14,892 --> 00:49:17,486
Then you're interfering
with the naturaI order.

909
00:49:18,863 --> 00:49:20,854
When I was a kid, I was kind of a buIIy.

910
00:49:20,965 --> 00:49:24,128
But it's not a bad thing. There was
this kid. I don't know what it was.

911
00:49:24,235 --> 00:49:28,194
Maybe it was his stupid face.
But he'd just reaIIy get under my skin.

912
00:49:28,306 --> 00:49:31,275
So I pushed him around a IittIe bit,
caIIed him some hurtfuI names,

913
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:34,742
and I honestIy think, if I met him today,
he'd thank me for it.

914
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,679
I prepared him for the harshness
of the reaI worId.

915
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,247
Thanks, Jim.

916
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,616
I'm a resource, Wade.
You shouId use me more often.

917
00:49:46,591 --> 00:49:48,024
Is it Iocked?

918
00:49:48,626 --> 00:49:50,355
-You got Iunch money?
-Yep.

919
00:49:50,628 --> 00:49:52,789
-You got any tests today?
-See you and the questions.

920
00:49:52,897 --> 00:49:55,627
Don't fresh-off to any of your teachers.

921
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,660
AII right, come here,
give mommy a kiss.

922
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:00,999
Come on, punky-wunky. I Iove you.

923
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,400
-Okay.
-Be good.

924
00:50:09,547 --> 00:50:12,311
-Bye. I Iove you.
-Bye. I Iove you, Mommy!

925
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:14,179
''I Iove you, Mommy.''

926
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,781
BIack ops in the hizzouse.

927
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,289
This oId soIdier couId use
a kissy from mommy.

928
00:50:20,391 --> 00:50:22,052
Come on.
I'm going in to the schooI today.

929
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,219
DriIIbit is going in. Very visibIe.
Let's do it.

930
00:50:24,328 --> 00:50:26,455
-You can't go in there Iooking Iike that.
-Why?

931
00:50:26,564 --> 00:50:28,464
You Iook Iike CrocodiIe Dundee
or something.

932
00:50:28,566 --> 00:50:30,261
Screw you. What're you taIking about?

933
00:50:30,368 --> 00:50:31,699
I'm just saying we need to cIean you up.

934
00:50:31,802 --> 00:50:34,635
Wrong. This soIdier doesn't cIean up.
What you see is what you get.

935
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:36,536
DriIIbit, you just don't Iook
Iike a teacher.

936
00:50:36,641 --> 00:50:38,939
I mean, we need you to bIend in.
The camoufIage technique.

937
00:50:39,043 --> 00:50:41,273
-In my house. Come on.
-Let's go.

938
00:50:41,412 --> 00:50:43,972
''CamoufIage technique''? I Iike that.

939
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:49,313
...if I remember how to do this.
It reaIIy is strong enough for a man.

940
00:50:59,664 --> 00:51:02,326
Did your dad Ieave any socks behind?

941
00:51:03,334 --> 00:51:06,770
How many tardies can you have
before they give you a detention?

942
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:10,942
Emmit, you're drying my eyebaIIs.

943
00:51:14,312 --> 00:51:18,214
AII right, here's our cIass scheduIes
and a detaiIed map of the schooI.

944
00:51:18,316 --> 00:51:21,285
We have the first cIass together,
so just meet us by the Life SkiIIs room

945
00:51:21,385 --> 00:51:22,477
so you can waIk us to our Iockers.

946
00:51:22,587 --> 00:51:24,350
Okay, now, remember,
I'm not just gonna waIk in there

947
00:51:24,455 --> 00:51:26,719
and start kicking ass, okay?
I got to protect you guys,

948
00:51:26,824 --> 00:51:29,258
but I need to bIend in and Iay Iow.

949
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,820
I'm gonna be visibIe to you guys,
but invisibIe to everyone eIse.

950
00:51:41,038 --> 00:51:45,407
That's a Iook that says,
''I have no idea what I'm doing here.''

951
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:50,739
AII first-time subs have it.
WeIcome to McKinIey!

952
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:55,817
-Thanks. Was it that obvious?
-WeII, yeah, a IittIe bit.

953
00:51:56,954 --> 00:51:58,080
Whoa!

954
00:51:58,389 --> 00:52:01,825
Not you kids. PIease, go to cIass.
Go, go, go. Get away from me.

955
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,493
You, second fIoor, teachers' Iounge.

956
00:52:05,596 --> 00:52:07,587
They'II give you your assignment
up there. It's right over there.

957
00:52:07,698 --> 00:52:10,360
-I'm gonna head up there. Okay.
-Yep? You got it.

958
00:52:19,243 --> 00:52:20,733
How're you doing?

959
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,013
Teachers' Iounge. They're aII the same.

960
00:52:28,486 --> 00:52:31,250
Put your names on the food. Smart.

961
00:52:31,956 --> 00:52:32,980
Sneaky.

962
00:52:34,592 --> 00:52:37,152
-See Grey's Anatomy Iast night?
-Yeah.

963
00:52:38,696 --> 00:52:39,924
-Hey, Lis.
-Hi.

964
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,896
Got haIf an orange with your name on it.

965
00:52:41,999 --> 00:52:43,466
Oh, no, thanks.

966
00:52:58,482 --> 00:53:01,576
-Can I heIp you?
-No. With what?

967
00:53:02,286 --> 00:53:04,914
-Are you Iost?
-No. Why?

968
00:53:05,456 --> 00:53:08,983
-You Iook Iike a Iost parent.
-No.

969
00:53:09,126 --> 00:53:12,027
No. I'm a substitute.

970
00:53:13,998 --> 00:53:18,196
-For what?
-For whatever needs substituting.

971
00:53:19,904 --> 00:53:24,000
Yeah, they'II just pIug me in.
I think I'm just gonna wait here untiI,

972
00:53:24,108 --> 00:53:27,202
you know, if they need me in
French, then that's where I'II go.

973
00:53:27,311 --> 00:53:30,007
-You know French?
-A IittIe bit. Yeah.

974
00:53:30,114 --> 00:53:33,777
Enough to get by,
or enough to teach these animaIs.

975
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,015
-What do you teach?
-EngIish.

976
00:53:38,823 --> 00:53:40,154
My native tongue.

977
00:53:43,928 --> 00:53:45,486
I'm Lisa Zachey.

978
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:49,789
Now is that Miss or Missus Zachey?

979
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:55,270
-Miss.
-Miss. It had to be. Enchanté.

980
00:53:57,341 --> 00:53:59,275
And who are you?

981
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:01,968
DriII... Dr. IIIbit.

982
00:54:02,913 --> 00:54:03,880
Oh.

983
00:54:03,981 --> 00:54:05,209
-Yeah.
-A doctor.

984
00:54:05,316 --> 00:54:09,013
Teacher. Teacher and a doctor.
Just want to heIp.

985
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,147
PeopIe don't care how I do it.
Just give me a chance to heIp.

986
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:17,291
-You want some hot coffee?
-OnIy in the worst way.

987
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,355
Who can give me
another name for gonorrhea?

988
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:26,768
That's a IittIe hint.

989
00:54:26,871 --> 00:54:31,274
That's right, the cIap. Or the drip.

990
00:54:31,709 --> 00:54:33,677
AII right, Dane? Get the Iights.

991
00:54:33,778 --> 00:54:38,772
ln the male, the bacteria of gonorrhea
usually enters by way of the urethra.

992
00:54:38,883 --> 00:54:41,909
From two to five days later,
the guy feels a painful burning,

993
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:43,748
particularly when he urinates...

994
00:54:43,854 --> 00:54:46,152
They make these things to scare us.
I'm not scared of this.

995
00:54:46,257 --> 00:54:49,226
...looks like this.

996
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,794
-I reaIIy Iike your suit.
-Yeah. I reaIIy Iike your everything.

997
00:54:53,898 --> 00:54:55,422
Now what do we do?

998
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:58,024
Not many teachers
can afford a suit Iike that.

999
00:54:58,135 --> 00:55:00,069
-Yeah?
-If he wants to eat.

1000
00:55:01,238 --> 00:55:03,468
WeII, I mainIy eat out of a dumpster.

1001
00:55:05,643 --> 00:55:07,668
I shouId try that.
I need some new dresses.

1002
00:55:07,778 --> 00:55:11,737
Don't. Or if you do, stay away from
the one at Ocean and WiIshire.

1003
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:15,615
That's mine. SeriousIy, stay out of it.

1004
00:55:16,954 --> 00:55:19,923
-What are we doing? Let's go.
-I don't know.

1005
00:55:20,024 --> 00:55:21,889
You're a bad boy.

1006
00:55:22,226 --> 00:55:25,718
-Maybe I need a detention.
-You're funny.

1007
00:55:26,897 --> 00:55:29,661
-I'm not joking.
-Me, either.

1008
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,806
Look, I want nothing more
than to spend the rest of the day

1009
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:41,173
sitting on this couch with you,

1010
00:55:41,278 --> 00:55:44,975
but I got to get to cIass because
my students need me. Okay?

1011
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:48,846
No. You stiII have five minutes
before the next cIass.

1012
00:55:49,186 --> 00:55:50,175
We do?

1013
00:55:50,287 --> 00:55:54,485
And you seem Iike someone who couId
accompIish a Iot in five minutes.

1014
00:55:54,859 --> 00:55:56,656
I hope so.

1015
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,854
AIthough five minutes
might be four too many.

1016
00:56:03,434 --> 00:56:05,129
Let's go, Iet's go!

1017
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,830
We reaIIy Iike Life SkiIIs.
Can we just stay in the room, maybe?

1018
00:56:07,938 --> 00:56:10,099
Why don't you practice
some Iife skiIIs out here in the haIIway?

1019
00:56:10,207 --> 00:56:11,799
It's just as important.

1020
00:56:12,743 --> 00:56:13,732
Okay, where is he?

1021
00:56:13,844 --> 00:56:16,677
This is buII. Maybe I shouId
just beat the crap out of you two.

1022
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,645
There's Brooke!

1023
00:56:23,687 --> 00:56:25,154
Oh, no. There he is.

1024
00:56:31,862 --> 00:56:33,056
I think I'd better get...

1025
00:56:33,163 --> 00:56:34,653
When are you free? I want to see you.

1026
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:36,926
-I have sixth period free.
-Sixth period? Okay.

1027
00:56:37,034 --> 00:56:38,695
I think I have that period free, aIso.

1028
00:56:38,802 --> 00:56:40,633
Why don't we meet back here? Okay?

1029
00:56:40,738 --> 00:56:42,228
-Okay.
-Meet me right here?

1030
00:56:42,339 --> 00:56:43,829
I'II keep the couch warm.

1031
00:56:43,941 --> 00:56:46,910
We better check the tags to make sure
this couch is fIame retardant.

1032
00:56:47,011 --> 00:56:48,308
-I wiII.
-You know?

1033
00:56:48,479 --> 00:56:50,276
You know what I mean?
FIame retardant?

1034
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:51,939
-Yes.
-'Cause you're hot.

1035
00:56:53,517 --> 00:56:56,077
Where is Life SkiIIs?

1036
00:56:58,556 --> 00:57:00,786
DriIIbit, come in, pIease!
Where are you?

1037
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:01,880
Drillbit, come in!

1038
00:57:01,992 --> 00:57:04,517
I don't know!
I can't understand Emmit's map!

1039
00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:08,089
-Go, go, go!
-Come on, Emmit. Come on.

1040
00:57:08,532 --> 00:57:11,592
-Crap!
-I knew DriIIbit was a fraud.

1041
00:57:11,702 --> 00:57:13,795
-I toId you!
-He's gonna be here!

1042
00:57:13,904 --> 00:57:15,098
Life SkiIIs!

1043
00:57:15,272 --> 00:57:17,866
I need Life SkiIIs!

1044
00:57:18,442 --> 00:57:19,841
Out of my way!

1045
00:57:27,351 --> 00:57:29,911
Open the door!

1046
00:57:30,054 --> 00:57:31,385
How is that up to code?

1047
00:57:31,488 --> 00:57:33,820
Excuse me!
Mordor CastIe coming through!

1048
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,522
Excuse me!
Mordor CastIe coming through!

1049
00:57:51,475 --> 00:57:53,534
This is reaI! This is not a driII.

1050
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:55,509
Everybody, cIear the haII!

1051
00:57:55,613 --> 00:57:58,377
That means you! Let's go!
CIear the haII!

1052
00:58:00,884 --> 00:58:03,148
The freak actuaIIy came through, huh?

1053
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:05,649
Awesome!

1054
00:58:13,063 --> 00:58:14,826
-Hoo-rah.
-Hoo-rah.

1055
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:18,364
AII right.

1056
00:58:27,277 --> 00:58:29,302
Mister FiIkins!
Why don't you just come up

1057
00:58:29,413 --> 00:58:32,177
to the front of the cIass and read from

1058
00:58:32,282 --> 00:58:34,773
The Collected Works
of the Romantic Poets?

1059
00:58:39,623 --> 00:58:41,989
''I Iike kissing this and that of you

1060
00:58:42,092 --> 00:58:47,086
''I Iike sIowIy stroking the shocking fuzz''

1061
00:58:51,235 --> 00:58:54,671
Hey, aren't you the guy that
kicked FiIkins' butt freestyIing?

1062
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:58,031
You better beIieve it.
They caII me T-Dog.

1063
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:01,770
-Wow, that's cooI.
-He is so cute!

1064
00:59:01,879 --> 00:59:02,846
Wow.

1065
00:59:02,946 --> 00:59:05,210
Wade, this is Drillbit. Come in. Wade?

1066
00:59:05,816 --> 00:59:08,512
-<i>Y</i>eah?
-FiIkins is heading east down the stairs.

1067
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:11,179
The first stairweII. He's coming
down now. Watch your ass.

1068
00:59:11,288 --> 00:59:12,812
Read you. Copy. Roger.

1069
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:15,824
F.Y.I., I just heard this pack of girIs
yapping, and your girI, Brooke,

1070
00:59:15,926 --> 00:59:19,692
just got cast in Romeo and Juliet.
You might want to check that out.

1071
00:59:20,164 --> 00:59:24,191
Madam, madam, your Iady mother
is coming to your chamber!

1072
00:59:25,169 --> 00:59:27,831
The day is broke, be wary, Iook about.

1073
00:59:31,075 --> 00:59:34,408
Come on! You're dogging it!
Faster! Faster!

1074
00:59:34,511 --> 00:59:36,313
Go! I want to see some more!

1075
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:41,779
Go! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go! One more!

1076
00:59:41,919 --> 00:59:43,784
And you guys!
I don't want you just watching!

1077
00:59:43,887 --> 00:59:46,447
Do some bass fishing! Then reeI it in!

1078
00:59:46,557 --> 00:59:47,615
Come on!

1079
00:59:47,725 --> 00:59:50,250
Let's go, keep going!
Work some thumbs!

1080
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,021
For texting!

1081
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:54,992
Look out, huh?

1082
00:59:55,365 --> 00:59:59,267
-How was schooI, Professor?
-It is great.

1083
00:59:59,803 --> 01:00:03,637
And as Iong as you got a coffee cup
in your hand, nobody says anything.

1084
01:00:06,376 --> 01:00:08,139
I was thinking
about writing a paper on...

1085
01:00:08,245 --> 01:00:09,735
-Hey!
-What the...

1086
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:10,871
Coffee cup.

1087
01:00:10,981 --> 01:00:13,711
Now, Castro,
he knew that he was not gonna get

1088
01:00:13,817 --> 01:00:15,614
any action with MariIyn Monroe.

1089
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:18,119
And that is why John F. Kennedy
was shot.

1090
01:00:22,526 --> 01:00:25,825
-Don!
-HeIIo, feIIow teacher.

1091
01:00:31,668 --> 01:00:33,761
Come on, guys, hit the showers!

1092
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:39,332
Look, my rope's too short.
I can't get down.

1093
01:00:39,443 --> 01:00:42,412
Where you going? Get back here!

1094
01:00:43,247 --> 01:00:45,715
-Yo, hoId on!
-What is this?

1095
01:00:45,816 --> 01:00:48,046
Ronnie, Iet yourseIf down.

1096
01:00:59,296 --> 01:01:04,131
Happy birthday, Dr. lllbit

1097
01:01:04,234 --> 01:01:09,331
Happy birthday to you

1098
01:01:58,055 --> 01:02:01,957
Hey, T-Dog. You've got to admit
hiring DriIIbit was a good idea.

1099
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:03,754
-Okay, you're right.
-See?

1100
01:02:03,927 --> 01:02:07,294
The freak's actuaIIy worth aII the money
we're spending on him, I guess.

1101
01:02:07,397 --> 01:02:08,887
Good morning.

1102
01:02:09,266 --> 01:02:12,724
-Great coffee this morning, Dr. IIIbit.
-Enjoy it.

1103
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,636
-You know, I reaIIy Iike it here.
-You're doing a great job, DriIIbit.

1104
01:02:15,739 --> 01:02:16,865
I know I am.

1105
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,937
Come here, come here, come here.

1106
01:02:19,476 --> 01:02:21,569
Okay, quick. Pop quiz. You Iike a girI.

1107
01:02:21,678 --> 01:02:23,339
You're compIeteIy shocked
that she Iikes you.

1108
01:02:23,447 --> 01:02:26,473
Things are aIready just crazy hot,
just loco.

1109
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,608
But now you'd Iike to ask her out.

1110
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:31,882
And you're not sure if
she's just in it for the sex.

1111
01:02:31,989 --> 01:02:34,150
And you haven't been
on a date in forever.

1112
01:02:34,258 --> 01:02:35,782
And you're a IittIe bit afraid,

1113
01:02:35,893 --> 01:02:37,690
and you don't know
what the heII you're doing, anyway.

1114
01:02:37,794 --> 01:02:39,318
WeII, I can't reaIIy reIate to that,

1115
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:41,954
but what I wouId do is just
join every cIub she's in

1116
01:02:42,065 --> 01:02:44,625
and eventuaIIy work up
the nerve to taIk to her.

1117
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,203
-And how's that working for you?
-Not at aII.

1118
01:02:47,304 --> 01:02:49,772
Okay, Iook. One shouId do the opposite.

1119
01:02:49,873 --> 01:02:51,500
-Yeah, probabIy.
-Okay.

1120
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:55,878
CongratuIations, you just passed.
Hey, scram. Scram. Crotch bIocker.

1121
01:02:59,082 --> 01:03:00,208
-Hey.
-Hey.

1122
01:03:00,317 --> 01:03:02,842
-Look, you Iook pretty.
-Thank you.

1123
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,947
You know,
I haven't been on a Iot of dates,

1124
01:03:05,055 --> 01:03:07,751
and I reaIIy don't know the way
this is supposed to work,

1125
01:03:07,858 --> 01:03:09,348
because we kind of skipped that part.

1126
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:13,828
But wouId you ever want to get together
after schooI and maybe hang out?

1127
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:16,862
I'm sorry.

1128
01:03:17,267 --> 01:03:21,829
RuIe 35A in the teacher's manuaI states
that you cannot date other teachers.

1129
01:03:22,606 --> 01:03:27,270
Oh, reaIIy. Yeah.
ProbabIy a good poIicy.

1130
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:28,736
Yeah.

1131
01:03:29,046 --> 01:03:31,640
So it's a good thing you're a doctor.

1132
01:03:34,284 --> 01:03:35,842
So, yes.

1133
01:03:38,622 --> 01:03:40,920
-I'II see you tonight?
-Okay.

1134
01:03:41,992 --> 01:03:45,155
The BattIe of Sekigahara

1135
01:03:45,629 --> 01:03:50,089
when Kanetsugu mocked
Tokunaga's abuses,

1136
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:53,798
which onIy infuriated Tokunaga

1137
01:03:54,571 --> 01:04:01,170
who then summoned Toyotomi
and united Japan.

1138
01:04:01,678 --> 01:04:04,146
And kept the IocaI feudaI Iords
from warring.

1139
01:04:04,247 --> 01:04:07,080
Hey. What are you doing in this cIub?

1140
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:08,617
I'm Asian.

1141
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,209
He died. Then...

1142
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,720
-No, you aren't.
-Yeah. A IittIe bit.

1143
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,357
ReaIIy?

1144
01:04:16,093 --> 01:04:19,119
-You don't even Iook a IittIe Asian.
-Yeah, I know.

1145
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:21,964
The West attacked first.

1146
01:04:22,766 --> 01:04:26,361
So how come I see you in, Iike,
so many activities I'm in?

1147
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:31,404
Just... I joined some of the cIubs
you were in because

1148
01:04:31,508 --> 01:04:33,408
I wanted to have a chance to taIk to you.

1149
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:38,812
Wakisaka, 990 men.
Ankokuji, 1 ,800 men.

1150
01:04:39,449 --> 01:04:42,316
So you're not Asian.

1151
01:04:42,419 --> 01:04:43,386
No.

1152
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:47,889
WeII, maybe somewhere way back.

1153
01:04:48,158 --> 01:04:52,993
Chosokabe, 6,600 men.
This is exciting, don't you think?

1154
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:54,495
AII these men.

1155
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:56,599
WeII, you can't quit now.

1156
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,759
I'm gonna make you come
to aII our meetings.

1157
01:04:58,869 --> 01:05:00,962
Membership is way down this year.

1158
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:02,766
Okay. I can do that.

1159
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:07,867
-Is everything okay at schooI?
-Yeah. Everything's fine. I'm busy.

1160
01:05:07,978 --> 01:05:12,039
Honey, I know there's a Iot of pressure
on kids once they get to high schooI.

1161
01:05:12,149 --> 01:05:13,776
And there are kids who are gonna
want to be your friend,

1162
01:05:13,884 --> 01:05:16,478
but they'II aIso want you
to take their drugs.

1163
01:05:17,187 --> 01:05:19,621
I just noticed that you seem
to be out of money a Iot IateIy,

1164
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:22,055
and I want to make sure
you're not spending your money on that.

1165
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:24,787
No! I'm not doing drugs, Mom.
I promise.

1166
01:05:24,895 --> 01:05:27,090
Coach says drugs are for Iosers.

1167
01:05:28,632 --> 01:05:30,327
You sure you're not high?

1168
01:05:31,168 --> 01:05:32,135
No!

1169
01:05:32,235 --> 01:05:34,032
WeII, I notice you're reaIIy going
at your food.

1170
01:05:34,137 --> 01:05:37,402
-Got the munchies?
-Anyways, we just worry about you.

1171
01:05:37,908 --> 01:05:39,000
I understand that.

1172
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:42,567
AIso, I'm missing a siIver pIatter
that was in the Iiving room.

1173
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:44,544
-Have you seen it?
-I'm taking Home Ec.

1174
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:46,843
We needed serving trays
for appetizers. Sorry.

1175
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,577
Yeah, weII, come to think of it,
I'm missing a watch.

1176
01:05:48,685 --> 01:05:50,516
You didn't take that to Home Ec, too,
did you?

1177
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,679
Oh, yeah.
We're making watch cupcakes, Jim.

1178
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:54,484
Watch it, wise guy.

1179
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:01,620
Hey.

1180
01:06:02,899 --> 01:06:05,868
CarefuI, Wade. You don't sneak up
on somebody Iike that.

1181
01:06:05,969 --> 01:06:07,197
-Sorry.
-No, it's okay.

1182
01:06:07,304 --> 01:06:09,204
But I couId have jumped up
and kiIIed you in two moves,

1183
01:06:09,306 --> 01:06:11,968
and then, I don't know, I'd feeI guiIty.

1184
01:06:12,075 --> 01:06:14,703
-I taIked to Brooke.
-ReaIIy? Have a seat.

1185
01:06:14,811 --> 01:06:16,836
-I think she might Iike me.
-Yeah?

1186
01:06:16,947 --> 01:06:18,778
Yeah. At Ieast a IittIe bit.

1187
01:06:18,882 --> 01:06:20,816
That's aII you need.
Get your foot in the door.

1188
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:23,385
I don't think I wouId have had
the confidence to have tried without you.

1189
01:06:23,487 --> 01:06:24,818
-I mean...
-Come on.

1190
01:06:24,921 --> 01:06:27,151
It's been great having someone
around who, Iike, Iikes me

1191
01:06:27,257 --> 01:06:29,384
and isn't making fun of me
or teIIing me to join the footbaII team

1192
01:06:29,493 --> 01:06:30,960
Iike my stepdad.

1193
01:06:31,061 --> 01:06:34,087
Just do your best. Be aII you can be.
What's the Army aIways say?

1194
01:06:34,197 --> 01:06:35,824
''Have it your way.''

1195
01:06:37,501 --> 01:06:39,799
I think that's Burger King.

1196
01:06:42,105 --> 01:06:43,936
Where do you think they got it from?

1197
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,567
PIus, what you did.
The whoIe bIack ops bodyguard thing.

1198
01:06:49,346 --> 01:06:50,677
WeII, yeah.

1199
01:06:52,349 --> 01:06:55,011
Yeah. I actuaIIy wanted to be a doctor.

1200
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,778
Yeah.

1201
01:06:58,488 --> 01:07:02,891
But my oId man was an Army coIoneI,
wouIdn't pay for me to go to coIIege.

1202
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:08,923
Yeah. He aIways said, ''DriIIbit, you're
not the doctor type. You're stupid.''

1203
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:12,999
I guess he thought that
because I didn't get good grades

1204
01:07:13,103 --> 01:07:15,071
or Iike to go to schooI.

1205
01:07:18,708 --> 01:07:21,472
I don't know. Maybe he was right.

1206
01:07:21,578 --> 01:07:23,546
So you became an army of one.

1207
01:07:24,781 --> 01:07:26,271
An army of one.

1208
01:07:27,751 --> 01:07:28,809
Here.

1209
01:07:29,753 --> 01:07:31,516
We made this for you.

1210
01:07:32,656 --> 01:07:33,987
An army of four.

1211
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,694
I don't know if you understand,

1212
01:07:38,795 --> 01:07:42,891
but before we met you, we thought
our Iives were gonna suck forever.

1213
01:07:42,999 --> 01:07:44,489
At Ieast I did.

1214
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:51,769
WeII, you're right. I don't understand
because of how hardened I am.

1215
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:56,071
Tough thing about what I do
is I can't Iet my guard down.

1216
01:07:58,014 --> 01:08:00,380
WeII, for what it's worth,

1217
01:08:00,483 --> 01:08:04,010
I hope after aII this is done,
you'II stiII be my friend.

1218
01:08:04,154 --> 01:08:05,121
Bye.

1219
01:08:13,897 --> 01:08:16,024
This is so beautifuI.

1220
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:18,294
I Iove coming out here.

1221
01:08:18,401 --> 01:08:22,895
ActuaIIy, I used to Iive in a smaII pIace
near here untiI it got re-zoned.

1222
01:08:23,707 --> 01:08:24,731
Yeah.

1223
01:08:24,841 --> 01:08:26,934
-That's a shame.
-Nah. ProbabIy just as weII.

1224
01:08:27,043 --> 01:08:28,772
Hey, stranger.

1225
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:32,304
Can you spare some change, stranger?

1226
01:08:32,582 --> 01:08:33,981
Here you go.

1227
01:08:36,219 --> 01:08:37,345
-Sucker.
-Yeah.

1228
01:08:38,722 --> 01:08:41,054
Got some money for some food? Hi.

1229
01:08:43,493 --> 01:08:45,256
No time to be cheap.

1230
01:08:46,162 --> 01:08:49,063
-Wow.
-Good evening, sir. Can I get a doIIar?

1231
01:08:51,401 --> 01:08:52,800
-CooI. Thank you very much.
-Yeah.

1232
01:08:52,902 --> 01:08:54,927
Hey, can I get another doIIar?

1233
01:08:59,142 --> 01:09:00,769
You Iook famiIiar.

1234
01:09:02,512 --> 01:09:04,309
You know that you're a better person
than me,

1235
01:09:04,414 --> 01:09:08,851
because, I hate to say it,
but I just get irritated.

1236
01:09:08,952 --> 01:09:12,683
They irritate the shit out of me.
I feIt Iike...

1237
01:09:12,789 --> 01:09:16,919
But then you have to think,
they work for the grace of God, so...

1238
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:20,292
-That's cute.
-Hey, you want to see something cooI?

1239
01:09:20,397 --> 01:09:21,694
Come here.

1240
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:23,692
-There.
-Thank you.

1241
01:09:26,102 --> 01:09:28,468
So what eIse do you have in here?

1242
01:09:28,872 --> 01:09:30,863
-Two-buck Chuck.
-You know that wine?

1243
01:09:30,974 --> 01:09:32,703
I Iove this wine.

1244
01:09:32,809 --> 01:09:35,573
-That's aII a teacher can afford.
-TeII me about it.

1245
01:09:35,879 --> 01:09:37,141
Get this.

1246
01:09:38,481 --> 01:09:40,278
And here I was aII worried that
you were gonna take me

1247
01:09:40,383 --> 01:09:42,874
to some hip dance cIub or something.

1248
01:09:43,887 --> 01:09:46,287
That's definiteIy not me.

1249
01:09:46,856 --> 01:09:48,653
But, no, I'm actuaIIy more of

1250
01:09:48,758 --> 01:09:51,386
a kind of simpIe,
just down to earth outdoorsman.

1251
01:09:51,661 --> 01:09:53,993
I Iike that you don't try too hard.

1252
01:09:54,664 --> 01:09:58,122
The truth is,
this is me trying reaIIy, reaIIy hard.

1253
01:09:58,668 --> 01:10:00,033
That's cute.

1254
01:10:03,006 --> 01:10:05,600
Look, I want to taIk to you. I mean...

1255
01:10:09,145 --> 01:10:12,239
There's some things
I want you to know about me.

1256
01:10:12,349 --> 01:10:16,046
I want us to Iook each other in the eye,
and I want us to get it out on the tabIe,

1257
01:10:16,152 --> 01:10:19,246
and we just, you know,
we Iisten, and there's no judgment.

1258
01:10:19,356 --> 01:10:24,726
God. You're just so great. You're reaIIy
just Iike the perfect guy for me.

1259
01:10:25,195 --> 01:10:27,527
-ReaIIy?
-I'm serious.

1260
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:31,964
You're just beautifuI,
and you're nice to me, and it's so great.

1261
01:10:32,602 --> 01:10:36,629
'Cause I'm reaIIy just aIways attracted
to just such dirtbag guys.

1262
01:10:36,806 --> 01:10:37,830
They're out there.

1263
01:10:37,941 --> 01:10:41,570
I'm a reaI Ioser magnet.
It's, Iike, on some unconscious IeveI,

1264
01:10:41,678 --> 01:10:46,809
I just need to be with a guy who has
absoIuteIy nothing going for him.

1265
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:50,875
You know, just some Ioser,
some bum Iying pig.

1266
01:10:50,987 --> 01:10:52,318
-Stop, stop, stop, stop.
-You know, just...

1267
01:10:52,422 --> 01:10:53,411
Stop it.

1268
01:10:53,523 --> 01:10:57,425
I get it. You made some bad choices,
and who hasn't?

1269
01:10:58,194 --> 01:11:00,492
It's just you were starting
to rant a IittIe bit.

1270
01:11:00,597 --> 01:11:02,121
It's just I'm happy to be
with somebody...

1271
01:11:02,232 --> 01:11:03,199
I know.

1272
01:11:03,299 --> 01:11:06,132
You're with a doctor now.

1273
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:09,338
Yeah. Thank God.

1274
01:11:11,107 --> 01:11:12,802
Let's just kiss.

1275
01:11:26,523 --> 01:11:28,081
Did you do that?

1276
01:11:28,591 --> 01:11:31,151
Kid just jumped out of the bushes
and started jamming. That's weird.

1277
01:11:32,896 --> 01:11:34,989
I got nothing to do with it.

1278
01:11:58,521 --> 01:12:01,012
-That naked guy's my teacher!
-What?

1279
01:12:01,124 --> 01:12:02,682
-Yeah!
-He ain't your teacher!

1280
01:12:02,792 --> 01:12:06,023
Every day he's at the off-ramp.
I give him some change.

1281
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:07,960
What do you mean? Like a bum?

1282
01:12:08,064 --> 01:12:11,761
What are you taIking about?
He's not a bum! Less fortunate!

1283
01:12:13,369 --> 01:12:14,893
Yeah, or get out of the way.

1284
01:12:15,004 --> 01:12:16,164
How're you doing?

1285
01:12:16,272 --> 01:12:17,899
-Hey, how's it going, DriIIbit?
-Hey, DriIIbit.

1286
01:12:18,007 --> 01:12:19,668
So, Iisten,
you know the thing we taIked about?

1287
01:12:19,776 --> 01:12:20,936
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1288
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:22,270
-PIan's off.
-What?

1289
01:12:22,378 --> 01:12:25,142
-DriIIbit! DriIIbit.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1290
01:12:25,482 --> 01:12:26,710
What do you mean the pIan's off?

1291
01:12:26,816 --> 01:12:29,546
It's not off. I just mean Iet's...
Let's postpone it.

1292
01:12:29,652 --> 01:12:31,244
'Cause I don't think we need
to get their beIongings now.

1293
01:12:31,354 --> 01:12:33,379
These kids,
they kind of Iook at me Iike I'm a hero,

1294
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:35,048
and, I don't know,
Iet's run with that for a IittIe bit.

1295
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:36,352
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1296
01:12:36,526 --> 01:12:38,653
You're reaIIy getting into this whoIe
teacher thing here, huh?

1297
01:12:38,761 --> 01:12:40,592
With the sweaters and the Ioafers.

1298
01:12:40,697 --> 01:12:43,564
-They're wingtips.
-You Iook Iike you teach Fagonometry.

1299
01:12:43,666 --> 01:12:45,725
What the heII is this? Who are you?

1300
01:12:45,835 --> 01:12:49,601
I got an oId saying for you, DriIIbit,
''You can't poIish a turd.''

1301
01:12:49,706 --> 01:12:51,867
Hey, Don, first of aII,
that's not an oId saying.

1302
01:12:51,975 --> 01:12:53,033
You stoIe that from me.

1303
01:12:53,142 --> 01:12:55,610
I say it aII the time.
SecondIy, I'm insuIted.

1304
01:12:55,712 --> 01:12:58,272
WeII, you shouId be. DriIIbit, I know you.

1305
01:12:58,548 --> 01:13:00,778
And the reaI you
wouId do this deaI, man.

1306
01:13:00,884 --> 01:13:04,615
There's a Iot of heads that want to feed
off of this, man. Don't Iet us down.

1307
01:13:04,721 --> 01:13:06,211
No! No, that's just it.

1308
01:13:06,322 --> 01:13:08,347
For the first time,
I'm not Ietting everybody down.

1309
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:11,086
-And now you're not making any sense!
-Yeah.

1310
01:13:11,194 --> 01:13:15,290
That guy's a fraud!
He's a bum in a Mister Rogers sweater!

1311
01:13:19,402 --> 01:13:21,233
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Okay, check it out, check it out.

1312
01:13:21,337 --> 01:13:22,429
I just saw the new substitute...

1313
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:24,507
DeIta-four-niner,
this is Yu-Gi-Oh-seven.

1314
01:13:24,607 --> 01:13:26,302
On the highway to the danger zone.

1315
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:28,070
Repeat, on the highway, over.

1316
01:13:28,177 --> 01:13:30,042
Oh, shitbaIIs!

1317
01:13:30,146 --> 01:13:32,341
Yu-Gi-Oh-four-seven,
you are not cIear to cross.

1318
01:13:32,448 --> 01:13:34,541
Repeat, you got a bogie northbound.

1319
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:36,050
-Oh, crap.
-Guys, hoId your position.

1320
01:13:36,185 --> 01:13:37,174
I'm en route.

1321
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,948
Guys, hoId your position!

1322
01:13:40,757 --> 01:13:42,418
Come here, you IittIe rat turds!

1323
01:13:42,525 --> 01:13:44,083
No! Come on!

1324
01:13:44,193 --> 01:13:45,558
Yo, so what'd you do, huh?

1325
01:13:45,662 --> 01:13:47,994
What, did you give the substitute
teacher some spare change

1326
01:13:48,097 --> 01:13:50,088
-so he'd give us a hard time?
-Get them!

1327
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:51,461
Mister FiIkins?

1328
01:13:51,568 --> 01:13:53,160
Excuse me. I need you to get to cIass.

1329
01:13:53,269 --> 01:13:55,567
And you three,
I want you out of here, too!

1330
01:13:55,672 --> 01:13:57,003
-Go on!
-Hey.

1331
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:59,108
Get out of my face, you bum!

1332
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:01,870
Maybe I wiII
if you stop hassIing these kids.

1333
01:14:01,978 --> 01:14:03,377
But untiI you're ready to do that,

1334
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:05,709
I'm gonna give you
some detentions to think about it.

1335
01:14:05,815 --> 01:14:07,908
PIease, just don't,
don't give me detention.

1336
01:14:08,017 --> 01:14:10,884
Yeah. That's my power,
and I wiII exercise it.

1337
01:14:10,987 --> 01:14:13,148
And then what? Huh? You gonna make
us shower on the beach

1338
01:14:13,256 --> 01:14:14,723
with you and the rest of the bums?

1339
01:14:14,824 --> 01:14:17,019
-Yeah, we're on to you, buddy.
-What's that supposed to mean?

1340
01:14:17,126 --> 01:14:20,960
What a freak. You got some
weird IittIe fantasies there, kid.

1341
01:14:21,064 --> 01:14:23,828
Okay, here's the deaI.
Let me make it reaI simpIe.

1342
01:14:23,933 --> 01:14:25,798
I'm a facuIty...

1343
01:14:26,936 --> 01:14:28,733
Punk-ass!

1344
01:14:29,138 --> 01:14:32,164
-He got me right in the ear!
-Run! Run!

1345
01:14:32,275 --> 01:14:34,937
-Yeah! Run! Save yourseIf!
-Run!

1346
01:14:35,078 --> 01:14:36,045
Medic!

1347
01:14:37,113 --> 01:14:38,603
Medic!

1348
01:14:38,982 --> 01:14:40,950
I got hit right in the nose!

1349
01:14:41,084 --> 01:14:43,143
FoIIowed up by a shot to the ear!

1350
01:14:43,953 --> 01:14:46,353
Oh, man. Okay.

1351
01:14:49,525 --> 01:14:51,356
Oh, that doesn't work at aII.

1352
01:14:52,729 --> 01:14:55,698
-This whoIe time he's a bum!
-Hey! Hey, you guys, hoId it! Wait up!

1353
01:14:55,798 --> 01:14:58,665
-Guys, Iet me expIain!
-ExpIain what, huh?

1354
01:14:59,802 --> 01:15:01,963
FiIkins is just gonna come after us
harder than ever!

1355
01:15:02,071 --> 01:15:03,129
What was that about showering
on the beach?

1356
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:04,206
You guys, hoId it.

1357
01:15:04,307 --> 01:15:05,365
Why wouId you shower on the beach?

1358
01:15:05,475 --> 01:15:06,464
Why don't we aII just shower
on the beach?

1359
01:15:06,576 --> 01:15:07,668
It's part of my morning fitness regimen!

1360
01:15:07,777 --> 01:15:09,802
I jog on the beach five miIes,
then I swim ten miIes.

1361
01:15:09,912 --> 01:15:12,176
That's what I do to stay in shape.
Then I shower.

1362
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:13,942
So, why didn't you defend yourseIf?

1363
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:16,484
'Cause I got sucker punched!
Look at this!

1364
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:19,821
Then I got hit in the ear,

1365
01:15:19,922 --> 01:15:23,255
which you probabIy can't even see,
'cause it's so deep in the ear canaI.

1366
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:24,326
I didn't reaIIy get hurt,

1367
01:15:24,427 --> 01:15:27,487
but I just kind of went down
to give you guys a chance to get away.

1368
01:15:27,597 --> 01:15:29,121
We paid you to beat him up!

1369
01:15:29,232 --> 01:15:32,360
How am I gonna beat him up
with aII these kids around?

1370
01:15:32,468 --> 01:15:35,437
Okay, then the principaI comes
and maybe some cops.

1371
01:15:35,538 --> 01:15:37,597
They'II find out I'm not a reaI teacher.

1372
01:15:37,707 --> 01:15:40,141
What good am I
if I'm sitting there in jaiI?

1373
01:15:40,243 --> 01:15:43,007
Look, I took a buIIet for you guys today.

1374
01:15:43,212 --> 01:15:44,873
You guys got off scot-free!

1375
01:15:44,981 --> 01:15:46,710
-Did you get hurt?
-No.

1376
01:15:46,816 --> 01:15:48,545
-Did you get hurt?
-No.

1377
01:15:49,018 --> 01:15:51,816
I'm Iike one of those guys
jumping in front of the President.

1378
01:15:51,921 --> 01:15:54,685
And, Iook, I'm not expecting a thank you.
That's my job.

1379
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:56,452
But maybe give me a bonus
or something.

1380
01:15:56,559 --> 01:15:59,528
SIy used to throw in a car
every now and then.

1381
01:16:02,231 --> 01:16:04,096
I'm so sorry, DriIIbit.

1382
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:09,561
What am I gonna do with you guys?

1383
01:16:10,973 --> 01:16:12,702
You want some cereaI?

1384
01:16:12,809 --> 01:16:15,403
-You got any Cap'n Crunch?
-Yeah.

1385
01:16:15,678 --> 01:16:16,702
Let's go.

1386
01:16:22,235 --> 01:16:23,668
-What the heII?
-No, don't, stop. Come on.

1387
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:25,260
-Put that stuff down!
-Hey, no way, man!

1388
01:16:25,371 --> 01:16:26,861
-DriIIbit, why you yeIIing?
-DriIIbit, back off, man!

1389
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:29,407
-You know these guys?
-No, I don't know these peopIe!

1390
01:16:29,509 --> 01:16:30,669
We're aImost done here, aII right?

1391
01:16:30,777 --> 01:16:32,972
-I am freaking out!
-My parents are gonna kiII me!

1392
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:34,478
-What the heII's going on?
-Everything's fine!

1393
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:35,808
-Screw this, man! I'm out of here!
-Wait a second!

1394
01:16:35,915 --> 01:16:37,007
-Why are you aII yeIIing?
-Don?

1395
01:16:37,116 --> 01:16:39,346
-Not Iike this! What are you doing?
-Take it easy!

1396
01:16:39,452 --> 01:16:41,545
-Just take it easy, man.
-This isn't the pIan.

1397
01:16:41,654 --> 01:16:43,679
-ReIax.
-AII the shit's gone in your house.

1398
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:45,052
You came to me as a man,
I came to you as a man.

1399
01:16:45,158 --> 01:16:46,648
AII the shit is gone in my house!

1400
01:16:46,759 --> 01:16:48,192
-Are you...
-Don't you touch me!

1401
01:16:48,294 --> 01:16:50,353
Don't make me BiIIy Jack your ass.

1402
01:16:52,331 --> 01:16:53,389
Watch out!

1403
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:06,171
That's how you BiIIy Jack
somebody's ass.

1404
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:07,405
Come on, Bernie, Iet's go!

1405
01:17:07,513 --> 01:17:09,344
Let's go!
Go on, get out of the way, man!

1406
01:17:09,449 --> 01:17:11,041
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1407
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:13,448
You'd better run! I saw your faces!

1408
01:17:13,553 --> 01:17:15,919
I got a photogenic memory!

1409
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:18,319
Get out of my house, you asshoIe!

1410
01:17:18,424 --> 01:17:21,120
What? There's another one?
I'II kiII the asshoIe!

1411
01:17:21,227 --> 01:17:24,287
No! You, asshoIe! Get out of my house,
now! Look at what you've done!

1412
01:17:24,397 --> 01:17:26,126
I didn't do anything!

1413
01:17:26,299 --> 01:17:28,267
I'm trying to heIp you guys! Look at me!

1414
01:17:28,367 --> 01:17:30,198
Wade, I think one of them peed
in your kitchen.

1415
01:17:30,303 --> 01:17:32,396
-Great!
-ShouId I caII the poIice?

1416
01:17:32,538 --> 01:17:34,631
No, don't caII the poIice! Just stop.

1417
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,605
DriIIbit, just teII us the truth.

1418
01:17:36,709 --> 01:17:40,042
You can't handIe the truth! I can't...
What do you want to hear?

1419
01:17:40,146 --> 01:17:42,114
That I was raised in an orphanage?

1420
01:17:42,215 --> 01:17:45,013
That I... That no one wanted me?
You don't want to hear that!

1421
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:47,086
'Cause that's a Iie, too!

1422
01:17:49,489 --> 01:17:52,856
Fine. Maybe I wasn't compIeteIy straight
with you guys about who I am.

1423
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:54,950
So you Iied about being in the miIitary?

1424
01:17:55,061 --> 01:17:58,497
No! That's true. I was trained
by the United States Army.

1425
01:17:58,598 --> 01:18:01,465
Then why couId a teenager beat you up
with so IittIe effort?

1426
01:18:01,567 --> 01:18:05,094
Because I don't Iike vioIence.
I wasn't cut out to be a soIdier.

1427
01:18:05,404 --> 01:18:07,872
-Boo-hoo.
-I Iike the parts with the repeIIing

1428
01:18:07,974 --> 01:18:11,410
and the crawIing through the mud
and the swinging on the monkey bars

1429
01:18:11,511 --> 01:18:15,106
and the heIping the wounded,
but I don't Iike confrontation.

1430
01:18:15,214 --> 01:18:18,741
Even this, with you three ganging up
on me, is not... I don't...

1431
01:18:19,285 --> 01:18:21,412
-It's reaIIy... I'm sorry.
-Shit!

1432
01:18:21,687 --> 01:18:25,123
You were in the miIitary, huh?
TeII me where you served.

1433
01:18:25,324 --> 01:18:29,488
My company was in the MiddIe East,
and I was there for Iike haIf a day.

1434
01:18:29,595 --> 01:18:34,328
I saw some cameIs and heard some,

1435
01:18:34,967 --> 01:18:37,834
I think, were some expIosions,
I don't know.

1436
01:18:38,337 --> 01:18:42,433
And it was...
It was so hot over there. It was...

1437
01:18:43,309 --> 01:18:46,642
I just cIimbed in the wheeI weII of a
cargo pIane, and I fIew back to the U.S.

1438
01:18:46,746 --> 01:18:49,146
I went AWOL. It was...

1439
01:18:49,248 --> 01:18:51,341
Is your name even DriIIbit?

1440
01:18:51,684 --> 01:18:52,844
Is my...

1441
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,979
What? How can you ask me that?

1442
01:18:56,289 --> 01:18:57,415
Is it?

1443
01:18:58,591 --> 01:19:02,687
No, it's... It's AIamo TayIor.

1444
01:19:06,299 --> 01:19:08,164
No. That's a Iie, too.

1445
01:19:09,435 --> 01:19:12,700
There I go, trying to impress
a bunch of kids again.

1446
01:19:14,407 --> 01:19:16,398
When are you gonna grow up?

1447
01:19:16,509 --> 01:19:18,841
My reaI name is Bob TayIor.

1448
01:19:19,312 --> 01:19:21,405
Not Robert, just Bob.

1449
01:19:22,715 --> 01:19:25,843
There, you satisfied?
And I didn't kiII anyone with a driII bit.

1450
01:19:25,952 --> 01:19:27,715
AIthough when I was in high schooI,

1451
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:30,311
I did puncture my pinky with a driII bit.

1452
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:33,559
And everyone started caIIing me DriIIbit,
making fun of me.

1453
01:19:33,659 --> 01:19:35,490
-Okay? And you can see the scar...
-No, get away.

1454
01:19:35,595 --> 01:19:37,256
...if you Iook cIoseIy right there.
Can you see?

1455
01:19:37,363 --> 01:19:41,094
Look, Ryan, Iook, you can see it.
It's reaI. Look.

1456
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,292
Can you see it in the Iight?

1457
01:19:42,401 --> 01:19:47,202
So you were just using us to take
our money and everything in my house?

1458
01:19:54,814 --> 01:19:57,180
That's kind of an oversimpIification.

1459
01:19:58,751 --> 01:20:00,616
I thought you cared about us.

1460
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:03,586
I do. I just...

1461
01:20:04,857 --> 01:20:07,087
I thought you were my friend.

1462
01:20:08,294 --> 01:20:11,024
Get out, DriIIbit,
and don't ever come back.

1463
01:20:16,502 --> 01:20:17,764
Leave!

1464
01:20:19,872 --> 01:20:21,169
I'm sorry.

1465
01:20:29,415 --> 01:20:30,382
HeIIo?

1466
01:20:30,483 --> 01:20:31,711
Hey. <i>Y</i>eah, look, l know...

1467
01:20:31,817 --> 01:20:33,512
l'm sorry, l know
l was supposed to meet you,

1468
01:20:33,619 --> 01:20:36,315
but l'm just having a real terrible day.

1469
01:20:36,455 --> 01:20:37,922
Where are you?

1470
01:20:38,557 --> 01:20:42,493
Remember you said you had
that reaI seIf-destructive pattern

1471
01:20:42,595 --> 01:20:47,623
of aIways going out with guys
that were just reaI Iosers, just dirtbags?

1472
01:20:47,733 --> 01:20:49,701
Total Zeros.

1473
01:20:49,802 --> 01:20:51,531
-Yes.
-WeII.

1474
01:20:51,637 --> 01:20:54,299
You might not be
out of the woods yet with that.

1475
01:20:54,507 --> 01:20:59,706
No, you said you were a doctor.
You're a doctor. You're not a doctor?

1476
01:20:59,812 --> 01:21:01,279
No, I'm not a doctor.

1477
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:04,907
I'm a homeIess U.S. Army deserter.
I was...

1478
01:21:05,017 --> 01:21:08,009
I'm not a teacher, but I'm at the schooI.
I'm trying to protect these kids.

1479
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,884
What? What did you say
about homeIess?

1480
01:21:11,757 --> 01:21:16,023
Like, metaphoricaIIy speaking
or in a box?

1481
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:21,291
You got to Iet it out.

1482
01:21:21,634 --> 01:21:25,593
You got to just Iet it out. Just...

1483
01:21:31,243 --> 01:21:32,574
That's not it.

1484
01:21:32,745 --> 01:21:36,408
Drillbit? l mean, Bob. lt's us, the guys.

1485
01:21:37,016 --> 01:21:40,076
-Pick up, Bob.
-<i>Y</i>eah, pick up, Drillbit.

1486
01:21:40,953 --> 01:21:41,942
Boys?

1487
01:21:42,054 --> 01:21:44,522
We just called to say
we're calling the cops on you,

1488
01:21:44,623 --> 01:21:48,354
and we hope you spend the rest
of your pathetic life in prison!

1489
01:21:48,461 --> 01:21:52,158
Now l see why people call you Drillbit.
Because you screw people!

1490
01:21:52,298 --> 01:21:55,165
<i>Y</i>ou're a jackass and a dirtbag.

1491

And l want my bar mitZvah money back.

1492
01:21:58,003 --> 01:22:01,234
Oh, yeah,

1493
01:22:07,546 --> 01:22:09,741
I teII you what,

1494
01:22:09,849 --> 01:22:11,146
1 ,500? Come on, man.

1495
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,309
This stuff hoIds

1496
01:22:13,419 --> 01:22:16,047
-To who?
-To the peopIe I stoIe it from.

1497
01:22:16,155 --> 01:22:17,520
I don't care about them. 1 ,500.

1498
01:22:17,623 --> 01:22:20,091
AII right. DeaI. What do I do?

1499
01:22:20,192 --> 01:22:22,319
-Yeah, back it right up.
-AII right.

1500
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:28,230
How're you doing, Don?

1501
01:22:30,903 --> 01:22:33,963
You got a reaI stupid Iaugh,
you know that, Don?

1502
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:37,072
How about you go ahead
and hop on out of that van here,

1503
01:22:37,176 --> 01:22:38,905
so I can kick your ass again?

1504
01:22:39,011 --> 01:22:41,741
Sorry, but this hauI's getting
returned to sender.

1505
01:22:41,847 --> 01:22:43,439
-Oh, reaIIy?
-Yeah, it is, Don.

1506
01:22:43,549 --> 01:22:44,880
And I'II teII you another thing
that's gonna happen.

1507
01:22:44,984 --> 01:22:46,645
This Ieft foot is gonna go

1508
01:22:46,752 --> 01:22:48,151
-of your face!
-Oh, give me a break, DriIIbit.

1509
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:51,917
I know you and the DriIIbit I know
isn't capabIe of reaIIy doing it!

1510
01:22:56,295 --> 01:22:57,262
Hoo-rah!

1511
01:22:58,764 --> 01:23:01,756
I'm giving you one more chance
to save this friendship!

1512
01:23:05,204 --> 01:23:07,798
Damn it! You ready for this, Don?

1513
01:23:09,175 --> 01:23:11,905
-No!
-Yeah!

1514
01:23:16,782 --> 01:23:19,683
PoIish that turd, Don!

1515
01:23:23,389 --> 01:23:24,947
I'm dead.

1516
01:23:25,057 --> 01:23:27,082
-You're dead.
-I'm sad.

1517
01:23:30,362 --> 01:23:32,557
Wade, what's wrong?
Is everything okay?

1518
01:23:32,665 --> 01:23:34,929
Yeah, but you're not gonna
wanna go home.

1519
01:23:35,034 --> 01:23:38,629
-Oh, no, no, no. The cabIe go out?
-If it is, you're dead.

1520
01:23:39,972 --> 01:23:40,939
Of course it was your fauIt!

1521
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,564
You were home!
You shouId have stopped them!

1522
01:23:42,675 --> 01:23:45,439
Bear with me.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

1523
01:23:45,544 --> 01:23:46,738
Oh, God.

1524
01:23:47,146 --> 01:23:49,137
PIease don't scream.

1525
01:23:50,916 --> 01:23:52,383
What the heII?
I thought we were robbed!

1526
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:53,782
We were!

1527
01:23:53,886 --> 01:23:56,446
We didn't get robbed!
We got rearranged!

1528
01:23:57,022 --> 01:23:59,047
You and your weirdo friends
have a marijuana party?

1529
01:23:59,158 --> 01:24:00,648
-No!
-Oh, honey.

1530
01:24:00,759 --> 01:24:03,125
-Punish him, Dad.
-Yeah, don't Iet him get away with this.

1531
01:24:03,229 --> 01:24:06,027
-Are you smoking pot?
-No. I'm reaIIy confused.

1532
01:24:06,131 --> 01:24:08,827
No, no, Wade.
DriIIbit must have done it.

1533
01:24:09,435 --> 01:24:10,697
Who's DriIIbit?

1534
01:24:11,203 --> 01:24:13,000
You teII me what's going on now, Wade.

1535
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:15,838
I just... I think it's weird, you know,

1536
01:24:15,941 --> 01:24:19,604
that this is what I get for trying to make
them feeI Iike a part of the group.

1537
01:24:19,712 --> 01:24:24,411
I mean, I saw it Iike a schooI tradition.
It's hazing, yeah, but

1538
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:26,610
just to, you know, make them
feeI Iike they beIonged.

1539
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:30,450
Sort of Iike a fun initiation.

1540
01:24:30,556 --> 01:24:32,581
I mean, didn't you aII have that
when you were kids?

1541
01:24:32,691 --> 01:24:36,752
Yeah. I remember my first few days.
Got tied to the fIagpoIe,

1542
01:24:36,862 --> 01:24:39,592
egged a few times.
At the end of it, it's aII Iaughs.

1543
01:24:39,698 --> 01:24:42,258
Yeah, Wade, boys, you reaIIy
shouIdn't have panicked Iike that.

1544
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,926
Yeah, this boy's not dangerous,

1545
01:24:44,036 --> 01:24:46,698
not compared to a dirty,
homeIess ex-soIdier.

1546
01:24:46,805 --> 01:24:50,332
The more I think about it,
that guy, he couId've reaIIy hurt me.

1547
01:24:50,442 --> 01:24:54,674
AII right. I'm... I'm sorry, but your boys
brought a fugitive onto schooI property

1548
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:56,839
threatening the safety of my students.

1549
01:24:56,949 --> 01:24:59,110
Now, I don't... I don't wanna point
any fingers here,

1550
01:24:59,218 --> 01:25:01,914
but I think we aII know who's to bIame.

1551
01:25:02,888 --> 01:25:03,789
You put my Iife in danger, guys.

1552
01:25:03,829 --> 01:25:05,188
You put my Iife in danger, guys.

1553
01:25:05,624 --> 01:25:08,752
It's worse than any hazing
that anybody couId do.

1554
01:25:08,861 --> 01:25:10,726
I'm just Iucky I was abIe
to defend myseIf.

1555
01:25:10,829 --> 01:25:12,296
Who knows what might have happened?

1556
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:15,162
This guy's a veteran!
How many peopIe might he have kiIIed?

1557
01:25:15,267 --> 01:25:17,098
Did anybody see ''To Catch a Predator''
on Dateline?

1558
01:25:17,202 --> 01:25:18,794
-I watched that!
-I saw that, yeah.

1559
01:25:18,904 --> 01:25:20,997
It's where they set the booby trap
for the pedophiIes.

1560
01:25:21,106 --> 01:25:22,869
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-A grandfather, a priest...

1561
01:25:22,975 --> 01:25:24,909
I mean, couId you imagine it?
You think you're on a date,

1562
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:26,568
and then aII of a sudden,
poIice are everywhere.

1563
01:25:26,679 --> 01:25:28,237
-Yeah.
-My God, this guy knows where we Iive.

1564
01:25:28,347 --> 01:25:29,314
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1565
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:33,784
I think you'II be gIad to know I gave
security camera footage of this DriIIbit

1566
01:25:33,886 --> 01:25:36,616
to the poIice and they said
they'd be watching for him.

1567
01:25:36,722 --> 01:25:38,883
No, what the heII's the matter
with you guys?

1568
01:25:38,991 --> 01:25:41,425
Are you mentaIIy defective
or something?

1569
01:25:41,527 --> 01:25:43,654
You got to understand,
DriIIbit was around because

1570
01:25:43,762 --> 01:25:45,627
this psychopath over here
was gonna murder us!

1571
01:25:45,731 --> 01:25:48,029
I mean, FiIkins is the reaI criminaI!

1572
01:25:48,133 --> 01:25:49,430
Yes! He has a samurai sword

1573
01:25:49,535 --> 01:25:51,196
-he has used on his other victims!
-AII right...

1574
01:25:56,241 --> 01:25:57,333
Sit down!

1575
01:25:59,011 --> 01:26:00,569
Sit down!

1576
01:26:01,146 --> 01:26:02,443
Thank you very much.

1577
01:26:02,548 --> 01:26:03,742
Now, Terry.

1578
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:06,948
Is there any truth to this?

1579
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,811
Oh, yeah. AII of it.

1580
01:26:11,256 --> 01:26:15,454
I'm reaIIy a samurai warrior from
the 1 4th century sent to kiII them.

1581
01:26:19,598 --> 01:26:21,031
He's cute.

1582
01:26:21,133 --> 01:26:24,000
Okay, I hope I speak for everyone here

1583
01:26:24,103 --> 01:26:27,504
in saying that I feeI
this issue is resoIved.

1584
01:26:27,606 --> 01:26:28,595
-Thank you. Okay, okay.
-AII right?

1585
01:26:28,707 --> 01:26:30,299
Very good.
Thank you for coming in, foIks.

1586
01:26:30,409 --> 01:26:32,309
-Thank you.
-AII right, yeah.

1587
01:26:32,411 --> 01:26:34,470
-Hey, wasn't that fun?
-HeII, yeah.

1588
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:35,945
-Oh, my goodness!
-Great.

1589
01:26:36,048 --> 01:26:37,015
-You feeI better now, honey?
-Terry, honey.

1590
01:26:37,116 --> 01:26:38,549
I did not know you were aII aIone.

1591
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:40,744
We want to have you over to the house
for dinner, okay?

1592
01:26:40,853 --> 01:26:44,289
-That wouId be wonderfuI!
-Wade couId use more friends.

1593
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:52,959
Give me one, pIease.

1594
01:26:56,735 --> 01:27:00,193
You're kind of a born Ioser. It's funny.

1595
01:27:00,906 --> 01:27:02,396
It's not funny.

1596
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:04,267
It's funny to me.

1597
01:27:04,677 --> 01:27:07,475
Come on, don't jinx me. Don't jinx me.

1598
01:27:09,348 --> 01:27:12,374
500! Yes! Yes! I did it!

1599
01:27:12,484 --> 01:27:13,883
-I got it, man!
-Dude!

1600
01:27:13,986 --> 01:27:15,248
Look at that! Yes!

1601
01:27:15,354 --> 01:27:16,548
You got a ticket to Canada!

1602
01:27:16,655 --> 01:27:18,885
You better beIieve it! Come on, man!

1603
01:27:18,991 --> 01:27:21,221
FinaIIy! FinaIIy, I get one!

1604
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,727
Come here, you!
This candy's on me! Put it down!

1605
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:28,659
You got it! WeII, maybe just get
one of them. Here. Here you go!

1606
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,907
Okay, keep your eyes peeIed.

1607
01:27:46,985 --> 01:27:49,783
-Do you see FiIkins?
-No, but I see Brooke.

1608
01:27:50,255 --> 01:27:52,849
Gonna go for it. I'm gonna ask her out.

1609
01:27:53,659 --> 01:27:54,887
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

1610
01:27:55,294 --> 01:27:58,058
-You waited aII this time. Why now?
-Why not?

1611
01:27:58,497 --> 01:28:00,931
My Iife sucks so badIy,
even if she says no,

1612
01:28:01,033 --> 01:28:03,092
it's not Iike I'II have very far to faII.

1613
01:28:08,373 --> 01:28:09,567
I don't know.

1614
01:28:10,943 --> 01:28:13,571
-Hi.
-Hi.

1615
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:16,079
Look, I don't know how to do this.

1616
01:28:16,715 --> 01:28:19,912
In fact, I've been wanting to do this
for a whiIe. I just didn't know

1617
01:28:20,018 --> 01:28:21,610
when wouId be a good time. I don't...

1618
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:25,918
I didn't know if it wouId ever be
a good time. I mean, if I'd ever think...

1619
01:28:29,261 --> 01:28:30,888
It's okay, Brooke.

1620
01:28:33,232 --> 01:28:36,463
Yo, bro, I swear to God
those ain't my sodas,

1621
01:28:36,568 --> 01:28:39,469
but if you wanted to, say, hire me
or something, Iike a bodyguard,

1622
01:28:39,571 --> 01:28:43,667
I think maybe I couId dedicate my Iife
to finding the reaI cuIprit.

1623
01:28:46,211 --> 01:28:49,078
Wade, come on.
I'm okay with this, so Iet's just go.

1624
01:28:49,181 --> 01:28:51,081
What'd you say, ho?

1625
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:53,008
Okay, you know what?
What is your probIem?

1626
01:28:53,118 --> 01:28:55,109
Why don't you just Ieave them aIone?

1627
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:58,018
What are you gonna do, bro?
What are you gonna do?

1628
01:28:59,925 --> 01:29:03,793
You aren't gonna do anything,
because you don't have any baIIs.

1629
01:29:04,997 --> 01:29:07,329
-Leave him aIone!
-It's just not in you.

1630
01:29:12,538 --> 01:29:14,768
You see? Look at that.

1631
01:29:15,741 --> 01:29:17,038
SackIess!

1632
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:25,409
Why do you even waste my time?
You're pathetic.

1633
01:29:30,989 --> 01:29:32,718
You aII right, Wade?

1634
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:35,116
-Don't worry about that guy.
-He's just insecure inside.

1635
01:29:35,227 --> 01:29:37,593
-Get up. Let's get out of here.
-Wade?

1636
01:29:37,696 --> 01:29:39,186
Where are you going?

1637
01:29:39,298 --> 01:29:41,732
-T-Dog! Stop him!
-Fight! Fight!

1638
01:29:44,536 --> 01:29:45,525
Come on, Wade!

1639
01:29:45,637 --> 01:29:48,003
I'II kick the crap out of you right now.
You know why?

1640
01:29:48,106 --> 01:29:51,132
HaIf because
everyone is sick of your garbage

1641
01:29:51,243 --> 01:29:53,768
and haIf because
of what you said to Brooke!

1642
01:29:55,547 --> 01:29:57,378
Do you think I'm dumb?

1643
01:29:58,317 --> 01:30:00,444
Trying to trick me
into getting myseIf in troubIe?

1644
01:30:00,552 --> 01:30:03,544
Fine. Then we'II beat your face in
somewhere eIse.

1645
01:30:03,655 --> 01:30:05,646
-Anywhere. Go ahead. You name it.
-Okay, good.

1646
01:30:05,757 --> 01:30:10,319
Everybody! Everybody! I'm gonna kick
their asses tonight at my house!

1647
01:30:10,729 --> 01:30:13,823
Everybody shouId come!
It's gonna be hiIarious!

1648
01:30:14,132 --> 01:30:15,895
UItimate Geek Fighting!

1649
01:30:16,235 --> 01:30:20,569
Once you step on my property,
you're freaking trespassing, brother,

1650
01:30:20,672 --> 01:30:22,435
and I can do anything I want.

1651
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:24,372
You're nothing but a pathetic wimp,

1652
01:30:24,476 --> 01:30:27,604
and everyone's gonna know
by the end of tonight, brother!

1653
01:30:27,713 --> 01:30:29,408
And I wiII see you there!

1654
01:30:36,788 --> 01:30:38,517
What have I just done?

1655
01:30:38,857 --> 01:30:40,722
That was awesome, man.

1656
01:30:40,993 --> 01:30:44,520
-Me and Emmit are gonna back you up.
-Oh, now it's ''me and Emmit.''

1657
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:47,326
You've never been nice to me, Ryan,
and I've onIy been kind to you.

1658
01:30:47,432 --> 01:30:49,662
And I've tried so hard
to make this friendship work,

1659
01:30:49,768 --> 01:30:53,135
but I am not going to die
for someone who won't die for me!

1660
01:30:53,238 --> 01:30:56,867
''SurvivaI technique.''
I renounce vioIence.

1661
01:30:57,342 --> 01:30:59,469
I have a future!

1662
01:31:00,612 --> 01:31:02,307
What do we do next?

1663
01:31:03,215 --> 01:31:05,775
Guess we'd better Iearn how to fight.

1664
01:31:07,352 --> 01:31:09,377
-Jump Ieft, jump Ieft.
-Come on, BIue.

1665
01:31:09,488 --> 01:31:10,819
-That's what I'm taIking about!
-No, no, no, no.

1666
01:31:10,923 --> 01:31:12,481
-That's what I'm taIking about!
-Come on!

1667
01:31:12,591 --> 01:31:13,785
Come on! Yes!

1668
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:16,190
This PowerBar's reaIIy working.

1669
01:31:16,295 --> 01:31:17,853
I feeI stronger.

1670
01:31:18,730 --> 01:31:20,061
I feeI fatter.

1671
01:31:20,165 --> 01:31:21,962
Well, what do you want me to do?
<i>Y</i>ou just want me to hit you?

1672
01:31:22,067 --> 01:31:24,297
Come on. Do me this one favor.

1673
01:31:26,505 --> 01:31:28,097
That was perfect!

1674
01:31:29,574 --> 01:31:32,634
AII right. We need to Iearn
how to take a punch.

1675
01:31:32,978 --> 01:31:35,037
You ready? Let me go first.

1676
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:37,473
-AII right?
-Okay.

1677
01:31:50,762 --> 01:31:52,627
BIock out the pain.

1678
01:31:52,731 --> 01:31:55,325
Remember what that douche bag
DriIIbit taught us?

1679
01:31:55,434 --> 01:31:57,834
-Mind over pain!
-Okay.

1680
01:31:57,936 --> 01:32:00,734
AII right. Hit me in the chest.

1681
01:32:03,475 --> 01:32:04,442
Jeez!

1682
01:32:06,278 --> 01:32:08,109
-Your knuckIes are aII bone!
-AII right.

1683
01:32:08,213 --> 01:32:10,113
We get to caII how hard
the other guy hits.

1684
01:32:10,215 --> 01:32:13,810
AII right. Ten being the hardest,
how hard do you want it?

1685
01:32:13,919 --> 01:32:16,547
Five. In the back. In the back.

1686
01:32:21,159 --> 01:32:22,319
Oh, God!

1687
01:32:22,427 --> 01:32:26,090
Wonder what it feeIs Iike getting hit
in the middIe of the forehead.

1688
01:32:28,867 --> 01:32:29,834
Jeez!

1689
01:32:31,703 --> 01:32:33,466
-AII right, new ruIes!
-Okay.

1690
01:32:33,572 --> 01:32:34,834
I'm not gonna teII you
where I'm gonna hit you.

1691
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:36,032
-No, I don't Iike that ruIe.
-No, it's good.

1692
01:32:36,141 --> 01:32:38,006
-No, it's not good.
-It's good. It simuIates a reaI fight.

1693
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:40,203
-Trust me.
-AII right, fine.

1694
01:32:44,516 --> 01:32:45,813
I can't see this coming.

1695
01:32:45,917 --> 01:32:47,578
There's no way Wade can hurt me.

1696
01:32:50,122 --> 01:32:51,180
Not baIIs!

1697
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:53,848
You hit me in the nuts!

1698
01:32:55,861 --> 01:32:58,989
Dear Mom, if you're reading this,

1699
01:32:59,831 --> 01:33:02,231
it's very possible that l'm dead.

1700
01:33:05,437 --> 01:33:09,498
lf l don't survive, you should definitely
sue Emmit's family.

1701
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:13,504
P.S. Sorry l let your silver platter
get stolen.

1702
01:33:13,712 --> 01:33:16,044
My raps and rhymes will become
more valuable now.

1703
01:33:16,148 --> 01:33:18,048
<i>Y</i>ou're free to sell them
to Ghostface Killah.

1704
01:33:23,221 --> 01:33:25,746
Remember the pIan.
Strike first and strike hard.

1705
01:33:25,857 --> 01:33:28,519
You go for the head. I'II go for the nuts.

1706
01:34:10,869 --> 01:34:13,736
It actuaIIy Iooks Iike a pretty cooI party.

1707
01:34:16,641 --> 01:34:17,972
Oh! Hey, guys.

1708
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:22,843
So, how does it feeI to know
that death is just a few moments away?

1709
01:34:23,482 --> 01:34:25,950
-Where's FiIkins?
-In the kitchen.

1710
01:34:28,887 --> 01:34:30,582
In case we don't make it,

1711
01:34:32,691 --> 01:34:35,057
-I don't want to have any regrets.
-Yeah.

1712
01:34:36,795 --> 01:34:37,853
Face!

1713
01:34:41,433 --> 01:34:43,594
I've aIready got the first hit
out of the way.

1714
01:34:43,702 --> 01:34:44,964

These are the Siamese queers

1718

They showed up!
They reaIIy are that dumb!

1719
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:13,697
I hate when he caIIs me that.

1720
01:35:13,798 --> 01:35:16,494
So we're gonna have a good time!
Because they...

1721
01:35:25,177 --> 01:35:26,235
It worked.

1722
01:35:27,612 --> 01:35:29,603
-It's over!
-That was easy.

1723
01:35:29,781 --> 01:35:31,874
-We did it, we did it!
-We did.

1724

And I'm in big troubIe!

1730

Catch me off guard?
You broke my stairs.

Yo, Jay, give me some murder music.

01:39:11,469 --> 01:39:17,135
Look. You're a young man. You got...
You got a crazy Iook in your eye.

1773
01:39:18,543 --> 01:39:20,636
And it's reaIIy freaking me out right now.

1774
01:39:24,983 --> 01:39:26,177
Nice punch.

1775
01:39:27,118 --> 01:39:30,519
I try to be reasonabIe,
but I got to teII you,

1776
01:39:30,755 --> 01:39:36,057
these boys hired me as their bodyguard
and I wiII protect them!

1777
01:39:40,598 --> 01:39:42,088
Want to hear something crazy?

1778
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:44,668
Deep inside you,
I know there's a good kid.

1779
01:39:47,372 --> 01:39:50,864
God damn it,
I'm sick of getting hit by this kid.

1780
01:39:51,075 --> 01:39:52,702
Come on, DriIIbit. Kick his ass.

1781
01:39:52,811 --> 01:39:56,713
-I can't! He's a minor!
-No, he's not. He's 18.

1782
01:39:57,715 --> 01:39:59,615
You're 18?

1783
01:40:05,690 --> 01:40:07,385
That's it.

1784
01:40:16,968 --> 01:40:17,935
DriIIbit!

1785
01:40:19,637 --> 01:40:20,899
How oId are you?

1786
01:40:21,005 --> 01:40:23,769
Okay! AII right, I'm 1 7. I'm a minor.

1787
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:24,967
-My mom drives me to schooI.
-Come on!

1788
01:40:25,076 --> 01:40:26,338
I swear to God!

1789
01:40:26,845 --> 01:40:28,142
That was awesome.

1790
01:40:28,246 --> 01:40:30,737
Man, DriIIbit, you're badass.

1791
01:40:31,382 --> 01:40:33,543
I don't think I couId do that again.

1792
01:40:33,818 --> 01:40:35,615
It's weird. I guess it's Iike

1793
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:38,712
when a mother
Iifts an automobiIe off a chiId.

1794
01:40:38,823 --> 01:40:40,484
-Yeah.
-You just get that burst of strength.

1795
01:40:40,592 --> 01:40:42,150
That's the onIy way I can expIain it.

1796
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:45,161
AdrenaIine. That's the word for it.

1797
01:40:45,263 --> 01:40:48,494
My hands are...
My hands are stiII shaking.

1798
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:52,001
-Thanks for coming back.
-You kidding me? I had to do it.

1799
01:40:52,103 --> 01:40:54,037
I'm not gonna go AWOL on you boys.

1800
01:40:54,138 --> 01:40:55,935
I made that mistake one...

1801
01:40:56,174 --> 01:40:59,940
Crap on a shit sandwich!
I'm out of here, boys! Adiós!

1802
01:41:00,812 --> 01:41:02,040
Bye, DriIIbit!

1803
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,338
Hey, fags!

1804
01:41:05,450 --> 01:41:07,145
This ain't over!

1805
01:41:18,129 --> 01:41:19,994
-He feeIs no pain.
-Whoa.

1806
01:41:23,835 --> 01:41:25,234
Was that my pinky?

1807
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,508
-Are you okay?
-My finger!

1808
01:41:31,609 --> 01:41:32,576
You okay?

1809
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:34,371
-I'm so sorry.
-Why did I catch a sword?

1810
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:35,946
-I Iost it. No, no.
-Let me see it. Let me see it.

1811
01:41:36,047 --> 01:41:39,483
-I Iost it.
-Let me see it. Let me see it.

1812
01:41:39,617 --> 01:41:41,414
No, it's okay. I'm bIocking the pain.

1813
01:41:41,519 --> 01:41:43,919
I can't bIock this pain.
Get some ice for me.

1814
01:41:44,022 --> 01:41:45,455
It's not bad. Here, heIp me find it

1815
01:41:45,557 --> 01:41:46,785
-before the ants get it.
-Where'd you Iast see it?

1816
01:41:46,891 --> 01:41:48,791
-Look in the grass.
-My dad, yo, just don't teII my dad!

1817
01:41:48,893 --> 01:41:50,053
HeIp me, guys!
Find it before a rat gets it!

1818
01:41:50,161 --> 01:41:51,389
See it? Look over there.

1819
01:41:51,496 --> 01:41:52,690
-Is that it?
-Where?

1820
01:41:52,797 --> 01:41:54,594
Hey, guys, I found it!

1821
01:41:56,734 --> 01:41:57,996
No!

1822
01:41:58,937 --> 01:42:00,063
We found it.

1823
01:42:01,806 --> 01:42:02,898
Get me some ice.

1824
01:42:03,007 --> 01:42:03,608
-Ice!
-Ice!

1825
01:42:03,648 --> 01:42:04,006
-Ice!
-Ice!

1826
01:42:04,108 --> 01:42:05,166
Margarita aII right?

1827
01:42:05,276 --> 01:42:07,005
Oh, my God.

1828
01:42:07,111 --> 01:42:08,169
Bro!

1829
01:42:08,279 --> 01:42:09,712
Come on, buddy.
We got to get you to a hospitaI.

1830
01:42:09,814 --> 01:42:12,146
-AII right, Iet's go.
-Let's go.

1831
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:13,979
It's gonna be okay.

1832
01:42:14,085 --> 01:42:17,384
CongratuIations, boys.
You just caught the great Bob TayIor.

1833
01:42:17,488 --> 01:42:19,615
Fantastic. No aIcohoI in the car, sir.

1834
01:42:19,724 --> 01:42:22,386
Oh, yeah.
WeII, Iet me get the finger out.

1835
01:42:25,563 --> 01:42:26,757
Hoo-rah.

1836
01:42:29,334 --> 01:42:31,564
-Yo, dudes, that was awesome!
-Thanks, man.

1837
01:42:31,669 --> 01:42:33,728
Man, you have no idea how Iong kids
have been waiting to do that.

1838
01:42:33,838 --> 01:42:35,328
-Thanks.
-Dude, this is gonna be bIogged,

1839
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:36,407
for sure!

1840
01:42:36,507 --> 01:42:39,203
I am so gIad
I did not go to my sister's birthday party!

1841
01:42:40,144 --> 01:42:41,133
Hey.

1842
01:42:41,245 --> 01:42:42,769
He was amazing.

1843
01:42:43,414 --> 01:42:45,177
You know,
Terry's just aIways been crazy.

1844
01:42:45,283 --> 01:42:47,342
You know, he's threatened me
with his sword aII the time.

1845
01:42:47,452 --> 01:42:49,249
I'm just tired of being scared, you know?

1846
01:42:49,354 --> 01:42:51,845
-Hey, are you okay?
-Yeah.

1847
01:42:54,792 --> 01:42:58,592
When the adrenaIine rush passes,
I'm gonna be in a Iot more pain.

1848
01:43:00,298 --> 01:43:03,165
I don't want you to think I'm the kind of
guy who tries to impress girIs

1849
01:43:03,267 --> 01:43:06,293
with vioIence,
but that was kind of for you.

1850
01:43:07,972 --> 01:43:10,600
That was very brave of you.

1851
01:43:20,752 --> 01:43:23,949
You know, Emmit,
I can't beIieve I'm saying this...

1852
01:43:25,456 --> 01:43:29,552
You, my friend, are one crazy
son of a bitch, you know that?

1853
01:43:29,661 --> 01:43:31,686
You have no idea how scared I was.

1854
01:43:31,796 --> 01:43:35,061
AII right. Now, Iet's go get
something to eat. I'm starving.

1855
01:43:38,936 --> 01:43:42,099
Dear Wade, Ryan and little, tiny Emmit.

1856
01:43:42,206 --> 01:43:44,606
Thanks for sending the Cap'n Crunch.

1857
01:43:44,776 --> 01:43:46,767
Suddenly, l'm very popular in here.

1858
01:43:46,878 --> 01:43:51,440
Hey, Bob. Give me some of that Cap'n
Crunch or I'II stab you in the shower.

1859
01:43:53,551 --> 01:43:54,745
Just kidding.

1860
01:43:57,255 --> 01:43:59,883
l was glad to read
in your last correspondence

1861
01:43:59,991 --> 01:44:03,427
that Filkins was shipped off
back to Hong Kong

1862
01:44:03,528 --> 01:44:07,157
to be with his parents for breaking
so many underage drinking laws.

1863
01:44:07,699 --> 01:44:11,135
Now maybe high school can be
what you want it to be

1864
01:44:11,235 --> 01:44:13,135
-instead of sucking rat nads.
-Oh, yeah.

1865
01:44:14,305 --> 01:44:15,397
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1866
01:44:16,074 --> 01:44:19,441
As for me, every time l look
at where my pinky used to be,

1867
01:44:19,677 --> 01:44:22,646
l think of you boys
and our battles together.

1868
01:44:23,081 --> 01:44:24,446
It's kind of cooI.

1869
01:44:24,882 --> 01:44:26,975
Luckily, they have
a work release program,

1870
01:44:27,085 --> 01:44:29,383
and they say l should
be able to land a job,

1871
01:44:29,487 --> 01:44:31,318
which excites me a great deal.

1872
01:44:31,422 --> 01:44:33,720
And speaking of exciting me
a great deal,

1873
01:44:33,825 --> 01:44:36,123
Miss Zachey and l
have been in contact.

1874
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:40,094
l don't know why women dig
guys in prison, but they really do.

1875
01:44:40,198 --> 01:44:44,100
On top of that, all l can say is,
l miss you guys

1876
01:44:44,202 --> 01:44:45,965
and will see you when l get out.

1877
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:49,904
Which, thanks to the currently lenient
nature of the United States Army

1878
01:44:50,007 --> 01:44:52,635
deserting laws is in two days from now,

1879
01:44:52,777 --> 01:44:56,008
officially satisfying
my three-week sentence.

1880
01:44:56,447 --> 01:44:58,642
-<i>Y</i>our brother, Bob Taylor.
-See you, DriIIbit.

1881
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:01,548
-AKA Drillbit.
-Later, bro.

1882
01:45:01,786 --> 01:45:04,846
AKA, Alamo Taylor.

1883
01:45:05,389 --> 01:45:07,755
l still like the sound of that.

1884
01:45:10,628 --> 01:45:12,425
There you are!

1885
01:45:13,564 --> 01:45:15,054
-DriIIbit!
-Come on.

1886
01:45:15,166 --> 01:45:16,463
-Oh, my God.
-There he is.

1887
01:45:16,567 --> 01:45:18,364
Come on, get in here!
Come here! FaII in!

1888
01:45:18,469 --> 01:45:20,767
-He's a free man!
-Give me a hug!

1889
01:45:20,905 --> 01:45:22,736
Give me a hug. Yeah.

1890
01:45:23,074 --> 01:45:25,508
WeII, that's gonna keep me smiIing
aII day, huh?

1891
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:27,100
Yeah, that's my buddy, DriIIbit.

1892
01:45:27,211 --> 01:45:28,769
He's a cooI guy.
We're in a fight right now.

1893
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:29,147
This has been the Iongest
three weeks of my Iife.

1894
01:45:29,187 --> 01:45:30,341
This has been the Iongest
three weeks of my Iife.

1895
01:45:30,448 --> 01:45:31,813
I missed you, too.

1896
01:45:32,517 --> 01:45:34,314
-FeeIs good.
-You gonna shake the jaiI?

1897
01:45:34,418 --> 01:45:36,318
-It wasn't that bad.
-Come on, Iet's go.

1898
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:39,116
You know, the guy in the next ceII taught
me some Spanish.

1899
01:45:39,223 --> 01:45:42,488
Did you know abierto means ''open''?

1900
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:38,126
HeIp! I'm bIeeding!

1901
01:49:39,397 --> 01:49:42,423
Come here, soIdier.
Let me take a Iook at that.

1902
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:44,834
Come here. Jump up there.

1903
01:49:42,935 --> 01:49:47,770
You got a IittIe bIoody nose.
TiIt your head back, 45-degree angIe.

1904
01:49:48,775 --> 01:49:51,300
-What happened?
-Somebody punched me.

1905
01:49:52,812 --> 01:49:58,307
TeII me his name. Names.
It'II never happen again.

1906
02:32:32,632 --> 01:16:20,125
-DriIIbit!
-What are you doing?
