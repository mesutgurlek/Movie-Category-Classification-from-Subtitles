00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,450
             Although...
             (LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)
             No, I'm kidding!

667
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,218
                I'm just...
                Oh, my God.

668
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,338
        Oh! I was...

669
00:35:58,339 --> 00:35:59,255
     I was trying to
     find my friend.

670
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:00,724
   I thought this was
   his room. And...

671
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:02,659
                  Oh, nope.

672
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,195
          Nope. Unless he's
          hiding under the bed!
          (LAUGHS)

673
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:06,696
 We think you're
 super-brilliant.

674
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:07,831
     We both read
     your book.
                     Oh!

675
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,568
             Yay for your book!

676
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:13,837
         Thank you.

677
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:18,275
    Are you ladies in
    customer services?

678
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:19,776
 Well, yes,
 as a matter of fact.
               Mmm-hmm. Uh-huh.

679
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,344
 We're both team leaders
 in a phone room.

680
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,812
              We read your book

681
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,749
       and productivity went up
       90% in our department.

682
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,785
               You're so smart.

683
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,620
     I'm not sure I should even
     say words in front of you,

684
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:31,922
             because you'll see
             how dumb I am.

685
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:33,423
               Shut up, Lisa.

686
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,759
  No, don't.
  Don't shut up, Lisa.

687
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,928
 You have a miraculous voice.

688
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,196
               Oh, God, no!

689
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:41,665
                 Yick. Me?

690
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:44,701
          Yick. No way. No way.

691
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,637
    Lisa, you're
    being nuts.

692
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,707
 Say, would you ladies like to
 get a drink at the bar, maybe?

693
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,842
     We could chat.

694
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:56,279
 Talk about
 phone system innovations.

695
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,249
                 Oh, um...

696
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,452
 Um, yeah! I think
 we could manage that.
 Right, Lisa?

697
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,654
           Do you need to find
           your friend, though?

698
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:06,556
            No.

699
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:11,494
 Two beautiful ladies
 trumps my friend.

700
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,864
 Oh, my goodness.
 Thank you so much!

701
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,366
  I'm blushing.

702
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,602
        Yes, thank you so much!

703
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,438
            I'm blushing, too.

704
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,674
      (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

705
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,943
        I can't believe
        we bumped into you.

706
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:28,745
      You know,
      we sprung for this hotel

707
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,880
       because this is like
       a mini-vacation for us.

708
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,482
      We can't even afford it.

709
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,351
      But look what happened!

710
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:35,518
          It's so worth it.

711
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:36,686
                 Oh.

712
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,789
         I love this song.

713
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:43,526
  <i> ♪ How I long to be near... ♪</i>

714
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,501
             Shut up, Lisa.

715
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:52,535
           I even got a massage
           tonight in the room!

716
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,437
                    Mmm.

717
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,573
 It's good to splurge
 every now and again.

718
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:59,576
         Emily and I work
         for Tessman in Akron.

719
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:00,844
       We're only
       customer service reps,

720
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,545
          so you can imagine
          our salaries.

721
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:05,582
            Tessman?
            Tessman Foods.

722
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,984
  We make packaged bakery items
  shipped all over the Midwest.

723
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,320
              Nibble-O's,

724
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:11,921
             Choco-bricks,

725
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,590
         Apple-Flats,
         Strawberry Trifles,

726
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:16,526
      Knick-Knacks, Scroochies?

727
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:18,828
 Oh, yes. Yes. Splendid.

728
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,363
       I'm familiar.

729
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:21,765
                 Brownie Balls,
                 don't forget.

730
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,367
       Brownie Balls.
       Yeah, they're new.

731
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,535
      WAITRESS: Hello again.
      What can I get you?

732
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,637
      Oh, hi.

733
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,640
 Uh, do you ladies
 know what you want?

734
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,909
               Um, I'll have
               an apple mojito,
               please.

735
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,577
           Can you make those
           with apple schnapps?

736
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:35,879
                Yum. Yum. Yum.

737
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,414
 I think probably.

738
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,382
        That sounds really,
        really good.

739
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:40,483
         I'll have the same.

740
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,618
 And for you, sir?

741
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,420
   Belvedere martini,

742
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,488
 dry, straight-up, twist.

743
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,623
 I'll be back
 in a minute.

744
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,760
       So, what do you
       ladies do for fun?

745
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:51,961
              Besides drinking?

746
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,664
       Emily, stop! God!
                      Hey!

747
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,700
       (CHUCKLES) Well,
       I like to drink.

748
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:59,502
    I do, too! But we do
    lots of other things.

749
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,604
   We hike and bike ride.
                      Yeah.

750
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,940
      I love to read.
      Go to the movies.

751
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,709
 I'm pretty good at Scrabble.

752
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:07,911
                   Strip poker.
        Um... Emily!

753
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,679
          (CHUCKLES)

754
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,648
      Have you two
      been friends long?

755
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,450
          Since junior high.

756
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:14,918
         Oh, I play the
         Jew's harp a little.

757
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:18,788
           I don't like to
           say "Jew's harp"

758
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,390
          because it's
          offensive to Jews.

759
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,892
         (CHUCKLES)

760
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:25,829
           Anyway, I bought
           one of those, um,
           self-teaching...

761
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,897
            Self-teaching?

762
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,532
            Is that right?

763
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,501
        Or is it self-learning?

764
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,503
  The Jew's harp
  is an underrated instrument.

765
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,438
               I know!

766
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,640
     People think of it as
     just this thing, you know?

767
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,676
          Mmm-hmm.

768
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,945
    Here we are, folks.
    Two apple mojitos.

769
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,913
                 Thank you.
              Mmm. Thanks.

770
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,548
     You're welcome. And one
     more Belvedere martini
     for the gentleman.

771
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,516
     Thanks.

772
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:49,018
       To us.

773
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,919
          (CLINKING)

774
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,556
 EMILY: Hurry, hurry.
 We're gonna miss the elevator.

775
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,924
 Go. Go, go, go!

776
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,093
                Emily, stop it.

777
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:59,462
                What floor
                are we, anyway?

778
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:00,830
     Ten.

779
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:02,565
                  Are you sure?
                  I think...

780
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,969
                  No, I want
                  to press it!
                  Darn it.

781
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:07,871
 Sorry.
 My hand just jumped.

782
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:09,472
                I love pressing
                the buttons.

783
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:11,107
 I'm sorry.

784
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,042
       You always get
       to press it, Lisa.
       Don't be greedy.

785
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,978
              I know.
              'Cause I love it.

786
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,846
                It's so...
                I don't know...

787
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,715
                Buttony. No,
                that's not it.

788
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,684
                Mmm, buttonish?

789
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:22,585
         (ALL LAUGHING)

790
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,855
           Is it stupid to like
           to press buttons?

791
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,658
                 Shut up, Lisa.

792
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,494
 Pressing buttons
 is good clean fun.

793
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,563
                Exactly! That's
                exactly right.

794
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,632
                    See, Em?

 It was nice getting

 so I'll say good night.

        in front of you, Emily.

 a sort of

            at me too much

885

           because, you know...

 I think you're lovely.

887
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:04,834
               No, you don't.

888
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:08,971
    I've always done phone work
    because I'd never get hired

889
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:11,307
          to work in a store
          or a restaurant or...

 May I kiss you there?

899

        You're not like
        a pervert or something?

900
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,973
        Like some weird version
        of a chubby chaser?

901
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,141
    No.

902
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:49,412
        I just don't understand
        why you would want to
        kiss me there.

903
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:52,849
         Because...

904
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:55,284
     Because I like you.

905
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:56,219
                   Oh.

906
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,221
                 Why?

907
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,158
              I mean, I'm not
              smart like Emily.
              And I'm ugly.

908
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:06,429
     You're a really smart guy.
     You should like Emily.

        a lot of the words

00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,366
               I sat there with
               a dictionary.

911
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,301
             I try to learn.
             But I'm never
             going to be smart.

912
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,437
                  And I'm ugly.

913
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,172
 I find it
 enormously charming

914
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,407
 that you read any book
 with a dictionary next to you.

917
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:52,175
          My last boyfriend
          was eight years ago.

918
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:53,409
           And he wasn't
           even my boyfriend.

919
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:55,111
       He was almost 60 and fat

920
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:58,181
          and he worked in
          Human Resources

921
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:00,349
         and he had a wife
         and his daughter
         was older than me.

922
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,253
         And the only reason
         he pursued me

923
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:05,988
        was because he thought
        he'd have a good shot.

924
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,089
             Which he did.

 a really long time now,

 such a great voice

 what people think about her.

      They're hard to maintain.

           sort of Irish faces.

01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,410
  Is there some problem?

01:04:44,248 --> 01:04:46,548
        No, sir.
        It's nothing like that.

           how to put this,
           so I'll just put it.

01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:26,187
       I understand
       that you had a guest
       in your room last night.

     Is that a crime?

  (CHUCKLES) No, not at all.

1212

 Certainly, hoteliers
 are in the business
 of being discreet

  about our guests'
  philandering.

1214

 No, it isn't that.
 My choice of words...

1216
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:42,070
 It's not about that at all.

01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:43,605
    How do you even
    know that, anyway?

1218

      Well, I...

1219
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:49,644
 Mr. Stone, may I be
 candid with you?

     you're getting at.

1222
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:55,183
     Well, I, um...

1223
01:05:55,986 --> 01:05:56,952
         Um...

1224
01:05:58,455 --> 01:05:59,487
      I love you.

1225
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:03,458
    Right, I'm leaving.

1226

        No, no. Look.
        I've never talked to
        you like this before.

01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,669
      Are you hungry?
      We could order breakfast.

1318
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:09,337
            I have to get ready
            for this speech.

1319
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,806
 Can I have scrambled eggs?

1320
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:13,675
                      Sure.

1321
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:16,911
      I love eggs. Scrambled is
      my favorite egg style.

1322
01:10:17,814 --> 01:10:18,680
          What about yours?

1323
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:23,251
         Mmm!

1324
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:25,753
 These eggs are delicious.

1325
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,922
 They're scrambled perfectly.
 Do you want to try some?

1326
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:30,258
             No. Now here's
             what I'm thinking.

1327
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,559
          Yes?

1328
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:32,627
         I want to be with you.

1329
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,463
  What do you mean?

1330
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:37,532
       I need to be with you.
       I want to leave my wife.

1331
01:10:39,002 --> 01:10:41,002
         Really?

1332
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:42,403
 Michael, that's a big
 decision. I don't...

1333
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:43,871
               No, no, no,

1334
01:10:43,873 --> 01:10:45,907
  it's something I have to do.
  I mean, if you're interested.

1335
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:50,511
 I mean, yeah. I mean,
 it's awfully sudden.

1336
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:52,880
  I mean, I don't want
  to be responsible

1337
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:54,849
  for breaking up a marriage.

1338
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:56,684
 Do we need to decide now?

1339
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:59,787
            It's been years
            since I've felt
            anything like this.

1340
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,422
        It's like
        a floodgate has opened.

1341
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,258
             I can't close it.
             I don't want to.
             I love you.

1342
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,795
       Okay. Um...

1343
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:10,765
 I don't know.
 It seems so big and...

1344
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:13,568
  Oh, gosh, okay.
  Yeah, let's do it.

1345
01:11:15,572 --> 01:11:18,473
       Great! This is so great!

1346
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:19,540
                 Anomalisa.
                 (CHUCKLES)

1347
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:23,711
           So, I'll call Donna
           and tell her.

1348
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:25,947
         No, maybe I should
         go and see her, right?

1349
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:29,350
    Yeah, that sounds right.

1350
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:30,418
      I think that's
      such an important...

1351
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,887
    (STAMMERS) Could you not...

1352
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:34,322
      You're clicking your fork
      against your teeth.

1353
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:35,356
        Could you not do that?

1354
01:11:35,358 --> 01:11:37,058
         Oh, sorry.

1355
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,593
     People have told
     me that before.

1356
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:40,628
  I know, it's a stupid
  unconscious habit.

1357
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,764
      It's okay.
      Anyway, you were saying?

1358
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:45,300
   Mmm. Just that I think
   it's more respectful.

1359
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:46,601
     And you need to
     speak to Henry

1360
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:48,403
   and explain that
   this isn't about him.

1361
01:11:48,405 --> 01:11:50,438
        But it is.
        It's about him, too.

1362
01:11:50,774 --> 01:11:52,774
              Oh.

1363
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:54,876
  Well, don't tell him that.
  He's just a little boy.

1364
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,878
         Yeah. You're right.

1365
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:02,317
        You're being
        a little controlling,
        don't you think?

1366
01:12:03,353 --> 01:12:04,419
  I don't mean to. I'm sorry.

1367
01:12:04,421 --> 01:12:05,687
         No, that's okay.

1368
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:07,689
     Good. I'm glad...
             (GRUNTS)

1369
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:10,658
         Please don't talk
         with food hanging
         out of your mouth.

1370
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,927
      Oh, sorry.
      I'm a pig. Sorry.
                            No.

1371
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:15,029
       No, no, no. It's okay.

1372
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:16,364
         So, will you live
         in Los Angeles,

1373
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:17,999
          or do you need
          to stay in Ohio?

1374
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:20,368
      Um... I'm sorry.
      Hold on.

1375
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:22,770
          (HUMMING)

1376
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:33,715
 I can move to Los Angeles.
 I could do that.

1377
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:34,816
              Good.

1378
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:38,119
 We should
 go to the zoo today
 after your speech.

1379
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:39,887
 I hear it's really good.

1380
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:41,522
 They have breeding programs

1381
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,424
 for all these
 endangered species.

1382
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:44,726
             (GULPS)

1383
01:12:44,728 --> 01:12:45,927
  I'm sorry, what did you say?

1384
01:12:47,397 --> 01:12:48,996
    LISA AND MALE VOICE: Oh.
    They have breeding programs

1385
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:50,865
         for all these
         endangered species.

1386
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,501
          So you get to see
          things like pandas,

1387
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,536
          which I think
          are awfully cute.

1388
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:59,107
      They're not really
      bears, I read. (CHUCKLES)

1389
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:02,910
       Yeah. Sure.
       That sounds fine.

1390
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:06,047
            What is it?

1391
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,649
 Nothing. The zoo sounds good.

1392
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,955
       My stomach hurts.
       It feels empty.
       It's clenched.

1393
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:17,892
                 Oh.

1394
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:18,925
        Well, eat some more
        waffle maybe?

1395
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:22,997
     Did I do something wrong?

1396
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,602
         I'm sorry. Darling.

1397
01:13:27,604 --> 01:13:28,703
         It's okay.

1398
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,907
   I'm anxious about
   my speech, I suppose.

1399
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:33,975
                 Of course.

1400
01:13:34,878 --> 01:13:36,711
    Well, we'll have fun after.

1401
01:13:36,713 --> 01:13:37,745
             We don't have
             to go to the zoo.

1402
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,781
     We can just hang out here.

1403
01:13:39,783 --> 01:13:41,416
       I have the whole weekend
       till I have to get back
       to work.

1404
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:42,417
       That's great.

1405
01:13:43,153 --> 01:13:45,853
       I'm so happy, Michael.

1406
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:47,889
         I've waited for
         someone like you
         my whole life.

1407
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,092
      I've waited, too.

1408
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:54,862
 We'll work it all out, right?

1409
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:58,766
    Yes. Who would've thunk it?
    It's just so beautiful.

1410
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:00,935
           Life can be.

1411
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:03,604
       Things can work out.
       That's the lesson.

1412
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:08,876
 Sometimes there's no lesson.
 That's a lesson in itself.

1413
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:12,079
            I guess so.

1414
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:16,517
     I feel anxious, Michael.

1415
01:14:16,519 --> 01:14:19,120
  I feel something.
  Like you're different-acting.

1416
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:21,923
    Me? No, no, no.
    Everything's fine.
    I'm just...

1417
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:24,559
              I know.

1418
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:26,227
       I'm not great to look
       at in bright sunlight.

1419
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:27,995
   No, you're very pretty.

1420
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:30,231
               Okay.

1421
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:33,768
        So, we could maybe
        go out for a walk

1422
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,970
           and talk or
           something.
             Yes.

1423
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:38,806
       MALE VOICE: (AS LISA)
       So I'll see you after?

1424
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:39,740
           Of course.

1425
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:44,879
                MICHAEL: And...

1426
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,615
       Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

1427
01:14:49,519 --> 01:14:52,186
           Always remember,
           the customer is
           an individual.

1428
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:57,609
            Just like you.

1429
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:58,626
       Each person you speak to
       has had a day.

1430
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:03,598
     Some of their days
     have been good, some bad,

1431
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,899
     but they've all had one.

1432
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,504
      Each person you speak to
      has had a childhood.

1433
01:15:10,507 --> 01:15:11,739
          Each has a body.

1434
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:15,877
        Each body has aches.

1435
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:21,649
       What is it to be human?

1436
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:23,751
         What is it to ache?

1437
01:15:26,523 --> 01:15:29,056
       What is it to be alive?

1438
01:15:31,594 --> 01:15:32,827
             (SCOFFS)
             I don't know.

1439
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:36,764
         What is it to ache?
         I don't know.

1440
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:39,166
       What is it to be alive?
       I don't know.

1441
01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:45,940
           Uh, yes. "How do I
           talk to a customer?"

1442
01:15:45,942 --> 01:15:47,675
   How do I talk to a customer?

1443
01:15:47,677 --> 01:15:49,110
       These are
       the important questions

1444
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:51,879
        for a customer service
        representative.

1445
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:55,249
           What do I say?
           Do I smile while
           I'm on the phone?

1446
