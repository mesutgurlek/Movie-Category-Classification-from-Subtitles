1
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:35,790
Hello

2
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:37,956
Yes?

3
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:41,911
What?

4
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,759
Sir, kindly switch off your
mobile phone

5
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:45,919
Just one sec, please

6
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:57,356
Excuse me

7
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,036
Excuse me

8
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:18,316
Sir, please sit down

9
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,480
Captain, there's a
medical emergency

10
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:31,319
A passenger has just
fallen down in the aisle

11
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:34,194
Delhi, Air India 101 returning
due to medical emergency

12
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:43,677
Excuse me, sir

13
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:56,716
Hold on!

14
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:09,875
I'm fine now, thanks.
Carry on, please

15
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,595
Wait

16
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:44,000
Get the car!
- Mr. Dhillon?

17
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:46,431
Want the name tattooed?
Get the car

18
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:50,271
To the hotel, sir?

19
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,035
Yes, yes, but via Vasant Vihar

20
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,714
Step on the gas, dude!

21
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:09,950
Yeah, Farhan?

22
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:12,470
Get ready. I'll pick you up
in five minutes

23
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:13,631
What happened?

24
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,593
Chatur called. Remember him?

25
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:17,555
The 'Silencer'?

26
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:18,597
Yeah

27
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,999
He said Rancho is coming

28
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:24,997
What?

29
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:28,710
He said - Come to the campus at 8.
On the tank

30
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,151
Oh shucks!

31
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:32,157
Hurry!

32
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:33,436
Ok

33
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:41,395
Honey, I'll be back soon.
Oh, shoes

34
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:43,390
We found our buddy

35
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:46,871
What?

36
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:49,160
Tell me later, bye

37
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,400
You forgot your pants

38
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,356
Now to the hotel, sir?

39
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:05,439
Yes, but via
Imperial College of Engineering

40
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:06,877
Ok sir

41
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:07,871
Forgot my socks

42
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,710
More than just your socks

43
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:11,513
Your pants

44
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:12,591
Oh no

45
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:27,678
Now get my brother
from the airport

46
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:28,950
Same last name - Dhillon

47
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,557
This is Dhillon.
Where's my cab? On the runway?

48
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:53,071
Hey Rancho

49
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:54,794
Hey Chatur, where's Rancho?

50
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:56,675
Rancho

51
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:58,431
Where's Rancho?

52
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,032
Welcome, idiots

53
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:06,510
Some 'madeira' for you?

54
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,078
The same rum you
guzzled those days

55
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:12,916
Have a drink

56
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14,710
Where is Rancho?

57
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:18,358
Patience. First look at this

58
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:22,593
Don't eye my wife. Check out
the mansion behind, idiots

59
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,759
$ 3.5 million

60
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:27,758
Swimming pool - heated!

61
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:30,916
Living room - maple wood flooring

62
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:34,631
My new Lambhorghini 6496 cc -

63
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:36,356
very fast

64
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,432
Why're you showing us all this?

65
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:39,911
Forgot?

66
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:43,871
What's this?

67
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:46,198
'5th September'. Today's date

68
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:05,033
I challenge you

69
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:07,357
We'll meet again after ten years

70
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,632
Same day. Same place

71
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:12,755
We'll see who's more successful

72
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:17,632
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

73
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:23,076
Remember? I'd challenged
that idiot right here

74
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:26,553
I kept my promise. I'm back

75
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:31,149
Jackass! I aborted a flight,
he forgot his pants

76
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:32,310
all to meet Rancho

77
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,236
5 years we've searched.
Don't know if he's alive

78
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:37,921
and you think he'll show up
for your silly bet

79
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:42,080
I know he won't show up

80
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:44,473
You gonna break his jaw
or should I

81
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:47,554
So why'd you call us here?

82
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:48,875
To meet Rancho

83
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:53,240
Come and see where I've reached
and where he rots

84
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:54,720
So you know where Rancho is?

85
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:57,760
Yes

86
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:00,037
Where?

87
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,959
He is in Shimla

88
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:13,954
Free as the wind was he

89
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:20,521
Like a soaring Kite was he

90
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:28,191
Where did he go... let's find him

91
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:45,673
Free as the wind was he

92
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:50,678
Like a soaring Kite was he

93
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:55,957
Where did he go... let's find him

94
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:02,078
We were led by the path we took

95
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:05,318
While he carved a path of his own

96
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:10,675
Stumbling, rising, carefree walked he

97
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:15,232
We fretted about the morrow

98
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,473
He simply reveled in today

99
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:24,193
Living each moment to the fullest

100
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,598
Where did he come from...

101
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:35,630
He who touched our hearts
and vanished...

102
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:41,997
Where did he go... let's find him

103
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:51,471
In scorching Sun,
he was like a patch of shade...

104
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:54,713
In an endless desert, like an oasis...

105
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:59,512
On a bruised heart,
liKe soothing balm was he

106
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:04,598
Afraid, we stayed confined in the well

107
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:07,798
Fearless, he frolicked in the river

108
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:13,280
Never hesitating to swim
against the tide

109
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:18,032
He wandered lonesome as a cloud

110
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:22,992
...Yet he was our dearest friend

111
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:27,957
Where did he go... let's find him

112
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:29,111
Rancho

113
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:31,591
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

114
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:35,393
He was as unique as his name

115
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:38,800
From birth we were taught -
Life is a race

116
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:42,113
Run fast or you 'll be trampled

117
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:46,477
Even to be born, one had to race
300 million sperms

118
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:52,111
1978. I was born at 5.15 pm

119
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:55,234
At 5.16, my father announced

120
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:59,758
My son will be an engineer.
- Farhan Qureshi. B. Tech. Engineer

121
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:01,314
And my fate was sealed

122
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:06,594
What I wanted to be... no one asKed

123
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,481
Raju Rastogi...
Ranchhoddas Chanchad

124
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,037
Room number?

125
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:36,757
D-26

126
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:39,351
C'mon

127
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,239
I'm Man Mohan. MM

128
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,159
These engineers call me
Millimeter

129
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:45,716
For eggs, bread, milk, laundry

130
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:47,513
finishing journals,
copying assignments

131
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:51,117
I'm your guy. Fixed rates.
No bargaining

132
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:53,199
Hey wait, hold this

133
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:59,236
Meet Kilobyte, Megabyte,
and their mother Gigabyte

134
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:01,238
Go ahead, click -
this family doesn't bite

135
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:09,437
Check him out...
another God-fearing soul

136
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,157
Hi. Farhan Qureshi
- I'm Raju Rastogi

137
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,430
Don't worry

138
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:25,676
a few days here and
hell lose faith in God

139
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:29,479
Then naked babes will be
on the wall, and he'll say -

140
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:32,840
Oh God,
give me one chance with her

141
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:34,516
Get out of here

142
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:37,277
Four bucks. Two per bag

143
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,073
Here's five. Keep the change

144
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:45,360
Thanks boss. For your tip,
here's one in return -

145
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:49,359
Wear your best underwear tonight

146
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:52,670
Why?

147
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:57,113
Your Majesty, thou art great

148
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,191
Accept this humble offering

149
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,232
Ha... here's a He-Man

150
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:07,709
What a pretty piece.
Cute and compact

151
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,440
A campus tradition - On Day 1...

152
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:12,040
Freshmen must pay
their respects to Seniors

153
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:14,314
in their underwear

154
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,714
This is when we first saw Rancho

155
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:27,757
Spiderman

156
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,117
Batman

157
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,274
Fresh meat

158
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:41,712
Greetings.
Drop your pants, get stamped

159
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:42,631
Name?

160
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,393
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad'

161
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:48,399
What a mouthful!
Needs serious cramming

162
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:50,111
Come on - pants off

163
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:54,269
Being stubborn?

164
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:01,916
Wet pants not good, kiddo.
Take them off

165
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:04,959
Aal izz well
- What's that?

166
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:06,634
Aal izz Well

167
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:07,597
What did he say?

168
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,794
Someone tell him.
Hey James Bond

169
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,070
Make him understand

170
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:15,831
Take off your pants or
they are going to piss on you

171
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:18,395
Hey 007!
Ashamed to speak Hindi?

172
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:21,917
Sorry sir, I was born in Uganda,
studied in Pondicherry

173
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:23,400
so little slow in Hindi

174
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:26,558
So explain slowly. No hurry

175
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:29,836
Feeling cold?

176
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:32,517
Pray undress

177
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:37,472
or he'll do
'urine-expulsion' on you

178
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:40,273
Calls pissing 'urine-expulsion'!

179
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:43,996
A true linguist
in the land of engineers!

180
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,913
Hey, come out of there

181
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:00,070
Come out or...

182
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:04,198
or I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door

183
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:15,279
If you aren't out by
the count of ten

184
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:20,398
I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door all semester

185
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:24,991
One

186
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,280
Two

187
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:36,476
Three

188
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:47,874
Four

189
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:52,876
Five

190
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,115
Six

191
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,316
Seven

192
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:14,630
Eight

193
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,710
Nine

194
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:30,995
Ten

195
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:19,318
Salt water is a great conductor
of electricity. 8th Grade Physics

196
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,395
We had studied it.
He applied it

197
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:31,275
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe
was the Director of ICE

198
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:34,633
Students called him Virus,
computer Virus

199
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,475
Virus on the way, with eggs

200
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:41,111
Freshmen are summoned.
Come quickly

201
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:43,869
Virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen

202
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:48,071
He couldn 't bear anyone
getting ahead of him

203
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:54,792
To save time,
his shirts had Velcro

204
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,400
and his ties had hooKs

205
00:17:58,761 --> 00:18:02,720
He'd trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously

206
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:10,114
Everyday at 2 pm he tooK a
71/2 minute power nap

207
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:11,715
with an opera as lullaby

208
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,200
Govind, his valet, had instructions

209
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:22,192
to carry out all unproductive tasKs
such as shaving, nail-cutting etc

210
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:40,990
What is this?
- Sir, nest

211
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:43,311
Whose?
- A koel bird's nest, sir

212
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:44,356
Wrong

213
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,159
A koel bird never makes
her own nest

214
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:50,556
She lays her eggs in
other nests

215
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:55,239
And when they hatch,
what do they do?

216
00:18:57,081 --> 00:19:02,519
They push the other eggs
out of the nest

217
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:07,276
Competition over

218
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:11,951
Their life begins with murder.
That's nature

219
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,236
Compete or die

220
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:19,151
You also are like the koel birds

221
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:27,513
And these are the eggs
you smashed to get into ICE

222
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:32,751
Don't forget, ICE gets
400,000 applications a year

223
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:37,113
and only 200 are selected - You!

224
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:42,158
And these? Finished.
Broken eggs

225
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:46,596
My son... he tried for three years

226
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,837
Rejected. Every time

227
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:54,639
Remember, life is a race

228
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:58,718
If you don't run fast,
you'll get trampled

229
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:01,198
Let me tell you a
very interesting story

230
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:04,595
This is an astronaut pen

231
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:08,355
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don't work in outer space

232
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:13,234
So scientists spent
millions to invent this pen

233
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:17,714
It can write at any angle, in any
temperature, in zero gravity

234
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:19,799
One day, when I was a student

235
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:21,759
the Director of our institute
called me

236
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:24,356
He said, 'Viru Sahastrabuddhe.'
I said, 'Yes sir'

237
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:25,880
'Come here! '
I got scared

238
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:28,350
He showed me this pen

239
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,951
He said, 'This is a
symbol of excellence'

240
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:34,670
'I give it to you'

241
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:40,195
'When you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself

242
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:42,399
...pass it onto him'

243
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:47,594
For 32 years, I've been
waiting for that student

244
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:49,076
But no luck

245
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:53,711
Anyone here, who'll strive
to win this pen?

246
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:58,232
Good.
Put your hands down

247
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,036
Shall I post it on the notice board?
Hands down

248
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:06,749
One question, sir

249
00:21:08,281 --> 00:21:11,512
Sir, if pens didn't work
in outer space

250
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,561
why didn't the astronauts
use a pencil?

251
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,356
They'd have saved millions

252
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:31,240
I will get back to you on this

253
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:37,271
He zaps a Senior's privates
at night

254
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:40,592
fingers the Director in the day.
Best avoid him

255
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,757
You deflated Virus's erection

256
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:46,636
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

257
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:49,110
Buzz off.
You don't have school?

258
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,954
Who'll pay for it? Your pop?

259
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,238
Keep off my dad!
- Relax

260
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:58,077
For school you don't need
tuition money, just a uniform

261
00:21:58,281 --> 00:22:03,480
Pick a school,
buy the uniform, slip into class

262
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:05,674
In that sea of kids,
no one will notice

263
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:08,954
If I get caught?
- Then new uniform, new school

264
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,240
See that?
- He was different...

265
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:14,758
He challenged conventions
at every stage

266
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:17,955
A free-spirited bird had
landed in Virus's nest

267
00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:21,594
We were robots, blindly following
our professors ' commands

268
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,709
He was the only one
who was not a machine

269
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:27,236
What is a machine?

270
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:33,919
Why're you smiling?

271
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,955
Sir, to study Engineering
was a childhood dream

272
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:41,116
I'm so happy to be here finally

273
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:45,356
No need to be so happy.
Define a machine

274
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:49,992
A machine is anything that
reduces human effort

275
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:51,720
Will you please elaborate?

276
00:22:55,161 --> 00:23:00,155
Anything that simplifies work,
or saves time, is a machine

277
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:04,156
It's a warm day, press a button,
get a blast of air

278
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:05,560
The fan... A machine!

279
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:09,193
Speak to a friend miles away.
The telephone... A machine!

280
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,319
Compute millions in seconds.
The calculator... A machine!

281
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,918
We're surrounded by machines

282
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:17,830
From a pen's nib to a pants' zip -
all machines

283
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:20,550
Up and down in a second.
Up, down, up, down...

284
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:24,674
What is the definition?

285
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:26,993
I just gave it to you, sir

286
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:31,991
You'll write this in the exam?
This is a machine - up, down...

287
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,678
Idiot! Anybody else?

288
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:36,191
Yes?

289
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:38,750
Sir, machines are any combination
of bodies so connected

290
00:23:38,841 --> 00:23:40,354
that their relative motions
are constrained

291
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:42,790
and by which means, force
and motion may be transmitted

292
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,116
and modified as a screw
and its nut, or a lever arranged

293
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:47,801
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot, etc

294
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:49,917
especially, a construction,
more or less complex

295
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:51,832
consisting of a combination
of moving parts, or

296
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:55,118
simple mechanical elements,
as wheels, levers, cams etc

297
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,311
Wonderful

298
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:59,000
Perfect. Please sit down

299
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:00,515
Thank you

300
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,760
But sir, I said the same thing,
in simple language

301
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:08,749
If you prefer simple language,
join an Arts and Commerce college

302
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,678
But sir, one must get
the meaning too

303
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,153
What's the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition

304
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:15,959
You think you're smarter
than the book?

305
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:21,076
Write the textbook definition, mister,
if you want to pass

306
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:22,913
But there are other books...
- Get out!

307
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:25,109
Why?

308
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:27,237
In simple language - Out!

309
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:37,591
Idiot!

310
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,950
So, we were discussing
the machine...

311
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,391
Why're you back?

312
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:46,516
I forgot something

313
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:47,951
What?

314
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,271
Instruments that record,
analyze, summarize, organize

315
00:24:51,361 --> 00:24:53,591
debate and explain information;
that are illustrated, non-illustrated

316
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:55,552
hard-bound, paperback,
jacketed, non-jacketed

317
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:57,598
with foreword, introduction,
table-of-contents, index

318
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:59,433
that are intended for the
enlightenment, understanding

319
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:01,193
enrichment, enhancement and
education of the human brain

320
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:03,357
through the sensory route of
vision, sometimes touch

321
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:10,838
What do you mean?

322
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:12,309
Books, sir

323
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:15,156
I forgot my books. May I?

324
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:17,113
Couldn't you ask simply?

325
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:20,593
I tried earlier, sir.
It simply didn't work

326
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:29,357
Professors kept Rancho
mostly out... seldom in

327
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,480
When thrown out of one class,
he'd slip into another

328
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:36,755
He said - First year or fourth year,
it's knowledge. Just grab it

329
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:38,475
He was unliKe any of us

330
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:40,999
We fought for a shower
every morning

331
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:43,711
He'd bathe
wherever he found water

332
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:44,711
Morning, sir

333
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:48,280
Machines were his passion

334
00:25:48,521 --> 00:25:52,639
When he spotted them,
he opened them

335
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:53,916
Some he could re-assemble...

336
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:56,235
some he couldn 't

337
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,470
There was another, just liKe him

338
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,355
Joy Lobo

339
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:05,713
Sir. Excuse me, sir

340
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:07,710
Mr. Joy Lobo!

341
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,910
Sir, if I could know the
convocation dates...

342
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:11,837
Why?

343
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:13,673
Dad wants to make
train reservations

344
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:17,397
I'm the first engineer from my
village. Everyone wants to attend

345
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:20,357
In that case, call your dad

346
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,838
Please hurry up.
Don't waste my time

347
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:29,991
Hello

348
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,033
Dad, the Director wants to
speak to you

349
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:34,156
Joy!

350
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:36,670
Mr. Lobo, your son won't
graduate this year

351
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,071
What happened, sir?

352
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:41,231
He has violated all deadlines

353
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:45,150
Mr. Lobo, it's an unrealistic project

354
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:47,119
He is making some
nonsense helicopter

355
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:51,838
I suggest you don't book
your tickets. I'm so sorry

356
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:56,270
Sir, I am this close, sir
- Is your project ready?

357
00:26:56,801 --> 00:27:00,476
Is your project ready?
- Sir, see it once, please

358
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:02,159
Submit it, and we'll consider

359
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,551
Sir, a small extension...
- Why, why should I?

360
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:07,633
After dad's stroke,
I couldn't focus for two months

361
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:08,955
Did you stop eating?

362
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:10,430
No

363
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:11,517
Stopped bathing?

364
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:13,471
So why stop studying?

365
00:27:13,601 --> 00:27:16,195
Sir, I'm very close.
See it once, please...

366
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:17,436
Mr. Lobo!

367
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,514
Sunday afternoon, my son
fell off a train and died

368
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:25,556
Monday morning, I taught a class.
So don't give me that nonsense

369
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:30,520
I can give you sympathy,
not an extension

370
00:27:31,521 --> 00:27:33,079
Sir... I'm very close...

371
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:03,878
Lifelong I lived

372
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:06,197
The life of another

373
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:08,596
For just one moment

374
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,231
Let me live as I...

375
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,318
Lifelong I lived

376
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:15,711
The life of another

377
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,917
For just one moment

378
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,636
Let me live as I...

379
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:34,718
Give me some sunshine
Give me some rain

380
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:39,711
Give me another chance
I wanna grow up once again

381
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:44,158
Give me some sunshine
Give me some rain

382
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:49,999
Give me another chance
I wanna grow up once again

383
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:52,354
Dude's come up with an
amazing design

384
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:54,120
A wireless camera atop a helicopter

385
00:28:56,441 --> 00:28:58,432
Can be used for
traffic updates, security... Wow!

386
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:01,599
But Virus said it's an
impractical design, it won't fly

387
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:03,798
It will fly! We'll make it fly

388
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:08,117
Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise

389
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:11,035
We'll fly it up to his window
and capture his reaction

390
00:29:11,601 --> 00:29:13,637
If we work on his project,
who'll work on ours?

391
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:17,079
Tests, vivas, quizzes -
42 exams per semester

392
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:18,836
You scare easily, bro

393
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:24,230
Take your hand, put it over your
heart, and say, 'Aal izz well'

394
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:26,511
All is well?
- Aal izz well

395
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:29,076
Words of wisdom from
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

396
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,597
We had an old watchman
in our village

397
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:37,441
On night patrol, he'd call out,
'Aal izz well'

398
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:41,391
And we slept peacefully.
Then there was a theft

399
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:43,552
and we learned that
he couldn't see at night!

400
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:47,151
He'd just yell 'Aal izz well',
and we felt secure

401
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:53,352
That day I understood
this heart scares easily

402
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:56,072
You have to trick it

403
00:29:57,241 --> 00:30:02,759
However big the problem,
tell your heart, 'All is well, pal'

404
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:05,599
That resolves the problem?

405
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:07,559
No. But you gain courage to face it

406
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:13,191
Learn it up, bro.
We're gonna really need it here

407
00:30:30,241 --> 00:30:34,439
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

408
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:42,040
Let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

409
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:49,519
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

410
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:53,316
Just let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

411
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:57,230
Yell - All is Well...

412
00:30:57,321 --> 00:31:00,393
The chicken's clueless
about the egg's fate

413
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:04,237
Will it hatch or
become an omelette

414
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:08,078
No one Knows
what the future holds

415
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:10,593
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

416
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:14,913
Whistle away the toll
Yell - All is Well

417
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:18,838
Hey bro - All is Well

418
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:23,031
Hey mate - All is Well

419
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:26,877
Hey bro - All is Well

420
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:39,356
Confusion and more confusion
No sign of any solution

421
00:31:39,561 --> 00:31:43,349
Ah... finally a solution
But wait... what was the question?

422
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:46,393
If the timid heart with fear
is about to die

423
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:50,312
Then con it bro,
with this simple lie

424
00:31:50,841 --> 00:31:54,072
Heart's an idiot,
it will fall under that spell

425
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:56,678
Let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

426
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:00,840
Whistle away the toll
Yell - All is Well

427
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:05,073
Hey bro - All is Well

428
00:32:05,761 --> 00:32:08,798
Hey mate - All is Well

429
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:12,559
Hey bro - All is Well

430
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:25,470
Blew the scholarship on booze
But that did not dispel my blues

431
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:29,270
Holy incense lit up my plight
And yet God's nowhere in sight

432
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:32,478
The lamb is clueless for
what it's destined

433
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:36,358
Will it be served on skewers
or simply minced

434
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:40,232
No one Knows
what the future holds

435
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:42,672
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

436
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:47,079
Whistle away the toll
Yell - All is Well

437
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:50,799
Hey bro - All is Well

438
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:54,474
Hey mate - All is Well

439
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:58,594
Hey bro - All is Well

440
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:03,835
When life spins out of control
Just let your lips roll

441
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:09,880
Just let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

442
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:13,437
All is Well

443
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:16,474
The chicken's clueless
about the egg's fate

444
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:20,518
Will it hatch or
become an omelette

445
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:24,154
No one Knows
what the future holds

446
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:26,919
So let your lips roll
And whistle away the toll

447
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:28,480
Whistle away the toll

448
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:30,600
Eureka! Eureka!

449
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:35,114
Yell - All is Well

450
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:39,078
Hey Mrs. Chicken - All is Well

451
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:42,759
Hey Mr. Lamb - All is Well

452
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,633
Hey bro - All is Well

453
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:48,797
Hey, take it up to Joy's window

454
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:50,476
Take it higher

455
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,873
Look at Silencer - the nude dude!

456
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,680
Joy, come out

457
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:01,119
Come to the window

458
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:02,640
Joy, look outside

459
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,631
Good news, sir

460
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,839
The police and Joy's father
have no clue

461
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:02,355
Everyone thinks this is suicide

462
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:05,636
The post mortem report -

463
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:08,151
Cause of Death: Intense
pressure on windpipe

464
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:09,316
resulting in choking

465
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:15,749
All think the pressure
on the jugular killed him

466
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:20,234
What about the mental pressure
for the last four years?

467
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,037
That's missing in the report

468
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:26,479
Engineers are a clever bunch

469
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:31,078
They haven't made a machine
to measure mental pressure

470
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:34,715
If they had, all would know...

471
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:37,234
this isn't suicide... it's murder

472
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:45,030
How dare you blame me
for Joy's suicide?

473
00:35:45,881 --> 00:35:48,600
If one student can't handle
pressure, is it our fault?

474
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:52,511
Life is full of pressures.
Will you always blame others?

475
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:56,596
I don't blame you, sir.
I blame the system

476
00:35:58,001 --> 00:36:01,994
Look at these statistics -
India ranks No.1 in suicides

477
00:36:02,681 --> 00:36:05,912
Every 90 minutes,
a student attempts suicide

478
00:36:07,521 --> 00:36:10,319
Suicide is a bigger killer
than disease

479
00:36:10,521 --> 00:36:11,795
Something's terribly wrong, sir

480
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:14,077
I can't speak for the rest

481
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:16,598
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country

482
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:19,152
I've run this place for 32 years

483
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:22,798
We were ranked 28th.
Now we're No.1

484
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,474
What's the point, sir?

485
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:29,277
Here they don't discuss
new ideas or inventions

486
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:35,711
They discuss grades,
jobs, settling in the USA

487
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:41,671
They teach how to get good scores.
They don't teach Engineering

488
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:43,957
Now you will teach me
how to teach?

489
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:45,277
No sir, I...

490
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:49,436
Sir, my paper...

491
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:08,630
Vaidyanathan, please sit down

492
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:12,152
Here is a
self-proclaimed professor

493
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:17,117
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers

494
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:22,079
Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad
will teach us Engineering

495
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:41,511
We do not have all day

496
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:21,074
You have 30 seconds
to define these terms

497
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:23,437
You may refer to your books

498
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,957
Raise your hand
if you get the answer

499
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:30,432
Let's see who comes first,
who comes last

500
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:34,358
Your time starts... now

501
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:03,677
Time up

502
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:07,076
Time up, sir

503
00:39:08,881 --> 00:39:11,156
No one got the answer?

504
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:16,792
Now rewind your life by a minute

505
00:39:17,961 --> 00:39:20,680
When I asked this question,
were you excited? Curious?

506
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:23,480
Thrilled that you'd learn
something new?

507
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:26,550
Anyone? ...Sir?

508
00:39:29,361 --> 00:39:32,080
No. You all got into a frantic race

509
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,077
What's the use of such methods,
even if you come first

510
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:41,472
Will your knowledge increase?
No, just the pressure

511
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:43,840
This is a college,
not a pressure cooker

512
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:49,351
Even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip

513
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:53,757
But you call such a lion
'well trained', not 'well educated'

514
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:54,751
Hello!

515
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:59,632
This is not a philosophy class.
Just explain those two words

516
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,639
Sir, these words don't exist

517
00:40:02,761 --> 00:40:05,958
These are my friends' names.
Farhan and Raju

518
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:18,877
Quiet!

519
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:23,040
Nonsense! Is this how
you'll teach Engineering?

520
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:25,312
Sir, I wasn't teaching
you Engineering

521
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,314
You're an expert at that

522
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:31,238
I was teaching you... how to teach

523
00:40:33,961 --> 00:40:35,792
And I'm sure one day you'll learn

524
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:39,639
because unlike you, I never
abandon my weak students

525
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:41,076
Bye, sir

526
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:44,116
Quiet!

527
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:47,630
Quiet, I said

528
00:40:50,961 --> 00:40:54,192
I regret to inform you
that your son...

529
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:55,390
Farhan...
Raju...

530
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:56,676
has fallen into bad company

531
00:40:57,001 --> 00:41:00,038
Without urgent corrective steps,
his future will be ruined

532
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:04,232
Virus 's letters dropped on
our homes liKe atom bombs

533
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:06,876
Hiroshima and NagasaKi
plunged into gloom

534
00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:09,919
Our parents invited us -
for a dressing down

535
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:12,991
Come in

536
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:16,351
See that?

537
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:20,149
We could afford
just one air-conditioner

538
00:41:21,841 --> 00:41:25,356
We put it in Farhan's room,
so he could study in comfort

539
00:41:26,761 --> 00:41:30,549
I didn't buy a car.
I manage with a scooter

540
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,198
We put all our money
into Farhan's education

541
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:38,600
We sacrificed our comforts
for Farhan's future. U nderstand?

542
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:48,200
You took these pictures, Farhan?

543
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,952
He had that useless
obsession for a while

544
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:54,473
Went around taking
pictures of animals

545
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:57,234
Wanted to be a
wildlife photographer

546
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:00,710
Son, what was your
score that year?

547
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:02,790
91%

548
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:07,592
Hear that? Straight drop
from 94% to 91%

549
00:42:10,601 --> 00:42:12,000
You find it funny?

550
00:42:12,641 --> 00:42:16,554
No sir, sorry. I'm just
amazed at the photos

551
00:42:16,721 --> 00:42:19,235
Why make him an engineer...
Why not a wildlife photographer?

552
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:20,516
Enough!

553
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:26,795
I humbly request you -
Don't ruin my son's future

554
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:30,516
Food's on the table, boys. C'mon

555
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:37,436
If you ever visit again,
do eat with us

556
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:41,640
Dad denied us a meal...

557
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:43,793
So, to fill our bellies with food...

558
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:47,312
and ears with more reprimands,
we reached Raju's house

559
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:53,114
Raju's house was straight
out of a 50's black and white film

560
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:54,796
A small, dingy room...

561
00:42:54,961 --> 00:42:56,394
a paralyzed father...

562
00:42:57,161 --> 00:42:58,310
a coughing mother...

563
00:42:58,681 --> 00:43:00,114
and an unwed sister

564
00:43:01,201 --> 00:43:02,520
A sofa sprouting springs...

565
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:05,156
a 24 hour water supply -
from the leaKing roof

566
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:09,271
Mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer

567
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,991
Father was once a postmaster

568
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:14,790
Paralysis shut down
his body partly...

569
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:17,550
his salary completely.
And the sister...

570
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:21,191
Kammo's turned 28.
They demand a car in dowry

571
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:24,315
If you don't study and earn,
how will she marry?

572
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:25,677
Some okra?

573
00:43:26,641 --> 00:43:30,350
Okra is now 12/- per kilo,
cauliflower is 10/-

574
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:32,034
It's daylight robbery!

575
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:36,235
What will we eat if we get
warnings from your college?

576
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:37,357
Mom!

577
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:39,791
Cottage cheese?

578
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:43,631
Cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers, in velvet pouches

579
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,639
Cottage cheese?
- No, no, it's ok

580
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:47,760
Mom, please

581
00:43:48,601 --> 00:43:50,319
Alright, I'll shut up

582
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:56,233
Earn for the family,
slave like a maid

583
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:58,636
and then take the vow of silence

584
00:43:59,561 --> 00:44:03,918
If not with my son, with whom
do I share my woes - his friends?

585
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:08,716
Hey Raju

586
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:13,110
We were in a huge dilemma

587
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:16,713
Do we comfort our friend
or console his mom?

588
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:20,714
Screw it, we thought, let's
focus on the cottage cheese

589
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:34,880
Even his eczema cream
costs 55/- now

590
00:44:39,441 --> 00:44:40,715
Another roti?

591
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,874
No, thank you. We're through

592
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:53,829
Okra for 12/-
- Cauliflower for 10/-

593
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:58,513
At least you were offered a meal

594
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,074
Unlike your sadistic dad...
'Hitler' Qureshi!

595
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:04,795
And your mom is Mother Teresa...
Feeding us 'eczema roti'!

596
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:08,477
Don't poke fun at my mom!
- Enough, you guys

597
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:10,114
I'm famished. Let's eat out

598
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,516
It's month end. Who'll pay?
His Mother Teresa?

599
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:17,912
To eat out, you don't need money.
Just a uniform. Look...

600
00:45:20,601 --> 00:45:22,193
C'mon
- Come

601
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,871
Good evening,
good evening

602
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:26,791
Oh, U ncle

603
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:34,998
Three large vodkas.
- Half soda, half water

604
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:36,395
If we're caught, we're dead

605
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:38,995
What's for starters?
- Get double portions

606
00:45:39,081 --> 00:45:41,993
Leave this here and start
some peppy music

607
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:44,313
Pia, what the hell!

608
00:45:44,681 --> 00:45:47,275
Why're you wearing
this ancient piece of junk?

609
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:51,877
What'll people say - My fiancee...

610
00:45:52,281 --> 00:45:54,749
a doctor in the making,
wearing a cheap, 200/- watch!

611
00:45:55,641 --> 00:45:57,074
Please take it off. Thank you

612
00:45:57,601 --> 00:45:58,590
Hi handsome

613
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:01,440
Hey Aunty.
You're looking good

614
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:03,989
Don't miss my set, darling
- Rubies?

615
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,675
From Mandalay
- Mandalay... Wow!

616
00:46:06,761 --> 00:46:09,355
Hey, let's go meet David
- Of course

617
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:13,436
Excuse me

618
00:46:15,521 --> 00:46:16,636
Yes?

619
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:17,956
Flowers

620
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:22,473
May I take the glass?
- Why?

621
00:46:22,761 --> 00:46:24,956
So you don't break it on my head

622
00:46:25,721 --> 00:46:26,915
Why would I do that?

623
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,357
For the free advice I'll now impart

624
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:31,311
What?

625
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:33,154
Don't marry that ass

626
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:35,077
Excuse me?

627
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:36,919
He's not a human,
he's a price tag

628
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:40,199
He'll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices

629
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:43,269
He'll ruin your life.
Your future will be finished

630
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:44,391
Want a demonstration?

631
00:46:46,481 --> 00:46:48,039
Shall I find out
the price of his shoes?

632
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:51,352
I won't ask.
He'll announce it himself

633
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:08,632
What the hell...
Mint sauce on my $300 shoes!

634
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:11,833
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

635
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:14,955
Genuine Italian leather -
hand-stitched!

636
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:21,955
Dad, are they your guests?

637
00:47:25,161 --> 00:47:28,312
My students.
What're they doing here?

638
00:47:32,121 --> 00:47:33,270
Hold on, Dad

639
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:36,911
These beans smell great

640
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:39,271
No room for roti
- Just pile it on

641
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:42,480
Hi
- Hey

642
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:46,839
That was an eye-opener.
Thank you so much

643
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:50,476
It was my moral responsibility

644
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:52,594
Can I ask you for little more help?

645
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:56,155
Dad won't let me break off
this engagement

646
00:47:57,081 --> 00:48:00,915
You explain so well.
Can you give him a demo too?

647
00:48:01,201 --> 00:48:03,715
Certainly.
Raju, the mint sauce

648
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:05,640
You're really sweet

649
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,759
Where is your daddy?
- Right behind you

650
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:16,431
Aal izz well

651
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:22,150
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

652
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,920
What're you doing here?

653
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:27,513
We'll hand these gifts
to the couple

654
00:48:28,521 --> 00:48:30,716
I'll do that for you.
It's my sister's wedding

655
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:32,236
Sister?

656
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:37,270
Sir, what's the sum total
of your daughters?

657
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:39,631
Empty. No gift cheques

658
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:41,952
Forgot the cheques, Raju
...Farhan?

659
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:46,034
We didn't invite you,
you must be from the groom's side

660
00:48:46,521 --> 00:48:50,309
No sir, we're here as the
emissaries of science

661
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:52,557
How? Can you explain?

662
00:48:52,801 --> 00:48:56,316
Dad, he explains superbly.
I'm sure he'll give us a demo

663
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:57,511
Won't you?

664
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:01,757
Well, Delhi has plenty of
power cuts that...

665
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:04,231
disrupt wedding celebrations

666
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:06,597
So I thought of making
an inverter that...

667
00:49:06,721 --> 00:49:09,030
draws power from guests' cars

668
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:10,560
I see

669
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:12,194
Wow

670
00:49:12,561 --> 00:49:13,914
So where's the inverter?

671
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:16,239
Sir, the design is ready

672
00:49:19,201 --> 00:49:20,429
Where's the design, Farhan?

673
00:49:20,841 --> 00:49:23,753
I gave you the design
- I gave it to Raju

674
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,071
Raju, design?

675
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:31,636
Never mind the design.
I'll make the inverter and show you

676
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:35,476
You can only invent stories,
not an inverter

677
00:49:35,761 --> 00:49:38,719
I'll make one, I promise

678
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:42,397
And I'll name it after you.
After all, it was invented...

679
00:49:42,801 --> 00:49:46,157
at your daughter's wedding.
So it'll be an honor...

680
00:49:46,281 --> 00:49:52,072
Farhan, Raju. I'll see you
in my office tomorrow

681
00:49:57,721 --> 00:50:01,077
Sir, what was the cost per plate?
We'll reimburse you

682
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:02,993
...in installments

683
00:50:05,361 --> 00:50:08,478
We'll never crash a wedding again
- Not even my own

684
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:10,751
In fact, I won't even marry.
Nor will he

685
00:50:11,401 --> 00:50:13,357
Uh... right. No marriage

686
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:17,076
Your parents shouldn't have
married either

687
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:21,115
The world would have
to feed two less idiots

688
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:24,510
Sit!

689
00:50:35,081 --> 00:50:36,070
Pay attention

690
00:50:46,561 --> 00:50:51,316
This is Ranchhoddas's father's
monthly income

691
00:50:52,601 --> 00:50:58,676
Couple of zeroes less,
and it's still a sizeable income

692
00:51:01,121 --> 00:51:07,196
But erase another zero,
and I would worry a little

693
00:51:08,401 --> 00:51:11,632
Isn't that your father's income,
Farhan?

694
00:51:12,481 --> 00:51:14,119
Yes, sir

695
00:51:15,441 --> 00:51:17,397
Now take away another zero...

696
00:51:20,321 --> 00:51:23,950
and that's your family income,
Raju Rastogi

697
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:26,400
Big reason to worry

698
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:37,793
Take my advice and shift into
Chatur Ramalingam's room

699
00:51:38,201 --> 00:51:42,274
Exams are here. Stay with
Rancho and you're sure to fail

700
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:05,630
Want a shave?
- No, sir

701
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:06,631
Then get lost!

702
00:52:17,441 --> 00:52:22,799
Raju, don't worry. This is Virus's
move to split us. Divide and rule

703
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:23,956
I have to worry

704
00:52:24,361 --> 00:52:27,717
He grades us, and I need
good grades for a good job

705
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:31,513
Unlike you, I don't have a
rich dad I can live off

706
00:52:31,641 --> 00:52:33,438
Shut up, Raju

707
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:36,241
Must we follow all his hogwash?
'Aal izz well'

708
00:52:36,601 --> 00:52:38,000
I won't be his flunky... like you

709
00:52:38,921 --> 00:52:41,116
You're crossing the line
- No, I'm drawing one

710
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:43,239
I have a family to support

711
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,511
Dad's medicines
swallow up mom's pension

712
00:52:49,401 --> 00:52:53,599
My sis can't marry because
they want a car in dowry

713
00:52:56,401 --> 00:53:00,474
Mom hasn't bought a
single saree in five years

714
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:06,273
Now don't get your mom's
wardrobe into the debate

715
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:09,272
By the way, how many sarees
per annum is reasonable?

716
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:11,515
Hey... no wisecracks about mom

717
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:16,314
We'll study with all our heart,
but not just for grades

718
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:21,113
To quote a Wise One - Study
to be accomplished, not affluent

719
00:53:21,841 --> 00:53:27,154
Follow excellence. And success
will chase you, pants down!

720
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:30,835
Which Wise One says this?
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas?

721
00:53:32,801 --> 00:53:33,756
Go rot in the bogs!

722
00:53:35,321 --> 00:53:38,199
Raju, don't stress. We'll top
our class. Nothing is impossible

723
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,596
Oh yeah?

724
00:53:43,121 --> 00:53:45,157
Shove this back into the tube

725
00:53:48,081 --> 00:53:49,639
Raju got onto another train

726
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:55,110
His travails with Chatur began.
Yes, I mean travails, not travels

727
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,192
Chatur was called 'Silencer'

728
00:54:01,521 --> 00:54:05,070
To sharpen his memory,
he popped pills from a local quack

729
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:07,358
And then let off silent...
but lethal farts

730
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:13,033
I didn't do it... Raju?

731
00:54:13,201 --> 00:54:15,761
He always blamed others
for the output

732
00:54:16,481 --> 00:54:19,234
Silencer crammed 18 hours a day

733
00:54:19,481 --> 00:54:22,473
On exam eve,
he would distract others

734
00:54:26,281 --> 00:54:29,239
His belief - There are only
two ways of topping

735
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:32,712
Elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents' grades

736
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:40,550
Rancho decided to subdue
Silencer and rescue Raju...

737
00:54:41,001 --> 00:54:42,229
with one master plan

738
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:51,881
Our Director has unceasingly
served... 'Served' means...

739
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:55,840
Damn the meaning,
I'll memorize it

740
00:54:57,201 --> 00:55:00,671
Chatur was the introductory speaker
at the Teachers' Day function

741
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:04,755
To impress Virus, he got his
speech written by the librarian...

742
00:55:04,961 --> 00:55:06,235
in highbrow Hindi

743
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:12,875
Hello. Hold on.
Chatur, call for you

744
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:15,550
Please collect the printout.
I'll be right back

745
00:55:16,881 --> 00:55:20,032
Oh... the things I have to do...

746
00:55:23,481 --> 00:55:26,518
Mr. Dubey, the Director was
remembering you

747
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:28,154
Really?
- Yes. Just now

748
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:31,752
I'll see him right away.
Give this to Chatur

749
00:55:36,721 --> 00:55:39,633
Hello. Hello
- Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?

750
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:40,637
Yes?

751
00:55:41,201 --> 00:55:43,476
I'm calling from the police station

752
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,560
Are you from Uganda?
- Yes sir

753
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:50,953
Your life is in danger
- What? ...How?

754
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:53,759
Listen carefully, or else...

755
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:58,513
you'll get killed as you step out
of the college gate

756
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:00,435
Why? What happened?

757
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:02,074
While Chatur was Kept engaged

758
00:56:02,481 --> 00:56:06,315
Rancho altered a few words
in his speech, for eg...

759
00:56:06,521 --> 00:56:08,796
'served' became 'screwed'

760
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:10,829
Yes sir?

761
00:56:11,361 --> 00:56:13,795
Who are you?
- Dubey. Librarian

762
00:56:16,281 --> 00:56:17,396
I'm permanent staff, sir

763
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:19,354
Congratulations

764
00:56:19,761 --> 00:56:22,992
Hold on a moment.
The chief is on the other line

765
00:56:23,361 --> 00:56:24,271
Excuse me, sir

766
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:35,711
Yes... so where was I?

767
00:56:35,961 --> 00:56:38,270
You said I may die...
outside the gate

768
00:56:38,401 --> 00:56:44,556
Right. As you get out of the gate,
you'll see a traffic signal

769
00:56:44,761 --> 00:56:46,717
Traffic signal. Ok

770
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:52,234
When it turns red,
all the cars will halt

771
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:53,995
Ok. Then?

772
00:56:54,121 --> 00:56:56,032
Then cross the road
with great caution

773
00:56:56,761 --> 00:57:01,789
Because son, in rush hour
if a car hits you, you're dead

774
00:57:03,641 --> 00:57:05,393
What nonsense! I know that

775
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:08,957
You know that? Excellent.
Then you're safe my boy

776
00:57:15,721 --> 00:57:17,712
From the librarian, Silencer

777
00:57:17,841 --> 00:57:19,354
You don't call me that,
Chanchad

778
00:57:24,961 --> 00:57:26,952
Hey. The Director said
he didn't call for me

779
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:29,871
Who said 'called'?
I just said he 'remembered' you

780
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:32,509
Remembered?
Rascals!

781
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:42,311
Distinguished Mr. Chairperson

782
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:48,639
Chief guest, the Honorable
Minister of Education

783
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:53,029
respected teachers and friends

784
00:57:54,561 --> 00:57:59,237
ICE has now soared
beyond the stratosphere

785
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:03,959
The credit goes solely to

786
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:07,990
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.
Give him a big hand

787
00:58:08,121 --> 00:58:12,000
Sir, the voice is his
but the words are mine

788
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:14,871
He's a great guy, really you are

789
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:24,149
For 32 years, he has
unceasingly screwed students

790
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:28,876
He means - 'served' students

791
00:58:29,121 --> 00:58:31,589
I'm sure his endeavors
will continue

792
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:38,996
We are astounded at
how one man, in one lifetime

793
00:58:39,201 --> 00:58:41,999
can screw so many, so well

794
00:58:44,961 --> 00:58:50,035
With rigorous training
he's built up his stamina

795
00:58:53,601 --> 00:58:59,949
He's spent every living minute
just screwing

796
00:59:02,441 --> 00:59:04,113
Let's replicate his methods

797
00:59:07,761 --> 00:59:13,199
Tomorrow ICE students
will go across the globe

798
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:19,791
Wherever we go,
we promise to screw

799
00:59:23,681 --> 00:59:26,753
We'll hoist this screwer's flag
all over the world

800
00:59:32,121 --> 00:59:36,717
We'll show the world that
our capacity to screw...

801
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:38,952
cannot be matched by any student...

802
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:42,591
anywhere on the planet

803
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:52,913
Mr. Minister. Good evening

804
00:59:53,481 --> 01:00:00,671
You have given this institution
what it sorely needs

805
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:02,959
Booty, funds
- Bosom

806
01:00:06,401 --> 01:00:08,471
It's booty, stupid. Bosom means...

807
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:11,797
What nonsense! That's insulting

808
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:16,757
Everyone has a bosom,
but it remains pocketed

809
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,192
No one offers it so readily

810
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:24,951
Vulgar fellow!

811
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,679
You have generously offered
your bosom...

812
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:29,999
to this relentless screwer

813
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:36,914
Now see how he makes it grow

814
01:00:37,161 --> 01:00:41,234
Is this what you teach here, Director?

815
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:51,877
On this august occasion,
here's a Sanskrit verse...

816
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:54,879
Listen to this - the might
of his fart in verse

817
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,835
A good loud fart is honorable

818
01:00:58,041 --> 01:01:00,316
'Fart'? Go, Silencer

819
01:01:00,481 --> 01:01:03,234
A medium fart is tolerable

820
01:01:06,401 --> 01:01:09,837
Softer windbreaks are terrible

821
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:17,391
And the silent ones unbearable

822
01:01:21,521 --> 01:01:23,034
What did I do?

823
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:29,954
That's what mindless cramming
does to you

824
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:33,477
Cramming may see you
through four years of college

825
01:01:33,721 --> 01:01:37,396
but it will 'screw' you
for the next 40 years

826
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:41,075
He still doesn't get it

827
01:01:46,961 --> 01:01:51,159
'Medium fart is tolerable'...
Unbelievable!

828
01:01:51,401 --> 01:01:53,961
You're a poet, Rancho.
How did you think of this?

829
01:01:55,321 --> 01:01:58,597
That was fun.
He didn't know what hit him

830
01:02:01,001 --> 01:02:04,198
You swines!
What did I ever do to you?

831
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:08,997
Sorry man.
Don't take it personally

832
01:02:09,241 --> 01:02:10,435
I will

833
01:02:11,001 --> 01:02:13,754
Chatur Ramalingam
will never forget this insult

834
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:18,070
I'll think of it every minute,
every second of my life

835
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:23,515
Sorry man. That was a demo
for Raju - Don't cram blindly

836
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:25,957
Understand and enjoy
the wonders of Science

837
01:02:26,081 --> 01:02:28,470
I'm not here to enjoy Science

838
01:02:28,601 --> 01:02:31,399
So You're here to screw Science

839
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:35,879
Go ahead.
Laugh at my methods

840
01:02:36,921 --> 01:02:41,073
But one day these methods
will bring me success

841
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:44,274
That day I'll laugh and you'll cry

842
01:02:45,641 --> 01:02:49,714
You're on the wrong track again.
Don't chase success

843
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:52,677
Become a good engineer
and success will chase you

844
01:02:52,881 --> 01:02:57,318
These ideals don't work
in the real world

845
01:02:58,121 --> 01:03:01,955
You take your train, I'll take mine

846
01:03:02,721 --> 01:03:05,872
Ten years from now
we'll meet at the same station

847
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:11,476
Same day. Same place.
We'll see who's more successful

848
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:14,070
you... or I

849
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:18,953
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

850
01:03:19,161 --> 01:03:22,597
It's a challenge

851
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:24,717
Watch it!

852
01:03:31,081 --> 01:03:31,957
What's he writing?

853
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:41,476
Don't forget this date

854
01:03:49,441 --> 01:03:51,909
I'm not used to
such expensive gifts, Suhas

855
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:53,435
Get used to them, Pia

856
01:03:53,561 --> 01:03:55,597
You're gonna be
Suhas Tandon's wife

857
01:03:55,721 --> 01:03:56,790
Where's the bill, man?

858
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:01,957
I'll be back

859
01:04:11,921 --> 01:04:13,513
You changed the speech?
- What?

860
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:14,431
Don't lie

861
01:04:15,121 --> 01:04:16,918
Um... Yeah

862
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:19,430
What's your problem with dad?
- I have no problem

863
01:04:19,881 --> 01:04:22,600
I'm making an inverter
named after him. Look... Oh

864
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:28,194
Why're you harassing him?

865
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:30,394
'Cause he runs a factory,
not a college

866
01:04:30,641 --> 01:04:34,190
Churning out asses.
Like that one

867
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:40,110
She destroyed it, man

868
01:04:43,361 --> 01:04:44,555
How dare you call him an ass?

869
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:47,912
He is one!
First Engineering, then MBA

870
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:49,759
then becomes a banker in the USA

871
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:53,030
Because it rakes in
more money?

872
01:04:53,281 --> 01:04:55,715
Life for him is just
a profit-loss statement

873
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:57,872
He sees profit in you,
so he's with you

874
01:04:58,201 --> 01:05:01,716
Director's daughter, doctor in the
making... Good for his image!

875
01:05:02,001 --> 01:05:03,229
It's not you he cares for

876
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,720
Who do you think you are?

877
01:05:06,961 --> 01:05:08,553
What do you mean
he doesn't care for me?

878
01:05:10,401 --> 01:05:12,312
New watch? One moment

879
01:05:13,481 --> 01:05:15,472
You always need a demo

880
01:05:16,481 --> 01:05:17,277
Hey Suhas

881
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:20,874
Where were you?

882
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:22,873
She's looking for her watch

883
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:24,759
What? You lost the watch

884
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:26,116
Never mind. Get another

885
01:05:26,401 --> 01:05:27,629
It cost 400,000!

886
01:05:29,601 --> 01:05:31,478
Mine's just 250/-
but keeps the same time

887
01:05:31,641 --> 01:05:33,871
How could you be so careless, Pia

888
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:37,033
This callous attitude is
disgusting. It's disrespectful

889
01:05:37,161 --> 01:05:39,629
That was a limited edition watch

890
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:43,311
Now wear your ancient
piece of junk at dinner

891
01:05:44,601 --> 01:05:45,954
What're you staring at?

892
01:05:48,801 --> 01:05:51,440
Here come the tears!
Real mature, Pia

893
01:05:51,961 --> 01:05:53,155
I can't handle this

894
01:05:53,961 --> 01:05:55,997
Stop crying and look for it

895
01:06:08,961 --> 01:06:11,759
Find another wrist
for this watch... Ass!

896
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:20,481
Hey, you're awesome.
Called him an ass to his face

897
01:06:20,721 --> 01:06:21,551
Get lost

898
01:06:22,321 --> 01:06:23,436
It's too noisy here

899
01:06:23,761 --> 01:06:25,592
She's saying 'Thank you',
I hear 'Get lost'

900
01:06:25,761 --> 01:06:28,480
I said 'Get lost'
- Don't get so uptight

901
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:31,480
Actually, you never
really loved him

902
01:06:31,881 --> 01:06:32,711
What do you mean?

903
01:06:33,081 --> 01:06:37,677
When you see him, do the
winds whisper a melody?

904
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,719
Your scarf flies in slow motion?

905
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:43,353
The Moon appears gigantic?

906
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:46,309
That happens in movies, not in life

907
01:06:46,441 --> 01:06:49,353
Happens in life too -
if you love a person

908
01:06:49,681 --> 01:06:50,716
...not an ass

909
01:06:55,881 --> 01:07:00,352
Hello. What?

910
01:07:01,401 --> 01:07:04,757
Oh God! Ok, I'm on my way

911
01:07:07,841 --> 01:07:09,672
You're a medical student,
right? Need your help

912
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:11,399
It's an emergency, please
- What?

913
01:07:11,881 --> 01:07:14,953
Please come with me.
What's that oath you doctors take -

914
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:17,721
You'll never deny a patient help...
The Hippocratic Oath

915
01:07:18,361 --> 01:07:20,113
Please help me,
it's an emergency

916
01:07:24,441 --> 01:07:27,478
You gatecrash my sister's wedding,
break off my engagement...

917
01:07:27,841 --> 01:07:30,116
my dad is popping
BP pills because of you...

918
01:07:30,601 --> 01:07:32,114
and here I am, helping you!

919
01:07:33,201 --> 01:07:34,350
Unbelievable!

920
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:39,190
This Hippocratic Oath -
It's really done us in!

921
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:45,672
Where's Raju, ma'am?
- Gone to get a cab

922
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:47,474
Called the ambulance
two hours ago

923
01:07:47,761 --> 01:07:50,229
In this country,
pizza reaches in 30 minutes

924
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:51,317
but an ambulance...!

925
01:07:51,561 --> 01:07:53,756
He needs hospitalization.
Urgently

926
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:08,310
Hey stop!

927
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:12,671
Move, it's an emergency!

928
01:08:14,241 --> 01:08:15,310
Move... move...

929
01:08:17,201 --> 01:08:18,236
Move... move...

930
01:08:22,121 --> 01:08:24,191
Doctor, emergency!

931
01:08:25,721 --> 01:08:26,597
That's the patient

932
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:34,312
Keep this. Hey, here's Raju

933
01:08:34,801 --> 01:08:36,632
What the hell!
You brought dad on the scooter

934
01:08:38,441 --> 01:08:39,715
Should I've sent him by courier?

935
01:08:40,081 --> 01:08:42,800
No wisecracks on dads profession!
Where is he?

936
01:08:43,361 --> 01:08:45,113
Go ask the doctor

937
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:49,158
Close call, Pia. A little delay,
we'd have lost him

938
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:52,160
Glad you didn't wait for an ambulance
and got him on the scooter

939
01:08:52,321 --> 01:08:53,993
Call me if there's a problem

940
01:09:02,561 --> 01:09:05,439
Rancho! Thank you...

941
01:09:07,121 --> 01:09:10,033
Thanking your buddies!
Silencer teaching you manners?

942
01:09:11,201 --> 01:09:14,159
Didn't he teach you -
A friend is man's greatest bosom?

943
01:09:15,881 --> 01:09:18,679
Go on now.
You have an exam tomorrow

944
01:09:19,241 --> 01:09:22,358
Exams we have many...
Dad mostly just one

945
01:09:23,961 --> 01:09:26,156
We won't budge from here
without the Postmaster

946
01:09:26,761 --> 01:09:27,671
Don't worry

947
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:38,434
Rancho, forgive me.
I was scared

948
01:09:38,681 --> 01:09:40,717
It's ok. Quiet, now

949
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:45,231
Please forgive me

950
01:09:51,561 --> 01:09:55,440
It's ok, calm down.
Go see your dad

951
01:09:55,961 --> 01:09:57,280
And don't go
with that weepy face

952
01:10:03,321 --> 01:10:04,276
Thanks buddy

953
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:19,997
Natty scooter. Saved a life.
How much does it cost?

954
01:10:20,281 --> 01:10:22,511
Pour some mint sauce
on it. It'll tell you

955
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:26,872
Hey, happy Independence Day

956
01:10:27,121 --> 01:10:28,759
Today isn't Independence Day

957
01:10:29,081 --> 01:10:32,118
For you it is! Now you're free
to wear your mom's watch

958
01:10:32,721 --> 01:10:35,360
No ass can say it's an
ancient piece of junk

959
01:10:37,561 --> 01:10:38,391
Hey

960
01:10:40,281 --> 01:10:42,192
How do you know
it was mom's watch?

961
01:10:43,881 --> 01:10:46,236
At your sister's wedding,
you wore sparkling new clothes

962
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:48,150
Only the watch was old

963
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:49,637
What could that mean?

964
01:10:51,841 --> 01:10:54,878
You really missed your mom
that day, didn't you?

965
01:10:57,601 --> 01:10:58,590
Yes

966
01:10:59,601 --> 01:11:01,273
Your mom must've been
really beautiful

967
01:11:03,721 --> 01:11:05,791
Yes. How do you know?

968
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:06,996
Seen your dad?

969
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:10,073
'Life is a race. If you don't run fast

970
01:11:10,241 --> 01:11:11,799
you'll be a broken egg
...cuckoo bird'

971
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,111
You...

972
01:11:15,321 --> 01:11:22,636
The winds whisper a melody

973
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:29,313
The sKy hums along

974
01:11:30,841 --> 01:11:36,518
Time itself is singing...

975
01:11:37,521 --> 01:11:40,911
Zoobi do...

976
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:46,032
Param pum

977
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:52,117
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum '

978
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:57,192
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

979
01:11:57,841 --> 01:12:02,676
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara
Zoobi doobi param pum '

980
01:12:03,001 --> 01:12:07,472
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

981
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:12,670
Leaves sing on their branches
Bees jam with flowers

982
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:17,591
Crazy sunbeams dance off petals
As birds yodel in the skies

983
01:12:18,161 --> 01:12:22,871
Flowers, bold and brazen
Snuggle and cootchie-coo

984
01:12:23,321 --> 01:12:27,712
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

985
01:12:28,721 --> 01:12:33,112
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara

986
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:38,118
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi

'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara

01:12:44,001 --> 01:12:48,791
My silly heart goes 'Zoobi doobi
zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

989
01:12:51,841 --> 01:12:54,753
Let's make the unique and
ever useful mint sauce

990
01:12:55,161 --> 01:13:00,315
The all-powerful sauce that
exposes phony people

991
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:03,431
Your 7th house is clear

992
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,991
Shunning an ass,
you 'll fall for a human

993
01:13:06,481 --> 01:13:08,119
Time is ripe for love

994
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,598
Temperature in New Delhi
remains stable

995
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:18,873
Clear sKies.
But if in love, expect rain

996
01:13:24,281 --> 01:13:28,718
Pitter-patter go the raindrops
Whish-whoosh whistles the wind

997
01:13:29,201 --> 01:13:34,036
Do-da-dee waltzes the rain
Boom-boom echoes the sKy

998
01:13:34,321 --> 01:13:39,190
Drenched in rain and passion
You sway your hips on cue

999
01:13:39,401 --> 01:13:43,997
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

1000
01:13:44,841 --> 01:13:49,232
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara

zoobi doobi' as it jives and jigs along

1004
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:30,072
The gorgeous low moon
Serenades the earth

1005
01:14:30,561 --> 01:14:35,430
A shooting star sKips along
Crooning a ballad of love

1006
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:40,597
The night is bright but lonesome
Come touch me, my handsome

1007
01:14:40,961 --> 01:14:45,591
I've seen it happen in movies
What's now happening with us

1008
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:50,798
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi pum paara

01:15:06,801 --> 01:15:10,999
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi'
...goes my silly heart

1013
01:15:11,881 --> 01:15:19,515
'Zoobi doobi zoobi doobi'
...goes my silly heart

1014
01:15:25,881 --> 01:15:27,075
Hello. Wake up

1015
01:15:27,961 --> 01:15:30,475
Huh... Postmaster's dead?
- What!

1016
01:15:30,561 --> 01:15:31,994
No, stupid

1017
01:15:32,401 --> 01:15:34,631
It's 8.30, your exam is at 9

1018
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:37,556
But we can't leave him alone

1019
01:15:37,881 --> 01:15:40,554
I'm here.
It's a matter of three hours

1020
01:15:40,641 --> 01:15:43,201
Take my scooter.
It's getting late

1021
01:15:43,641 --> 01:15:44,630
Hey...

1022
01:15:48,841 --> 01:15:50,160
Gosh, what an ancient watch

1023
01:15:56,441 --> 01:15:57,351
Go

1024
01:16:14,721 --> 01:16:17,030
Sorry, we're late
- It was an emergency

1025
01:16:22,681 --> 01:16:23,750
Settle down there

1026
01:16:28,121 --> 01:16:29,315
Sir, they're still writing

1027
01:16:30,681 --> 01:16:32,239
Hello. Time up

1028
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:35,555
Please, five minutes.
We started half an hour late

1029
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:36,870
It was an emergency

1030
01:16:36,961 --> 01:16:41,079
He glared at us like we 'd
asKed for both his Kidneys

1031
01:16:42,241 --> 01:16:43,356
But we continued writing

1032
01:16:44,281 --> 01:16:47,193
He continued arranging
the answer sheets

1033
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:56,237
Done, sir

1034
01:16:57,201 --> 01:16:59,715
You're late.
I can't accept these

1035
01:16:59,921 --> 01:17:00,751
Sir, please, sir

1036
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,395
Sir, do you know who we are?

1037
01:17:07,801 --> 01:17:09,553
Prime Ministers son?
Even then...

1038
01:17:09,841 --> 01:17:11,832
I will not accept your paper

1039
01:17:13,281 --> 01:17:15,192
Do you know
our names and roll numbers?

1040
01:17:16,441 --> 01:17:17,510
No...

1041
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:20,270
Who are you?

1042
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:22,272
He doesn't know - Run!

1043
01:17:23,881 --> 01:17:26,076
Hey, what's your roll number?

1044
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:30,959
Where the hell are their papers?

1045
01:17:35,281 --> 01:17:37,033
O Lord, have mercy

1046
01:17:37,121 --> 01:17:42,673
Today was Results day.
Time to maKe a deal with God

1047
01:17:42,801 --> 01:17:45,190
Just save my Electronics.
I'll offer a coconut

1048
01:17:45,641 --> 01:17:50,351
Sir Snake, bless my Physics.
I promise a pint of milk per day

1049
01:17:50,561 --> 01:17:53,837
O Mother Cow,
help me pass... have this grass

1050
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:57,278
I vow: No X-rated thoughts
of girls in my class...

1051
01:17:57,561 --> 01:17:58,960
Watch over my results

1052
01:17:59,161 --> 01:18:02,870
God of Wealth, I'll offer 100/-
every month

1053
01:18:03,081 --> 01:18:05,595
100/- won't bribe even a traffic cop

1054
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,033
let alone the Almighty

1055
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:11,192
Check from the bottom

1056
01:18:12,161 --> 01:18:14,197
You are... last

1057
01:18:15,841 --> 01:18:16,717
And you?

1058
01:18:18,681 --> 01:18:20,080
Second last

1059
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:22,636
Rancho?

1060
01:18:26,881 --> 01:18:27,916
Not there

1061
01:18:29,241 --> 01:18:30,230
My heart sank

1062
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:35,033
Not 'cause our ranks tanked,
but 'cause our friend flunKed

1063
01:18:37,401 --> 01:18:40,950
There's a mistake.
It's not possible. It's injustice

1064
01:18:44,921 --> 01:18:47,719
What's Silencer howling about?

1065
01:18:48,321 --> 01:18:49,231
He got the second rank

1066
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:52,480
Who's first?

1067
01:18:53,641 --> 01:18:54,710
Rancho

1068
01:18:57,121 --> 01:18:58,315
Rancho?

1069
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:01,477
Move aside

1070
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:08,276
We learned a lesson
in Human Behavior:

1071
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:14,195
Your friend fails, you feel bad.
Your friend tops, you feel worse

1072
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:19,113
We were sad.
Two others were sadder

1073
01:19:20,321 --> 01:19:24,030
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
Front row. Right of the Director

1074
01:19:24,641 --> 01:19:26,836
Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat

1075
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,838
Alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat

1076
01:19:32,561 --> 01:19:35,121
Sahili Rao. Third row...

1077
01:19:35,281 --> 01:19:37,636
Sir, why this seating
according to rank?

1078
01:19:38,761 --> 01:19:39,955
Any problem with that?

1079
01:19:40,081 --> 01:19:44,040
Yes, this grading system is
like a caste system

1080
01:19:44,481 --> 01:19:47,518
A-graders: Masters
C-graders: Slaves

1081
01:19:47,801 --> 01:19:50,952
It's not nice, sir
- You have a better idea?

1082
01:19:51,521 --> 01:19:55,514
Yes. Results should not be
displayed at all

1083
01:19:55,961 --> 01:19:59,874
Why publicise someone's flaws?

1084
01:20:00,161 --> 01:20:04,996
If your iron count is low,
will the doctor prescribe tonic...

1085
01:20:05,121 --> 01:20:06,520
or air your report on TV

1086
01:20:07,321 --> 01:20:08,356
You see, sir?

1087
01:20:08,921 --> 01:20:10,639
So basically,
what you are saying is

1088
01:20:11,121 --> 01:20:12,839
I should personally go to
each student's room

1089
01:20:13,841 --> 01:20:14,876
and whisper in his ears...

1090
01:20:15,881 --> 01:20:18,190
'You have come first';
'You're second';

1091
01:20:18,281 --> 01:20:19,794
'Oh, I'm so sorry,
you have failed'

1092
01:20:22,681 --> 01:20:26,879
No sir, I mean
grades create a divide

1093
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:30,998
I've topped, so I'm next to you

1094
01:20:31,241 --> 01:20:33,550
My pals came last,
they're in the back corner

1095
01:20:33,721 --> 01:20:35,200
At least they're in the corner

1096
01:20:35,321 --> 01:20:37,630
More time with you, and
they'll be out of the photo

1097
01:20:38,721 --> 01:20:40,632
They will neither pass,
nor get a job

1098
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:45,110
They'll get jobs, sir.
There must be some firm that...

1099
01:20:45,561 --> 01:20:47,313
prefers humans to machines

1100
01:20:49,121 --> 01:20:50,873
They'll get jobs. I guarantee

1101
01:20:52,801 --> 01:20:55,031
You guarantee it!

1102
01:20:55,241 --> 01:20:56,720
Bet, sir?

1103
01:20:59,961 --> 01:21:01,235
Govind
- Yes, sir?

1104
01:21:05,241 --> 01:21:08,392
Even if one of them gets
a job in campus interviews...

1105
01:21:09,561 --> 01:21:10,710
shave off my moustache

1106
01:21:13,361 --> 01:21:14,191
Sir!

1107
01:21:14,481 --> 01:21:17,393
Happy?
- Smile, please

1108
01:21:18,641 --> 01:21:19,551
Happy, sir

1109
01:21:24,321 --> 01:21:27,199
Jackass!
Honking to hide your tooting

1110
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:30,315
Septic tank! Popping pills again?

1111
01:21:30,561 --> 01:21:33,121
I didn't do it... Raju?

1112
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:34,879
This is a familiar stink

1113
01:21:34,961 --> 01:21:37,873
He's the sole cause for
global warming

1114
01:22:02,121 --> 01:22:04,635
Toss me your wallet - I'll buy pants

1115
01:22:05,201 --> 01:22:09,194
Take Chatur's suit instead
- Don't touch my suit

1116
01:22:10,321 --> 01:22:12,039
Rancho'll recognize you
even in underwear

1117
01:22:12,201 --> 01:22:16,035
Where's this?
- If I could read, would I sell peanuts?

1118
01:22:16,241 --> 01:22:18,709
He can't read
- But he can speak

1119
01:22:18,921 --> 01:22:22,755
Wait. Do you know a
Ranchhoddas Chanchad?

1120
01:22:22,961 --> 01:22:24,633
Yes, he lives there

1121
01:22:25,281 --> 01:22:30,401
Free as the wind was he

1122
01:22:32,321 --> 01:22:37,520
Like a soaring Kite was he

1123
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,316
Where did he go...

1124
01:22:41,521 --> 01:22:43,671
let's find him

1125
01:22:43,801 --> 01:22:46,361
Chatur, your pills
- Thanks. Where were they?

1126
01:22:46,401 --> 01:22:48,835
In the pocket
- Hey, my pants!

1127
01:22:48,961 --> 01:22:50,872
Karl Marx says to
share all resources

1128
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:54,278
Hey, you'll give people ideas

1129
01:22:55,761 --> 01:22:56,750
I want it now

1130
01:23:11,401 --> 01:23:12,470
What happened?

1131
01:23:14,521 --> 01:23:15,670
Rancho's father

1132
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:21,680
Excuse me,
where is Ranchhoddas?

1133
01:23:22,481 --> 01:23:24,790
There he is
- Thank you

1134
01:23:47,041 --> 01:23:50,078
Rancho...
- Yes?

1135
01:23:50,641 --> 01:23:54,190
Sorry. We're looking for Ranchhoddas

1136
01:23:55,161 --> 01:23:56,435
I am Ranchhoddas

1137
01:23:57,001 --> 01:24:00,755
No, I mean... 'Ranchhoddas
Shamaldas Chanchad'

1138
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:04,589
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad. That's me

1139
01:24:09,841 --> 01:24:12,036
Ranchhoddas, take care, son

1140
01:24:30,561 --> 01:24:32,597
'Ranchhoddas Chanchad'

1141
01:24:39,481 --> 01:24:40,470
Raju

1142
01:25:04,721 --> 01:25:08,191
I'll be in the Guinness Book for
driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear

1143
01:25:08,321 --> 01:25:09,390
That too, for the wrong guy!

1144
01:25:09,881 --> 01:25:13,669
Same name, same degree,
same photo, but a different guy

1145
01:25:14,201 --> 01:25:15,634
What's going on?

1146
01:25:16,321 --> 01:25:18,881
How did Silencer get
Rancho's address?

1147
01:25:20,001 --> 01:25:20,831
Good point!

1148
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:23,554
Hey Chatur, come here

1149
01:25:29,601 --> 01:25:32,957
How dare you open this?
I got this from San Francisco

1150
01:25:33,001 --> 01:25:34,480
Handmade biscuits

1151
01:25:36,201 --> 01:25:38,396
Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu

1152
01:25:38,641 --> 01:25:40,711
Phunsukh Bangdu?
Who's that?

1153
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:45,192
Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'W'.
Phunsukh Wangdu

1154
01:25:45,321 --> 01:25:48,040
Do you know who that is?
He's a great scientist

1155
01:25:48,121 --> 01:25:50,715
400 patents.
The world wants him

1156
01:25:51,721 --> 01:25:55,031
Took me a year
to get an appointment

1157
01:25:55,761 --> 01:26:00,994
Once he signs the deal with
my company, I'll be huge!

1158
01:26:01,081 --> 01:26:05,074
Forget Wangdu.
How'd you get Rancho's address?

1159
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:07,078
You should be thanking
Phunsukh Wangdu

1160
01:26:07,441 --> 01:26:10,877
He led me to Rancho, See this

1161
01:26:12,961 --> 01:26:17,193
My secretary was here to fix
an appointment with Wangdu

1162
01:26:17,321 --> 01:26:21,473
She didn't get the appointment.
But I found Rancho

1163
01:26:21,601 --> 01:26:26,994
I checked the Shimla directory
and found Rancho's name

1164
01:26:27,041 --> 01:26:28,633
What happened to his face?

1165
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:31,196
Plastic surgery
in honor of your visit?

1166
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:37,193
Only one man has the answer

1167
01:26:37,761 --> 01:26:42,198
Sorry Papa,
I couldn't fulfill your last wish

1168
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:47,270
You kept asking me
to take you on pilgrimage

1169
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:50,550
But I waited
for the highway tender

1170
01:26:52,001 --> 01:26:56,279
There the tender opened,
here you closed your eyes

1171
01:27:00,201 --> 01:27:04,513
I am so sorry, Papa.
I could not be a good son...

1172
01:27:04,681 --> 01:27:05,955
Wrong

1173
01:27:06,401 --> 01:27:09,120
You're an engineer.
Your degree's on the wall!

1174
01:27:09,401 --> 01:27:10,629
You were a very good son

1175
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:17,712
How dare you barge in?
I'll have you arrested

1176
01:27:17,881 --> 01:27:20,953
No, you'll be arrested.
We've made enquiries

1177
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:24,193
You use the degree
to clinch contracts

1178
01:27:24,641 --> 01:27:27,758
It's our friend's degree.
How did you get it?

1179
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:44,074
This is a 150 acre estate

1180
01:27:44,481 --> 01:27:47,553
If I shoot and bury you,
no one would even notice

1181
01:27:47,881 --> 01:27:48,757
Get the point?

1182
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:50,871
Now get lost

1183
01:27:56,201 --> 01:28:00,353
I'm taking Papa's ashes to the
sacred river. Can take yours too

1184
01:28:07,521 --> 01:28:09,034
Grab Papa!

1185
01:28:11,841 --> 01:28:12,910
Here, here

1186
01:28:16,881 --> 01:28:17,870
Let go of Papa!

1187
01:28:20,681 --> 01:28:23,400
Tell the truth or
Papa is flushed!

1188
01:28:23,521 --> 01:28:26,319
Hand over Papa
- Papa goes to the sacred sewer

1189
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:30,198
Get Papa out of the potty
- You pull trigger, I pull flush.

1190
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:31,595
I'll count to three

1191
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:35,190
Wanna shoot us?
Raju, scatter the ashes

1192
01:28:37,801 --> 01:28:38,756
One

1193
01:28:38,921 --> 01:28:43,472
Take us down,
and Papa's down the drain

1194
01:28:44,681 --> 01:28:45,557
Two

1195
01:28:45,641 --> 01:28:47,996
Then grope for him in the gutter

1196
01:28:48,121 --> 01:28:48,951
What is it, Raju?

1197
01:28:50,321 --> 01:28:52,710
We've got the wrong urn.
It's empty!

1198
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:54,437
Empty?

1199
01:28:55,761 --> 01:28:59,071
Empty - we'll empty it out!

1200
01:28:59,201 --> 01:29:00,031
No, no!

1201
01:29:00,121 --> 01:29:02,874
We'll empty it out

1202
01:29:02,961 --> 01:29:05,316
No... hands up!

1203
01:29:07,521 --> 01:29:10,433
Who are you?

1204
01:29:10,601 --> 01:29:11,670
I am Rancho

1205
01:29:12,921 --> 01:29:15,276
I swear on Papa, it's true

1206
01:29:15,481 --> 01:29:17,199
I am Rancho!
That was Chhote.

1207
01:29:18,281 --> 01:29:19,077
Chhote?

1208
01:29:20,401 --> 01:29:25,191
He was our gardener's son, Chhote

1209
01:29:27,081 --> 01:29:29,800
He stayed on with us
after he was orphaned

1210
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:39,430
Did odd jobs around the house,
ran errands

1211
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:42,029
He had a passion for learning

1212
01:29:45,161 --> 01:29:47,721
He'd wear my old uniform
and slip into school

1213
01:29:49,641 --> 01:29:52,474
And attend any class he liKed.
It suited me

1214
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:59,192
I made him do my homework,
taKe my exams

1215
01:29:59,721 --> 01:30:02,633
It was going well, till
one day...

1216
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:07,432
Our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math

1217
01:30:07,481 --> 01:30:08,960
Which grade are you in, son?

1218
01:30:10,121 --> 01:30:11,270
What's your name?

1219
01:30:12,201 --> 01:30:13,111
We got caught

1220
01:30:14,201 --> 01:30:15,554
Papa was a powerful man, so...

1221
01:30:15,681 --> 01:30:19,037
our teacher alerted him
before going to the Principal

1222
01:30:19,521 --> 01:30:23,309
You started it, you will finish it

1223
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:28,594
People pretend to show me respect

1224
01:30:29,281 --> 01:30:31,397
But behind my back...

1225
01:30:32,321 --> 01:30:33,879
mock me as an illiterate

1226
01:30:34,841 --> 01:30:36,797
I won't let that happen to my son

1227
01:30:37,841 --> 01:30:41,993
This boy wants to study.
I want just a degree

1228
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:44,398
Let the game go on

1229
01:30:45,361 --> 01:30:46,919
Make this kid an engineer

1230
01:30:48,121 --> 01:30:53,275
and I'll have a degree
in my son's name on that wall

1231
01:30:53,601 --> 01:30:57,435
I went to London for four years,
he went to college as me

1232
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:04,957
He'd promised to cut contact with all
after getting the degree

1233
01:31:06,921 --> 01:31:15,158
But he always said,
'Two idiots will come looking for me'

1234
01:31:19,681 --> 01:31:21,273
He really misses you both

1235
01:31:23,601 --> 01:31:27,389
I'll give you his address,
go to him

1236
01:31:30,601 --> 01:31:33,957
But please keep my secret

1237
01:31:35,761 --> 01:31:36,876
What secret?

1238
01:31:49,681 --> 01:31:53,037
You got the wrong urn, sir.
Papa is in here

1239
01:31:55,161 --> 01:31:57,629
What the hell's going on?
Who was that gun guy?

1240
01:31:57,681 --> 01:32:01,071
Complicated story.
Without subtitles. Not for you

1241
01:32:01,121 --> 01:32:03,316
Ignore it
- Where're we going?

1242
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:05,477
Ladakh

1243
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:06,840
Ladakh! Why?

1244
01:32:07,521 --> 01:32:08,431
To meet Rancho

1245
01:32:08,601 --> 01:32:11,479
What's he doing in Ladakh?

1246
01:32:11,521 --> 01:32:14,957
No clue. We have
the address of a school

1247
01:32:15,201 --> 01:32:18,159
School teacher!

1248
01:32:19,001 --> 01:32:22,277
I'm Vice President of
Rockledge Corporation, and he...

1249
01:32:22,681 --> 01:32:24,876
A for Apple, B for Ball...

1250
01:32:25,041 --> 01:32:26,190
D for Donkey

1251
01:32:26,881 --> 01:32:31,636
Next week I sign a huge deal
with Phunsukh Wangdu

1252
01:32:31,801 --> 01:32:34,713
And he... A for Apple, B for Ball...

1253
01:32:38,281 --> 01:32:40,590
Today my respect
for that idiot shot up

1254
01:32:41,481 --> 01:32:43,711
Most of us went to college
just for a degree

1255
01:32:44,281 --> 01:32:48,320
No degree meant
no plum job, no pretty wife...

1256
01:32:48,601 --> 01:32:51,069
no credit card, no social status

1257
01:32:51,721 --> 01:32:53,473
None of this mattered to him

1258
01:32:53,601 --> 01:32:55,353
He was in college
for the joy of learning

1259
01:32:55,841 --> 01:32:58,992
He never cared
if he was first or last

1260
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:01,791
Who was the first man
on the Moon?

1261
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:03,190
Neil Armstrong, sir

1262
01:33:03,281 --> 01:33:05,351
Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong.
We all know it

1263
01:33:05,521 --> 01:33:06,715
Who was the second?

1264
01:33:07,201 --> 01:33:08,759
Don't waste your time.
It's not important

1265
01:33:09,201 --> 01:33:11,590
Nobody remembers the man
who ever came second

1266
01:33:12,681 --> 01:33:17,914
Soon, 26 companies
will be here with job offers

1267
01:33:18,361 --> 01:33:23,799
You'll have a job
even before your final exam

1268
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:26,318
This is your last lap, my friends

1269
01:33:26,641 --> 01:33:28,757
Put the pedal to the metal.
Step on the gas

1270
01:33:28,841 --> 01:33:30,752
Go out there and make history!

1271
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,190
Any questions?

1272
01:33:37,641 --> 01:33:38,517
Yes?

1273
01:33:39,801 --> 01:33:43,271
Sir, suppose a student gets a job...

1274
01:33:43,641 --> 01:33:50,638
but narrowly fails the final exam,
will he still have the job?

1275
01:33:51,121 --> 01:33:52,395
Very good question

1276
01:33:55,521 --> 01:33:57,796
Anyone else
with the same question?

1277
01:33:59,641 --> 01:34:00,915
As expected

1278
01:34:03,161 --> 01:34:06,153
Please come on stage.
Give them a big hand

1279
01:34:16,881 --> 01:34:19,076
For the last four years

1280
01:34:19,121 --> 01:34:21,954
they've been our most
consistent students

1281
01:34:22,081 --> 01:34:25,278
Consistently last in every exam

1282
01:34:26,081 --> 01:34:27,400
Come my geniuses, come

1283
01:34:28,801 --> 01:34:34,194
Their brains will fetch
a handsome price

1284
01:34:34,881 --> 01:34:37,793
'Cause they're completely unused

1285
01:34:40,201 --> 01:34:41,395
And to answer their question -

1286
01:34:41,761 --> 01:34:44,958
The exam won't affect their jobs

1287
01:34:45,721 --> 01:34:49,111
Because no company
will hire them anyway!

1288
01:34:49,921 --> 01:34:52,833
They're so unique, their
names will be writ in gold -

1289
01:34:53,121 --> 01:34:55,919
'Farhanitrate' and 'Prerajulization'

1290
01:34:56,001 --> 01:34:57,434
Give them a big hand,
please, everybody

1291
01:35:06,161 --> 01:35:10,837
He screwed us!

1292
01:35:10,961 --> 01:35:12,838
In front of everyone

1293
01:35:13,921 --> 01:35:18,836
God, I'll give up meat,
light a 1000 incense sticks

1294
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:20,639
Do me just one favor -

1295
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:23,076
Delete Virus!

1296
01:35:24,641 --> 01:35:26,552
Burn him in hell

1297
01:35:27,881 --> 01:35:31,556
Fry Virus-nuggets in bubbling oil

1298
01:35:32,281 --> 01:35:35,034
You think God is a contract killer?

1299
01:35:35,641 --> 01:35:36,869
You shut up

1300
01:35:37,561 --> 01:35:40,359
You're in the center
of the photo every year

1301
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,278
We're rotting in the corner

1302
01:35:43,281 --> 01:35:46,193
This year we may fall
out of the photo altogether

1303
01:35:48,561 --> 01:35:50,313
Know why I come first?
- Why?

1304
01:35:50,721 --> 01:35:52,359
Because I love machines

1305
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:54,873
Engineering is my passion

1306
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:57,075
Know your passion?

1307
01:35:59,801 --> 01:36:01,439
That's my bag
- Be quiet

1308
01:36:02,361 --> 01:36:03,635
What're you up to?

1309
01:36:05,961 --> 01:36:08,031
This... is your passion

1310
01:36:09,201 --> 01:36:10,600
Go post this letter

1311
01:36:10,961 --> 01:36:12,189
What letter?

1312
01:36:14,841 --> 01:36:18,959
5 years ago he wrote this for
his favorite wildlife photographer

1313
01:36:19,681 --> 01:36:22,354
Andre...
- Istvan

1314
01:36:23,281 --> 01:36:26,751
He wanted to train with him
in Hungary

1315
01:36:27,641 --> 01:36:30,838
But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer,
never posted it

1316
01:36:32,481 --> 01:36:35,917
Quit Engineering, marry Photography

1317
01:36:36,841 --> 01:36:38,752
Follow your talent

1318
01:36:41,761 --> 01:36:45,640
If Michael Jackson's dad
forced him to be a boxer...

1319
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:49,791
and Mohammad Ali's dad
pushed him to be a singer...

1320
01:36:50,481 --> 01:36:51,755
imagine the disaster

1321
01:36:53,721 --> 01:36:56,155
Do you get it?

1322
01:36:59,561 --> 01:37:02,758
Idiot! Loves Photography,
but is marrying machines

1323
01:37:07,201 --> 01:37:08,554
Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

1324
01:37:09,801 --> 01:37:13,794
Engineering is
my wife and mistress both

1325
01:37:15,161 --> 01:37:17,595
But I still fail. Why?
- Explain

1326
01:37:18,681 --> 01:37:20,956
'Cause you're a coward,
scared of the future

1327
01:37:22,601 --> 01:37:26,913
Look at this -
more holy rings than fingers

1328
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:30,513
One ring per fear -
exam, sis's dowry, job

1329
01:37:31,921 --> 01:37:35,550
With such fear of tomorrow,
how'll you live today?

1330
01:37:36,361 --> 01:37:37,953
How'll you focus on studies?

1331
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:42,193
Strange buddies! One lives
in fear, the other in pretense

1332
01:37:43,161 --> 01:37:48,315
You live in both - fear and pretense

1333
01:37:48,521 --> 01:37:54,357
You're scared to tell Pia you
love her... so you pretend you don't

1334
01:37:56,761 --> 01:37:58,752
What rubbish!

1335
01:37:59,361 --> 01:38:03,274
Easy to offer free advice,
tough to follow it

1336
01:38:03,361 --> 01:38:06,478
Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.

1337
01:38:06,921 --> 01:38:10,630
There's no connection!
- Deep connection, Your Holiness

1338
01:38:10,721 --> 01:38:16,000
Listen, if you confess to Pia

1339
01:38:16,401 --> 01:38:20,679
I'll tell Dad - No Engineering,
I'm marrying Photography

1340
01:38:21,801 --> 01:38:25,316
And I'll dump my rings
before the job interview

1341
01:38:25,721 --> 01:38:26,756
Deal?

1342
01:38:28,881 --> 01:38:30,473
Have the guts?

1343
01:38:30,601 --> 01:38:32,796
His Holiness is speechless

1344
01:38:38,601 --> 01:38:39,431
Let's go

1345
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:45,555
Follow me
- Where?

1346
01:38:50,961 --> 01:38:52,440
Let's go

1347
01:38:52,921 --> 01:38:55,921
Hey Virus! I'm anti-Virus

1348
01:38:55,921 --> 01:38:57,561
Hope no dog here

1349
01:38:57,561 --> 01:38:59,791
Cowards! Let's go

1350
01:38:59,921 --> 01:39:03,470
If any danger,
I'll give the Virus alert

1351
01:39:15,201 --> 01:39:16,759
Beware - Virus inside

1352
01:39:36,521 --> 01:39:37,670
Need background score?

1353
01:39:37,881 --> 01:39:38,836
Pia
- Who's it?

1354
01:39:41,481 --> 01:39:45,030
Don't yell! It's me, Rancho

1355
01:39:46,881 --> 01:39:50,157
Just listen for a moment,
then I'm gone

1356
01:39:50,441 --> 01:39:52,750
Say not a word...

1357
01:39:53,081 --> 01:39:54,036
Pia...
- Yes?

1358
01:39:56,081 --> 01:39:59,278
Those 22 minutes with you
on the scooter

1359
01:40:00,081 --> 01:40:04,472
were the most enchanting
22 minutes of my life

1360
01:40:08,721 --> 01:40:13,920
I could spend an eternity
with you on the scooter

1361
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:14,871
Wow

1362
01:40:16,081 --> 01:40:19,073
...and time stands still

1363
01:40:20,081 --> 01:40:27,192
Every night you ride into my dreams
on your scooter, dressed as a bride

1364
01:40:30,081 --> 01:40:32,311
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

1365
01:40:35,641 --> 01:40:38,474
and come close to kiss me

1366
01:40:41,441 --> 01:40:43,636
But that kiss doesn't happen

1367
01:40:44,441 --> 01:40:45,317
Why?

1368
01:40:45,641 --> 01:40:48,678
Because the noses collide,
and I wake up

1369
01:40:49,721 --> 01:40:51,313
The noses never collide, stupid!

1370
01:40:56,201 --> 01:40:59,193
I'm sorry,
I thought you were Pia

1371
01:40:59,761 --> 01:41:00,671
I wish I was

1372
01:41:00,961 --> 01:41:02,679
Sis, why did you interrupt?

1373
01:41:03,121 --> 01:41:04,873
It took him four years
to say this

1374
01:41:05,081 --> 01:41:07,993
Pia, kiss him.
Show that noses don't collide

1375
01:41:08,081 --> 01:41:11,198
You have my permission,
kiss him... He's so cute!

1376
01:41:11,721 --> 01:41:13,313
Who's this?
- My sister

1377
01:41:14,281 --> 01:41:15,270
Who're you?

1378
01:41:24,561 --> 01:41:28,156
When you were talking,
he kicked. First time!

1379
01:41:28,201 --> 01:41:31,876
He? How do you know
it's a 'he' or 'she'?

1380
01:41:32,161 --> 01:41:36,040
Papa asked the astrologer If we'd
get an engineer or a doctor

1381
01:41:36,961 --> 01:41:37,837
Meaning?

1382
01:41:38,001 --> 01:41:40,754
Boy becomes an engineer,
girl a doctor

1383
01:41:41,521 --> 01:41:46,800
Champ, better stay inside.
Out here's a circus

1384
01:41:47,841 --> 01:41:51,436
Your grandpa is the ringmaster.
He'll crack his whip -

1385
01:41:51,561 --> 01:41:56,760
'Run! Life is a race.
Be an engineer'

1386
01:41:57,561 --> 01:42:02,589
But you follow your heart.
If grandpa scares you...

1387
01:42:03,361 --> 01:42:06,592
put your hand on your heart
and say, 'All is well'

1388
01:42:07,441 --> 01:42:08,191
He kicked

1389
01:42:10,121 --> 01:42:11,156
Say it again

1390
01:42:12,321 --> 01:42:13,879
All is well

1391
01:42:14,721 --> 01:42:16,359
Kicked again

1392
01:42:17,921 --> 01:42:20,799
Once more
- All is well

1393
01:42:25,121 --> 01:42:29,114
All is well

1394
01:42:29,681 --> 01:42:30,591
Who is it?

1395
01:42:31,401 --> 01:42:32,356
Go

1396
01:42:33,001 --> 01:42:37,836
You sent hate-mail to Dad,
here's pee-mail for you

1397
01:42:37,921 --> 01:42:42,199
Enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading!

1398
01:42:48,401 --> 01:42:51,040
Who is it?
- Your future son-in-law

1399
01:42:51,281 --> 01:42:52,714
And the wedding party

1400
01:42:53,521 --> 01:42:54,556
Rastogi!

1401
01:42:56,881 --> 01:42:58,633
Security, that way

1402
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:30,636
So you all have already learned
about the simple pendulum

1403
01:43:31,321 --> 01:43:35,075
Now let's get down to the advanced
study about compound pendulum

1404
01:43:36,441 --> 01:43:40,275
It's an irregular object
oscillating about its own axis

1405
01:43:40,681 --> 01:43:41,716
Let me demonstrate to you

1406
01:43:42,281 --> 01:43:44,158
What's this?
- Pencil

1407
01:43:44,441 --> 01:43:45,840
What's inside?
- Lead

1408
01:43:45,881 --> 01:43:47,951
Good. Lead is the axis to this pencil

1409
01:43:48,441 --> 01:43:51,319
Even you can be a compound
pendulum, if you oscillate about...

1410
01:43:58,641 --> 01:44:01,155
Where is Raju Rastogi?
- Present, sir

1411
01:44:08,321 --> 01:44:10,152
Hi. Everybody is here

1412
01:44:11,761 --> 01:44:12,796
Good morning, sir

1413
01:44:13,681 --> 01:44:14,830
Where were you last night?

1414
01:44:15,361 --> 01:44:18,319
Studying all night, sir
- Studying?

1415
01:44:18,481 --> 01:44:19,391
Really?

1416
01:44:19,521 --> 01:44:22,399
Hasn't slept two nights,
that's why he looks scruffy

1417
01:44:22,481 --> 01:44:23,357
Not slept?

1418
01:44:23,521 --> 01:44:24,510
What did you study?

1419
01:44:25,561 --> 01:44:29,440
Induction motor, sir.
The whole chapter

1420
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:30,597
Whole chapter?

1421
01:44:30,801 --> 01:44:32,757
In that case, Mr. Ra ju Rastogi...

1422
01:44:32,841 --> 01:44:33,717
Yessir!

1423
01:44:33,841 --> 01:44:36,401
Can you tell us how an
induction motor starts?

1424
01:44:44,161 --> 01:44:45,037
Stop it

1425
01:44:52,401 --> 01:44:54,596
Sir, rum

1426
01:44:56,401 --> 01:44:57,390
Mr. Rastogi

1427
01:44:57,841 --> 01:45:00,116
Let's have a cup of tea
in my office

1428
01:45:05,961 --> 01:45:06,871
Sir?

1429
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:08,877
Close the door

1430
01:45:13,921 --> 01:45:14,956
Can you type?

1431
01:45:16,201 --> 01:45:17,031
Yes, sir

1432
01:45:17,201 --> 01:45:18,634
Will you type a letter for me?

1433
01:45:20,641 --> 01:45:21,676
Definitely, sir

1434
01:45:21,961 --> 01:45:22,871
Come, sit

1435
01:45:23,601 --> 01:45:24,590
Sir, I'm sorry sir...

1436
01:45:26,881 --> 01:45:27,791
Please type

1437
01:45:29,401 --> 01:45:30,197
Dear Sir...

1438
01:45:31,121 --> 01:45:34,397
It is my painful duty to inform you...

1439
01:45:35,641 --> 01:45:38,201
that your son is rusticated...

1440
01:45:38,961 --> 01:45:41,429
No, sorry, delete that.
Go back

1441
01:45:42,121 --> 01:45:46,034
Your son, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1442
01:45:47,081 --> 01:45:51,074
is rusticated from the
Imperial College of Engineering

1443
01:45:51,641 --> 01:45:52,994
Come on, type

1444
01:46:00,161 --> 01:46:01,799
It'll kill my dad, sir

1445
01:46:01,961 --> 01:46:03,679
Please type
- Sir, please sir

1446
01:46:04,121 --> 01:46:07,909
My decision is final and
irrevocable

1447
01:46:09,881 --> 01:46:14,830
He lives just to see me
become an engineer

1448
01:46:14,881 --> 01:46:18,999
Should've thought of that
before peeing on my door

1449
01:46:19,121 --> 01:46:23,399
Sir, give me one chance... please

1450
01:46:28,761 --> 01:46:32,037
Ok, remove your name
from the letter...

1451
01:46:33,321 --> 01:46:35,391
and put in Rancho's

1452
01:46:36,761 --> 01:46:38,877
I know he was with you
last night

1453
01:46:39,681 --> 01:46:43,594
Be my witness and
I'll spare you

1454
01:46:47,001 --> 01:46:50,880
You have 71/2 minutes to think

1455
01:47:36,081 --> 01:47:40,836
We won't let go of you

1456
01:47:42,201 --> 01:47:47,480
We're not done yet... no way

1457
01:47:49,521 --> 01:47:52,593
The heavens may beckon you

1458
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:55,753
But we'll taKe up arms against God

1459
01:47:55,801 --> 01:48:01,637
And it's not a fight we intend to lose

1460
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:05,153
You may try your best to escape

1461
01:48:05,281 --> 01:48:08,353
Try with all your might

1462
01:48:08,521 --> 01:48:14,869
But there is no way
we are letting go of you

1463
01:48:15,441 --> 01:48:21,277
We won't let go of you

1464
01:48:21,721 --> 01:48:27,751
We're not done yet... no way

1465
01:48:29,521 --> 01:48:32,160
Rancho, watch that monitor

1466
01:48:32,441 --> 01:48:33,191
Raju

1467
01:48:34,921 --> 01:48:37,958
His body is paralyzed with shock,
but his mind is alert

1468
01:48:38,441 --> 01:48:42,593
He can see and hear us.
Please don't cry in front of him

1469
01:48:44,361 --> 01:48:48,593
Speak to him normally,
motivate him, joke around

1470
01:48:51,481 --> 01:48:54,041
Good news, Raju.
Your dad's recovered

1471
01:48:54,201 --> 01:48:55,554
The new medicine worked

1472
01:48:55,961 --> 01:48:58,680
Is this your family tradition -

1473
01:48:59,441 --> 01:49:02,681
As one male gets up,
the other conks out?

1474
01:49:02,681 --> 01:49:04,273
Come, wake up

1475
01:49:05,121 --> 01:49:06,474
Your dad wants Pia's scooter

1476
01:49:06,601 --> 01:49:10,276
Should I give it to him?
Hope he won't dent it

1477
01:49:16,041 --> 01:49:20,193
Raju, Farhan is live on webcam.
From the hostel

1478
01:49:22,361 --> 01:49:25,080
Look, Virus has canceled
your suspension order

1479
01:49:25,401 --> 01:49:27,551
Problem solved... Wake up now

1480
01:49:27,841 --> 01:49:30,480
Everything's resolved!
You hear that?

1481
01:49:30,841 --> 01:49:33,560
Rise and shine, buddy

1482
01:49:35,081 --> 01:49:38,153
In this journey of few strides

1483
01:49:38,361 --> 01:49:41,194
On the path called life

1484
01:49:41,401 --> 01:49:46,998
Don't quit...
Just celebrate the ride

1485
01:49:47,761 --> 01:49:50,798
Listen please to those
who love you

1486
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:53,833
Every darK night is
followed by sunrise

1487
01:49:54,161 --> 01:49:59,189
Don't shut out those
who love you

1488
01:49:59,401 --> 01:50:05,636
We won't let go of you

1489
01:50:05,761 --> 01:50:11,836
We're not done yet... no way

1490
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:18,196
We won't let go of you

1491
01:50:18,321 --> 01:50:25,591
We're not done yet... no way

1492
01:50:28,801 --> 01:50:32,510
Look, mom bought a new saree
- Brand new

1493
01:50:32,641 --> 01:50:34,199
It cost 2000/-

1494
01:50:34,841 --> 01:50:36,035
Wake up now

1495
01:50:37,161 --> 01:50:39,197
She bought not one,
but ten sarees

1496
01:50:39,641 --> 01:50:40,517
Look!

1497
01:50:42,521 --> 01:50:43,590
Hey Raju!

1498
01:50:43,641 --> 01:50:46,553
C'mon tell me... How do I look?

1499
01:50:47,601 --> 01:50:50,559
Remember the letters
mom would write...

1500
01:50:50,681 --> 01:50:53,673
Always blessed you
with eternal life

1501
01:50:53,841 --> 01:50:59,711
Don't die on her... you can 't die

1502
01:51:00,081 --> 01:51:03,153
Look at us now, don't turn away

1503
01:51:03,281 --> 01:51:06,273
Smile once to show you care

1504
01:51:06,441 --> 01:51:14,678
WaKe up,
don't torment us anymore

1505
01:51:18,561 --> 01:51:22,554
Did you hear about your sis?

1506
01:51:23,441 --> 01:51:26,035
She's getting married

1507
01:51:27,001 --> 01:51:28,275
Without any dowry

1508
01:51:28,921 --> 01:51:33,631
The bridegroom wants
nothing at all

1509
01:51:33,841 --> 01:51:37,197
He just wants Kammo

1510
01:51:37,801 --> 01:51:41,794
You know who the bridegroom is?
- Yeah

1511
01:51:41,841 --> 01:51:42,671
Guess!

1512
01:51:42,721 --> 01:51:44,552
You know him very well
- Yes

1513
01:51:44,721 --> 01:51:46,313
He loves animals
- Huh?

1514
01:51:46,481 --> 01:51:49,041
He's going to be a
wildlife photographer

1515
01:51:49,121 --> 01:51:50,634
Quiet... Shhhh...

1516
01:51:50,721 --> 01:51:53,758
Didn't get it? It's our Farhan

1517
01:51:54,681 --> 01:51:58,640
Farhan will never take any dowry

1518
01:51:59,201 --> 01:52:03,433
Farhan will marry your sister

1519
01:52:03,841 --> 01:52:07,834
For free! Free! Free!

1520
01:52:12,241 --> 01:52:14,550
Raju

1521
01:52:17,561 --> 01:52:21,190
One Kilo oKra, 500 grams cheese
for 'free' would've woken him

1522
01:52:21,561 --> 01:52:23,199
Why sacrifice me...!

1523
01:52:23,481 --> 01:52:25,392
Well done, buddy

1524
01:52:26,161 --> 01:52:29,551
So it's all fixed -
Farhan will marry your sister

1525
01:52:30,601 --> 01:52:31,556
Rancho

1526
01:52:34,081 --> 01:52:37,118
Rascals... Stop fibbing

1527
01:52:39,601 --> 01:52:40,590
Lucky escape!

1528
01:52:40,761 --> 01:52:46,916
We won't let go of you

1529
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:53,196
We're not done yet... no way

1530
01:52:53,401 --> 01:52:59,510
We won't let go of you

1531
01:52:59,681 --> 01:53:05,438
We're not done yet... no way

1532
01:53:05,481 --> 01:53:11,716
We won 't let go of you

1533
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:13,713
'Okra Rs.12/ kilo'

1534
01:53:22,641 --> 01:53:24,154
You called for a taxi?

1535
01:53:24,201 --> 01:53:25,919
I did
- It's waiting

1536
01:53:26,041 --> 01:53:27,474
Thank you. Why?

1537
01:53:27,881 --> 01:53:29,155
I'm going to the job interview

1538
01:53:29,401 --> 01:53:30,595
You coming with me?

1539
01:53:30,961 --> 01:53:35,398
No. I'm going for the interview.
You're going home

1540
01:53:35,521 --> 01:53:36,840
Why would I go home?

1541
01:53:38,281 --> 01:53:41,591
Remember, we promised
this rascal

1542
01:53:44,801 --> 01:53:46,792
Give me your tie

1543
01:53:48,281 --> 01:53:49,111
Why?

1544
01:53:49,321 --> 01:53:53,075
I doubt you'll go for the
interview after reading this

1545
01:53:53,961 --> 01:53:54,837
What's that?

1546
01:53:55,001 --> 01:53:57,754
A letter
- For you, from Hungary

1547
01:53:58,081 --> 01:54:00,595
Some photographer
called Andre Istvan

1548
01:54:08,201 --> 01:54:09,919
You posted my letter!

1549
01:54:10,081 --> 01:54:11,719
He loved your pictures

1550
01:54:12,161 --> 01:54:14,721
The guy wants you to assist him...

1551
01:54:15,481 --> 01:54:18,871
in the Brazilian rain forest,
for a year

1552
01:54:19,201 --> 01:54:20,759
Will pay you, too

1553
01:54:36,041 --> 01:54:37,269
Dad will never agree

1554
01:54:39,761 --> 01:54:42,321
Go speak to him...
from your heart

1555
01:54:43,921 --> 01:54:45,036
For once, dump your fears...

1556
01:54:45,681 --> 01:54:51,472
or someday, on your deathbed,
you'll regret it

1557
01:54:51,961 --> 01:54:54,429
You'll remember that the letter was
in your hand, taxi at the gate...

1558
01:54:54,561 --> 01:54:58,190
With just a little courage, you
could've turned your life around

1559
01:55:04,481 --> 01:55:06,358
Do you think he'll like it?

1560
01:55:06,961 --> 01:55:09,191
Why such an expensive gift?

1561
01:55:10,281 --> 01:55:12,636
Our son's getting
his first job today

1562
01:55:13,881 --> 01:55:17,635
Don't be stingy at
such a proud moment

1563
01:55:19,481 --> 01:55:20,436
Farhan?

1564
01:55:25,321 --> 01:55:27,516
Don't you have
the job interview today?

1565
01:55:29,201 --> 01:55:30,077
I didn't go

1566
01:55:32,721 --> 01:55:34,393
I don't want to be
an engineer, Dad

1567
01:55:38,441 --> 01:55:40,318
What happened?
You had an accident?

1568
01:55:43,801 --> 01:55:48,829
See that building?
I jumped from its third floor

1569
01:55:51,521 --> 01:55:52,397
Why?

1570
01:55:52,721 --> 01:55:54,951
Because I was rusticated
from college

1571
01:55:57,761 --> 01:55:58,557
Why?

1572
01:55:59,041 --> 01:56:03,671
Drunk, I urinated
on the Director's door

1573
01:56:05,881 --> 01:56:09,396
That scoundrel Rancho
is messing with your mind!

1574
01:56:09,521 --> 01:56:13,116
I don't enjoy Engineering.
I'd make a terrible engineer

1575
01:56:15,161 --> 01:56:19,598
Rancho has a simple belief -
Make your passion your profession

1576
01:56:19,921 --> 01:56:21,434
Then work will become play

1577
01:56:21,561 --> 01:56:23,392
What'll you earn in that jungle?

1578
01:56:24,001 --> 01:56:27,516
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot

1579
01:56:27,561 --> 01:56:28,710
Five years from now...

1580
01:56:29,401 --> 01:56:33,952
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes, you'll curse yourself

1581
01:56:34,041 --> 01:56:37,875
Life as an engineer will bring
only frustration. Then I'll curse you

1582
01:56:39,841 --> 01:56:41,559
I'd rather curse myself, Dad

1583
01:56:41,681 --> 01:56:42,830
The world will laugh!

1584
01:56:44,041 --> 01:56:45,952
Label you a loser,
for quitting in the final year

1585
01:56:46,801 --> 01:56:52,273
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate
to be at ICE. What'll he think?

1586
01:56:52,521 --> 01:56:54,591
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me
with an air-conditioner

1587
01:56:57,281 --> 01:56:59,476
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept
in discomfort while I slept well

1588
01:57:01,721 --> 01:57:04,599
He didn't take me around the zoo
on his shoulders

1589
01:57:07,321 --> 01:57:08,515
You did all that, Dad

1590
01:57:10,881 --> 01:57:16,114
How you feel, matters to me.
Mr. Kapoor makes no difference

1591
01:57:17,201 --> 01:57:19,032
I don't even know his first name

1592
01:57:19,161 --> 01:57:21,959
You think you're the hero
of a melodrama?

1593
01:57:22,121 --> 01:57:24,760
Enough, please... he's upset

1594
01:57:25,961 --> 01:57:28,316
God forbid, if he did
something crazy like Raju...

1595
01:57:28,521 --> 01:57:30,034
Then the discussion is over

1596
01:57:30,321 --> 01:57:33,950
Don't say a word or
His Lordship will jump off the roof

1597
01:57:37,281 --> 01:57:42,071
No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide.
I promise

1598
01:57:44,481 --> 01:57:51,193
The Rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet

1599
01:57:52,721 --> 01:57:56,396
Told me to see it if a suicidal thought
crossed my mind

1600
01:57:56,521 --> 01:57:59,672
and imagine what'd happen
to your smiles

1601
01:57:59,721 --> 01:58:01,439
when you see my dead body

1602
01:58:06,761 --> 01:58:10,390
I want to convince you, Dad

1603
01:58:11,801 --> 01:58:14,156
but not with a suicide threat

1604
01:58:17,761 --> 01:58:21,436
Dad, what'll happen
if I become a photographer?

1605
01:58:21,721 --> 01:58:22,915
I'll earn less

1606
01:58:23,801 --> 01:58:25,439
I'll have a smaller house,
a smaller car

1607
01:58:27,401 --> 01:58:28,880
But I'll be happy

1608
01:58:30,481 --> 01:58:31,709
I will be really happy

1609
01:58:32,961 --> 01:58:34,553
Whatever I do for you
will be out of genuine love

1610
01:58:36,401 --> 01:58:38,073
I've always listened to you

1611
01:58:38,441 --> 01:58:41,433
For once,
let me listen to my heart

1612
01:58:43,441 --> 01:58:44,317
Please... Dad

1613
01:58:50,481 --> 01:58:51,391
Dad...

1614
01:58:52,561 --> 01:58:53,755
Please don't go away...

1615
01:58:59,721 --> 01:59:00,870
Return this

1616
01:59:04,201 --> 01:59:06,590
Son, what's the cost
of a professional camera?

1617
01:59:07,801 --> 01:59:09,519
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1618
01:59:10,921 --> 01:59:12,718
If you need more money, just ask

1619
01:59:21,161 --> 01:59:23,038
Go live your life, my son

1620
01:59:25,841 --> 01:59:29,959
Your grades are consistently poor.
Reason?

1621
01:59:30,601 --> 01:59:31,431
Fear

1622
01:59:32,481 --> 01:59:33,834
I was a good student
since childhood

1623
01:59:34,561 --> 01:59:36,631
Parents hoped
I'd end their poverty

1624
01:59:38,481 --> 01:59:39,436
That scared me

1625
01:59:40,881 --> 01:59:44,191
Here I saw the mad race.
You don't count if you're not first

1626
01:59:45,881 --> 01:59:46,870
My fear grew

1627
01:59:48,481 --> 01:59:49,880
Fear is not good for grades, sir

1628
01:59:50,481 --> 01:59:52,790
I slipped on more
charms and rings

1629
01:59:53,761 --> 01:59:58,039
Prayed to God for favors.
No... begged for favors

1630
02:00:01,001 --> 02:00:03,993
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect

1631
02:00:04,521 --> 02:00:05,715
Finally, sense dawned

1632
02:00:07,161 --> 02:00:12,110
Today I didn't beg God for this job,
just thanked him for this life

1633
02:00:14,481 --> 02:00:18,315
If you reject me, no regrets

1634
02:00:18,641 --> 02:00:22,600
I'll still do something
worthwhile with my life

1635
02:00:23,121 --> 02:00:28,115
Such frank behavior
is not good for our firm

1636
02:00:28,681 --> 02:00:32,799
We need someone diplomatic
to handle clients

1637
02:00:32,881 --> 02:00:35,156
You're too straightforward

1638
02:00:36,961 --> 02:00:37,757
But...

1639
02:00:38,881 --> 02:00:45,070
if you assure us
you'll control this attitude

1640
02:00:45,201 --> 02:00:48,079
we may consider you

1641
02:00:51,281 --> 02:00:54,318
It took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet

1642
02:00:56,121 --> 02:00:57,873
Wasn't easy to get this attitude

1643
02:00:58,561 --> 02:00:59,391
Can't change it, sir

1644
02:01:02,921 --> 02:01:07,949
You keep your job...
I'll keep my attitude

1645
02:01:08,081 --> 02:01:09,400
I'm sorry, no offense, sir

1646
02:01:13,601 --> 02:01:14,431
Wait

1647
02:01:16,321 --> 02:01:20,155
I've interviewed countless
candidates for 25 years

1648
02:01:20,561 --> 02:01:23,314
Everyone turns into
a yes-man to get the job

1649
02:01:23,481 --> 02:01:24,800
Where did you spring from, son?

1650
02:01:26,641 --> 02:01:27,437
Sir?

1651
02:01:27,681 --> 02:01:30,195
Shall we discuss the salary?

1652
02:01:37,441 --> 02:01:38,317
Thank you, sir

1653
02:02:09,561 --> 02:02:13,600
Your Majesty, thou art great

1654
02:02:15,441 --> 02:02:17,033
Accept this humble offering

1655
02:02:52,161 --> 02:02:55,471
Govind!

1656
02:02:57,441 --> 02:03:00,797
You had said, 'lf he gets a job,
shave it off'

1657
02:03:07,721 --> 02:03:08,710
What have you done?

1658
02:03:12,161 --> 02:03:15,437
I feel naked without
my moustache

1659
02:03:17,641 --> 02:03:19,472
I've lost my dignity

1660
02:03:21,481 --> 02:03:23,836
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi

1661
02:03:25,081 --> 02:03:28,960
The job isn't yours until you
pass your final exam

1662
02:03:30,361 --> 02:03:34,149
And this time,
I will set the question paper

1663
02:03:37,201 --> 02:03:39,715
Dad, that's not fair

1664
02:03:41,961 --> 02:03:45,351
Everything is fair in
Love and War

1665
02:03:45,841 --> 02:03:49,038
And this is World War... Ill

1666
02:03:50,441 --> 02:03:51,430
Rastogi, you're dead meat!

1667
02:03:56,201 --> 02:03:57,077
Hey

1668
02:03:59,401 --> 02:04:00,277
What're you doing here?

1669
02:04:03,121 --> 02:04:03,951
Be careful

1670
02:04:09,401 --> 02:04:13,110
You've been drinking
- Yup, had to down a couple

1671
02:04:13,641 --> 02:04:15,757
A couple too many!

1672
02:04:15,841 --> 02:04:17,672
Needed the guts
- For what?

1673
02:04:19,361 --> 02:04:20,840
For stealing this
- What's this?

1674
02:04:21,881 --> 02:04:25,874
The duplicate key to
Virus's office

1675
02:04:28,281 --> 02:04:30,511
The question paper's
in a cover with a red seal

1676
02:04:31,161 --> 02:04:34,995
Dad has set it, to fail Raju

1677
02:04:35,281 --> 02:04:36,191
Go get it!

1678
02:04:37,201 --> 02:04:39,669
Are you mad or what -
that's cheating!

1679
02:04:43,961 --> 02:04:47,078
Everything's fair in
Love and War

1680
02:04:48,521 --> 02:04:49,510
Tell me something...

1681
02:04:51,361 --> 02:04:52,510
Do you really feel...

1682
02:04:54,001 --> 02:04:59,314
the noses collide while kissing?

1683
02:05:04,521 --> 02:05:08,116
Wait. Have some dhokla

1684
02:05:10,481 --> 02:05:12,995
You Gujaratis are so cute

1685
02:05:13,881 --> 02:05:17,078
But why does your food
sound so dangerous?

1686
02:05:18,121 --> 02:05:23,149
Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa,
Thepla, Khakhra

1687
02:05:24,201 --> 02:05:26,271
Sound like missiles

1688
02:05:26,321 --> 02:05:27,151
C'mon

1689
02:05:27,361 --> 02:05:29,750
'Today Bush dropped
two Dhoklas on Iraq'

1690
02:05:30,361 --> 02:05:33,114
'400 dead, 200 injured'

1691
02:05:33,441 --> 02:05:34,317
C'mon

1692
02:05:37,641 --> 02:05:38,596
Oh...

1693
02:05:40,041 --> 02:05:44,319
I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda.
But your name...

1694
02:05:45,201 --> 02:05:48,398
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad' - Yuck

1695
02:05:49,561 --> 02:05:52,029
I won't change my last name
after marriage

1696
02:05:53,801 --> 02:05:56,679
Pia, we can't get married

1697
02:06:00,081 --> 02:06:00,957
Why?

1698
02:06:01,761 --> 02:06:03,160
Is there someone else?

1699
02:06:05,561 --> 02:06:06,391
No

1700
02:06:06,681 --> 02:06:08,353
Are you gay?
- No

1701
02:06:10,121 --> 02:06:11,952
Then why don't you
propose to me?

1702
02:06:16,321 --> 02:06:17,720
Are you impotent?
- No

1703
02:06:20,281 --> 02:06:22,033
Then prove it

1704
02:06:22,481 --> 02:06:23,391
Pia, no

1705
02:06:23,641 --> 02:06:25,040
Stop, stop!

1706
02:06:25,201 --> 02:06:27,476
What happened?
- We didn't inform Pia

1707
02:06:27,921 --> 02:06:29,912
Stop here,
my bladders are bursting

1708
02:06:29,961 --> 02:06:31,758
Shut up!
- Are you in touch with her?

1709
02:06:32,041 --> 02:06:35,078
No... I have her home number
Then call her, I'll stop

1710
02:06:41,281 --> 02:06:42,077
Hello

1711
02:06:42,161 --> 02:06:44,311
No place for urine-expulsion
in this country

1712
02:06:44,361 --> 02:06:47,637
Hello, is Pia there?
- No, she's not

1713
02:06:48,001 --> 02:06:49,719
Is she at the hospital?

1714
02:06:49,841 --> 02:06:51,354
Why would she be there?

1715
02:06:51,561 --> 02:06:53,677
She's getting married today -
in Manali

1716
02:07:01,361 --> 02:07:02,555
Too late! She's married

1717
02:07:03,921 --> 02:07:06,719
Not yet. It's a six hour drive

1718
02:07:07,041 --> 02:07:09,032
If we rush, we'll reach
before the vows

1719
02:07:09,521 --> 02:07:10,351
What do you say?

1720
02:07:12,201 --> 02:07:14,556
It's a no-brainer. Let's turn back

1721
02:07:14,761 --> 02:07:16,433
No turning back

1722
02:07:16,881 --> 02:07:19,520
Straight to Ladakh.
We'll meet Rancho and return

1723
02:07:19,681 --> 02:07:22,149
I have a Friday meeting with
Phunsukh Wangdu

1724
02:07:22,281 --> 02:07:23,760
Get into the car

1725
02:07:23,961 --> 02:07:26,839
If I miss my meeting,
the Japanese will get him

1726
02:07:27,041 --> 02:07:29,999
They're offering him a
first name in the company

1727
02:07:30,121 --> 02:07:32,316
'Phunsukh and Fujiyashi',
profit sharing...

1728
02:08:04,601 --> 02:08:06,671
Pia weds Suhas!
- Thanks for the suit

1729
02:08:08,921 --> 02:08:10,354
Virus will have a heart attack

1730
02:08:11,401 --> 02:08:13,995
At every daughter's wedding,
we're there to rock the party

1731
02:08:15,361 --> 02:08:18,637
Listen, I'll update Pia,
you peel off the price tag

1732
02:08:34,761 --> 02:08:36,911
Farhan
- We found Rancho

1733
02:08:44,721 --> 02:08:46,279
For Room 107?
- Yes, sir

1734
02:08:46,961 --> 02:08:49,680
You've taken ages
- Sorry, sir

1735
02:08:49,801 --> 02:08:50,631
Off, now

1736
02:08:59,321 --> 02:09:00,959
Housekeeping, sir
- Come in

1737
02:09:01,481 --> 02:09:03,995
Amore... Amore...

1738
02:09:04,081 --> 02:09:05,400
Quick, iron my coat

1739
02:09:05,481 --> 02:09:08,200
Amore... Amore...

1740
02:09:09,041 --> 02:09:12,158
We found Rancho!
Now you can't marry this ass

1741
02:09:12,641 --> 02:09:13,676
You're mad, Farhan

1742
02:09:14,761 --> 02:09:17,321
Don't fool yourself, Pia.
You still love Rancho

1743
02:09:17,521 --> 02:09:19,398
You're still eating his favorite food

1744
02:09:19,681 --> 02:09:22,195
Amore... Amore...

1745
02:09:37,001 --> 02:09:41,040
He's incorrigible.
Once a price tag, always a price tag

1746
02:09:41,121 --> 02:09:43,874
Shut up, Farhan.
Suhas is a changed man

1747
02:09:44,401 --> 02:09:46,312
He doesn't speak of
brands and prices anymore

1748
02:09:46,361 --> 02:09:49,433
My 150,000/ - coat

1749
02:09:49,521 --> 02:09:51,557
Why do you people eat sauce?

1750
02:09:51,601 --> 02:09:53,990
I'll sort it out, sir
- How?

1751
02:09:54,081 --> 02:09:56,549
Our laundry specializes in
cleaning mint-stained suits

1752
02:09:56,681 --> 02:09:58,592
I'll clean it in a jiffy

1753
02:10:03,681 --> 02:10:04,955
Get it soon

1754
02:10:05,881 --> 02:10:08,031
But it's too late now, Farhan
- Pia

1755
02:10:08,881 --> 02:10:11,031
Let's go, Pia, we're late

1756
02:10:22,001 --> 02:10:25,198
Pia, it's me... Raju.
Don't yell, they'll kill me

1757
02:10:30,161 --> 02:10:31,037
Where is Suhas?

1758
02:10:31,081 --> 02:10:33,720
Housekeeping took my coat

1759
02:10:34,161 --> 02:10:35,879
Go... Send Suhas here

1760
02:10:36,081 --> 02:10:39,153
It's rude to leave the ceremony

1761
02:10:50,001 --> 02:10:51,593
Yeah, Farhan?
- The car's ready

1762
02:10:51,921 --> 02:10:54,435
Grab her hand and run.
Don't move

1763
02:10:55,881 --> 02:10:57,439
Sir...
- My coat?

1764
02:10:57,481 --> 02:10:58,601
You're here...

1765
02:10:58,601 --> 02:11:00,319
So who's at the altar?
- Altar?

1766
02:11:02,521 --> 02:11:04,910
Another couple of rounds,
and we'll be considered married

1767
02:11:05,081 --> 02:11:07,276
I'm already married, Pia.
Let's go

1768
02:11:07,721 --> 02:11:10,872
It's too late.
People will laugh at me

1769
02:11:11,121 --> 02:11:12,839
So you'll commit suicide?

1770
02:11:13,401 --> 02:11:14,277
Rastogi!

1771
02:11:14,361 --> 02:11:16,397
People will gossip briefly,
then forget

1772
02:11:17,721 --> 02:11:20,681
But you... you'll regret
on your deathbed

1773
02:11:20,681 --> 02:11:23,514
that the car was at the gate,
Rancho within reach...

1774
02:11:23,681 --> 02:11:27,037
but in fear of people,
you married this ass

1775
02:11:29,121 --> 02:11:30,031
Housekeeping?

1776
02:12:08,161 --> 02:12:11,073
Pia, minor problem

1777
02:12:11,361 --> 02:12:12,191
What?

1778
02:12:12,601 --> 02:12:14,159
We don't know if Rancho's married

1779
02:12:14,201 --> 02:12:15,031
What!

1780
02:12:15,121 --> 02:12:17,681
He won't be married
- And if he is?

1781
02:12:18,521 --> 02:12:19,874
Then we'll drop you back

1782
02:12:20,721 --> 02:12:24,350
Relax! Handmade biscuit?

1783
02:12:28,041 --> 02:12:28,871
What's he doing here?

1784
02:12:29,881 --> 02:12:33,157
Ignore him
- The biscuit's very good

1785
02:12:34,161 --> 02:12:35,958
Till yesterday,
I was a law-abiding citizen

1786
02:12:36,441 --> 02:12:40,150
But in the last 24 hours,
I'd grounded an aircraft

1787
02:12:40,921 --> 02:12:43,276
almost assigned Shamaldas's
ashes to the sewers, and

1788
02:12:43,521 --> 02:12:47,753
made a bride elope from her
own wedding! All for Rancho

1789
02:12:49,161 --> 02:12:51,197
But he too would do
anything for friends

1790
02:12:51,441 --> 02:12:54,797
Like stealing the question paper...
from the lion's den

1791
02:12:54,881 --> 02:12:55,870
Envelope with the red seal

1792
02:12:56,841 --> 02:13:01,631
He feared that if Raju failed,
there'd be another high jump

1793
02:13:04,681 --> 02:13:09,755
We were principled thieves,
stealing the paper only for Raju

1794
02:13:10,121 --> 02:13:11,190
We'd sworn we won't even
taKe a peek

1795
02:13:13,801 --> 02:13:15,075
Where's it hidden...

1796
02:13:15,201 --> 02:13:18,716
We'll grow old searching!
Ask Pia

1797
02:13:24,681 --> 02:13:25,796
Pia, your phone

1798
02:13:27,001 --> 02:13:30,118
Mr. Papa-To-Be!
If you say 'All is well', he kicks

1799
02:13:30,201 --> 02:13:30,997
He kicked

1800
02:13:33,361 --> 02:13:34,794
Pia, your phone

1801
02:13:40,401 --> 02:13:41,595
Found it! Rancho

1802
02:13:43,001 --> 02:13:43,956
Hello?

1803
02:14:01,641 --> 02:14:03,791
Quick, photocopy this

1804
02:14:24,121 --> 02:14:24,871
Where was it?

1805
02:14:25,161 --> 02:14:26,116
Put it back

1806
02:14:48,521 --> 02:14:50,477
We're safe!
- Where were you?

1807
02:14:54,881 --> 02:14:56,519
Here
- What's this?

1808
02:14:56,841 --> 02:14:57,717
A gift

1809
02:14:58,801 --> 02:15:02,555
Question paper.
Virus set it himself, to fail you

1810
02:15:09,841 --> 02:15:11,115
Strange buddies!

1811
02:15:12,401 --> 02:15:16,792
First teach you to be upright,
then offer a path to shame

1812
02:15:18,761 --> 02:15:19,750
No way

1813
02:15:21,281 --> 02:15:22,600
If I pass,
it'll be on my own steam

1814
02:15:26,321 --> 02:15:27,436
If I don't, it's still ok

1815
02:15:43,961 --> 02:15:48,318
He'd won us over!
I felt like embracing him as family...

1816
02:15:49,201 --> 02:15:51,032
but then I controlled my emotions

1817
02:16:09,361 --> 02:16:12,194
Damn thief
- Sir, please, sir

1818
02:16:12,361 --> 02:16:15,433
Rascal
- Sorry sir

1819
02:16:15,961 --> 02:16:17,189
Wanted to change the system

1820
02:16:18,841 --> 02:16:23,596
You'll pee on my door
- Sir, what're you doing

1821
02:16:25,041 --> 02:16:25,996
Sorry sir

1822
02:16:27,401 --> 02:16:29,198
You are rusticated!

1823
02:16:29,961 --> 02:16:32,839
If all of you aren't out by morning,
I'll call the police

1824
02:16:33,201 --> 02:16:34,520
I will call the police!

1825
02:16:36,921 --> 02:16:37,717
Rascals!

1826
02:16:38,041 --> 02:16:39,315
Rascals, all of you

1827
02:16:43,161 --> 02:16:45,391
How did he get my office key?

1828
02:16:46,641 --> 02:16:47,994
I gave him the key, Dad

1829
02:16:49,321 --> 02:16:52,961
I wish I'd given this key to
my brother... He'd be alive today

1830
02:16:52,961 --> 02:16:53,837
Stop it, Pia

1831
02:16:54,921 --> 02:16:57,640
You think your son
fell off a train and died?

1832
02:16:58,161 --> 02:16:59,037
Shut up, Pia

1833
02:16:59,121 --> 02:17:01,316
You decided he'd be an engineer

1834
02:17:01,481 --> 02:17:03,676
Did you ever ask him
what he wanted to be?

1835
02:17:04,441 --> 02:17:05,954
You put such pressure on him...

1836
02:17:06,321 --> 02:17:08,516
that he chose death
over the entrance exam

1837
02:17:12,601 --> 02:17:13,431
I don't understand...

1838
02:17:14,201 --> 02:17:16,669
Dad, you go to your room

1839
02:17:20,401 --> 02:17:22,676
Pia, don't do this

1840
02:17:25,041 --> 02:17:28,795
He wanted to study Literature,
be a writer

1841
02:17:30,961 --> 02:17:33,350
But all he wrote was
this suicide note

1842
02:17:33,401 --> 02:17:34,629
Put that away, please

1843
02:17:34,801 --> 02:17:36,393
No more cover-ups!

1844
02:17:39,641 --> 02:17:42,758
Just once...

1845
02:17:42,801 --> 02:17:46,350
if you'd said - Don't do Engineering
if you don't want to

1846
02:17:47,161 --> 02:17:48,514
just do what your heart is in

1847
02:17:49,921 --> 02:17:51,593
then he'd be alive today

1848
02:17:59,201 --> 02:18:01,192
He didn't commit suicide

1849
02:18:01,881 --> 02:18:02,836
You're right, Dad

1850
02:18:04,321 --> 02:18:05,515
It wasn't suicide...

1851
02:18:07,881 --> 02:18:08,916
It was murder

1852
02:18:24,201 --> 02:18:26,954
Many city roads are
completely submerged

1853
02:18:27,001 --> 02:18:28,912
Traffic has come to a standstill

1854
02:18:42,281 --> 02:18:45,956
Dad...

1855
02:18:47,001 --> 02:18:47,911
Mona?

1856
02:18:51,921 --> 02:18:54,310
Go back, Millimeter.
Why're you following us?

1857
02:18:54,841 --> 02:18:57,036
Why?
Your pop owns the road?

1858
02:18:57,161 --> 02:18:58,799
Please help,
we are desperate here!

1859
02:18:59,721 --> 02:19:01,518
You can't send an ambulance?

1860
02:19:02,481 --> 02:19:04,312
Get it from another hospital

1861
02:19:04,921 --> 02:19:08,311
The entire city's flooded, sir.
We're helpless

1862
02:19:11,681 --> 02:19:12,909
Mona, you ok?

1863
02:19:13,441 --> 02:19:14,396
Rancho, Pia

1864
02:19:16,681 --> 02:19:20,390
Rancho, you can't reach here.
Do as I say

1865
02:19:20,681 --> 02:19:25,357
The water bag has burst

1866
02:19:26,321 --> 02:19:28,755
Disconnected! Mona

1867
02:19:33,761 --> 02:19:34,716
Mona!

1868
02:19:38,921 --> 02:19:40,400
Turn on the lights
- Where to?

1869
02:19:40,881 --> 02:19:44,669
To the table tennis table
- Pia, we're in the common room

1870
02:19:48,481 --> 02:19:50,278
Raju, turn on the web camera

1871
02:19:56,161 --> 02:19:57,276
Where's Mona? Show me

1872
02:19:58,761 --> 02:19:59,671
Hold on

1873
02:20:01,801 --> 02:20:02,631
Here, Pia

1874
02:20:02,921 --> 02:20:05,719
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you

1875
02:20:05,801 --> 02:20:06,756
Pia, I'm dying!

1876
02:20:07,121 --> 02:20:09,635
Rancho, even when
there were no hospitals or docs

1877
02:20:09,761 --> 02:20:11,114
babies were delivered

1878
02:20:11,681 --> 02:20:13,911
You all will deliver this baby

1879
02:20:16,481 --> 02:20:17,994
All is well

1880
02:20:18,121 --> 02:20:20,999
How dare you? I'll kill you

1881
02:20:21,121 --> 02:20:23,077
Dad, stay out of this

1882
02:20:24,001 --> 02:20:26,071
Farhan, get towels and scissors

1883
02:20:26,121 --> 02:20:28,510
Millimeter, get clothes clips
and hot water

1884
02:20:28,761 --> 02:20:30,194
Rancho, cover Mona

1885
02:20:37,441 --> 02:20:38,920
Mona, try pushing

1886
02:20:39,321 --> 02:20:43,109
Push with all your might

1887
02:20:43,361 --> 02:20:45,670
Stop it! I can't do it

1888
02:20:45,881 --> 02:20:47,633
Rancho, check if there's crowning

1889
02:20:48,521 --> 02:20:49,351
Crowning?

1890
02:20:50,641 --> 02:20:51,517
Get that diagram

1891
02:20:54,321 --> 02:20:56,960
See if the head is coming out

1892
02:20:59,201 --> 02:21:00,475
Check quickly

1893
02:21:01,201 --> 02:21:02,111
Go!

1894
02:21:02,761 --> 02:21:05,150
Go, Rancho, go

1895
02:21:12,121 --> 02:21:14,157
No crowning

1896
02:21:14,201 --> 02:21:16,032
Mona, please push

1897
02:21:18,601 --> 02:21:19,431
Mona!

1898
02:21:22,321 --> 02:21:23,436
She's tired, Pia

1899
02:21:23,841 --> 02:21:27,390
Wake her! If she won't push,
it's a big problem

1900
02:21:27,721 --> 02:21:31,350
They need a vacuum cup
- Where will they get one?

1901
02:21:31,521 --> 02:21:34,274
What's a vacuum cup?
How is it used?

1902
02:21:34,521 --> 02:21:35,351
I'll show you

1903
02:21:38,481 --> 02:21:42,633
If the mother's too fatigued to push,
a cup is placed on baby's head

1904
02:21:42,921 --> 02:21:46,550
Suction makes the cup
stick to the head...

1905
02:21:47,201 --> 02:21:49,032
and the baby is pulled out

1906
02:21:49,481 --> 02:21:51,597
I can make this
- How?

1907
02:21:51,841 --> 02:21:53,593
With a vacuum cleaner
- Vacuum cleaner?

1908
02:21:53,641 --> 02:21:54,676
Yes

1909
02:21:54,721 --> 02:21:56,996
That pressure's too high

1910
02:21:57,041 --> 02:21:59,111
I'll control it
- D'you have a vacuum cleaner?

1911
02:21:59,161 --> 02:22:00,196
Yes, in my office

1912
02:22:00,601 --> 02:22:03,195
Farhan, rush and get it
- Here's the key

1913
02:22:08,961 --> 02:22:12,271
Mona, push

1914
02:22:13,001 --> 02:22:14,480
Oh my God

1915
02:22:15,321 --> 02:22:16,197
What happened?

1916
02:22:20,881 --> 02:22:23,076
Raju, what happened?
- The power's gone

1917
02:22:24,001 --> 02:22:25,400
How'll the vacuum work now?

1918
02:22:25,441 --> 02:22:27,909
Farhan, you get the vacuum,
I'll get the power.

1919
02:22:27,961 --> 02:22:28,916
How?

1920
02:22:29,561 --> 02:22:30,994
Millimeter, get Virus out

1921
02:22:32,321 --> 02:22:34,881
What nonsense is this!

1922
02:22:35,081 --> 02:22:38,517
Not this Virus.
My Virus, the inverter

1923
02:22:38,681 --> 02:22:40,512
Get that, quick
- Ok

1924
02:22:40,761 --> 02:22:42,831
Raju, wake up the hostel

1925
02:22:43,001 --> 02:22:45,834
Get car batteries, wires,
and a vacuum gauge

1926
02:22:48,561 --> 02:22:51,121
Emergency in the common room!

1927
02:23:20,681 --> 02:23:22,717
Where's Rancho?
- Here, sir

1928
02:23:22,961 --> 02:23:25,555
Keep the batteries here
...and the wires

1929
02:23:27,721 --> 02:23:30,793
Raju, switch off everything,
connect the inverter to the mains

1930
02:23:35,401 --> 02:23:36,550
Rancho, vacuum cleaner

1931
02:23:37,641 --> 02:23:40,439
Farhan, get your lens cleaner

1932
02:23:40,481 --> 02:23:41,880
Blower?
- Yeah, get it

1933
02:23:44,481 --> 02:23:45,470
Rancho, blower

1934
02:23:45,601 --> 02:23:47,557
Good. Fix this to the gauge

1935
02:24:12,881 --> 02:24:14,109
Rancho, I'm done

1936
02:24:16,441 --> 02:24:17,556
All switches off?
- Yes

1937
02:24:19,041 --> 02:24:20,599
Hit the table
and computer switches

1938
02:24:20,641 --> 02:24:21,471
Ok

1939
02:24:33,641 --> 02:24:34,710
Raju, turn on the computer

1940
02:24:35,081 --> 02:24:36,719
Farhan, here

1941
02:24:38,721 --> 02:24:40,677
Pia, come here quick

1942
02:24:43,041 --> 02:24:44,110
Love you, Rancho

1943
02:24:44,841 --> 02:24:46,752
Farhan, turn it on
- Ok

1944
02:24:53,041 --> 02:24:54,997
Pia, how much suction?

1945
02:24:55,361 --> 02:24:56,760
Not more than 0.5

1946
02:24:56,961 --> 02:24:58,917
Farhan, 0.5
- Cover it

1947
02:25:00,401 --> 02:25:01,277
0.5

1948
02:25:03,721 --> 02:25:07,600
Vacuum cleaner baby!
Mother of all deliveries

1949
02:25:08,641 --> 02:25:09,437
Farhan, stop

1950
02:25:09,481 --> 02:25:10,277
Ok

1951
02:25:16,521 --> 02:25:17,715
Raju, get on the table

1952
02:25:17,961 --> 02:25:20,998
Push the baby down, like this

1953
02:25:21,161 --> 02:25:22,071
Ok

1954
02:25:23,121 --> 02:25:23,997
Farhan, turn it on

1955
02:25:28,401 --> 02:25:30,631
C'mon, you can do it

1956
02:25:31,721 --> 02:25:34,076
C'mon, push

1957
02:25:38,081 --> 02:25:40,549
Do it for Champ

1958
02:25:40,761 --> 02:25:43,116
C'mon, Mona

1959
02:25:44,761 --> 02:25:46,752
He's coming out!

1960
02:25:48,041 --> 02:25:49,759
You can do it

1961
02:25:50,521 --> 02:25:52,796
Yes Mona, push

1962
02:26:00,321 --> 02:26:01,356
Farhan, turn it off

1963
02:26:01,441 --> 02:26:02,430
Ok, off

1964
02:26:21,881 --> 02:26:23,599
Two clips,
cut the umbilical cord

1965
02:26:23,881 --> 02:26:25,997
Farhan, two clips on the cord

1966
02:26:26,681 --> 02:26:28,637
Get scissors
- Be careful

1967
02:26:29,801 --> 02:26:31,996
Cut at the center,
get a towel

1968
02:26:34,681 --> 02:26:36,911
Pia, he's not crying

1969
02:26:41,001 --> 02:26:43,799
Hey Champ!

1970
02:26:45,081 --> 02:26:47,436
Rancho, rub his back

1971
02:26:49,601 --> 02:26:51,557
Hey Champ
- Come on, Champ

1972
02:26:53,321 --> 02:26:55,357
No, nothing

1973
02:26:55,801 --> 02:26:56,790
Blow air into his mouth

1974
02:27:03,681 --> 02:27:04,477
C'mon, Champ

1975
02:27:09,801 --> 02:27:10,631
No response

1976
02:27:34,001 --> 02:27:37,471
Hush Mona, say -
All is well

1977
02:27:42,521 --> 02:27:43,431
He kicked

1978
02:27:44,681 --> 02:27:45,511
What?

1979
02:27:46,361 --> 02:27:47,589
He kicked

1980
02:27:50,921 --> 02:27:52,195
Say - All is well

1981
02:27:53,081 --> 02:28:00,396
All is well

1982
02:28:40,161 --> 02:28:43,392
If Virus had said, 'My grandson
will be an engineer'

1983
02:28:43,521 --> 02:28:45,318
I would've broken his jaw

1984
02:28:45,961 --> 02:28:48,680
But when he finally spoKe,
he stunned us

1985
02:28:48,961 --> 02:28:51,998
What a kick!
Wanna be a footballer?

1986
02:28:53,001 --> 02:28:55,913
Be what you want to be

1987
02:29:11,721 --> 02:29:15,475
Wait - I've not finished with you!

1988
02:29:17,761 --> 02:29:20,195
First day of college,
you'd asked me a question...

1989
02:29:20,561 --> 02:29:22,870
Why didn't astronauts
use a pencil in space?

1990
02:29:23,601 --> 02:29:25,796
If a pencil tip breaks

1991
02:29:25,961 --> 02:29:31,638
it'd float in zero gravity.
Get into eyes, nose, instruments...

1992
02:29:31,761 --> 02:29:33,638
You were wrong

1993
02:29:35,161 --> 02:29:36,958
You cannot be right all the time

1994
02:29:38,961 --> 02:29:39,950
You understand?

1995
02:29:42,281 --> 02:29:43,111
Yes, sir

1996
02:29:44,321 --> 02:29:46,357
This was an important invention

1997
02:29:47,601 --> 02:29:48,590
You understand?

1998
02:29:49,921 --> 02:29:50,751
Yes, sir

1999
02:29:53,121 --> 02:30:02,029
My Director said, 'When you find
an extraordinary student... '

2000
02:30:19,361 --> 02:30:23,639
Go, study!
Pass your exams and leave

2001
02:30:32,161 --> 02:30:34,197
And now, Student of the Year...

2002
02:30:34,401 --> 02:30:36,790
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad

2003
02:30:53,721 --> 02:30:54,995
Sir, one photo

2004
02:31:11,761 --> 02:31:15,071
I wanted to capture all these
memories and taKe them home

2005
02:31:17,041 --> 02:31:22,195
That day, we hugged,
we rejoiced, we cried...

2006
02:31:22,481 --> 02:31:24,073
We vowed that we'd meet
at least once a year...

2007
02:31:24,721 --> 02:31:28,031
Who knew then, we were seeing
Rancho for the last time

2008
02:32:00,601 --> 02:32:01,511
Untie him

2009
02:32:04,721 --> 02:32:06,552
I'll sue you all in an
American court

2010
02:32:20,441 --> 02:32:21,271
Raju

2011
02:32:39,521 --> 02:32:41,432
Only Rancho can create
a school like this

2012
02:32:41,961 --> 02:32:42,996
But where is he?

2013
02:32:47,281 --> 02:32:48,475
Don't pee here

2014
02:32:49,521 --> 02:32:51,079
Go away creatures

2015
02:32:51,441 --> 02:32:54,399
Don't pee here
- I'll smack you

2016
02:33:11,441 --> 02:33:13,557
Bingo! He cannot be far

2017
02:33:24,561 --> 02:33:26,756
Excuse me,
where is Ranchhoddas?

2018
02:33:26,881 --> 02:33:28,792
He's not Ranchhoddas!
- Rancho...

2019
02:33:28,881 --> 02:33:30,997
Chhote... Dammit,
what's his name?

2020
02:33:31,121 --> 02:33:33,715
Calm down. Come with me

2021
02:33:36,081 --> 02:33:36,957
Where's he?
- Rancho

2022
02:33:44,041 --> 02:33:47,078
Farhan, he's read all your books

2023
02:33:53,121 --> 02:33:58,912
Raju, he reads your blog everyday.
Proudly shares it with the kids

2024
02:34:02,281 --> 02:34:05,637
Remember your helmet, Pia?
It was stolen...

2025
02:34:07,481 --> 02:34:10,553
Who are you?
How do you know us?

2026
02:34:10,801 --> 02:34:12,792
Didn't you recognize me?
- No

2027
02:34:13,681 --> 02:34:17,515
How would you?
Millimeter is now Centimeter

2028
02:34:22,361 --> 02:34:26,673
Not Centimeter, you're Kilometer

2029
02:34:27,481 --> 02:34:28,436
How did you get here?

2030
02:34:28,521 --> 02:34:31,638
I got a letter with
a train ticket inside

2031
02:34:31,881 --> 02:34:35,476
It said - 'Miss being in school?
Catch this train'... I did

2032
02:34:37,001 --> 02:34:38,070
That rascal Rancho!

2033
02:34:42,081 --> 02:34:43,036
Where is that idiot?

2034
02:34:53,761 --> 02:34:55,592
Dorje, you fly it

2035
02:35:09,961 --> 02:35:15,194
Every night you ride into my dreams
on a scooter, dressed as a bride

2036
02:35:16,121 --> 02:35:18,316
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

2037
02:35:18,921 --> 02:35:21,560
and come close to kiss me

2038
02:35:25,001 --> 02:35:26,195
Couldn't you tell me
before leaving?

2039
02:35:28,441 --> 02:35:29,191
No

2040
02:35:30,961 --> 02:35:31,837
Sorry

2041
02:35:32,201 --> 02:35:32,997
Did you marry?

2042
02:35:33,561 --> 02:35:37,634
What? No

2043
02:35:38,561 --> 02:35:41,075
You?
- Almost... Idiot

2044
02:35:48,361 --> 02:35:49,191
So?

2045
02:35:50,601 --> 02:35:51,556
So what?

2046
02:35:52,041 --> 02:35:53,315
Do you love someone?

2047
02:35:57,561 --> 02:35:58,357
Yes

2048
02:36:04,161 --> 02:36:04,991
Who?

2049
02:36:06,201 --> 02:36:07,077
You

2050
02:36:31,761 --> 02:36:34,833
See, the noses don't collide,
stupid

2051
02:36:36,001 --> 02:36:36,797
That's right!

2052
02:36:37,041 --> 02:36:38,110
Rancho

2053
02:36:39,561 --> 02:36:40,391
Hi... Farhan!

2054
02:36:40,561 --> 02:36:42,597
Screw your 'Hi'

2055
02:36:43,001 --> 02:36:47,552
Hey, listen to me...
- No, you listen to me

2056
02:36:47,721 --> 02:36:49,916
I can explain everything

2057
02:36:50,961 --> 02:36:51,791
Hi... Raju!

2058
02:36:55,081 --> 02:36:56,230
How we hunted for you!

2059
02:36:56,441 --> 02:37:00,400
Didn't have a coin
for one phone call?

2060
02:37:02,361 --> 02:37:04,556
Add a couple from me too

2061
02:37:05,081 --> 02:37:10,075
Rascal, scoundrel
- Let him go now

2062
02:37:10,201 --> 02:37:11,111
Ok ok, enough

2063
02:37:12,401 --> 02:37:14,119
On your feet, c'mon

2064
02:37:42,921 --> 02:37:44,593
Having fun, idiots?

2065
02:37:44,841 --> 02:37:46,638
Hey... Hi Chatur

2066
02:37:46,921 --> 02:37:51,790
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
How do you do, Mr. Teacher?

2067
02:37:52,201 --> 02:37:58,720
Wow, you're a teacher in a village -
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2068
02:38:00,561 --> 02:38:05,112
Our trains left together.
But yours traveled in reverse...

2069
02:38:05,641 --> 02:38:08,439
from engineer to primary teacher

2070
02:38:10,521 --> 02:38:13,319
What's your salary, Chanchad?
5000/-?

2071
02:38:13,681 --> 02:38:15,399
For me that's $ 100

2072
02:38:15,801 --> 02:38:19,077
My son's pocket money is
more than your salary

2073
02:38:19,201 --> 02:38:21,920
Cut the crap
- Crap is what he gave us

2074
02:38:22,081 --> 02:38:26,950
Wanted to change the education
system, change the world

2075
02:38:27,161 --> 02:38:29,959
Finally what does he change?
Kids' diapers

2076
02:38:30,081 --> 02:38:31,434
You gonna break his jaw
or should I?

2077
02:38:31,601 --> 02:38:32,477
Just relax

2078
02:38:32,561 --> 02:38:39,080
Remember I'd said
one day you'd cry and I'd laugh?

2079
02:38:40,681 --> 02:38:47,200
Sign here.
Accept - You lost, I won!

2080
02:38:47,441 --> 02:38:50,353
'Declaration of Defeat'!
Unbelievable, man

2081
02:38:50,521 --> 02:38:52,512
Chatur
- Crazy guy

2082
02:38:54,201 --> 02:38:58,399
Hey, this is Virus's pen!
You pinched it?

2083
02:38:58,801 --> 02:39:00,154
Forget it, man

2084
02:39:00,801 --> 02:39:04,350
This is for winners, not losers

2085
02:39:05,401 --> 02:39:12,113
If your school ever needs help,
call my assistant for a donation

2086
02:39:14,161 --> 02:39:16,880
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2087
02:39:18,321 --> 02:39:20,994
He hasn't changed at all!
- Ignore him

2088
02:39:21,121 --> 02:39:22,554
He's full of crap

2089
02:39:22,881 --> 02:39:27,113
Good news is your name
isn't Ranchhoddas Chanchad

2090
02:39:27,481 --> 02:39:31,360
Imagine, after marriage,
I'm Pia Chanchad - Yuck!

2091
02:39:32,081 --> 02:39:33,514
By the way,
what is your real name?

2092
02:39:34,321 --> 02:39:35,197
Phunsukh Wangdu

2093
02:39:35,961 --> 02:39:36,837
Wangdu?

2094
02:39:37,001 --> 02:39:37,831
Pia Wangdu!

2095
02:39:38,481 --> 02:39:40,153
You mean you're a scientist?

2096
02:39:40,361 --> 02:39:41,635
You have 400 patents?

2097
02:39:41,761 --> 02:39:43,558
I won't change my name
after marriage

2098
02:39:43,601 --> 02:39:45,159
You mean you're Chatur's
Wangdu?

2099
02:39:45,201 --> 02:39:47,351
It's you the Japanese are wooing?

2100
02:39:47,401 --> 02:39:48,277
I don't like Wangdu

2101
02:39:48,841 --> 02:39:50,957
Are you a scientist
or a teacher?

2102
02:39:51,361 --> 02:39:53,192
Scientist,
but I also teach children

2103
02:39:53,281 --> 02:39:55,317
So you are
TH E Phunsukh Wangdu?

2104
02:39:55,361 --> 02:39:56,476
Yes, yes!

2105
02:39:57,681 --> 02:40:00,479
Hey Silencer
- Hey Chatur, come back

2106
02:40:01,681 --> 02:40:02,750
Take that

2107
02:40:04,201 --> 02:40:06,431
Wait, I'll stop him

2108
02:40:14,001 --> 02:40:17,471
Mr. Wangdu,
I can't believe it's you

2109
02:40:17,961 --> 02:40:19,155
I'm sorry, Mr. Chatur

2110
02:40:19,201 --> 02:40:21,476
I can't sign the deal
with your company

2111
02:40:21,961 --> 02:40:23,917
What sir? Why sir?

2112
02:40:24,121 --> 02:40:26,840
How do I sign, man?
You took my pen

2113
02:40:28,641 --> 02:40:30,552
What pen, sir?
I didn't get you...

2114
02:40:30,881 --> 02:40:34,920
The one in your hand -
Virus's pen

2115
02:40:38,281 --> 02:40:39,714
Mr. Wangdu?

2116
02:40:39,881 --> 02:40:41,030
Yes, Chatur?

2117
02:40:41,801 --> 02:40:43,712
A for Apple, B for Ball is...

2118
02:40:46,721 --> 02:40:48,313
...S for Screwed

2119
02:40:55,161 --> 02:40:59,120
You got me, Rancho -
I mean, Mr. Wangdu

2120
02:40:59,481 --> 02:41:01,039
Totally floored me. Good one

2121
02:41:01,681 --> 02:41:05,799
I hope our personal problems
won't affect this deal

2122
02:41:05,961 --> 02:41:09,033
Hey Chatur - take that

2123
02:41:09,641 --> 02:41:11,552
I was just joking, man

2124
02:41:11,921 --> 02:41:15,630
Deep down,
I knew you'd do great things

2125
02:41:16,601 --> 02:41:18,319
You're fibbing

2126
02:41:18,401 --> 02:41:20,278
No, really, I swear

2127
02:41:20,361 --> 02:41:22,272
Rancho - 100, Chatur - 0

2128
02:41:22,641 --> 02:41:24,871
You win, I lose.
You don't believe me?

2129
02:41:26,201 --> 02:41:27,554
Beware of farts

2130
02:41:27,601 --> 02:41:31,719
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

2131
02:41:31,801 --> 02:41:34,076
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu -
Run for your life!

2132
02:41:37,641 --> 02:41:41,554
Rancho, I'll lose my job, man.
I have small kids...

2133
02:41:42,481 --> 02:41:44,915
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas
had correctly stated

2134
02:41:45,121 --> 02:41:49,990
- Follow Excellence... Success
will chase you, pants down
