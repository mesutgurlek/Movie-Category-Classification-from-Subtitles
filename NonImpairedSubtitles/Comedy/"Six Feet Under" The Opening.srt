1
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:34,002
Claire, you're drooping.

2
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:36,932
- Higher.
- Really?

3
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:41,649
I wanna make them feel like
the crow's gonna peck their eyes out.

4
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:48,524
Good.

5
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:04,723
- $75? That's so low.
- I've never sold a piece in my life.

6
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:08,129
- I want someone to buy it.
- But it's not just a print.

7
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:12,603
- You got a good spot.
- Do you think?

8
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,690
- Have you seen mine?
- Where?

9
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,724
Exactly.

10
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,648
- Follow me into the annex.
- Cool pyramid.

11
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:34,691
This is weird. Does Olivier know
they put you here?

12
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:39,011
He said there are only four first years in
the show and some people would be grateful.

13
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:40,122
Nice.

14
00:04:41,893 --> 00:04:45,329
- 500?
- Is that disgusting?

15
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:50,606
The copper spray was so expensive, I had
to take a loan out to pay for the fucking thing.

16
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:54,043
It sucks. I'll buy dinner.

17
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,847
Hey, you people. I'm needing workers here.

18
00:04:57,893 --> 00:05:03,331
Can you untangle this mobile? It's by
some big alumni idiot and I got it all fucked up.

19
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:10,445
Olivier, do you think I should have priced
my photograph higher?

20
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:13,132
The price tag and the placement.
It's disgusting.

21
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:16,529
20 years old, you should wanna
give your work away.

22
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:21,169
Nobody in this country is born with a soul.
It has to be beaten into you.

23
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:27,929
There's another part that I ruined.
Lord knows where it goes.

24
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:34,884
Have you seen this?

25
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:38,252
I don't like that guy. He's too veiny.

26
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:40,284
Sarge was veiny.

27
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:44,082
Let's get the new Matt Summers.

28
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:51,168
- I don't know why we wouldn't tell Frank.
- There's nothing to say.

29
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:56,082
- It was just a fun thing we did.
- A fun thing we never did before.

30
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:59,125
So was the gospel brunch.
We didn't talk about that.

31
00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:03,007
- Do you wanna talk about that?
- No. Do you wanna talk about Sarge?

32
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:07,092
Not really. I just thought
it seemed like a therapy topic.

33
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:11,126
- I'd rather talk about the dishes thing.
- You're still angry about that.

34
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,164
David.

35
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:16,125
- Father Jack.
- Please call me Jack.

36
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:19,131
- How are you?
- Great. You?

37
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:21,971
- Just fine.
- This is due on Wednesday.

38
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:24,527
- What'd you rent?
- Something Keith picked.

39
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:31,847
- Sister Act. OK.
- Jack, have you met my boyfriend Keith?

40
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:37,206
- I don't think so.
- This is Father Jack from St Bartholomew.

41
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:39,448
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

42
00:06:39,493 --> 00:06:42,451
You still have Back To The Crack:
Butt Munch 2.

43
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:44,484
It was due last Friday.

44
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:49,244
Thank you.

45
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:57,567
Sorry, I can't. I cannot have
this conversation one more time.

46
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,642
- I can't give you what you want.
- Love?

47
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:06,811
I give you love, Lisa.
I fucking give you love every day.

48
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:09,048
There's just always some fucking thing.

49
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:12,642
Introducing Maya to some friend
before I introduced you. Who cares?

50
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:17,483
It happens all the time.
It's like I'm an afterthought. People notice.

51
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:20,411
I can't do any better than this.

52
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:25,322
Some women might be happy with a faithful,
committed, devoted father and husband.

53
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:29,571
- Father and husband.
- I just don't have anything else for you.

54
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:33,970
- What am I supposed to do with that?
- Nothing. I don't know.

55
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,164
This isn't right.

56
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:54,124
What isn't right?

57
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:58,283
This. Us.

58
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,291
- But I thought you loved me.
- I do.

59
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,642
- But not enough.
- It's enough for me.

60
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:06,526
- It's not, though.
- It's not enough for you.

61
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:09,451
I'm totally fucking fine with what we have.

62
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:12,166
You're not happy
but you have to make it about me.

63
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:14,408
That's what I can't live with any more.

64
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,331
- So what are you saying? You wanna leave?
- Leave?

65
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:21,286
I would have to leave because I moved
my whole life to this shithole city!

66
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,528
Not for me, you didn't!

67
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:27,929
So you wanna split up?

68
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:30,203
Maybe, yeah.

69
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:33,131
I don't know. Maybe.

70
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:07,084
Just a moment.

71
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,011
- Why, hello.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

72
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:19,442
Not at all. Please come in.

73
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:27,923
That last song was so beautiful.
Did you write it yourself?

74
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:32,683
- I did.
- It was just wonderful.

75
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:35,122
I'm so pleased that you liked it.

76
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:42,527
I thought I would call it Semiprecious.

77
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:47,601
- For your Aunt Pearl?
- In part, yes.

78
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:53,928
I don't know how you can get
such a beautiful sound from a computer.

79
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:55,725
It's unexpected.

80
00:09:56,773 --> 00:10:01,244
As a child, I played the violin,
but when I went to college, I...

81
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:07,243
I had a very cruel roommate who threw
the violin from our dormitory window.

82
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:12,686
It was hand-carved by my Uncle Gunther
before he died of polio.

83
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:21,172
I gave up playing the violin altogether
and left college to go to mortuary school.

84
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:27,765
It was there in the computer room that
I discovered another way to make music.

85
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:29,804
Oh, my.

86
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:40,210
I wonder if you're available tomorrow night
to come with me to this art opening.

87
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:45,125
It's a benefit show for Claire's school.

88
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:49,803
Apparently, some of these alumni
are quite well-known artists.

89
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:52,242
I'm afraid I don't know any of their names.

90
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:56,809
Claire's very excited. She's one of the few
students whose work has been selected.

91
00:10:56,853 --> 00:11:00,243
I think it's important for her that we all be there.

92
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:03,972
I would be honoured to go.

93
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:07,289
If you feel it would be appropriate.

94
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,485
Well, of course.
You're a member of our little family here.

95
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,922
Thank you.

96
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,612
That means so much to me.

97
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:21,249
The secret is the new three-in-one invention
called the fanny lifter.

98
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:25,172
Part one is a six-inch segment
used in the cardio sculpting.

99
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:27,204
Part two, an eight-inch section...

100
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,244
What are you doing?

101
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,725
- What's going on with dinner?
- Couldn't decide.

102
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:36,731
Why not? Who cares? Meatloaf is fine.

103
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:39,845
Then I have to go out for meat.

104
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:42,566
So we'll make some rice and beans.

105
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:47,243
- Kids had rice already for lunch.
- That's OK. It's one day.

106
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:51,682
I couldn't remember what we had last night.

107
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:54,122
We had burgers last night.

108
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:59,006
That's where the meat went.

109
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:08,212
- Are you taking the medication?
- Yes.

110
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:12,007
It's only been two weeks.
He said it takes up to a month sometimes.

111
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:14,044
For anything to happen at all?

112
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:17,881
I gained five pounds already,
so something's happening.

113
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:48,406
Her mom's pretty much crazy.
She couldn't deal with arranging the funeral.

114
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:51,881
I don't think Melinda
even told her we broke up.

115
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:57,212
Did Melinda leave any instructions
for what she wanted in terms of a service?

116
00:12:57,253 --> 00:13:02,611
No. She did leave me a note.

117
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,842
But it wasn't about her funeral.

118
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,411
I tried to end the relationship before,

119
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:16,047
but she always said she was going...

120
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:21,525
I never thought she was really going to do it.

121
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:27,572
But maybe, in some way, I did,

122
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:32,932
because I stayed for years
after I wanted to leave.

123
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:35,965
I finally moved out about two weeks ago.

124
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,924
And I thought she was OK.

125
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:43,164
She seemed really...

126
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:46,044
calm about it.

127
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:53,372
And then... it's like I keep waiting
to find out it's all this mistake.

128
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:55,722
It's not your fault.

129
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:57,764
This note.

130
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:00,964
It's so horrible.

131
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:03,049
You had to live your own life.

132
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:06,563
- Was she depressed?
- For years, yeah.

133
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,410
- What was she like?
- Rico.

134
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:11,172
It was like those tribes or whatever,

135
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:15,570
they think if you take their picture,
they'll lose their spirit.

136
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:21,364
It was like her spirit got stolen,

137
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:25,452
and all that was left was this body
that she didn't even want any more.

138
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:29,645
- Was she on medication at all?
- Everything, all of them.

139
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:32,924
Mostly it just made things worse.

140
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:37,330
Then she was on something
that was really working. I thought.

141
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:41,412
- What was it? Paxil?
- Paxil made her really jittery.

142
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:45,969
This was a combination of Zoloft
and something else.

143
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,724
She did seem better.

144
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:56,168
I'd have never left
if I didn't think she'd be all right.

145
00:14:57,973 --> 00:14:59,964
It's OK.

146
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:05,484
Mommy's OK.

147
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:15,808
I hear that when I rewash the dishes
after you've washed them,

148
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:22,372
it makes you feel like
I don't think you're good enough.

149
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:26,888
- Did David hear you correctly?
- Yes.

150
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:33,647
So I'm sorry and I'll try not to do it any more.

151
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:37,004
Thank you.

152
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:44,408
Has anything else come up
since our last session?

153
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:47,763
- Not really.
- David?

154
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:51,283
We did have three-way sex with a stranger.

155
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,531
I just wanna make sure Frank thinks
that's a healthy couple activity.

156
00:15:55,573 --> 00:15:59,043
How did it feel to you?

157
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:03,291
Fine. It was a lot more enjoyable
than the paintball.

158
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:08,007
- What do you think, though?
- Were you safe?

159
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:09,372
Of course.

160
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:14,612
There are certainly a variety of ways
that couples can enjoy their sexuality.

161
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:18,009
Then it's totally OK
to just have sex with whoever?

162
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:22,569
Generally, it's best when there's
an open negotiation between partners

163
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:25,810
as to what the rules are in these situations,

164
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:28,208
so that both people are comfortable.

165
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:34,085
Were you both comfortable
with what happened?

166
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:38,411
- Yes.
- We didn't exactly negotiate the rules.

167
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:41,286
It just sort of happened.

168
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,767
Is it something you might wanna do again?

169
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:46,805
It was very liberating

170
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:50,209
to be spontaneous and kind of wild together

171
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:54,849
instead of always being so careful
about everything.

172
00:16:57,973 --> 00:17:02,046
It was fun to be wild.

173
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:07,770
If this is something that you think
you might like to do again,

174
00:17:07,813 --> 00:17:12,364
then I suggest you take some time
to lay down some ground rules.

175
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:15,484
OK.

176
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:31,488
Do you need to borrow some blush? Those
peach tones you're wearing just don't pop.

177
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:36,571
That's OK. I don't need to pop tonight.

178
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:41,323
- Want some of these for your bag?
- I quit, remember?

179
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:46,367
- I didn't know you were still in that mode.
- That's the goal, to stay in the mode.

180
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:51,967
I'm just curious. What makes you think
that was such a problem for you?

181
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:55,528
- Being stoned all day and night?
- It was never like that.

182
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:59,771
- How would you know?
- I work with addicts. You're not an addict.

183
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:06,082
You went through a difficult break-up
and needed to act out, but that was just stress.

184
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:09,284
I'm not interested in discussing this with you.

185
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,052
You seemed very defensive
when I offered you a joint.

186
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:15,927
I would appreciate it
if you respected my choices.

187
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:18,168
If I thought that they were your choices

188
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:22,570
and not some 12-step Christian dogma,
I'd feel much better about it.

189
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:26,845
Whenever in my whole life have I ever wanted
to take on someone else's dogma?

190
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:33,332
- That is not a big problem of mine.
- But you do tend to overdramatise yourself.

191
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:37,605
I'm sorry, but I've known you for a long time.

192
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:40,611
Thanks for your support, Mom.

193
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:44,009
But I am sorry if you feel I've been insensitive.

194
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,884
Thank you.

195
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:55,289
- You guys ready? The car's double-parked.
- I just have to do one final coat.

196
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,724
- How you doing?
- OK.

197
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:09,369
I'm sick of being
so fucking conscious all the time.

198
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:15,806
It's like I'm this incredibly boring,
watered-down version of myself.

199
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,844
I know what you mean.

200
00:19:20,413 --> 00:19:25,123
- What piece have you got in this thing tonight?
- It's a new one. Might suck.

201
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:29,849
- That's all right, sweetie. It's for charity.
- I'm sure it doesn't suck.

202
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:33,727
That blouse might actually work
if you got rid of the bra.

203
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:37,766
That skirt might actually work
if you got rid of that ass.

204
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:44,207
- It's 7:15. Where's the baby-sitter?
- I'm sure she just hit traffic.

205
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,604
Oh, God.

206
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:10,212
- You don't have to come if you don't want to.
- I'm not going for you. I'm going for Claire.

207
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:13,245
- I have a relationship with her.
- I know.

208
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:16,523
I thought maybe we should talk some more.

209
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:18,564
Obviously.

210
00:20:19,573 --> 00:20:21,689
That's Kayla.

211
00:20:23,493 --> 00:20:25,882
Fuck it. I'll just be cold.

212
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:30,644
Come here, baby.

213
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:37,884
I'm pretty sure that's Jan Vanhoosen.

214
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:41,130
- Look, he's going straight to his own piece.
- Narcissist.

215
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:45,646
- Who'd ever buy that?
- MoMA.

216
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:52,324
- Let's go see if anyone's looking at my piece.
- Narcissist.

217
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:59,373
I just feel bad for it back here all by itself,

218
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:01,404
no one coming to see it.

219
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:06,130
Oh, my God. Someone bought it already?

220
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:10,006
Do you think it's a mistake?

221
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:13,329
Russell, it's a really beautiful piece.

222
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:18,491
Maybe that's why I got such a good spot.

223
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:26,452
Do you think somebody
actually thought I was somebody?

224
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,484
You are somebody.

225
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:36,442
It's pretty good, don't you think,
for a 19-year-old?

226
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:39,769
Yeah, I guess. Looks like art.

227
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,645
- It's dark.
- Really? I think it's kind of funny.

228
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:47,365
Funny?

229
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,933
It's so, "What's the point?"

230
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:53,692
Come on. It's like, "Life goes on."

231
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:57,726
I so totally don't get that,
and I know Claire a lot better than you do.

232
00:21:57,773 --> 00:22:01,322
- She has no sense of humour?
- She has a very dark vision.

233
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:05,412
I think you just have this one really old idea
about who she is.

234
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:07,762
Maybe, but it happens to be accurate.

235
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:11,168
- It's magnificent.
- It's great.

236
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:13,204
Thanks.

237
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:17,046
- It's so incredible.
- Awesome.

238
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:21,325
- God, you guys didn't all have to come.
- Why not? It's a big deal.

239
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,648
- It's so not.
- Is that Vigo Mortensen?

240
00:22:23,693 --> 00:22:26,002
- How did you get the plastered-out look?
- Who?

241
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,807
- It's infrared film.
- No, it says duratrans.

242
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:34,210
It's like this process they use
for ads in airports. It's really boring.

243
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:37,689
- No, it's not.
- I love that movie. I wept.

244
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:40,611
- I remember.
- Fiona Kleinschmidt.

245
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:43,486
She's got some pots in the next room.

246
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:46,969
Nate was deflowered
by a mildly famous ceramicist.

247
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:53,641
I don't think she's coming, though.
I heard she was in Japan.

248
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:57,442
Where'd you guys get the drinks?

249
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:02,769
I pumped so I could drink tonight,
because I wanna drink tonight.

250
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:05,281
- The bar's over there.
- Need anything?

251
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:15,372
So what happened to you? You were showing
everywhere and then nothing.

252
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:17,643
Did you get married or something?

253
00:23:17,693 --> 00:23:22,289
- I went crazy.
- What a drag. Where'd they put you?

254
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,325
- Clarendon.
- That place isn't too bad.

255
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:28,649
I had another student who used to go there.
Micky Herschel.

256
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:33,005
I think they had some of his feeling art
hanging in the cafeteria.

257
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:34,452
- How was it?
- Not bad.

258
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:37,087
- He had a breakthrough with me.
- Who doesn't?

259
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:39,931
- The repressed people.
- Right. Them.

260
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:44,404
Billy.

261
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:47,089
- How are you?
- Great. How are you?

262
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,124
I'm good.

263
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:52,723
You guys know each other?

264
00:23:52,773 --> 00:23:56,368
- Olivier visited for a term while I was here.
- He was my best student.

265
00:23:56,413 --> 00:24:01,441
After I cracked him open.
Before it was all too pretentious, right?

266
00:24:01,493 --> 00:24:05,088
- The first class I ever taught.
- You said you taught in Argentina.

267
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:09,843
I lied. There's Jani. I have to go pretend
I like his piece of shit.

268
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:14,762
Jani, it's so good to see you.

269
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:17,884
His best student?

270
00:24:19,373 --> 00:24:24,242
I don't know about that. I'm pretty sure
I was the only one sleeping with him.

271
00:24:24,293 --> 00:24:26,363
- Really?
- Yeah.

272
00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:29,564
It was a pretty amazing experience for me.

273
00:24:29,613 --> 00:24:33,049
I had a lot of static around my sexuality.

274
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:36,130
It was totally suffocating my work.

275
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:41,084
It was a sex thing, not a gay thing.

276
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:46,565
Wasn't that sort of a fucked-up
power dynamic, though?

277
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:50,128
There's always a fucked-up
power dynamic in sex, isn't there?

278
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:53,523
Not always.

279
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,324
How you doing?

280
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:06,364
Fine.

281
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:09,007
This dip tastes like vomit.

282
00:25:09,053 --> 00:25:11,044
Cheese is OK. Here.

283
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,764
It's all right, thanks.

284
00:25:16,533 --> 00:25:19,286
I don't want that, thanks.

285
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,528
- You eat it.
- I just had some.

286
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:23,962
So throw it out.

287
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:30,164
You don't want that.

288
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:34,412
- I don't?
- I'm told it tastes like vomit.

289
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:42,363
Brenda, this is my wife Lisa. Lisa, Brenda.

290
00:25:43,453 --> 00:25:45,409
Nice to meet you.

291
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:50,931
You too.

292
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,965
So what can I eat here?

293
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:31,086
Disturbing work always takes longer to sell.
Most people want something that's pretty.

294
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:36,526
- Like the cleaning supply installation?
- He was on the cover of Art Forum.

295
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:41,806
Olivier's right.
You can't give a fuck about what sells.

296
00:26:41,853 --> 00:26:46,688
- It's easy for you to say.
- Yeah, but that was just a fluke.

297
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:50,487
My mom probably called from Florida
to put a hold on it.

298
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:52,524
That's sweet.

299
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:57,883
If my mother buys mine, I'll kill myself.

300
00:26:57,933 --> 00:27:00,128
Any asshole can take a camera to a cemetery.

301
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:03,449
It's better than my lame self-portraits
from my first year.

302
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:05,484
That's true.

303
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:24,281
Baby, it's so nice in here.

304
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:39,769
Angie and her boyfriend
took the boys to Shaky's

305
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:42,202
and then to play Goofy Golf.

306
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:48,207
Baby, I can't drink on these pills.

307
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:51,684
I forgot.

308
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:55,885
- Even if they're not working yet?
- You're not supposed to.

309
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:57,924
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

310
00:28:33,453 --> 00:28:38,732
You know, if this medication isn't working,
you can try a different one.

311
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:41,651
I know. I'm a nurse.

312
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:46,926
I'm just saying, sometimes it takes a while
for you to find the right one.

313
00:28:46,973 --> 00:28:49,931
Baby, I know. I'm a nurse.

314
00:29:12,213 --> 00:29:14,204
Billy's?

315
00:29:17,013 --> 00:29:20,085
- It's really different for him, isn't it?
- Yeah.

316
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,124
I like it. I think.

317
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,806
It's very...

318
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:28,889
cool.

319
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,209
- And sort of painless.
- You haven't seen it before?

320
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:34,369
No.

321
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:37,052
He doesn't use me that way any more.

322
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:39,482
That sounds like an improvement.

323
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,204
It's my new thing.

324
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:52,132
I won't take care of anyone else
so I'll be forced to take care of myself.

325
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:54,209
Theoretically.

326
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:58,246
- How's that going for you?
- I'm still living with my mother.

327
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:01,683
- Who isn't?
- God, that's right. You too.

328
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,724
Temporarily.

329
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,964
We've really evolved.

330
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:21,642
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Come on in.

331
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:25,402
We're smoking some of my husband's
cancer pot.

332
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:27,967
It's incredible, and I got a ton of it.

333
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:32,042
Went a lot faster than anybody expected.

334
00:30:34,013 --> 00:30:36,447
Jani was just talking about that pyramid.

335
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:39,929
- You been in it yet?
- Too much of a line.

336
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:42,692
It's fantastic. Sensual.

337
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:46,248
- It's plastic.
- I thought I heard your voice.

338
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,843
I looked for you.

339
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:56,724
Are you ready to go out and get that drink?

340
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,764
In a minute.

341
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:03,126
You're smoking pot.

342
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:07,052
- You want some?
- It's California pharmaceutical grade.

343
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:11,921
- No, thanks.
- Oh, God, Bern.

344
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:18,007
- It's lovely, Claire.
- Lovely?

345
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:21,932
The way it looks.

346
00:31:21,973 --> 00:31:25,568
- Did you make the frame as well?
- No, I bought the frame.

347
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:29,526
- It was the perfect choice.
- Well done.

348
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:34,046
This must be your mother.

349
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:38,245
Mom, this is Olivier Castro-Staal,
my form-and-space teacher.

350
00:31:38,293 --> 00:31:41,365
- It's so nice to meet you.
- And you.

351
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:47,442
- This is my friend Arthur Martin.
- It is a pleasure and an honour.

352
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:51,362
I know you've had quite an effect on Claire.

353
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:54,052
Not as much as you have.

354
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:56,084
Thank you.

355
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:58,522
What do you think of her piece?

356
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:05,128
I think it's very sweet, really.

357
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,324
- It's supposed to be disturbing.
- It is.

358
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:11,046
Great art often provokes controversy.

359
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:15,962
And, if I may, I also feel
the image is quite tender.

360
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:19,767
It suggests the quiet dignity of eternal love.

361
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:28,085
Would anyone care for
a refreshment or an hors d'oeuvre?

362
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:30,931
No, thanks.

363
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:32,964
I'll come with you.

364
00:32:39,013 --> 00:32:42,005
- You think they're fucking?
- No.

365
00:32:54,253 --> 00:32:56,847
I'm sorry if that was weird before.

366
00:32:58,013 --> 00:33:00,447
It was a little confusing.

367
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:06,202
- I didn't tell Nate we'd met.
- But you did know who I was at the spa.

368
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:10,371
- No. I just figured it out.
- Just now?

369
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:16,604
Then why were you pretending
we'd never met?

370
00:33:16,653 --> 00:33:20,771
I don't know, I just didn't wanna
get into it with him.

371
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:25,722
I think you did know
who I was when you came in.

372
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:33,889
I'm sorry. I just wanted to know
what you were like.

373
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:39,284
That's weird and dishonest
and kind of stalkerish.

374
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:48,329
Getting a massage isn't the best way of finding
out what happened between Nate and me.

375
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:51,968
- He hasn't been very clear about it.
- Why does it matter?

376
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:56,204
I don't know.

377
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:01,332
I'm such a wreck right now.

378
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:11,522
He's pretty good at making people feel crazy.
Not that I wasn't.

379
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:16,442
I am too, I think.
I feel like I've totally lost my mind.

380
00:34:16,493 --> 00:34:21,521
What was I doing sneaking around like that?
It's so desperate.

381
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:25,328
It's not desperate.

382
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:29,889
It's just trying to get something you don't have.

383
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:32,686
- You mean Nate?
- You have Nate.

384
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,691
I think you'll have him for ever if you want him.

385
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:40,246
He doesn't love me the way he loved you.

386
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:44,052
He didn't love me.

387
00:34:44,093 --> 00:34:46,084
Not really.

388
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:53,129
He was just trying to get
something he didn't have.

389
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:18,772
He's such a fucking idiot.

390
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:22,407
He's living life.

391
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:46,323
It doesn't feel like plastic.

392
00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:49,649
It feels like those shells, abalone.

393
00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:52,924
I know.

394
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:57,728
Kind of makes you wanna build
a pyramid to live in.

395
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:05,891
- I understand why you wanna leave.
- I don't wanna leave.

396
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:10,609
I'm not happy either.
I wanna blame you, but it's not your fault.

397
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:16,926
I've known you for so long, I don't know why
I thought getting married would transform you.

398
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:21,205
- It has transformed me.
- I know. I didn't mean it to sound like that.

399
00:36:21,253 --> 00:36:27,488
I know how committed you are. I just mean
it didn't change the way you feel about me.

400
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:32,243
- God, it did, though.
- Not the way I wanted it to.

401
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:40,523
It's not fair to you and I guess
it's not fair to me either, really.

402
00:36:46,493 --> 00:36:51,567
It's good we tried. I think we had to try.

403
00:37:00,893 --> 00:37:03,930
Don't you think we could maybe now just...

404
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:07,884
start from a different place?

405
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:12,683
Neither one of us is ever gonna be
what the other person wants.

406
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:17,761
This is bullshit, this idea of what we want.
Maybe it's enough now to just stop pretending.

407
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:22,728
- And be like friends, you mean?
- Yeah, but not just that.

408
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:26,048
- And you wanna be lovers still?
- Yeah.

409
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:29,210
Without all the pressure
to be something we're not.

410
00:37:29,253 --> 00:37:32,962
But what if it's never any good?

411
00:37:33,013 --> 00:37:35,573
Then we'll know we really tried.

412
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:39,004
Really tried.

413
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:52,691
- I feel really relieved.
- You do? I do too.

414
00:38:00,573 --> 00:38:03,883
You see? These fucking pyramids
really do work.

415
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:11,844
Sorry.

416
00:38:13,173 --> 00:38:15,687
It's OK. Come in.

417
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:24,682
It's really nice in here.

418
00:38:26,093 --> 00:38:31,372
It's supposed to have the same proportions
as the pyramids in Egypt.

419
00:38:31,413 --> 00:38:35,804
I thought it was supposed to be
this horrible plastic version of a sacred space.

420
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:38,811
That's kind of a reverse message.

421
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:41,651
Like modern life isn't always so bad?

422
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:45,284
I don't know, like...

423
00:38:46,213 --> 00:38:51,207
even though we feel like we've lost touch
with this more authentic history,

424
00:38:51,253 --> 00:38:55,212
there's a continuity that we don't even realise.

425
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:03,321
That's really comforting.

426
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:05,762
I wish we never had to leave.

427
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:23,931
Excuse me. Do you know who bought it?

428
00:39:23,973 --> 00:39:25,964
Fifi Rochedale.

429
00:39:30,253 --> 00:39:32,244
- Is that you?
- No.

430
00:39:33,253 --> 00:39:35,244
It isn't.

431
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:41,132
Your old cat's name was Fifi
and I don't know where you got Rochedale.

432
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:45,963
- It's the street. It's your porn name. Nice.
- God, you're fast.

433
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:50,211
- It doesn't make it OK that no one wanted it.
- I wanted it.

434
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:53,290
- I love it.
- You're in debt.

435
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,767
It's a good investment.

436
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:59,692
The thing's gonna be worth
so much more in five years.

437
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:17,044
- Weird.
- Checked all the stalls?

438
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:19,084
Yeah, and upstairs.

439
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:22,244
What shall we do?

440
00:40:22,293 --> 00:40:25,729
Fuck it. She's got a cellphone.
She can call a cab.

441
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:29,203
Might I remove my glasses?

442
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,448
- Please do.
- Thank you.

443
00:41:45,173 --> 00:41:47,607
How weird was it
that Brenda was there tonight?

444
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:50,167
I don't know. How weird was it?

445
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:53,842
She dropped off the face of the planet
as far as I knew.

446
00:41:53,893 --> 00:41:56,123
What do you think about him?

447
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:04,006
- He's pretty sexy.
- So?

448
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:07,243
- So what?
- Do you wanna go for it?

449
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:12,406
- Really?
- Unless you like someone better.

450
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:15,889
I just thought we were supposed to be
negotiating if we did it again.

451
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,289
We are negotiating.
You can pick somebody else.

452
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,450
Frank made it sound like
there are rules or something.

453
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:25,326
- Like what?
- I don't know.

454
00:42:25,373 --> 00:42:27,967
Maybe certain things
we only do with each other.

455
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:30,004
Like what?

456
00:42:30,853 --> 00:42:34,243
- I don't know, like kissing, maybe?
- That sounds OK.

457
00:42:34,293 --> 00:42:36,329
Would that be rude to the other person?

458
00:42:36,373 --> 00:42:38,443
I'm sure he won't care.

459
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:41,882
OK, let's start with that.

460
00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:44,604
That's Patrick.

461
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:51,364
What about him?

462
00:42:51,413 --> 00:42:53,768
For us? No way.

463
00:42:53,813 --> 00:42:56,327
Why not? He's so nice.

464
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,683
We're not doing it with somebody we know.
It's just creepy.

465
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:02,201
I'm gonna talk to the tall guy.

466
00:43:06,533 --> 00:43:08,842
I thought you were at your sister's art thing.

467
00:43:08,893 --> 00:43:10,884
We just came from there.

468
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:14,522
How is this place?

469
00:43:14,573 --> 00:43:18,566
I don't know. It seems
pretty much like a free-for-all.

470
00:43:18,613 --> 00:43:22,322
I think I'm not so much a gay-bar person.
Is that really sad for me?

471
00:43:22,373 --> 00:43:24,762
I think that's really happy for you.

472
00:43:37,293 --> 00:43:39,488
Mom?

473
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,411
Darling, you're home.

474
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,841
I'm sorry. It was too late to stop.

475
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:52,923
Honey, I bought a painting.

476
00:44:04,213 --> 00:44:06,204
All right, then.

477
00:44:10,093 --> 00:44:12,687
Thank you for a lovely evening.

478
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:15,644
I should be getting back now.

479
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:19,572
You can stay if you'd like.

480
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:21,604
No, I couldn't.

481
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,332
I really should be getting back.

482
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:29,924
All right.

483
00:44:37,973 --> 00:44:39,964
Thank you so very much.

484
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:43,363
Thank you.

485
00:45:51,653 --> 00:45:53,644
Thank you.

486
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:56,685
Let us know if there's anything else we can do.

487
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,728
That's hard to live with.

488
00:46:12,893 --> 00:46:15,851
- Someone kills herself over you.
- She was depressed.

489
00:46:15,893 --> 00:46:19,363
But he said she was doing fine.
She was on the right medication.

490
00:46:19,413 --> 00:46:22,086
She did it because he left her.

491
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:27,331
It's depressing how deluded
people are about what love is.

492
00:46:29,933 --> 00:46:32,731
Wait. What do you mean?

493
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:36,368
Like it's gonna make their lives better.

494
00:46:36,413 --> 00:46:39,689
It does a little, right?

495
00:46:40,733 --> 00:46:44,248
It's just not like someone else
can change who you are.

496
00:46:44,293 --> 00:46:46,488
Like this woman Melinda.

497
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:49,286
That guy was the only good thing in her life?

498
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,722
He didn't seem that great to me.

499
00:46:53,253 --> 00:46:55,642
I wouldn't wanna be him right now.

500
00:46:58,253 --> 00:47:00,244
Me neither.

501
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:05,689
It takes all my heart to keep
from giving that asshole in five

502
00:47:05,733 --> 00:47:07,883
a triple dose of this stool softener.

503
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:11,130
It would hurt us more than it would hurt him.

504
00:47:11,173 --> 00:47:13,926
- How are you doing on the Paxil?
- Not great.

505
00:47:13,973 --> 00:47:18,888
- All I can feel are the side effects.
- So when are you gonna go see Rogers?

506
00:47:18,933 --> 00:47:24,291
I should try and stop in this week,
but I always feel like he has no idea who I am.

507
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:28,008
I go in there for five minutes
and he goes down some list.

508
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:32,410
They don't give a fuck. They just give you
whatever samples came with the best gifts.

509
00:47:32,453 --> 00:47:37,447
When I was depressed, the only thing
that worked was Celexa with Ativan.

510
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:45,643
I should probably ask Rogers.

511
00:47:45,693 --> 00:47:47,888
Just try it and see if it works for you.

512
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:52,370
You can tell Rogers that you saw
another doctor while you were on vacation.

513
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:54,404
Here.

514
00:47:58,213 --> 00:48:00,204
Gave you generic.

515
00:48:04,253 --> 00:48:06,289
Still the machine.

516
00:48:08,373 --> 00:48:11,126
I already left a message
saying I was coming over,

517
00:48:11,173 --> 00:48:14,643
so if she wants me to walk in on more fucking,
that's her choice.

518
00:48:14,693 --> 00:48:18,891
I can do it for you if you feel like you've seen
enough of Mom's pussy for a few days.

519
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:21,447
Who could ever see too much
of Mom's pussy?

520
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:23,848
It's like a trip down memory lane.

521
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,486
- Really, though.
- I know. Thanks.

522
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:31,969
- I don't even know where everything is.
- I can come with you.

523
00:48:41,453 --> 00:48:43,444
That would help.

524
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:48,292
Good.

525
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:51,769
- I appreciate you letting me stay here.
- I have the space.

526
00:48:51,813 --> 00:48:54,725
It's just until I get my client list back together.

527
00:48:54,773 --> 00:48:57,333
Stay as long as you can stand my friends.

528
00:48:57,373 --> 00:49:00,729
Is Kenny still over here all the time?

529
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:03,492
You know what? He's not that bad.

530
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:06,206
He used to come into my room
and fart on my pillow.

531
00:49:06,253 --> 00:49:08,244
He was ten.

532
00:49:09,693 --> 00:49:11,684
Get up.

533
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:25,731
I can't believe how much money
I've spent fucking up my life.

534
00:49:28,973 --> 00:49:31,726
- Did you ever find out who bought your piece?
- Yep.

535
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:33,809
- Was it your mom?
- I wish.

536
00:49:33,853 --> 00:49:36,651
You wish? Who could be worse
than your mom?

537
00:49:37,373 --> 00:49:40,729
- It wasn't my mom, was it?
- No.

538
00:49:43,053 --> 00:49:45,283
It was Olivier.

539
00:49:50,093 --> 00:49:55,247
- That's flattering.
- I'm sure it's just some kind of head trip.

540
00:49:56,013 --> 00:49:57,731
Why?

541
00:49:58,573 --> 00:50:02,168
To teach me some kind of
weird lesson or something.

542
00:50:04,053 --> 00:50:08,092
- What kind of lesson?
- Like he owns me.

543
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:13,084
His whole power thing.

544
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:18,686
Maybe he just really liked your piece.

545
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:20,724
Kind of doubt it.

546
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:27,724
Tickles.

547
00:51:08,493 --> 00:51:11,291
- I fell asleep.
- It's OK.

548
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,528
- Is it late?
- It's not even five.

549
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:16,371
- Is Maya...
- She's fine. She's sleeping.

550
00:51:20,973 --> 00:51:24,170
- How long have you been here?
- I just got here.

551
00:51:28,173 --> 00:51:29,572
What?

552
00:51:30,973 --> 00:51:32,964
Nothing.

553
00:51:33,813 --> 00:51:36,008
I'm just happy to see you.

554
00:51:38,653 --> 00:51:40,644
- You are?
- Yeah.

555
00:51:43,173 --> 00:51:45,368
I'm happy to see you too.
