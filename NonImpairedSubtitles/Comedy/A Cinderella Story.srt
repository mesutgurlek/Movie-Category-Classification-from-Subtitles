1
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:46,386
once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom,
lived a beautiful little girl...

2
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:48,685
...and her widowed father.

3
00:00:53,265 --> 00:00:54,664
Its beautifuI.

4
00:00:54,833 --> 00:01:00,100
okay. It wasn`t that long ago.
And it wasn`t really a faraway kingdom.

5
00:01:00,272 --> 00:01:02,968
It was the San Fernando Valley.
It looked faraway...

6
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:05,609
...because you barely see it
through the smog.

7
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:09,178
But to me, growing up,
the Valley was my kingdom.

8
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,820
I was my dad`s best friend.
And he was mine.

9
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:24,628
Being raised by a man put me behind in
the makeup and fashion departments.

10
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:28,129
But I never felt like I missed out
on anything.

11
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:31,800
I was the luckiest girl in the world.

12
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:38,199
My dad owned the coolest diner.
I loved hanging out there.

13
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:48,550
Diet was a four-letter word here...

14
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,984
...and grease came
at no additional charge.

15
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:54,484
At Hal`s, everyone felt like family.

16
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,958
Oh. yeah. I have drinks.

17
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,633
Happy birthday!

18
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:05,598
Make a wish. princess.

19
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:10,538
What did I need a wish for?
I had amazing friends and the coolest dad.

20
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:20,449
But I guess my dad thought I needed
one more thing: Fiona.

21
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:22,280
I am so sorry.

22
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:27,023
You Iook beautifuI. Fiona.

23
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:29,092
Hey. HaI!

24
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,758
Along with my new stepmother came
her twin daughters, Brianna and Gabriella.

25
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:39,904
My out-of-step-sisters.

26
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:45,271
But as long as my dad was happy, so was I.
We were going to be one big, happy family.

27
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:46,968
cheese.

28
00:02:48,513 --> 00:02:49,741
Ones enough.

29
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:53,112
Unfortunately, this was no fairy tale.

30
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,854
创He took her hand. and he kissed it.

31
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:59,081
Then he swooped her up onto
his horse.

32
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:05,290
And the beautifuI princess and the
handsome prince rode off to his castIe...

33
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:11,403
...where they Iived happiIy ever after.创

34
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,698
Do fairy taIes come true. Dad?

35
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:18,673
WeII. no. But dreams come true.

36
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:21,210
-Do you have a dream?
-Yeah.

37
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,439
My dream is that youII grow up
and go to coIIege...

38
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:27,779
...and then maybe someday youII buiId
your own castIe.

39
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,280
Where do princesses go to coIIege?

40
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:35,185
They go...

41
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,521
...where the princes go.

42
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:39,687
They go to Princeton.

43
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:43,733
But. Sam. you know. fairy taIes arent
just about finding handsome princes.

44
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:47,470
Theyre about fuIfiIIing your dreams...

45
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,767
...and about standing up for what
you beIieve in.

46
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:53,706
As I aIways say. never Iet the
fear of striking out--

47
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,177
-Keep you from pIaying the game.
-Right.

48
00:03:57,582 --> 00:04:01,609
just remember. if you Iook carefuIIy.
this book contains important things...

49
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:04,813
...that you may need to know
Iater in Iife.

50
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:18,102
-Earthquake.
-My kingdom crumbled...

51
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,204
...during the Northridge earthquake.

52
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:22,533
HeIp! HeIp!

53
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:25,676
-Dont go.
-III be right back.

54
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:40,150
I lost my best friend that day.

55
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:42,885
From then on, the only fairy tales
in my life...

56
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:45,655
...were the ones I read about in books.

57
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:56,206
Since my father didn`t leave a will,
my stepmother got everything.

58
00:04:56,374 --> 00:05:02,779
The house, the diner,
and to her dismay, me.

59
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:51,222
Sam.

60
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:54,359
Sammy.

61
00:05:56,835 --> 00:05:58,996
Sam!

62
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:01,701
It`s breakfast time.

63
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:04,671
So bring me my breakfast.

64
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,474

71
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,401

72
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,946
-Sam!
-Find each other. Look in the eyes.

73
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:47,380
-Im coming.
-One. two. three and four...

74
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:49,349
...and right. Ieft. up and down.

75
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:53,218
Is this the Norwegian saImon I asked for?
I need my omega-3s.

76
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,054
OnIy the best.

77
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,059
I can teII.

78
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:04,327
You know. it costs a fortune to fIy
that stuff in from Norwegia.

79
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:07,300
And push it. Iadies. Push it. Iadies.
Push it. Iadies.

80
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:08,996
Ready? Okay.

00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:18,345
-Gross. Mom!
-I have a spastic coIon.

82
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:20,746
WeII. you have a spastic brain.

83
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:23,516
-Stop. Stop hitting her. Stop.
-You bit me.

84
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:26,891
What are you doing just standing there?
Get to work.

85
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:30,391
I cant go to work now.
Ive got a big test I have to study for.

86
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:36,523
Listen. Sam. PeopIe go to schooI

88
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:43,200

94
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:08,062
Droughts are for poor peopIe.

95
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,961
Do you think j.Lo has a brown Iawn?

96
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,668
PeopIe who use extra water

97
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,543
You caII that grade-A beef? WeII. that cow

00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:41,865
-Theres another spot.
-Got it.

155
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:49,475
come on.

156
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,060
Austin.

157
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,494
PeopIe Iike SheIby and Austin...

158
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,192
...are geneticaIIy programmed
to find each other.

159
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,600
How can so much ego be
in one reIationship?

160
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:19,104
-Imagine what they say about you.
-They dont even know I exist.

161
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:23,880
StaIkerazzi at 3 ocIock.

162
00:13:24,048 --> 00:13:28,041
The white zone is for cooI peopIe onIy.
No geeks.

163
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:33,716
Hey. diner girI. can I get a
breakfast burrito to go? Thank you.

164
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:36,121
And you thought they didnt
know you exist.

165
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:38,455
-That cars as oId as that hat.
-Right.

166
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:42,828
Move. Move. Move.

167
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,060
-Move. Move.
-Hi.

168
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:49,968
SheIby. Hey. sister-friend.

169
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:52,302
Remind me why we toIerate them.

170
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:54,741
They gave you a Prada bag
for your birthday.

171
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:57,574
Try 创Frada创 bag. TotaIIy fake.

172
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,657
Greetings. Samantha. you Iook absoIuteIy

173
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:12,523

174
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:16,531
If youII excuse me. I must get back
to my gaIaxy now.

175
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:20,562
Zion. Lieutenant Terry here. HeIIo?

176
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:23,764
can you hear me? captain?
Youre going in and out.

177
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:26,774
-Poor guy.
-At Ieast hes happy.

178
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:30,846
-Happy? Guy Iives in another worId.
-I copy.

179
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:34,280
Sometimes fantasy is better
than reaIity. carter.

180
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:43,123
-Speaking of fantasy.
-III see you Iater.

181
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:47,060
Yes. the secret admirer beckons.

182
00:14:53,171 --> 00:14:56,504
Where have you been?
We haven`t talked in ages.

183
00:14:57,074 --> 00:15:00,202
We taIked this morning.

184
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:03,804
I can`t stop thinking about you.

185
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:06,513
What`s on your mind right now?

186
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:11,911
You first.

187
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,693
Well, I`m thinking that Professor Rothman`s
dissected one too many frogs.

188
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:30,331
Ribet, ribet.

189
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,775
Laugh out Ioud.

190
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:39,482
I wanna hear your laugh.
When can we finally meet?

191
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,297
Soon.

192
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:04,697
How`s your day so far?

193
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:09,708
Raging stepmom, work and cool kids
who can`t get over themselves.

194
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:12,372
-Ever feel like you don`t belong?
-Absolutely.

195
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,210
I can be surrounded by a sea
of people and still feel all alone.

196
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,652
Then I think of you.

197
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:24,592
Hey, Nomad, do you think
we`ve ever met?

198
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:29,828
I don`t know. our school
has over 3500 kids.

199
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:32,629
Well, that narrows it down.

200
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:35,567
Well, at least I can eliminate the guys.

201
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,274
You`re not a guy, right? Because if you are,
I`ll kick your butt.

202
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:43,646
I am not a guy.

203
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:46,880
Have you told your dad
about Princeton yet?

204
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:51,317
If only I could. I haven`t even told him
I wanna be a writer.

205
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:54,219
My father always encouraged me
to pursue my dreams.

206
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:58,488
Not mine. He has another plan
for my life.

207
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,525
It`s 2 a.m. We`ve been at this
for five hours.

208
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,299
Well, I think we broke our record.

209
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:11,335
-We should turn in. Sweet dreams.
-Wait.

210
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,872
I can`t sleep without knowing
there`s hope.

211
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:20,172
Half the night I waste in sighs.

212
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:23,314
In a wakeful doze I sorrow.

213
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:28,416
For the hand, the lips...

214
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,891
...the eyes.

215
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:33,428
For the meeting of tomorrow.

216
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:37,023
Quoting Tennyson. Impressive.

217
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:39,793
Please meet me at the
homecoming dance.

218
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:44,499
I`ll be waiting for you at 1 1:00
in the middle of the dance floor.

219
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,213
Sweet dreams.

220
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:55,815
That was cIose.

221
00:17:55,987 --> 00:18:01,186
-Youre finaIIy gonna be abIe to meet him.
-I dont know. Hes too good to be true.

222
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:10,725

met him in that Princeton chat room. okay?

223
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:15,304
-You taIk to him aII the time. You know him.
-I know. but he doesnt know me.

224
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:18,135
What if I meet him
and Im not what he expects?

225
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:21,767
Maybe this whoIe reIationships
just better for cyberspace.

226
00:18:25,783 --> 00:18:29,116
Listen. okay? You have to go
to that dance. okay?

227
00:18:29,286 --> 00:18:33,916
This Nomad guy isnt gonna be in one pIace

228
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:36,924
-If it heIps. III be your escort.

229
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:40,789
-Yeah.
-You rock. carter.

230
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:46,000
-HeIIo?
-Sam.

231
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,702
Some IittIe brat got into my saImon
and ate it aII.

232
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,709
I need more salmon.
And pick up my dry cleaning.

233
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:56,437
And wash the jag.

235
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:05,954
-Why do you act Iike her sIave?
-SimpIe. No Fiona. no money for Princeton.

236
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:08,114

241
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:38,781
Youre not gonna go with SheIby?
Who eIse you gonna go with?

242
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:41,916

280
00:22:08,172 --> 00:22:13,474
I know. but you need to stop being so
seIf-centered and start thinking of others.

281
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:17,045
Others need you to go to the diner
and mop the fIoors tonight.

282
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:20,672
But I reaIIy need to go to this dance.

You need to earn your tuition money

Youre weIcome.

824
01:07:16,873 --> 01:07:20,240
Bonjour, Fighting Frogs.
Here`s your daily drought reminder:

825
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:24,346
Don`t hose your lawn, your car,
or anybody else, for that matter.

826
01:07:24,647 --> 01:07:27,411
And remember, tickets
for the big game go on sale....

827
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:33,112
And then she toId us that she was
going to try to steaI...

828
01:07:33,289 --> 01:07:36,417
...Austin away from you
if that was the Iast thing she did.

829
01:07:37,393 --> 01:07:41,193
Our stepsister has aIways been
jeaIous of you.

830
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:44,861
Go on.

831
01:07:45,034 --> 01:07:48,731
WeII. thats when she invented
this whoIe cindereIIa pIot.

832
01:07:49,172 --> 01:07:51,436
She got ahoId of Austins
e-maiI address...

833
01:07:51,607 --> 01:07:54,405
...and thats when she
started the whoIe affair.

834
01:07:54,577 --> 01:07:59,037
We wanted to teII you sooner.
but she threatened to kiII us.

835
01:07:59,215 --> 01:08:01,547
Shes such a monster.

836
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:06,546
Look. if you dont beIieve us.
Iook at the e-maiIs.

837
01:08:06,956 --> 01:08:11,723
She goes by Princeton GirI 81 8.
but her reaI name is Sam Montgomery.

838
01:08:12,061 --> 01:08:13,756
And were Brianna and GabrieIIa.

839
01:08:17,266 --> 01:08:21,896
So that IittIe boyfriend steaIer
thinks she can puII a fast one on me?

840
01:08:22,305 --> 01:08:25,331
WeII. weII just see about that.

841
01:08:33,216 --> 01:08:37,277
Austin was reaIIy Iate today and asked me
if youd read this announcement.

842
01:08:41,591 --> 01:08:42,853
创cindereIIa...

843
01:08:43,126 --> 01:08:48,564
...if you`re listening, your prince wants to
rendezvous with you after the pep rally. ``

844
01:08:49,098 --> 01:08:52,465
Nothing like a pep rally
to warm up our prince.

845
01:09:03,246 --> 01:09:06,613
carter! I taIked to him.
And not as cindereIIa.

846
01:09:06,783 --> 01:09:09,980
I taIked to him as me. Sam.
and he didnt hate me.

847
01:09:10,153 --> 01:09:12,121
So you toId him everything?

848
01:09:12,288 --> 01:09:15,382
No. not everything. Not the part
about me being cindereIIa.

849
01:09:15,558 --> 01:09:19,494
But Im gonna go teII him right after
the pep raIIy. You coming. cowboy?

-So you think I Iook Iike a reaI cowboy?
-Sure.

851
01:09:53,196 --> 01:09:56,063
-Who we gonna beat?
-The Lancers!

852
01:09:56,232 --> 01:09:58,359
-And when we gonna beat them?
-Friday!

853
01:09:58,534 --> 01:10:01,230
Good news. I just got off
the phone with Hank coIe.

854
01:10:01,404 --> 01:10:05,340
You pIay weII on Friday. and your future
is set at USc footbaII.

855
01:10:06,742 --> 01:10:08,369
Thats great. Dad.

856
01:10:09,579 --> 01:10:11,843
And whos gonna Iead us to victory?

857
01:10:12,014 --> 01:10:14,448
-Austin!
-I cant hear you!

858
01:10:14,617 --> 01:10:16,949
-KiII the Lancers!
-Austin!

859
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:25,124
The cheerIeaders have put together
a skit to heIp get us in the spirit.

860
01:10:28,664 --> 01:10:30,325
I Iove you. SheIby!

861
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,831
Thank you.

862
01:10:32,301 --> 01:10:36,601
创Once upon a time. there was
a big. strong Fighting Frog.

863
01:10:37,373 --> 01:10:42,367
He had a beautifuI girIfriend. and his dad
owned the biggest pond in aII the Iand.

864
01:10:43,379 --> 01:10:45,370
But he stiII wasnt happy.

865
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:51,580
If onIy he can find a princess.
then she couId kiss him...

866
01:10:51,754 --> 01:10:55,656
...turn him into a prince.
and they wouId run away together.

867
01:10:59,462 --> 01:11:03,592
One night. after the sIimy frog
ditches his super-hot...

868
01:11:03,766 --> 01:11:07,463
...senior-poII-most-popuIar girIfriend.
he meets his princess.创

869
01:11:07,637 --> 01:11:09,104
Your highness.

870
01:11:11,941 --> 01:11:15,775
创AIas. it turned out that our frog
not onIy had a secret identity...

871
01:11:15,945 --> 01:11:21,645
...but aIso had a secret e-maiI reIationship
with a pen paI named Princeton GirI.创

872
01:11:22,451 --> 01:11:23,782
This isnt good.

873
01:11:23,953 --> 01:11:27,286
Dear Princeton GirI. I cant wait
tiII we finaIIy get to meet.

874
01:11:27,456 --> 01:11:29,947
Youre the onIy one
who understands the reaI me.

875
01:11:30,126 --> 01:11:32,526
The man who doesnt want
to pIay USc footbaII.

876
01:11:32,695 --> 01:11:35,960
But who wants to be at Princeton.
with you.

877
01:11:36,332 --> 01:11:39,768
-What are they taIking about?
-Nothing.

878
01:11:39,936 --> 01:11:44,839
Dear Nomad. I want you to know
who I am. but Im scared!

879
01:11:45,708 --> 01:11:47,903
Im scared that youII reject me.

880
01:11:48,077 --> 01:11:52,275
And Ive never had a reaI kiss before.

881
01:11:53,616 --> 01:11:56,483
-I cant beIieve theyre reading my e-maiIs.
-Lets go.

882
01:11:56,652 --> 01:11:58,449
But our princess had a secret too.

883
01:11:58,621 --> 01:12:04,355
She wasnt royaIty at aII. but a geek.
a Ioser. a servant girI.

884
01:12:09,999 --> 01:12:11,489
Yeah!

885
01:12:11,801 --> 01:12:13,894
Any ideas about this?

886
01:12:16,339 --> 01:12:19,001
And who. may you ask. is this imposter?

887
01:12:19,175 --> 01:12:25,011
Give it up for the pretend princess.
diner girI. Sam Montgomery!

-Sam!
-Go away!

891
01:13:10,493 --> 01:13:14,589
But. Sam. youve got a Ietter
from Princeton.

892
01:13:21,937 --> 01:13:23,734
What does it say?

893
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,242
I didnt get in.

Oh. no!

916
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:12,690
And cover up those stupid words.

917
01:17:13,168 --> 01:17:17,935
创Never Iet the fear of striking out

01:17:33,956 --> 01:17:35,651
Excuse me?

922
01:17:35,824 --> 01:17:39,021
You heard me. I quit.

923
01:17:39,194 --> 01:17:43,858
I quit this job. I quit your famiIy.
And Im moving out.

924
01:17:48,103 --> 01:17:51,197
Oh. and where are you gonna Iive?

925
01:17:51,507 --> 01:17:53,236
With me.

You cant just waIk out on me.

927
01:17:58,213 --> 01:17:59,441
You know what. Fiona?

928
01:17:59,615 --> 01:18:02,482
You can mess with your hair.
your nose and your face...

929
01:18:02,651 --> 01:18:04,983
...and you can even mess
with my dads diner.

930
01:18:05,354 --> 01:18:07,549
But youre through messing with me.

931
01:18:09,024 --> 01:18:10,355
Wait up. Sam.

932
01:18:10,526 --> 01:18:14,428
You take one more step. and youre fired.

933
01:18:14,597 --> 01:18:18,397
Oh. no. that wont be necessary.
because I quit too. And you know what?

934
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:23,732
The onIy reason why I put up with
you aII these years is because of that girI.

935
01:18:24,106 --> 01:18:28,065
Now that shes free of you. nothing
is stopping me from kicking your butt.

936
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:32,346
come on. no. Not my face. Its much
newer than the girIs. Go for the girIs!

937
01:18:32,514 --> 01:18:35,415
-Mom!
-Rhonda? Rhonda!

938
01:18:35,584 --> 01:18:37,609
Shes not even worth it.

939
01:18:40,823 --> 01:18:43,417
-Youre right.
-You know what? I quit too.

940
01:18:43,659 --> 01:18:47,459
Me too. Hey. Rhonda. EIeanor.

Send me a biII.

945
01:19:03,545 --> 01:19:06,036
Fiona actuaIIy thought
you were gonna sIug her.

946
01:19:06,215 --> 01:19:08,080
I was gonna do more than that.

947
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:10,684
I had no idea that you were that tough.

948
01:19:11,654 --> 01:19:14,145
Yeah. but I aIways knew that you were.

949
01:19:16,058 --> 01:19:17,548
Rhonda...

950
01:19:19,595 --> 01:19:21,790

951
01:19:21,964 --> 01:19:24,990
Sam. I wouIdnt have it any other way.

952
01:19:31,173 --> 01:19:34,165
I havent feIt this much at home
in such a Iong time.

953
01:19:34,576 --> 01:19:37,067
Im sure. compared
to the Addams FamiIy.

954
01:19:40,749 --> 01:19:43,980
-Whats on your mind?
-I gotta do something tonight.

955
01:19:44,153 --> 01:19:46,485
Dont wait up for me. okay?

961
01:20:21,523 --> 01:20:23,320
What are you doing in here?

962
01:20:23,525 --> 01:20:25,186
Sam.

963
01:20:25,627 --> 01:20:28,494
-Okay. I know you think Im just some--
-coward? Phony?

964
01:20:28,664 --> 01:20:31,030
-Okay. just Iisten.
-No. you Iisten.

965
01:20:31,233 --> 01:20:34,031
You turned out to be exactIy
who I thought you were.

966
01:20:34,203 --> 01:20:37,570
I never pretended to be somebody eIse.
Its been me aII aIong.

967
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:40,732
And it was me who was hurt
in front of everybody.

968
01:20:41,543 --> 01:20:45,536
Look. I didnt come here
to yeII at you. okay?

969
01:20:45,714 --> 01:20:49,946
I came to teII you I know what it feeIs
Iike to be afraid to show who you are.

970
01:20:50,119 --> 01:20:51,916
I was. But Im not anymore.

971
01:20:52,087 --> 01:20:55,215
And the thing is. I dont care
what peopIe think about me...

972
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:59,417
...because I beIieve in myseIf.
And I know that things are gonna be okay.

973
01:20:59,595 --> 01:21:03,759
But even though I have no famiIy
and no job and no money for coIIege...

974
01:21:03,932 --> 01:21:06,264
...its you that I feeI sorry for.

975
01:21:06,835 --> 01:21:10,271
-Heads up. Yo. five minutes.
-Im coming.

976
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:15,736
I know that guy that sent those e-maiIs
is somewhere down inside of you.

977
01:21:15,911 --> 01:21:18,141
But I cant wait for him...

978
01:21:18,447 --> 01:21:22,076
...because waiting for you is Iike
waiting for rain in this drought.

979
01:21:22,251 --> 01:21:24,685
UseIess and disappointing.

980
01:21:28,524 --> 01:21:30,219

981
01:21:42,171 --> 01:21:44,298
-Sam.

987

...tied for the lead in the

1004
01:23:16,798 --> 01:23:21,997
The winner of tonight`s game will advance

1005
01:23:23,805 --> 01:23:25,329

1032
01:26:54,282 --> 01:26:56,477

Touchdown! The Fighting Frogs have won.

So we won the big game that day.

1039
01:27:43,665 --> 01:27:46,225
But what I remember most
was I got my prince.

1040
01:27:46,401 --> 01:27:48,392
And a really bad cold.

1041
01:27:50,172 --> 01:27:53,573
After that, it was like everything
fell into place.

1042
01:28:08,623 --> 01:28:12,923
My dad was right. The fairy tale book
did contain something important.

1043
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:21,328
Take this one and take the
two cars in the front.

1044
01:28:21,503 --> 01:28:24,165
I can pay for those parking tickets!

1045
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,798

-She owns them.
-ExactIy. I own them.

1048
01:28:36,117 --> 01:28:39,985
Im the county district attorney.
Have you ever seen this before?

1049
01:28:40,155 --> 01:28:42,453
Ive never seen that before.

1050
01:28:43,558 --> 01:28:46,254
Isnt this your signature
on the witness Iine?

1051
01:28:47,362 --> 01:28:50,729
I have never seen my
husbands hidden wiII before.

1052
01:28:52,334 --> 01:28:55,565
Im afraid youre gonna have to come
downtown with me. maam.

1053
01:28:58,139 --> 01:29:03,577
That hidden will stated that the house,
the diner and everything belonged to me.

1054
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:09,679
It turned out my stepsisters knew where
Fiona had filed my real acceptance letter.

1055
01:29:09,851 --> 01:29:11,375
I got it!

1056
01:29:13,755 --> 01:29:16,952
My dad`s diner was restored
to its former glory.

1057
01:29:19,828 --> 01:29:22,058
And my stepmother
made a deal with the DA.

1058
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:25,722
She`s working off her debt
to society at Hal`s...

1059
01:29:26,468 --> 01:29:29,369
...under the watchful eye
of my new partner.

1060
01:29:37,345 --> 01:29:41,782
And my stepsisters? They finally put
their teamwork to good use.

1061
01:29:47,622 --> 01:29:52,355
Austin`s dad finally came around
and got off his Trojan horse.

1062
01:29:54,462 --> 01:29:56,726
Things even cleared up for Carter.

1063
01:29:59,734 --> 01:30:03,397
Anything is possibIe if you just beIieve.

1064
01:30:03,905 --> 01:30:06,305
He ended up filming a commercial.

1065
01:30:07,442 --> 01:30:10,138
And in addition to
landing that commercial...

1066
01:30:11,146 --> 01:30:13,546
...Carter also landed the girl.

1067
01:30:21,656 --> 01:30:24,648
The San Fernando Valley
was clear and beautiful...

1068
01:30:24,826 --> 01:30:27,488
...the way it only is after a big rainstorm.

1069
01:30:30,165 --> 01:30:33,965
As for Austin and me, well,
I finally got my cell phone back.

1070
01:30:34,135 --> 01:30:38,265
We wound up going to Princeton together
and lived happily ever after.

1071
01:30:39,674 --> 01:30:43,110
At least for now.
Hey, I`m only a freshman.

1072
01:35:06,274 --> 01:35:08,265
