1
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,887
What was that?

2
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,888
Honey, are the kids
up? What are they doing?

3
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:44,395
I peed.

4
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,033
Kevin peed the bed.

5
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,467
Our bed? Uh-huh.

6
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,203
All 500 thread counts
of Egyptian cotton.

7
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,305
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

8
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,307
I don't want you to
worry about it, buddy.

9
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,308
It'll happen again your freshman
year of college, trust me.

10
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,813
No more sodas before bed!

11
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,548
Sit down here. But I like soda.

12
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,151
How you doing, big guy? Good morning.

13
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,252
Let's have a big morning!

14
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:09,253
Let's start off with a little
breakfast, get our Froot Loops.

15
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,824
Here's Daddy's coffee. And I need it.

16
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,326
Here's your bowl of
fruit, without the loops.

17
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,428
Why no loop?

18
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,495
Daddy doesn't need loops.

19
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,930
I gotta eat it. If I eat a big meal now,

20
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,198
then I can watch what I eat later.

21
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,833
Otherwise, I'll get starved
and raid the refrigerator.

22
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,934
Okay, honey. We've got to hurry up,

23
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,035
'cause we got to go to hockey.

24
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,103
I thought you could do that

25
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,238
because I might try to get a
little bit of work done today.

26
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,108
Honey, we have to go by the
showroom and pick out the tile.

27
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,444
I want you to see it. We
talked about this last week

28
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,013
and I told you how
important today was for me.

29
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,615
I'm Mega Man! May the best team win!

30
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,918
Okay, guys, let's keep it down.

31
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,686
Keep the eyes on the... On the screen.

32
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,921
You guys doing good?
- Yes.

33
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,022
Honey? Yeah.

34
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,291
What do you think? Nickel, brushed
nickel, chrome or brushed chrome?

35
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,459
I like the silver ones.

36
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,593
They're all silver.

37
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,795
Well, great. Pick out whichever
knob that you like, then.

38
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,630
No, I'm not gonna pick
whichever knob I like

39
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,432
because you know what's gonna happen?

40
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,201
Is that I'm gonna pick one
and then you're gonna complain

41
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,469
once they're in and
then it'll be too late.

42
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,039
Hello? Dave, where
the heck have you been?

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,742
I'm picking out pulls. Why have
you been calling me nonstop?

44
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,743
Well, you know how my credit's
all screwed up because of my wife?

45
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,047
But you're divorced.

46
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,815
I need you to cosign for my motorcycle.

47
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,751
What motorcycle? I'm
buying a motorcycle.

48
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,153
Shane, you have no money.

49
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,154
Why in the world would you be buying
a motorcycle that you can't afford?

50
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,459
Dave, you're white. You
can't understand this.

51
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,727
This is something different.

52
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,929
Don't play the race
card with me, Froot Loop.

53
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,664
I'll take him in. You
stay with Kevin, okay?

54
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,333
Okay. All right, go ahead.

55
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,101
Have fun, champ. Go get 'em, buddy.

56
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,102
You should see this thing. It's
awesome. Even Trudy loves it.

57
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,407
Who's Trudy?

58
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,842
That's my girlfriend.

59
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,977
Girl from the mall?

60
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,645
She's 20 years old, Dave.

61
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,514
Let's go. Let's move
it. I got bikes to move.

62
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,516
Listen, Shane. You are not buying

63
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,085
some 20-year-old
broad a motorcycle.

64
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm not buying her
anything, it's for me!

65
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,921
Daddy, what's taking so long?

66
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,691
Hey, baby, I'm on the phone,

67
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,692
and I would prefer it if you
didn't call me that in public.

68
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,596
But I call all my boyfriends Daddy!

69
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,372
Dave, you gotta do this for me.

70
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,640
Why don't you just lease it?

71
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,874
No, she'll know.

72
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,843
Who will know? She's a kid.

73
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,211
Buy her a Hello Kitty book.

74
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,380
Get her an assignment notebook
and put rainbow stickers in it.

75
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,714
You don't have to buy her a motorcycle.

76
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,017
Did you or did you not say, "Move on"?

77
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,518
I told you to try to work it out.

78
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,720
Joey's the one who told you to move on.

79
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,222
Can you give me a minute?

80
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,223
Try to make it fast, Daddy.

81
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,697
Dave, I'm hurting. I would
love for my wife to come back.

82
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,670
But we know that's not gonna happen.

83
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,406
It's nice to feel appreciated.

84
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,407
I need this for me.

85
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,744
Fine. Just text me the address. Okay?

86
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,249
Pick out a helmet, baby!

87
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,585
Daddy!

88
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,752
So, honey, this is the tile.

89
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,088
It's all gonna happen at once
and I really need you to dial in.

90
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,256
Sweetheart, I'll help you.

91
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,557
I want a sugar cone.

92
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,392
I'm gonna hit you
after this, buddy. Okay.

93
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,594
Honey, you work from 8:00 to 8:00.

94
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,828
You're not gonna be helping anyone.

95
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,096
Hang on, honey, okay?

96
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,231
It's just really busy right now

97
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,732
because the video game ships this month.

98
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,434
Now that I have you, I
just want you to dial in

99
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,935
and tell me what you really think.

100
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,070
It's fine.

101
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,171
Do you love it?

102
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,039
As much as I can love
tile, I love this tile.

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,442
Okay, good, 'cause it's $1,000.

104
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,943
Really? Mmm-hmm.

105
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,111
Is that installed?

106
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,412
Nope, just the tile.

107
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,615
Well, what is it made
out of? Whale tusks?

108
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,116
No, it's not made out of whale tusks.

109
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,885
This is so boring.

110
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,286
Give me just one second.
Let me just grab this.

111
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,387
Honey? We have to do this today. Hello?

112
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,955
Hello, Dave. Joey?

113
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,223
Yeah, hey. Look... Just
one second, that's it.

114
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,424
...what are you doing
about the Jason thing?

115
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,193
If it's Joey, can you ask him
if he's coming to the party?

116
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,061
Are you... Are you coming
to the party on Sunday?

117
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,129
Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

118
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,264
Yeah, he's coming, all right?

119
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,465
Give me one second. Stay with Mom.

120
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,599
One second.

121
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,401
Jason's gonna be calling you, all right?

122
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,304
He's got another one of
his PowerPoint deals that...

123
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,773
Hold on one second. Hello?

124
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,441
Hey, Dave, it's Jason.

125
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,442
Listen, I'd love to put something
on the books with you and Ronnie.

126
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,880
Are you gonna make it to
Kevin's birthday on Sunday?

127
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,483
Yes, I am. Now, listen,
I was hoping that

128
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,151
you guys would come
down here to the firm

129
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,553
because Cynthia and I have
a PowerPoint presentation

130
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,056
that would just play gangbusters
in the conference room.

131
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:07,057
Okay, okay, hold on one
second. It's ringing.

132
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,627
Hello? Why'd you hang up on me?

133
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,129
I didn't hang up on you. You're on hold.

134
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,398
He's trying to get me to see
another one of his PowerPoint things.

135
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,499
That stuff creeps me out.

136
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,600
It's just how he communicates.

137
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,968
He's... He's, you know...
He's overly efficient.

138
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,469
Well, I don't like
hearing about ball cancer,

139
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,071
let alone looking at diagrams.

140
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,172
Joey, he was scared.

141
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,307
Tell him I'm not going.

142
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,474
I ain't telling him you're not going.

143
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,509
You know, I got him on the other line.

144
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,643
You can tell him yourself. Hold on.

145
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,178
I don't want to... I don't...

146
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,313
Hello, Jason?

147
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,348
Yeah. I got Joey on the line.

148
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,350
Hey, Joey, I've left you

149
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,519
a bunch of voice mail messages
all morning. Where are you?

150
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,987
Listen, I can't make it.

151
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,022
Well, we haven't even
set a time yet, you know.

152
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,524
If you'd listened to the voice mail,

153
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,459
you'd know that this
is just a feeler call

154
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,694
to check your temperature on schedule.

155
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,695
I'm not sitting through another
slide show about ball cancer.

156
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,533
Listen, pal, I'm alive today because
of early detection, all right?

157
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,634
Is this about ball cancer?

158
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,969
"Cause I..
- I'm not into that, either.

159
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,203
I'm gonna wrap this up right now.

160
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,874
and if you two refuse to check
your scrotums for hardened nodules,

161
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,209
I certainly can't force you, can l?

162
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,712
Look, I gotta go, all right? Bye+

163
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,713
Dave, are you still there? Hello, Dave?

164
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,051
Kevin! Kevin, that's not a real toilet!

165
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,053
Sweetheart, he's pissing in
the middle of the whole thing!

166
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,188
Buddy, I gotta go.

167
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,857
But Cynthia and I are willing to
offer you a life-changing opportunity.

168
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,826
Jason, you don't understand.
My son is literally peeing

169
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,694
right in the middle of the
store. I gotta go. Go, go, go.

170
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,062
Okay, but that's not
a real toilet there.

171
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,964
It looks like a real toilet to me.

172
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,965
Yeah, it looks real. Okay.

173
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,502
That's a whole other conversation.

174
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,870
You feel better? Yep.

175
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,839
Okay, let's button those up.
You want me to get those for you?

176
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Yep.

177
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,680
There's not a lot to
say. Sorry about that.

178
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,594
Mom, Dad's home.

179
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,728
Hi, hon.

180
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,097
Hey, how was your day?

181
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,932
Usual. Yours?

182
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,934
Good.

183
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,003
Okay, love you. Bye.

184
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,938
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait
a second, wait a second.

185
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,940
You're going out? Yeah, I'm going out.

186
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,776
What are... What are you wearing?

187
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,943
Shorts. Shorts?

188
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,745
That's... That's a Maxi Pad.

189
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,746
Dad, they're designer shorts.
They're French. Goodbye.

190
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,617
Could you just come over
here? Sit down for a second.

191
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,085
I don't have time for this.

192
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,953
Come here. Sit down. No, I'm...

193
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,121
I'm late and they're waiting for me.

194
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,222
I know,

195
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,059
but you still live in my house
for another few months, okay?

196
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,693
Yeah, I know. Now when
you dress like that,

197
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,529
you send signals.

198
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,797
You know what kind of
guy you attract like that?

199
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,964
You attract the guy with the...

200
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,566
With his pants around
his ass at the mall.

201
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,234
No, I don't! Yes, you do.

202
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,470
Sweetheart, he is right.

203
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,472
Lacey, I'm saying you're beautiful.

204
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,374
You're smart. You're a good person.

205
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,276
You just got accepted into Stanford.

206
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,444
We're so proud of you.

207
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,946
I'm just saying know your value, okay?

208
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,782
And if a guy doesn't see
that, he doesn't deserve you.

209
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,783
No, and you don't want to
be with those guys, honey.

210
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,589
Okay, then I'll go change.

211
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,590
Thank you.

212
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,962
And could you change the
pictures on your Facebook page?

213
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:57,996
Dad.

214
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,131
It's just 'cause we love you.

215
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,466
Love me less.

216
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,568
I don't want any bikini
pictures on the Internet!

217
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,736
When you're living in my
house, you're a Taliban!

218
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,271
Okay? You keep your body a secret.

219
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,272
Except you get to, you know,
go to school and read books.

220
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,280
Did you send the tuition check?

221
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,682
You said you were going to.

222
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,084
Please. Don't start this again.

223
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,086
Yeah, I didn't start with
it. You just brought it up.

224
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,454
You're supposed to send the check.

225
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,522
You said you were gonna do it.

226
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,357
You never do anything
you say you're gonna do.

227
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,358
Eighteen years. Just try to hold it
together for another couple months.

228
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,461
Trust me, I'm counting the days.

229
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,533
Do that hurt, Daddy,
or do that feel good?

230
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,337
It's both. It hurt and it feel good.

231
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,208
Bang, bang.

232
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,380
Did you put in the wide beauty shots?

233
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,515
Yeah.

234
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,616
Are you sure?

235
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,850
Why would you ask me that?

236
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,152
You know I triple-check everything.

237
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,153
Yeah, no, I know. It's just,
you know, super-important, okay?

238
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,823
We only get one shot at it.

239
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,726
It'd just be nice if you could
show me a little bit of trust.

240
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,727
I do. Come on, I do, I do. I just
want this to be perfect, that's all.

241
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,565
It's not about trust. Come on.

242
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,566
I want it to be perfect, too.

243
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,569
Good.

244
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,820
How old is she?

245
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,423
I think she's 20. He
met her at the mall.

246
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,559
She was working at Foot Locker.

247
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,561
He was so in love with Jennifer.

248
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,496
I am shocked he met someone so quickly.

249
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,497
I know. I was hoping they
were just taking a break.

250
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,402
I haven't even heard from
her since they split up.

251
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,403
I think he got us in the
divorce. You want more wine?

252
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,509
Cynthia, it's time. We're
all set up in the bedroom.

253
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,610
Great. Ladies?

254
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:52,878
You're kidding, right? No, it's easy.

255
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,746
We brought our own screen.

256
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,914
You can't do it right now.

257
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,616
We're in the middle of
my son's birthday party.

258
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,617
It won't take long and I know
you"re gonna be really excited.

259
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,854
Bring your booze.

260
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,290
Okay, then.

261
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,392
We're taking the wine.

262
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,393
Watch this, guys. Watch.
This is a really spooky ball.

263
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,968
Just, could you please put
the ball cancer video on?

264
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,135
I'm trying, Joey.

265
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,471
Please. I don't want to
watch that ball cancer video.

266
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,539
Where's Trudy?

267
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,541
Oh, she's watching the magician.

268
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,309
Well, there it is. Okay.

269
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,310
This is not a video and it
is not about ball cancer.

270
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,147
Thank God. That,s a first.

271
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,148
Jason and I are seriously
considering getting a divorce.

272
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,557
Okay? So, it's no secret

273
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,096
that Cynthia and I have had our problems

274
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,798
trying to conceive
over the last 12 months.

275
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,166
That's no reason to get a divorce.

276
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,268
No.

277
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,669
We know. Of course not.

278
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,670
But suffice it to say, it's been
more than taxing on both of us,

279
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,843
and it's forced us to question
our entire relationship.

280
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,347
You two are perfect for each other.

281
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,316
We're just not so sure
about that anymore.

282
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,151
We're not in a good place.

283
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,152
Now, this is not a decision
that we're taking lightly.

284
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,325
Cynthia and I have been
together for eight long years.

285
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,593
And if it's not meant to be,

286
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,594
we just don't want to waste
any more of each other's time.

287
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,864
Yeah. Because, if we do get divorced,

288
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,368
it will take at least six months

289
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,271
to go through the five stages of grief.

290
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,372
For the sake of argument,

291
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,373
let's optimistically assume it takes
six months to find compatible mates.

292
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,012
Tack on another 12 months for courtship,

293
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,548
an additional six months
for attempting procreation...

294
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,283
You can see how this starts to stack up.

295
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,284
Sounds like you guys are really
working from the heart on this one.

296
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,487
Well, we're lost, Dave,

297
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,856
and so what we need to do is we
need to take the next two weeks

298
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,225
and we need to find out whether
we're gonna push forward,

299
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,860
or whether we're gonna fold up shop.

300
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,861
And that is why we are going to go here.

301
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,301
You're on, Cyn.

302
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,302
Welcome to Eden. Okay? The
ultimate playground for couples.

303
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,407
It's got fun, it's got sun.
It's Disneyland for adults.

304
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,013
Wow. That is amazing.

305
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,082
Yeah, you guys are gonna have a blast.

306
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,751
Actually, we have found
a great group rate.

307
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,686
Oh, there's the fine print.

308
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,755
No, now... Now, Joey, you know, just...

309
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,223
The embarrassing fact is that, you know,

310
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,224
Cynthia and I can't afford to
go to this place by ourselves,

311
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,828
but if all of us go
together, it's half-price.

312
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,999
It's called the Pelican Package.

313
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay? It's six nights, seven
days and it's all inclusive.

314
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,037
And there are quite a few
activities you can choose from.

315
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,441
Who here likes to eat?

316
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,943
I know you guys do. I sure do.

317
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,177
Right? Boom!

318
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,178
Why not do it at a
four-star restaurant?

319
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,716
You guys, it has a
state-of-the-art spa.

320
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,251
Ah. Mmm-hmm.

321
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,054
They've got your kayaking,
they've got your windsurfing,

322
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,122
they've got your canoeing,

323
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,890
they've got your jet skiing. Wow.

324
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,726
It's got Couples Skill
Building and snorkeling...

325
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,361
Who, whoa, whoa. Back up.

326
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,529
What was that last thing?

327
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,630
Snorkeling?

328
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,032
No, no. Before snorkeling
and after jet skiing,

329
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,635
you said, "Couples Skill Building."

330
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,237
That sounds like therapy to me.

331
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,471
See, that's gonna be a problem.

332
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,973
We don't believe in therapy. No.

333
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,608
Hell to the no.

334
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,143
Then you don't have to do it.

335
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,145
That's the great thing about
the Pelican Package, you guys.

336
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,080
It really includes everything.

337
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,082
Obviously, Jason and I want to partake

338
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,717
in the Couples Skill Building,

339
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,485
but you guys can just do the fun stuff.

340
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,987
So what are we asking?

341
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,289
We're asking for you
guys to fly to paradise

342
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,792
and have an awesome time, okay?

343
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,394
I mean, this... Come
on, it would be a blast.

344
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,829
Jason, I got a job,

345
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,830
and with everything that's going on with
the house and with the kids right now,

346
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,301
it would be impossible
for us to leave them.

347
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,402
Yeah, we can't.

348
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,403
When was the last time you
two took a vacation? Hmm?

349
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:45,811
I mean, don't you want to go
to this island and have fun,

350
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,846
together, as a couple?

351
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,614
What kind of question is that?

352
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,849
That's like asking Richard Simmons,

353
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,418
would he rather stuff his face
or skip around to the oldies.

354
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,187
Of course he'd rather stuff
his face, but he can't,

355
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,955
'cause he's... He's got
to stay thin so he can...

356
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,491
So he can get up and do his
thing and... And make videos.

357
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,027
Maybe he needs the money. Maybe
he's got a gambling problem!

358
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,762
I don't know what goes
on in that dude's head!

359
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,864
And I'd love to go to that
island, but I can't, either.

360
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,865
Not 'cause I got to make videos like
Rich, but I got other obligations.

361
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,368
Listen, I can really appreciate
the situation that you guys are in.

362
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,105
Right, well, we need
to know by midnight.

363
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,477
We've been on the wait list forever

364
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,712
and these slots just opened up.

365
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,214
We'd need to leave next week.

366
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,381
Next week?

367
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,549
That's right.

368
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,451
What happened to spontaneity?
What happened to fun?

369
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,553
I don't know. Why don't we
have a PowerPoint presentation

370
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,889
on spontaneity and fun
and figure that one out?

371
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,890
Look, Cynthia and I
need this trip, okay?

372
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I mean, really. You
know, the problem is,

373
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,831
you know, we've stopped having fun

374
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,832
and we're not even sure we
know how to anymore, okay?

375
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,804
So, what we need to find out
is can we get back to the place

376
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,372
where we really enjoy
each other, you know?

377
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,373
Can we get back to the place
of, you know, being in love?

378
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,225
Cynthia's IM-ing me.

379
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,427
Jason was IM-ing me all night.

380
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,429
What'd you tell him?

381
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,430
I logged off.

382
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,667
The place did look beautiful.
You know what it made me think?

383
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,037
It'd kind of be like we got
to take our honeymoon, finally.

384
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,875
God, yeah.

385
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,876
That'd be great.

386
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,115
Really?

387
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,783
Yeah.

388
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,784
Don't you think? I mean, I don't
know, maybe it's a girl thing.

389
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,288
When you're a little girl,

390
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,289
you dream about your
wedding and your honeymoon...

391
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,194
You know.

392
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,230
I was pretty lucky to
get that job right away.

393
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,365
Yeah, of course.

394
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,601
I mean, I can't even imagine...

395
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,602
Living in your dad's
basement any longer? No.

396
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,976
It's funny how time goes so fast.

397
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,811
That doesn't seem that long ago.

398
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,246
No.

399
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,582
Seems like we just had so much going on

400
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,583
and we have ever since,

401
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,121
but maybe the thing to do is just really

402
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,057
buckle down over these next six months

403
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:15,058
and then when we come up
for air, we'll go somewhere.

404
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,596
That sounds like a plan.

405
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,109
Dave? Did you hear that?

406
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,181
Go back to bed, honey.

407
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,652
What's going on?

408
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,253
I think there's someone outside.

409
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,756
Okay, I'll check it out.

410
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,669
Honey, be careful.

411
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,026
Freeze! Do not move!

412
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:24,027
Hey, don't... No, it's me, it's
me, it's me! It's me! It's Jason!

413
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,563
What's going on?

414
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,898
It's fine, honey, it's Jason.

415
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,033
Hello!

416
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,200
Why didn't you call?

417
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,302
Didn't want to wake you up.
Sorry, blew that. Back to bed.

418
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,371
Are you crazy? I could've
blown your head off!

419
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,907
What does that say about you, huh?

420
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,908
Rapists don't gently toss
pebbles at the window, Dave.

421
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,311
Wait, can you let me figure it out,
please? There's too much going on.

422
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,715
Turn it off!

423
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,917
It costs money every
time this thing goes off.

424
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,020
Hello? Yeah, everything's
fine. I'm sorry.

425
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,159
The password is
"ass-tastic." That's right.

426
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,160
"Ass-tastic." One word.
"Ass-tastic." "Ass-tastic." It's...

427
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,365
A-S-S-T-A-S-T-I-C.
Okay? Ass-tastic.

428
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,603
That's right, it's... Okay.
Yeah. No, thank you. We're fine.

429
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:12,108
l... Yes, thank you.

430
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,946
Didn't want to go with the pet's name?

431
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,114
What are you doing here, dude?

432
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:19,050
What do you think I'm doing here?

433
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,051
Jas, you're showing up to my
house in the middle of the night.

434
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,056
Dave. You're breaking and
entering. You're on tilt.

435
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,291
Yeah, I know, I'm losing my mind.

436
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:29,292
This... The whole fertility doctor
thing is just an absolute disaster.

437
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,698
We don't communicate anymore.
We're fighting all the time.

438
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,133
We... The only time we have sex is,

439
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,468
you know, when she's ovulating,

440
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,037
and even then, it's
cold. It's emotionless.

441
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,705
It's... I don't know.

442
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:41,806
Like an oil derrick.

443
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,808
We used to be very,
very spontaneous at that.

444
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,044
Now, it's... I don,t know.

445
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,613
Twice a week, tops.

446
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,948
That's a lot.

447
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,050
Is it? How often do you do it?

448
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,953
It's different now, 'cause
we got the kids, so...

449
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,154
So?

450
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,156
Well, my son falls
asleep in the bed with us.

451
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,491
That shouldn't stop you.

452
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,825
That's disgusting.

453
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,427
I'm not saying he
should tickle your balls.

454
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,062
Just move him into his
room when he falls asleep.

455
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,664
Jason. I can really appreciate
what you're going through,

456
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,167
but, man, this couldn't
come at a worse time.

457
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,568
There's just no way
that we can pull away

458
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,936
from everything and go right now.

459
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,739
I'm sorry, but there's just
no way we can go on the trip.

460
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,740
I'm just scared, you know. Just scared.

461
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,912
You know, my whole life,
everything I've known about it

462
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,413
for the last eight years might be over,

463
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,582
and, you know, I'm
prepared to face that,

464
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,917
you know, if it,s for the best.

465
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,918
If, you know... If it's not
there anymore, then, you know,

466
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,189
I'll face it. I don't
want to do that alone.

467
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,190
And I know that Cynthia
doesn't want to do that alone.

468
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,362
You know, we'd just... We'd
love to have our friends there.

469
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,165
You know that if you go,
everyone else will go.

470
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,166
And I have never asked you for anything.

471
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,702
But I am asking you for this, Dave.

472
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,674
Daddy?

473
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,675
Hey, guys, the alarm
was just an accident.

474
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,380
You can go back to bed.
It's just Uncle Jason.

475
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:58,016
Okay, guys. It's fine. Let
me take you back to bed.

476
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:01,017
We want you to go on your trip.

477
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,221
We heard you talking at the party

478
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:05,890
and you said you
couldn't go because of us.

479
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,525
We don't want you guys to get a divorce.

480
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,726
What?

481
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,229
What are you talking about,
honey? We're not getting a divorce.

482
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,531
But we just want you to be happy.

483
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,300
Guys, we are happy.

484
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,569
We're very happy, honey.

485
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,570
Were you guys listening to
Uncle Jason's slide show?

486
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,409
Thank you, buddy. That's great.

487
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,011
That was adult time.

488
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,247
And why do you think they
were listening, Jason?

489
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,015
I'm sorry about that.

490
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,016
We want you to go, so we called
Grandpa to come take care of us.

491
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,021
You called Grandpa?

492
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,924
You called him tonight?
It's a three-hour drive.

493
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,026
Grandpa's coming to babysit us.

494
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,395
Is Grandpa driving down here now?

495
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,198
Yay! Grandpa Jim Jim's here!

496
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,603
You know, this has
gotten way out of hand.

497
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:54,239
I'm sorry. I just... I wanted five
minutes of your time. I'm so sorry.

498
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,573
You got... You got kids, you got guns,

499
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,841
you got grandpas that, you know...

500
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,842
You got to explain infertility
and divorce and all that,

501
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,679
and so you got a lot of
parenting to do tonight.

502
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,015
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna
let myself out right here.

503
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,450
I will, however, take the fact that

504
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,451
Grandpa Jim Jim's at the front
door as a firm, tentative yes.

505
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,457
Pack lots of shorts.
It's really hot there.

506
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,458
You're gonna sweat your
bag off. Night-night, kids!

507
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,494
Hi. Welcome.

508
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,329
Thank you.

509
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,330
This place is beautiful.

510
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,833
Look. Hi, hello.

511
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,670
Holy shit, this looks like
a screen saver! Thanks.

512
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,139
Seems like he might be kind
of the guy. Come on, gang.

513
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,841
Hi, we are the Smith
party. Party of eight.

514
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:04,976
Eight for Smith.

515
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,077
Jason Smith?

516
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,178
That's me.

517
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,781
Welcome to Eden.

518
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,782
My name is Sctanley. Spelled with a "C".

519
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,485
I will be escorting you
to the Eden West resort.

520
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,190
Please, step aboard our shuttle.

521
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,191
No need to take your bags. They will
be waiting for you in your villas.

522
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:40,009
Excuse me. Sorry. Is this the
shuttle for the Eden resort?

523
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,014
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the shuttle.

524
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,383
Raq, she's still a little
buzzed from the flight.

525
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:48,052
Man, totally. Me, too. I
don't even know what I'm doing.

526
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,722
Excuse me. What name are your
reservations booked under?

527
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,523
The San Diego Dance Academy.

528
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,658
Wow.

529
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,293
Ah. You ladies are actually travelling

530
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,628
on this shuttle, to Eden East.

531
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,331
Bummer. Bye.

532
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,300
See you. Bye.

533
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,301
Bye.

534
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,138
Would you care to join your wife?

535
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,406
Let's do it. Shall we?

536
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,741
Are they going some place else?

537
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,742
Eden East. It is an
entirely different resort.

538
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,430
It's beautiful.

539
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:33,698
And the luggage is
already in there, huh?

540
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,099
Yeah. This is yours.

541
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,267
Unbelievable.

542
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,535
The 101.
- Wow.

543
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,370
And we can jump right
out into this here?

544
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,105
You can do whatever you like.

545
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,240
Wow.

546
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:45,043
Look at the water.

547
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,277
Please. Thank you.

548
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,614
Wow. Wow.

549
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,682
I'm gonna check the bedroom. Okay, baby.

550
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,684
Look at this, baby.

551
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,019
Oh, my God. Look at this.

552
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,354
Welcome to your villa.

553
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:57,622
It keeps getting better, huh?

554
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,191
It's like a little love hut.

555
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,292
Wow.

556
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,293
This is insane!

557
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,296
Honey, they got fish that you
can see here through the floor!

558
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,201
Baby, they got a hole
where you can see the fish!

559
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:13,202
Yeah, they got fish in here, too, baby!

560
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,640
Jason, this is dreamy.

561
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,975
Baby, you can jump right
in the ocean on this thing,

562
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,444
and they got a hot tub on the deck!

563
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,946
They got the ocean and
they got the hot tub!

564
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,815
You can dive in the ocean
and you got a hot tub!

565
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,651
Yeah, they got a hot tub in here, too!

566
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,888
Oh, my God. Yo, I gotta
take a picture of this.

567
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,924
Did I tell you? Did
I deliver? Oh, my God.

568
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,892
She ain't never seen nothing like this.

569
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,094
I roll like this! Shit, yeah!

570
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,595
I'm glad you like, sir.

571
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,331
I be rolling like this.

572
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,633
So what goes on over
there? I hear there's music.

573
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,902
Is a party for single
woman and men, sir.

574
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,671
Yes. How do l get over there?

575
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,573
No, you cannot. You can
take the boat if you want,

576
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,508
but not for you. Okay,
when's the boat? Not for me.

577
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,243
No, because you got married here,

578
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:55,079
the west coast to Eden Resort
so that's why you must keep here.

579
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,148
I don't understand what you're
saying. You sound like Chewbacca.

580
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:58,683
Well, my instinct is
to stay married to her,

581
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,151
but what do you think I should do?

582
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,787
I mean, do you get a good vibe
from us or not-so-good vibe?

583
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:03,855
I don't know, sir.

584
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,523
What about this room, in particular?

585
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,091
You've checked a lot
of people into this room

586
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,593
and checked a lot of people out.

587
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,594
Do they usually leave
happier or less happy?

588
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,097
I really don't know, sir.

589
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,665
How do I get over to the party?

590
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,700
By boat or by taxi boat.

591
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,201
Okay. I'd like to arrange
a boat or a taxi boat.

592
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,436
No, it's not possible for you.

593
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:19,770
Must to stay here with your wife.

594
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,972
Okay, so how do I...

595
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,540
Fish!

596
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,875
Hello.

597
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,877
Where's the television? The main house.

598
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,879
There's no TV in the
room? No, not possible.

599
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,313
But it's the playoffs.

600
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,515
As an alternative to television,

601
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:33,451
might I recommend a stroll
to the hidden waterfall?

602
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,219
Might you recommend
putting honey in my ears

603
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,654
and having me fall asleep on an anthill?

604
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,489
It's the playoffs.

605
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,490
Honey, the waterfall sounds
amazing. A little romance.

606
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:44,527
You'll find that the Eden program
creates a palace of solitude,

607
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,398
if you just give yourself over to it.

608
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,733
How's the cell service here?

609
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:51,734
Monsieur Marcel believes that
technology is a distraction.

610
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,172
Well, how about tipping,
would that be a distraction?

611
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,506
I'm kidding you.

612
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,075
Tipping is not permitted,
nor is money of any kind.

613
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,411
Everything here in Eden is free.

614
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,546
Really?

615
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:04,547
We do, however, accept smiles.

616
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,592
Did you guys hear what
they have in the spa?

617
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:15,726
With the snow?

618
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,727
Did you know that they have a
steam, a rain, and a snow room here?

619
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,598
It's a new European spa.

620
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,999
What's a wahoo?

621
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,569
It's a fish.

622
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,237
I don't eat fish.

623
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,039
It's out of this world.
They catch it right here.

624
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,840
I used to work at Red Lobster,

625
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,841
so I know what they do with
them fish in the kitchen.

626
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,780
But, baby, this is not like the Red
Lobster. It's a four-star restaurant.

627
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:38,216
I don't give a shit! It's
still Mexicans cooking that shit

628
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,451
and I know what they do to it!

629
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,452
I'm one-twelfth Latina, and
even if I wasn't, I'm 100% human,

630
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,457
so I don't appreciate
comments like that.

631
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,960
I don't make fun of tu
la raza, so porfavor,

632
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,462
please, don't make fun of mi la raza-

633
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,463
Oh, I'm sorry, boo. I
didn't mean no disrespect.

634
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,866
Yo, I was with mad Mexicans
before Shane, anyway.

635
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,139
Good evening. I trust
you're all settled in.

636
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,910
Hey, my main man!

637
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,411
Are you in the mood
to accept some smiles?

638
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,713
"Cause this spread is phenomenal.

639
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,715
Why don't you join us for a
drink? You want to pull up a chair?

640
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:11,816
We'll order some shots.

641
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,985
You might want to go easy on
those. You have an early morning.

642
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,152
Quite the contrary.

643
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,454
I don't have an early morning,

644
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,823
'cause I tell you what's
gonna go down tonight.

645
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,792
I am going to get just
a little bit tipsy.

646
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,793
And then I'm gonna go ahead and
stuff my face on the Seafood Tower,

647
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,065
and I plan on shutting
it down in a big way.

648
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,902
l, if everything goes
well, will be in my room,

649
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,639
passed out on my face, come lunch-ski.

650
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,108
Well, I'm afraid that
isn't going to be possible.

651
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,577
I'm here to present
you with your itinerary.

652
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,646
Fantastic. You guys hear that?

653
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,681
This is a hard copy thing, too.

654
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,016
This is not like... This isn't like

655
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,350
a piece of paper with an itinerary.

656
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,818
No. This is like a book.

657
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,819
Thanks. And the journey begins.

658
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,795
Couples Skill Building at 6:00 a.m.?

659
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,867
Yeah, see, I was
planning on sleeping in,

660
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,969
and then maybe hitting the jet skis.

661
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,872
That is not part of your immediate
program here at Eden West.

662
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,874
But it was in the slide show. Uh-huh.

663
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:12,677
That would be more
appropriate at the Eden East.

664
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:13,711
What's Eden East?

665
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,012
The singles' resort.

666
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,714
Singles" resort?

667
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:19,483
Here at the Eden West, our
focus is on renewing bonds

668
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,053
and nurturing neglected partnerships.

669
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,888
And what's your focus over there?

670
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,889
Sex, mostly.

671
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,492
Freeing inhibitions.

672
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,627
I'm sure if we play our cards right'

673
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,995
we'll be having plenty
of sex here on our side.

674
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,864
Am I wrong, gang?

675
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,865
I spent three years of
therapy with Jennifer,

676
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,804
talking about our
feelings and our problems,

677
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:41,505
trying to hold onto our marriage.

678
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,741
The last thing I want to do is talk.

679
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,810
Look, I think there's been
a misunderstanding here.

680
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,912
See, we signed up for the fun stuff,

681
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:50,014
with the touchy-feely
shit being optional.

682
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,148
Thank you.

683
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,416
I think it's called the Pelican Package.

684
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,085
Yes, the Pelican Package,

685
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:57,021
which is monsieur
Marcel's signature course.

686
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,155
Great.

687
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,156
A healthy combination of
couple-friendly activities,

688
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,827
ample down time... That's the one.

689
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:05,563
...sprinkled in with some
Couples Skill Building courses,

690
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,832
designed to reignite the dimming flames

691
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,768
of even the most
mismanaged relationships.

692
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,769
Okay, see, these relationships
are not mismanaged.

693
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,406
Well, thank you, Dave. Yes.

694
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,775
Yeah. I'm just saying
we're here to have some fun,

695
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,844
so we are excited about
the couples' activities,

696
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,078
as well as some down time.

697
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,079
It's the flame-lighting thing
that does not have us inspired.

698
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,851
That's more suited for
this particular couple here.

699
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:29,286
I don't think you're
quite understanding me.

700
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,756
Monsieur Marcel's Pelican Package

701
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:34,757
is not a fast-food restaurant wherein

702
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,895
you pick what you want from a menu.

703
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,398
Monsieur Marcel is the
single most-recognized

704
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,399
couples whisperer in the entire world.

705
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,735
Couple whisperer?

706
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,638
He has studied
psychology, yoga, tai chi,

707
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,639
The Art of War, and combined
them to form this place, Eden.

708
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,912
The Mecca for couples. Mmm.

709
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,882
He has designed a program
specifically for you.

710
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:00,883
You either partake of the
entire meal or have none of it.

711
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:05,554
I think you're being a little
extreme here, Mr. Belvedere.

712
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,828
We have a very long waiting list.

713
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,563
If there's been some
kind of misunderstanding,

714
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,564
I'd be happy to refund your
money, and you can go on your way.

715
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,334
We will, however, not be
able to refund your airfare.

716
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,338
No, it's just that we were excited

717
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,407
about the sightseeing and the hiking

718
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,443
and the jet skiing and
the snorkeling. It's...

719
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,777
Well, there are plenty of places

720
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,013
that provide those activities.

721
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,415
Perhaps this troupe
might be more comfortable

722
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,416
at a Sandals or a Club Med.

723
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,786
This here is monsieur Marcel's Eden.

724
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,292
Now, if you're not at Couples
Skill Building by 6:00 a.m.,

725
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,863
I'll take that as you want your refund

726
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:48,864
and will not be completing the program.

727
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,671
Screw him! Where does he get
the ass to run down Sandals?

728
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,007
Sandals rocks.

729
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,476
It's just one little
thing we have to do.

730
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,477
It'll be over in a few hours and
then we have fun the rest of the day.

731
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,881
You know, let's just
not forget why we came.

732
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,149
This is not what we signed up for!

733
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,350
This is not what we signed up for.

734
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,685
I don't remember ever
seeing 'mandatory,"

735
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:08,953
but, listen, we just go with it.

736
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,954
Now we're on Han's Island about
to do the thing with Bruce Lee.

737
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,658
Guys, guys, I don't think
there's any reason to overreact

738
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,726
right off the bat, okay?

739
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,961
Obviously, the meal is included,

740
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:18,696
from what he said, so
let's just sit here,

741
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,697
we'll weigh the pros and cons from
a calm place, we'll make a decision.

742
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,902
That was amazing.

743
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:27,903
Oh, might have been the
best meal I've ever had.

744
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:30,808
Well, could be a full week of those.

745
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,710
What are you doing? Your last course.

746
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,411
Dessert.

747
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,718
It is so beautiful here. I can't
wait to go see that waterfall.

748
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,719
The weather is perfect, we got huts
on the water, and now I am eating art.

749
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,391
So we give up a little bit of
our day to talk about feelings.

750
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,392
How bad can it really be, right?

751
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,843
Welcome to Eden Resort.

752
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,447
I am Marcel.

753
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,283
Hi. Morning.

754
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:15,284
I know why you are all here.

755
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:19,023
You are here to seek the answer

756
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:22,024
to the most commonly
asked question by all,

757
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,563
how do we make it work?

758
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,734
How?

759
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:37,306
I have laid out a personalized program

760
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,477
designed to challenge you all,

761
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:46,114
both as couples and as individuals.

762
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:52,621
If you follow diligently my program,

763
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:56,491
the answer to this question
will be revealed to you,

764
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,494
as well as your inner animal spirit.

765
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,999
This I promise.

766
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:12,174
I do not, however, promise
that you and your chosen partner

767
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,778
will have what it takes to sustain it.

768
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:25,087
Please, line up on the beach.

769
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,991
Take your places.

770
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,025
Out here?

771
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:31,026
This way. Men on one
line, facing the ocean.

772
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,796
Women, back to the water.

773
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:41,036
Now remove your mask.

774
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:47,811
Undress!

775
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,847
Oh. All right.

776
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,382
It's a freeing exercise.

777
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:52,683
This is starting to
get a little creepy now.

778
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,219
It'd mean a lot to me if you"d just
take your pants off, all right, Dave?

779
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,320
Is that why you brought me here?

780
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,321
This is... What is this?

781
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,567
You must undress, my friend.

782
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,703
I'm afraid that's not a option
for me today, you know, man.

783
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,805
It's the program.

784
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,074
Right. I don't have any drawers, though.

785
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,410
Well, Sctanley said he had this
conversation with you last night.

786
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:22,411
Now, if you've chosen to stay,
you've chosen to participate.

787
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,081
Now, if you're not wearing any drawers,

788
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:27,082
then, hey, that was meant to be.

789
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:30,419
Let it all hang out.

790
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:36,091
Explore. Explore with your eyes.

791
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:40,062
Explore your mate.

792
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,100
We are all made in God's image.

793
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,436
That means we are all perfect.

794
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,437
Stand with pride. Look
closer. Own your bodies.

795
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,776
And now, tell your partner
a truth. A beautiful truth.

796
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,383
You look like the earth.

797
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,418
What?

798
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,519
Why are you listening
to what I'm saying?

799
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,620
Why don't you have
your own conversation?

800
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,889
It's hard to have my own conversation
when you're telling Cynthia

801
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,957
that she looks like the earth.

802
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,125
Did you hear what I said?

803
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,626
Yeah. I'm not really
sure I like that one.

804
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,962
Well, I just mean that, you
know, you look bountiful. Okay?

805
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,797
Fruitful. Fertile.

806
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,100
Okay. Now this is getting uncomfortable.

807
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:19,101
Please, make a palace of solitude
between you and your partner.

808
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,642
Why are you wearing trousers?

809
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,246
I explained to the guy in the dress

810
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,148
that I didn't have any drawers on.

811
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:34,149
Yes, but this exercise
is about owning your body.

812
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,386
Mmm.

813
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,455
What is your name, dear?

814
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,723
Trudy.

815
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,724
Trudy. What a beautiful name.

816
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,927
Please, tell him that you love his body.

817
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,000
For real? Yes.

818
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,268
I love your body.

819
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,503
Really?

820
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,938
Of course! So powerful, so strong.

821
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,939
Powerful frame with layer upon
layer of dormant, relaxed muscle,

822
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,410
waiting, like a panther, to
pounce on its quivering prey.

823
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:08,350
Please, take off his pants. Yes.

824
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,657
I'm not ready to pounce today.

825
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:14,758
Yes.

826
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,627
I don't have any drawers.
No. No. Right here, baby.

827
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,128
It's okay. It's okay. Hair!

828
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,631
Sorry, I'm sorry. Careful.

829
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,600
Here it comes. Here it comes.

830
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,770
Wonderful! Stare at
it! Stare at all of it.

831
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,340
Is his junk out?

832
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,508
Yep.

833
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,943
Is his junk literally out of his pants?

834
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,111
Yep.

835
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:37,112
Now it's a party.

836
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:48,123
How would you describe
your relationship?

837
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,393
Average. Great, yeah.

838
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:51,161
Great. Average. I mean, yeah.

839
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,162
And, to clarify, what is an
"average, great" relationship?

840
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,332
Well, we... We make it through
things pretty good together.

841
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,136
You know, we have two great kids.

842
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,238
No one's called 911 in
the middle of the night.

843
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,176
Like there's not domestic
violence in the... The... Yeah.

844
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,249
Ronnie, when you say you 'make
it through things together,"

845
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,650
what do you mean?

846
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,651
Well, you know, the
usual stuff. Work, kids.

847
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,356
I'm much less interested
in "the usual stuff"

848
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,525
and much more interested
in your particular stuff.

849
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,526
So, what do you make it
through together, specifically?

850
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,364
Well, right now, specifically,

851
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,571
Dave is dealing with his new launch

852
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,572
of his video game, Guitar Hero.

853
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,376
He sells Guitar Hero.

854
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,377
And I am dealing with the renovations.

855
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,747
That's interesting.

856
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:44,948
What's interesting?

857
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,718
Why do you keep writing stuff
down on your little pad there?

858
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,719
Oh, I'm taking notes.

859
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,458
Would it make you more
comfortable if I didn't take notes?

860
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,460
Yeah, actually, it would
make me more comfortable.

861
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:57,561
Thank you.

862
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,562
That's interesting.

863
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,800
So we want to make the most
of our time here on the island,

864
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,270
so what we did was we put together
a little informational packet

865
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,572
to bring you up to speed
on our relationship.

866
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,907
Go ahead. That's for you.

867
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,808
It just contains pertinent medical data,

868
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,710
family histories, you
know, stuff like that.

869
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,711
Everything but a mix tape.

870
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,981
How would you
characterize your marriage?

871
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,985
Perfect.

872
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,888
Fantastic.

873
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,889
Well, let's start with
something easy, then.

874
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,827
What's your favorite
thing about your partner?

875
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,629
Uh...

876
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,097
She's a good mom.

877
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,266
He really is a great dad.

878
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,734
And where did you meet?

879
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:40,735
School. High school. High school. Yeah.

880
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:44,306
She was a cheerleader
- I was on the football team. Fullback.

881
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,743
I coach now, but I used to play.

882
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,744
And we had... We actually
had our daughter... We...

883
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:54,683
On prom night, we conceived Lacey

884
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,587
and it was a little confusing at
the time, but it's been a blessing.

885
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,022
It's been the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

886
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,424
It's been the best thing
that ever happened to us.

887
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,792
We did the right thing.

888
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,793
How often do you have sex?

889
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,596
She wants me to be
tougher, screw harder.

890
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:12,536
Work less, but bring home more.

891
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,705
I can't keep this shit straight.

892
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:17,706
All I know is, whatever I
do, it's not good enough. Mmm.

893
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,678
It's over.

894
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,647
Then why are you here?

895
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,516
This is not my wife. This is
Trudy. I met her a couple weeks ago.

896
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,517
Can we go boogie boarding now?

897
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,855
And once people knew what
we were going through,

898
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,856
I think my cortisol levels
just shot up through the roof.

899
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,029
Because it's difficult to go through

900
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,030
a very private struggle publicly.

901
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,069
I heard what you think,

902
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,738
but you know what I'm
really interested in

903
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,739
is hearing about how you feel.

904
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,410
Just tell her how you feel.

905
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,911
Well, I think if you
looked at everything that...

906
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,912
No, no, no, no. Just... Don't
explain intellectually how you feel.

907
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,349
You know, just tell her
how you feel. In one word.

908
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,220
Sure.

909
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,258
Angry.

910
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,259
Cynthia?

911
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:13,530
Judged.

912
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,898
Very good.

913
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,267
Yes? Progress.

914
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,368
Excited.

915
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,270
Relieved.

916
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,505
That is it. Yeah.

917
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:22,606
We're awesome at feelings!

918
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:25,008
Okay. Nice job today, guys.

919
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,610
That's all for today? Great
job. That's all for today.

920
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:27,744
All right, well, great. Yeah.

921
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,446
How did we do? Did we do good?

922
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:30,781
I mean, are we gonna make it?

923
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:33,250
Well, you know, it's just
our first session, you know.

924
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,919
We're not looking for an end
result here. It's not a competition.

925
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,789
I get all that, but have you seen
couples that are worse off than us?

926
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,624
Yeah. Or are we that far gone?

927
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,626
We're... Are you gonna put a...
Like a numerical value on it?

928
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:44,127
You know, Doc? Like a one to 10?

929
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,629
One being worst, 10 being best?

930
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,631
No, hang on one second.
Where would you put us?

931
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,599
Right where you are, sir.

932
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,401
What if someone put a gun to
your head right now and said,

933
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,370
"You have to answer this
second or I'll shoot.

934
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,205
"Are they gonna make
it?" What do you say?

935
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:56,273
What would you say?

936
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:59,274
Whoa! Okay, no one has a
gun to my head, Mr. Smith.

937
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,644
It's hypothetical.

938
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:02,546
It's not a place for
inappropriate behavior.

939
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:05,449
And you definitely don't pull a
hypothetical gun on your therapist.

940
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,583
Sorry.

941
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,717
It's okay.

942
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,286
Let's clear the karma. Okay?

943
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,154
I'll holster this.

944
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,756
See, you know, I work 10 hours a day,

945
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,257
so by the time I come
home, I'm exhausted.

946
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,893
It's not that I don't want to answer
questions about the house renovation.

947
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,396
I really just don't want to
answer questions about anything.

948
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:22,232
But, you know, you may just
be shutting your mind off,

949
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:25,233
but it can feel like you're
shutting your partner off as well.

950
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,504
Again, that's a caution area.

951
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,106
And just as a point of interest,

952
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,674
when you speak that way, David,

953
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:33,675
you're really
de-prioritizing your teammate.

954
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:34,811
Excuse me?

955
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:37,314
It's called "crossing
emotional boundaries."

956
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:40,315
Or, more commonly,
"bulldozing." And it's ugly.

957
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,855
Ronnie, when you spoke earlier of...

958
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:47,856
Let me just find it in my notes here.

959
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:57,198
There it is+ You said, "We make
it through things well together."

960
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,203
That doesn't sound very fun.

961
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,204
You don't want to look back and
say, "I made it through my life."

962
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:06,875
We want to enjoy our
projects, enjoy our work week.

963
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,378
We want to enjoy our
lives, celebrate our lives.

964
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,182
And all this talk about my project

965
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:14,718
and his work, and my this and his that,

966
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,487
and mine and his, and
mine and... It,s...

967
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,890
Where's us in all that?

968
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:22,891
Where is our journey? I don't hear it.

969
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:25,562
And it's because it's not there.

970
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,564
Listen. I'm not saying that there's not

971
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,466
some really stressful times sometimes,

972
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,501
because there is, but it works for us.

973
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,337
Does it?

974
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,338
I don't know.

975
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,408
Oh, gosh, I don't know, you guys.

976
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,913
There's no "us." There's no "we."

977
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:45,914
You two could be perfect strangers.

978
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,250
I think the one thing that
we can agree on, today,

979
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:53,922
is that you guys should be doing
a lot better than just "works."

980
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:00,161
Pretty sure that's why you're here.

981
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,264
Oh. That's it. Great. Great
job, everybody. Thank you.

982
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,489
Lucy?

983
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,462
Good day, sir. I got room
service for you. I'm very sorry.

984
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,368
I didn't order that.

985
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,369
I think your wife,
she called me for you.

986
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,274
I'm...

987
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,043
This is just... Because I got a sunburn,

988
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,377
'cause it was... The sun
was very strong today.

989
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,112
Yeah. I know. This is
good for sunburns, right?

990
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,213
No. Okay.

991
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,381
It's good, yeah?

992
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,849
It's good for sunburn?

993
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,217
Okay, so I don't see anything.

994
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,519
See what? There's nothing to see.

995
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,720
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no. It works great.

996
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:05,121
Okay, I move now. No. That was.
-. That was...

997
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:08,122
There's nothing to move.
I... I was... I had a sunburn.

998
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,161
Good night, sir.

999
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:43,725
Now we will enjoy looking at the fish!

1000
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,262
See and take in with your eyes

1001
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:49,263
all the beauty the ocean has to offer!

1002
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,736
As these new things come at you,

1003
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:55,071
you may not have seen them before,

1004
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,072
but be open to them and
find the beauty within.

1005
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:00,577
Hey, buddy. Yep.

1006
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:02,746
Thanks a lot for bringing
me to Problem Island.

1007
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:04,013
What are we gonna do for an encore?

1008
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,282
Talk about all the people that we
slept with before we were married

1009
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,517
and really stir shit up?

1010
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:08,718
What the hell are you talking about?

1011
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,620
The therapist is trying
to create a problem

1012
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,288
in my marriage that doesn't exist!

1013
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,124
Maybe he's not creating them,
maybe he's just noticing them.

1014
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,291
Okay, you know what?
Don't start with me.

1015
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,293
I'm serious. I don't need it.
These are the best in the world

1016
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,795
at what they do, all right?

1017
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,430
If Jeff Gordon told you
that your oil was low,

1018
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,132
you might want to
think about changing it.

1019
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,134
From the bucket, feed them!

1020
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,935
My therapist is kind of pushy.

1021
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,036
Really? Yeah.

1022
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:28,471
God, I like ours.

1023
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,472
Yeah, he said that Dave and
I take each other for granted.

1024
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:34,809
That, you know, our relationship
has become more like a job.

1025
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:37,046
How do you mean?

1026
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:40,047
For example, he says that
Dave is de-prioritizing me,

1027
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,084
that he doesn't pay attention
to what I actually want.

1028
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,489
Yeah, but, honey, that's just
Dave being Dave, you know?

1029
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,490
Yeah.

1030
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,560
But so then, what if Dave
being Dave is sort of like

1031
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,832
Dave bulldozing me?

1032
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,435
Please continue to look at the fish!

1033
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,104
Enjoy them as they come at you!

1034
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,440
I get it, dude, it's
advanced snorkeling.

1035
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,441
Dave... Hey, I'm trying
to do this exercise!

1036
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:09,646
Why don't we talk about
this during down time, okay?

1037
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:11,848
This might be what the
therapist is referring to.

1038
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:13,283
You're missing out on life.

1039
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:16,186
It's happening right now, out
here, all around us, all right?

1040
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:18,354
And you're too busy
complaining about your problems

1041
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,355
to enjoy all these beautiful
little fish that are...

1042
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,363
Marcel!

1043
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,498
Yes?

1044
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:30,533
Marcel, we have a real problem here!

1045
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,534
It is not a problem!
It is a circle of life!

1046
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,804
The circle of life is
circling our lives right now!

1047
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:40,107
Do not move, do not panic.

1048
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,345
Shark! What?

1049
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:43,513
Shark! Jason!

1050
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,381
Okay, it's all happening, Marcel!

1051
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,716
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1052
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:47,951
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God...

1053
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:49,319
Don't worry! Wait!

1054
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,221
These are only lemon sharks!

1055
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:53,523
This is all part of the course.

1056
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:56,524
It is like life. Like in relationships.

1057
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,560
They will not attack
unless they feel attacked!

1058
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,730
Marcel, I need you to take
the French out of your mouth

1059
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,468
and tell me what to do!

1060
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,804
Don't let them see your fear.

1061
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:10,507
Okay, I think we just hold
tight, we play it cool,

1062
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,309
we don't make a move.

1063
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,410
What was that? What?

1064
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:17,411
What was that? Jason, stop...

1065
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,581
He said not to panic!
He said not to panic!

1066
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,486
I'm sitting in blood!
I'm sitting in blood!

1067
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,722
Marcel, this isn't a drill, buddy!

1068
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:28,723
You got real sharks here!
It's time to get the guns'

1069
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:30,760
and it's time to shoot some fish!

1070
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,695
Here on Eden, there are no guns!

1071
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,764
You got an American life at stake.

1072
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,765
One life is not more
important than another.

1073
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,269
What do I do?

1074
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,538
My friends and my wife left me to die.

1075
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:44,539
You must get out of
the chum, but slowly.

1076
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:46,209
Okay.

1077
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,677
Swim slowly out of the chum!

1078
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:49,245
Slowly. Slowly. Yes, yes.

1079
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,381
Slowly, baby! Stop!

1080
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,049
I don't know what to do.

1081
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,118
I don't know if I'm standing
still or I'm swimming.

1082
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,119
Swim now! Stop!

1083
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:00,790
They're torturing me!
They're playing with me!

1084
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,693
They're slow-playing me! Shoot them!

1085
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:06,694
Swim slowly.

1086
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:11,966
Swim, swim, swim.

1087
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:19,874
Save yourselves! Go to
shore! It's too late!

1088
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:25,146
They've got me! It's
only a matter of time!

1089
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:28,382
There's no sharks around you,
honey. You're safe now, baby.

1090
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:31,552
I don't know what's going through
my mind! I'd love some ice cream.

1091
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,156
What? I'd love some ice cream,

1092
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:36,157
with maybe some pecans in it!

1093
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:40,227
Couples' massage is part of
your program and so important.

1094
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,598
It gives you the chance
to bond, relax, reconnect.

1095
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,834
We prefer to bond on our own.

1096
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,338
Okay, would you prefer
male or female therapists?

1097
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:54,675
What would you recommend more for like
a nurturing, pampering, motherly energy?

1098
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,347
Would that be a man or
a woman, do you think?

1099
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:58,481
A woman.

1100
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:01,482
Well, I'm just so tight in my
shoulders. Do you have any...

1101
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,520
Let me see.

1102
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,521
We do have a male
masseur available, madam.

1103
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,360
Daddy, I can't wait to
get my drink on tonight!

1104
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:16,998
Damn! Is this whole thing
uphill? Where's the downhill part?

1105
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:21,137
We gonna get our groove
on tonight. Right, Daddy?

1106
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:24,138
Of course, baby. You know how we do it.

1107
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:26,376
Well, hello.

1108
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,377
Hi.

1109
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,280
Lucy.

1110
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:32,382
Yes.

1111
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,483
Excellent.

1112
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,951
Who are you?

1113
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:37,854
I am Xavier and I will be
your man-seur for today.

1114
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:38,888
Xavier?

1115
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,056
Yes.

1116
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:43,026
Mmm.

1117
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:45,962
Twenty, 30, 40, 50...

1118
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:49,732
Hi.

1119
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:50,800
Joey.

1120
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,568
Yes.

1121
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,836
What's your name?

1122
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,971
Gert.

1123
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:56,305
What a beautiful name.

1124
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,641
Well, thank you.

1125
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,677
Do you mind if I heat up the lotion?

1126
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,879
No. Heat that lotion up.

1127
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,880
The hotter the better.

1128
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,898
What kind of massage do
you want? You left it blank.

1129
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:23,199
Korean?

1130
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,200
Korean? I am not familiar with Korean.

1131
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:29,737
Dealer's choice. Whatever
releases the most tension.

1132
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:36,077
Mmm.

1133
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:39,113
Oh, that feels so good.

1134
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,550
Thank you.

1135
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,551
I can't tell you how much I need
this. It has been a long time.

1136
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:48,057
Oh, I love pleasuring people.

1137
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,225
So do l.

1138
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,226
I mean, it's not my job,

1139
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:56,197
but it is a job that I love
doing, if you know what I mean.

1140
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,271
I know exactly what you mean.

1141
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:05,141
So, Joey, do you have any problem areas?

1142
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:07,810
I hold a lot of tension
in my upper thighs.

1143
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,779
We'll get to your upper thighs.

1144
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,647
It's just the top of my quads.

1145
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:12,982
As a matter of fact,
if you want to do, like,

1146
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,318
the full 80 minutes on
the thighs, I'm good.

1147
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:16,586
Whatever you want.

1148
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,587
Oh, I need this. You have no idea.

1149
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,292
Oh, you got great hands.

1150
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,293
Okay, Joey, what I want you to
do for me is just close your eyes.

1151
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:30,066
Quiet that mind, okay?

1152
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:31,768
Just listen to my voice.

1153
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,769
Feel the sound slide down my throat

1154
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:40,174
and come out through my mouth.

1155
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:43,344
Down my throat, come
out through my mouth.

1156
00:54:47,351 --> 00:54:50,351
Down my throat...

1157
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,125
Keep... Keep going, keep going.

1158
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,693
Sir, I'm so sorry.

1159
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,694
No, no, no. Don't be sorry.
You shouldn't be sorry.

1160
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,865
No, I aroused you.

1161
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,534
You should be proud.

1162
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:07,136
This hasn't happened
to me in a long time.

1163
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,137
Are you attempting to have a
manual stimulation from me, sir?

1164
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,142
Am I...

1165
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,143
I am here on a couples retreat
with my wife in the other room.

1166
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:20,149
My husband Scott is just like a cat.

1167
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,450
Scott?

1168
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,187
My husband.

1169
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:27,188
I'm trying to save my marriage
here. Look what you did to me.

1170
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:29,892
Well, that wasn't my intention, sir.

1171
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,828
It wasn't mine, either,
and now I'm humiliated.

1172
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:32,962
Well, I'm sorry.

1173
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,897
You told me not to think.

1174
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,699
Well, when I don't think,
this is what happens.

1175
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,634
You can't leave me all
backed up like this.

1176
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:40,203
What do you want me to do, sir?

1177
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:42,338
I don't know. We got to
figure out a solution.

1178
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,140
You know, let's not take
anything off the table.

1179
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:47,141
Let's start brainstorming. We"re
both in a maze together, okay?

1180
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:50,813
How do we get the cheese?

1181
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,814
I'm sorry, sir, but that is
not gonna have a happy ending.

1182
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:01,422
Give me the oil.

1183
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,926
Go grab a smoke.

1184
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,732
Daddy, this is awesome!

1185
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,733
Yo, they should put me up
in a video on this bitch!

1186
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,170
Don't go chasing waterfalls

1187
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,440
Stick me in the ocean I'm
gonna make it look real good

1188
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,280
You go, girl.

1189
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:30,453
Daddy's got to ice his knee, baby, okay?

1190
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:32,755
If you just let me recharge my battery,

1191
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,591
I promise, this'll be
more for you later, okay?

1192
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,592
Technically, I was bit by a shark.

1193
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,930
Were you bit or were you nipped?

1194
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,131
I mean, if you had been bit,

1195
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,799
you probably would have lost
a great deal of blood and...

1196
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,968
What difference does it
make to you two, anyway,

1197
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,136
what you would call it?

1198
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:50,137
It hurt. And I had shark
teeth penetrate my skin.

1199
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:52,475
And besides, Jason, it's
your fault that it happened.

1200
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,076
The only reason I got
bit in the first place

1201
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,611
is because you did the worst thing

1202
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:57,780
you could possibly do in that situation.

1203
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,949
You panicked and you threw
a bucket of chum in my face.

1204
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,817
I did the prudent thing and I
got the hell out of the water.

1205
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,787
There were sharks in there,
David. What was I supposed to do?

1206
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,289
You know what? Remember
it however you want to

1207
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,090
and I'll remember it
how it actually happened.

1208
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,091
Dave. I mean, really, did
they penetrate your skin?

1209
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:12,561
Do you really need that bandage?

1210
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:15,264
Lucy, I don't know
what to tell you, okay?

1211
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:18,067
You tell me if I need the bandage.

1212
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,902
It looks like you scraped
yourself on the ladder,

1213
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,070
maybe, on the way out.

1214
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:22,171
I'm sorry?

1215
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,506
Did you get out of the water abruptly?

1216
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:26,507
Hey, I don't know how to explain
it to you. Maybe I have tough skin.

1217
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,945
Perhaps lemon sharks don't
leave that bad of a mark.

1218
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,012
Maybe they're pack animals

1219
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,781
and they're marking me
for later. I don't know.

1220
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,849
Dave, I was in a car
accident once, okay?

1221
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,518
And it was really scary, I
had nightmares. But when...

1222
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:36,819
I've been in a car accident, too.

1223
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,020
Have you ever been bit by a shark?

1224
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,256
I was never bit by a shark. I'm
just saying that I understand. My...

1225
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:42,325
Say it again. I was in a car accident.

1226
00:57:42,326 --> 00:57:43,492
No, say the last part.

1227
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,593
I was never bit by a shark.

1228
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:47,594
That's it! Then you
shouldn't talk about it.

1229
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:51,500
And I'm not gonna sit here
and try to explain myself

1230
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,003
to a bunch of black
and white suburban trash

1231
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:56,172
who don't know a damn
thing about the ocean.

1232
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:57,807
And you understand the ocean, honey?

1233
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,442
I have some real field
experience, honey, yeah.

1234
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:00,543
I had a shark attack.

1235
00:58:00,544 --> 00:58:02,511
I'm part of a very elite group.

1236
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,713
Like people who have
been struck by lightning.

1237
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:04,981
Not everyone can say
that they've had that

1238
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,650
and maybe that's what's
going on here today.

1239
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,385
You know what? I don't want
to get in an argument with it.

1240
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:11,220
I really don't. You know what?

1241
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,122
I'm really exhausted.
It's been a long day.

1242
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:16,123
I'm gonna go back to the
room. You want to come with me?

1243
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:19,462
Baby, I thought we were gonna
go to the waterfall tonight

1244
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:21,397
and have a little alone time.

1245
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:23,833
Sweetheart, I'm a shark attack survivor.

1246
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,369
I'm fried.

1247
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:29,370
Honey, I think the fear was a
lot worse than the actual attack,

1248
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,874
which I can totally appreciate,

1249
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,809
but the good news is you weren't hurt,

1250
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,078
so let's not ruin the evening over it.

1251
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,713
I'm sorry?

1252
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,582
Honey, you weren't hurt.

1253
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,851
Good night.

1254
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,252
Dave! Where you going?

1255
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,720
Dave. Come on, okay,
you got bit by the shark.

1256
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,322
You got bit, I believe you!

1257
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:49,323
We're here all the time, so let's
take that opportunity to go to bed.

1258
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,262
Honey, we'll go to
the waterfall with you.

1259
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:54,597
We'll grab our drinks and go.

1260
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:57,433
Yeah. We could all go
together. It'll be beautiful.

1261
00:58:57,434 --> 00:59:00,369
Hon? I was thinking that maybe

1262
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,605
we might go back to the room, huh?

1263
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:05,374
Bolt the door, draw the shades, huh?

1264
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,510
Just shut the whole world out

1265
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:10,511
and sit Indian-style and
really explore our feelings.

1266
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,351
Daddy! Wake up!

1267
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:17,286
It's too deep!

1268
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,287
Yo, you having a nightmare. You ain't
even in the water. It's night time.

1269
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:23,457
Look, you said we was gonna have
fun, so let's get up, let's dance,

1270
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:27,296
let's do a shot, let's
do something. Anything.

1271
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,432
Baby, let's just go back
to the room, all right?

1272
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:32,433
I don't want to go back to the
room. I don't want to go to sleep.

1273
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,470
We're not going to sleep.

1274
00:59:34,471 --> 00:59:35,638
We're not?

1275
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,206
Mmm-mmm.

1276
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:39,075
What we gonna do in there?

1277
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,577
For real?
