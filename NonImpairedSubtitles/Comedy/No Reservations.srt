1
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:45,076
<i>Some chefs call them "lovebirds,"
a romantic dish for that special occasion.</i>

2
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:52,760
<i>Properly cooked,
they're as tender as butter.</i>

3
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,795
<i>They can be roasted,
stuffed with wild rice or barley...</i>

4
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,748
<i>...or you can broil them, poach them...</i>

5
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,917
<i>...barbecue them,
and even braise them.</i>

6
00:01:02,113 --> 00:01:05,245
<i>But there's no greater sin
than to overcook a quail.</i>

7
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:10,398
<i>Perfectly cooked, it must have
a touch of pink on the breast.</i>

8
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:14,685
<i>But you need the right quail. It has
to be fleshy or it dries out too easily.</i>

9
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:16,640
<i>I prefer to serve them roasted.</i>

10
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,095
That makes their taste richer
and more robust.

11
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:22,661
And a side of truffle ravioli
and wild mushrooms...

12
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:25,059
...goes deliciously well with them.

13
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:27,969
Of course, you can also cook
them in a pig's bladder...

14
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:30,786
...in a mix of Madeira and cognac.

15
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:35,208
You see, the bladder helps protect
the quail, keeps it moist.

16
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:39,680
You could serve it with a tender sauce
of thyme, spring onions...

17
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:42,054
...caramelized shallots, truffles.

18
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:44,903
Truffles go perfectly
with almost any quail dish...

19
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,970
...because they elevate
the delicate taste.

20
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:50,372
Are you feeling okay?

21
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:53,476
I'm fine. Go on.

22
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:57,956
They wonderfully elevate
the delicate taste of the quail.

23
00:01:58,256 --> 00:02:01,158
But you have to really
be able to afford truffles...

24
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:03,913
...otherwise you just
better forget about it.

25
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:06,896
- Now, for a appetizer, I suggest...
- Kate, would you mind...

26
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,506
...if I change the subject for a moment?
- No.

27
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:12,595
Why do you come to see me
every week?

28
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:15,788
My boss said she'd fire me
if I didn't get therapy.

29
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:19,338
And why do you think
she thinks you need therapy?

30
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,069
Why?

31
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,019
You know what?

32
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,999
I haven't the faintest idea.

33
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:43,506
Ordering two tasting menus.
Fire two amuse-bouche.

34
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:47,004
Leah, I need a quail and a Dover sole
for table nine.

35
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:50,711
I'm still waiting on those beef
tenderloins. Where are they? Pick up!

36
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,828
Terrine, carpaccio.

37
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:58,391
Excuse me, you should know
Hal Reeves says the lamb...

38
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,658
...has never been so good before.
- Really? And what would he know?

39
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:05,337
Kate, the Petersons are here. They
wanna tell you how brilliant you are.

40
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:08,288
- Brilliant chefs belong in the kitchen.
- At least say hello.

41
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:10,720
You know they're some
of my best customers.

42
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:13,817
In a minute. Just don't cook them
too long, because they get...

43
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,126
- They get tough, I know.
- No, dry. Dry, Leah.

44
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:17,886
I get tough. Quail get dry.

45
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:20,767
Kate, I wanna go
over the menu for next week.

46
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:23,132
Later, okay?

47
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:32,962
<i>You're a magician, Kate.</i>

48
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,682
And you know my husband sings
your praises constantly.

49
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,606
In fact, it's hard not to be jealous.

50
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,520
I worship anyone
who can surprise my palate.

51
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:42,821
It's always a pleasure
to cook for you both.

52
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,224
- We'll see you next week, right?
- Of course.

53
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:47,363
- Good night.
- Good night.

54
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:56,074
Nice to see you.

55
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:58,214
I'm telling you
it's not cooked properly.

56
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:00,872
- May I ask what this is about?
- Kate, I'll handle this.

57
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:02,534
- I take it you're the chef?
- Yes.

58
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:05,357
- There's something I'd like to show you.
- Don't do this.

59
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:07,889
My wife's foie gras
hasn't been cooked long enough.

60
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,742
- Excuse me?
- Why don't I bring you...

61
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:13,071
...a new appetizer with my compliments?
- It's cooked just fine.

62
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:16,465
Nothing to be ashamed of, honey.
Even the best stumble over foie gras.

63
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:19,695
<i>There's nothing wrong with this.
It's precisely comme il faut.</i>

64
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,928
<i>- What is that supposed to mean?
- Comme il faut? "As it should be. "</i>

65
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:26,444
140 degrees in the oven, 80 degrees
water temperature, for 25 minutes...

66
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:29,912
...not too long, not too short,
with the perfect touch of pink, honey.

67
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:33,335
That's it.
We'll take our business somewhere else.

68
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:35,056
Let's go.

69
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:40,915
May I suggest Vinnie's hot dog stand
at the corner? He cooks to order.

70
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,402
<i>How many times have I told you?</i>

71
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:47,572
You can't make a scene every time
someone doesn't like your food.

72
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:50,262
- Please. The guy's a barbarian.
- And a paying customer.

73
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:52,568
If he says the foie gras
is not done, it's not.

74
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:55,188
- Foie gras is cruelty to animals.
- Stay out of this.

75
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:59,354
I swear to God, if you weren't one of the
better chefs in this city, I'd fire you.

76
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,555
One of the better chefs?
What's that supposed to mean?

77
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:04,696
I bet she's just saying that
to annoy me.

78
00:05:06,242 --> 00:05:08,829
She's just saying that to annoy me.

79
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:11,099
- Isn't she?
- Whatever you say, chef.

80
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:48,041
<i>Mailbox one. You have no messages.</i>

81
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:05,162
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good, Frank.

82
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:06,988
Got some nice lobsters from Maine.

83
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:09,358
That one's a little too small.
Try this one.

84
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:12,687
Yeah, yeah. Have them delivered
by 2:30, okay?

85
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,924
And send those scrawny ones
to La Fontaine.

86
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,711
Kate! Who's your best friend?

87
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:20,243
- You got it?
- Did you ask me to?

88
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:22,128
Golden tilefish?

89
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,624
- Bob!
- Just for you.

90
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:28,566
- It's beautiful.
- Beautiful golden tilefish, line-caught.

91
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,037
- Beautiful.
- Give me a kiss.

92
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,087
- Bob.
- Give me a kiss.

93
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:36,147
- Hey! Hey! How come I didn't get a kiss?
- How come you didn't get a kiss?

94
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:37,656
You ain't got the goods.

95
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,055
- What's this?
- I don't see any golden tilefish.

96
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,701
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.</i>

97
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:55,797
I'm just checking in.
We should be there about 9.

98
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,877
<i>Great, so I'll make sure
I'm back by then.</i>

99
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:01,461
Okay, cool. So, what are you doing?
Reading a recipe, right?

100
00:07:02,497 --> 00:07:05,563
Christine, don't be ridiculous.
I do have other interests.

101
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:07,583
<i>Of course you do. Name one.</i>

102
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,950
<i>- How's Zoe?
- Adorable.</i>

103
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:13,115
She's changed so much
since you saw her last.

104
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,650
- Haven't you, sweetheart?
- I don't know.

105
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:18,692
<i>- So, what do you guys want for dinner?
- Don't worry about us.</i>

106
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:21,885
- We'll just grab a pizza or something.
- I don't think so.

107
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:25,021
<i>- So, what does Zoe like these days?
- She eats anything.</i>

108
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:27,591
- She's a vacuum cleaner.
- Mom.

109
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:30,686
I'll call you when we get closer.
Say bye to your Aunt Kate.

110
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,769
- Bye, Aunt Kate.
- Bye, Aunt Kate.

111
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:41,833
- Hey, Kate. Did you just get in?
- No, I forgot something.

112
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:43,489
- How are you?
- Good.

113
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,917
Are you working tonight?
I know this great little Thai place.

114
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:49,059
Actually, I am.
Just for a couple of hours.

115
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,237
My sister's coming into town
with my niece.

116
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:53,643
I don't give up that easily.
One of these days...

117
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,229
...I'm gonna convince you
to have dinner with me.

118
00:07:56,431 --> 00:08:00,523
Look, Sean, I think you should know
I don't generally do that.

119
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,910
- What, have dinner?
- Dinner dates.

120
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:06,480
- How about breakfast?
- You live in my building.

121
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:10,384
I don't generally go out with people
in my building. As a rule.

122
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,911
You seem to have a lot of rules.

123
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,986
Didn't you say you forgot something?

124
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:22,451
- Oh, thanks. Right.
- You're welcome.

125
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,489
<i>So, what's the problem
with having rules?</i>

126
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:40,530
It's not as if I'm controlling
or anything.

127
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,837
I just prefer things
to be done exactly right.

128
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:45,819
That's why I usually end up
doing everything myself.

129
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:50,683
Do you have any idea how complicated
it is to coordinate 40 dishes at once?

130
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:53,084
I hope you like scallops.

131
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:56,638
I thought we agreed you
weren't gonna cook for me anymore.

132
00:08:56,863 --> 00:09:00,093
I didn't cook it for you,
I just tried some new ideas.

133
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,296
Who else am I gonna give it to?

134
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,235
Now, we're gonna try
something new this week.

135
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:10,937
I'm going to ask you questions,
and you're gonna answer them.

136
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:14,850
How long ago
was your last relationship?

137
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,559
Isn't that a little personal?

138
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,219
Well, this is therapy.

139
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:22,299
How long?

140
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:25,564
I don't know. Three years ago.
Maybe four.

141
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:28,288
- Who ended it?
- I did.

142
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,619
- He was getting way too demanding.
- How so?

143
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:36,481
Well, if you must know, after two years
he wanted to move in together.

144
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:39,432
Did you try the saffron sauce?

145
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:42,856
And, I'm sorry, what's so bad
about moving in together?

146
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:46,186
He asked me to give up
my apartment.

147
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:48,137
Why would I wanna do that?

148
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:50,211
I'd move out,
we'd get a place together...

149
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:53,197
...he'd eventually leave,
then where would I be?

150
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:55,017
My God.

151
00:09:55,791 --> 00:10:00,102
- The sauce is so good.
- Thank you.

152
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:06,735
- Where's my lobster for table 12?
- Plating, chef.

153
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:09,897
I'm an actress
and I don't do naked bondage movies.

154
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:13,678
The world is so full of pervs.
That guy at table 10 is the worst.

155
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:15,502
Every week a new bimbo.

156
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,792
I swear, he leers at my tits
one more time, he's gonna regret it.

157
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:23,788
Damn it, Carlos!
Watch where you're going.

158
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,779
- Pay attention, everybody.
- Sorry, chef.

159
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:27,732
Fire two lobsters right away.
Hold the nine.

160
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,864
- I'm really sorry about that.
- Just don't let it happen again.

161
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,683
Now you're gonna run out of lobster
right after I leave.

162
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:38,040
Kate, we're not gonna run out
of anything, we're fine. Hydrate.

163
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:39,664
You're a mom already.

164
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:42,038
Well, I've gotta practice
while I can, right?

165
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:43,894
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

166
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:49,946
Someone get the phone.

167
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:54,488
- Kitchen.
- Lf it's my sister, tell her she said 9...

168
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,248
...can't make it any sooner.

169
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,934
- It's for you.
- Take a message.

170
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:01,405
Kate...

171
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:03,868
...I think you better take this.

172
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,418
- Hello.
- One's done.

173
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:10,367
Speaking.

174
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:52,072
Ms. Armstrong? I'm Dr. Burton.
We spoke on the phone.

175
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,981
Zoe's doing great.
She's gonna be fine.

176
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,415
Has anyone told her yet?

177
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:02,154
We thought it would be best for her
to hear it from someone in the family.

178
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:04,742
Do you know how
we can reach Zoe's father?

179
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,313
He's never been...

180
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:10,098
I don't even know his name.

181
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:13,260
<i>Dr. Burton to Emergency, please.
Paging Dr. Burton...</i>

182
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,217
I'm so sorry.

183
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:20,143
I have to go, but I'll be back to check
on her in just a little bit, okay?

184
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:44,891
Hello, Zoe.

185
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:47,706
Where's Mom?

186
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:52,436
Is she dead?

187
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:57,784
She is, isn't she?

188
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:02,680
Yes.

189
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:29,791
<i>You have one new message.</i>

190
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:32,704
<i>- Hi, it's me.
- And me!</i>

191
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:34,946
<i>We just wanted you to know
we're running late.</i>

192
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:38,474
<i>Traffic's insane.
We'll get there eventually. Bye.</i>

193
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:40,613
<i>End of messages.</i>

194
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:52,714
Now, this is a beautiful
2002 Dolcetto.

195
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:54,536
Any idea where it might be from?

196
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:57,736
- Probably Piedmont.
- South Australia. Adelaide Hills.

197
00:13:57,935 --> 00:14:01,799
If Kate doesn't find a replacement soon,
I'll have this baby behind the stove.

198
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:04,303
I think that would be
a health-code violation.

199
00:14:04,497 --> 00:14:08,011
Bernadette. Look at the color
of this wine. It's absolutely beautiful.

200
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:10,066
And it's ready to drink...

201
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:20,492
Give me three words
to describe this wine. Three words.

202
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,636
Did you know she was coming in?

203
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:28,375
Kate, what are you doing?

204
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,845
What do you mean?

205
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:32,528
I thought you were gonna take
a few days off.

206
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:35,096
- No.
- Are you sure?

207
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:37,271
Yeah.

208
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,649
Give me one duck, two beef rare,
and a rack of lamb.

209
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:45,298
I'm still waiting
on those tenderloins of beef.

210
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,711
Pick up.

211
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:50,074
I need a quail and a Dover sole
for table nine. Okay, let's go, guys.

212
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:53,685
Come on, let's move it.
Terrine, carpaccio.

213
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,708
Carlos, I need more pans, pronto.

214
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:58,904
- Five minutes on the lobster.
- Cleanup right away on table 13.

215
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,593
Fire one rare steak on the fly.

216
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:04,695
Two duck breast, two rack of lamb.
Let's go, people.

217
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:08,095
Why is there no food on the counter?
Come on, we got tables!

218
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,386
Where's my soufflé for 14?

219
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:20,707
<i>Dear Kate, the baby is gorgeous.</i>

220
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,342
<i>I've called her Zoe,
which means "life. "</i>

221
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:28,353
<i>Now she's here, I'm beginning
to get what a huge thing...</i>

222
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,308
<i>...it is I'm doing on my own.</i>

223
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:33,952
<i>So I want you to know
if anything should ever happen to me...</i>

224
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:37,449
<i>...you are the only person
I would want to have her.</i>

225
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:41,515
<i>I know you'll love my baby
the same way I would.</i>

226
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,451
<i>Listen to me,
it must be the three-day blues.</i>

227
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:48,969
<i>I love you, sis. Christine.</i>

228
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:04,365
Kate...

229
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,401
...I want you to take a week off.

230
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:11,818
That's not a suggestion, it's an order.

231
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:24,914
<i>What's up, Doc?</i>

232
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:29,487
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Wile E. Coyote, genius.</i>

233
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,834
Hello, Zoe.

234
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,935
<i>I'm sorry, Mac, the lady of the house
ain't home and besides...</i>

235
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:36,178
<i>...we mailed your refund check
last week.</i>

236
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:38,362
I cooked us something tasty.

237
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:40,337
I'm not hungry.

238
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:43,092
Okay.

239
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,867
You know, you can leave on Friday.
You know that?

240
00:16:56,064 --> 00:16:57,493
Yes.

241
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:06,750
Zoe, you and I have to talk
about what's gonna happen.

242
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,512
Can I go back home?

243
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,098
I'm afraid not.

244
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:14,268
Why not?

245
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:18,340
Well, you'd be alone there.

246
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,625
Your mom asked me
to take care of you.

247
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,955
So you'll be coming home
with me, okay?

248
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:03,344
So the kitchen
is just to the right there.

249
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:05,519
The living room.

250
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:10,450
This is my bedroom and the bathroom.

251
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:13,392
This will be your bedroom.

252
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:50,139
<i>We'll have sunshine today.
It's cold, a high of 36.</i>

253
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:57,238
Her name is Nelly. I've had her
since I was 3. She has a whole family.

254
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,726
You should see all my other animals.

255
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:07,777
Zoe, dinner's ready!

256
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:09,345
Okay.

257
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:15,421
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

258
00:19:22,054 --> 00:19:23,331
Everything all right?

259
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:27,937
What's the matter?
Aren't you hungry?

260
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:31,685
Can I go back to my room?

261
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:34,243
Sure.

262
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:51,524
Zoe, I have to stop by the restaurant
for a couple of minutes.

263
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,180
Will you be okay here on your own
for a little while?

264
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:55,977
- Yes.
- Now, if you need me...

265
00:19:56,175 --> 00:20:00,486
...just press one, that's my cell phone,
and two, that's the restaurant, okay?

266
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,584
It's only a few blocks away, so if you
need me I can be back here in no time.

267
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,340
- All right?
- Okay.

268
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,578
I won't be long.

269
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:46,259
Hi, Kate.

270
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,042
He says, "Look! Look at the stars!

271
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:57,624
Gaze at the stars which tremble
with love. "

272
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,450
Hello, chef.

273
00:21:00,513 --> 00:21:01,942
Oh, my God, it's you.

274
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:06,043
I am begging you, will you please tell me
the secret of your saffron sauce?

275
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:08,126
Excuse me?

276
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,705
Listen to this, guys.
Listen to this right here.

277
00:21:12,932 --> 00:21:14,426
Listen.

278
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:18,916
He's saying, "Fade the stars,
fade all the stars. "

279
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,981
So you guys are my string section.

280
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:30,504
He says, "In the morning
I am going to wake. "

281
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,721
"This is our love. "

282
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,452
Now, everybody. "Win our love. "

283
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:58,185
All right, all right. Back to work!

284
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:02,255
Who do you think you are?

285
00:22:03,346 --> 00:22:04,972
Nicholas Palmer.

286
00:22:05,202 --> 00:22:09,775
And may I just say the world
would be a dark and depressing place...

287
00:22:10,003 --> 00:22:12,305
...without your quail in truffle sauce.

288
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:15,850
We need to talk.

289
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:20,020
- You could've at least asked me.
- I'm sorry. I couldn't wait.

290
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,833
Nick became available.
I had to act quickly.

291
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,869
The last thing I need right now
is some lunatic in my kitchen.

292
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:29,618
He's not a lunatic. He's exuberant. God
knows we could use that around here.

293
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:32,949
Exuberant? Are you kidding me?
The guy thinks he's Pavarotti.

294
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,033
Good evening.
Do you have a reservation?

295
00:22:35,226 --> 00:22:37,398
- Yes, Matthews.
- Matthews. Yes.

296
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:39,635
May I take your coats, please?

297
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,379
Let me show you to your table.
Excuse me.

298
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:47,735
Your waiter will be right over.

299
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,301
The only demand I had
when I took this position...

300
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:52,284
...was I get to choose
who I work with.

301
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:55,578
- Leah would have been just fine.
- Leah can barely stand up anymore.

302
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:58,013
If I push her, she's gonna fall over.

303
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,430
Holding her crotch and chopping
at the same time! Give him a chance.

304
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,667
- Nick is excellent.
- I know nothing about him.

305
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:10,843
- I have no idea what...
- Give me some credit.

306
00:23:11,011 --> 00:23:13,467
- He was the sous-chef at II Treviso.
- Italian?

307
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:17,793
You bring a sous-chef from an Italian
restaurant, and I'm the one in therapy?

308
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:21,179
We were lucky to get him.
Peninsula offered him executive chef.

309
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:22,494
Why didn't he take it?

310
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:25,183
Because he said he wanted
to work with you.

311
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:06,543
Zoe.

312
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:17,778
<i>Funny thing to me about being in these
cabs is when you're in Manhattan...</i>

313
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:21,455
<i>...for some reason you don't get scared
no matter how fast you're going.</i>

314
00:24:21,654 --> 00:24:26,609
<i>Well, you know, he's driving fast
and recklessly. He's a professional.</i>

315
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:31,182
<i>He's got a cab-driver's license,
I can see it right there.</i>

316
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:34,223
<i>I don't even know what it takes
to get a cab-driver's license.</i>

317
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:36,498
<i>I think all you need is a face.</i>

318
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:41,113
<i>This seems to be
their big qualification.</i>

319
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:44,624
<i>No blank heads are allowed
driving cabs in this town.</i>

320
00:25:51,598 --> 00:25:54,795
Kate, wake up.

321
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,767
Kate.

322
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:01,325
School starts at 9.

323
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:04,391
It's 8:20.

324
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:12,814
Oh, no.

325
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:17,521
Oh, jeez. Okay, let's get dressed,
come on. Oh, you're dressed.

326
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:19,375
Okay, okay, one minute.

327
00:26:20,374 --> 00:26:23,309
Do you need supplies or anything?
Like pens or paper?

328
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,168
They usually have those things.

329
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,259
I made your lunch yesterday.
I hope you like duck.

330
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,584
Okay, come on! Let's go.

331
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:36,720
- I can't find my scarf.
- Don't worry about it.

332
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:39,770
I can't have you late for your
first day of school. Let's go.

333
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,103
- I need my scarf.
- Zoe, just use one of mine.

334
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,209
We'll find yours later, all right?

335
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:49,203
Let's go find your scarf.

336
00:26:54,495 --> 00:26:56,219
Here it is.

337
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:00,826
Is this it?

338
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,408
- That's it.
- Great.

339
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:11,644
That was easy.

340
00:27:13,092 --> 00:27:14,270
Let's go.

341
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:18,241
Okay.

342
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:21,662
Your lunch.

343
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,963
Could you get that, please?

344
00:27:31,145 --> 00:27:32,552
Why didn't you get the door?

345
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:35,113
I'm not supposed to answer
the door for strangers.

346
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:38,176
Right. Yeah, that's smart.

347
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:40,386
- Hi, Sean.
- Any chance for some coffee?

348
00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:43,588
- I've just run out.
- Sure. We're running a little late but...

349
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,796
Just one second.

350
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,096
Good morning. I'm Sean.
I live downstairs.

351
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:52,201
You must be Kate's niece.

352
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,377
Zoe, right?

353
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:03,149
My kids are about your age.

354
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:07,914
They'll be staying with me this weekend.
Are you gonna be around?

355
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:11,628
Here you go.

356
00:28:11,828 --> 00:28:13,454
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

357
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:15,409
- The good stuff.
- Yeah.

358
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:19,086
All right, let's go.

359
00:28:19,414 --> 00:28:20,396
Quickly.

360
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,476
Thank you
for the Thai noodles last night.

361
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:24,273
- No problem.
- That was really nice.

362
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,808
- I guess this is where you go in, right?
- I don't know.

363
00:28:39,003 --> 00:28:41,370
Right. Come on.

364
00:28:47,485 --> 00:28:49,111
It's gonna be fine.

365
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:51,961
Ms. Armstrong?
I'm Ellen Parker, the principal.

366
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,817
- Kate.
- You must be Zoe.

367
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:55,706
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hello.

368
00:28:55,904 --> 00:28:59,068
I'll take you to the classroom
and we'll meet your teacher.

369
00:29:03,905 --> 00:29:06,044
<i>There has to be someone
better suited for this.</i>

370
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:10,718
I have no idea what to do with a kid,
especially one who's lost her mother.

371
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:12,890
How do their minds work?

372
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:15,875
I can't get Zoe to eat anything I make.

373
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:20,227
- What am I supposed to do, force her?
- Maybe she misses her mother's cooking.

374
00:29:20,422 --> 00:29:22,310
My sister never cooked.

375
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:25,379
- She reheated.
- Well, that's the point.

376
00:29:25,576 --> 00:29:30,792
Maybe Zoe needs something
more familiar, less sophisticated.

377
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:32,709
What did you eat
when you were a kid?

378
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:36,325
- It's not the same.
- What do you mean?

379
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,790
My mother was an amazing cook.

380
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,224
Of course, I was the only one
who appreciated it.

381
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:45,577
And after your mother passed away,
did your father take over the cooking?

382
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:49,124
No. He didn't take over anything.

383
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:52,876
We were lucky if we even saw him
at dinner.

384
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:57,702
- So who took care of the two of you?
- Can we not get into this right now?

385
00:29:58,544 --> 00:30:00,038
Okay.

386
00:30:02,513 --> 00:30:05,132
What about fish sticks?
Kids love them.

387
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:07,919
Fish sticks?

388
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:10,222
Yeah, you know, they're frozen
and breaded...

389
00:30:10,387 --> 00:30:12,176
I know what fish sticks are.

390
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:16,019
I just can't believe I'm paying
for these suggestions.

391
00:30:17,686 --> 00:30:19,148
Fish sticks.

392
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,001
- Did you learn anything interesting?
- No.

393
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:47,191
- Anything uninteresting?
- No.

394
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:50,073
- How was your teacher?
- Bald.

395
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:53,243
Well, that's interesting.

396
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,623
Fish sticks.

397
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:03,487
You know, I was thinking the other day,
I know so little about you.

398
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:07,741
I mean, we're family, but I don't
even know what your favorite color is.

399
00:31:07,938 --> 00:31:12,096
- Red.
- Red? See, I didn't know that.

400
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:15,292
I love red. Red's a great color.

401
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:20,771
- What's your favorite number?
- You know, you don't have to do this.

402
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:23,326
Do what?

403
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:25,409
Try so hard.

404
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,624
Coming!

405
00:31:36,554 --> 00:31:38,049
Hi, I'm Charlotte.

406
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:44,010
- From the agency?
- You expecting another Charlotte?

407
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:49,636
No.

408
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:55,016
So can I come in or what?

409
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,803
Oh, sure. Come on in.

410
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:04,272
Excuse me one second.

411
00:32:07,507 --> 00:32:10,410
I told you, I don't need a babysitter.
I'm not a baby anymore.

412
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:13,547
So, what am I supposed to do?
I can't leave you here alone.

413
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:15,146
Why not? I'm perfectly fine.

414
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:17,935
Zoe, you barricaded the door,
remember?

415
00:32:18,518 --> 00:32:21,104
I charge from when I get here,
you know.

416
00:32:21,303 --> 00:32:22,896
Yeah.

417
00:32:23,127 --> 00:32:25,429
I see you've brought
something to read to Zoe.

418
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:26,867
It's for my thesis.

419
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:31,670
Rapidly mutating deadly viruses.
You know, like Ebola, that sort of thing.

420
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:39,162
Well, have fun at work.

421
00:32:41,724 --> 00:32:44,114
22 Bleecker, can I help you?

422
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:48,692
Table for five?
Yes, I can seat you at 9.

423
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:51,544
- I know.
- Yes.

424
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:56,155
How do you want the sea bass
prepared tonight?

425
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:59,648
Tell them they're gonna be served
to some very important people.

426
00:33:03,842 --> 00:33:06,876
- You don't like music?
- It's distracting my staff.

427
00:33:07,074 --> 00:33:10,785
Nick, you were right.
Pavarotti makes sex so much better.

428
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:15,268
Glad to hear it. Bocelli's good too,
but only for shallow one-night stands.

429
00:33:18,854 --> 00:33:20,764
Pronto. Food. Belly. Now.

430
00:33:22,182 --> 00:33:24,158
Thank you. Thank you.

431
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:29,954
Me plus baby
equals extra large portions, please.

432
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,360
Bernadette. Bernadette.

433
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:37,730
That's it.

434
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,086
David, Richard.
It's gonna be, I think, all men.

435
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,913
I think I can handle it.

436
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:45,254
Good luck.

437
00:33:45,453 --> 00:33:46,762
John.

438
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:50,764
- Chef.
- No, thank you.

439
00:33:51,022 --> 00:33:52,451
Delicious, chef.

440
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,718
Only a full cook can judge food.
When you're hungry, everything tastes...

441
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,921
...better than it really is.
- I never eat in the afternoon.

442
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,163
My grandmother whispered this recipe
into my ear on her deathbed.

443
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:23,825
She brought it over from the Old Country
and I made it especially for you today.

444
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:40,634
- Happy?
- Very happy.

445
00:34:44,412 --> 00:34:46,933
I thought your grandmother
lived in Miami.

446
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:48,948
Well, you know...

447
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,352
Well, we all thought she wasn't
gonna make it. It was like a miracle.

448
00:35:01,857 --> 00:35:03,767
It was a miracle.

449
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:08,894
You take care of those dishes
and I'll take care of these.

450
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:12,866
- Then we won't get in each other's way.
- Wait, your half is bigger than mine.

451
00:35:13,093 --> 00:35:14,620
Right, right, right.

452
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,315
I have some very big items.

453
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:20,096
I got beef, I got fish, I got rabbit.

454
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,465
Showtime, folks! Let's go.

455
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:30,597
Fifteen, two terrines,
one Dover sole, two lamb.

456
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:33,062
Seven, carpaccio.

457
00:35:34,762 --> 00:35:36,835
- Have you seasoned that right?
- Yes, chef.

458
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:42,917
It's okay.

459
00:36:03,858 --> 00:36:07,852
- Okay, where am I? Where's my lamb?
- Slicing it now.

460
00:36:08,531 --> 00:36:10,092
One second. One second.

461
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:48,344
- Pardon me.
- I need that.

462
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,103
And you'll get it right back.

463
00:36:55,232 --> 00:36:58,232
- Can I ask you something?
- Do I have a choice?

464
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,462
Where did you learn to cook so well?

465
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:04,668
My mother.

466
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:07,290
Seriously? I thought
you were gonna say you studied...

467
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,849
...under Alain Passard at L'Arpège
or something.

468
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:14,780
I did. But my mom was better,
and she didn't throw plates at me.

469
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:31,106
Oh, God. I need more space.

470
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:42,343
- Why are you so mad at me?
- I'm not mad at you.

471
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:44,683
You're very mad.

472
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:48,041
Look, this is my kitchen.
I've worked really hard to get here...

473
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:50,605
...and I'm not gonna let you
take it away from me.

474
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:54,308
What makes you think
I wanna take it away?

475
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,749
What else could you possibly want?

476
00:37:59,472 --> 00:38:01,261
<i>You treat me like a dog, Larry.</i>

477
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:05,864
I'm not a dog. I'm a human being!
A human being, goddamn...

478
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:08,688
I'm sorry, I have an audition.

479
00:38:08,883 --> 00:38:10,345
Would you mind?

480
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:28,051
Look, I don't need this job.
I can work wherever I want.

481
00:38:28,248 --> 00:38:31,959
I'd like to work here because
it's an honor to cook with you...

482
00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:34,871
...but I'd rather work
somewhere I'm welcome.

483
00:38:35,098 --> 00:38:38,776
So if you want me to go,
you just say the word.

484
00:38:40,923 --> 00:38:43,160
Want to tell me
what's going on in here?

485
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,178
Well?

486
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,814
Wait a minute, where are you going?

487
00:38:50,974 --> 00:38:52,982
I'm sorry,
you'll have to find someone else.

488
00:38:53,183 --> 00:38:55,802
- Kate, what have you done?
- I didn't do anything.

489
00:38:56,896 --> 00:38:59,165
Nick, please. We need you.

490
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,564
Well, I'll have to hear that from her.

491
00:39:01,857 --> 00:39:03,548
It's my restaurant.

492
00:39:03,746 --> 00:39:06,300
It may be your restaurant, Paula,
but it's her kitchen.

493
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:08,540
Without her...

494
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:13,376
...all this would just be a pile
of hot metal and dirty dishes, so...

495
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:15,805
She decides.

496
00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:17,891
Kate.

497
00:39:24,391 --> 00:39:26,050
Seems you've left me no choice.

498
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:30,912
- Do you want me to stay?
- Didn't I just say that?

499
00:39:32,425 --> 00:39:33,734
I didn't hear those words.

500
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:37,984
I want you to stay.

501
00:39:38,187 --> 00:39:41,221
Love to. Thought you'd never ask.

502
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,031
You're on fire.

503
00:40:19,446 --> 00:40:23,189
And I know you guys are scared,
but it's okay, because I'm here.

504
00:40:23,383 --> 00:40:27,759
But if you get really scared, you can
wake me up and I'll hold your hand.

505
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,863
Especially you, Louie,
because you're the littlest.

506
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:32,374
Zoe?

507
00:40:32,954 --> 00:40:34,383
Hi.

508
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,287
When did Charlotte leave?

509
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:41,872
I don't know. A while ago.

510
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:49,460
Looks so cozy in there.

511
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:00,249
I have an idea.

512
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:07,070
How about you come with me
to the restaurant tomorrow night?

513
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:19,035
Night.

514
00:41:19,846 --> 00:41:21,090
Night.

515
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:53,283
Please.

516
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:08,145
I've tried everything. No matter
what I make, she doesn't eat it.

517
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,925
Why not try giving her
some regular kid food?

518
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:13,964
Have you been talking to my therapist?

519
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:22,895
All right, two foie gras, one tartare,
two bisque and a goat cheese.

520
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:37,744
Breathe in.

521
00:42:39,612 --> 00:42:40,659
<i>It's basilico.</i>

522
00:42:56,608 --> 00:43:00,951
Kate. Kate, your biggest fans
are dying to see you.

523
00:43:08,643 --> 00:43:11,327
Leah, finish the duck on table five?
I gotta take a break.

524
00:43:11,524 --> 00:43:12,931
Yeah, sure.

525
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:31,846
All right, I need one terrine, two bisque
and a langoustine, please.

526
00:43:40,715 --> 00:43:41,795
Good.

527
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,072
Table 12's getting a little antsy.
Will it be up soon?

528
00:43:49,806 --> 00:43:51,051
Hold this.

529
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:03,021
Fire one duck,
one sea bass and a soufflé, please.

530
00:44:14,324 --> 00:44:15,917
It's working now, chef.

531
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:19,212
Table five's coming up
in a few seconds, chef.

532
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,452
Save some for me.

533
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:24,949
You know, in ancient Rome...

534
00:44:25,495 --> 00:44:28,878
...guys used to chew basil
before the prom to get rid of bad breath.

535
00:44:29,496 --> 00:44:30,806
It's true.

536
00:44:47,453 --> 00:44:48,631
<i>Thank you.</i>

537
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:57,016
- They didn't have proms in ancient Rome.
- They didn't? Are you sure?

538
00:44:59,745 --> 00:45:01,338
I thought they did.

539
00:45:09,923 --> 00:45:12,706
- See you tomorrow.
- Thanks, Leah.

540
00:45:31,785 --> 00:45:34,022
- Good night.
- Good night.

541
00:46:22,423 --> 00:46:24,245
Where are you going?

542
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,571
- Hi, Bob.
- Hi, Kate. How you doing?

543
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,746
- Good. What you got?
- I got fresh bluefin.

544
00:46:37,947 --> 00:46:41,625
Just came in like five minutes ago.
I got baby mollusks over there.

545
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,609
What's behind you there?

546
00:46:43,805 --> 00:46:46,326
- Colorados.
- Yeah, I'm gonna take some of those.

547
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:48,860
Unbelievably fresh. Look at this.

548
00:46:54,655 --> 00:46:57,307
<i>Good morning, it's 24 degrees,
sunny at 9:00...</i>

549
00:46:57,504 --> 00:46:59,610
<i>...on this Tuesday, February 28th.</i>

550
00:47:03,137 --> 00:47:04,599
Zoe.

551
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:06,112
Zoe. Zoe. Zoe.

552
00:47:06,274 --> 00:47:07,551
Wake up.

553
00:47:07,715 --> 00:47:11,578
You're gonna be late for school. Here are
your boots. Come on. Let's go, let's go.

554
00:47:15,877 --> 00:47:18,266
Just tell them it was my fault, okay?

555
00:47:28,232 --> 00:47:31,430
Ladies, you are very lucky today.
I have new shipment.

556
00:47:31,626 --> 00:47:35,587
They are from all over the place.
Modena, Montferrato, Bologna.

557
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,307
Big sniff.
It's a black truffle from Parma.

558
00:47:38,507 --> 00:47:39,685
It's not bad.

559
00:47:41,004 --> 00:47:44,038
- What do you have in white?
- My best product.

560
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,369
Very, very hard
to find this time of year.

561
00:47:50,862 --> 00:47:54,180
- Who'd you get them from?
- You know I never reveal my sources.

562
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:57,161
- So how much for the white?
- Twenty-two hundred a pound.

563
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,727
- Oh, my God.
- They are from Alba.

564
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:02,475
No, no, no.
I think my water just broke.

565
00:48:02,673 --> 00:48:05,041
- What? You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not kidding you.

566
00:48:05,202 --> 00:48:07,920
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- I don't know.

567
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:10,418
- Can you call 911?
- No, no, no. No police.

568
00:48:10,611 --> 00:48:13,961
It's not the police. We need
an ambulance, she's having a baby.

569
00:48:14,165 --> 00:48:16,948
Oh, my God.
Okay, just keep relaxed.

570
00:48:17,173 --> 00:48:19,629
We have pregnant lady,
Bleecker and Charles.

571
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,514
22 Bleecker Street.
Her water just broke.

572
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:25,646
- 22 Bleecker on the corner of Charles.
- Bernadette!

573
00:48:25,848 --> 00:48:27,474
Okay, thank you.

574
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,559
Breathe, yes.

575
00:48:32,793 --> 00:48:34,135
Breathe.

576
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:51,796
Oh, no!

577
00:48:59,393 --> 00:49:03,801
Just on the left. You see the steps?
Here. Stop! Stop! Just wait.

578
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,457
Oh, Zoe.

579
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:14,619
- I'm so sorry.
- You forgot me.

580
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:17,058
- It's not what you think.
- You forgot me.

581
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,643
Leah had her baby,
I had to take her to the hospital.

582
00:49:19,846 --> 00:49:21,253
But you still forgot me.

583
00:49:22,022 --> 00:49:24,925
Okay, I forgot you.

584
00:49:25,736 --> 00:49:26,751
And I'm so sorry.

585
00:49:29,544 --> 00:49:32,578
Come on, Zoe. Let's go home.

586
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,873
Zoe, come on, it's freezing out here.

587
00:49:38,027 --> 00:49:40,199
Zoe. Move it!

588
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:20,633
Zoe, I'm sorry. I totally blew it.

589
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:22,777
I know I'm doing everything wrong.

590
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,659
But I'm doing my best, okay?

591
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:36,413
Why don't you think of something
I can do to make it up to you?

592
00:50:38,919 --> 00:50:41,123
You mean like a wish?

593
00:50:41,512 --> 00:50:42,756
Yeah.

594
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:46,406
Yeah, you wish for something
and I try and make it happen.

595
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:50,431
And in return, you forgive me.

596
00:50:55,436 --> 00:50:58,251
- Can I save it for later?
- Sure.

597
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:05,035
Kate...

598
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:08,198
...you're not doing everything wrong.

599
00:52:00,988 --> 00:52:02,516
Really expensive.

600
00:52:07,455 --> 00:52:11,417
All over the kitchen, everybody knows
about it. Carrots are a different matter.

601
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:40,678
Here you go. How many left?

602
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,601
- Kate?
- Yeah?

603
00:53:15,665 --> 00:53:18,153
- You're not working tomorrow, are you?
- Nope.

604
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:21,772
And Nick
isn't working tomorrow, is he?

605
00:53:22,931 --> 00:53:24,360
Sunday, we're closed.

606
00:53:25,299 --> 00:53:26,674
Why?

607
00:53:36,022 --> 00:53:37,811
Why's that?

608
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:39,892
It's my wish.

609
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,295
<i>It was Zoe's idea, not mine.</i>

610
00:53:46,361 --> 00:53:49,330
- How come I knew that?
- She says she prefers Italian.

611
00:53:49,497 --> 00:53:52,248
- Your kitchen or mine?
- Wouldn't it be easier to do it here?

612
00:53:52,475 --> 00:53:55,029
- Fine, we'll use mine.
- But my kitchen's fully equipped.

613
00:53:55,227 --> 00:53:58,010
Perfect. Shall we say noon?
I'll do the shopping.

614
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,815
- Aren't you cold?
- He's late.

615
00:54:16,481 --> 00:54:17,791
Men.

616
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,120
I'll be right there.

617
00:54:25,316 --> 00:54:27,455
<i>- Hello?
- Help.</i>

618
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:29,179
Coming!

619
00:54:34,277 --> 00:54:36,285
- Hey, you.
- You need a hand?

620
00:54:36,487 --> 00:54:37,796
No, I got it.

621
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:40,701
This way. I'll get that.

622
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,278
Afternoon, chef.

623
00:54:42,472 --> 00:54:44,807
Got the goodies. Where's the kitchen?

624
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,198
Right there.
Yeah, yeah, right. Okay, Yeah.

625
00:54:52,203 --> 00:54:54,538
Okay, sous-chef, put on your apron.

626
00:54:56,044 --> 00:54:59,907
- Now, do you have a cast-iron pan?
- Of course I have a cast-iron pan.

627
00:55:00,685 --> 00:55:01,994
Good.

628
00:55:06,126 --> 00:55:09,029
No, no, no.
Don't touch my Tupperware.

629
00:55:10,256 --> 00:55:14,697
Tonight, Zoe and I make dinner,
and only Zoe and I. Zoe.

630
00:55:14,897 --> 00:55:17,647
- But I could help.
- But it's my wish.

631
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,513
Tonight we're making pizza.

632
00:55:24,852 --> 00:55:26,892
- Pizza pans, please, sous-chef.
- Okay.

633
00:55:27,892 --> 00:55:31,309
Gotta get the flour, little eggs,
we'll roll some dough, okay?

634
00:55:31,669 --> 00:55:34,420
Work your hands in there.
That's good.

635
00:55:36,054 --> 00:55:38,160
Get your fingers in there.
Just like that.

636
00:55:38,358 --> 00:55:41,774
You create your own person and buy
them pets but you have to make enough.

637
00:55:41,944 --> 00:55:43,374
Nice and round.

638
00:55:43,544 --> 00:55:46,327
Then when you're ready, go like that,
then you go like that.

639
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:50,134
That was the first thing he taught me.
Both hands. Gotta know how to do it.

640
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:52,757
That's what drapes over.

641
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:57,016
Right? Yeah, good,
and then just go like that.

642
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,498
<i>Then you gotta sing Italiano.
You go like that.</i>

643
00:56:02,141 --> 00:56:04,247
Then you slap it down like that.

644
00:56:04,734 --> 00:56:07,605
Remember what I told you.
You can do it.

645
00:56:10,752 --> 00:56:12,411
Kate! We're ready.

646
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:16,350
No shoes.

647
00:56:17,153 --> 00:56:18,331
Okay.

648
00:56:21,155 --> 00:56:23,130
Close your eyes. Come with me.

649
00:56:25,379 --> 00:56:28,195
- What's the secret?
- You'll see.

650
00:56:28,837 --> 00:56:30,113
No peeking.

651
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:32,252
Almost there.

652
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:38,110
Okay, open your eyes.

653
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:39,586
Surprise.

654
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,044
I guess we're not eating
at the table.

655
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,575
We don't have one. We're on safari.

656
00:56:45,801 --> 00:56:47,176
I see.

657
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:51,265
- You forgot the plates.
- No, no. Sit down. We don't need plates.

658
00:56:51,466 --> 00:56:52,743
- No plates?
- No plates.

659
00:56:52,939 --> 00:56:54,849
Dirty plates attract the big cats.

660
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:57,189
Well, we certainly
don't want the big cats.

661
00:56:58,924 --> 00:57:00,834
Let me guess who made the pizza.

662
00:57:01,037 --> 00:57:03,493
- Me! Me. Me, me, me.
- Really?

663
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:18,216
Whose idea, though? Your idea.

664
00:57:18,385 --> 00:57:20,142
Yours has the tusks on it.

665
00:57:27,284 --> 00:57:29,805
Oh, you were so close.

666
00:57:38,295 --> 00:57:39,342
Nothing moved.

667
00:57:39,575 --> 00:57:41,681
But I get my eye poked out. That's okay.

668
00:57:56,796 --> 00:57:59,731
It's a vampire. It's a king turtle.

669
00:58:01,597 --> 00:58:03,452
<i>The king, The Lion King!</i>

670
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,021
Yes! Yes!

671
00:58:13,088 --> 00:58:14,518
I should put her to bed.

672
00:58:14,753 --> 00:58:15,963
Allow me.

673
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:18,167
Thank you.

674
00:58:45,865 --> 00:58:48,353
So where did you go
to cooking school?

675
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:51,168
As a young child, I sat
at my grandmother's knee...

676
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,443
Oh, yeah, in Miami, right.

677
00:58:53,707 --> 00:58:57,505
It was in Pittsburgh, actually.
My father was a steelworker.

678
00:58:58,028 --> 00:58:59,938
But you did go to cooking school?

679
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:02,956
Are you kidding me?
Cooking was for girls.

680
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:06,660
After high school,
I went backpacking through Italy.

681
00:59:07,854 --> 00:59:10,473
I owe my entire career
to a girl named Sophia.

682
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,909
- Sophia?
- She's my first love.

683
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,620
An older woman. Nineteen.

684
00:59:17,073 --> 00:59:19,278
Her father owned a little trattoria
in Tuscany.

685
00:59:19,442 --> 00:59:22,192
He was a brilliant chef and he
taught me everything he knew.

686
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:26,065
Sophia told him we were just friends,
so he gave me a job in his kitchen.

687
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:28,300
I fell madly in love with food.

688
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,323
Italian food.

689
00:59:31,189 --> 00:59:33,099
Everything Italian, actually.

690
00:59:33,621 --> 00:59:34,931
So, what happened to Sophia?

691
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:38,894
Her father found out
what we were up to and he fired me.

692
00:59:39,128 --> 00:59:42,740
- That's too bad.
- Well, it opened a lot of doors.

693
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:47,126
I spent the next couple of years working
in some of the best restaurants in Milan.

694
00:59:47,321 --> 00:59:50,388
So how come you're not running
your own kitchen by now?

695
00:59:53,307 --> 00:59:54,616
I don't know.

696
00:59:55,996 --> 00:59:58,004
I guess the right offer
hasn't come my way.

697
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,657
So, what would you do
if you had your wish?

698
01:00:06,046 --> 01:00:07,770
I got my wish.

699
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:17,278
I made it this morning.

700
01:00:17,474 --> 01:00:20,890
- I'm not a dessert person.
- You haven't tried my tiramisu.

701
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:31,966
Well, maybe I am a dessert person.

702
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,649
You know, in Italian, "tiramisu"
means "food of the gods. "

703
01:00:49,481 --> 01:00:51,042
No, it doesn't.

704
01:00:52,299 --> 01:00:54,023
Well, it should.

705
01:00:57,517 --> 01:01:01,129
You have a little...
Some cream, right there.

706
01:01:11,152 --> 01:01:12,745
I should go.

707
01:01:23,987 --> 01:01:25,875
You're leaning on my scarf.

708
01:01:27,348 --> 01:01:29,104
Oh, right. Yeah.

709
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:30,734
Sorry.

710
01:01:46,361 --> 01:01:47,987
Good night.

711
01:01:52,635 --> 01:01:55,254
<i>He's so unpredictable.</i>

712
01:01:55,484 --> 01:01:57,557
- In what way?
- In every way.

713
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,341
He never does the right thing
at the right time. He's...

714
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,508
Kate. Life is unpredictable.

715
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:05,879
Not in my kitchen.

716
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,504
I'm sure you'll be able
to prevent the worst.

717
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:11,574
The worst?

718
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,812
That he'll tolerate you
for any length of time.

719
01:02:15,009 --> 01:02:19,166
What is this? Some new kind of therapy?
Insult the client?

720
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:21,119
Only the finest therapists use it.

721
01:02:26,084 --> 01:02:29,248
So I'll see you after school, okay?
Have a good day.

722
01:02:29,925 --> 01:02:31,169
Hello, Kate.

723
01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:33,603
- We're on time.
- Do you have a minute?

724
01:02:34,438 --> 01:02:35,867
Sure.

725
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,767
<i>I've been speaking to Zoe's teacher.</i>

726
01:02:40,968 --> 01:02:43,336
She's been sleeping in class a lot.

727
01:02:43,528 --> 01:02:46,082
And do you know
what her explanation for this is?

728
01:02:46,281 --> 01:02:49,348
- No.
- She says it's her late work hours.

729
01:02:49,513 --> 01:02:52,514
She tells her classmates she's working
as a kitchen assistant...

730
01:02:52,747 --> 01:02:55,268
...in your restaurant
to earn her room and board.

731
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,439
- I see.
- Lf I actually believed...

732
01:02:58,605 --> 01:03:01,027
...that Zoe was working late hours
at a restaurant...

733
01:03:01,197 --> 01:03:03,816
...I'd need to contact
Child Protective Services.

734
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:05,771
- That won't be necessary.
- I know that.

735
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:10,438
It's better for everyone when children
are well cared for by their relatives.

736
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:14,634
I'd hate to see Zoe end up in foster
care after all she's been through.

737
01:03:14,865 --> 01:03:17,167
But I'm confident
that you will address this...

738
01:03:17,361 --> 01:03:19,401
...and there will be no need
to go that far.

739
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:23,465
I'll be checking in on Zoe,
and we'll talk again soon.

740
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:31,376
And then
Mr. Daniels' cell phone rings...

741
01:03:31,573 --> 01:03:35,949
...and he answers it and talks through
the whole class. It was so funny.

742
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:43,667
Zoe, we need to talk about something.

743
01:03:46,297 --> 01:03:48,916
You can't come to work
with me anymore.

744
01:03:49,114 --> 01:03:50,608
Why not?

745
01:03:51,675 --> 01:03:54,610
Because I'm afraid they're gonna
take you away from me.

746
01:03:55,644 --> 01:03:57,749
- But I like going to the restaurant.
- I know.

747
01:03:57,948 --> 01:04:02,651
I know you do, but it's just not right for
a little girl to be up so late, you know.

748
01:04:03,101 --> 01:04:06,266
- You don't want me there.
- No, that's not true.

749
01:04:06,494 --> 01:04:09,277
No, you just need
to get a good night's rest.

750
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,546
You hear me?

751
01:04:12,736 --> 01:04:14,646
You don't want to end up
being taken away.

752
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,078
Who cares?
You didn't want me anyway.

753
01:04:20,514 --> 01:04:21,759
Zoe.

754
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,471
Zoe!

755
01:04:26,788 --> 01:04:27,803
Zoe!

756
01:04:29,317 --> 01:04:30,299
Zoe!

757
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:41,829
Zoe, stop it! Stop it!

758
01:04:42,024 --> 01:04:47,721
Let me go! Let me go!
I want my mom, not you!

759
01:04:57,516 --> 01:04:59,011
Zoe?

760
01:05:01,677 --> 01:05:04,296
- Can I come in?
- No.

761
01:05:05,518 --> 01:05:07,907
Zoe, please. I'm sorry.

762
01:05:08,143 --> 01:05:10,119
Go away.

763
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:44,369
- Hi, guys. Is your dad there?
- Yeah. Dad!

764
01:05:44,536 --> 01:05:46,839
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi, Sean.

765
01:05:47,065 --> 01:05:49,651
- How are you?
- Good. Can I ask you a favor?

766
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:51,575
- Of course.
- I know it's last minute...

767
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:54,521
...but I have to go to work soon
and Zoe and I had a fight.

768
01:05:54,715 --> 01:05:56,407
You want me to keep an eye on her?

769
01:05:56,636 --> 01:06:00,827
- Lf you could just check on her.
- No problem. Take it inside, guys.

770
01:06:01,021 --> 01:06:03,739
- You got a key?
- Sure, I got it right here.

771
01:06:05,022 --> 01:06:06,932
- Thanks, Sean.
- Hey, how are you doing?

772
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:10,967
- All this is pretty new to me.
- I know what might help.

773
01:06:11,423 --> 01:06:13,726
Call this number. Anna.
She's a godsend with kids.

774
01:06:13,952 --> 01:06:15,741
Saved me right after my divorce.

775
01:06:15,937 --> 01:06:18,840
I'm sure she'll be able to watch Zoe
for you whenever you need.

776
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:21,847
- Thank you.
- No problem.

777
01:06:23,235 --> 01:06:25,919
If you're gonna play for Ireland, you're
gonna have to get stuck in better.

778
01:06:26,468 --> 01:06:29,469
"Ms. Armstrong introduces bits
of truffle in an endive salad...

779
01:06:29,668 --> 01:06:33,826
...that accompanied a lightly steamed
and wondrously silken halibut fillet.

780
01:06:34,022 --> 01:06:37,405
It was highlighted by the gorgeous aria
of her saffron-infused emulsion. "

781
01:06:37,575 --> 01:06:39,964
<i>This guy can't decide if you're a cook
or a composer:</i>

782
01:06:40,135 --> 01:06:43,235
"The artistry of her signature quail
with truffles made it clear...

783
01:06:43,401 --> 01:06:46,980
...that she brought in a great sous-chef
to complement her distinctive style. "

784
01:06:47,146 --> 01:06:48,488
It says that?

785
01:06:48,682 --> 01:06:50,951
Just making sure
you're paying attention.

786
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:54,375
You look like you need a drink.

787
01:06:54,764 --> 01:06:56,455
I never drink at work.

788
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,753
Are you serious?

789
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,888
Like that?

790
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,224
<i>Tell me what else you never do.</i>

791
01:07:18,002 --> 01:07:19,016
<i>What do you mean?</i>

792
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:23,145
Well, you never eat dessert.
You never drink at work.

793
01:07:24,147 --> 01:07:28,076
I'm kind of hoping you'll tell me you
never go out with guys who sing opera.

794
01:07:28,596 --> 01:07:31,150
I never go out with guys
who sing opera.

795
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:36,045
Yes.

796
01:07:46,586 --> 01:07:48,975
- I got it.
- I got it.

797
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,297
So I've got one for you.

798
01:07:58,493 --> 01:08:02,520
What are the three secrets
of French cuisine?

799
01:08:02,717 --> 01:08:05,336
Oh, come on. Everybody knows that.

800
01:08:05,535 --> 01:08:08,732
Oh, yeah?
So, what are they, smarty-pants?

801
01:08:09,247 --> 01:08:12,543
Butter, butter and butter.

802
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,909
You're good.

803
01:08:15,649 --> 01:08:19,424
You know, you didn't have to do this.
It's not like I'm drunk or anything.

804
01:08:20,547 --> 01:08:22,402
Sean. Hi.

805
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:26,495
Nick, this is Sean, he lives downstairs.

806
01:08:26,788 --> 01:08:29,178
This is Nick. We cook together.

807
01:08:29,381 --> 01:08:32,000
- How are you?
- You obviously don't live in the building.

808
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:37,027
- How was Zoe?
- Sound asleep. She's a great kid.

809
01:08:37,351 --> 01:08:39,588
- Have a good night.
- Thanks, Sean.

810
01:08:40,552 --> 01:08:42,625
Yeah, he's so sweet.

811
01:08:43,144 --> 01:08:45,894
He was just keeping an eye on Zoe.

812
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,668
He's just a sweet, nice guy.
I couldn't wish for a better neighbor.

813
01:08:49,866 --> 01:08:52,550
Yeah, he's always just so...

814
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,097
in a totally neigh...

815
01:09:02,574 --> 01:09:04,363
Take an aspirin.

816
01:09:06,063 --> 01:09:07,437
Yeah.

817
01:09:41,688 --> 01:09:43,030
<i>Come on!</i>

818
01:11:04,654 --> 01:11:06,793
It's time to get up, sweetheart.

819
01:11:10,256 --> 01:11:12,678
I don't wanna go to school today.

820
01:11:14,097 --> 01:11:15,788
Guess what.

821
01:11:17,234 --> 01:11:19,471
I don't wanna go to work today.

822
01:11:20,723 --> 01:11:22,250
Really?

823
01:11:24,211 --> 01:11:26,600
Today it's just gonna be you and me.

824
01:11:39,543 --> 01:11:41,551
"To all the gang at 22 Bleecker...

825
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,852
...let me introduce you
to my little hors d'oeuvre. "

826
01:11:45,081 --> 01:11:47,471
- Let's see the photo.
- Emma Jillian. Here we go.

827
01:11:47,673 --> 01:11:50,991
- "Seven pounds, three ounces. "
- She's adorable.

828
01:11:51,195 --> 01:11:55,287
"She can't wait to meet you all.
Love and kisses, Leah. "

829
01:11:56,252 --> 01:11:57,976
Kate's late.

830
01:11:58,844 --> 01:12:03,068
She asked for some time off.
Something personal came up.

831
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:06,846
One, two, three, four, five, six!
Yes, Park Place!

832
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:11,415
- And with a hotel, 1500 bucks.
- I don't have enough.

833
01:12:11,808 --> 01:12:13,434
Mortgage, baby. Mortgage.

834
01:12:13,633 --> 01:12:16,154
Come on. I love this game.

835
01:12:18,082 --> 01:12:19,097
Come on.

836
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:24,120
All right. Great. Thank you.
All right, so, what do I need?

837
01:12:24,323 --> 01:12:28,034
I need a nine. Give me a nine
and it's Free Parking.

838
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:30,433
Oh, boy. Here we go.

839
01:12:33,478 --> 01:12:35,715
- Yes!
- No!

840
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:37,602
This isn't fair. No!

841
01:12:38,023 --> 01:12:43,043
I'm rich. I'm rich. I'm rich!

842
01:12:45,705 --> 01:12:47,811
You know what this means,
don't you?

843
01:12:48,009 --> 01:12:49,471
- No, what does it mean?
- War!

844
01:13:13,744 --> 01:13:16,779
Come on and fight!
You're afraid of a little pillow?

845
01:13:28,533 --> 01:13:31,087
How's that rib eye doing, you guys?
I need two sea bass.

846
01:13:31,318 --> 01:13:34,897
All right, pancetta, goat cheese, oysters,
steak tartare, grilled rib eye.

847
01:13:35,094 --> 01:13:37,746
- How much longer on that rib eye, Mario?
- Rib eye coming.

848
01:13:37,943 --> 01:13:39,666
Come on, let's pick it up.

849
01:13:42,392 --> 01:13:44,848
I needed that soufflé five minutes ago.
Let's go.

850
01:13:53,883 --> 01:13:58,805
<i>We did 110 covers tonight.
Everything was excellent.</i>

851
01:13:59,165 --> 01:14:00,856
You've really
mastered the menu, Nick.

852
01:14:01,086 --> 01:14:06,073
You put your signature on the dishes,
and all the regulars have noticed.

853
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:12,538
How would you like
to stay on permanently?

854
01:14:16,225 --> 01:14:17,884
I think I'd like that.

855
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:20,535
If it's okay with Kate.

856
01:14:46,345 --> 01:14:49,346
<i>- Who is it?
- Do you have any idea what time it is?</i>

857
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:52,742
<i>- What?
- It's very, very late.</i>

858
01:15:01,613 --> 01:15:05,357
The kitchen was a very different place
without you tonight.

859
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:08,231
I'm sure you did just fine without me.

860
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,791
- It was hell.
- That's better.

861
01:15:25,364 --> 01:15:26,793
Cognac...

862
01:15:27,988 --> 01:15:29,363
...white wine...

863
01:15:30,677 --> 01:15:31,954
...celery...

864
01:15:33,814 --> 01:15:36,019
...leek, shallots...

865
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:38,960
...and garlic.

866
01:16:08,992 --> 01:16:10,650
I'm getting truffle.

867
01:16:21,283 --> 01:16:24,284
- I haven't... I think I...
- Don't think.

868
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:00,843
Pancake time.

869
01:17:04,878 --> 01:17:07,083
Pancake time.

870
01:17:07,887 --> 01:17:09,775
Where's my sous-chef?

871
01:17:10,736 --> 01:17:13,606
- Pancakes?
- You want to help me?

872
01:17:14,449 --> 01:17:16,305
Okay, flip it.

873
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:21,768
Nice. You could start
your own restaurant. Call it Zoe's.

874
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,630
I'll call it Nick and Zoe's.

875
01:17:23,827 --> 01:17:26,162
Excuse me?
I did squeeze the orange juice.

876
01:17:26,452 --> 01:17:30,195
Okay. Nick and Kate and Zoe's.

877
01:17:30,422 --> 01:17:31,851
I like the ring of that.

878
01:17:34,742 --> 01:17:35,920
Not in front of Zoe.

879
01:17:36,663 --> 01:17:39,151
Zoe, I'm now going to kiss your aunt.

880
01:17:40,152 --> 01:17:42,607
This is so embarrassing.

881
01:17:48,442 --> 01:17:50,930
So how are we gonna
work together now?

882
01:17:51,098 --> 01:17:52,506
We'll do what we always did.

883
01:17:52,699 --> 01:17:54,009
You tell me what to do...

884
01:17:54,172 --> 01:17:57,075
...and I'll go behind your back
and do whatever I want.

885
01:18:22,147 --> 01:18:25,628
I wanna show you something.
Quick! Let's go.

886
01:18:28,741 --> 01:18:31,775
Excuse me.
Do you have any kaffir lime leaves?

887
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:34,692
- Over there. You touch, you buy.
- I know, I know.

888
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:38,687
- What do you need those for?
- You'll see.

889
01:18:39,592 --> 01:18:41,119
Here they are.

890
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,653
- One for you.
- Smells good.

891
01:18:43,881 --> 01:18:46,467
Like it? One for you.

892
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:48,963
How do I know this smell?

893
01:18:50,315 --> 01:18:52,290
Is this your saffron sauce?

894
01:18:53,259 --> 01:18:55,048
Apparently we have
no secrets anymore.

895
01:18:55,276 --> 01:18:56,705
You touch.

896
01:18:56,908 --> 01:18:58,632
I know. I buy.

897
01:18:58,957 --> 01:19:01,347
- You buy.
- Two dollar.

898
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:48,559
Today for our entrée special,
we are offering...

899
01:19:48,762 --> 01:19:51,610
...a Hudson Valley free-range duck...

900
01:19:51,803 --> 01:19:54,967
...over a butternut-squash purée...

901
01:19:55,164 --> 01:19:59,540
...and that is served with
patty pan squash and blood orange...

902
01:19:59,773 --> 01:20:02,675
...and finished with
a mushroom sauce made up...

903
01:20:02,878 --> 01:20:05,529
...of a variety of wild mushrooms...
- From the...

904
01:20:05,727 --> 01:20:07,637
from the cognac region of France.

905
01:20:07,839 --> 01:20:09,847
- What do you think?
- What's that?

906
01:20:10,048 --> 01:20:14,751
Nick came up with a great idea
of sending mini desserts home in a box.

907
01:20:15,361 --> 01:20:17,085
It's so obvious.

908
01:20:18,466 --> 01:20:20,027
So obvious.

909
01:20:20,258 --> 01:20:23,161
And, Nick, I love those wines
you recommended for the new menu.

910
01:20:23,331 --> 01:20:26,081
Well, you're gonna have to
discuss that with Kate.

911
01:20:27,844 --> 01:20:29,634
John, tell us
about the asparagus dish.

912
01:20:30,853 --> 01:20:34,880
We're also serving as a special
a side...

913
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:38,560
Rather, an appetizer
with asparagus and cippolini onions...

914
01:20:38,759 --> 01:20:41,608
...and it has a side
of sliced watermelon radishes.

915
01:20:42,088 --> 01:20:45,351
Table five's coming up in two seconds,
chef.

916
01:20:55,308 --> 01:20:58,408
Nick, the couple at table eight
wants to say hello.

917
01:20:58,573 --> 01:21:01,956
- They're drooling over the sea bass.
- Kate's responsible for all the food.

918
01:21:02,189 --> 01:21:04,426
- She hates leaving the kitchen.
- Interesting.

919
01:21:04,622 --> 01:21:07,208
- What else can you tell us about her?
- You know what?

920
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:10,255
I'm not gonna get into this.
I don't care who goes out there.

921
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:15,851
But if it is you, do me a favor and try
not to stab anyone who complains.

922
01:21:16,082 --> 01:21:17,871
Don't look at me.

923
01:21:18,066 --> 01:21:20,968
You. Me. In there. Now.

924
01:21:29,909 --> 01:21:31,797
- So, what's the story?
- What do you mean?

925
01:21:31,957 --> 01:21:34,030
I turn my back
for a couple of days and it's:

926
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:36,784
"Nick, the wine. Nick, the customers.
Nick, the boxes... "

927
01:21:36,951 --> 01:21:38,446
She offered me your job.

928
01:21:39,639 --> 01:21:41,047
What?

929
01:21:42,616 --> 01:21:44,405
Why didn't you tell me?

930
01:21:45,177 --> 01:21:47,382
- I can't believe this.
- I was going to tell you.

931
01:21:47,577 --> 01:21:48,985
I knew I couldn't trust you.

932
01:21:49,146 --> 01:21:52,595
- The moment I met you, I knew.
- The truth is that you can't trust anyone.

933
01:21:52,763 --> 01:21:55,252
- You've never trusted anyone in your life.
- Guess what.

934
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:57,176
Why should I when this happens?

935
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,501
Why didn't you have the guts
just to run your own kitchen, Nick?

936
01:22:00,669 --> 01:22:02,841
Instead of coming in here
and taking over mine?

937
01:22:03,037 --> 01:22:05,656
- Is that what you think?
- That's exactly what I think.

938
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,561
You know, Kate...

939
01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:19,647
...it's okay to let people in sometimes.
Maybe one of these days...

940
01:22:19,811 --> 01:22:22,080
...you'll figure that out.
- You don't understand.

941
01:22:22,275 --> 01:22:24,283
This place is my life.

942
01:22:24,804 --> 01:22:27,652
- This is who I am.
- No, it's not who you are.

943
01:22:28,805 --> 01:22:30,715
It's only one little part.

944
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:42,596
Anna, it's me.

945
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,230
Hi.

946
01:22:48,554 --> 01:22:49,929
How did everything go?

947
01:22:50,123 --> 01:22:53,123
I think we did well.
We played Monopoly.

948
01:22:53,323 --> 01:22:56,041
- Who won?
- She did.

949
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:58,857
Thanks a lot, Anna.

950
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:01,323
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

951
01:23:16,306 --> 01:23:20,944
<i>Mailbox one.
You have one new message.</i>

952
01:23:21,139 --> 01:23:25,362
<i>Monday, 11:54 p. m.</i>

953
01:23:25,588 --> 01:23:30,226
<i>Oh, and for the record,
I did turn her down.</i>

954
01:23:33,302 --> 01:23:35,855
<i>End of messages.</i>

955
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:43,700
<i>Oh, and for the record,
I did turn her down.</i>

956
01:23:49,018 --> 01:23:50,000
Kate.

957
01:23:51,995 --> 01:23:53,457
Still awake?

958
01:23:54,043 --> 01:23:55,538
Where's Nick?

959
01:23:57,405 --> 01:23:58,932
He went home after work.

960
01:24:01,149 --> 01:24:03,353
Get some sleep, it's late.

961
01:24:05,919 --> 01:24:08,024
- Kate?
- Yeah?

962
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,990
You can sleep with Louie if you want.

963
01:24:16,994 --> 01:24:19,678
Oh, honey, that's sweet of you.

964
01:24:20,098 --> 01:24:21,887
He needs you, I'm fine.

965
01:24:22,915 --> 01:24:24,377
Night-night.

966
01:24:29,669 --> 01:24:30,913
Night.

967
01:24:36,711 --> 01:24:39,876
You had no right driving him out of here.
This is my restaurant.

968
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:43,521
- You've made that abundantly clear.
- You better find me a replacement fast.

969
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:45,631
You didn't need my help
with the last one.

970
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:48,583
- Kate.
- Okay. I'll find someone.

971
01:24:51,563 --> 01:24:54,913
Like a certificate or something?
I don't have that little piece of paper.

972
01:24:55,116 --> 01:24:57,800
But there's guys driving
on the street without a license.

973
01:24:57,997 --> 01:24:59,590
They can't drive, so, you know.

974
01:24:59,821 --> 01:25:01,677
Well, my specialty is in the beef area.

975
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:05,929
I deal with meats all the time.
Sausage, beef, slaughtering pork.

976
01:25:06,127 --> 01:25:08,070
I'm famous
for my Vietnamese pork chops...

977
01:25:08,271 --> 01:25:10,792
...with saffron mashed potatoes
and key-lime asparagus.

978
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,605
I get along great with people.
Really, I'm actually a big people person.

979
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:16,525
Oh, I'm a people person.

980
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:19,079
I'm a team player so long
as everybody follows my lead.

981
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:23,212
There was a misunderstanding
between me and the head chef...

982
01:25:23,412 --> 01:25:25,779
...and the manager and the owners.

983
01:25:25,972 --> 01:25:28,558
Fired is like, you know, it's,
"You're fired!" You know.

984
01:25:28,725 --> 01:25:32,949
But, no, I think we parted
on amicable terms.

985
01:25:39,415 --> 01:25:42,351
Why doesn't Nick
come to see us anymore?

986
01:25:46,777 --> 01:25:49,363
We had kind of a fight.

987
01:25:49,851 --> 01:25:53,397
- What about?
- Just silly grown-up stuff.

988
01:25:58,012 --> 01:25:59,922
How come you don't wanna tell me?

989
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:05,686
- It's not that I don't wanna tell you.
- Is he ever gonna come back?

990
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:08,764
No, he isn't, sweetheart.

991
01:26:20,898 --> 01:26:22,590
Zoe.

992
01:26:51,723 --> 01:26:53,610
Zoe, you awake?

993
01:26:54,572 --> 01:26:56,099
I'm done.

994
01:26:57,165 --> 01:26:58,987
Are you having breakfast?

995
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:05,131
Zoe?

996
01:27:08,559 --> 01:27:11,080
Nick, it's me.
Is Zoe with you?

997
01:27:12,112 --> 01:27:14,000
I got up this morning,
and she was gone.

998
01:27:14,513 --> 01:27:16,782
I'm here right now.
They haven't seen her.

999
01:27:17,842 --> 01:27:22,066
I don't know. I told her about us
last night and she was upset, but...

1000
01:27:22,227 --> 01:27:24,115
Oh, my God.

1001
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:25,420
What did the police say?

1002
01:27:25,588 --> 01:27:29,004
They checked the bus station and the
train station. She could be anywhere.

1003
01:27:29,173 --> 01:27:32,686
Well, she's a kid. She would probably
choose someplace she knew, right?

1004
01:27:32,854 --> 01:27:35,408
She went to school and the restaurant,
that's it.

1005
01:27:42,105 --> 01:27:45,335
Kate, it's gonna be fine.
She's gonna be all right.

1006
01:27:45,497 --> 01:27:48,847
You know what, maybe we should check
if she's gone back home.

1007
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:51,349
Zoe?

1008
01:27:52,571 --> 01:27:54,775
Maybe she left a note somewhere.

1009
01:27:55,324 --> 01:27:57,080
She's not here.

1010
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:10,368
Did she take her backpack?
If she didn't pack anything...

1011
01:28:10,528 --> 01:28:12,700
- She didn't take Louie.
- What?

1012
01:28:13,696 --> 01:28:16,959
She wouldn't run away
without Louie, right?

1013
01:28:17,537 --> 01:28:20,538
I let her down, Nick. I feel like
I made a mess of everything.

1014
01:28:20,739 --> 01:28:23,423
- We're gonna find her. I promise.
- She needs her mother.

1015
01:28:23,588 --> 01:28:25,410
- She just needs her mother.
- Kate.

1016
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,243
I think I know where she might be.

1017
01:28:34,246 --> 01:28:37,509
- There she is right there.
- Oh, thank God.

1018
01:28:40,488 --> 01:28:42,627
Zoe, are you all right?

1019
01:28:43,977 --> 01:28:46,082
Zoe, please, don't ever do that again.

1020
01:28:46,249 --> 01:28:48,639
I was so afraid
something happened to you.

1021
01:28:50,059 --> 01:28:52,448
Sweetheart, what is it?

1022
01:28:54,252 --> 01:28:56,554
I'm afraid I'm gonna forget her.

1023
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:02,060
We'll never forget her.

1024
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:04,237
I promise.

1025
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:10,534
Never.

1026
01:29:22,163 --> 01:29:25,066
And we can come here
whenever you want, okay?

1027
01:29:52,347 --> 01:29:54,005
You're coming in, aren't you, Nick?

1028
01:29:54,748 --> 01:29:56,177
Not today, sweetie.

1029
01:29:56,828 --> 01:29:59,513
- Guys still mad at each other?
- No.

1030
01:30:00,029 --> 01:30:01,436
Come on.

1031
01:30:07,007 --> 01:30:08,469
See you upstairs.

1032
01:30:11,712 --> 01:30:13,119
- You know...
- You know...

1033
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:16,601
I just wanna say I'm sorry, Nick.

1034
01:30:16,769 --> 01:30:18,745
Don't apologize.
I actually wanna thank you.

1035
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:20,955
I thought a lot about what you said...

1036
01:30:21,123 --> 01:30:24,866
...about me not having the guts to go
after what I want, and you were right.

1037
01:30:25,828 --> 01:30:27,290
That's why...

1038
01:30:28,484 --> 01:30:29,859
...I took a job.

1039
01:30:30,565 --> 01:30:32,126
In San Francisco.

1040
01:30:32,486 --> 01:30:36,643
The executive chef
at a new restaurant.

1041
01:30:40,712 --> 01:30:42,655
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah.

1042
01:30:44,009 --> 01:30:46,562
Well, I couldn't have done it
without you.

1043
01:30:58,765 --> 01:31:00,587
Executive chef.

1044
01:31:17,682 --> 01:31:20,017
Guy at table seven said
if he wanted it cremated...

1045
01:31:20,179 --> 01:31:22,002
...he wouldn't have asked for it rare.

1046
01:31:22,964 --> 01:31:25,299
- That is rare.
- Apparently not rare enough.

1047
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:27,697
Any rarer, it'd walk out of here
and hail a cab.

1048
01:31:27,861 --> 01:31:30,862
Look, these are ad-agency people.
They spend a lot of money here.

1049
01:31:31,029 --> 01:31:33,998
No tantrums tonight.
Just fire another one.

1050
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:39,823
- Fire one rare steak on the fly.
- Rare steak on the fly.

1051
01:31:39,992 --> 01:31:42,033
Where is the lamb for six?

1052
01:31:42,201 --> 01:31:43,662
- How are the quail?
- Great, chef.

1053
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:46,681
Pick up! Terrine, carpaccio.

1054
01:31:49,658 --> 01:31:52,048
From the asshole on seven again.
He wants to know...

1055
01:31:52,251 --> 01:31:55,351
...whether you've ever seen
a rare steak before.

1056
01:32:06,175 --> 01:32:08,347
- Rare enough for you?
- Are you out of your mind?

1057
01:32:08,511 --> 01:32:10,584
- Yeah. That's why I'm in therapy.
- I'm so sorry.

1058
01:32:10,752 --> 01:32:13,819
I'll get you a new tablecloth.

1059
01:32:13,985 --> 01:32:16,352
No, please, let me take care of that.

1060
01:32:17,762 --> 01:32:19,617
Not bad.

1061
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:22,236
That felt so good.

1062
01:32:26,244 --> 01:32:27,935
I just want a steak.

1063
01:32:31,909 --> 01:32:34,780
<i>I wish there was a cookbook for life,
you know?</i>

1064
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:37,405
<i>With the recipes
telling us exactly what to do.</i>

1065
01:32:39,176 --> 01:32:43,487
I know. I know. You're gonna say,
"How else can we learn, Kate?"

1066
01:32:43,657 --> 01:32:46,592
No. Actually, I wasn't gonna say that.

1067
01:32:47,338 --> 01:32:49,859
- You wanna guess again?
- Oh, no, go ahead.

1068
01:32:50,635 --> 01:32:54,378
What I was gonna say was
you know better than anyone.

1069
01:32:55,084 --> 01:32:58,249
It's the recipes you create yourself
that are the best.

1070
01:33:26,388 --> 01:33:28,298
Hold on just a second.

1071
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:36,053
I think you should know
there's something else I never do.

1072
01:33:36,727 --> 01:33:37,938
What's that?

1073
01:33:38,104 --> 01:33:40,974
I never invite myself
into a man's apartment, blindfold him...

1074
01:33:41,144 --> 01:33:46,513
...and feed him saffron sauce while
begging him not to go to San Francisco.

1075
01:33:47,194 --> 01:33:49,202
- You never do that?
- Never.

1076
01:33:49,402 --> 01:33:50,963
That's too bad.

1077
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:31,202
- You're gonna sear that first, right?
- Yeah, chef.

1078
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:38,086
Don't forget to reduce
this sauce a little, okay?

1079
01:34:38,248 --> 01:34:39,874
- You're crossing the line.
- No.

1080
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:43,074
Yes, you are.
Look, your spoon's in my territory.

1081
01:34:44,073 --> 01:34:47,685
Look, I can't help if your reduction's
a little thin. I have to say something.

1082
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:50,371
I wouldn't talk.
Your sabayon's got lumps.

1083
01:34:51,755 --> 01:34:53,249
You're out of your mind.

1084
01:34:56,428 --> 01:34:59,015
- It's perfect.
- I'll be the judge of that.

1085
01:35:12,465 --> 01:35:14,473
You're right, it is perfect.

1086
01:35:17,169 --> 01:35:18,763
Pancakes.

1087
01:35:20,435 --> 01:35:22,824
- Thank you.
- Voilà.

1088
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:27,086
Zoe, that's enough.

1089
01:35:30,806 --> 01:35:32,367
- Hi.
- Hi.

1090
01:35:43,448 --> 01:35:45,456
Hey, Zoe. Thank you.

1091
01:35:45,625 --> 01:35:48,692
Wait. Let her tell us what.
What have we got?
