1
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,700
Mr. Marcus Skinner...

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,200
care of the English department,
Stanford University.

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Dear Mr. Skinner,
My name is Shaun Brumder...

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,100
and I think
you are a total genius.

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,200
I live in California...

6
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,400
in a place called Orange County.

7
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,800
A year ago, I was just
another Orange County surfer--

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,300
spending my days at the beach
with my buddies...

9
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,500
playing volleyball...

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,100
Spike it, Shaun!

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,100
and spending my nights
around a bonfire partying.

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,900
School was always a walk for me.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,600
I did pretty well
without trying too hard.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
There’s a tropical storm off Laguna.

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,400
Let’s go, dude.
Surf’s up.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,900
I was easily distracted.

17
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,400
- What about next period?
- Twenty-footers. Screw your period.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,800
Twenty-footers?

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,500
Then last April, me and my crew
drove out to Emerald Cove...

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,900
to catch some major tsunami waves.

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,800
I don’t know, you guys.

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,700
Dude, face the fear.

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,100
This is intense!

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,500
Righteous.

25
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,200
Lonny always said he wanted to die
eating foam in a massive wipeout...

26
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,700
but I bet he’s up in heaven
right now.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,500
After Lonny drowned,
I did some heavy meditating.

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,000
I thought, maybe there’s more to life
than extreme sports...

29
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,200
and trying to get laid.

30
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,900
Maybe there’s
a bigger purpose for me...

31
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,500
and I’ve just been too high
to figure it out.

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,200
I was sitting on the beach,
totally cogitating.

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,700
I looked down, and there, in the sand,
was a copy of your book.

34
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,500

It was like a sign, like your book
was calling out to me.

35
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,000
Read me.

36
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,800
For the next few days,
I read it from cover to cover.

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,600
Your book totally captured
what it’s like to be a teenager--

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,000
the excitement, the confusion,
the horniness.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,300
Sometimes I laughed so hard,
I thought I was going to puke and die.

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
Other times, I cried.

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Are you okay?

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,700
It’s just so sad.

43
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,600
I read your book
52 times that month...

44
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,100
and I finally realized
what I wanted to do with my life.

45
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,100
I want to be a writer.

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,400
I’ve been writing ever since.
It’s all I ever do.

47
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,900
All day and all night sometimes.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,500
It was hard to get going,
but, once I did, I couldn’t stop.

49
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,400
I’m like a machine,
and nothing else matters.

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,100
I’m selling my board.
I don’t have time.

51
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,100
- I need to focus on my writing.
- What?

52
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,900
My friends think
I’ve lost my mind.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,900
He’s lost his mind.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,600
Let’s get lit and go jump off
the roof of my house.

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,400
Now you’re talking.

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,300
I need some feedback,
and there’s no one here to help me.

57
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,800
Got your story here. Wow.

58
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,400
I have the sneaking suspicion
that my English teacher is illiterate.

59
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,800
I noticed you used a lot of big words.
Nice. Good for you.

60
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,200
It was a little long, so I didn’t
read the whole thing.

61
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,500
But who cares?
‘Cause I gave you an A.

62
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,000
My brother, Lance, is perpetually
recovering from the night before.

63
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,700
I’m sorry.
I don’t feel good.

64
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,400
My girlfriend is the only one
who’s actually read my work.

65
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,900
But she’s always so positive,
it’s hard to take her seriously.

66
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,200
It’s, like, the best story
I’ve ever read.

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,700
Really?

68
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,300
It’s funny and original.

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,500
I mean...

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,100
I think it could be a movie.

71
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
I don’t know if Orange County
is the best environment...

72
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,100
for an aspiring writer...

73
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,100
so I’m applying to Stanford.

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,900
You are a shoo-in.

75
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Do you think I should apply
to some safety schools?

76
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
No need.
Don’t be a scaredy-cat.

77
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,000
There’s no doubt in my mind
you’re gonna go to Berkeley.

78
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,700
Stanford.

79
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,800
Yes. Stanford is where
you’re going, mister.

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,600
I’m sending you
a copy of my story.

81
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,600
Hopefully,
with your wisdom and guidance...

82
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,200
I will one day be a real writer.

83
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,200
I look forward to seeing you
in the fall, Mr. Skinner.

84
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,600
Your greatest admirer,
Shaun Brumder.

85
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,900
Watch it, man.

86
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,600
What are you doing lying here?

87
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,900
My parole officer wants to give me
a drug test, and I need your urine.

88
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,000
Can I score some of your piss?

89
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,700
- Yeah.
- Awesome, man.

90
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,900
Bob?

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Don’t yell at me!

92
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,500
Are you okay?

93
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,400
It’s my kitchen!

94
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Mom. Hey, Mom.

95
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,700
- What?
- Something’s wrong with Bob.

96
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,300
- Did you feed him his pills today?
- I don’t know. Is he okay?

97
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,000
You gotta remember
to feed him his pills.

98
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,400
Lupe, did you give Bob his pills?

99
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,600
I’m not a nurse.

100
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,500
You’ve got to get rid of her
right now, okay, baby?

101
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,200
She has a bad attitude, and she’s--
You stole my Palm Pilot.

102
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,400
You did. Admit it.

103
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
- That’s it.
- You did.

104
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,400
Yeah. It’s over.

105
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,400
What? What happened?
What’d she say?

106
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,300
She’s sorry, and she thinks
you’re an incredible lady.

107
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,000
Listen, Mom, when the mail comes,
will you call me on my cell?

108
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,600
‘Cause I’m supposed to hear
from Stanford today.

109
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,900
Okay.

110
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,400
Come on. Don’t get upset, Mom.

111
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,600
All right? You knew this day
was gonna come.

112
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,900
I’m just goin’ to college.
It’s not like I’m leaving the planet.

113
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
Mom, get a grip.

114
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,700
I won’t.

115
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,200
I’m going back to bed.

116
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,800
Check this out.
You gotta help us out.

117
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
- Don’t call me a punk.
- You’re a punk.

118
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,900
You remember the night we all went
golfing and I paid for everyone?

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,900
- ‘Cause stinge-king over here--
- Who paid for parking?

120
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don’t remember you ever paying
for anything in your sorry life.

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,100
Of course you don’t remember
when someone else does.

122
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,800
Did you guys know
that it’s April 1 5?

123
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,300
A year ago today, Lonny died.

124
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,200
Hey, dude, that’s true.

125
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,500
I can’t believe
it’s been a whole year.

126
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
I was thinking that, you know...

127
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,300
maybe we should do something
in his memory.

128
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,000
We should pull a killer prank.
We should go jump off something.

129
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,200
Yeah, bro, or blow something up.

130
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Maybe we should go to Emerald Cove
and have a surf in Lonny’s memory.

131
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,700
Shaun doesn’t surf anymore, stupid.

132
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,000
I forgot. He doesn’t surf or skate
or pick his butt.

133
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,000
- Writer boy now.
- What’s up, Dr. Seuss? Cat in the Hat?

134
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,000
Principal Harbert, as you may know...

135
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,000
there was an oil spill last week
off the coast of Redondo.

136
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Today’s paper just says hundreds
of seagulls have been affected.

137
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,100
I propose a school-sponsored
fund-raiser...

138
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,700
with all the proceeds going to
the seagull rehabilitation fund.

139
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,900
As the community-service leader,
we would be morally remiss...

140
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,200
if we did nothing
for these seagulls.

141
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,300
Fine.

142
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,900
One more. Last one.

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,300
After this, we’ll let all sick and
endangered animals die horrible deaths.

144
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,000
Agreed?

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,500
Now, people,
June is just around the corner.

146
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,400
Let’s talk graduation speakers.
Ideas?

147
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,100
Toni Morrison.

148
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
She’s in town that same weekend
for a book signing.

149
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,400
She’s won the Nobel Prize.

150
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,000
Interesting.

151
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,200
Dana, didn’t you say you have a cousin
who’s friends with Britney Spears?

152
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,100
Yeah. Best friends.

153
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,000
Now when I say Romeo and Juliet,
who comes to mind?

154
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,100
- Dana?
- Claire Danes.

155
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,800
That’s right. Claire Danes.
Who else?

156
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,800
- Leonardo DiCaprio.
- Right. Who else?

157
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,400
You know, someone else
was involved in that movie...

158
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,100
who, in some ways, is as famous
as Leonardo DiCaprio.

159
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,500
And his name’s William Shakespeare...

160
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,500
and some great movies
are based on his plays.

161
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,900
Hamlet, West Side Story...

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,300
Talented Mr. Ripley,
Waterworld...

163
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Gladiator, Chocolat.

164
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,000
Mr. Burke, as you know, my boyfriend
drowned in a surfing accident.

165
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,700
I don’t think I can handle
Romeo and Juliet right now...

166
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,800
emotionally.

167
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,100
Tanya, Lonny died a year ago.

168
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,700
Sometimes it takes decades to recover
from a tragedy like this.

169
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,600
You only went out with him
for two weeks.

170
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,900
Your mom’s outside.
She says you got into Stanford!

171
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,600

Hello.

172
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,100
- Can you do me a favor?
- Who you lookin’ for?

173
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,000
It’s Shaun.

174
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Shaun, pick up the phone!

175
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
He’s not here.

176
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,100
What?

177
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,900
Will you please just go to the door
and tell me if the mail’s there?

178
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,400
I’m begging you.

179
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,800

Fine, fine.

180
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Do I have to turn on
your computer?

181
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,000
Just go to the front door.

182
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,700
The mail would be in the mailbox.

183
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,700
Okay.

184
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,700
You owe me one, buddy.

185
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,700
Yeah, it’s here.

186
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,900
Today’s the big day, Gary.

187
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,800
- Wow!
- Look at me! I’m--

188
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,500
Where is it?

189
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,000
Come on. Where is it?
Where is the mail?

190
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,000
- I don’t know.
- Are you sitting on it?

191
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,300
Dude, I see it
on the floor.

192
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,500
Yeah.

193
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,100
Push him.

194
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,300
I’m moving your chair.

195
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,300
This is it.

196
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,100
This is my future
right here in this envelope.

197
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Hey, you’re blocking the tube.

198
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,200
Sorry.

199
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,500
"We regret to inform you...

200
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,500
that your application to Stanford
University was not accepted."

201
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,500
Wait. What?

202
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,600
I didn’t get in?

203
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,300
I didn’t get in?

204
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,600
But--

205
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,500
I don’t get it.

206
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,300
I don’t unders--

207
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,000
You’re overreacting, dude.

208
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,000
I didn’t get into college,
and check me out.

209
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,400
I’m kick-ass.

210
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,700
What’s wrong?

211
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Something horrible’s happened.

212
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,200
Is Bob dead?

213
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Did something break?

214
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,500
I got rejected from Stanford.

215
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,100
Baby, I’m sorry.

216
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
It’s okay.

217
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,400
I’m so sorry.

218
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,400
You’re just gonna have to go somewhere
closer to home. That’s all.

219
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,700
And you get to keep living here...

220
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,500
with Lance and Bob...

221
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,700
and me.

222
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,800
Okay, and are you
a student here?

223
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,800
Yes, I’m a student here.

224
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,200
I’m Shaun Brumder.
I’m the class president.

225
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,600
And you didn’t get into Stanford?
Too bad. Tough break.

226
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,100
Where else did you apply?

227
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Nowhere. You told me
I was a shoo-in.

228
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Nowhere. Not even a safety school?

229
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,600
You said shoo-in.

230
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,400
Calm down. Let’s see what we can do.

231
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,400
Looks here like your GPA is--
What, 2.5?

232
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,900
And your S.A.T.s combined are 940.

233
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,500
That’s low.

234
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,300
940? I had a 1 520.

235
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,300
It says 940.

236
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,100
That’s not my transcript.
That’s Shane Brainard’s transcript.

237
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,600
- And you are?
- Shaun Brumder.

238
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
You didn’t?

239
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,200
You couldn’t have.

240
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,400
You sent in the wrong transcript?

241
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,300
What’s up, Shane?

242
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Hey, guys, I got into Stanford.

243
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,100
Cool.

244
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,200
I applied as a joke,
and they let me in.

245
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,600
I’m freakin’ out.

246
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,200
- I didn’t.
- Yes, you did.

247
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,400
- I didn’t.
- Yes, you did!

248
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,400
You just don’t throw accusations
around. This is nobody’s fault.

249
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Yes, it is.
It’s your fault!

250
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,500
You’re screeching at me.

251
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,900
Because you are a moron!
Now listen to me, lady!

252
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,900
Code red! Code red!

253
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Call 911! Code red!

254
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,800
Call 911!

255
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Hey! Watch it.

256
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,500
I got into...

257
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
Yale.

258
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,800
I gotta get outta here.

259
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,700
I gotta get out of Orange County.

260
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,500
Where are you going?

261
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,200
I’m going to my dad’s.

262
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,600
All right. I’m gonna go in there
and I’m gonna say to my dad...

263
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,100
that he abandoned our family, and,
if he wants to make it up to me...

264
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,700
then he can start now by making
a massive donation to Stanford.

265
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Remember when the sea lions
beached themselves in Corona Del Mar...

266
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
and nobody
was doing anything about it?

267
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Well, me getting all hysterical
didn’t help anything.

268
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,200
This is it, Ashley.

269
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,500
I’m gonna tell my dad
I wanna be a writer.

270
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Hey.

271
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Good luck.

272
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Thanks.

273
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,600
- Who are you?
- I’m Shaun.

274
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,900
I’m your brother.

275
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,100
- What are you sucking on?
- My poody.

276
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,400
Well, aren’t you a little old
for a poody?

277
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,300
Jake.

278
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,200
What did you just do?

279
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,300
Go pick up your poody,
or you’re gonna get a time-out.

280
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
Pick up your poody.
That’s it!

281
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,400
Rosa, take Jake upstairs
and give him some Ritalin.

282
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,800
I don’t like your attitude!

283
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,600
I don’t like your attitude!

284
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,200
Isn’t he getting big?

285
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,800
So what’s up with you?
You look great.

286
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,300
You really filled out--
your arms and your chest.

287
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,000
- You been workin’ out?
- No.

288
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,800
Bud is getting so fat.

289
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,000
You should really talk to him.

290
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,500
He’s gonna have a heart attack.

291
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Plus he’s fat.

292
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,500
Goddamn it!
Are you trying to ruin me?

293
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,200
Yeah, where is my dad?

294
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,400
If you do this,
I will eat your face!

295
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,700
Come, my lady
Come, come, my lady

296
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
You’re my butterfly
sugar baby

297
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,500
My lady--

298
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,000
Puppy!

299
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
God! My God! Puppy!

300
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,300
A writer?

301
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,800
What do you have to write about?
You’re not oppressed. You’re not gay.

302
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,200
- Not all writers are gay.
- They’re all poor.

303
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,600
It’s not true. What about Tom Clancy,

304
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,100
Three people
in the history of literature.

305
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,500
The truth is
I don’t care about making money.

306
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,900
I have a burst blood vessel
in my brain.

307
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,200
I could die at any moment, but I keep
plugging away day after day...

308
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
because I want to leave you with
something special-- a business...

309
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,700
a legacy.

310
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,900
- I want my poody!
- Hey, pal, control yourself.

311
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,100
Can you--
Give me that back.

312
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,100
- I want my poody!
- Where’s your mother?

313
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,000
- Will you get in here!
- Yeah, I’m coming!

314
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,700
- Can you get him out of here?
- Okay, okay.

315
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,100
- Doesn’t he need a nap?
- Come here.

316
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,500
- We want him to learn some limits.
- Come on.

317
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,000
Stop it!

318
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,900
This is my life’s work here.

319
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,400
When I started out, I had nothing.
Now look at me.

320
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,000
I’ve got 8 1 /2 million
square feet in Irvine alone.

321
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,000
It’s a goddamn empire,
and I want to leave it to you.

322
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,200
This is the life I want for you.

323
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,200
But what about what I want?

324
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,100
You want to be a writer?

325
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,600
Before that, you wanted to be
a professional surfer...

326
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,000
so it’s a little hard
to take you seriously.

327
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,200
Fine. I don’t want your money.

328
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,800
But just for the record, Dad,
you’ve never done anything for me.

329
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,800
It’s always been about you.

330
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,900
What the--

331
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,900
It’s over. I should just drive my car
into the ocean and get it over with.

332
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,100
Don’t say that.

333
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,700
He was running across PCH.
He didn’t have a tag.

334
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,900
Was I gonna leave him there?
He’d get killed.

335
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,800
- I have something to confess.
- What?

336
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,100
You know how you told me you’d pray
you’d get into Stanford?

337
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Yeah.

338
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,500
The other night,
I prayed for something too.

339
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,400
What?

340
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,900
I prayed that you wouldn’t
get into Stanford.

341
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
Why?

342
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,300
I didn’t think
it was gonna work.

343
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,700
I was sitting here thinking,
whoa, my prayer was answered.

344
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,300
I should be happy.

345
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,200
I got into OCU,
and maybe you can go to OCU.

346
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,900
You can study creative writing,
and I can study marine biology...

347
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,900
and we can be together.

348
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,600
But I just started feeling
really guilty.

349
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,700
But I just started feeling
really guilty.

350
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,300
I mean, this was your dream,
and I’m just being selfish.

351
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,600
I just feel awful.

352
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,900
This is not your fault.

353
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,900
I want to try
and make it up to you.

354
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,600
Thanks, but...

355
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,500
I really don’t think
there’s anything you can do.

356
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,500
Maybe there is. Tanya’s grandfather
is on the board at Stanford.

357
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,000
And Tanya’s my friend,
so maybe she can help us.

358
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,400
My grandfather is not gonna
bend over backwards for just anyone.

359
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,300
Please. Can’t you just help us?

360
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,300
Can’t you see I’m busy?

361
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,100
Why don’t you go
check on the dog?

362
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,100
Give him some water, okay?
I’ll take care of this.

363
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,200
We need to have
a little chat.

364
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,100
Excuse me.

365
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,000
Look, Shaun’s my boyfriend,
and I would do anything for him...

366
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,900
even if that means
breaking a promise to you.

367
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,500
What promise?

368
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,000
Halloween.
Dana’s little brother.

369
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,400
- Everyone knows about that.
- Maybe.

370
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,000
But they don’t know
about Lonny’s memorial.

371
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
I miss Lonny.

372
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,500
Me too.

373
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,000
Hey, I miss Lonny too.

374
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,500
But you promised.

375
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,000
And prom night?

376
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,900
Hi, Grammy. It’s Tanya.

377
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,100
Is Grandpa there?

378
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,400
You are so awesome.

379
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
- But, hey, we should go.
- Yeah.

380
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,800
-Tanya’s grandfather wants to meet you.
-I want to meet him.

381
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,700
He and his wife are gonna
come by your house at 5:00.

382
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,000
- My house?
- Yeah.

383
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,800
Do you know
who lives at my house?

384
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,400
Yeah, that’s right.
Just cover his whole head.

385
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,300
Who are you?

386
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,400
I’m your wife. Cindy.

387
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,400
We met in Maui.

388
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,400
Hey, look.
Bob’s still bleeding.

389
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,800
What’s this--
What is-- My God!

390
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,400
He likes you. Yes.
We found him on PCH.

391
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Get him out of the house.
I don’t allow dogs in here.

392
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,000
But he’s so sweet.

393
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,400
Call the Humane Society.
They’ll have him put to sleep.

394
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,700
Don’t you think we should
put out some cheese and crackers?

395
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,700
They’re gonna be here
in 1 5 minutes.

396
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,300
- Yeah, I know.
- Who’s coming?

397
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:25,100
Mom, you might want to put on
something more, you know.

398
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,100
More what? More what?

399
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,000
What’s going on?

400
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,700
What’s happening?

401
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,700
Sit down. Sit down, okay?

402
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,700
Just sit.
Don’t be nervous.

403
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,000
Someone very important is coming over,
and he’s bringing his wife.

404
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
If he likes me,
he’s gonna get me into Stanford.

405
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,100
- They’re coming over now?
- They’ll be here in a couple minutes.

406
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,100
The house is a mess,
and Bob is bleeding.

407
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,900
You can’t expect me to drop everything
and entertain these strangers.

408
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,900
Drop what?
What were you doing?

409
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,800
Look. This is my last chance
to get into Stanford.

410
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,200
I know, honey,
and it’s not a good day for me.

411
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,400
- I have to go to college.
- Why?

412
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,300
Because that’s what you do
after high school.

413
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,600
Please don’t do this to me.
Please don’t sabotage me.

414
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,200
Every time I try to depend on you,
you start acting like a total lunatic.

415
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Mom?

416
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,000
Mom?

417
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,900
I’m sorry.

418
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,200
So now I’m a bad mother.

419
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,500
You’re not.
Please just put on some clothes.

420
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,500
I sacrificed a lot for you.
I sacrificed Damian for you.

421
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,100
Your tennis instructor.

422
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,800
He was beautiful and Serbian!

423
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,600
When your father left,
I almost married him.

424
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,700
And if I had, we’d be living in a condo,
clipping coupons and eating lunch meat.

425
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,700
So I didn’t.

426
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,700
I married Bob for you.

427
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,100
I had sex with Bob four times
for you.

428
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,400
How can you say I’m a bad mother?

429
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,900
I’m not saying that.

430
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,800
- You know money can’t buy happiness.
- Grow up. Yes, it can.

431
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,600
You and Dad both have money,
and you’re both miserable.

432
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,300
He’s miserable?
Did he say that?

433
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,200
Mom, this is the most decisive
day of my life...

434
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,200
and all I’m asking for is one hour--
one hour with no big scenes...

435
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,100
and no nervous breakdowns
and no Meryl Streep impressions--

436
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,500
just one hour where you act
like a normal, loving parent.

437
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
Can you do this for me?

438
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Yes, I can.

439
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,200
Thank you, Mom.

440
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,100
But I’ll need a glass of wine.
There’s chardonnay in the fridge.

441
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,800
Okay. I’ll be right back.

442
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,800
Don’t move.

443
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,000
I’m really nervous.

444
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,000
Don’t be.
Everything’s gonna be fine.

445
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,800
They’re early.

446
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,300
Some very important people
are coming over.

447
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,500
- Stay in your room.
- Why?

448
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,800
- Because you’re an embarrassment.
- Okay.

449
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,000
They’re here.

450
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,300
I look like a pinata.

451
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
You look great.
Just remember what I said.

452
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,500
No big drunken scenes, okay?

453
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,300
Yeah.

454
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,800
Lupe’s with Bob, Lance is in his room
and Mom is dressed.

455
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,800
How do I look?

456
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,800
Very handsome.

457
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,900
- Now just--just be yourself.
- Okay.

458
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,500
Come on.

459
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You must be Shaun.

460
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,300
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Gantner.

461
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,700
Please come in.

462
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,500
Mrs. Gantner.
Thank you for coming.

463
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,500
- This is my girlfriend Ashley.
- Hi.

464
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,500
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

465
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,000
- You’re friends with Tanya.
- Tanya’s very upset by your situation.

466
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,800
I don’t like it
when my granddaughter is upset.

467
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,600
Tanya has Arthur
wrapped around her little finger.

468
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,000
- That’s right.
- Hello!

469
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,900
Hello.

470
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,600
Hi. I’m Cindy Almond-Beugler.

471
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,200
- I’m Arthur Gantner. My wife Vera.
- How do you do?

472
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,800
Hello. Welcome.

473
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Excuse me.

474
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,800
Won’t you please
make yourselves at home?

475
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,800
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank--

476
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,300
So, tell us about yourself.

477
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,500
Well, I’m a National Merit Scholar...

478
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,600
a straight-A student...

479
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,000
and I want to be a writer.

480
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,400
Do you like John Grisham?
I sure do.

481
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
Shaun’s also our class president...

482
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,600
and he was the representative
at our model UN.

483
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,100
He’s a fabulous kid, Mr. Gantner.

484
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,600
Arthur. Please.
Call me Arthur.

485
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,200
Even as a little boy,
he was so smart.

486
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
I miss those days.

487
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,100
The last few years
have been really hard.

488
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,600
I helped my former husband
start his business.

489
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Soon as he gets a little money,
he starts screwing around on me.

490
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
My goodness.

491
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:36,400
He left me for a 20-year-old
he met at the gym.

492
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,900
I walked in on them at a motel.

493
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,400
She’s got him naked
and handcuffed to the bed.

494
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,000
So we divorced.
I remarried.

495
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,400
Then this new one, Bob...

496
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,900
he starts falling apart, and--

497
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,200
and it’s just one shit storm
after the other.

498
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,800
- Let us in!
- Hurry up!

499
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,600
- Hurry up!
- Come on!

500
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,200
Yo, bro.

501
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,500
We heard you tried
to kill Mrs. Cobb.

502
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,000
Are you on a violent rampage, dude?

503
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,100
What do you want?

504
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,400
All right, bro.
Check it out.

505
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,300
We thought, in Lonny’s memory,
we could go down to Emerald Cove.

506
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,500
We could take his board
and push it out into the ocean.

507
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,500
- Or blow it up.
- Right.

508
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,000
That sounds like a great idea,
and we’ll do it.

509
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,500
But I can’t right now
‘cause I got important people over.

510
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,500
- More important than us, huh?
- No.

511
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,500
- More important than Lonny?
- Of course not.

512
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,000
- This is his birthday, man.
- Yeah, man.

513
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,600
Like, his death birthday.
Doesn’t that mean anything to you?

514
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,000
Just go hang
with your little VIPs.

515
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,300
Sorry we intruded
on your tea party.

516
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,200
If you need us, we’ll be out in
the van picking each other’s butts.

517
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,300
- Naked.
- Huh?

518
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,100
I visited Stanford in the fall.
It’s a beautiful campus.

519
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,900
Isn’t it lovely?
We go up there for football games.

520
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,500
And Arthur is on the board, so--

521
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,300
Excuse me. Sorry.

522
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,600
Have you seen my piss?

523
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,800
My parole officer called.
He wants that piss.

524
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,700
I know I got it around here.

525
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,700
Don’t you see
that we have company?

526
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,900
Hey, what’s up?
There it is.

527
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,700
I am so sorry.

528
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,000
Somebody’s gotta fill this up,
or I’m going to jail.

529
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,600
Would you just
get out of here!

530
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,400
Fine.

531
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,500
I’d like to "protose" a toast.

532
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,700
Shaun has been a wonderful son...

533
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,300
and I want him to be happy.

534
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,400
I’m going to be all alone.

535
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,300
Hey!

536
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,500
Hey! Hey!

537
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,600
Dear God!

538
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,200
Pills!

539
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,600
Mom, you didn’t give Bob
his medication.

540
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,600
Excuse me for a minute.

541
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,400
Dude!

542
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,300
Dude! Where are Bob’s pain pills?

543
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,700
This is Excedrin.

544
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,700
It’s a decoy.
I put my stash in aspirin bottles.

545
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,500
Yellow are painkillers.
They go in the Excedrin.

546
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Listen to me, all right?

547
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,100
I need Bob’s pain pills.

548
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,300
Bob doesn’t have any pain pills.
I sold them, but these are good.

549
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,100
Wait. Yellow are not painkillers.

550
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,400
What are they? Speed. They’re the X.
Painkillers are in the Tylenol.

551
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,200
Give him one of these.
It’ll knock him right out.

552
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,600
Wait. Please.
Where are you going?

553
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,600
You people are sick.

554
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,600
Your mother’s a drunk.
Your brother’s a pervert.

555
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,200
Shame on you
for abusing an old man.

556
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,400
Shame on you
for abusing an old man.

557
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,400
He’s fine.
Tell them you’re fine.

558
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,700
I know how this looks, but I do
everything I can for Bob.

559
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,900
- I love Bob.
- Hey!

560
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,800
Stanford is for the best
and the brightest--

561
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,200
the future leaders of America.

562
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,400
You’ll never go to Stanford...

563
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,300
as long as I have
a breath in my body.

564
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,300
Watch your fingers.

565
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,900
What happened?

566
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,100
You went for a ride.

567
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,500
Are you okay?

568
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,800
I got ya, buddy!

569
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,100
You should sue, man.
This isn’t right. Sue the school.

570
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,900
Shut up.

571
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Just go to Stanford anyway.
Go there and take the classes.

572
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,100
Don’t take "no" for an answer.
Just say, I’m goin’ here. Kiss my ass.

573
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,800
- That’s a good idea.
- What?

574
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,700
I should go up to Stanford.

575
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,400
If I talk with the dean of admissions
and tell him my situation...

576
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,700
he’s gotta let me in.

577
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,700
I can get you there in three hours.

578
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,400
You’re getting into Stanford.
I know it!

579
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,300
Thanks, man.

580
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,700
I have a question for you.
I got something to say.

581
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,400
I’m gonna do something with my life.
Yeah, man.

582
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,000
Good.

583
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,000
I got these ideas.
I got so many ideas.

584
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,400
They’re burning
through my skull, buddy.

585
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,900
I don’t know, like,
hats and shirts.

586
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,400
Like Stussy.
Do you know what?

587
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,700
Stussy got started out making
hats and shirts for surfers in Hawaii.

588
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,200
Now he’s, like, a millionaire.
He parties in Hawaii 24-7!

589
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,800
I could do something like that,
don’t you think?

590
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,000
Like a fuckin’ shirt
that says "Loser."

591
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Or I don’t know. "Talk to the hand"
or something like that.

592
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,000
Those would sell.

593
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,300
Or-- I don’t know.
I got these ideas.

594
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,100
Like a hat,
a big hat that goes--

595
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,900
Watch the road, dumb ass!

596
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,300
People have written me off.
Do you know that?

597
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,300
People have written me off,
like Dad for one.

598
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,500
Just keep your eyes on the road.

599
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,200
Dude, I’m gonna have
the last laugh...

600
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,200
because here’s why.

601
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,700
Some little chumps go to college.
Some little chumps stay home.

602
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,400
Some little chumps eat roast beef.
Some little chumps have none.

603
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,700
This chump’s gonna cry "wee wee wee"
all the way to the biz-neck.

604
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,400
- You know what I’m sayin’?

605
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,200
- I love you, dude.
- I love you too.

606
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,500
We don’t say it enough.
It’s true, and it’s not the drugs.

607
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

608
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,300
I need to talk
to the dean of admissions.

609
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,600
Well, it’s 1 0:30 at night,
so he’s not here right now.

610
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,800
I know, but, you see,
this is an emergency.

611
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,500
I’m sure. You’ll have
to come back tomorrow though.

612
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Could you maybe just
give us his phone number?

613
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,800
What? His phone number?

614
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,800
Please, you guys,
cut me some slack.

615
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,400
Come back tomorrow, all right?
We’re closed.

616
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,400
That’s such crap.

617
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,900
That is such crap.
Screw her.

618
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,900
You know what?
Screw her.

619
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,400
- You cold? Want my jacket?
- Thank you.

620
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,500
Man! She thinks she’s so smart
‘cause she goes to Stanford.

621
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,000
Well, I’m smart too.
I’m gonna pull a MacGyver.

622
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,300
I will break in through a window,
I’ll look around and find a--

623
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
What do you call that thing?

624
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,900
Directory.
You stay here.

625
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,700
I’m gonna be back in 15 minutes
with the directory.

626
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,600
Reconnoiter. 15.

627
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,800
The dean’s probably listed.
You could just call information.

628
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,400
Hey, what are you doing?

629
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,900
Hey, cutie.

630
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,900
What do you want?

631
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,400
Well...

632
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,300
the question is...

633
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
what do you want?

634
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,800
Listen...

635
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,400
do you want me to call
public safety?

636
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,800
Do you want me to get naked
and start the revolution?

637
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,500
I’ll take that as a maybe.

638
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,900
- Yes?
- Mr. Durkett?

639
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,300
- You’re such a liar!
- Girls! I told you. Knock it off!

640
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,100
- Dad, Stephanie stole my flip-flops.
- So deal with it, Gina. Go.

641
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,600
- Yes?
- Liar!

642
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,200
I’m Shaun Brumder. I need
to talk to you about my application.

643
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,100
It’s late. I gotta get up
for a 7:00 flight.

644
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,400
There’s been a big mistake.

645
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,400
I’m sorry. There’s nothing I can do.
Good night.

646
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,900
Yes?

647
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,300
Look, we drove all the way here
from Orange County.

648
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,600
Can’t you just give us
five minutes of your time? Please.

649
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,000
Okay. You have five minutes. Go.

650
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,100
Okay. Stanford University
was my first choice.

651
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,100
I didn’t even apply
to any other schools.

652
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,800
My college counsellor
sent you the wrong transcript.

653
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,600
Show me your transcript.

654
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,100
I left it in the car.
I’ll go get it.

655
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,500
- Please don’t go anywhere.
- Okay.

656
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,300
Don.

657
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,300
- What?
- Where are our bathing suits?

658
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,400
There’s a green-mesh dive bag
on the floor of my closet.

659
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,700
Just look in there.

660
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,100
Who are these people?
Get rid of them.

661
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,800
Could I have one of those?

662
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,200
Yeah.

663
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,800
Thank you.
My head is killing me.

664
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,700
Take two or three.

665
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,900
Thank you.

666
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,600
You can just have
the whole bottle.

667
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,700
When you’re done down there,
I need help closing my suitcase.

668
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,700
Okay. I’ll be up in five minutes.

669
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,600
Coming.

670
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,000
Oh, come on.

671
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,100
Jesus. You look like a beast.

672
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,700
Where’s Shaun?
I need to talk to him.

673
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,300
- Stanford. He’s having a crisis.
- I know all about it.

674
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,000
You’re such a good father,
so good to your kids.

675
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,800
I need a drink.
Do you have any beer, coyote ugly?

676
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,800
This is an excellent transcript.

677
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,100
You should be very proud,
but what can I tell you?

678
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,100
If I’d had this by January 21 ,
you might have had a shot.

679
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,700
I need you.

680
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,700
Excuse me.

681
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,000
What is the big deal?

682
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,600
He’s gonna say no.

683
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,200
Hey, don’t let him say no.

684
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,500
It’s gonna be fine.

685
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,400
Okay. Thanks.

686
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,200
So what’s up with your brother
and aspirin?

687
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,500
Does he get a lot of headaches,
or what?

688
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,500
What is that smell?
What am I sitting in?

689
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,600
Relax. It’s just urine.

690
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,800
Your son was being a real brat today,
a real pain in the ass.

691
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,400
- My son.
- He said I was selfish.

692
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,900
He said that everything’s
always about me.

693
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,900
He called me a drama queen,
said I was trying to sabotage him.

694
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,700
So, how’s Bob?

695
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,100
How’s what’s her face?

696
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,100
She’s sleeping around.

697
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,500
I can’t talk to her.
She doesn’t play tennis.

698
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,600
She’s not a good mother.
She’s not like you.

699
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,500
Want another beer?

700
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,000
Look.

701
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,800
Sometimes I leave the office
at the end of the day...

702
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,500
and I get into my car
and head home...

703
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,200
and, 1 5 minutes later, I’m here--
parked in front of this house.

704
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,000
It’s annoying.
It’s totally out of my way.

705
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,700
I made a mistake. I’m tired of
paying for it. I want you back.

706
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,500
You’re such an asshole.

707
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,200
Which ones were they?

708
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,200
- Excedrin?
- Excedrin. Okay.

709
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,700
Excedrin are pain pills.

710
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,800
- Pain pills.
- Oh, my God!

711
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,600
What?

712
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,800
We just gave the dean of admissions
three hits of--

713
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,100
Where were we?

714
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,300
Well, Mr. Durkett, to me...

715
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,500
Stanford’s not just a school.

716
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,900
It’s my entire reason
for living.

717
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,200
Every night, before I went to bed,
I’d pray that I’d get into Stanford.

718
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,600
And I worked really hard.

719
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,400
And when all my friends
were out having fun...

720
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,600
I stayed in and I studied.

721
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,300
That’s good.
That’s what you have to do.

722
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,300
Eighty-two percent--

723
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,500
Wait a second.

724
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,400
I like you.
What’s your name?

725
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,200
I like you.

726
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,900
I do. I don’t know why.

727
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,900
I just like you.

728
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,200
Thanks.

729
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,400
I feel so good.

730
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,700
Is it me, or is it, like,
hotter than hell in here?

731
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,700
Can you help me?

732
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,200
Yeah. Yeah.

733
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,700
Yes. Yes, I can.

734
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,200
There’s no time.
I’m leaving.

735
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,500
I’m going to Bali
with my family.

736
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,700
I love them so much.

737
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,300
I need water or--

738
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,300
I need to lie down.

739
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,300
Hey, before you do that--

740
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,500
You’re my same height.
That is neat.

741
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,600
It is.
Let’s go to your office...

742
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,600
and you can add my name
to the acceptance list...

743
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,600
before you leave for Bali.

744
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,200
Sounds good.

745
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,700
Man!

746
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,500
The lights are, like, vivid.

747
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,800
Well, it’s a beautiful night.

748
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,600
- You’re so beautiful.
- Thank you.

749
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,700
You know, I really appreciate this.

750
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,700
That’s okay...

751
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,200
‘cause I feel like
I’ve known you forever.

752
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,800
Hey!

753
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,400
I have a confession.

754
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,200
I never went to college.

755
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,900
It’s overrated.

756
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,800
My brother wants
to go here next year.

757
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,300
Well, I hope he’s on this list.

758
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,600
What’s that?

759
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,800
It’s a list of people
they’ve accepted.

760
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,000
They rejected him, the jerks.

761
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,500
Don’t do that.

762
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,800
When I was little,
I was a total pyro.

763
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,000
I was too.

764
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,600
Put that out, man.

765
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,800
- Put it out.
- Whoa!

766
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,500
- Who are you people?
- I’m Shaun Brumder.

767
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,800
You’re going to help me
get into Stanford.

768
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,800
And we’re at your office.

769
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,400
Oh, my God!

770
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,000
Do me a favor. Back that engine out.
We got a knockdown.

771
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,400
That’s negatory, Julio.
I need you to wedge that popper.

772
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,600
Hey! What’s your name?

773
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,000
-Joe--John.
- What is it?

774
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,100
Joe John.

775
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,500
- Your name’s "Joe John"?
-Johnston.

776
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,100
Johnston, Joe.

777
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,300
You wanna tell me
what happened here?

778
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,400
Just a fire.
I don’t know.

779
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
I came by and was...

780
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,400
checking out the fire.

781
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,400
Well, that lady, Mona...

782
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,600
said that you two were in
the building when the fire started.

783
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,100
Yeah, she’s a liar,

784
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,600
So whatever she says is a lie.

785
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,800
You’re saying you weren’t
in the building with that woman?

786
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,500
Not I. All right.

787
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,000
She started it, all right?
Because she was, like...

788
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,400
"I hate my job!
I’m gonna burn this mother down!"

789
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,300
I said, "You better not!
You’d better not!"

790
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,900
- She said it was an electrical fire.
- It was.

791
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,700
It was a total electrical fire.
It was, like...

792
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,200
the switches had sparks coming out,

793
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:59,300
- It was like the Fourth of July.
- Why aren’t you wearing your pants?

794
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,300
I tripped and--

795
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,400
Then I had to take ‘em off
to run faster out of the flames.

796
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,000
I think I inhaled some smoke.

797
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,000
Will you excuse me one second?

798
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,800
I’ll be right back.

799
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,300
We’ve a got a sprinter.
Five-foot-five, no pants...

800
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,500
unkempt, portly.

801
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,600
- You’ll be fine.
- Wait a second.

802
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
This guy thinks
he’s the dean of admissions.

803
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,000
Shaun, so psychedelic.

804
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,200
Buddy, I light one match,
and the building blows up.

805
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,400
I was just trying to help you, bro.

806
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,700
By setting the building on fire?

807
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,700
Well, I was high.

808
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,700
You’re always high.
You’re a drugged-out loser.

809
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,800
You think you’re gonna create
a T-shirt company?

810
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,700
You can’t even dress yourself.

811
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,000
Harsh.

812
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,200
Shaun, I’m so sorry.

813
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,300
I should’ve seen this coming.

814
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,800
The one day I need my family
to come through for me...

815
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,100
they end up doing
what they always do.

816
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,400
My father goes ballistic,
my mother gets plastered...

817
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
and my brother
burns down a building.

818
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,700
It’s like
they’ve all come together...

819
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,200
in some evil conspiracy
to prevent me from getting anywhere.

820
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,100
Is that what you think?

821
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,000
What else am I supposed to think?

822
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,200
You know, I really believed that
you wanted to go to Stanford...

823
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,500
because you wanted to study
with Marcus Skinner.

824
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,900
- That’s not it, is it?
- What are you talking about?

825
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,300
You want to run away.

826
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,200
You want to be free of everybody.

827
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,000
You think by coming up here,
you’re gonna meet people that are...

828
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,300
smarter and saner...

829
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,000
and better.

830
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,900
You know, if you went to Stanford,
that’d be the end of us.

831
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,300
And it doesn’t seem to me like
that thought’s ever crossed your mind.

832
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,900
Ashley, come on!

833
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,800
Shaun, I’m sorry
you didn’t get into Stanford.

834
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,000
But if you think going here...

835
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,100
is the only way you can be
the person you want to be...

836
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,200
then I just feel sorry for you.

837
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,900
What’s going on?
What are you doing in that bathrobe?

838
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,700
I’m not gonna lie to you.

839
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,000
Did you sleep with your ex-wife?

840
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,500
I want a divorce.

841
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,900
Really?

842
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,600
You can have the house.

843
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,800
Really? What about Jake?

844
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,200
I thought we could share custody.

845
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,100
Okay. Great.

846
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,400
But can you take him tonight?

847
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,900
There’s this new club in Newport that’s
supposed to be totally bitchin’.

848
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,300
Oh, okay.

849
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,200
Thanks, Bud.

850
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,600
So you have my pager number
and my cell phone number.

851
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,000
If you need me just call me.
And I think this is a great idea.

852
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,200
Good.

853
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,200
- Later.
- Later.

854
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,600
What are you reading?

855
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,100
Faulkner.

856
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,000
Great writer.

857
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,100
Yeah. Sure.

858
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,600
You’re an English major?

859
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,100
No. I don’t even go here.

860
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,300
So you’re just visiting?

861
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,600
I should probably go.

862
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It was nice meeting you.

863
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,500
I’m going to a party.

864
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,500
You wanna maybe
come check it out?

865
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,600
So do you like Faulkner?

866
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,500
He’s okay.
I mean, he’s kind of boring.

867
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,500
I think I might just get
the "Cliff Notes."

868
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,000
There are some serious cuties
at this party.

869
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,600
And lock me up,
because I am horny!

870
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,600
Guys, this is Shaun.

871
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,500
Oh, my God!
This is our song!

872
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,000
Scrabble? I love Scrabble.

873
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,400
Last time I played, actually,
I threw down the word "mazer."

874
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,600
It’s a type
of small cherry tree.

875
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,600
I even got 50 bonus points.

876
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,400
So, you don’t look familiar.
Are you a freshman?

877
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,200
No, not even.
I’m still in high school.

878
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,300
- Did you apply to Stanford, or--
- No, no.

879
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,800
I’m going to
Orange County University.

880
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,400
- That’s where I’m from.
- I’ve heard of Orange County.

881
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,200
I love it there.
The weather’s great, people are nice.

882
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,900
I really want to be
a marine biologist...

883
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,900
so it’s really the perfect place
for me to study.

884
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,400
What about you?

885
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,900
I’m a comparative literature major.
I want to be a writer.

886
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,100
Fiction, poetry, screenplays,
whatever, you know.

887
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,500
Actually, I have an idea
for a TV show.

888
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,700
It’s about vampires, ostensibly.
But underneath...

889
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,200
it’s actually about
the reunification of Germany.

890
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,100
But it’s funny.

891
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,200
My boyfriend wants
to be a writer too.

892
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,400
Your boyfriend?

893
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,900
Yeah, Shaun.

894
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,200
He’s really talented.

895
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,400
He wrote this great story...

896
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,400
about growing up
in Orange County.

897
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,900
And it’s just
really funny and smart.

898
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,500
But it doesn’t really matter
what I think, so--

899
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,000
Why not?

900
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,100
What’s up?

901
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,600
Is this your boyfriend?

902
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,400
What are you, like,
spying on me?

903
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,200
No! I was--

904
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,400
I was just up on the balcony...

905
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,800
and--

906
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,900
Yeah, I was spying on you.
Who’s this?

907
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,600
I’m Kip.

908
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,200
Yeah, Kip. Let’s go inside
where we can be alone.

909
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,500
Come on, Ash.

910
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,700
Mr. Skinner?

911
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,200
You’re Marcus Skinner.

912
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,100
You’re a good writer.

913
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,000
Thank you.

914
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,000
I’m obsessed with you,
Mr. Skinner.

915
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,200
Not in a sexual way or romantic way
or anything like that.

916
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,900
Just your writing.

917
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,100
I’m Shaun Brumder. I wrote you
a letter a couple of months ago...

918
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,400
and I sent you
one of my stories.

919
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,700
"Orange County."

920
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,900
Yeah!

921
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,000
Yeah, wait.
Did you read it?

922
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,400
Oh, yes. Yeah.
It was a great story.

923
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,400
I can’t--

924
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,500
I’m sorry.

925
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,600
It’s been a long day.

926
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,900
Could you just say what you
just said just one more time?

927
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:22,000
It was a great story.
I really enjoyed it.

928
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,200
Mr. Skinner--

929
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,800
Dude...

930
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,800
you have no idea
what that means to me.

931
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,400
The characters are unique--

932
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,100
well drawn.

933
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,300
The mother-- drunk...

934
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,000
arguing with all the maids.

935
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,000
The brother--
always passing out everywhere.

936
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,000
And I love the girlfriend--
the bleeding heart animal freak.

937
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,200
She was my favorite.

938
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,300
You really love your characters.
It comes through in the writing.

939
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,700
Well, thank you.

940
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,400
I never really
thought about it that way.

941
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,500
My only criticism--

942
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,200
Yes. Oh, please.
It’s what I need.

943
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,400
You need an ending.

944
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,100
I know. I just--
I don’t know how to end it.

945
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,100
You should figure that out.

946
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,100
Maybe I can help you.

947
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,800
Well, I didn’t get into Stanford.

948
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,800
Yeah, so that means
I can’t work with you.

949
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,400
I want to be a good writer,
Mr. Skinner...

950
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,500
but I’m just afraid...

951
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,600
that if I don’t get out
of Orange County...

952
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,600
it’s never gonna happen.

953
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:00,100
You don’t have to be afraid of that.
You are a good writer.

954
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,800
And every good writer
has a conflicted relationship...

955
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,400
with the place where he grew up--

956
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:10,200
Joyce, Faulkner, Tolstoy.

957
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,200
And that’s what I remember
loving about your story.

958
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,700
It’s very conflicted.

959
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,500
‘Cause at the beginning,
you think these people are doomed.

960
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,800
I mean, this family is heading
for disaster, and then...

961
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,500
as you read on,
you see that there exists...

962
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,900
beneath the surface,
these very real connections.

963
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,800
These deep relationships.

964
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,600
What I took
from your story is this--

965
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,400
that even in a world
where people can be superficial...

966
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,900
and stupid and selfish...

967
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,400
there’s still hope.

968
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,700
Was that the message
you were trying for?

969
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,400
Over here.

970
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,400
- Sorry.
- Ow!

971
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,500
- God!
- Sorry.

972
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,700
- God! Lance!
- I’m sorry. It’s just a nick.

973
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,800
Dude, you will never believe
who I just met.

974
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,400
- Who?
- Marcus Skinner.

975
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,900
- I met Marcus Skinner!
- What? Who?

976
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,300
The writer.
He liked my story!

977
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,800
- He liked my story!
- Shut up!

978
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,200
That’s awesome,
but I am going to prison!

979
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,500
- What?
- Some cops are right on my ass.

980
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,300
Listen, I’ve been thinking about it.
We are going to Mexico, buddy.

981
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,800
Right now!
Please?

982
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,700
Oh, God.

983
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:30,000
All right, fine. We’re leaving.
But we gotta get Ashley first.

984
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,300
No, I’m sorry.
No, that’s not in the cards, Broseph.

985
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,400
Listen, she’ll be fine.
Just forget about her.

986
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,600
Some dude’ll pick her up
and give her a nice bed to sleep in.

987
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,100
- Lance.
- Okay!

988
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,100
We will go and get her.
But you gotta follow me...

989
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:44,200
‘cause I am an expert at "excaping."

990
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,200
Let’s go. Fast "excape."
Fast "excapes" are my expertise.

991
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,900
Come on!

992
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,200
Be careful.

993
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,500
Follow me.

994
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,400
Lance, are you okay?

995
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:07,300
Go get the Bronco, Shaun,
and come back for me.

996
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,000
- Okay.
- Dude?

997
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,700
Promise me, dude.

998
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,500
I promise.

999
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,400
The whole time I’m thinking
it’s the alternator.

1000
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:26,600
My bro says to me,
"No, bro, it’s the carburettor."

1001
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,900
It turned out he was right.

1002
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,200
- Would you get in the car?
- I’m mad at you, remember?

1003
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:44,100
I know, but can we talk
about it in the car, please?

1004
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,700
Hey, you heard her.
Why don’t you leave her alone?

1005
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,400
Butt out, dude.
Ashley, get in the car right now.

1006
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,300
Shaun, apologize to her.
Tell her you’re sorry.

1007
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,800
I’m sorry!

1008
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,000
Dude, come on.

1009
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,300
I’m so sorry.

1010
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,100
Now tell her you love her.

1011
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,700
Tell her you love her.

1012
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,800
I love you.

1013
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,800
I love you so much.

1014
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,600
Good. You love him.
He loves you. Now get in...

1015
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,600
the damn Bronco!

1016
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,000
Ashley, now! Now!

1017
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,800
Now!

1018
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,100
Kip, it was really nice
to meet you.

1019
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,200
Get in the car!

1020
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:56,000
What?

1021
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,500
Lance isn’t gonna be able
to hear anything.

1022
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,100
He’s passed out.
He’s not gonna wake up. I promise.

1023
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,900
Okay, you don’t believe me?
Lance. Lance!

1024
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,700
See? Nothing.
He’s out cold.

1025
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,200
Like a light.
Come on.

1026
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,500
It’ll be fine.
I promise, okay?

1027
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,200
Clearly, you’re not an expert
on negotiations...

1028
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,700
so let me walk you through this.

1029
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,000
You come in with a proposal
that’s over the top.

1030
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,500
You want a new gymnasium--

1031
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:57,000
Then I counter with a lowball offer,
like $2,000 for a medicine ball.

1032
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,000
- That is absurd and offensive.
- What?

1033
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,500
It’s offensive, sir.
Stanford University doesn‘t--

1034
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,300
- We already have a medicine ball.
- You’re not hearing me.

1035
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,000
- I believe it’s you who’s not--
- You’re not hearing me!

1036
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,300
Drink your milk.

1037
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,200
I don’t want milk.
I want my poody.

1038
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,800
Well, your poody’s been retired.

1039
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,500
You’re a little big for--
Where are you going?

1040
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,100
What--

1041
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,600
You don’t want the milk?
Fine. You want some juice?

1042
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,000
Yes. Okay.

1043
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:30,200
Go to the fridge, open it up
and get yourself some.

1044
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,000
And get some for me
while you’re at it.

1045
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:37,500
You’re helpful.
Finally, some help around here.

1046
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,800
Hey, guys, what’s up?

1047
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,800
Hey, what’s up, dude?
Hey, dude, check this out.

1048
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,700
Last night
we were at this party...

1049
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,500
and little Arlo here decides to
profess his undying love for me.

1050
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,500
Did I tell you
he was a fruitcake or what?

1051
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,100
That’s not true.
This is the real story, dude.

1052
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,400
Chad crashed at my house, right?

1053
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,300
And I woke up in the night.
He was fondling my--

1054
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:16,100
Dude, I lost my keys.
I was looking for ‘em.

1055
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,900
- Do you guys want to come in?
- All right.

1056
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,700
- What are you doing here?
- Hello, everybody.

1057
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,900
- Hey, Bob.
- How was your trip?

1058
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,900
It was okay.

1059
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,200
Just come back with an offer.

1060
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,400
Well, we don’t have to
dot the I’s and cross the T’s.

1061
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,600
You have your people,
I have my people.

1062
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,900
I’ll call you back.
My kids just walked in the door.

1063
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,100
Hi, guys.

1064
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,800
Dad, what--

1065
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,600
Mom, what is going on?

1066
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,500
Something happened last night.

1067
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,100
Your mother and I, we--

1068
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,000
Well--

1069
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,200
You banged Mom?

1070
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,500
That’s not the word
I would use, but...

1071
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,300
yes, we came together.

1072
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,800
- Are you serious?
- Guess what else we did?

1073
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,900
I’ve been on the phone
all morning with Stanford.

1074
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,000
Your mother and I donated the money
for a new admissions building.

1075
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,400
I guess the old one burned down.

1076
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,000
We got you into Stanford, Shaun.

1077
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,400
- You did that for me?
- Yeah.

1078
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,400
Really?

1079
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:51,600
- Yeah, bro, way to go, man.
- We’re stoked, dude.

1080
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,300
Stanford!

1081
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,100
Congratulations, Shaun.
That’s-- That is awesome.

1082
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,700
I was just up in my room
thinking about Faulkner...

1083
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,100
and wondering if he had left
the South...

1084
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,100
would he have ever written a
Light in August?

1085
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,400
Or what if James Joyce
had left Ireland?

1086
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:15,600
Well, I mean, he did leave Ireland,
but not in his heart.

1087
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,300
Do you see what
I’m getting at here?

1088
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,100
I don’t need to go to Stanford
to be a writer.

1089
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,700
All I need are
the people who inspire me...

1090
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,300
Like my friends...

1091
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,800
and my family....

1092
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,400
and you.

1093
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:46,300
So I’m gonna stay.
I’m gonna stay in Orange County.

1094
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,500
You are!

1095
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,100
Stanford sucks!

1096
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,800
"Dear Mr. Skinner,
I’m writing you to say thank you...

1097
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,700
for all your words of wisdom.

1098
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,000
It took me a while,
but I finally realized...

1099
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,200
Orange County
is the perfect environment...

1100
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,800
for an aspiring writer.

1101
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,900
Today I went down to the beach
with a copy of your book.

1102
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,900
I left it there by the water.

1103
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,600
Maybe another mixed-up kid
will stumble upon it.

1104
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,800
And maybe it will change his life
like it changed mine.

1105
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,200
Later, Mr. Skinner.

1106
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,300
Yours truly, Shaun Brumder. "

1107
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,900
Dude, don’t touch!
I’m lighting the fire.

1108
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,900
It was my idea,
and you’re an idiot.

1109
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,500
You’re gonna blow off your hand.
Give me the lighter.

1110
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,300
Dude, Lonny would have wanted me
to blow up his board, dude.

1111
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,600
- Lonny thought you were a tool.
- Lonny thought you were a fool.

1112
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:08,000
- Hey, guys, what are you doing?
- Gonna blow up Lonny’s board, man.

1113
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,600
- It’s gonna be explosive.
- We got so many M-80s.

1114
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,600
It’s gonna be like
the Fourth of July.

1115
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,500
- Dude, what are you doing?
- I’m going surfing!

1116
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,800
All right!

1117
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,100
Come on! Let’s go!
