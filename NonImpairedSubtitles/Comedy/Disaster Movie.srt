00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,325
10,001 Before Christ

4
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:02,863
Fuck you!

5
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,695
Did the Wolf <i> Gotcha! </ i>

6
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,320
What?

7
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:29,489
It is an official mark,
that obtained from my record.

8
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,326
There are many things over which they must pass.

9
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,294
I had to arrangements on the Internet,

10
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,998
I have to do a site of stupidity,
when you register a catchy phrase.

11
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,501
I burst!

12
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,236
Then I'll get another person.

13
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,873
Well, get up,
man, get up!

14
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,111
The opponent, Will!

15
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,112
Yes!

16
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,981
And in another corner, The Wolf!

17
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,618
3, 2, 1 ...

18
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,287
He got it wrong "wolf"!

19
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,689
"We do not believe I was kidding!"

20
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,059
It was not to discourage you.

21
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,896
Come on, it does not help.

22
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,266
A fool that is my way!

23
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,669
Come on! You want a bit of me?

24
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,838
I am a son of a bitch in the ring!

25
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,239
Oh, yes!

26
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,714
They are small in any way ...

27
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:29,116
damn!

28
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:54,875
Wild.

29
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,546
Amy Winehouse?

30
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:05,719
Get lost!

31
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,356
Don 't want to mess with a Bitch,
not drunk!

32
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,562
Like the dinosaurs were
destroyed in the Ice Age

33
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,964
You also

34
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,433
become an extinct species.

35
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,603
When? How long do we have?

36
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:26,673
Damn! Calm down!
You speak too quickly,

37
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,677
I can not hear me, even
think. My head hurts!

38
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,913
Or perhaps the
I had gases.

39
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,848
God, which was good!

40
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:38,151
O God, I love drinking petrol!

41
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,220
It is excellent for voice exile.

42
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,624
This is my little secret.

43
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:44,691
How long do we have?

44
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,194
Let's see ...

45
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,129
Wait a minute ...

46
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:51,899
All right.

47
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,501
Well, let's take a look.

48
00:03:58,172 --> 00:03:59,640
Now, all appear on "Facebook" ...

49
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,074
This typing

50
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:07,181
The end of the world
will take place on August 29.

51
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:13,887
God ...

52
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:17,758
By the bottom jaws!

53
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:07,608
Badalhoca!

54
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,544
Take note of my words,

55
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,579
man of the mountains ...

56
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,147
....,

57
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,683
Great Hunter!

58
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:24,091
You can do it with this!

59
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,162
Crystal Skull?

60
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,100
This is ... really no more time,
I do that just for fun.

61
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:43,644
Cruz credo ...

62
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,219
I knew I should not take all this Viagra.

63
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:03,463
Amy!

64
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,666
Wake up, honey, I
I had a dream eestranho!

65
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,001
Amy!

66
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:14,575
Flava--tasty!

67
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,110
I have your baby, a little of
"Flava love!

68
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,082
Get the fuck out, Flava!

69
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,752
Aiiii, Flava--tasty!

70
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:30,224
What was that?

71
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,027
What? I told you not
we have a serious relationship ...

72
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,231
I know! But ... Flava?

73
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:39,733
Will ...

74
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,238
I want to go to the next level.

75
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,745
I love you ...

76
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,714
I also like you.

77
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,091
I do not understand. I think if
approaching the end of the world.

78
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,562
This is very interesting for those who
says he has problems with commitments.

79
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,168
Although, Jojo.

80
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:17,938
Papaste the Jojo?

81
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,407
Goodbye, Will.

82
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,945
Still come to my party of 16?

83
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,080
You have 25 years!

84
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,482
I never had one!

85
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,703

89
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,859
Will! Happy birthday!

90
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,830
Look at me!

91
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,034
Hairy of the girls are wild

92
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,171
Hi, Will, here I am your brother,
Dr. Phil.

93
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:07,781
Hey, let me show you why my colleagues,
usually call me "Dr.acaricias well."

94
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,149
Hi, honey.

95
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,522
Unsafe!

96
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,524
come back here,
"Breasts--small!"

97
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,126
Hey, Will!

98
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,395
Where is that girl, your fan, Amy?

99
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,564
not to let him escape!

100
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,265
It is a flower of high quality!

101
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,634
a true piece, just like that.

102
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,336
Come back here, you bitch!

103
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:30,871
Nice.

104
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,777
IO is done!

105
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:38,679
....

106
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:49,823
He sleeps like a baby.

107
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,626
You can put your hands
him in cement.

108
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,397
I've done this before,
I toss the coin.

109
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:58,265
crown.

110
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,070
fell to the contrary.

111
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,117
certeiro.

112
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,225
Those guys are trying to steal our drinks.

113
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,293
What?

114
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:30,797
We will get the alcohol, the girls drunk
and finally managed to get cookies!

115
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,567
-- Good idea, "Coolaberry"!
-- Yes, I know.

116
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,369
Like "Coolaberry"!

117
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,503
For to say that!

118
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,839
"Coolaberry "!...

119
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,440
God, you are a fool!

120
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:44,411
Give me that!

121
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,948
Nobody I can myself
steal my drink!

122
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,316
Give them a tirooo!

123
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,123
Lisa, as I do that?
I have a clean shot.

124
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,000
Shoot a bullet in effect.

125
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,068
What?

126
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:12,539
You can control the bullet's path as you want.

127
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,113
Do not tell him what fazer.É my man!

128
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,683
Get lost, bitch! You're not gonna want to mess with me!

129
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,719
Game of the Divas (www)

130
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:41,869
Come on, bitch!

131
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,687
Take it, bitch!

132
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,729
Now is your time to get to the bottom!

133
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:16,203
It's time to teach you ...

134
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,940
manners ...

135
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,192
....

136
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,626
Left foot on yellow!

137
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,230
Calvin ... Calvin!

138
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,567
You gonna turn the bullet's path,
or what?

139
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,868
Hallo!

140
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,270
Yeah, right, you are right.

141
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,077
My work and my patients,

142
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:58,779
"Bothers me ...

143
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,250
Sorry, Phil.

144
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,225
Crap. I can do that.

145
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,833
Shit, Hurry up!

146
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,736
Just bend the bullet!

147
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,005
I know you got the power.

148
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:49,663
Nice shot, man of ass!

149
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:01,108
June why do not want abortion

150
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:04,344
Now is the coaliþia
Barney Frank to power?

151
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:08,949
I can take you from a shoulder
and do it myself.

152
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:14,321
As Linn Jamie Spears
create their babies,

153
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:17,958
and it seems comtigo and not
with George Clooney

154
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:22,763
I just sold the baby
who has more on Ebay.

155
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:27,401
Call up: 5 euros
Grantor: Brangelina.

156
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:31,004
You're a teenager sarcastic
that acts like ...

157
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:49,523
-- Do you know if the Amy come here, tonight?
-- No, she is your girl!

158
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:52,526
In fact, done.

159
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:54,828
She left you?

160
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,563
You got dumped?

161
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,966
-- No.
-- Apamhaste her in bed with another guy?

162
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:02,135
I saw "The memories of a
Gheiser, I know she goes with everything!

163
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,670
I'm involved with it.

164
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:06,240
And why, you finished?

165
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,275
I was not working.

166
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,879
Better finish now
than a pledge,

167
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,548
you know? you gotta stop being afraid
Commitments to

168
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,918
I know exactly, how this will end.

169
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,187
I also know that iste my fear, began when,
Dad was left when I was little ..

170
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,657
Look it's there.

171
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,296
Look at the guy who came with her!

172
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,865
It seems to have had trouble
find an underwear model.

173
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,040
Forget it kid,
you will have something to cheer ..

174
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,114
Why trade you a band?

175
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:50,417
What better way to commemorate their
super--teen party?

176
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,519
Super School's music!

177
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:19,146
Come on, guys, let's spend,

178
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,683
It's good to see you all.

179
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:27,054
Rich girl who likes me,

180
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:31,225
And the priest that if I throw the well.

181
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:35,562
I remember the feeling of time
when I was in college

182
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:38,432
I tried.

183
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:44,021
Amy after it broke my heart,
I found someone,

184
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:47,875
I think his name was "Caliente."

185
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:52,079
We will all be friends
forever,

186
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,416
At least that a Disaster,
in destroying the same day.

187
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:00,587
We will be friends forever

188
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:05,425
because that would be
a day of shit.

189
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,129
1, 2, 3, 4!

190
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:13,133
After he left,
My heart was broken

191
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:17,371
so I started to think with your head.

192
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:21,708
Got a blackboard.
I thought it was my

193
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,779
and the Jonas Brothers, and put everything in a row.

194
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,950
Girl, girl, this is not good,

195
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,921
you have to stop sleeping with everyone.

196
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,357
-- Hey, what?
-- Eiei au!

197
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:41,293
Two hearts that love really is

198
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:45,566
Always deserve a great prize!

199
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:05,285
We will be friends forever

200
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:09,823
At least that a Disaster,
in destroying the same day.

201
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:13,727
We will be friends forever

202
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:18,999
because that would be
a day of shit.

203
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,269
1, 2.3, 4.

204
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:25,239
JT is here! Justin T.!

205
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,349
You only through a reality ...

206
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:37,417
You do not trust me ...

207
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,428
All the beautiful women

208
I ate some beautiful girls

209
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,633
Britney, Cameron, Scarlett, all

210
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,002
They proved my taste.

211
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:56,103
.....

212
00:18:57,271 --> 00:19:00,040
They had only
a chance ...

213
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:04,178
-- I Love,
-- Lance Bass.

214
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:07,381
Lance Bass? And Jessica Simpson!

215
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:24,733
I'm looking for Jesus

216
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,036
everything is for Jesus.

217
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:30,502
Damn!

218
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:35,676
My God, you are not people from meeting
Batista ... Yeah, but asked asked that?

219
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,279
I can not hear ... Let's see ... "They are a'cercar me ."...

220
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,980
What? "A" ...

221
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,067
A ", a write--in," Daah!

222
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:45,519
Here is a launch!

223
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,695
We will be friends forever

224
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,866
At least that a Disaster,
in destroying the same day.

225
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:03,003
We will be friends forever

226
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:08,242
because that would be
a day of shit.

227
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,779
1, 2, 3, 4, hurray!

228
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:26,727
What the hell was that?

229
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,862
<i> This is an emergency. </ i>

<i> Something is happening in the city. </ i>

234
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,073
Ooo, Fuck you!

235

239
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,789
God, we die!

240
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:59,459
Take a Xanax, Javi!

241
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:03,664
I acted just like you, a
concert of Iggy em'73.

242
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,065
What?

243
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:09,636
All right, Moody. Tas surprised?

244
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:12,739
I have a dim view.

245
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,308
For your general culture,
Battle--groin Galaxy,

246
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:22,449
Smiling Grape those are not even Cornelius
nemuritorul original Knocktimber.

247

I do not noticing anything DOQU tas saying.

250
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:36,864
Because the video speak painfully
rights for people of intelligence.

251
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,775
Now is the time to
feed the "bastard".

252
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:06,326
<i> This is an emergency. </ i>

253
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:11,131
Amy!

254
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:12,499
Are you OK?

255
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:13,901
Yes

256
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:16,503
Because you another trade
guy to my apartment?

257
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:18,071
Why you care?

258
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:19,039
Because ...

259
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:22,209
I do not care.

260
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:25,279
I'm off

261
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:27,481
Later, bitch!

262
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:29,817
You know, Will?

263
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,585
Every time we made love,

264
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:33,720
I was thinking about another guy.

265
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:36,089
Me too!

266
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:41,361
Damn!

267
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:42,596
Will!

268
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,231
You gotta hear this!

269
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,468
<i> The earthquake caused a leakage of
gas that destroyed the ghetto. </ i>

273
00:22:58,645 --> 00:22:59,578
End of the world.

<i> Pinkberry tocme has just been destroyed! </ i>

275
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:08,522
Like my dream.

276
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,095
<i> Pinkberry tocme has just been destroyed! </ i>

277
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:37,252
It is the Armageddon, the end of the World

278
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:40,254
I kill, the same me!

279
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:01,308
My God!

280
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:03,377
Hanna Montana died!

281
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,015
No!

282
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,685
Goodbye to all my fans!

283
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,487
The party continues!

284
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:24,531
She is a cabinet of treasures!

285
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:31,645
Also, ask your parents

286
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:35,387
for you to buy
Official lacheira "Hanna Montana"

287
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:39,546
the trap of cheese "Hanna Montana"
and toilet paper "Hanna Montana"!

288
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:41,480
And Make sure you going to

289
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:45,085
Hanna Montana concert
This Wednesday,

290
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,354
87 on Central.

291
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:53,827
I spent two days in a row
to get these tickets!

292
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:55,462
Damn!

293
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:04,371
You know those pictures too
sensual and provocative, to me?

294
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:09,977
Were made entirely
without my permission.

295
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:13,312
But if you look at pictures,

296
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:17,551
was wearing my new line
sexy lingerie "Hanna Montana"!

297
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:21,241
It was an opportunity that could not be missed!

298
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:33,200
God! Hanna Montana
is actually Miley Cyrus

299
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:36,301
Daah, do not tell me, Sherlock!

300
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:40,072
I changed only a little voice,
and put a wig.


301
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:43,076
Even the children
to know the difference!

302
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:47,381
So twice the gain
money and seeing twice as many products.

303
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,815
Only recalling, my new CD:

304
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,920
"The other legacy of Miley Cyrus."

305
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,154
Will be available in all stores,

306
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:57,858

00:25:57,893 --> 00:26:00,327
late 1995!

308
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,203
Help us!
There is nobody who can help us?

309
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:13,207
Fly High With Aspiration

310
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:15,275
Hancock!

311
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:18,045
Hancock!

312
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:20,781
We need help.

313
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,950
Wake up, your drunk of shit!

314
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:27,955
Move your ass bitch, flies apart
and solve this mess,!

315
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,092
Man of Cuuuuuuuu!

316
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:39,565
Rays, of course not!

317
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,335
I will rather bazaar, here.

318
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:50,911
Sorry.

319
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:01,805
Holy shit!

320
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,132
He comes from this side!

321
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,389
What do we do?

322
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:05,792
Let's get away from here!

323
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,366
Come here! Come on!

324
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,393
And now?

325
00:27:23,428 --> 00:27:24,777
Wait a minute.

326
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:29,149
I will wait here until
pass the storm.

327
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,187
Hey!

328
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:41,411
This is our hideout.

329
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:44,097
Put yourself go!
Right, Carrie?

330
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:46,934
Hello, darling!

331
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:52,039
Unless you want to fight.

332
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:54,274
We do not want problems.

333
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:02,649
I never back ..

334
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:03,582
Get some!

335
00:28:03,617 --> 00:28:06,753
As you can see,
I already did.

336
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:12,324
And then I thought:

337
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,431
can a girl like me in New York,
hit a pregnant teenager?

338
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:19,299
I wonder ...

339
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:21,969
Like Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV,

340
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:23,837
I have to agree with you.

341
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:55,636
I am in time to breastfeed.

342
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,934
Muuu!

343
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,614
God!

344
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,790
-- These are your feet?
-- Yes
345
00:29:16,825 --> 00:29:18,492
These are the feet of my son.

346
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:23,464
Smell it!

347
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:26,467
And prove it!

348
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,237
Suck my placenta!

349
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:34,807
Yes!

350
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:38,145
God! Carrie! Carrie,
my dear, they right?

351
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,515
Come on, ladies, come on
get out of here now!

352
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:48,922
What the hell is happening?

353
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:49,788
I do not know.

354
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:52,493
Wake, and feel the temperature.

355
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:56,296
I know it is an awkward truth, but
is called "global warming".

356
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,498
No.

357
00:29:58,098 --> 00:29:59,333
It is not global warming!

358
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:03,270
Amy Winehouse she appeared in a dream

359
00:30:03,737 --> 00:30:05,339
After I fought with a
American gladiator.

360
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:07,774
I think it has something to do with
the crystal skull ...

361
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,678
Come on! O fool, Winehouse?

362
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:12,963
Crystal Skull?

363
00:30:12,998 --> 00:30:14,214
You look like a fool.

364
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:15,382
Remember, is getting late.

365
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:17,918
Let's spend the night here,
And wait until the storm passes.

366
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:19,553
Freezing!

367
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:21,588
We get the clothes.

368
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:24,490
Why?

369
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:26,960
Our bodies produce more heat if they are together.

370
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:30,697
Otherwise, did not survive tonight.

371
00:30:31,632 --> 00:30:32,833
Yes ... yes.

372
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,234
He is right.

373
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:47,281
I think my water will burst.

374
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:53,787
Sorry.

375
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:00,527
I have something to tell you.

376
00:31:00,562 --> 00:31:01,662
Actually, I am not a banker.

377
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:03,897
-- I am a "JUMP".
-- A what?

378
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:05,666
Can I travel in space and time.

379
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:37,331
I hope they stay together forever!

380
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:39,133
I love you!

381
00:31:41,668 --> 00:31:42,436
Goodbye.

382
00:31:46,874 --> 00:31:48,759
I am Prince Caspian,

383
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:50,644
I came to save, Narnia!

384
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:54,681
A little help please ...

385
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:58,018
Guys?

386
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:04,725
It is the kind of Star Wars!

387
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:11,231
What?

388
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,467
Well ... We saw your dream.

389
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:18,971
Boy got a bad relationship with Amy.

390
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:21,341
I wonder what could head say
a girl of whom like.

391
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:24,244
What is fires, sexy,
it has a good job ...


392
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,347
This girl is not for your nose!

393
00:32:27,382 --> 00:32:29,049
Yes, yes it is!

394
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,219
Sure. She has to
lead with your bad breath.

395
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,956
Not to mention
you have an abnormal ass.

396
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:42,830
Put your shirt.

397
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,966
Ok. You're right, you're right,
I screwed up Amy with.

398
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:50,604
Should not screen lets go.

399
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:54,773
Jesus Christ!

400
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,477
This was an earthquake.

401
00:32:56,944 --> 00:32:57,878
OK, there it is:

402
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:00,080
We have to get out of this damn town.

403
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:01,148
What do you say?

404
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:05,385
Why the hell, let me back?

405
Be calm staff.

406
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:13,727
The disaster is under control.

407
00:33:13,762 --> 00:33:15,162
The city is safe.

408
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,911
Like I said, still
come on, everything is under control.

409
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:37,117
I will bug out of here

410
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,691
What was that?

411
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:47,594
Are you OK?

412
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,129
Are you OK?

413
00:33:50,164 --> 00:33:52,965
-- Will, I am, Amy.
-- Amy! Where are you?

414
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,203
I am at work. Was
was concerned about the artifacts.

415
00:33:56,837 --> 00:33:57,604
You okay?

416
00:33:58,705 --> 00:33:59,439
I'm afraid.

417
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,375
You gonna be OK, I promise. Listen ...

418
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,311
I have something to tell you.

419
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:07,815
You were right when it said.
I was an idiot.

420
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:12,986
I love you.

421
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:23,797
What do you think? I still love her?

422
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:29,636
A call interrupted <i>
can f ** a conversation. </ I>

423
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:32,439
Tell a bitch of shit!

424
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:38,779
Man of ass!

425
00:34:38,814 --> 00:34:40,347
Hello, Amy?

426
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:42,249
Crap!

427
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:48,889
I have to go back.

428
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:49,855
What?

429
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,825
Amy is in trouble problems, back then.

430
00:34:52,326 --> 00:34:54,261
I let her go before,
I will not lose it again!

431
00:34:54,296 --> 00:34:57,865
Boy, these crazy!
Is there any type of disaster in the city!

432
00:34:58,031 --> 00:35:00,000
If not, we now bazaar,
we die!

433
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:01,902
I have to do that.

434
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:03,704
You continue.

435
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:10,176
No, You're my brother,
I will comtigo.

436
00:35:10,211 --> 00:35:12,779
Yes I mean, we are already
this together, so ...

437
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,283
.. what's problems
I could could hold out?

438
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:21,054
I mean, most of which are swollen
Vince Vaughn in "The Break--Up" or

439
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:22,823
Vince Vaughn in Fred Claus ...

440
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:25,926
I think only Vince Vaughn in general.

441
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:27,895
Though.

442
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,600
Lisa, come on!

443
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:35,002
Malta ...

444
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:35,868
Although, baby!

445
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:37,838
I have a bad feeling
in relation to this.

446
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,044
Lisa!

447
00:35:45,078 --> 00:35:46,246
Mataram, the Lisa!

448
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:47,815
Lisa!

449
00:35:48,682 --> 00:35:50,367
Mataram, the Lisa!

450
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:52,052
Come on, come on!

451
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:03,497
Sorry,
for his girlfriend.

452
00:36:03,864 --> 00:36:06,633
"The sense" to
His girl, "kimosabe.

453
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:07,987
I'm sure you are destroyed

454
00:36:07,988 --> 00:36:11,975
Siegfried Roy became worse after being
attacked by the white Bengal tiger.

455
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:13,373
Lisa was a beautiful girl.

456
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,952
Lisa!

457
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:27,654
Where am I?

458
00:36:28,622 --> 00:36:30,390
That charming place!

459
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:34,595
Everything is so clean and fresh!

460
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:40,267
Wonderful!

461
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:42,603
What kind of magical creature are you?

462
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:50,878
My dear prince,

463
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:58,755
I apeguei in you.

464
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:03,724
Honey, you landed on my lap ...

465
00:37:05,246 --> 00:37:06,818
Let me guess.

466
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:10,943
An evil witch you Bani
in its history.

467
00:37:12,703 --> 00:37:15,707
No, my dear adolescents.

468
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:19,226
Actually, I am just a beggar,
Nick to live in the sewer.

469
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:21,357
Nice.
How you got there?

470
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:29,701
Drugs. Many, many, many, many
charming drugs!

471
00:37:32,978 --> 00:37:34,237
I do not do that.

472
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:39,376
This is getting dangerous.

473
00:37:39,627 --> 00:37:42,466
Let us bias,
if you want to survive.

474
00:37:42,601 --> 00:37:44,230
-- Okay.
-- Okay.

475
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:45,625
Goodbye, wait ...
I go with you.

476
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:46,594
Yes, you!

477
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:50,026
National Museum of History
is right in the middle. Va--mos walking.

478
00:37:56,013 --> 00:38:00,830
Dreams and fairy tales,
my true love.

479
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:06,521
talks to squirrels
and magic of ... and many things.

480
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,941
Princess, wait, where are you?

481
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,355
And who is this horrible warrior?

482
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,858
I am your new boyfriend, and you who is?

483
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,251
Very funny, Highness,
I am the Prince Eduadrdo.

484
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:23,983
-- Princess, it is your pimp?
-- Thank God, yes.

485
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,591
But no matter,
I can not have multiple boyfriends.

486
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:31,746
What to do?

487
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:38,576
can fight, one against another
who win stay with me.

488
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:47,408
Tas ready for Step--Up (street dance)?

489
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:51,065
Wait, as in the first film "Step Up"

490
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:53,836
where the boys dancing in the street, were challenged
by the academy?

491
00:38:53,837 --> 00:38:59,164
No, I'm thinking "Step Up 2", where
challenged the dancers and street dancers of the academy.

492
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:01,277
Strangelove in your wave!

493
00:39:05,628 --> 00:39:07,337
To start, here I come!

494
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,887
It was only my sleeve.

495
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,010
Look for this loser! 
496
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,849
Must have been something.

497
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:51,086
Give some space! Get out!

498
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:01,428
rays, that girl dance!

499
00:40:12,782 --> 00:40:15,501
Probably has a lot of practice,
he is not a common girl.


500
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:17,000
Look how it spins!

501
00:40:19,747 --> 00:40:20,920
I want to dance.

502
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:23,443
I am not sure whether,
can go.

503
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:28,100
--Not sure, there can handle the pressure not!
Strangelove--ready!

504
00:41:19,782 --> 00:41:21,427
I will yes, Bazaar here!

505
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:25,990
It's all yours, brother.

506
00:41:29,189 --> 00:41:31,433
get away, get away!

507
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:41,103
Nobody will save us?

508
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:42,770
We need a hero!

509
00:41:51,419 --> 00:41:53,027
I am the Iron Man!

510
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:59,240
Wow, that cow until it rains!

511
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:02,046
Damn, this is very crazy!

512
00:42:05,878 --> 00:42:07,793
Now it makes me furious!

513
00:42:11,118 --> 00:42:13,575
I came away with this!

514
00:42:17,336 --> 00:42:19,414
fuck! Another cow?

515
00:42:26,806 --> 00:42:27,812
What was that?

516
00:42:28,586 --> 00:42:29,699
was not cool!

517
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,376
Look at me! Look at my hand!

518
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:34,250
It is the arm of a lobster!

519
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,251
What it ...

520
00:42:35,663 --> 00:42:38,465
what a guy has to do to,
get out of hell?

521
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:44,590
I am not nervous.

522
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:46,986
not gonna like to see me nervous.

523
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:51,249
There are aspects of my personality,
you can not control.

524
00:43:10,094 --> 00:43:12,051
He did not even hit him with a cow!

525
00:43:18,044 --> 00:43:20,065
We are not going to enter the museum.

526
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:21,776
I know she is still alive!

527
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:23,026
<i> Hello, Jojo? </ i>

528
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,728
Jojo? No, no, I am!

529
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,408
Will, Will, I'm stuck.


530
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:33,136
<i> <i> A statue fell on egícia
me during the earthquake. </ i>. </ i>

531
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:35,507
<i> Keep yourself calm, Amy, stay calm .. </ i>

532
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:37,089
I am full of fear,
with great fear.

533
00:43:38,861 --> 00:43:41,562
Wait, Amy, listen to me ...
Do not panic.

534
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,562
I go there, I promise you!

535
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:52,301
Amy? Amy!

536
00:43:54,671 --> 00:43:56,869
Malta, I will return to search it!

537
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,824
You can save it, you'll be dead!

538
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:03,744
Come on! move comes!

539
00:44:03,745 --> 00:44:05,622
Come immediately. Hold on!

540
00:44:06,952 --> 00:44:09,175
Amy? No! No!

541
00:44:09,176 --> 00:44:10,176
-- You can go back!
-- Amy!

542
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,276
I know that I'm crazy pension

543
00:44:21,277 --> 00:44:24,555
But all these disasters have
something to do with the crystal skull.

544
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,983
It seems that it is very PMDD.

545
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:27,984
PM what?

546
00:44:28,474 --> 00:44:30,789
Much information at once?

547
00:44:31,144 --> 00:44:35,355
Why not just say the word,
Because when you use acronyms?

548
00:44:35,356 --> 00:44:39,004
relax, not LL LL Cool J.

549
00:44:39,775 --> 00:44:42,802
Stop this conversation.

550
00:44:43,095 --> 00:44:44,861
Now, who is hungry?

551
00:44:53,955 --> 00:44:55,564
oh, it is delicious!

552
00:44:56,585 --> 00:44:57,640
That matters.

553
00:44:57,641 --> 00:44:58,641
Bon appetite!

554
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:02,007
-- You want some?
-- No.

555
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:10,479
What?

556
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,612
I have to answer the phone.

557
00:45:23,793 --> 00:45:26,023
Oh. .. crap.

558
00:45:26,296 --> 00:45:27,463
Only a little.

559
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:43,164
You are cool.

560
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:47,608
I do it forever.

561
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:53,279
What is it?

562
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:58,290
Hey, guys ...

563

564
00:46:01,517 --> 00:46:03,632
I have to say le, what happened

565
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:09,838

566
00:46:15,196 --> 00:46:15,928

00:46:17,112 --> 00:46:18,209
Lisa is dead!

568
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,367
Of course I am ... LOL!

569
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,257
I met a princess ... Caliente!

570
00:46:27,258 --> 00:46:31,314
She will do whatever I want!

571
00:46:31,315 --> 00:46:32,867
You have to talk to her.
Talk to her!

572
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:34,270
Hello?

573
00:46:35,218 --> 00:46:37,491
Yes, he's right, I'll do anything.

574
00:46:37,492 --> 00:46:40,619
Actually, if you have 5 euros
I show you.

575
00:46:40,901 --> 00:46:44,761
After I went with someone from
100 years, no longer do that.

576
00:46:44,762 --> 00:46:47,728
You are very cool!
Should we combine a day--to quit.

577
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:52,527
We have to go Tuesday with Amy, in
National Museum of History.

578
00:46:59,842 --> 00:47:02,556
-- No. .. no ... I can not see anything!
-- Not me!

579
00:47:02,932 --> 00:47:06,691
Someone is trying to excite me.
Kelvin?

580
00:47:07,464 --> 00:47:08,249
Just do it.

581
00:47:11,026 --> 00:47:13,450
They are so perfect.
Staying full of milk.

582
00:47:16,698 --> 00:47:17,855
What the hell was that?

583
00:48:05,195 --> 00:48:08,966
Wonderful.
What beautiful creatures of the forest.

584
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:10,968
I'm not happy, even ...

585
00:48:10,969 --> 00:48:15,812
I mean ... I was feeling happy
I do not feel happy ....

586
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:55,404
-- Boy, I knew them they are bonss.
-- They are cool.

587
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:35,519
Yes, you are right or not,
Alvin and the Chipmunks?

588
00:49:38,224 --> 00:49:39,687
I think they have rabies.

589
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:46,847
Where you going, head of Pumpkin?

590
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:52,549

I feel ignored. Nobody me

594
00:50:26,114 --> 00:50:28,152
This is all we got,
baby's mama?

595
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,403
Stay out with the girls

596
00:51:11,517 --> 00:51:12,242
Die!

597
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,359

Forget it, kid, you can not do anything.

600
00:51:33,065 --> 00:51:34,553
She is still alive.

601
00:51:34,554 --> 00:51:36,407
They are eating me, Carter.

602
00:51:36,408 --> 00:51:40,948
I am prepared with eggs Rachel Ray
  40 U.S. dollars per day.

603
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:46,612
You gonna die if you go
there to help her.

604
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:50,603
Hey, "Best Friends Forever"
which is interest of 411 instead of 911?

605
00:51:50,966 --> 00:51:52,784
It is really annoying.

606
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:56,867
You're completely TH, not
I am irritating,

00:52:07,342 --> 00:52:08,415
-- In the end.

610
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,473
It was a wonderful lunch.
Now we will eat you.

611

Honey, knees ...

614
00:52:48,307 --> 00:52:50,565
Yes, but not because of squirrels.

615
00:52:52,056 --> 00:52:54,410
But I still have a headache.

616
00:52:55,961 --> 00:53:06,433
<i> apply for the head.

All right? already, I went everywhere.

625
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:34,911
Forehead, cheeks, nose, eyes, ...

626
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:41,203
This is fantastic, the headache passed.

627
00:53:41,204 --> 00:53:43,769
But I still have an infection
on the lips.

628
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,415
Anybody want a ...?

629
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,392
-- God ...
-- Let's go to the museum.

630
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:09,335
Excuse me, sir ...

631
00:54:10,392 --> 00:54:12,210
What's happening? Where will all?

632
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:15,073
It is a mass evacuation, everyone
should leave the city immediately.

633
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:18,022
You can not, you will also bazaar, Batman?

634
00:54:18,023 --> 00:54:21,851
Hell, yes! ya, am I?
I do not want to die.

635
00:54:21,852 --> 00:54:24,143
I was not in my plans for today. Not on the agenda,
had other things to do.

636
00:54:24,144 --> 00:54:25,859
The plan was: wake up,
make breakfast,

637
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,608
work, experiences
scientific, die. I was not!

638
00:54:28,643 --> 00:54:30,202
I was not, right?

639
00:54:30,203 --> 00:54:31,090
Done?

640
00:54:34,129 --> 00:54:36,985
Anyone who stays in the city after the
11 will be buried under the rubble ..

641
00:54:36,986 --> 00:54:41,322
-- I hate garbage!
-- I have to go to the museum save my girl, Amy.

642
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:42,323
She is stuck!

643
00:54:42,324 --> 00:54:45,835
Sorry to have to go back to your
girl, but you have 0 opportunities to survive.


644
00:54:46,399 --> 00:54:47,726

645
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:52,763
Look, the bus evacuation

The 21? What is this? E. .. 5 to 6 ...

647
00:54:57,305 --> 00:55:01,206

design, is the 9 o'clock in the evening.

648
00:55:01,207 --> 00:55:04,608

649

atunci trebuie sound you urci în
autobuzul sau wing and one of you om mort.

651
00:55:11,695 --> 00:55:13,284
Come on, it is 5:30.

652
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:18,042
Say again ...
5:30? Jesus Christ ...

653
00:55:18,445 --> 00:55:23,023
God, I wasted the whole day I ...
was in the Amazon, ecomprando stuff.

654
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,938
Crap! Why? Why do I

656
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:31,796
Okay, time for plan B.

-- I am a sweet princess!

658
00:55:41,403 --> 00:55:44,175
True story. Had
a woman for some time,

659
00:55:44,176 --> 00:55:48,697
I have been in the top 4 of the
the best lovers.

660
00:55:48,822 --> 00:55:51,903
This is a true story,
and ask me why.

661
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,300
Would you like to see me playing with ... ...

662
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:01,039
Goodbye.

663
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:13,658
Come on, come on!

664
00:56:14,389 --> 00:56:16,574
<i> National Museum of History.
Attention to death and destruction. </ I>

665
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:22,300
Hands up, boy! It's better this sairres
Mach 5, or I will put you in the eye of a balázio ass!

666
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:35,685
You know they say that the first
Homicide is always the hardest,

667
00:56:35,686 --> 00:56:38,706
but I found it easy,
actually very fun.

668
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:42,468
Take this! Come on!

669
00:56:48,914 --> 00:56:52,664
Here you can and no eyes!
How do you like, punk?

670
00:57:09,728 --> 00:57:11,083
I'm just playing with my monkey!

671
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:17,508
Come on!

672
00:57:35,459 --> 00:57:36,230
Go!

673
00:57:38,628 --> 00:57:39,445
Care!

674
00:57:45,476 --> 00:57:47,938
these shoes glass
I do not help to run ...

675
00:57:56,619 --> 00:57:58,198
Will? Help me.

676
00:57:59,023 --> 00:57:59,698
Amy!

677
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,921
-- You came because of me.
-- I love you, Amy.


678
00:58:05,486 --> 00:58:08,291
I know. I also love you.

679
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:12,578
Take me this madilta,
pole on my shoulder?

680
00:58:14,552 --> 00:58:15,460
Ok.

681
00:58:16,047 --> 00:58:19,583
Okay, okay, okay.
It crossed the two sides.

682
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:22,614
It will not be so simple. Calvin,
I will need your help.

683
00:58:22,741 --> 00:58:23,603
Okay.

684
00:58:29,269 --> 00:58:30,716
Why the hell did you do that?

685
00:58:30,717 --> 00:58:33,777
I wanted to let her incosciente,
so do not feel pain.

686
00:58:35,064 --> 00:58:36,024
Well thought out.

687
00:58:37,385 --> 00:58:39,880
... Love is for your own good.

688
00:58:49,144 --> 00:58:52,784
boy, hit like a girl.
Yeah, let me try.

689
00:59:00,478 --> 00:59:01,985
This girl is resistant.

690
00:59:14,537 --> 00:59:17,079
Is not working. Let's just try
take it from here.

691
00:59:18,552 --> 00:59:19,753
I will count to three.

692
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,545
1, 2, 3.

693
00:59:36,178 --> 00:59:38,861
We gotta get out of here, the
building will fall on us.

694
00:59:38,862 --> 00:59:41,929
No, not until I return

695
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,288
This

696
00:59:45,778 --> 00:59:47,646
back to the altar.

697
00:59:48,014 --> 00:59:49,570
A pipe Magic!

698
00:59:50,013 --> 00:59:53,005
skull of Crystal. As in my dreams.

699
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:57,001
No, the legend says that if the skulls
Crystal lacking at the altar, is

700
00:59:57,642 --> 00:59:58,778
Near the end of the world.

701
00:59:58,779 --> 01:00:02,647
Earthquakes, asteroids,
Return of the Spice Girls.

702
01:00:02,648 --> 01:00:03,648
Yes!

703
01:00:05,494 --> 01:00:06,425
Revelation!

704
01:00:06,426 --> 01:00:09,631
And you know all of these things
because work at the museum.

705
01:00:09,632 --> 01:00:12,437
No, because I saw the movie,
Indiana Jones and "crystal skull."

706
01:00:12,438 --> 01:00:13,840
I know what this means?

707
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:17,409
You know you have dreamed of the skull,
and you know about the skull?

708
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,063

It means we are destined to be together?

709
01:00:19,064 --> 01:00:21,205
No. It shows that both
like skulls.

710
01:00:22,338 --> 01:00:23,299
And this, too.

711
01:00:25,398 --> 01:00:28,563
Will we have to get out of here.
They are almost 9 hours.

712
01:00:28,564 --> 01:00:31,542
If we do not hurry--mos
we die!

713
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:36,969
Vai, Calvin, I am here with Amy.

714
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,703
We will return the skull to the altar.

715
01:00:40,578 --> 01:00:42,090
-- Even the sight.
-- Nice to meet you.

716
01:00:42,899 --> 01:00:44,134
We will seek the altar.

717
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:14,595
What's happening?

718
01:01:14,596 --> 01:01:18,037
I think the exposure of
museum and resurrect!

719
01:01:20,663 --> 01:01:21,706
Help!

720
01:01:26,131 --> 01:01:27,344
Yay!

721
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:34,450
Let's get out of here!

722
01:01:38,877 --> 01:01:41,120
-- The sanctuary of the skull of Crystal is here.
-- Okay.

723
01:01:48,088 --> 01:01:49,956
I. .. am ... Beowulf!

724
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:55,674
Hi!

725
01:01:58,959 --> 01:01:59,836
What?

726
01:02:01,421 --> 01:02:02,572
I am Beowulf.

727
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,697
-- Could you put some clothes?
-- I am Beowulf.

728
01:02:06,698 --> 01:02:11,058
I never went to confront someone, and so
And I will fight you.

729
01:02:12,045 --> 01:02:13,600
And if I, I was naked?

730
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:19,171
-- I am Beowulf.
-- This is becoming gay, boy.

731
01:02:19,596 --> 01:02:23,307
-- No, I am not gay ...
-- No, I'm sorry, but you are gay.

732
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,682
It is not gay, is not it!

733
01:02:25,683 --> 01:02:28,089
It is what we do in 507. Pilas

734
01:02:28,956 --> 01:02:30,722
-- Yes
-- Ask anyone.

735
01:02:30,723 --> 01:02:32,759
Okay, I will do,
I will ask my friend Paul,

736
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,406
we go together, alongside the field of relaxation
I see wha he says.

737
01:02:36,526 --> 01:02:40,011
-- Paul?
-- My friend Paul. It's my partner.

738
01:02:41,483 --> 01:02:44,070
It is my friend, but
we are also partners.

739
01:02:45,193 --> 01:02:48,192
-- Partners for life?
-- No, partners in business!

740
01:02:48,193 --> 01:02:51,104
We opened a store
antiques, together.

741
01:02:51,105 --> 01:02:52,061
This is gay.

742
01:02:52,096 --> 01:02:53,380
Why Gay?

743
01:02:53,381 --> 01:02:56,916
Why antiques is gay?,
I like things old.

744
01:02:59,128 --> 01:03:00,366
I am Beowulf!

745
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:04,466
Excuse me, you're ready
to get hurt?

746
01:03:10,907 --> 01:03:13,643
Oh no, Kung--Fu Panda.

747
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:16,977
Should not have done this.

748
01:03:23,959 --> 01:03:26,632
Ready to feel ... the Panda?

749
01:03:55,238 --> 01:03:57,262
The girl seems to me your family, boy,

750
01:03:57,297 --> 01:04:00,386
Last year I paid 20
per 20 minutes,

751
01:04:01,224 --> 01:04:02,418
If I understand.

752
01:04:04,954 --> 01:04:05,907
It is true.

753
01:04:07,706 --> 01:04:08,547
Enough!

754
01:05:03,187 --> 01:05:04,244
Damn!

755
01:05:10,211 --> 01:05:11,893
Yay!

756
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:14,165
Nice work!

757
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:19,308
My dear prince,

758
01:05:19,771 --> 01:05:21,596
You have defended my honor!

759
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:24,306
Kiss me, baby!

760
01:05:48,331 --> 01:05:49,455
You're a guy?

761
01:05:49,855 --> 01:05:51,765
I am a travesti.Pensei you knew.

762
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:05,263
Shows you, Will!

763
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:08,172
I am Beowulf!

764
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:09,759
Yes, I already know.

765
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:15,036
Let go! And you can get a pin and
arrangements you some tickets for "Jersey Boys"!

766
01:06:26,862 --> 01:06:31,336
I am the king of "Dance
for you, "in Latin dance!

767
01:06:32,372 --> 01:06:33,024
No!

768
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:38,638
I will take you to "cruise
of Rosie O'Donnel "

769
01:06:38,673 --> 01:06:42,513
Just me, you and my darling
friend, Jorge Decay.

770
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:43,840
Suck my dick!

771
01:06:48,606 --> 01:06:50,844
Ow! Ow!

772
01:06:55,694 --> 01:06:56,746
Hurry! We have no time ...

773
01:06:59,953 --> 01:07:01,356
Altar of the Crystal Skull

774
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,483
Indiana Jones?

775
01:07:33,699 --> 01:07:35,038
Indiana, my ass!

776
01:07:36,994 --> 01:07:38,146
From here, take me.

777
01:07:45,142 --> 01:07:46,010
Thank you, son.

778
01:07:46,672 --> 01:07:48,173
That's right, I am your father!

779
01:07:50,585 --> 01:07:51,564
You are my father?

780
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:52,543
Your mother won the round.

781
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:55,244
She was a hell of a bitch.

782
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:56,911
Okay, I understand.

783
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:59,523
I regret that you have left
and your mother,

784
01:07:59,829 --> 01:08:01,460
but I had an adventurous spirit.

785
01:08:02,017 --> 01:08:04,799
and that ass magic,
everywhere we did.

786
01:08:06,563 --> 01:08:09,275
Look what we have
here! This is your baby?

787
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:13,013
What young beautiful!

788
01:08:13,696 --> 01:08:17,724
I want a hug, your
As you are well!

789
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,645
Tasty, my God!

790
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,379
Father!

791
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:23,605
-- You are so beautiful ...
-- Dad!

792
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:27,684
That was nice ass, a
hamburgher, honey, you okay with everything!


793
01:08:28,556 --> 01:08:29,314
Father!

794
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:30,653
Practice "Kamasutra"?

795
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,826
Just ask, just ask.

796
01:08:37,009 --> 01:08:38,551
Do not do what your
old "Dad" did!

797
01:08:38,586 --> 01:08:39,901
Make a pledge.

798
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:44,901
Is no cure for herpes and
rays that you do not have.

799
01:09:08,782 --> 01:09:09,394
Looks easy.

800
01:09:09,429 --> 01:09:11,174
It is not so easy, so for me!

801
01:09:16,591 --> 01:09:18,006
Damn, my balls!

802
01:09:23,065 --> 01:09:24,644
You know I have to prang.

803
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:25,200
Okay, Dad.

804
01:10:06,859 --> 01:10:09,720
Why not walk, only to the altar?

805
01:10:09,755 --> 01:10:11,826
It is 3 meters away.

806
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:14,113
Girl innocent!

807
01:10:22,464 --> 01:10:24,566
Do not worry, I'll be fine.

808
01:11:10,168 --> 01:11:12,741
Semanalike Hari, Hari Semanalike.

809
01:11:12,776 --> 01:11:14,522
I am the Guru Pitko.

810
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:17,179
And today we are here together to bring ...

811
01:11:17,214 --> 01:11:21,666
Amy and Will in one,
union of peace and happiness.

812
01:11:22,181 --> 01:11:26,496
E. .. Amy, you're good as corn!

813
01:11:30,225 --> 01:11:35,307
Amy, will accept as peanut butter and

814
01:11:35,342 --> 01:11:36,430
Yes

815
01:11:37,036 --> 01:11:37,839
And Will ...

816
01:11:37,874 --> 01:11:41,810
amy accepted as
owner of your love?

817
01:11:41,845 --> 01:11:42,686
Yes

818
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:47,423
Well, in this case,

819
01:11:47,948 --> 01:11:49,039
unite their fists,

820
01:11:50,733 --> 01:11:52,179
closes the key,

821
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,501
Cut ...

822
01:11:55,882 --> 01:11:57,021
Now things with something ...

823

Are you seeing it with Matt Damon?

828
01:12:31,899 --> 01:12:33,632
I was with Hanna Montana.

840
01:13:09,889 --> 01:13:12,791
Alas, they are burned, and
I was with the princess.

841
01:13:12,826 --> 01:13:14,519

842
01:13:15,197 --> 01:13:16,758

because I am with the wolf!

846
01:13:30,271 --> 01:13:34,094
Take the wolf, it takes a little bit, because I
I am with the babes of "Sex and the City".

01:13:40,692 --> 01:13:45,793
Wolf would have been jealous if you think I would
was the guy with that big belt?
