1
00:00:15,286 --> 00:00:19,046
We're approaching insertion target area,
about a mile from your D. Z.

2
00:00:19,206 --> 00:00:20,966
You ready, WD-40?

3
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,326
I never felt more ready
in my life.

4
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:30,606
Oh, damn! What the hell-
Steele, are you crazy?

5
00:00:30,806 --> 00:00:34,446
<i>Good afternoon, WD-40.</i>

6
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:37,686
<i>We now begin "the free world's in
double jeopardy" round of your mission.</i>

7
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:40,246
<i>He's a sadistic criminal mastermind...</i>

8
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:42,886
<i>and international arms dealer
who has brokered a deal...</i>

9
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:47,486
<i>to sell a stolen Scorpion missile
to a Middle Eastern terrorist cell.</i>

10
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:49,766
<i>The question is.
Who is Rancor?</i>

11
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,046
<i>That's right.
General Derwood Rancor.</i>

12
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:55,886
<i>So why don't you begin your mission.
And good luck to you, WD-40.</i>

13
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,606
<i>And don't forget, WD-40,
as always,</i>

14
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:03,086
<i>this tape will self-destruct
in three seconds.</i>

15
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:07,806
Steele!

16
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:55,606
General Rancor,
your chopper's waiting.

17
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:59,326
Fine. Be there in a minute.
I ain't done with this one yet.

18
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:02,126
Talk to me, boy!

19
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:07,166
He doesn't want to talk.
Take him outside and shoot him.

20
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:22,046
And when you shoot him,
use the silencer.

21
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:39,966
Thank you.
Have a nice flight.

22
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:44,166
Have a great flight.

23
00:02:44,326 --> 00:02:46,086
- Enjoy destroying the world, sir.
- Thank you, ma'am, I will.

24
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:51,206
I'm going in there.

25
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:55,126
My God!
Look at you.

26
00:02:55,286 --> 00:02:58,166
You are such an incredible man.

27
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:03,966
It's my job, darling.
I do it for my country.

28
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:07,806
Hmm? Oh. Good luck.

29
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:10,366
Luck's got nothing to do with it.

30
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:32,846
Nothing can stop me now!

31
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:37,566
Not even that sanctimonious
secret agent Boy Scout Dick-

32
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,686
Yoo-hoo!

33
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:44,326
Steele?

34
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:50,406
- Oh, Dick, don't drop me!
- Hold on! Whoa! Don't!

35
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,326
- Grab my wrist!
- Oh!

36
00:03:56,886 --> 00:04:01,286
Whoa!

37
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:03,926
Don't drop me, Dick! Don't drop me!

38
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:07,806
Honey?

39
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:32,806
<i># A man of intrigue

00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:45,726
<i># If they kicked him

68
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:02,126
Sir, I hate to disturb
you, but we're picking

69
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,126
up something interesting
on the compound...

70
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:06,646
- infrared detection system.
- Well, what is it?

71
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:08,766
Oh, it's this really neat
security system, sir.

72
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:13,126
- It picks up the body heat on the intruders.
- Fine! What is it detecting?

73
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:17,446
Oh, well, it looks like
Agent Barbara Dahl, sir.

74
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:26,326
Barbara Dahl?

75
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:28,886
Hot damn!
At last!

76
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:30,886
Arm me.

77
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:35,606
Y eah.
Now, bring me the bait.

78
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,166
Welcome, Miss Dahl.

79
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:42,406
General Rancor would like to see you.
Don't even think about it!

80
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,126
Put the gun down!

81
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:54,566
Move.
Don't try anything funny.

82
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:57,286
Oh, you morons!

83
00:08:57,406 --> 00:09:00,046
Let go!
Oh! Oh!

84
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:03,526
Well, look at you.

85
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,926
Barbara Dahl.

86
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:09,286
If you ain't the spitting image
of your mama.

87
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:14,366
Don't you talk about my mother,
you hybrid curiosity.

88
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:16,646
My mother was twice the man you are.

89
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,926
Hey, lady,
I think you're carrying...

90
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:22,486
this "spitting image" thing
a little bit too far.

91
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:25,366
Now that I got Barbara Dahl,

92
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:29,806
it's just a matter of time
before Dick Steele comes to get her.

93
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,366
Have you confirmed
this transmission?

94
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:50,206
I have. It's confirmed.
It's Barbara Dahl.

95
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:52,766
Who authorized Agent Barbara Dahl
to go on this operation anyway?

96
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:55,486
No one.
She's working on her own.

97
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:57,486
This one is personal, Coleman.

98
00:09:57,686 --> 00:10:01,486
Well, this personal mission may have
cost a good agent her life...

99
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,566
and put the entire free world
in jeopardy.

100
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:06,286
We must inform the director.

101
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:09,006
This is the director.
What is it, Coleman and Bishop?

102
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:12,206
Sir, we've intercepted a very disturbing
satellite transmission...

103
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:14,566
from our listening post
on the Rock of Gibraltar.

104
00:10:14,726 --> 00:10:16,846
- Well, what is it?
- It's this really big rock...

105
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:19,486
sticking out of the water
on the south coast of Spain.

106
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:25,246
What is the transmission?

107
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:28,166
You will have to see it
to believe it, sir.

108
00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:42,726
- You've got to put it on channel three.
- No, four.

109
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:46,086
- Switch it to VHS.
- And take it off of cable.

110
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:48,446
Put it on the monitor.

111
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,646
And now this
special message from Rancor Industries.

112
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:53,926
She makes a pretty hood ornament,
don't you think?

113
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:59,166
- Rancor!
- Yes, it is I, good ol' General Rancor.

114
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:02,446
I'm back, big as life
and twice as ugly.

115
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:05,166
- But Steele blew him up!
- Apparently not.

116
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,806
You did everything
except eat me,

117
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:09,766
and I'm still alive.

118
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:12,446
All Steele did was blow off
a couple of arms.

119
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:14,566
That's no biggie,
no big thing.

120
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:16,486
Now I got plenty of arms!

121
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:20,966
Big arms. Pretty arms. something.

122
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:28,166
Your pretty little agent
is now part...

123
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:30,646
of the nose cone
on top of my missile.

124
00:11:30,846 --> 00:11:35,086
This missile will be launched
in 36 hours...

125
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:38,046
- and nothing will stop me!
- He's a madman!

126
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:41,286
Only thing is,
I'm missing one little chip...

127
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:45,286
that controls my satellite,
and, daggone, I want it back!

128
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:48,806
Now you hand me my chip,
and I'll give you back your agent.

129
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:52,366
Good God.
He must be stopped!

130
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:55,366
Dick Steele couldn't
stop me 15 years ago,

131
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:59,886
and all the dicks you've got
won't stop me now!

132
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:01,886
Apparently,
he hasn't seen the size...

133
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:03,966
of some of our newer members!

134
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,926
With the chip, he rules the world.

135
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,926
Without the chip,
he destroys the world and-

136
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:14,606
Would you practice someplace else?
I'm trying to think!

137
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:18,846
The world? Ha!

138
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,246
We all know what
General Rancor really wants.

139
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,566
- Steele.
- That's right!

140
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:26,886
- And we're going to give Steele to him.
- Steele?

141
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:31,286
Have you forgotten what happened the last
time Steele was placed in the line of fire?

142
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:50,326
<i>We are stopping here. Traveller wants
to mingle with the crowd.</i>

143
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,406
Oh! Oh, my God!

144
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,246
- Steele, what the hell
are you doing? Get off me!

145
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:22,406
- Get him in there!
Get him in the limo! Cover him!

146
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:26,406
Go, go, go! Go! Go, go!

147
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:34,646
<i>The bridge is out.</i>

148
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:37,606
<i>Do not enter.
The bridge is out.</i>

149
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:41,446
The bridge is out,
damn it! Stop this car!

150
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:11,966
Stay away from the window, sir.

151
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:14,446
Steele, do something!

152
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:34,086
Good job, Steele!
Thanks!

153
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:37,246
- It's about time
that jerk did something right.

154
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:40,206
Hang on, Mr. President!

155
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:52,006
<i>The bridge is out.
Do not enter.</i>

156
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:57,846
Thank God our president
was one hell of a good swimmer.

157
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:02,606
Nonetheless... there's only
one man for this operation.

158
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:05,006
Agent WD-40.
Steele.

159
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:07,166
Dick Steele.

160
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:11,526
Dick, Dick, Dick Steele.

161
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:14,046
Dick.

162
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:18,486
Oh, Dick, that was incredible.

163
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:20,606
Thank you.

164
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:22,766
Don't thank me, darling.

165
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:26,606
The art of lovemaking takes two.

166
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:30,966
Sometimes three or four, depending on
how well you do at the crap tables.

167
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:34,246
- Fore!
- Well, my putter's up.

168
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:37,766
Oh, Dick, I'm exhausted.

169
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:42,726
- You are insatiable.
- Fifteen minutes to tee-off time.

170
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:46,566
I think there's something you and I
should talk about openly and honestly...

171
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,806
before I head off
to my golf game.

172
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:52,166
- What is it, Dick?
- It's a game.

173
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,206
People dress funny.
Hit a little ball with clubs.

174
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,286
Drinking is involved.

175
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:59,406
Is something wrong, Dick?

176
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:01,766
Whatever we've had between us,

177
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:04,646
I think it's only fair that you know
my heart still belongs...

178
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:07,366
to the girl I fell
in love with years ago.

179
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,806
Victoria.
She fell off a cliff.

180
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:12,686
- She died.
- Yes, I know.

181
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,726
I was just getting to that.

182
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:17,766
But after Victoria Dahl,
well, I don't think...

183
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:20,646
I'll ever find room
for another woman in this...

184
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:23,726
ripped-apart, torn-up,
scarred, burned-out...

185
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:26,286
lump in my chest...

186
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,166
where a human heart once beat.

187
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:32,406
I hope you understand
what I'm trying to say to you.

188
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:35,406
Oh, I'll live, Mr. Steele.

189
00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:39,406
It's your life
I'm worried about.

190
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:41,886
I'm glad you understand.

191
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:45,966
I know how much these things can hurt.

192
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,886
Mr. Steele.

193
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:50,406
Hi, Dick.

194
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,566
- Hi, Mr. Steele!
- Good morning, Mrs. Hudmucker.

195
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,446
Fore!
- Watch out.

196
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:06,006
- You all right?
- Thank you.

197
00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:08,886
A little help, please? Thank you.

198
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:15,926
Dinatelli foursome
to starter's window. Mr. Jack Dinatelli.

199
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:19,446
Duck!

200
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,566
Dick, wait!

201
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:30,886
Well, Steve!

202
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:34,726
- Steve Bishop. You look great.
- Thank you. We go back a long way, huh?

203
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:36,286
Yeah.

204
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,126
- Let's have a drink.
- Okay.

205
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,246
Just sit right there, Steve.

206
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:45,166
- The usual, Mr. Steele?
- You betcha.

207
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:47,486
- Well, how's everything at the agency?
- Ah, Dick...

208
00:17:47,686 --> 00:17:50,726
it used to be such fun
killin' a few spies...

209
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:53,286
with gas from a banana grenade.

210
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:56,686
But now, huh, it's all
bureaucratic politics.

211
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:59,526
You gotta fill out 20 forms
in triplicate...

212
00:17:59,686 --> 00:18:01,526
just to take a piss!

213
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,766
Boy, that was fun.

214
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:22,966
- Yeah.
- Thank you!

215
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,406
Oh, man, they don't do stuff
like that at the agency any more.

216
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,486
I'm sorry to hear that, Steve.

217
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:29,926
- Uh, Dickie... there is something.
- Relax, sugar.

218
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:32,286
Steve, I'm out of the Service.

219
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,046
There's a plot
to launch a satellite.

220
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,926
- Now, I'm out of the Service.
Talk about something else.

221
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:41,446
- Bishop.
- Bishop here.

222
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,486
- Got a new lead. Gonna need you here.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

223
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:45,406
- And get a dozen eggs and a gallon of milk.
- Okay.

224
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:47,286
- I'll leave right away.
- Thank you, sir.

225
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,566
No more headsets.

226
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:51,646
Ear buttons. They put the receiver
right in your head now.

227
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:54,686
I gotta get back to the hotel.

228
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:57,766
- The director wants you to see this.
- I'm not interested, Steve.

229
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,546
Please, Dickie.
Take a look at the tape.

230
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:02,406
It'll change your mind.

231
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:19,926
Hmm-hmm.

232
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:33,966
She makes a pretty hood ornament,
don't you think?

233
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:39,126
Yes, it is I,
good ol' General Rancor.

234
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:43,766
I'm back, big as life
and twice as ugly.

235
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,206
- All Steele did was
blow off a couple of arms.

236
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:49,366
Rancor!

237
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:51,486
- That's no biggie, no big
thing. Now I got plenty of arms.

238
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:53,406
He can't be alive.

239
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:56,566
- Your pretty Barbara Dahl-
- My God!

240
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:58,966
Barbara Dahl.

241
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:06,006
Victoria... why would your daughter
join the agency...

242
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,246
knowing what happened to you?

243
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:10,126
Why?

244
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:13,206
Why?

245
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,806
Why, why, why, why?

246
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:21,406
Victoria Dahl...
you were the only woman I ever loved.

247
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:32,076
<i>For today's top story,
we now join Kelly Lange live downtown.</i>

248
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:34,636
<i>Kelly Lange here
for Channel 3 Island News.</i>

249
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:39,076
<i>A tragic accident has claimed the life of
a businessman identified as Steven Bishop,</i>

250
00:21:39,276 --> 00:21:44,176
<i>when a huge grand piano fell from
the 17th floor of the Mayan Hotel...</i>

251
00:21:44,356 --> 00:21:46,476
<i>directly behind me
and landed on his car.</i>

252
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,356
- An accident?
- It seems the man was-

253
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,596
Having a kid at 60, that's an accident.

254
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:54,116
Having a piano fall on you,
that's... bad luck.

255
00:21:54,276 --> 00:21:57,796
<i>We're told that they had to remove the
driver's body from the oil pan of the car.</i>

256
00:21:57,956 --> 00:22:00,196
Operator.

257
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:02,596
Operator, get me Washington.

258
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:04,596
- George?
- D. C.

259
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,996
I'll take care of
the luggage, just some overnight things.

260
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:28,556
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- ... no parking.

261
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:31,716
Do not leave
your baggage unattended.

262
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:34,836
It looks like
you could use a hand.

263
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:41,516
I'm afraid I'm pretty clumsy.

264
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:45,476
- You must be headed to Los Angeles.
- How do you know that?

265
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:49,956
- It's written on your ticket.
- Oh! Thank you.

266
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:52,236
You are welcome.

267
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:54,716
Have a nice flight,
and I wish you adieu.

268
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:58,236
Oh, thank you, but I'm quite satisfied
with the 'do I have.

269
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:09,179
If you want to see me again,
turn around now.

270
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:21,019
Aha.

271
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:32,699
It's right here on the aisle.

272
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:36,779
No, no, no.
I asked for a window seat.

273
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:40,099
I can't be getting up and down just because
somebody wants to be getting in and out.

274
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:42,259
- I have too much to do. I
always have a window seat.

275
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,299
Excuse me, sir.

276
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:48,379
- I was wondering, do you mind?
- No problem. Please, be my guest.

277
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,099
- Actually, I prefer an aisle seat.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

278
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,419
- Be my guest. Here.
- Here, let me help you with these.

279
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:59,059
I hope that this will be the last
of the conversations on this trip.

280
00:23:59,219 --> 00:24:00,659
Your ticket.

281
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:10,059
Take it easy
with that luggage!

282
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:15,859
Excuse me, sir. Could you put your
tray table up for takeoff, please?

283
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,739
No, the tray table stays down, please.
Thank you very much.

284
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:22,939
You've made things
inconvenient enough as it is.

285
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,299
What- What is this?

286
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:27,299
Is this yours?
Do you mind?

287
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,819
It's my briefcase.
Let me make more room for you.

288
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:40,499
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

289
00:24:40,699 --> 00:24:42,419
Please.

290
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,379
Thank you.

291
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:52,219
Do you always take matters
into your own hands?

292
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:55,539
Things often end up
in my hands.

293
00:24:55,739 --> 00:24:58,259
And I bet your hands
end up in a lot of things.

294
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:00,179
Let's just say,
my hands and things...

295
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,619
are often in the same place
at the same time.

296
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:05,979
Could I get you
something to drink?

297
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:10,419
We'll have dry Minoli and Russos,
on the rocks,

298
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:12,339
stirred, not beaten,
twist of lemon,

299
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,819
in chilled glasses,
not frozen.

300
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:17,499
And two of those
curly little straws.

301
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:54,219
<i>Thirty hours, 11 minutes and 10 seconds.</i>

302
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:56,819
<i>Thirty hours, 11 minutes
and 8 seconds.</i>

303
00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:58,899
<i>Thirty hours, 11 minutes
and 5 seconds.</i>

304
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,899
Miss Cheevus,

305
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,539
when Agent Steele
arrives, send him right in.

306
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:08,459
Mm-hmm.

307
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:19,539
- Miss Cheevus, is the director available?
- No, he's married.

308
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:23,379
Oh, you kidder.

309
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:28,539
Miss Cheevus, you wouldn't be trying
to make things hard for me?

310
00:26:28,699 --> 00:26:31,699
Oh, Dick, if only I could.

311
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:35,899
But you know you and I would work
so well together deep undercover.

312
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:41,179
You know the agency's rules
about secrecy. They're very... rigid.

313
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:45,339
Yes, and we wouldn't want
to blow it, would we?

314
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:47,459
Why don't you two just get a motel room?

315
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:50,139
I need you in here now, Steele!

316
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:23,619
Miss Cheevus, wasn't the director
in the office here?

317
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:25,619
He just buzzed me from in there,

318
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:27,459
my little pumpy-whumpy.

319
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,579
I'll just sit down
and wait for him.

320
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:51,859
Great Scott!
Steele, see a doctor!

321
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:55,699
Good show, Steele.

322
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:59,739
I hid for two weeks from
my ex-wife's attorney in this outfit.

323
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:02,099
It's good to see you, WD-40.

324
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:04,099
You're always
my most noble warrior.

325
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:06,539
- Glad to find you, sir.
- Yes, yes, well,

326
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:09,339
we have to find someone else
far more important now.

327
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,939
- You saw the tape with Rancor?
- I can't believe he's alive.

328
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:15,379
He's a madman.
He wants the world.

329
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,739
But I'll be perfectly frank, Dick.
He wants you first.

330
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:22,539
He knew I'd send you the tape,
especially with Barbara Dahl on it.

331
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,259
Barbara Dahl.

332
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:29,139
Looks just like Victoria
when she was alive.

333
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:31,259
We don't have time
for flashbacks.

334
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:34,739
Rancor wants the world.
Fortunately, he wants to kill you first.

335
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:38,779
That may give us needed time. Barbara Dahl's
last transmission was from Los Angeles.

336
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:41,299
We couldn't hold the trace
long enough to pinpoint her.

337
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:45,979
Find her, you find him,
you find the rocket.

338
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:48,659
For the rest of it,
your guess is as good as mine.

339
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:52,259
Miss Cheevus, tell
Noggin we're coming.

340
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:54,419
- Hello, Noggin.
- Steele.

341
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:57,979
Good to see you again. Do you have
a refill of that deathray laser watch?

342
00:28:58,219 --> 00:28:59,899
Ah, a new air freshener?

343
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:01,339
Careful!

344
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,379
Whoo-hoo
Oooh

345
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,219
Not again. Oh!

346
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:08,819
Give me!

347
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:10,899
Well, this looks like
a clever contraption.

348
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:14,019
A mini-
A mini mobile crime lab?

349
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,539
- It's a briefcase.
- I know. What does it do?

350
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:20,059
It holds important papers,
files, pens and a calculator.

351
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:22,579
I understand. But these numbers here,
are they in a certain sequence?

352
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:24,979
The briefcase
is timed to explode?

353
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:28,419
No, it's a lock so people other
than myself can't open my briefcase.

354
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:31,619
Very complex
contemporary technology.

355
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:33,819
All right, Steele,
this is your standard,

356
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,899
state-of-the-art field
kit with three additions.

357
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:40,099
This is our latest development:
microchip Z-ray lenses,

358
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:42,259
capable of penetrating
a layer of clothing.

359
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:44,699
You'll be able to see if
an enemy is carrying a weapon.

360
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:46,299
Oh. Director?

361
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:50,859
Oh, now, Steele...
should you find your hands bound,

362
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:56,139
what you can do is just reach down
and pull this pin with your teeth.

363
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:02,459
Put the tube in your mouth, and squeeze
and it will emit a laser beam...

364
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:05,419
powerful enough to cut steel.

365
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:07,379
Fire in the hole, Director.

366
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:10,059
- Huh? Oh.
- Thank you.

367
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:16,219
Oh, and one more thing.

368
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:18,259
This micro-detonator
has a built-in timer...

369
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:20,699
set to explode 30 seconds
after you plant it.

370
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:23,299
It has enough power
to blow up a two-story building,

371
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:25,219
- so be careful.
- Fantastic.

372
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:27,379
All right.
Well, here we go and, uh-

373
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:30,539
- Oh, the glasses.
- Yeah. Thank you.

374
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:32,619
Good to see you again, Noggin.

375
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:45,579
<i>Bienvenidos a Los Angeles.</i>

376
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:47,859
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles.</i>

377
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,939
<i>Ciudad de los angeles.</i>

378
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,139
<i>City of the angels.</i>

379
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:54,259
<i>?Dónde esta Maria?</i>

380
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,179
<i>Where is Maria?</i>

381
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:58,859
<i>Maria esta en la biblioteca.</i>

382
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,819
<i>Maria is in the library.</i>

383
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:04,019
- Do you have a lighter?
- I use matches.

384
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:06,739
Does your mother know you smoke?

385
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:09,539
Yes, but I don't inhale.

386
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:13,019
- Kabul.
- Uh...

387
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:15,859
I'm Kabul.
Agent WD-40?

388
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:18,059
Get in, get in.

389
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:20,139
In the car.

390
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:26,259
Hello. Excuse me. Ha!

391
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:29,499
Our operatives believe
you may already be in grave danger.

392
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:33,259
Please take a look at this,
Mr. Steele.

393
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,379
In that file is a photo
of Desiree More.

394
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:39,819
She's an expert trained in karate, kung-fu
and is a crack shot. Be on your guard.

395
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:42,459
Rancor may have sent her
to take you out.

396
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:45,419
She likes easy-listening
and guys who share their feelings.

397
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:50,179
Her measurements: 36-24-36-22.

398
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:54,819
Aye, and for God sakes,
be careful, WD-40.

399
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:58,299
One time I got two cousins that got
salmonella poisoning in this hotel.

400
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,539
Ah, sure looked like her.

401
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,619
But you can't be too sure.

402
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:27,499
Yeah, almost positive.

403
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,419
Mm-hmm.

404
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,499
Drink?

405
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:35,179
- Only when I'm thirsty.
- Tap water okay?

406
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:37,699
Poured, not decantered.

407
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,499
Sometimes you see a woman you'd...

408
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:41,419
just love to have kill ya.

409
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:44,939
But timing is everything,
so that was not going to be today.

410
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:47,179
Says who?

411
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:50,059
She's pretty smart.
I decided to play it casual.

412
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,979
Casual is overrated.

413
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:57,979
Oops.

414
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,299
I think the game is over,
Mr. Steele.

415
00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:10,859
You're gonna look like Swiss cheese
when they find you.

416
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:14,979
Oh. That's no Gouda.

417
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:50,299
"Coca Cabana. "

418
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,699
- I'll be back for you.
- Where are you going?

419
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:00,859
In my country we have a saying:

420
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:03,259
"A man who rides a camel is rich,

421
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:06,339
but a man who drives a Ferrari
can get lucky.

422
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,859
Oh, gee, I am so sorry.

423
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:14,819
- What's your phone number?
- Loser.

424
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:16,899
Oh, thank you.

425
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,499
Oh, like, look at what you've done.

426
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,019
End of the line, pal.

427
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,939
Uh...

428
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,979
Hey, goombah!

429
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,419
Huh?

430
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:51,459
Well, well, if it isn't Agent Steele.

431
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:56,539
Excuse me.
Uh, do you have a light?

432
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,139
Yeah, sure.
I got a light.

433
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:08,379
Ow. Ow. Ow.

434
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,499
Very good.

435
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:22,139
Well, remind me never
to light your cigarette.

436
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:24,419
You don't lose guys
like that for long.

437
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:26,499
Let's get the bus.
We'll be safe there.

438
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,699
Transfer? Uh, no, thank you.

439
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,659
Mmm, nice dress.

440
00:35:41,899 --> 00:35:43,739
Next stop:

441
00:35:43,939 --> 00:35:46,019
Sunset Boulevard.

442
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:49,339
I guess it's Sunset Boulevard.

443
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,539
Pop quiz, hotshot.

444
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:01,539
Someone on the bus
without a transfer.

445
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:05,899
He won't pay the fare.
What do you do? What do you do?

446
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,819
Stop the bus
and let him off?

447
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:12,139
Negatory, honcho,
because he cut the brake line.

448
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:28,259
Excusez-moi, monsieur.

449
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:34,259
That was nice.

450
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:35,739
Nicely done.

451
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:37,819
Thank you. Thank you.

452
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:41,019
Next stop: Melrose. I think.

453
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,379
Well, you must be "fameeshed. "
Let's mangez.

454
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,819
That sounds good,
but I'm hungry.

455
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:48,779
Let's eat first.

456
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:54,619
Here you go.
You both enjoy yourselves.

457
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:58,299
Brian will be right here
to take your drink order.

458
00:37:58,499 --> 00:38:01,539
We shared an airplane, a drink.

459
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:04,739
We've been chased,
bussed, seated, but...

460
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:07,859
I still don't really know you.

461
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:11,539
I'm Bud Fudlacker.
I have a small mail-order business.

462
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:13,859
I travel with
the American Gladiators,

463
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,539
I'm 55, I like small appliances...

464
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:18,459
and I do tax accounting
on the side.

465
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:21,779
Let me guess.
You are Dick Steele,

466
00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:25,179
Agent WD-40
with the Secret Service.

467
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:28,939
You are 52,
you like big screen TVs...

468
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:31,419
and you want to stop
General Rancor.

469
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,299
That could describe
a thousand guys.

470
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:36,219
Tell me about you.

471
00:38:36,419 --> 00:38:40,139
I like loose-fitting clothes,
and I drive a '69 Pinto.

472
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:43,659
Hi, I'm Brian.
May I take your drink orders, please?

473
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:47,059
- I'll have-
- A dry Minoli and Russo on the rocks.

474
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,579
Stirred, not beaten.

475
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:53,459
With a twist.
In a chilled glass, not frozen.

476
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:56,899
With two of those
curly little straws.

477
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:58,659
Be right back.

478
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:03,019
Tell me, who are you?

479
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:06,579
Why don't you use your...

480
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:09,899
legendary skills, and guess?

481
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:14,099
You carry a UB-21 Schnauzer
with a Gnab silencer. That's K. G. B.

482
00:39:14,259 --> 00:39:17,299
You prefer an H&K over an A. K.
Your surveillance technique is N. S. A.

483
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:20,259
Your I. D. is C. I. A.
You received your Ph. D. at NYU.

484
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:25,019
Traded in your G. T. O. for a B. M. W.
You listen to CDs by R. E. M. and S. T. P.

485
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:29,059
And you'd like to see J. F. K. in his
B. V. D. s, getting down with O. P. P.

486
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:33,419
And you probably put the toilet paper back
on the roll with the paper on the inside.

487
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:35,459
Hmm.

488
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:39,299
Here's to your remarkable
powers of observation, Mr. Steele.

489
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:44,059
I am Agent 3.14,
Veronique Ukrinsky.

490
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:45,979
My father is the professor.

491
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:50,059
Oh, yes, I know.
The megachip.

492
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:53,499
When he found out he was making the chip
for Rancor, and not for the U. S.,

493
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:55,899
he escaped with it,
and he is in hiding.

494
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,979
In hiding?
Where?

495
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:00,059
He would not take the chance
in telling me where he was headed,

496
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:03,779
but he said,
"The pendant-

497
00:40:03,939 --> 00:40:09,339
Follow the path
of your pendant to find me. "

498
00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:13,779
Hmm... haven't seen
too many like these.

499
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,659
- Pendant.
- Pendant.

500
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:17,419
- Pendant.
- Pendant.

501
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:20,819
- Pendant.
- We don't have much time, WD-40.

502
00:40:20,979 --> 00:40:23,379
Sooner or later,
Rancor will find him.

503
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:27,539
- I'll order our food to go.
- Oh, Dick, I am so worried about my father.

504
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:30,859
What shall we do, huh?
What shall we do?

505
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:06,059
Excuse me. Do you have reser--

506
00:41:07,778 --> 00:41:09,258
Steele's here somewhere.

507
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:13,059
Rancor wants him dead.
Find him.

508
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:17,899
Dance time is over.
Cigarettes? Cigars?

509
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,939
- There he goes. Kill him!
- Throwing knife?

510
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:22,979
Cigarettes? Cigars?
Throwing knife?

511
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:24,659
Thanks.

512
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:27,658
Cigarettes?
Cigars?

513
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:31,493
Whoops.

514
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:33,059
Why?

515
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:41,699
Quick. Get this
up against the door.

516
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:51,179
I got an idea.

517
00:41:51,379 --> 00:41:53,379
This is a picture
of my father.

518
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,579
If we get separated,
find him, save him.

519
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:01,099
Why?

520
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:05,219
Go! Go, go, go!

521
00:42:05,459 --> 00:42:08,859
- Oh, shut up!
- Ow! I came here to dance!

522
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,939
Ow! Dick, help me!

523
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,779
I'll kill you!

524
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:16,499
- Get in this-
- No, let me go!

525
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:34,299
- Okay, let's go!
- Dick, help me!

526
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:43,779
<i>"Follow the path
of your pendant to find me."</i>

527
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:46,939
- What is that?
- It's her pendant.

528
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,099
"Follow the path
of the pendant to find me."

529
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:51,579
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

530
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:55,459
- Ah!
- What? What?

531
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:57,699
No.

532
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:00,379
Any idea where it came from?

533
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,659
- Museum of Natural History.
- How do you know that?

534
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:07,139
It says it really small
right there at the bottom.

535
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:10,059
All right. Take me
to the Museum of Natural History.

536
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:14,499
- You know, in my country we do have a saying.
- I'm sure you do.

537
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:18,899
The saying goes: "The museum is closed at
5:00. You go the next morning at 9:00."

538
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,859
Excuse me, Mr. Pushy!

539
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,779
Son of a bitch.

540
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:30,819
I'm getting sick and tired
of your-

541
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:43,459
Mm-hmm.

542
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,499
No, he'd never fit in there.

543
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:54,139
Ah. Sir-

544
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:57,179
I'm sick and tired
of these games.

545
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:06,659
This is stupid. Stupid. We're
a government agency, for God sakes.

546
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:11,819
Huh?

547
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:15,819
Aha!

548
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:23,059
Good God!
You're sicker than I thought!

549
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:26,699
What is it, Coleman?
I'm busy!

550
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:30,339
- I, uh, can see that.
- You wouldn't understand.

551
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:32,459
It's the ancient art
of origatsi.

552
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:36,299
What I don't understand is your insistence
in keeping Steele on this assignment!

553
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:38,739
He still is
no closer to Rancor,

554
00:44:38,899 --> 00:44:41,619
and we have who knows how little time
left before Rancor launches this satellite.

555
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,939
You better let me take over
this search before I-

556
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:47,859
Before you what, Coleman?

557
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,099
I don't know whose monkey
you spanked to get this job,

558
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:52,819
but as far as I'm concerned,
you're a disgrace to the Service.

559
00:44:52,979 --> 00:44:54,739
How dare you!

560
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:57,299
You and your one-for-all-and-all-for-one
bleeding heart nonsense!

561
00:44:57,459 --> 00:45:00,179
You're too old
to run this agency!

562
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:02,539
And since you won't step down,

563
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:05,299
you'll, uh, be stepped on!

564
00:45:07,419 --> 00:45:10,819
Ha! Loser!

565
00:45:10,979 --> 00:45:13,099
What you got?

566
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:15,299
Is there a jewelery
district in Los Angeles?

567
00:45:15,499 --> 00:45:17,219
Come on, this is
Hollywood. We have jewelery.

568
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:18,979
We have women who are willing to sleep-

569
00:45:19,179 --> 00:45:21,059
More important, is there
a Russian jewelery section?

570
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:22,979
Da.

571
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:25,579
- Where?
- I don't know.

572
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:29,259
There used to be a bunch of Russian
jewelers hung out at the warehouse at, uh...

573
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:32,659
at 31st and Phlegm.

574
00:45:32,859 --> 00:45:36,179
Ah, damn it!

575
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:38,099
Meet me back at the hotel.
We'll split up.

576
00:45:38,259 --> 00:45:40,259
- After you.
- Thank you.

577
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:42,179
Excuse me.

578
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:44,579
Get off!

579
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:02,699
Whoa! Whoa! Wh-Whoa!

580
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,539
Watch it! Watch it!

581
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:32,019
Whoa.

582
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:37,099
Cheerio.

583
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:06,379
You're mine, Steele!

584
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:15,139
Whoa!

585
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:20,299
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

586
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:29,739
Huh?

587
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:53,899
Okay, bring it up!
Bring it up! Up, up, up!

588
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:56,939
Okay, that's where
the sign goes!

589
00:47:58,899 --> 00:48:00,819
Ah, 31st and Phlegm.

590
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:02,739
I'm on the waiting list
for a co-op.

591
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:11,539
You better get outta here.
I'll see you back in half an hour.

592
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:13,579
Oh, half hour?
I can drop off my dog at the groomer.

593
00:48:43,499 --> 00:48:47,899
- Wha-
- Mr. Steele, I presume?

594
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:51,779
- Professor-
- Ukrinsky. With a "Y.'"

595
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:04,059
Ah. Right.

596
00:49:06,259 --> 00:49:08,699
The pendant.

597
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:11,019
And I suppose...

598
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:13,299
this is what you need.

599
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:15,779
And this is?

600
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:18,179
This is the controller
chip for Rancor's satellite.

601
00:49:18,379 --> 00:49:20,739
Ah, Rancor finally
made his megachip.

602
00:49:20,979 --> 00:49:22,739
Who'd have thought the fate
of so many human lives...

603
00:49:22,899 --> 00:49:24,819
would rely on something so small?

604
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:27,819
Well, there's only one thing
to do with this.

605
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:35,139
No! No! What are you doing?

606
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,059
Trying to make the
world safe from tyranny.

607
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,819
You mustn't do that!

608
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:41,499
This can also be used
for world peace!

609
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:43,539
Oh, I'm sorry.

610
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:47,379
You'd better let me get that into
the proper hands and get you to safety.

611
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:51,019
You found me through
my daughter, the pendant.

612
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:52,059
Right.

613
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:54,299
Veronique is safe?

614
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:56,379
Yeah, the van they took her in
has dual air bags and seat belts.

615
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:01,459
- Kabul.
- Nice new wheels, huh?

616
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:05,099
Yeah, quite an improvement.
In the back, Professor.

617
00:50:05,259 --> 00:50:07,859
We have to find a safe place
for the professor.

618
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:09,939
In my country,
we have saying:

619
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:13,219
"The rabbit hops, the spider crawls,
but the camel spits".

620
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:15,299
Let's see
if this Charger can run.

621
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:22,539
Now I don't want you
to be surprised.

622
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:26,579
This guy's one of our top agents.
He's most capable.

623
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,659
- McCluckey!
- Kabul!

624
00:50:38,419 --> 00:50:41,299
- Come on in.
- All right. Come on.

625
00:50:41,459 --> 00:50:43,899
McCluckey, we need
to hide the professor.

626
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:47,099
- Professor Ukrinsky, it's an honor.
- How do you do?

627
00:50:47,259 --> 00:50:50,259
I've read all your work and your
last paper on laboratory loneliness.

628
00:50:50,459 --> 00:50:53,099
- Superb!
- Well, thank you.

629
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,619
- McCluckey, I'd like you to
meet Agent-- Dick Steele.

630
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:59,339
Agent WD-40.
Good to see you back in action.

631
00:50:59,499 --> 00:51:03,979
Your video on deception,
Is It A Woman? Is The Moustache Real?

632
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:05,899
Beautiful work!

633
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:09,419
- Thank you.
- McCluckey, we need to hide this guy.

634
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:12,859
Sure, sure. Come this way.
He'll be safe here.

635
00:51:13,899 --> 00:51:15,659
Do you have a telephone?

636
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:17,739
Right over there.

637
00:51:17,899 --> 00:51:20,899
- Is it clean?
- I have a woman that comes in once a week.

638
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:27,699
- Sir?
- What?

639
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:30,379
I have Dick "Luscious Lips"
Steele on the line.

640
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:33,659
Put him through.

641
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:35,539
Director, is it safe?

642
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:40,699
Safe? Just a minute.
I'll use the cloaking device.

643
00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:52,139
Go ahead, Dick.
It's safe.

644
00:51:52,299 --> 00:51:55,619
I have the chip
Rancor needs to launch his satellite.

645
00:51:55,819 --> 00:51:59,859
Good, Dick, good. Are you coming in?

646
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:02,059
No, Rancor kidnapped
the professor's daughter.

647
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,139
I've got to find her.

648
00:52:04,339 --> 00:52:07,139
Yes, well... good, Dick.

649
00:52:07,299 --> 00:52:11,019
Good luck.
Call me if I can help.

650
00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:22,659
- That Steele's gonna be sorry...

651
00:52:22,819 --> 00:52:24,899
his mama ever met his papa.

652
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:29,059
We gonna heat up the fire! Boys!

653
00:52:29,259 --> 00:52:31,019
They always seem to know
every move we make.

654
00:52:31,179 --> 00:52:32,939
It's inside.
It's got to be somebody inside leaking.

655
00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:35,659
Well, I'm not leaking.
I can prove it.

656
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,579
- You go ahead, ask me something.
- What?

657
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:40,459
Ask me something.
Ask me who's the director of our agency.

658
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:43,659
- Who is the director of our agency?
- I don't know.

659
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:45,579
You see, I know who it is, you see?

660
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:49,579
But I'm not going to tell you,
you see, because I am no leak.

661
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:52,219
This place has got to be
a front for Rancor and his men.

662
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:57,219
There's one of them now. Follow him.

663
00:52:57,379 --> 00:52:59,779
Do you have
to keep revving the engine?

664
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:03,979
Ah, but it's an American V-8.
It's such a beautiful sound.

665
00:53:04,219 --> 00:53:06,259
Oh, Steele, listen to this.

666
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:09,539
My cousin's a recording star.

667
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:12,139
Duck! Ow!

668
00:53:23,259 --> 00:53:25,779
- Did he see us?
- Shh. Okay.

669
00:53:32,899 --> 00:53:35,019
- I'm going in there.
- Okay.

670
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:38,539
- Give me cover.
- I got to buy my lottery ticket.

671
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:46,019
- Rancor's guy is here.
- Right.

672
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:49,899
<i>That saved a wretch</i>

673
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,579
<i>Like me</i>

674
00:53:52,819 --> 00:53:57,259
<i>I once was lost</i>

675
00:53:57,459 --> 00:54:02,019
<i>But now am found</i>

676
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:04,299
<i>Was blind-</i>

677
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:11,939
- What are you doing here?
- I am... the new choirmaster.

678
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:16,139
- Where did you come from?
- The humble room. I was doing refractories.

679
00:54:16,299 --> 00:54:18,819
- "Refractories"?
- A new popal revelate.

680
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:21,739
Uh, John, chapter 7, verse 2.

681
00:54:21,899 --> 00:54:23,219
"Popal"?

682
00:54:23,419 --> 00:54:27,019
Uh, sisters.
Michael, chapter 7, verse 2.

683
00:54:27,219 --> 00:54:29,099
"Sing as ye play.

684
00:54:29,259 --> 00:54:32,779
Yea, unto thee
a voice like a blenth."

685
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:35,379
And as you approach
the allo tropo, please,

686
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:39,339
tres mucho picante abierto.

687
00:54:50,979 --> 00:54:53,699
Are you gentlemen with Rancor?

688
00:54:53,859 --> 00:54:56,979
Steele's here somewhere.

689
00:54:58,179 --> 00:54:59,619
- Well, find him!

690
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:27,899
- All right, random inspection.

691
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:30,979
- Directive 21, Psalm 2.

692
00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:01,379
Veronique?

693
00:56:01,539 --> 00:56:03,659
- Dick.
- You all right?

694
00:56:03,779 --> 00:56:06,019
Get out of here. This
is a front for Rancor.

695
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:08,259
Yes, I know.

696
00:56:08,419 --> 00:56:14,019
I'll- I'll get out of here, all right.
But you're coming with me.

697
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:15,819
Stat! Code Yellow!
Code Yellow!

698
00:56:15,979 --> 00:56:18,539
- Get me three CCs of epinephrinox!
- Right away.

699
00:56:18,699 --> 00:56:19,979
Get me two liters of gasohol
mixed with neonephicine!

700
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:21,259
On my way.

701
00:56:21,459 --> 00:56:23,659
- Get the electrostatifyer, now!
- I'll warm up the generator, sister.

702
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:25,739
She's about to go
into fibrolcanination!

703
00:56:25,899 --> 00:56:27,979
- Prepare the operating room!
Yes, sister. I'll get right on it.

704
00:56:30,899 --> 00:56:34,579
For God's sake, can anyone
in this hospital help me?

705
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:51,579
Oh. Mm-mm. No.

706
00:57:03,099 --> 00:57:05,179
High blood pressure.

707
00:57:09,299 --> 00:57:13,659
Here. You'll be safe here.
I'll be right back.

708
00:57:26,299 --> 00:57:30,899
Oh, Dick, it's so cold.

709
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:35,299
What have they done to you?
They'll pay for this.

710
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:37,339
Oh, Dick...

711
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,939
Move 'em, fat heads!

712
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:49,539
Sisters, make 'em holy!

713
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:54,299
Oh, Dick, you came for me.

714
00:57:54,459 --> 00:57:57,859
Tell me, what's been happening?

715
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,819
Well, I've been doing
a lot of soul-searching,

716
00:57:59,859 --> 00:58:01,539
getting in touch with my inner child.

717
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:03,499
I have decided I love you.

718
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:05,739
But what about my father?

719
00:58:05,939 --> 00:58:09,099
Well, I like him.
I just have to get to know him better.

720
00:58:09,259 --> 00:58:11,459
No, is he okay?
Have you got his chip?

721
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:13,739
Oh, no, he's fine,
and I've got the chip.

722
00:58:13,899 --> 00:58:16,139
Oh, I love you too.

723
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:23,339
Look out, you crazy nun!

724
00:58:29,379 --> 00:58:31,779
Thanks, guys, I stopped you.
You could have been killed!

725
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:35,419
Quick, let me help.

726
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,459
You smell nice.

727
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:41,979
Where is my father?

728
00:58:42,139 --> 00:58:43,899
Is he safe?

729
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:47,299
He's safe, Veronique.
Safe as you and me.

730
00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:49,699
So cute.

731
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,099
Oh! Oh!

732
00:58:52,259 --> 00:58:54,379
Safer.

733
00:58:54,579 --> 00:58:57,739
In my country, when an irate,
armless, psychotic weirdo...

734
00:58:57,899 --> 00:58:59,659
chase your woman,
you must hide her.

735
00:59:00,899 --> 00:59:02,699
Upstairs.
Apartment 5B.

736
00:59:02,899 --> 00:59:04,779
I'll wait downstairs.
I'll keep my eyes open.

737
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:11,859
I just put in new carpet.
Take your shoes off.

738
00:59:19,259 --> 00:59:23,499
Oh, Dick... it is so nice to know...

739
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:26,419
that everything
is going to be all right.

740
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:30,539
You have the chip.

741
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:34,179
My father is safe.

742
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:36,899
You love me, Dick.

743
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:38,939
Love?

744
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:44,099
Let me tell you
about love, Veronique.

745
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:47,779
Love is a dew drop
on a rose petal.

746
00:59:47,939 --> 00:59:50,539
Love is a drop of rain,

747
00:59:50,739 --> 00:59:53,859
pure and shimmering
and trembling.

748
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:57,099
So moist, so wet.

749
00:59:57,299 --> 01:00:02,139
And those tiny little drops of love,

750
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:04,099
they come together,

751
01:00:04,299 --> 01:00:08,139
gathering up broken buds
and fallen flowers...

752
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:12,259
and dirt and dung...

753
01:00:12,459 --> 01:00:14,339
and deer droppings,

754
01:00:14,539 --> 01:00:19,019
flowing faster and faster,
outward to the sea.

755
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:21,579
Onward and onward -

756
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:46,219
Good night.

757
01:00:46,459 --> 01:00:50,099
We'll talk more
in the morning.

758
01:01:16,299 --> 01:01:18,459
Hey, hotshots.

759
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:22,299
- Come and get me.
- Why, you little, no-good juvenile delinquent!

760
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:24,139
- Go on! Get him!
- Come on!

761
01:01:25,899 --> 01:01:28,979
Cool. Heads up!

762
01:01:30,419 --> 01:01:32,619
- Nice shot. I'm going.
- Go on! Go on!

763
01:01:32,779 --> 01:01:35,939
We got you now!

764
01:01:36,139 --> 01:01:38,019
Where's the professor?

765
01:01:38,179 --> 01:01:40,459
With Gilligan, dickweed.

766
01:01:44,499 --> 01:01:47,219
- No!
- This is for Getting Even With Dad!

767
01:01:47,379 --> 01:01:49,779
- And this is for My Girl.
- And this is for My Girl 2.

768
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:52,859
I wasn't even in My Girl 2.

769
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:55,219
- We don't care!
- We don't care!

770
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,059
Last time I'm gonna ask you,
smart boy.

771
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:03,699
- Where's the professor?
- Okay, okay, down the hall to the right.

772
01:02:05,299 --> 01:02:07,579
Okay, the left!

773
01:02:11,419 --> 01:02:13,459
Help! Somebody help me!

774
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:16,859
They're taking us to Kikiree Island!

775
01:02:20,179 --> 01:02:22,539
They've taken him to Rancor!

776
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:24,939
They won't kill him... not
until he's installed the chip.

777
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:28,579
- Wha- - Probably not even then.
Maybe just torture him a little.

778
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:32,099
We'll talk about this on the way.
Let's get to Kikiree.

779
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:44,899
You like this disguise?

780
01:02:45,059 --> 01:02:46,979
It's very good.

781
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:48,899
I'm proud of this one.

782
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,259
Like this,
I can look like anybody.

783
01:02:52,419 --> 01:02:56,319
Rancor Industries
owns this little island.

784
01:02:56,459 --> 01:03:00,739
The natives say there are stranger goings-on
here than at Neverland Valley Ranch.

785
01:03:00,899 --> 01:03:03,579
- Look.
- Uh-huh. It's nice.

786
01:03:05,059 --> 01:03:08,899
- Kabul, stay in the boat.
- Why?

787
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:10,779
There's a saying
in my country:

788
01:03:10,939 --> 01:03:13,819
"When you hear the words, 'Stay in
the boat', you stay in the boat. "

789
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:16,059
Bye-bye.

790
01:03:23,419 --> 01:03:25,939
Dick, this is crazy.

791
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:31,099
Crazy? Some people think walking down
the street muttering to yourself is crazy.

792
01:03:31,259 --> 01:03:33,019
I'll tell you
what crazy is.

793
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:35,779
Crazy is walking down the street
with half a cantaloupe on your head,

794
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:38,019
saying, "I'm a hamster."

795
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:40,419
"I'm a hamster."
That's crazy.

796
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:49,099
Ooh.

797
01:03:49,299 --> 01:03:51,979
My life's work
is now complete.

798
01:03:52,179 --> 01:03:54,699
Your cooperation
is commendable, Professor.

799
01:03:54,859 --> 01:03:56,619
Thank you.

800
01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:01,419
Throw him in the cell.

801
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:04,459
- But you said it was
for the world peace! Yeah, yeah.

802
01:04:12,899 --> 01:04:16,859
Hello, General. It's Skippy.
They're on the island.

803
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:19,179
Yeah.

804
01:04:19,379 --> 01:04:22,739
Well, well, well,
what perfect timing.

805
01:04:22,899 --> 01:04:24,699
It seems we're gonna have more guests.

806
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,819
Steele's not dead.

807
01:04:27,019 --> 01:04:28,739
He's on his way here.

808
01:04:28,939 --> 01:04:32,379
- Throw her in with the others!
- No! Please! Please!

809
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:36,379
- I thought you loved me!
- Naw, I was just usin' you.

810
01:04:36,579 --> 01:04:39,259
<i>Seven hours, 59 minutes
and 41 seconds.</i>

811
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:42,459
<i>Seven hours, 59 minutes
and 38 seconds.</i>

812
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,379
<i>Seven hours, 59 minutes
and 30-</i>

813
01:04:51,859 --> 01:04:52,539
Dick, look out!

814
01:04:54,379 --> 01:04:56,299
Got you now, Steele.

815
01:04:57,999 --> 01:04:59,139
Hey, where you goin'?

816
01:05:00,499 --> 01:05:01,239
Take that!

817
01:05:03,615 --> 01:05:05,135
Hey, come back here!

818
01:05:08,723 --> 01:05:10,223
Nowhere to go, Steele.

819
01:05:16,649 --> 01:05:19,409
How fast can you run, my friend?

820
01:05:20,853 --> 01:05:22,313
My God!

821
01:05:23,259 --> 01:05:25,179
All right, men, tie him up.

822
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,162
Okay, go ahead, kill me.

823
01:05:28,419 --> 01:05:31,939
I got a bomb. You touch me,
and you'll blow up yourself.

824
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:35,939
You don't really think I'm gonna fall for
that old tied-to-the-bomb trick, do ya?

825
01:05:38,909 --> 01:05:42,309
Well, how about
the old snake trick?

826
01:06:05,219 --> 01:06:06,979
- What is it?
- Shh.

827
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,740
Let's go.

828
01:06:18,788 --> 01:06:22,388
<i>Two hours, 59 minutes
and 26 seconds to launch.</i>

829
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:25,930
<i>Two hours, 59 minutes
and 21 seconds to launch.</i>

830
01:06:25,979 --> 01:06:29,059
<i>Two hours, 59 minutes
and 19 seconds to launch.</i>

831
01:06:29,259 --> 01:06:31,799
We've got to find a way
into Rancor's complex.

832
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:34,819
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

833
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:14,459
Here, help me with this.

834
01:07:14,619 --> 01:07:17,739
- How patriotic, Dick.
- And deadly.

835
01:07:17,939 --> 01:07:19,979
Ooh, Dick.

836
01:07:28,019 --> 01:07:29,859
<i>Bearing 177.5.</i>

837
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:32,819
<i>On my mark.
Hi, Mark.</i>

838
01:07:33,019 --> 01:07:35,459
<i>Get set.</i>

839
01:07:35,659 --> 01:07:38,059
- Father!
- My child.

840
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:42,859
Well, well.
Dick Steele.

841
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:45,699
I'd shake your hand,
but I don't remember where it landed.

842
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:49,299
Clever! Clever? Clever.

843
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:51,459
Take their weapons.

844
01:07:54,979 --> 01:07:56,739
Mm-hmm.

845
01:07:59,019 --> 01:08:02,099
Throw her in with the others.
Bind him.

846
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,979
- Dick Steele?
- Oh, Ms. Dahl.

847
01:08:13,699 --> 01:08:15,499
- Barbara Dahl.
- Get your paws off me...

848
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:17,659
...you damn dirty apes!

849
01:08:21,619 --> 01:08:23,579
- No!
- You remember Barbara Dahl.

850
01:08:23,739 --> 01:08:25,539
Victoria's daughter?

851
01:08:25,699 --> 01:08:30,859
I'd like to see you watch her go up
like you watched her mother go down.

852
01:08:31,059 --> 01:08:35,419
But I'd rather let you just be
a dessert for my little pet.

853
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:39,979
What's left of you will have
to watch helplessly...

854
01:08:40,139 --> 01:08:44,619
while I play Mortal Kombat
with the entire world!

855
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:27,259
Huh?

856
01:09:34,539 --> 01:09:37,379
It's gonna blow! Hurry up!

857
01:09:48,219 --> 01:09:50,939
Come on!

858
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:33,819
You are very immature.

859
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:36,259
Bullies tend to have
very bad self-esteem.

860
01:10:38,459 --> 01:10:41,539
Aha!

861
01:10:43,019 --> 01:10:45,539
Oh-ho!

862
01:10:48,419 --> 01:10:50,699
Leave me alone!
I'm an unarmed man!

863
01:11:20,739 --> 01:11:24,499
- Oh, Miss Cheevus.
- Dick, I'm sorry.

864
01:11:24,699 --> 01:11:27,939
<i>- One minute and 22 seconds.
One minute and 21 seconds.</i>

865
01:11:29,099 --> 01:11:30,099
- You were under the
influence of an evil man.

866
01:11:30,299 --> 01:11:32,219
- It was still a lousy thing to do.

867
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:36,059
<i>One minute and 18 seconds.
One minute and 17 seconds.</i>

868
01:11:36,219 --> 01:11:40,539
- Oh-oh. General, it's broken.

869
01:11:40,699 --> 01:11:44,379
Well, you'll like space.
Lots of elbow room and-

870
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:46,619
- Oh, whoops. Sorry.

871
01:11:46,779 --> 01:11:50,139
<i>- One minute and 11 seconds.
One minute and 10 seconds.</i>

872
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:54,779
Yeah, you lose, Steele!
That countdown is irreversible!

873
01:11:56,209 --> 01:11:57,129
Really?

874
01:11:58,059 --> 01:11:59,419
<i>- One minute and five seconds.</i>

875
01:11:59,579 --> 01:12:01,419
- Let's just see how...

876
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:04,339
...irreversible that really is.

877
01:12:04,499 --> 01:12:06,259
It's irreversible,

878
01:12:06,419 --> 01:12:09,459
and there's nothing you
patriotic pansies can do about it!

879
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,739
Let me tell you
what being patriotic really is,

880
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:14,659
you scumbag poop.

881
01:12:14,899 --> 01:12:18,299
This is a great country where a man can
sue anyone he wants anytime he wants.

882
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:21,979
It's a great country because
thousands of people die every year...

883
01:12:22,139 --> 01:12:24,499
from handguns, and,
yet, at this very moment,

884
01:12:24,659 --> 01:12:29,339
you can still walk into a convenience
store anywhere and buy one of those guns.

885
01:12:29,499 --> 01:12:31,579
- That's democracy.
- It's finally time somebody does...

886
01:12:31,779 --> 01:12:33,659
what that fool Steele
should have done.

887
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:35,459
- This is a great country...
- And it's gonna be me!

888
01:12:37,427 --> 01:12:39,827
- Let's go!

889
01:12:40,539 --> 01:12:43,939
- to run for the office of the President.
- Let's go! Move it!

890
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,779
- This is a great country
because any moron can

891
01:12:46,939 --> 01:12:48,979
All right, everyone, drop your guns!

892
01:12:49,179 --> 01:12:51,139
I'm, uh, taking over!

893
01:12:53,739 --> 01:12:55,979
Steele... get down from there.

894
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:59,699
Dick, come on. We have to go.

895
01:12:59,859 --> 01:13:02,379
- Now!
- Oh!

896
01:13:02,539 --> 01:13:04,339
- Come on! Come on!
- I wasn't finished.

897
01:13:04,499 --> 01:13:06,259
Quick! Hurry up! Just move it!

898
01:13:06,419 --> 01:13:08,179
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

899
01:13:11,539 --> 01:13:14,859
Steele, you're always
doing this to me!

900
01:13:16,899 --> 01:13:19,259
You lose, Steele!

901
01:13:19,419 --> 01:13:21,179
I'm not through!
I'll be back!

902
01:13:21,339 --> 01:13:23,699
Maybe just tissue or a brain!

903
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:26,579
- Open the door! I'm stuck in here!
- I'll be back!

904
01:13:26,739 --> 01:13:29,899
- I'm going up, but you
and your whole world...

905
01:13:30,099 --> 01:13:32,059
are going down!

906
01:13:32,259 --> 01:13:34,739
- I'll be back, maybe without legs...
- Open the damn door!

907
01:13:34,939 --> 01:13:38,499
- or some other minor organ.
- Wait! I don't want to miss the fireworks!

908
01:13:50,019 --> 01:13:52,099
How about a hand
for General Rancor?

909
01:13:54,099 --> 01:13:56,739
You're not through with me!

910
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,579
Ah, well.

911
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:03,895
Houston, we have a problem.
